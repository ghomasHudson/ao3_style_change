"You already have, by making Harry happy," Molly told him. "No apology necessary, but consider it accepted anyway. I can see you're not the same person you were at school. Now, Ron's told me about your singing, so I'm assuming that the current problem is with your voice?"
. I'm afraid we've all been so busy just trying to get the school ready to open on time that we haven't even considered changing anything, and that was remiss of us. I wish you
"'M not asleep," croaked Draco. Then he sat bolt upright, looking horrified. "I'm not asleep," he croaked again, "and WHY AM I CROAKING?"
"Sure. Oh, wait! I almost forgot!" Draco hurried out of the room and returned with a small paper bag. "I got this for you," he said.
Draco smiled and took hold of Harry's arm, and a moment later they were emerging from an alley near a church that seemed to be called "The Hidden Gem". True enough, in the very next road there were dozens of market stalls, and Draco and Harry started wandering among them.
one at that point, mind you. But I was always quite intrigued. I even got some books out of the library at one point to find out how to do it, and whether there were any other sex-type things I didn't know about."
"You know, they put marshmallows in their hot chocolate in America," said Harry, sipping his own hot chocolate. "Have you ever tried that?"
"Penny for your thoughts," said Hermione, appearing suddenly next to him and giving him a quick hug.
"This is actually quite exciting," said Draco. "It hadn't even occurred to me that I needed this, and if it had I wouldn't have dreamed of asking
"I wish I could say you're being ridiculous, but sadly I think you're probably right," said Harry. "Hopefully you being seen shopping with them – especially shopping for
"You're naughty. I like it," said Harry, as he crawled in with him. "But now I'm going to do the same to you. Turn over onto your other side. No, wait, that's no good. We need to be facing the other way."
Draco's face came into Harry's mind – not for the first time that day, but this time he was rolling his eyes rather than looking slightly flushed after Harry's kiss (
They entered the house and wandered through several beautiful rooms filled with paintings. "This is the one they've given us for the concert," Draco told Harry, as they arrived in a room whose paintings were mainly of sailing ships. There was a Christmas tree in the corner, as there had been in every room they'd passed through, but this one seemed to have slightly incongruous decorations; Harry's eye was caught by several glowing hearts.
"I'm not sure I should tell you," said Draco. "It might exacerbate your injuries. Your husband almost died laughing when I told him."
The challenge officially ended with prompt 24, so I made the most of not having a deadline and got a bit carried away! Thank you all for reading and commenting – I never thought I'd reach day 25, and I wouldn't have without the comments. Thank you as well to  for running this whole challenge despite being ill and having other traumas to deal with – it is very much appreciated. And, finally – I was pleased to be able to tie up a lot of loose ends in this chapter, but I have to admit that what made me smile the most was when I accidentally used the phrase "one direction" :-)
Hermione stepped through the fireplace into Peacock Cottage and looked quickly around the room. "It's OK, you can come through," she called behind her.
Draco took a piece of Victoria sponge cake, but paused with it halfway to his mouth. "What's the matter?" he asked.
Lucius did indeed appear to have slept through all this, but he was soon roused and seated at the dinner table. He, too, appeared not to recognise Harry, but was very cordial when introduced.
. And then the more experienced skater (that’s me, by the way, although that may well not have been clear to anyone watching) is supposed to take the beginner (that’s you, in case you’ve forgotten) by both hands and lead him slowly round the rink. It’s supposed to be
Harry gaped at her for a moment, then nodded reluctantly. "I do love her, though," he said. "Just maybe not quite as much as she deserves."
“I agree totally,” said Harry. “We often get American Aurors visiting, and they’re all so friendly and they always say ‘what are you doing for the holidays?’ and
He kissed Draco, only stopping when someone cleared their throat nearby. They looked up to find Rita Skeeter standing there, notepad at the ready.
Harry felt himself blush, but told himself firmly that Draco couldn't have been clearer about what he wanted, so there was no shame in taking him at his word. "I feel like I've just opened my best ever Christmas present," he admitted, and then became lost in the contemplation of how kissing Draco felt ever so slightly different – but still amazing – in this position.
"You wouldn't be intruding at all," Hermione reassured him. "The thing is, although obviously Harry's the most important person to both of us after each other, for a very long time now we've been a couple plus one, rather than a trio. Harry's never complained, but I know he's felt like a third wheel sometimes. In fact, now that I think about it, that may well be why we stopped spending so much time together. So you'd actually be
"He said that dittany may help to avoid scarring. And it did, to a large extent. Just not completely, hence my ill-advised comment, which I see I was right to censor. Honestly, Harry, the scars are barely visible. You can't even really see them unless you're actually looking for them. They don't bother me at all, and I don't hold a grudge against you for them. I can understand why you used that curse, and I'd forgiven you long before you saved us all. That's why I couldn't give you up at the Manor when Fenrir Greyback brought you in. But you thanked me for that after my trial. And even if you hadn't, you've done far more for me than I've ever done for you, so my barely-visible scars are
Harry insisted on paying for both drinks, so Draco made the most of his treat by having whipped cream on his hot chocolate, which seemed to amuse Harry.
"Both, I guess!" Draco finished his espresso and produced a bottle of water from his bag. "Hang on a sec. I don't often talk for this long in one go. It's not good for my voice, especially after last night." He opened the bottle and started sipping.
"Really," Harry reassured him. "And, in fact, it occurs to me that at least I can still do something about that, even if there are no mittens involved." He took hold of Draco’s right hand and intertwined their fingers. "Is this OK?" he asked, more quietly.
They looked at each other nervously, and then Draco grinned. "Oh, what the hell," he said. "We're going to have to shower and use the toilet together anyway, aren't we? May as well get used to each other's bodies."
Draco's heart couldn't decide whether to melt at this, or to jump out of his chest with excitement. "There's nothing I'd like better," he said, smiling. "Would you feel more comfortable if we kept our clothes on, though? I'm happy either way – it's entirely up to you."
As the final chords sounded, Harry found that he had a tear in his eye, and he wasn't sure why. He'd spent part of the song watching Lucius and Narcissa doing their foxtrot (actually, he had no idea whether or not it was a foxtrot, but it definitely wasn't a waltz, and he'd heard of a ballroom dance called a foxtrot), but mainly he'd watched Draco. Draco had a slight blush on his face, but if he was embarrassed then it didn't show in his voice, which was a lovely rich baritone.
The waterfall was breathtaking in more ways than one; the water thundered down a hundred-foot drop, creating a deafening din as it crashed to the rocks below, and the resultant spray was icy cold.
Harry smiled reassuringly. "Well, you're doing pretty well so far," he confided. "And, like I said, I'll eat anything, so you're fairly safe. Unless, you know, you actually manage to poison me."
"Well, it did," said Harry. "So, thank you again, and let's try not to dwell on it. It's in the past, and it all worked out OK in the end."
By the time he'd reached the park exit, his churros were finished and he did a quick wandless cleaning charm to make his fingers less sticky. He'd been irritated to find that the Apparition point was so far from the gate, but the churros stand that he'd passed had definitely improved his mood.
Within a few minutes, the desks had been formed into a loose rectangle almost as big as the room, and the students were seated around the outside of the rectangle. Harry had suggested that, for safety reasons, it might be a good idea to make it very clear that the students needed to stay well away from the actual duel. The classroom's usual arrangement did have some space behind the desks, of course, where practical activities could take place, but Harry had found, last time he'd taught duelling skills, that he'd needed more room. And that had been before he had an equal opponent.

At this, Draco thought he'd better step forward. "Excuse me," he said. "I know this woman. Her name is Hermione Granger. Forgive me for not saying so earlier; I only arrived just now."

"Sorry about that," said Harry. "I'd've told you if I'd've seen you, but... well, you know how it is."
"That's sweet of you to say, but I think singing might be an exception to that rule," she said, laughing. "You're very quiet, Harry. Are you alright?"
“I’m pretty sure we could milk it for another ten minutes,” she told them, “but the college’s hire period ends at five o’clock, I’m afraid, so I’m going to have to throw you all out. Congratulations, though. I really did thoroughly enjoy it. I might even ask for a copy of the DVD.”
"Harry! How are you feeling?" asked Hermione. "And you, Draco? This must be very weird for you both. It's weird for me, and all I'm doing is sitting on my hands to remind myself not to touch you."
Draco thanked the man (well, if you could call him that; possibly he was slightly older than twelve, but surely no more than fourteen) and settled back into his chair, lost in thought. He was quite startled when he finally returned his gaze to Hermione and found her looking directly at him, with a sort of puzzled awareness.
“Correct - this is already the biggest room, but it’s also the only one with a piano. And you know there are tuning issues involved with moving pianos, so we couldn’t move it in time anyway.”
"I like the way you're thinking," said Harry solemnly. "But I do feel we need to explore all the options first, so we can agree which rewards will work best. For example, I've fucked you, and I can confirm that that reward will work
"I did think about taking them off earlier, but I remembered you said you liked it," Draco reminded him.
"Normally, yes, but the wards won't let you in until I add you, and I can't do that until I'm there," said Draco. "We can Apparate to the gate, though. But it's a bit of a walk from there."
aim, but it's not surprising that it didn't work out, now that I think about it, because of course the aim I was following no longer existed. And I don't think I've found another one."
Harry raised his eyebrows. "Really?" he said. "You want to spend the night in a freezing cold field, with… well, with your nemesis?"
Hermione went over to where he was indicating, and scrabbled around in the drawer. "Oh, here they are. Haha, there are four of them. Four candles!"
"I am very pleased to hear it," said Lucius. "Now, however, it would probably be a good idea if you were to let go of my son for a while." At their puzzled looks, he explained: "Breakfast's ready. You'll eat quicker with both hands."
Harry grinned, his fatigue momentarily forgotten. "Definitely," he said. "Have you got a jumper I can borrow, though? I could use a warming charm, but a jumper’s probably safer."
why the seasons and daylight hours are different in different parts of the world, it still blows my mind every time I come across an actual example of it," commented Harry. "Which is a bit stupid, isn't it?"
"I'm with you, mate," said Ron. "Can't believe I missed out on it for years before you introduced me to it. Nectar of the gods, it is."
Harry gaped. "You thought I was happy when Dumbledore died? Or Sirius? Or Cedric? Or... well, you know how many people died. You really thought I was
Harry blinked. "She... James, I really think you're worrying over nothing here. Your mother's always been a lot more outgoing than me. If she smiles more than I do, it doesn't mean that she's happy and I'm not; it just means that I'm not very good at showing my feelings. Tell you what, though – I'll talk to her about what you've said, and see what she thinks. How's that?"
Draco opened his eyes and stared at Harry for a moment; a blush appeared on his face. "Erm... Well, I wouldn't claim I loved you before yesterday, but... I have to admit I did realise quite a while ago that I fancied you. I never thought for a minute that anything would ever come of it, though, and I would never have dared approach you even if you hadn't been with Ginny. So you just became... well, someone I've daydreamed about from time to time."
Harry took both of Draco's hands in his, as Beth played the intro, and then sang looking directly into his eyes.
Harry looked confused for a moment, before his face cleared and he laughed. "I'll be back soon," he said, and headed for the ward exit.
"Oh, I'll be fine," said Harry. "I've been on Auror stakeouts in much more cramped places. And I'm not sure whether I'll be able to sleep anyway. I do feel much calmer, but I know what my mind's like. As soon as it's not distracted by anything, it'll start coming up with unhelpful thoughts again."
Harry got out of bed and pulled Draco with him. "Get dressed," he said, pulling on his underwear. "We're going to The Burrow."
"I did try a few colours, but white seemed to work best," said Draco. "I've brought them a bottle of Baileys, do you think that will be OK?"
"Thank you, Harry," said Draco, rolling his eyes at him, but smiling as the audience sat down and Harry went to get a chair for the cellist. "Now, obviously the theme for this evening has been love and romance, or music that fits in with that mood. We deliberately haven't included any Christmas music. But, as it
Draco laughed hollowly. "Yes, I've heard of those things," he said. "But no – sadly there hasn't been any of that in quite a few years."
Draco decided that it would be polite to knock before entering Harry's quarters, whether or not Albus was alone in there. The door was flung open instantly, and a slightly-wild-looking Albus pulled Scorpius inside without a word. Draco followed, closing the door behind him. He watched, feeling slightly out of place, as the boys hugged each other tightly. Albus was the one to break the hug; he pulled away slightly, gave Scorpius a quick peck on the lips, then looked at Draco, blushing slightly, with one arm still round Scorpius's shoulders.
Harry grinned. "I knew I could count on you," he said. They left the lift and turned a corner, and found Ron in discussion with several other scarlet-robed Aurors. Ron’s robes clashed horribly with his hair, and Harry suspected Draco must be biting his lip in an effort to refrain from commenting.
As he approached the Science Museum, he reconsidered his usual practice of not using the tube entrance there: he much preferred to walk along the street to the main entrance, rather than through a tunnel, but the tunnel might at least be a bit warmer. There seemed to be something going on, though: there was a small crowd of people at the top of the steps, and an ambulance was parked on the pavement, its flashing blue lights sending eerie shadows across the nearby buildings.
"I've never done that before," Draco admitted, as they lay naked under the stars, getting their breath back.
want, being friends with you would still make me happy. Take as long as you like to decide, and I promise not to put any pressure on you in the meantime, but you can make your decision with the knowledge that I'm not going to be saying no to anything you suggest, unless it's that we never see each other again. Does that help?"
Teddy smiled proudly. "Tell you what," said Harry, "you could send one to Ron and Hermione if you like, just to tell them we're on our way."
When Draco walked out onto the stage and stood in front of the piano, there was much more applause than he’d been expecting. “Probably they’re just glad it’ll be over after me,” he thought to himself as he bowed, slightly blinded by the floodlights.
Harry stared at Ron throughout this speech, increasingly dumbfounded. Ron cocked his head to one side and raised his eyebrows as he finished, with a clear look of "am I right or am I right?"
Harry and Draco followed Ron into the kitchen and sat at the table while Ron busied himself making drinks. "We have made a bit of progress, yes," Harry told him. "Draco’s pretty sure that it’s not an actual magical curse, so it shouldn’t do any harm, but we want to track down that bloke just in case. And I showed Draco the memory, and he thinks he’s seen the bloke before."
"It's OK, really," said Hermione. "I admit I was a bit worried at the thought of being here again, but now I'm here I'm fine. Thank you for thinking of me, though."
"Oh, no, don't worry about that – no-one recognises our name in Italy, especially after all this time. Even when I first moved there I hardly ever encountered anyone who treated me differently."
Draco took Harry's hand and led him to the kitchen, which turned out to be at the end of a small hallway. "Didn't have much choice, when I moved in here," he said as they walked. "Luckily I discovered Muggle takeaways at the same time, otherwise I might have starved. My attempts at cooking did
"You look like a woodland nymph," Draco told her. "I love it. Also, green is a very appropriate choice, for reasons to do with all this magical stuff that we
"OK. I'm dying of curiosity now, mind. But tonight should be fine. Actually, it's good timing, because Hermione's promised to cook a Christmas pudding, and it's a bit too big for just the two of us."
James came up to speak to them, in fact, at the end of the lesson, but Draco was taken aback at his opening question. "Are you two... you know, together?" asked James quietly, even though everyone else had already left the room. "Al said he thought you might be, and he asked Score what he thought, but Score refused to answer, and Al says the only reason he can think of is that he knows it's true. So I've been watching you for the last hour, and the way you both look at each other... well, I think Al's right. Is he?"
Scorpius sat down on the edge of the sofa, which was otherwise piled up with Draco's clothes and books. "I think... Well, there's nothing wrong with his teaching at all. He's actually really good – better than I thought he would be, given that he only started teaching last year. But people behave for him, so he's had it a lot easier than new teachers usually do."
Eek! Very short one tonight, sorry, because I fell asleep and only woke half an hour before the deadline :-)
"That's exactly what I was wondering," said Draco. "Ah, here's the curator at last. Let's get some answers."
"Ah, yes," said Hermione. "And, no. You've sort of done it yourselves already. You've slept together every night for weeks, haven't you? Either here or at Draco's?"
"I did think I hated you, before last year," admitted Harry. "But I don't any more. I saw some of the things you were forced to do, and how you hated doing them, and that made me realise that you weren't like I thought. Before, I'd always assumed that you

“No, especially not on Christmas Eve for a non-Christmas programme, but it looks like we were wrong. And it’s mostly people I’ve never seen before, and some of them are dressed quite strangely. But I’m pretty sure most of them are here to see Draco, from the bits of conversation I’ve overheard. He tells me you did some publicising? Well, whatever it was, it worked!”
"Hmm, I see what you mean," said Harry. "And I don't suppose our history helps, when all we've ever done is react badly to each other. But I really do want to move forward rather than keep looking back. That's one of the reasons I offered to room with you. I know we probably won't trust each other immediately, but I promise you I'll try, and if you can too then we'll be fine. And if people can see that
"It's an amazing sight, but I think it looks out of place in this square," said Draco. "The cathedral is really impressive on its own, but I think the square would actually be more impressive with it. I mean, that bit over there is the Kremlin, and that's got some unusually shiny bits, but it somehow fits in. And that brick thing is Lenin's tomb."
So Harry had been disappointed that he wouldn't be spending the afternoon snuggling with Draco in the cinema, and had slumped in front of the TV, until Draco suggested he could go out for a walk ("while you still can, before it starts to snow - the temperature's just right today"). Harry had grumbled but couldn't think of a good enough reason not to, and now he was glad he'd done it. He'd got the tube to Charing Cross and wandered over to Trafalgar Square - he liked the idea of seeing Nelson's statue before seeing the film set in his lifetime - before crossing the river to the South Bank Centre, and then wandering along the aforementioned south bank of the river, past the London Eye towards Westminster Bridge.
"OK," said Harry. "And what's the order? Are you last? I hope you're last. There's not going to be anyone better than you, after all."
Late that night, Draco and Harry were both sprawled across Harry's four-poster bed at Hogwarts, naked and breathless. "That was..." panted Draco.
"Hello, Harry," said Ginny cheerfully, breezing into the garden only ten minutes late. "And Draco, of course."
"Anyway, listen," said Harry, making an impulsive decision. "I need to talk to you – well, both of you, I suppose – about something serious. I've kind of wanted to for a while, but the moment never seemed to be quite right. But talking to Draco made me realise that it's kind of important. Not here, though. Are you home tonight?"
. Ginny never did that, and it seemed like such a silly thing for me to want that I never asked her. We just got into a routine where she'd always lie down with her back to me and I'd spoon up to her. And then, of course, we eventually stopped going to bed at the same time, and although we still slept in the same bed we'd stay on separate sides."
"I never did the exam, did I?" Harry pointed out. "My birthday's after the end of the summer term, and I never went back to school after I was seventeen."
Draco suddenly felt unaccountably nervous about continuing the conversation. "Did you know that in America they rack their brain rather than their brains?" he offered, as a distraction. "It always amuses me that they obviously only have half the brains we do."
"I think it's possible to see even more from here, but not till we're out of twilight," said Harry. "In the meantime, please remind me where Draco is. I can never remember."
Draco went to look. "Custard!" he exclaimed in delight, bringing the packet back outside. "Perfect. Do we have bowls and spoons?"
"They're good people," said Harry. "I know that your family and theirs never got on, but things are different now, aren't they? I suspect that when the Weasleys first heard about us, they will have been a bit taken aback, and maybe not very happy. But I know them well enough to say that they'll give you the benefit of the doubt. They'll respect the fact that you're the first person I've ever felt strongly enough about to take there, and the fact that Ron will have told them he supports us will have helped a lot. So they'll be polite at first, while they make their own minds up. And as soon as they get to know you they'll be your biggest fans, I guarantee it."
Harry had intended to tell Ron and Hermione about what he'd seen – they would certainly understand what a big deal it was, after all – but by the time he finally reached their house he realised that he wanted to process it internally for a while longer before he shared it with them. They knew him too well not to notice that something had happened, of course, but they didn't push him for an immediate explanation, letting him off with a promise that he would tell them when he was ready. He decided that the least he could do in return was not to inflict his stench on them while they were eating, so he jumped into the shower after all, while they were finishing things in the kitchen.
"But all the other songs were brilliant too," said Harry. "Was the choice entirely up to you, or were some of them compulsory?"
"There are still bits of him in me," said Draco. "But yes, it's a very nice dream. Here, shall we sit down?"
"He was a bit of a star, actually," said Draco. "He asked some very good questions, including one I'd never even thought about before."
Harry's jaw dropped open, but then he remembered the last time he'd talked to any of his colleagues. "Padma told you," he said.
"I’m sure," said Harry. "Well, apart from being blinded by the amount of sparkly stuff in this room." They were in Hermione’s office in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, on the floor above Harry’s. The office was decorated to within an inch of its life, with tinsel and baubles in every nook and cranny, paper chains festooned across the ceiling, and a huge Christmas tree by the door.
"You mean to say you weren't sufficiently entertained by Harry's snowman?" demanded Ron, reappearing with the drinks.
convinced he wasn't imagining things. Of course, this strategy did imply that further information-gathering would be needed, and an overnight stargazing session would be the perfect opportunity for that.
"I know it sounds silly," said Harry. "It's much easier now, don't worry. But in those days I wasn't used to being with families. I don't think Teddy's like that – he's grown up spending lots of time with the Weasleys, after all – but it won't do any harm to ease him in gently."
"You're right, though – we should have tried," said Lucius. "I hope you'll let us make up for it now."
"Only because I had you to grab hold of each time I wobbled," Harry reminded him. "So, thank you! Now, I know you're as keen as me to get back to my quarters so we can continue the, er, conversation we had to postpone the other night - at least I hope so! - but I do have a bit of a surprise for you first."
"You'll have to call me Professor Malfoy for the next two weeks, you know... in public, anyway. I take it Potter's kids all call him Professor Potter in lessons?"
desperate for company. But I would really like to see you. So, erm, tell me if you don't want to, and I won't bother you again. Or if you're not free now but you'd like to fix a time, just tell me when. But if you want to come now, that'd be great. Are you on the Floo Network? Just say 'Harry Potter's quarters, Hogwarts' and you'll find me. I've unlocked my fireplace for you. Or if you don't do Floo, send a message with my friend here."
"Well, OK." Harry took a deep breath. "You might have noticed that I haven't been around much this week, apart from during lessons?"
"A bit of both," said Harry. "What shocked me even more than finding out she'd been unfaithful – and that she didn't seem to think there was anything wrong with that – was when I realised that she was obviously still intending to go on the trip almost immediately. To me, it was obvious that our marriage was over and we needed to talk about how we were going to proceed, and then we needed to tell the kids as soon as possible. But she said that she couldn't see why anything needs to change at all – why can't we go on as we have been, living more or less separate lives but still being perfect parents? I pointed out that to me

"You see what we have to put up with, Draco?" said Hermione, still with the fond but exasperated smile on her face.
many people at once," Draco added. "It's only fair to tell you that I doubt any other wizard in the world could do what Professor Potter just did.
“Well, alright… but promise me you’ll say no if it’s a problem?” At Draco’s nod, Molly continued: “I know you haven’t practised for a few days, but… please could you sing a song for us?”
"And the worst part is the insomnia, isn't it?" said Draco. "I always try and go to bed early on a Sunday night because I know I'm always so tired on a Monday morning, but it never works – I just lie there for hours with things spinning round in my head."
Harry buried his head in Draco's hair, embarrassed but proud. "That reminds me," he said, after a minute. "I've had an idea, and I'm really pleased with it, but I need to know what you think. Promise you'll tell me if you think it's stupid?"
the story of what Draco's doing these days. But... have you thought about what you'd do if you did quit?"
Two hours later, they'd investigated all the market stalls (stopping a couple of times for more food and drink), and were ready to go home. The rain had stopped, but it had been bucketing down for long enough that they were both fairly soaked, and were annoyed with themselves for not thinking to do an Impervius Charm until it was too late.
Ginny's face reddened. "Sorry," she said. "I forgot about that part of it for a moment. And here's me thinking I couldn't possibly do any more stupid things today. Anyway, I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am that this has happened. I know you'll be with Draco all the time for the foreseeable future, but maybe after the bond has settled you and I can spend some time together?"
of the fact that we just both came together, although that's a bonus, but I've just realised that I haven't said this out loud yet: I love you. And I wanted you to know."
Draco smiled at him in relief, glad to get back to what they'd been talking about. "True," he said. "And, much as it pains me to admit it, I think you're going to have to tell us."
In an invisible house on the other side of London, Spike suddenly lifted his head to stare urgently in a random direction, in that way that cats do. Then he curled up again and went back to sleep, apparently satisfied.
my feelings too, if that's the case," Draco said. "Because I feel as if I've been happy almost all the time, since you've been here. But I suppose I do try to be more expressive when I'm performing."
Intrigued, Harry examined the phone box. The door wouldn't open, suggesting that it wasn't a normal phone box; he couldn't tell whether or not the snowman was real (it
"I had no idea," said Harry. "I'm very flattered. I don't think I've ever been anyone's secret love before."
Draco looked at Harry, who shrugged and nodded. Again he felt the rush of relief from Draco deep inside his chest. "Yes, he is," called Draco. "Goodnight, Father. Goodnight, Mother."
"Your hoodie. Give it to me," said Draco. "Have I got the word right? That's what you call that red thing you've got on, isn't it?"
I am, actually. I've fancied both girls and boys, but I've never actually done anything beyond kissing with either. But I definitely fancy
As the sun set that day, Draco was standing at the window of his penthouse flat near Hyde Park Corner with a cup of coffee, staring at the sky and lost in thought. Ironically, having made such a fuss about Harry getting some sleep, he himself had tossed and turned all night, unable to settle. It was fairly obvious to him that the cause of this insomnia was his encounter with Harry, so he tried not to think about the man, but his mind kept drifting back to that oh-so-familiar face.
Harry laughed. "Bugger! Of course there was," he said. "Good job one of us was paying attention. Won't be a sec." He ran out of the room.
Draco laughed. "I'll let you into a secret," he said. "Ron and Hermione weren't here the whole time. When you got back, they'd only just popped in to see if I'd seen you. And if they'd turned up ten minutes earlier, they would have found me wanking in the bathroom, because wearing your hoodie was a huge turn-on and I couldn't hold it in any longer. So I can wait a bit before I... you know."
Harry looked at Draco, who appeared to be speechless, but was nodding. "That sounds brilliant," said Harry. "It's very generous indeed. Thank you. Why
"Thanks, Dad!" said Scorpius. "I won't be a minute." He vanished into the bedroom, leaving Draco to start unshrinking his baggage.
"You know, the thought hadn't even occurred to me," said Ron, looking surprised. "I didn't even realise Hermione liked Merlin until a few weeks ago, and she's been talking about the finale all week, whereas I know it's been your main interest in the last few years, so you must be a bit overwhelmed right now, mustn't you? Actually, we both know I

be 'hospital canteens', but apparently it isn't," he said. "Failing that, I suppose airports and stations are the next best options. Shall we wander over to Euston and see what we can find? St Pancras is probably more likely to have stuff open, but Euston's nearer. If there's nothing at either, though, I'm going home, sorry. I'm not sure I can stay awake long enough to go out to Heathrow."
Draco tried to keep his eyes open so that he could look around the room and memorise it in case he never got the chance to be in it again; he had no reason to disbelieve Harry when he said it wasn't a one-off, but Draco's lack of self-esteem caused him to be wary.
a few kids in that group that always seem to be challenging me with their eyes, but they've never done anything I could pull them up on."
"Oh, I can guess that one," Harry told him. "It probably went something like… Teddy saw Ron last night and mentioned that I was with you; Ron spent all night building himself up to an argument; Ron woke Teddy at the crack of dawn to make him show the way to the campsite; Teddy went home and went straight back to bed. Am I right?"
"Do you know The Christmas Song?" asked Harry eventually, causing Draco to peer at him in confusion. "You know,
been thinking about that, please will you tell me straight away, so I don't get my hopes up? Anyway, got to go. Bye."
"No, no, not at all," said Harry. "He's staying here too, and everyone knows he's here, so he can go to the hall for meals. In fact, he'll have to, because people will wonder where he is if he doesn't. But please could you bring both of us some food right now?"
enjoyed the concert, mostly, but apparently nowhere near as much as most of the rest of the audience, judging by the rapturous conversations going on around him. The fact that they seemed to have
So much for good intentions… All the trains through Lancaster were delayed when I tried to get home on Thursday night, and the journey took four hours, and by the time I got home I was too tired to do anything, and the last few days have been too busy for me to catch up! This part’s a bit longer, and I hope to have time to do a couple more tomorrow. (I haven’t looked at any of the prompts for days 13-16, because I want to try and do this properly even though I’ve already failed the actual challenge.)
"Of course I am," said Draco. "I can’t promise it’ll work, but it can’t hurt to try. How do you suggest we do it?"
don't want to do this again... well, I never expected you to want to do it in the first place, so I'd cope. I'd be heartbroken, but I'd cope."
Harry considered this. "You know what? I don't think that matters as much as you might think. At least not today. I know everyone at this table, because they were all on the platform in Sydney the other week, and I think they were all at the previous one as well. But you're new to this, and that makes you automatically interesting. Look at the audience - most of them aren't listening to Kingsley at all. That guy on the front row is definitely staring at the fairy lights, isn't he?"
Draco nodded, and prepared himself for more hand-holding, but Harry surprised him again by enveloping him in a hug.
"No need to apologise – I've had an hour longer than you to get used to the idea," said Draco. "Of course we can go to the Burrow. I'm not sure how pleased Ginny will be to see me, though."
"Hmm," said Harry. "I suppose. It just seems... well, a pity. But you're right, it doesn't actually make
Draco smiled. "The next press conference is by the Thames in front of the London Eye next week, correct?" Harry nodded. "And," Draco went on, "when that was arranged, which part of the plan do you think they did first?"
After a moment's total silence, the audience erupted, and within seconds they were all on their feet clamouring for more.
. Her huge eyes opened even further when she saw Harry. "Harry Potter, sir!" she squeaked. "You is supposed to be on holiday!"
"Nope," said Harry. "He said they've asked the management whether they can get some, because American tourists are always asking for them, but there are no plans to stock them. Oh well. I'll have to buy some and experiment."
"Damn, indeed," said Harry. He sighed. "If this was a one-off, I might suggest we try without. But I want it to be perfect."
us together, mind you. They didn't actually say that when I told them, but the raised eyebrows definitely gave me that impression."
"That's part of what we want to talk to you about," said Granger. "Do you mind if we come back to it in a minute? It's just that the cat's an important part of the story too, you see."
"Yeah, can't be far off zero," agreed Harry. "And it was blue! I know the Geminids are supposed to have a few different colours, but we've only seen white and yellow ones so far this week."
Draco and Harry had spent most of the rest of Saturday ambling round the grounds, after Harry realised how much he'd missed fresh air; they'd then spent the whole of Sunday planning their curriculum for the week, and had even had a few practice duels, all of which had ended in fits of giggles. They'd still been laughing when they'd finally fallen into bed, but they'd quickly been distracted by each other's nakedness. Draco had considered mentioning how much he was desperate to fuck Harry, or be fucked by him – either would be fine – but he knew that Harry would mention it himself when he was ready. In the meantime, he was still happier than he'd ever been.

Draco tightened his hug. "Let it all out," he murmured into Harry's hair. "I'm here, and I'm not going anywhere." Harry didn't say anything, but Draco felt the man's body shaking with quiet sobs. He began rubbing reassuring circles with the hand he had on Harry's back.
Harry and Draco looked at Ron, surprised; Ron shrugged. "Hey, if the cap fits," he said. "At first I was mainly impressed because you were such a total git at school, so I was surprised when you just behaved like everyone else and didn't react when people tried to wind you up. But gradually I realised you were actually a really good Auror. Definitely better than me, I have to admit. I think that, with you two being partners now, the criminals had better watch out."
"It's a date," said Harry, and with one last kiss he stepped into the Floo, leaving Draco lying on the sofa with a soppy grin on his face.
"Well, don't worry, there's plenty of food, although we did go ahead and eat ours without you," said Narcissa. She opened a door leading off the hallway, and ushered Draco into a room which appeared to be the kitchen. Lucius was seated at the table, but he stood up to shake hands with Draco.
in years and my body's just getting carried away with the excitement of it and I'd have reacted the same way to
mentioned Harry's involvement with this, which meant that he'd been able to gaze around the hall to see people's reactions while their attention was still fixed on the Headteacher. He'd noticed that the Slytherin table, which was much sparser than the other three, had seemed a little worried, but mostly as excited as the others... with one exception. Malfoy, who was the only returning Slytherin eighth-year, had been sitting slightly apart from his housemates, looking uncomfortable and not speaking unless spoken to; when the news about the common rooms had been revealed, he'd raised his eyebrows but had otherwise seemed unmoved.
"As I'll ever be," said Draco. "Let me just get my bag. You do know those colours don't really go together, by the way?"
trouble at first then you've got somewhere to escape to. I think Ron's right, though – it won't be as bad as you think, and it won't last long."
– and I'm quite independent these days. And I have to say I'm a bit disappointed you don't see that."
"The main thing that's occurring to me right now is that I'm really impressed that you're doing this at all, but I suspect that'll be ongoing, so just take it as read," said Harry, smiling. "In the meantime, the most important things about camping are to keep dry and warm, to be comfortable, and to eat and drink all the time. So sling that bag into the tent, put an extra jumper on, and bring the chairs out. We may as well have some of that cake, mightn't we? And how about hot chocolate?"

Draco blushed. "Is there anything I can do to help with dinner?" he asked, keen to change the subject.
The song had begun quietly, but when Draco got to the last verse he suddenly flung his arms out and sang at the top of his voice.
Now, at home for the first time in almost two weeks, Harry felt oddly out of place. It was rare for him to be at home during termtime: he usually slept at Hogwarts. He and Ginny hadn't done anything more than
"Well, I've totally got my head round the fact that people in America have just gone to bed when I get up, and so on," Draco explained. "I can cope with time zones that are
He took his iPhone out of his pocket and came and stood next to Harry. "I should warn you that I've never yet managed to take an adequate picture of myself with this," he said. "I think you'd need double-length arms for it to actually work. But it's better than nothing." He draped his arm round Harry's shoulders, inwardly applauding himself for his bravery, and held his phone away from them to take the photo.
Draco had gone slightly pink. "Can we just go back to 'you're grateful for ME', please? Why on earth would you be?"
seeing other people. And then, when we've done all our socialising, we'll come back here and shag like bunnies under the stars."
"Actually, Professor, I've been thinking about the common rooms this summer," said Harry. Ron and Hermione looked at him in surprise. "I actually almost got in touch with you to make a suggestion," Harry continued, "but it felt as if it might have been a bit arrogant, and I've been accused of arrogance a few too many times lately." Hermione smiled sadly at him at this, and Ron patted him on the shoulder soothingly.
"I'm sorry," Harry said, when the weeping seemed to be subsiding. "But you did suspect that would happen, didn't you?"
"Did you talk about telling them?" asked Draco, stifling another yawn. "I'm so sorry, I'm not bored, I just can't stop yawning. I'm going to have to go to sleep in a minute."
"Listen, everyone, you're clapping the wrong person," insisted Harry, as the applause died down. "There's no way I'm letting you go without hearing a

approve," said Draco, relenting. "It's well known that you and I didn't get on at school. In any case, you don't see Andromeda and Teddy that often yourself, do you?"
Half an hour later, Harry decided that he was in heaven. He was on his settee in front of a cosy fireplace. Christmas songs were playing quietly on the radio. Draco was snuggled up beside him with his head on Harry's shoulder and Harry's arm holding him close. With his other hand, Harry was running his fingers through Draco's amazingly soft hair (something he'd been secretly dying to do since the age of eleven). The fish and chips had been eaten and the wrappings disposed of. Harry had considered having a shower to get rid of the perennial smell of grease and cooking oil, but he didn't want to leave Draco, and although he allowed himself to daydream for a moment about possible future shared showers, he didn't want to rush things. In any case, there was lots of snuggling he wanted to do first.
Harry hugged him as they walked into the ballroom. "As long as you are happy, that's all that matters," he said.
"You're right, of course," said Harry. "Thank you for thinking of that. Now, what time did I tell the kids to come up? I forget."
"What are your plans for tomorrow?" asked Harry eventually, speaking barely above a murmur in order not to break the mood.
"Lotus Cottage," said Harry, flinging a handful of Floo powder into the fire. They both stepped through, and emerged in a small but cosy-looking room. There were bookcases on all four walls, and a Christmas tree in the corner with a pile of presents underneath.
to them both, and I've hardly seen them at all," commented Draco. "Not deliberately; it's just that, since my parents don't have many visitors, they try to spread them out rather than have them all there together and then none for ages. It's a couple of years since I've actually seen them, but my parents tell me how they're getting on."
It turned out that Draco was almost certainly correct in both his diagnosis and his prognosis, which made Harry feel both proud and sad. The Healer explained that the physical tests she'd done were mainly to rule out any other possibilities, and that a brain scan would be needed to confirm Alzheimer's, but that could only be done at the hospital, and Draco would have to decide whether or not it was worth the upset that would cause. The Healer said that everything she was seeing, and everything Draco had reported, was in keeping with early-onset Alzheimer's, and she agreed that it had probably been caused by a spell or a curse, but that made no difference at this stage. She told them that she'd return when she had the test results, but in the meantime Draco was doing all the right things already.
This did appear to be true: a few people were still standing and staring at them, but they seemed excited rather than hostile, and the majority of the shoppers had already lost interest and were going about their business again.
"Sorry about that," he said. "You'd think I'd have got used to it after all these years, but my landing's always wobbly, even when I have someone I'm comfortable holding onto properly. If I'm only holding an arm, I usually fall over. It's kind of embarrassing, actually."
"Draco, we're going up to bed now," called Lucius. "We will see you in the morning. Is your friend staying the night?"
"He really seems to enjoy it, though," said Hermione. "I was quite surprised. Now, listen, I was just thinking. If we walk in with you, it'll really distract Harry, and he doesn't finish work for another half an hour, so he wouldn't be able to talk till then. So I've got an idea. How about if we Disillusion you, and you can follow us in to see how things work, and then you can go in on your own afterwards, and hopefully talk to him then?"
Several hours later, Harry was lounging on his sofa watching Teddy, who was sprawled on the carpet drawing, with extreme concentration. Harry had suggested that his godson might like to make a Christmas card for Andromeda, and this idea proved to be an unexpected hit, although Teddy's choice of appropriate images for Christmas was a little unusual: he'd started with a dinosaur, and was now surrounding it with what appeared to be house-elves, although there
, at least in any gay club I've been in so far. It was just a bizarre image that came into my head. Rest assured I'll be examining my subconscious later to work out why. But in the meantime I should probably clarify that I am also gay. ... And, I asked you to call me Harry."
They followed her into the kitchen, where Lucius was surrounded by all manner of bowls, plates, tins and cooking ingredients. "I'm making biscuits!" he told them cheerfully. "Clear a space on the table and I'll get your coffee. Are you hungry? Do you want some lunch?"
you want to do? And, before you say it, I do understand that you've already saved the world and would be quite relieved not to have to do anything like
"It's important to me that they... well, that they don't hate me, if I'm being entirely accurate. I know you said they don't, but it still seems quite unlikely."
"Thank you so much," he said eventually, when the reaction died down a bit. "That song was an example of opera, which isn't very well-known in the Wizarding World as yet, so I'm hoping to gradually change that. But that's not the only type of music I sing - there are lots of other genres in classical music as well as opera, and then there's musical theatre and pop and folk and... well, lots of others. But the second song I'm going to sing you is what's known as a jazz standard - it's an old song that would have been considered a pop song when it came out, but that was a long time ago and it's remained popular for decades, so now it's just an old favourite. It's called
"Well, when you put it like that, I suppose I'd better just bask in the glory of my accomplishments," said Draco, rolling onto his back again and pulling Harry on top of him. This caused Harry to kiss him thoroughly, and it was several minutes before he added, "or I could demand payment, of course. But I'm doing OK financially at the moment. So maybe I should request a service instead. Use of your body, for example? That seems appropriate."
Harry turned onto the bridge, singing along with Debbie Harry when it got to "picture this, a day in December; picture this, freezing cold weather" (he found he didn't know any of the other words, so had to settle for a da-da-da approach), but when he got to the middle of the bridge he stopped suddenly. There was an old-fashioned red phone box which he didn't remember being there the last time he'd been this way, and - even more surprisingly - there seemed to be a snowman inside it.
"It's years since I've seen Mercury, you know," said Harry. "Even when I know it's supposed to be there, I never manage to see it. Either the sky's too cloudy, or there's too much light pollution, or there are buildings on the horizon."
Draco considered this for a moment. "Well, there is one song that's been stuck in my head for the last few hours," he admitted. "Some of the words are very appropriate. Some more than others, though, so don't take it
hard to memorise, so if the conductor hadn't warned the soloists in advance that they were singing it, he definitely wouldn't expect them to sing it without their scores... but Draco already knew it from memory, because he learned it last year, so it gave him an unexpected chance to show off."
Harry was looking as baffled as Ron. "Not that I'm not grateful, but I'd love to know what I'm grateful
"Time for your obs, Hermione," said the nurse, bustling over. "Ah, Draco, I see you managed to contact her family. Thank you for that. You

"I did point that out to her, but she was insistent," Draco told him. "With it being pop, backing tracks would probably have been better, but the organisers wanted live musicians only, and when Rabia found out she said she didn't want anyone else accompanying me, she wants to keep me for herself, bless her. So the deal is that she'll go first, so that at least there'll be a bit of a break for her; there's another pianist who's accompanying the flute and cello, and then I'm last."
It had been Ginny herself who had, unknowingly, given Harry an idea about how he could do something to improve their relationship. It was the last Friday in August, and the whole family had been eating fish and chips and talking about going back to Hogwarts on the Sunday.
"Well, she's not wrong. Not strictly," said Ginny. "The bonding spell can't be reversed, as far as I know. But it turns out there's another spell that can help. It masks the
The following afternoon, Draco was sitting at the kitchen table, lost in thought. His father was reading in the living room, and his mother had gone upstairs for a nap. Draco had been shopping and now had a rucksack full of camping gear, which was propped up in the corner of the kitchen: along with a sleeping bag, blankets, pillow and torch, this contained mainly clothes, but there was also a selection of cakes donated by Lucius, who had said "well, if you don't eat them you can always bring them back, can't you?"
Harry looked at him, aghast, and replayed the conversation in his mind. "You're absolutely right," he said, when he'd done so. "I'm an idiot, and I'm so sorry. Of course I can see you've changed – I doubt I'd be here right now if you hadn't. But I guess now you can see why I'm single. I always seem to do this – every time I make a connection with someone, I say something stupid and they run away."
"It's my pleasure," Draco assured him. "But I'll feel better when some actual tangible progress has been made. I wasn't entirely happy with how things were left; there was no definite outcome or action points, he just said to leave it with him."
Hermione smiled and took it from him, shaking his hand and kissing him on the cheek. "Good choice," she commented. "Can't go wrong with Baileys. Thank you. Do you want to come through? Ron's just finishing off the cooking."
"We figured that if they saw the real you coming back in, it wouldn't be the end of the world because at least you'd have escaped for a while," said Hermione. "But if they didn't see you at all, that's even better – it means we can do it again!"
"Well, I'm sure she'll be grateful when she comes round," said the doctor. "I'll be back to see her later, and the nurses will check on her every fifteen minutes, so don't feel that you need to stay all night. It'd help her if someone was with her as much as possible, though."
"Hermione squealed and came through the Floo to fling her arms round me. Ron teased me for at least ten minutes, but when he'd got it out of his system he shook my hand and said 'it's about time'."
"My mind is boggled right now," Harry told him. "Why have I never wondered that before? But never mind that. Talking of bulges, am I allowed to say that I can't help noticing the one between your legs?"
would probably be very worried indeed, especially as they already know that you were planning to spend two weeks with your wife. So I think it would be best if you were to stay in your quarters and not tell anyone you've returned, at least until you're feeling a bit better. In the meantime, I've been employed to do your job, and I
the questions were 'Where's Harry?'" said Ginny. "And they call themselves sports reporters! It was pathetic. But then they're always like that, so I wasn't really too surprised. Still disappointing, though."
He decided that the best thing to do would be to continue being polite and friendly, and not to assume anything more was going on until he was
There was a silence in which they all gaped at him, and then Professor McGonagall smiled fondly at them as her ex-students all bellowed "WE'RE GOING DOWN THE PUB!"
"I'm sorry about that," said Harry, resting his chin on Draco's chest so he could meet his gaze. "I think I was just freaked out at the idea of people knowing before I'd thought about how to tell them. I've got a bit paranoid about that over the years; people do seem to insist on talking about me, but it's been a bit easier to deal with since I started pre-empting anything I knew there'd be rumours about, by making announcements myself."
"Like you, at the time I couldn't see any alternative," Harry interrupted. "I used it on a Death Eater and a goblin, both at Gringotts. I don't think we'd have got out of there alive if I hadn't done it."
After a few minutes, Ron seemed to deflate, and the two of them walked back to Draco. Harry looked expectantly at Ron.
"The ones that know me will, and I don't care what the others think. And if they give you a hard time about it, they'll have to get through me," said Harry firmly.
"Well, I do," said Harry firmly. "Ask Ron if you don't believe me. He not only worked out that I was planning to offer to share with you, he also told me that the main reason was that I've always been fascinated with you. And he was right, even though I hadn't even realised that
I could do the job, if they'd only let me. So... Please don't hate me. I asked to speak to the station manager, and I I
"I look forward to the spectacle," said the Headmistress drily. "However, before you out yourselves, I have some news for you. Horace Slughorn has just informed me that he will be retiring at Christmas. It seems that his sight has been deteriorating for several years, and he has finally decided that it is bad enough now that it is a danger to his work. I will therefore have a vacancy for a Potions professor in January and, Draco, the job is yours if you want it."
"You know, I'm relieved you're here," said Harry. "Last night felt a bit like a dream by the time I woke up. I did briefly wonder whether I'd imagined the whole thing."
By the time Harry appeared, Draco was lying on his bed cuddling Kilgharrah, who was basking in the attention. Draco looked up at Harry. "It seems weird to see you with clothes on," he commented, grinning.
Padma tilted her head to one side to peer at him. "That sounds... unusual. People aren't usually very good at making you do things like that, I've noticed. Who.... oh, wait, I know. It was Draco Malfoy, wasn't it?"
Harry was still trying to process this information. "So you’re a Manchester United fan? How did that come about?"
He took Draco's hand, and they continued to wander past the market stalls, comfortable with their silence.
handy, but it gets me in trouble with my assistants," admitted Hermione. "They’re always telling me that I waste my time doing things that I should be getting
for not pushing me to talk about it earlier," said Harry. "I think that's what made me feel comfortable about trusting you now. I do have one request, though. Can you call me Harry, please? When you call me Potter I feel like a schoolboy, and we're different people now."
Draco's last note was a very long melisma, meandering around the lush piano chords as the flute and cello played separate bits of melody. As all the instruments converged and held a chord with Draco, Harry (still holding Draco's hand) stepped forward slightly and repeated his initial stage-whisper.
Draco held the last note, allowing its sound to spin through the air as Rabia played the final chords. He stood motionless until the piano's sound died away completely, and then lowered his head. There was total silence for a few seconds, and then Harry started to clap (Draco, his eyes closed, was amused to realise could even identify by his clapping these days), soon to be joined by the rest of the audience.
"The thing is... Ginny asked me to investigate whether or not it was true that the bond couldn't be broken. And I felt uncomfortable, because I'd already started doing some research, but that was partly in case you asked me, and mainly because of my own curiosity. Anyway, I'm fairly confident about my conclusion, but it didn't feel right telling Ginny before I told
"Great," muttered Harry to himself; he knew Ron was correct. Ginny was the perfect girlfriend when it was just her and Harry, but she did seem to delight in pointing out his flaws whenever she had an audience. At first he had tried to argue, but he'd soon realised that she had to have the last word, so he found it saved a lot of time if he just grinned and accepted her accusations. It didn't mean he had to
Draco kissed him, and then sat back and looked at him. "I can't believe I'm here," he admitted. "Thank you."
Eventually Harry stopped giggling and sat up, still smiling. The towel twisted a little further with his movement, and Draco was unable to stop himself from licking his lips.
, and I have a distinct memory of telling your Patronus that I'd be here in five minutes, more than five minutes ago," Draco pointed out.
I wonder whether any of you are thinking that the premise of this story feels familiar, but you can't quite put your finger on why? I think now is a good time to explain (and also the title will make a bit more sense!)
The other reason for this confession is to warn you that I have far less idea what will happen after this point!
"It might be a while before we realise," said Harry, "because I find I like touching you. I suspect I will want to keep doing it."
of admiring comments from people tonight when they saw who I was with. And none of them knew you as anyone other than my boyfriend, so you can't even chalk it up to hero worship like you usually do."
He and Draco hadn't talked after their kiss; they'd stared into each other's eyes for a few moments, both smiling, and reached an unspoken understanding. At least, Harry thought they had; he'd find out soon enough, he supposed, thinking about it now. At the time, he'd just said to Draco "I'll owl you" and then walked away after a final quick postscript-type kiss, leaving Draco to speak to his crowd of admirers.
it was to go to a Muggle destination, so I was able to concentrate. I spent a few weeks getting used to just being there: I'd just go through the gateway in the Leaky Cauldron into Charing Cross Road, and then spend all day just wandering and observing. I changed lots of my money into Muggle money at Gringotts, and after a while I got brave enough to spend it. The first thing I bought was a cup of coffee from a vending machine – it was disgusting, but I felt safer interacting with a machine before I tried it with a human. I was so proud of myself that I immediately went and bought a better cup of coffee from a street stall, and
Harry stared at him for a moment, and then burst out laughing. "Fair point, well made," he said. "Although I'd love to actually see you using it. I still can't quite imagine it. I take it you use the insulo charm to get it to work?"
Draco grinned. "Thank you," he said. "I like the sound of that. In fact, maybe that could be Harry's first task in his new role! Now, why don't you both come back to the cottage for a bite to eat, so that we can talk about all this with him?"
"Well, I only told the truth, but if it helped then I'm glad," said Harry. "I'm worried about you now, though. I don't like the idea of you being on your own all the time. Surely people must have tried to chat you up? What do you do when that happens?"
drinking, so it doesn't affect me as much as other booze does. And I wanted to keep a clear head for my last night with you."
"Oh, good grief, yes," said Hermione, without batting an eyelid at Ron – Ron Weasley! – reeling off such a list and pronouncing all the Russian names like a native speaker.
"Did you know," he said, slightly more loudly than strictly necessary, "that I told Draco yesterday that I have no-one to talk to?"
Hermione's face didn't change very much at this, but it was enough for Draco to panic, wondering what had upset her. The answer, however, was provided by Ron Weasley, who'd walked into the ward while Draco was speaking.
Hermione produced a pink envelope that would have looked like a Howler if it was red, and waved her wand at it. "I JUST WANTED TO SAY," came Molly Weasley's voice, filling the entire hall, "THAT I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HEAR A BETTER SINGER THAN CELESTINA WARBECK, BUT THAT WAS BEFORE I HEARD DRACO MALFOY. THAT MAN HAS THE VOICE OF AN ANGEL, I TELL YOU. THE FIRST DAY I HEARD HIM, IT WAS WINTER OUTSIDE, AND I THINK HIS VOICE MADE ALL THE ICE MELT FROM THE TREES, AND HE MELTED MY AGED HEART AT THE SAME TIME, WHY, HE..."
Harry wasn't at all sure that this could be entirely true, but decided to take her at her word. "Well, the thing is... I love the history of the Houses, and the idea that they all have their own characteristics, and even the rivalry – Quidditch would have been rubbish without that, wouldn't it? But I also think that some of the issues that came to light during the war were exacerbated by the fact that the Houses didn't mix much socially, so I was wondering if you might consider removing some of the segregation. Like, you know, allowing everyone to use any of the four common rooms. You could still keep the sleeping areas private if you wanted to, and of course each House would still be responsible for what goes on in their own common room. But I think it'd be really helpful if everyone felt they'd be welcome anywhere. Otherwise, I can't see how things will move forward, and I'm a bit worried about the Slytherins in particular. I think they'll be shunned, and that'll only make things even worse. I'm not saying that if you make this change then everything will instantly be fine, but I think it'd help." His face was hot with embarrassment by the time he finished speaking, but he forced himself to maintain eye contact with McGonagall, whose face had remained as impassive as usual throughout his speech.
"I think there are probably people who fancy you who'd surprise you," said Draco. "But I don't want to freak you out, so I won't speculate. Are you sure you want another song? I thought you'd be sick of them by now."
and was written by a Muggle composer called Puccini. It's fairly well-known among Muggles, so those of you who are Muggle-born may well have heard it before. It's in Italian, but the title means "None Shall Sleep". In the opera that it's from, it's sung by a prince who falls in love with a princess, and she will only marry someone who can answer some riddles that she's set. He answers all of them, but she still doesn't want to marry him, so he sets a riddle of his own, which is to guess his name before dawn - if she can't, she has to marry him. She decrees that none of her subjects are allowed to sleep until someone finds out his name, and she'll kill them all if they don't. For some reason he still wants to marry her despite this, and that's when he sings this song."
"You don't owe me anything," Draco told him. "I enjoyed that just as much as you did. But I'm not going to object if you want to get competitive about it. Either way, you should get in the sleeping bag before you freeze to death."
"I must admit, I always wondered how he did that," Harry mused, while he manoeuvred Draco's jumper over his head. "I mean, superspeed wouldn't help much in such a small space. Plus, what did he do with the clothes he was wearing before?"
The teenager, who had been watching the exchange with interest, looked at Harry. "Teddy, this is Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy and their son Draco," Harry told him. "Lucius, Narcissa, Draco: this is Teddy Lupin. He's my godson and… well, he's your sister's grandson, Narcissa. So I suppose that would make him some sort of cousin of Draco's… second cousin, maybe? I always get muddled about that stuff."
"That's still the plan, yes," said Harry. "Not sure what I'm doing after that, though. But we can talk about it then. Will you be here?"
ed someone into giving you a job?" Harry's face was still inscrutable, and Draco's heart sank a bit more.
A luminous badger burst out of the end of his wand; it landed on the floor and looked up at him expectantly. "Go to Ron Weasley and tell him that Harry and Draco will be arriving in a few minutes," Teddy told it, and it immediately scampered effortlessly through the wall and vanished.
He bowed to them and went inside the shop, leaving them all in a slightly uncomfortable silence, which was eventually broken by Seamus. "Come on! Come on! Hurry up, Harry, come on!" he sang unexpectedly. Draco stared at him, but noticed that all the others (including Professor McGonagall) were rolling their eyes.
He was startled when James flung his arms round him and enveloped him in a hug. "Thanks, Dad," he said (somewhat indistinctly) into Harry's chest. "I just want you to be happier."
"It takes about three hours, including the interval, if you don't miss anything out – and we did all of it last night," Draco told him. "Most classical concerts tend to be about two hours long, so when Messiah is performed it's usual to miss out some of the movements. But the conductor last night was keen to do the whole thing. As for how long each chorus is... only a few minutes in most cases, although the Amen Chorus is a bit longer. But there are lots of solo movements as well, when the choir don't sing – there's a solo soprano, alto, tenor and bass who just sing those bits. I'd love to do the tenor solos in Messiah – I've learned them in my singing lessons – but I haven't been invited yet. I'm hoping yesterday might make them consider me in the future."
Harry blinked and tried to get his eyes to focus. The man in front of him didn’t appear to be using a wand, but was pointing at Harry with both hands; part of Harry’s mind recognised the shape the man’s fingers were forming, but stored it away to consider later. As Harry stared, the man muttered "Sia maledetto… sia maledetto… sia maledetto", the words becoming increasingly hoarse with each repetition.
hiding. You want to avoid everyone because they won't leave you alone. I should think he does too – it's just that in his case it's negative attention people give him, whereas with you it was always positive."
Potter laughed. "True," he said. "You were on dangerous ground there for a moment. But I decided you had good reason. Now, can I beg one more favour? Please will you stay with Hermione just a little bit longer, while I go and make Ron feel like an idiot?"
"Which bed d'you want?" asked Harry, deciding that this was probably a safe enough conversation opener.
. As for why: Molly Weasley knows more about healing magic than anyone else I know. Hermione's pretty good, but she's still learning. Molly's been doing it for decades and she's a natural. If I was sick, she'd always be the one I'd go to first."
They passed the Apple Store and Oxford Circus, and turned into Oxford Street, before Draco spoke. "Please don't take this to mean I'm not grateful, because I am," he said. "But... well, I'm extremely curious about why you happened to remember my parole conditions that specifically."
"I suspect McGonagall might have something to say about that," remarked Harry, but he couldn't stop himself beaming again. "OK, do your worst."

"Oh, they can just turn up on the day if they like - I doubt it will sell out, sadly," said Draco. "But maybe just let me know the day before so I can try and save some good seats."
This caused both Draco and Harry to burst out laughing again. "More toast and coffee would be lovely, please," said Harry, and Draco nodded. "I'm not much of a tea person. And thank you for feeding us. You're an excellent cook."
"This week, as you know, we'll be concentrating on duelling techniques," he said. "Professor Potter and I will give you a demonstration, and afterwards we will all practise some of the spells we used, before splitting you into pairs so that you can have a go yourselves. We'll be using quite a few spells in our demonstration, but the one I particularly want you to watch out for today is
"Stand by the door, please, Hermione," said Harry, removing his shoes. "I don't want the kids to see me naked."
Albus beamed at him. "I am," he said simply. "It's only my dad that's not, and hopefully he'll get there soon."
"They are," said Harry. "This is all very impressive, I must say. I never thought you had it in you. Now, come on. I want my hot chocolate. And I want to quiz you about your personal life."
which made them look at each other in horror). Draco had been pleased when he’d found out that he’d been chosen to go last, but he was no longer sure it was a good thing, as his nerves had increased exponentially during his classmates’ performances, some of which were much better than he’d expected.
Harry blushed and started to speak, but just then the fire flared again and Hermione stepped through, red-eyed but otherwise calm. "I thought you'd only be a minute, Ron!" she said. "What's the delay? If he's still too upset to talk, you could've just come back and said so."
them on, actually," admitted Harry. "I don't think I've ever spent that long naked before. It was good, though. We should do that again."
Harry grinned. "Are you sure you wouldn't mind? That'd be great!" he said. "Particularly as, the way things are at the moment, there's zero chance of me ever
, does it?" Harry sounded worried, which gave Draco a pleasantly warm and fuzzy feeling in his belly.
of the French revolutions – and this song is sung by Marius, the hero, who's thinking about all his friends who've died during the fighting."
Harry's eyes met Draco's briefly, but then he became fascinated with his fingernails. "Well, I was just thinking," he mumbled. "I know we agreed to take turns with the bed, but that sofa is more uncomfortable than I thought it would be, and my back was
"I'm so sorry, Draco," said Harry, standing up. "If it turns out to be only something quick, I'll come back, but, if they're calling me in, it must be something major. I doubt I'll be able to make it back to you tonight."
Draco grinned. "You're not the only one," he said. "Speaking of which, I have a bit of a fantasy that I'm hoping you can help me with. Please will you stand on top of the sleeping bag?"
"Bluetooth speaker," he said, to Harry's quizzical look. "Just watch." He set the speaker down on the bench between them and spent a minute fiddling with his phone. Then Harry gasped as the sound of an orchestra suddenly burst out from the speaker. Draco stood up.
"Lux circuitum," said Harry, and a white glow surrounded them. "That's a definite yes, by the way – but I'd like to return the favour too, and I want to be able to see you."
Harry sighed in pleasure, writhing slightly in response to Draco's tongue. "That's a good point," he said huskily. "OK, maybe we don't have to stop work just yet. But we are definitely putting a lock on our office door."
for people to stare at, and Draco and I just happened to be there at the same time but not as interesting as whatever else was going on, it'd be a good way of easing him back into the public consciousness. Then, next time we're there, it won't be a novelty."
Round five turned out to be a long one, but they did eventually make it out of the shower. "I'm just going to pop home for ten minutes before we go out, if that's OK," said Draco. "I need a change of clothes, but more importantly I want to check Kilgharrah's alright. I hardly ever leave her overnight."
"I have a new favourite bit," announced Hermione. "We both said at the interval that our favourite bit was the first thing you sang, but then there were so many amazing bits in the second half... but I think my favourite was that bit at the end when you finally sang with the choir. You were smiling through the whole thing, and the other soloists were kind of glaring a bit, and it really showed the difference."
"Definitely," said Harry. "And, just for the sake of transparency, I think I was only half-joking. In case
Draco laughed. "Mulled wine in return for being smacked in the face? Seems fair enough," he said, lifting a glass to be filled. "But honestly, I'd forgotten about it, until Ron called me Malfoy. There were so many worse things that happened after that, it seems quite innocuous in comparison."
By the time he'd said an awkward goodbye to Ginny and owled McGonagall prior to returning to Hogwarts via the fireplace in her office, Harry's head had been spinning as the realisation sank in that, in the morning, the failure of his marriage would be common knowledge. His reason for seeing McGonagall had initially been to give her the courtesy of a heads-up, but somehow he'd found himself talking at length about the need to keep Draco at Hogwarts. He suspected he'd babbled a bit, but McGonagall had just gazed at him sympathetically and told him to come to her if he needed any help, before agreeing to his suggestion.
Harry grinned and crawled out to join him. Goose pimples immediately covered his naked chest, and Draco couldn't resist reaching out to see if Harry's nipples were as hard as they looked (they were). This caused Harry to hurriedly remove Draco's second jumper and the T-shirt he'd been wearing underneath, and he ran his hands over Draco's torso in delight.
Harry was all too aware that his very erect cock was now nestled along Draco's arse crack, but Draco didn't comment on this, so neither did Harry. "You never told me who yours was," he suddenly remembered. "You know the whole history of my love life, and I have no idea about yours!"
"You never know," agreed Harry. "Goodnight, Draco." He stepped into the fireplace as Draco said "Goodnight, Harry."
"OK. I'll take the bed tonight. But after that I think we should alternate. I'd feel very uncomfortable knowing I'd taken your bed from you
Nothing much happens in this chapter, sorry – it's mainly setting up the next one, in which I promise there will be answers!
Thankfully, he didn't have to wait too long before Draco appeared, along with a young Asian woman who was carrying several books of music.
When they emerged from the Queen's House an hour later into the Greenwich sunset, it was snowing, and Harry stuck his tongue out in delight to catch some of the flakes. Draco rolled his eyes, but smiled.
"Want to know what?" murmured Draco, whose eyes were closed; he stretched his head back to enable Harry to kiss more of his neck.
Harry stared at him, but it was Ron that caught on first. "Ohhhhhh, I see what you mean!" he said. "They probably picked a date and then contacted the London Eye to see if it could be made available that day. And if it couldn't, they probably tried other dates until they found one that would work. And then after it was all sorted out, they told you when to turn up, and you never say no."
"True," said Harry. "Why don't we lie down and get warm, and do a bit of meteor-watching while we're… erm, getting to know each other?"
They'd reached the Serpentine, and there were several benches overlooking the water. Fairy lights in the nearby trees gave the place a warm glow. Harry glanced around to confirm that there was no-one nearby – the nearest person was a man walking his dog past the Diana fountain – and did a quick spell to dry the bench. Draco smiled and sat down.
"Except that I've never actually been able to do the Patronus Charm," admitted Draco, embarrassed. "And, believe me, I've tried. Sorry. But don't worry – I can Apparate to Devon."
out of the way. We'll expect to see you – both of you – at our house in the next couple of days. Till then… actually, I don't want to think about what you're going to do till then. But have fun."
Harry leaned forward and kissed him thoroughly, stopping only when Ron said: "Delightful as this is to see, we still have all this food to eat, and warming charms aren't quite as good as eating it while it's still hot from the oven. So let's eat, and then later we can fine-tune the plan."
The audience was on their feet and whooping by the end of that one, and Draco and Rabia grinned (slightly demonically, it has to be said) at each other as they launched into the tour de force that was Schubert’s
The fox ran around the doorway of the Leaky Cauldron several times, leaving a rich pattern of the Catherine wheels; next, it raced up the perpendicular bit of the alley towards Gringotts, where it ran up and down each of the pillars in a spiral pattern, leaving lights in place that looked like strings of fairy lights. It came back along the other side of the road and danced over the square panes of the window of Flourish and Blotts, leaving smaller purple and blue Catherine wheels on each pane and a larger one on the door. Finally, it did the same at Ollivanders next door, and finished by bowing to Harry and vanishing.
"No, she moved to our villa in Italy, and I asked her to take all the house-elves with her," said Draco. "They were quite upset at the loss of the Manor, and I thought they'd be happier in a bigger house. And I wasn't sure whether Mother would be able to cope without them, whereas I thought I'd probably be OK."
"Sorry I'm so late," Ginny said, when the obvious exhaustion in Harry's face (somehow exacerbated by the surreal paint) guilted her into stopping her giggling. "The match took ages. What on earth happened to your face?"
Harry shook her hand, which he was still holding. "That's right, Hermione," he said, grinning. "Draco, please call me Harry. And Ron will say the same – after I've had a word with him, at least."
much difference. Can we talk about it again sometime, though, please? Just so we can try and agree on a compromise? I promise I won't try to persuade you to change your whole life to suit
all natural. The magical transplant technique isn't like the Muggle one – it causes the hair follicles to start producing hair again, as opposed to moving hair follicles from another part of the body."
"Thank you, that'd be helpful," Draco said. "We don't usually bother when it's just us, but it'll be nice to be a bit formal for a change. In fact, let's have some candles, shall we? Adds to the atmosphere. There should be some in that bottom drawer."
Harry leaned back against the wall, spent, as Draco stepped forward and kissed him, ignoring the fact that his face and clothes were covered in Harry's come.
He stepped over to the window to see what the view was like. It had just started to snow outside, and the sky was already quite dark, although the very tip of the sun was still just poking above the horizon over to the far left. Draco deduced from this that the window faced north, and belatedly realised that of course Harry's rooms were in the Training Grounds Tower. Peering down, he now noticed the Training Grounds, with the Quidditch pitch in the distance to one side and Hagrid's cottage just visible to the other.
, and I hate it. That's my favourite moment of the whole piece if it's done properly, so it ruins it for me if the conductor is power-mad and decides he doesn't want an audience to think for itself."
Draco took a deep breath. "Well, if I'm being totally honest, I've always thought of you like that, although it was a long time before I admitted it to myself, and I never told anyone else," he said. "But I would never have done anything about it. Apart from anything else, I didn't think you were gay. What happened to the Weasley girl?"
"I suppose so, but it feels like a pathetic thing to complain about," said Harry. "They're not doing any harm."
"I always get tears in my eyes at that point too," Draco admitted, when they told him about it at the end. They'd gone to the pub next door for a post-concert drink, along with most of the orchestra and choir and many of the audience; the other three soloists were conspicuous by their absence, though.
"Better than most Mondays, yes, thank you," said Draco. "I kept smiling to myself, for reasons that totally escape me." He put the laptop down and stood up to greet Harry with a kiss.
"I tried not to think about that, but I think he probably could... although not very often, or he wouldn't have spent so long trying to catch me," said Harry thoughtfully. "But yes, it did hurt."
"Oh, you know," said Harry. "You used to be a Death Eater, but eventually you realised how evil they were and changed your ways. And black pudding is a very appropriate food for Death Eaters, actually. Did they serve it at ceremonies? Please tell me they served it at ceremonies."
Harry was pulled out of his reverie by a loud chord from the string players, and realised he hadn't paid proper attention to most of Draco's first aria. He sat up and caught his boyfriend's eye as Draco sang "prepare ye the way of the Lord". And he smiled inwardly, because he'd just had an idea.
Harry was tucking into a plate of scones when Draco finally came back to the room, just after five o'clock. He had just crammed more than half a scone into his mouth when the door opened, and he nearly choked on it at the sight of Draco. The self-assured elegance that had been visible when the man had left that morning was no longer quite as prominent: Draco definitely looked frazzled. Although his robes were still perfectly crease-free, a couple of strands of his hair were slightly astray, and each of his cheeks featured a small red glow. The hand that was holding his satchel was white-knuckled, and the other was clenched into a fist at his side.
A few minutes later, there was a knock on the door, and Harry opened it to find Seamus leaning on the doorpost and grinning at him. "You've got me dying of curiosity, I have to say, mate," said Seamus. "Will this be quick, though? Because I need to sleep soon. Not all of us can operate on only a few hours' sleep every night like you can."
"Let's see… party hat… plastic reindeer… oh, good, a joke. What did Adam say on the day before Christmas?"
"No, of course not," said Draco. "I was keeping a very careful eye on it, just in case, but none of them even tried. I'd be interested to know whether or not they would have given it a go if James hadn't been sitting right there, mind you. Anyway, when he
"Goodnight," said Harry. This was accompanied by another smile and a slight crinkling around his eyes, both of which were still etched in Draco's mind by the time he'd stripped off and climbed under the duvet. He spent several minutes trying to distract himself from the uppermost thought in his mind, but eventually he gave in and took hold of his cock. He'd hardly started to move his hand before he was coming; he'd left his wand in the living room, but he'd mastered wandless silencing and cleaning spells many years earlier. Just as well, really.
"He's not bad," said Scorpius, emerging from the bathroom and starting to work his way round the living room. "I do always feel as if I've learned stuff after one of his lessons. And I like the fact that he always gives us real-life examples of when he's actually
He hadn't been lying when he'd told Draco that he'd felt better as a result of this, and he'd felt even better – oddly enough – after he'd sobbed his heart out for twenty minutes after Draco had left to explore the school. He'd even managed to sleep for a couple of hours before waking and feeling the urgent need for a shower.
When Harry woke up, he found that his wish had come true, because he had turned round in his sleep and was now enfolded in Draco's arms from behind. He lay there and decided to allow himself to just enjoy the feeling, for a little while at least. He was amazed at his own daring for asking for this; despite being, he was forced to admit, generally thought of as one of the bravest people in the world, Harry didn't think of
been working. And there are the stars, of course. I bet you remember more of your astronomy lessons than I do – you can tell me the names of all the stars I've forgotten."
I was at the markets in question last night and noticed the Nutcracker soldier just like Harry and Draco did… and I hadn't seen the prompt at that point! So I had to include that.
amazingly good-looking," said Harry. "There weren't many things I envied about you at school, as I'm sure you'll understand, but I
"No, I always thought it sounded a bit yukky," said Draco. "I did try a marshmallow once, but I didn't really like it. I like sweet things, but that was too sweet. If I wanted my hot chocolate sweet, I'd put sugar in it."
"Amazing," said Harry. "Fabulous. Incredible. Fantastic. All those sorts of words. But that's not because it was sex. It's because it was with
, and there's so much of it to explore, and I can remain anonymous. I like the fact that I have a job I'm good at, however menial it might be. And I
"I do," Draco confirmed. "I think it’s the result of a build-up of stress and overwork. But that doesn’t mean it can’t be fixed. And one thing that may well help is solving the mystery of this curse. What’s the latest on Blaise?"
"No, no," said Malfoy hastily. "That didn't come out right. Sorry. I meant that... well, on each of those occasions
"I'll try to remember that," said Harry. "It'll shock you to hear that I'm not the tidiest of people. But I bet I can unpack quicker than you."
She set off back through the house, and Draco and Harry obediently followed her. "RON, DRACO'S BROUGHT BAILEYS, AND WAIT TILL YOU SEE WHAT HE'S WEARING!" she yelled as she walked.
"Are you OK, mate?" asked Ron quietly, coming to stand beside him. "I'm a bit freaked out being in here again, and I didn't even do anything."
Sure enough, a couple of minutes later Harry gave the oil one last stir and then looked at his colleague. "Right, Liz," he said. "Fish is ready." He started to scoop the cooked pieces of battered fish out of the oil and put them in the compartment on top of the vat.
He found Lily immediately: she was in the Slytherin common room chatting animatedly to Hugo Weasley, who appeared to be perfectly happy just to listen, throwing in an occasional remark when Lily paused for breath. Harry couldn't quite hear what they were saying amidst the general chatter in the room, but he exulted for a moment at this evidence of how things had changed since the war – he thought it extremely unlikely that a Hufflepuff would have even
"Nah," said Harry. "Once I'm asleep I'm out like a light till morning. And I don't think I need one now either. Let's get some sleep."
Draco and Ron looked at each other. After a moment of silent communication, Ron nodded and turned back to Harry. "Well, no," he admitted. "Look, I wasn't sure, and I didn't like to ask, but... You and Ginny. It's not really been working lately, has it? Not like it used to, at least. And it's been obvious for a while that you didn't really want to marry her. I think that's why you're not all that upset that it's over."
"Yep. No time like the present," said Hermione encouragingly. "Let me know how you get on, won’t you?"
Harry looked uncertain. "But... I'm not that important. They would never do that... would they? It's kind of embarrassing to think they might. They're... you know, they run the wizarding world, and I'm just... well, I'm just Harry. ... Why are you all looking at me like that?"
"Right," said Draco. "And, of course, you wouldn't have been held as a child, would you? I can see why it's something that would mean a lot to you. It's not a silly thing at all. Well, I'm sorry you got to such an advanced age before you got to do it, but I'm very glad that it was me that got to make your wish come true." His arms had been resting loosely on Harry's shoulders, but now he pulled Harry closer to him and gave him a tight hug.
"And if they don't mention it, maybe you and I can have a quiet word with Oliver to find out what he's done about it, and then follow Plan A unless his answer means we can't?" continued Harry.
"I'm sorry, Malfoy," Ron said. "It's none of my business what Harry does with you, and even if you weren't with him right now I should have given you the benefit of the doubt and believed you'd changed."
It only felt like the next moment when he opened them again, but clearly some time had passed, because the sun was blazing through the open window and a fully-dressed Draco was shaking him awake. Harry rubbed his eyes and sat up against the headboard, and was handed a steaming cup of coffee. He muttered his thanks and drank half of it before looking properly at Draco, who had perched himself on the edge of the bed.
“Most of them aren’t familiar with London,” Draco told her, belatedly realising how much effort Harry must have gone to. “Thanks again.” He shook the stage manager’s hand again, grabbed his stuff from the green room, and went out through the stage door, with Rabia hot on his heels.
"Will you sit with me and Professor Malfoy to watch the match, Dad?" demanded Lily, wrapping her arms round his waist.
"I'm sorry, I didn't choose my words very carefully," said Draco, after waiting a few seconds in case Harry had more to say. "I should have said that she'd done something idiotic. I didn't mean to insult your wife."
"Do you remember that lesson we had at school when we were supposed to be doing a proper meteor observation, and recording magnitude and direction and all that sort of thing, but then we all forgot our clipboards every time a meteor appeared, and everyone was just going
"This, I have to see," said Harry. "Great, then. We'll see you later. Come on, Teddy, let's leave them to it."
Harry frowned. "I suppose it was a bit too much to ask that they'd help Draco because he needed them to," he said. "But we're not going to refuse any help we can get. And I will tell the press what the hospital has done, if they like – but you'd better ask them whether they really want me to, because if I do make a statement then I'll be including the fact that they didn't help Draco the first time he asked. And I'll also be pointing out that there are other patients who would benefit from similar help, and that I'll be looking into ways to help
"Well, Teddy'll still be at Hogwarts for another couple of weeks, of course," Draco reminded him. "But he'd love it if you visited him there, I'm sure. You could take him out to Hogsmeade. I used to love it when my parents did that."
"All sorts of things," said Draco. "Other oratorios, opera arias, Lieder, musical theatre, pop songs... just anything that's good music. I... could sing something for you now, if you like?"
"He really is the best singer I've ever heard," said Ron. "My mum actually wanted to come today to speak to you all about him, but we thought it might be a bit much to have
Breakfast might have been slightly awkward, due to the fact that Lucius and Narcissa both sat there just sipping coffee and watching Draco and Harry eat, but they were too hungry to be put off. After five minutes of shovelling food into their mouths, both plates were clear.
Harry tightened his arms around him. "I hope he doesn't feel too left out when I take over some of his snuggling duties," he said. "He led me to you, after all. I'd hate to think he was deprived as a result."
"Not just me," said Harry, his head starting to ache with all the confusing thoughts that were spinning around inside it. "This obviously involves both of us, and your needs are just as important as mine. But it
"Right then, how about we lead them a merry dance inside the castle?" Ron suggested. "We could wander for quite a while without having to turn round."
Draco closed the door on his son and turned back into the room to find Harry attempting to hug all three of his children at once.
Two hours later, Hermione was ensconced in a private room at St Mungo's; Ron was again asleep in the chair by her bed; and Harry and Draco had just returned to Grimmauld Place, having promised to visit Hermione the following day.
After they'd been at the buffet for fifteen minutes, Harry was starting to fidget. "Look, I'm really going to have to go," he told Draco. "I've got so many things I have to sort out before tomorrow. I'm sorry. I honestly would like to stay and chat. Maybe another time?"
To deafening applause, they walked out in front of the huge audience; Draco took Rabia's hand and they bowed side by side, before Draco escorted her to the piano and pulled out the stool for her to sit on. He shook her hand and walked back to the front of the performance area (there was no stage as such, but he noticed that the rows of seats appeared to be slightly raked so that everyone could see, and inwardly marvelled at the combined power of Harry and Hermione's magic). Harry was waiting for him, applauding with the rest of the audience; Draco joined him and shook his hand, and Harry gave him a chaste kiss on the lips before smiling reassuringly and taking his seat in the front row next to Hermione and Ron.
"Oh, bloody hell," said Ron, flushing even redder. Harry, however, put his arm round Draco and grinned at him wickedly.
"Two more relationships between then and now – both lasting just a couple of months – and one one-night stand, which was fun at the time but made me realise that those are not for me. I've been single since... well, since my birthday, actually. Apparently I didn't say the right things when I opened his present, and we ended up having a blazing row at the party. It was not pretty."
Harry beamed at him. "It was alright, then? That's a relief. I wasn't sure whether there might be a better way to do it. I was just sort of guessing. Well, actually to start with I hadn't even thought about going that far – I just knew I wanted to touch you all over – but when your cock was right in front of my mouth I couldn't resist."
"I can imagine," said Draco. "She was always scarily intelligent. I'm pleased to hear they're still together, though. They were so different that I could never understand how it worked, but it obviously did."
"Try and stop me," Seamus told him. "I haven't done anything like that since Bonfire Night, and that was almost two months ago. It'll be fun! Also, if Diagon Alley is still covered in snow, the fireworks will look even better. I'm picturing a selection of blues and purples. Very different from the reds and oranges on Bonfire Night. How does that sound?"
spell is that... well, if it hits one person, it does bond them to the caster, but if it hits two people who are
"I'm not sure I would have dared to take books like that out of a public library," mused Draco. "Luckily I never had to, though, because our library at the Manor was very well-stocked. And we had an elf librarian who'd go and buy any books that we asked for that weren't already there."
Harry gave him a watery grin and turned to give the rest of the audience (who’d applauded the end of this speech wildly) a quick wave, as Rabia launched into the intro. Draco soon lost himself in the song, but by the time he got to the final “empty chairs at empty tables where my friends will sing no more”, he became aware that most of the audience had tears streaming down their cheeks, those on the front row most of all; oddly, this observation delighted him so much that he did in fact finish the song without crying himself, for the first time ever.
paperwork – I do spend most of my time actually teaching kids, and I love that. So it's definitely better than being Head Auror."
"He calls me Draco?" But even as he asked the question, Draco remembered that he'd heard the evidence of this the previous day. He felt his face heat up again. "Fine. Hermione. Ron." They both smiled at him. "Tell me about Harry, please."
dark. So I found a satellite photo of England at night, and looked to see where the blackest place is, and it's here. Well, not here exactly – a place called Fleet Moss, a few miles south of Hawes."
"Sixteen-year-old me would be quite startled that you knew that phrase, but then again sixteen-year-old me had already been wanking to thoughts of
you today is that Harry was planning to wait a couple of days before trying to talk to you again, so as to give you a chance to get over your shock, and we were a bit worried that you might have vanished again before he came back. And he's had such a difficult time over the past few years that we didn't want to risk losing the first thing that's made him happy in ages." She didn't break eye contact with Draco while saying this, and he found he needed to take a steadying breath.
freaky! I meant that every word you just said could have been truthfully said by me. Well, except that I've never kissed a boy."
"Well, that's actually another thing I'm unsure about," said Draco. "We agreed I should do a classical song and a more modern one, and I think that's a good plan, but I don't think there's an outfit I'd feel comfortable in for both of those."
"Don't worry," whispered Harry. Then, to Ron: "It is, actually. What are you doing here, though? Is something wrong?"
"Well, that's because I've only just started," Ron told him. "And actually the plus points are closely related to the minus points. For one thing, although I did like interacting with all the Ministry people, it's also really nice spending so much time with my brother, especially as it feels as if he feels better with me there. And, although the Auror work was less predictable and therefore more exciting, it was also much more stressful. Having a job that ends when the shop closes is brilliant. I hated having to do work at home - now, when I'm at home I don't need to think about work at all. Actually, I think that's the best plus point."
"Which is why I'm thanking you," Harry said. "You were the one who talked me into mentioning it in the first place. And you were the one who came up with the solution."
"Not at all," said Draco. "I'm well aware that you're Harry's family. I suspect it would take a lot more than an awkward scene with an ex-girlfriend to keep him away, and I wouldn't dream of discouraging him from anything that was important to him."
occurred to him, almost as soon as he started thinking about it, that it might have just been Harry being friendly. Maybe he was touchy-feely with
"No pressure or anything," commented Draco wryly. "Right, it's a date. Tomorrow is the first day of the rest of your life. Operation New Harry will commence. But tonight, I really want to just lie here in your arms and stare at the pretty flames. I've decided it's my new favourite feeling."
"I've never actually tried one of these before," commented Draco as they walked back towards the September 11 Memorial Garden. He put the end of it into his mouth and started sucking absently.
Draco responded by scooping up the last of his whipped cream and tipping his head back to drop it in his mouth. As he licked his finger clean, he was interested to note that Harry seemed to be following his every movement with his eyes.
try to get better," said Harry. "Now, it's still an hour before we'll be eating, so how about you sing to me in the meantime? You always look happier when you're singing."
very uncomfortable, and the bed was huge. Surely Draco would be receptive to such a practical suggestion?
Harry grimaced. "Yes, I'm sorry about that," he said. "If it's any consolation, I did tell someone a couple of days ago that you once tried to tell me I was being an idiot about this."
"To be perfectly honest, I wasn’t sure what to expect," Draco told him. "I was hoping we could gloss over our past differences and be civilised. But, just in case we couldn’t, I knew I’d feel better if we were here."
"I don't think it's actually possible for you to surprise me more than you already have tonight, but you're welcome to try," said Harry. "But we'd better get going, before I fall asleep on my feet. Have you finished your drink?"
Several hours later, all the cake was gone, and asparagus soup had been heated up and consumed; the sky was now totally dark, and the spectacle overhead was glorious. The square of Pegasus was setting in the west, but Orion stood proudly in the south, and Jupiter was blazing just above the eastern horizon, easily the brightest thing in the sky.
"You, obviously, as you're well aware, you smug git," Draco told him. "Thank you for my surprise. That's a memory that'll stay with me forever. You must be getting a bit cold by now, though?"
"And... maybe you could call me Draco? Malfoy reminds me of the boy I used to be, and I don't like to be reminded of him."
they'll choose to split it equally between the two of us, but we don't want to pressurise them in either direction."
for the compliment," said Draco, inwardly cheering. "I have to admit that I've cheated a bit, though. My hair started receding a few years ago and I
"Victoire just really likes them, but most of all she likes the smell,"Teddy explained. "So I always light them a while before she's due to arrive, so the smell has a chance to build up."
"Alright," said Draco, although he felt anything but. He shivered slightly at the familiar egg-breaking-on-the-head sensation of the Disillusionment charm, and then walked into the chippy behind his new friends.
"I have a recital on Friday at college," Draco told him. "A half-hour mixed programme. It'll be assessed as part of my course."
Draco looked at Harry inquiringly. Harry laughed and pointed out of the window. Draco went over to peer out. The sky was already dark, but a snowman
Draco walked out onto the stage to polite applause; as usual, he dreamed - for just a second - of a day when the mere sight of him would whip audiences up into a frenzy, but in the meantime he was perfectly content with his aim of ensuring that their reaction would be considerably more enthusiastic after they'd actually heard him sing. Currently he knew that the appreciative murmurs were mainly for the female soloists' posh frocks - the soprano was in a full-length clingy silver number, while the alto had gone for waves of midnight blue - but he felt good in his own full white tie outfit, although felt a bit guilty that the bass was only in black tie. As he bowed, he recalled Harry's outfit at the Yule Ball all those years earlier, and smiled.
"Don't be too sure," said Harry. "I don't think I could have done what you've done since you came back. How long ago was that?"
– and tied it back onto the owl's leg. "Back to Malfoy, please. Oh, and here you go." Harry reached for one of the treats he kept in a bowl on his bedside table, and the owl accepted it and flew out of the window.
"Quarter to six," said Draco. "I haven't told you how I got the message to James, have I?" He grinned.
Harry laughed. "Can’t argue with that," he said. "Anyway, I take it Zabini’s still not talking?" At Ron’s headshake, he went on, "What d’you think about getting Draco to talk to him? He might open up a bit more to him. And Draco wants to ask him about my attacker, too."
forgotten that he was still wearing his extra-high-strength Disillusionment Charm. His laughter died away a moment later, though, when it occurred to him to wonder why he could now see this house, when he'd never been able to before. With this thought, he tentatively walked across to the French windows and peered into the house.
Harry shook his head, smiling slightly. "I said the exact same thing to her," he said. "She pointed out that I
"Singing works better when you stand," he explained. He stood with his eyes closed for a moment, listening to the strings, and then started to sing.
more details, just so you know. But let's start with: are you on your own? Is there a partner? Kids?"
"You only think that because you don't know them very well," said Harry. He took Draco's glass from him and put it on the coffee table, taking both of Draco's hands in his and turning him towards him; Draco didn't look up, but also didn't resist, so Harry felt slightly encouraged. "I can tell you for a fact that they definitely
"Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans!" exclaimed Teddy in delight. "I haven't had these in months. Thank you."
"I can never bear to move her when she's asleep," Draco admitted. "She's just too cute. Can we just get in the bed on either side of her? She'll probably wake up if we do, and move on her own."
Harry scooped up the last remnants of custard and licked them off his spoon, cursing himself inwardly while gazing at the window next to him; it was covered in intricate icy patterns that Harry had been admiring while eating his pudding
"I go for Sunday lunch every week or two," said Draco. "I sometimes have to work on a Sunday, but I do try to visit them when I don't. And they're fine, thank you for asking. I thought they'd have hated having to stay in the Manor forever, but they seem OK with it. They do seem to walk in the grounds a lot more than they ever used to, though."
Draco looked up at Harry, and Harry decided that the word that best described his expression was 'sultry'. But then all thoughts of vocabulary flew out of Harry's head as Draco began to lick every part of his cock, alternating his licks with brief swirls of his tongue around its head. When Draco finally put the tip of his tongue inside the slit, Harry shuddered, and Draco instantly wrapped his mouth around as much of the whole cock as he could, maintaining his suction as Harry came harder than he'd ever done before.
"Erm," said Harry, "this is the tent. In front of the tent is where we will sit to look at the sky later. (The chairs are inside the tent for the moment – I put them there in case it rained.) Everywhere else is the toilet, but it's more pleasant for all concerned if we go a decent distance from the tent before using it."
"Is she now? And I suppose the candles are for her," said Harry. "Well, don't worry, we're not staying. We only popped in to see if you were OK. Do you need anything?"
"I suspect we will never know the truth," said Professor McGonagall, "but, if I may, I do have an alternative theory. Perhaps the good that was done with that wand was responsible? I imagine that most wands that are seized are not then put to non-criminal uses."
Draco stared at him, delighted. "Well, I find that very hard to believe, but it's nice of you to say so," he said. "Now, I'm very keen to suck
"Of course," Draco said. "I'm impressed you actually stayed this long, after you said you didn't want to be here at all. And I'm pleased to have seen you eat some proper food. All you need to do now is get some proper sleep and you'll look a bit more alive tomorrow."
By Tuesday, the bond had indeed relaxed to the point where they didn't have to actually be touching; the pain only started if they were more than a few feet apart. It felt to Harry as if he and Draco had lived together forever, so easily had they fallen into a domestic routine. Even returning to work the previous day hadn't been particularly unsettling: Ron, it turned out, had talked to both Kingsley and Chris at the weekend about the partner swap, and it was all sorted out; in gratitude, Harry insisted that he would move into Draco's office rather than the other way round, so that Ron could keep his own desk.
"You know it was," said Draco. "No doubt my father will be turning in his grave. But it was very tasty, I have to admit. I'd expected it to be much greasier than it was, too. But I'm so full! Why do they do such huge portions?"
Draco was feeling very content. HIs belly was full and his surroundings were spectacular. The conversation had flowed effortlessly, and remarkably they seemed to have avoided any potentially difficult topics. Between them, they'd identified all the currently visible constellations, and even found several of the brighter Messier objects; they'd also discussed subjects ranging from
They fell onto the bed still kissing, causing an outraged "MIAOW!" from Kilgharrah, who had been sleeping there. She ran out of the room in disgust, but for once Draco paid her no attention.
is the reason I wanted Rabia as my accompanist," Draco said. "She's the best, and I didn't think any of the others would be up to that one."
to make a move, just in case. Draco definitely wanted Harry in every possible way – he had admitted that to himself during his afternoon explorations, all the while shaking his head at the ridiculousness of falling so hard during the course of only three conversations – but if he couldn't have him as a lover (and it
"I should probably warn you that Ron's likely to guess, whether you tell him or not," Harry told him breathlessly. "He's got
"Don't you dare, Mother," said Draco, as Narcissa started to rise from the table. "As for what I used to say about you, obviously it was all along the lines of
Draco frowned, and then reached for his wand, still naked. He used it to write glowing words in the air.
Draco nobly refrained from making the obvious rejoinder. "Of course," he said, settling into the chair. "If nothing else, I'm
Draco raised his eyebrows and grinned at Harry, his eyes twinkling. "My hero!" he said. "I'm impressed. Thank you for the support. I'm guessing she hasn't replied? How long ago did you send it?"
Draco laughed out loud. "That's exactly what I said to McGonagall yesterday," he told them. "Scared?"
"I know. Especially because Orion'll be up by then. Not that there's anything wrong with the other constellations, but Orion is the best, isn't he?"
being there. You'll forgive me if I don't think I'll be ready to try it without you any time soon, however well this goes?"
After fiddling with his phone briefly, he lifted his head and smiled at them. “This is an old Muggle pop song,” he told his audience. “It was sung in the 1950s by a guy called Johnny Mathis, and it’s the most romantic song I know. It’s called
look really good," said Hermione, as Harry leaned over to kiss Draco. "And although I did rather enjoy the unexpected show at the cottage, I don't think they're about to repeat it here."
"To be honest, I have no idea," Draco admitted. "I'll make sure she's looked after, though, don't worry. We were never really friends, but I do owe her a lot. Long story," he added, when the doctor looked at him quizzically.
, which was the last song on that tape and reached number one in the charts during my first camping trip.
He was delighted to find that Harry immediately adjusted his position so that more of his and Draco's bodies were touching; having done this, Harry started running his fingers through Draco's hair as their tongues explored each other's mouths. After a while, though, Harry pulled away, obviously reluctantly.
"WE'RE HERE," shouted Harry, and squeezed Draco's hand. Moments later, Hermione entered the room, looking slightly breathless.
Draco reached down and tentatively put his hand on Harry's crotch, which definitely provided supporting evidence for Harry's statement; also, the sharp intake of breath made Draco grin with satisfaction. He used his other arm to pull Harry closer towards him, and started kissing all the parts within reach of his head, while very lightly stroking the front of Harry's underpants. Harry threw back his head and moaned, tightening his grip on Draco; within a couple of minutes he came, with a yell and a shudder.
He stepped back and stretched his arms out to either side. Draco looked him up and down again approvingly, then picked up the tape measure.
"It sounds very lonely, though," commented Harry. "Don't you have any friends over there? Or friends from here who visit?"
at least done something similar to that before; however, this seemed like an incredibly cheeky request to make, and he wasn't at all sure how he was going to bring himself to make it.
"I wondered when they'd get to this stage," muttered Narcissa to Lucius. "It took longer than I expected."
at the time. Draco had been amused when he'd first encountered the Muggle expression 'you look as if you've seen a ghost'; Potter had, of course, seen much more terrifying things than ghosts and had hardly even broken a sweat, as far as Draco could recall, but any Muggle seeing him now would definitely go with the ghost phrase. Potter looked quite ill.
"No, probably not," said Molly, "but it'll help more than anything else. The voice is a very sensitive thing and it can react badly if you try and alter it with magic, so the best strategy for things like this is to use mainly physical cures – same as a Muggle would – but I do know some spells that can enhance their effects."
Draco reached for Harry's hand and squeezed it. "I think we're singing from the same hymnsheet," he said. "Which is a phrase that totally baffled me the first time I heard it, by the way. But I know what it means now."
my cock, let alone suck it. So thank you. You didn't have to do that, but I'm very happy that you did."
Draco rolled his eyes. "It was just easier," he said. "I told them your full name, and they called you Hermione after that, and they looked at me a bit strangely when I called you Granger. But, yes, of course I will call you Hermione if you prefer. Only if you call me Draco, though."
"Well, if you want, I could…" started Hermione, but Ron glared at her. "How are you going to light them? Do you have a battery?"
They set off up the street; Harry and Draco walked in the middle, holding hands, bracketed by Hermione on Draco's other side and Ron on Harry's. At first their stroll was a bit of an anti-climax, as no one paid them any attention at all. After a few minutes, though, people started to notice, and soon all the passers-by were staring at them. No one said anything, though – although there was quite a bit of indistinguishable muttering – and Draco started to feel better.
have laughed at you before, but I know you better now, and I think we might even be described as friends."
when he sang them? Given what Draco had said earlier about mental audiences for songs, it seemed at least possible.
That unused ticket had been central in Harry's thoughts for the whole of the next day, and by the time Ginny had waved the rest of them off at King's Cross he had formulated his plan. McGonagall had been a bit surprised to hear Harry's request, and he had felt his face growing more and more crimson as he had haltingly explained to her why he felt this surprise trip was so important, and why he couldn't have done anything sooner.
the house numbers. However, Draco eventually found the house he was looking for. It was the last one in the lane, and had no visible Christmas lights, but there was a reassuring glow behind the curtains.
"Sixth year," agreed Draco. "We spent an unholy amount of time watching each other than year, didn't we? I.... no, never mind."
happy, and Harry was well aware that he spent hours of his own life doing exactly what James was doing now, and he regarded that as perfectly normal. And he knew that James
"She’s fine, thank you," said Hermione proudly. "She’s seven now, and doing very well at school. She’s started devouring my library."
Harry stepped up beside Draco as the even-more thunderous applause started, and put his arm round his shoulders until it stopped. "I know we said no touching," he whispered to Draco, "but I've realised that the best bit about your singing is the emotions it evokes, and I don't think there's any harm in people seeing that I love you. And well done, by the way - you were pretty perfect today."
"Won't be as tight, because I've had sex a lot more recently," finished Harry. "It's OK, you can say it. We can do that if you want – I don't care who tops. Well, actually I do – I want it all. So we both need to top."
Somehow this giggling had become kissing and groping, and before long they were stumbling back up to Harry's bedroom, removing each other's clothes en route. Harry grinned to himself at the memory of the hour that had followed, and kissed the top of Draco's head, mainly to see if he was asleep.
"How long will it last?" asked Ron, who had relaxed but was still slumped on the floor with his back to the door.
"An interesting strategy," commented Professor McGonagall from behind them. As they turned to face her, she went on: "I don't think I would have thought of it myself, but it seems to have achieved the desired objective. I trust you will reward Mr Finnigan and his students appropriately."
embarrassing about me... but one thing I can promise you, without having heard it, is that everything he said is true, because Harry's the best person I know, and you can always trust him. Although he does have a little bit to learn about appropriate behaviour for managers."
Two hours later, Harry was at his desk in his staff quarters, gulping down a mug of strong coffee. He had almost finished his lesson plans for the following day, and the temptation to go to sleep immediately and get up early to finish them was very strong. But Harry knew himself well enough to know that in the morning Still-Half-Asleep-Harry would tell himself it'd be fine if he stayed in bed another hour and made up the lesson as he went along. Hence the strong coffee, and he had also put on some music to see if that helped; normally he found it impossible to concentrate with music playing, but he hoped the distraction might help for once. The Spanish Dance from Tchaikovsky's
"And I've explained time and time again why I can't just do that," said Harry quietly. "I don't think you're listening."
I can't promise there'll be as much sex in all the remaining chapters, but for the moment they're very keen on it :-)
solos pretty well, but I think I need to sing through them every day between now and Sunday, to build up my stamina. It's not as gruelling a sing as something like
a terrible person, actually," said Harry. "You were a child, under a huge amount of pressure and with hardly any support. Anyone might have done the same as you, under those circumstances."
Draco and Harry had continued to share the bed each night, but there had been no physical contact between them. From the number of times that Draco had caught Harry staring at him, though, he was hopeful that it was only a matter of time before the right moment presented itself. Hopeful in both senses of the word, in fact, because it was being increasingly difficult to find opportunities to wank. (Draco had actually been forced to restrict the number of times
Harry opened his mouth to answer, but was surprised when Ron beat him to it. "Harry's a different person to the one he was a year ago," he said. "We all know that Harry couldn't stop thinking about Ginny when we were away searching for Horcruxes. I'm still a bit freaked out about the amount of time he spent staring at her dot on the map. But I don't think Ginny's ever really understood the pressure he was under, or what he's been through, so she doesn't get why Harry wants to keep himself to himself these days."
Draco raised his eyebrows. "That is a bit of a surprise, I have to say. I assumed you'd love it. What's the problem?"
"It is, isn't it?" said Harry. "It looks even stranger from the side. Apparently they used to have a plastic one climbing up the clock tower, but it kept getting damaged by the wind and wouldn't stay inflated, so they got this weird one made out of lights. It's definitely distinctive, though."
"I wasn't really asleep, actually," said Hermione. "I was just resting my eyes. Every time I feel like I'm about to drop off, they come and check on me and wake me up. Anyway, I want to hear about you. Where have you been all these years?"
This caused Weasley to laugh so much that he actually had tears rolling down his cheeks. "I'll say this much for you, Malfoy: you're definitely more entertaining than you used to be. Fine, if you don't want to tell me, I don't really care. I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you've turned up after all this time, making up stories about Hermione?"
"I knew that people used to tell their kids about me, but for some reason it never occurred to me that they probably still do," admitted Harry. "I think I'd vaguely assumed that if people talk about me, it's people
"Indeed," said Lucius. "I believe it was your friend Miss Granger who invented that? Such a brilliant young woman."
"We'll have to look into that sometime," mused Draco. "See if there's something that's causing the problem. Although they should have spotted that when you did your exam."
James sighed. "As I'll ever be," he said. "It'll take a bit of a miracle for us to win, but you never know."
"Pansy's always going to be remembered as the girl who tried to hand you over to the Dark Lord," said Draco. "She got sick of all the Howlers, and being spat at in the street. She went to stay with her aunt in America a few months after the war, and never came back. And the others all gradually left the country too."
"Longbottom? Really? I'll have to thank him. I knew he was Herbology professor here, of course, but I had no idea he knew what I was doing."
Harry, who had completely forgotten about the week of duelling ahead of him, glanced at Draco and grinned. "What makes you think
"No! I... No. I'm not disgusted. I'm just surprised. But I've realised recently that I'm apparently unbelievably bad at noticing vital things about other people. And I didn't know you were divorced
noticed the time, but it's not like she's stuck there on her own," said Ron, as Harry left the office. "She'll be with her teammates. They'll be having a great time slagging you off."
Draco strode into the DADA classroom at a quarter to nine, with Harry close on his heels, and was surprised to see that all the students were already in their seats. The buzz of chatter stopped, and the second-years looked at them eagerly.
They both shook their heads, and Ginny ran her gaze over Harry worriedly. "Are you OK?" she asked. "You look a bit grey. What d’you think he did to you?"
“I’m looking forward to that too,” Draco told her. “Speaking of which, I need to go and practise. Please will you excuse me? Thank you again, Molly, for your help with my voice.”
"This is impressive, isn't it?" said Harry a few hours later, as he and Draco strolled across Red Square in the early evening. "I was right, though - St Basil's is the most impressive bit."
"I have," said Draco. "Since a few months after the war. I think, at first, I was actually trying to punish myself – I thought I didn't deserve to be with wizards. But it wasn't as bad as I'd expected it to be, once I'd got used to it."
"Sounds like a plan," said Harry, grinning. "D'you fancy a shower now, though? I was thinking it might be fun if we had one together."
," he muttered to himself, spotting a sign as he left the park. "Huh. Doesn't sound very Spanish! Or even Catalan." But then his attention was drawn to the huge stadium across the road, and he approached it carefully, avoiding the surprisingly heavy traffic.
"That was a lesson for all of us," agreed Harry, blushing. "But you're right, Draco and I are great. In fact, he's made me realise I'm been ignoring a massive issue, and that's what I've been thinking about all week."
Liz looked from one to the other of them with a twinkle in her eye. "I can see that you two know each other," she said. "Tell you what, Harry, it's nearly closing time anyway. Why don't you put your fish in as well, then you can go home and eat with your friend?"
Ron shuffled back into the room carrying three mugs of coffee, and Harry was momentarily distracted – and, as ever, immensely cheered – by the sight of Ron's furry Hippogriff slippers. (The memory of the argument he'd witnessed in the shop always made him smile almost as much as the slippers themselves. "You can't buy those, Ronald, they're just completely ridiculous! Hippogriffs don't
"When you next see her. She knows that the two of you can't be together after this, but I don't think it's really sunk in yet. It'll take a while. So please will you be nice to her until it does? I can understand if you just want to yell at her, but it won't actually make any difference."
"As you say, though, things do get temperamental if I do magic anywhere near them," said Harry. "But I don't often need to do spells near the telly, so it's fine. Anyway, much as I'd love to stay and discuss electricity and
"Why wouldn't it be?" said Malfoy. "It's fine. And actually I'm tired too, so I fancy an early night as well. I think I'll just unpack quickly first, though – I hate waking up to a messy room."
this. That I'm choosing you. I don't want everyone to think we're only together because Ginny was drunk."
"I don’t know his name," Draco admitted. "But I’ve definitely seen him. And the Italian connection is making me wonder if he might be a friend or relative of Blaise. I haven’t seen Blaise in a few years, but I could make enquiries to find out where he is."
"There's no need to thank me – I only told the truth. And you did send me a thank-you note at the time," Harry pointed out. "But I'm afraid I can't recall the verdict, other than that you weren't sent to Azkaban."
"Any time, mate," said Ron. "It was a right laugh. But I think I'll leave you to it now, if that's OK – I don't want Neville to think I'm ignoring him."
human, remember. You were having to deal with a situation no teenage boy should have had to cope with. If you made a mistake, it doesn't mean you're a bad person. If you'd
"Well, I feel as if I've hogged the conversation, so I'm glad I wasn't totally boring," said Draco. "Let's wander over to Hyde Park, shall we? I really like it in this weather. And you can tell me why you don't chat to people."
"Sorry. If it's any consolation, I'm totally full too. I should have stopped ages before I did. But I've always been in the habit of eating every scrap of food that's put in front of me. It was a survival tactic when I was little, because my aunt and uncle used to starve me. I should try to change my habits now, though, really."
he exclaimed. "I didn't really think any wizards would. Yes, I got her as a kitten in 2008 when the show had just started."
Harry grinned at Draco, who shrugged his shoulders. "Listen, you three," said Harry. "Your mum'll be Portkeying in any minute now, so just sit down and I'll join you in a second. I just want to have a word with Professor Malfoy before he leaves us. No, not leaves us,
"Anyone would think I use language for a living," said Draco, wryly. "Also… we seem to have a bit of an exhibitionist kink, don't we? I hadn't actually realised that about myself before."
Draco took his hand and started stroking it. "There'll be a next time, then?" he asked, without looking up. "I was hoping there would, but I'd understand if you just wanted a one-off to get it out of your system."
"I almost daren't ask, but... what do you mean by 'someone like me' in this particular case?" asked Draco.
"Wow, what an amazing view," he exclaimed, noticing it for the first time. The apartment had windows all along one wall and, although the windows were mostly currently covered in ice, Harry realised that they must be very high up. "What floor are we on?"
An hour later, Harry and Draco were outdoors again, this time walking up a long wide path towards an impressive old building. "That was a lot less painful than I expected," Harry was saying. "I think having the singing first made all the difference. You could tell how impressed they were, I hope. Anyway, where are we? I don't think I've been here before."
things in store eventually caused him to release Draco's lips with a regretful final peck, and start kissing his neck, moving his hands down to Draco's shoulders. He felt Draco smile.
"Only an Auror partner, and that's Ron. I haven't had a serious relationship since Ginny and I broke up. What about you?"
"If not, it's not far off," said Harry. "Teddy and I saw quite a few meteors last night, but only two of them were before midnight. Tonight we've already seen five, haven't we?"
By the time they were all inside, they were all exhausted. Hermione insisted on St Mungo's being contacted immediately, though. So Ron went there, and returned with a Healer, who examined Hermione and announced that she was healing well, all things considered, but that magical healing could definitely speed things up. He told them that she could be safely Apparated, thanks to the plaster casts; it wouldn't have been safe without them, though.
"Weird, but incredible," said Draco. He put his thumbs inside the waistband of Harry's boxer briefs. "Can I?"
"Well, that depends on which news you read," Draco told him. "But I assure you I haven't been doing anything
Draco felt Harry's arms squeeze him at this, and he leaned his head back on Harry's shoulder. "Well, thank you," he said to Ron. "I'm glad you think so. But now you've created a dilemma for me, because the deal I had with Harry was that we didn't have to discuss my possible return to the wizarding world until
"Merlin, yes," said Ron fervently. "If it had just been that total waste of time on Saturday night, or the fact that we've spent all day today filling in paperwork
The door opened as he walked up the short path, and then his mother was there. "Draco, my darling! Where on earth have you been? I've been looking out for you for hours. Come in, come in. You must be freezing." She gathered him in a hug before taking his hand and leading him into the house.
Harry didn't respond to this; he seemed to be lost in thought. Draco suddenly had an idea, and stood up. "You know what?" he said, and waited until Harry looked at him before continuing. "I haven't been to Hogwarts in years before today. I think I'm going to go for a bit of a wander, and give you some space. You look like you need it. Is that OK? Is there anything you need that I can get for you?"
Harry let out a relieved sigh. "I do," he admitted. "I really, really do. But I've been trying not to think about it, because... well, what else is there for me to do? And we're partners, so if I quit it'd have an impact on you too, which is why I kept wanting to talk to you about it, but it was too difficult to contemplate, so I kept putting it off and hoping things would just get better."
He turned the torch back on and walked quickly back to Harry, who was still entombed in the sleeping bag.
"Bloody countertenors," muttered Draco to himself as he tucked his scarf into his overcoat. "And bloody power-mad conductors." He found that he was becoming grumpier by the minute. He
Draco closed the laptop and put it on the coffee table. "Harry, I realise this will make me sound a bit pathetic, but I've been dying to ask... You've been to the Weasleys for Christmas every year since you left school, right? Apart from that one year you were talking about? I was just wondering... have you ever taken any of your
sex. I've loved everything we've done so far, and I want to carry on doing all that forever, but... I'm sort of dying to know what it'd be like if we, erm, fucked each other. But I'm worried that I'd do it wrong."
Harry looked at Draco, surprised.  “You... were talking about me before we reconnected?” he asked. “How come?”
didn't. I should've been at the Ministry, but I wasn't, and I didn't send any message. But Ron guessed, and covered for me, and he's been teasing me about it
Draco frowned. "Well, whatever it is you've got to get back for, I guarantee you will do it better if you've had something proper to eat. So staying for the buffet will actually save you time overall. In fact, I'm afraid I will have to insist. If we meet for the first time in years and immediately afterwards you pass out due to starvation, we both know who's going to get blamed, don't we?"
I hoped I'd get Harry in today, and I almost did, but not quite. He'll be at the start of tomorrow's chapter, though, I promise. And then things might actually start to
"You know you're always welcome here anytime, Harry; you don't have to officially invite yourself," said Hermione. "But I'm sorry we've stopped you speaking. I think it's maybe that Ron and I talk to each other so much that it's a nice change to have a different audience, so when we get you to ourselves we do rabbit on, don't we, Ron?"
"I was thinking of just casually walking along the road at first," said Draco uncertainly. "And then, if there's no trouble, maybe pop in one or two of the shops on the way back. What d'you think?"
want to see that film," said Harry. "But I'm actually enjoying my walk, now I'm out. D'you fancy walking a bit longer, while it's still light? We can go to a later showing."
"He also hates not having an actual toilet," Harry told the Malfoys, grinning. "You should have seen his face when he realised he had to go outside the tent and pull his pants down!"
"Mate, I think it's a brilliant idea," announced Ron. "And please believe me when I say that I'm fully aware of how bizarre it is that we're all now in this situation. If you'd told me when I was at school that... well, you get it. But, seriously, I think it would suit Harry perfectly. He's always loved doing stuff for his friends and family, and he's
Harry sighed. "I just got sick of it all. I always hated the attention, but I could see that it made people feel better to have a figurehead to pin their hopes on when Voldemort was around, so I didn't put up too much fuss. But I always thought the attention would stop after Voldemort was gone, and it didn't. It just got worse. There were still stories about me in the paper every day, even if I hadn't done anything. I tried just staying indoors as much as possible, but people kept writing to me, until I had to get all the owls diverted. And if I
he shouted, but there was a definite loud noise that emerged from his mouth – and Draco removed his mouth and looked up hesitantly. "Is this OK?" he asked. "I couldn't resist it any longer, but I can stop if you need me to."
"Well, I feel very honoured that I'm your first, especially given those reasons," said Harry. "You said 'not usually'. How did mine taste, then? … Don't worry, I won't take it personally if you didn't like it."
“Oh, it’s fine,” said Draco. “I’ve been thinking for a while that it would be nice to share it with Rabia. She’s one of our best friends and we know we can trust her. And I was about to say, Rabia, that the bit Harry hasn’t told you yet is that he’s pretty much the most powerful wizard in the world at the moment, so he can do magic without a wand that most of the rest of us can’t always do
that day. I did think about it once or twice after things calmed down a bit and I stopped having to hide from the press all the time, but by then it was months later and I think you'd already moved to France."
"Oh, only a couple of days," said Harry. "Tonight will be our third night. Teddy's going to go back to London in the morning, but I want to stay for another day or two at least. I'm enjoying myself."
"Well, I can't help noticing you're in bed with Draco bloody Malfoy," said Ron. "And once upon a time that would have been about as wrong as anything could be. But Teddy seems convinced that Draco's not all bad, so I thought I'd better check rather than just Stunning him while he was asleep."
"Not really," said Draco. "Everything about your life is a bit freaky, after all. You freak." He smirked, and Harry instantly felt better, for some reason.
of it. And you were amazing too, Rabia. I don't know how your fingers managed to move that fast. It was like magic!" At that, he glanced at Draco, who shook his head imperceptibly, smiling.
Draco beamed at him. "You know I love you so much all the time, but I have to say I love you even more when I realise you've actually paid attention to things I've told you," he said, before kissing him very thoroughly indeed.
"Come on through," said Molly. "Everyone's in the kitchen. But, Harry, before we go in... I'm sorry for what my daughter tried to do. She just wasn't thinking clearly. She never meant to hurt you. Having said that, I think it's probably a good thing that this happened – well, apart from the fact that you're now unintentionally bonded – because you were never going to break up with her, were you? And it was obvious to everyone except you and Ginny that it wasn't working any more."
come out of that relationship was that I knew I was definitely gay – it had never occurred to me before, but things just felt right in a way that they never did with Ginny."
," yelled Harry, and held out a sack, into which all the students' wands obligingly flew. They looked at him for a moment, betrayed, but then burst into applause. He grinned sheepishly.
guessed that, but I didn't mean to pressure you into speaking about it before you were ready. I shouldn't have mentioned the Molly-Bella incident. I wasn't thinking. Sorry."
"We do, don’t we? Maybe we’ve both grown up. Yes, please, a drink would be great. I want to know how you ended up here."
Deciding that there was nothing to be gained by putting it off, he crossed the square, climbed the few steps to the door of Number Twelve, and then grabbed the railing in a panic as he lost his footing on the icy top step. He managed to steady himself just in time, and smiled ruefully at the thought of replicating Hermione's accident.
Draco smiled at them both, and then found himself grabbing hold of Hermione’s arm to steady her as she appeared in their midst. She raised her eyebrows at the sight of Rabia, whose jaw had dropped again.
that many other partners," he said. "But, no. None of them were serious, and I've never taken anyone else to the Burrow. And I can guess what your next questions will be: yes, Ginny will be there tomorrow, and yes, I think she'll be fine with you. I know Ron's told the whole family about us, so she won't be surprised."
Draco, in fact, felt oddly lost for words. After a brief bit of introspection, he realised that this was because he wanted the first thing he said to Harry in seventeen years to be somehow memorable. He laughed at the ridiculousness of this, and Harry glanced at him quizzically.
He weaved his way across the foyer through the gushing crowds emerging from the inner hall, and stepped outside. The instant temperature drop was more dramatic than he'd been expecting, despite having noticed from inside that it was snowing. Wishing he'd brought a hat, he rearranged his scarf so that it at least partly covered his ears, jammed his gloved hands in his coat pockets, and set off down Exhibition Road. Usually, when visiting the Royal Albert Hall, he liked to have a wander through Kensington Gardens afterwards, but it was much too cold for that, so he'd already decided to head straight for the Tube.
"Well, I first got to know him as Mr Potter when I became friends with Al in first year, and it wasn't till second year that he became a teacher and I had to call him Professor Potter at school. But I still call him Mr Potter when I'm at Al's house in the holidays."
Teddy laughed. "Sure," he said. "Harry taught me a couple of years ago. It's really useful. And everyone else in my class is
a slight change to the format this time. They've decided that there's a whole category of voters that they're not paying enough attention to, so there's an additional speaker today, and he'll go right before you. Just thought I'd better warn you first, because it's probably a few years since you've seen him, and I'm not sure how you'll feel about it."
"Don't worry, it's just a sign that the world has in fact ended and this is the afterlife," said Draco to Neville, jolting Harry out of his reverie. "Anything might happen from now on."
it was over. He just stopped responding to any attempt I made to contact him. I haven't seen or heard from him in nearly three years."
"Erm," said Harry. "I don't think I had, no. And I feel awful that I haven't asked this until now, but... are
"You haven’t really kept in touch with him since school, then, I’m gathering?" said Harry. "That surprises me – you used to be quite close, didn’t you?"
"They have a temporary one at Spinningfields every Christmas," Draco told him. "It’s been open for the last few weeks, but I haven’t been yet this year. Are you up for it?"
go out, it was a nightmare, so I had to stop doing that. It was slightly better at work, because I knew lots of the Aurors personally, so they were a bit more laid-back about me being around. But I found being an Auror really frustrating for different reasons. If it had just been about catching bad guys, that would have been fine. But there were all these rules and procedures and targets and risk assessments, and I hated all that. The last straw was when Kingsley told me that I'd have to stick to a desk-based role until the public had lost interest in me, because every time I went out on a raid it turned into a media circus. I quit the Aurors the next day, and although I hadn't planned to leave the wizarding world at the same time, it just seemed like the best solution when I thought about it."
Draco grinned and reached inside his coat for it. Hermione's jaw dropped open as she took it. "Malfoy, I take back anything I've ever said about you," she said, smiling. "Thank you so much. Does that mean my other stuff is here too?" Her eyes widened as Draco nodded towards the pile of bags under the chair.
"I'm in the middle of Westminster Bridge. And, yes please. Quite apart from the fact that I want to get my hands on your body, I need you to explain how this snowman got into this phone box."
worked fine (and the coffee was better), so then I started buying all sorts of things. Books, especially, that I could take home and read: the most useful one I found was a book that gave advice to new university students moving away from home for the first time. That's how I found out how to rent a flat."
Ron was about to answer, but Draco beat him to it. "Wait a minute," he said. "I appreciate you speaking on my behalf, Harry, but I think I want to say something too." And he crawled out of the sleeping bag and stood at Harry's side.
done, or Al or Lily. But you've been like that for as long as I can remember, whereas I've only noticed this summer that Mum seems much happier than you do, even though she never talks to you. She smiles all the time – in fact, I think she smiles more when you're
"I don't know how much I've changed since I last saw you," mused Harry. "Maybe you can tell me, after we've talked. But mainly I was just intrigued. I have no idea what you've been doing since we left school, and I hadn't realised I
Harry looked out over the icy water. "This park reminds me of Hogwarts grounds, a bit," he said. "At least, in the snow it does. The Black Lake is similar in shape to this one, isn't it?"
"I'd have been OK with that," said Draco, grinning. "In the meantime, please do continue telling me how amazing I am, I'm enjoying it
leave, wearing this hoodie with the hood up, and Ron and Hermione leave with me, I think there's a pretty good chance your stalkers will think I'm you, and follow us. All you have to do is wait a few minutes while we lead them away, and then you can escape and get some time to yourself."
"Well, yeah, but I think we both knew at the time that there was more to it than that, even if we never discussed it," said Ron. "And after he told us he was gay, everything made a lot more sense."
no friends, before Hogwarts. Everyone seemed to think that the cupboard was the worst part, but I couldn't stop thinking about the times I'd watched you eat, without realising that you'd grown up with hardly any food."
"You're all happy with those pairings?" asked McGonagall, looking round at the girls. When they all nodded, she continued, "Excellent. In that case, please make your way to the cloisters and choose your rooms, and I will be along shortly to check that all is well. The rooms are all identical, so I don't think you'll be gaining any advantage over the boys by having first choice."
Harry jumped back onto the bed and wrapped his arms around Draco, kissing him all over his face. Their cocks rubbed up against each other in the process, and this frottage intensified rapidly until they both came again, moments later.
By the time Harry next saw Draco, the sun was setting. Harry was just finishing a large helping of treacle tart when Draco came in and joined him on the sofa; Harry was very pleased to see him, and not just because of the distraction from his current state of mind. He smiled welcomingly, wondering how Draco managed to still look so good after a day's teaching.
"His name is Spike; he just wandered in one day, not long after I moved here, and he's never really left since," said Draco.
"I told you he'd listen to you," she said. "The two of you do seem to be getting on better than I thought you would, though."
," Draco told him, closing the oven door and sitting down. "I don't recommend it. But there's a thing on at college tomorrow and we're all supposed to bring something."
a good idea, and I’ve been here ever since," said Draco, who was apparently quite amused at Harry’s slurping, if the look on his face was anything to go by. "It just seemed like a good idea to make a break after the war, and get away from all the places where I was well-known for all the wrong reasons. But I wanted to be in a big city, so since London was out of the question it seemed obvious to try Manchester. I was told the wizarding community here is very welcoming, and that’s definitely true."
"London, obviously," said Harry. "I've got plenty at Grimmauld Place. Actually, I'd like to check on Teddy in any case. And it might be a good idea to pop in to see Ron and Hermione before he gets himself in another state."
As he finished, he found Harry gazing at him. Draco gazed back, feeling his face redden, but then Harry collapsed in giggles. "This is now the official most unlikely moment of my life," he managed to get out. "If you'd told me, when we were at school, that one day I'd be walking through London in the middle of the night with Draco Malfoy singing me a song about Christmas crackers, I'd have thought you'd gone mad."
"Since it’s probably not curse-related, that’s exactly what it means," Draco confirmed. "Sorry. But there are various strategies that tend to help with naturally-occurring sleep problems. One of the best is exercise. How much exercise have you had today?"
Draco smiled at him. “Thanks for the consideration, but I’d love it if you stayed,” he said. “I’m not going to practise all night – just an hour so, maybe a bit longer if I can get hold of Rabia – so I’ll be home before you will.”
In the kitchen, it appeared at first glance as if every available surface was covered in food. There were several trays of gingerbread men with snowman icing, a huge dish of roast potatoes, smaller bowls of peas and carrots and Brussels sprouts, trays of Yorkshire puddings, and several jugs containing gravy and other sauces. The table in the middle of the room was dominated by a very large roasted turkey, which Ron was in the middle of carving. He looked up as they entered.
The first-years (Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, including the Weasley boy) had been lovely; they were really cute, in fact, although Draco decided that he probably wouldn't be repeating that thought to anyone else. He'd been lulled into a false sense of security, in fact, just in time for his last lesson of the day: the current nightmare, also known as third-year Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff.
