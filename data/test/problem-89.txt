With all the clothes separating them both to each other, Dracy still felt so bared. She gulped when Harry laid a palm on her left arm, gliding it down, his warmth seeping in inside her.
He sighed as he felt fingers drawing circles on his waist, dipping heavier to feel more of his skin. It feels good like always whenever they cuddle. The warmth, his body heat and the steely gentleness that prickle him deep to the bone.
“Welcome back, Harry”
The laptop loaded up fast and he rejoiced when he finally saw the wallscreen, files displayed on the desktop with names he can understand and some were numbers he cannot really decipher.
Harry walked and laid him on the couch. He sucked on Draco’s bottom lip and afterwards, played with it.
“M-moony” Sirius stammered, his gaze unfaltering. A smirk wanted to get past his lips but he isn’t going to break any rules tonight.
They were enjoying a fun time at dinner, ignoring all around them as McGonagall and Flitwick inspect the tree with critical judgment. Draco knew then they are doomed but that’s to expect if the Headmistress and the Professor literally hired the disaster squad.
And he is nearly blaming himself.
“In weeks time, a primitive face will take form with large dark circles for eyes. The mouth, lower jaw, and throat are developing. Blood cells are taking shape and circulation will begin.  The tiny "heart" tube will beat 65 times a minute by the end of the fourth week. So by the end of the first month, your baby will be about 1/4 inch long”
“Well, as far as I remember, the file says the 15
(See the end of the chapter for
And he doesn’t want to upset Dracy with emotional turmoil if he fails to meet her expectations to be her Alpha lover. Maybe marking her is something he really didn’t consider before he made a decision of getting her out of that stinky bar.
Remind him to change such attitudes and traditions in their house. He looked down at his papers and felt himself get dizzy at the realization that he has other ten cases to handle and Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy's insistence is delaying him to finish an actual work.
"Mmm" he moaned, ignoring how fast Harry is driving and how good it is to be riding with him because right at the moment, he's wondering how exquisite would be to ride him instead.
“Harry” she whimpered.
“Green!” he exclaimed impatiently, “Please, it hurts, daddy. Please touch me”
It had been hours of teasing touches.
Robards probably does feel the need to prove Harry can play nice.
‘Where
become an Auror a few years later than Harry and his friends, but Harry always assumed that was something to do with his bail, or the terms of his release from Azkaban. He’s never given it much thought, really. ‘I assumed you were busy with running the Manor, or something,’ he mumbles instead.
Harry knew she was right. Barely an hour after the press ambush at the Ministry, Robards’ owl had appeared at the cottage boundary. It was a letter assuring Harry that the DMLE and the Ministry would be putting out a press release in support of Harry, that his job was safe and they’d be standing by him.
Harry lets Ron hug him, breathing in the familiar smell of him, of mint and freshly mown grass. Usually, Ron was right - his presence, these kind of embraces, were usually the only thing that could ease a little of Harry’s spikiness this close to the moon.
‘You want a taste, Potter?’
,’ Harry snarls, anger flooding his veins. The Head Auror has kept Malfoy’s expertise a secret from all of them, then. He feels himself bristle, his wolf - earlier placated by the improved Wolfsbane - awake and aggressive once more. Harry’s magic flares at his fingertips, and he considers Apparating straight back to the DMLE, to charge into Robards’ office and demand to know why Malfoy has been overlooked and under-used time and time again.
Long, and lean, and wrapped in tight black trousers, tapering to his ankle where he wore a pair of black leather ankle boots with a high, thin heel.
It was him -
Chastised, I close my laptop.
Harry thinks back over all the Potions-related cases they’ve had in the past, where an in-house expert would have helped cut case completion times drastically. And then there’s the emergency Potions kits they hand out to field agents, and how they’re often depleted and under-stocked.
‘Cuppa and a slice of cake?’ he asks hopefully, and Harry smiles and nods. He put Malfoy, and the question of
His wolf whined anxiously, and Harry re-focused. He still wasn’t convinced Draco wasn’t in danger somewhere, and he turned his glare onto Robards, silently willing him to hurry along.
Long, and lean, and wrapped in tight black trousers, tapering to his ankle where he wore a pair of black leather ankle boots with a high, thin heel.
Chapter 20: Blanket Fort
Harry was so lulled into a sense of security by Draco’s mere physical presence, he was utterly unprepared for what happened next.

Potter looked at Draco as if he were an angel, rather than a demon.

The day of the full moon dawns, and Harry wakes slowly, sleepily rutting against the
‘Please, Harry,’ Draco begs, brokenly. ‘Let me let you go.’
‘I’ll be home in an hour,’ Draco said, straightening his cloak and flashing his silver eyes over them both. ‘Be good.’ And then he was gone, in a flash of green flames through the Floo.
The scars and the Mark and the bruises from Harry’s mouth are covered once more, a secret only the two of them share.
Harry soon knew when to soothe and when to challenge.
, Harry, but he found out who did it, and — look, just get here, okay? Right away!’
Day 7: Blaise x Draco - Somnophilia
‘Great,’ Draco mutters under his breath as he leaves the office, so quietly only Harry’s werewolf ears could pick it up.
‘Honestly, Potter,’ Draco says softly, taking his elbow and helping him to his feet. ‘I thought werewolves were supposed to be able to handle their liquor.’
Draco’s back arches, and when his hips push against Harry’s, Harry is delighted to feel Draco is as hard as he is.
‘Well, well, pretty boy. Finally awake, are ya?’
Draco smiles as she moves closer, her lips brushing his.
did you see him?
He looked gorgeous, and Hermione squirmed in her seat at the table, work forgotten in front of her, as she ached to run her fingers over him.
Harry opens his mouth, whether to say something or suck a bruise into Draco’s throat, he’s not sure. Before he can do either, twilight fades and the moon rises, and Harry drops to his knees with a grunt of pain.
It takes but three words for you to drop to your knees, helpless and pliant, before him. He smiles, a benevolent god, gazing at you with hot silver eyes, white-blond hair artfully tousled from your earlier caresses. He lets one long, elegant finger trail over your chest.
Hermione was torn. Draco had told her to wait, and to be waiting for him when he got back. And he
‘Whatever you’re thinking, Potter,’ Draco whispers, his voice rough and raw, ‘
From her chair, Hermione looks up and sighs quietly. ‘Harry,’ she starts, in her calmest voice. ‘I know you don’t want to, but I really think we should talk about Mal—’
Pansy wasn’t sure which she liked the best, really.
.’ His hands clench into fists, and even Ron looks alarmed as Harry advances on Robards.
Charlie Weasley, fresh from Romania, chuckled and let his mother hug him for several long minutes, before he gently unwound her arms from his waist. ‘Good to see you too, Mum,’ he smiled, then his eyes flitted upwards. They sparkled as they ran over his family, before settling on Draco, hovering towards the back of the crowd.
Their deepest desires, exposed and laid bare.
‘Auror Potter,’ he greeted him. ‘Junior Auror Malfoy.’
Harry grabs Draco, tries to kiss him.
put Draco in that kind of unnecessary danger again,’ Harry warned, his voice low and trembling with the constraint he was battling to keep in place. ‘I will rip you, limb from limb. You understand me?’
‘Oh, god, Draco,’ he moaned, shaky and sensitive, a supplicant before him. ‘You’re -
I nod, a smile on my lips, and he drops his head eagerly to lick my skin clean.
Harry was used to the smell of fear. Even though people didn’t know what he was, most of them could sense something about him, something strange, something dangerous. Even the Muggles seemed to sense it. If he didn’t keep a tight control on his emotions, he noticed people cower away, the air sharpened with the sour smell of terror, when he spoke or moved.
Uncomfortably aware that he’d been staring openly at Malfoy’s dick for a good few seconds, Harry gulped and pulled his eyes back up to Malfoy’s face. His smirk had grown wider, and his cock was as hard as it had been when Harry first walked in.

Chapter 2: Joy
they were so tight
‘You’re going to tell me when, Potter,’ Draco said firmly, and - not for the first time - Hermione admired the level of control he held, even as he was fucking Harry, even as his eyes travelled over Hermione’s naked body sprawled before him.
Hermione loved how much she still wanted them, how much they wanted her, even after a wonderful decade of marriage.
Day 24: Draco x Harry - Legilimency
Harry groaned again, his breath catching, the tell-tale sound pausing as he held himself still, the way he had to when he was too close to coming. Hermione bit her lip, opening one eye enough to squint at the time on the carriage clock on the bookshelf. She cursed under her breath when she realised Draco had only been gone fifteen minutes.
It had taken a long while to get used to Harry calling him Draco, shouting at him with affection instead of hatred, back at the beginning. Now, those days of rivalry were a distant, blurred memory; a time not worth remembering.
Chapter 18: Before You Go
‘Merlin,’ Draco murmurs, and Harry looks up again, wanting to see what Draco is thinking. His brows are drawn over his silver eyes, and understanding dawns in his gaze. ‘No one else knows, do they?’
If she was good, then when he was finally finished his paperwork Percy would fuck her mouth, or maybe even bend her over his desk to take her.
fucking hot.’
Potter’s grin is predatory. It sends delicious shivers down Draco’s spine.
Harry sighed and squirmed and panted, sweat glistening on his forehead, his muscles trembling. Hermione could see how close he was, in the tight lines of his body, the tension in his jaw, the bite of his fingers in her soft flesh. He groaned and gasped, his heavy eyes flying open.
‘Potter.’ Malfoy answers the door, dishevelled and flushed with pride. The party rages on in the dungeon behind him. ’You aren’t exactly on the guest list.’
Harry grit his teeth so hard his jaws hurt. ‘
before tossing it on the floor. He grabbed Harry’s hair, yanking him up into a sitting position and depositing Hermione next to him.
dinner!’ Molly’s attention snapped to Harry, whose innocent green eyes did nothing to belie his bulging cheeks and the smear of pink icing on his lips. He held his hands up in mock surrender, his eyes alight with laughter, and swallowed the pilfered cake.
‘See, Potter,’ Draco murmured, reaching back around to grasp hold of him, Harry gasping against Hermione’s cunt. ‘You
headlines that would cause. Ron gave him another look of concern, and Harry works hard not to snarl in his direction.
For a brief moment Harry’s wolf tries to surge to the surface, anger rushing through his veins, wanting to Apparate back to the DMLE and lay his hands back on the ones who did this, who made his mate suffer in this terrible way.
Draco Malfoy’s fingers brush yours.
‘We never planned on
Chapter 11: Partycrashers
‘Harry?’ Harry opens his eyes, not having realised he closed them. Draco is looking up at him, concern flashing through his eyes. He reaches up, brushes a stray lock of hair back off Harry’s forehead. ‘Are you all right?’
They’re on patrol again in the early evening. By now Harry is starting to enjoy it, the freedom from the office, the familiar loops around Diagon and Horizont, the diversions into Knockturn. He realises he even quite likes having Malfoy by his side, his presence almost comforting. They walk shoulder to shoulder, always with Malfoy to Harry’s left, making the most of his left-handed advantage in the case of needing to use their wands. Harry waves his hand to cast a surreptitious
His shoulders are stiff, he’s tensed and currently uptight. He needs to loosen up but the recoil inside him is not helping.
He brushed Draco’s statement off as he continued to urge him to come down from the counter he’s standing on with a glass of alcohol as he screamed and screamed to his heart’s content.
“Do you want to go?” Harry asked, moving a hand to brush Draco’s silky hair.
“Hey, hey. Calm down there” he chuckled, straightening up to help her, “Alright, there?” he pressed a thumb on her chin.
“So good, omega” Harry said, letting her go down of her high and when she finished, Harry began to thrust his hips rougher until he had finally chased his own orgasm. Groaning above Dracy’s head.
“Who doesn’t know this famous blogger who recommended to spread hate than love? You’re all over the internet, love”
Draco is drooling. He felt himself gulped from the morning view that greeted him when he awoke by the sound of Harry opening his bedroom door a little louder than necessary. That body is a wonderland. It's a magic on its own. Harry really is perfect and his past lovers or sexual partners must be left utterly satisfied. Draco frowned at the thought. He didn't quite like the idea of Harry bedding other people. He should be exclusive and highly confidential. Not just for anyone because that body is luxurious, expensive, extremely high-end.
He squealed when Harry relented, paying for a two rounds of the game, which consisted of three spears per round. The dragon balls are wiggly on their places at the board, filled with different colors but nothing to give away whether the contents are nice or bad.
Harry smirked, “Just tipsy”
She looked around as they arrived at the little bookstore. There’s really not much people inside and she was relieved to know she can wander around without the prying eyes following her moves. Harry led her to the aisle where they could read more about her pregnancy and grabbing five different kinds of books.
For now? Does that mean Harry really is willing to act on his affections? And what affections?
Remus sighed. When he was satisfied, he pulled them out, quickly catching him when Sirius’ knees gave out. He smirked. Sirius’ ruined and debauched look is even more a sight.
“Come on, baby. Wanna see you come apart. Cum for me, darlin’” he whispered, biting on her collarbone and just then, Dracy cried as she gushed out around him, clenching around him tightly and prompting for him to shoot his load inside her.
He gripped his luggage tight as his other hand adjusted the ridicule black wig he was required to wear for his disguise.
Draco bit his lip. Merlin, bless him. Harry is so hot. So sexy, so captivating, so steamy.
“Yes, sir” he agreed, his voice void of anything but the intention to earn more affection, give room so he could find solutions to this monster of a man.
“Good morning” he said and pulled back.
Harry raised his head at the sound of his voice.
“Can’t believe you’re round with our little beanie, baby. All soft and swelling” he cannot help the chuckle that sneak its way out of his mouth at the way Dracy leaned her back to his front and looked up.
The answer would be. . . he doesn’t know.
“Harry” she preened, her breath catching on her lungs as she pushed her chest to his hands. Desperation washed over her at the smell of her arousal. She knew Andy will be smelling if she is to step inside her office.
The one he dreamt he kissed. The one that kissed his forehead. The one he imagined would feel nice with his own. He's probably being too unrealistic but being near him like this was taking things out of his control.
“If you’re unsure on the process, there are books you can read on to help and guide you” she recommended before flicking her wand again and the image disappeared. Harry helped Dracy to sit up and slid an arm around her shoulder, running his hand up and down her arms in a soothing manner.
“Har—p-please”
“How about I make you a nice hot cup of cocoa?”
Sirius didn’t respond to Lily right away. The words falling alongside his tongue, his mind twirling and trying to decide how to blurt out the favor that’s not actually a favor.
"We'll leave our son in your hands, Harry" Narcissa spoke gracefully and she gave him a small smile which he returned easily and nodding, "Expect a good guard, Mrs. Malfoy"
“What a damn playboy! Seriously no manners at all! A fool who can’t even read French! That nightmare of a smirk! And those ridiculous bulge! Wow! A lunatic”
Harry nodded and took one more step closer, chest nearly bumping to his. His fingers slid up to his elbow to his biceps until it reached his shoulders to his neck. Light touches that do nothing but send tingling sensations across his body.
“Daddy”
Dracy cannot stop whimpering. The feeling of having a cock buried inside her, on heat is comforting and relaxing. For the very first time, she experienced what it is like to be in heat and having an Alpha try to ease you from suffering. She moaned wantonly. Harry’s controlled strength so he wouldn’t crush her followed by his pounding after pounding was fascinating.
“I think that’s true”
Her smell was filled of comforting smell, cinnamon and lavender that equally mixed just right. It was something he never smelled from other Omegas.
Draco nodded, “I would love to, daddy” he said, loving the idea of Harry’s cock inside him all night.
One thing Harry did not expect he will have one day. A family. This is a family he—they are building, creating and shaping. He wrapped a hand around her waist to pull her closer as he continued to talk with Ron.
He threw the pillow on his side and tried to wipe the tears away from his eyes. Now, he knows how it feels to be rejected. He feared of what come with this.
The two were sleeping peacefully. They are cuddled close and tight to one another. It was such a sight as Neville signed with his index finger to keep quiet as Ginny ushered them away soundlessly.
“R-really?” she asked so innocently that Harry loved the way it looked on her.
He watched him closed his eyes, too mellow with him. He cannot believe to be in Harry’s arms is just as freeing as his warmth. When he noticed Harry’s breathing evened out was the time he only let himself go in slumber,
He just the person in his dreams. That look, that expression, and his moans. Fuck he wanted to have Draco now.
“Have you discovered the gender yet?” she asked.
She wiped the sweat on her forehead, starting to feel slick dripping out of her hole into her sheets. She whimpered and cried out. Harry. She needs Harry. She wants him.
Her fingers found their way to her nape where she had been marked on the day of their honeymoon. Harry had claimed was his plan all along. Mark her on her honeymoon. She was ecstatic upon receiving his mark and was even more when Harry asked her to mark him back.
“Go back—
“Even better if the chair’s lavender”
Maybe what they really need was communication and glad they were able to settle the issue Harry have been avoiding for days. Draco has been such a challenge for him that he questioned his own morals and his ability to follow them and now, he finally had accepted that maybe this is what he really wanted.
She noticed it too. She became a little hornier and needier. No harm because Harry’s attention is focused on her 24/7, she gets to kiss him whenever she wants but there’s not even just a single time she was the one to initiate some things. And never did Harry ask.
His lips parted, already feeling so desperate as he lubed the dildo and pulled his fingers out. Bracing himself on the table, he opened his legs even more, letting his daddy get a view of his puckered hole, ready and clenching with nothing.
He can feel it.
“I’m sorry, sir” he cried on his chest.
“Fill me up, please. Wanna feel you cum inside me, please” he mumbled tirelessly, his breathing growing heavier as seconds go by. Whole body afloat as relish in post-orgasmic bliss.
“What did I say? Not a word” Harry chastised, pulling back inches away and gave him a stern glance, “We surely have to teach you some manners”
“Oki! Oki! Oki!” the three sang in unison before making their way to wash up and Leo sitting down to continue his book. Their little book lover.
He grunted as cold towel cleaned him up before he felt himself being carried. He sighed softly when he felt his back touching his soft mattress, body wrapped in a relaxing blanket and as his eyes steadily dropped, he forced them back open.
Dracy’s eyes shot up and she quickly shook her head, “No, no. I’m just saying it’s enough” she whispered.
The party was about a charity event Tom hosted on his name. Something that Draco thought is just a kindness cover of what’s really underneath his fingertips.
Dobby nodded, “Yes sir”
“We’re out of here, Draco” Harry said roughly, impatiently waving a hand to get the bill, “And I will certainly have fun with you. Too much fun”
Harry looked up.
, Potter,’ Draco drawls. ‘I
‘Couldn’t wait?’ he manages to say with a modicum of condescension, making Harry grin. He reaches down and kisses the tip of Draco’s nose.
, please…
‘It’s good to see you,’ she breathes happily, not releasing her hold on him, and Harry smiles against her curls.
‘And you take it every night for a week before the full moon?’ Draco’s face was intense as he asked, and Harry could practically see him make notes in his mind as they spoke.
. Draco tears his eyes away before Potter notices him staring, looking blankly down at his own paperwork. Another half an hour and he could leave, able to hurry back to his flat and wallow in his loneliness.
- sitting with Pansy Parkinson, smiling as they spoke. His hair was as icy as always, artfully styled, and Harry could see a plethora of silver earrings adorning his ear. A tight, black t-shirt stretched over his chest - Harry ached to run his fingers over the material, feeling the hardness of the body beneath - but it was Malfoy’s legs that Harry couldn’t tear his eyes away from.
Draco pulls them both close, and sighs happily.
As if it hadn’t been bad enough back when he was merely a repentant Death Eater, trying to survive after the war.
‘Hmm,’ Draco hums as Harry reaches around to take hold of his half-hard cock, lazily working him up and down a few times. He arches his back, lifts his arm behind him so he can grab a handful of Harry’s hair and hold his mouth to his neck. ‘On second thoughts, maybe the tea can wait.’
Nothing, except death.
‘Nothing more terrible than having to work with the very buff, very handsome, Saviour of the Wizarding World, that’s for sure,’ Pansy comments archly, raising a pointed eyebrow. Draco just glares at her and downs his Firewhisky. Pansy sighs, flicking her wand so the entire bottle makes it way over to him. ‘Jokes aside, Draco, what did you expect when you decide to become an Auror? You knew full well you’d have to be working in the same department as him and his entourage.’ Pansy finishes her own Firewhisky, grimacing as she swallows, and then pours herself an iced ruby mead instead. The thick liquid looks like blood in her glass, and she saunters over and drops onto the sofa next to Draco, kicking off her high-heeled shoes and lifting her feet into Draco’s lap.
The second hooded figure almost stumbles as she passes them, and replies to her partner. ‘He’s not bloody well here now, is he?’ she snarls. ‘Better not tell him we had a chance and lost it. He’ll be angry…’ Her next words are swallowed by the walls as she moves past them.
He knew he wasn’t going to be able to go slow, this first time, to tease and taste all of Draco.
‘I’m sorry,’ she whispered, contrite. ‘I tried to say no, but…’ she trailed off and looked back at Draco, leaning forward to nuzzle into his neck. ‘Please, sir,’ she whispered, wanting to make it up to him. ‘Please, don’t be mad.’
‘It’s Scorp’s first time staying at Grimmauld. I really want him to like it here.’
He didn’t fool Harry.
It stretches across his chest, dark and possessive, from his sternum to his shoulder, tilted as if the axis of the world is askew.
‘Look at you, Potter.’ Harry opens his eyes. Draco Malfoy looks down at him, hair dishevelled, his silver-scarred chest bare. ‘Begging me as if you don’t
‘Together?’ he offers, and Draco only hesitates for half a heartbeat before stepping forward and laying a tentative hand on Harry’s forearm.
Could it be possible that he, Harry, also fancied Draco?
helpless on his breathless lips.
They weren’t late to the Burrow, in the end. Draco privately thought that it would be impossible to be late to the Burrow. Any time was the right time to turn up at the Weasley household. Draco followed Harry through the Floo, straight into the kitchen. As usual, it was warm and busy and filled with the rich, fragrant scent of Molly Weasley’s cooking.
As if his words are enough, Draco groans and pushes into Harry’s fist, as hot ropes of come burst from him, covering both their stomachs.
! We had to defend ourselves!’
‘Come for me, Draco,’ Harry orders, his lips brushing the shell of Draco’s ear. Draco groans and arches, his cock pulsing in Harry’s hand as he comes with a cry, spilling hot come onto Harry’s skin.
Her eyes were closed, her head thrown back in pleasure, when the Floo flared to life.
Legilimency, legilimency sex, trust, established relationship, Draco x Harry, drabble
, at least, Hermione.’ Draco unclasped his cloak, letting it float to the ground, and started to roll up his white shirtsleeves.
NON-CON, non-con somnophilia, somnophilia, sleeping Draco, bed-sharing, oral sex, Draco x Blaise
When he opened his eyes again, breathing heavily and feeling like he was drifting down from a cloud, Draco was sprawled beneath him. His eyes flashed silver, his mouth quirked into a lazy smile, his ice-blond hair as messy as Harry had ever seen it. It sent a thrill through his tired body that he was seeing a private, vulnerable part of Draco.
Harry sighs and casts a sideways look at Malfoy. Grey eyes met green, and Harry saw the same irritable resignation he felt reflected back at him.
Harry knows, from the silence that lingers between him and Ron, that he is being unreasonably irritable. They’re in the Ministry cafeteria drinking weak tea and sharing a slice of lemon drizzle cake, and Ron keeps giving him what he clearly thinks is a surreptitious look of worry.
Harry stares in silence for a few long moments, his mind untangling the words Malfoy has just imparted on him.
Just like an overgrown puppy.
Chapter 16: When the Party's Over
Harry laughs and gently grips Draco’s chin, pulling his face up for a long, languorous kiss. ‘Coming right up, my lord,’ he replies sarcastically, secretly pleased to hear Draco laugh as Harry reluctantly climbs out of bed.
He doesn’t need to be in here this morning, not really, but Potter has been sitting next to him, ignoring him - again - and being dark and brooding, and it’s all a bit too much. So, as soon as he had a big enough stack of files, Draco escapes to the quiet confines of his old sanctuary.
Day 2: Draco x Hermione - Clothed Sex
Draco lets out a low, affectionate laugh. ‘I have to say, you’re giving me pretty mixed signals, Harry.’ Harry just huffs and breathes in the scent at Draco’s neck, feeling the pulse of his artery against his lips.
: Harry’s bed, messy and sex-tumbled, with Draco naked and spread out beneath him.
By Monday morning, Harry’s feelings have coalesced into a raging maelstrom of aggravation. He glowers at Malfoy as he storms in, ignoring the twinge of guilt as the warm smile falters on Malfoy’s face. Too late he notices his partner offering him some tea, in a paper Brewmsticks cup, that he must have picked up especially for him on the way into work. Harry snatches it, mutters a reluctant thanks, and collapses into his chair.
Potter turns his head to watch them pass, and Draco feels Potter’s nose nudge the back of his neck. His fingers at Draco’s waist contract slightly, and stroke across the expanse of Draco’s stomach. Draco’s heart stutters uncomfortably as he shivers beneath Potter’s touch.
Draco gave him another gentle slap. ‘Why don’t you give Granger some attention,’ Draco chided and Hermione fell back against the arm rest, letting Harry push her thighs wider so he could latch his mouth onto her again. He was more desperate than before, his tongue less controlled, messy and frantic. Hermione kept her hands in his hair, and her eyes on Draco, her breathing shortening as her body, already so sensitive, responded to Harry’s touch.
before, and he finds he doesn’t like the thought of outright denying that part of himself.
And none of it had actually been as bad as Harry had expected. Sure, Malfoy still wound him up something rotten, and they often ended up bickering at their desks, but it was… different. Wildly different from when they’d been at Hogwarts, and the antagonism was cruel, bitter, poisonous.
It was an easy decision to have a quiet wedding, just the two of them. In the wilds of Romania they were married by Charlie Weasley, while a pair of Horntails chased each other playfully through the skies above.
Day 1: Draco x Theo - Praise Kink
Shows him how a modified
Draco groans weakly.
It was the weak-eyed, mousy-haired man from before. The one who’d cast the Cruciatus on him, over and over again, as his two sniggering friends held Draco under a double
It never took long before Draco was fully hard, and Blaise had him deep in his throat. Often Draco would groan in his sleep, or flex his hips, or once - to Blaise’s delight - unconsciously reach down and grab hold of Blaise’s hair.
I was stupid to trust you.’
Harry always takes a deep breath of clean air before walking into the Auror bullpen.
You push him back against the pillows and kiss each star, a map across the heaven of his body, your namesake tattooed into his very skin.
Dinner was the usual affair. The conversation was loud and happy and teasing, the food was rich and filling and plentiful. Harry sat next to Draco, as he always did at group meals, so he could stroke Draco’s thigh beneath the table in between bites of food. Charlie was opposite him, and he and Draco talked for a while — as best they could over the noise — about the new dragon Healing cases that had happened recently at the reserve. When the food was finished and no-one, even Ron, could be tempted with more, Molly waved her wand to clear the table. As soon as the dirty dishes and half-empty tureens marched into the kitchen, the desserts marched themselves in. Ron’s eyes lit up and he eagerly reached for the nearest plate of cupcakes.
night.’
Harry has the good grace to look abashed, flashing Draco a guilty smile. ‘Er, yeah,’ he admits. ‘I try not to — I don’t want people to think I’m a show-off, you know?’
came to
And only a few hours walking side by side through the wizarding quarter was the only thing standing in his way.
The magic in his veins.
‘Potter,’ Draco replies civilly, priding himself on the mildness of his own tone compared to Potter.
‘Potter,’ he states, needlessly, and Harry drops lower into his crouch and growls. ‘At last, we meet.’ Harry scoffs and takes a step forward, making the other man stumble backwards in alarm.
your arousal when I’m near.’
‘Merlin,
Harry was on his feet and halfway to the Floo before he was conscious of even moving. He grabs a handful of powder, meeting Hermione’s worried gaze as he calls out for the Ministry. He storms through the Atrium, taking the stairs instead of waiting for an elevator, his thighs barely burning as he takes them two at a time. He bursts into the DMLE, and straight into Ron’s arms.
Harry is the saviour, the golden boy, an Auror: a protector of the innocent. For a man like him - a man like no other - to be afflicted with a disease that makes even Muggles uneasy around him is an absolute tragedy.
But right now, Harry was feeling pretty good. He could still feel the wolf, pacing just beneath the surface, and he knew full well if anyone tried to dominate him or threaten any of his pack right now the wolf would break free.
Harry sighs, rolling his eyes. ‘Fine, Malfoy. How did you
taste like Firewhisky, delicious and smoky, and Harry deepened the kiss, Draco willingly opening further for him. Draco ran his palms up along Harry’s chest, making Harry whine into his mouth as he brushed over a stiffening nipple. He could feel the curve of Draco’s smirk at that, and he hissed as Draco pinched his nipple, hard, sending a jolt of pleasure that bordered on pain down Harry’s stomach and straight into his groin. He pulled away, nuzzling against Draco’s neck instead, before licking along the shell of his ear, the cold taste of metal from his earrings bitter on Harry’s tongue.
, what he’s thinking of doing, but it’s certainly going to be challenging enough to keep him busy for a while.
Sparks fly.
Chapter 3: Evergreen
‘Bloody charming,’ Ginny muttered, but without any actual anger. Draco had spent six months in Romania at the reserve as he worked towards his Magical Creature Care Mastery: he needed both that and Potions to become a magical creature Healer. To his surprise, Charlie had taken him under his wing and the two had become firm friends.
Harry Potter’s not-so-dulcet tones danced merrily down the hallway, drifting into the bedroom, where Draco Malfoy sat at the dressing table, an indulgent smile on his face.
It’s going to be a long night at the Leaky Cauldron.

Draco smiles, a wolfish, feral smile that makes Harry’s cock twitch painfully and his wolf perk his ears with interest.
Harry tried not to stare, as Draco took a deep drag on the gillyweed joint, blowing out a slow curl of blue smoke from his delectable mouth. He caught Harry looking at him, raised a lazy eyebrow, held out the joint.
, beneath Harry’s. The scent of his lust curling around them both, fanning Harry’s magic like a bellows to the flame. He remembered the pinpoint focus of his own mind, the way he’d instinctively tightened his grip on Draco, the first
So he does, dragging his tongue along the delicious length of him, suckling the head and finally tasting his salty-sweet essence.
Murmured endearments, careful hands stroking him, teasing him, opening him.
He doesn’t miss the fleeting, worried look that Hermione and Ron share.
Buff, and broad, and tall, Harry towered over everyone now, exuding a dangerous aura that Draco was drawn to like a billywig to a flame. Harry’s thighs were huge, muscled and thick, his stomach sculpted and his chest brown and bulging.
‘You all right, mate?’ Ron murmurs, just moving close enough to brush against Harry’s back. Harry leans back momentarily, Ron’s presence soothing him. The wolf in Harry recognises him as his beta, his second-in-command, and Ron’s scent and presence always has a calming effect on Harry.
And Draco
,’ Harry hisses.
Pettigrew’s eyes roll back in his skull and he collapses, unconscious, on the dirty ground. From behind Harry, outside the room, he hears scuffles and noise, and the smashed door flings open. Aurors spill through into the room, smudges of blue against the dull, dirty manor, wands raised.
Longbottom is the next to arrive, and he gives Draco a friendly enough wave, which he returns. Most of them have been good to him, in their own way, at least considering what Draco knows he deserves.
himself, knowing full well Harry was still at work, only a door away.
‘I meant it,’ he murmured, and Draco’s arm tightened around his body.
‘Honestly, Pansy,’ Draco says, throwing himself into her plush sofa with a dramatic sigh. ‘Working with him is an absolute
, smiling toothily at Draco’s groan of despair.
, and Harry is delirious with the intimacy, the trust, the way Draco’s thighs clench helplessly around his neck, the way his fingers pull his hair, the way he digs one heel into Harry’s back as if anchoring himself in place around Harry’s mouth.
Draco groans and flexes his hips, rutting into the air. ‘Yes,’ he breathes. ‘Fuck,
Hermione met him at the door and pulls him in for a hard, long, hug, making sure to rub her cheek across his face so he was drenched in her comforting scent.
‘It was pretty obvious.You’ve got muscles upon muscles and don’t wear your glasses anymore, whenever I’ve seen you investigate a crime scene or a suspect the first thing you do is
First the drinking of it, then the spinning of the empty bottle, with the whisperings of the other eighth years echoing around.
Draco’s lips parted and his eyes fluttered shut as Harry’s finger reached his cock, slowly trailing down the shaft to the base. Harry took the opportunity to slide his body up along Draco’s, claiming his mouth with his own. He kissed him deeply, before breaking away and allowing Draco the chance to reply.
He certainly
But, he knows it was the right thing to do. It didn’t matter that he took his Wolfsbane potion, that he
He hides his smile at her little game, twisting his hand so he’s wearing a Hogwarts uniform.
‘Now, seeing as our patrol is over, we have to go back to the office and finish up our paperwork for the day,’ Draco says, speaking slowly and carefully again, a frown on his face. Harry has to grit his teeth to stop his wolf from growling angrily. He is not an idiot! ‘Potter?’ Draco adds, a look of concern flashing across his expression.
He stepped up to them, kneeled on the floor, stroked a hand over each of their heads. ‘You’re both so perfect. So good for me. My perfect little Gryffindors.’ Hermione preened under his words, and Harry stirred feebly beneath his touch. Draco gently grasped both of them by the forearm. ‘Ready?’ he asked gently, and when they both nodded, he Apparated all three of them to their enormous bed, where Hermione knew they’d spend the next few hours, while he cleaned and comforted and cuddled them back to reality.

He honestly hadn’t expected, when casually bringing up Harry being a werewolf outside Flourish and Blotts, that is was a
Harry reached down to take himself in hand, pumping up and down his shaft a few times, and Draco parted his legs further and leaned back on his elbows, his body open and inviting. The red lace was bright against the paleness of his skin, the heels of his boots digging into the bedclothes as he bent his knees slightly. Harry wanted nothing more than to climb between those luscious thighs and drench himself in the scent and the taste and the heat of Draco.

‘Do you like to be fucked?’ Harry asked, trailing one finger slowly down Draco’s stomach, relishing the soft groan his touch elicited. ‘Or do you prefer to do the fucking?’
There has always been one Auror whose face never fails to settle into a scowl when he sees Draco, however, and that person is—
‘As for you, Potter,’ Draco hissed, fingers still tight in Harry’s hair, as Harry groaned and jerked towards Draco, ‘My precious little brat. I have plans for
She whimpered helplessly, her legs unfolding for her, carrying her body over to the sofa, to where Harry’s body, sticky with sweat and hot with desire, lay waiting for her.
Robards and Shacklebolt are the only people who know about Harry’s condition, outside of the Weasley clan, after all. And Harry knows he should be grateful - being bitten hadn’t lost him his job, the way it would have for probably anyone other than the Saviour of the Wizarding world. But still, the implicit suggestion that Robards doesn’t

Draco casts the strongest sleeping spell he can before the dragon changes its mind.
Draco’s long fingers button his shirt, fasten his cufflinks.
It’s enough to tip Harry over the edge once more. He thrusts up into Draco, holding himself still as his own cock throbs and his ears ring and he sees stars, all of his senses overcome by the overwhelming feeling of fucking Draco, of coming deep inside him.

‘Oh, fuck,’ Harry muttered, as his cock twitched eagerly in his own pants. ‘Are you
The third time, he saves Charlie’s life.
It was entirely the fault of Firewhisky that Blaise was in this position.
Draco’s words trailed away as Harry pulled the lace down, exposing Draco’s cock. Long and thick, the shaft was the same marble-white as his body, while the head was smooth and straining, flushed the same delicate pink as the petal of an early summer rose.
Draco wrinkles his nose as the pungent, unwashed smell of the man assaults his nostrils. ‘Who are you?’ he manages to croak, his throat sore and dry.
Draco smiles, putting Scorpius down. He toddles straight to the fort, and Draco pulls Harry in for a kiss.
- to find the greatest betrayal.
She only enjoyed a few moments of post-orgasmic bliss before she came to her senses and regret began to set in. She placed her palms against Draco’s shirt, pushing herself back so she could look at him. He was still fully dressed, minus his cloak, and raised an eyebrow at her.
does Harry want to do it.
Draco smirked, reaching down to cup the bulge hidden beneath the knickers. ‘I thought you were unkillable, Chosen One,’ he taunted, with a little bit of the old, familiar bite to his tone. Harry grinned darkly in response, a thrill shivering through him at that ghost of old antagonism rising to the surface.
‘As soon as our shift is over,’ Potter whispers, his lips ghosting across Draco’s ear. ‘I’m taking you home and making you mine.’
Malfoy just arches his eyebrow at him and makes a show of brushing down his Auror uniform. ‘You really are an animal, aren’t you, Potter?’ Malfoy drawls, before walking past him, knocking him in the shoulder as he does.
, Granger?’
‘But not broken?’ Ron asked, and Harry shook his head.
- sitting with Pansy Parkinson, smiling as they spoke. His hair was as icy as always, artful styled, and Harry could see a plethora of silver earrings adorning his ear. A tight, black t-shirt stretched over his chest - Harry ached to run his fingers over the material, feeling he hardness of the body beneath - but it was Malfoy’s legs that Harry couldn’t tear his eyes away from.
From the entrance to the alleyway, a pair of dark-cloaked figures scurry towards them, completely unaware of the Auror presence nearby. One of them is talking, his voice low and breathless.
‘Come on, Hermione,’ Harry said, his voice taking on a pleading tone. ‘You have to be naked when he gets back anyway,’ he added, and Hermione shook her head and turned back to her paperwork.
to be punished, why you misbehave all the time.’ Harry frowned, and Draco stretched out, pressing the front of his body to Harry’s back, until his lips were at his ear. ‘But that’s not what you’re going to get today.’
The whole idea that he might fancy Draco was ludicrous.
With a blaze of heat, he realised he could do exactly that. He climbed onto the bed between Draco’s legs, and went to grab hold of the red lace keeping him hidden.
Draco walked over to Hermione, his long fingers gently stroking along her jawline, forcing her head up to look at him. ‘Hermione, my good little girl,’ he purred, and Hermione melted inside. ‘All I need from you is to be naked and waiting when I get home. Can you do that for me, sweetheart?’ He trailed his thumb against her lips, and she licked it as she nodded eagerly, already feeling herself get wet at his words.
It takes Draco the best part of the week he has to perfect it. Every spare moment he has, he hides himself away in his Potions room, several cauldrons bubbling at once as he tries several variations. There are piles of boxes and bags from Slug and Jiggers scattered around the room - Draco refuses to consider how much he’s spent on different ingredients, and why he’s been willing to do so. It’s not as if he can’t afford it, after all - even after the Ministry had taken a chunk of the Malfoy fortune in wartime reparations, there was plenty left over that meant that, really, Draco didn’t have to work a day in his life if he didn’t want.
Draco sighed. ‘I’m not mad at you, sweetheart. But I
It happened in the middle of the night, whenever he’d managed to come up with a reason to share a bed with Draco - a surprisingly easy feat, most of the time. Blaise would wait, hours sometimes, until the whole world was silent and dark and Draco’s breathing deepened.
Harry wakes up late on Saturday morning, his head sore and his body aching. He curses under his breath, and summons a hangover potion to himself. He drinks it gratefully, the cool, minty feeling washing through him and clearing his head. He’s fully clothed, lying face-down on his bed. He vaguely remembers Apparating home - that was a bit of a risk, considering how tipsy he’d been - and a strange, comforting camaraderie blossoming between him and Malfoy.
close, his cock hard and leaking against his stomach. Draco writhed and gripped his hips harder and made adorable, tantalising little breathy sounds that drove Harry crazy.
Ready to defend Draco, Harry realises.
Harry is dangerously silent, and when he speaks to the frontman, his voice is low. ‘Your father?’
Draco, that they are still breathless and sweaty and locked together. Then Draco smiles, a real smile, broad and bright and wonderful. He pushes back Harry’s hair, lets his finger trace over the lightning scar.
‘Mr Weasley?’ she replied, sugar sweet and pliant. He raised a knowing eyebrow over the frame of his horn-rim glasses.
‘What’s she doing in the library, anyway? I thought we were going to Diagon tonight.’
He wonders if Draco has friends he can confide in, about the war, about his family, about taking the Mark. He looks up at Draco, too much alcohol making his vision fuzzy, almost like he needs glasses again. He can just about make out Draco smile indulgently at him.
‘You caught me, Potter,’ Malfoy murmured, nuzzling against his cheek, and Harry laughed, arching his neck so Malfoy could gently bite at his favourite spot.
He knew it, from the expressions on people’s faces, from the way a room fell silent when he walked in, from the way crowds parted before him, like spirits before Death.
Potter was
‘Malfoy,’ he spits out, placing a travel mug on his catastrophe of a desk.
Instead, this is more gentle, teasing almost, comfortingly familiar in a way Harry hasn’t felt with anyone outside of the Weasley family since he was bitten.
He could see everything.
Harry pulled off Draco’s black top, tossing it aside without a second thought. He took half a step back, holding his hands at Draco’s hips.
Harry continued to move against Draco, slowly at first, easing himself open on Draco’s dick, getting used to the feel of him buried deep, then faster and faster. Soon he was sweaty and flushed and so,
Draco’s captors are stunned into silence at Harry’s presence, until the mousy-haired man gulps and takes a trembling step forward.
The dark possessiveness, the golden tint to Harry’s eyes, the way his canine teeth were just a little

can be used to great effect, before she cancels the charm and instead locks him up in a Muggle contraption, like a renaissance princess the night before her wedding.
‘Look at me,’ Harry growls, gently working Draco’s cock in his hand, thrusting shallowly into him at the same time. ‘I want to see you come.’
‘Hey.’ A firm, warm hand settles on his forearm, and Draco steps forward into Harry’s space, face to face. Harry hadn’t even realised he’d come to a stop, but sure enough they’re standing in the middle of Knockturn Alley, a handful of intrigued faces watching them from different doorways. ‘C’mon, Potter. It’s okay.’
A duel in a Hogwarts’ corridor, the names of the dead rising in anger on their lips.

‘I’ve been watching you all night, Potter,’ Malfoy said, as he looked at Harry’s lips and reached up to stroke a long, elegant finger down his cheek. ‘About time you came over.’
And oh,
‘Coming, darling!’ he called out, purposefully light and cheerful, breaking into a chuckle when he heard Harry’s rumbling of discontent in response.
That made things complicated.
Hermione squirmed, not wanting to reply, and Draco tightened his grip on her waist to stop her moving.
Chapter 8: Surprise
They slowly pull apart, and Draco snuggles back against Harry’s body, not uttering a word of complaint about the hot, sticky come that leaks from him and covers them both.
Hungry green eyes locked onto his.
‘What’s this?’ Harry says shortly, eyeing it suspiciously. A familiar, faint blue smoke emanated from the surface, and when he breathes in he catches the familiar scent of Wolfsbane. He gives Draco a sharp look. ‘I already take this,’ Harry reminds him, not wanting to utter the words out loud in the bullpen. Draco waves his wand again, and a low buzzing of a
‘Trust me,’ Harry said grimly, ‘no-one could get through those wards.’ They were strong enough, after all, to contain a werewolf on a full moon. ‘And I’m not too worried. The war may be long over, but plenty of people still want the thrill of seeing how the Boy Who Lived lives nowadays.’
Only then is he allowed his own reprieve.
The door to Peaseblossom Cottage swings open, and Hermione’s familiar, comforting scent sweeps over him.
That’s why
Lean and hard, with lily-white skin criss-crossed with silvery scars that made Harry’s heart clench with guilt. The guilt was momentarily wiped away as Harry’s eyes were drawn to Draco’s nipples, pink and tempting, and the glint of silver at each from the bars that ran through them.
- had he
Harry is so caught up in his maelstrom of thoughts and feelings, he doesn’t see the hooded figures until it’s almost too late.
‘In your absence, Potter,’ Robards begin, his voice heavy. ‘It appears Malfoy dropped your assigned caseload and secretly started work on something else.’
‘Please
‘Let’s not disappoint our wonderful boss,’ Harry mutters, and he is momentarily stunned when Malfoy gives him a look of genuine amusement, his lips curling into a smile, his even, white teeth flashing, his silver eyes crinkling.
Hermione’s breath caught at the sight of him, his lean, Quidditch-honed body tempting and tight, his cock already half-hard. Draco reached down and ran his fingers through Harry’s messy hair, making Harry press up against him, his eyes fluttering shut.
He didn’t let him lean away as one strong arm pulled him close, his bare chest to his own while the other smoothed the furrows between his eyebrows.
Draco smiled and no matter how dashing it is, it did nothing to alleviate Harry’s anxiousness.
“That’s it. Doing so good, little one. Doing so good” Harry whispered, pumping his hand up and down as he continued his assault in his throbbing hole.
Harry began to lead the drive, the others following them behind. Turning his head one last time at the place he never once left, he teared with a good feeling.
He turned back to the man, observing his appearance. Fair skin, lovely nose and a cunning stare. He smirked, these types, from his experience, are usually kinky. Well, not like he’s complaining.
“Mr. Potter” he spoke, almost stuttering, “I believe I have some business to attend to. Excuse me” he left before Dracy can even say anything. She rolled her eyes. She hates wizards who has no bones to offer, no spine to brave. Weak.
Draco's eyes turned glassy as he stared over Harry's handsome face. Merlin, that beard looked so hot and he wants to feel it on his skin, the way it would slid down his torso as Harry travels down to taste all of him. He shuddered. He already really can feel it now.
“Draco—
“What’s your plan, now?”
Her heart gave a tug and she breathed heavily for a few times. Thoughtfulness is not something she had expected from him.
“Pads, I am taking a bath!”
He moaned as he felt Harry’s fingers slid down to his cock and rubbed him until he was fully hard and leaking. He whimpered as fingers ghosted over his perineum then a lubed finger rolled over his rim, circling and teasing.
“What a surprise”
Enjoy!! :))
Dracy felt her insides churn as she observed him from her peripheral vision. She appreciated the need to claim in his lusty eyes and the clench in his fist. She didn’t miss the movements that gave him away.
This, right here, at the eyes of the sun slowly creeping inside the bedroom, the comfort of the whole place, and under Harry’s languid sucking, meant mornings is not just another day but a blessing, a gift.
The breakfast the next day was awkward. Well, it was on Harry’s side. He’s sure Draco is still mad if those glares he keeps on giving him is of any indication.
Draco smiled. A lot of things can happen in one way, more with two ways, and endless in many ways. If Harry takes a step back, Draco will step closer. If Harry turns his back, Draco will walk in front of him.
He nodded, “I couldn’t agree more”
“Snatches, huh? Maybe you should be the one holding on me instead”
"Act nice, Draco. We wouldn't like to give a wrong impression to the Potter Family"
‘It’s not okay, Malfoy,’ Harry says, feeling upset now, his wolf whining unhappily at the thought of Malfoy -
And then, Neville grabs Blaise’s jaw in his steady hands, and kisses him back.
‘That was close. Wonder what they were looking for me for?’ Potter falls quiet, a frown creasing his forehead, then looks at Draco and scratches the back of his head. ‘Back to the office to report it?’ he murmurs awkwardly.
The pub Harry takes them to is close to London Bridge. The evening commuter rush is in full flow, and Draco finds himself sticking close by Harry’s side as they battle their way through the crowds of Muggles. The pub is nice enough, dark and dingy and quiet, with a few old men silently nursing beers at the bar. Harry nudges Draco in the direction of a corner table, tucked far away from the bar and the other patrons, and Draco makes his way over to claim it as Harry braves the bar.
“Well that’s a problem. Are you going to hand the job to someone else?” Remus asked.
“Hmm” was the only response Draco managed.
“I wanted us to live somewhere peaceful especially when our little beanie’s near on the way. That is why I have put the baby’s crib in my room for a while and will be transferred here soon. I know this may not be the perfect surprise and I am not really good with my words but,” he paused darting his tongue out to lick his lips.
He changed his glare into a daringly sweet smile as he inhaled the sweet aroma of coffee and the hush noises of people conversing to one another. There was also a soft mellow of lo-fi music filling the place and as he zeroed in, he saw their target waiting for his order at the counter.
He closed the pub after an hour with a sullen mood. Looking around to see himself alone like he used to. He began to walk along the gutter, kicking stones and constantly checking in on his phone. He was hoping that maybe Harry’s messages just got delayed and he’ll call up in any second.
“Lie down here. This would just take for two minutes to make sure you’re healthy and to check on your little beanie” Andy smiled at them.
“Loosen up, please” he mumbled smoothly, words rolling in ease, “I don’t bite but you look like you can"
The enthusiastic energy Harry displayed on his movements, tongue teasing around her labia. He alternated between sucking and nipping so playfully, palms beginning to move from its place on her hips to touch her cunt and part its lips.
” he swore as Harry pressed his front into his back, his cock pocking through his jeans to his ass. He can feel it. Draco can feel it.
Draco tried to smile which ended up looking as if his lips trembled, “H-harry”
He smiled hesitantly.
“Doll?”
“We’re apparating. Their fireplace isn’t one for floo travelling”
When they heard footsteps approaching, Harry was fast to pull out and set him on his feet which immediately collapsed.
Harry nodded.
“You’ll see, baby. Trust me” he winked and carefully guided her inside it before dropping the floo powder and murmuring a location she’s only hearing for the first time.
He coughed and tried to pry their hands off, “I can’t breath. What are you guys doing?” he asked as he looked at who these people are.
“Y-yes” he stammered and the man hummed, stepping closer and stopped a feet or two away behind him.
"Damn, let me hit that snack" Draco grinned but wiped it off immediately when he heard the familiar voice.
“Who did this?” he asked.
If only, Harry can just give in and stop pretending he’s not liking what Draco is doing to him. He's just pretending, right? He has to be.
“Now, we gettin’ the cover now, do we?” Harry smirked, walking nearer to him.
He lick Draco’s nape and began to feel those cheeks against his palm. Fuck. So good. So plump. So sexy. And so sinful. Oh merlin, he’s sinful and he loves it. He can feel his mind clouded of pure lust. Clouded from right judgment because all he has right now is to make him his.
“It’s a nice day out” Draco mumbled, finding himself smiling at the joyful expression on everyone’s faces.
His desires that has long gone began to be one with his soul erupted in flames as he kissed Harry for the first time in that hidden alcove in Hogwarts. The man who showed him how sex should go. The man who showed him what it feels like to be kissed and to be touched. The man who made his dreams come true.
“Why don’t you go keep him some company, Harry? There was a reason the potion accident happened after all”
Harry hummed, “I like you, doll. I am a changed man”
She carded her fingers through his hair and smiled at the view. She loves the way Harry is always talking to their little beanie, sometimes bunny, and other times their buddy.
“Oh, nothing. I just thought you want to hear something about him. Everyone knows the mighty stalking that happened before. Was it the wrackspurts or nargles pushing you to follow him? You didn’t wear the necklace I gave you?”
“Give us our wands back, Dray” Pansy rolled her eyes, “Harry, you know wandless magic—
Scared but halfway feeling calm under the tenderness, he closed his eyes and gave the man a kiss on the tip of his nose. He heard a surprised gasp from the pant followed by strong arms encircling around his lithe waist and pulling him to his lap. His combat pants rough against Draco’s bare thighs as he nuzzled in the crook of his neck.
“Here, sit here” Harry gestured and Draco did. Harry didn’t sit down but he stood sideways to Draco’s, body completely facing the omega as to make sure this gorgeous one is with him.
“So good” he whispered laced with genuine sincerity, “You were so good, tiger”
“This will be our home,” he motioned around like it was  no big deal and Dracy was already feeling like she’s about to get a heart attack and pop the baby in no time.
“What is this article, Potter?!”
Harry chuckled once more, dipping his head low and peck a kiss on his cheek, “Already begging nicely for daddy. You sound so angelic, my love”
“No, we really don’t. I’m sorry” Draco answered seriously, with his pounding headache he has enough of all the confusion, “What are you really talking about, Lovegood?”
And Draco is all the forbidden fruit, forbidden dessert and basically, forbidden.
He pecked him on the lips for several times before nodding. Completely have accepted the fact that things are different now and might as well just embrace it because it is all what his body wanted to.
He adjusted his suit and fixed his facial expressions. He laid the glass at the cocktail table beside him and straightened up. He needs to will his cool or he’ll just grab her out of here and fuck here in the hidden alcove. But she doesn’t deserve that.
Harry pouted his lips. Wanting to kiss him but there’s no harm if Draco wouldn’t really want to. After all, his reputation has been ruined because of the path he chose for himself.
Her morning sickness have gotten worse for the past few weeks. The cravings and all of the demands Harry makes sure are met. She felt like she’d been blessed with the world and maybe, she is.
Draco smirked. That’s right. Look at him like you’re craving for him.
“I miss you” he mumbled.
“Leo, honey” she called.
Draco turned around again and this time, Harry made sure he was quick enough to look back up but Draco is smirking again. He is smirking as if he knows something Harry don't.
"Not so bad" Draco answered smoothly and shrugged. But he knows his insides are rejoicing because finally, he doesn't have boring Aurors to guard him.
“Wouldn’t you like that, little kitten?” Harry nibbled on that one sensitive spot. He hit it home and licked in a way he can make Draco bend to his will, “Fill you to the brim? Hmm?”
Curious as to the sudden change of the design, he turned his attention to it and began to read the article.
She blushed when Harry’s attention turned to hers but returned the smile when Harry let out that gorgeous grin as his eyes sweep up and down her body. Up until now, she cannot help the tingle that runs through her core at the look of utter adoration in his eyes.
A moment passed before he pulled away, “Let’s go eat”
Draco would not normally compliment people other than himself but this muggle looks so ethereal. His carefree smirk reminded him of rainbows because he is very much gay. Gayer than anyone could be. Those broad shoulders look strong enough to hold five sacks of rice all at once, the devious glint twirling in those emerald eyes. They looked so ready to take onto the world, dominate. They gaze as if he could take Draco's clothes off of his body, acts as if he could see what's underneath.
She sobbed even more.
“H-harry”
He has the week.
All unmasked for him to see. All for him to experience.
The office.
When Harry was done filling the tub with water and a soap, he joined him, easily sitting down behind Draco’s. He pulled the boy to lean on his chest and he began to gently caress his body with the soapy water.
“I want you, yes” he paused, his tongue peeking out as he licked a striped in Draco’s clavicle, “I want you so I’ll have you in the way I fucking want”
Harry huffed. He’s starting to think Draco had gone used to with calling him daddy. But the real question is, why is he letting him be called daddy? Feels good, isn’t it?
“She seems nice, Harry” Ron said the next day they were in his office, chilling.
“Please d-daddy. Want you so much” Draco cried and Harry inhaled sharply and cursed loudly. Hesitant lest he'll be caught acting on what Draco wants him to.
“It’s not! You have a magic and I don’t? Do you know how fun our pranks would be if I possess the same magic as you?”
He opened his eyes after a while. He didn’t stare at him and against all things, he bent his head down and kissed him.
“I know” Harry rubbed his temples. Sometimes, Hermione’s nagging really just pisses him off and it’s worsening his headache more.
Draco moaned loud when Harry had touched his prostate and felt shocks to his spine that flowed through his cock with mind-numbing sensations.
“H-harry” she moaned, “Harry!”
“What are you trying to say, Mr. Potter?” Narcissa asked, her grip tensing on his thigh.
Can you believe that? He’s a mess. The head of the Roaring Lions is in a mess. Pansy who’s been wondering when to see him crack have arrived though the woman is out with Hermione with their usual couple’s night few rooms before his.
The way his cheeks would redden when he’s caught staring, the appreciation he feels when Harry’s lips tug upwards then reddening in return.
Draco waved a hand, going for a shy facade. He let out a hesitant smile when he noticed the way Tom’s eyes lingered a second longer on him before Harry cleared his throat, “So, you live in the neighborhood as well?”
Draco nodded, “Yes. Pansy Parkinson recommended your service” he answered, “What do we do?” he bit his lips, fingers grasping the side of his trousers.
“I-I know that,” he sighed, “Draco and I inhaled some” he chose to say the truth, knowing the two wouldn’t judge or nag him about it in the way Hermione would’ve.
“Is this okay?” Harry asked again when his hand goes underneath her skirt, he massaged the top of her thigh to the side of it and settled in the inner part, “This?”
Dracy cried out, that familiar recoil as she pushed her eyes open. She wanted to look at her reflection as she came and when she managed to pop them wide open, she let go and cum on Harry’s fingers, feeling the way it slid out of her and coated Harry’s wrist.
He slumped his body in Harry and buried his head at the crook of his neck. He breathed heavily, not trusting himself to say anything.
‘So, how long have you been a werewolf?’ Draco’s voice is casual, but his words make Harry splutter on his tea.
‘How did it happen?’ are the words that push themselves out of Draco’s mouth, without his express permission. He winces internally as Harry’s eyes darken and he gets a feral look to him. A split second later he’s composed himself again, and throws a rueful glance at the permanent
The murmuring stopped, and a scurry of feet towards him made Draco cower back against the wall. A rough hand pulled away the blindfold, and Draco blinked uncomfortably in the sudden brightness.
Draco leaned down, drew him into a biting, bruising kiss that left Harry gasping for breath when he pulled away. Draco manhandled him into the position he wanted, until Harry was on his stomach, his face between Hermione’s thighs, Draco behind him. Draco leaned down, placed a kiss on Harry’s bum, before biting down, making Harry wince and rock his hips into the sofa. Hermione reached down, curling her hands in his thick, dark hair, and his green eyes locked onto hers, even as Draco reached around and - judging by the way Harry’s eyes unfocused slightly and his breath caught - grabbed hold of his neglected cock.
With that, Malfoy pushed Harry against the cold tiled wall, and Harry bit his lip as his husband dropped to his knees before him, taking Harry’s cock in his mouth and looking up at him through wet lashes with adoring silver eyes.
And probably, it’s only Robards who realises Potter is the first partner on the force Draco’s ever had.
‘I just don’t want you to get hurt,’ he admits, his voice barely a whisper, as his wolf whines along with him.
‘Auror Potter, you know we had no choice in the matt—’
‘Feeling tetchy?’ he smirks, leaning back in his chair so his white shirt pulled deliciously tight over his chest.
let Malfoy get to him. His heart aches painfully in his chest, and his breathing is tight, laboured. His ears are buzzing, and he shakes his head like a dog, trying to clear his aching thoughts.
Potter. Learn to read, you idiot.
Then it is done, and where Harry stood minutes before, an enormous, shaggy, black wolf now stands on trembling legs, whining and breathing heavily.
Harry stood before the mirror, face pale, eyes sad. As Draco watched, he lifted his hand to his scar, tracing the jagged lines dazedly.
Harry blinks in horror as he realises he has Malfoy pushed up against the alley wall, his hands either side of Malfoy’s head. Harry’s groin presses hard against Malfoy’s, effectively pinning him in place.
‘I doubt either of you prats could teach me anything,’ she replied haughtily. Theo laughed, low and sexy, as Draco’s eyes darkened. ‘We’ll be the best teachers you’ve ever had, Granger.’
‘What have you done to my mate?’ Harry growls, slowly advancing. He clenches his fist tighter, runs a tongue over the point of a fang.
Blaise doesn’t question it.

house, that he and Draco share
Hermione takes time off work to be with Harry, while Ron goes in for a few hours the next morning, returning with a furrowed brow and dark circles beneath his eyes. When Harry asks what’s wrong, Ron smiles weakly and shakes his head for Harry not to worry. Harry sees him and Hermione share what they clearly think is a surreptitious glance at each other, but he doesn’t have the energy to care. Instead he slumps lower into the comfy, battered sofa in their living room, cold hands clasped around another cup of tea. The tea is laced with Wolfsbane Potion: the same one Draco had brought to him, made with his own hands, to ease Harry’s next full moon.
Harry turns with him, and sees Robards approaching them with a frown on his face. ‘Potter, glad you’re here. In my office. You too, Weasley,’ he adds, and Harry and Ron hurry to catch up to him.
Every joint in his body aches, like an old broken bone on a bleak winter’s morning. He tries to raise his hand to his throbbing head, but when he feels the bite of cold metal at his wrist, his eyes fly open in alarm and surprise.
Harry sighed happily, feeling Draco’s come slowly leaking from him as his own dried over both of them. Nudging Draco’s arm, Harry snuggled up into his side. He nuzzled against Draco’s chest, placed a gentle kiss on the silver of a scar.
That moment, Harry bursts through the doors, splintering them into shards without even lifting his wand.
,’ he whispers.
‘Fuck,’ Draco mutters, weakly.
He was going to have to get used to all the dog hair on the full moon, Draco thought to himself ruefully. He couldn’t stop the enormous smile that simple thought gave him.
‘I don’t want to talk about him, Hermione,’ Harry snaps back before she can finish. She looks pained, and Crookshanks wakes from his nap, glaring at Harry through one opened golden eye and swishing his tail warningly. Harry groans, and runs his hands through his hair. ‘I’m sorry,’ he mutters, and Crookshanks closes his eye and settles again. ‘I don’t mean to snap at you, it’s just…’ he pauses then, unsure how to carry on. Just what, exactly?
Draco stopped struggling and stayed quiet, not wanting to draw attention to himself.
Ron soon joins them, Flooing back as soon as he hears what happened. He pulls Harry into a rough, heartfelt hug, making Harry settle a little bit more. Harry hardens himself to the pain in his chest, the hollow feeling of heartbreak rattling through him like a wind through a long-dead carcass, picked clean of everything that once made it vibrant and alive.
Draco is still watching him, until Harry sees him look away from the corner of his eye. He bows his head, white-blond hair falling into his eyes.
‘And you were worried this would be dangerous,’ Draco laughs, gently pushing Harry back to all fours. Wolf-Harry nudges Draco’s hip, and Draco lets himself be herded into the corner where a mattress lies on the floor, covered in dark hairs. Sighing to himself, Draco sinks onto the makeshift bed, leaning back against the wall as wolf-Harry curls around him, like a gigantic, hairy hot water bottle. Draco curls his fingers in wolf-Harry’s fur, idly stroking him as he slowly begins to snore, his head on Draco’s lap.
On his knees on the beer-sticky floor, crawling between Draco’s thighs beneath the table, Harry would pull open Draco’s trousers, free his gloriously thick cock, and swallow him down, the low sounds of the pub around them ringing in his ears.

’They have,’ Harry sighed happily. ‘Because they’re my family, but so are you.’
‘That’s right. And to be honest, I can already
, being annoying and saviour-y,’ Draco concedes, automatically resting a hand on Pansy’s slim ankle. ‘But I never thought anyone would ever actually partner us up together.’
Harry shrugs, finding it hard to care about magical technicalities when Draco is in his arms, their clothing still a barrier between them.
‘You’re not so bad yourself, Potter,’ Draco said, a begrudging tone to his voice, as if he hadn’t been calling him
They face one another, and Draco carefully holds one hand out, palm up, in invitation. Wolf-Harry reaches forward, his whiskers tickling Draco’s hand as he gives him a cautious sniff. The next moment, he jumps up, his paws landing on Draco’s shoulders as he gives a happy
Harry pulls himself out of bed, heading straight to the shower. He turns it on as hot as it goes - his blood runs so hot now he can barely feel it otherwise - and strips quickly, stepping under the steaming stream of water with a satisfied sigh.
‘So far,’ he replied, and he pulled Draco towards him. He stumbled in his heels, falling against Harry’s chest, and Harry reached around and grabbed his arse, the lace rubbing against his palms, and held him steady as he kissed him again. ‘You’re so fucking
dude?
Harry pulled away from Hermione, throwing a dirty look over his shoulder to Draco. Hermione was fairly sure he was about to mouth off, to bite out a bratty retort, but Draco just raised a commanding eyebrow and thrust himself deep into Harry.
He’d just assumed everyone knew but him.
Malfoy caught the Snitch from beneath Harry’s fingertips.
writes out of sequence.’
The cloaked figures reach the other end of the alleyway, hesitating and looking out before disappearing back into Knockturn Alley. Instantly Potter is far away from Draco, the Disillusionments lifted. He avoids Draco’s eyes, running a hand through his messy hair, and Draco bites his lips and looks away.
Potter’s eyes are darker than he’s ever seen them, the green almost entirely eclipsed by black. He’s so big he fills the tiny space, and his magic - powerful and pressing - assaults Draco on all sides.
It’s been four days since the wizarding world found out he’s a werewolf.
Harry snarled to himself. Draco Malfoy was
Robards calm facade crumbles away completely, and he flashes Harry a look of terror, as if battling with himself whether to give up the information. ‘Potter, listen to me,’ he pleads. ‘Weasley has a team of Aurors ready to go and extract Malfoy. I need you to stay here with me, okay? I believe your…
This morning, however, he thinks to himself:
‘Okay, then,’ Potter echoes Draco’s reply, and he gives him the tiniest, briefest flash of an almost-friendly grin before turning back to his paperwork.
There is a silence between him and Draco, when he finishes speaking, but it isn’t uncomfortable. More of a shared understanding. Harry wonders whether Draco has many friends, anymore: he barely seems to get involved with any of the Auror socials, and as far as Harry’s aware, he’s never deigned to accept a partner before him.
.’ Potter growls but stills and refocuses on Draco. ‘I want this just as much as you do -
Draco obeys, his eyes opening, locking onto Harry’s. ‘I’m — not going to last long,’ Draco gasps, and Harry smiles and leans down, buried deep in Draco, his hand tight around the pulsing heat of his cock, his lips brushing Draco’s ear, and whispers ‘
, fuck,’ Draco muttered weakly above him, and Harry smiled around his dick and slid his mouth deeper onto him. Draco’s cock pushed against the back of his throat, but he breathed deeply through his nose and focused. He bobbed his head up and down a few times, Draco gasping each time the flared head of him breached Harry’s throat, before pulling up so his lips were just around the tip.
Draco gets so far into the swing of his task that he doesn’t notice Potter is there until he speaks.
Harry looks from Ron to Robards, his panic and anger rising. ‘What do you mean?’ he asks, his voice dangerously low.
After dinner, everyone slowly bundled from the scarred wooden table in the dining room to the mismatched, squashy sofas in the living room. Harry fell into the battered blue two-seater, pulling Draco down easily after him so they tumbled together in a sprawl of limbs, the broken springs of the sofa tipping them into the middle. Ginny reached out and ruffled Draco’s hair as she passed, skipping out of reach with a laugh as he grouched at her and lifted his hand to his head.
A flurry of movement, and Hermione was in Draco’s arms as he carried her to the sofa. He held her cradled in one arm, waving his wand to release Harry’s
Draco hated that his once-enemy was now his mate. He hated how possessive he was, how every time he dragged Potter to his bed he left him littered with bites and bruises, covered in sweat and come.
It hadn’t taken long for Harry to learn the rhythms of the moon. When it pulled, when it pushed. When it slept, and when it awoke with a blinding, brilliant fury. He didn’t need to chart the phases, reading them instead in the divination of body and eyes.
‘What’s this about?’ Harry asks instead, and Malfoy shrugs and his eyes flicker over to Robards’ office.
Draco eventually left, but he had a frown on his face as he did.
Barely fifteen minutes later, the door quietly opens and closes again as someone steps inside, and Draco knows, from the soft caress of familiar magic against his, that it’s
‘Lovely to see you, dear,’ Molly murmured, releasing him and stepping back. ‘Dinner will be ready in an hour. Harry Potter, those cupcakes are for
‘I told you not to come,’ Harry growls into Draco’s neck, his hands wrapped in his his hair, his body pressed close to him.
Draco’s lips press desperately against Harry’s chest. ‘Yes, Harry,’ he gasps. ‘Yours. I’m yours. However you want me.’
The bonfire crackled merrily, but Harry turned towards the darkness.
Harry lowered his head, flicking his tongue against the ball that held one of the bars in place. He was rewarded with a low groan from Draco, who arched into his touch and curled a fist into Hairy’s messy hair.
? After already exposing his condition to the press? That made no sense.
and writhing beneath him in pleasure mere minutes before. Harry smiled into his skin, cradling his hand possessively around Draco’s hip. There was a moment of contented silence, and Draco kissed Harry’s hair.
‘Hermione, come over here,’ he panted, and she screwed her eyes closed.
Easy.
When Harry had first brought - well, dragged, really - Draco along to a Burrow dinner, Draco had been partway through his Potions Mastery. He’d been more than pleasantly surprised to discover that Molly Weasley had been top of the class in Potions back in her day at Hogwarts. They had ended up deep in conversation, Draco absent-mindedly helping her with dinner. Ever since that day it had become a little tradition between the two of them: Draco helped Molly getting dinner ready, and he kept Molly up to date on the latest Potions news.
It’s later that day, hours after Potter leaves, when Draco is walking across the quiet Atrium to the fireplaces that he realises the full moon is in two weeks’ time. Potter mentioned, at the pub, about the Wolfsbane Potion making his irritability worse. And considering how irritable he was now, before taking it, Draco didn’t know if he wanted to stick around for the week after next.
He grinned, “You don’t get to order me around. We’re not out there, Draco”
“You’re soaked, love. Look at you. So wet. Do you love this? Do you love me breaking you piece by piece? Do you love me taking you apart?”
He sighed and tried to hold onto the doorframe as he continued to peek outside. His eyes not even leaving Harry's magnificence when he stopped and wiped as he wiped the sweat on his forehead. The serious look on his face leveled the seriousness of his beard. Draco doesn't even want to blink. He wants to stare at him for every second that he can until the image is stuck in his mind.
Not a muggle with no use.
She jumped in shock hearing Harry’s voice. She looked up and saw him by the doorway, wearing black jeans and a fitted black shirt. He looked casual but so handsome. She felt herself blush at that thought. Harry is handsome?
No sooner than later, several people popped up in the common room, wearing their own Weasley sweater and the same smiles plastered on their faces as they hugged and greeted one another. It was such a magical sight Draco found himself tearing up a bit.
He grumbled and kicked his sheets just to brood. There’s no way he’s going to be mature about this. He will not. That man is going to be the death of him, the inevitable death of him. One day, he’s going to kick him on the curb and be done with it.
I'm...I really don't know what to say.
Star? Ha! Weak!
Draco rolled his eyes inwardly at his father's statement. Act nice there, act nice that. His father is obsessed with acting nicely, giving the right impressions and it's no wonder he's an only child. He's probably boring.
This is a bit short and I am so tempted to finish this up in one go :/
She sobbed, hands tightening around his nape, trying to coax her to let her ride him, to let her impale her self around that thick cock inside her, make her cum around his hard shaft.
I don't know why, I don't know why. But I think Luna knows something we don't 👀
“Wake up, my beautiful girl”
Little gasps and pants rang out of her lips as Harry pushed in inch by inch, spreading her wide and he swore out loud when she clenched around him.
“HARRY JAMES POTTER!”
He groaned as he bucked his hips slowly, riding out his orgasm and allowing himself to take a deep breath.
There’s none. Hmm. Easy peasy.
“I thought you didn’t feel good” Draco started sadly. He looked down and peered at him.
“Sleep, baby” he whispered before leaning down and kissing her nose and pulling her close.
“I’m trying to be serious—
Harry is about to walk away when Draco told something that stopped him on his feet abruptly.
Remus’ smirked at him, nearly sending Sirius to topple to the floor, his legs quivering as his cock woke up from its slumber. Immediately leaking a copious amount of precum as he gulped, the sight of Remus’ own undeterred erection made his toes curl, his mind swaying.
by Ginny at some point.
“Mrs. Barnes”
No! Of course not. He hates this man.
“Thank you, Dr. Hula. You may go” James said before focusing all of his attention to the matter at hand.
“Go to your room and I’ll bring you your sobering potion” Harry spoke when Draco didn’t answer his question but sobbed.
Looking around his room, there seemed to be nothing foreign. The design is simple, the whole room is neat and reeks of him. The bed is wide, there’s a discarded shirt on the love seat, curtains drawn open and a door that she knows leads to his bathroom and a closet just beside the bathroom door.
Once again, a snarl from Harry, this time making Robards stumble to a stop. ‘Well, your fucking plan was a failure, wasn’t it? Everyone in the entire wizarding world knows I’m a werewolf now, and Draco? He was tortured, he could have been
Harry feels like insects are crawling beneath his skin, making him hot and itchy and irritable. His wolf is ready to explode.
He found Draco in the dirt, knees drawn to his chest.

Draco had been first in the office again this morning, and even though it was now well past ten and the rest of the Aurors were in, Potter was nowhere to be seen. Draco eventually gave up waiting for him, pulling his new paperwork towards him with a sigh.
Day 15: Draco x Harry - First Time
flares from his wand-tip, enveloping Potter in a protective bubble. Potter doesn’t seem to notice, and opens his mouth, speaking that strange, sibilant language instead. The Short-snout pauses, looks down, and slowly lowers its front legs to the ground.
‘WHERE IS DRACO?’ he roars, and Robards pales and gulps and finally gives in.
From outside the library a door slammed, and Theo’s voice echoed down the hallway.

‘Never,’ he promises, and Draco collapses, sobbing, against him.
needs this thing with Potter to go well. Draco couldn’t afford to fuck things up by bringing up sensitive magical diseases that only Potter’s best friends know about, any more than he could afford to fuck things up by staring at Potter’s hard, tempting body or gorgeous green eyes or that snarling, vicious,
Draco never finished his sentence, as Harry flexed his thighs and lifted himself up before sliding back down, Draco’s lubed cock pushing easily back into him as he did. Draco’s hands gripped Harry’s thighs, and Harry winced a little from the firm hold, knowing that he’d have bruises in the shape of Draco’s fingers the next morning.
Hours of exquisite, torturous bliss.
Hermione whimpered unhappily, her heart beating uncomfortably, as she scrambled down from Harry. Draco drew his wand, waving it silently, and Harry groaned as his wrists were bound in an
‘Thanks, mate,’ Harry says, as Ron nods his head and turns back to the cooking. Harry takes a sip of the rich, dark ale, and turns back to Hermione, clutching a glass of her favourite goblin-made red wine and watching him anxiously. ‘Well, it’s only been a day,’ he relents, finally answering her question. ‘But it’s going to be awful. I know he’s done well for himself, turned his life around, and he’s not a
Draco has gone oddly quiet, and Harry can see the faint pink flush to his cheeks. He remembers thinking that Malfoy was too arrogant to take a partner, but now wonders whether anyone had even ever offered. Harry’s wolf whines unhappily, and Harry has to fight not to lay a comforting hand on Draco’s arm. Instead he stands up, abruptly, making Draco look at him in surprise.
William Pettigrew breathes shakily, and takes another step back.
‘Better?’ he asked, his voice dangerously quiet. ‘Now, want to tell me why you disobeyed me?’ His eyes flickered back over to Harry, still restrained on the sofa. ‘Was it Potter’s fault?’
,’ she said, as sternly as she could. Draco had told them to be
Harry sighs happily as he walks into Hermione and Ron’s house, instantly feeling the tension melt away. Hermione was the other member of his pack, her presence grounding her almost as much as Ron, and Peaseblossom Cottage was as much his home as Grimmauld Place. Harry has a tiny bed in the tiny spare room at the cottage so he can sleep over every so often. He often struggled at Grimmauld Place, as he was usually by himself in the cavernous old house. He slept much easier when he was enveloped in the scents of safety, could hear the steady breathing of his pack mates in the house.
‘You knew someone was after me,’ Harry realises, as his wolf howls in anger in his mind. ‘That’s why you had me and Draco work together on all those pointless cases. You used us as

, as Draco took a piece of apple pie for himself. Draco placed his hand over Harry’s, his fingers stroking against Harry’s, and Harry sighed happily. Draco knew he’d heard the sentiment returned in Draco’s gentle touch.
When Draco walks out of the Floo, Harry is standing next to a haphazard blanket fort, running an awkward hand through his hair.
Harry shakes his head, feeling utterly miserable. What would Malfoy do now, he wonders? Blackmail, extortion, just go to the

Before he can dwell on it, Potter drops a pile of case notes in front of Draco, and Draco jumps slightly at the dull thump as they land.
But most of all, Draco hated how he
Day 10: Draco x Harry - Cross-dressing
A crisp autumn day, skies blazing blue and leaves burnt orange.
He might be a traitorous little shit, but Harry couldn’t help missing him. Draco’s scent, his presence, those tiny, fleeting touches, had all been keeping Harry grounded more than he realised. His wolf was miserable as well, and it felt like it was constantly berating Harry.
Day 4: Charlie x Draco - Begging
Harry can’t help it. He leans forward, silences Draco’s stuttering with a long, lingering kiss, before licking the taste of Draco off his lips.
Malfoy just gives him a sharp nod of his head, getting to his feet and elegantly stretching his long, lean body as Harry tries desperately not to look. Instead he finishes his tea, feeling the steam hiss out of his ears. He scrambles to his own feet and follows Malfoy as he breaks the Notice-Me-Not and stalks back towards the Ministry.

It starts with an easy mistake, a careless lack of judgment that so rarely happens with Charlie.
‘I don’t need you to
‘Better now, thanks,’ Harry replies, holding Ron’s scent in his lungs as he acclimatised. They walk across the floor together, Ron dropping a soothing hand on Harry’s shoulder for a moment before they turn in opposite directions to their own desks. Harry catches Malfoy staring at him from the filing cabinets in the corner, and can’t help scowling in his direction.
‘Harry, Draco!’ Molly had enveloped them both in an enormous hug before they’d taken more than two steps out of the fireplace. Harry gave her a perfunctory kiss on the cheek and pulled free from her embrace, but Draco lingered for a few more moments.
Draco in heels, Harry can't stop staring, at the pub, re-connecting after years, mutual attraction, Draco x Harry, tribble
Harry doesn’t even bother reaching for his wand. He just closes his eyes, ignores Ron crying out ‘Harry, stop! You’ll hurt yourself!’, and turns on the spot, tearing down the DMLE wards around him with a grunt of pain, and Apparates away.
‘Merlin, I know, I’m sorry. He was just…’ Charlie falters, and Draco sighs against his skin.
Draco gives him a bemused look, raising an eyebrow as he takes an elegant sip of his own tea. ‘How long ago were you bitten?’ he repeats, slowly and carefully, as if speaking to a dullard.
Draco huffs. ‘She’s our friend.’
— no more,
Draco tries not to let it bother him, the way the Aurors are a tight-knit group with their in-jokes and their camaraderie and their ‘no wixen left behind’ ideals. Because while all that was true, it was only true as far as every Auror
‘Sir,’ he says, dropping into the chair next to Malfoy at Robards’ insistent hand wave.
And, Harry had to admit, it was nice speaking about being a werewolf freely, with someone new. He’d been bitten two years ago, on a routine Auror inspection with Ron that had turned out not-so-routine after all. The suspect, only a day away from the full moon, had lunged towards Harry, biting down on his shoulder and condemning him to his new fate.
Harry shakes his head before Ron’s even finished speaking. ‘No special treatment, Ron. It’s not as if I need protecting,’ he adds darkly, and is relieved to see a glimmer of a smile ghost across Ron’s lips. Harry reaches out, his irritability from earlier almost faded, and lays his hand over Ron’s. ‘I promise to let you know if it happens again, though, okay?’
‘What about your trousers?’ she whispered, her cheeks warming as she realised she was so wet she’d leave an instant mess over him.
Day 16: Draco x Hermione - Roleplay
Chapter 9: Felony
Only then would Blaise slide beneath the covers, running his hands down Draco’s flat, scarred stomach, his velvety soft skin. Blaise would hook his fingers into the waistband of Draco’s briefs, carefully pulling them down to expose Draco’s dick. Blaise would always pause here, listening for any change in Draco’s breathing, before gently reaching forward to nuzzle against his soft cock.
