Pansy asked to meet Harry for tea. Harry thought about lying and saying that he was too busy, but Pansy would have seen straight through it.
“That’s good,” Draco says. Ginny gives him an incredulous look, and Draco feels like screaming. He doesn’t know what he’s doing
The fourth time Draco gets a haircut, he has given up any pretense that this is a way to hide from wizarding eyes. Rather, it feels like
Blaise stands behind her, his arms crossed, a murky fury swirling in his eyes. Draco feels like his lungs have been crushed.
Harry is silent for a while. Draco keeps waiting for Harry to pull his hand away, but they never do.
Harry considers pointing out that he knows how to Apparate, but he’s touched that Malfoy is evidently so scared of his friends’ wrath. Ron and Hermione will be chuffed when Harry tells them. He climbs into the truck.
“You look like a prick,” Blaise says once he and Draco are walking out the door. “A rich white boy who runs to Daddy whenever times get tough.”
“I—“ Draco is going to die. Ginny Weasley is going to kill him, and the whole store will cheer, and there will be dancing in the street. Hopefully Blaise will weep at his funeral. “Blaise was supposed to meet me, but he isn’t
any dark magic, other than what the Dark Lord force-fed down his throat). Draco is guilty, and it makes no sense for him to walk free.
Maybe Draco is hallucinating. That would certainly explain all the Howlers that have been coming his way because no one, not even the likes of Luna Lovegood, would use a Howler to send a sweetly worded encouragement to leave the house.
Potter surveys Draco with wide, unblinking eyes, no doubt cataloguing everything wrong with Draco’s appearance.
Harry uses the Floo to go to Molly and Arthur’s house. He barely gets through the door when Molly is enveloping him into a bone-crushing hug.
Draco swallows and hesitantly touches Potter’s cheek. It’s warm against his hand, and the rough tickle of stubble brushes against his palm.
Harry pulls the ring from his pocket. It took him forever to find the right one. Draco was always so particular about what he wore, and Harry wanted to be sure that this was something Draco would want to wear for the rest of his life.
"He promised me," Harry says, his voice poised on the edge of a cliff, "that he was getting better."
to eat. Now that he’s a fifth year, the professors have started piling on more and more assignments. He can barely keep up as it is (no one can, except for Granger), but the professors don’t care.
“I didn’t think you were drunk,” Draco says, his voice hitching. “I just—I don’t know how to talk to people.”
Touching Harry is like caressing a star, a perfect, burning, bright source of light, alone in a black, empty sky.
"Let's go and show your grandma and grandad what amazing grandchildren they have," Harry said, giving Draco's shoulder a squeeze.
In the end he agreed to let Hermione book it all for him, while he diffidently sipped a beer... several beers, and took another look at that bloke with the surfboard. Not even his type, he thought, he preferred blonds; though who was he to be choosy these days?
are anything to go by. But swearing off it for the rest of your life seems a little extreme. You do know how long wizards live for, don't you?" Potter’s eyes widened, realisation dawning. Draco smirked. “I do hope your hands are up to the job of keeping you satisfied for the next hundred years.”
He knows all too well how corrosive and dangerous it is—he brewed it himself, after all—but it doesn't stop him greedily bringing his nose to the vial and sucking in deep.
“Oh. Nothing really. Just remembered Allison commenting that it wouldn’t be long before I had persuaded you round for tea and biccies, and she was right. She seems to be trying to pair us up.”
Draco couldn’t help the broken whimper that left his throat. Because that was all he’d wanted, that day eight months ago when he’d broken the news to his boyfriend. He’d just wanted Gabe to be there for him. But he’d lost the plot at Draco, and buggered off, the coward, and Draco had been alone all this time, unloved.
Draco would have found the whole thing quite amusing, on reflection. If only it hadn't turned out to be Harry fucking Potter.
Harry studied him under the dim, coloured lighting for a moment, licking his lips at the sight of the tiny beads of sweat that had gathered above Malfoy’s mouth, before nodding, “Yeah, thirsty, let’s get water.” He took a deep breath, letting out a happy sigh. “And chill out, yeah, let’s do it.”
Harry had known for a while that something had to give. Long days in the field and longer evenings completing paperwork had left him both frazzled and fractious, and it wasn't surprising that Head Auror Robards had sent him to the Department of Occupational Health (D'OH for short). They had referred him to Mind Healer Michael Rotchburns and after their sixth consultation,
Harry hissed under the cool touch of firm, oily hands on his skin. A sweet and woody fragrance drifted into his nostrils and filled his lungs. Vaguely familiar, calming, relaxing, and Harry exhaled a long breath as skilful hands worked a gentle figure-of-eight pattern—from his spine upward and out to the tip of his shoulder and back under to repeat on the other side.
something. He focuses on the light drag of Potter's nails against his scalp and lets his breathing slow and his mind go blank and fuzzy.
What made things worse was that Smith seemed to know this. “I heard your street is no longer worthy competition this year, Malfoy,” Smith said smugly, as the cheese assistant passed him a wrapped boule of Edam. “What a pity.”
, and I'd recommend a thorough massage to help you relax. I can even guarantee that this one will be tailored to your specific needs and have a much
“Come in,” Draco said, and he called to his team that he’d see them tomorrow. They knew that was their cue to leave. Pineneedle’s eyes were wide when he saw ‘Epicure’ by Draco’s side as he collected his own robes and headed off.
itinerary he'd ever seen. Harry had started to feel a bit queasy looking at the huge, colour-coded sheaf of parchments, and Ron even commented that his face had turned a very unique shade of pale green. Which was apparently the colour for Wednesday, the day he would be doing a nature walk in the
“Thanks… ah…?” replied Potter. His brow was shining with sweat, and his hands shook a little. Draco had never seen him look so distressed.
—and sometime between the start of their weekly broom trips to countryside picnic spots (Spring, 1999) and the invitation to Harry's Auror graduation ceremony (Summer, 2000). And it was definitely before their first kiss (5th June, 2000). Because he'd never forget Harry's breathless
curious to see where the Golden Boy of the wizarding world lived. He imagined it would be a cross between student digs and the Gryffindor common room.
“That feels amazing,” Draco sighed. “Every pregnant person should have a Potter to massage their achey feet. It should be law.”
Draco was at his wit's end. The judges for the contest were set to walk along the village's various streets in two days, and Potter’s garden was still an abomination. Every angle he’d tried had failed miserably, and he had run out of ideas.
Once done, Blaise offered Harry the first toke, but Harry shook his head. “Nah, mate. Thanks.” Blaise shrugged and offered it to Pansy, who closed her eyes and took a long drag and then handed it back, the end now all crimson-smudged and shiny. Harry used to enjoy a joint on occasion, but he’d stopped enjoying it lately; weed just made him paranoid now rather than chilling him out.
“Oh, I hear you. I’m actually wondering whether to start bringing the baby’s buggy we bought to class, so that I can push Eoin home in it. He’s always shattered and crabby by the end of the day.”
When Draco arrived at antenatal class the following week, Potter was already in the room and chatting animatedly to Neil and Langston. Langston cut quite a swashbuckling figure in a billowy white shirt and knee high leather boots, and Draco didn’t miss Potter surreptitiously glancing at the bit of chest hair on display as he talked. Draco remembered that both Potter and Langston worked at the Ministry; Langston was on the Invisibility Task Force, and Potter trained Aurors. And thinking of work, Draco realised he
"I'd appreciate if I could view those first," comes the voice of the Magister from behind him, firm and authoritative.
Two days had since passed, and Draco was beginning to feel rather stupid. He'd hoped that Potter would have come to find him by now, but he was running out of ideas as he sat at the same beachside pop-up bar for the third evening in a row with the sun casting long shadows from behind the trees on the shore and the ubiquitous dance music steadily growing in volume.
He let Potter in, and Draco hadn’t even managed to lead him to the kitchen before Potter was apologising and insisting that Draco was right to say what he thought, and that he actually appreciated Draco’s honesty, and that he
Draco was amused and satisfied by Potter's reaction: he drew a short gasp and his eyes grew wide with surprise. Then he nodded and hurriedly flagged the waiter over, ordering them another round.
“Didn’t want to have to take the stairs,” Draco replied, returning her smile. “Otherwise I’d have to collapse on a plastic chair in reception, too feeble to tackle the walk home.”
By the time they got back to their B&B in Thorney Hill, a little red-brick place with a thatched roof on the outskirts of the forest, they were both eager to wash their hands of all they'd heard, and in their shared bathroom, doing just that, was where they'd first felt it.
His enthusiasm was fast waning. He didn’t know what he was doing wrong. Almost everyone he knew could cast a Patronus at this stage. His friends had all picked it up over the years: Blaise’s silvery owl, Pansy’s elegant antelope, Theo’s playful squirrel. Even Greg had managed it, though it had taken much longer than the others. It wasn't as strong as theirs either, but he’d managed to cast his shimmery king crab a couple of times when it had been required (the first time he’d done it, his face had fallen at its form, but he’d quickly gathered himself at everyone’s insistence that Vince would have laughed his head off about it). But not Draco. He’d tried and tried to successfully cast the spell, and that’s what led him to speculate that his choice to take the Mark at sixteen years of age had doomed him to a Patronus-free existence.
"We're not entirely sure," Draco answers, "but we'd like to take a closer look at this picture of the Triple Goddess."
"Master Harry, too?" Kreacher's eyes widened further, and then he snapped his fingers. “Begging Mrs Potts' pardon," he cried, jumping onto a chair and lifting her carefully into his arms, "Kreacher is knowing what to do!"
two days off work lounging at home in his ratty jogging bottoms and ordering takeaway like the last time.
Because, in that one instant, his whole world had turned inside out and upside down. He honestly didn't even give a monkey's about the fact that Potter had been as hard as an iron Bludger (though there was a small part of him that was immensely pleased about that), it was just such a solid-gold bolt from the blue to see him. Everything that Draco had carefully bottled up and stoppered tight had rushed up all at once to choke him.
, who knew intimately the horrors of the war, and could imagine what things had been like for him in its wake. Even if that person had thought he deserved it, thought he'd got off easy.
He decided it was time to flick through Hermione's handy guide and choose a nice restaurant to eat at; he was a bit bloody hungry after all that drama.
If you haven’t read the fic then you are in for the best treat ever (not counting Kreacher’s homemade scones, of course).
He's there as always. In my dream. In the blazing glare of that blasted railway station, scuffing the toe of his trainer into some imaginary dirt.
. Even if he’s feeling a bit leery about it all. And more than a bit sick. He pulls on a Pulp t-shirt and tucks it into his jeans. And then he looks in the mirror and untucks it again.
. It's nothing to be embarrassed about. We're both men and we know the, ahm, libido works in mysterious ways. Your body is relaxing, possibly for the first time in a while, and it's allowing blood to flow freely wherever it wants to go. If you don't wish to continue, I understand, though I feel there's more benefit to be gained in continuing. The loosening of your muscles in this short time is palpable. It certainly seems some time since you've had proper stimulation, so..."
"Oh, 'bloody hell' yourself, Potter," Draco retorted. "And how should I know where she's gone? She's your teapot!"
It was a gruesome tale to say the least. The roommates were both only twenty years old. But something had felt off about it. It niggled at Draco.
“That’s what you’re supposed to look like when you’re heavily pregnant. That’s what we all look like in here. Ugh, well except for that bloke Sam.” Draco narrowed his eyes. “
Harry knew the drug must be kicking in but his mind was clear. He didn’t feel daydreamy or stoned; he just wanted to move his body along with the kaleidoscope of people dancing to the beat. The music moved him, took hold of his hips and tugged them into an easy undulation as he raised his arms with the crowd, eyes closed and heart racing.
Draco put his cup down and looked at Potter in disbelief. “I’d have thought that was perfectly obvious,” he said, gesturing at his stomach.
She closed the door and waved, and as the car pulled out into the mid-morning London traffic, Harry rested his head on Draco’s shoulder, and Draco thought that things were maybe going to be alright.
Breath came in wheezing gasps punctuated by his own whining wails. His whole body ached and a strange, giddy feeling surged through him.
They walked carefully towards the quivering layer of air obstructing their vision, and Harry prodded it with his wand. It wobbled and shimmered but his wand went straight through without any fizzing or sparks.
Potter’s friend. If only he’d known at age eleven that a small bit of humility and caring (especially when it came to Potter’s friends) and a few apologies over a hot meal were all it took.
in the mood for a shag, if that was all the same to Draco. Draco had spluttered with momentary indignation which quickly changed to mortified and hasty reassurances, and thankfully Harry had agreed with him that a lie down was probably the next best thing to a cup of tea for calming his frayed nerves. Though it hadn't stopped him lamenting the lack of a decent cuppa for a good minute or two. And then that led on to a mournful elegy to his lost teapot.
“For not replying to your owl. I just wanted a bit of time to think about things. I- I suppose I felt foolish for thinking that we were... that we were maybe going to be... a thing.”
seen Potter’s body before. He found he could not stop staring at his prominent collarbones, or the scarred planes of his ribcage, and that he was helpless to avoid his gaze sliding down to the obscenely sharp v-cut of Potter's pelvis. Things were made worse when Potter turned to get something from the fridge, back muscles shifting as he reached for something on a low shelf. That morning Draco had to back out of the kitchen to get a large gulp of air.
Turning over, putting his back defiantly to Potter, Draco counts his deep breaths, trying to ease the race of his heart and lull himself to sleep.
If Harry knew one thing about himself it was that there was no way he would be able to ignore the whole thing and pretend it never happened, much as he might want to. He had to find out what Malfoy was doing here.
He's jolted awake though by Potter stuttering, "W-what?" And Draco realises Potter’s fingers have frozen in place in his hair.
Draco sits down next to him on the rooftop. “It attacks every Lunar New Year and the only things it fears are the colour red and loud cracking noises.” A swish of his wand and the pops and bangs of fireworks burst above their heads. “But you needn’t worry. I’ve got you.”
Potter was laughing again, and Draco felt nothing but relief to see it. "I'll ensure you get an Order of Merlin for your brave sacrifice," Potter said, popping the rest of his peach wedge into his mouth.
“I’d really like it to be your business.” He took a step forward and took Potter’s hand. The sleeve of his jumper was a bit too long and Draco shoved it up his wrist and linked his fingers with Potter’s. “I know we never decided what we were. But I’d like us to still be
There was no drive to outdo each other with wit and one-upmanship; the conversations were to-the-point, with little hesitation or affectation. Harry had never experienced anything like it. The openness and compassion he felt towards his friends. Their simple, clear acceptance of him exactly as he was.
"Ah, right. Hmm." And to Draco's dismay, Harry looked at his watch and said, "I'm going out today for a bit, lads, if that's okay."
Eoin was up next, and he had difficulty keeping his Patronus non-corporeal. It seemed to want to stubbornly remain as a boa constrictor, which had everyone sucking their teeth in concern. When it began wrapping itself tightly around the babe, Fordus stepped in with a diplomatic "Excellent work, Eoin, though could benefit from some slight finessing." Draco exchanged a glance with Potter, who was snickering behind his hand.
“Yeah, alright." Potter sat up a bit straighter and ran a hand through his dark curls. "So, er, what… what sort of parent do you want to be? What do you want for your kid?”
Potter takes one big step and the next thing his hands are either side of Draco's head, fingers in his hair as he pulls their mouths together. It's a quick, hot kiss, just lips and a little flick of tongue, but it still draws a desperate noise from Draco: half-whine, half-moan.
gratitude, and Potter was singling Draco out for thanks. Draco’s head ached, and he could hardly make sense of Potter’s words, except for snatches of
Harry's breathing gradually evened out under Draco's firm instruction and even firmer hand. As his eyes slowly cleared, the room began to brighten. The cellar suddenly seemed a lot less cramped, the dark shadows having been shooed away, and the piles of furniture and boxes were now sitting innocuously and were no longer the forbidding and confusing labyrinth they had seemed moments ago.
But then Draco's own neck began to itch. And he could no longer deny it. There was definitely something wrong. He lifted his hand to scratch his neck and Potter tracked the movement.
rather disappointed that you two didn't seem to, ah, warm to each other. Things had gotten so strained, so it's marvellous news to hear you've decided to turn over a new leaf."
"—he grins and jabs at his own chest, and Harry cackles—"that it could be used therapeutically by Mind Healers. Particularly for post-traumatic stress disorders! Which, as you'll no doubt agree, quite a few people could find useful."
He feels Potter’s arm which had been draped across the back of the sofa move infinitesimally and just barely land on his shoulders, and he opens his eyes and stiffens for a split second only to relax again into its warmth and security. They do this, too, sometimes. All the better to get comfy and relaxed.
Draco had always liked things to be just so. Ever since he was a child he'd placed great importance on how things looked, always striving to maintain the most positive and appealing image for the outside world. And that was reflected in his house and garden.
By the time the car dropped him off at the villa complex, he'd lost count of the number of hours he'd been travelling—or even what day it was—and was ready for a proper rest. Only the villa Hermione had organised wasn't ready yet. He checked his baggage with the concierge (first retrieving a pair of cheerful speedos and picking up a complimentary beach towel in a delightful shade of sunshine yellow) and followed their directions to a nearby popular tourist establishment to get a post-flight pick-me-up (cocktail) and a bite to eat (the fruit in the aforementioned cocktail). It would be a few hours before he could check in officially, but they'd have his things taken to his villa as soon as it was ready.
Harry braced in anticipation, waiting for a blow from some madman called 'Father', clearly the head of this creepy Dark clan. Moments passed like eternities. Desperate, he tried a wandless
Teddy and James were delighted with their costumes, too. James was a jolly Mr Smee and Teddy a cheeky pirate. They were both over the moon with the small toy swords that Draco had asked Grandpa Arthur to make for them, and were having enormous fun choreographing an elaborate fight scene in the hallway.
Potter's baby. A baby Potter. Draco had no idea why but it was overwhelming to think of it. He felt a swoop of adrenaline as he cast. A thin strand of silvery gas fluttered out of his wand and evaporated after a few seconds.
Potter sat. He didn’t say anything for a few moments, but when he did he looked right into Draco’s eyes, and it looked like he’d just had an epiphany. "It's bonkers levels of
Draco's heart raced. "Green eyes, yes. Ugly cap... strong possibility." Draco remembered Potter's atrocious dress sense from weekends at Hogwarts. You'd have thought someone raised by Muggles would know how to dress like one! And then Draco's heart clenched with guilt, remembering the rumours of the awful treatment he'd suffered as a small child.
The low commotion of pre-dawn London made its way in, a simple melody in its chaos. The cars and buses as they drove past the park, a couple of drunk lovers giggling and stumbling along the path, their heads pressed together as they supported each other towards a park bench and landed heavily on it.  A brief blare of music and shouting as somewhere up the street emptied out and it almost, almost drowned out the low
And so they drank tea, and ate their teacakes, and smoothed out the foil into perfect squares, and then, after they cleared up, Potter stood behind Draco, arm around his middle, grounding him, while Draco cast, using the memory of the kiss they'd just shared. A silvery wispy plume issued from his wand, dissipating after a few seconds, but Draco was ecstatic, and they practised and practised until Draco was able to hold and direct the shimmering gas.
Biting cold air rushed over him, and the hair on his arms, legs and scalp rose up in protest. He felt stripped bare. Exposed. A fierce shiver tore through him, an icy chill that seeped into his blood and bones. He thought of his family, hoped desperately they were safe.
On the first of August, the day after a most subdued birthday party for Harry, Phoenix Malfoy and Holly Potter both decided it was time to enter the world, at five minutes to nine in the morning and twenty past one in the afternoon, respectively. Pansy did a sterling job as birth partner for Draco, only fainting twice, and not minding in the least when Draco swore blue murder at her.
"I only ever— Yes." Draco eyed him with curiosity. "I do only take one. But I need the sugar now. In fact, I recommend it."
But even as he said the incantation he knew—it wasn't going to work. And he was right. Not even a hiss this time. He felt tears well in his eyes. Merlin curse these baby hormones, he never usually cried over anything. And then, as always, came the guilt for thinking ill about his pregnancy.
“Fuck, look at you, Malfoy,” Potter rasped, and Draco was so turned on it wasn’t funny, the feel of Potter’s touch on his exposed sensitive skin going straight to his dick, and then, right on cue, the baby kicked. Hard. Potter pulled his hands away.
Potter's eyes widened before he called back, "Yeah, just a bit itchy. Think that lady at the B&B used some aggressive dry-cleaning charms on our robes." Potter was always good at thinking on his feet.
He felt as if he’d simply stepped outside the worn paths in his brain and, in the process, gained some perspective on his life.
Hermione frowned at him. And then she chewed her lip, smirked and said, "Actually, that might be just the thing for you."
"I love you, Draco Malfoy," Potter says, soft and clear. And Draco shakes his head, because this can't be fucking real. Potter chuckles. "Feels so weird to get to say that now. And you. Love. Me."
“And that’s okay! You guys can do what you like. You were a couple for years, it’s understandable you both still have feelings for each other. I’m happy for you. Well, happy-ish.” He gave a listless chuckle.
“I'll take that,” Draco holds his hand out for Harry's jacket. Then adds. “Nice t-shirt,” and Harry looks down, having lost all memory of what he was wearing.
Inside, framed black and white pictures of boxing legends and signed photos of recent boxing stars adorned the mirrored walls and moulded wallpaper. Tables of mock-wood Formica and a tapioca-coloured ceiling completed the picture. The menu boasted a Strongman Breakfast and a Brawler Brunch, and Harry's stomach rumbled. There was a song playing in the background, the female vocals soulful and smoky and chilled.
Draco growled to himself as he focused on the coordinates for the Prophet headquarters. He was going to need to work on his comebacks if he was to have any chance of getting through to Potter.
"Not so fast!" Potter's shout brings his focus back to the present. Placid's wand flies in front of his face and across the room into Potter's hand. The Magister bellows in fury and lurches at Draco. Reacting purely on instinct, Draco's fist connects with Placid's cheekbone, hard. It bloody hurts his knuckles, and Draco is momentarily shocked by how darkly satisfying it feels. Conjured cords swoop and encircle the Magister's free hand, binding it to the other behind his back. He falls to the side, thrashing wildly.
“And I never once got morning sickness. I was lucky I suppose. To be honest, morning horniness has been my issue. Dear Salazar, still is," Draco laughed. "Like you, I could barely keep a thing down, but it was a different
“Malfoy?!” Potter said. His eyes were still like saucers, but his full thick lashes were blinking in surprise. “I didn’t know
Potter snatched his hand away and clutched at his chest. "Prime assets? Glory? Malfoy, if I didn't know any better, I'd think you were impressed by what you saw." He threw Draco a filthy smirk which had Draco's cock twitching in his shorts. "Also, you are
"Yes," Draco replied. "Do you know what else feels extremely pleasant?" He straddled the bench they were sitting on. "You face away from me. I'll give you a massage."
While the need for frequent touches has certainly subsided, it seems to have been replaced in Potter with an ongoing need to stare and smile. Draco's used to the staring—it started at their Sorting in First Year and has never abated—but the smiling, that's new.
of you knew what to do at the very least." Robards sighs exaggeratedly and raises his eyes to the ceiling, and Draco wants to sink into a hole in the ground. "What I'm struggling with here, gentlemen, so please help me out if you could, is why in the name of Helga's sweet bosoms you decided to keep this to yourself for
. Then he sprawls out, starfish-like, and chuckles. Cold moonlight stripes his chest. Cold fingers reach into mine. And a little more of me fades. Magical dilution, Granger calls it.
"And by help," Hestia interjected, "Mrs Potts does of course mean the three tenets of a harmonious household and a happy home; namely perfectly brewed tea, home-baked treats, and a considerate and genial atmosphere borne of kind words and actions."
Purple was James’ favourite colour, so he went for the deep violet lisianthuses. And Teddy showed off his newly-learned Severing and Levitation charms on a few stems of soft pink roses, saying “Not putting my hands near

is how they ended up sitting at opposite ends of the dining room in stony silence, stewing in their own resentment-filled juices, drinking sub-par tea made in a saucepan, and neither able to fathom where their beloved belongings had disappeared to, nor bring themselves to ask the other for help.
When their drinks arrived, Draco was already part-way through a summary of his travels through parts of Europe—France, Germany, Italy, Spain—where he'd found the Muggle British holidaymakers to be most irksome: always asking him if he missed 'home' and telling him how there was 'no place like it' and how good it always felt to get back to Blighty after their holiday. He supposed that, being Muggle, the after-effects of the war, or indeed its occurrence at all, were largely lost on them.
“It was that Gabriel guy, wasn’t it? The model? I saw pictures of you two in some paper or magazine a while back. He was hot.” Potter fanned himself with his hand.
A slight but appreciable paranoia tickles the bottom of Harry’s spine as he whooshes through Floospace.
“Er, no, it’s fine, I just haven't been here before.” He began looking across the crowd for Luna and Ginny.
had he not heard about this? The man was in the news every other week. Usually having been snapped at a posh function, or stumbling out of a club with some beau or other. But, thinking about it now, he’d not seen much coverage of Potter in the last few months. Because there’d be no hiding that swollen abdomen. Was Potter trying to keep it quiet?
Harry heaved himself up to a sitting position causing Scorpius and Al to yelp as they tumbled sideways onto the mattress.
“Indeed.” Draco bit into a cereal bar. It was very… oaty. He’d have much preferred a bar of Dairy Milk.
Draco understood why Pineneedle was so pleased. The Aberdeen angus steak was Floyd’s signature dish, and one that he could do in his sleep. Draco was going to have no problem impressing Potter, and he was no expert in Divination but he was absolutely certain that a good review was in his future—if Potter could find it in himself to overlook their shaky past.
He stood in the empty men’s room and concentrated hard. He could do this. He thought of Harry’s smiling face, Harry telling Draco how much he liked him, and he felt the happiness rise within him. Not wanting to waste that feeling, he cast.
Sure enough, there standing at the busy bamboo-bedecked bar two doors down was a man with a cap that, although hideously tangerine, did accent the striking green of his eyes. And those eyes were looking straight at Draco.
It was a pernicious strain of the Black Cat Flu that did for her. Crippling to most, but deadly to the elderly.
They question her about the curse, and she looks terrified. "It wasn't me!" she insists. "It was... it affected both Trista and me. We... we..." She lets out a loud sob and puts her face in her hands.
According to Harry, the kettle had taken a dislike to him from the outset. And he'd been nothing but nice to it!
The matron heaved a harried sigh, pursed her lips and said, “Alright then,” and Granger didn’t need to be told twice. She was over to Harry’s other side in a shot.
Draco's heart swoops, and he rolls on top of Potter, chest to chest, legs to legs, groin to groin. "I do hope you have your wand handy, then, Potter."
“You may have. It was only me who wore the disguise. He's a Muggle, so unable to cast a glamour, obviously. Also…" Draco paused, embarrassed, "...he said it didn’t give off the right look for him to be seen out with a Malfoy. He's read up on his wizarding culture and history, you see. Wanted to be successful in both the Muggle and wizarding fashion worlds. And to be fair, people were
pleasurable, and he's getting used to the little zap of electricity, perhaps because it heralds more touching. Which he likes.
“Anyway, the neighbour was able to cast Bluebell Flames at the plant's roots and it shrank back. Good thing Mr Potter got knocked out really, as it meant he didn't struggle and tighten the vines around him. Plus the poison has strong hallucinogenic properties so he’s better off tucked up here in bed than wandering around the neighbourhood thinking he’s Emeric the Evil.”
"What?" Draco was having trouble remembering what they were talking about, drunk as he was on vodka and sweet liqueur and the dark emerald of Potter's eyes.
It was several moments before Potter calmed himself down enough to talk, but he was still grinning from ear to ear. “So,
They said goodbye to Eoin and Allison, and Draco couldn’t have sworn it but it looked like Allison winked at Potter.
. Trista was mine! I don't know why my wand showed the Killing Curse!" She breaks down then, sobbing and hiccuping.
That year had held so many horrors, but none so terrifying as having a Dark Lord and his henchmen bed-and-breakfasting with him in his childhood home, sprawling themselves over their good chaise longues and tapping billywig cigarette ash over the card table where Mother did her needlework.
And so Potter spent the next ten minutes elaborating on his strict agenda for each day as arranged by Granger, who was clearly determined to have Potter visit every possible place of interest on the island and have less than five minutes relaxation time a day. All throughout Draco laughed with Potter,
"I shall only heat water for descendants of the Black family, their spouses or house-elves, and you are none of those things." Hestia rattled her lid distastefully.
Thankfully, Pineneedle seemed to realise that Draco was spiralling and hurried to the kitchen hearth to fire-call St Mungo's.
Now, I hide the lighters and the matches, even though Draco has Incendio anyway. I see him eyeing the unlit candles on Luna's sideboard, see his fingers twitch when Pansy lights a cigarette.
Draco from the club. His hair looks normal—normal colour, normal shininess, a bit like it was at school. And his face is clear of decoration, save for a pinkness on each cheek and a bit of acne on his chin. And Harry likes it, likes normal Draco. It's a relief.
Joanna looks terrible when the Auror on duty slides back the warded cell door. Draco takes in her red-rimmed eyes, the tear streaks cutting clean pathways through grimy skin, her hair a greasy dark-blonde tangle. She's sitting on the floor, knees to her chin.
So as he hurried past the bell tower of St Mary-Le-Bow, he reminded himself firmly: he’d do anything for this baby. Anything.
“Hi granny and granda in the ground,” said Lily, waving her hand at the grave. “I love you, and I love Daddy and Papa, and I love Ted and Jamie and the baby in papa’s tummy, and I love Bob.” The boys laughed. Bob was her bendy plastic Bowtruckle.
They don't know for sure who cast the spell, but their first thought is their murder suspect, Goodsister Joanna, who's now in a holding cell awaiting trial.
But she was given barely ten seconds to reminisce before being subjected to a wholly unnecessary dressing down from the old elf.
Potter seemed to be unaware of everything that was going through Draco’s head and kept smiling obliviously. “The restaurant is really brilliant, Malfoy. I’m impressed. Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that my friend, Cho, you’ll remember her from Hogwarts, right, and”—he chuckled—”who’s just chosen this moment to go to the ladies, is a professional Quidditch player and is on a strict low-fat and high-carbohydrate diet, which needs to incorporate some type of protein too, so she was really hoping you could accommodate that. Will it be a problem?”
After Ginny and Luna left to go dance and snog, Harry talked further with Draco. Words came easily, without the halting uncertainty that Harry often noticed in himself when he attempted to talk to others about his upbringing, about what Hogwarts meant to him, about the war, about what he’d had to do on that dark, dark day, about walking to face his own death. And as he spoke, penetrating insights about the events of his life seemed to flow through him, like he was walking through beaded curtains into each memory and seeing it all from a new angle.
Luna plonked herself down in between Harry and Draco on the wooden bench, a jinglejangle of necklaces and bangles as she threw an arm around both of them.
Chef Marco had the whole team on high alert. At the slightest sign or hint of Epicure they were to let him know so that he could give Epicure the best dining experience of their life.
There was a stutter of a moment where the masseur's breath went a little odd, and then he was squeezing the meat of Harry's thighs, a little harshly Harry thought. Harry bit back a bone-deep groan, and tried his damnedest to keep his back from arching, and then the man's hands were retreating. Harry took another breath. He heard the clink of glass, and after a moment he felt freshly-oiled hands slippery on his calves, and he was almost dizzy with how good it felt. The scents of the oils combined with the the sliding pressure along his legs was intoxicating and undeniably arousing, and if he was honest the masseur's voice was sort of sexy too—
There were still so many things for Draco to worry about. Potter not being the critic meant the actual critic was still to be expected, and Draco also worried about how much
Malfoy pulled away after only a moment, cheeks flushed pink and eyes sparkling. "I've been wanting to do that for the past three days."
But Potter went all quiet then and said, “Do you?” and well, Draco couldn’t back down then. And he probably meant it, really, if he was honest with himself.
"Trickery! Trickery and subterfuge!" Hestia shrieked, before quickly regaining some composure. She fixed Mrs Potts with a stern glare. "You
After a short talk about heartburn, piles and Braxton Hicks, which was useful in terms of a few treatments Draco hadn't thought of—though he could have done without a couple of the fathers-to-be sharing personal stories that Draco very much felt came under the TMI umbrella—Fordus explained what their exercise would be. It turned out to be a heart-to-heart with your ‘partner’, and even Draco groaned this time at the prospect, though not as loud as Potter.

that Draco finds he can tolerate it quite easily. Plus Potter's taken up the guitar recently, so there's that. He's not very good, but it's sickeningly endearing hearing him trying to strum and sing along to
Harry wasn’t sure what to expect, but he knew things like this probably took a while to take effect. He stood in the corner of the bar, watching people, feeling the erotic bassline, letting it pulse through him, allowing his body to sway a little, along with the beat. He sipped his beer, eyeing the crowd, when all of a sudden everything changed.
So actually, Harry'd thought as he levitated his trunk over the threshold of Draco's terraced cottage, there was nothing to be nervous about. Nothing could possibly come between them that they couldn't laugh off, or settle decisively with a tumble in Draco's—
, his wand had probably fallen out, and it could be anywhere between here and the sun lounger he'd been occupying.
"Well, if that isn't the pot calling the kettle black," Draco retorted hotly after Harry had just branded him 'unreasonable'. In any other situation he'd have laughed at the idiom, particularly considering the kettle was a Black family heirloom, and so he technically
Thankfully Hermione came through for Harry, quite clearly still at the top of her researching game, arriving at Grimmauld with a stack of travel brochures and a complex chart she'd drawn up comparing destinations, hotels, proximity to the beach, travel expenses and even WokeWix ratings (a godawful social media platform for 'digitised post-war wixes'). Harry enjoyed looking at the pictures of sandy beaches and palm trees, but he switched off when Hermione tried to explain her six sigma Pareto diagram.
Never in all her years did Hestia Seraphina Black think she'd have to stoop to making nice with a common teapot. One with no heritage whatsoever and looking like she had come straight from a jumble sale.
but the words wouldn't form in his mouth. A cacophony of laughter and expectant banging erupted around him, and the world tilted and jolted violently. Harry's whole body tensed against the sudden movements. His mind caught the end of a spell, scarcely audible above the intensifying din.
That was the professional view of Healer Rotchburns at any rate. Harry wasn't sure what lying on a beach, doing nothing but getting sand up his crack was going to do for his splitting headaches or mood swings, but there it was—one prescription for Mr Harry James Potter: a large dose of somewhere hot and sunny, and far away, and
"Give over you prat," Draco chided, levitating the teabags into the bin, "and don't mock it before you've tried it."
Harry complied, and Draco began sliding his hands up Harry's sides over the fabric of his t-shirt and up his back. Over his shoulders, down his arms, thumbs and fingers applying pressure in all the right places. He felt he'd turned to water under Draco’s touch, fluid and rippling. Harry had never experienced this much pleasure from a simple massage. It felt like Draco had twelve hands.
Draco kept looking at articles. He read about Luna and Percy and people he didn’t even know, some of them Muggles. He asked Pansy question after question, to the point that he was worried they
If he were paying attention, he would have noticed the witch slipping her wand out from her robes and pointing it at his feet. But he didn’t, so now he’s falling.
Draco has managed a few spoonfuls, but it takes everything in him not to spit them out as soon as they go past his lips.
Malfoy slides into a parking spot at Wafflemeister, then turns to look at Harry, cocking her eyebrow.
He has to shake Potter’s hand because the world is watching. It will seem so ungrateful if Draco doesn’t.
“But why, Draco?” Narcissa asks, aghast. She and Draco sit in what passes as her sitting room in her tiny flat in London.
“I don’t wanna wake up,” Draco mumbles, because that will mean back to the cold, to the emptiness inside, to the people that spit on him in the streets.
The wizard is screaming something, and Harry is prying the wizard off of Draco, but Draco can't hear a word they're saying. Draco's hair is caught on the rough brick, and the cold wall is biting through his clothes into his skin.
Draco knows he deserves this, but he can't bring himself to care. He's so cold, all the time, and nothing he does will ever make him warm. He doesn't want to be here anymore. He is so
“I’m gonna shut up now,” Potter says, snapping his gaze away. He awkwardly offers Draco the cauldron. “Crockpot. I made soup.”
Malfoy loses it at that. She’s laughing so hard that tears are running down her face, and then all of a sudden her head is buried in her arms, and she’s sobbing for real.
Draco thinks about saying no. He feels like a little kid again, offering his hand to Potter on the train, except this time Potter is the one offering friendship. Draco half-expects Potter to yank his hand away at any moment, laughing, and shout,
“I don’t—particularly like you, I suppose. But I think you’ve—you’ve served your time. I’m not going to keep punishing you. Plus, you’re sick.”
This does not have the devastating impact Draco had hoped for. Instead, Pansy howls with laughter, apparently so overcome with the hilarity of Draco becoming friends with a
The next article Draco read was far less complimentary, frequently misgendering and deadnaming Percy and prominently displaying a photo of him hexing a reporter who got too close to him and his family. Something uncomfortable twisted inside Draco’s stomach as he read, and he eventually had to just put it aside.
When Tessa rattles off the price, Draco pulls out the Muggle money. Except the numbers are swimming before his eyes, and the slips of paper and coins don’t make
. I'm so sorry, Malfoy. What do I owe you?" He pulled his wallet out of the the pocket of his white shorts—fuck they made his legs look good—and began riffling through its contents.
He’d have much rather Apparated, but of course that wasn’t a possibility; that sort of magical travel—Apparating, Flooing, broom-flying and Portkeying—had sadly been off the cards for the past ten weeks. So instead he was forced to dodge out of the way of Muggles on their way to Pret for almond croissants or Greggs for bacon rolls. He’d glamoured his large belly of course. (Merlin, could you imagine the threat to the Statute if a Muggle spotted a thirty-two week pregnant man?) But the bump was very much there, despite its invisibleness, and Draco could very much feel it, even if it did look like a trim, flat stomach right at that particular moment.
“Does that mean you’ll go out with me now that you don’t need to worry about corrupting me in my line of work?” Potter asked, interrupting Draco’s train of thought.
Draco peeked through the curtains in his living room for the seventh time, waiting for Pansy to emerge.
with just that little bit of aggressive emphasis, but he pushed that thought away. “Well, I’ll be going by 'Father', so that won’t apply…”
They fell into each other on the sofa, laughing, after a few cleaning charms had been cast; still a bit sweaty, a bit flushed, but giddy with the sheer amazement of it. The relief of finally connecting on that weird and thrilling ‘we just made each other come’ level, a breathless freedom, cumbersome and clumsy as it was. But just what they both needed.
In the end he decided just to choose a memory he'd used before and hope for the best. Either way he was undoubtedly going to badly embarrass himself. And in front of Patronus-prodigy-Potter to boot.
“I’ve called you a cab,” she said, opening the door of it. She helped Harry clamber in the back, and then Draco too. It smelled of stale cigarettes and beer and weak disinfectant, and Draco reached into his shoulder bag for his small atomiser of
scruffy eager-eyed boy entered his memory and he faltered on the last syllable. In his memory his heart had leapt at the sight of the boy, but here, now, in this room, his heart dropped with the weight of knowledge that his younger self had been innocent of. How badly he’d fucked up their first interactions… and all that had followed thereafter.
"You blokes alright?" Miriam Entwhistle, Finian's partner, shouted across the open-plan office. She'd obviously been watching them.
Draco winced. Potter was right. “Yes, well. Point of clarification, I would probably have called you Scarhead, but yes, that does sound like me.” He paused, then added, “Sorry.” Potter just laughed, the soft-headed pillock, and Draco smiled back and realised he was getting a little bit fond of him.
Potter responds, all business. "We're here to ask some more questions about Goodsisters Trista and Joanna. May we see the room where they slept one more time?"
Before he could change his mind, he tipped the liquid into his mouth. It tasted unpleasantly bitter on his tongue, and it was a relief to wash it down with a gulp of beer.
"Correct. That'll be the Absolut vodka, splash of pinot grigio, Vok peach liqueur, peach puree, topped off with sparkling pinot noir—which gives it that pretty pink colour—garnished with a peach wedge. And the secret tangy ingredient? A dash of DeKuyper Sour Apple Pucker." Potter gaped at him. "Oh, and I almost forgot... the very lickable vanilla sugar rim."
Fordus had charmed a baby-doll to cry and fuss, and the group watched while Neil cast a perfect wispy Patronus over the doll which curled around its tiny torso and the doll quietened within seconds. Bloody show-off, Draco thought.
Draco groaned loudly. "Potter, If this is your idea of flirting, I'm afraid it's going to be a long week."
The night before his departure, Harry was beyond ready for this break. Not because he'd had an epiphany of agreement with Healer Rotchburns' recommendation. Not because he'd managed to catch up on the outstanding case reports and notes cluttering his mind and his desk. But because he'd grown sick of the insufferable nuisance that was the '
Draco feels the prickle of a light Protego, and he's momentarily awed by Potter's ability to exercise such subtlety. He's grateful for the protection too, and he fights to keep the fond smile from his face at Potter's neverending thoughtfulness.
Harry had stayed up late after Draco went to bed, wanting to see the end of a 'Foil, Arms and Hog' sketch comedy special. He'd been to see the comedy trio live when he visited Dublin for Seamus's thirtieth birthday—
, he supposed, reaching the beach and kicking his shoes off, sinking his toes into the hot sand for a few moments. It was likely the best thing he'd done in his life so far, according to the British wizarding population, leaving the country and staying abroad for so long. And the best thing he could have done for himself too, all things considered.
Harry looked up at Draco, whose concerned expression had cleared, lips quirked up in amusement. He kissed one corner of Draco's mouth, and then the other. "Yep. A dastardly tickling overlord."
Potter's fingers traced the crease between Draco’s thigh and groin. "So, I can’t touch you? How's that gonna work, mate, you want me to wank you off with sexy magic vibes or something?" Draco snorted and then thrust against Potter, letting his erection introduce itself finally to Potter’s hand.
A jet of silver light shot through the darkness and hit him square in the chest. Harry's body buckled under the intense sensations, and he began to wheeze uncontrollably. Tears welled up in his eyes as he tried to catch a breath. The maniacal laughter rang out once again.
“She’s absolutely fine!” Potter was actually chuckling, and Draco could only goggle at his levity, though relief was starting to wash over him. “It was nothing to do with what she ate. More to do with what she drank, or what she didn’t drink.”
"I'm happy to continue if it's helping," the man assured. "You can wait a few moments, take some deep breaths and see if that, ah, helps, or you can go ahead and turn over now and just lay your t-shirt across your lap?"
“Not judging here, but you do know a Healer could tell you the date of conception and you could simply use a Pensieve to check who you were with that night? So, it would be easy enough to find that out,
Rocking back on his haunches, Harry swivelled to see Draco sitting on the foot of his bed, smiling at him. He looked so fit in coral-pink shorts and a tight white t-shirt, and Harry could hardly believe that they were now on kissing terms.
They’re both quiet, but it feels like the silence has meaning. There's a heaviness to it, a tension that’s both underlying and overlying, permeating every layer of the space between them.
They begin watching Midsomer Murders and it isn't long before Draco is shuffling a little closer to lean his shoulder against Potter's. They do this. All the better to exchange commentary on the program and give each other little nudges and digs when appropriate. The glass of wine Potter put out for him has been drunk and Draco’s starting to feel a wee bit blurry around the edges. The show is a repeat that Draco’s seen before but he’s decided not to say so, because it means that he doesn’t need to concentrate too hard on the plot. He puts his head on Potter’s shoulder and closes his eyes briefly. They do that as well now.
The brash tone of his self-deprecating remark caught Draco off guard, and a shocked laugh escaped his mouth, which he covered immediately. He supposed Potter had a point.
He followed Draco down the narrow staircase, through the hallway and out to the back door, feeling more and more miserable with each step. The cacophony of clattering, rattling and whistling hadn't let up, and it was doing nothing to reduce the gloomy weight that had begun to settle in his gut.
He felt someone touch his hand. Hold his hand. It was Malfoy. Malfoy was mouthing the words to a song,
'about bloody time he got his arse into some swimming trunks, and his mouth around a margarita and just chilled the fuck out'.
Harry seeks out Malfoy after they're eliminated, only to be informed by Alicia, “He left. Apparated away with Zabini.”

Draco took care to ensure the jus was rich and glossy, the Gurdyroots were perfectly caramelised, the chips were charmed to stay crunchy and hot, and of course the steak was seared to perfection, pink and juicy in the centre. He took equal care over Chang’s dish, patiently ladling the fragrant herby stock into the rice spoonful by spoonful and flambéing the scallops in firewhiskey and chopped chives.
Jeffrey blushes and stammers, "I just- I can't believe the Magister would do that. Trista was so young. She was my friend. I knew about the curse... it had been used before on Goodbrothers Leopold and Damon, and it worked then. They're no longer... involved. But not
If Harry was honest, It wasn't his finest breakfast. The eggs were cooked more firm, and the bacon and tomatoes a little more crispy than he'd intended; and most disappointingly, it was without a pot of tea.
Blaise opens his mouth, most likely to bemoan the failing state of Slytherin friendship, but Draco is already following the stylist to his chair. The stylist is a peppy guy named Aaron who talks so fast that every word feels clipped short.
Pansy starts to snip, and Draco watches his hair fall onto the floor. When Pansy finishes, Draco’s hair falls slightly below his ears. Draco’s face looks naked, vulnerable.
He hopes Harry will not hate him. Draco knows that Harry will understand, though. Harry has always seen the parts of Draco that he prefers to keep hidden.
Harry’s head darts up. Malfoy sits in a black truck, the window rolled down, giving Harry the most judgmental stare he has received in a long time. And maybe Harry should be more focused on the judgment or the shady Death Eater past, but their brain is a little stuck on Malfoy being in a truck.
at him—he just meanders about the store, touching everything that catches his fancy and avoiding Draco’s eyes.
Silence falls once more, and Draco looks at his reflection in his full-length mirror. His eyes look far too wide for his face, and his hair is stringy and flat. He looks like a crazy person.
!" Spittle flies from his mouth as he speaks the last few words and showers his desk in shiny globules. Draco wants to curl his lip in revulsion, but he daren't.
The familiarity of that voice and that touch weakened Draco. He could have this comfort. He could take Gabe back. It would be so easy. But, he reminded himself, Gabe had hurt him, fucked off with that bleached-blonde clothes-horse, right when Draco had needed him the most.
"Thank you, Kreacher, you've really outdone yourself here." Harry smiled as the elf bowed low in reply. As he took a chair at the table, a plate, teacup and saucer levitated their way toward him. "But, how did you know we needed your help?"
They both look at Goodbrother Jeffrey, who's scowling at the silently shouting man on the floor. Jeffrey lifts his gaze to Potter. "I knew he'd try to give you the slip."
"Oh, for fuck's sake!" Robards finally barks, throwing his hands up. "Get yourselves to Mungo's right this minute! And just be thankful you've both got a spotless record."
“I’m awfully sorry, darling. I got so distracted by the biscuits and his charming chitchat,” Pansy said. “I could go back in now and say it to him if you want?”
"I assure you, sir, that the benefits of treating the entire body are well worth whatever misgivings you may have—"
Mrs Potts sulked behind the plant, nursing her lid despite Harry's assurances that the chip was barely noticeable, but she wouldn't be convinced. Harry grumbled to himself as he plated their breakfast, and Hestia rattled smugly on the hob, her spout held high and copper gleaming.
!” he called out firmly, doing the requisite circular motion with his wand. The tip glowed a pale blue and hissed a little, but as he feared, nothing issued forth from it.
At the addition of her own honorific title, the kettle emitted a pleased puff of steam. "The unfortunate thing is, as Kreacher so... um,
Merlin, it had been a day, he thought, walking the narrow pathway from the street back down to the beach. And it wasn't over yet. He had three more hours until sunset, three more hours to comb the beaches for custom, before he could head home to his small flat in the centre of Denpasar and have a much-needed shower, light a few incense sticks and read another chapter of his book.
At Hogwarts, Draco kept a mokeskin pouch under his robes that he told no one about. There were just the basics inside; a couple of pins and needles, a few tiny spools of thread in varying colours, his favourite silver thimble and about half a dozen different buttons.
exercise of writing up his birth plan on the handy template Fordus had provided, without Potter’s running commentary on things, which he’d noted was generally flippant or dismissive or just downright negative. If he didn’t know better, he’d think Potter didn’t even want to have the baby.
It was after closing time, so of course Wattlepot wasn’t about to let him enter. Draco knew there must be some purpose to Potter’s visit, and it wasn’t likely to be auspicious—especially if he was coming so late in the day—however, despite the temptation to bar him entry, he gesticulated to Wattlepot to let Potter in.
"You couldn’t possibly begin to imagine what a wet dream come true it would be for me to make you… to watch you fall apart beneath my hands. Salazar, Harry." Draco's breathing was heavy. "But it's next to impossible."
Draco did Owl Potter later that day, when he'd collected himself enough to think straight. He'd sat there on the oriental runner in the hall for almost an hour, too shaken to stand, running over the conversation with Gabe, again and again. It had been a blow to see him again. Sure he'd seen him in magazines over the months, but being face to face again had been kind of … shocking. The man looked bloody good—fuck, he always looked good, that’s why he was paid to model clothes—and it never failed to spark desire in Draco, but the feeling of betrayal and hurt won out, and Draco was weak with relief that he'd managed to stand his ground.
pointed out,"—Hestia looked nervously at the old elf—"us getting so, uh, hot under our lids with each other has not been
There came, as if carried on the afternoon breeze, a bizarre whistling noise and the chime of a bell and then a haughty voice, "Masters Draco and Harry! Masters Draco and Harry!"
"So, Master Draco, Master Harry, we're quite sorry." Hestia sniffed, her voice wavering slightly. "We have let you down immensely. And we have Kreacher to thank for, well, knocking our silly lids together and making us realise that what we thought to be irreconcilable outrage with one another was no more than a storm in a teacup."
Granger stopped short as the matron stepped in front of her. "I’m sorry. Visiting hours are between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m." Draco turned his head to hide his amusement.
The Magi-doula’s voice interrupted them. “Right, fellows, back to your seats, or your cushions. I have some slides to go through on hypnobirthing.”
I’d fall back into his arms, and I got emotional for a few moments. That’s when you walked in. And I threw him out after that. I don’t want him.”
“Ah, well, let me fill you in. Upper Itchington holds a Tidy Street contest every year, on Midsummer’s Day. The neighbourhood with the most beautiful frontages wins,” Draco said, brightly. “Foxglove Close has won it for the past three years in a row. Everything counts, window boxes, hanging baskets, garden gnomes, and especially lawn presentation.” He was hoping Potter would get the hint without him having to say it out loud.
“Let's just get on with it," Draco said, adjusting his position on the large green exercise ball he was sitting on. They'd been short on normal chairs this week, and though Draco found sitting on a large ball rather humiliating, he couldn't deny they were extremely comfortable. He just had to keep alert so he didn't roll off the thing.
“What does it mean?” Draco asked. “Eww, and the bandages,” he added, noticing they were soaked with a dark purple ooze. “We ought to call for Madam Kite.”
. And he was all ears. “I see. Men you met at a certain club in the basement of the Hopping Pot, perhaps?”
Draco put the finishing touches to the plates and picked them up, addressing Pineneedle, “I’ll take care of these, don’t worry. Maybe I can work out what game this Epicure wants to play, and what better way to do that than to serve him myself?”
Not to be shown up, Harry stepped into the cellar, lighting his wand. "Prat," he grumbled as he passed.
Emerging from the house into the walled garden of the cottage, Harry blinked in the cold-bright of the afternoon sun, dazzled for a moment. But as his vision became clear, so did the source of the din.
“Precisely,” Draco nodded. “Titpie, you assemble the cucumber and mint salads. You’ve watched me do it enough times; even you can’t get it wrong.”
“Drop the act, Potter,” he snapped, finally having had enough of the mind games. “I know that you’re Epicure; your secret is quite clearly out, though I’ll keep it to myself, of course. If you want to write a bad review then just do it, no need to mess around with my feelings along the way. Taking me on a date won’t be necessary.”
it's been that long?" He whistled. "And before that you had a dry spell for a good eight months. That Benoît chap, wasn't it, with the little moustache?"
“Just take this replenishing potion. One dose now, one tonight before bed, and one in the morning, and you’ll be right as rain.” She handed him the bottle, and said sternly, “You’re free to go. And we’d really prefer not to see you again in here until that little one’s ready to come out.” Harry thanked her and she left.
Potter looked devastated. Understandably so. Draco knew how horrific it was to see someone you loved struck down—he thought back to the vengeance the remaining Death Eaters had exacted on his mother; she was never the same after the repeated Cruciatus curses. And he knew damn well that Potter had seen his share of pain and loss too. Draco walked closer and took his wand out.
Draco should pull away from Potter. He needs to get away before Potter remembers how much he hates Draco.
Narcissa looks at him with tears glistening in her eyes. Draco always thought tears softened another person’s face, but Narcissa looks so hard right now, with her jaw tight and lips pressed together.
“The key,” Draco says once they’ve been seated, “is to get yourself in the moment. Breathe in your emotions. Feed on them.”
“Nice robe,” Potter says. “The red looks good on you. I’m a little surprised it isn’t green, though, you know--you kinda look like a Gryffindor.”
Once the War ended and he got out of his temporary stint at Azkaban, he started researching what eating disorders even were. Draco doesn’t binge. He doesn’t purge. He doesn’t think that he’s fat. (Pansy and Blaise are right. He’s too skinny, with bones so sharp they might as well be cutting through his skin). Draco doesn’t have the issues that any of the people described in these books do.
Draco grabs the sides of Harry's face and pulls him close. Draco kisses him more fiercely than before, and Harry presses against him.
But as Harry lies awake at night, his covers twisted around his ankles and pooling at his feet, they think of Draco, the silky folds of the green dress draped across Draco’s pale skin and his fine blonde hair slipping through Harry’s fingers.
The worst feeling is when Draco tallies up his deeds and finds that the bad things outnumber the good, and it’s not even because of the hunger pangs he knows he will feel. It’s the sheer shame coursing through his veins, the reminder that
right now, and all of it is directed Draco’s way. Draco understands now why Ron and Hermione followed him everywhere, heedless of the danger.
“Okay, well, we’re closing now, so you need to leave if you aren’t going to buy anything,” the girl says.
Apparently, Potter has an aversion to mushrooms, feels a growing urge to smash his best friends over the head (they keep setting him up on blind dates), and can’t manage to win a game of Quidditch against his ex-girlfriend. Draco wants to reciprocate in kind because it’s only polite, but his life is just . . . boring. He doubts Potter wants to hear about Draco falling asleep on his desk or spilling tea all over a reporter’s lap and getting kicked out of his own interview.
But there’s something about the process of showering and dressing that seems like too much for Draco right now.
After trying on a pair of dark jeans and a black long-sleeved shirt, Draco stares at his reflection. He looks . . .
There’s a long beat in which neither of them say a word. Draco feels like he’s going to throw up. Or cry. Or throw himself off the nearest cliff and let the sweet oblivion of death swallow him whole.
Harry wants to say something petty and mean so much that it burns at the corners of his lips, but something stops him. Malfoy’s eyes are a little too wide to be called calm, and she is clutching the steering wheel so tightly that her knuckles strain white under her skin. And it’s not that Harry feels sorry for her because Malfoy doesn’t need anyone’s sympathy, let alone Harry’s—it’s just that . . .
Draco thinks it over carefully. Pansy is, he has to admit, the closest friend he has, despite her abrupt absence. If he were to trust anyone with the permission to ask questions, it would be her. The problem is, he doesn’t know if he would have the right answers.
He could find Blaise or Pansy. Maybe they’ll feel sorry for Draco after all this time. He could crash on their couch.
Blaise leans back in his chair, watching Harry with his characteristically disinterested air. It's a relief, in a way, to be under Blaise's bored gaze. So many people treat Harry like a specimen to be dissected, but Blaise has a way of watching people without actually
Malfoy inhales shakily, smoothing out her slacks. Harry’s beginning to wonder if that’s a nervous tic—there are never any wrinkles.
“For what it’s worth,” says Potter, “I can tell you changed. And even if you didn’t—” Potter breaks off, twisting his robes in his hands. “Even if you didn’t, respecting someone’s gender is just . . . common decency. It isn’t something you have to
Draco nods stiffly, then makes his way to the door. Just before he closes the door behind him, he hears Ginny say, “Something has to be done, Luna.”
“I--” Draco’s going to throw up. He’s going to start heaving bile in front of the whole school. “I’m
but I've realized--" Harry digs one hand into the dirt. Grass has already begun to grow, and the slender blades shiver against his palm. "I hated you," Harry whispers, his voice breaking.
“Draco Malfoy!” Ginny cries, anguish scrawled across her features. “We could have sold that on Wizard eBay!”
Draco is trans, and he can’t help but feel like everything is falling away because of it. He can’t help but wonder how Percy and Luna and Pansy are able to be
Draco stares at the tips of Potter’s shoes. He waits for the inevitable, for Potter to throw him to the pavement and kick him until he is bloody and broken.
Draco instinctively reaches for his wand to repair Potter’s glasses. Except he doesn’t have his wand because Potter didn’t give it back after the trial, and no one will sell him a new one, and—
“You, um,” Potter starts to say, then hesitates. “Do you need me to go to the store for you? Since you’re sick?”
The bar is loud and clustered with way too many people. Draco knows he is being paranoid, but he feels like people are staring at him and judging. This is ridiculous, and he
Malfoy gives Harry a look of pure scorn, and Harry belatedly remembers that this is the men’s dressing room and that, even if Malfoy couldn’t tell the difference due to elitist idiocy, Pansy would surely know.
He stands under the cold spray of his shower, but his skin still feels feverish where Potter’s body touched his.
Pansy makes him promise to keep eating, and Blaise hands Draco a card with his therapist’s address on it.
Harry looks at the ring lying in his palm, the gleam of gold and emerald winking up at him. (Gryffindor and Slytherin tastefully combined, as the jeweler joked.)
He knows Hermione (everyone) is trying to help. But it's like they know a different language than what Harry normally speaks, and Harry doesn't know how to respond.
“Then do it,” Blaise says, his eyes narrowed as he jabs his fork in the direction of Draco’s untouched plate.
"The only good thing Lucius Malfoy taught his son was how to lie with a smile on his face," Blaise says.
to shake Potter’s hand. Potter just convinced a jury of witches and wizards—who would like to chop Draco up into little pieces and boil him in wax—to clear him of almost all charges. Draco got off with a light slap to the wrist and a two-year house arrest.
Pansy bends down, their knees in the dirt, and begins to sweep through the grass next to Draco's grave. It's clear that they have no clue what they're looking for, but they're trying to help, and Harry's throat is too tight to thank them.
“By the way,” Blaise quotes, because apparently he memorized the letter like the worthless friend he is, “I quite liked that dress you wore. I was going to tell you at the time, but I was worried it would come across wrong. Ginny made fun of me when I told her that, though, so I suppose I’ll tell you now. You look good in blue. To be honest, you look good in any color—“
The only problem is, Potter doesn’t seem to have gotten the memo. They keep sending owls, full of inane chatter and random gossip. He keeps inviting Draco to go places, and the Fuck Around and Find Out dinners make
Draco feels like nothing and everything is happening at once. He wants to die. He wishes Dumbledore just put him out of his misery the moment Draco pulled out his wand.
“Nothing,” says Potter. “You just . . . surprise me.” His voice lowers, and he fiddles with the cuff of his sleeve. “In the best of ways, of course.”
“I eat,” Draco protests. He isn’t lying. He had a handful of chocolate frogs yesterday after class, and he kept all of them down. He’s getting better.
“Dear Draco,” Blaise reads out loud, lounging in the corner like he’s sitting for a portrait, “thanks for coming to dinner last night—“
Instead of Percy, he finds Malfoy, examining her reflection in the mirror, carefully smoothing out a knee-length green dress.
Draco doesn’t have an eating disorder. He has a just punishment/reward system, and he is receiving his dues. He has kids counting on him, and he let them all down.
Ron rolls his eyes and take a swig of beer, clearly signaling that he wants this conversation over with. Ron is a good friend, but he can only handle listening to Harry’s gift woes for so long.
And it was working; it really was. Draco was doing better, better than he ever had, but he’s ruining it, and he can’t
wear dresses, it was always trousers. Nice trousers, obviously. But, um . . .” Harry opens and closes his mouth abruptly, then lets out a huffy laugh. “I don’t know where I was going with this.”
Draco carefully unwraps his gift from Molly. As Harry expected, it’s a sweater—silver yarn with a dark green
When Pansy returns from France, she brushes off Blaise and Goyle’s questions with a simple “I was finding myself.” She also takes in Draco’s short hair and Muggle clothes with barely a raised eyebrow and moves on with her day.
Ron drops his glass of water, his head jerking up. Harry's stomach twists as the glass shatters on the floor, blood spilling across--
There were signs. There had to have been signs. Draco couldn't have just decided to do it one day, spur of the moment--that's not how Draco was. He planned and prepared and theorized. He thought of contingencies; he plotted out each choice.
He has checks and balances. He has a way to motivate himself, which may be slightly unconventional, but he’s different from others. He needs the pressure--he needs the
The man’s robes set on fire, and he starts to scream. Ron stumbles back, cursing. Harry quickly casts a spell to douse the flames because he’s obnoxiously good like that. For a brief second, his eyes meet Draco’s.
Draco can’t move. He can’t even look up because he knows who he will see, because the memory of the burning sensation of these rough hands has been branded into his memory.
In a moment of panic, Draco just points at the first person he sees, a man with hair neatly parted in the middle and slicked down.
Potter rubs his face and sighs. He looks too tired to argue with Draco, which is a rarity in itself.
Scorpius and Rose run into the room, giggling hysterically. Rose clutches a tinsel circlet in her small fist.
Harry doesn’t know silk from polyester, despite Percy’s many exasperated attempts to teach him. But it looks like an expensive dress—the fabric is filmy and shifts colors under the light, like the way a forest blurs into different shades of green from far away.
No. Draco is in Diagon Alley. He’s in Diagon Alley, and everyone is either pointedly staring or ignoring his presence completely, and Aunt Bella is dead.
He doesn’t blame Pansy and Blaise. Draco knows that they’re dealing with their own consequences and issues. Pansy and Blaise are barely able to keep their heads above water, let alone help Draco as well.
Harry. Bad enough that Harry obsessed over Draco at Hogwarts—childhood rivalries are one thing, but . . .
“Your taste in music is trash,” Blaise continues, beginning to strut around the room and imitate Potter’s voice. “I’ll attempt to give it a go, though, because I have nothing better to do. Kidding. It’s actually quite nice—it reminds me of when we were at Hogwarts and some of the students would do choir and whatnot. Peaceful, if a bit pretentious.”
Draco doesn’t have an eating disorder. He has it under control--he can choose when and when not to eat any time.
The wizard is still screaming about Death Eaters and murder and blood, and Draco can't stop his hands from shaking.
Potter is a wildfire out of control, consuming everything in his path, and Draco is like a tree. Silent, unmoving, waiting to be consumed.
to be able to keep himself in check. Draco doesn’t deserve to live, let alone consume and enjoy meals. Everything has to be earned--otherwise, it has no meaning at all.
“The only reason he hasn’t disowned me yet is because Azkaban blocks me from his sight,” Draco says.
for what he was feeling all those years. He just thought it was normal--that every girl felt this way. But here was Percy, putting words to the feelings Harry had struggled with for so long.
to be a congratulations gift, but now it’s more of a ‘sorry your father is terrible’ gift. I think I’m going to send them some flowers.”
of feeling empty, of having no choice. He is like a brittle autumn leaf, bound to crumple and blow away at the softest sigh of a breeze.
Draco rolls his eyes and crumples up the letter, tossing it into the fireplace and ignoring Ginny’s indignant squawks.
“We’re actually not archnemeses anymore,” Harry says. “I mean, I think we would both ignore screams of pain and torture from the other if we were having a bad day, but we’re not—” Malfoy sneers at Harry the second time this night, and Harry remembers why they felt like knocking her teeth out their entire time at school together. “Fine. You’re my archnemesis, we would kill each other given the chance, and blah blah blah. Happy now?”
“You should wear heels,” Goyle says helpfully. “I bet Potter likes that you’re so tall. It’s probably a turn on.”
to be something wrong because of this persistent ache that wouldn’t leave him alone. Something was missing.
When Harry and Draco get back, Scorpius and Rose are hard at work over drawings. Harry catches a glimpse of people holding hands on Scorpius’s paper and leans in slightly to get a better look.
He thinks she moved to France. Possibly Spain. At this point, he is too scared to send an owl and ask because he knows she moved to get away from . . . their
“Did they cut off your tongue or something?” Potter asks, his voice somewhere in between irritation and humor.
Draco’s head hurts. He doesn’t understand what Potter is trying to do, and he wishes Potter would just get it over with because Draco is tired of the looming panic that pervades his every thought.
The second time Potter touches him is a moment that Draco would like Obliviated from both of their memories.
Draco starts another charity, this time with Granger, that focuses on finding Muggleborns before their eleventh birthday to start easing them and their parents into the Wizarding World right away. Most likely due to Granger’s influence, Potter attaches his bank account and his money to this charity, too, and the donations start flooding in.
The problem is, the longer this goes on, the less motivated he feels. He can barely force himself to get out of bed in the morning, let alone leave his house. The more he lazes around in bed, the less work he gets done.
It’s not easy for Draco. He wants it to be, but there’s so much to be unsure about. Slytherins are not known for their boldness or courage, and Draco is a Slytherin to his core.
“Would it be incredibly awkward of me to ask for your pronouns?” Harry asks. Awkwardly. As one does. “Or would you rather I just pretend this never happened?”
“Shut up!” Draco yells, before erupting into a fit of coughs. Merlin, he hasn’t spoken in a while. “I’m trying--I can’t
“I met this prat named Malfoy the other day,” Pansy said. “He was a bit of a wanker, but I have to say he had a good taste in clothes. I think I’ll kill him and steal his wardrobe for my personal use. What do you say, friend?”
Draco slams into a wizard and knocks him to the ground. A crunch snaps in Draco’s ears, and Draco’s stomach fills with dread.
Malfoy stares at Harry blankly. Harry remembers that while he is currently on T, wearing a binder, and sporting a fresh haircut, he’s not exactly
“I’m sorry,” Percy says, “you think we should be friends because we both think your fashion sense is deplorable?”
Potter pulls away, his hands falling from Draco’s skin. Draco hates the way he immediately misses their presence.
“Consorting with blood traitors is bad enough,” Lucius had spat out the day Draco tried to tell him, the day Draco truly felt like he had lost
Draco looks up to find Potter standing next to Draco’s table. Draco stares at Potter blankly. The issue that Draco has found is that he can never tell when someone is being serious or just employing heavy sarcasm. Potter
Pansy and Blaise cast him a few concerned glances, and Crabbe and Goyle seem uncomfortable with the whole situation, but Draco is
Draco points his wand at his hair and whispers a cleaning spell. Now he just looks like a clean homeless person. Draco dons a dressing gown and turns into a homeless person who broke into a rich man’s house.
Luna turns limpid eyes upon Draco, and he feels his face soften, It’s practically impossible to glare at Luna, especially if one still remembers her starving away in their basement.
"I don't understand it," Harry says. He is kneeling at Draco's grave, running his finger across Draco's name again and again. "To be honest, I don't really understand you. But I know--"
He’s standing in a Muggle shop, more for warmth than anything. He has been staring at the same bag of crisps for the past five minutes, and the workers are starting to watch him with suspicion.
He could make it up tomorrow and just not eat. But this would count as one of the bad things, wouldn’t it? So then would he have to skip for two days? The numbers are beginning to blur together in his mind, and he can’t quite piece what the logical course is together.
The next day, Draco stands in the men’s department of a Muggle shop, staring at a rack of button-downs with increasing panic.
he screwed up; he couldn’t kill Dumbledore when the man was right under his wand. Father keeps sending him letters that switch back and forth, from vague threats to mournful descriptions of what new travesty has occurred in the Manor to explicit descriptions of threats Voldemort keeps breathing into Father’s ear about all the ways Draco will be punished.)
Draco stands in the corner of a crowded room, his head aching. He doesn’t know why he comes to any of these things. Luna always turns limpid eyes on him and asks him to join her, then flits away about ten minutes in. Draco doesn’t know how to talk to people when he’s left to flounder on his own.
The words get stuck in Draco’s throat, and he can’t quite remember the exact thing he was going to say. Potter’s hands are still on Draco, and it’s been so long since anyone has touched him.
He needs to rent a flat. He needs to get a job. He needs to find a way to repair all the damage his family inflicted during the war.
Except Draco doesn’t really want to leave because that means the cold streets and an empty stomach and sneers from wizards and witches he doesn’t even know. Better to be bloody in a warm flat than out on the street, his blood freezing on the sidewalk.
Laughing wildly, Blaise falls back onto the dusty mattress Goyle uses as a bed, letting the letter flutter to the ground.
Draco slowly, terrified of looking too eager, takes the wand. Potter offers his hand, and Draco feels like he’s about to walk out of the courtroom once more, everyone’s eyes and cameras trained on him.
Draco peels the covers off his skin, then shakily makes his way across the room. He feels lightheaded and can barely keep his wand steady.
He doesn’t have an eating disorder. He has a penance to pay, and he has barely scratched the surface.
Draco writes a book about his time as a Death Eater. Then he writes another about the history of Dark Magic and another about the life of Tom Riddle and another about the plights of Squibs.
Draco shakes his head, his shoulders tense. He has the vague impression that Tessa is annoyed with him, but he doesn’t know what he wants, other than
Draco feels panic shoot up his throat. This can’t be happening. They currently have twenty-three children in their program, and closing everything down would entail turning them loose on the streets. Also, this is probably the one good thing Draco has done in his life, and--
“Tell me about it,” Draco says, pecking Harry’s cheek. “He’s always rushing to and fro. I swear, he practically lives off of protein bars.”
Draco stares straight ahead, his eyes burning. It is taking every speck of self-control for him to keep from crying, but he has no idea how long he will be able to keep it up.
Harry climbs to his feet and stares at the ground where the ring winks up at him in the dim starlight.
Draco is going to have to talk to people. He’s going to have to pretend to be a decent, functional human being who isn’t a racist, worthless waste of magic.
But it’s like he’s trapped in one spot, in one moment. Potter’s touch spreads through Draco’s skin and poisoning his blood.
“Pansy and Blaise know,” Draco says defensively. “I think they told Goyle. And Ginny figured it out.”
“Let me get this straight,” Potter says with a skeptical cock of his eyebrow. “You want me to believe that you’re running a charity for Squibs and that you want me to donate to keep your students off the streets?”
“Thanks for telling me,” Harry says. “I’ll . . . Do you want me to call you Draco? Around other people?”
They all laugh, Draco included, but Draco can’t remember the last time he found anyone’s jokes funny.
Draco doesn’t respond to that because his head hurts too much and what does Potter expect to hear, anyway? They have been at each other’s throats for so long that this display of kindness, of decency, is so beyond Draco’s understanding. He knows he would not even
It’s not that Harry is too sad about this. They should probably have broken up with Ginny right away, after all, instead of putting the responsibility on her.
Draco can do this. He may have to skip a few more meals to get it all done, but it’s not the end of the world. Food is a luxury, and luxuries have to be earned.
because that pretty much defines Draco’s “journey of self-realization,” as Pansy likes to call it. But Potter invites Draco for waffles, for awful karaoke nights at the Weasleys, and sometimes just to
Harry digs his nails into his palms. He can't cry. He has to stay calm because if he cries, Ginny and Luna will be concerned, and then
“How short are we thinking today?” asks the hair stylist, a girl named Tessa with bright pink hair twisted up in a bun.
But something about the thought of the only other trans person he knows calling him by his deadname is just . . . unpalatable.
Draco stares at his reflection, at the harshly drawn lines of his pale face. His eyes are far too big for his face, and Draco hates the projection of innocence they give him.
“Thank you,” Luna says sweetly. “Say, Draco, Ginny might be right. Harry has always had difficulty expressing his true feelings--I fear the wrackspurts tend to plague him much more than most of us.”
At this point, his name to meal ratio has lost meaning. Ever since Potter decided to attach himself to Any Worthy Cause that catches his eyes, Draco and Luna’s charity has faced little difficulties. Eventually, Draco just has to scrap the list entirely because Potter is doing all the work for him.
"I'm sorry," says Harry, "for not noticing that you were drowning. And I'm sorry for blaming you for something that was out of your control."
“I feel like if I talk about it, everything will disappear,” Draco whispers. “Like it’s just a dream, and none of it is
Draco whirls around, his heart pounding, to find Ginny Weasley staring him down with a dark scowl on her face.
Draco doesn’t have the luxury that he did as a fifteen year old. He can’t let anyone see the person he is inside. The only things he has left to protect himself are his layers and layers of masks.
Draco nodded because he was desperate, because answers were not forthcoming, because Pansy always looked so damn
Draco quickly picks his burger up and starts to eat. It’s like ash trickling down his throat and mud sticking to his teeth.
“They probably meant to,” he says. “They just . . . kept putting it off.” Harry’s left hand is on the table, and Draco gingerly rests his hand on top, half expecting Harry to yank his away. Instead, Harry turns their hand palm-up, enteining his fingers with Draco’s. Draco inhales shakily. “Feelings are messy. They’re complicated and difficult, and it’s hard enough as it is to love someone and be loved back, let alone tell another person about that love.” Draco nudges Harry’s shoulder gently. “Especially if they’re an ex.”
Draco tries to think of something to keep the conversation going, except he always feels so helpless around Potter.
Harry is surprised into a laugh in spite of himself. “Get over yourself, Malfoy,” he says, jumping out of the truck.
Harry apparates to Draco’s house. Immediately, the sound of Scorpius’s slippered feet pattering down the stairs greets Harry’s ears. Scorpius skids to a stop in front of Harry, and Harry instinctively opens his arms for a hug.
After that, Harry decides it’s well within his rights to throw a pity party. It’s raining outside, and Harry thinks it presents an appropriately morose picture to the world as he wanders through puddles, their socks like plaster on their skin and their hair flat against their skull.
This is Draco’s life now--sitting in his kitchen in his dressing gown as Potter watches him try to eat a bowl of soup. The key word is
“Thank you,” Pansy says, lying on Draco’s bed and staring at the ceiling, “for not asking questions.”
“You’re sexy,” Pansy says cheerfully. “You should wear red next time you go on a ‘not a date’ with Potter.”
He snacks throughout the day. He slips down to the kitchen every now and then, so long as he has finished his homework.
"It's my fault," says Harry. "I should have noticed something was wrong. I wasn't good enough; I should have
“I don’t,” Harry starts to say, then stops. He’s looking everywhere and nowhere and at nothing at all. “I’m not the person people think I am, and I’m just—bad at it, I guess? At making people feel loved. I don’t know how—“
But Draco deserves the bite of pain; he deserves to know the agony Hermione felt as his aunt carved letters into her skin.
“Is Pansy still ignoring you?” Blaise whispers when Draco enters the salon, a different one from last time.
Malfoy makes a sound of disgust. Harry hears a click, and then Malfoy is pushing the passenger door open.
“Percy already gave me one. Well, technically, Molly’s the one who knit it, but she had Percy gift it because she thought it would be more poetic or something.”
“Are you working an a new one?” Potter asks, gesturing to the many papers spread across Draco’s table.
There are days when Harry doesn't think about Draco. There are days when it's all Harry can focus on, like Draco's memory is a crushing weight obstructing the sun.
He thinks about asking Blaise or Goyle, but he can’t handle the thought of dragging either of them into his mess.
It’s his sixth year. He should be partying with the other Slytherins, plotting out his future, going on dates. Instead, he’s trying to figure out how to kill Dumbledore.
Harry snorts and reaches out to grab the box. He slips the ring onto Draco’s finger, and Draco buries his face in Harry’s neck, his shoulders shaking.
“Prat,” Harry mutters, stepping out of the dressing room to see if the shirt meets Percy’s approval.
In the end, it doesn’t matter what Draco wears. He finds Harry sitting at the booth, a plate of untouched waffles shoved away, as they stare at a newspaper with knit eyebrows.
Draco’s head jerks up to look at Potter. Potter swallows nervously, his hands fidgeting with his robes.
“I chose the wrong yarn, didn’t I?” Molly says fussily. “I knew I should have done a green sweater with a silver
It's not just the scars that wind their way around his body. It's not just the mark burned into his skin.
“I like your hair like this,” Harry whispers. “You always pin it up or tie it back or put it in a braid. I never get to see it loose.”
“Anyway, that explains why I’m eating waffles as I commiserate with my archnemesis. What brings you here?”
“It helps, you know,” says Potter. “I mean, I never talked about it, either, but my friends helped a lot.”
Harry is picking up the shards of glass, his hands slippery with water (blood, blood, blood). Ron grabs Harry's wrists, and the glass slips through Harry's fingers.
“Ginny,” they say gently, “you’re not transphobic; you’re a lesbian. It’d be more transphobic if you
Maybe he sees something in Draco’s eyes because, all of a sudden, Potter is looking at him with ill-disguised pity.
He hates the way he can't control his own emotions and thoughts. He hates the blankness inside of him--he's just
Draco starts to compose two columns each night, one detailing every bad thing he did during the day and the other detailing all the good. So long as the good things outweighs the bad, Draco gives himself permission to eat the next day.
Well. She looks lonely. And she didn’t want to let Harry mope alone in the rain. And she likes waffles now, apparently.
Draco hasn’t eaten in five days. (This is nothing. At Hogwarts, Draco could go weeks without eating.)
Draco closes his eyes and burrows into the blanket, curling up on the couch. Potter brushes back Draco’s hair, checking his forehead once more.
He’s running a charity with Luna for Squibs. Draco knows this barely scratches the surface of the many sins he needs to atone, but it’s a start. With every new donor he finds, he allows himself to add another future meal to his list.
In the long run, this is not a big deal. There are Squibs out who are starving for real, who don’t have an education past age eleven, who are living on the streets in squalor.
“Well, Potter, this was nice,” Draco says, staring morosely at his owl flapping off on her merry way. “I hope you enjoy the excuse never to speak to me ever again.”
“I think it’s a great idea,” Luna says serenely. “Percy, you always complain that no one wants to make fun of Harry with you.”
They don’t really talk for the first half hour. Malfoy studiously works through her first plate of waffles without a word, and Harry follows her example. Then, halfway through her second plate of waffles which have fucking
He does not want to think about what would happen if someone intercepted the owl and figured out where she lived.
Draco is standing, clutching his fork like he’s about to spear it through Blaise’s heart, and everyone is staring at him. Judging. Whispering.
Pansy looks up at him, her dark hair spilling out across his pillow. Draco will most likely find her long brown hair for weeks to come.
An awkward silence falls. Potter looks like he’s struggling to find words to say in response, but the waiter saves him by bringing out their food.
Tessa sighs and starts snipping. When she gets done, Draco’s hair is about the same length as when Pansy cut it, but with more shape and volume.
Potter brushes past Draco without a second glance. Draco’s entire body is on fire now, as if he’s back in the Manor with Voldemort, with Aunt Bella standing over him, hissing foul threats as she casts stinging hex after—
The waiter comes by, and Draco feels himself begin to disconnect as Potter and the waiter chat about the weather, Quidditch, and literally everything except food.
It’s his fault. Draco should know by now that he cannot ever forget to pay attention to his surroundings. He does not have the luxury of thought when he’s in public—all attention has to be devoted to watching everything and everyone.
Draco knows he should be doing more. He knows it will never be enough. He just wishes that his mind would stop reminding him.
Draco stares at his list from the privacy of his home. The problem is, none of these names are because of
Draco opens his mouth to say that he’s sorry, that he never meant to knock Potter over, that he wasn’t watching where he was going, that he’s
hand off so that the Chosen One can’t burden another poor unfortunate soul with his cursed physical contact.
Harry wishes he were drinking, too, but the memory of Vernon’s drunken flush keeps him from any form of alcohol more effectively than any vow of abstinence.
(A Muggleborn is one fourth as likely as a Pureblood to experience depression or suicidal ideation. A Squib is three times as likely to attempt suicide. Remnants of Death Eaters still exist and harass, threaten, beat, and sometimes kill anyone who doesn’t match their idea of a pure wizard.)
“Can we try something?” Pansy asked one day, sitting beside Draco on his bed, holding his hand tightly.
“In all honesty,” Pansy said, lying flat on their back on the couch, “I feel a little trapped. Like, I don’t feel like a guy, but I don’t feel like a girl, and I would honestly love to just
The Manor is tainted. Every room is stained with the screams and blood of the Dark Lord’s victims, of the shaking terror that pervaded Draco whenever he ran to hide, of Aunt Bella leaning over him with her wand tapping against his collarbone. There is no room free of Draco’s panic or sins.
“I--are you--” Potter rubs his face and groans. “I’m so bad at this. I’m sorry. You don’t have to tell me anything.”
Draco briefly considers the ramifications of murdering his best friend. He has a feeling Crabbe would return from the dead and murder him instead if he so much as planned it.
“That’s—wow. Congratulations,” Potter says. He hesitates, probably because Draco looks like he’s about to have a mental breakdown. “You know, right? You know it’s good?”
“You don’t have to be drunk,” Draco says. Salazar, he hates himself for being close to tears. He’s an idiot.
“Right,” Potter says awkwardly. Draco can’t move, trapped as he is under Potter’s scrutiny. “Well, I’ll see you.”
“Just give him a nice massage,” advises Ron at the bar. “That’s what I do for Hermione, and it works like a charm every year.”
“We have to create something new for you, darling,” Pansy explains as she ties a sheet around Draco’s neck. “Everyone knows what you look like, and I do mean
Scorpius wraps his arms around Harry’s waist for less than one second before skipping off, humming a cheerful tune.
Potter starts to send Draco owls several days a week. At first, they’re strictly informational, such as donations and strategies for raising money, but they eventually begin to devolve into something more personal.
So many things are hard for Draco. He has trouble falling asleep. He can barely drag himself out of bed on the rare occasions when he
It’s morning. Maybe afternoon. Draco can’t bring himself to care. Through the haze of a blanket, all light looks the same.
Malfoy steps down from the truck, smoothing out invisible wrinkles in her suit jacket. She locks the truck, then sneers at Harry, her even white teeth flashing in the night. Harry thinks,
just a ring, and Harry just lost the one thing that was still holding Draco to earth, and now Draco is lost forever.)
One more night. Draco is selfish enough to want to stay with Harry despite not being able to feel, despite not being able to give Harry what he deserves, but one more night is all that Draco will allow himself.
Potter pauses, as if sorting through every word. He says slowly, “It’s good to have someone who understands to talk about this stuff. I had Percy and Luna. It’s only fair you have someone, too.”
Draco does not care so much about what they think. After all, they are partly right (not about the dark magic--Draco barely
Potter hesitates, then draws a wand from his robes. Panic shoots up Draco’s throat, even though he knows Potter isn’t going to do anything, not now, not during Luna’s party, not when—
mind are the careless stinging hexes thrown his way, the witches and wizards who look at him in a way that promises blood and broken bones, and the death threats delivered to any of his friends who so much as speak with him.
As the last golden strands of sunlight began to fade and were replaced by various coloured lights from the nearby eateries and other shops, Draco decided to call it a night and head home. He stood, bidding the bartender farewell, Ismaya his name was, as Draco had learned over the past few futile days. He had to raise his voice a little over the steady bass pulse and the repeated question of
“Unlikely,” Draco said, glancing at Fordus's expectant face. The man was strolling around the room, clearly planning to eavesdrop on all the conversations. He remembered his vow to himself, the one he repeated in his head every morning while doing his shaving charms—to do everything he could to ensure this baby had the best start in life. He couldn’t quite imagine how talking to Potter about sexual desire was going to help, though. Maybe he could speak to Fordus about it. Maybe he’d allow—
He realises with a wry chuckle that he’s put his lucky pants on. The classy black ones that Ginny bought him, back when they were a thing. Not a Snitch or a dragon or a Quidditch logo in sight. The ones he wears when he thinks he might pull. So, subconsciously, he
Over breakfast, Potter watched with raised eyebrows as Draco scratched and rubbed at his arm. He held out his hand to Draco.
Draco offered a hand to Harry and pulled him up into a shaky embrace. "I'm really sorry, Harry," he began. "Come on, let's go back upstairs. It's safe to say neither Mrs Potts nor Hestia are down here."
“Clearly!” Draco replied, curling a protective arm around his stomach. “But I thought we were trying to be
“No, not really. Is there much more of it? Only I’m not supposed to be doing any heavy lifting in my condition.”
Potter nodded; he didn't really seem to care. “I remember it very well. But it’s been years, and I’d like to think that we’ve both changed a lot since then.” Draco had to bite his lip to stop himself from saying Potter had definitely got better looking. “And I thought we buried the hatchet that time when I clocked you one after the trials.”
when you have a baby. Like how to survive on three hours’ sleep a night. I snapped and told them I’d learned all I bloody well needed of
why Potter was not prioritising mowing his lawn and making his garden look more presentable. All Draco needed to do was explain more about the contest. Potter would understand and get to work prettying up his garden.
The villagers took pride in their neighbourhoods being neat and pretty and orderly—whether they contained large Tudor-style houses or quaint thatched cottages or rows of red-brick terraced houses—and none more so than local resident and renowned Prophet columnist Draco Malfoy.
." A small flame of humiliation burned his pride to have to send this to her, but he was overwhelmingly sure that Harry was worth it. It was funny the things he'd do for… what? Draco wasn't sure.
The day Teddy and Mr Gnome came to live with them permanently was the day Harry confessed to Draco that he'd always wanted kids. They'd only been together for a little less than a year, but it felt right, and they began having whispered discussions right away about
“That doesn’t mean you should sell it,” Narcissa says. She’s so upset that she doesn’t ask Draco if he wants more tea.
the thought of chopping off his hair. His hair made him feel safe during the war, a veil to hide behind while the Dark Lord prowled around his house, looking for fresh prey.
For some people, it’s a slow process of self-discovery. For others, it’s a part of their identity that they knew all along. For Harry Potter, it was the moment Percy stood up in front of everyone with a new haircut and said, flashcards in hand, that his name was Percival and his pronouns were he/him.
Scorpius, at least, is very quick to exclaim his mile-long Christmas list, ninety percent of which is candy. That’s all he really wants in life—chocolate and Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans.
He should have noticed that Draco was struggling. Harry failed Draco, the same way he failed Sirius and Cedric and Dobby and so, so many others.
Normal. Like any other young man on the street without a hint of tragedy, infamy, or scandal clinging to him.
Harry thinks about asking why Malfoy is in the men’s dressing room, but he’s pretty sure asking that would somehow end in disaster. He instead settles on saying, “Nice braid.”
Harry glares at the selection of ties in front of him. They are all very nice ties and undoubtedly expensive ones at that, but Harry has the sinking feeling that Draco already owns all of them. That’s the problem with dating one of the richest wizards in England who, unlike Harry, has no reservations about spending said riches. He has already purchased everything.
But Draco was never safe, not then with the Dark Lord bored and seeking amusement and certainly not now with the Dark Mark permanently burned into his skin.
“No, I mean—“ Draco shakes his head, and the clinging thoughts like cobwebs in his mind scatter around him. “I’m not
Draco buries his face in his knees. He’s hallucinating now. He has to be, because there is no way Potter could be standing over him, concern in his voice.
"Why didn't I see?" Harry whispers, hating the weak, broken thread of his voice. "I should have been able to help him."
“No,” Draco says stiffly, still unsure over whether Potter is cracking a joke that only he understands. “It’s a program for Muggleborn children in families with a disliking for magic to find a new home, should it become necessary.”
Draco feels a flush that spreads from his cheeks to the rest of his face, ears, and neck. He wants to duck his head in a bucket of ice water. He wants to duck
fault. Not yours. Not Draco's. Sometimes--sometimes a person just feels trapped, and the only way they can think of to escape is--is--"
Harry takes the ring out of his pocket, then sets it on top of Draco's grave. He rests his forehead against the cold marble gravestone and closes his eyes.
Draco can remember the first and only time he tried alcohol. It was a bottle of wine that he and Blaise snuck out of Lucius’s extensive reserves. At the time, Draco liked the floaty, giggly feeling that it gave him.
“Oh, I didn’t read it,” Luna says airily. “I smelled it. Like clementine and cloves, which is the smell of love.”
Draco would get burned at the stake if he killed Potter, but he finds this more appealing than the thought of having to
He could go to a Muggle doctor, but he’s pretty sure that costs money. He doesn’t have money (Muggle or wizard).
Draco sinks to the ground, his back against the wall, his hands gripping his hair tightly. He can’t stand up. He’s so shaky, and his head hurts, and he doesn’t know where to go—
The night ends with Percy joining Draco in making fun of Potter’s new shirt, so Draco is inclined to believe Luna and Potter over Percy. After everyone stands to leave, Draco finds Potter sending the oddest look of open warmth his way, which is frankly . . . unnerving. Draco would rather be hexed and bleeding out on the bathroom floor any day.
The first time Draco skips a meal to finish an essay, no one notices. So he does it again (and again and again and again).
Somehow, this exchange turns into Draco agreeing to meet Potter for dinner. Except . . . today is Thursday. Yesterday was Wednesday. On Wednesday, Draco’s column of bad things far exceeded that of his good things, so he
Lucius is rolling over in his grave right now. Not that Draco cares. And not like it matters, because Potter isn’t doing anything, and it’s completely normal for Potter’s hand to fit against Draco’s waist and for Draco to slip his fingers through Potter’s hair and—
Poems of death and blood and loathing, of fear and failure, of the lines Draco was planning to trace in his skin.
But Harry is stuck, in one moment, in one frame, kneeling at Draco's side and placing his ear to Draco's chest, waiting for the heartbeat and the breath that never come.
“Why the long face, Potter?” she asks breezily. “It’s not every day the savior of the Wizarding World gets to have pity party waffles with their arch nemesis. You ought to call yourself blessed.”
“Harry’s here to see me,” says Draco. “Hermione will bring Rose by later.” He nudges Scorpius gently. “Give Harry a hug?”
“The worst thing is that he always knows what to get me,” grumbles Harry. “Then I feel like a complete prat as he pastes on his polite society smile and tells me how much he loves mine.”
have cleared him--rather, they look at Draco with even more suspicion, as if he somehow managed to use his
Why is it, after all these years, that Potter is the only one to touch Draco first? Salazar, of all people—
(The chocolate tasted like air on Draco’s tongue, and swallowing it was like consuming a sticky, tasteless sludge.)
He’s been doing well, as evidenced by the fact that he’s managed to eat more often (four to five days a week isn’t bad). He’s managing it. He’s doing fine.
But there is a shuttered look in Harry’s eyes, and Draco recognizes it as the same look he saw a few years ago whenever he looked in the mirror.
Draco can’t think of anything to say. Potter’s hand is on Draco’s shoulder, and now his other hand is on Draco’s forehead.
The night starts out fairly well. Harry and Draco go to a movie, and Draco can feel his shoulders slowly relax. It's odd, the way Draco feels more comfortable around Muggles than wizards now.
Hermione wants Harry to visit Draco's grave. She claims that this will help him find closure, that Harry needs to have something ground him.
Harry catches himself laughing during the film, which feels like such a betrayal. It has only been a few weeks. He shouldn't be this happy; he shouldn't be
Harry should probably stay closeted around the likes of Malfoy—if anyone were likely to be transphobic, she would be the one. But Harry feels the urge to be reckless tonight. At any rate, it’s not like anyone will be upset with him if they end up murdering Malfoy in a fit of blind rage. Except Pansy and Blaise, but Harry is pretty sure he could take them.
Ginny is quiet as Draco counts out the money. Draco has never been more grateful that he managed to memorize how the Muggles’ blasted money system works. Looking like a fool in front of a Muggle was one thing--looking like a fool in front of a
His house arrest is over, but sometimes Draco still feels like he’s trapped. He’s out of money (out of time, out of help, out of friends), and he has nowhere to go.
Molly pauses, pulling away to look at Harry. Her eyes brim with tears, and Harry feels an unexpected flare of irritation. How
“I’m going to go to their Fuck Around and Find Out dinner,” Draco says with great dignity. “And I am going to behave with utmost decorum and become best friends with Percy Weasley, and you’ll be left to scramble for a new best friend.”
Draco wants to gag. He knows that he shouldn’t be doing this. He knows that he’s ruining his balance after months of finally managing to cultivate it, but Pansy and Blaise are staring him down.
Near the end of Draco’s shift at the potions shop, Potter comes in to supposedly shop. Draco resists the urge to hide. Or kill him.
"Listen to me very carefully, Potter," Blaise says. "Draco Malfoy was like a house with the shutters closed. No one, and I mean
Potter sighs and finally looks at Draco. He cannot help feeling like a bug under a scientist’s watchful gaze.
“Harry.” Harry frowns for a moment, his brow furrowed. “He/they pronouns, I think. For now, anyway. I’m still trying to figure stuff out.”
One more night, and Harry will finally be able to move on with his life without Draco floating behind him (always, permanently behind).
When it comes time for presents, Harry finds that Draco, per usual, found the perfect gift: a bright red, heated blanket with Snitches zooming across the fabric.
“You like working here?” Potter asks, after fingering the same vial of sleep potion for the fifth time.
Draco opens his mouth, but no words come out. He has to try several before his mouth is capable of making actual sounds.
A low note of anxiety begins to hum through Draco’s body. What seemed so reasonable back at the Manor makes no sense now. Potter wouldn’t believe Draco if he says he’s not hungry
Draco does not have an eating disorder. He just has a healthy understanding of his own accomplishments.
Draco backs away, his heart thudding. The columns flash before his eyes, and it feels like his tie is about to strangle him where he stands.
A loud crash echoes through the house. Draco freezes under the covers before his fingers close around his wand.
Draco scrambles to his feet, and Potter looks at him from his seat in the kitchen. Draco smells the bacon before he sees it, and his stomach twists painfully.
Draco should feel surprised, he supposes, but the persistent thread of anxiety isn’t allowing him to react beyond basic social courtesies. Was he supposed to know? It was probably in the papers. Considering this is Harry Potter they’re talking about, it was
Draco is just opening his mouth to retort with some of the nastiest adjectives he knows when a tall, well-dressed wizard grabs him by his lapels and slams him against the wall.
Ginny is uncharacteristically quiet, but Harry doesn’t think much of it. After all, it’s a lot to take in—who wouldn’t feel a little shocked?
Draco hadn’t thought much of it, not even when Pansy started going by they/them pronouns exclusively. Because, well, that was
and he can’t let himself fall back down that hole of not having an effective system just because of forgetfulness. But it’s like there’s an external force, screaming in Draco’s ear, forcing him not to eat.
Harry stares blankly. Is this how they’re going to die? Is death looming in front of them in the form of Malfoy in a truck?
Draco’s hand stops short of touching the doorknob. His mind is screaming at him, and nothing makes sense; he doesn’t understand--
“I completely understand, sir,” she says. “I dated a white man last year, and it was the worst dating experience of my life.”
Harry straddles Draco on the couch. Harry is kissing him, and Draco is technically kissing back, but he can't bring himself to
The Death Eaters have taken over the school, and Voldemort is in his house, and Dumbledore is dead, and Voldemort is in Draco’s house, and he can’t fall asleep at night because he can hear the other students’ screams,
This is ridiculous. It has only been a few days. (Except Draco had gotten used to having more good things than bad things, had gotten used to being able to eat almost every day.)
So out Draco stumbles to find Harry Potter standing in the family room, clutching what looks like a cauldron.
Draco can feel tears forming, and he hates himself for that. Crying in front of a person he barely knows is bad enough, but crying in front of
It begins with Harry having to buy a shirt. They’re pretty sure that all disasters have roots in clothing and fashion and have occasionally toyed with the idea of shucking off his clothes and moving to a cottage in the woods where clothing could be a thing of the past. Unfortunately, Harry finds himself rather fond of his friends, which makes a life of solitude somewhat less appealing.
Harry offers a weak little wave. “Hi, Pansy,” they say. He looks at Malfoy, tilting his head ever so slightly. “Do you go by Draco now?”
Harry doesn't understand. He likes to say that Draco is getting better, that Draco shouldn't punish himself for the person he used to be. But people don't really change--Draco is the same person he was five, ten, or fifteen years ago.
He has a Potions essay due on Tuesday, a History essay and a DADA analysis due on Wednesday, and a Divination report due on Thursday. It’s Monday.
“Easy for you to say. You’re the Chosen One, the Boy Who Lived. I’m the guy who joined the Dark Lord and tried to kill Dumbledore.”
“Yes,” Draco whispers, staring at his reflection. He touches his hair carefully, as if his fingers will burn the rest away. “Yes, it is.”
Draco’s head hurts, and he scrubs furiously at his face. He needs to stop crying. If this is the way he’s going to react to talking to Potter, Golden Boy Extraordinaire, about it, he’s probably going to start sobbing if he talks to anyone else.
Draco tackles Harry onto the floor, kissing him breathlessly, and the box slips through Harry’s fingers. Harry laughs and wraps his arms around Draco.
Harry stops, expecting Luna to cut him off and say the same things that everyone else has been telling him. Instead, she waits, her eyes fixed on Harry's face.
Draco is running on panic and confusion and hatred. Any food he tries to eat just comes right back up, no matter how hard he tries to keep it down. Draco lives on juice and water and the occasional cracker or slice of cheese (sometimes a piece of chocolate if he has earned it, which is rare).
He remembers Luna Lovegood switching from the boys’ dorms to the girls’ halfway through their third year. He didn’t know Luna, but it caused enough of a stir for everyone to talk about it. He remembers thinking,
So then, Draco Malfoy is trans. This changes nothing. He is still a former Death Eater. He is still a blood traitor in the eyes of his father, still something vile and disgusting that his father will never understand.
Draco stares at his hands. There are so many reasons he could give her, but he doesn’t know how to begin to explain them all.
Fuck Draco Malfoy. Harry never should have eaten waffles with him. He shouldn’t have even gotten in the truck, and they definitely shouldn’t have let their gaze linger on the way Draco’s hair framed his face and spilled over his shoulders.
Good to know his father would be willing to forgive Draco for not being an anti-Muggle terrorist anymore if he hadn’t come out as trans.
The thing that people don't understand is that it's not always a bad day. Some days are so much better than anything Draco could deserve, and he never quite knows how to explain it to Harry.
The entire time, Draco does his best to hide the panic trapped in his chest, the guilt rising in his throat.
It’s not real. It’s some kind of cruel trick of Draco’s delusional mind because now Potter is guiding Draco to his feet. Gently. Draco can’t remember the last time anyone was gentle with him.
Harry is fond of saying that these people are fools, but Draco can't help thinking that Harry is the fool for choosing to stay with him. While their methods may be cruel and at times illegal, they're right about one thing: Harry Potter deserves better.
“You never used to wear dresses,” Harry says. “Back at Hogwarts, I mean—although wizard robes are kind of like dresses. But I mean, even when you
“You,” Harry says, gently kissing Draco’s lips, “are beautiful.” He punctuates the space between each word with another kiss. “Lovely.” Their hands slip through Draco’s hair, resting at the nape of his neck. “Handsome. Ridiculous.
The stores run out of copies, and random people on the street feel the urge to come up and embrace him and tell him about all their shady pasts.
“Probably wise,” Potter says once it’s clear Draco isn’t going to answer. “Better for your liver, anyway.”
“It’s not charity,” Draco says. “It’s—“ He shuts his eyes briefly. “You helped me. This is my thanks.”
But every time another witch or wizard looks at him, he feels like he’s eleven years old again, sneering at Ron Weasley for being poor. He’s sixteen, terrified and trying to kill Dumbledore. He’s eighteen, trapped in his shell of a home, haunted by echoes of Voldemort’s presence wherever he goes. He’s twenty-two, shivering on the street, getting turned away from job after job after job.
