“Mostly very typical English stuff. Roast beef and Yorkshire puddings every other Sunday.”
“Yeah. You guys don’t feel like strangers though, not really.” Harry followed Karamo to his bedroom door. “Here it is,” said Harry, opening the door.
It was nothing like the kiss at the club. That had been rough, desire and lust and hormones and nothing else. This was completely different. There was nothing sexual about it. Draco’s left hand in his hair and his right in his own, every touch was soft. His lips, his fingers. Nothing harsh about them.
Upon closer inspection however, Jonathan discovered it wasn’t tidy so much as empty. “Draco, honey, where’s all your stuff?”
Well shit. What was Harry going to do now. His usual intense sarcasm was clearly not going to cut it here. He could feel Lucius’s eyes boring into him. Mouth exceedingly dry, he managed to croak out a few words. “The feeling is very mutual.” Remembering to breathe, Harry exhaled, gripping Draco’s hand a little bit tighter.
Jonathan shared a look with Bobby, before interrupting them, desperately trying to deescalate the situation. “If you’re going to be cooking more maybe a table is a good idea, Bobby?”
Well this is working out great, thought Draco, desperately trying to save the situation. “He’s a friend from work.” he said, turning his attention back to Harry. “See you later, yeah?”
Leave kudos if you want a chapter 3, support keeps me writing.
Draco spent what felt like hours pouring over the contents of the letter. “Well, Professor, seems there’s a lot less daytime television in your future.”
After circling round the car park for five minutes, Bobby finally parked the car. “So Harry, welcome to Dunelm Mill.” They walked into the door, Bobby motioning for the automatic doors to open as if by magic. “I could totally have been a wizard.”
“We can get you some stuff. This is going to be your home, even if it’s only until you find your own home later.”
Bobby sat down next to Harry, who sat on the kitchen counter in his usual spot.  “Okay, my turn. I’ll be gentle I promise, I know it’s been a long day. Can I talk to you about the flat a moment. When did you move in here?”
Picking out the actual furniture was even more exhausting. There were no other words for how Harry felt in that exact moment. As soon as he stepped into the store, he couldn’t do anything to stop the life slowly being drained out of him with every Swedish bookcase they walked past. Draco and Bobby inspected each piece meticulously, looking at the leg shape of tables and the fabric texture of sofas, while Harry simply sat on each one, tables and sofas alike, and pretended to have an opinion. Even if he had any thoughts whatsoever on whether stools were better than proper chairs, he wouldn’t have been able to get a word in edgeways between Draco and Bobby, both clearly having the time of their lives. Jonathan parked himself on the longest sectional he could find, far too big for the flat, and watched from a distance as Draco shunned half the sofas for being “too boring” and another quarter for being “too flamboyant”.
“To hair!” Draco repeated, knocking back both shots in about 6 seconds.
Harry was taken aback by the remark, wishing he could argue. All his life, he’d eaten at a table with others. At the Dursley’s it was the only time he could usually count on being let out of the cupboard. At Hogwarts meals were a welcome break from constant studying, quidditch trials and occasional murder attempts. Even on the run, with their lives in danger and bounties on their heads, Ron and Hermione had made a point of sitting in the tent and eating together when they could. And now, a free man, no abusive family or evil army in sight, and Harry had taken to hiding away, eating vindaloo alone in his room.
“You’re half Sri Lankan, not Indian Harry,” clarified Tan.
Harry’s perception of cooking has been warped by his childhood experiences, but there’s so much more to food than what he knows. I want him to learn to cook for himself, not for anyone else. It’s his heritage, and he deserves to know it.
“Yes. And no. You can decide I don’t really mind.” Draco was hyper, as he always was this time of year. He leaned into Harry’s neck. “You’re not scared, are you Potter?”
“Relax.  And maybe not from Primark.” Draco lowered his voice to a whisper, as if Harry was being let in on some big secret. “Mum likes jewellery and dad likes books, old ones.”
(See the end of the chapter for
I nominated Harry because Merlin knows he needs the help. He’s a mess.
“I don’t have that much stuff, you know. I don’t have anywhere to store it apart from my school trunk, and it never really mattered to me either way. I’ve never really had my own space, the closest thing I’ve ever had to a home was hogwarts.”
meant ugly. Imagine a floral fabric designer threw up all over the room. Pinks, purples and pastel yellows covered every surface of the room, adorned with roses, azaleas, carnations and daffodils. The furniture was all at least 30 years old, and the kitchen had a “I was almost cool in the 80s” feel to it. At least it was tidy.
“Because of this,” said Draco, looking directly at Harry.
Harry took one, drinking his fourth cup of tea that day. “How did she know I was here?”
“Draco? Shut the fuck up. Don’t tell Ron, but you’re my new best friend,” said Harry, already going to give Jonathan a hug.
“So you’ve been here for, probably about 2 years?” Draco
“You really think God cares? I can’t believe that. They made us. Why would They make us wrong? If God didn’t want us to be together, why would They make us want it?”
You can sense the weight of expectation Harry feels just by looking at him, but I want to show him that his best, is enough. Nobody expects anything of him that he isn’t 100% capable of.
, so why don’t you mind your own business.”
All the guys gave Harry a hug, the poor boy barely able to contain his excitement. Without engaging his brain, Harry went in for a hug with Draco. It felt weird for both of them, neither man able to believe they’d got this far. They both made it, and somehow they ended up here. Harry pulled apart first, and Draco let him, clearly uncomfortable. Draco disappeared into his room, leaving Harry alone with his five idols.
Whenever people meet Harry, they always say he’s brave. They thank him for his courage. He fought of the most notorious dark wizard of his time, but make no mistake, Harry Potter had never been more afraid than he was right there, with a ring in his pocket on a bench in the middle of London.
Hope everyone enjoys this. As usual it’s a work of fiction and all that. Although JVN might be a wizard irl. Don’t quote me on that though.
He picked a white gold ring, with two princess cut diamonds and quickly used his credit card to pay, knowing that Draco has never read the “muggle bills” in his life. He picked the packaging in a daze: green satin lining, black box, silver ribbon, no bag. Hiding the box in his inside pocket, he walked towards Hyde park for their Christmas picnic, the newest of the Malfoy Christmas traditions. Draco was already on the bench when Harry got there.
Jonothan played around with it a little more. “And are we feeling the long hair? Do we still want it? Or are we past that now?”
“That’s cool. My friend tried to teach me once, but it was difficult for me. I’m half Indian, I should know how to make my own food.” Harry’s voice broke, and it took him a minute to compose himself. “My dad would’ve been able to teach me, but he obviously wasn’t around. And my aunt and uncle didn’t want me to have any connection to my parents. Not magic, their culture, nothing.”
Did I name the flat after the fab five, absolutely.
“And you say I’m passive aggressive. See you tomorrow.”
“Absolutely terrified.” Harry carefully removed the wax seal, and opened it without reading any of the contents. He handed the parchment over to Draco, “You do it.”
It was late when Draco came home, but even in his exhausted state he could tell that someone other than him and Harry was in the flat. The coffee mugs were mixed with the tea mugs, and the cushions on the sofa weren’t as Harry usually had them. Not that he was checking. Draco put his half of dinner in the microwave and was proved right moments later when a young woman almost walked into him. She was shorter than Harry’s girls usually were, but otherwise she was totally his type. Blond hair, light blue eyes, the whole lot. Harry called out a goodbye from his room, evidently too tired to say goodbye properly, and the girl let herself out. Tired from what, Draco didn’t want to know, though he had a good guess.
Tan turned to Draco, “you didn’t tell him! Harry, darling, you’re on queer eye.”
“Yeah, me too,” said Harry, hanging up their coats and lighting the fire. “Is it us, or is clubbing more effort than it used to be?”
“Scared, Potter?”
Arriving at the flat, there was a much faster than usual changeover, with Harry, Draco and Jonathan easily levitating all the furniture up the two flights of stairs, giving Bobby the rest he so thoroughly deserved. Once the van was emptied, Harry was ushered back in by Karamo who took the driver’s spot. “So Harry, what I want to know is, how did you decide you wanted to be a teacher? Cause from what Jonathan told us you could’ve walked into almost any job you wanted.”
“Okay, but is there any food you really like eating, because I can see you spend a lot of money on takeout.” Antoni opened the bin lid to reveal a mountain of takeout boxes.
The next chapters will be longer than this lmao, I just really like the car bits before the show starts. Thanks for reading!!
The ride back to the flat was one of the most relaxed experiences of Harry’s life. In the van with the radio on and the summer breeze coming through the open windows, it didn’t even bother him that the idiots of the city were screaming and nearly getting run over every five seconds. As they bopped along to Despacito and wished Jonathan was there to translate, he realised that he didn’t feel the pressure that he’d become so used to. He didn’t have to pretend to be or feel anything, he knew honesty would be enough. Harry didn’t even feel the need to fake a smile, in fact, he didn’t think he could stop grinning if he tried.
Oh boy. This hair. Every strand is a different length. Every strand. Harry is making me put in the work.
”You know what? I wanted to see you happy. Clearly that was a mistake!”
There will be a prize for whoever correctly matches the fab five member to their Starbucks order  in the comments.
“So you like the way Draco dresses?”
And the clothes. I’m embarrassed to be seen with him.
“That's a bit of an exaggeration, I barely have any qualifications,” said Harry. “In my fifth year I ran this, well I guess you’d call it a club. I basically helped tutor some of my classmates, we had the most useless teacher that year, and something just clicked for me. That’s when I knew what I wanted to do. And teachers are so important, so it’s nice knowing that what you do matters and helps the kids.”
A reminder that whenever you see what looks like a script (Karamo: in bold etc) it’s the little insert to camera bits that they add into the show. If you watch queer eye hopefully you know what I mean.
Upon arrival at their destination, Harry and Karamo were welcomed by Tan. “How are you doing my love?”
I’m gay, and I wouldn’t live in a house this feminine. It’s got to go.
Every Sunday for nearly 11 years, Harry James Potter was taken to church. Before he could even talk, he was perched on the edge of an oak pew. Sunday quickly became his favourite day of the week. He got to dress up in clothes that were purposely bought for him, not too wide hand me downs that were years old, and the congregation were actually nice to him. Church was a paradise compared to Privet Drive.
Seriously, put anyone in this flat and they’d think it’s a show home. We’re talking 90s, 60 year old woman’s show home.
Bobby pulled a pocket of tissues out of his jeans pocket and handed them to Harry. “Let’s get started. Which frame do you like best?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Alex spoke up, “Wait. You know this guy?”
In all honesty, Draco didn’t care about the girl. He couldn’t even remember her name. It was just the principle of the thing. “My point still stands!” He shouted back, but to no reply. Draco grabbed his jacket and headed out the door.
“I hope not.” Harry sank into the familiar sofa crease of what was now their shared rather small couch.
Malfoy did not comment on the subject change and flipped open his textbook to page 458. "Do you know anything about sleeping potions in general?"
“Harry’s has an aura about him.”
“Oh?” He was starting to sound like a parrot apparently.
He did not have time to speak as Malfoy stood up, muttering a small goodbye to his friends, and walked out of the Great Hall, Harry hot on his heels. Outside the doors of the hall, Malfoy turned and demanded him to explain himself.
The sand in the hourglass was falling quickly as Harry counted down the days until he could leave the Hospital Wing. He spent his mornings asleep, under a sleeping potion, his afternoons were spent with visitors, mainly Blaise, Luna, and Hermione, and his nights were spent admiring the medieval glass paintings. On this particular night, sleep evaded him just like old times. However, he felt more of a restless night rather than what he was used to. Normally his insomnia would force him out of bed, drape himself with the Invisibility Cloak and march downstairs to the Room of Requirement and cook himself a monster of a pasta dish.
"Yeah?"
"Really? How come?" he asked, intrigued.
There it was again, the softening of her eyes and her tone purely warm. It reminded him of a mother’s love and a wave of sadness washed over him.
"May I ask you a question?" he asked.
Madam Pomfrey cleared her throat, digging him out of his thoughts. "To enhance security at the Hospital Wing and quite frankly reduce the number of visitors at any one given point, with the help of Dumbledore's portrait and Headmistress McGonagall, we have devised a system whereby a patient – such as yourself, Harry – are allowed up to six visitors. Anybody to whom you have not given permission, shall not be allowed to come through. Are we clear?"
"Some of us didn't spend our childhoods in a large garden under the sun, surrounded by peacocks and swans chattering about nonsense in
"Okay?"
Or breakfast.
He walked before the brick wall three times and a large, brass door slowly appeared replacing the cold, stone walls. He supposed after the Fiendfyre incident that the Room was gone, vanished and vanquished by the roaring blaze but he had wanted a free space, somewhere alone and quiet and he tried walking before the wall, three times like he always did and expecting nothing to appear, a door magically appeared.
His heart was beating erratically against his chest as his legs run down the stairs. Would Professor Binns be alright? Did he make a mistake of telling him he was dead? Nobody had ever told him since his death in the Sixties that he was not alive and yet everyone continued like it was business as usual. And what was happening to him right now? Why did he need to find a Pureblood—
"Harry considers you his friend and as a Pureblood wizard that may not mean much because even friendship has a price. But you know Harry, everything in his life is simple--"
“Okay, I don’t actually mind the long hair, but I think we’ve got to take care of it a bit more.” Jonathan twisted Harry’s hair back up into a bun. “And what about this beard??”
“He has terrible taste.” Harry shot back. “It’ll be a miracle if we pick out a single thing we both like!” The words were harsh, but both Harry and Draco were smiling.
to keep him alive, to make him feel fulfilled. The other thing was…
"…into a deathlike slumber." Harry startled into the present, finding the classroom dragging their seats behind them as they stood up and went about fetching ingredients, cauldrons, and other necessities.
“You can go on another pretense as to why you’re visiting the portrait, Potter. You don’t have to be literal.”
"Yes, but that's not a legend."
"So my magic kept me alive?" asked Harry, wrapping his mind around this novel idea.
Harry frowned. "Stars?"
Ms Granger, yet none of them saw you take some for yourself. Professor Slughorn has assured Headmistress McGonagall that the Potions classroom, as well as the Potions cupboards and storage areas shall remain sealed as there was a breach of security, allegedly."
. Also, Slughorn gave everyone a fair shot and chance in his Potions class compared to Snape who tended to favor Slytherins.
"You weren't in Potions, Transfiguration nor at dinner."
"Malfoy told me that a counterpotion had been invented."
"There is always a disconnect between being acquitted in one's crimes and society acquitting one from the same."
Fat Friar floated nearby. "Are you hiding, son?"
"Malfoy is also using this as a distraction. But he says, like, that he has nothing else left apart from solving this mysterious legend."
Fat Friar popped out of the ground and floated. "Who knows. I never found out. I think Baron knows but mum's the word about that. It's a legend after all. A true one. Sad that nobody talks about it." The ghost spun around. "Must be the vagueness surrounding it."
Harry had secondary flashbacks of the Yule Ball and he willed himself to not physically shake from the horrible nightmares of it.
"Uhh…" he stuttered eloquently then breathed in and out. "I need to do more research on the history of the founding fathers, finding more about the friendship between Godric and Salazar, whathaveyou."
"Can I read your future using tarot cards?"
"Who was Grindelwald?"
"Do you know about the Salazar Slytherin legend?"
Harry smiled. "Pretty good."
"Harry, my boy," Professor Binns said with utmost urgency, "you must find a Pureblood wizard or witch as soon as possible and bring them here before it's too late for me."
"Watch," Harry whispered before he shot his hand in the air.
his brain unhelpfully supplied.
"Can I ask another question?" Harry inquired after handing Malfoy a powdered root of asphodel.
"I didn't overdose. I took less than five drops as recommended."
"It went great," he answered and willed himself to speak slower, to not act unusually. This was a normal question yet every time she asked he found himself sweating.
Professor Binns stared at him for long moments of silence before, and Harry had never witnessed this, laughing out loud. "Oh! I can assure you, Mr Potter, that I am truly alive and kicking."
"Generally dark wizards and witches don't try to produce Patronuses."
"What do you need to be a Healer?"
"Of course she is alive! What kind of question is that?"
"Oh well, how do you say 'bugger off' in Latin?"
floor, of course. Where else would it be?”
"Lower your tone, Mr Potter!"
Fat Friar twirled twice hovering higher above the floor. "We all deserve forgiveness – even if Sir Nicholas and Baron disapprove."
"Harry! Please! Fetch a Pureblood immediately."
"You know what I meant. How do you, like, do it? Day by day?"
He would find himself in the common area chatting with Ron, Neville Longbottom, and Dean Thomas about next year's Quidditch World Cup, blink, and he would be in the Great Hall with everyone, enjoying their meals. He would blink one more time and find Professor Flitwick jotting something up on the board in his Charms class, blink and he would be up on the Astronomy Tower contemplating a world where Harry Potter ceased to exist.
Sleep came at long last.
"Wonders never cease," he absently corrected Harry.
"Okay, alright. I honestly do not understand how you get Os alone in Potions. This is proving hard."
, Madam Pomfrey! I am sorry for not knowing the right amount of sleeping potion drops I was meant to—"
for lack of a better phrase.
i want to apologize for the information OVERLOAD of the world of hogwarts and beyond. y’all already know your ABC’s about it but i don’t think it would hurt to re-learn? and who knows, maybe you’ll learn something knew.
Harry nodded, storing the information for later to tell Malfoy. “Thanks, Fat Friar.”
"All Hogwarts portraits are up in the Headmistress' office," she gushed. "Naturally they are there! Why did I think they would be anywhere else? It's Hogwarts tradition."
"Find what?"
"Would you like to be partners? You know, inter-House and all? We worked well together during the Yule Ball…"
Malfoy narrowed his sharp silver eyes at her.
"Do you know about the Godric and Salazar legend?"
"He's worried about you. The last thing you two argued about was Ginny and that morning he wanted to apologize during breakfast but you wouldn't wake up. It's been eating him alive."
"We have no teacher teaching History of Magic so that leaves the position open."
Harry choked on his cake. He rapidly beat against his chest, still in a coughing fit. He drank the remainder of his tea quickly and his airway was cleared. "Lover? Dumbledore had a
“It suits him, I’m just not sure I could do that. He’s very noticeable, I’d rather blend in.” Harry said, gesturing to his outfit once more.
Nobody has a kitchen this clean, magic or not. I will find the mess, believe me.
The second time it happened, was as the couple held hands, just about to walk through the fireplace into the Weasley home. Draco’s hands were trembling as he whispered, “Scared, Potter?”
“Why won’t you tell me? I Scared, Potter?”
Even though Harry saw a lot less of Draco in the following weeks, given that he now had an actual job, their relationship continued to grow. It was another two weeks before Harry decided he should probably tell a certain someone about the newest addition to his life. Ron was going to have a heart attack as it is, the least Harry can do is be the one to tell him.
However, Harry felt himself becoming more and more uneasy as the day approached. He could feel the familiar knot in his stomach that always appeared in the presence of Draco Malfoy, but there was something else as well. An anxious nervousness, as well as the familiar one Harry had become accustomed to.
It was a wreck. There’s no need for Harry to have this many near identical T-shirt’s, but he does, and they are everywhere. On the bed, the chair, the floor, the bookcase.
After the tea and coffee station was packed away and everyone else was gone, he sat back down at the front of the church, and prayed. Literally only God knew how long. Hours maybe. He didn’t care. He just sat there, Bible in hand, fighting off tears. He felt alone in a way he never had before, even in his darkest moments, he thought there was someone there for him. After everything he’d done, this is what God abandoned him for. Needless to say, Harry had completely forgotten about the date with Draco, swept up in his own emotions.
“I never get to go first,” said Antoni, waving Harry toward the kitchen. “So Harry, you grew up in a muggle house, right? What were you eating.”
Draco sat down on the pew next to him. “It’s nearly four o’clock Harry.”
This is the most fun writing I have ever had, after I sorted out the formatting mess!! Seriously there’s a reason Queer Eye is a tv show not a fic, horrendous to format. What are tenses. I don’t know.
Antoni was the last to sit down,“Listen Jonathan, Thunderbird is the best house. We’re not having this conversation again.”
To say Draco was stunned was an understatement. Both Harry and Alex were steering to wonder if he was okay, he stood in silence for so long. When Harry offered to take him home if he wasn’t feeling well, Alex started to walk off. The shock of his date walking away forced Draco into action again. He tried to go after him, but Alex was lost in the crowd.
He was beautiful. Truly. He’d grown up a lot in the past few years. Grown into the pronounced cheekbones that once made him look pointy. He looked poised. His robes were just loose enough to be professional, but tight enough to capture Harry’s imagination. Harry had never seen someone walk into a room so elegantly, or smile in a way that made Harry want to make a fool of himself, purely to see that smile again. Any hope of pushing his feelings away was crushed. Draco overwhelmed him, so much that he couldn’t lie to himself anymore. He couldn’t understand. How could something that felt so good be wrong? If it wasn’t right, why did he want him so badly? Because make no mistake, Harry did want him. Almost desperately so. Harry had been working with Draco almost a year by the time they were making small talk at their boss’s annual party. The first time Draco said it, Harry thought he’d misheard. “Can I buy you a drink,” he’d said, “maybe next Sunday?” Against his better judgment, Harry agreed. How could he not. He didn’t know when he’d next get this opportunity, and he wasn’t going to waste it over the opinions of a minister from when he was 15. They swapped phone numbers, the alcohol providing Harry the courage he was known for.
This has not been beta’d and was fuelled by pure enthusiasm and new Jonas brothers so there are probably mistakes. I apologise.
I already like him, he clearly has good taste. Just saying.
“I’m trying to help you,” said Draco. “You should go to the palace if you want a princess. Get on the district line to St James’, knock on the door at Buckingham and see what happens.” Maybe the sarcasm was taking it too far, but at this point it was a core part of Draco’s personality.
Clearly, this is something that Harry loves, and if we can take even one percent of the care that Harry has for his students and turn it onto himself, I’ll consider this week a success.
Tan carefully looked at Antonio’s jeans. “Okay, I see where you are now. Definitely more casual. Maybe you could step it up a little though? Instead of denim how about a linen? Or a blazer?”
Now it was Draco’s turn to be lost for words. Taking his boyfriend's hand in his own, they walked in silence to the gates of the manor.
Draco went into his usual club. Technically a muggle place, it was a popular spot for wizards like Draco: gay, single and avoiding the wizarding press. He went in as usual, using the alias Drake Malcom. Not particularly inventive, but it did the job just fine. He wandered up to the bar, and ordered his regular drink: vodka lemonade. He danced with a few guys, none of them were Prince Charming, but that didn’t matter. He wasn’t looking to get married. At the moment he was with some guy called Alex, who was nice enough. Handsome too, if you’re into the muscly guys. That’s when he noticed someone watching the two of them from the bar. Not in a creepy way, just observing. Draco made eye contact with the mystery man, who stood up and walked towards him. Draco went back to dancing with Alex, when  the mystery man spoke up from behind him.
I solemnly swear that I am going to do my best to keep writing if you keep showing support for a new chapter.
“I will, just not yet.” Harry glanced back at the letter in his hands, as if it were able to creep away if he didn’t pay it enough attention.
How could Draco say no.
“Yes! I love that. Thanks for sharing with me.” said Karamo as he pulled into a parking space.
“During the war. I always had it short when I was young, not by choice though. So after the war I wanted something different, so I just left it.” Harry moved his hair around, so that his part was just right of the centre of his head.
“I can feel the tears already.”
The rest of the fab five slowly retreated out of the room, Karamo falling back on his social worker skills. “It makes total sense that you wouldn’t want to use it, and I’m sorry for bringing it up. Have you ever thought about getting rid of it? Because it clearly doesn’t bring you any happiness.”
Harry took a step closer, so the two men were no longer separated by the meagre distance of the table, “Oh yeah, sure Draco. So helpful. Please, enlighten us all, tell me how ‘This pumpkin pie tastes like elf piss’, is constructive!” The tone was definitely escalating, and Jonathan worried there might be a fight to break up. But with every step closer and voice raised, they both smiled more. You could feel the tension between them, but it wasn’t dangerous or aggressive. Their eye contact strengthened, clearly passionate about something more than Harry’s failed baking attempts.
They sat and finished their drinks, cramped around the tiny table, while Karamo shamelessly flirted with Ron until he had to leave for work. When Jonathan finally finished, Antoni put the chairs back in place. “Guys, can we go see the flat already?”
“I don’t think I have any other pictures on here I like, but there is something,” said Harry, putting his phone away. “Draco and I started teaching at the same time, and there’s a picture of the two of us at the Christmas Ball last year. Full dress robes and everything, so it’s almost fancy enough for this frame. I'm sure there's a copy of it somewhere.” Harry handed the frame back to Bobby, smiling at the memory.
A month and a half after Harry joined the group, they had made significant progress. Harry was reading late into the night to keep up, wanting to get ahead of the others. It was almost 3am when he reached Leviticus 20:13, one that the minister had pointed out specifically. Of course, it would be this verse that the group would focus on. At the next meeting, Harry didn’t necessarily agree with everything that was said, but it didn’t affect him too much. Harry has known for as long as he could remember that he loved girls. So even though he also liked boys sometimes, he wasn’t gay. After all, he couldn’t be gay and like girls. Everyone gets gay crushes from time to time. He was fine. He was normal. Most importantly, he was safe. He wasn’t disgusting. He couldn’t be gay, so God still loved him.
“We made our home together. Now I get that you probably won’t live with Draco for that long, but you should still have a space that works for you, functionally and aesthetically. I wouldn’t know either of you lived here, just by looking at it.”
Harry smiled slightly. “Yeah. The kids are amazing. I feel like everyone remembers the really great teachers, the ones who they know care about them and really love their subject and their job and really want the best for everyone in their class.” His grin grew as he went on, “Draco and I talked about it when we started, the teachers we loved, they had such a profound impact on us. We wanted to be that for someone. To help the next generation find themselves and be better than we are.”
Interesting
Tan was genuinely horrified. “Okay, I know that was a really hard time for you, but that makes me genuinely sad in my heart.”
Too flamboyant! Girl, you showed up in a silk shirt and I’m wearing knee high boots. Chill.
“It reminds me too much of my childhood. I used to live in a cupboard like that. Well not like that, it was under the stairs, but it was still a cupboard. And it was my room till I was eleven.”
When the Sunday they were due to meet arrived, Harry panicked. He knew not every verse should be taken completely literally (mixed fabrics, come on? Really?) but he couldn’t get the thought out of his head. God won’t love him anymore. As a last ditch attempt to earn God’s favour, he decided to go to church. As he walked into his old church, he realised it hadn’t changed. He sat in his usual spot, and made casual conversation with the same people he always had. As if nothing had changed, which couldn’t be further from the truth. Although the building looked the same, it didn’t feel the same. He didn’t feel the sense of belonging he’d always felt. He sang the hymns, he read the verses but he didn’t feel like God was there. He was already too late.
The microwave beeped rather aggressively for Draco’s liking, and he removed the plate of curry carefully, to avoid adding another burn scar to his hands. “Do you even know what you’re looking for,
Harry lowered his voice to an equally quiet whisper. “It’s not your parents that are the problem.”
Just saying.
- Part 1, complete -
“I’m great actually. Ready for more fun.”
“I’ll find the right one eventually, now will you leave me alone.”
“Cause none of this,” said Bobby looking around the room, “looks like it belongs to you.”
Harry’s smile was so wide it nearly came off his face. “No. You’re kidding. Why? Who nominated me?”
“Can you trust me? For one minute.” Draco was quieter, nervous. As if he was going to tell Harry all his secrets.
Perfect. That made Draco feel spectacular. Just great. Still, he slowly lined his eyes with a dark green cat eye. “Hallelujah.” He said through gritted teeth, “maybe I’ll finally be able to bring someone home without them falling for you.”
I'm BACK! Miracles happen. I loved writing this chapter, feels great to get back in the groove. I'll try and update more regularly from now on but as a full time student who also works, volunteers and goes to therapy, I can't make any promises.
“So Harry, take a seat,” said Karamo, taking his own place in the booth. “You told us you were half Indian yesterday, so Antoni pulled some strings to see if we could get your family records, and we’ve got some big news for you. This might be a shock.” Karamo gently took Harry’s hand, “you’re actually not Indian.”
“You must be Draco,” said Antoni, iced tea in hand, “which makes you Ronald.”
The tears were getting close again. Harry tried to say as little as possible, for fear his movement would cause him to start crying. “Yeah, I guess.”
“What is up with you?” Draco almost screamed the question, dragging Harry back from the curb. “What’s wrong.”
First person to guess the year this is set in will get to name something in a later chapter. (This is not me being bad at naming locations.... its a fun challenge. No I will not be taking questions.)
Harry laughed, by now more than used to the criticism of his style choices. Or lack thereof. “It’s fine, honestly. We just had bigger things to worry about. I guess I just never learned how to dress well.”
“We just don’t have that much of our own physical stuff,” admitted Draco. Vague, yes. But significantly easier than admitting to five virtual strangers that he hated his upbringing and Harry didn’t have one.
Harry didn't even begin to take it seriously. It was that crazy. “You're kidding right?”
“You know what, I actually can’t think of anything. But I’m ready.”
No way. Draco recognised that voice. But there’s no way he was right. Draco turned round and recognised the face as well. “Harry?”
Draco pointed at one of the speakers which Harry had tuned out of his brain ages ago, and promptly walked away. Refocusing on the music, Harry came to a revelation. “All I want for Christmas is you”, was blaring from the corner of the store. Harry replaced the scarf in his hand, and wandered over to the jewellery section, looking for something to match Narcissa’s tastes.
“I said what did you get me, Merlin's beard you’re going deaf.”
“I never cared! That’s rich coming from you.”
“Okay, cool. So is that the food you’d want to learn to cook for yourself?”
He opened the bathroom door (the lighting is just better in there, as he’d tried to explain to Harry many times) to be confronted by non other than Harry James Potter. In nothing but his BTS towel. By now, Draco knew all their songs off by heart, but not by choice. Harry pushes past him to go to his room, and then shouted through the door. “I’m going to out so you don’t have to wait up. I’ll probably be back tomorrow.”
later.
(See the end of the chapter for
“This gorgeous man right here.” Jonathan pointed to Draco with the end of his wand.
Harry resisted the urge to touch Tan’s hair. “Oh my god I love your hair! It’s so much better in person.”
The flat went silent. Harry’s voice was barely above a whisper, “Maybe if I could we wouldn’t have this problem.”
During the war, Harry had no time for anything, never mind church. Still, he carried his pocket bible everywhere in Hermione’s genius beaded bag. Every night, he read the same psalm. Number 23. The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing. It was the last thing he thought of before he died. He wasn’t afraid, even in his last moments, because his parents and his God were there to guide him. And it all worked out okay, in the end. Everything was fine.
I don’t always agree with Tan, but this time he’s right. Harry really does have good taste.
“Okay, well we can definitely figure something out so you guys don’t have to share a room, but we get this cupboard out of your space. This is your home now, you shouldn’t have to look around and be reminded of the worst times in your life.”
Draco sighed, “Since when have you cared what my parents think?”
Harry stared at the altar, “When I wasn’t at Hogwarts, this is where I’d be. This was my second home for years, and now it feels like I don’t even belong here.”
“Agreed,” said Harry, jogging to keep up.
The fab five fix up post war Harry. That’s it. Day One of Harry Potter on Queer Eye.
“You haven’t been in my room?” asked Harry. “I thought you would’ve gone in earlier.”
Sure enough, Antoni opened the tallest cupboard to find the fridge, and was instantly met with a lingering smell. “Clearly, one part of the kitchen has been neglected,” said Antoni. Draco was about to cast a few more cleaning charms, when they were interrupted by the doorbell.
“Shouldn’t you be going to bed. Or are you going to lecture me all night.” said Harry, obviously no longer enjoying the conversation.
“Yeah, sure,” said Draco. They walked up to Gardner's Crescent and eventually arrived at the beautiful apartment building, “This is us. My aunt Andromeda bought it off an old woman before the war, but she decided to move to the country instead so it's mine now. Ours, I guess.” Draco dug his keys out of his pocket, and let everyone into flat 5F.
“Didn’t expect to find you here”
“Fuck it.” Harry raised his tiny shot glass in the air, “To hair.”
Harry took a deep breath, and refocused himself on what was in front of him. “No, I want to keep going. This all looks so good.” Harry watched as Antoni and Tan brough over pan after pan of rich brown, bright yellow and even deep purple curry, and platters of bread, rice and multi coloured salads.
“Okay, got you. Who’s your style icon, if you had to choose?”
“I’m allowed to leave when I’m not enjoying myself Harry, was that not clear to you.” Maybe Draco was taking it too far, he knew he had a habit of stepping over the line. But frankly, his night was going pretty well till Harry showed up, and he decided to say so.
"Maybe the same can be said about Salazar. Stir clockwise."
"It has a meaning? I thought it was a random name!"
"There's no shame in feeling like Malfoy is one of your friends," Madam Pomfrey said. "If you truly feel that he is worthy of friendship, nothing else matters. After all, you have more in common than you think."
Harry blinked and Professor Cutherts Binns was no more.
"Honestly Ron it's none of your business why Harry and Ginny are no longer dating," said Hermione.
“Because, son, she knows everything! Much cleverer than her mother, she. Bit dreadful about her stealing the diadem.”
"What's that?" Malfoy asked after a beat.
"You didn't continue?"
"From what I've heard, he still does not have his original memory but he's as pretentious as he always was when his memory was intact. It's as if nothing changed save from his experience teaching DADA."
"Malfoy?"
“Oh.” Harry’s eyes wandered off to where a certain blond would normally sit during meals. He could almost see him, sat with his long fingers poking his fork into a juicy piece of duck, nodding his head at whatever Parkinson or Nott were chatting about. He cleared his throat. “You want to get back together?”
"Harry Potter!" The ghost raised his mug in the air. "So glad to have bumped into you. Hope I didn't frighten you."
The Golden Trio automatically looked over to where Neville was gathering ingredients from the Potions cupboard, accepting instructions from Hannah Abbott.
Harry nodded.
"Did you find Salazar's?"
The following day at lunchtime, Madam Pomfrey made her way downstairs to the Great Hall where students of Hogwarts were having a hearty feast. She made a sharp right and walked over to the Slytherin table. She spotted Malfoy first, his head turned to Nott, talking in hushed tones, fast and furious as if in an argument. With Zabini and Parkinson's backs to her, she did not know what they were saying but they seemed to be involved in the bickering as well.
Harry plopped himself back on the edge of the Tower, this time seemingly removing a pen and paper out of thin air. Malfoy sat down as well, about a meter or three between them, and stretched his head back.
"Who promised you?"
"They're unfortunately not around during the day," he drawled.
Malfoy-like gesture. "I suppose so. Actually yes, they're all hung except for Salazar's which remains a mystery. I asked Slughorn and he simply said it was because Salazar himself did not want to which might make a bit of sense."
Malfoy wrote three more items on his parchment and then asked, "What do you mean?"
"You only have an hour," Madam Pomfrey instructed the following day at Harry's next guest, Hermione. "I will come in that hour to ensure you have left or simply kick you without a warning."
He had been careful when opening it, his wand at the ready to protect himself against whatever was going to come out from the door but alas, no such thing came at him. Instead, as he walked into the room and the door quietly shutting behind him, he was met with a massive state-of-the-art kitchen.
"Some things should not be relit like Harry and Ginny's relationship. Would it be fair to Harry to simply agree to date Ginny when he did not love her romantically? It would be fair to anybody."
"I'm a growing boy, Mione," he mumbled between bites.
“Yes. It’s inconspicuous enough and won’t arouse suspicion.”
Fat Friar, strangely, disappeared below the ground without another word. It was a bit out of character for him, but well Harry had just met the monk and did not in fact know much about him to say he was acting out of character. When he arrived on the 10
“We… it’s been a while.”
It was on the tip of Malfoy's tongue to agree with Harry but he did not. Instead, he said, "Then we keep on going with it until we find what happened to the two founding fathers." He stretched out his hand towards him. "Deal?"
"Alright, I'll bite. How did I die?"
He turned to Neville, hopefully.
He cast a
"Of course it is! Slytherins are nothing if not loyal. Betrayal cuts deep to a Slytherin and the fact that the other founders betrayed his loyalty is enough to not want his portrait hung alongside theirs."
"Astronomy."
He was sat at a corner in the large library and on their table was Neville, Ron, and Hermione. Ron was simply there because Harry dragged him along instead of letting him play chess with his sister Ginny.
Malfoy pursed his lips, looking as if he were about to say something but decided against it. "I don't even want to know. Anyway, the first was Illyius."
Harry nodded.
"Is that why some people keep the lesson?"
Without wanting to cause a fuss about his lack of sleep and cause a worrying strain to his friends
"You still take it. And Hermione says that you always get O's."
Harry bit down on his tongue and looked away from him. Malfoy took his silence as a response and muttered under his breath that it was no surprise he was going to be an Auror.
“What’s to think about?”
Harry chuckled. "I'm the Special One, remember?"
“Potter, did you listen to a word McGonagall said in class?”
"Yeah, yeah. What happened next?"
That was the problem was it not? That because Harry was always surrounded by people, followed by hundreds of thousands of fans, adorned by millions of people wanting a glimpse of The Savior, that he was always caught talking to someone or other that it was easy to associate Harry as having lots of friends. But he often felt even more alone than the lonely nights he spent wandering the cold halls of Hogwarts during his insomnia-ridden days.
"He could try," Ron mumbled.
"I'm alright," he answered, groggily. He looked to his left and then his right then back to his left, there were no other patients in the Hospital Wing. "Why am I here?"
"I think it's best this way. He'll be more inclusive to like tell you information without me being there."
“Blue and yellow have no business together. Your auras do not match.” She simply got up from the table and walked out of the Great Hall without another word.
"Ah, decided to join us, have you, Mr Potter?"
kudos & comments - even the random ones, too - are HIGHLY WELCOMED as i love to read what y'all think (:
Malfoy narrowed his eyes at him before he slid the bowl of crashed Sopophorous bean. Harry accepted it and added it to his potion.
"Might I remind you that I deal with facts, not myths, Mr Potter."
"It's not so bad really. It's quite interesting, being able to read your future on cards."
floor, the ghost reappeared.
“I can’t find it in the Dungeons.”
Professor Slughorn clapped his hands five times, grabbing the attention of the class. "There shall be some changes to the guestlist for my dinner party tonight." Seemingly out of thin air, he produced a long blue parchment that he dramatically waved in the air. "With Headmistress McGonagall's request that we encourage inter-House unity, I shall be adding new students onto my list and dropping others."
"Since when do those two talk?" Ron wondered out loud.
"What about Sir Nicholas?"
“Hey Ginny!” he greeted.
or even change from its Animagus form but alas, Godric was constantly unmoved.
curse unto him as he did in Third Year when Granger emerged top in his year all because he had an A in Herbology whereas Granger had an EE.
"The couterpotion was not invented?"
Malfoy broke eye contact and looked off somewhere off her shoulder. "I am being accused of sending him to the hospital. A visitation would raise more suspicion."
"It's not common but yes it does exist. It's very dangerous magic, Harry; one that should not be taken lightly."
"Why, yes, dear boy! It is not a known fact that he had a lover, mind, but it's also not a secret."
That was all the information Harry needed. He had tried everything to sleep and if there was anything that was bound to work it would be this Draught. He simply needed to make sure Malfoy was not looking at him to pour himself some, lest he attracted questions from Malfoy as to why he was helping himself to the colorless Draught. It took some work but he coaxed Malfoy to hand the vial over to Professor Slughorn and in that time he speedily picked up a spare vial on the table, poured himself some of the potion and stuffed it inside his pocket.
"Me, Professor," Malfoy spoke coolly and his Slytherin friends all turned to him, varying degrees of shock and surprise, apart from Blaise who was chuckling silently.
“I was hoping you would direct me to where Godric Gryffindor’s portrait is located.”
"Wonderful!" Professor Slughorn clapped, Harry wondering how he got to them that quick when the last time he had spotted him he was at the front of the classroom writing something on the board. "And you, my dear boy, who is your partner?"
Malfoy sputtered. "You still don't understand the magnitude of what you did? You could've called any Pureblood – hell, even Weasley or Longbottom – but you chose me instead. So—thank you."
"Bummer," Blaise said, examining the collection of Pixie Puffs. "Can't imagine squalling in this forsaken place for more than an hour. This is a sacrifice, darling."
"It's not even, like, November and she smells like cinnamons. Bit weird, innit?"
His fork froze halfway to his mouth. In truth, he had not in fact been thinking about Ginny nor about Ginny
"You have extraordinary magic powers, I hope you know that. When you were not catching any sleep, your magic sustained your needs, in a way, it gave you energy to power through the day. You would presumably catch up to two or three hours of sleep in 24 hours and that was it. In those few hours, it was not enough rest consequently, your magic took over. It's currently the middle of October and I am assuming you have not been sleeping for a long time since the War, therefore your magic was tiring itself out, it was not able to replenish itself."
"I'm good. Do you think Neville has a partner already?"
“So, something significant must have occurred within Hogwarts.”
"Okay."
"Since when do you call him Harry?" Parkinson asked, turning to face him.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "Trelawney is permanently out of her marbles. That woman was batshit crazy. So glad I dropped it after my OWLS."
"You won't learn if you simply pass me the ingredients. Besides, what Potions partner would I be if you did not attain at least an EE at the end of it?"
Malfoy snorted and reminded him, "Sixth year, Potter. Sixth year."
Fat Friar expression hardened for just a second before turning into that of a joyful demeanor. Harry had heard of Fat Friar before, a wizard born a long time ago in the 980s, sorted into Hufflepuff and was taught by Helga Hufflepuff, one of the founders of the school. He joined the clergy – hence his monastery clothing – where he allegedly could cure the pox and was able to pull rabbits out of a cup. He recalled in his Fifth Year History of Magic class, Professor Binns teaching them that Fat Friar's kindness killed him in the end as he was murdered by his own churchmen.
"It's Astronomy, not Arithmancy."
“You’re not seriously listening to her. Our auras don’t match,” she mocked Luna’s airy voice. “We make our own rules not something you read on a palm or look into a clear ball.”
"In layman's terms, your magic eats itself to sustain you which is incompatible with one's nature. See here, if you drain all your magic you die and we all know that a wizard cannot live without magic."
"Why didn't you tell me?"
Malfoy's hands were up in a surrender motion, his chest moving up and down fast. "No-nothing."
Harry ignored her. "Please Malfoy, someone might seriously be dying."
"Ah, my students. So, so glad you're all well and good. Now, before I begin and forget, I want all of you to write an essay for the next lesson on the possible ingredients of Weedosoros." There was a collective silence of confusion around the class. "Yes, yes, I know, there is not much known on this mysterious poison but that is the point of the assignment. It could come in your NEWTS next year."
Karamo leaned against the countertop, waiting to collect his drink, “So, Ronald, how’s your day been?”
Not all of Draco and Harry’s endeavours were quite so sweet. It was Halloween when Draco arrived at Hogwarts, hungry for more than just the banquet. They hadn’t been apart this long in a while, and neither of them are the most stable people. After everything they’ve been through, how could they be? Harry almost collapsed when he arrived back at his room, his boyfriend lying on the bed with nothing but a vampire style cloak and a pair of boxers on. Not the most romantic of scenes, but Harry still felt weak at the knees. He stood in the doorway, speechless.
“It’s nothing.” Harry was met with a very skeptic at Draco. “Honestly it doesn’t matter.”
“Do you want to go bald Harry??? Cause I don’t.” Harry watched as Draco nervously ran his hands through his hair, loosening the usually fixed strands. He poured out four shots. “Scared, Potter?”
Draco faked surprise, “I think it’s us. I think we’re... maturing.” Draco gasped at the end of the sentence for emphasis.
“Okay.”
“Definitely. Draco, any you feel you like here?”
“Okay boys, calm down. Firstly Draco, I love this outfit you’re wearing, slay honey. If I had those shoulders, I’d be showing them off too. Ronald, I would die for that hair. I wouldn't even change it, little bit of pomade maybe, and you'd be good to go. You’re serving me braveheart, and like, gryffindor lion. I was in Pukwudgie in my day, and I rocked that cheer outfit.” Jonathan pulled up an extra three chairs to the table, definitely designed for four people not seven.
“Well I can definitely help fix that.”
Harry sighed, “I mean, I’m shocked, but not surprised. Pretty much all the information my Aunt and Uncle gave me about my Dad was wrong. Guess it makes sense they’d try and brush over his heritage as much as possible. Just another thing about me they wanted to avoid.”
A month later, and three similar girls had come and gone, along with the last of Draco’s sanity. Short of kicking Harry to the curb or confessing his feelings, Draco only had one choice. A one night stand. Not ideal, but it might just distract him from his problems for a little while. What choice did he have either way. Draco put on his favourite green shirt, the first pair of jeans he could find and the only pair of muggle shoes he had, and went to put some eyeliner on.  Makeup had been daunting at first, but Pansy has convinced him to try it once, and he did look good.
I want him to believe in himself as much as everyone else does.
Draco gestured vaguely towards his room, “All my clothes and stuff are in my room, if that’s what you mean.”
He was instantly met with a side eye from Bobby, “You’re engaged Karamo.”
“I don’t think so.” said Draco, putting his plate in the sink. “This affects me too you know. I can’t live with your mess forever.”
As always if you leave kudos/comments I will be forever in your debt!
“Wait, what. What do you mean I’m not Indian?” Harry gestured to the brown colouration of his skin.
Tan was thrilled to see Harry visibly sit up to answer the question. “Yeah definitely. Draco’s offered to take me shopping before but, he’s a bit much.”
Draco was staring at him like he wanted an answer. What was the question? Harry hadn’t been listening?
Antoni brought over a mountain of napkins, and finally sat down. “So by now you’ve probably figured out that Kanna is a Sri Lankan restaurant, and we’ve pulled some of their top dishes for you to try just now. One of the easiest ways to access a new culture is food, so before we dive into family history and geography, we thought we’d introduce it the only way I know how – over a meal.”
Harry was breathing heavily, still not looking at the Hogwarts Matron. He was seething but right now he had calmed down and a sense of tiredness was slowly overtaking his body.
"So," he looked back down at the flower in his palm, "he's really gone? No more Professor Binns?"
Mafloy-like.
Every fiber and magic in his being pulled him towards Harry – as it always did – but his logic, the Slytherin logic, ordered him to walk away and not think about what he was witnessing. To be smart and walk away. He cursed under his breath and stepped away from the shadows.
Bobby gathered a load of the frames into the trolley, and proceeded to speed through the shop. “Now that we’ve done that, let’s go and get some actual decor, cause all that floral is definitely not going to cut it.”
”That was was time and I didn’t even mean it! Besides she wasn’t good enough for you anyway.”
For the first time in years, Draco’s signature line was delivered with a smirk.  “Scared, Potter?”
“Are you going to open it or not?” Draco was almost as nervous as Harry, playing with the edge of his only muggle hoodie.
By this time in his life, Harry was getting good at keeping secrets, and he kept that night firmly to himself for a long, long time. He tried to push down his feelings, as if he could collect them in his feet and literally stomp them out. He directed his attention elsewhere, onto girls and school (and once that was over, Auror training) in the hope it would go away. He pretended it never happened. He hoped it would never happen again. And this was working splendidly, until the arrival of Draco Malfoy in the Auror department.
“I don’t really know. I never really learned how to shave, so I just haven’t. I’m not attached to it though.”
Harry fought off tears for the second time that afternoon. “Yeah, okay.”
“Yes queen!” The fab five tried to say in unison. Jonathan was a little bit behind, but it didn’t really matter to anyone.
Hope everyone enjoys this. As usual it’s a work of fiction and all that. Although JVN might be a wizard irl. Don’t quote me on that though.
“I really like this one,” replied Draco, without breaking eye contact with Harry. When he finally did look away it didn’t last long, with nervous glances exchanged between the pair every few minutes. When they were finally finished, Bobby packed up the van while Draco and Jonathan settled beside each other in the back, after Harry called shotgun. Needless to say, they left with the small table in their possession.
As it was, Draco had nothing to be worried about, although out of the corner of his eye he did spot 2 galleons being passed from Ginny to Ron. He later explained himself, “She reckoned you would never work it out, turns out you’re less clueless than she thought.”
This is going to be fun.
Bobby made a beeline for the decor section, and motioned Harry over to the photo frames. “I always find that the easiest way to make a house a home, is photos, especially because you guys don’t have that much stuff. So, you’re going to pick out some frames and tell me what picture you want in them. Sound good?”
Whenever you see what looks like a script (Karamo: in bold etc) it’s the little insert to camera bits that they add into the show. If you watch queer eye hopefully you know what I mean.
Harry couldn’t answer the question, not sure he could pick out linen in a line up. As usual, Jonathan swooped I’m to save the day. “I’ll save you from him, Harry. Tan can be, let’s say, over enthusiastic,” he said, receiving a fake glare from Tan, “but only because he cares. Alright honey, let’s see this hair.” Harry lead the way to the bathroom, and took his hair down, allowing it to fall just past his collar bone. “When was this last cut?”
There is really only one reason I chose to make Harry half Sri Lankan. I'm half Sri Lankan. I wanted to share a bit of myself with you guys, and brown Harry is so common in the fandom that I gave myself the artistic license here. All the foods I described are real dishes. Sri Lankan food is amazing and I'm more than happy to share recipes if people want to try any of the foods described.
“Pretty much straight after school. I knew I wanted to take a year off before I started teaching, just a gap year, to give myself a break. I looked around a few places before Draco’s Aunt told me about this flat. She’s a family friend, so I wouldn’t have to pay rent. Didn’t know Draco was living here too till I moved in.”
“I’d like to buy you a drink.”
“We can stay. I brought tea, Hermione said that firewhisky wouldn’t be appropriate for a church.” Draco opened the two flasks, and left them levitating in front of him.
It’s true, it barely looks used. Just like the rest of the flat, there’s virtually nothing there. Half the cabinets are empty. The countertops are sparkling, only a couple of plates and forks sit in the sink, being washed by a levitating sponge. The black countertops probably hide a few stains, but there’s a distinct lack of mess.
“It’s perfectly fine to feel however you feel right now Harry, take all the time you need.”
“Yeah”, said Harry looking around the room.
Sure enough, Harry checked his phone to find the time was 3:52. He was supposed to meet Draco nearly an hour ago. “I’m so sorry, I got caught up here. We can go now if you want.” His voice wavered, and the tears he’d kept at bay for nearly three hours threatened to emerge.
“I don’t know.” Harry put his now empty flask down gently on the floor in front of him, as if the stone floor could rip.
Karamo flung open the cupboard doors, to find that, ironically, the only place without clothes is the cupboard. It’s totally empty. “Harry, why are there no clothes in your closet.”
The fab five fix up post war Harry. That’s it. Day Two of Harry Potter on Queer Eye.
When they’d sorted the living room and started on the kitchen, Harry finally came into his element. He had to be dragged away from the most expensive gadgets, from two in one electric whisks and bread kneaders to food processors with more attachments than Harry could name, all of which Draco deemed pointless and shunned with one phrase; “You know there’s a spell for that don’t you.” Harry and Bobby spent almost an hour choosing kitchen cabinets after they realised even the cheapest cabinets could be magically strengthened and waterproofed, meaning all the designs were viable options. They settled on a clean looking wooden cabinet, black marble-ish countertop and quickly agreed on natural wood flooring. Draco was busy inspecting a tiny circular dining table, with just enough space for the two of them.
“Actually I do,
“And you’re barking up the wrong tree. Ron just got back from a very heterosexual date with his girlfriend, who is in fact, straight, like Ron.” Draco added, desperate to save Ron the embarrassment of his whole face going red. With a bit of his regular sarcasm thrown in of course.
Another reminder: I love Harry Potter but I love Trans Rights more.
Until Christmas. Harry was eighteen by now, which allowed him entry to all manner of establishments, magical or otherwise. He was in a muggle club when it happened. He had a revelation, but not of the religious sort. After too many beers, and a few extra vodkas for good measure, Harry kissed a boy. Not for any particular reason, he just felt like it in the moment. He could’ve chalked it up to intoxication, if he hadn’t enjoyed it so much. It felt good. It felt right, as much as anything he’d ever done with a woman. Like every last nerve in his body was on fire.
“Cook something good and I won’t have to complain,” said Draco, rolling his eyes.
He’s never really had a family or a place where he belongs and that’s sad. Everyone should have a home you know.
“Not exactly. I just… I want them to like me. Actually like me, not just put up with me like they usually do.”
"Yeah, something of the sort." Harry had heard of it and made a note to ask Hermione about the quote later on. "Can—Do you need help?"
Hermione had raised her hand and promptly answered.
"That's it?" Malfoy asked after Harry remained silent. He stared at him, hoping he would add more onto his words but he remained mum. "Goshawk wrote a bucket load of information about the Charm than you, Potter."
“Messed that one up, didn’t I?”
Harry shook his head. "I couldn't sleep at all, Hermione. I used to have nightmares after the War and would only sleep for two, three hours a night. Just before we came back to Hogwarts, I barely slept at all. Like, the entire night I didn't sleep a wink."
Hermione leveled him with a look that told him he was a colossal idiot. "Of course, Harry! That's where nearly all the previous Headmasters and Headmistresses portraits remain."
Harry looked down at their Cauldron Cakes and he wanted nothing but to eat it. Malfoy seemed to be in a bitter mood for not having transformed the Cake before Hermione and he stared hard at it as if by the power of his eyes he could transform it to Hermione’s identical green cabbage.
Harry woke up with a start.
"The diadem was destroyed."
Malfoy snorted. "Please, that's a stupid course."
He had been aimlessly walking, darting his eyes right and left at the numerous portraits on either side, all representing past Hogwarts professors, personalities, celebrities and other icons. In seeing portrait after portrait, it occurred to him to find Godric Gryffindor’s portrait. That should have been their first plan, really, to find his portrait and inquire where Godric – the real Godric, not the portrait Godric – was buried. He figured that Drac-Malfoy was going to tackle Salazar’s portrait.
Harry's eyebrows pinched, racking his brain. "Going to bed last night. Yeah, I was going to bed."
"Snape, but he never got around to it. He was busy teaching me Legilimency and Dark Spells to prepare me to be a Death Eater."
"I thought it was on Poison Antidotes?"
"They agreed on everything. Well, apart from the Muggleborns situation, they agreed on everything else. Some were jealous of their friendship, you could say, some wishing them ill intent but nothing Salazar could not fix, you know? Nothing Godric could not forgive."
Harry grabbed his wrist to stop him, urgently saying, "It's… important. I think he's dying."
"He's your Head of House so he'll, like, be more willing to convey information freely than if I asked him," he said and for sure, Harry had had a lot of experience with this. "Plus, you can be charming when you want to be."
“Oh?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "You expect me to believe you want to be an Auror after that performance? It looked like you'd rather swallow a whole bottle of Skele-Gro than become an Auror."
"We're technically revising for our NEWTS."
He was reminded as he looked at his best friend calmly watching him of Dumbledore's words, of his many, many cryptic words that often made no sense. However, this time, they did. He once said that words were always a source of an inexhaustible source of magic, capable of inflicting and remedying injury. See it was often not magic itself but rather words that were more powerful.
"Is there something wrong with being Malfoy's friend?"
"Any other subject?"
“What does that have to do with my relationship?” she asked, irritated.
"That's… sad."
PS nothing is 100% accurate teehee
"What does that mean?"
"That's one way of putting it but it is still about, like, theoretical stuff, right?"
Lunch was already served when they arrived but Harry found none of his friends were present. He found it odd but quickly remembered that they were all in the library finishing a last minute Arithmancy essay before their class. He looked across the Great Hall and indeed neither was Malfoy.
"Easy. By lighting another fire."
“Blue?”
"There has to be something more," Ron insisted.
Hermione hummed again, deep in thought. "For hundreds of years since 1368 Godric has not talked, moved, changed into human form, and for what? Why?"
Harry hesitated, "You were quite old when you died. Um, you fell asleep in the staffroom fire and you died in your sleep. The next day you got up and continued teaching as if nothing happened but, like, as a ghost."
"What?" Harry jogged to catch up with Malfoy who was taking rather large strides towards the Charms classroom. "What do you mean?"
Draco got an inkling that he was not meant to have found Harry Potter on the edge of the Astronomy Tower looking sightlessly before him. It was Malfoy's space, the one place he found peace of mind and was now rather occupied by The Boy Who Lived… Twice. Taking a closer look, he found Harry's head bowed and his hands lightly trembling on his lap. He briefly wondered if he was crying. He murmured the spell
"Doesn't sound familiar."
Malfoy smirked. "I learned a lot from Mother about it so everything Professor Sinistra teaches I know. It's a free pass for my NEWTS if I'm being honest. Like how DADA is for you."
Malfoy nodded. "It's not really talked about, I don't know why but I think mainly because it's a Salazar legend and," he lightly shrugged, "not many people care about him, not after his sullied reputation."
Harry's eyes narrowed. "Why do I get the feeling you're lying?"
"But he was taught by the founders of Hogwarts themselves, I do think he would help us."
"The Wiggenweld Potion was curated immediately after the invention of the Draught of Living Death," Madam Pomfrey expounded. "It was the sole antidote to this particular Draught but it's generally used for
Hermione promptly cut him off with a sharp glare. "It's our
"Yes, the ones found in the sky, Potter."
“Sure,” he readily agreed, visiting Hagrid put off for another day. They made small talk, Harry inquiring about Charlie’s adventures with dragons in Lithuania, of Molly’s new cooking spells, what new Muggle objects Arthur acquired and if Bill figured out a name for his new baby girl.
"Do you know who was the first?"
Professor Slughorn clapped his hands, Harry almost jumping in fear from how close he was to his ears. "Unfortunately, my students, I have just remembered that before we can proceed to brew today's Potion we need to have a sufficient amount of Sopophorous which we do not have enough for everyone in this class. Thank you for the reminder, Ms Abbott. Therefore, change of plans, slightly. Today's class shall entirely be theoretical. You and your partner are to write 65 reasons why Sopophorous is important when brewing a sleeping potion."
Harry opened his mouth to challenge him, deny it but Malfoy eyes bore deeply into his with a singular raised eyebrow that dared him to prove him wrong. Harry made an indignant noise and looked sightlessly before him.
In truth, he does not have nightmares anymore but he does have insomnia. He can never find himself feeling sleepy, even during one of Professor Binns lectures, he was the only one that seemed to stay awake. Sometimes he longed for the nightmares, for the times he would shift in his bed and wake up drenched in sweat from the horrific images of Nagini eating him whole. At least in his nightmare days, he would sleep, even if it was for a mere three hours per night, that was more than enough.
Malfoy spun on the spot and walked back to him. He gingerly reached the space between them and took Harry's hand in his. He opened his hand, palm facing towards the ceiling. He then put a single pink carnation flower on his palm and then stepped back slightly.
"Really? Where was he this whole time?"
Harry nodded in agreement. "Exactly. No need to pester me with any more questions."
Not even one.
"Why would Godric forgive Salazar? Was it because of, like, the Chamber of Secrets?"
Malfoy's eyebrows scrunched together as he said, "I do, too."
Harry smiled like a Cheshire cat. “Tabby cat.”
“Good thing it’s a double.”
"Yes, Potter. The Charm. Heard of it?"
"I did some analysis on your body, after two private conversations from Ms Granger and Mr Malfoy, and your body has been deprived of sleep. It is quite something phenomenal."
“I’ve been meaning to talk to you.”
"You get to decide what to do with the flower. It's your choice."
"I am, like, extremely sad that he found me like that but I think it's best this way. All he'll do is ask about Ginny and convince me to get back together with her and like I don't want to."
kudos & comments - even the random ones, too - will be HIGHLY WELCOMED as i love to read what y'all think of it (:
"Why would Albus even want to be his friend?"
"Right?" Harry agreed. "If I could see the lion's tail, like, move but not Fat Friar, that should say something right?"
"Yes, my boy, already done with the assignment? I'm sure Draco can learn a thing or two from you."
Harry swallowed his chocolate frog. "Under?"
"Why did you overdose then?"
"Bummer."
Harry nodded.
"Zabini?"
"Because it releases juices more efficiently than simply dumping the bean inside the potion."
He uncorked the bottle, carefully to take less than five drops, put back the cork, and set the potion inside his bedside table and before his head hit the pillow, he fell into a deep slumber.
The Golden Trio turned to find Luna standing by their table, her eyes a little dazed.
Harry shook his head. "You're my first guests."
She smiled at him. "It's magic, Harry."
"What happens now?"
"He had a falling out with the rest of the founders due to his stance of killing Muggleborns at Hogwarts."
"Ah, you might know him as Grindelwald," Madam Pomfrey amended but Harry's face remained blank. "Sometimes I forget you did not grow up in this world."
"Correct! Excellent as always…"
By her tone, Harry knew that she knew that he was going to end his life that night on the Tower but the last line, the last phrase of his letter was the issue.
"I don't know what I want to do." He swallowed thickly, quickly side glancing at Malfoy who was looking up at the stars in the sky. "I thought to be an Auror is what I wanted but after the War, like, I don't think I can do that anymore. Like, I don't have a lot of fight left in me."
"Yeah but that's because the Zabini family are experts on such things," responded Ron, then immediately shrugged. "As far as Pureblood families go, the Zabinis are known for Divination and Astronomy capabilities. They're the best."
Malfoy made a move to walk back towards the Great Hall. "I assure you, Potter, I couldn't care less about that old oaf."
He made a deal with himself that if the potion would not work tonight then he would go see the Mind Healer. He really did not have troubles, he simply wanted to sleep. He just wanted to shut his eyes and rest, and he would even take back the days when he would have nightmares the whole night because, at least then, he had had some shut-eye.
"Where is he?" asked Harry looking frantically where he had last seen his Professor. He squinted into the air as if to catch a glimpse of his very, very pale ghost professor but the air was crystal clear.
, his ears automatically sharpening their hearing skills, and confirmed to himself that he was not crying.
"Is he insane? How are we to find even 7 reasons," Ron grumbled under his breath.
Blaise shrugged and leaned forward to the bed. Spread across the center of Harry's bed were all sorts of sweets imaginable.
!" he cried out, remembering their code.
Harry smiled up at him. “Obviously. You can go through walls and I cannot. By the way, does it hurt?”
"But, like, Trelawney allowed Blaise to read our futures in class the other day and she seems fine."
Nott was the first to spot her fast walking towards the table and slowly the Eighth Year Slytherins turned their heads towards her.
"Mr Potter!"
He looked down at the neatly arranged ingredients and picked up the sloth brain. A hard clearing of the throat alerted him that he had picked the wrong ingredient. He dropped it and picked up another, no throat clearing, and confidently threw it inside the cauldron.
"You had had a Potions lesson that very day you drank the Draught and therefore concluded you sneaked some of the Potion for yourself. Everyone was questioned, including Mr Malfoy, Mr Weasley,
He figured that Malfoy did have a point that maybe Godric's lion did not present itself to be alive because he was with Fat Friar and perhaps if he had gone alone it would show himself to him? Simply because he was of the same House? What was more was why Godric was by himself on the floor? Before leaving that night, he had walked up and down the corridor and Godric was the only living person on that floor. Scratch that, he was the only living creature on that floor. The other portraits were simply of naturistic paintings such as mountains, oceans, forests, beaches, whathaveyou.
Malfoy scowled at him. "Not only are you slow but you're also stupid."
Malfoy leveled him with a look. "Potter, we studied this in Second Year in History of Magic. Were you not paying attention?"
"Wasn't poisoned."
“I’m not in pain.”
"I never thought I'd miss the cold hallways of the 14th floor."
“Hey Harry,” she greeted back. “I’ve been looking for you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Malfoy."
“I thought we were in secret about our mission?” Harry smirked.
"Did you finish the letter?"
Harry chuckled out of his own accord. "Hey, they were angry that they were being treated differently. A revolution had to happen."
Malfoy sat up straighter in his seat. "Nothing I can't handle."
"What?" he asked, confused.
"I focus on one thing, any one thing, a bit like finding a purpose. It does not matter if it is small or big, whether it is passing your NEWTS or going to Hogsmeade every weekend or starting a collection of different feathers of a bird; focus on something, anything to keep you going."
