"I want to stay in the Investigative Division." Harry pauses. "Maybe even apply for a transfer."
"Look, just leave it, all right?" Harry snaps. "I just said — "
"I do."
"You're here again," he says.
Everything seems to lead in circles.
"What?" Harry asks, uncomprehending for a moment.
* * *
It's all it takes for Harry to walk over to him and take his hand.
"He's not like that anymore, he's changed. He wouldn't have run away. You don't understand, you haven't seen the memories." He taps his knuckles impatiently against the table. "If he was forcibly taken away, it doesn't make sense that he'd just show up a few months later with Lucius Malfoy, have him arrested, then Disapparate again. And it wouldn't explain why he's still missing now." Harry pauses, aware of Hermione and Ron both observing him carefully.
Ron held her until she fell asleep.
Wonders, Harry thinks, will never cease.
“It was Matthew,” Astoria says angrily. “I recognise
"My divorce petition. The divorce has already been granted in absentia. It can't be reversed." Astoria is outright anxious now. Harry quickly shakes his head.
But there's no answer.
"Draco became very..." Narcissa pauses, then picks her needlework up again. "The war changed him."
"Did you hear me, Draco? I'm asking if you're happy," Narcissa says. Malfoy, once more, doesn't respond. He keeps staring at the portrait, eyes locked on his younger self. Lucius and Narcissa look proud, Harry thinks, and so much more complete. The toll of the war was high indeed.
Harry stood there, smiling at him. Draco straightened up.
The mocking nickname was passed around the streets and whispered gleefully as he went past. Faces tilted keenly towards him, all looking at him and giggling behind their hands. He could see the challenge in their eyes.
The sun kisses the air with the first real warmth of summer.
“What are you thinking?” Harry said, flicking a toast crust at him.
Two hours later, Harry's sitting in the middle of the bed, the objects scattered around him like autumn leaves. A prefect's badge catches the lamplight and shines brightly; an origami rose lays upon a cushion.
"I suppose we have something in common, then." Harry hesitates, thinking he shouldn't be sharing something like this with Draco, when he hasn't even told Ron or Hermione, but... "Most of the time, I don't want to go home," Harry says at last. "I don't even know where home is, really."
“I don’t know, Ron. But it’s a possibility.” Hermione sets her mug of tea back down. “I can’t believe I didn’t think of it before. When you Disapparate and something goes wrong, you get splinched, and the same thing happens when you use a time-turner incorrectly.”
Harry insists on visiting the beach before they leave.
"Oh, you're the most important, are you?" Harry mutters at it, taking its letter and narrowly missing an angry peck.
“ — and Lucius seemed to become obsessed with returning in time to alter certain choices. But Draco was
"You should not have found me." As far as Harry's adoring masses were concerned, he lived somewhere in Sussex. Only Hermione and the Weasleys know the truth.
They arrive in Southampton at eight thirty, the sun setting over the city, but Draco doesn't seem inclined to remain there. Harry mentions that observation and Draco shrugs.
, she's written.
He turns another corner. The bright summer memories fade, but it's all right. He's going home now. Straight ahead. No more corners, just a long stretch of road that rolls on and on.
A 2002 Renault Mégane coupé. Harry remembers the first time he saw it, the canvas falling away in swathes, the dust dancing through the air. It isn't a luxury car; it isn't anything spectacular. But it's Draco's car, and Harry misses it as much as he misses Draco. As much as he misses a clear night sky, and highways and Christmas tree lights and windswept cliffs and canola fields and the way Draco's eyes would flick to the rear-vision mirror.
* * *
Astoria greets Narcissa with a perfunctory hullo, but both women’s eyes are trained on Harry. It would be cruel to make them wait any longer. He takes a breath.
"You're laughing," Harry points out uncertainly. "Was there a joke?"
He doesn't know why, but the Felix Felicis — fading from his body, but still there — seems to know. So he allows the potion to control his decisions.
"Good, good. Now, ease your foot onto the accelerator a little — "
Harry waits, but Astoria doesn't elaborate and he thinks he understands, anyway.
"Don't
Footsteps. Harry glances up.
Harry restlessly paces the room. It looks awfully familiar and he realises, with a jolt, that it's the same room that was in Narcissa's last memory of Draco. Narcissa sits by the gilded fireplace; on the wall opposite Harry is the family portrait at which Draco had spent so long gazing.
"You said you found him?" she says breathlessly. Harry nods. He'd been deliberately vague in the letter, saying Draco had been found but was seriously ill and currently at St Mungo's.
They came again in the night, the dark shadows, their faces morphing, their voices low and accusatory.
"No," Harry says instantly. "I promised him."
Ron gives Harry one last look, then disappears from sight, sitting back down at his desk.
Harry laughs. “Bronwyn and Eric? After the last two captains of the Chudley Cannons?”
Hermione puts a reassuring hand on his arm. "You're doing the right thing, Harry," she says.
He hadn't cried. Not once in five years. Draco. Merlin.
"Foot still on the brake? Good. Handbrake off."
"Sold what?" Harry asks.
“Excuse me,” Draco says. “It’s Ron’s favourite team, of
Another short silence. Draco inhales slowly, then presses the ignition button. The engine purrs to life and Draco's breath catches. Harry wants to say something, but he recognises the moment doesn't belong to him.
There's nothing about this moment that feels victorious.
The fourth letter is from Ginny.
* * *
He slips the vial into his pocket and steps outside the apartment wards, Disapparating to the Ministry.
He starts the engine.
"It's all right, I know how important this is for you."
* * *
Harry feels the cold first, and then the rest of his senses filter through. He’s sitting in the driver’s seat of the Renault, but he’s him again. In his own head. It’s night-time, and he’s parked beside a playground in a small village in Hampshire. He glances into the rearview mirror, just to look at his own reflection, just to make sure he’s himself.
“Doesn’t that take ages?” Theo demanded. Harry glanced at him; he half-expected Draco to chime in too, sneering something derogatory about the lesson. But Draco was evidently engrossed in trying to read some graffiti someone had scrawled on his desk, nearly jumping when Slughorn resumed speaking again.
"Diagon Alley."
Ginny comes home in an unusually happy mood, especially since her team lost the match.
Arthur Weasley is delighted to see him.
"And what happened to the furniture? His car?"
Ron looks abashed. “Sorry, mate. But this case...you’ve been a bit obsessed with it. I dunno, it can play tricks with your mind sometimes.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, touching Draco's hand. “The roses, hey.”
“Yeah, well, I don’t like large groups of people skulking around and hissing like that,” Harry said.
But he doesn't. He just smiles faintly and says, "Is that an apology?"
"Why'd you do it?"
"Look, you're one of our finest Aurors," the man to the right of Williamson says suddenly. "You've got a stellar record. You've had a direct hand in catching at least half the Death Eaters — "
Harry doesn't move for a moment.
He can't stand to see strangers pulling apart Draco's car.
“I am
, Draco will say.
Harry opens the car door, walking around the bonnet to join Draco on the other side. For a moment they stand together, gazing out across the fields of sunshine-yellow. A starling settles atop a fence-post, its wings fluttering in the warm afternoon sun; nearby, a grasshopper leaps from stalk to stalk. Harry studies the canola flowers, watching the petals sway slightly in a faint breeze. Draco leans back against the warm car and Harry can hear the engine ticking as it cools.
It's the sort of place to which Harry could effortlessly come home.
As he's falling asleep, he thinks he can hear the ocean.
"No." Harry's tired of other people telling him what to do.
"Look at what?"
"What?"
“You do want to help, don’t you?” Hermione says.
Harry's heart misses another beat; he holds his breath for a long moment. Draco hasn't spoken of his time spent in the past, not once, and Harry never asked — much like his friends never asked about the war. Things like that — memories like that — should be given away like careful presents, and only to those who never demand them. Harry realises he's still holding Draco's hand, but he doesn't dare let go now, for fear it will somehow make Draco silent again.
"You can see me."
“You must make a better effort.”
Draco glances at him. "They're just canola fields."
Hermione gives him the news three days later. She Floos to his apartment very late at night, looking rumpled.
“No,” Hermione says, waving a wishbone at Harry.
, Harry will say, and Draco will give him one of those looks. The one where he tilts his head slightly, and his lips curl ever-so-faintly, a laugh hidden there. And Harry will step forward and kiss that hidden laugh, press his lips to the corner of Draco's mouth, right where that little smirk begins.
"I hope you're joking."
"Course not, I'm not a barbarian," Harry says. "I was thinking...good enough to brew Felix Felicis."
Maybe he'll take half the blame. But no more.
Yes, Harry thinks. He was part of the initial sweep team. He listens to Ron’s story, wondering how much is exaggeration and how much is outright fabrication.
. No, Hermione. He wouldn't have done that."
“I’ve got something for you,” Harry said quietly as they sat the next morning opposite each other at the Ravenclaw table. It was a dark morning, the sun still asleep. There was a silver frost and the stars were still out, cold and fresh, and Draco felt more alive than he ever had.
The house-elf frowns, then nods and disappears. It's gone for so long that Harry begins to wonder if it died on the way. He turns and surveys the hallway, with the uncomfortable chaise and spindly hall-tables lined with photographs, and picks up one of the framed pictures. Draco smiles up at him and Harry returns the smile.
Slowly, feeling as though his body is immensely heavy, he walks to the fireplace and firecalls his two best friends.
One more word appears on the parchment.
He was a coward and he knew it.
He unconsciously traces a fingertip along his bottom lip.
"No new leads," Harry admits. "But...I don't know. It's hard to explain."
Hermione tells Harry she's finalised the details of an extraction. That's what it's called, she explains. Rescuing someone from the past. An extraction. The process sounds complicated and involves some very difficult magic, but she's written it all up neatly, like a recipe, and says that at any moment, a team of Unspeakables can carry it out.
"Well, you probably noticed it subconsciously and your dream planted the information there for you."
And in the third drawer down, dust settled over Harry's scent.
“Tell them to leave him alone,” Dean said, sketching away with a piece of charcoal.
"No, that's fine." He gives her Draco's name and she assures him she'll 'send him through' if he arrives.
Draco smiles slightly, his gaze returning to the road ahead. "Anywhere."
He looks up into the sky suddenly, as if he heard someone far above call his name. For a moment, he can see it: himself as a young child, thin and small, reaching out to catch his first ever snitch. Wide-eyed and full of wonder, his mind full of funny little spells and castles and cauldrons and broomsticks. His friends, cheering him on. The stands full of young students waving banners and flags. All the way back then, he thinks. Before he had even the slightest inkling of what his future might hold.
. The only personal thing in this damn place, the only interesting thing, and he stole it from Draco.
In the morning, he wakes up alone.
The word was engraved into his body, he felt. Written across his skin, scrawled into his soul.
Still asleep? Harry thinks with exasperation, reaching for Draco's shoulder and shaking him gently.
Very brief notes, Harry thinks critically.
It has been a long time since Harry last cast that spell and he winces as soon as he says the word, waiting for the chaotic memories to smash into his mind, waiting to be caught helplessly in the riptide of someone else’s consciousness.
“Very good, Mr Nott, but you missed the rim,” Slughorn pointed out and Theo glowered. “So, once you have ensured you have a clean and happy cauldron,” — he paused, bouncing on the balls of his feet, his great stomach bobbing with him — “you may begin with the first ingredient.”
“Congratulations on closing the Fenwick case,” Holdsworth says. She doesn’t smile. Only the faint warmth in her voice indicates any praise. “This is your latest assignation.”
When he dares to look up, Ron doesn't look shocked or even surprised. He just nods and takes another swig of his butterbeer.
"Maybe you should have asked Malfoy where he is, then," Hermione says, and Harry's not sure whether she's teasing him or not.
“Draco disappeared.”
By the time Draco returns in the afternoon, Harry's gone for a drive, returned, and settled down with
"Draco would just open the door," Narcissa says. "As long as the key was in his pocket or in his hand, the door would open."
“What? I did her a favour.”
, Astoria's voice whispers,
Harry takes a seat at the table, moving a bag of seed sachets and a set of gardening shears from the chair.
He stills. The visions Voldemort sent him. The dreams of Sirius in the Department of Mysteries.
“Go to bed,” Hermione snapped. “You're just over-reacting.”
Harry wakes early. This is a routine and it grounds him like a lightning conductor. Wake early, go for a run. Shower, dress. Breakfast.
But he’s failing, Harry thought. All his classes. He can’t concentrate. His friends don’t stop the nasty rumours, the whispering…
In the distance, the sky lightens just a little more.
Harry reaches for a gingerbread newt and bites a foot off. The newt looks displeased.
Astoria moves suddenly, but when Harry looks at her, her arms are crossed and her expression is indecipherable.
Nevertheless, it doesn't deter Draco, who — after a leisurely breakfast — insists on a coastal walk.
"I've got something in mind," Malfoy says.
"No, I'm — I'm here for Draco, actually."
Harry looks away, unable to hide his smile.
He's expecting to notice a change. The wand has switched allegiances again, of course, and there will be some resistance. But the wand seems to greet him like an old friend.
Or at least, disappearing without Harry.
"Our relationship ending."
"I don't know...just..."
, the signs in the shop windows proclaim. Diagon Alley, enchanted to have soft, warm snow falling over its streets, is awash with festive cheer and every shop has a Wizarding Wireless playing carols and the beloved Christmas classics. Outside Quality Quidditch Supplies a sign states, in colourful lettering,
"Find somewhere."
He was never the same afterwards, was Draco Malfoy. Some said he got hit by a curse, that something Dark touched him. The Healers were forever on the scent of some grand miracle cure, some obscure curse. But Harry Potter knew whatever demons were inside Draco's head were of his own creation.
And then, he thought, there was nothing. Just blood and shadows.
"And now you're sulking again, I see. I've had enough of this childish behaviour. Tomorrow, I leave for Crete. You and your mother will stay here for three months, until the Ministry's attention has since moved on, and then you will receive communication from a reliable contact and you will travel to Crete."
“No.”
* * *
“He was
Harry wouldn't mind staying a while.
“I was in the middle of a memory.”
* * *
Hermione sighs. "It's a desperate last resort, Harry."
It's a bedroom. There's a bed in the corner, with hunter-green covers, although its hard to tell from the layer of dust over it. A bedside table, a dresser, and a neat stack of boxes in the corner. Harry turns to look at Narcissa, but she sees the question in his face without him uttering a word.
Harry studies the photograph. If he looks closely enough, he can see a faint smile on Draco's face. He looks younger than he should, Harry thinks. Or perhaps it's just the first time he's seen Draco smiling since he began this case.
It's something else entirely to say,
The Minister had actually come round in person. Narcissa had offered him a cup of tea.
He could question the shopkeeper, but it's unlikely he could give any further details. Besides, it's been five years, and Draco Malfoy was simply another customer.
The car is parked. He blinks and looks around. They're in the middle of nowhere, it seems. Darkness stretches away in every direction. Harry fumbles with seatbelt, unbuckling it before reaching for the handle of the car door.
"And I don't storm off, I make a strategic departure," Harry says.
...” Draco gestures broadly at Harry.
Ron gives him a long, shrewd look. "Right."
, but for Ginny it's the other way round?
“That doesn’t make any sense.”
Yes, he would. She accompanies him to a side-door — an old servant entranceway, Harry guesses — and gives him directions to the converted stables.
idea. Come on, Sophie, help clear the table,” Matthew adds, standing up; Ginny and Astoria are practically on his heels.
Narcissa says nothing for a long moment, pushing the needle through the cloth. "I don't wish for his possessions to be lost or destroyed," she says at last.
Harry switches the indicator on and overtakes a car in front. "Hermione and Ron will tell her they got the letter. She'll know you're all right."
Maybe Draco really did just leave. Maybe he's driving somewhere right now, driving down those long highways...
"Well, people change, Harry," Hermione says. "Just because you always wanted to be something, it doesn't mean you can't change. And yes, you've invested seven years in your career as an Auror. But there's no point staying in the department if you're not happy..."
He returns to Landewednack, driving through the narrow streets. Past the church with the kissing gate, the small cottages, the bridge crossing a small inlet. The guesthouse — a restored country estate — sits at the end of a meandering lane, set against the backdrop of the Cornish coast. Although the night is still young, most of the windows are dark. The other guests will already be asleep, preparing for early beach walks and trips to the nearby coves.
The highway unravels before him, an invitation onwards. He should take Draco to Snowdonia again, he thinks. It’s been too long since their last visit. They’ll sit beneath the ancient Welsh oaks and watch Neptune rise over the towering mountains.
Yes. He knew now.
"Thanks for that advice, Potter, I'll write it down so I don't forget."
Draco stares ahead at the road disappearing beneath the car wheels, the white lines flashing past as if the world is turning beneath them and they are standing still.
Not a minute later the door opens again, sending the silver bell chiming. Draco Malfoy steps inside.
It's a terrifying feeling. It's easy to lust after someone, to match their face to a missed heartbeat or a sharp intake of breath. It's easy to say,
“He's with you, isn't he?” Draco demanded, furious as Hermione shook her head jerkily, her face cold. “Please, let me see him! I don't care what he's been saying about me, as long as he's alright, please, I need to know — ”
Harry hides a smile as Draco pours two neat whiskeys.
. It's strange; Harry had always assumed Draco to be irritatingly arrogant and unbearably smug about classwork, but the first-year textbooks reveal pages and pages of notes painstakingly written in the childish hand of an eleven-year-old. Draco had recorded every step and, it seems to Harry, had been fearful of misfiring a spell or using incorrect technique.
Ron thoughtfully moved his king across a square. “Maybe you should talk to him.”
"How would you know?"
The headlights illuminate the endless highway and there’s something mesmerising, paralysing about it. He could go anywhere. He could just keep driving, heading into that unknown journey.
Narcissa raises a hand to her necklace. It's a habit she has, Harry thinks, when she's anxious or displeased.
"The exact price," Draco says, "of your ex-fiancée's engagement ring."
Around him, dust motes dance in the sunlight.
Draco looks at him. He looks terrible, Harry thinks. Thin and exhausted. Shadows beneath his eyes. Clearly, these efforts to appear are taking their toll.
"Do what?"
“No, it’s true! He can’t even tell those tiny second years to leave off, he has to wait for somebody else to speak up for him — his worst enemy, in fact. He must really hate himself.”
Harry didn’t sit at the Slytherin table.
Draco stares at Harry, then looks at his wand, then back to Harry again.
And Merlin, it feels so close to being perfect — they're sitting here, bickering like they used to be, but there's a faint familiarity that was never there before — and Harry just wants to stay here for a little while longer. Just a little while, until he can forget everything else in his life.
The next morning he sat at the Gryffindor table again.
“Have a fight.”
In the east, over the dark cliffs and the summer-soothed sea, the sky lightens.
When he returns to his office the next day, he solves his tenth case.
the blame. He sits in the driver's seat and places his hands on the wheel; he stares unseeingly at the road atlas; he leaves the car and paces restlessly around it.
They drive to Brighton. They stop in Hopper's Crossing, a small wizarding community, at Harry's request. Keen to avoid slack-jawed gazes and awestruck expressions, Harry uses a quick charm to change his hair colour and lengthen it slightly, covering his scar. It's not a particularly genuine effort, but it will work well enough. People won't be expecting to see him here anyway, and Harry's learned that people often see only what they expect to see.
"Tea?"
"Thank you, Potter, for that literary criticism. Why don't you run along and finish reading the 'Top Ten Female Players' article in Quidditch Weekly?"
"You look amazing," Harry says and Ginny smiles.
"You can go. I'm staying here," Harry says.
"Where are you?" Harry mutters, staring at the photograph. "Are you even alive?"
Hermione bites her lip. "I'm glad you're all right, but — what were you
Astoria looks up at him, surprise etched across her face. "Or started," she says slowly. "He said that too. Or started."
”This way, Potter. Away from the car, you know it doesn’t like magic.”
"Oh. Well, that'll be something new, at least. I'm looking forward to it."
* * *
"Right," Harry says. "Just wondering, that's all." If Draco had been taking something for depression, surely Astoria would know. He changes the subject quickly. "I'm visiting the Malfoy family solicitor tomorrow. Draco had an appointment with him."
“You are not — ”
Hermione's gaze softens. "Well, at least it's legal," she says, returning to her book. "Ron wanted to know if I knew anything about Essence of Insanity last week. Well, really."
One of the other Healer assistants, industriously writing on a chart, looks up and gives her a look.
Draco reads the letter once, twice, three times, before he speaks quietly.
"And now?" he says, his gaze unexpectedly flicking to Harry. Harry gives him a quick, uncomfortable smile before looking away again.
They sit on the sea defence wall and watch the yachts. There's a thin line of jagged wood, like teeth, farther along the beach and Harry suggests it's a shipwreck. Draco, far less inclined to think so fancifully, says it's the remains of a pier. A light argument ensues but soon dissolves when their attention is caught by two swimmers braving the sea and wading out past the breakers.
“Also from the Ministry, in particular the Auror Office, Miss Nymphadora Tonks accompanies us today.”
Draco had been… he had been understandably freaked out. But Remus thought he had done all right and that he had believed his assurances of his silence. He had refused the money Remus offered and when he tried to buy the moon keyring (what an idea! He really had to see about attaching it to his wand) he had taken it and instead he had given him a curious disc with a wave dividing it in the middle.
"You're not real."
"What?"
"Draco would be furious to hear me speak of it," Narcissa says. The sun is nearly set and he can see her reflection in the dark window. She's looking at him with an expression of sadness and he thinks that if she knew he could see her expression, she would quickly hide it. "But there is something about you that I see in him too."
Everything.
seen her cry — "
I stood and watched!”
"Only preliminaries," she says easily. "We're playing the Margate Rovers on Saturday."
"Multi-tasking is difficult when you're going sixty miles an hour," Harry retorts.
Draco opens his door; Harry does the same. They step onto the ground at the exact same time, gravel crunching against their shoes, and the wind rushes through Harry's hair like a crashing wave. Harry smiles and shuts the passenger's door. A second later, there's an echoing slam as Draco closes the driver's door.
"No, I don't," he says.
* * *
They finally left the Hall, making their way down to the dungeons and into the classroom.
"No," Harry says truthfully.
"I thought this was our destination?"
"Then off you go, Potter, and have a friendly chat with the endearing locals."
Draco had a very limited range of possessions, Harry thinks an hour later. It's surprising; he assumed Draco would amass a number of expensive but useless things.
Always, always, going away.
Footsteps on the stairs. Harry glances up. Narcissa walks towards him, one hand trailing along the banister.
When Harry wakes up, there's a rectangle of plastic in his hand.
“He’s mad at himself, I 'spect,” Ron said. “For being such a coward.”
He stirs, opening his eyes slowly, his gaze immediately locking onto Harry. He smiles, then, and Harry would give anything to capture that unguarded smile forever. Then he seems to wake properly.
"Little bit. Hey, Harry, are you a wizard?"
"Yes. The solicitor only really deals with Narcissa."
"Because I hadn't been there before. Because I wanted to."
"I'm happy where I am."
," he blurts out, dropping the wand.
He stands up and leaves.
"Oh." Draco turns a page. "Well, you said your Muggle relatives never took you places. Maybe we'll go back in the winter, when you can see proper snow."
Harry reaches out to take the keycard but before he realises what's happening, Draco's seized his hand and isn't letting go.
He went back for everyone else, during the war. At least, that's what he likes to think. He did it for them, the faceless thousands, the Muggleborns crushed beneath the cruel hand of Voldemort's regime. The witches and wizards whom so desperately hoped for a better future. His fellow Hogwarts students, filling the halls of Hogwarts with their screams as the Carrows tortured them.
“Do you remember,” Draco says, “when we were eleven?”
"Am I right?" Draco repeats. "You prefer the stars?"
The last light always fades too soon. The dancing slows down into standing and swaying, and Sophie is sent to bed despite her half-hearted protests. The house settles into the night, comfortable and quiet, until even the warbled lyrics of ‘You’re My Cheering Charm’ seem sentimental rather than saccharine. Draco acquiesces at last for a dance with Harry, when the room is dark and lit only by dusk and a little lamp, and they hardly move anyway, just hold each other and stand in the middle of the room. Harry can hear the distant noises of others drifting through the home. Hermione and Ginny are in the sitting room, by the warm fire, reminiscing about old times, their voices rising and falling. Ron and Matthew are washing the dishes in the kitchen; Matthew is sagely passing along parenting advice to a mildly nervous Ron. Harry can hear the clink of dishes and the murmur of their voices. Astoria is coming down the hallway, humming to the music, having just finished Sophie’s bedtime stories.
“Would you two stop bickering for a moment? It's far too early,” Hermione murmured as they walked on farther, coming to the Great Hall and settling down at their table.
to exist, stating that those who knew the whereabouts of felons — but didn't report them straight away — could be arrested for hindering prosecution. But the law has long since been abolished."
or something similar.
They had been young, drunk, hopelessly in love. There was that word again. Hopeless. Harry remembered it. It was just after the Battle, when everyone had been celebrating. Draco and Harry's eyes had met through Severus Snape's wineglass, and that was it. They started laughing like they'd never stop, at the whole damn world and its stupidity. They drank till they were laughing and crying and couldn't tell the difference. They raced along the Hogsmeade train tracks, singing and laughing. They lay in dewy grass and made up stories about the stars. Draco plucked a white rose of its petals, sending them into the sky, to make a new constellation, a galaxy of petals and pollen.
“Quiet,” Hermione says distractedly, and Harry, unable to stand still, jumps to his feet and begins pacing endlessly. For the next few minutes, all he can hear is his own footsteps and the occasional turn of a page. “I remember now,” Hermione murmurs. “Let’s see...it really represents a form of phase space, that’s the key...the three rules...do not interfere with the nature of causality...” She looks up at Harry, her eyes bright.
"Good." Still looking far too amused about something, Ron leaves, narrowly missing a dropping from one of the owls.
To his surprise, Ron came down the stairs, looking at Draco searchingly. His clear blue eyes seemed to scan Draco's face, a search for emotion. Draco felt nothing but fear and worry and something worse, something shadowy and ominous.
Once Draco's gone, Harry turns his attention to the copy of
"Don't get ahead of yourself, mate. You still can't focus on using the indicator without taking your foot off the accelerator."
And he'll do anything to stop Draco from disappearing into that blue aether.
Light footsteps in a field. Arms wrapping briefly around him.
Harry gathers his cloak around himself and hums as he idly digs in the wet sand.
The first night he moves back into the apartment, he stands by the kitchen counter and remembers how Draco stood there once, the small Christmas tree casting light over his face.
"I'll give you the memory," she says at last. "If only because, for a moment, I thought it was Draco returning tonight, when I saw that car. And you gave me that one moment, if nothing else, so I'll give you the memory."
Harry had reacted so slowly, taken so much time to realise what was happening. He had fallen, landed on his knees, he knew it must have hurt but it was nothing, nothing compared to the pain of Draco Malfoy, screaming and twisting far above him in the sky, a sick mockery.
"No."
Narcissa shakes her head.
All rivers lead to the sea.
"I never told you," she says, her voice low and hoarse. "I never said how grateful I was, that day you made me go and say my father's eulogy."
lucky number among wizards and witches, Harry. Molly has her heart set on another wedding, she's already designing invitations — "
"Do you remember the battle?"
It was dark still and nobody was around. He wanted to sit there to see what it was like to be a Ravenclaw. The table felt different and he was right next to the staff tables now, close enough to see the engravings on the seats, the woodgrain in the table. If he glanced out the window he could see the lake stretching away. He was not used to windows. He settled down and had a piece of toast. Ravenclaws would eat toast.
"In Ron's study. He uses it for work."
“Yes. When we were eleven.”
People still followed him around, still stared and whispered, but people had always done that. He didn’t know why they had to be in so much awe all the time. All he’d done really, when it came down to it, was pretend to be dead. He didn’t see where that ranked in the list of top heroics, and (thank Merlin) Hermione and Ron saw this too (or at least, pretended to). In any case, he appreciated them more than ever.
"You want me to contact anyone?" Harry says instead, and Draco shakes his head.
smiles.
Ron laughs so hard he nearly chokes on his toffee. "Course not. But I suppose that tells me everything I need to know. Bloody obvious, really. Malfoy turns up at your place, you decide to go on road trips together — "
In Potions he willed his hands to be still.
Friend. Not quite the right word. They were never friends. They went from strangers straight to enemies, and then nothing but an insignificant memory, a distant figure easily dismissed and forgotten. Then...
Draco walked easier.
* * *
“Alright?”
"Can't you do it for me?" Astoria turns away from him, her mouth trembling. "Merlin, I can't cry. If I cry now, I won't be able to go back in."
"Anywhere."
Half an hour later, they're slowly walking back to the Renault together. Harry can feel his pulse slowing, like a car engine cooling, and his breathing becoming slow and even again.
“I heard he tortured someone to death...”
Harry doesn't point out that it's work-related. He listens as she speaks of the upcoming season, her guesses at how the season will finish, and a light criticism of the performance of her favourite team, the Kenmare Kestrels.
"That was a dream. This is a dream too."
"Evenin', Pickerill," Hagrid says, nodding at a man carrying an oak barrel over one shoulder.
Harry read it later. He’d seen Draco rushing along to the owlery between classes, seen the letter slip from his pocket.
"Narcissa and I got into an argument. Draco still looked terrible and I said he should at least stay for another day. But Narcissa was insistent that he return to the manor and kept going on about quality of care." Astoria exhales sharply. "Honestly, she can be so
— and then the emotions, all the anger and confusion and rage die away along with the war, and Lucius has gone and Narcissa says they’ll join him soon, but he can’t go away. If he runs away, he’ll be just like his father, and isn’t that a cruel irony when he spent half his life wanting to grow up
"Leave him alone," Matthew says amiably. "You only tried to drive once, and you went straight into the ornamental pond and shouted at me for twenty minutes afterwards."
“I'm sorry, I know it's late, and I didn't know who else to turn to — ” Draco began, his throat painful with suppressed fear.
Yes, Harry thinks. Draco is getting better.
A lone car appears in the distance. Harry watches the headlights rush past. His watch beeps — nine o'clock — and he notices the fuel gauge is nearing reserve. He pulls into the next petrol station and Draco wakes momentarily.
Maybe home isn't a place.
Harry stares at him, not sure if he's joking. "Yes?" he ventures.
Harry stares at the page for a long time.
Harry points his wand at the soft, rain-damp earth. Deep down — even though he owled ahead and received express permission from McGonagall — he's still half-expecting her to come storming across the grounds and dock twenty points from Gryffindor for vandalising the Quidditch pitch. But there's nobody here — just him and Hagrid, in the last rays of the evening light — and Harry takes a breath.
Slughorn was the last to take him aside.
They drive on and on.
"I'm investigating your case," Harry says, raising his voice over the roar of the waves. The edge of the cliff is beginning to crumble into the sea and he stumbles backwards. "I'm trying to find you. Where are you? If this is real, tell me!"
"We cannot accept," Malfoy says, "what we do not choose."
"Notice what?" Ginny asks, pausing in her folding.
Draco glances out the window, watching the scenery flash past.
Well, perhaps Draco's just
"And what? He just left?" Harry says, stumbling over the words slightly. He repeats them again, his voice stronger. "He just left."
"We'll be finishing the borough preliminaries soon," Ginny says, breaking the silence.
"Certainly." Harry picks up the photograph to return to her, but Narcissa shakes her head.
Harry reaches out, and for a moment he can almost feel the canola flowers feathering his fingers, the stars on his skin, a hand slipping through his.
"Can I keep working in the Investigative Division?" Harry asks suddenly, and Williamson pauses mid-sentence to give him a startled look.
he murmured and the quill mended, the two halves coming together instantly. He set it down carefully upon a desk. He went over to another fallen desk, repairing a splintered chair with a wave of his wand. As he pulled the desk upright something clinked gently across its surface, then rolled across the floor with the smallest of noises.
"I could try one of the main roads," Harry says excitedly.
Harry wasn't away for long, but for some reason he has trouble remembering where everything is. Was the sugar kept on the second or third shelf? He opens a cupboard to fetch mugs, but it turns out to be full of glasses. He may as well be in the house of a stranger. While they're waiting for the kettle to boil, Draco takes a seat at the island counter and trails a hand along the edge of it.
"I've never been to a national park before," Harry says, wondering how old the trees are. He heard once that oak trees could live for two thousand years. "I bet there aren't any as good as Snowdonia, though."
“You must practise.”
Harry didn’t come to breakfast.
“He didn't feel anything, that's the whole problem. Whereas we — we — ”
"Did Draco say anything?" Harry demands. Draco had never spoken of his three-year ordeal and Harry had left it alone — but all this time, if all Harry had to do was
“Fine.” Harry hesitates. “What about...Severus?”
* * *
But the cold breeze had come up once more. Draco watched them from the castle. The wind picked up hats and played with them, tossed cloaks like toys, sent ribbons and loose parchment spiraling. A lone quill dipped and skimmed across the lake as if writing in the water.
, Harry wants to say, but Draco can't hear him. He's not here.
"Yes," Hermione says, "you do that. And come and tell us
* * *
, Ron had said once, and Harry had laughed. Seeing Draco Malfoy apologise, they had agreed, would be one of the most victorious moments in their lives.
"Let's go to the Shrieking Shack — I heard it's haunted!" a student says to their friend as they pass by.
"She used this amazing hex to catch McGregor, it was brilliant, but it was nowhere
. Harry unties the rope; a set of beady eyes open but soon flutter shut again when Harry runs a finger along the spine. After waiting a moment to ensure the book is settled, he begins flipping through the pages. He's certain Draco would never have bothered with this book —
"Fantastic." Harry returns Ron's grin, but after a long moment his smile slowly fades. "We were going places back then. Turned the whole department on its head. Changed all the training policies, got rid of all the corruption, created specialty areas."
Harry looked up at Ron for a long time.
, their unspoken pleas said.
"Is that what you do?"
Draco nods. Harry pauses for a moment, then shuts the door and turns off the kitchen lights before going to bed.
"I'll think about it."
Learning to drive, he thinks, is extraordinarily stress-inducing.
"You know what," Matthew says, "I think you're nearly ready for the practical."
"Well," Draco says, taking his Renault keycard from his pocket. "I'd better be going."
He opens the driver’s door and sits down, glancing into the rearview mirror. He can see himself, but at the same time it’s not him. For a moment, his green eyes fade to grey.
“No. Not today.”
"You left. Do you have any idea — " Harry quickly cuts himself off, aware of the tremor beneath his voice. He's horrified at the idea of losing composure now and he strides to the bedside table, searching blindly for the keycard, something — anything — to focus on —
"Tonight? We close in an hour."
"This isn't a pensieve memory," Harry says slowly. He expects to be ignored, but he's startled when Draco turns to look at him.
“I’ve got something for you.” Draco looks away. “A memory. But it will cost a lot to give you.”
But a good story is a good story.
try shoving your way into someone's mind. Anyway, Legilimency can do a lot of things, but it can't make someone appear — "
: on a page about the uses of beetle legs, Draco has written
“You remembered that?”
Harry can't remember where he heard that.
"I'll be leaving tonight though, so we can practice all tomorrow on the Margate pitch." She grabs a practice Quaffle and shoves it into the bag. "Oh, how'd your case go?"
He tightens his grip around Draco's hand as they stand together to watch the storm roll in.
At first, he's still angry and begins mentally preparing the long rant he plans to deliver upon Draco's return.
"We could go anywhere."
The field stretches out before him, dark as a pot of spilled ink. But he knows this place.
He stands and walks out to the car, the gravel crunching under his feet. He touches a hand to the chilly handle and pulls the car door open, then slides into the driver's seat and rests his hands on the wheel.
“Gay or not, he’s worth at least ten of you. Not to mention, his wristwatch alone could buy your house, and probably Dudley as well. The way I see it, I’m moving up.”
Lucius curled his lip. “Yes, Draco. Your mother and I, and the entirety of Wizarding Britain, are well aware of your
“Not ‘Potter.’ It’s...we don’t need that, on top of it.”
Tom blinked away the observation and moved forward. “Why did you lie to me, Draco?”
Draco smiled slightly. “I suppose it’s a bit of a silly name, if you don’t have the associations most wizards do with it.”
“Fuck,” said Draco. “I can’t believe I’m committing corporate espionage against my own father.”
“Right.” Sirius sat down heavily. Then stood back up. “Tea?”
“Didn’t hear you get up,” he croaked.
Draco sighed. “Well, I’m headed to Nina’s for a nibble, if you’d like to meet me there.”
“Turn it off,” said Sirius. “I’ll show you.”
“Your human is a fucking trainwreck,” he said.
“I really
“I’ll thank you not to bring my private life into this,” said Lord Malfoy.
Christ!” she exclaimed after drinking her own measure. “My throat is on fucking fire!”
Thanks for your continued support!  I've had some lovely comments and I really appreciate all of you.  Really, it means a lot to me.  Things are going well, the next chapter is started, and posting should be a bit more regular going forward.
“You may approach,” said Voldemort.
“Oh yeah,” said Ron. “Me too, mate.”
Harry handed him his drink with a fondly exasperated look.
“I asked you your favorite color and you responded by mocking my wardrobe.”
justice first. then dinner.
“They have their uses.”
“Clueless,” Harry mumbled with a vague smile.
“Stop what?”
And from there, the evening roared on in a mess of food, drinks, congratulations, and interrogations. By the time dessert came, George had set off a few trick fireworks indoors, and Draco was attempting to drag himself back into the dining room with Victoire and little Molly, Percy’s eldest, clinging to each leg.
Hermione chuckled and spoke entirely to herself.
There was a tense pause.
vocation.”
“Yes, Draco.”
side, weren’t you?” Harry realized suddenly. “This Voldemort? You talk like a friend of ours, Davy, who used to be a skinhead. He still says really shitty things sometimes when he’s not watching himself.”
“Then why is it only working on Amy?”
“I couldn’t breathe,” Ron said. “I hurt for you, and I was happy for you, but I was so
“Goblins?” she asked.
“Doesn’t it bother you?” Ginny asked at length.
He was going to have to find the lab.
“We texted,” said Ginny.
Harry gulped. “Oh. Did I?”
“I think you mean the future Mr. Malfoy. Er, I mean, that is to say, the future
“What?” Harry snapped.
“Yes.”
“Are we going to ride this train back to Scotland, or do we have a chance of seeing our families today?” asked Rose irritably.
Ron sat down across from him with two fresh beers, and slid one over to Harry in spite of his full firewhiskey.
“Well,” said Tom lightly, “regardless, I can’t stand by and watch you destroy the place like this.” He walked to the coatrack, took down his coat, slung it over his shoulder. Then, in a deliberately dramatic gesture, he glanced back over his shoulder and said, “Are you sure you don’t want a quick fuck before I go?”
“Purebloods are no strangers to incest,” Scorpius finished.
Well, Tom probably had no intention of leaving the safety of his kitchen until Draco had cleared out of the apartment. With a resigned sigh, Draco quietly took the locket off the wall and opened it. Inside, cut into an oval, was an old photograph of a dark-haired man resting his chin on top of a red-haired woman’s head, looking fondly down at her while she smiled at the camera. Her eyes were the same startling green as Harry’s, but the rest of Harry’s looks were all his father’s, excepting that Harry’s father appeared to have been much taller than Harry would ever be. Tom would probably burn this if he found it. The spiteful bastard, thought Draco fondly. Well, it was a good shot, no need for it to go to waste. Draco slipped the picture into his wallet, then closed the locket and hung it up again.
," he says urgently, "don't answer — "
That night, he stands on the little balcony and rests his hands on the wrought-iron railing, just to feel something solid. As if he's trying to ground himself, as if electricity is pouring through him.
Will he ever come back?
He reads it again and again. It's nothing. A polite thank you, a polite goodbye. A commendation, like Harry did all this for a pat on the head and a compliment. He feels nauseous, but after the queasiness recedes he begins to feel angry. Angry that nobody's told him anything, angry that Narcissa so clearly considers him to be of such little personal importance. She hadn't even mentioned Draco, where he was or if he was all right.
Harry's not sure what he should make of it.
He jumped.
Harry shakes his head, still laughing. "It's like you know me."
"Why?"
"I — " Draco says, but his voice wavers on the air like someone plucking a metal wire and the noise seems to wrap around Harry's mind, cutting into it, and he knows something is terribly wrong.
There's a long silence.
He returns slowly to his office.
"No." He takes a dreamless sleep potion from the cabinet and shuts it.
Harry shrugs. "To be honest, I always pictured his wife to be a female version of him." He says it as a joke, to try and put Astoria at ease again, but she doesn't smile.
Harry heads straight for the atrium.
But beneath the tie, he discovers, is a small white jewellery box. More cufflinks? He snaps it open.
She nodded. He turned and strode through the wall.
"Good enough to brew, for example, Veritaserum?"
Sometimes it's impossible, Harry tells himself. Some dreams are just...unachievable.
"Someone who likes driving too? Someone who takes the scenic routes?" Harry smiles. "I went to Cornwall. Tracing Draco's last journey. Have you ever seen the southernmost point of the British mainland?"
When Harry wakes next, it's dark. Completely dark. Even when they were driving through the countryside of Wiltshire, it wasn't dark like this. Not a single light, not even the distant glow of a house.
She looks at him, then glances down at her hands as if the answer is written there.
He follows her into the kitchen, illuminated by bright sunlight. The Wizarding Wireless on the counter is playing a cheerful song; teamed with the pleasant aroma of baked sweets and the uncaring mess of the kitchen — flour spilt across the counter, a cluster of butter-smeared measuring spoons — Harry feels a little more relaxed.
* * *
Harry bites down a response and stands up. "I'll see you Monday," he says, and they all nod and awkwardly farewell him.
He woke and splayed his hands flat against his mattress to stop them trembling.
"We could go anywhere," Harry says quietly.
Ginny's gone to Quidditch practice.
“Did the Grimwright raid today, then?” he asks, switching topics.
“No.” The word is out before Harry can stop it.
"Congratulations, Ginny," he says. "I'm sorry I couldn't make the game."
The fifth of June...the day Draco arrived on his doorstep, tossed his cloak casually across the kitchen counter, and said
"Then what?" Hermione presses.
“Hello.” Harry closes his eyes against the white sky, feeling the warmth of Draco against him. After a moment, Draco loops his arms around Harry’s waist, pulling him back gently into an embrace.“Did you find what you were looking for?”
"Don't," he says urgently, braking hard and pulling onto the shoulder of the road, "don't do it, it's not worth it —
“Professor McGonagall’s coming!” shouted Ron, and the crowd looked around nervously, dispersing, wandering their separate ways, brushing past Draco roughly and sending him stumbling against the stone wall.
* * *
Astoria sets the cup of tea in front of Harry, then moves to sit opposite him. "You must have made quite an impression. Narcissa seems to trust you, and she does not trust readily."
He turns a corner. The lights are petering out now. Turns another corner. Now there is nothing but darkness and the stars. The fields, right there, and it brings back all those summer memories, all those times spent driving, driving, and the canola flowers set heart-stoppingly bright against a sky the colour of a propane flame.
“You did?”
, Harry wants to say.
Draco leaves the room, taking his wand with him. He has a way of using his fingertips to catch the wand and flick it into his sleeve, where it stays as if adhering to the material. It's a very neat trick, Harry thinks, and seems even quicker than the method the Aurors were taught.
He frowns. “But— in honour of — ”
“I know. I'm sorry,” Hermione said, drying her eyes on the pillowcase. “Do — d'you want to visit Harry's grave tomorrow? It's been nearly a year since the accident.”
“You don’t know Draco,” Astoria says suddenly. “You don’t know what he was going to do.”
He stared at Harry. He was still holding the spoon in an oddly absent-minded manner.
“That’s why everyone in the Wizarding world knows your name, even though they believe you died as an infant. The Dark Lord killed your parents, and then, when he apparently killed you, it backfired somehow. He lost his powers, almost died. Disappeared completely for a decade or so. Because you were, apparently, the last one he turned his wand on, you were celebrated the world over for defeating the Dark Lord. The Boy Martyr, they call you. People wear lockets with your picture in them, Harry.”
“No,” Harry agreed, “you’re probably right. But I wouldn’t have walked in alone.” He caught Tom’s eye. “Stupid of me. I should have woken Draco.”
this Dumbledore?” Harry asked, interrupting Arthur’s spluttering.
His father just raised one eyebrow.
HP: aztec mocha
“I wish you wouldn’t call me ‘my dear.’ Sounds sort of—” Draco cut Harry off with a kiss before he could finish that thought.
“Right. I was--apologizing.”
“It’s the only copy.”
“That’s not fair,” Harry growled. “What was I supposed to do, with you standing so close and speaking in my ear? If I short-circuited and blurted something stupid out, you can’t blame me.”
“We’re in the Paris Catacombs,” Draco explained as gently as he could manage. “There’s a back entrance to the French branch of Gringotts through here.” Both Muggles stared at him blankly, so Draco sighed and added, “Wizard bank.”
“Well, I am sorry about that.”
“None of this, now. We’ve all grown. This is more important than anything that happened in school.”
There was a snicker from the hallway. Both men looked up to find Lily watching them.
. A simple little strategy. Necessary contact, for the sake of reality. That's all.
He snapped around, distracted by the sight of the students scuttling away and sneering over their shoulders at him.
"It's not that bad," Harry says. "I mean, Ginny's not devastated or anything, it was really quite mutual —"
Harry lets the shopkeeper chatter on as he leads Harry over to the back corner of the shop. The owls are roosting along the wooden beams, blinking sleepily as Harry walks beneath them.
"Maybe," Ron says, "you should take a bit of a break, Harry."
"Nothing. Everything seems to go in circles."
“Why?” he says.
"Forget your obligations."
"He woke up last night, around nine o'clock. Went to sleep again, but they said it was a natural sleep this time. He woke up at around six this morning and stayed awake."
Ron frowns. "Come on, mate. Something's going on, we're not stupid. Why'd you leave?"
Hermione.
The whispers followed him but more reluctantly now. Draco kept walking, forcing himself not to slink against the wall like a mouse skulking from a predator, a fox waiting for the hunting rifle.
* * *
And Draco's wand.
The right door was always open for Harry.
Harry laughs. "Long story. I was in some old stables."
"I know." Harry looks away.
Just over a month since Malfoy went missing. He turns to gaze at Astoria. She's still sitting on the edge of the bed, her wedding ring in one hand, crying silently. He feels slightly uncomfortable with the memory and wonders why Astoria gave him such a personal scene. Then she speaks, and for a moment Harry thinks she's speaking to him. But she seems to be addressing nothing more than air.
It's going to be a long day.
"Look...in a few seconds, he'll glance at his hand...I can't believe I didn't notice it earlier! Any moment..."
After he parks the car, they go inside and sit in front of the roaring fire. Matthew asks a few questions about billywigs but he seems to pick up on Harry's mood and draws the conversation to a close. Harry knows, distantly, that he's being a bad guest — darkly contemplative and distant — but he can't bring himself to feign smiles and easy chatter. Draco could be dead. Drowned, three years ago, before Harry even saw the first memory, before he even wrote
"Quit chatting and get in the car already," Astoria says impatiently. "I want to see how badly Harry screws up."
The words roll across Harry's mind like waves breaking. He blinks, his smile fading, and begins reading again.
"Oh, that wasn't a criticism!" Ginny says quickly. "I was just saying, that's all. I don't think the Minister himself could afford
He wonders who he'd go back for.
“We could sneak in there,” Harry says. “The key’s under the mat.”
“If they were too weak to fight, they were too weak to produce this spell. They would have been strong, healthy, their mind clear,” Harry said.
"No," he says. "I mean, it's not any of my business, is it?"
Outside, in the streets below, someone is whistling again.
Strange, how Draco brought him to Hogwarts. Brought him home, in a way.
As soon as Harry enters his office, he goes straight for the file in his desk and opens it up. The photograph of Draco that Narcissa gave Harry so many months ago. Draco stares at Harry, his mouth small and serious, his eyes unblinking. The silver snitch clasp is neatly pinned to his robes.
“I am afraid I wouldn’t fit in the school, I, um, I almost seventeen after all and I don’t know any magic”. Harry looked back down, at his cup of cold tea and kept his gaze there.
Fred might be waking up after all. Good.
“Then don’t” said Oliver cheerfully. Oliver was very understanding and very handsome and Percy liked him a lot. “Besides, I am sure if you wait a week they will come with a better offer. Secretary of something at the very least.”
The headboard sprouted an engraved geometric pattern. Intertwined lines that made like the shine of a crystal or the rays of the sun across a window. Harry let Draco think it had been him, because it did kind of looked more like his style, and he had been so smug about it.
“It sounds as if you did very well,” Draco said slowly. “Even captured a wand.”
Now, the Malfoys couldn’t have someone call Draco a liar or a blood traitor, no matter the awful precedents set by the Black side. Aunt Bella narrowed her eyes and sent a new cruciatus curse… to Nott. He sidestepped it easily and the curse hit the wall, making a crack and leaving a burn mark.
“He was hideously ugly, the second time,” Draco said, stressing the “hideous” to make justice to the horror of that bald nose-less head with red eyes.
Harry just brought Aeneas forward. The owl jumped onto the secretaire and offered his leg while looking at Harry for approval.
“He takes his godfather duties very seriously, Ron. Now, try not to piss on today’s peace.”
“You have each other’s trauma,” Harry announced. “You are each dreaming something related to the other’s death.”
Fred was nodding as if that made perfect sense, because he and George used to go to the muggle village near the Burrow. It didn’t account for something, though.
There was the question about what might have happened at Luna’s place. Someone might have tried to get rid of her before sending her copy to Harry, someone might have done some damage while looking for her there. She had animals there! Aeneas should be there now.
No, water-dogs didn’t get a sausage for themselves. Oh, all right, there was a griffin bone somewhere. Fenton could have that.
He thought that Draco was a whore and he was courting Draco all the same.
So Percy had to be very careful with all he did. Since Harry also drew a lot of unwanted attention it made sense to fight it together, or at least suffer it together.
They were cut out from the door and the windows were too high to climb, especially with a Harry that could barely stand. The red sparks of a curse hit the floor by Draco’s feet and he knew they had to move, get away from their line of sight.
(pop)
“It’s like my mother was only there to give birth to me, pass me her eyes and die,” added Harry since they were talking about it. “Like I got nothing else from her. No virtue or vice.”
Draco left after dinner to take Fenton on a walk, instructing them not to open the door to anyone until he and Fenton returned. Harry watched them go from the dining room windows, Fenton trotting happy and elegantly and Draco following him with a brisk step. The line of his back was very nice.
The Dark Lord had only inspired him revulsion. Now Draco learned true hate.
There had been others. Wizards claimed to have long memories but they could be remarkable forgetful when it suited them. Before Gellert Grindelwald there had been Apollina Giraud, from Belgium, and Archibald Forge-Kaylock once again in England. Apollina had been furious when a daring black woman had called her a
Sirius stayed by his side, taking deep careful breaths while Remus filled the thermos with tea. At Remus’ indication he took down three, actually make it four, new mugs. The price for coming was knowing you had to. Sirius had just earned it.
Harry hesitated. “Those were bad years. I’d rather not talk about that”.
“All right. Hold on a second,” Harry said as he opened his jacket and shirt to expose a little of his chest. Bleeding his hand would be easier and quicker but hands were sensitive, full of nerves and needed in combat. Harry much preferred making a small nick on his chest and taking the blood from there.
Shannon? He didn’t think that there was any religious hero called that. He remembered being shocked that someone might want to kill people so badly that they would be willing to die with them. How innocent of him.
is what Auror Shacklebot had told her when it was decided she would be the one to talk to them. They were almost certain that at least one if not both of the Malfoys had participated in the attack at the Ministry. Although of course they were masters at squirrelling, or rather
Silly things that Harry had heard plenty of times.
There was just a small and dirty window on the service door and Draco had peered through it and seen nothing even as he felt the wooden door shaking under him and could hear the strain of the rusted hinges under Fenton’s barks. There had been something pushing against that door, trying to force it open. Draco repeated it three or four times. There had been something prying the door open.
Severus: No. I never liked the beach and I get sunburned, you know this.
“I am sure she is perfectly nice” Harry went on. And why did he do this to himself? No, no, that wasn’t right. Jealousy, I know you when I see you, let go of my guts and chest. Draco is free to make his own friends, even if they have very questionable taste in lifestyle and they are stupid and smell bad and probably drink spinach juice or something like that.
“I am not sure about Hogwarts,” Harry said. “I won’t be able to keep it secret, even if I ask McGonagall to be discreet. There are far too many people.”
“Oh, you witch!” exclaimed Suruchi, unsure whether she should be irritated or amused.
they arrested her. They had heard her screamed confession, full of insults and curses, while they moved her to the holding cells in the Ministry.
It was the worst sound Draco had heard in his life. Not the satisfaction coming from the deatheaters, the sights of pleasure of aunt Bella, not even the screams of pain as Mort writhed on the floor and cried like Draco had never heard before.
Yes. The doors of Gringotts were perfectly well and they were the one and only entrance to the bank. So, really, there was no reason to believe that there had been a bank robbery. If you also believed that goblins were honest about their dealings and that they wouldn’t hide such a thing to protect their reputation then this was nothing more than a peculiar protest for their outrageous interest rates or the commission on pounds conversion.
Ron’s pillow also had a new pillowcase in a dark navy colour he had chosen himself. Chosen. It was dizzying not having everything be second-hand. Things felt taste-less and odour-less. They were also very bright and full of colour.
(So basically Percy only respects Aberforth Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall).
He walked down the tunnels and into the lowest levels accompanied by the playful notes of the strings. This was probably why the shadows casted by the few and far in between lights of the tunnels acted weird, jumping and dancing so that Harry would always be hidden by them. Unseen, like a naughty spirit or like the mischievous fairies of theatre, he crossed door after door and barrier after barrier until he got to the first dragon.
“You can ask me anything you want about girls.”
He sat next to Fred and lightly touched his arm hoping that would be enough to comfort him and dispel the nightmare without waking him. They slept a lot but rarely got a good uninterrupted sleep so Harry was hesitant to wake them. Fred flinched at his touch and cried something that could be a whimper or a wail.
Everything hurt.
Kreacher was dead and nothing could be done.
She was now putting her little hands on the handle of a sword and trying to pull herself up, like a gymnast. Just a sword, its blade half way buried on the ground.
She didn’t do any of that. In fact, Minerva found herself going to buy a new dress only to change her mind midway and getting a blouse with a huge ribbon on the neck and a pair of green trousers. She also went to the hairdresser. She even painted her nails in a nice and soft shade of pink.
“Move his head carefully,” Harry instructed. “To the side.”
And yet people barely spoke of his wife. Nobody seemed to realize she was the terrible one.
, all the way down to his fingernails and all the way up to his teeth. His arm jolted and despite himself Harry lost his grip and let her go. The pain was short-lived as numbness quickly took over his arm. He couldn’t move it and he could hardly feel it, as if it had been severed from his body.
Oh, yes, she would keep them updated. She would love to do that. She would do whatever they wished.
“No one should have to brave those people on an empty stomach”
Well, yes. Someone who could create and control a
So Harry it was. They could make better memories for the name.
He could make out some words between the chaos and the screams. Someone had casted
Draco might had cried when she explained it.
“I can fix it, if you want,” added George, and Harry gave him a look that he knew was startled and disquieting, but he couldn’t help it. George had that strained look for when he was actively trying not to think of Fred.
“Exactly!” Harry answered with exaggerated excitement. “You have to agree I am much less of a pest now.”
Imagine the days when all you experience is power. When every heart beat pumps through your veins pure magic mixed with blood. When all you know is victory. Over other wizards, over the laws of magic, over life and death.
Fred looked less pleased than usual when they mentioned his family. He looked at Regulus and didn’t take his eyes off him. Harry had seen than expression before. On Ron but also on Fred and George and Ginny. Fred was thinking of dying Regulus’ black hair red and passing him off as a cousin.
It’s not that Draco didn’t care about his family reputation, he did, he understood that reputation and standing meant almost everything; but right now he was more concerned with getting to Mort, who was still lying on the floor. His eyes weren’t open, but at least his chest kept moving. He hadn’t even taken a full step before his father’s hand over his shoulder squeezed meaningfully.
Aeneas shook his shoulders, which was always fun to see an owl do.
It should have been fine, the old school friends reunited at last. However, it was in fact terribly tense and awkward. Sirius had paid a big toll in Azkaban and he was just starting to get his life and humanity back. He still hadn’t properly mourned James and Lily, and he was hung on Peter’s betrayal and on everyone thinking it had been him.
, please?)
“Yes, well.” Grumbled Godric Gryffindor “What about
Draco is a charming bo-. Draco is charming; boy, child or adult trapped in a kid’s body. He gets an invitation and a layout of the Longbottom’s house. Narcissa then dons a pair of sensible country boots that she doesn’t mind getting dirty with mud and barely sleeps for the next ten days. Her skin suffers from it greatly, mind you.
to anyone. Later on when Harry had been working, he had been
“Take as long as you need,” Harry said, understanding. “Do you have your wand?”
How long? How long to hear Harry and get up and grab the wands and drag themselves there?
The third owl returned thirteen days later, tired and irritated and covered in smog.
He looked at Fenton. The dog had his mouth open in a grin and was still wagging his tail.
Even now that Percy has received letters from every family member (including Freaking Aunt Muriel) and even a surprise visit from them (he has a life debt with Charlie for the heads-up) and they have begun the unpleasant work of fixing their relationship; even
“Do you want some gin?” whispered Harry, pointing at the bottles, before Malfoy left. “Take as many as you want, please. We are not going to use them.”
“Look, it’s as we often say, Green” Venus continued in between sips of her soup. They would talk to him for as long as the food lasted. “You have to know what you are and where you are. Nobody pays hundreds to a street whore. If they offer you that much, they don’t intend to pay”.
So then Draco went near the rubbish bins and threw three small Coca-cola bottles with a mentos inside. He ran away without looking back and Harry took the opportunity to sneak through the ring and take the trunk from behind the distracted wizards who had never seen anything quite like that outside of a potions classroom. The homeless man was making a big scene, free of charge, so that gave him ten additional seconds.
It had been a terribly bizarre experience, new things in the Weasley household. The twins said that they had made quite a lot of money before they had to go into hiding so it was no trouble paying for the house to be rebuilt. Just as Percy said he had barely touched his handsome Junior Assistant to the Minister’s stipend and he could get them the furniture. Still, Ron had made some quick mental calculations and realized there were still almost five hundred galleons unaccounted for. Charlie admitted to having provided one hundred and fifty from his savings, Bill about the same amount. After some more prodding Bill also admitted that maybe some of Ron’s friends had quite literally thrown a velvet bag full of galleons to Bill’s face. (Fleur was kind enough to point the exact place where the bag hit him).
not only pays for itself, it also generates enough benefits that Draco can open
he screamed. Harry thought that it was more rage, and perhaps fear, than actual pain.
Harry was fast. His left arm shot out and he grabbed not-Luna by the throat. He pushed a bit forward so she would be off balance, on the edge of the doorstep.
He fell asleep with all those thoughts in his head. He woke up in the middle of the night, however, with one single thought in mind. Maybe not even a thought, just the urgency and desire in his cock begging for attention. An insistent burn that took over everything else and wouldn’t go away.
It sucked, though. Just as this feeling of loneliness, of being all by himself in a crowded world sucked. This feeling like being naked and wet and cold and having the people around him press him down to the floor and suffocate him while at the same time ignoring his nakedness, his coldness, his awful vulnerability.
“This is very surprising,” Ron went on, looking at both Regulus and Harry. Regulus grinned at him and clasped his hands together. As gestures of reassurance went, it was odd and old-fashioned, as if Regulus had lots of feelings but little practice. Ron blinked slowly and visibly decided not to comment or dwell on it. “But I just don’t see what it has to do with us, George in particular, and why it is so urgent. How can we help?”
Draco wasn’t sure where to look, that was obvious. His eyes were looking at Harry’s bare neck one second and at the waves far away the next before coming to rest to the big crashing waves surrounding them.
Overall it took a bit more than an hour, but they got the house nice and clean. Absolutely no trace of paint left behind.
Almost right away, as if he were jealous or as if an evil spirit were playing with them, Regulus got up from his sofa, took two steps and fell to his knees. He left a trail of blood behind him. He got on his hands and knees although his left arm could barely support him. Harry had to grab him by the chest to keep him upright as Regulus began to cough and hack and vomit blood, dark and almost black. It was coming from his mouth and nose and ears and he could barely breathe.
And Hogwarts still doesn’t know how to keep children in bed.
One wave with his left hand and the walls of the living room had vanished, the room opening to a dark forest full of thorns. Harry supposed he ought to find the image terrifying and it certainly was disquieting, but it wasn’t much worse than the Forbidden Forest.
In any case. One should get a gift that the person wouldn’t get for himself. Granger agrees.
He suddenly lifted his eyes and stared at Harry intently as if he expected to see a lie written in his face. Then he looked back down and carefully took the wand from Harry’s hands. He turned it this way and the other and flicked it, murmured a few words and levitated a piece of paper off the counter.
If he had learned something from his unconventional upbringing, it was how to go and make a good life.
All their symptoms had disappeared. Harry didn’t know when, exactly; if it was at the beginning of the fight, or during, or after. All he knew was that he had come home to the three of them bruised and injured, but there had been no more seizures, no bleeding, no vomiting, no fever. Fred had his hearing back. Regulus was using the left side of his body without trouble.
Remus was standing in a corner of the room, having offered his seat early on during the meeting. All the couches and chairs were taken, and some of the younger members, like the older Weasley kids, were sitting on the floor. So it was easy to leave the room discretely five minutes after having heard of Draco’s Malfoy involvement. They had made so much out of everything else, his name hadn’t come up sooner.
But with the thought of seeing Gellert, came another one. If he could see someone who wasn’t part of his family, maybe he would be able to see others too. Dumbledore was a very brave and very wise man, but most important he was old. There had been many deaths through his life and even griffindor courage can desert you when what you have to face is not danger but reproach.
Again another look. This time Draco wasn’t able to completely hide that he was impressed.
did escape him. He made valiant efforts that it would do so every day.
Draco was waiting for them outside, holding two backpacks and their brooms. He kissed Harry softly on the lips and helped him open the collars. The dragons whined as some scabs opened and bled which had a lot to do with how and why the chains were found in the morning.
The interested party got closer to the house. It stopped on the sidewalk on the line that separated the sphere of the house from the street. The line where the
fault not Harry’s. “But, believe me, I did what I thought was best at every stage. Also, there was a promise I had to keep.”
The list of symptoms had most of the times Regulus and Fred had woken up from a nightmare, but not all, and they had never written down the content of the nightmare because it wasn’t important. Except it was, it was.
Harry didn’t want to be there. He felt like he shouldn’t, but Ron hadn’t left him any option and took him (Regulus, too) to deliver the news to Mr and Mrs Weasley. Part of it was that they considered Harry a member of the family and Ron was showing him the best way he knew; part of it was that Harry’s approach had worked pretty well, much better than Ron’s who had gotten Percy upset long before he got him to Grimmauld Place.
It just… no. He couldn’t do it and neither could Regulus. Not now at least, not when they had just found him and Harry couldn’t stop thinking that he might have passed right by his side last night, right by his side and he didn’t see him.
and Draco was going to just
and then throwing the light away from him. He got it to bounce on the wall three times before it faded. Draco looked more impressed with the size and appearance of the cave than with the unusual magic trick Harry had just made. Then he looked around himself, found a spot that suited him, and sat down.
dancer.
Harry drove the stake deeper. He hoped to be done quickly but he knew that Quinn deserved a slow and painful death. For the cruelty. For the nightmares. He put all the strength of his back into his arm. Harry had a strong back and very nice arms.
You would think that all the problems would come from the house-elf rights, what with people relying on them for work and whatnot. And really, there is quite a lot of pressure against treating house-elves with the most basic decency. But, still.
But this was not the point. The point was that Harry could explain very well, had done so many times, and yet he found himself tongue-tied now.
Harry gave the note to Aeneas quickly and winced when the owl, in its excitement, bumped against the frame of the window and against a lamppost almost right away before taking flight and disappearing over the roofs of London.
This time, Draco learned that Mortim- oh, for Merlin’s sake,
(See the end of the chapter for
He lifted his right hand, fist closed around nothing. Harry still had his eyes closed so he couldn’t see that he didn’t have a wand there when he cast a fire spell.
, but also, once the trial was done, Harry had gone to Draco and sneakily returned his wand.
The house of Spinner’s End had never been pretty or happy, not even when it had just been built, but Harry didn’t know this. Harry still thought the best of everyone and waited to be proved wrong. Just as James had thought that everyone had a happy childhood and loving parents like him and it wasn’t until he got to know Sirius that he realized this wasn’t necessarily the norm.
, but Harry could justify it because Fantasy Draco didn’t mind and was, in fact, quite happy to participate. Thinking about the Real Draco, however, with his mysterious real life, and fantasising about all the dirty stuff Harry wanted to do was rude. An intromission in Draco’s private life.
When the twins are three, Draco launches
Bill Weasley regretted not carrying some muggle coins with him, as the young man had been quite charming. You had to value all that work with no wand or magic. He had also liked the multicolour hair, and he wondered how he would look like with a coloured strand on his long mane.
Harry grinned and because he had been there, bruised and hurt and in shock and with Voldemort dead, he said: “The first of many, so you can take it easy.”
“Some people have silver tongues,” said a voice that was itself like silver. “Some have flesh tongues, and then there is my dear Potter over there with his disaster tongue. It might be a curse.”
Still, Severus refused to say anything about yoga. However on his birthday Sirius surprised him with a nice long-sleeved black t-shirt that he could use for yoga while hiding his Death Eater tattoo. It had, of course, a lion print because Sirius was inexplicably convinced that he was a funny man.
I… I just want people to get eight decent hours of sleep. Sleep is good. Harry agrees.
After that Percy goes to the Caribbean, because he feels that his stress-relief and self-discovery journey should also involve a stay in a tropical beach. He doesn’t particularly enjoy the experience because he is a red-head. Also, sand is annoying. He freckles all over, eats a lot of pork, learns to play the maracas, to the locals’ amusement, and leaves.
“Incessantly.”
“Not in the least,” Harry agreed. “I thought maybe, if you didn’t notice anything weird, that would mean something.”
Draco was nodding his head. The day wasn’t very bright, dark grey clouds overhead had taken all the light so that it looked like Draco’s hair was the only source of light. “But you expect someone to come polyjuiced,” pointed Draco. “So if that person is half clever, they should pretend to have noticed that you are acting different.”
“It’s right over your heart, kid,” Regulus said in all seriousness, and frankly, who was he calling a kid? He was the younger one here.
(Ah, but Draco thinks that Ron and Harry are together. So of course he protects Ron.)
“By the way,” Draco said as Harry put the teapot on the tray. He was still soft and close and comfortable and he looked amazing in sleeping clothes. “Have you noticed that neither Fred nor Regulus have— ”
Now that there were two doors and a high number of stairs between Harry and the street he felt he could relax a little bit.
That was the most infuriating part. He did nothing. He didn’t cover the tattoo because Harry’s gaze bothered him, but he also didn’t expose it more so Harry could
The happiest person in that reunion wasn’t Tonks who was healthy and full of energy; nor was it Sirius who had been celebrating with old and new friends and family for twelve hours now. It wasn’t Teresa, loved by a man and his family, and it wasn’t Ted Tonks who still couldn’t believe he hadn’t had to pay a higher price to survive the war.
Next time he saw him, and Harry knew there would be a next time because Malfoy was
Magic and cunning and force, and nothing had worked. Someone had been reduced to stalking. Not even that, since then Someone had had other things to attend to.
“What is it to you?” answered Draco on his snottiest tone. If he was going to be talked to by muggles, maybe he should just man up and go home and confess.
(How had she ended as the mediwizard assigned to the Auror department? What happened? She had no idea of what happened.)
“Turnips first, then powder,” answered Fred. He was probably asleep.
Almost immediately, more wizards popped up on the street. Between obliviating muggles, exploding ballons, and figuring out what the other wizards were doing and who was the idiot who let that spell out, Harry and Draco had left the place, having transferred Draco’s possession to two old suitcases they had gotten for seven and half pounds at a Oxfam charity shop.
Harry’s plan was really good, he was sure of it, if only they would implement it.
Remus could get behind that feeling.
Hermione barges in their compartment in her usual way and they have to drop some very heavy hints to remind her they are not alone. They can’t spook Pettigrew.  Draco comes by, stares at Harry in silence for a whole minute and then passes him a note saying he can’t find the diary and also he ordered Dobby to go serve Harry, he should be waiting in Hogwarts. It is unclear whether Draco knows this Harry is the old Harry because Draco is, and has always been, kind of odd. It took them a while to discover it, but Draco is just a bunch or random powerful ideas held together with anxiety and fire. Harry loves him so much.
Slytherins, and the Malfoys in particular, were
to get yourself invited to the Longbottom’s house.” Narcissa says. Something in her tone finally cuts Draco’s unending cries that they have to get Harry, he will do it himself even if he is just one meter and ten centimeters tall.
Draco understood that Mort’s place was an incredible step up from sleeping on the streets or in a bathroom in the Underground. The place was beautiful, spacious and clean.
, on the chair) he had forgotten about them and dressed with something else. A combination of Sirius’ and Remus’ clothes, brought from Hogwarts.
Regulus took a second to answer. He glanced down at the silver mark on his forearm, barely visible under the bathroom light.
ooOoo
“This is not what I expected” he told Bill who was looking radiant even with the scars. He looked so happy that he was almost prettier than his wife. “Chocolate. There was to be chocolate.”
? Would she keep her maiden name and thus reveal that she was nothing more than an ambitious shrew woman unfit for marriage and motherhood who only married a Weasley for their political connections and new fortune?
Draco let two seconds pass, thinking. Harry forced himself to stop staring at his face, at the eyes that were made of stormy glass and the hair threaded with silver and sun. He looked at the hands, long and white and elegant and with a purple stain at the base of the left thumb. He looked at his well-worn clothes, at the cuffs of his trousers.
The death eaters came in two waves. While one fought the people of the Order as they arrived, the other succeeded in locating and retrieving the prophesy record.
to become successful, though. There are certain topics Draco refuses to write about and those are the topics people are interested in. The villains and heroes of the last war. Harry Potter, Severus Snape, Percy Weasley. Even Draco himself, and he draws the line at that. He is not writing about himself and he certainly is not going to set the rumours straight.
(because pigs very rarely frisked kids). Follow that guy. And if you were older he would tell you what to steal and who to scare and what to sell.
they all keep asking
A small flame had erupted on Fred’s wand and with the same motion he had sent it forwards, all the way across the corridor and to the foyer.
Malfoy didn’t want any of the bottles of gin or apple-flavour liquor. He did take the offal with him which was surprising because Malfoy didn’t seem like he ate meat let alone touched it unless it had gone through the hands of the most experienced and reputable cook in the country. Then again, he had come to Grimmauld Place with dirty cuffs on his trousers so it was obvious that Harry didn’t know everything about him.
It was so obvious, then, that he would have been reduced to selling himself.
that they could take on Harry. They could do what no one else was able to and kill the boy, the abominable boy. In fact, they were starting to relish the idea. It wasn’t the main goal but it would be a nice, pretty addendum. Nobody liked a fellow survivor, someone who made a mockery of death.
As predicted by Harry, Riv did get music and language lessons and his uncle Ronald tutored him in math. What no one had predicted (and Percy got a lot of grief for not saying a word about it) was what a horrible idea this was. Education was all good and nice, but Riv was the kind of boy who should be kept in the most profound ignorance.
“Listen, I…” Harry began as he went to take a seat. Never let it be said that Harry wasn’t brave enough to apologise.
“Crazy hair really doesn’t help as a descriptor in this case”.
The pyjamas were for Regulus and Fred, evidently. But since both of them were falling asleep the clothes were left on a nearby table and they just threw an extra blanket over them.
If Pansy went to Azkaban for ten years, like some people said she should, how long should actual torturer Goyle go? How long for Umbridge? Avery? MacNair?
They had been followed, but not for long. The brooms malfunctioned quickly and not many deatheaters had managed to jump in them in the first place. Soon they were alone in the sky. They flew at full speed for hours, until they spotted a bunch of abandoned warehouses somewhere past Reading and Draco descended in careful concentric circles.
Just one piece of fabric for the woman who had been lady of the house for three years. The woman who died young and lost her wand only for it to return almost eighty years later.
“I feel about the same,” Fred told them. He and Regulus had taken an hour-long nap before stirring. Harry immediately went to help him put on pyjamas and Fred complained that he didn’t like them, they had stripes, stripes were the worst, and that Malfoy looked much better.
Quinn’s arm snapped up, hand like a talon, and closed around Harry’s neck. He was making an effort not to snarl, to keep the appearance of composure, but his pupils had narrowed to pinpoints at the mention of his predecessor.
Harry had inordinately high standards for a squatter.
The doorbell rang. Five tolls like a hammer hitting a broken pot. It was midmorning now and Harry knew it was the usual time Draco came, before he stayed in the house full-time.
Draco also burned his shoulders and nose despite using sun lotion generously, and the sand scraped him everywhere. It wasn’t a terrible burn, though, and he enjoyed playing in the water with Harry. He also took control of Harry’s castle building project to make a beautiful palace with a French garden. His hair became even blonder, which no one had thought possible. Just as when he had left Hogwarts, he looked really well when he wasn’t perfectly groomed.
” she wrote back. “
Obviously it wouldn’t be an unforgivable curse.
“I don’t usually dream of Voldemort,” Harry said. Someone had to go first. “I think I am supposed to have nightmares with him, but I don’t.”
“Okay, okay. Just a sec.”
one, that he brushed his hair with a hair comb made of house elves bones, that in his younger years he had a French lover who committed suicide when he married Narcissa instead, that he could destroy the lives of three wizards before breakfast.
It wasn’t the case. They were not killing them trying to save them. They might even be seeing a small improvement.
This had finally freed him to climb up the stairs and go talk for a little bit to Harry and Draco, saying there were many people Harry might want to meet and assuring Draco that they were doing all they could to learn what had happened to his parents. The boys had certainly not been expecting the second part and they looked honestly surprised. Remus wondered if they could really complain for the terrible opinion they had formed of all of them.
“All right, Perce,” Fred said. He had taken the few steps separating them and kneeled beside his older brother. “All right.”
The problem was the inaccessible configuration of the lake. If Hermione were here she would have some clever suggestions of similar cases to read about, but she was gone to get her parents back from Australia and he didn’t want to bother her. Draco, too, had many things in his mind and Sirius was helping him so Harry didn’t want to bother any of them or rob them of their time when this was something that could perfectly wait.
As if he would skimp on their son to buy a pair of socks for himself.
He was, to Harry, wondrously beautiful. Like a classic god. Like someone who could give you the sword to kill a Gorgon and the sandals to take you to the end of the world. Like someone who would descend in a golden chariot in the middle of battle and take you away.
Just as it was difficult to imagine Luna without mud and dirt up to her knees, it was difficult to picture Malfoy anything other than impeccably dressed. Of course Harry had seen Luna clean and shiny and he must had seen Malfoy with dirty shoes after walking through the fields of Hogwarts or coming from Hogsmeade. It was a mental picture, not reality, but the dirty cuffs still were slightly disconcerting, as the little areas of pill in Malfoy’s sweater were disconcerting. Barely noticeable but still there, a hint of, of what? Of old clothes that are comfortable, or can’t be replaced yet, or of the owner not noticing how worn they are. Somehow the latter seemed more difficult to believe than the fact that Malfoy had comfy clothes that were his favourite.
A week ago Regulus and Fred were dying, having seizures daily and barely able to keep anything down. Two weeks ago they were so sick that Harry was sure they wouldn’t last an hour. Three weeks ago they had been
Harry had a big gleeful grin on his face. Regulus and Fred looked at each other and immediately averted their gazes, embarrassed with the knowledge of the thing that hurt the other.
So they moved in and there was a race between Draco, Blaise and Ron to find and claim the best bedroom (Blaise won, by cheating, and immediately surrendered it to Ginny).
Mother’s concern he could understand, because he realized he had been rash with Umbridge. There were appearances to maintain and he had failed. Aunt Bella was something else. She spoke with shiny eyes of the restoration of the order and the days to come. And look, Draco was convinced of his own superiority because you only had to
Malfoy shrugged his coat off (too thin for the current weather and, again, with mud specks on the bottom) and went to attend Fred. Most of the bleeding had stopped or trickled down to a very thin wisp by the time Harry felt like he could step away and get the door. All they had to do was wash the blood away.
Draco wanted to take the girls to a park after lunch, but it’s awfully cold and beginning to rain. He looks at Harry doubtfully because knowing the Weasleys an hour and half might not be enough to tire them out. It is clear that neither of them want to cut the good time short.
. It was more the “oh dear” tone when you realize you are not getting shagged tonight because someone has only a hundredth pages left of the Agatha Christie novel and they want to finish it.
Only Harry had to come and shake Draco’s world again. He couldn’t just follow the script and walk away once he was aware of Draco’s tainted reputation. No, he had to come and apologise. Terribly the first time, earnestly and sweetly the second. And he hadn’t stopped at the apology. He had worked at making amends while respecting Draco’s anger.
Whenever someone came to talk to Percy they invariably talked about what that person had done during the war, how they had
Also, this is an excellent place to take a break, drink some water. No, really, I know what comes next. Rest now.
Then Malfoy sighed, looked at the watch on his left wrist, and turned on his heels striding back to the library. Harry followed him in silence, afraid to run his stupid mouth and ruin it again.
Fred blinked a couple of times and he rested with his eyelids half open. When he did that it looked like he was just tired or distracted, thinking of something else. It was when his eyes moved, when they passed right over Harry and didn’t see him, when they couldn’t pinpoint Regulus or Draco in the room. It was…
“Especially the ones I have trained. They might have expected me to kick them, but they wouldn’t have shaken off a
“Yes, master,” said the elf, taking the letter from Harry’s hands. There was no sarcasm or sass or veiled criticism. Not even a muttered wish that Harry drop dead. He said “master” absentmindedly, like an old familiar word that came easily to his lips rather than the weapon he hurled at Harry’s face. Truly, either Kreacher was getting old or he was as affected by recent events as Harry was.
Draco hesitated just for a second. “All right, then. I will find you in that goblin place.” He pointed down the street to a bar and café with a brightly-coloured storefront.
The things is, he knew he ought to be pissed at having to leave his house, but he didn’t. He had all his things and Draco by his side and so this felt merely like a small inconvenience trying to help a neighbour.
He turned to Draco. “Have you heard of her?”
London is very big. There is a lot of walking to do before you get to any recognizable part of the city. They were not there yet, but it was fine. Harry was confident that absolutely no one was going to look for them in the suburbs, which was good because he still didn´t know how they had been caught that morning, other than the lack of breakfast and the inability to put some decent distance.
People who were only now starting to slowly regain some mobility in their right side couldn’t be left alone in the bathroom lest they fall down and drown. People who were also Weasleys just had to resign themselves to living life under supervision and also quit flashing the portraits of old people. This meant that Harry had to stay with them and help them wash. Some other time it might have been awkward and embarrassing for everyone, but it was surprisingly easy.
He… okay, he didn’t have much to go on. If he looked at it with a cold head, it was just a man like many others. Pervier, perhaps, but nothing more.
They ate, they washed, they got dressed. Everybody noticed that Harry chose his attire carefully. Nothing that spoke overtly of combat, but everything—from the cut of the jacket (allowed for free arm movement) to the fabric (resilient without being constricting)—would allow him to fight and fight well.
Harry turned in bed and woke up with a jolt of pain. His side was still tender in the area where it was burned. He also had bruises blooming that he hadn’t healed yesterday because he hadn’t even noticed them. Nothing too big, though. The worst was the burn and it wasn’t all that bad. Just a big area of pink skin that was hot and delicate.
Draco has seen Potter lick ice-cream out of his t-shirt.
the vomit from the floor. There were some small stains on the cushion that Harry knew were harder to remove. Anything made of fabric was surprisingly difficult to clean even by magic. The embroidered napkins would never be the same.
And, look, Harry is still thinking about what Draco said: that nobody would look for Goyle because he was ugly. Draco was right and Harry can’t stop thinking about it. (When he is not thinking about the horrible wicked business at hand or the fact that Draco is amazingly skilled and Harry has a competence kink). Harry already made the mistake of overlooking Goyle because of his looks once (and brains and ethics and talents, to be fair). He is not doing it again. There were obviously some hidden depths to Goyle and Draco is mourning him.
Sunday is Percy side apparating a whole family, including the dog, right when Dolohov was casting a killing curse.
“You are going to dehydrate if you keep sleeping” Draco said with a tone that admitted no excuses.
“Did they send me daughters…”, Mort sung with closed eyes and full emotion, “when I asked… for sons?”
Also, the dragon was supposed to eat and/or burn Harry since he was an intruder. But all Harry got was a thorough sniff while he pulled the spike out. Not only the dragon didn’t do as he had been trained to do, but it followed Harry docilely dragging the chain and the ring and the spike behind. The playful violins were still echoing on Harry’s ears and the dragon seemed to be walking on tiptoes so it would go unnoticed.
Regulus had been clawed when he stood in front of Luna. Pushed away as if he were nothing. He had bought her enough seconds to get up and cast another charm, but it was obvious that they were losing, that this thing didn’t just have the advantage of surprise, but of strength and size and possibly magic. It reacted to magic but their charms and hexes did very little.
And then you would have the monster, a Demon. Something that didn’t have all the powers of a dementor but could bring horror and misery, something with horns and claws or paws, depending on the creature used. Something terrible and dangerous that should never have been. Like a horcrux. Harry had no idea how you would go about controlling it, but he was sure that there would be a way.
“No, the friend,” said Luna. “Brown hair and freckles. Had a long name and then a short one. Oh, I know! Theodore Nott, of course!”
The Number 12 of Grimauld Place saw an increase in visitors and, really, the Fidelius charm didn’t make much sense anymore because Sirius kept inviting people in. Which made him loads of good because all he needed in life was people to talk to and flirt with, and the house benefited from the airing. All werewolves got a hot meal in them and when the moon came, the Wolfsbane potion, no questions asked. Some of them returned, some only came for the potion and refused to speak a single word. Some came once and they were never seen again and people worried. Some stayed with Remus for a chat and a quick course on muggle ways.
This was something very much like a home.
Harry was a good detective. He was sharp and bright and knew how to make connections. Being a good fighter and knowledgeable in DADA helped in his Auror career, but that wasn’t all. There was investigating too, and he was good at it. Hence all the little things he had noticed about Draco which, together, made for a bigger thing. He still didn’t have the whole picture (what was with Draco and money? he didn’t seem to have any) but he had a pretty good outline.
as a precaution.
Funnily enough, Draco could guess almost instantly what had happened next.
Harry had opinions, all right? Academic opinions even. Malfoy looked very uninterested in them, though. He was staring at Harry with those eyes of his that were so cold and distant. The same distance that Luna put between herself and the world, only Luna was high in the sky, playing with the birds and the clouds, and Malfoy was somewhere in a frozen tundra in the middle of a blizzard.
They do it in packs. They move around the prey, cutting their exits one by one and pushing them away from open terrain. They chase for hours, letting them exhaust themselves. Until they are too tired to present a fight. Then the pack makes a circle and they bring the prey down.
But mostly, fighting with Ron was fun. With Harry she couldn’t fight, it was heart breaking, and they worked very well together in any case. (They were undefeated board games partners! Except with Monopoly where the Malfoy-Longbottom alliance swept the floor with them). Draco was too dangerous to fight him, he seemed to be the kind to pull long-term plans. But Ron, you could just fight him for the whole entirety of a Friday evening and still be friends the next day when you lend him your notes to study and he brought you yet another wizarding drink or candy for you to try and maybe admit it was good.
Harry had expected the chorus of noes, because, well, he had been dating their sister Ginny and now he had turned to a boy
“Come on, Pit, you can tell me. We are friends.
He turned to Harry, eyebrows slightly raised. He was very pretty today. Harry didn’t know what it was, but Draco looked really well. His smile was soft when nothing in Draco ever looked soft. Harry wanted to see more of it. He wanted…
Harry took this with the seriousness and gravity it deserved. Draco had very strong opinions on art, but given how well his designs sold Harry was inclined to think he was right.
Arthur Weasley has three deatheaters following him at all times, in case he slips any clue. Percy Weasley has only two, but he is more talkative.
It really doesn’t. Audrey understands and agrees, but then again Audrey is in love with Percy and his multiple oddities so she obviously has some peculiar opinions of her own. She is the one who asks Draco to be godfather to their daughters and explains her reasoning because Draco has exhibited enough qualities that Audrey trusts him to raise Molly and Lucy if the situation arise. That’s Audrey. She didn’t participate in the war, she is not haunted by it, but when she chooses a godfather she doesn’t go by friendship or a social need to appease someone. She chooses the person who would ensure her children grew up safe, loved and ready to face the world.
“If you insist on staying here I won’t refuse you,” Harry said, opening his arms. He moved around so he could lean against the desk side by side with Fred. “But if, and only if; if things get real bad, if you see me get knocked down or something, if he gets too close… I want you to grab the dog and Aeneas and even the snake and go. You can come back right away and join the fight,” Harry said quickly, before Fred could argue. “But please, take them somewhere safe, away from here.”
“Six inches, golden oak, unicorn hair.”
With the Dark Lord things should had been better. He had promised what the Ministry and Dumbledore could not: their freedom to roam and run and bite and not to be called beasts.
Snape’s instructions were to investigate more on whatever the Order found on Harry Potter and see if Trelawney dropped any other prophesies, and he would definitely not try to kill Dumbledore because that would mean losing their best positioned spy. Specially when anyone, even Rosier, could do that.
Regulus was back to casting lights that changed colours and Fred was looking at them in reverent silence. It was just one or two lights, though. Regulus had the strain around his eyes and mouth that said that he had a big headache coming and in an hour he would be wishing for death to come relieve him. He was sitting very close to Fred, sides pressed together.
Harry wondered about it. He didn’t know much about wands but he was still aware that there were wand trends and fashions, so that might tell them something about the wand’s owner. Tomorrow he would go to Ollivander’s and ask about it. Tonight, he was done with thinking.
“Of course the boy hasn’t been kidnapped”. That was Diggle, who held the honour of being the second person at the meeting that had seen Harry Potter recently. “Minerva is right, those muggles were horrible. Why, after I shook hands with young Potter-”
“When I am happy, though. I wish they could see me then, that I could share it”.
Fred was trying the melon scented soap. He was very excited about how well they had mimicked the smell. He called to Harry to come sniff it and when he didn’t immediately go, threw a bit of lather in his direction.
“Uh,” said Fred.
Malfoy Manor became a long-term recovery facility. They had a big building, beautiful gardens and money to cover all expenses. Lorna Elderberry was happy to take the thankless job of directing the institution and she didn’t even ask for a high salary, which she very well could. All she wanted was free range of action and to have her portrait in a place of honour.
And then, he kissed him. A big hard kiss, putting everything, all the strength of his back, all the force of his heart, in his lips, pressing, pressing, pressing against Harry.
He looked at the cursed arch and the Veil, thin and delicate and as opaque as ever. His eyes fell on the arch even before he was done going through the door. He hadn’t really intended to let the door close behind him because he wasn’t going to stay there that long. Just a peek and he would leave. But the Veil had moved and then two figures had stumbled out of the arch and fallen to the floor gasping for breath and of course Harry had let go of the door.
It seems that what they want to do is date each other. Percy enrols the girls in a muggle school in London and the family moves to England indefinitely.
The whole reason I made this calendar is that I had this scene plus Sirius' written and couldn't fit them in the last chapter.
At the very least he could make some income selling hair to wig factories.
Draco looked at him, his eyes narrowed, so he knew something was wrong. But that didn’t mean anything. Whoever had come yesterday
The homeless community that hung around King Cross station had learned their lesson and kept well away from anything remotely magical. It was a damn pity they had been so quick to obliviate McPharne because Remus thought he must have known something. You don’t just walk to a random locker and punch in the correct code to unlock it.
“No. At least I don’t think so.” Harry had the next part of his story prepared and he hoped he was right about his impression that it wasn’t a modern wand. “I was doing some in-depth cleaning of the house and found it at the back of a drawer. I don’t think it had been opened in years. I wondered who it belonged to.”
, most likely, since it came on Sundays. Harry had only glanced at the cover which announced a tell-all about Aetius Quinn and the dark machinations in the Department of Mysteries.
They met with the upstairs people a couple more times. Draco glared at them the whole trip. Spider giggled and smiled flirtatiously and Harry deliberately asked if anyone had seen that post-war pop art exhibition and what did they thought about it.
Draco nodded. He had a weird expression, eyes searching. “Is that how you got this?”. His long fingers were tracing the scar on his forehead, careful and delicate as he was with everything. The scar was something that Harry kept always hidden, something of himself that he knew was
Harry put the tray on the coffee table just as he had done last night. It was the same teapot, after he had cast
If someone, probably Malfoy although it could be Hermione too, if someone told Harry that they could fill a warehouse with all the things he didn’t know, Harry would laugh and say that they could fill a warehouse, a freight train and a whole city. Harry was very aware that there were many things he didn’t know.
There was a very,
“Ginny is the ex-girlfriend,” Regulus helpfully explained to Draco. Harry felt his heart take a harder beat. Draco could have done without the reminder.
The unthinkable happened in June and Voldemort entered the Ministry. Emmeline Vance was keeping guard there and was instantly murdered, as were two other wizards who had been working late.
Regulus noticed something was wrong, of course, but Regulus had had a day full of tension with a duel and a visit to nightmare land. He had cake for dinner and went to sleep early, saying only that he agreed with Harry that the foyer looked better with no ceiling.
Harry snorted. Draco was right. That was probably another reason why they spoke to them, they both blended in.
Harry was not back in bed. He was sitting cross legged on the floor talking animatedly with the house elf.
Sirius: Yes to everything. (But that was Sirius’ default answer).
“Come here.”
Fred called the notebook to him and laughed as it crossed the room, its covers flapping like the wings of a butterfly. Harry felt a pang of something on the left side of his chest. The notebook was widely used by Aurors and the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol and it was a few years old now.
For a second Harry thought he had won. For a second Regulus was silent. Then he opened his mouth and delivered the first blow.
Harry wished he could see more but Draco was returning and the moment he entered Harry’s field of vision he captured all of Harry’s attention. He had a folded-open magazine with him.
At this point Fred’s head could usually be seen over his brother’s shoulder, nodding quickly and with fervour. “Alliteration” he would mouth. Not a term wizards were familiar with, even if they did have an affinity for the concept.
“Well Sam, you are a very lucky woman. Must be grateful for that trade. Did you got any chance to say thanks?”
Draco’s knock on the door was ignored. There was a thud and a rattle, just like cutlery falling to the floor. Harry barely had to point to the lock with the awl before the door swung open.
Harry was so weird.
“Are you all right? Here,” he said as he skidded to a stop. There was quite a lot of coughing and desperate intakes of breath and trembling. Harry helped them sit upright to alleviate the coughing, but it looked like something more than coughing, something painful and terrible. “Are you— are you Unspeakables?”
The ugly lanky young man is adult Draco, of course, governed by an eight-year-old who has completely destroyed his hair through rebellion and ill-advised experimentation.  Harry,
Draco, however, was extremely nonchalant. “It’s just paint,” he said.
Aeneas arrived at dinner time with his feathers wet from the rain. Fenton ran to sniff him and see if he was foe or friend. Aeneas batted his wings in alarm and sought refuge in Harry’s chest, wetting his shirt. Harry managed to calm him down and introduce him to Fenton who, thankfully, decided that Aeneas was a friend and not a toy.
For the most part Draco didn’t mind it. Prostitute was neither better nor worse than Death Eater. He wanted to think that if he had to resort to selling himself he would be making more money than at his current job, but he didn’t spend enough time in wizarding society for it to matter in any case. He had gone muggle early and he had stayed there. Muggles didn’t know him and didn’t up the rent just because it was him. His job was the only thing that tied him to the wizarding world. That was enough.
There was a big mirror in a golden frame, its surface beginning to mist with the steam of the shower. Fred was standing in front of it, looking at his reflection with a lost expression. The bathroom was white tile with black decorations and the soft blur of the steam. Fred was the only note of colour in the room, maybe the universe. The only discordant element and even he seemed to be vanishing away, blurred and swallowed by the enveloping steam. His hair, more orange than red, was like a smudged watercolour.
Draco shrugged. “I walked to the store and got them. There was a small town near the manor and it had a shop. And a bigger town in the other direction.”
And yet, as Draco buried a hand in Harry’s hair and changed the angle of the kiss, Harry felt he was coming home. He felt a weight lift from his shoulders and an easiness take over his chest. It was soft and gentle and free of worries. It was just… right.
The building that Draco entered wasn’t his house. Not just because his home had been until that night a third floor flat with no power, but because the house itself felt alien. The air was different. The stones moaned in pain, as if trying to shake loose an unwanted presence.
“I risked my life for him.”
There was an open bottle of wine and some Christmas treats on a plate. They drank the wine and ate the treats and kissed lightly on the lips while they put the presents in place.
is a very strong word,” he said at last, softly.
He had stressed that Sirius had to remain calm and silent, but it was hard for him, too, to keep his eyes and his smile on Draco first, and not to jump at the sight of Harry.
(Plus Luna, every other night.)
“No,” he snapped. It was the first thing he was feeling that morning and it was wrath.
“Nevertheless,” said Regulus quickly and brusquely and desperate. He seemed to realise his curtness and he closed his eyes and took a deep, grounding breath. He spoke the rest of his lines with his eyes closed. It was much easier that way. “I hope you will allow me the liberty to proffer you my admiration, as it cannot be contained any longer within the narrow expanse of my chest. I love you, Miss Lovegood. I love you. I realise that I have little to offer: I come to you destitute, with no fortune or family or magic. I come to you with a name of no worth, a name that hardly deserves such consideration. But I come to you begging that you will consider me nonetheless. Just a man hoping that his heart will be enough to account for his lack of parts. A man who will love you no matter what.”
The old woman returned with the tea in a tray. She set  it down on a side table and peered at the pictures.
“Maybe, maybe we should go public after all.”
had been killed with an insult and a weapon made of bone.
And then it was his turn. Once he had learned of the possibility of presents, of course Draco had found something for him, too. This one was wrapped in a thin maroon paper. Heavy and squared shaped.
He hurriedly threw a pack of ramen, because on the streets no one let good hot water go to waste. He still wasn’t convinced he wasn’t going crazy, but if the madness could recreate the feeling of soft noodles and hot soup Harry was game.
A soft pink light was starting to caress the top of the buildings when Draco and he stepped out to the street. He hadn’t updated his list of possible refuges in a while, things had been so good he had started to forget the permanent fear. But he was certain they could find somewhere adequate nevertheless.
“You must have noticed something, haven’t you? And what did you do to keep hidden? Two questions, so I want long answers”
Seven out of seven.
—                   B O O M                  —
Aetius Quinn was there. Tall, but not remarkably tall. Thin, but more slender than skinny. The cut of his grey robes was elegant and simple, ending just above the knee and showing a pair of trousers of the same colour. His shoes were leather and expensive. The only note of colour was the silk yellow cravat tied around his neck with a narrow knot. He wore perfume, and Harry was surprised to see that it was the first time he had noticed it. Something deep and fragrant that made Harry think of blackberries and nettles.
“Of course, my dear child, of course. Honesty, I find, it’s a wonderful virtue”.
“Plenty of people speak to me,” mumbled the one resting against Harry, face buried on his chest and one arm thrown over Harry’s shoulders. The other had given up on standing and was resting on his side, his hands clutching the rough stone of the floor as if the room were moving.
“Then, you shouldn’t meet so soon.” Narcissa says firmly, although inside her heart is aching and she doesn’t know why. “Children who grow together tend to see each other as siblings. Why, your Great Aunt Marthia grew up with Gaius Mulciber, her fiancée, and their marriage was very difficult. I think he tried to poison her in order to marry his lover, or the other way around. I can’t remember. In any case, it is better to wait.”
“Why do you ask so much about my scar? You keep asking to see it,” Harry said, hoping.
He passed his hand through the length of his ponytail and glanced briefly at Harry, as if reading something in his face.
it. He registered all he was seeing. It wasn’t the casual and unavoidable look while going through the motions. His look was intelligent.
. “Did you tell them to print this?”
They had beautiful tails, long, and shiny, and asking to be flicked. That was true and it was fair. The firebirds provoked the impulse to touch them and flick them and pet them. However, people didn’t do any of that because they had enough sense to see that it would be a bad idea. If the fire didn’t kill you, their beaks and claws would.
comparisons didn’t count because there was no wizarding monarchy). Or why Harry was sent to live with some of the most dreadful people on Earth. (They were still in the top ten, but Harry had learned soon enough that there were plenty of people to occupy the higher positions). He didn´t even know how Harry had managed to survive the curse and defeat Voldemort when he was but a toddler, but he could hazard the guess that Harry didn´t feel like dying that day. That seemed to be the way his magic worked.
“… a feminine touch, perhaps…”
But just in case he went and got Ron to accompany him so he could stop Harry if he turned crazy.
No, really. Just for kicks Fred and Harry had asked what they thought of Slughorn’s checkered vests and they had both defended them without blinking even though they made the man look like some kind of bad optical illusion. Malfoy had even gone as far as saying that the lime green ankle boots were a bold yet worthy statement. Then he had looked all smug at Harry because at last he had found something that bugged him and made him sputter rather than agree happily.
Then he went and, and, and
And, guess what? That was it. They were too tired to talk to anyone else, to see if they meant well or not. They were too tired to talk even with the people that honestly meant well. They just wanted a safe place to spend the night, and that’s what they were offering.
The mother, though, the mother
“There is always one of the portraits,” Harry said easily, waving an arm as if saying stick and stones might hurt my bones but words and killing curses can’t hurt me. “Come on in.”
inside. There wasn’t a werewolf there anymore, but there were thestrals who were sweet gentle carnivorous creatures. Luna explained about the things that thestrals might do, but rarely did, while she nonchalantly removed her dress, getting down to her tights and cotton shirt to see if she had any injuries. Harry had left a mark on her arm (he was so sorry!) and she also had a bruise on the opposite elbow from when she had fallen to the floor, but she was otherwise fine. She didn’t even feel the sting from the
strip. Of course Harry didn’t think it very likely that the cartoon had never satirised Draco but it did made Draco a bit of a hypocrite given how he had judged Harry for having one or two strips framed in the house.
Harry had a goofy smile on his face and the dead monster was only half the reason for it.
,” said Harry. The wand danced in not-Luna’s hand rather than jumping from it and landing on the hedge on the other side of the street, but it was enough. Harry casted something simple, a spell he used to put out the fire and all the lights in a room at once. It made a draft of air strong enough to distract the fake Luna and make her finally drop her wand and he didn’t even have to say the words aloud, barely had to even think about it.
“Oh, I hate when that happens,” Fred said.
There is more than one reason why only Charlie has met the girls.
from the library. When he got to the right page Mort fled down the stairs and all the way to the street laughing hysterically, the cheeky bastard. It was a wonder he could get that far, he was laughing so hard.
There was a small panic in Hogwarts.
Draco raised his eyebrows. He had bent his leg slightly so he could rest the box on his thigh. He was holding it with both hands.
(Out of all the forbidden things in their vault Draco went straight to the diary the Dark Lord had entrusted Lucius. Straight to it. And he destroyed it that very same night.)
Olivia didn’t let their opinions stop her. It was true that, being a muggle, she had a bit of a handicap and sometimes she couldn’t see the snitch very well. But according to the team’s captain neither did most of the Seekers of the other teams so she shouldn’t worry about it. Besides, Olivia was an excellent Beater.
“And what do you-?
So while he was standing there assuring Draco that they would be safe inside the house and making himself as non-threatening as possible, Harry had been quietly observing and assessing.
Fleur Delacour is so pretty. Everybody comments that she is part veela. Nobody remembers she was the Beauxbatons Champion. If anything, they remark on her keeping her maiden name.
“Hello,” he said, when Draco came closer.
When Fred dies it gets worse, much worse. Percy can barely speak and it’s all because of the flowers taking over his lungs and throat and heart. He quits his job by letter and moves to a cheap place in the country where he doesn’t have to speak to anyone.
They realised it the next morning when they woke up after a full night of restful sleep, the first they had had since they came back to life. Fred yawned like a lion while Regulus stretched his arms and said, “I feel good.” Then he paused and looked perplexed as he blinked and checked himself.
There is a house east of France, in a town that is not particularly pretty or interesting but that has a train station. In less than two hours, probably closer to one, you could find yourself in Swizerland, or Germany, or Italy or even Austria, and in a morning you could get to Luxembourg, Belgium or Netherland.
“A friend’s son” Remus explained. “It is too hard for them, you understand”
“Romania.”
Draco made a cup of tea with as much if not more care with which he prepared the most complex and advanced potions under Snape’s surly eyes. It had taken him a while to find and adequate mug (all smashed) and a spoon (spread around the floor with the kitchen drawers), and then he discovered that they only had pretentious posh tea in the house. One careful sniff told him it was the kind that sounds good in the label but ends up tasting like charcoal. Draco thought that Patricia deserved a proper real cup and not charcoal tasting derivatives. Fortunately some rummaging had produced a Twinings box of Earl Grey and he was now dunking two bags in the hot water all the while wishing fervently that this would be enough to help her.
For example, that was that tosser Yaxley.
's “Last Christmas” before it was drown by the Black’s personal rendition.
There was a small and dirty backyard outside, that with some work could become a nice garden. There was a nice spot in the stairs’ landing where one could sit to read. The kitchen was big enough to bake and brew a potion at the same time. Most importantly, there were Harry’s parents telling him to walk, not stomp, how can someone so small make so much noise coming down the stairs?
They went to the beach.
Draco’s eyes lowered again and stopped for a second on Harry’s lips. This would be a good time to kiss Draco, except Harry has just handed him money and he couldn’t do that, he couldn’t, not at all. He opened his mouth again which was probably worse.
“I don’t want to think about that time”
At least they hadn’t tried eating anyone’s face. Not even a chomp on a hand.
“Pit?”
Quinn cast again, sending something sharp and strong towards Harry. Harry deflected and cast a standard paralysing spell, like any wizard in law enforcement would. Harry had little hope of the spell working but he wanted to see how Quinn reacted.
Draco stayed in the living room, looking suitably impressed at Regulus’ dancing lights and quickly suffocating the small fire one of them created before Harry could see it and take away the wand. (Harry noticed anyway because there was a small scorch mark on the wallpaper.) Meanwhile Harry rushed through a few chores, getting dinner started in a pot at a low fire, cleaning the loo on the ground floor and sorting the laundry in two piles. Then he went back to the living room with tea, although instead of the banged and repaired teapot he brought an old coffeepot he had found in a corner of the kitchen. In essence it was practically a teapot and Harry couldn’t stand the sight of the old one.
“You’re not going?” Said Hermione.
“Chocolates, Potter,” said Draco, indicating the box in his hand.
in there,” Sirius responded.
“What’s T--” the blond started, but then shook his head. “Ah, yes, the grocer’s. Right, well, I’m sure the edifice will remain standing if you beg off one night.”
He almost missed the first hint that slipped out. Even though he was Master of Grimmauld Place, and its walls whispered to him of his guests’ conspiracies, he tried to allow them their privacy.
, holy shit--levitating a kettle toward his worn marble countertop.
Harry swallowed. “I want to forget again.”
Harry decided this would be a good time to sit down.
“Oh?” Draco’s voice lowered, and Harry could almost see him stretching like a satisfied cat. “Have you finally realized you need some down time?”
“No,” the blond interrupted, “No, I rather think I’m not. See, I’m very rich, and I refuse to miss out on a good evening simply because a hovel like this refuses to compensate you adequately for your labor. I insist you dine with me. I’ll make it worth your while.”
It was about fifteen minutes before Draco’s next email arrived.
“I don’t keep whiskey. Will a martini suit? I believe I’ve also got some brandy…”
It was amazing, given how different Draco and Tom were from each other, that they both took so much after Malfoy Senior. Lord Malfoy and Tom fixed Harry with matching looks of chilly disapproval.
“It’s my good fortune,” said Draco, “that I’m rich enough to be a slob.”
Look, guys, a Plot!  Here's hoping that doesn't crash and burn.  Keep your fingers crossed for me!
To: Harry Potter
“I don’t want to give it to you now,” said Draco.
“Hermione—”
“No she doesn’t,” said Hermione.
“Lump!” Amy exclaimed, trying to make a grab for the cat. However, Lump wouldn’t come off of Draco’s shirt.
“Tom,” said Draco.
Harry turned to find what he assumed was an escaped character from an E.M. Forster novel leaning over the counter. The man was about Harry’s age, but that was where their similarity ended. He was tall, angular, and coiffed, with pale blond hair and cutting grey eyes. His clothes looked expensive, but there were no designer labels on him, no lavish wristwatch or anything else to announce his wealth, other than his voice and his posture. He was classy, this bloke, but there was not an ounce of modesty in him. Harry wanted him at once.
“Yes, yes,” said Hermione as Harry looked at his plate, blushing brilliantly red.
“Pipe down!” Sirius told it. “Fuck! I can’t remember the counter-charm!”
“Yes.”
“Yes,” said Harry again, and Draco wrapped a hand around his wrist as Harry led him down a stunted hall.
“I’m getting one,” said Hari with conviction.
Harry swallowed, and to Draco’s credit, he did not interrupt.
“I was coerced,” Harry explained.
“Say more.”
“Lacked of” lol
“Yes. Sunday.”
“Nothing.” Harry swallowed. “Er, it’s just that...what’s a bloke like you doing in a place like this?”
“Some people, of course, resisted the Dark Lord. Your parents were among them, Harry. They fought the Dark Lord to the end.”
Draco caught his gaze, held it for a moment, and then nodded. Without a word, he led Harry out of the pub. They walked in silence to Draco’s flat, which was quite close. The building was gorgeous, and the doorman greeted Draco warmly as they swept inside and moved to the elevator. When they finally stepped into the flat itself, Harry couldn’t hold back a chuckle.
“Then pour one,” said Draco. “It’s your flat.”
“Well?” Luna probed once Ron began to serve the tea.
“It’s possible,” said Draco with his best posh drawl, his best indifferent expression. “Can you be more specific?”
“Harry,” Kingsley interrupted, “I’ve been a social worker for over twenty years.” He came around the desk then and put a fatherly hand on Harry’s shoulder. “I’m not blind. That man has hurt you. He’ll never be welcome here. Know that we’ll do what we can to keep you safe.”
“Yes, I’m a Muggle,” said Amy to Arthur, “and
“Your rent for the rest of the year has been paid in full.”
“Absolutely not.”
“Sorry to disappoint,” said Harry, “but I’ve got to make rent.”
“Thanks,” said Harry, and made his way to the toilet--or
But there was some incense of fellowship in it, and that carried them through.
“What’s going on. Right.” Draco looked at Harry, then shook his head in disbelief. “Merlin’s fucking bollocks. I can’t believe this.”
Without his permission Harry’s eyes shot to Neville, who looked placid, in his element, with dirt under his nails and fuzzy earmuffs around his neck. Neville only smiled--his tiny postwar smile--and nodded.
“Well, then I’d like to continue speaking, and I have a topic in mind.” Merlin, was nothing with his children ever
“Leave me the fuck alone,” said Harry. “Haven’t you done enough damage? I’ve been suspended, you know, pending fucking termination. You had to stand there and say your fucking piece, and now my landlord’s going to throw me out on my arse come next week.”
Harry’s jaw dropped a bit. He didn’t know what to do, except to reply that he had work to do and hadn’t the time to faff about on a boozy lunch. Draco pointed out that Harry was probably not getting anything done in his current emotional state. Harry had to admit that he was right. So he agreed to meet Draco at an outrageously expensive place nearby.
“Christ,” he muttered, “this is dreadful.”
“Now, now, Weasley, play nice,” said Draco. “I’m only here to make friends. I’m afraid I haven’t given you lot a fair shake in the past.”
“It’s because I’m contemplating that monstrosity you’re eating,” said Harry. “If that’s the consequences of being vegetarian, count me out.”
Harry sat by the fire with Godric's head on his knee and thought about his first kiss with Draco. They’d struck up an uneasy friendship after catching each other’s eyes across the dance floor at a Muggle club. Draco had crowed a bit to find Saint Potter at a gay bar, and Harry had let him, hoping he wouldn’t go to the
Hermione sighed. “Well,” she said, “I suppose, since we’re not in school any more, you ought to call me Hermione. We’ll work out the rest later.”
“I’d say it’s more along the lines of light bribery,” said Draco.
“Yes, indeed, My Lord,” Draco agreed, trying not to sound too eager. “It was in contemplating possible bridges over these troubled waters that I came across a plan that would, I believe, be of further use to you than simply restoring the Malfoy ability to...
“It should have been,” said Draco. “You’ve had a shock, though. I’ll tell you now. I met Harry at a Muggle tea shop. Where he worked.”
--he’d take the memory of this hug to his grave. He smelled biscuits on Molly, and the dab of rose oil she wore at her pulse points, and sweat from the heat of the kitchen. She was soft, was Molly Weasley, but firm, her arms wrapped around him solidly and completely and—was she moving?
“Malfoy?” Hermione asked, clearly astonished.
“I would assume so,” said Draco. “I’m not certain what it is we actually
Every second he had to spare from his hefty caseload, Harry spent in search of Tom’s experimental subjects. He was drawing from the few clues in Draco’s notes, and after days of searching, all he had turned up were a few names without even a solid enough lead to justify an interview. He was about ready to throw his laptop through the office window.
Well, Draco wasn’t one for self-denial, even if he did occasionally partake in it to spite others. But this wasn’t Tom. This was Harry, his sweet, earnest, reckless, beloved nemesis, and Draco didn’t
“Why did I let you in here?” he wondered, and it was only Ginny’s tinkling laugh that clued him in that he was actually thinking aloud.

“Can we sleep first?” Amy requested. “I mean, me and Harry. Not sure if wizards sleep, but we mere mortals do.”
“Oh.”
their whole thing. I mean, they have their own sign language, Haz.”
He was real. This was real.
“Yes, well, I was no more forewarned than you were, ta very much. We are, I should say, equally humiliated in this, you and I.”
“Pretty much,” said Harry. “Molly Weasley wants me to come for Christmas. Without Draco.”
* * *
“And then what happened?” Harry asks. Narcissa’s mouth trembles slightly but she speaks clearly.
"Delegate? You're seriously offering delegation as a benefit of promotion? Wow, brilliant. I always base my decisions on how much potential power I'll have over others." Harry laughs.
Is everything all right?"

Astoria opens her mouth, but then looks across at Matthew and seems to catch an unspoken reassurance. She moves closer to him and he puts an arm around her shoulders. Narcissa gazes unseeingly at the fire.
"Draco. We're here."
The train is nearly at the crossing now.
how close it was?" Astoria twists round in her seat, watching the car recede into the distance.
“So it’s like Seeing?” Harry asked.
. "I'm continuing my investigative work. And if that means refusing a promotion, that's fine."
He drives on and on.
Harry lets the wizard hurtle on through his vitriol-fuelled speech. His polyjuice potion will be wearing off soon, he thinks. He hates having to take it, but what other choice does he have? As his supervisors rightfully point out, he'd become the security risk if he appeared as himself.
"What's so funny?" he demands.
“The whole day!” Harry says forlornly, trailing after Draco. “Baby names. And
And that
“Imagining things?”
They do. Harry thanks them for the meal, and promises to see them at the Burrow on Christmas Day, and says Sophie might have perhaps too many presents this year, and Astoria admonishes him for spoiling her. Draco was the one who bought all the presents, but Harry — in penance for his earlier jokes with Matthew — takes the blame. They linger by the front door, full of farewells, and then step into the cold night, drawing their cloaks around themselves —
They come home in the same way they draw breath, or take a step, or glance up at the stars when they're beneath the night sky. Coming home is a journey learned by rote, committed to the memory of their heart. Take a turn here, a corner there, ten steps to the front door — and they're home.
,” he says cautiously, watching the snow gouge itself from the earth, soon followed by the soil itself. In the darkness, lit only by the high stars of the Milky Way, he misses the tiny wooden box, but he hears the distinct thud, and he picks it up, brushing dirt from it. The box is plain, without markings, and held shut by a simple latch. After another glance at Draco, he flicks the latch and opens the box.
"Hermione wants to know if you're coming over for dinner tonight."
"Familiar how?" he says urgently. "This has happened before? There's been other cases?"
"Are you okay?"
Ginny raises her eyebrows, smiling. "Special occasion?"
"I promise," Harry says, "I'll do my best to find him." He hesitates, but Narcissa has been generously honest and sincere and he feels obliged to return the favour. "I...I originally thought that, too. That Malfoy had just run away to join his father." He realises he forgot to use Malfoy's given name, but Narcissa gives no indication of offence. "But I don't believe that, not anymore. I've been revisiting all the evidence...I'm working on some new observations now, actually," he says, thinking of the missing wedding ring.
And with that, the file flutters shut like a bird settling its wings.
Another long silence before Draco speaks again, still not turning to look at Harry.
"Tomorrow. Maybe the day after."
certainly attest to that, although they may belong to Matthew.
Maybe Draco would have conceded defeat after all.
it there, I can't stand her clinging to me — " Draco breaks off abruptly and, at last, turns to look at Harry. "Astoria's worse, demanding explanations. She wants answers I don't have. My mother wants reassurances I can't give. Everybody wants something, but I've got nothing left to give."
“Oh, yeah. I remember you told us about that.” Ron frowns. “To be honest, I thought you were just...”
"Yes," he says. "I'm home."
“Come on, then,” Draco says to Harry, looking irritated. But as they turn and walk to the door, his expression softens. “My Harry,” he repeats.
“Lucius would have wanted it,” his mother said as they made their way to the platform. A tremor hid in her voice, but when she spoke of his education she did so firmly, for once her eyes direct. “You must continue to learn. You must finish your schooling.”
"I'm nothing like that," Harry interrupts, annoyed. "I'm doing my best to find Malfoy."
woke up, but..."
”Here?” Harry asks with surprise, looking around. They’ve stopped along a dark, narrow road, lined with snow-touched fields. Harry glances at Draco uncertainly, then opens the door and steps out. The icy night air bites him hard, and he shivers. He doesn’t remember this place. Why would Draco choose here for their annual Christmas Eve trip?
bad, really, it’s — ”
"She said I could stay at the manor as long as I liked, of course." His voice — so level until now — suddenly lifts with suppressed anger. "I left once, isn't that enough? Merlin, I can't
Friday is the day that Harry tells Ginny he's never coming home.
"Leaving, then?" Harry asks, still trying to keep his voice light.
This time, the word lifts and carries clear across the night sky, echoing twice.
Draco pulls him closer, just a little, and Harry wonders — his pulse suddenly picking up and rushing along like a crashing wave — if Draco will kiss him.
He walks to the bedroom and sets his messenger bag — stuffed full of files — on the floor. His heart slowly sinks again. Ginny is flurrying around the room, her red hair splaying around her in a vibrant splash of colour. She turns and grins at him, her freckles scrunching up like handfuls of sand.
Harry sits back, a rush of some unidentifiable emotion crashing over him like a wave.
Harry can't argue with that. After a long moment of silence, Narcissa hands him a card and stands up.
Butterworth performs the spell. Numbers waver above the skeleton, as if caught in a shimmering heat-wave. “Five years,” he says, a note of satisfaction in his voice. He likes being right.
"I'm still impulsive."
"Draco, specifically. I'm undertaking his case." Harry hands over his badge; Zeisel scrutinises it closely before handing it back.
"Yes," Harry admits, feeling slightly defensive. "But I hate it.
"Well, that's that," Ron says heavily, dropping himself into the nearest dining chair. "You're having problems with Ginny, and Hermione is right again."
"Report from the Muggle Prime Minister, sir."
“Where’s your cactus?”
"How's Ginny?" Harry asked cautiously.
“Absolutely not!”
“Absolutely not, Potter.”
* * *
"I'll keep the carton in my home, then, and put a Disillusionment Charm on it."
This time, Astoria speaks. “How could you? I was worried sick! I was a complete mess when Draco disappeared, and you
"I never thought about it that way," she says slowly. "I suppose you're right. Falling in love is easy. Falling out of love...you don't notice until it's too late."
Harry sits back. "That's...that's really...congratulations, Ginny."
"Anyway," Hermione says encouragingly, "this is a start. What do you think it means?"
"...want some time alone?" Hermione asks. "It's all right. Just...take care of yourself." She stands up and walks from the room. Harry remains there for a long moment, staring at the white walls and dusty furniture. He's only dimly aware of Hermione still speaking to him, and it takes much effort for him to walk out of the room and go through the motions of farewelling Hermione. She gives him a suspicious look before she leaves.
Harry feels absolutely terrible about lying, and he knows he's been behaving so distant lately, and he's been dreadfully on edge this week... He waits for Ginny to say something about it, but she kisses him and wishes him luck with the case before portkeying to Swindon.
Harry glances across at Draco. "I'm not panicking." He pauses. "It
“The Shadow is with me,” Draco said and he knew Harry understood the difference without asking. The Shadow would always be with them; a quiet companion, a dark memory.
"I don't recall."
"And what did he mean by that?" Harry's intrigued despite himself.
* * *
"Nothing."
“Could be Fenwick,” he says. “He went missing March 2001. Found his broom not far from here. Might be a match.” He doesn’t get his hopes up, though; too many failed matches have taught him caution.
"You're back late," she says, idly turning a page.
She takes him to the kitchen first, however, and makes a cup of tea. For once, her husband is home. He's sitting at the dining table, Sophie nestled in his lap as she tries to build a house from blocks.
”We’re not there yet.” Draco holds out his hand. “I’m afraid the trip is too long, even for us. Magic will take us the rest of the way.”
“Sort of. He doesn’t exist completely in either space, but he doesn’t
She lifts a hand to the necklace around her neck, fingers resting on the sapphire pendant.
Matthew drives him to the test centre.
"Went to a bookstore," Draco says, noticing Harry's inquisitive look. "Seeing as you stole my only book."
* * *
Ron frowns and swaps a look with Hermione. "But...you said you didn't like your Auror work. I thought..."
"Do you?"
* * *
Even Draco's newfound patience has its limits, apparently. He gives Harry an irritated look and Harry suddenly remembers. Reality and memories, melting together and falling apart like sand thrown into the sky.
Another early start the next day; he wakes up just after sunrise. It's still another hour before breakfast is served and he whiles away the time gazing out across the cliffs. It's all he ever seems to do: stand on a balcony and stare at the world. Trains and cliffs and lights and oceans.
Draco managed a tense laugh. “Thanks. I'm fine.”
Harry arrives home at nine o'clock that night. Ginny is in bed, reading a book.
"Where are we going?" he asks Draco.
"I haven't got any qualifications," he says uncertainly.
"Draco Malfoy."
Astoria studies him for a long moment. "I met Matthew in 2001," she says. "I was in a bookshop in Exeter, and we both reached for the same book at the same time." She looks away, a small smile gracing her face. "We had a coffee together and by the end of the week, I was hopelessly in love."
at all. He clears his throat and decides to try a different lead. "Hermione, what do you know about hindering prosecution?"
"What's the point in that?" Malfoy says, and there's a strange edge to his voice that Harry's never heard before. "Sitting in a box, only going where someone else takes you."
Astoria starts to laugh.
"Oh! I didn't hear you come in. Have fun with Ron and Hermione?"
"All right," Harry says. There's some sort of restless energy about Draco. He paces to and fro, a hand trailing along the side of the counter, and Harry thinks he's like a seeker about to dart after a snitch.
They wander out to the car, a white sedan, and Harry tries to discuss monetary payment, feeling rather like Matthew should be compensated for all the inevitable moments of frustration and despair. Matthew quickly quashes that notion and instead demands Harry pays him with stories of the wizarding world.
He thinks about it all through the meal, though. People make bad choices; people become informed; people continue to make bad choices despite being informed.
Draco's lips twitched, despite himself, and he set off upstairs.
"I never said 'what's the point, sitting in a box' to you. I said it to Astoria. You just saw it in a memory."
"What?"
“So, what are you going to do this year, Harry?”
"Would you like the key?"
Draco just gives him a smug look and closes the door. A few seconds later, the hum of the shower begins.
The shopkeeper, when he sees Harry, looks at first astonished and then delighted.
* * *
Harry had conceded defeat and owled Narcissa, asking permission to fix the car and — once he received an affirmative — had booked the car for a mechanic.
"I asked him outright and he said no — "
— Ginny and me are

Harry wants to snap at Ron, tell him he doesn't understand, but he recognises how Ron thinks. It's something their Auror training hammered into them: decisions should be evidence-based, made with logic and reasoning. Not intuition and 'I just know'.
They leave the office together, Harry feeling a little more clear-headed.
"Until..." Harry prompts, and Narcissa looks away.
* * *
"Where did you learn that about chocolate, anyway?" Harry asks later on, when they're wandering past the Royal Pavilion.
Harry opens the door and steps inside the office. Holdsworth, rifling through papers on her desk, is looking at him with an expectant expression.
He's standing on the balcony, gazing out across the dark horizon of the Cornish coastline, but he turns to look at Harry after a moment.
“Leaving already, Malfoy? I’m already beating you in the Panacis Potion then,” he called out and Draco returned to his seat.
Coming home is effortless to other people.
"And she told me she's expecting you to announce the wedding date!" Hermione snaps.
Draco gives him a look. "No milk, one sugar."
"Well, some people think he was a hero." Harry looks at the sign. "One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter, as they say."
He re-read it, then scrunched it up and threw it into the fire.
And that's the opposite of failure.
Malfoy doesn't reply to his mother. He keeps staring at the family portrait. It consists of a far younger Narcissa and Lucius, Harry sees, standing each side of their son. Malfoy looks about ten or eleven and when Malfoy speaks next, he confirms Harry's estimate.
Owls hoot softly; there's the smell of living creatures in the air. The rustle of feathers, the creak of sun-warmed wood. The smell of sawdust as the field mice nest in their cages. The shop is dark and enclosed, with overhead roosts dotted with owls and the walls lined with teetering boxes of pet supplies.
"This place. I wondered if it would look different than to my earlier visits."
“Had another lover's tiff, hey, mate,” Ron said at last, coming to stand by Hermione. “Do you want to come inside, have a cup of tea?” Hermione nudged him with a sharp elbow, apparently displeased with the offer.
Once they were settled — Draco at the Hufflepuff table, Harry at Gryffindor — they sat on the closest benches to each other and Draco told Harry about his mother’s Fate’s Shadow theory.
Pansy couldn’t understand. Greg and Theo could. Their parents had been too deeply embroiled. Every act they did affected their children. Every action involved a reaction. It was like a spell rebounding. Pansy, little affected, still so sheltered, seemed to belong to a world that no longer existed, a time that no longer was.
His hands shook.
Draco was uncertain now, hesitant.
* * *
“Is there a problem —”
The surroundings construct themselves around Harry. He's standing in a hallway — most likely in the manor. Narcissa is beside him, listening intently — eavesdropping, he realises. The raised voices are drifting from a room just across from them, the door slightly ajar.
They met.
“Come in, I’d like to talk to everyone at the same time,” Harry says, and Narcissa quickly follows him inside.
Come nightfall, Harry drives to Landewednack. It's a reluctant journey. He can't stop worrying.
Ron jumped slightly then turned to him and smiled. “Yeah. I’m alright.” He paused. “Couldn’t sleep much either?”
"Where are you going?" Draco asks, sounding slightly startled.
Locked.
He decides to visit her tomorrow night.
Harry tilts his head, frowning. The shop seems a little brighter somehow. Did someone light a candle? A lantern?
"Anywhere. Draw a line on the map and I'll take us there."
"For you, I suppose." Harry's on the cusp of surrendering to sleep.
. Every now and again, there's an elaborate Celtic knot, but Harry doesn't assign that any meaning. It seems Draco was fond of simply practising the patterns during especially boring classes. There's a few notes here and there, written neatly in the margins.
Draco looked over Hermione's shoulder; at the top of the stairs, Ron sleepily rubbed at his eyes, his pyjama sleeves covering his face for a moment, hiding his expression in creased folds and shadows. Hermione looked over her shoulder, her hand still on the doorknob.
"You shrieked, admit it. For a moment, I thought I'd grabbed Astoria."
"I never do," Malfoy says, not turning his gaze from the portrait.
Four years to the day when Draco disappeared.
They stop at a level crossing, the gates swinging closed, the red warning bell blinking like a beacon in the night. As they wait for the train to come though, Draco's eyes flick to the rear-vision mirror.
"Yeah, better check St Mungo's visiting hours first," Ron says, his eyes bright and mischievous. Times like this, he reminds Harry strongly of Ginny or George.
"You didn't the other times," Draco says, his voice almost accusatory.
A faint pop, and the front door opens.
“You didn’t run away,” Harry says, his heart heavy with emotions, and he can’t tell whether it’s his own sadness or simply remnants of sorrow from Draco’s mind. “You just left for a little while. We all do.” He thinks of Ron leaving them during the search for the Horcruxes; he thinks of himself and the many times he wished for an easy death to deliver him from the choices the war imposed upon him.
The file is quite slim, and Harry would guess there's only fifteen or so cases. He dismisses the first twelve cases; the bodies were all found prior to 2003. The thirteenth case consists of nothing more than a partial jawbone found in woodland in Devon, and Harry dismisses that one. The fourteenth sets the age at 50-70.
“Harry! I hope you didn’t have plans for Saturday!”
Harry enters the memory again. This time — having gotten an outline of the entire incident — he focuses on tiny details instead. It feels strange to do so, but he walks straight up to Malfoy, eyes narrowed, checking for anything noticeable. He’s wearing a white button-up shirt beneath the robes, Harry notices, and neatly-pressed grey trousers. Was he expecting to go somewhere requiring formal business wear? The robes are good quality but ordinary; robes that any wealthy wizard might choose to wear to run errands.
"Why'd we stop?" Harry asks at last, shaking away the memories.
"And Draco said the same."
Harry slows down as a cat runs across the road, thinking of Godric's Hollow and all the lights twinkling in the snow. The only Christmas he ever truly spent at home, and suddenly he misses it more than anything.
It's easy to do.
"I don't know." Draco glances away from the mirror, his gaze locking onto Harry instead. "I have...difficulties sometimes, telling the difference between dreams and memories and reality."
Harry's heart suddenly aches for all of them. Hermione and Ron, so unknowing of what lay ahead; Neville who would one day be tortured by Death Eaters; and yes, even Draco, who had clearly dreamed of a different future.
Draco Malfoy was melting like ice. Fading like a ghost. They could see him, his head bent low, creeping along the walls, not looking at anyone, hunched over as though trying to disappear into the stone beside him. He was too scared to lift his head, to look into somebody’s eyes, in case of what he saw.
He should have taken Draco straight to St Mungo's. When Astoria and Narcissa realise he kept Draco hidden for nearly four days, they'll be furious with him. And he'll deserve their wrath.
Harry opens his mouth, thinks for a moment, then shuts it again. Draco looks at him.
Draco looks at him.
* * *
you. I said, if nobody tells me about the Niffler – ”
have known he was talking about Lucius Malfoy," Harry says, remaining seated.
A small silver snitch clasp.
"Not his broom, at least."
“How I disappeared.”
"Well?" Matthew says.
There's a slight pause in conversation between Malfoy and the shopkeeper. Harry, aware of the unusual silence, frowns and lifts his gaze.
“His hands shake all the time,” Harry said quietly. “When I go down there alone, it’s all I hear in that empty silence. Just a spoon, clinking on a bowl.”
"You're lucky you didn't hit them — "
“Well, I'm tired and my patience is wearing thin. I'm sick of this.”
"I can't hear you," he says quietly, and Draco stops speaking. His shoulders slump slightly. He walks towards Harry, and the moonlight filters through him like he's no more substantial than water, and Harry realises that Draco is struggling just to exist here. Whatever is left of his strength is not enough to speak, not enough to appear solid. He's like a ghost. When he's just a few steps away from Harry he reaches out, and Harry responds without thinking, outstretching his own hand.
“Oh, that’s a nice way to greet your oldest friend, isn’t it?” Ron drops into the chair opposite Harry’s desk.
godfather — ”
“And this is of consequence because…?” Hermione asked but Harry looked. Yes, on the second floor, in a lonely and dusty classroom. His face was a blur, his hands against the window like pale butterflies flickering behind dusty glass.
She looks at him, then at the pudding. “Of course you are,” she says meaningfully. “Can I have a second serving?”
Hermione is looking at him, her eyes still narrowed and expression unchanged. Ron is shaking his head and giving Harry a pitying expression.
"Yeah, Percy said it was a terrible name too. Then they all started arguing and George turned Percy's ears into turnips and Bill couldn't stop laughing, so Percy called him a long-haired pillock and..." Ron winces as there's a thump from downstairs followed by laughter and, moments later, an outraged squeal.
He turns and nearly jumps. Astoria stands just behind him, her face pale. Her robes — black and plain — billow and snap in the wind like the sails of a storm-tossed boat.
* * *
* * *
Everything, he thinks. Everything.
"Theory test certificate?"
“Draco isn't feeling well,” he said, and although Slughorn made a great show of saying 'hmm' and 'we'll see', he agreed to help. Harry dropped copious hints about how he considered Slughorn to be one of his favourite professors. Slughorn cheered up a lot after that and was a lot more amiable about giving Draco his Panacis potion.
"I know." Harry stares down at the table, fingers tracing patterns in the wood. "Sounds like a forced disappearance, doesn't it?"
“I can’t sleep,” Draco said truthfully. “The Shadow follows me.” The only word he could think of for it.
Harry hesitated, then turned and walked away.
“It's just another silly argument,” Hermione said, a little unkindly. “Have a Calming Drought, go to bed. He'll be back tomorrow morning. He always is.”
, she had told her father once, and on the day they bought the apartment, she had laughed with the joy of achieving a long-lost childhood dream.
The next morning Harry was sitting at the Ravenclaw table. Draco sat at the Hufflepuff table. They tried very hard not to look across at each other. Draco looked at what used to be Snape’s chair. Harry gazed across at the lake, watching the squid poke curiously at something.
“This feels — refreshing.” Hermione was smiling, pushing her hair behind her ears; Ron was playing a game of chess against Luna. “Harry, doesn’t it feel different?”
He blinks, then slowly drops his hand.
"How much did that cost?" Harry asks as they're driving back to Landewednack.
Draco inched longingly towards a small gap of corridor, looking caught between the two groups. Harry frowned at him before returning his attention to Zacharias.
Dawn is arriving, Harry thinks, gazing past Draco to the glass sliding doors. It's little more than a pale blue smudge on the horizon, hesitantly touching the low stars. For a moment, he could dream of it all. Travelling on and on, driving forever with Draco. To the vast mountain ranges of Scotland, and the rivers and waterfalls of the Peak District, and they'll go stargazing in the Dark Sky Reserves, and see Wiltshire's wildflowers in bloom, and the canola harvests, and every year they'll return to Snowdonia to stand on the edge of the world, and Harry's favourite memories will be strung with tiny Christmas lights and the winter winds of the Cornish coastline.
"She sold it," Draco says.
"Harry."
“I have other errands to run,” Malfoy says, giving the shopkeeper a handful of galleons. The shopkeeper nods.
Harry glances at Draco. "What?"
He takes the train home. The first day of summer is blossoming into a lazy afternoon; couples stroll leisurely along Regent Street, gazing at window displays, and even the punishing crowds of Oxford Street seem less rushed than usual.
and Harry can't let go of that because every time he hears Ginny call the apartment a box in the sky he experiences a crippling sense of loss and self-doubt. Draco, whose absence Harry can't stop thinking about, and isn't it funny that Draco is never
"The last job I took before I worked in Investigative, I spent a week — the entire
Draco's still staring at Harry like he's a new species of dragon.
"Stop panicking, Potter."
Harry had been expecting a triumphant I-told-you-so. Something smug, something irritating. But that smug Draco was long ago washed away by war and weariness.
He turns onto the road and accelerates until the scenery is flying past, until the dark fields wash away like tides, until it feels like he's driving through the night sky itself, and a thousand moments seem to come together in one rush of exhilaration: Draco and Astoria driving by the river, Harry standing in his apartment and watching the train lights disappear into darkness, and for a moment he sees everything perfectly.
It's almost terrifying because Draco's so damn decisive. When he sees a yellow light, he hits the accelerator; when he steers around a corner, he only slows down minimally. When he stops at the lights, he stops very close to the next car. He maintains the speed limit precisely and never pauses — even when a car swerves in front of them unexpectedly, Draco simply steers smoothly to the right and eases off the accelerator slightly.
Five minutes later, Harry watches a hawk-owl fly out from the owlery, its wings spread against the blue sky, the faint outline of a letter upon its leg as it disappears into the distance.
“Don’t let me miss the Birmingham exit.”
"It's strange," she says, "to see someone sitting in it. Can you drive?"
"You're a good listener. People like that."
"How was
"Yes, I recall that."
"No," Harry admits. "I mean, with Floo networks and portkeys and Apparating and everything, it seemed a bit redundant to get my licence."
His guess is correct. He reads the letter briefly.
"You've got a scar," Draco observes and Harry, surprised, follows Draco's gaze. The streetlight faintly shines silver on Harry's skin, picking out the thread of letters.
"He went to Truro a week before he disappeared."
Work is the same. He went missing for three weeks — three weeks — no notice given, no warning — and anyone else would be fired, dismissed, sent away without references. While his supervisors lecture him —
He remembers reading the same sign in the first week of December and it feels like a lifetime ago.
"There's a certain duality about it, yes."
"Visiting hours are over. Right."
"No." Harry shakes his head, then he laughs. The sound is far louder than he expected. Rather than being absorbed into the land, it echoes far across the field, flows up into the clear night sky. "Not anymore. Last summer, when I was working another case, I found some bones here." He exhales in a quick huff of air. "Now here I am again."
"You could've been a lot more supportive," Harry mutters, sitting down beside Ron and opening the butterbeer. "I'm your oldest friend."
"Yes," Harry says, but truth be told he's hardly paying attention to the conversation now. He doesn't think he's ever been this close to Draco and he wonders how he never noticed the faint flecks of slate-blue hiding in his grey irises.
He goes to a nearby pub for dinner but he returns just an hour later, unable to enjoy himself despite the pleasant meal and scenic walk back to the guesthouse. The receptionist seems to guess at his question before he says a word.
"Thanks," he says distantly. "Have a good weekend, Butterworth."
By the end of the hour, Harry has managed to successfully drive to the end of the driveway without giving either himself or Matthew whiplash. That, Matthew declares, deserves a butterbeer.
Draco turns away from the window, then, and looks at Harry. "Anywhere?"
Harry's watch ticks quietly, marking the seconds. It's midnight and they stand together, holding hands, beneath a sky so clear that Harry can see the luminous stars of Orion, the interstellar plumes of the Milky Way. He can see Sirius burning bright, he can even see the faint star of Eltanin, the head of the Draco constellation.
"Still asleep? It's nearly noon," Hermione says. "Ron says you weren't at work yesterday. You know, the last thing you need is to get sick. You've been so stressed lately, Harry, and I know things have been very difficult, especially with Malfoy's case — "
“Nothing,” retorted Zacharias mutinously but there was a silence. He shifted about, looked at some of the group for support, then seemed to feel inclined to fill the silence. “Just walking around, discussing stuff.” He paused. “You know. Death Eaters, that kind of stuff. Murderers.”
"No," Draco says at once, and hurt blossoms like a bruise in Harry's heart. Draco glances in the rear-vision mirror before he changes lanes, overtaking a slow car. When he speaks next, his voice is softer. "For that to happen, we'd have to reverse eight years of assumptions and change our beliefs, our values." Draco shakes his head. "Impossible."
A Healer steps into the room and clears their throat. "Apologies, but — "
Ron winces. “Malfoy’s splinched between two dimensions?”
Harry pauses. “
Possibly, Harry thinks, the final piece of the puzzle.
"Muggle shops don't tend to accept galleons," Draco says with a shrug. "Easiest way to buy petrol."
“Yeah, Draco,” he said. “The darkness.”
He doesn't know what to do. And it's ridiculous, but he's terrified of saying the wrong thing, of sending Draco straight back out that door. He wants to demand explanations and answers, yes, but now isn't the time. Draco looks so exhausted, like he's been through hell and back, and so Harry simply remains silent and waits.
"Or books that other people have left lying around and you've picked them up, skimmed a few paragraphs, and put them back down again."
"Not the memory. The store itself."
," he says, and Narcissa starts. "I know of a saying similar to that.
— but Draco is silent. Harry looks at him. He suits a storm. His pale complexion and white-blond hair seem almost luminescent against the charcoal-grey clouds.
"My mother will be worrying," he says.
Draco finally looks up, glancing at Harry before tapping his wand against the owl clasp on his cloak. It immediately curls in on itself, smaller and smaller, until it resembles a tiny marble. It fades to silver a moment later, and small wings form along it.
"Draco," Harry repeats. "This is real."
Well, perhaps Draco is still here. Just invisible, beyond human touch.
"What?" Harry asks.
"That's actually a good point," he admits.
, Harry can almost hear Teddy saying. The stars. Every year Teddy requests it without fail, and every year Draco shrugs and says,
Harry sits in the passenger side of the Renault for a long time, listening to engine tick as it cools.
But it's certainly new to be worrying about Draco Malfoy.
"Was that a compliment?"
Later on, in the deep darkness of the night, Harry dreams of the long highways and dark fields, the endless roads all leading into a dawn the colour of canola fields, the colour of autumn leaves, the colour of a lazy summer afternoon. He gazes into the bright blaze of the cloudless sky, then steps forward.
Harry leaves early the next morning, before Ginny wakes; he has an 8:30am meeting with the family solicitor who, he discovers, is a tall, broad-shouldered witch who reminds him somehow of Madame Maxime. She ushers Harry into her office — a small room clearly designed by a fan of minimalism. He'd been expecting something extravagant for a solicitor worthy of the Malfoys, but there's little more than a set of filing cabinets, a glass table, and two chairs.
“I was, I think. Just for a minute or two.” Draco doesn’t open his eyes.
“Albus,” Harry announces.
Hermione looks around the owlery. She'd agreed to visit the pensieve memory with him, if only for Harry to demonstrate his success.
They set off across the car park, past the lighthouse. Its curved wall gleams white in the moonlight, but it quickly recedes into the distance as they walk onwards, onwards, until the earth is soft and green beneath their feet and the white cliffs are rising from the darkness like pale ghosts. Harry sits on the edge of a craggy rock, listening to the waves roll in and looking at Draco. He stands with his back to Harry, gazing out into the sea. The moon, shrouded in cloud, affords little illumination.
It lists the usual details. Nationality, sex, height, weight, physical characteristics, clothing when last seen. None of it is anything unexpected. The ‘distinguishing features’ section notes the Dark Mark on the left forearm, of course, and a ‘small crescent-shaped scar on the lower back’. Malfoy seems slightly underweight, Harry notes, frowning at the height/weight section.
magazines that should have been thrown out long ago, one of the fake galleons Hermione made for Dumbledore's Army, a broom compass, a Weasley jumper, Sirius's penknife.
“Yes, too late for candles, too early for daylight. And there’s someone at the Slytherin table,” Hermione commented. Harry looked up.
“You’ve grown up a lot over summer,” he said finally.
Harry frowns and stands up, realising it's later than he thought. He farewells Astoria and Matthew and Floos to the apartment, grateful to find Ginny still hasn't returned from practice. He wants some time alone. Time to think.
That night, however, after he's returned to the apartment and kissed Ginny goodnight, he sits at the kitchen counter and unpacks Draco's life again.
Boxing Day. The city will be crowded with shoppers: fashionable couples sashaying along the luxury labels of Bond Street, young families and bargain-hunters caught up in the masses at Westfield.

Harry paused, absently eating another crust that Draco suspected he had saved specifically for flicking purposes.
Hermione turns up at five o'clock, after work's finished. Harry had sent her and Ron away when they first arrived, saying they couldn't do anything anyway and they both had to return to work. They left reluctantly, promising to return in the evening.
"He wouldn't have done that," Harry repeats adamantly. Hermione looks at him for a long moment.
"Stop quizzing Harry, he's here to talk about the case," Astoria says, and Matthew shrugs.
On the third day, Draco traces a finger along the maps of the south-west coast and says they're going to Cornwall.
Narcissa pauses for a long moment. Harry's Auror training begins to prickle at his skin like a long-forgotten high summer heat. She knows something.
"We used to sleep in our offices, and survive off sandwiches from the nearest café," Ron says, grinning. "It was great though, wasn't it?"
"Oh, there's all sorts of charms. And if worst comes to worst, you can always Obliviate a Muggle if they've seen something they shouldn't," Astoria says, arriving with a bowl of roasted chestnuts.
"She's awful," he says, gesturing to Astoria. "Tells me all about this amazing world, then complains every time I try and ask questions! 'Oh, Matt, it's just a castle in Scotland, why are you so interested' or 'it's called Flooing and I'm in no mood to explain it'."
Harry subsides into — if he's honest with himself — a sulk. Draco pays for two rooms and makes the fatal mistake of inquiring about the east-coastal walking track; the woman immediately launches into an enthusiastic (if one-sided) conversation about the local flora and fauna. Draco manages to politely extract himself fifteen minutes later and they make their escape to their rooms.
He unlocks the cabinet and stares into the silvery depths of the pensieve, frowning.
But that night he dreams of the river again, the road, and Draco’s driving on and on and Harry thinks he’ll stay there forever.
Owls hoot softly; there’s the smell of living creatures in the air. The rustle of feathers, the creak of sun-warmed wood. The smell of sawdust as the field mice nest in their cages. The shop is dark and enclosed, the overhead roosts dotted with owls and the walls lined with teetering boxes of pet supplies.
“Yeah, I know. Sorry,” Harry had managed, giving the pale hand a squeeze. Draco had always had strong, certain hands. Now they were weak, always trembling. Helpless. Hopeless. The word had sprung into Harry's mind and he had pushed Draco away, fleeing, running back home, like the coward he knew he was.
He looks up. Draco is studying him. Years ago, he thinks, Draco would have said something acerbic by now.
He pauses. "I...I just want to say I understand now. What you meant when you said that solving cases isn't a game of Quidditch, and people aren't snitches."
They lapse into a natural silence. Harry starts the car again, his route decided, and merges onto the road. He hopes Draco will stay there, just watching the world pass by, but after a few minutes Draco speaks again.

Harry opens his mouth to protest, spots Hermione narrowing her eyes at him, and quickly changes tack. "All right," he says instead. "I'm going away for the weekend, anyway."
A knock on the door. Ron will be there —
"What were the last words Malf— Draco said to you?" he says impulsively. He's mildly curious, but it's partially a test to see if Narcissa will freely give personal information.
"Me?" he says incredulously. "You're the one giving the silent treatment!"
And Draco, he lived. A miracle. A war. Him and Harry at the heart of it. Him in hiding, a coward; Harry brave, walking towards his death unarmed and unafraid.
He straightens up. No. It would never work.
He wonders if he'll ever see that level of passion again.
But now, six months into his assignment, he still doesn’t understand the lesson he’s supposed to be learning.
They had carved a reminder just in case Draco chose to sit there again. The head of a snake was engraved in the wood, its neck ending in torn flesh and sinew.

He looks across the room, to the dining table. A quill and inkwell in one corner, the edges of the table already gathering dust again since his last Scourgify. The white walls gleam, untouched by pictures or photographs.
Winter slowly melts to spring. Ginny sends Harry a postcard from France, where she’s visiting the French National Team to gauge their performance. A letter follows soon after: she’s purchased a studio apartment closer to central London.
Afterwards, when they’ve returned to their home, they peel off their water-heavy cloaks and damp clothes, and Harry lounges about invitingly by the warmth of the fire and pretends he’s got no idea what Draco’s little glances mean, until Draco gets fed up and drags him to the bedroom.
"Can you give me any details about the meeting?"
"You can't stay where you are. You're Head Auror."
They stop for the night in Bournemouth. After they've found a suitable bed-and-breakfast and booked their respective rooms, Draco asks Harry if he's going to tell the Healers.
Hermione lifts her hair with dignity and wrings it out. “It’s a boy. Come to dinner on Sunday, you can suggest some names. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must go and hex Draco.”
“Fine,” Harry says, sitting back and folding his arms across his chest. “I won’t name anything, then!”
"Fine."
“...your essay is a day late. Again. Are you sure you’re ready for NEWT level potions?”
Malfoy turns and takes a step closer to the owls, nearly walking into Harry; Harry instinctively ducks away.
There was a click. His fingers paused in their noiseless tune. The light spilled out into the darkness, lighting him up, outlining his rough hair, illuminating his wild eyes.
But, but— Harry hadn’t seen anything but he had felt heat on the side of his hand. He might have imagined it, he might have wished to feel that heat. But.
“What the hell Blaise?” Ron was saying, deeply affronted.
Regulus didn’t say anything else, but the “ah” was enough. A short but firm stroke of velvet.
The car was idling in the parking lot. Pit, call me Pit, we are friends, aren’t we Karol?; Pit would
An Apple Pie, because Harry loved both and he could never decide, on the few occasions they went to MacDonald’s to celebrate.
Harry made a new mark under Regulus’ name on the row for “Seizures, small.” He also had to add an adjective to describe Fred’s bleeding. Something like “entire” or “total.”
is returning, he will go after Harry. We shouldn’t leave the child alone”.
Draco passed Regulus his wand and Harry gave his to Fred because it was quicker than searching for the other wands. They also tried with Luna’s.
“This is nice” said Draco out of nowhere while Harry focused on the delicate task of playing Exploding Snap with a muggle card deck that had been experimentally modified to make it snap randomly. His fingers were still smarting from one of the last blasts.
Which is a relief because they had very nice sex and Harry would like to think they were both present for it.
Draco didn’t say, but his face said he had a suggestion and it wasn’t physically possible in any case.
There had been absolutely no good reason for Harry to be in the Department of Mysteries. None. Yet there he was, after telling himself that the line to the lifts was too long and that he could take the stairs. He had stopped on sub-level nine and crossed the corridor that went to the Entrance Chamber with the moving doors.
Twas the night before Christmas and Mrs Zabini’s house was alive with the light of a fire in the hearth and the playful glint of the chandelier hanging over her table. There was the clink of glasses touching each other after a toast, silverware and jewellery, and the sound of many voices making merry together.
They called it the yard.
“Why would the new Head of the Department of Mysteries leave the former Head alive?” Draco said as if he were studying a lesson or giving a presentation. “Why leave an enemy to come back and kill you? Nobody does that. Only Voldemort, and that unwillingly.”
two months shy of fourteen, luck had little to do with it and it was thanks to the months of private tutoring with Lupin.
No one else would see it that way, though. It was just Harry. If pressed, they might admit that the expression in Draco’s eyes was terrible. The kind of expression that could sink twenty ships.
