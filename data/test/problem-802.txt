Draco nodded and cast a featherweight charm on Celeste, picking her up bridal style and carrying her to their rooms.

Draco sighed. “If you come outside with me, I’ll let you fly without a broom.” He prodded.
Ginny bit her lip. “But… You’ll be all alone.”
“With you guys on my side, I think I’ll be just fine.” Draco said happily.

“Where is it?” Harry asked. “Is it in Britain, like your Manor?”
Draco kissed Harry deeply, pulling the dark-haired teen against him and wrapping his arms around him. “Just never hurt me, and I’m yours.” He said finally, staring into Harry’s eyes. “
“Good. If it happens any earlier, there are potions we could use—as a last resort
Harry cupped his mate’s ass through the jeans he was wearing and groaned as Draco’s erection slid over his own. He shivered as Draco responded with another thrust of his hips, and Harry realized that the blonde was frotting against him. He gripped Draco’s hips, thrusting up against the Slytherin desperately, panting.
“Thank you for removing them before I hurt myself. Or Carina.” Celeste said softly.
Harry sighed, letting Draco go. He groaned, then headed to the entrance of the shower room, seeing Draco brushing his hair in front of the mirror. “Sorry. I was out of line. A bastard, even. It was absolutely vile of me. Still friends?” He asked hopefully.
detail. “Yeah,” He finally answered. “I saw. But I don’t have the energy to do it myself now.” He spat.
He moved on to the lower back, pulling the blanket down with him. He continued his trail of kisses down Harry’s back, stopping at the base of his spine to suck a small, red hickey into existence. “No
Harry helped Draco out of his tuxedo, dropping it piece by piece on the floor. His hands were clumsy and trembling, but Draco found that, paired with his blush and the way he was biting his lip, endearing. Harry was nervous, but he was sure in why he was doing this.
Celeste laughed. “I love you. Weirdness and all.”
Harry moaned softly as Draco carefully stretched him, brushing against his prostate. Harry was sure the movements were not accidental. “Draco,
“I’m not going to miss my first child’s birth, Love. There’d be no excuse for that.” He said flatly.
‘Maybe if I wait, the urge will pass.’ He decided, hearing angry muttering coming through the door still.
This wraps up the series, sorry if it seems a bit rushed, but it was getting harder and harder to focus on this one, and besides that, bed rest is boring to read.
“Little Carina decides to wait until the date we’ve planned on. It’s the best option for everybody.” She said firmly. “Now, remember, sex is permitted if you can find a good position that doesn’t squish the baby or leave the belly dangling—no ‘doggy style,’ boys.” Poppy waved a finger at them as both Harry and Draco flushed, then shook her head. “Honestly, if you can’t
Harry stood as Severus walked up to the table he was at in front of Florean Fortescue’s ice cream parlor. “Sir.” He said happily, then sat down, arranging his red day dress around his legs carefully.
Draco got annoyed after Nott had spent the past ten minutes pawing his legs and chest, running his hands hungrily all over his body. He had never before had to suffer through helping out a friend in need without at least enjoying it himself.
Draco flushed. “Well, I shouldn’t call my boyfriend by his surname, should I?” He asked, smiling shyly.
Draco frowned as he puzzled over what Harry had meant, then his eyes widened, and he got up. He chased down the brunet and stopped him in the hall outside the Slytherin dorms. “What are you

“This is cozy.” Draco remarked in amusement as Harry pulled the blond onto his lap, holding him close.
"Yes, they recognize my magic there, and that hasn't changed." Harry explained. "I just need to speak with Griphook personally again."
aren’t you glad I brought you here?” He teased.
Harry turned over, and Draco’s smile rapidly faded.
“Okay, that’s enough.” He decided, trying to sit up.
“Thank you, Madam Pomfrey.” Celeste said, staring rapturously down at her brand new daughter. “For everything.”
Draco opened his lips, allowing his friend entrance, and then fighting the urge to recoil. It felt… Wrong. It wasn’t unpleasant, just wrong. Something was off. It could be that Nott was simply not a good kisser, but that didn’t seem to be it.
“Come on, let's get into the room and start deciding what to bring over when we go. Might even be time for a quick tumble before dinner.” Draco added with a leer.
“NU!” Harry yelled. “Nu vreau sa fii agitat!”(I don’t want you to be nervous!)
Pansy smiled slowly, licking her lips. “That was wonderful, boys, thank you for letting me watch. It'll be our little secret.” She assured them. “Have a good night.” She said brightly, then left them alone again.
Draco nodded. “We’ve found that out.”
His confusion only increased when instead of an answer, Draco’s face rapidly flushed a bright red.
Harry and Draco rushed up to the dormitory and threw their discarded clothing back on, blushing furiously both at being caught like that and their ruined make-out session. Draco was finally comfortable with nudity, and they were slowly exploring each other’s bodies, getting used to each other while they had time.

Draco brought her over to her mother, and Celeste looked down at her. “Carina.” She breathed.
He screamed as Nott forced his way in, tearing delicate tissues and causing blood to at least ease the friction that was causing Draco to sob and scream and tremble.

“Hey, Harry?”

Harry skidded into the Great Hall, Draco hot on his tail, and froze in shock.

Draco ran a leg over Harry’s, enjoying the closeness, even as a bit of nervousness intruded. If Harry wanted more, Draco would give in, though he knew he wasn’t quite ready for that yet.
Draco chuckled softly. “The area atop the hill is very windy, and can be downright chilly in every season but summer. But the house is aptly named. It’s very warm and the windows are extra thick, so it truly
Draco grimaced, gesturing at the books around him. “Theory. Need to know what I’m doing, after all.”
And maybe it did.
Harry smiled. "All right. I'll withdraw it next Hogsmeade weekend."
“I’m glad you approve. I'd never ask you to live in a place you didn’t like.” Draco said. “But I definitely don’t want to live in Malfoy Manor with Mother there. Visiting is one thing, living with her quite another.”
Harry decided that now was as good a time as any to let his friends and surrogate family know who he was with. He took Draco’s hand, leading the blond to the Gryffindor table.
“Karma’s cold.” Harry said, grinning. “Now get out and let’s go get dried off and stuff our faces in the name of victory.”
Draco just sighed and took off the invisibility cloak. “I’m supposed to join you for the lessons. I’m a Legilimens, and Sev thinks I can help you. Plus, he wants a break.”
“Wha-“
“Potter, silk? I’m impressed.” He said approvingly.

Draco had been monumentally patient with Harry’s cravings, but apparently, there was a limit to what he could handle watching his beloved eat.
Finally, after what seemed an eternity of pain and degradation, Nott grunted several times and released the spell, then lay down next to Draco, murmuring, “You’ll thank me someday, Draco. Gods, that was good.” As he drifted off.
“Vanteera.” Fred breathed. “Dear Merlin, they still exist. Malfoy, you’re…”
There was a desk in the corner, and a wardrobe along one wall. It was surprisingly bare, but Celeste just assumed Lucius had spent more time in another room, and didn’t need many accoutrements in this one.
“Oh?” Harry pressed his chest against the blonde’s. “I think you’re lying.” He felt a surge of smugness and desire run through him as Draco’s face heated. “Looks like I’m right. Do you really think I can’t see your reaction to my thoughts? You tried to become you in my fantasy. You

“So, what do you want for your birthday?” Draco asked, eyeing Harry’s wet body as the teen grabbed a towel.
Draco looked up from his textbook from where he lay, sprawled over Harry’s bed. “Hm. I’ve always been fond of Delphini, for a girl.” He told Harry with a small smile on his face. “And with your delicate build, the super-feminine name will suit her, because she’ll likely be on the small side.”
“Oh.” Harry said. “Is it isolated?” He asked. “I'm not sure I want our children to grow up without neighbours, without

Draco chuckled. "I don't think there's anything in this world that can stop it if you actually fuck me now." He told Harry.
Draco nodded. “How many more weeks?”
Draco jumped, turning to see Harry looking at him. “Privacy not one of your strong points, Potter?!” He sneered, covering himself. Or, rather, trying, as his hands didn’t quite do the job.
Harry smiled at him gratefully. “Well, Draco turned seventeen on the fifth, right?”
Harry groaned, opening sleepy eyes. “Stai—”(Stay—) He said, raising into one arm.
“He’s creepy.” Blaise said.
Severus frowned. “I need to talk to someone, and you are the only option I have.”
Harry groaned. “Happy birthday to me.” He grumbled.
They moved together, rushing toward their peak, Pansy watching with eager eyes, taking in the entire tableau, likely committing it to memory.
“I can wait until you change. I'm in the mood to bottom tonight, anyway. Been waiting a long time.” Draco said.
Draco took Harry’s hand. “We can talk about it
Harry chuckled and jumped onto the bed, curling around Draco. “Fa-o sa plece.”(Make her go.) Harry whined at Draco.

“Keep going!” Draco breathed. “Don’t you

Harry flushed. “Sorry, Sir. I really am. I was helping Draco to use his elemental—”
Harry nodded. “Alright. I can wait as long as it takes. There’s no rush, just let me know if you ever get it figured out.” He said.

Severus raised an approving eyebrow. “It would seem we can only look forward from here.”
Draco’s eyes widened, but he complied.
Harry shrugged. “When we move on to the combat aspect of using elemental magic, he needs someone strong to be casting curses at him so he can work on repelling them.” He explained.
He bottled Draco's potion himself, feeling a strange mixture of dread and elation as he watched Draco help "Celeste" gather her things and head back to the common room.
The elf popped into the room. “Yes, Master?”
“Get up, Potter.”
Nott stared at Draco’s ethereal body, then licked his lips. He slowly ran his hands up the slender legs, realizing that Draco used depilatory charms not only on his legs, but also on his underarms and possibly chest. He looked like a girl, or at least androgynous. He stopped when he got to the boxers, skipping them and laying both hands on Draco’s stomach, resuming his path up the teen’s chest to cup his face, then leaning in for another deep kiss.

Draco could only cry and pray for the brutal act to end, as Nott panted and grunted in exertion over his body.
Harry whined, curling around him tighter. “Nu.” He said.
Two weeks later…
Draco smiled. “Right. We have to be off now. Feel free to send an Owl, you'd be the perfect person to show us around the village when we properly move in. I haven’t been out this way in
Harry blushed, grinning sheepishly. “Sorry?” He offered. “I was going to come if you did that again, so I panicked.” He explained.
Draco narrowed his eyes. “You bastard.”
Nott grinned. “Fine, keep your girly secrets. Have you got your money? Thought we could go shopping for a bit.”
“Has he ever hurt you?” Harry asked sharply.
Harry chuckled. “All right, no need to get bitchy.” He said, positioning himself and gently pushing in.
Draco smiled in relief. “Well, it’s
Harry nodded.

Harry rolled his eyes and sheathed his sword. “Ma voi antrena mai mult.”(I will train more.) He said wryly.
“Sounds like fun.” Celeste said with a smile.
Harry’s eyes widened. “You look like your father when you do that.” He said in shock.
Draco stood and walked up to her, wrapping his arms around her. “Don’t worry about it. I’m sorry, too. We’ll just put this behind us and move on, shall we?” He asked, pulling back a bit and smiling winningly at his wife. “So, what do you say we go into your room and brainstorm with Pansy and Millie, so you have a list of questions for either my mum or Arabella, whomever you decide to ask to see, hm?”
Celeste rolled over and glared at him. “So what did I wake up to?!”
“Well, you’re going to keep it up, because your blood pressure is higher than I’d like!” Pomfrey told her firmly.
Draco's fingers traced idle circles over the roundness, lulling Harry into a doze. “Are you still awake?” He asked a bit later.
Draco smiled, but it didn't quite reach his eyes. "Yeah, sure." He was going to miss Harry's female body, but then again, this was what Harry wanted. "I'm happy for you." He said.

Draco melted into the kiss, letting Harry lead him back to the loveseat, lying down with Draco atop him.

Harry huffed out a laugh. “I’m willing to make certain allowances.” He denied, getting up and smacking Draco on the arse as he pulled out his uniform and started dressing.

Harry watched from a distance, getting impatient. “Well? Did it work?”
Harry leaned in to kiss him again, then nodded. “Sure. Mione is leaving soon. Should… We go to… Our new room? After?” He asked, smiling slightly as he flushed at the thought of sharing a private room, and the promise that Draco had made about what they would finally be doing tonight.
Unfortunately, Draco quickly noticed what his hair was up to and stopped to use a quick charm. His hair fell straight, looking as though he had just combed it.
“You spoil me.” Harry said lightly.

“Draco, grow up! We’re going to be near the Hufflepuffs, we need to choose something suitable for the first-years to overhear.” Harry said.

Harry was still lying in bed nude when Draco returned, except that now he was no longer hard and had a sated smile on his face.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Nott, you’ve been rubbing me for long enough. There’s nothing more for you here. Now that you know what you like, you can go out and find someone to give you the rest.” He said dismissively.

“What is the password to the Marauder’s Map?” The Werewolf’s eyes were narrowed.

Finally, Harry pushed his tongue through the tiny ring, and was rewarded with a high-pitched moan of pleasure. Draco’s body trembled beneath his, and the blond pushed back on his tongue, short staccato moans escaping his mouth. Harry thrust with his tongue as well as he could, before he finally gave in and added a finger, pushing it in gently and pulling it out, feeling Draco’s passage quivering around both his tongue and his finger.
Harry smiled at her. “Thanks. That actually means a lot more to me than you’d think. Will you stick by it when Ron finds out?”
Draco’s eyes narrowed. “You’d better watch your mouth, Golden Boy.” He warned.

Harry frowned. “For...?”
Harry laid on the bed, hungrily staring in the doorway of the bathroom, watching Draco inside in only his boxers, brushing his teeth and getting ready for bed.

Harry frowned at him. “I don’t remember asking you to do that.” He said.

Celeste was getting up from breakfast, about to go to class, when her eyes rolled back into her head and she fainted dead away. Blaise, who had been standing beside her talking to Draco, caught her.
Harry grinned. “Well, the first one was kind of expected. He was old, his heart almost couldn’t handle the consummation as it was. The second time just finished him off.” He told her. “Arabella and I laughed over it when she told me how she’d been dreading having to sleep with him again, and then he died just as things were getting heated.”

Some, of course, will not be there, but they will most likely be in the astronomy tower and in the room of requirement. They aren’t interested in seeing us and not many couples find the dungeons romantic.” Draco sneered the word, leading Harry out of the bathroom, hands entwined.
Harry was out of the room in record time.
They got to the Hospital Wing and Madam Pomfrey noticed them, gasping. “Dear me, what happened? Quickly, get her into bed.”

“Magic,” Harry said, drawing his wand and summoning a pot of tea and two cups, along with sugar and milk, “Is not something that can be explained. You have it, or not. I think elemental magic would be the same. Either you can use it,” Harry poured himself and Draco tea and added milk and sugar to his, then stirred and took a sip, smiling, “Or not.” He finished.
“Well, that’s most likely where the problem stems from. It’s hard to feel sexy when you’re feeling sick, Dear.” She reached over and patted his hand. “Don’t worry, your morning sickness may abate in a few weeks, and your sex drive will return when you’re no longer feeling sick all the time.”
Draco rolled his eyes. He sat up and faced Nott. “You can kiss and touch. But the boxers will stay on, and you can’t touch under them. Fair?”
Fred nodded. “You have my word. George and I will keep absolute silence. Can I?” He asked, looking at Draco’s wings.
Suddenly, another presence invaded Harry’s mind, though it just slid in gently, helping Harry force the other presence out.

Draco let Harry carry him up to the dormitory, laying him gently on the bed, then climbing in and pulling the covers over their waists, as the dormitory stayed warm this time of year.
Harry grabbed a pillow and shoved it in Draco’s face.
Draco pressed a line of soft kisses down the top of Harry’s spine, stopping right between the base of both shoulders. “Nothing on the upper back, either.” He whispered, his voice sounding just the slightest bit breathless.

Draco looked up at him, honesty shining in his eyes and said simply, “I love you.”
Harry’s eyes widened. “How far?” He asked, afraid he already knew the answer.
Harry sighed. “Come on, Princess. Let’s get down to breakfast.”
“To visit Windhaven, and make sure it’s ready when we need it.” Draco told him, sitting next to his husband.
Draco felt his wings erupt from his back, fluttering behind him happily, dousing them with cooling droplets of the water still streaming from the showerhead they were under. “Tonight.” He whispered against Harry’s lips. “You need it, and I think

Harry gave Draco a curious look. “Ce?”(What?)
Draco sighed. “Go ahead.”
I’ll find you beautiful no matter what, Love.” He told Harry, wrapping an arm around his waist. “You’ll be growing with my child. You’re giving me something I never thought I’d get with you. You have to know how much it means to me.”
Celeste laughed softly. “Let’s see the room, then. I may be able to help once we move in.”
“Blood Wards.” Draco explained at her shiver. “Strong ones. These past rooms are only for family. No one else can get to them. Not even the French branch of the Malfoy family can pass them. Only those that hold the bloodline of Aneira Malfoy nee Driscoll can get through them. We will be safe here.” He assured Celeste.
Draco leaned down and sucked on the spot just above Harry’s right hip, where a small depiction of two crossed wands lay. The wands were very obviously the same ones both of them had gotten in Diagon Alley before coming to Hogwarts. Harry’s was the bottom wand, and Draco’s lay atop it, forming a small ‘X’ shape.
Jeremy turned a bright smile on Celeste and took her hand, kissing the back and bowing. “Pleasure to meet you. You're a lucky man, Draco.” He said.
Harry frowned. “Why Wales? Your family is
“Oh.” Draco flushed. “Right. Sorry if I made you… Right.” He said, stopping before he made things worse.
Draco pressed three fingers against Harry’s opening and whispered a lubrication charm. All three slipped in with little resistance.
Once the vial was full, Severus healed the cut. “When will your female period be?” He asked, labelling the vial and storing it in the top drawer of his desk, which he kept locked with several strong spells.
Harry closed his eyes, melting as Draco’s warm, gentle hands splayed against the small of his back, pulling him in for a kiss.
The epilogue will be up in just seconds, it is short and sweet, but I felt it was the perfect note to end on, and it has been unchanged for the last 6 years, waiting to be posted.

Draco just shook his head. “Love, look at me.” He cajoled, trying to pull the pillow away from Harry’s face.
“Hey, Draco.” Nott said, looking him over. “You look good. You got a new lotion or something?”

"And just how do you propose I do that?" Harry asked teasingly.

Harry smiled and shook his head. 'I'm fine.' He thought to Draco, deliberately sending the thought into his Bonded's mind. 'Don't get too distracted.'

Severus sighed. “Dumbledore made the decision, not me.” He said. “As well as the decision to leave him there in the first place.”
Draco pursed his lips. “Seems a bit stupid, really, to me.” He commented, heading into the bathroom to change into his pajamas.
Harry laughed. “Alright. No Cassiopeia. We can compromise.”
“Sounds like a plan to me.” Draco agreed, taking the shrunken pouch of money and slipping it into his pocket.

“We should really write her while we’re thinking of it.” Draco said, getting up and walking over to Harry’s desk. He sat down and began composing the letter. “The appointment’s this Saturday, right?” He checked. “I’ll have to send Imperious, he’s the only one fast enough to give her at least two days’ notice. She’ll be upset if she doesn’t have enough time to prepare.”
“Good. More time to spend with me. In bed.” Draco said.
Harry slid back up Draco’s body, pressing their cocks together as he whispered into Draco’s ear:

Harry smiled, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist. “Let’s not tell them. I like having something no one else has. The dungeons are for the Slytherins alone.” He whispered, taking Draco’s earlobe between his teeth and tugging on it gently.
Harry whimpered, feeling Draco’s fingers filling him nicely.
Harry leaned over and kissed Draco. “Thank you.” He said quietly.
Harry nodded thoughtfully. “I suppose so. Neither of them feels quite right, though.”

Draco chuckled, and Harry cried out, arching. The blond gagged, backing off for a moment to draw a steadying breath, then went back to work. He sucked gently, his tongue massaging the vein along the underside of Harry’s cock on the way up, then swirling around the head, before he took Harry all the way into his throat, then swallowed.
Draco flushed. “Not really, no. But oh, well.” He returned lightly.
It seemed as though all the other houses were staring at Harry and Draco for most of the meal. Harry tried to choke down his food while the other Slytherins teased him and Draco about their wedding night.

“I won’t have you hurting yourself or our child.” Draco said flatly as the elf proceeded to remove seven innocuous-looking items.
Remus breathed in deeply, then his eyes snapped up to Harry’s. “
'Maybe.' Harry thought, looking back down at his charms essay. 'Hey, what was the first rule of creating new charms?'
Draco shifted and his eyes opened as he grimaced. “Celeste, did you wet the bed again?” He asked sleepily.
Celeste groaned and lay back. “Right.”
Harry lifted the blond into his arms and stood, making Draco shriek, arms wrapping tightly around Harry’s neck. “Where are you taking me?” He asked.

Draco just shook his head, unable to move more due to overindulgence of sweets. “I think I’d chuck all over the floor if I so much as licked it.” He said, then fell back onto Nott’s bed, groaning.
Draco smirked smugly. “No one does, but you come the closest. I’m a Malfoy, after all. I will only accept the cream of the crop, and you, my sexy mate, are by far the creamiest of them all.”  Draco said huskily.
Draco grabbed Harry's hand and the whole group started walking as one.

They went up the stairs and took a left, heading down a hall interspersed with doors.

He turned his water off and joined Harry under his, taking the shampoo down and washing his own hair as Harry watched, entranced by the sight of Draco, so at ease with their mutual nudity after what had happened to him. “Draco…” He said softly.
Harry scowled. “Well, I’m glad he’s a boy, then.”

“I thought you’d like it. But I’m getting a bit tired. We need to rest for now. Dinner, elemental training, a snack, then bed?” Draco asked, flushing a bit.
They left the room and headed for breakfast.
Harry began giggling again.
“Okay.” Harry replied, breathing raggedly as well.
Harry pushed back against Draco, then answered, “I’m too horny to stop at this point, and you're already

Harry stirred, rousing from his half-sleep. “Yeah. Why?”

“Do you have wings?”
Harry chuckled, pulling out and pushing back in, slowly, savoring the sensation of finally being inside his mate. He groaned as Draco’s hands grabbed his ass, pulling him close and letting him move only enough to pull out halfway before he was forced back into Draco’s body. “Mm, you feel so good wrapped around me. So tight.” He whispered, then nibbled on Draco’s earlobe, drawing it into his mouth to suck on it as he continued his slow thrusts, feeling Draco’s hips moving to meet each one.

Hermione giggled. “I’ll head back now. Oh, and Harry? Ron seems to be coming around. By next week, he should be prepared to come to school and apologize properly before classes start.” She said.

Draco took a deep breath, trying to ease his aching hard-on, then slid inside Harry in one fluid motion, making him cry out in pained pleasure as he grabbed hold of Draco’s shoulders. Draco smirked. “Hold on, Love.” He whispered. “The real fun starts now.”
“The ballroom. This way.” Draco led her down a small hallway, passing a few parlours on the way.
Draco lay on the bed behind him and wrapped his arms around his husband, holding him close. “It’s okay, we’ll get through it. You want him to know, remember?”

Hermione shared a grin with Celeste and both got up. “Well, if you’re not going to be here, I don’t exactly need to stick around anymore. I’ll find Ron.” She said, leaving Celeste and Draco at the door.

Harry rolled his eyes, finishing Draco’s back. “Whatever. Turn around.”

“Good, then.” Millicent said. “Draco, Celeste, congratulations on your Bonding.” She said.
“You fainted.” Draco told her. “Madam Pomfrey says your magic is depleted, and has prescribed bed rest and a healthy diet.” He added.
Draco moaned, melting into the kiss and wrapping his arms around Harry’s neck. When Harry pulled away, he licked his lips and nodded. “Okay.” He agreed.
Celeste nodded. “That sounds like a good plan.”

Draco turned to the last elf. “Tipple, you will help out wherever you are needed most. Once the wing we intend to use is clean, you will only need to keep it tidy. The rest of the house will not see much use, just keep it dust-free and safe. One elf must be in the kitchen at all times, in case one of us gets hungry at a time other than mealtime. That will mostly be you. Obey my wife or face my wrath. You may all now get to work.” Draco finished addressing them. He turned to Celeste. “Anytime you need something, Tissy is the head elf, she will deal mostly with our requests, unless you are pregnant, in which case, Minsy is your personal elf.

Draco smiled. “Well, you deserve it.” He got on the bed and spooned up behind Harry, resting both hands on his distended belly. He felt something, and his eyes widened. “Was that a kick?” He asked excitedly.
"None at all!" Harry told him happily, then left, a new bounce in his step.

Draco smiled brightly. “

Draco chuckled. “It would appear that they like you.” He said wryly.

Draco chuckled. “Windhaven is not originally a
Fred nodded, smirking. “Veela?” He asked in a bored tone.
Celeste woke to a sensation she was growing very familiar with, and growled.
Harry gasped several times in quick succession as Draco picked up a quick rhythm with his thrusting, setting a punishing pace and expecting Harry to be up for the ride. Luckily, the brunet was willing to give as well as he was getting, pushing back against Draco’s thrusts with equal fervour.
“What is the difference, if there is any, and which way is better?” Draco asked interestedly. “Just in the name of knowledge, of course.”

Draco frowned. “Hm. I thought you were taking aloud. This could be handy.” He decided, perking up with interest.
Harry just shook his head and got in bed, curling around his husband. “Good night.”
Harry shook his head. “No, I like it! It's just… I’m not used to it.”

Draco cursed, kicking the wall in the Slytherin common room, causing a few raised eyebrows.
Draco cursed and stood, grabbing her bag as well as his own. “Hospital Wing.” He said shortly, and Blaise nodded, scooping her form up in his arms and leading the way, Draco hot on his heels.
their mother pulls through. I’m putting her on bed rest, she needs to eat healthy foods, limit salt, her blood pressure is a bit high. If she stays in bed except for trips to the bathroom, she should be fine.” Pomfrey said just as Celeste’s eyes fluttered open.
Draco smiled. “Yes, I think I get it.”
Draco brushed a lock of hair out of Harry’ face. “There is
Blaise nodded understandingly. “In time, you’ll start wanting it. It can be good, and you’ll find someone that will make sure it is.”
Harry groaned. “Great,

Severus smirked and got up to check it. He examined it, then took a moment to inhale deeply. Then, he nodded. "Flawless, as always, Mr. Malfoy. However, it should not have been completed so
“He took from me the one thing I always thought was mine to give.” Draco said, his voice breaking. Somehow, he managed to hold in the tears that wanted to fall.
Harry immediately pulled him close, wrapping his arms around the blond and tangling their legs together. He kissed Draco softly, sliding a hand into the blond’s hair, marveling at how silky it was. He sighed into the kiss, feeling Draco tremble against him, kissing back shyly.
Harry collapsed in relief as Snape was thrown out of his mind.
Harry threw his head back, groaning as Draco continued to stretch him, ignoring the plea that Harry had given him. Harry was about to scream when Draco’s mouth descended onto his pulse point, sucking hard.
Draco flushed. “I’m not a

Harry sighed. “I’m not kidding, Gin. Girls don’t do it for me. Are you friend or foe?” He asked.
“Ah, young love.” Pansy called out after them. “It’s great to see it flourishing.”
.” He sneered. “Allow me to demonstrate.” He said, standing and pulling his shirt off. He thought of his wings coming into view and smirked at the shock on both Harry and Fred’s faces as they saw his black feathered wings for the first time.
Harry slid his hands into Draco’s hair and pulled the blonde’s face closer. “This.” He whispered, pressing his lips to Draco’s.
Draco dropped the ball of water, snickering vindictively. “And

Draco froze. He was about to be raped. By his friend. Who had promised not to push past his limits.
Draco grinned, rolling onto his back and tucking his arms behind his head. “Well, if you can't wait, I’m here and ready to go.” He offered.
Harry snorted. “Oh, very funny. Man, I’m hungry. I want fish.” He frowned at Draco. “And I don’t even
Celeste nodded. “I don’t like the idea of wearing something someone else had against their privates. Never have.” She agreed.
that way—I would be willing to cast a more permanent silencing charm over the door. The only downside to that is that rather than knocking, people would have to use the speaking wall beside the door, but as that room is frequently used, the wall is still in effect, and will chime inside the rooms when it is used to get your attention. It should not be loud enough to wake a sleeping babe, though.”
Draco laughed. “We can replace that with a stag, if you like. The peacock was my Father’s Patronus.”
Draco's laughter echoed in his head. 'Be careful that you know all possible meanings of the words you are using. Or you may end up with a spell to clean your room that effectively banishes all your possessions forever, like Flitwick once did.'

“Then don’t say anything that makes me interested in getting them off you, okay?” He asked, running a hand through his own hair. “Draco?” He added for good measure.
Draco knelt beside the bed. “If you get up now, I will release you from your servitude.”
Harry rolled his eyes. "I don't mind it, but I
Draco sat next to him, pulling Harry’s hands from his face. “No, it’s fine. You’re a very sexual creature, and I shouldn’t have said something suggestive. Eventually, I’ll be yours. For now, we’ll be careful.” Draco said.
Harry beamed at Draco. “Bun!” He said happily.
“Are you sure?” Harry asked, running a hand comfortingly up Draco’s leg, his eyes shining slightly in the dimness of the room.

Breakfast was horrible. He tried to eat the waffles that were sitting in his place, but he could taste every ingredient clearly, and the final result was… Unpleasant, to say the least.

“I have to pee.” Draco explained. “I’ll be back.” He said, hurrying into the bathroom and emerging a minute later to curl back into bed with Harry, who was still sleepily dozing, while nuzzling Draco’s neck happily.
Celeste frowned. “What was that about?” She asked.
I shouldn’t have drunk so much last night!’
Draco grabbed Harry's wand and pointed it at her, then asked Harry, “Should I curse her blind?”

what I’m talking about. Don’t be such a prude.” Draco shot back.
Harry knew that he was treading on dangerous ground already, but he couldn’t stop it. He leaned his head down and lightly sucked on Draco’s neck, feeling the Vanteera shiver slightly. “Al meu.” (Mine.) Harry said, feeling as Draco gave one final shudder and came, calling out softly as he arched his back, arms around Harry’s neck.
Harry settled in to eat with a smile on his face.

Harry smiled through his tears. “Alright. I wanted you there with me, anyway. I don’t think I can do this without you.”
Harry glared at the Slytherin. “I hope you’re light.” He groused, using a drying charm.
Severus nodded thoughtfully. "A wise move, Mr. Malfoy. I am surprised I never thought of it myself."
Harry groaned, letting him go.
, you chose the wrong person to marry, Love. The Malfoy family is very influential, still. I'm getting our good name restored, little by little. I've been donating to charities generously, and that helps me look contrite for my Father's mistakes, even though I feel no guilt for that psycho's actions. They were

Celeste took a deep breath, and Madam Pomfrey nodded. “Now, push!”
“I’d rather suffocate, thanks.” Harry’s voice came out muffled.
George watched, shrugging at Draco’s comment as Harry stared stonily at the blond. “It’s always painful the first time.” George said calmly. “But it’s worth it in the end.” He finished.
“Then us being together is wrong, Ron.” Hermione said. “Because I am an open-minded individual that happens to believe that orientation does not a person make.” She finished, crossing her arms over her chest. “You have one week to come to terms with this. If you can’t, I refuse to continue trying to make this relationship work. It takes two to build a relationship, Ronald.”
Harry smiled and kissed Draco gently. “Thank you for trusting me.” He said slowly.
“I’ll go get it for you. Wait here.” Draco said, leaving the room.
Harry’s grin widened and he replied, “A kind of biscuit Americans really like. I’ve had one, once, and it wasn’t terrible. I’ll get some and let you try them sometime.”
Once Draco was holding a large 24-ounce tumbler, Harry smiled and nodded. “Good. Now, go down to the kitchens and get me three scoops of strawberry ice cream in that, and fill the rest with milk. Bring a spoon with a handle long enough to reach the bottom of the cup.”
Severus arched a brow at Draco. “I do indeed.” He said.
Celeste grinned. “Huge. But I like them, there will be plenty of room for our family to grow there. I intend to have as many children as Draco wants. Within reason.” She added as Draco opened his mouth excitedly.
Draco smiled. “Which is why
Harry stirred and sat up, rubbing at his eyes. “Ready for help?” He asked.
Harry sighed. “Yeah, I know. Are you scared that something will go wrong?” He asked, as they entered the common room and headed into Harry’s room.

Draco raised his eyebrows. “You can only touch, Nott. I’m not sleeping with you.” He said firmly. “I mean it.”
Draco’s wings twitched happily at the word. “Soon, Love. Soon enough.” He promised, then got out of bed carefully.
Draco shivered, closing his eyes tightly as he fought to keep his breathing somewhat even. That tongue was running over his small hole teasingly, applying light pressure, barely even pushing, and Draco just wanted it to slide into him deeply.
Harry smiled. “Thanks. It means a lot to me.” He said, then he and Draco left the room.
“But you can teach me how to access mine.” Draco said eagerly. “You, Sev, and Dumbledore are the only people strong enough, and I don’t think Dumbledore and Sev are in a safe position to be firing curses at me from, being teachers, and all.”
Madam Pomfrey was about to answer when Celeste huffed. “I can

Draco nodded. “Alright. So that will put us at…”

He realized with surprise that he wanted to feel that body against him,
Madam Pomfrey smiled at them. “On the bed, please, Mrs. Malfoy, and we’ll take a look.” She said cheerfully, pulling out her wand.
“Geez, calm down. You’d think I killed your puppy or something.”
Poppy frowned. “That doesn’t sound like something he would do.”

to. If only for my own peace of mind.’ He sighed heavily. “I have to do this. I’ve come so far already. The only way out of this now is to get through it.” He decided aloud.
Draco cupped Harry’s chin in his palm and raised Harry’s head. “Open your eyes.” He said challengingly.
"Ugh. I'm in the Prophet again." Harry said softly to Draco.
“I don’t think so.” A small voice answered him.
Draco smiled happily. “Blaise, that’s… Thank you.”
“I’ll need all the help I can get.” Draco said seriously.
Draco frowned. “Good point. Perhaps I
Blaise rolled his eyes. “Only Vanteera, Magi, Sinicae and Indago.”
Harry sucked in a breath, his eyes tearing up. “Low blow, Moony.” He whispered in pain and guilt both.
?” She asked.
Draco felt his heart swell with joy. Love. He was loved, despite his father, despite his inheritance, and despite his lack of virginity. Or maybe, because of those very things. Because they had shaped him into who he was now.
Harry snorted. “Anyways, it’s time for my Occlumency lesson. I’ll see you later.”
.” He groaned.
Draco used a few cleaning and healing charms on himself, then finally found strength enough to move. He quickly gathered his things and Apparated to his bedroom, gathering all the possessions he’d need, including the few books he had found on creature inheritances, his school supplies, and his clothing.
Harry moaned as Draco’s mouth unerringly found his nipple. He felt a maelstrom of magic begin brewing, and let it carry him away. He felt his hands move themselves, settling on Draco’s shoulders and moving downward, fingers rubbing over Draco’s nipples as the blond stimulated his in turn.
Madam Pomfrey finished up and checked the baby over. “Everything looks good. No getting up for three days, no heavy lifting for four weeks, and light activity for six weeks. Then we will talk about you getting back to your normal routine.” She told Celeste.
Draco shook his head. “No. I have this good feeling about it all. Like everything’s going to go perfectly and we’ll have the most beautiful baby girl in the world.” He murmured, pulling Harry down onto the bed and wrapping himself around the brunet. “We’ll be fine. You’ll see.”
risks involved, so let’s hope little…”
Celeste sighed and closed her eyes. “So bed rest.” She said in resignation.
“Depends on what it is.” He said calmly. “Talk to me in the library at eleven. I’ll be there, but I’d like to finish eating first, if you don’t mind. Your new looks are a bit distracting.” He said, giving Draco a quick once-over. “When did you do the ritual?”
After dinner, they went outside. Draco headed to the lake, but Harry stopped him, shaking his head. “Air. You are ready.” He said firmly.
Draco blinked, then smiled a bit at Harry, whose tongue was hanging out of his mouth, still enlarged.
Harry moaned and met his movements, shamelessly putting on a show, arching back and displaying his body to advantage.
Harry grinned sheepishly. “Nu.”(No.)
Draco rolled his eyes and pushed Harry onto his back. “Calm down. He won’t find us.” He reassured Harry, lowering his mouth to the brunet’s cock and taking it into his mouth.
Narcissa laughed. “Oh, dear me, yes! It’s perfectly safe, until you get very close to the end of your pregnancy. Your Mediwitch or Mediwizard will tell you when it’s time to stop having sex.” She told him. “Until that time, both you and Draco should enjoy your body. It’ll be going through a lot of changes, but I’m sure Draco will still find you beautiful. He was raised right, after all.” She said, sending him a stern glance.

“You and me both.” Harry agreed. “Oh, I forgot to tell you, I sent a letter to Arabella about the baby. She’s probably going to be a bit angry, at me most likely, but she had to know. She and I got pretty close over the summer, and she’d be upset if I kept it from her for too long.” He said.
“Let’s see...” Madam Pomfrey cast a diagnostic charm. “Her magic is very depleted. So much is going to this child. Congratulations, Mr. Malfoy, your progeny is going to be very gifted.
“How’d you find out you were gay?” He asked.
“I see, I see.” Dumbledore murmured. “Well, there are rooms available, of course. Which floor would you prefer? We have two in the dungeons, though they
“Draco, when the baby comes, are you two staying in the dorms?” Pansy asked. “Because with your current problems remembering silencing charms, that could definitely be an issue.”

Draco just scowled at him and took a running jump, his wings beating strongly as he gained height. He flew up level with Harry’s broom and hovered in front of it, smirking. “Come and get me, if you
“Does it ever seem like time’s moving really slowly to you? I mean, I already feel like I’ve been pregnant forever.” Harry murmured.
Draco chuckled softly. “A beater, from the feel of it. She's strong.” He said approvingly.
?!” He asked in shock.
Draco chuckled as they dressed and left to head for the great hall.
They entered the Great Hall and, as Draco had predicted, Blaise and Pansy stepped aside in a perfectly choreographed move, Draco and Harry walking forward proudly, hand-in-hand, a slight blush forming on Harry's cheeks.
“He’s closest in age to me, of course we’ve roughed each other up a few times, but I can

Molly sighed, glancing at Harry. “This
Harry rolled onto his front. “I still have my Charms essay to write, but after that, I’m free for the rest of the day.” He said lightly.
“Not a problem, but for any future pregnancies, keep track of them better. You have probably another ten or twenty minutes before I’ll have you start pushing.”
Draco let out a soft laugh.
Ron stood up. “Don’t do this?! Harry, you’re supposed to be with

Draco sighed. “Good to know. Do I have a predestined mate, or something?”
Harry read the letter again. It was from Snape, asking to meet him in Diagon Alley. Harry smiled, wondering if he’d finally found a cure. It had been seven years since he and Draco had graduated, and they now had a girl, twin boys, and Harry was expecting again.
“She'll stay in here until she is five, then she will move into the Heir’s bedroom. Or we can wait for a boy. Most families do.” Draco said.

“What are you talking about?” Harry asked.

It was a large room, boasting more terrazzo flooring and walls, with a large, stained-glass representation of a peacock.
Harry fixed Draco with a droll stare.
Draco cleared his throat. “Keep in mind that Harry’s an incubus, will you? We’re probably going to

Severus nodded. “Then Tuesday I will need another vial.”
Draco flushed. “I don’t have a problem with it, just with peoples’

Harry shook his head. “Nah. I actually have Occlumency with Snape, and hand-to-hand combat with Remus and the twins, and Bill is coming to teach me some curse-breaker-type stuff I may need to know. I’ll be busy. ‘Sides, I can fight with Malfoy for a change of pace.”
!” Draco said, sitting up. “Ow, but I think I might have bruised myself.” He said, rubbing his hip where he had hit the dirt rather forcefully. “Can we do that again?”
“Sanctuary.” Harry answered. “He asked for sanctuary, and Dumbledore granted it.”
Harry hummed. “I had no idea that was
‘I’m going to tell them.’ He decided, letting Draco hear the thought.
Ginny licked her lips, wide-eyed, and nodded. “So that’s why you’re here?” She asked.
? What if he-“ Draco glanced around, finally seeming to notice where they were, and that this conversation was best conducted in private. He pulled Harry into the common room, cursing, and then rounded on the teen. “What if he tells someone that blabs to the Prophet? Was I wrong in thinking that you wanted to keep this a secret?” He hissed, scanning the room for other occupants. Luckily, he saw none.
Draco sighed. “Sev, he’s my

Draco flashed him a smile over his shoulder. “Slave for a week, and we’ll consider it even.”
“Blindfolds.” Draco answered simply. “We’re not allowed to look with our eyes. We need to do this by touch and sound alone.” He elaborated.
Draco swallowed, nodding. “I want this. It’s time.” He said softly.

He got up to drag himself into his private bathroom, and then proceeded to empty his stomach into the toilet. He finally raised himself enough to get to his hangover potion in the shelf. He quickly downed it, following with several cups of water, a few breath-freshening charms, and a few muggle mints.

Harry growled and followed, holding the trembling Draco as the water washed away the seed from their sated bodies.
Severus nodded. "That's all. You may go if there are no questions."
“Ceti? Carinae?”
“You do.” Harry said.
of our little Cari, let’s take a look at the nursery.” He said, walking to a door in the wall and opening it.
She noticed a large, red phoenix necklace in the case, and traced its shape through the glass, silently.
Draco cleared his throat. “And I suppose I will be missing History of Magic today, so if you could take some notes for me, Pansy, I would be most appreciative.”
Draco sighed and continued washing Harry, pointedly ignoring the occasional chuckle from the dark-haired teen.
? Without you?” She asked in a disbelieving whisper.
Harry rolled his eyes and swung again.
Harry stayed seated until it was just him, Severus and Draco in the room, then walked up to the Potions Master. “Yes?” He asked curiously.
alone.” He said, glancing pointedly at the tented bedcovers.
Draco sighed in pleasure at the action and let himself enjoy the touch. Harry and he were destined. They were made for each other, and now he had irrefutable proof. He was able to let himself enjoy any touch Harry gave him, because he had no reason to feel guilty about giving himself to his mate.
Harry smiled, walking quickly to keep up with Draco. Having the blond in front of him was nice, though. Harry was able to watch his milky-white arse bounce with every step Draco took. The blond was strangely effervescent tonight. Harry noticed that Draco’s hair was drying slightly, and the outer strands were beginning to float about his head, and his heart melted. He loved that one imperfection, letting him know that even Draco had his flaws.
Draco burst out laughing, holding up the boxers. “No, I wouldn’t do that.”
." Harry told the blonde, laughing when he felt a wave of horror crash over Draco through the bond.
Harry took a deep breath. “I have a confession to make.” He stated, then dropped the voice-altering spell and Vanished the dress. “I didn’t die.” He said, letting Remus see the familiar clothing.
Harry rifled through his wardrobe. “I suppose we really should take the wedding clothes so that they don’t have to come with everything else and get wrinkled or ruined.” He said.
Draco stared at Blaise’s back, turned to offer privacy without leaving Draco alone with the nurse.
Fred shook his head. “You can come with me. Harry does crazy stunts that would kill any sane person, but
Draco's eyes widened as he felt a new constriction around his cock. "Did you just spell a cock-ring onto me?" He asked suspiciously.
Harry frowned, then spoke slowly. “It… Is hard. My mind does not… Want to… Allow it until I have… Bonded to you.” He said with no small amount of difficulty. “It is a… Security… Measure, I believe.”
Draco shrugged, smirking. “Freshen up, and maybe you’ll get another one later.” He said.
Draco smiled. “Yes, but we won’t have that problem here. Even if I do decide to leave doors unlocked.”
Harry reluctantly undressed, standing before Draco in black silk boxers as the blond pulled down his trousers, revealing that his boxers were silk as well, although they were silver.

Draco glared at him as he was held over the crystalline water. “Don’t even think for
Draco felt his heart drop. He had wanted a big family with Harry. At least three green-eyed little devils running around with Harry's power and kindness toward others and the Malfoy pride. "Oh." He answered. "Well, that's good, then." He said softly.

“Harry, you need to listen to these next words very carefully, and as soon as I finish speaking, you need to initiate a kiss to seal the bonding.” Draco panted, never breaking rhythm with his thrusting.
Harry and Draco were on the loveseat in front of the fire.
Harry shrugged. “Fine.”
Draco shook his head. “No. It’s always the boy’s fault in Pureblood circles. She’s most likely to blame me.”
Madam Pomfrey cast a spell and an image of their baby appeared above Celeste’s abdomen. “Three, four preferably so Celeste will be female again, but if we must, I can do a caesarean delivery. Ideally, we are going for a more natural delivery.”
Draco raised an eyebrow, glancing at Harry. "Don't tell me you don't want to be the consort of the Ruler of the World, Love. Therefore, the one person who should never think me creepy would be

Severus nodded. “You will be the first person to know.” He swore.
Draco smiled widely. “Thank you, Sir!”
But, of course, he wasn’t ready to calm down yet.
Draco paused at that, then began chuckling when Pansy’s voice came through the walls.
Harry gave Draco a pointed look, obviously thinking ‘I told you so.’
Severus smiled, finding that the level of toxins in the potion was finally low enough to not be fatal. However, it could still be just a bit too high, which would cause Harry to vomit and could potentially harm the foetus, so he’d have to wait and test it once Harry was no longer pregnant to be sure.
Harry grabbed them, growling under his breath.
Draco smiled. “I know. Any cool tricks I can do?”
When they got back, Pansy and Blaise waylaid them.
Harry moaned and melted under his touch willingly, and Draco groaned in elation at the feeling of power he had over Harry in that moment. Harry was boneless, and he felt his head spin at the thought that his
Draco turned to look over his shoulder at Harry, a look of concern on his face. Obviously, Harry had once again been "broadcasting" his emotions, letting them seep through the bond to let Draco feel the same emotions. The yearning must have him worried.
Draco snorted. “Of

"Please, Harry,

Draco smiled. “
Draco was panting and sweating within seconds, and begging Harry to let him come within the first minute.
However, he wasn’t so sure he wanted a cure anymore. He and Draco had made a life together, and, however strange it may look to an outsider, it was working for them.
“Well, what do you have in—
Harry smiled, laying a hand over Draco’s. "O pot controla." (I can control it.)
Draco smiled. “I’m sure that short a time was fine, but try not to let this become a habit.”
Harry chuckled, but it turned into a moan when Draco started moving again.
“Anti-nausea potion, healing potion, calming draught, and…” He looked Draco over, hoping he was wrong, “Pain reliever and contraceptive.” He helped Draco get onto his bed.

“Only if you really want me to, but I’d rather you call me Draco, either way.” Draco said.
Draco huffed and shoved the sponge and his body wash into Harry’s hands, turning around. “Shut up and wash me.” He said, failing to mask the amusement in his voice. “Once we get this done, we get to wander the halls of Hogwarts naked.” He said in an excited tone. “How often does one get
No, if this worked, Harry needed to know. Even if it meant Draco’s marriage would produce only one heir and might be doomed to dissolution or divorce in the end. He couldn’t lie to Harry after all the trust he was being given.

“Acid Pops.” Draco nearly sighed, sagging briefly as the stairs began moving. He straightened his spine and went up, the Headmaster’s voice bidding him enter as he got to the top.
Draco smiled. “Two weeks. Next Hogsmeade weekend.”
Harry chuckled. “What do you want to do when we get there?” He asked, standing.
They came out in a small, circular area with a table that seated three, four at a stretch, and had floor-to-ceiling windows that made up two thirds of the area. It was bright and cheerful. “This is very nice.”

Harry paled. “
Harry looked up. “Yeah?” He asked Malfoy, turning toward him, still eating.
Ron and Hermione were great, but Remus, all the Weasleys, Neville, even most of teachers at Hogwarts would all have different viewpoints that his children could possibly benefit from one day. Was he really going to deny them that? The one thing he had wanted so desperately, but never really gotten?
“I heard. As much as the thought of you with that
Three elves popped into the room, all wearing light blue pillowcases. They bowed to Draco and one of them announced, “There bes a new elf, Master Draco! He be needing a name!”

“I just…” Harry sighed. “Damn. I always thought that it was just me, so it didn’t really matter that much, because I’d get by.” He said. “I never thought that the way I grew up would affect my kids.”

Harry rolled his eyes, pointing his wand at his tongue. "Th'nitay intantatum." He said, scowling when it didn't work. Well, apparently spells that altered speech were a bad idea if one was planning on ever casting aloud again.

It led to a yellow room, with a changing table and crib, both in white, and a small wardrobe against one wall. There was a dark rocker in the corner, where Celeste could sit and nurse, or simply enjoy being in the presence of her baby. In the corner across from the rocker, there was a toddler bed.
“And I’m your lucky mate. Too bad your ego has gotten almost as big as mine. We’ll be fighting within weeks.” Draco joked, walking up to the bed.

“I should think that much would be obvious.” Severus drawled.
Harry closed his eyes but spoke firmly and clearly. “Ron, you are my friend. You were my first friend. I understand that you’re—”

Draco chuckled. “Well, I'm off to bed. It’s been a long day. Coming?” He asked his wife.
Draco got up and straightened his clothes. He found his broom and turned to Harry. “So, let’s go—” He narrowed his eyes at the teen still curled on the bed, ignoring him. “What are you doing?”
Draco smirked. “So, was it good?” He teased.
“And you can’t just be civil with him for a
“I don’t think seeing my fantasies of you is your idea of a good time.” Harry purred, looking Draco up and down slowly.
Ginny giggled. “Duly noted. I’ll get Bill to grow his hair a bit longer and stop working out, then I’ll send him your way.”
His mind, though, was reeling. 'Rose hips.'
Harry sent Draco a mental picture of him, tied to their bed and blindfolded, while Harry fucked him, first with his tongue, then a dildo, then with his own cock.

Celeste gaped at the crystal chandelier, the pride and joy of the previous occupants. “Bit ostentatious, isn’t it?” She indicated the thing.
Harry flushed. “Beautiful mate of mine.” He said, tracing Draco’s full lips. “I do not deserve you.”
Draco moaned happily in his sleep, feeling a warm body behind him. He froze, and looked over his shoulder, wide awake as he saw emerald green. “How the hell...?”
Harry nodded, letting Draco get into the bath and help him in. “Thanks.” Harry said. “Um, do we have to say vows or something?” He asked.

Harry began trailing light, teasing kisses down Draco’s chest, adding a light bite every few inches until he finally reached his destination: Draco’s leaking cock.

Draco turned his head to look at Nott. “Hm?”
When the elf returned, Draco took the potions one at a time, then took a deep breath, finally looking up at Blaise thankfully.
“What?!” Draco backed against the wall behind him. “I—I don’t!” He stammered.
Harry traced the phoenix resting in the hollow of his throat and smiled. Draco was a hopeless romantic, and spoiled him, but Harry just couldn’t be mad about it.
Ginny bit her lip. “I think so. But don’t ask me to fight with him for you. He scares me, to be honest.”
Draco snorted. “I can’t let you
Draco moaned as Harry traced his teeth with his tongue, then wrapped his tongue around Draco’s, pulling it into his mouth to suckle at it, making Draco wonder just how much that talented tongue was capable of.
Draco didn’t look up, still staring thoughtfully at his lap.
Harry walked up to him. “Go ahead. Take a good whiff.” He said, holding out an arm. “It’s really me.”
. You just heard my thoughts." He informed the brunet.
Harry fell to one knee, trying to hold back the presence invading his mind.
“I say we skip our next class to celebrate!” Draco said eagerly.

They headed down the hallway a little more and came out into a huge room with an in-ground pool—impressively, it was Olympic-sized—and a large hot tub.
“Long enough to get a good nap. We have transfiguration in ten minutes. You need to get up now, I’m afraid.” Draco told him.
The future was coming quickly, and they both felt they were prepared to meet it when it arrived.
“Will that be safe for the baby?” Harry asked, worried.

Draco shrugged. “Well, both of us will just have to give exams a miss until the August re-tests come up, then.” He said surely.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Prat.”
“Hello, Draco. Celeste.” Remus said in a friendly but wary voice. “Why did you want to meet with me?”
Draco rolled his eyes, accepting his tea and conjuring honey to add to his. “Well, do you expect me to just go outside and try to do stuff without knowing what I’m doing?” He asked.
“Mm.” Draco hummed, reading again.
Harry grinned. “I intend to.” He said brightly.
had been like as a child. Harry had never truly had that until it was too late for him to ask his parents things like what they had been thinking, what they had felt, as they had done some of the things they had done. He wanted his child to have the chance he had been robbed of, but by not telling the people that mattered most to him who he really was, he was denying his child that.
Harry snickered as Draco huffed. “For your information, Pansy darling, I have been given the
“Oh.”
“Yellow parlour, cream parlour, a study.” Draco said, pointing out the rooms as they passed. “None of them are likely to see much use, unless we have a party here. Here is the ballroom.” He opened the large double doors and they walked in.
Pansy tossed her hair. "If I wanted to be married by now, I would be." She declared haughtily. "Well, but for one simple matter." She amended, sneaking a glance at the head table under her lashes.
"Well, yeah, a

“Yes, love?” Draco asked sweetly, trying for innocent and missing the mark as his cock withdrew.
Harry nodded, knowing Draco couldn’t see him, but hoping he would sense it somehow.
Harry snickered, walking with the levitated Draco over to the Great Lake.
He fingered the small vial of potion he held as he walked out of his private lab and back to his rooms. ‘I could just pretend that I couldn’t make it work. No one really needs to know.’ He dismissed the thought almost immediately.
“Wow, Harry. You look
He broke the kiss once Draco's shirt was fully unbuttoned, locking his eyes onto the blond's and smirking. "You have the chance now to decide how you want this. I can either give you fast relief, and then nothing else until tomorrow night, or I can draw this out and make you suffer, then after dinner we will come back here and spend the night in bed together."
Blaise sighed. “Neither. I’ll keep an eye out for you. Dray, you need to stay as far away from danger as you can. Promise you’ll be careful this summer. I’ll visit when I can.”
“You would like to spare your fellow Slytherins the sleepless nights that you know are in store for you?” Dumbledore asked. “Have you considered silencing charms?”

Poppy smiled. “Of
Draco watched him from the bed as Harry carefully applied his make-up, covering the scar and accenting his lovely eyes. “You look beautiful, Love.” He said once Harry was satisfied.
Draco nodded. “I can cast a featherweight to carry her back to our rooms, right?” He asked, drawing his wand.
Draco nodded. “Yes. We
Harry looked down at himself, then opened his boxers and peeked inside, groaning. “Yes.” He answered, morosely.
The potions master had stopped by him on his way out of the great hall, telling him to visit his office as soon as he was finished eating, alone.
Draco raised a brow at this. “Are you sure?” He asked skeptically.
Poppy shook her head. “I’m going to let you in on a secret about Harry: he loves very deeply. I’m sure he will stay with Draco no matter what, especially once their daughter comes. He is not the type to leave a husband.”
“I’ve also looked up Vanteera and discovered that they are very sexual, as well. They are very submissive, and can be extremely shy at first, which makes them ideal for Incubi mates, and the combination is quite common.” She added.
"Just more proof that I'm doomed to have an unconventional life." Harry joked. "Now, come on. Dinner's in half an hour, let's get cleaned up."
Harry hummed. “Also cute. But I don’t quite feel right about it. Isn’t Cassiopeia a star-related name?” He asked.
Draco smiled. “

Harry flushed. “Maybe not. I was almost starved. I’m supposed to be bigger.”
Arthur just kept staring at Harry thoughtfully.
As soon as they got into the room, Draco laid down on the bed. “You've got a few hours yet. Come lie with me.” He coaxed.

Draco tried to get a better grip on the air, then tried to throw it. It slipped from his grasp, and he only managed to cause a faint breeze once again. He growled in frustration. “This is harder than I thought.” He said angrily, trying to grab that energy and throw it around again.
it will be! Two weeks before the due date is when the baby’s lungs will be fully developed, so it’s perfectly safe for the baby to be a little early. These things do happen.” She assured them.
Harry chuckled, adding a third finger and stretching Draco carefully. “I’ll be gentle, but keep relaxed, okay?” He asked.
“So, you actually made a ten-foot-high wave?” Blaise asked excitedly.
Draco smiled widely. “We’re moving in tomorrow after breakfast, to a room near the kitchens. It has a kitchenette, and if you ask the elves they will bring you ingredients so you can cook if you want to, and Dumbledore is going to add on a nursery and a permanent silencing charm on the door tonight.”
Harry groaned. “Tease.” He panted, watching Draco watching him.
He sat in the middle of the pitch and began meditating, finally coming out of it when it was dark out. ‘Hm. Wonder why no one came out to get me when it started getting dark.’

Harry stood, walking over to the blond and wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist, then kissing him. “Te iubesc.”(I love you.) He whispered, gently nipping at Draco’s earlobe.

Harry just pointed to his food. “Want to eat. Distracted by really pretty male company. Please, Malfoy.”
Draco flushed, and Fred laughed. “Draco?! Since when?”

“Harry?” Draco gasped as Harry gave one final shudder, then looked at him, his green eyes glowing with an unnatural light.
, to boot.” He grinned at her. “But please cast a silencing charm so we don't end up with Millicent in here, too.”
“Vanteera.” Blaise whispered.
Harry chuckled and quickly worked Draco's school robe off his shoulders. He paused afterwards to kiss the blond slowly, letting his tongue fully explore the warm cavern that was Draco's mouth before his hands continued undressing his husband.
Draco whimpered as Harry’s hands on his hips guided him in a steady rhythm, moving his hips to meet Draco’s.
“I’ll be coming by tomorrow to do a well-baby check and make sure everything is going well. It’s currently 3 AM Friday morning, I will see you around noon on Saturday, that gives you more than 24 hours to settle in.” She said.
“Hmm… Breakfast sounds like a good start. Then, how about a kiss I can actually remember properly?” He asked hopefully.
Harry sighed. "Thanks for that. Well, now that you've softened up a bit, how about trying that dildo idea?" He suggested.
. Might be an improvement.” He said. He stood and held his hand out. “Jeremy Hughes.”
“That doesn’t completely rule the possibility out, though.” Severus insisted. “But at the same time, I don’t want Draco to someday realize that Harry is only with him because he was
Celeste cleared her throat. “I think I’m in labour, Draco.” She said.
Draco nodded. “Yes, let’s go.”
“Thank you. Really, thank you.”
Draco paled. “
Harry raised an eyebrow, standing. “You don’t say?”
Draco left the room, and as he left, he heard Dumbledore say to one of the portraits, “Well, Phineas, looks like your Slytherins are certainly planning to build their numbers, aren’t they?”
“If I do, you’ll be the first to know. After me, of course.” Harry amended.
Harry hummed happily as he waited, and when Draco returned, he beamed at his husband. “Oh, you
“Well, research has shown that things like famine can affect the next three generations to be born. It’s so that if the famine continues or recurs, the youngest generations will be the best equipped to survive regardless.” Draco said gently.
Draco chuckled. “That sounds like a good idea to me.” He agreed.
Harry groaned as Draco’s finger prodded his side, but rolled over compliantly.
“I know. If he ever masters shadow magic, then decides to switch sides, we’re doomed.” Harry said jokingly. “But then again, I don’t think he wants to be mated to Voldy.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “You’re gay? That’s going to cause mass hysteria, one way or another. Some girls will be

Draco sobbed. "Harry, I think I may die if you don't let me come!" He cried, a tear escaping his eye to roll down over his temple and into his hair.
Draco nodded. “Anything for you.”
Harry chuckled wryly. “Boy, do I have quite the story for you.” He told Remus.
Narcissa smiled. “That can happen. Are you having a lot of morning sickness?” She asked.
“I guess you’re right.” Harry said, running a hand over his large stomach.
Draco reached down to his and stroked it slowly, watching Harry and licking his lips provocatively.
“Hmm, you’re having a girl. Congratulations. Everything looks fine.” She waved her wand again and the sound of a rapid heartbeat filled the air. After a few moments, she nodded. “Nothing’s wrong there either. A healthy baby girl.” She declared.

Hermione was already opening the books and laying out her notes when they emerged, and she giggled at their embarrassed smiles. “Well, I think things are going well, aren’t they?” She gestured to the seats around the table she was at. “Incubi need sex.” She stated. “Without it, Harry will slowly die. Draco, if his eyes glow, it means that his hunger is close to the surface, and the best thing to do is to sate it. Penetration isn’t required at first, but without it, Harry will eventually lose his mind and
“Alright.”
“You said you’d have me help!” Harry protested.
“Dray?”
Draco blushed and nodded. “Right, then.” He turned off the water. “To lunch?”
Draco nodded. “I know. It’s not something that’s obvious.”
Draco kissed her hand, then gave it a tug. “Come on; let’s go get you acquainted with your new home and your elves.”
Harry looked up at it, smiling. “Bloody hell, it
!” He wailed, raising his hips and rutting against Harry’s cock.
“That sounds cosy.” She said happily. “Let's see it, then.”
Draco sighed heavily and wiped his forehead with his sleeve, glancing over fondly at his sleeping husband.
Draco quickly worked him open, then lubed himself and slid in, both teens moaning at the feeling. “Merlin, you always feel so good around me.” Draco said, hands grasping his hips and gently urging him to move.
Draco eyes lit up. “I could kiss her right now. Put that on. Then, I’m going to take it off of you. With my teeth.” He purred.
Draco laughed. “You do that.” He turned to Hermione. “Said he’s going to train more before he challenges me again. Helps that I’ve been fencing since I was five, I guess.”
Draco screamed.
Sorry for the long wait!
Harry felt himself get harder than a rock. "Oh, Merlin." He whispered.
Harry smiled happily, tilting his head back and looking at the landscape. “Amazing.” He breathed.
Draco leaned back, a smug feeling radiating down the link. 'Finished.' He informed Harry.
Draco chuckled. “We'll do the abbreviated tour. I'll show you around the wing we will be using, the pool room, ballroom, dining room, and library. The rest can wait until you are rested after having Carina.” He grinned widely. “That way, you can have the pleasure of exploring like I did when I was little.”
“Sure.” Jeremy answered easily. “Just pick a weekend, and I'm all yours.”
He shrunk all his possessions and headed to Blaise’s house through the Floo in his bedroom.
Seven startled pairs of eyes turned to Draco. Ginny was the first to find her tongue.

Harry wasn’t too fond of the lingering taste he had been left with, but what Delphi wanted, she got.

“You’re an idiot.” Draco said, stunned. “A bloody moron, Potter. When has that ever worked—”

Draco smirked smugly. "Actually, love, I was speaking directly into my own

Draco sneered at the innuendo, smiling as the ice finally became razor sharp and hard as diamonds. “Ha!” He declared, picking up the sword and brandishing it triumphantly. “Did it!” He crowed.
Draco spelled the lights on and Pomfrey nodded.
Ginny blushed. “She’s been spending a lot of time at the house this summer. Been there for the whole break so far. She’s taking Ron to meet her parents soon.”
“No, I want Carina to be born healthy.” Celeste said, rubbing her bump.
Suddenly, his door was thrown open and he found his wand pointed at Draco, who had tumbled through the doorway.
Draco came up out of the water silent, his eyes wide as he gasped for air. Once he had caught his breath, he stayed in one place, treading water, then smiled, raising a hand in front of his face. “Wow.” He said, watching as the water droplets all moved to one side of his hand, then the other, at his command.
the safest, for that reason.”
Blaise shrugged. “You need to be safe. This’ll help you be.”
“Stop that, you’ll tear it!” Draco snapped, batting Harry’s hands away from the dress.
He cast tempus and cursed, setting down the vial and changing out of his work robes, replacing them with the ones he normally wore to intimidate the students.
Harry moaned, then answered, and Draco could
“I got everything already.” Draco said lightly.
, and I mean it!” She added.
Celeste blushed. “I’m sorry we fought.” She mumbled.
Draco moaned softly as Harry took him in, deep-throating him easily. He fisted both hands in Harry’s hair, feeling the bobbing motion as Harry sucked him, keeping a rhythm obviously designed to drive him to madness.
Draco scoffed and walked into the common room, his eyes widening. “Wow.” He breathed.
“They say I can’t bring you along, since boys at baby showers are bad luck!” Harry pouted. “What do they think having
Blaise paled. “I think I’ll stay on the ground if you all don’t mind. I’m not one for heights.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Of course, Love.” He said placatingly.
Harry finally raised his head, smirking. “There’s something… I’ve been wanting to try.” He purred, his eyes glowing eerily. “Are you up for a bit of… Experimentation?”
Harry just shook his head and thrust once more into Draco, stiffening as his orgasm rushed through him.
“Hello. Who're you, then?” A young man at a nearby table asked curiously.
against the wall roughly. His eyes widened, a small thrill of nervousness running down his spine. He trusted Harry, yes, but this was… New. And more than a bit unsettling.
“Yes, but I’m not my father. How do you know of him?” Draco asked.
Celeste stared at him in horror. “Definitely
Harry and Draco walked into the Hospital Wing hand-in-hand to find Madam Pomfrey and Narcissa already there, waiting for them.

“Oh, shut up, will you?” Harry snapped, burying his face under his pillow.

Madam Pomfrey tsked. “Trust me, there is no other course now. Your daughter is not going to wait, and I can’t just cut her out when your body has already started the process naturally. When she is out, you will get pain potions, and you will forget all about the pain in a few weeks.” She smiled. “It may even only take a few days, so don’t worry too much, dear.”
Harry smirked. “I hoped you’d say that.” He purred, sliding back down Draco’s body, his tongue tracing a line as he went. That tongue slid over Draco’s cock, up one side and down the other, before it ran teasingly over his balls before circling the tiny pucker behind them.
Ginny giggled.
Harry glared at them from the other end of the library. “I demand silence!” He snapped, causing both teens to look at him, then burst out laughing.
“No.”
Draco paled further. “Sev, this isn’t our fault, it’s—”
Harry moaned, his fingers finding Draco’s silky hair and combing through the locks as he moaned softly, his hips rising slightly in response to the stimulation.
A little too well.
Draco grinned. “It’s at the top of a hill, but there is a village at the base, and they speak English there. They can make friends close by. The village is magical, so they won’t have to hide their magic from them. They don’t mind us, as long as we respect them and their ways, they let us be and give us our space.” He told the other teen. “You'll like it there, I think. It’s beautiful.”
He gulped as he felt something blunt and hot against his ass.
A small pop, and there was a slightly smaller elf appeared.
Harry nodded. “Tell me if… You change your mind. I… Can stop.”
Draco chuckled wickedly. “There. Now he’ll be bruised today.” He said, satisfied.
Harry nodded, and Draco helped him stand again, letting them out of the room before he reset the wards and led Harry to his room. “Ready?” He asked.
“How long?” Draco asked, and Hermione sighed.
Surely taking a five-minute nap wouldn’t hurt…
“No.” Draco swallowed and stared down at his lap. “On my birthday, I went to Nott’s house to spend the night. He’s not my best friend, but I figured he was an okay bloke, and he’d never done anything to make me distrust him before. He brought up my… Preferences, hoping I could help him find out if he was the same.

Draco nodded, wrapping his arms around her waist and pressing against her back. “It will. I will do most of it, but if you want to help, either once you’ve had Carina or before, I will have no problems with that. Just as long as you make sure not to overexert yourself.” He added firmly.
Draco paid for the necklace, then took it and put it on Celeste. “It looks lovely on you.

Harry and Draco walked to class, heads together as they conversed in low tones about which classes they both needed for their career paths, and mused about how likely they were to get their dream jobs.
He told his mother that his stomach was a bit upset after last night, and she suggested porridge.
“I will do that with

“I’m going to attempt to decode your DNA and meld the two strands together as they were to re-write your genetic code as it used to be. It will likely take me years, but I will do my best to return you to your previous state.” Severus promised.
Draco turned and smiled at him. “We're the owners of Windhaven. We're checking to make sure it’s ready for us when we finish school.” He explained.
Harry walked up to the Owlery to send off the invitation to Hermione with a school owl.
Harry mounted his broom and kicked off, circling Draco and whooping. “Come on, get up, you lazy bugger!” He shouted teasingly.
He realized that he was also seeing magic around all the charmed things he owned, and could hear the house-elves two rooms away puttering around. Well, he couldn’t tell his mother that he was… Some type of magical creature… Or she’d send him straight to Voldemort, virgin or not. She’d probably use his virginity to let Voldemort mate with him!
Severus shook his hand, then pulled a vial from his pocket. “Celeste.” He said seriously. “This is a cure for your condition. If you drink this potion I have created, it will cause your monthly change to cease, and you will remain the way you were forever.”
Harry chuckled. “Good. Mine forever.” He said firmly, holding Draco tightly, making the blond feel safe and more loved than he had ever before felt.
Harry took them with a wide smile. “Thank you. These look delicious.”
Ginny gasped.
Harry smiled at him and stood. “Ready to face the world?” He asked.
Draco just brushed off most of the remarks with a simple: "Well, at least I'm getting a beautiful partner in my bed every night. Even more, she's Bonded to me now." He finished softly, raising Harry's hand to his lips and kissing it.
Harry smiled brightly. “Very!” He chirped.
“So, the best date for inducement would be the second day that you’re female, so the twentieth. Does that work for both of you?” Pomfrey asked.
Once again, it slipped. “Damn.”

“Well, keep it in mind. Hufflepuffs can be trusted if you need a break.” Dumbledore patted Harry’s shoulder and added, “And I am always around if you need advice from a grandfatherly perspective, as well. I have not been a father myself, but I have watched many children grow and live over my years.”
Ron had looked livid when Draco refused the cake, politely stating that he was unable to eat it. He had stood up from his seat and accused Draco of acting like he was too good to eat the cake prepared by someone he saw as beneath him. Draco had explained that he was a Vanteera, and Ron had then accused him of lying.
Draco found his own clothes and changed, then grabbed Harry’s wand and spelled his hair into place carefully.
Celeste smiled happily. “So long as I don’t intend to become the next Dark Lord—or Lady—you mean.” She teased.
. The baby needs to be fed, at the very least.” He mused, then leaned in to kiss Harry. “Yes, let’s get up and get ready.” He said, sitting up in bed.
“Yes.” Harry answered slowly. “Why?”
“Thanks. I do try.” Harry said happily.
And naked.
Celeste flushed. “I didn’t realize they were getting closer together, I thought it was just more practice ones.” She admitted.
“Oi! Princess?!” Draco shouted, hurrying after Harry, who was already running toward the Great Hall, laughing.

Narcissa sniffed and smiled. “Oh, Draco, you’re going to be a father! A little girl! Oh, thank you for letting me be here for this!” She said, turning to Harry.

Draco opened one eye and yawned. “I hate getting up at the arsecrack of dawn after a night of great sex.” He mumbled, his face buried in the crook of Harry’s neck.
Harry grinned. “So, are you ready to get up?” He asked.
Severus really shouldn't even try it. But he wanted to give Harry the choice to be with Draco on his own, instead of just because he was the only option.
Harry sighed. “I suppose. Elemental magic? Sounds like fun. Can anyone learn?”
Nott nodded. He pulled Draco’s shirt off, throwing it onto the floor. He then reached for Draco’s trousers.
“My dad had some dealings with him last time he was here. Nasty man.” The young man spat, then sighed. “

Harry laughed at that. "Somehow, Draco, I get the feeling you're too cock-hungry to be satisfied by one go 'round." He told the blond.
Harry smiled and nodded. “Deal. Thank you for being understanding.” He said.
Draco flushed. “Oh.”
Draco sighed. “I know. It will go away soon. I’m sure you won’t be sick for the

a responsible flier.”
Draco just shucked the rest of his clothes and pushed them off the bed.
“You look beautiful, my love.” Draco murmured, leaning in to press a quick kiss to his cheek.
“Prat.” Draco said, blushing as he was released.
Harry went to open them and stepped outside into a garden. There was a bench and a small dining table outside, both with charms around them to repel unwanted bugs and water. “Frumos.”(Beautiful.) Harry said lightly.
Draco snorted. “Something feels off about you today. A few magical creature genes only activate at the moment of your birth when you come of age. I think you might have an inheritance.”
“Well, aside from feeling a slight draw to those that would suit you well, no.”
Harry and Draco followed Dumbledore to the new room and waited while he opened the door. “You can set the password to be whatever you wish, just make sure you do so before both of you leave it at the same time, as it will not open for you again without a password.”
“Come on, your… Teeth are clean now. Get in bed so I can… Ravish you.” Harry purred, smirking at Draco.
“Ow.” Draco whined, getting up and helping Harry up as well. “Okay, now that I know what to do, I think I can— ” He suddenly stopped, swaying on his feet as a wave of dizziness overcame him. “Or maybe not. I think I’m done for tonight.”
Harry raised an eyebrow, then popped the berry into his mouth, smiling and shaking his head defiantly.
Harry groaned in pain as a set of knees landed heavily on his gut, knocking the wind out of him. “Oh!”
Draco made no move to stop him but sighed irritably. “Is this really

They ate, then went and put the few things they'd brought with them into the wardrobe in the Master bedroom. It was nice to finally have a place of their own, and both of them headed back to school with smiles on their faces.
, Harry. I’m with you willingly, and I’m going to have sex with you willingly. Why would I need to forgive you for something I’m sure I’ll enjoy?” He added, smiling at Harry.
They crossed the house, Celeste taking in the surroundings as they walked. The house was beautiful, but most of it was an understated elegance, not a brash flaunting of wealth like Malfoy Manor, but rather a quiet assertation that whoever lived here was well-to-do, for sure, but didn’t need to scream it to the heavens.
Draco spoke the words that had been rolling around in his mind ever since he had discovered that he and Harry resonated. “Our souls ring with but one note, both sounding in perfect harmony. We are one whole, you and I, and I vow to find you in the next life, and each lifetime thereafter, for all eternity. To find you again, I leave with you the mark of my love and devotion, and the proof that we are Bound.”
to get out of here!” Draco looked up at his Godfather with big, dewy eyes.
Harry opened his mouth and finally spoke: “Sotul meu.” He whispered, staring into Draco’s eyes, entranced.
*****
Draco gasped, throwing his head back. “I think I may have a tiny idea.” The Vanteera panted, perfectly happy to let Harry have his way, content in the knowledge that they’d always have each other.
“I will not turn you in. As long as I am able to protect you, the Dark Lord will not have you.” He said.
Draco nodded. “Celeste will need time after the birth to recover, but we should be up to venturing out around the middle of July. Will that work for you?”
Draco growled, moving to stand in front of Harry protectively.
Blaise flushed brightly. “I need to leave.” He muttered, turning around.
“It’s the least I could do to repay what you have done for everyone else, Mr. Potter.” She said before leaving the room.
Suddenly, Draco shivered, and the leg holding him up gave out.
Jeremy nodded. “Sure thing. You get out… Mid-June?” He checked.
Two weeks later…
Draco beamed at him, nodding. “And managed to swamp Potter in the process!” He added, then chuckled.
“No way in
“Good work, Potter. You’ve successfully learned Occlumency, thanks to Draco’s help. Now, get out of my sight.” Severus sneered.
Draco snorted. "I don’t think you’re experienced enough to

Severus slowly nodded. “Then I will persist in trying to find him a cure, and will trust your intuition. I hope I am never made to regret it.”
Okay, Harry
, this is where we will come out as well. You will be given a portkey ring that will take you directly to the Master bedroom, the most heavily-Warded room in the house.”
Draco turned and licked his lips, staring hungrily at Harry. “Can’t you see how hot it’s got me? The thought of you, all spread out and begging for me, on top of my godfather’s desk? He’d never know. He’s not leaving his rooms tonight. Seeing me naked is one thing he wants to avoid.”
He quickly dressed, getting his bag ready for his trip to Nott’s tonight, then headed down to join his mother for breakfast.
Harry grinned. “Slob.” He said.
Harry licked his lips in anticipation as Draco tied the blindfold around his eyes, then he heard Draco muttering as he tied his own blindfold, not trusting Harry to spare his hair.
“It’s not a yes, either.” Harry warned.
Draco frowned. “What are you on about? That was
Hermione stared at Draco’s sword. “It’s lovely.” She breathed.
Draco turned to catch Celeste as she stumbled out of the Floo. “Easy, lover. Don’t fall.” He said in amusement.
Harry picked up on his somber mood and stood. “So, are those wings functional, as well as looking absolutely wicked?!” He asked excitedly.
Draco showed her the room.
Draco turned to him, breaking off in mid-sentence, a look of bliss on his face. “Yeah. I have a special affinity with water, apparently, and it was
Harry finished changing and cast a quick spell to work all the tangles out of his curls and make them sleeker, then pulled most of them back and into a ponytail, leaving a few free to frame his face.
“It was nice. It’s cold there, though. And aptly named, because the wind is
“Sure.”
Harry smiled. “She's been doing that a lot lately. I wanted her to be able to surprise you, so I didn’t say anything, but she’s an active little thing. We've got a future Quidditch player on our hands.” He said in amusement.
Harry watched Draco smirk and hummed in approval. “Good. Now, more. Bigger wind. You can do it.”
“What can I do for you, Severus?” She asked.
Draco sighed, letting his wings unfurl as he continued reading the passage he was working on.

Draco nodded. “Good idea.”

She squeaked as they all noticed each other, then suddenly, black wings erupted from Draco’s back, wrapping around himself and Harry.

“Celeste wants crepes. Can you make her some?”
Celeste rolled her eyes.
Draco smiled. “No. A bonding is purely sex magic. It draws on the power generated when two resonating people make love with the intention of joining their souls to one another. It is irreversible, and will last even past death, leading us to each other in the next life.” He explained, drawing the sponge he had bought for this night across Harry’s shoulders, watching the cinnamon-scented bubbles run in rivulets down Harry’s back, making the air smell sweet and spicy.

Draco blinked a few times, than smiled. “We can do that. It’s close enough.”
Draco sighed against Harry’s neck, the breath causing the brunet in his arms to shiver slightly. “No, Harry, I don’t think it’s pathetic. He’s older than you, a werewolf, and this revelation could have a multitude of outcomes. He might be angry, hurt, sad, happy, hell, he might not even believe you at first! I’d be terrified about all the what-ifs in your position, even more so now that you have a baby to think about—Our little Delphini.”

.” Poppy said firmly. “Since you only have a limited time as a female each month, the birth has to be planned out in advance. Your due date will be a week after your female period, so we should plan to induce labour while you are female, a week early.” She told Harry and Draco.
Draco noticed it and chuckled. "That's a nice picture of you. We should keep it."
Harry sucked him clean, then stood back up, releasing Draco’s wrists and kissing him, sharing the taste of his own essence. He hugged Draco tightly, lightly kissing the side of the Slytherin’s neck, as his hands slid over the small of Draco’s back.
Harry and Draco both nodded.
Harry sighed, looking at the liquid thoughtfully. “It works? You’re sure?”
. It could get very dangerous, very quickly.”
He went back in and looked at the bedroom. There was one desk, a small armoire for their clothes, and the bed was huge. It was covered with black hangings which were currently drawn back, and the pillows and covers seemed to be royal purple
Draco smiled. “It
Draco just rolled his eyes and turned away, taking off his clothes. He’d moved one of his uniforms into Harry’s room when they’d married, and every time he changed in the room, the uniform he’d been wearing, once cleaned by the house-elves, was hung in Harry’s wardrobe, ready to be worn again.
Draco shrugged. “Fine, or red.” He relented.
Harry sighed and headed for Severus’ empty desk. He sat atop it, gingerly.
Harry sighed, but nodded. “I fear… This is too much… Pressure for you.”
Severus smirked. "Ah, yes. The cleaning spell gone horribly wrong. I was quite impressed with that story myself." He reminisced.
Draco smirked. “Let's leave the Darker aspects of magic to
Severus snarled. He had just wasted seven galleons' worth of rose hips, and still the altered Polyjuice base, when tested, proved to contain fatal amounts of toxins. He'd need to add even more to speed the process enough.

Fred nodded and headed off to find George, and Harry headed toward the dungeons.
Draco smiled. “Yeah, they are. I’ve been practicing my flying on the pitch while you’re in class with Sev. They work, and I’m getting rather good at using them, too!”
Draco smirked. “Potter it is, then.” He announced.
Severus hummed. “How sure of that are you?”
Hermione frowned. “Hmm, I didn’t consider

Draco sighed happily, curling up on his side, snuggling into Harry's chest. "Mm, that was
The walls were shimmering with wards and protective spells, and the chairs and couches were spelled to resist stains, as well as to conform to the comfort level of each person sitting on them. The fire was burning already, and a small set of French doors were covered by curtains.
Harry frowned. “Um, how about
Draco laughed nervously. “That’s funny, Nott, but you know I’m not willing. So let me go.”
The headline read: Malfoy Heir Married and Bonded at School
Ginny nodded. “Sure. I’m going to see about getting home, Harry. I’ll see you when term starts. If you get a boyfriend before then, I want to meet him personally to warn him of my infamous bat-bogey hex should he ever hurt you.”
Harry shook his head. “She did warn us. Several times.” He turned to her. “Sure you want to watch?”
Celeste shuddered. “Horrible.” She murmured.
“Why is it called ‘Windhaven?’” Harry asked curiously.
“I love you too, and anything you are craving you shall have.” Draco said.
“Dray!” Blaise leapt out of bed, rushing over to his friend and easing Draco to the floor. “Callie!”
Draco hummed, then smiled slightly. “Thanks. Um…” His smile faded. “I also have other injuries…” He motioned to his backside awkwardly.

The inside was beautiful. Not quite as grand as Malfoy Manor was, though. The floor in the entryway was stone, but it was something other than marble. “What are the floors made of?” She asked.

“Damn. Tonight?” He amended.
“That explains why I’ve been lusting after you lately.” Draco purred. He laughed at the look on Blaise’s face. “I’m just kidding. You’re straight, we’re not compatible. Besides, I don’t think I’m ready to lust after

“It also has a small kitchenette, and you can call the elves if you or your wife ever decides to use it, and they will bring whatever ingredients you desire. There is only one bedroom off of it, so give me the rest of today to add on a small nursery and it will be ready for you tomorrow. Just come by my office after breakfast and you and your wife can spend the rest of the morning until lunch moving in.”
Harry retaliated by pulling the dildo all the way out and slamming it back in to the hilt.
Finally, she was done and Draco was able to get off the bed.

Harry closed his eyes and hung his head. “I don’t need it.” He said carefully. “Not yet.” He denied.
Draco brought her to the gates and keyed her into the Wards. “There. You're officially welcome here.

“You're bonded to one by soul-bond. The Wards will recognise you.” Draco said flippantly.
Harry finished cleaning Draco, and slid back up his body, kissing him and wrapping his arms around him. “Was it good?” He asked hopefully, pulling Draco atop him.
Harry frowned. “That sucks.”
“We won’t Floo when you're that close to birth. That’s what Portkeys are for.” Draco said.
“No, of

Harry whimpered when Draco’s hands parted his ass cheeks and hot breath ghosted over his hole. ‘Oh God, if he starts licking me now, I won’t be able to take my robes off all day!’ He thought frantically.
Draco's hips rolled, and Harry felt his hard cock nudge him in the backside. “Are you up to it?” He asked hopefully.
“Indeed.” Severus said, opening the door. “Draco, raised voices generally do not occur when you are in here alone. You’re being a bit obvious.”
Celeste nodded thoughtfully.
Draco gasped. “Nng! Harry! Oh, don’t stop, I’m so—
Draco nodded in agreement. “Good idea. Then we can go back to Gryffindor tower until Occlumency.” His smile faded. “Shit. Snape knows I never returned to his quarters last night. My door was open.”
Draco watched in interest as the contents got smoother and creamier, and when it was thick and creamy, Harry took a large sip, moaning and leaving a pink smear on his upper lip that he licked off.
Draco frowned. “I know. Father always casts the charm while his hair is wet, which is why I don’t do it often, but I’m not going to wander around with my hair like
Draco bit his lip, then nodded. “Okay.” He stood and closed his eyes, feeling the faint buzzing of energy around him, and reached for it. He pulled on it and felt a faint breeze rush over them.
Harry was quiet, working on an essay for another class while he let Draco worry about the brewing. Every so often, he would wind his way through Draco's mind, careful not to disturb the blond, to find a piece of information he had forgotten that Draco remembered.

Harry nodded. “Tonight I can do.”

“Harry… Him? Really?” She asked softly. “Are you sure about this?”

Harry giggled at the ticklish sensation, and then panted, still smiling happily when Draco pulled away.
Draco growled, heading into his room, slamming his door as well.
Harry sat down at the table next to the window and quickly wrote a reply.
Hermione frowned at Ron. “Are you homophobic, Ron?” She asked sharply. “Because if you are, you’d better get over it fast, because I can guarantee you it will be much harder to get over
Draco grabbed Harry's wand from the bedside table and lubed his fingers, then slid the skirt Harry was wearing up and slid a finger in. “I really like that you take off that damnable underwear when it’s just us. Makes for easier access.” He purred.
“That's fine.” Draco hastened to assure him. “We can stay just like this and I'll do all the work.”
“Fuck!” Draco arched back, grabbing onto the pillow behind his head with both hands. “Do it! Oh, please, fucking
Harry watched him undress with hooded eyes. “Mm, so you’re still going to sleep with me?” He asked in a teasing tone.
“What can I do for you, young Mr. Malfoy?” He asked, folding his hands atop his desk.

“So, I’ll just cut off the bottoms of two school uniforms and two regular shirts.” He said lightly.
Draco smirked. “I suppose we can always wait, though, until my
Harry snorted. “You were the one who decided to have our wedding on a Sunday.” He pointed out.
Draco’s eyes widened and he swallowed, torn. Yes, he wanted it, very badly. But he was still afraid to give another person the power to hurt him like that. Plus, he wasn’t sure that Harry wouldn’t regret becoming his mate. “I can’t.” He choked out, then rushed out to dry off and get dressed.

Draco looked around. “This used to be Father's room.” He murmured. He bared his teeth at an inkwell on the desk and snapped, “Tissy!”

“What’s different, Malfoy?”

.” He said without much heat.
“You can’t hurt me.” Draco said surely. “Why shouldn’t I trust you?”
“An idiot?” Fred suggested.
Draco shrugged. “I should have shadow magic, but that’ll manifest on its own, if I do, and I heal faster than normal, as well as possibly having tears of healing, but I’m not sure if that’s myth or not. When… I last cried they didn’t feel any different.” Draco finished softly, remembering that the rape he had suffered had been the last time he had cried.
Draco shrugged. “Sounds good to me.”
“That’s not a no.” Draco said.
I can break that one. It’s practically an
Draco glared balefully at him. "
“I said maybe. You’ll have to be good.” Draco teased, smirking.
Draco bit his lip. “I may not be able to do some of those things… Yet.” He said quietly.
!” Draco shouted, then blushed. “I mean, in different ways, but…” He sighed, seeing the smile on Harry’s face at his words. “Oh, shut up.”
Harry looked at Draco, worrying his lip. “I know you don’t care much for the Weasleys, but Fred’s a good friend, and he’s trustworthy. He’d tell George, of course, but that’s all.
Draco grinned, leaning in to kiss her to silence her. “Oh,
Harry shook his head. “No, but you made Carina kick me in the spleen, or something. Little blighter.” He muttered.
Harry smiled at him. “We’ll keep that in mind, Sir.”
“It is no trouble at all, Mr. Malfoy, you are welcome. Give your wife my best, and I wish you both every happiness in life, and many healthy children.” Dumbledore said.
Harry sighed and sat up. “So, you give me my birthday kiss when I’m too far gone to enjoy it and while I have morning breath?” He whined. “That is

“What-“

Harry smirked, then thrust into Draco, at the same time casting a wandless and nonverbal spell.
.” And left, slamming the portrait behind him.
Severus came into Poppy's office and sat in the chair she had for patients needing a consult and students that were apprenticing under her. She frowned.
Draco sighed, shoulders slumping. “Sure.” He said dejectedly. He’d have to keep his guard up all summer long.
"Can you still get into your vault?" Severus asked, astounded at the quick reply. Was Harry unhappy with Draco?
Draco sighed in disgust. “Yes, but I didn’t want to bare my
until after dinner." He said lightly, then began pounding into Draco with abandon.
“Ar trebui sa-i scriem lui Hermione.”(We should write to Hermione.)
Harry nodded. “Can I ask what you’re going to do with it?”
They both watched, one calm and steady verdant gaze and one shocked onyx, as it shattered against the pavement, and Harry's last chance to go back spread out and soaked into the cobblestones.
Harry smiled brightly, his heart finally resuming its beat, if a little quicker than normal. “I won’t, ever.” His smile grew wider. “You didn’t call me Potter.” He noticed.
.” Harry said softly. He looked up at Draco, his lower lip trembling slightly. “But, Draco, I always wanted to be able to go home after the year and see my parents, and get to know their friends. All the other students got to go home with families that loved them, and mine-“ His voice broke, and he began sobbing.
Draco sighed, nodding. “I agree. She can help us figure out what exactly this is going to do to you. Um, Harry?”
“No one’s going to see us, you said.” Harry pointed out. “And I
“Some of those artefacts do
"Well, one part of you doesn't seem to mind much." Harry teased, wrapping his hand around Draco's cock again, but not applying too much pressure—yet.
Draco laughed. “Don’t feel too bad. I don’t have any either.”
“Yes, well, that’s how Purebloods work. It may seem stupid, but we generally do all right, so we must be doing
Draco stilled at the sound. “Too much? Did I hurt you?” He asked.
Harry and Draco both smirked and laced their hands together, following her as she headed for defense.

“Then he will be leaving directly afterwards.” Severus said. Seeing the gleam in Draco’s eyes, he quickly added, “
Celeste rolled her eyes, then turned to the display case.
Harry rinsed Draco, then took a few minutes to wrap his arms around the blond, indulging in a few deep, languid kisses. He pulled away when his head began to spin and took a fortifying breath. “You certainly have a talented tongue.” He told Draco teasingly.

“Take that inkwell—and anything else Dark—out of this room and store them in your old master’s study. I will sort through the things later.” Draco ordered.
Harry smiled happily. "That's
“I don’t really care.”
‘If it works, Draco is going to hate me.’ Severus sighed as he began cleaning, thinking of the grave disservice he was doing his Godson in continuing his research.
Harry chuckled at the compliment. "Why, thank you." He sat up. "Severus thinks he may have found my cure, thanks to your idea today."
“Conjure a large cup for me.” He ordered.
Harry locked his eyes onto Draco’s and smirked. “Nu misca.”(Don’t move.) He ordered.
Draco headed in, then heard the shouting.
Harry flushed. "Sorry." He muttered, returning his attention to his food.
Draco took a deep breath. “Soon, then.” He sighed. “Merlin.”
Once Harry was washed, Draco rinsed him—thoroughly—and pressed a kiss to his collarbone, since Harry was once again facing him. “Much better.” He said in relief.
Harry batted his eyelashes innocently at the blond, who just huffed and turned his attention back to Severus.

They were surprisingly light, then Draco realized that, like bird wings, the bones of his wings must be hollow. He ran, trying to get airborne for a while, but after a few minutes, his shoulders and chest ached unbearably, and he had only managed to glide a few feet off the ground.
!” He shouted.
He grabbed Harry’s hands and pinned them on either side of his head, lacing their fingers together and pushing forward slightly, barely opening Harry’s entrance, letting the dark-haired teen feel it, but not entering yet.
Harry smiled when the dildo was fully seated. "How does it feel?" He asked Draco, genuinely interested. He hadn't used it on himself yet.
Draco smirked, liking the attention. He liked both genders, and if he was going to be noticed by someone, he wasn’t picky. Admiration was admiration, regardless of where it came from. “Or something.” He secretively replied, thinking of the book on his desk at home, that he had begun looking through for clues on what he was now. Hopefully, he’d get answers soon.
Celeste laughed softly. “You’re probably right.” She agreed. “Let's eat here.”
Draco deserved better than a wife he had gotten because he was, literally, the only option she'd had, after all.
Harry looked back at him. “Do you have a question?” He asked curiously.
Blaise swallowed. “Oh, Merlin. Can you see magic, and hear better, and stuff like that?” He asked nervously.
Harry nodded. “Yes.”
“Oh, yes, five days is

Draco buried his hands in Harry’s hair, pulling the Gryffindor’s mouth to his and kissing him desperately as they stiffened and cried out in unison, the sounds trapped between their fused mouths. They held the kiss as they came down from their high, the desperation melting away and leaving a muted, gentle satisfaction in its wake.
Blaise’s face softened at the harshness of Draco’s voice, and he wrapped an arm around Draco’s shoulders. “It’s alright, don’t talk until we see Pomfrey, okay? And I’ll stay with you until Mum gets back.”
Harry smiled and chuckled good-naturedly. “I suppose we can, but I don’t really want to
Draco kissed the nape of Harry’s neck. “Nothing here.” He said lightly.
“Oh, Harry! Please, I need to come!” Draco whimpered, beads of sweat forming on his brow as he tried desperately to force Harry to speed up.
Celeste sighed. “Right. Alright, then. Lead on.” She said.
Celeste smiled. “Good. How

Draco groaned, thumping his head on the table as Potter and the Weaslette entered the great hall.
Draco smiled. “You have no idea how cute you are, stumbling over your words like that. Don’t worry, I’ll be fine. Here, let’s start with stripping down to our boxers, that shouldn’t be a problem for me.”

"World domination." Draco said, following the comment with a rather convincing evil laugh.
Harry felt as though his heart had stopped, liquid sorrow taking the place of his very blood.
Draco groaned. “Fine.” He got up and went outside, then shrugged. “Alright, big shot. Now what?” He snapped.
Harry looked at him, excitedly. “You’ll be able… To carry me?” He asked.

about what I’m going through.”
This time when Draco’s lips parted, Harry slipped his tongue inside, deepening the kiss and tentatively exploring the warm cavern. Draco tasted of the strawberries and cream he had had for dinner, in lieu of the cake Mrs. Weasley had made for Harry.
Draco sobbed as Harry pulled his tongue out of Draco's arse just when the blond thought he was going to come, Harry's hand around his cock notwithstanding.
Draco curled his lip. “Charming. I was wondering if you could help me with something?”
!” He cried out, tightening himself down on the fingers currently buried within him.
Draco rocked his hips against Harry’s, losing himself in the need for more of this wonderful feeling, this closeness from his chosen mate.
Draco smiled proudly. “It’s all one-way glass. We can see
Harry smiled and nodded. “Yeah.”
Again, when he was instants away from coming, Harry pulled away from Draco's cock and pulled the dildo out.
Harry rolled over onto his back to escape her fingers and asked, “What baby shower?”
Draco smirked. “I kissed a bloke, and it made me incredibly hard. Why? Think you may be queer? If I help you out, you’d have to keep it quiet.” The blond explained seriously. “And I’ll only let you kiss me, and you can touch me, but no touching the bits or my ass. Those are off limits.”
“Frottage frontier?”
Draco stood proudly as Harry bared his body, glad that he had always been so particular about his appearance. They would be a stunning pair, and with their different attitudes, each one complimenting the other, they would be a force unto themselves.
And the next chapter is planned! Thank you to everyone that made suggestions, they helped out a lot! But I am always in the market for more! If you have questions, ask away, it gives me something to write about, too. Suggestions are still welcome, and I will hopefully get this back on track from here!
"Right." Draco agreed.
Draco smirked. "Do you

want to. You’ll like it, I swear! We don’t have to have sex. I could give you a blow job. Would that work?” Draco asked hopefully.
“Whatever. I need to put some healing salve on my bruised dignity.” Draco said, grinning.
Celeste eyed his cock warily. “Yes, I can see that.” She replied flatly.
The blush faded completely and Draco paled. “It’s not that easy. I’m a Vanteera. If I have sex voluntarily, I’m mated for life, and so is the other party, for better or for worse.” He explained.

“Nu imi place de tine.”(I do not like you.) Harry said to Severus, his tone cordial.
Harry pouted. “Asa.”(Because.) He said petulantly.
“No, it won’t.” Harry agreed. “But it will fill the need, at least.” He finished, pulling off his shirt and reclining on the bed nude. He reached for his cock and began stroking, closing his eyes and tilting his head back as he let out a soft moan.
