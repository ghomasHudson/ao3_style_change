Harry turned to run towards the doors as further screams began to echo around him. Passing the stairs up to headmaster's office as Marvolo and others came down it, Harry paused and glared at Dumbledore. "Dumbledore, you need to send the school into lock down mode."
"Indeed, you are right I gift both the heirs Potter, and Zabini, and Lord Longbottom ten points each for common sense and knowledge of the traditions and laws of the Wizarding World."
"The Rite of Ancestry is an odd rite, and a safety measure as a magical on their own cannot enact it but can only be activated by magic itself. It is Rite that is the sole, absolute power of the Family magics. When a child comes much like you who has been betrayed by those who should have taught them, they are left with no one to guide them. The family Magic enacts the Rite of Ancestry to call forth the family vault within the child, and calls forth the ancestors of the house a minimum of three of the line are so chosen and called forth to guide the young heir in the history and power of the family power."
Michalis turns back to the frame to the outside world. “He does, you are the only thing that stays his hand.”
“Denied,” snapped Madame Bones “you are not a law Wizard Lord Dumbledore, you cannot represent Mr. Potter. Please take your place among this body.” Dumbledore took his seat, and Harry closed his eyes for a moment. “Now we can commence. I agree with Amos’s proposition let us vote.”
"Very well," with that Croaker switched out the orbs. "Now this one last I checked it back in May was still showing as active, it is now showing as deactivated, but furthermore as broken and the deactivation date was July 31st." With that this orb too played the prophecy.
“It’s ok Dad, it’s ok, I got to meet the first James Potter he was a Roman Centurion. I also met Michalis Malfoy nee Potter; he was a bearer like me. They all have cool things to teach me.” Harry said brightly his emotions changing quickly. “I was more interested in the fact that you blood adopted me, making you sort of my dad to.”
"The Pendragon army was stopped at the fields about 30 miles away from what is now Potter manor by the Potter army." Harry said a far-away look in his eyes "The two were dead locked before Arthur Pendragon called his armies into a full retreat. Cardoc Potter the Lord Potter of the time held his men strong and had almost given the order to pursue when Arthur used the family gift against Cardoc and his armies, before it could be fully summoned Cardoc surrendered. Instead of executing Cardoc and his commanders, he offered Cardoc his protection to the lands he held. Years later after Arthur had fully conquered the Isles and half of France. Cardoc swore his line to the Pendragon's, he was the first to do so but not the last."
Once embarking on the train just like he had done on the train to Hogwarts back in September, he merged the compartments of the car into one, and his friends quickly joined him.
“No, it’s, well,” at the goblins stare Draco straightened his spine and stood up straight. “it is obvious that Grinholt is not going to be overseeing the Rite today, I would like to be transferred to one of the Egyptian branches to undergo blood Rites.”
Disclaimer: If you recognize it, it's probably not mine It all belongs to JK I'm just playing in her sandbox a little. I do read a lot of Fanfiction so if you see anything else you recognize I may have accidentally incorporated something.
"Of course," sneered Umbridge, "though how much the half-blood will go for will be nominal, compared to if he was a pureblood."
“Indeed, Blood Rites are both much simpler and much more complex. In theory, it is straightforward. A circle is raised, with the same rules and formatting as the ritual of awakening; without the offerings to magic in its place, you are the sacrifice. In the beginning, you would still place the three drops of blood in each point of the star and then lay down on the altar placed at the center at which time a goblin or family member would approach and tie both your arms and legs down with your wrists and ankles showing. The wrists would then be cut along with the muscles in your ankles. At which time the complicated portion of the ritual begins. Your mind and magic will be tested. When asked to describe what they experienced many have said several different things. It, in essence, comes down to both the magic of your birth house and the magic of the house testing you. The stronger and older the family the more convoluted it is. To fail is also complex some have failed and had no visible consequences; other have lost everything up to and including their lives.  The reason, however, it is not often done is not the threat of death, or other punishments but the fact that in claiming that line you also agree to give that line an heir, and are required to have a spouse for each line. With the rising muggle sentiments it began to be frowned upon in the magical world. For example, as you carry both the Potter and Black Titles, even if one is the heirship, then you accept and guarantee that you will have a second son to take up the title, along with a second spouse to either sire or bear that son. If you were to undergo blood Rites for all your blood locked houses and past, you would then be required to have no less than a minimum of 14 children, more than any modern witch or wizard of any status has had in a single generation within Albion in a century.” Sharptooth said with a smile.
“Nikodemus you have to stop this, when that boy wakes up he is going to have the power to destroy them. You know as well as I do that the Le-Fay lord only holds a partial control of the family magics.” Selena said.
"I discovered that at the end of the next semester and decided after the chamber was opened that I just wouldn't apply myself. It's why I was able to do so well last year for the tournament and despite all my other responsibilities have maintained my fifth-place average for my grade level standings this year."
Argh, he was never going to make it to Diagon alley unless he skipped out on his chores and made his escape while Petunia was at book club. It would mean a beating once he got home, but it was worth it if he could gain something that once belonged to his parents. He might even learn that he has a gift he could use against the dark lord next time they face off. But on the other hand, what if it really was all just a dream. Was he willing to take that chance?
Harry was confused by the letter but also wary, he had placed his house on notice that something could happen over break, but he couldn’t give any more notice than that.
"James spoke of you, he said you saved the family in a time when we had few allies, much like now." Harry responded.
“Lord Malfoy are you prepared I'm here to escort you to the council room.” A voice said from the other side of the door.
“That does not explain why, if your houses were not as bound, why one of your houses did not claim the throne?” Theo asked scorn entering his voice.
Luna Lovegood a recent ward of the Potter house stands up answering Neville's request. "The simple answer would be that it is illegal, but as we have a would be king that sees himself as above the law, the answer would be the traditions rules and the absolute laws of Albion. The absolute laws of Albion are the laws and rules that were and are the very foundation of Albion, they were established as at the founding of the Albion, with the claiming of the throne for the Pendragon line. They set the rules regarding the succession in Albion, they designated the positions certain families would fill, the lands that went with different positions and title's, the laws of royal ascension. The only way to change these the absolute laws of Albion is for the summoning of the council, the calling of the heirs and a vote being cast. The council is the full high royal council, of which the king sits, along with the heads of the 13 houses Potter, Longbottom, Malfoy, Black, Le-Fay, Emrys, Evan-star, Mercer, Krum, Sirex, Smith, Devon, and Thames. The calling of heirs would call entail the calling of all the heirs of said lines, along with the calling of the crown prince. If the land has no crown prince of a suitable age to understand, or any of the heirs for that matter, the minimum age being 14, the vote is denied and cannot take place. If they are of the age, the vote is cast and all twenty-four are to cast their vote, publicly and in full view of the court, it will only pass if twenty of the twenty-four votes are for the passing or repealing of that specific law. The last time an absolute law was placed was the time of the third King Alexander grandson of Arthur, none have been repealed since the third, and the vote has been denied for underage heirs since the eighteenth. Our first king Arthur Pendragon the First of that name ruled from 542 A.D. to 586 A.D. since him, we have had approximately 35 Kings rule in almost a millennium, and each one since the second has had a Potter as the head of the armies, and a Longbottom as head of the kings personal guard, the only way beyond a vote for the houses to be removed from their positions, is the death of the entire house, or for the house to ascend to the position of ancestral and claim an empire that is not Albion as their own, otherwise the position immediately passes on to the next Potter in line." Finished Luna sat down, a quiet had settled into the great hall as even Harry had finally calmed.
"Heir Potter if I might ask what in the world you are talking about?" Abraxas Malfoy asked before anyone else could speak.
Harry had just finished putting the last of the breakfast plates in the sink as the doorbell rang. Knowing the comings and goings of the neighborhood Harry knew that the doorbell could only be one set of people his guard.
“Your idiotic bumbling son has signed the death warrant of this house, by challenging house Potter.” Michalis answered.
"When the Grindelwald war started with small simple attacks here and there, a large fiasco in New York, many initially didn't think much of it, yes Grindelwald was to be brought before the ICW for trial, but that was for breaking the statue of secrecy and other reasons, he wasn't thought of as a dark lord yet. Initially it was more guerilla warfare than true war, spreading panic, but no true damage. It was only after New York that he truly began to spread war. With that came battle lines being drawn. Even then it was some time before it came to light that Grindelwald's, true intentions were not just to have the magical rule over the mundane, but for him to ultimately rule us, as king of Albion. Most were stunned, many flabbergasted and enraged, some outright laughed at the thought that he could actually claim the throne. But Grindelwald quickly gained enough followers that some began to suspect he knew a way to do what he claimed. The way he went about it confused us though, as in his desire for power, he searched the lands for any links to the ancestral houses, each and every one of those 38 houses, once thought to be extinct, though recent events have proved that to be false. In his search he entered both the Russian, Egyptian, Empire's along with several other's in his search. He seemed intent on finding the last remnants of the Ancestral houses. We initially thought he wished to force them to claim their birthrights through trickery and torture, but instead he hunted and killed as many of their descendants as he could find. He wiped out entire lines for simply being rumored to be descended from the oldest of our houses."
"I want the brat that stripped me of everything I have built over the past forty years, to be ground beneath our heel, I want him to suffer for want he has done, I want him to lose everything just as I have lost everything." Alexandria replied with a shark like grin.
AN2: I do not own the sorting hats song I took JK Rowling's original and added a few new lines. New version uploaded 2-17-2020
“Harry is currently undergoing the ring settlement of a violent claiming. He is currently unconscious and depending on how much of that the ring chooses to show him, he will be for a while, as it is already at the three-day mark, he could be out till morning. He is going to be absolutely furious.” Neville answered and all those in the mirror call blanched. “For all the ministry’s plans the fact that Sirius Black blood adopted Haldris, making Haldris his heir will be what shoots them in the foot especially when knowing him, he brings this up in front of the ICW at the trial on the 8th of January.” No-one had any reply to that observation from Neville.
Neville reached into his pocket and pulling out his mirror quickly called Tonks. After it was answered he said. “I’m sorry I know its late Tonks but…”
“Well, a few questions if you don’t mind?” Mimsy just nodded expectantly. “Where have you been, and what are you doing here?”
In Albion, this had not happened in the past few centuries because Albion's bearers had been all but nonexistent since the fall of the Pendragon line. Since then only about 120 known bearers beyond the ones in the current generation had been known throughout all of Albion. This raised the question on the power of House Potter, as it now held not one but four bearers. Harry had been forced to prepare to fight with the ministry when the news came out. Two centuries ago when a bearer had died in a duel between two of his suitors, the ministry had passed a law that guardianship of all bearers born in Britain were to be wards of the Ministry and that it alone would decide on who would be their bonded. This law still stood on the books as Arsenio, Artemis, Silver, and Jean-Marc were not born in Britain they were relatively safe; however, Harry had been born in England and through claiming Harry they could claim the others through some of the archaic laws. Harry was however emancipated twice over and was exempt from this law as an heir. However, refusing to trust the ministry he had still built a defense against this as he doubted the Minister would do his research and simply try to force Ministerial guardianship onto him when other purebloods remembered this law.
"You are not authorized to give my patient anything for that matter you are on the list that expressly states you are not to see to him." Ted answers.
"Harry, I know you didn't want to support the defense club but there was no need running and telling a teacher about it." Hermione snapped at Harry angrily.
Harry had every intention of being an older brother to the two boys. Furthermore, he could feel his own house magic be pleased at the idea of protecting Marcus. Marcus who now sat as his heir, would be announced as the Cardemon heir tonight. Harry's magic recoiled at that saying that it should be Potter, but Harry settled it, and clamed himself before settling in for a day of classes and work.
"The only elder houses not bound to the throne of the High Nobility is the ancestral houses. Currently numbering 38, the Russian Empire was the last to have a family gain this title, though no empire holds a family that currently has a sitting lord or head. The title of ancestral is complicated to explain and something we will no doubt cover later. In many ways they have given much to the Wizarding World as a whole, not even I know all the ways or nuances of gaining that title as I believe the closest family from Albion to even start to consider that title is currently headless, grams never said." Neville finished. Hermione and several other muggleborns, along with a few Ravenclaws, looked very overwhelmed.
“Of course, human, follow me.” The Goblin responded as he turned to leave. Harry followed him back to Sharptooth’s office. Once they arrived, he sat in the familiar chair opposite of Sharptooth. “Greetings, Sharptooth, may your gold grow and your blade be ever sharp.”
Students sat around their house tables asking questions of other students about the new fund. Though the High Inquisitor had cut off discussion that morning about it stating that it would be annulled, all the students had seen the entrance of the goblins right before dinner and the sour face of the Minister and some of his entourage. Dumbledore also looked as if his lemon drops were especially sour today.
"Most don't realize that most Lords of our houses are, it keeps the alliance strong." Neville answered before also leaving the Hall.
"Thank you Mimsy, that will be all, is there anything I need to know before I go down." Mimsy shook her head and popped away and Harry walked carefully down the stairs still dressed in all black. As he and Neville, walked to the ballroom where the guests waited, they talked about a few things.
"Now please put the secondary boards away, and please pull out your notebooks." He tapped the board behind him, and the board filled with text as did the boards along the staircases. "I understand that not all of you can see the board, however the boards along the walls will also display what is on the board behind me. Therefore, please take note of them. This is how I wish for you to head your class notes. This will make it easier for you as we go along and will enable you to use the search function on your books. This will also give you ease of access to them as we go along as I will expect you to use the same book from now until graduation, these books will be graded along with quizzes and test that will go into helping you prepare for owls in this subject."
As Harry enters the courtroom, he remembers what Sirius had told him about the levels of the Wizengamot and its seating structure. The lowest two levels of seating will be the 40 or so non-hereditary or public voting seats divided into two rows of twenty.  Next sat the almost 60 Noble seats divided into four rows of about 15 seats. All six of these rows are houses with a single vote. Next are the about 50 Ancient and Noble Houses with 2 votes apiece. They are divided into 4 rows of 12 or 13 seats. Those seats are all the lower court and are addressed as such. About half of these seats Harry noticed were filled. Next came those with the titles of most Ancient and Most Noble with three seats, they were the lowest tier of the high court. Next came the seats of the Most Ancient and Noble with four votes apiece. These where the middle and high courts respectively. Several of the seats throughout the courtroom were empty and some where filled by people even Harry could tell did not belong there. Harry focused on the center as the Minister spoke.
"Well its sort of a big deal. A child connects emotionally to its parents by being shown love and caring and such things. Magically a child connects to its parents magics by similar acts but instead of them being emotional, they are magical acts. Like a tracking charm to keep the child from getting lost, a baby bracelet to keep the child exposed to the magic, little things like that. The first time I remember feeling my father's magic he sent a stinging hex at me for slouching in front of guests, I was seven, I think. I just remember how cold his magic felt, Mother wasn't much different, the magical connection we had from her pregnancy, was completely decayed by time I was nine. When I got Dragon pox at eleven and was forced to wait a whole extra year to attend Hogwarts. I ended up living the year with my Grandfather, he's strict, but I at least have a magical connection with him." Draco explained. "And it's frowned upon and considered neglect for neither parent to have a connection with their child. I would have been removed from my parents care and they would have been sent to Azkaban for child neglect. It would have been considering a blight on the family honor."
Just then Fawkes flamed in with the sorting hat in his talons, "If you had asked Headmaster, I would have told you how any bearer, may enter the bearer's tower." Answered the sorting Hat. "Young man go up towards Gryffindor tower and before you reach the portrait assigned to Gryffindor, you should see a picture of three men sitting gracefully in a window seat, reading. Approach them and tell them bearers' return and smear a drop of blood on its frame it will then allow you to choose a password for the Gryffindor bearer's tower entrance."
"Yes, considering how close house Potter is to Utmost, most definitely. However, that will only cover about 10,000 people. With just 1,000 students in Hogwarts alone, that approximately around about 250 here in Hogwarts that can claim it. Britain alone has 3 more boarding schools and 5 more hedge schools on the high side we'll see 1,000 claimants from Britain alone. 1 million will be far less than what is needed." Answered Griphook.
"Potter, that will be a second detention for your disrespect and 20 points from Gryffindor." Sneered Umbridge nastily.
Laughter sounded from the adults. “What I have done my dear consort is show the young Potter brat his place.” Lucius Malfoy exclaimed. The lone figure of Mikhail Zabini stood in the background his eyes curious at first before going wide. Lord Le-Fay to looked critically at the painting before questioning.
“That sounds like a Potter thing rather than just a Harry thing, my Great, Great, Grandfather had a visit from Charlus Potter while he was still Pharaoh, the transcripts of that visit also say just how interested Charlus was in runes. Which is actually rather surprising.” Alomar asked as Harry catching the attention of a local curse breaker, had started a debate with him.
“You, Lucius Malfoy, in your foolish hunt for power have challenged a bearers absolute rage, a rage that in me saw the destruction of House Malfoys strongest enemies, houses Storin, Crince, and Manner. Haldris fiery rage, desires only the blood of his enemies. Enemies that you now stand as the third, he has made his plans and has set his course, nothing will stay his hand in absolutely burning the ministry to the ground on the 8th. But for our house, for the house of Malfoy he is torn, of you Lucius Malfoy and of you Abraxas Malfoy, he wishes only for blood and almost nothing would stay his hand from destroying this house but one, one little thing alone stays his hand.”
Lord Le-Fay was surprised as the Potter and Longbottom boys left the hall. From the comments around him he was learning that all was not as he had been told in Albion. It seemed he would have to be creative to truly remind the Potter brat his place, he was soon to be king no matter what those two said.
"Done well among the Badgers he would have, but he is not as soft as they are. Many of your badgers will not realize the harsher realties of our world until their later years, and Neville, the lion that he is understands the dangers of our world and has squared back his shoulders and marched on." Alistair answered and then continued.
"Yes, I do, now, did you ask for house Black to be released from the vassalage agreement Sirius." Harry asked back.
After his letter writing was done, he picked up the how-to book on how to work the shelves behind his desk. After reading he quickly summoned the Albion law books from the Head of House Library. Last night James had spoken of the levels of laws in Albion, and Harry felt like he needed to know more. Picking up an older book on the levels of laws written about 350 years before he began to read.
"Another year has come and with it changes throughout the school, the first you will have noticed is that the train arrived a few hours early to accommodate the influx of over 500 new transfer students and 200 first years, we will start the sorting this year as usual with the song and then the first years sorting, we will then sort the new second years and so on and so forth. Until we are finished with the seventh years. As we expect that this will take longer than traditionally you will be delivered snacks, directly onto your plates as we go through the sorting, the traditional feast will begin at the end of the sorting and after the traditional beginning of year announcements. Welcome to another year at Hogwarts let the sorting begin.
"How dare you threaten us like that, you filthy little half-blood." Snapped one of the lords to Marvolo's left side lunging forward and tackling Harry simultaneously hitting Harry and touching the book that had been in Harry's hands at which point he started wailing.
His grandfather had, last night informed him that he would not escape his grandfather lectures by attending Hogwarts. It seemed that the parents of other students had expressed questions on whether or not Severus Snape's word could be trusted as he had told Lucius that Draco behaved like a perfect pureblood heir, and as proven by Potters words through the exchange of boons in the Wizengamot chambers, Draco had not acted as a proper pureblood heir ought. It seems they wanted a second opinion, and the board of governors had chosen two, in the form of his Grandfather Abraxas Malfoy being the Wizarding culture, and Traditions Professor and Heir Levine being the new History of Magic professor. The board had petitioned a stall on the other classes to have a chance to plan out requirements and such for those classes properly. The Wizengamot had voted and approved that they would have to be added within the next three school years. Draco wasn't sure what to think of it.
With his morning absolutions finished he walked downstairs to the dining room. “Calia bes serving breakfast this morning. What be master Harry wish to eats.” Asked a House Elf pooping in and pulling out his seat.
"Generations span between James and Michalis, I fall between them, for my time, Rome was not yet a distant memory, however Arthur had passed, and Albion was expanding its borders. We were not yet the heads of Arthurs cumulative armies, but we did head the armies that hailed from our lands. The time had come and Arthurs grandson still yet newly crowned the second Pendragon King, made a call to arms, and due to a situation in the family at the time, I as his heir led the men to battle."
Harry turned hearing the further cracks of apparition from behind him and saw approximately four dozen Potter Hit-Wizards arrive to aid in the rescue, a cheer went up from the ICW volunteers and investigators that had already been there. Harry smiled, turning towards the building before asking investigator Smith, "Have you already gotten the readings you need magically for your investigation?"
For Neville the past few days had been a blur. It was hard to believe today was Wednesday and Harry had only received Sirius ring on Sunday. He had confirmed on Monday to Harry that despite the earlier time he would undergo Blood Rites with him. Now looking around the room he was feeling ill at the prospect. The room was square with five rows of raised stone beds with five beds in each row. Each stone bed was a slab of rock on top of a stout pillar that sat at about waist height. On each of the stone slabs were carved a circle that folded over the corners of the slab, as it was only half as wide as it was tall, you could see the edges of the circle on the sides and bottom of the slab. The beds in the fifth row, on the far side of the room where raised on a dais, with only one of these beds prepared. As they entered Harry saw a set of Goblins prepare another bad in the first row and change the name cards of that one with the one next to his. He was curious as to who the newcomer was until a voice behind him asked.
“Well, beyond the boy suffering from a mild case of exhaustion that has shown signs of being a few weeks old. Lord Potter or as I should say Lord Potter-Black is suffering from a violent death transfer. For those of you who don’t know what that is. A violent death transfer is when the heir’s ring transfers into the Lords ring due to a violent death of the previous lord or head of house.” The medi-wizard answers.
Harry and Neville were then both escorted to a private dinner with the Dowager Queen and then to a suite of rooms that would be their rooms for the duration of their stay.
"It's not her words Grandfather, it's what I saw. There were 4 options, paths to take the first two both saw the destruction of Malfoy Manor, and I have no doubt our line. The 3rd and 4th in different ways saw to the preservation of our line. We persevered, I saw my future son, my firstborn, I saw the return of Camelot Grandfather.
Harry had been briefed by Luna's father as to the fact that she was a vision seer. Which was, actually as he looked at the letter very revealing. With that Harry reached for his letter opener and slit open the envelope. Pulling out and opening the letter he began to read.
"Well not that I haven't found with Albion law that lets you escape it. I need to look over the bearer's rights bill under Albion law. I had truly not realized how far the Wizengamot has strayed from true Albion law. If our next monarch comes from outside Britain, we will be in for a rude awakening. As far as I can find all laws will be automatically transferred back to the Albion laws as ratified by our last King. If he comes from the pureblood aristocracy of Britain, I don't know what, we'll do." Said Andy.
“Well, I do not see why we must this, you can hand the meeting over to me, and I’ll take it over from there.” She said. To which Harry glared once more.
“Close, five generations, considering the political power they held at the time. Five generations that did not count toward the title advancement, but besides that five generations wherein house Malfoy almost lost their own title, with the entire mess with the Weasley clan happening at the same time. On top of that in the three generations before the house went into dormancy, the house of Malfoy had no spare heirs survive to maturity, that did not take up the mantle of Lord Malfoy themselves. Because of the dire straits the house fell into, the Alomora house fell into dormancy after only three generations.” Draco continued.
“Albion’s house of pendragon is returning; I wish to know what houses would be best suited to rise in the wake of a rising king.”
I must ask your pardon for my impolite imposition as to write you, without first being introduced but after seeing visions of you, growing ever more solid, for almost a year now, since the death of my husband. It has become clear to me that you are very important to the future of this Empire of mine.
“I am aware Draco, I am aware, but for me to pull off what I intend I will need all the power on my blood that is rightfully mine.” Harry answered from behind them both. As he saw Harry, he could not help but notice the guards in the room besides the goblin ones.
Hermione just gave them disbelieving looks and Harry knew she was going to be in the Library over the next few days as classes didn't start until Monday.
Sirius, Neville, and Harry walked towards the exit talking amiably about different things as the two young men spoke enthusiastically about their summer. While Sirius listened happily on. They were however stopped by to figures suddenly in their path. The two quick open palmed slaps that landed on Harry’s faces quickly saw to all conversation stopping and focusing on the group as Harry’s guards immediately had both girls to wand point.
“I would be very careful about what you say next Lord Rimier, the wards of Albion are very close to activating, and it seems that they are taking a very large exception to your words.” The other lords in the room very visibly flinched. Harry new that the last time the wards had been close to activating had been more than a century ago, when Albion had almost come to civil war. “Allow me to remind this body of a few key truths that they seem to have forgotten. By the law of Albion, at the time of the last king’s death, the ICW was established. The ICW was placed to be a binding international stage wherein Albion could still interact with the other nations of Avalon without fear of attack as they stood without a king. The Wizengamot, house of Lords within each of Albion’s country states was formed, to oversee the enacting of the kings law, and to pass laws to aid in keeping that country state safe through the passage of time. This body has seemingly forgotten that all laws passed by this body must stand in accordance with the greater laws of Albion. Until now the house of Potter and the house of Black, have foolishly allowed this, once but no more. You minister Fudge have until the end of the yule holidays to get your house in order, if you fail to do so, I will be placing the country state of Britain under full Marshal law of house Potter, until after the current crises with Grindelwald has been dealt with, and I have the time to sort through the mess you have all created.”
"You filthy blood traitor has no right to speak to my aunt that way…" Susan snapped back before she was interrupted and the room descended into chaos, it took the professors a good half an hour to regain control of the class before giving up, and dismissing the class an hour early. Hermione quickly pulled Harry aside and into a private room.
"That right there is why my grandfather is now teaching a culture class at Hogwarts and those objects where taught last week and is also the reason why Lord Potter will not be charged with anything." Draco retorts.
"The future is a burdensome thing, young wizard, for all of us, there are paths we take that solidify our fates, and once those paths are chosen, our paths are set. Sometimes it is a series of choices for others a single choice decides the fate of your entire life. Your father was one such as these I gave him a prophecy that said he would have a chance for power twice, but that one would be false and the other genuine power. The false path would give him power for a time, but it would ultimately cost him and that his false power would be useless when he needed it most, that in the end for all his power history would not remember him, as anything but misguided. Once spoken, once acknowledge such prophecy has power. Knowledge of the future young heir is not a thing to seek without respect for that which you seek."
Ted Tonks waved Pomphrey away as he began to scan Harry before moving Harry's clothes out of the way showing his shoulder. He then took a moment to see to read the results of his other scans. "Here this should heal that." Madame Pomphrey said attempting to give Harry a potion before being stopped by Ted. "What is the matter with you Tonk's he needs this, or he'll bleed out."
“Now for Material, we have Acromantula, Kelpie, Dryad and Nymph silk, as well as woven Nieman, Gryphon and Hypogryph fur, along with several others. We also have some very high-grade cotton if that is what you wish.”
Walking into the great hall he was not surprised to see speculative looks being thrown his way as he sat down for breakfast. "So, Neville what did the Prophet say about my date with Viktor yesterday?" Harry asked Neville who was reading the paper.
For Harry the experience was far more heartbreaking, he watched as Sirius was arrested and then his treatment in the Aurors cells. He saw the gloating of Malfoy, and Fudge. How Delores Umbridge entered the cell and taunted Sirius about the plans she had for Harry. He felt the moment Sirius despaired. Harry watched through Sirius’s eyes as he was dragged once more to Azkaban and placed in holding cell and be told that he would have visitors shortly. He watched as Sirius walked to the window and spoke.
“Now that presentations are finished when will you be handing over the lordship to my dearest mother. We have made many plans on what to do to make the house great once more and pull it out of the squalor it has fallen into.” Said, Vladimir.
"Isn't warranted, almost an entire family line is murdered and over a millennium of traditions and history gone, isn't enough to warrant a desire for revenge. If that is the case than your father sure deserved to die in Azkaban, didn't he Dumbledore."
“The problem and the unexpected result of the Gold Centurion was that it was able to teach the Iron Centurions all the offensive magics it held; the legion then held both the defensive powers of Rome as well as most of its offensive magics as well. The destroyed the Gold centurion and turned on Rome, they almost destroyed the entirety of Rome before the house of Potter made a pact.”
Here Harry interjected. "I suggest you tread carefully in your words, before you generalize and comments like that. My nerves are already strained today, and comments like that will only anger me considering I have already proven that I can wield the Albion wards, as I did with Prince Dimitri. That is not a wise move to make. As I feel this is information that needs to be clarified on, I will be taking us slightly off topic. For your information that is only true if the muggleborn is a true first-generation witch or wizard and has had absolutely no witches or wizards in their family tree. Hermione, like my own mother is classified as a squib born witch, as she received an inheritance of family and house magics. Even if that family and house magics are locked to her and others it does not mean that it is completely absent, and unable to reinforce her own magics with that of family and house magics. It shows in her potions work, as Miss Granger has been claimed by the Dagworth-Granger house even if for other reasons her guardianship remains with me. She was listed as a non-heir and it shows in her constant O potions exams since we started Hogwarts. Mine can very clearly be seen in my defense grades."
"My condolences, my sweet on this most disheartening day. May your day spent in memory, honor your family well." Viktor said as he handed Harry a fully in bloom black mourning rose. The other heirs echoed Viktor's sentiments and handing Harry a black rose as well before Harry and Sirius silently left the hall.
“Well unfortunately my mother and I won’t be attending the Malfoy Ball this year, I have to deal with my cousins as Rome is having a large solstice celebration this year that grandfather is requiring everyone to attend.” Blaise Zabini commented. “What about you Granger?”
"You, Hermione are a commoner, it's not me trying to offend or demean you. It's just one of the facts of our world. You are new to magic, you don't have the information on magic that we do. For most of us, the laws of magic that we study in class, is common knowledge that we are raised with." Neville continued.
"One moment I have an additional call coming in, it's Andy would you like me to add her?" Sirius asked.
Harry having enough answered in a calm voice. “No, they are here to pick me up and be my escort throughout the alley today, and if all goes well it will be the last time, I ever step foot into this house. Now I’m going to go open the door and invite them in, then we are going upstairs and fetching my trunk, and we are leaving, if luck is on my side, then I will never have to see you again.”
"As to you other questions. It's sort of a rite of passage. Once a Malfoy turns sixteen they are cut off from the family accounts and are left with their trust fund, and a million dollars, they have 5 years to turn it into at least 2 million, if I can manage to beat my Grandfathers score of 5 Million I can immediately get access back and have control over a portion of the investment vaults not just receive a yearly stipend. However, I don't know where to start and talking to Gringotts hasn't really helped. I could invest it but the markets unstable right now. What I am investing already from my trust fund is only making 8%." Draco stated looking off into space.
"May your gold grow and your weapons remain sharp, Account Manager Sharptooth, I understand and accept these terms as I am Harry Potter."
“Dragon’s Moor was the Potter seat of power and influence, it was where I was born, and where the knights of Albion trained. It was the headquarters of the Pendragon war machine, well outside Camelot. As Camelot was our capital and our kings preferred to keep the soldiers from there less they be wooed from his service into the services of his lords. That one fact should reveal how trusted our house was to the kings of Albion.”
"Very well, consider this your second test Lord Le-Fay, if a single student dies because of your stupidity, and ignorance of the ways of Albion, you will fall your second test." Harry answered stalking away as the rest of the defense study group also joined him standing on the bridge entrance into Hogwarts waiting to see the attack coming and come it did. With one single final boom echoing off the castle walls the wards fell, and a handful of Giants bursting through the trees of the forbidden forest and wizards casting spells from where they had been hidden in the forest.
“Is the Wizengamot ready for trial all my godfather asks for is a just and honorable trial with veritiserum. If they are I can have him here in the next 5 minutes,” he said with a nod towards Alrick who quickly left the room.
5. All said restrictions are required regardless of bound status, this includes lines listed as blood locked. It is the responsibility of the protectorate house to inform said inheritor of the proper rites and procedures of all ranking houses."
"A wise suggestion as always, perhaps with Delores as High Inquisitor we can make it required for any student she deems necessary without informing the child." Said Fudge.
"I can see in your eyes you wonder how this ties in to what I spoke of before. At the family level, the initial magic is weak, just forming, but easily controlled. By the time a house achieves Noble status, the Family magic has gone through its first maturity and gained limited sentience. It can do a few things on its own enable the Rite, locating heirs, and of course, chooses those that should be gifted with it. But it is still young and has limited control."
“Well, yes, it is, but it’s also known that the myth that a necromancer can reverse the kiss is a lie as well.” Neville answered.
As visitors and allies joined the four for dinner that evening some where rather surprised by the difference between the boy they saw today, and the Lord they had seen in the Wizengamot a scant few weeks before. Reconciling the difference between the two had several lords shaking their heads, while older lords could only draw similarities between him and Charlus, who they remembered spoiling young Alexandria, at such dinners. The following evenings fully formal dinner with many other lords and ladies of the Wizengamot, allied, and not saw the return of the strict and professional man they were coming to know.
Harry reaches into his bag and pulls out his copy of the Hogwarts charter quickly flipping through the pages and stating. "Deputy headmistress, I call upon your power as head of discipline for the students, by article 3 section B of the uniform code. All heirs or lords of any line may wear the clothes befitting their station in all areas and to all functions of the classes excluding classes, they may attend as a student. As such I appeal Professor Snape's point deductions. Furthermore, according to the Uniform code, article 1 section 3, All bearers are to wear a denominator of their status in the appearance of a different Hogwarts uniform described below. I won't read further as this is material you as teachers and furthermore as Headmaster are to have memorized. If you look at Jean- Marc's robes he is wearing the traditional Hogwarts bearer robes. As such he is in uniform and cannot be penalized."
"You ask many questions young one, but have patience, I will answer all of them and any others you may ask, but first will you answer my questions young heir?" The man looks at Harry, who finds his eyes, and his face unreadable. Harry wants the answers to his questions so much that he almost demands his answers not in the mood to be questioned but as he looks at the man, he feels that such behavior will get him nothing. There is a feel to this man, an aura of power that makes Harry first pause to think before he answers.
Harry nodded he got the picture. "It's why I'm hesitant to do blood Rites at all, I'm scared I'll get trapped taking the Pendragon test as well."
"That will be fifty points apiece from Gryffindor and detention for a week for insolence." Dumbledore replied coolly, a hint of anger beginning to rise in his voice. "The houses of Longbottom and Potter had no duty at Nurmengard today…" Whatever he was going to say was lost by the sudden appearance of the five black knight from behind Harry and Neville.
"You have to understand that over ninety percent of the elder nobility are sworn to one of those houses and stand as part of that houses court. Without sitting heads those ties can't be broken. Even if someone stepped forward tomorrow and took up one of those title's those house that wish to break ties couldn't until they passed whatever stipulation the head at the time wanted from that house." Blaise Zabini continued.
Mimsy fetching him for supper was the only thing to call him away. After dinner he returned to the hall and spent much of the night listening to tales of the history of the house of Potter, its victories, and defeats. As Harry climbed into bed his mind swam with the stories.
Final thing due to circumstances out of our control, i.e., Real Life, my Beta's have left this fic. This means that I need a new beta, P.M. if you are at all interested. As always Read and Review.
Making sure he had everyone's attention, the head of ICW investigations began to speak. "This morning as usual 16 ICW guards left to relieve the 16 guards already stationed at Nurmengard Prison. They returned fifteen minutes after they had left to inform me that they could not take up their posts, for the prison was no more. Shortly afterward I left with several investigators and the guards and discovered rubble and ruins left in the wake of whatever happened. As we speak my men are already clearing the grounds of debris and attempting to locate and identify as many bodies as they can. It looks to be a massacre of everyone there, the question is by who."
Thinking of this he looked at the books in front of him. History, Traditions the books covered many things forbidden to be spoken of in the presence of those not in the know, not of your blood, or of some relation to you. These where the books on family magics the Rites and rituals the ministry could not simply outlaw but wished to make it all but illegal to perform. Here were the Rites such as Blood Rites, and the Rite of inheritance. Years ago, when he was still a Hogwarts student, Mortimer Malfoy, Abraxas own grandfather had taken him to Gringotts and paid for him to have the Legacy, and Inheritance tests performed.
"Why make it into an Albion fund then it covers all the countries of Europe, not just Britain, and furthermore why open it to other houses?" asked Neville.
"Indeed, well I am certainly glad my Grandfather went through all the trouble of ensuring his name was cleared from the whole Grindelwald mess, though how people thought he was a supporter of the man, who killed both his father and his two older brothers I have no idea." Viktor Krum said coming up from behind them. "My grandfather received our confirmation of protectorate standing this morning, we were among the first. Father wanted me to return to Bulgaria in the light of said news but, due to other reasons I sought the permission of my grandfather to stay, going as far as to finally quit the national quidditch team for a time to achieve some of my own dreams rather than my father's expectations."
“What,” shouted Vernon “You see here boy if your Aunt and I have to put up with any of your freakishness it’ll come out of your hide. You hear me boy.” Another knock at the door sounded. Petunia looked out the window.
"Well that's one way to show exactly why you are nothing but a mudblood." Theodore Nott muttered loud enough for the entire room to hear, from further down Hermione's row.
“And the house of Potter has many homes and investments overseas, we don’t have to bank with Gringotts and nowhere in the treaty does it state that a British born wizard must bank with Gringotts, just that Gringotts is the only bank allowed in Magical Britain.”
Albus watched as the doors to the great hall were slammed open and several ministry representatives, several Wizengamot lords, and Lord Le-Fay entered the room. They were escorting a gentleman and his entourage. A gentleman that Albus recognized. Albus made to rise before the department head of international affairs spoke up.
“It is nice to meet you your majesty, I am Neville Longbottom, and this is Haldris Potter. What did you mean that, it is because Albion is without a king?” Neville asks.
“Not without our charge and a few answers I’d say.” Turning to address Harry. “My lord my name is Alrick, and I am head of your guard team for the day. If you would follow my companions Edward, and Corsair they will escort you upstairs, to fetch your belongings, I think I will stay down here and get a few answers so we can be on our way.”
Harry had been surprised at just how fast the remaining three weeks of October passed, before he knew it, it was the last week of October and they were brewing potions in his tutoring class at last and his defense tutoring had moved on to sixth year work. His other classes had started working on larger more innovative and dangerous projects that Harry had to keep reigning himself in on, as he also delved farther into the family Grimoire as well. He found many a lost branch of magic hidden in the family tome, even as he discovered why his family had hidden said magic away.
With that the sorting commenced with many an heir glaring quietly at the headmaster quite angry with him many were going to contact their parents to pull out the families copy of the Hogwarts Charter. There was nothing to discuss Harry thought they either obeyed, the school laws or Harry brought the headmaster and the school governors before the Wizengamot court for High treason. Harry watched the remaining sorting and the speech given by both the headmaster and the toady witch from his trial, Delores Umbridge, impassively, not commenting on it when Hermione did. In his opinion the ministry was a day late and a dollar short on interfering with the running of Hogwarts, now the old houses were stepping in to do so. Evidenced as well by the other teachers that would be joining the staff this year. With over 700 hundred students being added to the almost 300 previous students bringing the total of 200 students in both first and second year, around 150 for third through fifth, and around 75 for sixth and seventh years. This meant that the previous method of only one teacher for all main subjects was no longer enough as such the main teachers would only be teaching 5th through 7th years. They would have two teaching assistants that would aid in both teaching the younger years and in grading assignments. Dumbledore introduced the new teacher and the new teaching assistants for all the classes, the students were dismissed to their common rooms, as Harry was asked to remain and wait for the headmaster. Many an heir to the older lines remained as did Harry's cadet's.
Harry placed the rings on said fingers, and Sharptooth then continued not allowing Harry to speak. “Now that that is finished the call can be assembled. As it is, just for the House of Potter’s artifacts, it will take about 2 days. If you return on the 2nd, we should be able to go over that, and we can speak of shares for the daily profit as well.”
“Here’s what is going to happen, and this will be the only thing saving the Goblins from my anger. On the solstice I will be undergoing a full Blood Rite, with intent to claim five houses. After I go under, I do not care who else is also in the ritual room, all goblins will leave the room. The only people in the room besides those undergoing the Rite will be Potter family guards and security forces. If anything happens to anyone in that room that my guards have to inform me of, then I will personally, execute your entire clan, and will keep executing Goblins until I can find a clan that is loyal to Albion’s crown. Am I clear?” Harry asked, Narlfist answered.
“Agreed,” said Edward “there are more than a few good ones on High street along with some high-end shopping we can go tomorrow if you would like?” Harry nods, and they are then escorted to private bedrooms in the master’s wing of the manor. Harry calls Mimsy and asks her to draw him a purifying bath as he has a few rituals to do.
Harry woke up on Sunday the 10th to his mirror ringing, with a call from Sirius. "Sirius do you realize it is Sunday morning and I was actually looking forward to sleeping in this morning before, being forced to deal with a Malfoy, and an obnoxious Hufflepuff as part of my four-person group for the History project due next Friday." Snarked Harry.
As even around them the rest of the fighting began to slow, as they focused on the fighting between the two iconic men.
“You are late boy,” snapped the Minister “take a seat we don’t have all day.” He said as he pointed at the prisoner's chair seated in the middle of the courtroom floor. Looking up and spotting Alrick he nodded towards him and sat. The chains rattled but stayed put.
Seeing that about half an hour had passed, he then began by writing each family with children not yet in school a letter, inquiring about the welfare of the child, their schooling, and such things, as was his responsibility as head of house. For the most part this was one standard document that went out to every house, the only difference between them being, that they had the family and child's name on them.
As they settle entered the second to last car on the train Harry, in a quick transfiguration changed the sixteen-individual compartment, eight along each side, into one large open compartment, with benches and seats. This would allow more people to sit and talk instead of being forced to move from compartment to compartment, to talk other groups. This also allowed for Harry to keep an eye on all the children under his house's sponsorship and enabled him to inform them of the same rules that applied to them, and that the staff had been informed of. Silver, Jean-Marc, Artemis, and Arsenio, all took a seat next to Harry. The four bearers had gotten to know each other quite well over the past several weeks and become good friends. Harry had noticed how easy it was for him to get along with the other bearers, things he said, emotions he felt the way he interacted with his magic, they all understood. It was enlightening and revealing as to why bearers sought out other bearers.
Choruses of “Yes, my lord,” and versions of such echoed around the room as Harry dismissed them for dinner.
"It is formally announced across Albion by the Goblins Sunday and will be available for use Monday the Goblins have even agreed for a small fee to enter all the top Albion registered schools Monday night to test all the students, at those Schools. I have to go Wizengamot calls."
Once arriving in the master’s study, he quickly removed several memories from second year placing them in glass jars to be stored in, he than quickly wrote a letter to the dwarves, regarding rendering and selling the basilisk. After sending the letter and memories with Hedwig, he wrote a letter to Sirius informing him of what had recently happened and that he had not been removed from the wards, he ended with an invite to visit and to bring those he thought trustworthy.
"Yes, it is true, what of it, Viktor," Sirius confirms, his eyes full of suspicion as Harry's eyes also harden with suspicion.
With all this on his mind Harry walked into the great hall, eating happily and chatting with his friends. With all the activity around him, Harry almost missed the letter when it had arrived. With the mirrors he had given to most of his friends or allies that needed to contact him, few letters were sent to him that weren't packages left on his bed in the dorms, or updated catalogs and advertisements for new shops throughout Albion. So, this letter stood out amongst the rest. Many Gryffindor's craned their heads around their friends to get a good both at it and at the exotic bird that brought it. For instead of the traditional owl bringing the letters Hedwig particularly, this was a giant hawk. Taking the letter from the Hawk as he felt Hedwig land on his shoulder Harry was surprised to find the seal on the back of the letter.
After leaving the Hogwarts grounds Harry took the offered arm and allowed Sirius to apparate the two of them from the Hogwarts grounds to Godrics Hollow.
"You are well aware that declaring war on Britain means declaring war on Albion are you not?" Harry asks focusing once more on Dimitri and ignoring Marvolo. Dumbledore stiffens against his chair feeling a shift in the wards of Hogwarts. His eyes search the room for a threat that wards would react to, to cause a disturbance of this magnitude but can find nothing.
“Well as you are not of Ancient status lord Cranston, nor even close I suggest you keep your nose out of the business of the eldest houses, you are here to witness the decision of the 13 of us, as House Potter and house Black must abstain from voting. It has long been held that the Eldest keep watch over their own, it was obviously a mistake to allow you younger houses to speak in Heir Potter’s trial as you all obviously need to return to finishing school. Once again you are of lesser rank, by the degree of King Arthur himself, the lessor does not judge the higher status man, for he knows not the responsibilities of that man. Even the King was only answerable to his advisor’s in the Ancestral houses not to even our elder houses, for we are lesser to them and they are the equals to the Royals.” Spoke lord Marshall.
After the bombshell Sirius had informed them of, the three separated each going their own ways to burn off some of the anger, they were feeling at the current situation with an agreement to meet for dinner at six-thirty. Neville went to the greenhouses to burn his anger off by battling and experimenting with the plants. Sirius went to the dueling room to cool off battling several opponents at once. Harry first went to the fencing room and exhausted himself fighting four opponents at once, before retreating to his room to take a nap once exhaustion set in. If he was able to meet with one of his guardians that was merely a bonus in his mind, maybe then he could start brainstorming.
“Egypt suffered for a century without a king after Cleopatra was slain by Rome, when a pharaoh finally rose, we found many things easier to do again. The theory is that Gaia the great mother, set up our empires long ago, and that we the magical peoples were created to have people rule over us. Even if you look at the Oceanic, and African Congresses, only specific lines can be nominated to the head position of absolute President, there may be some form of people’s representation involved but ultimately it is still somewhat decided beforehand. Even here in Egypt when our father the Emperor chose an heir, many assumed it would be Xander, the oldest of my fathers’ sons, his ascension was supported by much of the court yet when the people spoke, they said Alomar. When the priests were asked, they to spoke Alomar’s name hearing the will of the people.” She took a breath and stopped them to get drinks for a moment before continuing.
In defense they had been moved into three groups for bladed work. Beginner, Intermediate, and Trained. The Beginner group had all been given dream bracelets and instructed on how to use them to join nightly dreams with their partners to practice, as time did not run fluidly in dreams, they gain precious extra hours doing this. All the students had been happy to gain this needed tool. Of the nearly fifty students in the combined class about 20 where in this group, all were returning Hogwarts students.
"A few however, they would all be costly to you and to your vaults." Griphook answered. "The cost for the basic inheritance and legacy tests is 50 galleons each and that will not change for anyone not even the ministry. The high cost is the reason many cannot afford to have the test performed."
"To much father, the debts being called in alone with the interest they have accrued over the past half a century would cripple our house. I can't even argue the amounts or fault the brat as the letter includes a copy of the original signed contracts, that give the amount and the explanation of how interest would be accrued according to the Gringotts system and a full document of all of the announcements Gringotts has made of the changes to interest accrual. It even has the clause about our right to refuse to pay if, our sworn ancestral houses seat stands empty, and the clause of petitioning the crown and the one house Potter was sworn to about staying the hand of house Potter. With the crown standing empty, and Potter answering to none but themselves we can petition none to stay his hands he has full rights by Albion law to move forward at any time he so chooses. My only question is why now, why tell us at all, without calling in the contracts as due." Lucius answers and questions, not understanding why.
Frowning she answered him "I had asked what was on your mind, but I think you answered that. Did you remember that we have class today?"
“Neville, there is no reason for you to come this morning, it's just a Wizengamot meeting. Just because you now have the heirs ring, doesn’t mean you are old enough to run the family. If I had my way you wouldn’t have the ring yet, I have no idea how you got it. This behavior just proves you aren’t ready.”
Hermione listened carefully taking notes as Professor Sevine spoke of a time before Albion, when magic was wilder, less controlled, he spoke magical creatures she had never heard of, and of the Arcane arts. The lesson was illuminating and at the end of the lesson he pulled the sheet off the black board. It clearly said, "Why are the Arcane Magics not taught in modern schools, explain why and when did this change?" Shortly after she finished writing it down, she left the classroom and headed to the library unsurprised as Ron Dean and Seamus all headed back to the common room to play games or take a nap until DADA.
“Do you think, after your stupidity that I would answer that. You Abraxas Malfoy who know the story behind my rage and yet okayed the savage murder of Harry Potter’s last remaining link to his parents.” Michalis answered a cruel smirk adorning his features.
“Please light your wand for innocence and leave it darkened for guilty.” She said to the topmost row of seat reserved for the houses of Most Ancient and Most Noble status. All 13 wands lit up if a few were hesitant no one said anything.
"That is not the Potter house's prerogative." Snaps a member of the Wizengamot that had escorted the prince.
"I assume you intend to have the test's performed tonight?" at the girl's nod Neville continued, before Harry could answer. "Imagine if tonight your tests showed you to be heiress of 2 minor dead houses and to be a non-heir member of either the Nott or Goyle lines, and you had a major dead house as well. Your new guardians would be the Nott house as they have the stronger political stance at the moment than the Goyle house. They could then forbid you from ever going home, remove you from Hogwarts, and numerous other things including a marriage contract with someone of their choosing not just for you but for several generations down the line. They could make five different marriage contracts that end up in your two times great granddaughter marrying the then heir Nott enabling said heir to claim all three title's you inherited. Now say you didn't come up with any house ties that currently have a head, as you have no main guardian other than your magical guardian you still fall under the ministry's custody and full custody at that come graduation. The ministry then has the same power, and the ability to award your guardianship to whomever it so pleases, in this case more than likely to the highest bidder. Something you must remember as well is that polygamy is not outlawed in the magical world, so that marriage contract could see you becoming just one in a number of wives. Harry gave you protection by forcing the houses that wish to take on these guardianships to be of a certain caliber and to disavow their absolute control of your life. It also prohibits the ministry from claiming a house to be unfit for guardianship and merely gifting it to any other, it has to be another house that has been accepted by the funds contract and guidelines." Neville finished saying.
Finally, she took them up into the family wing of the house. “The family wing is for those with Potter name only it has 32 guards suites on either side of the entry to the wing. Four suites on each floor. The first through fourth floors be school rooms for children, training rooms, playrooms and studies for different members of the family. The 5th and 6th floors be having the children’s bedrooms beyond the nurseries. The seventh floor be the bedrooms of the Lady of the house, her maids, and any other consorts the lord may take. The topmost floor bes the lord's floor it bes having the lords bedroom, his bathroom, main family ritual room, the four guardsy suites, the lordsy private office, and the Master Library with summoning the ability to the family library. Its also bes having the hallway of portraits. Theys all bes slumbering but theys wake up soon in a couple weeks.” With this news all four men decided they were hungry and tired. They returned to the closest family dining room for dinner.
Harry shoos both younger boys and the other students below fourth year to their dorms before giving his goodbyes and retiring himself. Leaving a room full of curious minds behind him. Curious as to the answers to the questions asked, and curious as to the relationship between Harry and Marcus, that Marcus would know Potter family secrets.
"I didn't restrict those houses, your houses heads or sitting lords are among those that were accused of following a dark lord at some point in time and have not cleared their names with Veritiserum or the equivalent, as such they are prohibited from taking the protectorate position." Harry replied.
“I dare say so, the weather outside is stunningly beautiful.” Harry answered before a knock on the door caught both their attentions. Opening the door, they were greeted by a servant boy.
"As a family grows and develops certain family rules are developed. These are individual for the family and are written in the grimoire. It is the responsibility of the eldest in the family to ensure that those rules are not broken and that in time the heir can govern the family according to those rules when the time comes for them to take the mantle. However, as in any society, a family member can be influenced by outsiders and either disregard the family rules and values, or merely not pass said rules and values onto the child. Recard Selwyn, was one such well known person who disregarded his family's rules and guidelines, he chose to ignore the family rules and was eventually cast out of the family and disinherited. This disinheriting did not extend to his four children already born to him. With the death of his brother Recard's son Arman was named heir. He and his siblings however were raised with a certain disregard for the family's rules, and guidelines. Eventually Recard's son Arman became head of house and removed the family rules and values from the Selwyn house, instating new ones, an act that shocked and caused many families to remove themselves from the family's acquaintance. To help ensure it never happened again, that a child was turned from it's house, the King of the time forged a law, ruling that the final guardianship of the children of a family belonged to that family's head of house, and that at any point in time that families head of house could reclaim guardianship of said children with just cause and raise the child as their own. Heirs especially where guarded by this law to defend them as well from enemies they may have from inside the house. The law even crosses between allies and such, it's very convoluted and slightly confusing at times. But one of the things that came from the law was the establishing of a magical guardian for all children without a magical parent, or without a proper head of house as established by the bloodline tests."
"Maintaining a friendship with Lord Evanshade changed our house. Of the three Potter Grimoires only one stands open to you now, the third grimoire because it is the traditional grimoire, the first was locked before even I was Lord Potter, as it holds the old spells that belong to the house, those spells from before our house's dark time. The Second was created by me, because of my friendship with Lord Evanshade, the house of Potter was dragged into their politics. I was forced to learn the politics of that level, the do's the don'ts, and how to use every ounce of power and ability my house had, to protect what was ours. All I learned I wrote within the second grimoire, the secrets, the betrayals, the blackmail, every nugget of power I had. I'm not ashamed to say that I became ruthless, as feared on the battlefield, as I was in court. But it was the cutthroat business of court, and our house flourished in it. That grimoire was forged in a time of battle and strife, when the smallest weakness in a house's armor, could be used against them, my sons, and grandsons added to the grimoire, as did others. Before the night is through I will show you how to open it."
Harry taking a breath looked carefully around the field as he stood having dealt with three more soldiers. An hour ago, the second half of Grindelwald's forces had entered the fray after Marvolo and Dumbledore's argument with Grindelwald had distracted most of the combatants.
“Good morning fine sirs, are you ready to dine for the morning meal, Prince Alomar and several of his guests have gathered on one of the dining Patio’s and have invited you both to dine with them if you are interested.” The boy said.
"The Le-Fay vineyard in France, the remaining shares are now yours, I want that information." Marvolo answered.
Taking a breath Draco continued. "The lower ancestral houses are younger and returned to us old magic thought lost, such as the Dramir line of Russia who returned to us our knowledge of runic works in various forms and sets previously thought lost with only a few key sets remaining that we understood previously. No, they did not give us the language itself, they gave us the way the different sets interact with each other to form the high runic sets. The knowledge they had was nearly complete, they are only missing the Celtic runes of our own Britannian ancestors, the roman runes of ancient Rome, and a few other more esoteric runic languages. The house of Burilgi of the Mongol empire gave us the branch of magic called shadow magics, today that magic is once more lost to time and as that family is now once more gone, the magic is now lost agian."
With that Harry sent a Patronus message to the great hall, asking for Lord Le-Fays presence along with those of his current entourage. Harry and Neville were rather surprised to be greeted by a responding Patronus. "If you wish for a meeting with me you may request one among the official channels, a lowly house such as yours, without even a proper head has no business requesting an audience with the head of an ancestral house. As such do remember your place in the future lest you force me to give your house a firm reminder of their place beneath mine." With that said Marvolo's voice stopped and the Patronus vanished. Harry and Neville both turned as one and marched to the great hall, power visibly crackling between the two.
