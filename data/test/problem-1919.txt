Draco blinked. "Excuse me?"
Harry hadn't glanced his way. Not once. Draco had expected him to explode the moment Dumbledore and the Order were gone. Hell, half the Elves with them had probably expected it. That's what Harry did. Instead, he'd silently turned his horse around and started to head back without so much as a word. Gwynn had shot him a look that he hadn't quite been able to read before following along, leaving Draco to fall into position beside Ilaria. She, at least, didn't look like she was going to try and kill him. If anything, she looked as though the entire meeting had not bothered her in the slightest. Of course, that really didn't mean anything. He had the feeling that if she wanted to kill someone they'd be dead before they even realized that they were in danger.
"No need to bite my head off!"
It had grown even more complicated when he'd read over the papers for the vaults. There had been regular withdrawals from one of the smaller vaults for the past six years. The first one coming from the date he'd started Hogwarts. He'd never been told whether or not he had to pay fees in order to attend Hogwarts but given the frequency and amount of the withdrawal it seemed off. He'd wanted to ask Draco about it, but had refrained. He couldn't bring it up to him just yet. It was too soon.
The command had Harry glancing up. "What? Are we not taking them with us?"
It was not just the wolves, of course, that benefited from the alliance. The wolves acted as an outer defense when it came to unwanted visitors pressing in on the realm. It was a defense that had proven extremely useful in past times and Soren, personally, would be very disappointed to see that go. On top of that, there were many potions of great use that required ingredients taken directly from the race; hair, blood, etc. Freely given items were the only ones used in the creation of these potions and if no alliance existed, access to such items would be impossible.
Draco's heart was racing and he barely heard her words, his eyes still focused on the sword in his hands. He'd never felt anything like that. It had felt powerful and his skin tingled with excitement at the thought that what he'd felt was simply the swords own strength. He had yet to add his own strength to it.
Flushing, Harry narrowed his eyes. "Fine!" he snapped, closing his eyes and rearranging the image he had, altering it so his appearance was closer to Draco's. His hair was longer, hiding the scar on his forehead, and much neater. He'd added some height to his stature and filled out a little more. He was tempted to remove his glasses completely, but he figured it was best to keep them.
After another moment, he nodded, pulling up what little courage he could muster, and said, "Alright. What do I have to do?"
"She?"
"Prettier than you," his voice was rough. Rougher than he expected it to be, which sparked some surprise as he pushed himself up onto his elbows.
Slowly, Severus nodded his head and Draco's attention broke away. Potter was already moving toward the Gryffindor table and he glanced toward his own. Unlike Potter, he wasn't walking into friendly territory. Some friendly faces might remain, but he wasn't naive enough to think that word had not spread of his apparent betrayal. A part of him was particularly glad for the protection at his back. It would certainly make things easier.
"Is Harry okay?" she asked, glancing from Draco to Lothair.
It was the first words to pass from either party and Draco realized the slip a moment after the word had slipped past his lip, the irritation at himself slipping onto his face before he could control it entirely. Bloody hell, he'd clearly been spending far too much time with the Gryffindor to his left. The gits bad habits were starting to rub off on him.
Soren rose as he did, offering a similar nod in return. He could breathe a little easier with the offer accepted. It was not much, in the grand scheme of things, but the bridge between them was on it's way to being mended. A lot would ride on Harry's decision and attitude toward the wolves when the time came to discuss what had happened, but with so much happening they would need to focus on that when it arrived. As dark eyes watched Hendrik's large form leave the room, Soren's thoughts returned to the boys who remained quiet, two floors above him.
In another circumstance, Harry might have been irritated by her despairing attitude toward Wizarding kind. As it was, however, he chose to ignore it, popping a tiny stone from the wall. "He doesn't I guess, but he knows a lot more about it than I did when they found me," Harry explained, realizing that he sounded like a child, jealous of a sibling. However, Lothair's comment still rang in his ears. What if he was right? What if they put their faith in him and he wasn't the right choice? What if he failed where Draco would have exceeded? "They're all up there fawning over the idiot as we speak."
"I don't care," was all she got for her efforts as Harry focused on the path he needed to make it back to the Chamber. They still had some time before dinner, so he was pretty sure Malfoy would be down there. It wasn't exactly like he could go and hang out in the Slytherin common room.
Harry couldn't argue with that. Was that not what the entire Wizarding world was about at the moment? Everyone was caught up in one side of the war. Hell, people flocked behind his name alone and it didn't matter what he did, right or wrong, so long as he stopped Voldemort. The end justified the means. There was one thing that bothered him about her answer. "Draco crossed the border."
"Most of the ritual will be up to me to perform," Rosalind instructed, turning her full attention to Harry and stressing the importance of what she was about to say, "You, however,
"Don't tell Ron I passed him up for his sister?"
"Why is everyone up so early?" he muttered, plopping down into the empty space.
"Well, Vernon will be happy. I'm destined to be a freak forever!"
"I'm sorry, Potter, but the decision has already been made," McGonagall commented, offering him an apologetic smile. Like Harry, she was also a fan of the sport and she understood the disappointment he was feeling. "If you have any suggestions on who to promote as Captain, I'll be more than happy for the input."
"Are you a virgin?"
Narrowing his eyes at the other male, Soren slowly turned back to face his angry mate. "Perhaps we can all sit down and have a proper discussion about what's going to take place?" His tone was hesitant and slightly strained, but he maintained his relaxed posture. There was a perfectly good reason why the blood exchange should take place. If he had the chance to explain in full, perhaps they would also see the benefits to the situation. He did, however, also agree that there were possible negative side affects to rushing the bond, but in this instance, he sincerely believed the good out weighted the bad.
"Alright. Enough sulking," she said, giving him a shove and standing up. "You're coming with me."
Harry nodded, seeing the dismissal in her posture. He didn't like being confused and lately that's all he'd been was confused. Even his own body had betrayed him. He didn't even like Draco and yet he was willing to do almost anything to keep him alive. For the love of Merlin, he was all but excited at the prospect of having Draco around. This time last year he would have laughed at the very idea. With a final glance at the blond, he turned and headed back through the door. He needed some air, at the very least. There was far too much going through his mind at the moment and he needed to clear it out.
After a moment, when Harry realized he was still staring, he accepted the offered hand, allowing Gwynn to help him to his feet. He did have to admit that he was still stinging a bit by the fact that he'd been put knocked on his arse by a girl. Sure, he wasn't used to the training and he was a good deal behind in comparison, but that knowledge didn't do much to sooth his ego. Why he was even bothered was a mystery to him. Hermione beat him in marks all the time and he'd never felt humiliated by that.
Lothair had been standing at the window, watching the departing form of the Alpha with a displeased look on his face. He was not a fan of the wolves, but he tended not to be a fan of most things these days. He could not be certain that they could be trusted or relied on to keep the safety of the realm. Soren was quick to put his trust in them, but the older elf had been wrong in the past. A mistake, at this point, could cost them everything. Pushing away from the window, he turned to find bright green eyes staring at him. Had it not been for quick reflexes he might have been startled into movement. Instead, a simple eyebrow rose as he watched some of the sleep clear from those eyes. "Sleeping Beauty awakes," he scoffed, moving to the end of Harry's bed, his arms crossed over his chest as he waited for the youth to speak.
That was a big thing to place on someone who really didn't have a say in the matter. Who knew if Draco would wake up in time to ask him, nor did they know if he would be able to honestly understand the gravity of the situation. It was human nature to fight in order to survive. Harry, himself, was having a hard enough time looking past the fact that Draco might be dying to fully grasp what Soren and Rosalind were trying to tell him. They acted as though it was a choice, but it really wasn't. If he said no and Draco ended up dying, he'd never be able to move past that. Draco's blood would be forever on his hands, unable to wash off. In the back of his mind he'd always blame himself. On top of that, who was he to decide whether or not Draco lived. Sure, the thought of watching him die made Harry physically ill, but so did taking such a choice away from the Slytherin.
That only irritated him further. A public confrontation with Draco and his lackeys was most certainly not worth it ... and yet, he thought it was completely worth it. His entire body called for the confrontation. It'd bring them closer and then maybe the pressure would let off a bit and he could refocus on what he needed to do.
Harry shot him an annoyed look, but Lothair cut him off before he could snap back.
Lifting his head, he rubbed at his tired eyes before standing. At this rate, he'd die of exhaustion before he managed to accomplish anything. Between Ilaria's new training regiment and his inability to sleep through the night, it was a wonder he was still functioning. Standing, he moved into the bathing room. Eyeing himself in the mirror, he smiled wryly. He had to hand it to the Elves. With the exception of the troubled eyes staring back at him, there was no sign of his exhaustion. He looked just as he always did.
The force of it sent everything around Harry shooting backwards, Draco included. He hit the floor several feet back and rolled. With the initial impact he'd released the hold on his own sword, It landed several feet to Draco's left. Any clatter it might have made was drowned out by the roaring in his ears. Instinct had him rolling into a defensive crouch in case Potter had anything else to throw at him. It took a moment to spot the brunette through the dust still floating in the air.
With Gwynn still trailing behind him, Harry burst through the main doors, sliding slightly as he attempted to come to a stop faster then he was capable of. He was surprised to find one of the stable hands moving toward him, two horses already in hand: two very familiar and large horses. Erebus and Nyx. He briefly pondered if it was a coincidence that these two were the one he'd find first or if whatever was guiding his senses had led him to this particular junction of time.
Harry's eyes moved to meet the Alphas and the two glared darkly at each other, neither one of them wanting to be the one to look away.
The look on his face must have been comical because across from him Blaise started laughing and he could have sworn he'd heard choked laughter coming from behind him.
Ron scowled at her. "Will you stop judging me?"
He had only just started to accept the idea that he was no longer simply a member of the Wizarding community. He was now much more than that. While a part of him was tied to the world of Wizards, there was another part of him that was even now being drawn further into the Elven realm and further from the world he had come to know. "What do you mean?"
The sound of his Mother's voice resonating through his mind only made Draco's stomach churn violently with guilt. She'd instructed him to trust the man in front of him, but even with no other fragment of hope left, Draco found it extremely difficult to follow through on that. What if his Mother was wrong? What if Snape couldn't be trusted either.
Draco merely raised an eyebrow at Harry's continued glowering, but when an argument didn't come, he returned the look with a smug smirk.
Before he could continue on his rant, Soren cut him off. "Furthermore, Harry and Draco will come into their own in due time. Worrying about the speed at which they settle will only make the process seem that much longer."
Lothair snorted, from his position beside Ilaria. "Are you sure we didn't get it wrong the first time?" he asked, raising an eyebrow, "This one seems more like Prince material."
Soren sat for a moment in surprised silence, contemplating exactly how he was going to handle the conversation. There were many things that Harry would have to understand, but the most important of these was that events took place not because one chose them but because they were meant to. There was a strong presence that guided their lives, call it what you will: Mother Nature, Fate, God, or Destiny. To have that concept mocked so openly and with such a level of distaste was not something that Soren had prepared for. He was simply unable to absorb the comments without a bit of both annoyance and frustration seeping into him. "No matter your preference, Harry, your presence here is not a coincidence."
"I just knew this had something to do with Voldemort!" Ron scowled, plopping down into the seat across from her. "They've probably brainwashed him into believing he's some bloody Elf Prince."
"Draco?" she snapped, her own surprised morphing into an instant dislike that had been nurtured for years. "What the bloody hell are you doing here?"
Nodding, he turned his attention back to the two ahead of them. Ilaria had fed her magic into her lance, flame engulfing the length of it as she gracefully twisted it around, coming dangerously close to hitting Lothair's unprotected skin. Lothair, however, had not shown an ounce of his element. As Harry watched, he began to feel the energy in the room. It had been gradually building without them initially noticing.
Draco raised an eyebrow at the very hostile looking finger pointed at him. "Me," he drawled.
The slight shifting of Gabriel's eyes to a spot over Draco's right shoulder and he clearing of a throat had the blond paling slightly. He hadn't felt anyone coming down the connecting corridor moments earlier, but he didn't need to turn around to know who was now standing here.
Tearing his eyes away from he now empty hallway, he glanced back to Gwynn. It took him a moment to realize that she was staring down. Then he felt it, the small throbbing pain coming from his palms. Glancing down, he lifted his hands to find his nails embedded into the palms of his hands. Unfurling his tightly clenched hands, his nails slid free to leave four crescent shaped cuts that immediately pooled blood.
"There was a mortal," he stuttered, his haste to please the murderous Elf in front of him evident in the slight shake of his hands. "A boy. The Prince chanced the river in order to save him. He barely paid any attention to the wolves or what was happening around him. Word in the forest has it that the boy was taken to the castle and the Wolves second in command is there as well, by order of the Prince. The Prince, apparently blames the Alpha's pack for the condition the boy was in when he was found."
"And what of yours?" Lothair asked, his usual smirk back in place.
"Those of us born in the Wizarding World," his tone was haughty and Harry instantly took it as a slight against himself, "were raised with tales of most magical creatures; Elves, Fae, Werewolves, Banshees, all of them. It's a surprisingly a popular interest among Purebloods."
As Lothair turned to leave his eyes fell upon Harry, a hard edge to their gaze before they once again showed nothing of his emotional state. It was quite clear that despite the role Harry had agreed to play, Lothair did not think him capable of handling such responsibilities. Even knowing that Lothair's fears were not completely unfounded, Harry certainly didn't like to be thought of as incompetent. Had Lothair wanted to prevent him from ruling, he was certainly going about it in the wrong manner. Being doubted so obviously only made Harry that much more determined to accomplish what Lothair that was impossible. However, in order to do that he had to be offered a little more information than he was currently being offered.
"I'm giving Draco my blood."
He hadn't even considered the possible state of dress Potter might be in, but thankfully, the Gryffindor had enough sense to sleep in some form of sleep ware ... even if it was just a pair of boxers. Ignoring that, he frowned when the sudden loss of warmth from the blanket didn't wake him. For someone who had at least two people trying to kill him, he slept pretty soundly. Lying in the center of the bed, Potter had wrapped himself around a pillow, his legs drawn up and was still sleeping away peacefully.
Hermione's concerned question had him glancing up in at the question, belatedly realizing he'd been rubbing the spot above his heart again. This was twice she'd caught him doing that today and the look on her face told him he better not say he was fine.
"We couldn't sense anything, Sir," Gwynn responded instantly. "Harry said there was a humming and then he was hit with a spell. This is everyone who was present in the hallway at the time."
After several long moments with nothing changing, he was about to give up when he started to feel the slight rumbling of stone under his feet. He faintly heard the gasps from the others behind him, but he couldn't pull away. The magic had swelled crashing over him and tugging him in further. The further he went, the more connected he felt. He could see images of Hogwarts as it had once been and how it had changed over time. He could feel each layer of magic being added as the years passed. It was amazing and overwhelming.
Harry had a million and one things to say about having to hold a council to punish the ones responsible for Draco's injures, but he held his tone. Soren was right. Draco did need help and that had to come first. He would have his chance to punish the wolves; he simply had to be patient. A hard task, given his current emotional state, but one he was intent on completing.
As he watched the other Elf , his anger spiked as did his magic, and he suddenly found the world shifting. The colour blurred for a moment before he could feel himself looking out through Ehlark's eyes, the glance focused on the shifting muscle in Aranel's jaw as the other Elf clamped it shut. Panicking, he instinctively jerked himself backwards. The action was both mentally and physically, causing his back to slam back abruptly into the back of his chair, interrupting whatever it was that Faelyn had been saying.
To the right of them there was a low whistle and a chuckle. "Now it's a fight."
singular. Contrary to popular belief, this situation is not about yourself. It is about the survival of an entire Kingdom. This series of events was put into place generations before you entered into this world and it will continue long after you have left it."
Another carefully worded bard.
This time, Harry's words seemed to peak the other Elf's interest. "How so?"
A small tired sigh of relief slipped from Rosalind's lips as the blond's wounds began to heal, first with any lingering internal injuries before proceeding to the others. As the magic approached the wounds inflicted by the wolves, Rosalind watched as the skin around the edges began to repair itself. For a moment, it looked as though the wounds would heal just as the other had, but only for a moment. As the new, repaired skin moved forward to close the wound, the boys body began to jerk in retaliation, their combined relaxed state instantly began to fade. Stepping forward, Rosalind focused her magic toward healing the wounds, calling Ilaria to join her element of water with Rosalind's. The other two would continue to stabilize Harry.
"He paid us a little visit," Lothair added, moving away from where he had been leaning against the wall. His tone was dark and the loathing could be heard in every syllable. "And he knew damn well that it was not you who rode with us."
Across from him, Ron seemed equally upset. The news hadn't been announced to the rest of the team yet so they couldn't exactly talk about it ... or rather, Ron couldn't complain publicly about it. Harry had given them some excuse about wanting to keep him protected because the order thought Voldemort would be stepping up his movements now that Harry was back. It was a load of crap, but they both seemed to buy it.
"As amusing as the current conversation is, we are needed in the Southern wing. I'm afraid your little get together is going to have to wait."
There were times when Severus Snape deeply regretted the choices he'd made in his life. He regretted having lost his friendship with Lily Evans. He regretted not having been strong enough to refuse the Dark Lord. Lately, however, his regrets had started to shift. He didn't regret any of the good he'd done because of his choices, but he he was starting to regret falling under the control of Albus Dumbledore. There really was little difference between Dumbledore and the Dark Lord. Both expected him to perform on command. Voldemort, at least, didn't bother trying to hide his intentions behind soft words of encouragement and hope. With the Dark Lord what you saw was what you got. Albus Dumbledore had more faces than any one person could keep track of. It was enough to drive a sane man around the bend. Thankfully, Severus had never really fit the roll of a sane man.
Once all the curtains were drawn, he turned back to the bed. It was situated between the two large windows he'd just opened and in the very center of it there was a lump beneath the blankets. Draco stood for a moment glowering at it. There was no sign of Potter save for that lump. There was no hair sticking out from beneath the blanket, no arm, no foot. Potter had legitimately burrowed himself under the blankets. Rolling his eyes, Draco stepped forward and jerked the blanket off his favourite Gryffindor. Of course, with the likes of Weasley, Granger, and Longbottom inhabiting the house, being his favourite wasn't exactly a compliment.
"Precisely. Now what are we?"
| Hey guys! I'm back! Sorry, it took so long to get this chapter out. I moved and work and COVID stuff. Real-life has no concept of my writing schedule. As for the editing of previous chapters, despite promising that I would, I haven't even looked at it yet. Instead of making more promises, I'll just let you know when I update them. Until then, enjoy the new stuff that is coming out.
"Your incompetence continues to astound me, Potter."
Harry frowned. He had no idea how to even begin something like that and, if he was honest, all he could imagine was Hogwarts crashing down around them if he tried. "I'm new to this whole Elf magic thing, remember?" he commented, dryly. "I don't think restructuring Hogwarts is within my abilities."
Steeling himself, he fixed a bored expression onto his face and headed toward the table and the rest of his housemates. As he got closer, his eyes moved over each of them. Pansy was waving him over and Zabini had a calculating look on his face as he watched Draco approach, neither of which was giving him a dangerous vibe. Zabini, he knew, was deciding whether or not he'd be a good investment. The man was intelligent, which was part of the reason Draco liked him. There was an opportunity there. Pansy, on the other hand, more than a little annoying but easy enough to sway. Crabbe and Goyle ... well, they just looked confused, glancing between themselves and Draco. He didn't have much concern there. They'd follow him. They didn't know any other way. Nott, Davies, and Greengrasss, however, were another story. Nott and Greengrass were watching him with narrowed eyes. Their families were right in there with his own when it came to Voldemort's inner circle and he had no doubt that they knew what had happened. Davies ... well, she was an enigma. She hadn't even glanced up to look at him and, frankly, he had no idea where she stood when it came to either side. The older crowd, however, was looking at him with more than enough hostility to know that he would do well to keep a particularly close eye on them.
"B-but, My Lord, this is Lady Ilaria's horse," the poor Elf responded, shifting a very nervous glance between Harry and Gwynn. "Nyx is not to be ridden by any other individual."
"Leave it to the pesky Wizards to twist everything around to suit their own purposes."
Harry peeked out from beneath his arm, his eyes narrowed. "He called me an idiot?"
"Are you trying to say that one of us let the brat through?" Lothair snapped, looking as disgusted by the prospect as he sounded. "You really have lost your mind."
"And how do you plan to locate the Elven realm? Similar to the Fair Folk, their realm is not exactly located on the same plane of existence as ours."
The magic continued to crash over him, making his own magic pulse in response until he couldn't tell whether he was in control of it or Hogwarts was and then as suddenly as it had started, it released him and he stumbled back. There were faint traces of magic in the air, but they brushed against him as though saying good-bye and then disappeared completely.
"And the potion?"
"Please, go away."
"Of course, not, Lothair," Soren sighed, growing rather tired with the younger Elf's continued tantrums. He might have the long life of the Elves, but he was certainly getting too old to deal with a bunch of children. "I'm not saying anything of the sort. Though none of us actively assisted him, the mortal still managed to enter into the realm. There is only Harry and yourself, Lothair, who have not bonded. As I doubt that you are interested in the mortal, I'm going to assume that Harry's connection to this mortal was what saved him from being destroyed by the wards. There is already a bond between the Dark Prince and his mortal. Harry assumes it is a rivalry, but that alone would not have saved him. It is something much more than a petty childhood rivalry. There is no other explanation."
He took a step toward Lothair until they were standing nose to nose. "He is
The wolves muscles tenses as though he was going to spring forward, causing Harry to brace himself for the expected attack, but before anything could happen between the two of them, Soren interfered. "This is not the time or the place for politics," his voice, soothing and calm, washed over all of them. "We will return to the Manor to discuss the changes of the law. We are wasting time as we argue."
" he hissed, stepping back as the sink started to shake and shift.
Harry turned to argue but stopped, gapping in surprise. The entire space had changed. The corridor of snakeheads was gone, replaced with proper walls and proper lights. The open cavern had changed as well. It looked like they were in any other part of the castle. At the center of where the cavern had been was an open space that could quite easily be used for training and another for a common area. Along the walls were a series of doors that led to what Harry could only guess at. It reminded him of the dungeons, though the lighting brightened it up more than Harry would have expected.
Even before the rustle of fabric could alert him, Roland had known the exact moment when he was no longer alone. The sound of blood pumping through thick veins and the smell of sweat and fear lingered heavily in the air around him, causing within him a certain desire to still that beating heart. Just beneath the scent of the Elf, there was something altogether less satisfying, lingering in the strong threads of the travelling cloak haphazardly slung over broad shoulders. Lichen: a never-ending nuisance.
A brief nod the only acknowledgement Albus received as Severus limped awkwardly in through the door, closing it firmly behind him. Corridors empty or not, he'd learned to take precaution.
"And how, exactly, is that going to work?"
Instead of the slimy tube that they had slipped down the day before, there was now a perfectly functioning stone staircase leading upward toward an ornate door. It seemed Hogwarts had been partial to the snake pattern since it was now carved into the door, eyes staring back at him and tail wrapping around where the door handle rested. Upon opening the door, Draco found himself in a disused corridor in the dungeons.
"May I come in?"
Lothair scoffed at that, but held his tongue.
"I'm sorry. I – I didn't mean-"
His amusement didn't diminish as he listened to Draco cursing as he reached the bottom, followed by a much more silent Lothair. The accompanying sounds of the rest of the guard following him before the scraping of stones above indicated that the entrance was closing up after them, another benefit. A moment later, the rest of the guard appeared and he nearly laughed at the disgusted look on Gwynn's face as she brushed off a clump of muck off her cloak.
"You can enter the Realm through any point in the mortal world if you know how to manipulate the magic that keeps us separated. By opening the barrier, we can come out within a relatively close distance of our destination. Because the school has a heavy barrier or her own magic, we won't be able to get as close as we normally would have, but it will be close enough."
"Then what is?"
"I'm rather disappointed in you, Draco," Lucius responded, idly playing with the tip of the dagger he held in his hands, several masked individuals lined behind him. "All this time I've been allowing your transgressions. A filthy Mudblood outscores you. Potter out flies you. A bloody Weasley outsmarts you. All of this, I've not punished you severely for simply because you would ultimately be taking our Lord's mark and serve him as only a Malfoy could."
"First, you will assign someone from your pack to remain here in the Manor," he held up a hand when the Alpha immediately went to argue, "It doesn't have to be your second. Honestly, I don't care who it is so long as they are able to assist Draco incorporate any characteristics that might manifest. Consider them to be a liaison between us. They will have the full protection of the realm."
Harry frowned slightly at that, but didn't comment. Perhaps Draco would have more in common with this society than Harry, himself, would. Purity seemed to be a big deal. "Hey Gwynn," he hedged, "can I ask you something?"
"It's none of your damn business, is it?"
It wasn't Lothair that had him on edge.
"He will return."
Draco only smirked, his eyes still on the sword. "How do we imbue it with our own magic?" His thoughts were already turning. He wanted to wield the sword as it was meant to be wielded. He could feel it vibrating through the steel, the desire to be swung.
"A very old curse," Lothair grunted, moving to place a stasis spell over Harry.
Reaching the table, he sank down into the spot that Pansy had cleared for him.
Glancing away from the wreckage, Harry blinked up at a furious Snape, goo dripping off him. He was pretty sure there were blue specks in the man's greasy hair and he just groaned, glancing back at the mess in front of him. "Thank you, sir."
The frown that marred Harry's features was not the result of confusion in regards to Elven classification but, rather, the result of a question that landed a little closer to him. "Why me? Out of everyone what was I chosen?"
With his heart in his throat, Harry watched the graceful arch of Gwynn's arrow as it was released from her bow, never wavering under the pressure of the wind as it flew. As it hit it's target, the relieved sigh Harry was about to release caught in his throat as a familiar face was revealed before the movements of the creature threw the victim towards the river. How Draco Malfoy, of all people, ended up crossing into Elven territory, Harry didn't know. He did know, however, that the panic in his chest all but tripled as he watched the blonde slip beneath the water. He'd been through a lot in his short life and he'd seen horrible things, but never had he felt such blind terror as he did when he lost sight of his rival.
Half a day. Twelve hours. That's how long they'd been riding for. Twelve long, bloody hours. They'd stopped briefly several hours ago to water and rest the horse, but the creatures seemed content to continue on. Harry, himself, was not sharing the sentiment. Every jolt and bump had sent a dull ache through him until that's all he could focus on. By the time they reached the edge of the realm and Lothair had ordered them to dismount, Harry practically cried with relief. Sliding out of the saddle, his knees nearly buckled when his feet found the ground.
It was at least a relief to know that they did not simply assume that Potter was useful. They at least had the sense to wait and see if he could actually measure up to the standards they needed; something that Draco was still unconvinced off. Potter was not a symbol of hope. He was bloody chaos in everything from his hair to his personality. These thoughts, however, were waylaid as she drew his attention back to the memories of the Werewolves. He'd been terrified when he'd seen the markings, instantly thinking that he'd been affected with lycanthropy and forever doomed to that lifestyle only to find his resolve shaken again when he'd looked closer. He could remember the scars on Greyback's victims. He'd seen them as they'd turned, locked away in the depths of the Dungeons buried beneath Malfoy Manor. These were not the same marking. Those had been bloody and ugly,the skin torn and jagged as it had attempted to mend. These were smooth, barely there.
"Lots of people know their way around here."
Harry glanced incredulously to Lothair who just raised an eyebrow. In truth, nothing the blonde had said had been a lie. They were supposed to be keeping a low profile. When he didn't get any help from the older elf, Harry turned back to Draco with a dark look. Sometimes he really just wanted to hate him.
"And why is that?"
Harry blinked for a moment, surprised by the blunt response. After a moment he chuckled, and rubbed the back of his head. "Yeah, I suppose I am," he smiled. Her honest and point blank attitude put him at ease. "Still, I appreciate what you're doing and apologize for the danger it's going to put you in." His smile faded slightly then, his tone more serious. "Once we get to Hogwarts, things will move quickly."
With barely a glance, Harry had immediately started in on one of the practice dummies. As she watched, her eyebrows rose higher and higher as the minutes rolled by. Piece by piece the dummy fell away as Harry went through each offensive move he'd learned since arriving, continuing until there was nothing but the support pole left to hack away at.
No one around the table quite knew how to take that.
Harry chuckled. She wasn't entirely wrong, but he was pretty sure it was only because he usually braided his own hair and he certainly didn't have the skill for it that Rosalind had or even Gwynn had. Hers never slipped from from its hold. Short of asking one of them to do it for him every day, there wasn't much else to do but hope he'd some day get better at it. By the look on Gwynn's face, however, he figured that day was far in the future.
"Here I was thinking it was you who created that duty for him," Draco drawled, the perfect replica of his usual disdain.
"Ice."
"Rules have never stopped you before!" The challenge in Ron's voice was particularly clear: misguided, but clear.
Harry shot her a grateful look and nodded his head. "With the whole inheritance thing," he shrugged, "Dumbledore thought it was prudent to take extra precaution." Of course, Dumbledore had nothing to do with the change, but he doubted Ron was going to go strolling up to Dumbledore and demand explanations. "Besides, it's not like we're not in the same classes."
Harry frowned. This felt like a bad idea. Even if he somehow managed to do what they needed to be done, Dumbledore was sure to know about it and he was hesitant to let the man know their full capabilities. Lothair had already demonstrated that they could bypass his magic, which was telling enough. It was best for all of them if they kept the truth of their abilities to themselves.
"Snape, bring him back!"
"Alright, Harry," Rosalind's voice drew him from his musings, his green eyes moving to hers as she continued, "I need you to roll up your sleeve and lie back. I'm going to push the beds closer together so the distance the blood has to travel is minimal. It will speed up the process and your closeness to Draco will aid in guiding the magic."
Lothair nodded, signalling that he'd heard him. "The wards seem entirely secure in this place," he commented, arms crossed, "but that is not to be said about the rest of this castle. Gwynn, you will accompany Harry everywhere. Akkar, you're with Draco. I want eyes on them at all times. The rest of you will control the wider perimeter. Neutralize anything in the castle or on the grounds that might pose a threat to any of us. We'll run the guard in shifts, as per usual. Understood?"
They'd made the trip in silence, the sound of their feet echoing off the walls their only companion. Reaching the all too familiar statue, Lothair muttered the password and the eagle turned, revealing the staircase. It took only moments to reach the top and Harry took a deep breath and schooled his features before opening the door.
Lothair's look spoke volumes on how pointless he thought this topic of conversation was, but Soren responded before the prickly elf could go off on another rant. "The bond is trying to settle, but circumstances have complicated the situation. Too much has happened too fast, including the initiating of the bond itself. The bond is trying to connect the two of them but Harry is not mentally prepared for it and Draco was neither mentally or physically prepared for it. Draco, for his part, seems to be holding onto his past tightly, which given all that has happened in such a short period of time isn't much of a surprise. I'd wager he feels that he will lose himself if he lets go of that. Harry, on the other hand, can't seem to make up his mind. The bond is telling him that he wants the closeness this would give him, but he's afraid to take it and retreats to safer, more familiar territory."
"No. He needs to come to the realization on his own," Soren agreed, running a tired hand over his face as he thought it through. "If we tell him before he's ready he'll pull back. The bond will suffer and his resolve to see his responsibilities through will break beneath the weight of his stress and fear. His perceived responsibilities to the Wizarding world already weight heavily on him. Another aspect we will have to tackle."
There were distinct warning bells resounding throughout his skull, but Harry was far too lost in the pain and anger he'd allow to swell within him. He simply couldn't stop the angry words that slipped through his lips. Growing up with the Dursleys and never knowing what it was like to be loved had left him wishing desperately for place where he belonged. When Hagrid had arrived and revealed an entire world that he could be apart of, Harry had thought his wish had been granted. Of course, that particular gift had come with an extremely sharp set of teeth that continued to rip away pieces of him. Everyone seemed to place him on a pedestal. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't possibly fit in. Now once again he'd been transplanted, only this time he had found himself stuck between two worlds. He knew nothing of the Elven realm that he was suppose to reside over and he no longer fit within the Wizarding world. He was more alone now than he had ever been before and was now being told that this was his predestined place in life. It was a jagged pill to swallow.
His snotty insistence that he could take care of himself had been greeted with full blown laughter. Apparently, it wasn't every day that the Commander of the realm's army laughed so loudly. Every single Elf within earshot had heard her and come to see what was going on. As a reward for their curiosity, they were able to witness her completely thrash him in hand to hand. Those who stuck around even longer got to watch him practice with a sword heavier than his Mother's grand piano until his hands began to bleed.
"Of course, but those are for those who haven't shown a preference for a weapon or in the case of a war and a need for quick armament. Since you're the most terrible shot I've ever witnessed, it would be a waste of money to have a bow made for you."
It would have been wise not to answer, one might suppose, but in this case it didn't really matter. The unlucky messenger faced the entire ire of the Elf alone and cowered beneath his own fear and the dark look in his Lord's eye. It did not bode well for his survival. "He wasn't alone. The High Lords arrived only minutes after he did, with the full extent of the royal guard. Lothair, particularly, looked enraged by the whole of it. It's not unwise to choose your battles and that was one we would not have won."
Harry raised a surprised eyebrow. "What?"
"I understand your frustrations, Hendrik, but you will have to bear with us a little longer. The Prince and his Consort," the mention of a consort brought with it a flash of surprise to the man's eye. It was a reaction, Soren had been hoping to use to their advantage, "have not yet woken from their respective sleeps. Due to the young man's injuries the change had to be accelerated. It takes some time to regain strength after such an ordeal." Any further information on the matter, would not be shared and it seemed that the Alpha realized that as he reined in his irritation and sat back.
It was a simple statement of fact, but it made Harry bristle slightly. "I'm not afraid!" he responded, immediately. The moment the words left his mouth, Harry knew it was a lie. He was terrified of what was going to happen. He was afraid of the repercussions. No one could assure him that everything would work out for the best, though they tried to do just that through their smiles or quiet comments. They were all just as worried about this as Harry, himself, was. All except Soren. He was the one pillar of assurance standing within the storm of Harry's raging emotions and doubt.
"You stay out of this!"

As his feet hit the ground, Harry had never been happier to feel the reassuring weight of his sword at his side. He was too late to prevent Draco falling into the river, but even with the fast current Draco couldn't have been carried out of reach. Pulling his sword from its sheath, Harry ran directly at the three wolves, having ignored the approaching Elves and who were still clawing and growling at each other. Just as two arrows shot over his head, impacting against the side of one Wolf, Harry's sword met the side of the creature closest to him. The remaining werewolf, while still growling and spitting, was covered in gashes that bleed freely. The creature wouldn't be much of a match for Gwynn and Harry didn't feel too bad about leaving it there for her. As his sword remained embedded in the side of the wolf he'd stabbed, Harry shot forward once again, running along the riverside until he could spot Draco's form in the water.
"All we can do now is wait. We won't know the full extent until both boys have awoken."
"You're stupid arse did not look like that!"
Harry shook his head. "It's not that bad," he muttered, lifting a hand to pat down his head, even if he knew his hair didn't actually look the way she was seeing it.
"I seriously hope you know what you're doing," Snape muttered only when they were out of Dumbledore's earshot. He didn't think they could move far enough to be out of the ear shot of the Elves, something he understood Draco knew.
"Guests?" Harry asked, having forgotten about the Werewolves in the face of his own misery.
"Nightly blessings, Lady Ilaria."
The group continued to move forward, silence stretching out to embrace them all. No one, not even Harry, was inclined to break it. It had been a long time since a meeting of this making had been arranged. The elves had taken the initiative to pull back from the human world and all those in the group understood the significance of making contact with them now. Had it not been for Harry's connection to them, this meeting wouldn't have taken place.
His willingness to continue was testament to his determination and Rosalind couldn't prevent the fond smile from forming on her pale features. He was a good boy, this Harry Potter. He would be a good match for the Kingdom in time. "Up on the bed, please," she responded, nodding toward the bed in which Draco lay. It had been expanded enough to fit a second body, but Harry wasn't entirely sure it had been expanded at all. The spot left open for him looked particularly tiny. "Up you get and roll up your sleeve, please. I'll need your wrist clear."
"Well, you are certainly not a complete loss," she finally responded, her gaze moving back to his. Despite what could have been perceived as harshness, there was a certain tenderness in her eyes and smile that cushioned her comments. "He's a bit spindly, but I'm sure I can whip him into shape in no time at all. He has excellent balance, I'll give him that much."
"And Draco is aware of what you're doing?"
Harry might not have believed her words, but Gwynn stood by them. They were the truth. It didn't matter how irritating this Malfoy was or how much he didn't want to be a member of this realm. He was there now and he would have to fall into line like the rest of them. That was all there was to it. "Come on," she urged, hopping down from her own position on the wall, "I'm starving. Let's go to the kitchens before all the good stuff gets put away for the night." Despite living outside of the Manor, Gwynn was quickly becoming accustomed to meal times and the access Harry had to the kitchen. Food here was just so much better than the stuff her Mother dared to cook.
He glanced up at the familiar voice. Gwynn. "Every inch of my body hurts."
"Magical core," Ilaria responded, nodding her head. "Excellent. Daemeon has outdone himself."
Moving further into the room, Harry met the eyes of each Council member, offering them each a nod in greeting before taking his own seat. Lothair, Soren, Ilaria, and Draco were already seated, which left Gwynn to take up the position behind him. She had originally attempted to remain in the hall, but Harry had refused to allow it. If nothing else, she was a calming presence that he was going to use in order to get through this meeting. She was a calming presence that he had no intention of doing without from the remainder of his time here. As she took up position, Ilaria raised a delicate eyebrow and glanced in his direction. It wasn't surprising that she had picked up on the significance of her position, she was the one who assigned members to the guard; the only ones who stood in that position. Offering her a subtle nod of his head, he answered her question. He was sure they'd have a discussion about it later. He wasn't naive to think he hadn't stomped over a wide variety of regulations in this bout of selfishness.
As three more creatures erupted from trees, the one standing in front of him quickly became the very least of his concerns. These three made his current attacker look like a lapdog. They were twice as large, the one in the middle towering over the others, their coats dirty and matted, their eyes pinning both Draco and the other Werewolf with a look that clearly stated they both now on the lunch menu. Draco couldn't even be grateful that his original attacker was now too occupied with the others to bother with him. If it didn't kill him, Draco was sure one of the others would.
Glancing to Ron, the redhead just offered him a shrug.
"You'll be fine," he commented, waving off Harry's concern. "Focus on what you want to accomplish and reach out slowly."
Gwynn eyed him suspiciously for several long moments, before she finally nodded and let the topic slip by. "Well, if you're alright then let's start on our archery. The Mother knows you need it and we have plenty of good light left before dinner."
Unbothered by the darker atmosphere, Harry moved along with ease until he came upon the group in question. "Malfoy!"
"Do you notice that every time you infuriate him, he hates me all the more. I haven't even done anything!"
"Yeah, well, maybe if you'd-"
Draco snorted. Snape and Lucius had never been the best of friends. Having them in the same room had always been a struggle ... except when his Mother had been present. The tension had always been less when she was there.
"Of course, you did. You just happened to make all these shots when there just happened to be no one around to witness it."
Spotting them, Lothair reigned in the others. "Let's move. We have half a days ride before we reach the western border," he barked, urging his own horse forward to lead the way out of the yard and leaving Harry to catch up to him. He supposed he was supposed to stay in the ridiculous formation they'd been instructed on earlier, but he brushed that aside.
For a brief moment, Harry had an image of the Hogwarts Greenhouses flash through his mind. He could almost smell the fresh soil, see Neville's pleased smile as Madam Sprout praised him, see Ron poking their newest assignment with the end of his wand while Hermione scolded him. With it came a certain sense of loneliness. He missed Hogwarts. He missed his friends. Then, as quickly as it had come, the feeling disappeared and a warm hand rested on his arm. Opening his eyes, unaware when he'd even closed them, he found Rosalind standing beside him with a questioning look in her eyes. She didn't need to vocalize the question for Harry already knew what she was asking. "I'm ready."
Harry was much too annoyed to be overly concerned with his abrupt departure from McGonagall's office. Annoyed wasn't a strong enough word for what he was currently feeling. Rage, perhaps? Very intense dislike that wasn't quite hate? He wanted to go with hate, but the ever-present weight on his chest was a clear indication that he didn't hate the giant blonde git.
"Draco?"
McGonagall gave him a disgruntled look. "I know your position on the team, Potter," she sighed, taking a seat behind her desk. "And frankly, I don't particularly want to remove you from the team. I rather enjoy winning."
"What do you need me for when you seem to have everything taken care of with your little tramp?" A part of him felt a surge of surprise as those words fell from his lips. He spoke as though he was jealous, but that wasn't the truth of it. He couldn't be jealous of something he didn't want. Anything of the sort would only have been a result of the bond, he assured himself, his anger burning brighter at that thought. It flowed beneath his skin like an icy current, chilling him to the core.
"If you keep scowling like that, your face will stick like that."
Albus just smiled as though he didn't notice Draco's attitude.
"I don't know! Maybe he wants him to spy on us?"
Harry glared at her, a hand rubbing the back of his head. For being a girl she certainly had an arm on her. That had bloody well hurt. "Of course, I do. Rosalind said it would bind us together. Connected. Forever. I get it."
A darker sense of loneliness settled over him, his thoughts shifting to the blond he'd left unconscious in the medical wing. Draco had somehow managed to get through the wards when no one else had been able to. He'd been injured and weak and yet, somehow, he'd gotten through. Harry had known the moment the wards had been breached. He'd instinctively known that the Slytherin had been hurt; that he'd
"What's wrong with your chest?"
It wasn't the first time he'd experienced it. He'd been having them every night since he'd arrived in the realm. He didn't know whether it was a side affect of what had happened to him physically or if it was just another consequence of his mental state. Frankly, he wouldn't be at all surprised if his sanity was slowly slipping away from him. Most of his life would make sense if that was the case.
A flicker of amusement and Draco was back to being serious. There was more meaning there than just the voicing of a well documented dislike. "I'll do my best."
"Ow! What the hell?"
"Shave your head and start muttering to yourself and it'll be the foolproof."
"How can he possibly know more about this place? He's just a wizard."
Lothair was just about to retort when there was a rather fortuitous knock on the door. After a moment, Rosalind entered the room, "I apologize for interrupting, but I've finished analyzing Mr. Malfoy's wounds and I think you should be aware of my findings before a decision is made."
Harry's eyes shot back to the blond at that statement. He'd always been so proud of being a Malfoy that it was surreal to hear him talk of his home with such disdain, even knowing a small portion of what had occurred over the summer. "I don't think that's-"
"What of Voldemort?" he asked, the quiet question interrupting the brewing argument. He watched as Dumbledore's eyes slid from Lothair to him, that sparkle returning and Harry had a feeling he used that as a means to hide whatever really lied behind them.
Harry's eyes shot to the side to narrow on Soren. He might have been willing to listen to Soren's earlier advice but he wouldn't go so far as to say that the whole thing was a misunderstanding. "I'm sure there is no misunderstanding as to what happened," he responded, his tone holding a cold, steely undercurrent.
"It was calculated." Harry added, glancing down at his sword, "With Ilaria's element it would have been easy to let the magic linger over a long period of time, letting the fire slowly burn as it wanted to. You can't do that. Lightening is a sudden release of energy. The only way you could use it to your advantage was to release a large amount of power all at once and overpower the diluted stream of magic."
When Severus stepped back Draco noticed that only one vial was left in his hand and, by the few drops remaining in the bottom, he guessed it had contained the blood-replenishing potion. Whatever the second potion was, Draco was sure that Severus had already destroyed the vial and any evidence of it having existed. It hadn't affected any of his physical wounds, dulled the pain, or even caused more, which left him to assume that it hadn't been one approved by his Father. As Severus stepped back into line with the other three guarding the entrance, Draco slumped slightly. Whatever the potion was it hadn't done a thing to help him. He was bleeding just as profusely as he'd been before and his wrists were no closer to being released from the tight grip of the manacles, the skin beneath the metal torn and bleeding.
"It is true that Lady Alethea entered into this world at that time and there has been many descendants between the two of you, but you have to keep in mind that we are not discussing your human ancestors," Soren responded, taking a moment to explain the connection. Lothair would be covering the finer points of Elven ancestry over the course of the next few weeks, but for the moment a brief lesson was needed. "In our world it is only the Elven ancestry that is calculated. Lily and James will always be your parents but once your body accepted your Elven heritage it connected you to your Elvin ancestors."
"Hear what?" Draco asked, glancing down the hallway. He couldn't hear or see anything.
The sound of fabric rustling and the uneven sound of a single set of footsteps echoed through the dark and otherwise silent hallways of Hogwarts castle. With the students home for the summer months there was no fear of others noticing his presence. He and the house elves would be the only individual roaming the halls. Of that, he was quite positive. Even the ridiculous caretaker would be tucked away in one of the many rooms within the castle.
Draco frowned, the anger he'd been holding onto rolling around inside of him. He was positive that if his mother were dead, his father would have made a scene of it. Lucius Malfoy, if nothing else, was a showman. He wanted people to look even if his actions made him seem like a madman. Since Voldemort's return, that narcissistic side of his had only strengthened. That being said, if he wanted an audience than the most likely place for her to be was the Manor. That's where the foot traffic was. There were other properties, of course, but none had as much Death Eater presence as the main estate.
"The swordsmith," she grinned, turning on her heel and heading for the door as thought that was all the answer he really needed.
"Harry, you just can't-" Harry barely spared Gwynn a glance once she'd caught up, her breathing slightly erratic and her hair slipping from where she'd tied it back that morning. He had far more important things to worry about and he was sure her reprimands would be repeated later. Several different individuals would probably be repeating them, in fact.
"I never said I wasn't concerned!"
Gabriel nodded at his instructions, his bouncing between the doors in his line of sight. After a moment, he turned his attention back to Draco and smiled brightly, catching the blond off guard. "When I first met my mate, she kicked my ass too," was all he said before he sauntered off down the hallway, leaving Draco to stare after him. The comment his to make of it what he would.
I will 100% admit that Harry's being a brat. Lol. He has a tendency to do that from time to time. Though, in his defense, I will say that his emotions are being influenced by a bond that neither he or Draco really understand at the moment. Since it wasn't activated the normal way, the two aren't completely synced just yet and it's causing a wee bit of chaos. Hang in there for a little longer.
"We've picked up some movement all along the borders. The initial presence started in the Northwest and has been steadily moving in both directions. We've already sent envoys to the neighboring lands, but the Vampire Coven and the Lichen have claimed that it is not their forces. The Fair Folk have yet to send word. We do, however, have reports of the Lichen congregating on the west side of our lands, but there's simply not enough of them to have been the cause of the ward disturbance."
Even as the wolf closed in on him, Draco could see the movement in the trees ahead of him. He was almost to the river. He was so close. Just a little further. As Draco moved around a large tree blocking the river from view, his foot caught in the tangled mess of its roots. Given the momentum of his body and the firm ancient strength of the tree's root, Draco hit the forest floor with a sickening crush, his arm twisted painfully beneath him. His vision swam as he fought to get his breath back and keep the pathetically limited contents of his stomach from being forced up. The pain was blinding as it mixed with the sheer panic of having the werewolf closing in on him. With nothing but desperation driving him forward, Draco forced himself up, his arm cradled against his chest as he stumbled toward the water.
"Severus."
The comment surprised a snort of amusement from him, releasing one of the many knots in his soul and lightening his mood even if just a little. "That's a fair point."
Motioning Harry to follow him, Soren guided him toward the far end of the wing and away from the mortal who seemed to attract Harry's attention with relative ease. Once they were out of earshot, Soren turned back to study Harry intently. "You're afraid."
"Don't you 'yo' me!" the woman turned, pointing her finger at Harry in a manner that was far more threatening than Draco thought it out to be. "First you bring this ruffian-" she took a second to jerk her thumb in Gwen's pouting direction, "-into my kitchen, always putting me behind in my work to beg for more food and now you're just wandering in with another stray!" She shot a pointed look at Draco, daring him to ask her to make him something. "Without even so much as a good morning, Sheedra."
After another long moment, Harry's eyes cleared of hostility and filled with a deep worry. "He's not breathing," Harry whispered, his eyes wide with worry and confusion. He didn't know why his chest felt like it was going to collapse at the thought of Draco dying. He didn't know why, just a moment ago, he felt threatened to have Soren anywhere near the blond. "Please …"
The silence in the room spoke volumes as Harry tore his eyes away from Draco and moved to take the only available seat. He sat rigidly, very aware of Draco's presence and the stares he was receiving thanks to his injuries. He wished he'd listened to Soren and had Rosalind heal him.
"See," Lothair commented, "Not that difficult."
Soren felt a sense of pride swell in his chest. He barely knew the boy in front of him, but he was quite impressed with the sense of curiosity and determination that seemed to swell within the new Prince. "In a sense, the Wizarding worlds irrevocable desire to categorize every thing and everyone has led them to overlook important aspects of the world around them. Muggles are not devoid of magic. The difference between them and their Wizarding counterparts is the level of inherent magic in the blood. To an extent, the Pureblood circles of your previous world have been following through on a logical thought process," at this point, Soren could read the disagreement that had immediately sprung up in Harry's eyes. Silencing him with a small motion of his hand, the older Elf continued his explanation. "Like many other talents, the levels of inherent magic are dispersed through the population. For some, like those who are classified as Muggles, the levels are too low to be able to accomplish any spell casting, but that does not mean that magic does not manifest itself within them. It simply does so on a much smaller scale. For instance, premonitions are caused not by a supernatural force, but rather by the latent magic levels within that particular individual. Pureblood families turn to others of the same magical levels in order to persevere themselves. However, this is not the only way to preserve magic. The levels within us are not something we have a strong sense of control over. There are many individuals who possess a large magical centre, despite the fact that they are the descendants of Muggles."
Even with two days to argue their points, Harry still wasn't comfortable with Draco tagging along. There were too many variables, which had caused the weight on his chest to double. He was restless and his mood suffered for it. Even Erebus shifted beneath him in response to the trapped energy rippling beneath the strong glamour he was currently wearing. Gone were the elven clothes and features. He'd been returned to how he'd appeared the last time he'd visited Hogwarts. Draco too, wore the form Harry had remembered seeing that last train ride back from Hogwarts, sneer included.
Draco just shrugged and turned his attention back to his own sword. "His hair always looks like he just got spit out of a tornado."
"And why would a property in the Wizarding world be of any use?" he asked, arms crossed over his chest and looking no closer to being on board with this than he had when Harry had first started talking.
"Did I ever say he was to be a prisoner?" He asked, adopting a bored and somewhat arrogant tone he'd heard one too many times from a certain blond sitting at the table. While the others might not have known where it had come from, the stiffening of Draco's spine told Harry that he hadn't missed the similarities. Harry didn't dare to glance his way and see if said blond had taken offence to it. The safest place for his eyes to be was anywhere Draco wasn't. "I offered the protection of the realm in exchange for his assistance. Doesn't seem like shackles, does it?"
"What's up with Potter, anyway?" Pansy interrupted, glancing across the hall. "He looks different. Not so ... pauper-ish."
"We're going to need their approval," was all he said in regards to the question in Lothair's eyes. Things were changing and all Soren could do was hope that he'd be able to keep up with it.
He should feel guilty for the breach and he did, he supposed, a little. Not nearly as much as he should have, however. It was almost distant, like he could barely feel the emotion. In its place was this swirl of energy within him. Perhaps, magic wasn't the right word. His magic had never felt like this before, even when he'd lost control. It was cool and calming. It dulled the edges of his emotions. It dulled the sharpness of the pain in his chest.
The comment earned her an irritated roll of his eyes as he sheathed his sword once again and ran a hand through his slightly damp hair. He'd need to shower again, but he was in no hurry to go back into the Manor; to a particular snotty Slytherin. Kicking a stray piece of the practice dummy, Harry moved to lean against the low stone wall that ran along the boundary of the court yard, meticulously built archways providing windows into the expanding corridors leading away from it. "If I just walked away, do you think I'd still be welcome within the realm?" he asked, turning to consider her. "I mean as a regular citizen without political responsibilities and without a bloody Consort?"
"Are you alright, Harry?"
"Because it might be useful."
As one might have expected, Ilaria hadn't taken it easy on him. They'd started with hand-to-hand combat, quickly moving on to weapon handling. Harry, much to his delight, had discovered how much his new senses helped him. His movements were quicker, his hearing picked up the smallest sounds, his eyesight narrowed to pick up the most minuscule of movements, and even his breathing calmed. He had the distinct impression that, in the heat of battle, it would be extremely difficult to sneak up on him. Unfortunately, for as improved as his senses were, they simply couldn't compare to the refined skills of the Realms Lady of the Southern Lands.
Soren couldn't help the smile. "Again, I apologize. I have to leave you. I'm needed elsewhere."
Not letting the opportunity slip by, Dumbledore spoke again. "So you plan to return to Hogwarts, then?"
Seeing the question in his eyes, she shrugged. "When he ingests your blood, he'll become an Elf. Anything else in his blood will be expelled, just as it was for you. There will be nothing to distinguishing him from the rest of us."
"As did I."
There was a brief flash of irritation that ran through him at the very obvious difference between his own rooms and these before he moved forward. Furthermore, he hadn't entirely been looking forward to a game of hide and seek. Perhaps the git didn't have to lock the door? Maybe the intention was to allow the intruder to find themselves far too irritated to bother once they'd finally managed to find what they were looking for. Opening the first door, Draco glanced in, raising an eyebrow in surprise when he found a smaller version of the Manor's main library. There were rows and rows of books lining the walls and several smaller shelves standing in the center of the room. Rather than the large tables in the library, this room held only plush armchairs tastefully placed around the room. Rather than any sort of work space, it seemed as though this particular collection was more for personal enjoyment than education. Snorting, he closed the door without looking at any of the titles, sure that the room was completely wasted on it's owner.
"That's not acceptable."
Harry braced himself for Gwynn's next attack. After blocking the quick movement, Harry followed with a quick tiao cut to clear the center space between them. Ducking her return swipe, Harry used the hilt of his sword to jar her outstretched elbow, resulting in a jerked movement of her arm and a loosening of her hold. Before she had a chance to react, Harry stood, twisting his sword sharply to connect firmly with Gwynn's and successfully dislodging it from her grasp. With the sound of the heavy weapon hitting the floor, Harry felt a bit of pride swelling in his chest. What he didn't count on, however, was Gwynn's quick recovery.
"Potter," he snapped, pushing Harry back once again, "Knock it off."
"He's trying to force a confrontation," he muttered, running a hand over his face. Frankly, none of them were ready for such a thing just yet ... even if that could provide him with enough of a distraction to slip back to the Manor and locate his Mother. The idea of using Potter as a distraction left an empty void in the pit of his stomach, but he ignored the pressure from the bond. "By drawing me out, he'll force that four-eyed dumbass out as well." For what purpose, he wasn't entirely sure.
Draco flushed. "I didn't bounce," he snapped. Now that Lothair had drawn attention to it, Draco realized that his entire body ached. He was sure that if he even tried to pick up his sword, he'd fall over. He felt like he had run full tilt into a brick wall. Which, he supposed, wasn't all that far from the truth. His eyes shifted back to Potter as Ilaria leaned over him.
He supposed she had a point. He shouldn't have used her for his own revenge. "Sorry," he muttered, feeling a little guilty for it. It wasn't her fault that Draco was so bloody frustrating. Nor was it really her fault that he seemed to have such a dislike for her or the fact that he might show some form of happiness. Maybe scowling all he time really was the answer. At least then the prat wouldn't be so temperamental all the bloody time.
Harry stopped, but didn't respond.
There was a long moment of silence as Lothair studied him, searching for something Harry could only guess at. "I know of an individual who could be helpful."
Masking the sound of his footsteps, Draco moved closer. Reaching the inner entrance to the grounds, he slipped inside, staying to the shadows. Given everything that had happened to him over the past week, he didn't feel like just waltzing into an unknown situation. He'd had more than enough near death experiences.
"I've been here a while, but I certainly wasn't idle. You know how I feel about the Royal Guard: absolutely lazy, the lot of them. They have spent far too long soaking up the luxuries that peace has offered them. I, for one, am quite glad to have a Prince in the castle once more. At least now they have no reason to skip their training sessions and even more reason to heed my warnings."
A brief flutter of eyelashes had Harry leaning in closer. "Draco?" he called, hoping the blond would wake so that Harry might be able to determine whether or not he was alright. When nothing happened, he tried again, "Draco?" This time sounding more firm. It took another moment before grey eyes now flecked with the same startling green as Harry's opened, causing Harry to draw in a surprised breath.
There were other reasons why an Alpha would not wish to be cooped up within Jade Manor and Soren looked to appease these concerns to better create a foundation to handle the entire situation. Harry had demanded that the second remain under their care until the event had been thoroughly examined. He had not said anything about the Alpha. His presence here was of his own doing, out of concern for one of his. He would have been a lesser man in many eyes if he had turned his back on a member of his pack.
Harry briefly considered whether or not he would classify that as a dig at his less then satisfactory defensive skills. He didn't, however, get much of a chance to decide. When he finally opened his mouth to respond the only thing that slipped past his lips was a loud gasp of unexpected pain. A white hot stab of pain shot through Harry's entire body, bringing with it a flash of images Harry barely had a chance to process, leaving him with such a strong sense of panic coursing through him that it left him struggling to draw in his next breath.
"It's not funny, Harry! There's going to be rumours now!"
"Malfoy Manor has a plethora of information," Draco responded, unaware of Harry's current thoughts. "Once the problem with Voldemort is solved, you can do with it what you will. Use it, sell it, burn the whole thing to the ground for all I care."
"GWYNN, NOW!"
I do not own Harry Potter or anything related to the Harry Potter verse. This story has been created solely for my own amusement and no monetary gain has been made from it's publishing.
Malfoy had made up his own mind, regardless of how it had affected those around him. Harry had risked even more than he'd known in order to save the blond and the Slytherin didn't hold a single consideration for his own life. His place here didn't matter. His life didn't matter. Harry didn't matter and that was fine. He hadn't mattered before. He knew how to be someone who didn't matter. Draco, on the other hand, did matter so Harry would keep them both alive for as long as he could.
Pansy raised an amused eyebrow. "No? Well, I guess we'll just continue on then, shall we?"
to his assigned room."
"As attractive as you are at the moment, I am afraid that there simply isn't enough room for two of me," Ilaria laughed, the sound ringing beautifully around them as a smirk tugged at the corner of her mouth. Raising a hand, she touched his forehead. The simple action caused Harry a slow moment of fascination. He could feel the spell unravel around him, loosening its hold on him before slipping too the floor. As intricate as the spells had seemed when they were being cast, he was surprised to see how easily they fell away. Gone were the blue eyes, the multicolored hair, and the clothing. During the trip he hadn't noticed how strange it felt to be in the clothes of another individual, but now that he was back into his own the difference could no longer be ignored. He was suddenly much more comfortable.
Despite the undetermined state of the boys health, the world continued to move forward. Three days had passed and those within Jade Manor were starting to find themselves growing restless. The tension was palpable throughout the castle, as though the very structure was aware of what was happening within it's walls. Even Soren, himself, was finding it difficult to find that inner calm. It did not help that, even now, he was faced with the repercussions of Harry's hasty actions.
"Absolutely not," the woman was saying, shooting the younger Elf an unwavering look, "I'll not have you putting me behind in my work simply because you can't eat at your own home."
I'm hoping inspiration continues for a while, allowing me to put more chapters out. This has been a work in progress for a very long time, so I'd definitely like to see me put out more than I have been. Thanks to all of you for your comments. I appreciate all of your support.
It was a good question, Soren had to admit to that. He had watched the Elven heritage skip over generation after generation only to surface in the most unlikely of characters. There was no rhyme or reason to its pattern. The Fates themselves choose who would inherit and who would continue to live among Wizarding kind. Their reasons were their own. "It was your destiny to be where you are now."
Harry didn't respond to Ron's shout, but Draco glanced briefly in his direction with an annoyed look. Things were already tense without that brainless oaf jumping in. At the arrival of the Gryffindors, Crabbe and Goyle moved to block their way, which had the redhead drawing his own wand and pointing it at them.
choose death once he found out? Could he stand by and allow that to happen? Even without taking the time to consider, Harry knew that he wouldn't be able to. Out of all the confusion and fear that was currently wrapped around him, Harry knew one thing for sure: Draco Malfoy was not allowed to die. He couldn't decide why this was, but he knew things would go bad very quickly should Malfoy suddenly cease to live. The blond played some part in this political game, Harry just wasn't sure which role he was suppose to play.
"Bloody hell," Harry coughed, spitting water to clear his throat. The body in his arms was still and the longer it remained so the less of a chance Harry had of keeping Draco alive. Glancing around desperately, Harry spotted several overhanging branches above the surface of the river. Angling himself in the right direction, Harry shot a hand out towards them. Several slapped against him before his fingers final scrambled against a large branch, allowing him to grab a hold. With one arm still wrapped firmly around Draco's waist. Harry struggled to use his free arm to pull the two of the closer to the shore, moving them inch by agonizing inch.
There was a moment of silence that hung heavily in the air before Rosalind began to speak. "While Draco's physical wounds have healed, we were concerned with the strange tattoo-like scars that were left in their wake. As we're all aware, given the circumstances by which he received these wounds, he should have been left with ridged scars as is typical with this sort of wound." Across the table, Hendrik nodded his head, acknowledging that her assessments were correct. "Furthermore, we were unaware of the full extent of the wound. Theodore," Nodding to the second, "has stated that he did not bite Draco during their altercation, but we could not verify if any saliva had, in fact, contaminated the wound. According to my findings, I can verify that Mr. Malfoy will not be be experiencing the shift."
Harry didn't comment, he just set off, allowing Draco to follow him in silence. Thankfully, he was quite aware of where the kitchen was located. It was one of his favourite places in the Manor. It helped that the food was just as delightful as the food at Hogwarts. He'd even been able to talk the cooks into making him Treacle Tart whenever he wanted it. They weren't entirely happy about incorporating human recipes, but given how happy it made Harry whenever he was served it, they had relented.
Hey guys. It's been a while. I know I keep apologizing for it, but I'm sorry. I started this story when I was in my first year of University ... which was literally 12 years ago now ... Merlin, I'm old. Needless to say, since then my life got busy with adulting and what not, and I am a much different person than I was when I started this story. That being said, I just spent the last couple days reading the first thirteen chapters and I REALLY like this storyline. It is MUCH more interesting than I remembered it to be and I'd like to continue with it. I will be going back over the previous chapters and cleaning it up. This will only be spelling errors and such. No major changes will be made so (unless you want to) you won't have to go back and read it over.
At the look of confusion on Soren's face, Draco rolled his eyes. "A werewolf," he offered by way of explanation. "Bitten. Not born." As he said it, his eyes shifted to Harry and he rolled his eyes at the confusion he saw there as a low murmur swept the group. The prat really had no idea about anything.
"But if you were to take a guess..." he trailed off, hoping for some sort of insight. Honestly, he had no idea what to expect. The only interaction he'd had with werewolves was the brief interaction with Remus when he'd transformed in third year and that wasn't exactly the best memory he had.
His first instinct was to deny the claim, but he held his tongue, biting down on the inside of his cheek to quell the desire. Soren had warned him against rash comments and he forced himself to think about it. "There are things left undone in the Wizarding world," he started, "things that if left unchecked could influence the peace in the Realm." During their discussion the night before, Soren had made it clear that his best bet was to paint his argument in the best light for the Realm.
This time it was Draco who responded. "Ilaria used her magic in a steady stream. You let it build up and released it all at once."
Taking the initiative, Ilaria placed her hands on his back and ushered him forward. "Come now, you've got this. Start with just basic sword skills and if the opportunity arises, you'll instinctively respond to the magic around you."
For several long moments, the two just held their positions watching each other. The silence lingered heavily around them until an exasperated sigh from Lothair seemed to urge Harry forward. Draco's eyes widened slightly at how quickly Harry moved. Despite knowing that their Elven blood gave them increased senses and abilities, he hadn't really explored anything other then the strength he had in his own body. Unlike his human body, the weight of the sword in his hand was nothing. Speed, however, had not been his focus and the smirk on Potter's face told him that the Gryffindor knew it as well. He quickly stepped forward, point of his sword digging into the ground as he forced the handle upward, using the flat of the blade to reflect the blow from Harry. Twisting around, his sword followed him, forcing Harry who had darted behind him to back off and giving Draco the moment he needed to adjust his stance.
"Good," Harry nodded, "Continue to report only to Lothair."
After several long moments of just blocking her attacks, Harry finally noticed the force behind each of Gwynn's attacks start to slacken. Of course, this didn't mean that her accuracy followed suit. While her swings might no longer cut him through, they would still cause severe and fatal damage. If he was not mistaken, Harry was almost positive that her attacks were getting closer and closer to hitting their target. One clean swipe from her outstretched sword and he'd be in serious trouble. The last thing he wanted to do was start his time in the Elven Realm with an emergency visit to the Healer.
The page that Soren had left open in front of him was made up entirely of a woman's portrait. Her dark hair hung freely over her left shoulder, cascading down the pale skin of her arm in smooth waves while, in striking shades of scarlet, her clothing spoke of a time long forgotten. Below the image was scrawled two small pieces of information. First was her name and birth:
As though sensing Harry's glower, Draco turned and their eyes caught. Receiving a raised eyebrow, Harry pulled his eyes away and scanned the rest of the party. He didn't want to talk to the prat right now. He was already in a terrible mood and Draco was more likely to make it worse than better. There was eight of them in total. Lothair, Draco, Gwynn, three other members of the guard, himself, and the individual who Lothair had assured him was quite capable of getting what they needed.
"If you've finished, we have a meeting to attend."
The question caused Harry to pause in his thoughts of Draco. What did it mean? It seemed to transfer over boundaries. No matter where he went, he didn't seem to be able to avoid it. "It means he comes from a family of Wizards. His bloodline has never been mixed with a non-magical bloodline." He wondered if this would be appealing to her, to the others here. Was he the outcast because of his Mother's bloodline. They all seemed to condemn those like Roland because of their mixed bloodline. Would they do the same for him if they found out. His eyes sought out Gwynn and he watched her take that in. No disgust or pleasure flitted across her face and for that he was grateful. He didn't want to have to defend Draco against the only friend he really had in the realm. In fact, she really didn't look all that interested in the matter.
"I haven't abandoned them!" Harry protested, trying to move around Draco, but this time Gwynn had shifted to block his way.
"Getting involved with the Wizarding world is pointless. They will die off, one way or another. Let them kill each other and be done with it."
The dagger was back in Lucius' hands when the other man returned to his spot in front of Draco. "You see," he smirked, trailing the edge of the blade across Draco's cheek, easily splitting the skin and drawing a low hiss from between Draco's lips. "We have plenty of time to discover your limitations, Draco."
"We can't ignore his presence at the border," Soren commented, interrupting any bout of bickering that was about to take place. "I, personally, would like to know how they came to know where the border to these lands lay."
"You're buying me a sword? Isn't there funds for that sort of thing?"
"I never said you weren't good enough," Hermione interjected, her annoyance evident, "I merely stated that outside of Harry we don't have any interests that are remotely similar."
It was strange to feel so comfortable sitting on bed in a hospital wing. There was a great difference between Madam Pomfrey and Rosalind, but the similarity of the two situations had a strangely calming affect on him. How often had he sat in the Hospital wing at Hogwarts? The place had practically become his home away from home. Most would not find the smell associated with a medical ward comforting, but to Harry it was. It meant he'd survived...even if it only for a little longer. It was about as close to being safe as Harry had ever felt, which was saying a lot about the state of Harry's life up until then.
Blinking, he turned his head to glance at Hermione, "I was listening, Hermione."
"You know what? Go find it yourself!"
"Damn it," he groaned, his good arm reaching out toward the nearest tree to brace him self. His panting breath echoed loudly in his ears as he closed his eyes, attempting to gather up the strength he knew he didn't have. Perhaps if he rested, just for a moment-
"You were completely reckless! Do you not understand what you could have caused running off into a bloody Werewolf feast? You could have ruined everything, you useless little fool!" This wasn't the first time since they'd left the forest Harry had been called a fool. He was even starting to feel a little bit like one, but he highly doubted Lothair's anger would be soothed by the admittance. He doubted there was anything that could soothe his anger now. Harry didn't think he'd seen Lothair as worked up as he was right then. Had he not been so worried about Draco and whatever was going on in the other room, he might have found it a little bit intimidating. "Worst of all, you left Gwynn to deal with a Werewolf on her own so you could run off and save some half dead human."
A strangled moan of pain was what alerted Lucius and the others to the new development. Lucius had not continued his line of torture and, therefore, could not claim to be responsible. Backing away slightly, the older Malfoy watched, as the air seemed to shimmer strangely around his son before Draco's entire body disappeared before his eyes, taking with it the manacles that had confined him and a portion of the dungeon wall where they had been securely connected.
At the dismissal the three Elves immediately straightened and disappeared from the courtyard. The presence of a High Lord and several commanding officers of the Royal Guard was enough that the courtyard was currently not the best place to be. A High Lord rarely sought out the young and if they did it certainly wasn't because you were doing well in your studies.
In all fairness, Harry thought it could have been a possibility. How was he to know that Hogwarts didn't have a mouthpiece? A moment ago he hadn't even known there were different types of magic in the structure. Shooting Draco, a look of annoyance at his snickering, he turned back to the statue and closed his eyes. It took him a moment but he managed to drown out the sound of the others around him and buried his consciousness into his core, finding his own pool of magic. He and Soren had been working on this briefly but it hadn't been to rearrange a magical structure. They'd used it as a means for him to become familiar with his own magical core.
Dumbledore.
Harry's had swiveled around to shoot him possibly the dirtiest look he'd ever seen on the Gryffindor's face, but stopped walking with such a dramatic flare. It earned him an amused snort from the blond behind him, whose steps quickly made up the distance now that Harry wasn't quite so intent on putting as much space between them as he could as quickly as possible. He wasn't sure why Draco hadn't gone off to find someone else to give him the tour of the castle. Hell, he still got lost when he tried to navigate the place. Surely there were people more equipped for this sort of thing. His eyes narrowed suspiciously, cutting over to sneak a glance to the taller man. Why had Draco asked him? Was he intending on finally getting his revenge on Harry for pulling him into this mess? Did he have something horrible planned?
Many of the visits to Poppy had been a direct result of the blond laying in the next bed. Whether it be hexing each other or full out physically fighting, the two of them were forever being sent to either detention or the Hospital wing in direct consequence of their actions and short tempers. This time, however, Harry couldn't pretend that it was just another day. He couldn't pretend that they would be all healed up and sent on their way. He couldn't pretend that things were going to simply go back to the way they'd always been once this was all over. Things would change and Harry just hoped it would not be a change either of them would regret.
"Heartburn?"
There was a spark of nervous energy within him as he moved to do what he was told, rolling up the sleeve on his right arm. This was it. If he was going to back out then now was the time to do it. There would be no turning back once the ritual had begun. Knowing this, however, Harry still moved to lay down on the bed. Whatever it was guiding his actions held positive that this was the right course of action. As his head hit the pillow, he desperately hoped that it was.
Harry noted that he had only mentioned exports, but kept his irritation in check. It didn't really matter what the lot of them currently thought about the Wizarding world. For the moment, they had gotten what they had needed out of them and that was enough. "Of course," he nodded his agreement. He doubted that agreement would prove to be as harmful as the earlier one would be.
is true, Ronald?"
"He is not to be held prisoner," Hendrik demanded, sizing Harry up as though he was expecting a fight, which Harry supposed he probably was. He was probably used to having to fight in order to secure his demands. Didn't mean that it didn't irritate Harry, regardless.
Everything hurt. His legs hurt. His arms hurt. His ribs hurt. His fingers hurt. Everything hurt. His head, however, hurt even more. When he'd first tried to blink his eyes open the pain had been so intense his stomach had churned and pushed up what little he'd eaten that day. It had felt as though every nerve ending he had was burning. Even now, two days later, Harry still felt it as she sat atop Erebus. He felt sluggish both his body and his senses. All in all, he wasn't in any sort of shape to face not only Dumbledore but the entire population of Hogwarts. Draco had plainly told him it was his own damn fault and to suck it up.
The second was a simple phrase:
"Don't be concerned about Voldemort," he responded, "Just enjoy being back." Seeing the look on Harry's face that stated he was about to protest, he continued. "There's been no new information since you left. He's had his own internal problems."
"Nothing? You're calling this nothing?"
"Ah."
"Draco?"
He wouldn't call them a nightmare, exactly. He didn't know what they were. He'd be there, watching the entire thing through the eyes of whoever this was happening to. It couldn't be him. He'd never been locked away like that. He'd felt young. Or whoever he was supposed to be had felt young. He'd sounded young, too. The terror he'd felt at the end was not something he'd ever felt as a child. It was something most children had never felt.
The image flickered out as Roland moved to glance over the maps spread out on the table in front of him. Things were progressing nicely. Soon enough, they'd be ready to move.
His lack of emotion was exasperating. "There hasn't been a council meeting in my entire life."
The statement caused a bit of commotion as said High Lords had not been told any of this previously. Ilaria and Lothair looked ready to voice their displeasure. Soren took the opportunity to cut them both off before they could. "And who, exactly, are you planning to take from the realm?"
Harry had experienced the Cruciatus curse before, but this was something else. This was much worse. He barely registered the fact that his screams were echoing off the stone walls of the corridor. He barely noticed Draco leaning over him, calling him. It felt like every nerve ending in his body was being stripped bare and lit on fire.
"Let us get to the matter, Soren."
"Why the hell didn't you stop him?" Draco asked, shooting the older Elf a glare.
I'm back! I know, I know. It's been a long time since I've updated this story ... or at least that's what it's telling me. I didn't think that I had left it for that long, but who am I to argue? Fact of the matter is that I've been seriously neglectful of it and I apologize to those of you who have read and were hoping for an update. I've reread the story and (for me) it's well written. I honestly don't understand why I stopped writing so I'm going to try and pick it back up. I have a fresh idea as to how the plot lines are going to connect and where I want the story to go so ... here's to hoping I can stick with it. *fingers crossed* I'm sure this update isn't as long as the last one, but I'm just getting back into it.
Silently they moved forward until they reached the tree line blocking the borderlands from view. Carefully, the group spread out to move through it, the three High Lords ahead of Harry, Draco, and Gwynn. The rest of the guard fanning out on either side. They made their way forward, through the dimly light woods until they breached the edge, stepping out into the murky light of dusk and into the sight of the five Wizards awaiting them.
Harry hadn't expected anyone to be brave enough to interrupt Ilaria's building tirade. He had learned quickly that one of Ilaria's skills was a rather shocking ability to lecture you in such a way that left you feeling like you were roughly three inches tall. At times she had even worked a lecture into running through sword techniques. It was altogether intimidating, to say the least. To have an unfamiliar voice break through the beginning or her newest lecture had Harry's head whipping around to locate the source.
"I don't want to try again!"

Never before had his Mother mentioned the prospect of him becoming a Death Eater. When his Father had discussed it with him, she had always been a silent figure in the background: never agreeing and never disputing. With her voicing his own fears, Draco could feel the emotion building in his chest, a lump forming in his throat and his eyes smarting as he realized that she meant to say good-bye.
Draco was furious. He was
Ginny chose that moment to slip into the spot beside him at the table, leaning in to murmur. "Ron asked Hermione out when she was staying with us," she responded, the amusement more than evident in her tone, "but Hermione didn't feel the same way."
Draco raised an eyebrow at that. Was he going on the defensive immediately or was it a ploy to draw him in. If he let Harry get inside his reach, he knew it was over. Draco's sword was heavier than Potter's slim gladius. Even without being told, Draco knew Harry would be able to maneuver it faster than he was able to move his own. Shifting his left foot back, he dropped the tip of his sword into a fool guard and waited. Let Potter make the first move.
"Of course not," Hendrik snapped, rolling his eyes at the impudence of Soren's little whelp.
Sorren nodded his agreement, even as Lothair asked if there was anything suspicious about how or where they had gathered.
that it isn't fair?"
"And why would I bother doing that?"
Spinning around, he headed out of the room, letting the door slam behind him. From the other side the rest of them could quite clearly hear the angry shout echoing through the main chamber.
"Draco."
Steeling himself against his resolve, Harry took a deep, calming breath and nodded. "Let's do it then."
the magic. It was hungry for it. Just what the hell had Daemeon created it out of. Whatever it was, the draw of magic to the sword took enough of the pressure off of him to allow him to focus back on Potter and his attacks. As impossible as it might have seemed, Potter was moving even faster, as though the very wind he was creating carried him. Maybe it did. He couldn't be certain. It was all he could do to keep up with him.
"Don't ask stupid questions!"
"You haven't called us to the Manor in over a century. It is curious that you should do so now."
"You didn't even change anything!" he exclaimed, waving his hand at him in annoyance.
The sound of his Mother's familiar tone sent such a rush of relief through him, Draco very nearly choked on his response. "Mum?" As the relief lifted, Draco could feel a growing sense of unease clawing away at his chest. His mother hadn't come into his room during the night since he was a child. "What are you doing?"
"Skirts, trousers, I don't care," Gabriel responded with a shrug. "Couldn't hurt, could it? It's not like you're going to be barking up the Prince's tree any time soon. I could introduce you to a few of the servants I've met?"
Draco was pretty sure a whimper escaped his lips as he attempted to inch himself backwards away from the approaching threat. As the wolf crouched lower, it's muscles tensing as it prepared to spring, Draco froze as a deep sense of horror enveloped him. He wasn't going to escape this. Just as he was about to close his eyes, both his attention and the attention of his attacker were torn away by the sound of heavy footfalls. Beneath him, he could swear he felt the ground tremble. He wouldn't have believed it had the trees to the left of them had not started to tremble.
On the other side of them, Draco was seething. He was torn between being angry that the green-eyed idiot was all over the hired help and being angry that he even cared who Potter was all over. In the end, he was just angry that the bloody bond was messing with his head. He had to keep reminding himself that he didn't feel anything but disdain for Potter... not exactly the truth, but it was what he was going to stick with. It was easier that way. He had more important things to focus on than being someone's bloody boyfriend, willingly or otherwise.
"That wasn't a request."
Gently taking the letter from her, Harry scanned the front immediately recognizing the handwriting. Ron. He very nearly groaned at the recognition. He had expected something like this sooner or later, but he had not expected it to come in the middle of the day while he was suppose to be sleeping soundly. Setting the letter aside, Harry flopped back onto his bed. Having left the window open, Harry could feel a light breeze drifting into the room and bringing with it memories of his earlier dream. The dreams were getting more vivid as the days passed. He had been so close this time. The name had been right there, just out of his reach. With the interruption of Ron's letter Harry was now back to the beginning with nothing other than a few hours of missed sleep.
Draco glared a moment longer. Free energy was one way of putting it. Idiocy was another. "If you say so," was the only comment he made. Taking a moment, he studied the man beside him. He didn't feel any sort of strength coming from him. In fact, he felt almost ordinary. "You're an omega, aren't you?" he asked, suspiciously. He supposed it made sense. It wasn't like they were on friendly terms with the wolves, so why would they send anyone else.
"You still have a long way to go when it comes to your swordsmanship, but there's no point in having you learn with a sword that you won't be using," she explained, following a path through the manor that she had clearly walked a thousand times before. After a moment, he realized that they weren't heading to the training grounds and he swordsmith that worked with the royal guard. Seeing the question in his gaze, Ilaria snorted. "If you want a real sword, you go to the master."
It was probably the first logical question that had been directed at him since the meeting began. "I can't say for sure," Harry admitted, his eyes turning to Ilaria, "I've witnessed turned werewolves, wizards, and dementors. There's also been murmuring throughout the order that he's swayed some of the Giants." Harry's thoughts briefly shifted to Hagrid and the forest behind the half-giants hut. "It's safe to say that the Centaurs will not be joining him."
"Quickly, get up. You don't have much time."
"They're barking at our borders," Hendrik snapped, his attention focused on Soren as he waved his hand in Harry's direction, "Demanding we bring the boy."
"I'm not playing quidditch," Draco responded, "I'm sitting here recounting your epic failure for those who missed it today."
Soren hid a smile as Harry agreed to the situation. He had never doubted that the boy would make the right choice. He could tell that Rosalind was not pleased with the outcome, but she would come around in time. She was just worried for their safety and the development of the bond between the boys. But unlike Rosalind, Soren knew instinctively that there was more to this particular Wizard than met the eye. There was a sadness around him that Soren couldn't help but notice, even in his unconscious state. Harry's actions had only cemented the idea into his mind. This was what was meant to happen. The balance would be restored as it should have been and Harry would be one step closer to finally coming into himself.
"So," Gwynn started, accepting the fact that Harry was set on doing what he had to. She didn't really know a thing about the relationship between the two boys, but it seemed that Harry cared a lot about him. After all, who would risk something like this in order to save another. There was a time for everything to die and he was fighting very hard to make sure this wasn't the time for Draco. "Tell me about him?"
There was a seed of triumph in Dumbledore's eyes. Draco could see it even from where he sat atop his horse. Dumbledore understood the same thing Draco did. If Draco was returning, Harry would to. He wouldn't be able to help himself. He'd put himself right into Dumbledore's hands just because Draco was going to. It was just the sort of selfless idiot the Gryffindor was.
Harry flushed, finding himself under the dark eyes of the elf behind the counter. "Uh...that's not entirely true."
"A life is not so easily tossed aside." It was the first time Harry responded, but he hadn't been able to help himself. Despite finding himself an Elf, he had not simply forgotten everything leading up to that point and he felt his irritation stirring at the assumption that he would.
"An explanation is needed, I agree," Soren started, taking the initiative to diffuse the clearly tense situation. A better awakening might have prevented the problem, but it was much too late to be concerned with that. Now, they would gradually have to bring him to realize the full extent of the changes he now faced. "However, before we do so, please allow Rosalind, the resident healer of Jade Manor, to ensure that your wounds have been healed completely." Appealing to his self-interest was the easiest way to move the situation in the direction needed to be taken. The wounds on the boys back were still spots of confusion for most of those in the room.
She didn't have to ask who Harry was talking about. "Like I said before, I can't claim to know what will happen. It's a completely unprecedented event."
Shooting a look across the room to Ron, the redhead shrugged and mouthed the word "sorry." Not that Harry believed for a second that he actually was. The git.
Draco glanced down, pulling his eyes away from glaring at Weasley to glance at Harry, whose eyes were darting all around the corridor.
Harry's eyebrow shot back up in surprise. It wasn't so much the fact that Hermione had turned him down that surprised him if he was honest. He was more surprised that Ron had gone through with asking. He'd been well aware of his friend's feelings for the brunette, but all he could think about was the time he'd asked Fleur Delacour out and he had to bite back a laugh as he imagined it.
"Get on!"
Lothair shot the blond a dirty look and Harry was slightly glad that he wasn't the target for once. He did, however, have to admit that he was curious about the elements. The sword was still clutched in his hand and he could feel the cool kiss of the wind against the back of his hand. The sudden urge to fly was tugging at him and he had to force himself to focus back on the conversation at hand.
Harry sighed, giving his tie another tug in an attempt to straighten it out as they hurried through the dungeons toward the Potions class. "I know, I know," Harry responded, already flustered with having started the day out late. "I'm sorry, but Dumbledore called us to his office and I didn't know I wouldn't be staying in the dorms."
The two continued to walk in silence, Harry leading the way and Draco taking in every detail of the trip so that he could recall the location in the future when he didn't have someone to guide him. He couldn't keep asking for assistance. It took a few minutes, but eventually they made it to the kitchen. Draco wasn't sure what exactly he'd been expecting, having never really ventured into the kitchen at Hogwarts or even at the Manor. When he had wanted food, he'd simply called a house elf. He had not, however, been expecting the bustle that had seemed to erupt in the large room. Everyone else may not be getting out of bed for another hour or two, but it looked like the fires had been stoked a while ago. The scent of freshly baked bread was already filling the space and the warmth that circulated the room wrapped around them tightly.
"Yes," she said dryly, "It is."
"No," he responded, slowly, "Why would I need to talk to McGonagall about it? I've only been gone for two weeks. Games haven't even started yet."
"A wizarding war with myself at the center," Harry continued, his tone perhaps a little more clipped than he had intended. It was getting harder and harder to control his emotions. The broken bond within him was still screaming at him to acknowledge it and the lack of interest that Aranel was showing was pressing at the edges of those thoughts that lingered on those he cared about outside of the realm. "I am the target."
Offering him a calming smile, Rosalind made a deep, two inch incision down his wrist. Harry expected to see blood instantly bloom, but was surprised to find only the vibrant red line marring his skin. Pulling his eyes from his wrist, Harry watched her repeat the action on Draco's pale wrist, only to receive the same result. With both wrists now prepared, Rosalind first took Harry's before placing Draco's over top of it, their skin pressing together. Harry was surprised to find the cool quality of Draco's touch and worried eyes shifted to Rosalind. Any questions he might have asked were put on hold as a draft ruffled the fringe of his hair and Soren appeared beside Rosalind, a white strip of fabric in his hand. Taking a moment to give Harry a reassuring nod, he began to wrap the fabric around their wrists, binding them together as Rosalind began to speak in low tones, the language unfamiliar to Harry's ears.
As the blood dripped down his pale cheek in a startling contrast of red and white, the pain shifted. It wasn't centered at the wound on his cheek and shoulder, but rather just below his heart. His instinctive reaction was to curl in on himself, but his restraints prevented him from doing so, leaving him feeling even more exposed then he already was. It had started out as a light throb, but as the seconds ticked by the pain only intensified. There was nothing he could do to alleviate the pain, which felt like the weight of the entire world was pressing down forcefully on his heart, and Draco nearly crumbled under the assault.
It was the first time since he'd breached the news that Hendrik had spoken.
"Harry is more than welcome to come and go as he pleases. The borders of our lands do not keep him confined. Should he wish to see those he cares about, he has the freedom to make that decision."
Furthermore, I decided in the end to use the Horcruxes since it fit in well with where I was taking this story. Keep in mind that this is an AU story and Harry's acquiring of the Horcrux knowledge will not be in the same method as in the books.
"They all carry wands," the scout confirmed. "Nothing else."
Now that they had all been seated, Soren took the opportunity to begin. For several long minutes, Soren went about the process of formally introducing those sitting around the table. Harry, for his part, nodded in respect and did his best not to shift in his seat impatiently. It was a trivial moment and done for no other purpose but to say that it had been done. They knew who he was. He knew who they were. Hell, with the way Faelyn's eyes focused solely on Draco as though dissecting him where he sat, he was going to go ahead and assume that they knew absolutely everything that had occurred since Harry's own arrival in the realm.
"The realm is beside Hogwarts?" Harry asked, dryly.
Harry tensed again, watching as Draco stalked closer and tried to subtly step in front of Gwen in an attempt to keep the blond's attention on himself. "That isn't fair-" he started, his eyes widening slightly as Draco was suddenly standing in front of him. He didn't think the blond even knew how quickly he'd moved. One moment he'd been ten feet away and then the next he'd been suddenly standing in front of Harry, his hands clenched in the front of Harry's shirt.
"Harry..." she started, eying his tense frame and already knowing what it was he wanted to do. "It's not worth it."
"I've been busy," he replied, flatly. He had no intention of telling her anything, especially sitting at the Slytherin table where there were more than a handful of ears listening in.
"One of them is not human."
"Why?" Ilaria asked, curiously.
"Well," Draco sighed, crossing his arms. "Let's get a move on, shall we? I'd rather not stand around in this sewer for the foreseeable future."
"You're likely the most compatible," Lothair commented, glancing at Harry.
Gwynn had not expected to see Harry much in the coming weeks. It was disappointing, she could admit, having grown rather fond of the ridiculous Elf. She couldn't fault him for his absence, however, word had spread quickly through the castle about a possible Consort. It seemed that despite the High Lords intent to keep such information from circulating, it had managed to slip free. The entire manor was buzzing. So when Harry stormed into the training courtyard, a rolling black cloud of anger hovering over him, she was rightfully surprised. Nor was she surprised when those who had previously been using the area had quickly disappeared.
There were certain things about being in the Elven realm that Harry particularly loved. The hot springs, for instance, were something Harry was immensely fond of. The water stemmed from deep below the manor, reaching up to break the rock at several points. There were three separate spots in the city where bathing houses had been established to take advantage of the naturally heated water. The last vein ran directly into the manor where it was split off into two separate locations. The first was designated for those who lived and remained in the Manor. The second was, to Harry's surprise and delight, specifically for his use. When Gwynn had mentioned taking some time to relax and prepare himself for the ritual taking place that evening, Harry had instantly thought of the hot spring.
"Just because I'm not throwing a fit doesn't mean I don't care!"
"Send out the Wolves!" He hissed, releasing the Elf with a hard shove. The Werewolves needed to be eliminated and he wanted it done the first time. The Alpha Male, while not the most intelligent of beings, was the perfect individual for the job. He knew how they fought. He knew how they'd defend themselves. He, most importantly, knew how to slaughter them. "I want the entrails of every Wolf not bearing my crest scattered across the forests."
"What do you know about what I want?"
"Why are you still playing Quidditch?"
Harry followed behind Soren, focusing on where he placed his feet and how he maneuvered Draco's form through the dense trees. For all his precautions, however, Harry very nearly dropped him as they emerged from the trees to find the injured Werewolf he'd left for Gwynn sitting safely between two others, Ilaria and two of her guards stood with him. A deep growl worked its way up from his chest at what appeared to be a conversation between one of the Wolves and Ilaria.
"What?" Harry gaped. Even without looking at him, Draco could feel the questions burning into the back of his head. He had, after all, basically said the opposite back at the Manor. If truth be told, he didn't give a shit about continuing his education, but this was the opportunity he needed to find out the truth and he was going to take it. Ignoring the brief flash of guilt from his actions, he continued.
tired of waving around a series of ridiculous weapons. "Can't we do something other then training? No swords. No Bows. No discipline. No Orders. No training! This is suppose to be our leisure time and you've got us out here slashing away at each other with sharpened swords." He held up his hand to show her the small cut on the back of her hand, as though that alone should make up her decision. "Don't you ever just relax and have some fun?"
are telling
he defended, feeling strangely insecure in the face of Draco's anger. He'd never had a problem facing Malfoy down before, and the fact that he now had the distinct urge to retreat irritated Harry. "You're welcome, by the way." he snapped, focusing on that anger in the hopes of forcing away his more passive urges.
"I don't know what you're talking about."
Had Harry been paying attention to anything beside the growing pain in his chest, he might have been impressed with how quickly he was moving. He'd grown accustomed to Elves automatically moving out of his path, but as he rushed toward the stables those he passed barely had the chance to recognize who was passing them. Harry could still hear Gwynn's shouts behind him, but there wasn't a part of him that wanted to pay much attention to what exactly it was that she was saying. He could take a guess, but he knew well enough that it would be anything but flattering. It was rash, he knew, to go running off toward an unknown danger, but every fiber of his being told him to hurry. Soren and Ilaria would certainly not approve.
It could give him the opportunity to find information on his mother. Information he wasn't sure how far he'd go to get.
If he'd wanted to kill the idiot he'd have been able to do it nine times over by now. Leaning forward, he snatched up one of the abandoned pillows and irritably pelted Potter in the head with it. The impact had the desired affect and Harry sat up suddenly, glancing around in bewilderment.
Gwynn shot him another look when he didn't explain further, studying him for a moment. She wasn't entirely sure what had shifted in him, but she couldn't say that it was a change for the better. He had been thinking on a more clear level these past few days, but it was frightening. There were times when she glanced away she thought she saw dark tendrils of shadow curling around him from her peripheral only to be gone when she glanced back.
Paying no heed to either the bustle or Draco's look of surprise, Harry muttered a few apologies and made his way over to the far side of the room. As they grew near, he spotted a very familiar figure doing her best to sweet talk her way into a decent meal from the stony faced woman who ran the kitchen.
The problem with this, however, was that Draco Malfoy was no longer enamored with the idea of following his dear Father's example. Draco had grown up idolizing the man, but with age had come a certain insight into his presumptions. As each day went by it was getting particularly difficult to recall the reasons why he'd idolized the man. For years, Draco had been lectured on what should and should not be condoned as proper Malfoy behaviour. Bowing down to another individual was certainly not condoned and Draco was just arrogant enough to believe it. Since the Dark Lord's return, Malfoy Manor had seen more then it's fair share of darkened doorways on the account of the inner circle and Draco had borne witness to the way in which Lucius Malfoy grovelled at the feet of Tom Riddle. Lucius wasn't the right hand man of the Dark Wizard, for there wasn't any respect shared between the two. One was master and one servant. Lucius was a lap dog, smearing the name of Malfoy with every breath he took. However, Lucius Malfoy was a lap dog that fully intended to place his only heir directly into the hands of Wizarding Britain's darkest individual. It was suppose to be an honour, but Draco only felt nauseated. The way Voldemort's eyes lingered whenever Draco could not escape his presence did nothing to quell his very real fears.
"I've already told you. I don't know my way around."
I do NOT own Harry Potter or anything related to the Harry Potter verse. The creation of this story was simply for my own amusement. Everything belonging to the Harry Potter reverse belongs to J.K Rowling. No monetary gain was made from the creation of this story.
Harry's eyes shifted to the blond who rode next to Lothair, his mounts coat a deep chestnut with a mane as dark as Erebus'. Much to Harry's growing irritation, the git moved with ease as though he'd been born in the damn saddle. Just another thing the pompous git was better than Harry at.
"It's not going to open its great mouth and start talking to you, you fool," he responded, rolling his eyes, "connect to the magic."
"There is still plenty that needs to be done, but some of the wounds he has sustained I cannot heal," she responded, coming to stand beside him, her eyes fixed on her patient. Harry could tell that she didn't like admitting that. She was very passionate about her work and he could tell that she didn't like not being able to help more and that helped ease his mind just a little. How could Draco die when he had someone so dedicated caring for him? "The wounds on his back are what worry me the most. It is understandable that they would take longer to heal than the others, given that they were created by the claws of a Werewolf, but still there should have been some progress. They are, however, just as fresh as they were when he arrived. The wounds are not closing and they're not responding to any of the magic or poultices that I've used so far."
Lothair raised an eyebrow as Ilaria laughed and slung an arm proudly around Harry's shoulders. "You're not as dumb as you look, after all."
"I don't know," he muttered, rubbing idly at a spot on his chest that lay just above his heart. "I can't seem to concentrate." Which wasn't entirely the truth, but it was as far as he was going to explain. Every time he attempted to focus his mind on the task at hand, Harry's mind started to fill with a sense of panic that he simply didn't understand.
Never had he considered the possibility of finding a place more beautiful than Hogwarts. To him, Hogwarts represented far more than just a pretty landscape and architecture. It was the first place he had truly felt at home. It wasn't until Hagrid had taken him from the dismal life of a despised Muggle had shown him a world of magic and wonder that Harry had first felt like he was coming into what he was truly supposed to be. He was meant for more than being a servant. He was meant to have friends, family, and he was meant to feel loved. With all the emotions and wonder that had been tied to his very presence at the school, Harry had never thought that anything could challenge it's hold on him, but the moment he had stepped through the entrance of Jade Manor he'd known he'd been mistaken. He was well aware of the fact that he had never before stepped foot into this manor, but as his footsteps had echoed and bounced off the stone walls Harry had felt a strong sense of familiarity fill him, pulling at his very soul and wrapping him firmly in a warm embrace.
