The veins in Draco's neck were clearly visible now. His breath was ragged and struggling but he still kept upright, still suppressing his own magic.
Kreacher acutely sensed his thoughts and said in a mellowed voice and lowered head , showing that he didn't mean harm , " Kreacher….. is a Black house elf and…... wants to serve….. the Black family. Kreacher…. doesn't have bad thoughts "
Draco woke up to the slight shake at his shoulder. Harry looked at Draco silently, waiting for him to regain his consciousness.
After the reassurance from Hermione, Pansy's body had finally given up and collapsed from exhaustion.
After saying, he turned to the old house elf and said, "Kreacher, pick up Dobby and bring him with us"
Draco did as told and found that he could see the inside of the ring. The space was as big as his dorm and had the shelves placed properly in it . Just to experiment , he tried to pull an object with his magic and found it immediately in his hand .
Turning to Harry , the Headmaster requested," I cannot do this alone. Again , I must ask you for this sacrifice, Harry "
Silent magic cleaned Draco as Harry drew the covers over him and was about to slip in as well when Ron came in .
" You are not alone . There are others" Dumbledore said with a very slight hint of surprise. His words were fast and precise in an attempt to extract as much information as possible before the death eaters arrive .
Six wands slowly raised up, their tips touching one another. As pansy spoke with clear and sonorous pronounciation , " Do you , the ones present here, make an undying oath on your magic to be loyal and never betray our guides and benefactors, Harry James Potter and Draco Lucius Malfoy, as well as each other for today, tomorrow and forever henceforth? "
Well, since this buffoon has already got them here, then why not just get done with what he wanted to do.
How can she let any danger, any threat around them , harm them ? No, she won't, even if that threat is herself and the cost is her happiness. She will erase her entire existence from their life if that's what she has to do to protect them.
She took out her wand and kept it at hand. But what could she do when she didn't even know what was happening to her ? So she decisively keeps going in the hope that her brothers and allies will help her.
With a mischievous glint , he said to Draco ," Of course , little descendant . After all ,  I am far too old . One can be quite forgetful in old-age , needing a little descendant to take care of him . Ahh , little descendant , forgive this oldman , I will let you be the responsible one.  I am very grateful for your care , little one . "
The lessons were very valuable and precious. He was not only taught defence but also offence in both magical and physical sense. His views took a large turn after meeting Eloise and seeing some things he experienced and the illusion tests Eloise had him take broadened his views further.
With a delight , he called ," Oh! Harry ! What brings you----" But was stunned into silence when a saw who was hiding behind Harry.
The voice of an old elf sounded. Harry turned around and was surprised to see Kreacher standing there.
Draco knows that they care and worry and he also wants to tell them but this might unknowingly pull someone totally away from it into the mess, if it spreads. So he keeps his mouth shut as his friends keep giving him glances and stares but do not utter a word.
The day went as always even with the helpful inputs from Luar every now and then . Draco had been somewhat absent these days , thinking about the information he read , his condition and the dark mark . This did not go unnoticed by Blaise and Pansy , who silently approached him in the potions classroom .
From beside him, the vicious and poisonous giggle of Umbridge echoed , settling the fear deeper into the heart of the audience.
Hardly 15 minutes passed before they stopped again. Not in a comparatively silent and deserted neighborhood, Harry and Draco stood facing one of the every normal and inconspicuous houses.
Hedwig dropped six letters down in the bed as it landed on Harry's shoulder . He kindly brushed his palm over its feather before offering some treats as a payment and some more as a generous reward for the loyal beast's hard-work.

Draco did not know how much time passed when a house elf came in. He gasped at the sight of Draco but did not utter a word and started gently cleaning him. His eyes were filled with pity and helplessness as he softly tended to Draco. He was their lord's prized possession, he was supposed to be handled as gently as the thinnest and most fragile porcelain.
With that , they started to suspiciously look around, searching every nook and corner . Neville, having searched around the entire upper deck , shifted his sight to the small space covered in darkness below the wooden deck under his feet . When Ron informed, walking out, " I'll check the stairs if someone's there."
It gave a shrill scream and moved to enter Draco again when Luar confined it within an enchanted vial.
His eyes flashed a hint of worry and grief for his mother before it disappeared as quickly as it came, "Narcissa. Narcissa Malfoy neé Black "
Draco didn't answer. His gaze locked at the furniture on the other side of the room, refusing to look at him.
Blaise was the first to look away as he gave a shallow cough. His gaze travelled to look at where his hand still loosely gripped Neville's waist.
Draco's face showed clear doubt but he nodded. Even if he did not agree, he still believed Harry's judgement. But he still did not want to stay here alone .
Draco didn't pursue it as well. Completing his task he got up and silently made his way to the third smaller tent behind. Opening the tent, Draco silently passed a small vial inside.
When he was finally calmed , Draco looked around to find that they were in a forest. How did they get here ? He silently let Theo sit under a tree to scan around the area. Realising that neither Dobby or Kreacher were here , he called , " Dobby ! Kreacher ! "
Getting down, Harry quickly helped Draco down . As the bus departed again, they started walking through the hustle and crowd. The synonymous look and architecture of metropolitan houses passing by from the corner of their eyes .
As soon as Harry had stepped inside the house, he had already checked the perimeter with his magic. Finding that there was no other presence in the house other than the three of them, Harry let down a bit of his guard. Afterall, what could be the worst thing an old hag with one foot already in the grave could do ?
Harry looked at the boy beside him and sorrowfully noted the dark circles and tiredness on his face. He slowly sat up and said, "Wait here for a second. I'll be back"
" Ahhh~ ever so perceptive , aren't you ?" ; Whispered Harry . He wanted Malfoy to remember this fear. Wanted him to remember what Harry could do to his life . But no matter how much he reminded , Malfoy always forgot . Such was the anatomy of Draco Malfoy , the threat was remembered but the fear it brought forgotten . The calamity was lost but the disaster it bought always stayed behind . But it didn't matter , Harry will keep on reminding him .
" Oh ! Off with it now . Now that you have heard me play , I expect better than those torture skills next time." Pansy said , taunting .
How is it going till now ? I expect all of you to be well and healthy and thankyou for reading my fanfiction .
Now that he mentioned it, Draco does remember a third presence other than Harry and Luar that time in the cave. He was partially conscious that time. The presence also was the one who saved him at the last bend of the ritual.
Draco's knee lightly brushed on a certain hard wood and Harry drew a sharp breath in. The wood grew even taller , such a top quality and rapidly growing wood it was ! Surely,  the durability will be unrealistically long and the sap would be sticky and nourishing ! Draco would definitely enjoy it to tears while panting and moaning in delight !
sounded and a huge egg was dropping from the air into his arms. A desperate sound was about to rip from Draco's throat when he remembered what Harry told and forcefully closed his throat up.
The green hue and arched lips ,as if casting a spell , had Draco relax bit by bit .  Calmer than before, He looked up with worried eyes and said with an urgent voice, " Potter, you remember what I told you right ? This will only result in the worst."
So did you like the chapter? I know it took a bit too long for me to upload but you know..... Sorry~
Just then he felt a slight intrusion enter his head. He could feel the gentle and cool caress on his head as a gentle elderly voice spoke in his head.
Draco's words bought a much needed relaxation as everyone calmed down from their tensed and overly vigilant state they were in. Small and grateful smiles were sent his way as Draco reassuringly smiled back, answering their unsaid query that he was well and alright.
Hearing her name being called, the small eyes opened and sleepily looked up at both their faces, "Ahh?"
"Hmm " ; replied Malfoy as he again closed his eyes and Harry could already feel his magic surrounding the egg .
Questions jumbled in his head. Why was Draco crying? What happened? What was he himself feeling? It was as if the arrows were shot but without an aim.
That day Harry had a peculiar aura around him. An aura that gave Draco chills down his back but at the same time made his entire body so sensitive, so aware of him that being in the same room as him seemed impossible. To Draco, Harry seemed enchantingly suicidal.
Harry and Draco still sat in the same position, in each other's embrace. Draco's arms numbly hanging at his side. His anger in his eyes now finally fading to unwilling fatigue.
In the following days, Draco had tried his best to treat and help the comastat headmaster to no effect. Days were going busy and lonely for Draco . Everyday he used to practice his potion making skills , then read books and then practice dueling.He was striving to achieve his goal . To fulfill the promise he made to himself . He was going to become stronger , stronger than Harry . So that when he will be standing beside Harry, he won't feel that he was unworthy.
A gasp escaped Draco's lips . His eyes trained on The Headmaster's hand. The skin there was extremely wrinkled and sticking to the bone . Blackened by the effects of evil and dark magic . If it was someone else , they might not realise but Draco did. It was corrupting him and rotting his magic . Headmaster was dying and if they did not do anything soon , the day will come even faster.
Harry and Draco watched the egg with quizzical surprise. It's behaviour seemed almost similar to a baby. The more they looked the more baffling it was.
Outside the infirmary, two figures stood with their heads down. The taller on holding onto the more petite one as she muffled her cries in his shirt. They were both overwhelmed by the scene. Ron and Hermione had left the dinner early to warn Harry about Professor McGonagall requesting all the professors for an urgent meeting and witnessed this scene after getting here. They were first shocked and then grieving for someone they never thought they would. The figures soon left as it was getting hard to just be there hearing their enemy's hoarse cries as he wept on their best friend's chest.
And suddenly, a year's long misconception and misunderstanding broke. Hermione finally saw that just because the books say that Slytherins are vicious doesn't mean they actually are. Everything and everyone has exceptions and conditions for doing and being something.
This chapter is Draco's POV with little Harry's POV. Draco feels that what happened that night in infirmary was a dream and is quite sure of it and dismisses it just like that but harry remembers and now he views Draco as innocent but is not entirely sure what Draco really is. All he knows is that Draco does not want to do what he is doing. On the other hand Draco tries his best to find ways to remove dark mark for his mother and other Slytherins in Hogward's whom he considers his sworn siblings, whose parents no longer care if they lived or died. Draco feels this is his responsibility as these people have seen him as their leader consciously or unconsciously for years and now that they have no one to rely on and no political support or guarantee of life, Draco will not leave them alone for the ministry to catch and blame. They are his people, his snakes, after all.
" Interesting. It was the same night that I met Eloise. I was out that night as well, particularly in the room of requirements. Master was the one who appeared before me. That night I accepted his mentorship and bond as a student "
So another question, I asked you guys if you wanted siblings for eggie's . If yes then how ? Mpreg ? Magical? Same as eggie ? Adopted?
Some time went by and when Neville opened his eyes again, the first thing he felt was the soft cloth his head was buried in and the firm softness under his head.
It turns out that because Draco had black blood inside of him , the black manor recognised the danger and swiftly aparated him , and with him Theo , out of the manor. When he disappeared , the man tried to capture the elves and attacked them for information but failed when Draco called Kreacher and Dobby to him.
The gems lay side by side, one black and the other white, both of them possessing a mystical gleam with various colors shining in them like wisps of smoke above a bright flame. Draco couldn't feel any obvious magic from them. They were probably non-magical gems. Even though they were absolutely useless, something about them made Draco feel that they were made for him. With this, Draco's decision was made. Either way, he thought that the black opal particularly suited Harry.
Pulling back her mind from a haze of Pansy's unconscious seduction, Hermione sighed and ruthlessly told, "It's all too late. He's already too far gone."
As soon as Draco reached near, Harry pulled him behind, standing firmly in front in a protective pose. His voice carefully whispered, "Don't speak and don't use magic."
Draco's voice was tired and weary when asked Harry, "We haven't been paying much attention to him, have we?"
Startled, Draco snapped his head towards the voice. His eyes wide after registering Harry. He asked, "What are you doing here, Potter? ", His words were angry but his voice was pained and gruff from the toll he took yesterday. His face into turning into a scowl at the sight of Harry's face.
" AAHhh !!" a shout sounded beside Draco's ear and he was so startled that his hand subconsciously tightened.
Hearing this , Draco's smile blew so wide that it almost reached his ears . He was about to continue when again stopped in his tracks and realised that he did not even know his Papa's name ! Before he was reserved , but now that they are family , it should be fine . So he asked ," Papa , now can you tell me about yourself ?"
This trick absolutely did not work on Draco but made him narrow his imaginary eyes instead. Draco was still wary but powerless as well. His body was still unable to move and his magic still locked inside. He had no way to defend himself if the voice attacked him. He was defenseless and vulnerable. Now, he could only wait and watch. This could  as well be the day of his death . Thousands of scenarios flashed by in Draco's head as he grew restless. Hopefully he will he able to celebrate his next birthday.
Draco silently looked at the injured house elf and the boy sitting at some distance , pale with fright. He really needed help. He couldn't take care of both of them at once.
Harry was curious as to why he was asking after the two. Afterall, he wasn't all that familiar with them. But Harry still replied, "Yes"
At this Draco stilled. Did he ? Did he trust Potter enough to give his life in his hands? The answer , astoundingly and anomalously, was yes. Draco trusted Harry to the extent that if Harry truly asked him to jump off a cliff , then Draco would fall head first while trusting Harry to somehow catch him. When had they become so close ? Was it in the hallways ? Or was it their accidental meeting in the forest ? Or maybe it never truly happened , it was just there. It had always just been there but they just never saw it.
Sitting at the Slytherin table, Draco saw Harry eating his meal just across from him . With a start, He remembered the new medicine he made . It was a healing pill inspired from a very potent potion recipe he read a while ago . Draco made certain improvements in it so that it impacts all kinds of wounds and makes the healing process quicker. But he did not test it till now so it's efficiency was unknown. And who would be a better guinea pig than the great Potter .
In the haze of these images and pain, Harry felt a cool force against his magic , pulling him and nudging him. It felt as if it was trying to hold on to him, to anchor him to something.
Harry looked at the cheeks reddened ripe , before because of the tears and now further because of the rubbing. Right now Harry felt like he was literally drowned in a huge pot of sweetness. Seeing Draco like this , so close, felt like lying on a bed of nails and rolling around in white clouds at the same time. It felt like drinking liquid crucio flavoured with honey.
Harry slowly lifted Draco's feet to pull out the shoes and socks before neatly keeping them aside. He took out the all-purpose magical medical cream he carried. The small cylindrical box was opened and revealed a green translucent salve with herbal fragrance .
Something about Draco just drew his whole body in. He was just so attractive. Even in a crowd of millions, Harry was sure that his eyes would automatically find Draco . It won't even take him a second. It was as if Draco was glowing.
" A veela . It seems whatever happened to her seemed to aim for either torture or her life . Maybe both . It was because of her that the magic around here was unstable . It was her magic doing that  " ; Luar's voice sounded .
The Silence streched. Dobby who stood there thunderstruck by the revelation finally regained his senses, " Ma-"
As Harry was about to leave , Draco hurriedly said , " And remember that it should be something small yet able to supply enough energy , like sandwiches . If available, take some of those water bottles we saw yesterday. They are easy to handle and cheap as well, perfect for travel "
Due to the pain , Draco was barely able to understand the words . He did not have energy or support . The only thing making Draco still persist was his will . Every second was an endless effort to live .
Draco was momentarily dazed . He didn't expect Potter to ask this . It seem that Gryffindors were even more stupid than a fat pig !!! Hitting right on the sore spot !!! He was tempted to bite back but closed his mouth and replied ," Destiny is not as kind to everyone as it is to you "
My first cliff hanger !! How did you think I portrayed the intense scene? Did it feel overwhelming emotion ?
And let's not forget ,  all of you guys have voted for Mpreg . I have to say brilliant choice. So keep waiting for the new babies as I plan how to make them .
In his thinking, Draco did not even realize that he was already at the library. Stopping in front of the restricted section, Draco remembered what he read in the book. He followed his instinctual memory and slowly relaxed his mind as he let his magic spread in the air around him. He then closed his eyes and felt everything his magic touched as he surveyed the surrounding. It felt as if he did not have two eyes but ten, so that he could look all around him and even feel the sound of slight flutter of wing from outside the window. It was a novel experience, Draco admitted. Then, inch by inch, he retracted his magic within his body, precisely at the center of his chest. Gradually, No magic was left out and all of it was tightly looked in that small space. Draco could feel his magic forming a small, marble sized, pale turquoise ball in his chest. His magic swirling as a silent tornado in it.
He could feel his magic shake with Draco's every wail. He had questioned himself if this was a farce staged to trap him or not. Now, he felt the answer to this question. These tears were not a farce. These emotions, this magic around him swirling with desperation, these were not false. Draco did not change but he was pushed to this point.
Schooling his face to put on the usual cold and expressionless mask , Draco moved past Potter to get back to the castle . He did not wish to speak or banter with Potter right now . He had better things to do .  It was then that he felt a rough hand grab his elbow and a slight intrusion in his mind . Draco broadened his occlumens sheild as he looked back at Potter and demanded ," What is the meaning of this ,Potter ?"
Just as he was about to put the matter behind, an idea sprouted in his brain. He swiftly turned around.
Ron hesitantly looked at the circular corridor outside the lift and hesitantly asked, " What should I do about the rain ?"
The slit eyes slowly started to close again when Neville reluctantly said with a very low whisper , scared of anyone else hearing, " Pansy ! Remember what she said today ?"
The continuous footsteps were drawing closer and closer and soon the black and grey dress adorning a woman with jet black curls was seen . The lady was a sight of wonder , of dread, of grief . The maddened gleam in her eyes made her look dead even if she was alive. In the dim light of dark clouds, she seemed like the beloved mistress of death and pain herself.
As the elf dwelled in his chaotic thoughts , he didn't notice that Harry was still waiting for his answer .
" This is like a travelling trunk , just more convenient . You do not have to worry about theft as it can only be accessed by you . Anyone else cannot open it , it has recognised your magic and won't follow another . Rest assured "
Several "I do" rang out as the tips alight one by one. When all the six wand tips were glowing, Pansy concluded, " With all of our agreements , I make this magically binding contract valid . If any were to break it, the price will be what you swore on "
*Heaven's golden son - an extremely fortunate person who brings good luck to himself as well as people around him.
Hermione promptly stopped asking, smartly giving Harry some space. Around them, complex emotions flashed in the six pairs of eyes. All of them were curious as to what Harry saw and who was this Gregorwitch ? Even with the questions in their heads, the silence outside prevailed. They all clearly knew that if it was something worth knowing they would naturally be informed sooner or later.
, Draco thought in astonishment. Now that he thinks of it, he knew almost nothing about Headmaster Dumbledore's life. He curiously flipped through the book, not particularly reading anything.
Harry thought as Draco , unable to realise the hellish turmoil he was wrecking in Harry's brain , looked up to him with glassy blushing eyes and blinked, fluttering his curly wet tresses. His lips parted to display a small red tongue resting there, as if a sweet sensual fruit soaked in flowery wine to create an aphrodisiac for every sense - sight, touch, taste, smell and sound,  just waiting to be consumed with delight.
– that he didn't need to suffer anymore, that the act he so much wanted to do but was too scared to perform was, now, gifted to him by someone else. Maybe he thought this was his last deed. Maybe not. No witness was present to tell us ultimately what those emotions in his eyes told. The only other person was too lost to recognize even himself. So the only hope we have is if the person himself survives. Maybe he will tell us?
" I know you need this . But - but I can't do this ", he said bowing his head , his voice a mere whisper.
" W-what ? H-harry ?" The stutter sounded clear and confused but friendly , all their past pains and grievances forgotten .
Pansy's frown deepened. She swiftly moved , frantically opening her travelling purse to find something. Sometime went by and when she didn't find what she wanted , Pansy again lifted her chin up. Gripping her own sleeve ending in her own finger , she lifted her arm high to carefully wipe Hermione's cheeks.
In his thoughts some time passed. Draco did not move or walk around . He stayed in the same place and made minimum moments. This place was unknown to him. Who knows what it might hold. If the giant snake corpse at some distance from him was any indication then it was the best choice to stay still and not accidentally provoke danger.
Seeing such innocence, an inscrutable jumble rose in Blaise's eyes. He hesitated for a minute before slowly uttering, "About the several paramours….. It's not true. So you don't need to worry about it."
Neville didn't know why he was so angry. Maybe it was Blaise's act of lying to him or maybe it was the fact that Blaise had so many lovers that ignited this rare anger inside the soft-hearted and soft-mouthed Neville.
" You should thank me for my mercy. Afterall, No matter how many nights he spends with you, you are nothing but a plaything, only a toy for his boredom. While I am the future Lady Potter. Don't let me find out about this another time. A slap won't quench my anger then." She said while waving her assistant to cast a healing charm on Draco's cheek, leaving no traces of her visit, she never did.
Pansy made her way towards the shocked still Hermione. Her brows frowned as her lips repeatedly moved to utter words one after another. And it was as if Hermione's brain had shut down. She didn't hear or understand anything. She stood there, body still but eyes following the beauty, just like a sunflower stupidly following the sun.
When did their golden boy, their saviour, their beacon of light, their eternal hero turn into an absolute hooligan? Is this still their Saint Gryffindor? Has the end of time come so early ?
After some time , he said in a worried and shivering voice , " Oh my god ! My wife's all alone downstairs ! What do I do ?"
This time, Harry took his eyes from the ruins and looked into the glassy grey eyes. His voice unconsciously softened, leaving only affection and pampering from the previous sorrow and hatred, "Yeah, We will."
The man opened his eyes and leisurely smiled at Draco , even if it was slightly strained. He stood up and walked to Draco.
Hermione looked down at the curvy yet charming beauty who was eagerly looking up at her. She was so close, her plum chest only a hair's breadth away from Hermione's own. The heat she radiated as if scorched Hermione. A rush of electric and tingling buzz travelled down her entire body and embarrassment flooded her. She hurriedly averted her gaze.
And for once in his life , Ron used his brain! Note this time and date people ! We need to make this the International intellectuals day ! What was today's date anyway ? Ahh ... nevermind.
Gathering the egg into his ring, Draco tidied himself . Curious at the disappearance of the egg, Harry asked,
Couple of days passed and the Dursleys , who were frightened beyond recognition when they found out who was out to get the freak , quickly packed up and got ready to flee . In a single night , the house which was yesterday full and alive , now became empty and inhabited.
With this , Draco realised that it was indeed his responsibility as the descendant of Malfoys to help his own ancestor . Also , respected ancestor had helped him so much . The least he could do was to free the soul of his ancestor to join his beloved in the netherworld . And if they truly were in love then the soul of the beloved might be trapped somewhere as well . Maybe he could find it so that both of them could fulfill their last wish and depart to the land of souls together .
Looking into his eyes, Draco tsked with a sneer and cold fury in his eyes. He refused to answer and let Harry get what he wants.
Hermione answered simply, "It is. When I was reading it, I noticed a peculiar symbol on the front page. At first I thought that it was printed, but looking closer I realised that it was actually drawn by someone. I suspect that it might be a clue left for us by Dumbledore"
He watched as Draco's back arched in his arms, as tears spilled from the blushing ends of his eyes and as he choked on his own breath before going completely unconscious.
Harry was going to trap Draco to his side like a honey-bee trapped inside a greenhouse filled with blooming flowers.
Draco and Harry walked side by side to the edge of the forbidden forest . Both in their heads thinking what to do now.
Harry's eyes gleamed brilliance as his lips arched more and more . " I know. So relax. We will figure it out. "
At this, the death eater laughed out loud as well. He understood the implication clearly, "True , Heir Zabini. They taste the most delicious when-"
Roaming his eyes over the hall , Harry's eyes rested on Draco who was silently eating his food with bags beneath his eyes , looking a bit less perfect and bit more human .
She spoke softly , pleadingly ," Please don't . You belong here , with us . Don't you want to see your younger sister ? Please stay . Harry , you are my baby . How can I let you go ? Have I done something ? Has James done anything ? D-don't worry . We won't do it again . We-we will even repent it . Just tell us what happened. Don't just leave the house . "
Draco's lips turned into a scowl. Where was it Potter's business if he was hurt or not ? But He still gave a full body twirl, saying, "It hurts nowhere. I am fine"
"Right now, Professor Snape and Madame Pomfrey are still tending to him. The best time to break in would be at midnight but Professor Snape might still be there. The Dinner might be next best. We could cover up for you.", Her voice was serious and reply accurate to Harry's need.
Harry was enjoying the view. Malfoy, taking his cock, moving so gracefully with tears in his eyes. His pale neck marked with savage bites and purple bruises. He looked enchanting, angelic, so pure yet so filthy. Filthy with Harry's touch, with his essence, with his ownership.
Eyes still trained on Harry for any sign of falsehood , he asked , " Was there no other place in the mansion for him to sleep yesterday ?"
And with that, Harry struggled as hard as he could. He couldn't use wandless magic now. He can't let Nagini know. Because whatever Nagini knows, Voldemort knows as well. He can't give away his hidden ace card so easily.
, who, not so long ago, mused about what it might be like if Harry and Draco bickered/argued (thank you for inspiring me!). Now, I may or may not have something else in store for that particular trope, but I'm not going to give anything away just yet. You'll just have to wait and see.
Following an expert glance at the colour-coded whipped ends, Harry reached for a coil of rope with dark-blue whippings. 50ft of rope was precisely what he needed, and after weighing it in his hand, he brought it up to his nose and inhaled deeply, absorbing the scent of freshly sterilised rope. A smile spread all over his face and with the rope still firmly pressed against his face, he reached inside the cabinet to retrieve a pair of medical safety shears. He deposited them in the back pocket of his jeans, then closed the doors of the cabinet and turned around to face Draco.
He couldn’t help but wonder whether Kingsley ever struggled to allow those stiff words of praise pass his lips, but then he remembered that Kingsley had played the game for well over twenty years, first as an Auror in unpredictable times and then as Minister for Magic.
He knew exactly what she’d asked. He’d whispered the words often enough right before the commencement of a scene.
Harry snapped back into the present, rolled his eyes at his best friend, and took a rather large swig of beer.
With a nod, Draco pulled the chair out and seated himself, throwing one leg over the other to sit more comfortably.
Harry wasn’t sure why Draco, entirely out of the blue, was trying to change his mind, but the attempt lacked a certain kind of Malfoyesque persuasiveness and charm. It was a half-hearted ploy, nothing more and nothing less.
Draco had looked so thoroughly inviting that Harry had simply stripped naked and climbed into the bath with him. He hadn't even waited for an invitation. Once he’d settled behind Draco and pulled him into his arms, he’d proceeded to snog him senseless, and after their long bath, he’d been very tempted to take Draco up to the playroom but conscious of the fact that Draco had indulged in a large glass of red wine, he’d taken him to bed instead. Draco had been more than happy to remain naked and very willing to spend the evening snuggling in bed.
Roísín was younger than him and slightly shorter too. She was stunningly beautiful, with long dark-brown wavy hair and a smile that melted hearts. She was fiercely passionate about discovering her kinkier side, ridiculously smart and exceptionally well-read. Her family hailed from Ireland, but she’d spend most of her teenage and adult years in London. As such, she had a strange sort of accent. At times she sounded like she’d received elocution lessons to smooth out her strong Irish accent, and at other times she spoke like your typical Irish lass from Dublin’s northside.
He briefly thought about heading back to the Ministry to collect a couple of case files for his upcoming trial but dismissed the idea. He wasn’t in the mood for the detour. Work could wait until the morning. All he wanted was to go home; home to Harry. The prospect of that filled Draco with enormous anticipation. The butterflies in his stomach woke from their slumber and tentatively flexed their wings in silent approval of his decision.
“Alright, I’m going to be cheeky and go off-topic. Harry, if he tells you anything, I beg you, give me the recipe for that fish pie.”
Harry felt the sob that erupted from somewhere deep in the centre of Draco’s body long before he heard it because by the time it had fought its way to freedom it was more of a choked sniff than a proper sob.
Walking briskly, he hurried through the deserted park, eager to escape the unfriendly evening chill. This time of the year, London wasn’t very welcoming at all. It was dark, cold, and wet.
Teddy giggled between them and after kissing Draco, Harry held his godson’s face between his hands and kissed his forehead. Teddy squealed and wriggled, ducking away from the excessive amount of affection he was getting.
“Ngh, you’re perfect, my little prince, just perfect. You’re so good for me, letting me have you like this.”
“Draco knows perfectly well that I wouldn’t have sent out the engagement announcement before speaking to both of you first, but my son has always had a fondness for the theatrics. I’m not entirely sure where he gets it from though.”
“Oi, I take offence at that. I don’t have a scrawny arse. It’s very nicely-shaped, round and very firm.”
Harry scoffed but said nothing else and they walked in silence, exiting Hyde Park, and making their way directly towards Orchard Street. It was a warm and sunny day, and there wasn’t a cloud anywhere in sight. Even though it was only early spring, Draco was too warm and taking his luxurious grey knee-length Muggle wool/cashmere blend coat off, he casually draped it over his arm, and he and Harry continued walking.
To say that the last month and a half were a bit of a rollercoaster ride would be a grave understatement. It's been nothing short of insane. Writers are usually supposed to have all the words but this time, I have none to describe that it's been like to be forced to accept emergency expatriation from the country I've called my home for the past seven years. I've had to leave the majority of my belongings behind, hand my cat over to a friend, and leave with absolutely everything up in the air.
Somewhat tempted to place his index finger across Draco’s lips to silence him, Charlie shook his head.
Harry smiled, then dropped his hand down to Draco’s heart, pressing the palm of his hand firmly against his chest.
Draco buried his face against Harry’s bare neck and in response, Harry squeezed that little bit tighter and hummed softly.
Harry stubbornly pushed the silver metal box back towards Draco and earnt himself an icy death glare in response to his refusal.
Harry deliberately lowered his voice, infused it with warmth and gave it a husky undertone that had Draco shift on his piano stool. It was a small shove, almost unnoticeable, but Harry could hear the friction of Draco’s exquisite tailor-made black trousers rubbing against the stool’s smooth leather. Harry’s ears also picked up on the way Draco breathed; heavier and slightly more laboured as though he’d just walked up several flights of stairs, though, perhaps, not quite as obvious. His heart was most definitely beating faster, and when he spoke, his voice was softer and deeper, evidence of the fact that the muscles that controlled his vocal cords, had tightened up slightly.
His silvery-grey eyes were crystal-clear and shone with a kind of desire and longing, Harry usually only saw in them when they were alone at home or inside their playroom.
“Sure, you don’t, Draco. We both know that beneath all that icy shell you’ve got a warm heart full to the brim with love.”
“I know, but just remember that you’re still allowed to change your mind, even at the last minute. Despite your decision to take an active role in Caleb’s Mystery Speaker Event, we all know and respect the fact that you’re a private person.”
The expression on Scorpius face changed in an instant. It went from pouty and sulky to bright and excited. Draco couldn’t help but wonder whether it would always be this easy to please his son, but he highly doubted it. This childish innocence was bound to pale the older Scorpius got, and Draco dreaded the very idea of it. Perhaps it was his own stubbornness, but he wanted nothing more than for Scorpius to remain a child for as long as possible. He wanted him to be carefree, without worry, and playful. An ordinary child with a unique set of skills; that was the future Draco desired for his son. He wanted Scorpius to have the childhood he never had, and he wanted to voraciously live through him.
Draco stubbornly insisted on two long walks a day, one in the morning, after breakfast, and another one in the afternoon before they had tea together with Narcissa. Over the past few days, Draco had shown him several hidden gems, and with each walk they took, Harry became more and more convinced of the fact that he wasn’t at all familiar with the Manor’s massive grounds. Either that or things seemed to change at will and with time.
Neither Harry nor Draco decided to play by my rules and I misplaced my whip or I might have whipped both their arses black and blue -- next time I'll just grab a cane.
Harry opened his mouth with the very intention of contesting that accusation but decided against it at the last second. He didn’t have the energy to argue with Draco. That, and truth be told, Draco made sense. While Harry didn’t feel he had the mental strength to dissect this afternoon’s events in minute detail―which was usually what he and Draco did―he could see that they’d done an excellent job of working together as a team. There’s been no questioning, no second-guessing, nothing. There’s just been trust and a fluid progression of actions and reactions, both defensive and offensive in nature. Harry’s Auror brain wanted to do what he’d trained it to do, and that was to go over the day’s afternoon’s events, but a throbbing headache stopped him from going there.
Draco could feel Harry’s emerald eyes burn into his back but resisted the urge to turn around and look at Harry.
A tremor surged through him when Harry dragged his index finger down the length of his spine, then went back to admiring him from afar.
Despite all their bickering, despite the thousands of times Draco had driven him up the wall for a million different reasons, and even though he often struggled to read Draco, Harry couldn’t think of anyone else, besides perhaps Ron, he wanted to work with.
“I recommend Star Grass healing salve from the apothecary on Diagon Alley to heal the gigantic purple bruise you’ll undoubtedly have on your behind. Perhaps even a Pain-Numbing Potion or else you’ll never get through that stack of paperwork on your desk, Fernsby.”
“I’ll do it. A fortnight of wellness will do me a world of good. Especially if you’re planning to edge me repeatedly and we’ll be doing a roleplay scene.”
“No, Malfoy, I didn’t find a way to skirt around the rules. Not per se anyway. I went to Shacklebolt
In that regard, Harry knew his husband exceptionally well and trusted his instincts to be able to read and interpret his emotions accurately.
“Dominance in another person will call out to you ― and you will respond in a way that comes naturally. It’s not something that can be learnt, or faked ― it can be beaten into a person via abuse, or endured through sheer self-control, but not learnt. Submission will either come naturally ― because it makes you happy, it makes you wet, it excites the hell out of you ― or it won't. When a Dominant grabs you by the hair, you will fall to your knees because it seems the natural thing to do, because usually you’ve dreamt and fantasised about this for years, and because you want very badly to be on your knees with someone’s fist wrapped around a hank of your hair.”
Instead, he made it his mission to kiss every inch of Draco’s body, and by every inch, he literally meant every inch. He started out at Draco’s neck, worked his way along Draco’s shoulder, along his arms, then down again, all over his chest, and across his quivering stomach.
“The Triwizard Tournament at Hogwarts. My boss put me in charge of leading the convoy. At first, I didn’t feel up to the task, even tried to get out of it, but it didn’t take long for me really get into it, because, damnit, I was working with dragons, doing what I love. I focused on the job and when you’re handling four extremely temperamental female dragons, and one of them is a Hungarian Horntail, you really don’t have much time to focus on your mental state. At the time, it was what I needed, although after it was all over, Caleb insisted that I stay with him for a bit and he and I talked a lot about the scene and my feelings. He helped me to understand myself, stop thinking of myself as a monster and accept that I’d done nothing wrong. Incidentally, that girl was also the last woman I ever dated. After really pouring my heart out to Caleb, I finally settled on playing for my own team.”
Overcome by a sudden coughing fit, Draco paused again, braced himself on his desk and lowered his head. He attempted to reach for his water but missed and promptly sent the glass sailing to the ground.
So, instead of making fun of Malcolm’s overly sentimental words, he merely smiled and decided to share a little secret with his ex-boyfriend.
Thankfully, they seem rather excited about joining him in the shop and as they make their way downstairs―Harry leaves the door to his flat unlocked and ajar in case Walter wants to go―he hands out little tasks. Rose is responsible for turning on the lights, and Hugo wants to adjust the sign at the door that tells customers that Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes is open for business.
In Draco’s current state, Harry didn’t think he was even able to concentrate for long enough to be able to see clearly and make sense of what was going on around him.
He carried his precious little prince out of the cell, and through the very realistic replica of his office, then strode down the corridor and descended one flight of stairs down to the third floor of his and Draco’s home. Like he’d done so many times before, Harry carried Draco straight into their bedroom and gently placed him on top of their bed.
“My version of the events is relatively straightforward, and I’d be happy to provide Pensieve proof. Senior Auror Watkins flagged the case to me, and after a short perusal of Auror Rowan’s case notes and Auror Watkins cold case file, I deemed it necessary to check out Reginald Warrenforth’s shop. Upon my arrival Mr Warrenforth was extremely hostile, insulted me personally and drew his wand to attack one of my Aurors. I persuaded him, with the assistance of a spell or two, to join me for an informal chat at the Ministry while my team of Aurors turned his shop upside down and unearthed rather worrying evidence of several other crimes.
There was a bit of a bite to his voice, but all things considered, Harry had to applaud him for his ability to control his temper.
Draco breathed his response into the small space between them and chuckling softly, Harry kissed him deeply, claiming his mouth and lips in a way he knew would rob Draco of every single coherent thought he’d ever had.
Draco snapped out of his reverie and dragging his eyes away from the paper, he looked at Scorpius and smiled apologetically.
Hira turned his back on him, revealing a light-blue Kippah with a white Star of David embroidered in its centre, and pulled a narrow and long box from one of the upper shelves in front of him. Harry shook his head. He didn’t think he’d ever get used to Hira’s oddities, but Caleb had recommended him, and Reid was never wrong about the people he associated with.
The first time he’d likened Scorp, Al, James and Lily to different types of coffee, Harry hadn’t been able to stop laughing. He’d laughed so hard that he’d doubled over at the breakfast table, holding on to his sides as he’d laughed and snorted and laughed some more. Eventually, he’d slid off his chair and ended up on the floor, though instead of feeling embarrassed about that, he’d simply remained there and continued laughing.
The questioned earned him a cold and deathly glower from Ron, who pushed his stool back and crossed his arms over his chest.
Shuffling, he tossed the remainder of his apple into the wastebasket and washed his hands in the kitchen sink. After drying them with a single-use towel, he defiantly crossed them over his chest.
I know someone I heart an awful lot is probably going to have a good long giggle over the title of this chapter (Happy Oct. 7th, my love!) and I'm not even going to attempt to try and explain it to the rest of you lovely people, I could not, it wouldn't make sense, because I’m not even sure it makes sense to me.
He continues walking, and once he and Walter reappear beside the joke shop, Harry gives him a choice ― they’re either going to return home or head out into Muggle London. He knows what Walter’s choice is before he’s even finished his sentence because his crup makes a mad dash for The Leaky Cauldron. The opportunity to chase Muggles while Harry searches for more coffee clearly appeals, and Harry doesn’t fault him for that. Thankfully, he manages to catch Walter before he disappears inside the pub and it is with practised ease that he connects the leash to Walter’s silver collar.
The moment the shirt was free, it slipped off Draco’s shoulders and pooled at his wrists. Harry took it from there and removed it, then loosely closed his fingers around Draco’s wrist. Draco felt the familiar pressure of Harry’s thumbs against the pulse point on the inside of his wrist and sighed contently.
“You say that now. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I better head inside and grovel at my boyfriend’s feet, begging for forgiveness.”
He huffed out a breath of air and forced himself to stop digging his fingernails into his palms. It really hurt, and it wasn’t the kind of pleasurable pain that resulted in an intense high.
After Harry had stopped him from panicking for the sake of panicking, giving Roísín a peek into Harry’s and his dynamic had been surprisingly easy. While Draco still felt that he was allowing Roísín to witness something incredibly intimate, he no longer worried about it but wholeheartedly embraced it, and he recalled Harry’s earlier words to him.
There was no way Arthur Weasley was going to try and convince his wife that throwing an engagement party for him and Draco was a horrible idea.
“You know, Potter, instead of hanging around the bar, being mopey and feeling sorry for yourself, all you really have to do is smile and pretend that you’re enjoying these celebrations. It’s not that hard.”
Harry then let go of his chin and brought the cane up to about chest height, inspecting it carefully and thoroughly. He let his fingers glide over the smooth material, then gripped the handle and whooshed it through the air.
Given their relationship and their mutual preference for a less than average set of power dynamics, the sound of Harry's voice connected with Draco on a different level, especially whenever Harry made a request
The offer of a cuddle, especially post-play and no matter how long or short said playtime had been, always excited Draco.
They slid up his chest, edging closer and closer to his shoulders, and keeping his eyes closed and his head lowered, Draco revelled in the sensation of Harry’s touch.
After a while, he lay down and pulled Draco into his embrace. He then instinctively wrapped his arms around his little prince. Draco curled into him, buried his face in his t-shirt and hummed softly, then chuckled quietly.
It still looked just as gorgeous and shiny as the day Caleb had fastened it around Stefan’s neck. There was not a single scratch mark on it. It was the perfect evidence of how much Stefan treasured Caleb’s gift and what their bond meant to him.
He pulled Draco that little bit closer, allowed his possessive nature to guide him into deepening the kiss and slowly slithering his tongue past Draco’s slightly parted lips, he sought out Draco’s tongue and wound his own around it.
When he finally did, he denied Draco, then kissed his cheek and marked his other shoulder with a rather prominent bite mark.
It roused the part inside of Draco that didn’t want to resist, the one that found freedom in his surrender.
Insistent, Harry used his tongue to pry Draco’s slightly shaking lips apart, slithered inside the warm wet haven that was the inside of Draco’s mouth, and delighted in the way his little prince tremored in his embrace, evoking his desire to take things further still.
Acutely aware, and feeling thoroughly alive, Draco instinctively became mindful of the fact that it wouldn’t take much before that small orb of pure and raw energy decided to transform itself into a spark.
Once inside, Harry stopped for a while and took in the scene that presented itself to him. Narcissa and Andromeda were sharing a chaise, and although there was a bit of a gap between them, they were amicably chatting over a book, Narcissa held in her hands. Harry was well aware of the fact that Andromeda and Narcissa were making every effort to build bridges and work out their past issues, but to see them together like this, conversing and sharing stories, took a moment to absorb.
“Do it, my love,” he said, then slipped his hand into Draco’s and squeezed it softly. “Come on, I’ll take you back and wait until you’re ready to step onto the stage before I take my seat in the front row.”
Harry reached out and brushed a stray strand of hair out of Draco’s face. He let his hand rest on the side of Draco’s neck and using his fingertips, he located Draco’s left jugular vein. Applying a tiny bit of pressure allowed him to feel the steady pulsing flow of blood against his skin, and gently caressing Draco’s jawline, he leant in and pressed a tender kiss to Draco’s pale-pink lips.
“You wish, my sweet little prince, you wish,” he said and holding Draco’s gaze, he dared him to disagree.
As Draco fell silent, he watched Harry’s eyes fill with tears. They spilled over the rim of his eyes and silently rolled down his heavily stubbly cheeks, and even though he tried to blink to keep them at bay, said action only resulted in another swell of tears staining his bearded face.
He shuddered at the intensity of it all and cupping Draco’s cheek; he pressed his thumb against Draco’s lips.
After brunch, and because they’d all felt way too full to remain sedentary, they’d strolled down Portobello Road, past the long line of colourful market stalls and various artfully decorated shopping window displays.
Harry’s eyes widened, and he automatically reached out to try and snatch the potion phial from Draco’s hand, but Draco was faster and moved the phial out of his reach.
Draco watched him for a while, then turned his attention back to his work and skimmed over several extremely dry and overly wordy interrogation reports. They were so dull that Draco’s eyes started to feel heavy, and yawning, he resolutely dragged himself into the kitchen to brew a fresh batch of coffee.
“While that would be the easiest way to avoid confrontation, it doesn’t solve anything, does it now? I want Draco to feel like he can talk to me about anything. With me, he doesn’t need to limit himself to only telling me about the good stuff, because I want to know it all. There’s a time to thrive on praise, and there’s a time to be responsible and get your act together.”
, Harry thought to himself, not even in the slightest bit embarrassed about his maudlin thoughts. Draco occasionally had that effect on him and ignoring his feelings wasn’t something Harry was accustomed to. He felt. Switching his emotions off wasn’t something he knew how to do, nor was it something he was interested in exploring.
As if the stone had been able to read Draco’s thoughts and feel his quiet reverence, the obsidian’s jet-black glassy outside shimmered underneath the bright light of the magical light floating just above Draco’s head. The abundance of the stone’s closely-spaced crystallites ensured that it was perfectly opaque and the spherical clusters of radially arranged, needle-like crystals only served to add to the stone’s shine. It was quite a piece of perfection.
If he was, Harry didn’t want to ruin the surprise for him by making it obvious that he was on to Draco.
Draco let out a soft whimper, and Harry felt him obey. He kept his hand over Draco’s eyes, reached for his rope kit and pulled a black blindfold out of the bag. It was made of pure silk and incredibly soft to the touch. He carefully placed it over Draco’s closed eyes, adjusted it ever so slightly, then tied it at the back, and kissed Draco’s cheek.
He traced Draco’s deep pink lips with his index finger, then kissed him deeply, slithering his tongue through the slight gap between Draco’s lips to seek out the wet, warm cavern hidden behind. He explored it with wild abandon and toyed with Draco’s tongue, gently massaging it with his own.
A change of subject always worked, especially when you were a lawyer. It generally confused the hell out of people and made them assume he had a hidden agenda when, really, you most definitely did not.
“Now shoo, I’ve got work to do and orders to prepare. Make sure you stop by that place tomorrow and pick up the tart. I’ve already owled to order. It’s under my name, but they know someone else will stop by to pick it up. Bring it here afterwards, and I’ll prepare it, then take it home before dinner.”
Draco paused once more. An avalanche of memories rushed through his brain, and the more he allowed them to run rampant, the more he could feel his eyes well up. They burned with unshed tears and feeling emotional, he trembled slightly.
He whispered his soft-spoken demand against Harry’s smooth lips, positively delighting in his rough stubble.
The harness smoothly moved with him, and Draco felt the tips of his fingers itch. He desperately wanted to touch the rope that so snuggly sat at the back of his neck, and it cost him every ounce of self-control to resist the temptation.
It sent a wave of arousal through Harry, and he shifted in his armchair, all the while relishing in the exquisite sensations rushing through his body. He loved this, the initial thrill, the slow-rising anticipation of what might or might not come as a plan started to form in his mind, growing from an abstract idea into something a little more concrete.
Draco thought for a moment, gathered his thoughts, and sorted through his feelings, then took a deep breath.
Molly had, of course, put up a massive fight about having such an extravagant party, but Harry and the rest of the family, including Andromeda, had overruled her reasonably quickly. According to Arthur, that in itself was a historical family event, and Harry still chuckled every time he recalled the murderous glower Molly had given her husband from across the room. Usually, it was her who made the rules and told everyone what needed to be done, but just this once they’d rallied together to get her to back down.
After that, Harry had changed his mind. To the degree that he’d actually toyed with the idea to switch plates with Draco.
Harry squeezed his eyes closed, inhaled deeply and smiled as Draco’s scent contributed to his headiness. He groaned into Draco’s damp skin, moaning loudly and pressing his lips to the soft flesh, he felt his orgasm break free as he filled Draco with streak after streak of hot white come.
It took Draco the longest time to find the will to break away from their kiss, and once he’d finally gathered up the necessary energy to do so, Harry and he were both thoroughly breathless with flushed cheeks and slick, swollen lips. Panting hard, Draco stared at Harry, mesmerised and as though they hadn’t done this, share an intimate kiss, a thousand times before.
It took him a moment to fully adjust, but as his vision sharpened, his bleary sleep-laden eyes instantly focused on the two packed suitcases that stood near the bedroom door.
Twice for acceptance, for everything that made him Harry from his love for Draco to his unique self and style.
The boys took the quickest route to their dorm. Once they were in, Harry made sure the doors were sealed shut. Draco let out a storm of curses as he dug through the drawers for clothes.
His father crumbled to the ground, cries of pure anguish bellowing from his mouth as he cradled his broken wrist.
It must have been hours-long, slow, painful hours before Nisa was able to pull her flushed, sweaty face away from the toilet seat and sent the disgusting load down with a flush. On shaky feet, she peeled herself off the floor and walked out.
The wind blew in a gentle breeze that caressed her cheeks, her nose, invisible fingers running through her hair. She could have heard that she heard just the softest trickle of laughter.
"I swear, Professor, this isn't my fault. I did everything the book said. I followed all the instructions."
Pansy was just as desperate, just as determined. She threw her leg over him and climbed on top, straddling his waist. Draco's hands landed on her waist, going here and there, her breasts, her waist again, her back. Pansy's hands were doing their own exploring, falling onto his shirt, pulling apart the rest of his buttons. Their lips were pressed so hard together; Draco could feel his teeth bending.
"W-what…what…" It was like all the heat transferred from the room to his cheeks, burning them up. "What made you realize that Remus was the one?"
They talked for a few more minutes before Sirius had to go, ending their chat with a harebrained comment that had Harry laughing long after the flames were gone.
"I only have three distinct memories. Warms beds and stories and hot chocolate from the orphanage that was the closest thing I had to a home for the first six years of my life. A year spent in hell, being broken repeatedly by a deeply sick bastard before being lorded over by another sick bastard who was twice as disturbed and got off on hurting small kids. Spending one miserable day after another in a ship with other kids who were broken just like me, being traded and sold off like cattle to more sick fucks."
There was something in her voice that made Harry look up, the spark glinting in her eyes reminding him of the questions he had and the answers she might be able to provide.
Draco had no idea how long he was staring until it occurred to him his name was being called for the third time in a row. His eyes were still watching the boy's pink lips. "Huh? What?"
Harry didn't know which ones fell harder: the glass that slipped from his hand or his stomach that fell all the way down to his toes.
A wolfish gleam sparked in those emerald eyes, one that made his skin tingle in anticipation, as Harry unzipped his pants and pushed them down to his ankles, along with his boxers. "Maybe that can be your Christmas present."
"I see," Dumbledore turned over to the Potions master, who stared back at him, his facial expression unreadable, then over to the boys. "Would you boys mind stepping outside while we talk for a bit?"
First year definitely wasn't how Draco imagined, but at least it ended off on a good note with Slytherin winning the House Cup. Again.
Then there were pictures that made him stop and stare, taking in details. Like his dad trying to steal kiss from Mum and her pushing him away with a grin. Him, Sirius, and Remus out in the snow, initiating a kicking chorus line. A picture taken at their wedding of them sharing their first dance, looking at each other with such love in their eyes like there was nothing else they'd rather see.
It was still early in the morning, so there weren't too many people in the hallway or the common room. There were less people out in the halls. Draco and Harry made their way through the halls and staircases up to the music room that was closer to the Ravenclaw's tower. It was one of his favorite rooms in the castle.
Dumbledore held Harry's gaze for a few seconds, and then said, "That, Harry, is a matter between Professor Snape and myself."
It took Severus a minute for Severus to reappear with a special tea for him and green tea for Draco. Draco, during that time, stared down at his hands that were tightly wringed.
He smiled. It was the type of smile he had seen adults used when they were dealing with a difficult child. The type of smile Draco hated. "Simply a chat. Boring adult stuff. Nothing that would interest you."
"Voldemort gave him a warning. He said 'You are hanging by a very thin thread. Ensure that it doesn't snap.' The man bowed his head and then-" Harry swallowed again. "But when he did that, some of his hair that must have been tied back slipped out. Pale white blonde hair."
His composure completely broke apart when he felt the skirts of his dress pushed up to his waist. Right before he felt something tender and hot plunge into him.
Giggles fluttered from her mouth. "I think not, Potter. I didn't go through all the trouble of dolling myself up not to be the belle of the ball."
FREEDOM. FREEEEEEEEDOM. Finally did my last test. I am free. I am happy. I am tired but mostly happy, thank God
The fire in his stomach changed from a slow shimmer to a tight coil rattling his insides. The last time Draco looked at him like that-
The thought made a lot more sense in Draco's head than it did out loud. Out loud, they sounded awful. Ridiculous. They sounded ten times worse coming from Harry's mouth.
Regret twisted in his chest. He should have known better on how Draco would have handled the truth. He should have trusted him more. Have more faith in his friend. "I'm sorry," he said for what was probably the hundredth time that night. He could say it a hundred, a thousand times more, and it still wouldn't be enough. Not to him.
To Mother, he answered, "I thought I'd surprise you by coming to the villa so we'd all go to the platform together. Last I checked that wasn't exactly a crime, Narcissa."
The dance lesson wasn't as horrible as Harry thought it would be. Theo and Pansy's waltzes with Severus would forever be a hilarious memory he'd treasure forever, saving it for gloomy days. Blaise was a nut, but gave him good pointers during their dance, gently reminding Harry to relax and not think too hard about his steps. The only foul thing about the lesson was it increased Pansy's obsession of the ball and his lack of date.
"Same," Harry agreed, then when he saw Draco's risen brow, explained, "I already had enough excitement last year. This year I just want to relax."
"Come on, guys. Let's not fight," Harry said, always the peace-maker. "Blaise, you do not want to get on a sleep-deprived, crabby Draco on your tail. It will
He got a small smile in return, one that widened as Draco linked his arm through his as they continued with their walk, both with their heads held high.
Realization jabbed into him like a poisoned dagger, the venom spreading through his veins. "That's how you knew."
By noon pretty much everyone-and to Draco's great embarrassment he did mean everyone-knew about what happened between him, Pansy, and Theo after the ball. That was one of the many, many flaws about the school: secrets were only an illusion. There was no such thing in the school with its thousand-and-one ears listening closely, loose-lipped students who blurted out information at the drop of a hat, mindless professor who didn't understand the meaning of confidentiality busy-body ghosts craving gossip like it was their lifeline. Once a secret was out, the whole school knew about it in an hour. Then added their own twists to the story an hour after that.
Harry closed the oven door and began to tidy, whistling as he did the washing up. It was a beautiful kitchen, spacious and clean, by far his favourite room in their flat—aside from the bedroom. He’d been forced to cook as a child, and not allowed to cook when he’d served as Dudley’s replacement. This was the first time in Harry’s life he was finally free to do as he pleased, and it pleased him very much to try something new each day. He spent hours creating sumptuous entrees, delectable puddings, and even spicy owl treats for Artemis. Today, it was cranberry orange scones.
Draco gasped in disbelief. The Elder Wand, the Deathstick, was real. Hermione Granger was the owner of the most powerful and feared wand in all of history!
. I’ve seen you before. At King’s Cross Station, at the”—she looked over her shoulder to ensure they were still alone—“barrier to the
Venom dripped down its pincers, menacing as they grew closer. Harry’s heart thudded in his chest as he tried to back up, but his feet remained rooted to the spot. The monstrous spider exhaled against Harry’s face; a putrid odour wafting from its cavernous maw—the remains of its last meal. Scuttling sounds came from all directions as more spiders closed in.
Except Harry’s eyes were directed at him, so vibrant and intensely green. When he smiled, his dimple appeared—Draco had never seen it this close—and Draco’s insides melted. And then Harry was leaning forward, his palm resting against Draco’s jaw, and he brushed their lips together. They were kissing—he was kissing Harry Potter! And then he wasn’t. Harry had pulled back, face perplexed and nervous, and Draco realised in his initial shock at being kissed he had not kissed back, had simply remained still and in awe. He quickly remedied his mistake, surging forward and chasing down Harry’s lips, pleased with the soft sigh that escaped those perfect lips as they parted, allowing him entrance. Harry tasted of cigarettes and treacle, and smelled of citrus and sandalwood, a heady combination that made Draco’s head swim and insides combust. Harry sucked Draco’s bottom lip into his mouth and gave it a playful nip; Draco trembled.
Harry and Hermione make their way back to their seats. Malfoy hasn’t moved an inch, but Harry thinks he sees a slight smirk on his face. He must have imagined it though because when he looks again, it’s gone.
” Draco shouted. He hurriedly checked Harry for a pulse—there wasn’t one. Draco’s mind and body worked automatically, recalling the techniques he’d recently read about. He administered thirty chest compressions, then tilted Harry’s head back and delivered two powerful breaths. Thirty more chest compressions, two more breaths.
Draco leaned forward and brought his hand up to Harry’s forehead. He gently massaged circles into Harry’s brow, and Harry smiled. “That’s better. This is probably going to sound strange, but I feel different when I’m with you.” Harry pulled back and fished a pack of cigarettes from his pocket. He lit one, then inhaled deeply and let the smoke waft from his mouth. “It started the moment I first saw you. It’s like, the past few months, nothing concrete has come back to me. There have been a few flashes, but they’ve all proven false. But with you”—he took another drag—“it’s hard to describe the feeling, but you feel familiar. It’s like when you know the word for something, and it’s on the tip of your tongue, but you just can’t remember it. Are you sure we weren’t friends?”
Harry had visited Draco at work on Friday—Jess had given Draco a knowing wink when she saw them coming out of the loo red-faced and sweaty. They’d gone out for pints with his coworkers. Draco only had one, then he’d driven Harry home. But he wished he could have brought Harry back to his flat instead. Petunia, however, was expecting him.
“My, my, is it just me or does Santa look extra hot this year?” Goldstein says loudly and whistles, earning him a glare from Hermione.
Harry slept peacefully beside him—thank Merlin for small mercies. The sky was inky-black, and Draco wondered what time it was. His alarm clock levitated above his bureau—it was 4 am. When Draco realised the clock was hovering midair, he panicked, and it came crashing down. Harry stirred beside him. Draco gently shushed him, running his fingers through his hair, and Harry settled back into sleep. Draco sighed. The evidence from their earlier activities had now dried on their stomachs, and Draco thought a Scouring Charm would be useful. No sooner had he thought of it, they were both clean.
