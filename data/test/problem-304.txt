"Maybe he's gay?" Zach suggested, shrugging at her.
"Abbott." Draco was gritting his teeth as he called the drunken girl's attention in a flat tone of voice.
Just as Draco pulled away and was about to return his attention to Aria's mouth, the loud sound of a door violently slamming shut startled them both, and they pulled away from each other in alarm. Glancing across the room, they stared in confusion at the kitchen doors which, Draco distinctly remembered, had been wide open just a few minutes ago.
"You can't perform magic inside commercial establishments, Potter." Morag reminded her in an obnoxious tone of voice and with a firm shake of her head. "They'll kick us out if you do."
Blaise turned to the blonde girl still standing by the window.
now as she began rifling through her bag for her wand. "Aren't you going to do something, Hannah?! That good-for-nothing wanker cannot treat you this way! In fact, I'm going to go over there and hex his balls off myself—"
Instead of answering, Draco only looked amused at her reaction and he went on.
"Shut up!"
"Sorry."
" Aria wrapped her blanket tighter around herself and tried not to squirm under Hermione's teasing gaze. "He likes
She paused just then and stared up at him with wide eyes. Draco just stared back at her, meeting her questioning gaze with a very heated look.
"Leave him alone?! He's practically cheating on you in full view of everyone in the Great Hall!" Pansy snapped at her, glaring at the smaller girl in outrage. "Are you seriously just going to sit here and let him get away with that?!" She demanded.
"What do you mean?" He asked.
"Consider it a peace offering. For…You know. That horrible thing I said about you yesterday." Neville looked down and took a long, shaky inhale of breath before lifting his gaze again and giving Pansy a small, shy smile. "I didn't mean any of it, okay? I
"Aria, wait."
At Aria's words, the self-satisfied smile on Morag's face grew.
"Why didn't you tell her off?" He asked in a deceptively calm voice.
Pansy looked a little panicked as she turned to Draco and tugged frantically on the sleeve of his robe. She waited until Potter and her friends had looked away from them before she eyed their robes again in dismay. "I don't want to share a dormitory with
"So…"
"Why are you two just standing around here and talking?" Blaise smirked when Draco just growled at him and finally managed to shrug his arm off. "It's a party, for crying out loud. You should be drinking and dancing."
She used their momentary distraction to place a firm, gloved hand on both boys' chests, pushing them a good distance away from the other. However, just as she was going to pull her hand away, Bentley suddenly reached out and snatched tightly at her wrist, instantly causing Aria to stiffen and turn around slowly to face him.
had been fairly surprised when she learned that Hannah Abbott, a girl that had a reputation of being the friendliest and most amiable girl in
"Ignore him, Aria." Hannah reached over and gently brushed her hair away from her face. "Seriously, though. Are you okay? I heard about what happened at the Ball. That must have been terrible."
the same question." Blaise looked amused as he studied Draco's expression, noting the dazed look that continued to linger on his face. "Are you okay? You look like somebody just told you that you were adopted and that your real parents were actually trolls." He snickered.
"I heard she has an invitation to join the Holyhead Harpies." Aria mentioned.
"Aria." He growled warningly, leveling her with an impatient glare.
She giggled at his deadpan expression and folded her hands coyly behind her, tilting her head up so she could look into his eyes. "But really, thank you for meeting with me tonight, Draco. And thank you for being so honest with me. It was…
Astoria was biting her lip and wringing her hands together, blushing at the inquisitive stares she was receiving from the rest of the Slytherins around the table.
Blaise waved lazily at him and walked off, leaving Draco alone to his thoughts once more.
"Um…Harriah? Can I take the bed beside yours, please?" She asked meekly, blushing when Aria's initial reaction was to pause in mid-stride and give her a blank stare.
"Do you want to start heading back now?" She asked quietly. "I think we've gathered enough ingredients anyway."
Then, her lips tugged upwards into a smirk as she stepped in front of Neville and expertly readied herself into an offensive dueling stance that matched his. No other words were spoken as the two former Gryffindors immediately snapped into action, slashing the air and firing and exchanging offensive spells at each other back and forth.
"I think I really do."
"You saw her?" Draco asked, arching an eyebrow at him in question.
" Draco seethed, cursing as he struggled to untangle himself from the other two.
Not surprisingly, the blonde was now decked out in a full Gryffindor uniform, complete with a matching scarf. When Aria raised an eyebrow at her in question, Luna answered her with a smile. "Oh, the Headmistress already resorted all of 7th years before you arrived. I'm in Gryffindor now, see?" She twirled around, proudly showing off the red and gold on her robes. "We had quite a lot of surprises too, actually. A number of Slytherins in my year got resorted into Hufflepuff and Gryffindor." She told them.
"Oh come on, Pans. You know I didn't mean any of that." Corner cajoled in a sickeningly sweet tone of voice as he pulled her close, wrapping an arm around her waist. "I'm actually here because I wanted to tell you that I want you back. I'm
Pansy's loud, obnoxious voice grated on his nerves as he grit his teeth and reluctantly followed her into the small classroom at the end of the east wing hallway.
Blaise's eyes grew ridiculously wide at her words. "You actually suspected me?!" He blurted out, looking slightly offended as he glared at her. "And here I thought we had such a connection going here, Potter!" He added, scowling at her and letting out a dramatic huff.
(and this was the one that pissed Draco off the most), Zach had turned into a pathetic, jittery mess of nerves the moment the game started. And this time, his performance was far

"Potter, I do believe you've made your point." McGonagall answered wryly, shaking her head. "I shall relay your words to the school board tomorrow about Mister Parkinson's expulsion."
purse anyway,
To aid with that, especially given that there was an unusually high number of students in Hogwarts that year because of the return of the 8th years, McGonagall would be assigning students to assist with some chores from time to time. She went on to explain how the chores would mostly be simple but varied, ranging from cleaning a few classrooms, maintaining the grounds, or even helping the house elves clean up the kitchens.
It came in the mail for you this morning while you were getting ready for the game." She told him with a sly smile.
He leaned back shakily against his seat.
"Every.
Ron frowned at her in confusion. "Why would he think that—"
. These are the ones you normally read about in a lot of muggle literature. Rogues are the ones who became a vampire because they were infected from the bite of another."
"Well, how was
Five years ago, if someone had told Aria that she'd be strolling down a quaint muggle neighborhood in London, hand-in-hand with
Aria's lips twitched at that but she pretended as though she hadn't heard him. "Then we'd better get started on this if we want to finish on time. Are you coming with us, Hagrid?"
and sank down lower in his seat, forcing himself to tune out the rest of their inane argument. He ignored the way Pansy's voice began to grow shrill at another one of Neville's biting remarks and directed his attention to the front of the room again, watching as Aria and Granger shared another laugh over something the brunette had said.
"Everything okay, Aria?" Hannah asked as she glanced at Aria over her shoulder and gave her a look of concern. "You don't usually look so tired and ruffled. Have you been getting enough sleep?"
"Why the hell does
Zach seemed to seriously consider her question. He paused in the middle of his breakfast and stroked his chin in thought. "Maybe you could try showing more skin the next time you go out on a date? And…I don't know, maybe dress yourself up more? Try to make it obvious to that boyfriend of yours that you're spending more time on your appearance for him. Oh, and
– back when she had slipped from the owlery steps and the blond twat had unwittingly grasped the bare skin of arm, nearly sending her into a hormonal frenzy. In fact, if Aria were to go by pure compatibility alone (based on both scent and touch), all of her so-called mating instincts were screaming at her that Draco was her most compatible choice.
As always, reviews, comments and kudos are love! Hope you all stay with me for the final update! :D
"You're right, it
"Because I didn't want you to think that this was all because of that!" Aria blurted out, her voice growing louder and sounding choked with emotion. "I didn't want you to think that my being a veela is in any way related to how I feel about you! Or about
Without turning around, McGonagall waved her wand once and folded her hands behind her back, waiting patiently as a single piece of chalk floated into the air and began spelling out the name of the class on the board.
okay, Potter." Was all Draco managed to hiss back, glaring at her as if everything was somehow her fault.
"What?! Honestly, Potter. She won't learn anything if we keep babying her all the damn time. She has to learn to stand up for herself!" Pansy pointed out, rolling her eyes.
"Ugh. I don't know
In all honesty, he still had absolutely no idea how he should be feeling about all this; especially
"Selfish, right?"
"Why are you out here by yourself?" He asked quietly, sliding an arm around her waist and drawing her closer against him. "It's bloody freezing."
The situation was beginning to bother her, but she wasn't sure enough about her suspicions to relay her concerns to Hermione or Ron just yet. All Aria knew was that something in her gut was telling her that these vandalism incidents, whoever was behind them, were somehow connected to her; as though trying to tell her something.
Draco immediately scowled at him and tightened his grip around her in response. "Get off, Weasley—"
Headmistress, I don't believe that—"
To her surprise, as she and Goyle began making good progress with their Draught of Peace, Aria realized that what Hermione and Ginny had told them about Goyle was true – the former Slytherin
desperate for a good grade?!" Pansy was screeching at Blaise, her face twisted into a disgruntled expression.
"That's a very interesting ring, Malfoy." She mused.
Draco studied her expression closely, drawn in by her cryptic words.
"I—I don't even know either, 'Mione!" Aria managed to wheeze out in between her hysterical laughter as she bent over and clutched at her stomach. "But this whole situation, i—it's just…
It was Aria in her true form who stood in front of him.
to it; and since you're obviously not going to, then we can just forget about this whole thing!"
"And these wings are exactly the focus of the topics I shall be discussing with you this afternoon. It is quite an extensive lesson, the importance of a veela's wings; so it is crucial that all of you understand everything I will tell you today."
He closed his eyes and reached up, pinching the bridge of his nose in exhaustion. When he came to a few seconds later, the initial anger in his expression was gone and in its place was an exasperated grimace.
"I never got to ask — who are
After another few minutes of peaceful silence and nothing else but the sound of Hermione's quill scratching busily against her parchment, Ron spoke up again, drawing his two best friends' attention back to him.
She interrupted herself with a sharp gasp when Neville, who up until that point had been walking a few meters ahead of them, suddenly groaned and stumbled clumsily to the ground.
At the soft, comforting tone of Narcissa's voice, Draco swallowed the lump in his throat and forced himself to speak.
Pansy looked stunned when she realized that Aria had actually sided with her.

"Argh!"
now. Are you honestly going to tell me that you didn't notice anything?" He asked bluntly.
"Aren't there any laws in place to protect against this sort of abuse from happening? Or laws in general to protect veelas from being abused?" He asked.
This was his life now; and he couldn't be happier.
"I'm being serious right now, Potter." Draco looked annoyed at her reaction, sighing again before he turned to face her fully. "Look, all I'm trying to say is…If you…Well, if you're angry about what happened back there and you'd rather that things between us stay the way they are, then I'll understand." He broke himself off and Aria's eyes softened when she saw the insecure expression on his face.
Afterwards, when no one seemed incline to follow Blaise's example, he glanced at Aria from the corner of his eye, nudging her insistently until she growled and swatted his hand away.
Even before McGonagall had finished her thorough explanation, something inside her told her that she already knew
"Another interesting question, Hermione. And the answer is, they
we're here to take you to dinner."
But, as Draco smiled and carefully reached his hand inside his coat, clasping his fingers tightly around the small velvet box in his pocket, he reminded himself that there was a better time and place to tell her all that.
Aria spoke in a teasing voice, but there was a strange anxiousness and vulnerability in her expression that Draco recognized — even without having to feel it through their mate bond. And after being together for two years, Draco knew Aria well enough by now that he understood exactly where her fears were coming from.
"Harriah Potter and Neville Longbottom are in

which house that blasted hat had resorted her into.
Sneering, Draco stuck his foot out just as the smaller boy tried to step over him, causing the Gryffindor to curse as he tripped and fell back down to the grass a few inches away from Aria. As Bentley growled and struggled to stand up, he glanced at Aria again – and the angle was perfect enough that Draco was sure the Gryffindor managed to catch a quick glimpse of the symbols on the back of her neck.
And he was
Ignoring the way Narcissa and Andromeda both giggled at Teddy's outburst, Draco closed his eyes, took a deep inhale of breath and finally ripped the envelope open. As he scanned hastily through its contents, he noticed how all three of the women beside him
"Her hair is longer but I didn't really notice anything else." Greg offered with a nonchalant shrug, causing Draco to divert his attention to him.
When Draco finally made it to the Slytherin Table, he lowered himself into the seat between Blaise and Zach. He ignored their murmured greetings and wordlessly began pouring himself a cup of strong, caffeinated tea. As he lifted the cup to his lips, his gaze swept briefly over all of the house-elves who were scurrying about around them, every single one of them busy with trying to reconstruct the Great Hall.
"Speaking of Zach, where is that bloody tosser anyway?" Draco growled, looking up and searching the Great Hall with a scowl on his face. "We're supposed to be at the pitch in ten minutes."
"Are you sure?" Draco asked.

Would she transform into her true form in front of him?

"That's easy for you to say, isn't it? If I recall, you had no affiliation with
"It's not what he's making it sound like! Aria, I swear! I never meant for anyone else to see it—"
An amused, feminine voice to his right broke him out of his thoughts and caused him to stiffen in surprise.
But then, the more he thought about it, the more Draco realized that given their whole, morbid history during the war, she didn't exactly owe him any semblance of honesty before all of this.
There were a couple of amused snorts and chuckles around the room.

"Corner was making inappropriate remarks about you in front of all those other boys and you're mad at

Who's the lucky bloke who fires up your loins?" Blaise waggled his eyebrows up and down at her, causing Aria to make a disgusted face and everyone else to burst into drunken snickers.
if he let her get away from him now.
"Oh you know." Through no control of her own, Aria's eyes darkened and she felt the amusement on her face begin to drain away as she considered the answer to Pansy's question. "The muggle relatives who used to starve me, the evil bitch who killed my godfather and tortured my best friend, the disgusting, two-faced rat who sold my parents out, oh and let's not forget
She couldn't bring herself to answer.
"And what exactly do
"What the hell was that about?!" She screeched, causing Draco to wince at the shrillness of her voice. "You told us at the beginning of the year that you had no intention of pursuing Astoria! Why in Merlin's name did you accept her invite to the Ball then?! Did you change your mind?!" She demanded.
do you like Harriah Potter?" She asked again, her eyes flashing as she tutted at him in disapproval and shook her head. "She's nothing special, you know. She's just a girl; one who just happened to be born in the wrong place at the right time; probably had all of these unfortunate circumstances forced upon her by so many different people." She scoffed bitterly to herself, sneering. "In fact, I think the only reason she won that stupid war last year was because of sheer,
"In a manner of speaking." Wood acquiesced, grinning slightly and answering him with a brief incline of his head. "But don't worry, we'll get to that. Before anything else, I'd like to begin our discussion by dispelling a very common belief about us."
"Then why are you doing it now—"
several times in the crotch during the match."
tell anyone else about this, Parkinson." She warned in a low voice.
He stifled another urge to smirk when he saw the miserable way Aria was looking down at her feet, refusing to look up at him as she snatched the gloves and goggles from his hands.
"Not really." Draco answered curtly.
How did you—"
Somehow, Aria managed to resist the urge to hex the handsome blond prat into the next century and instead, turned around to give Hagrid a rueful grin. "So er…yeah. Unfortunately, I'd like to apologize in advance, Hagrid, because…er…I'm here with
Because Aria was stubborn that way; and her stupid pride made her stay right where she was.
"Dozens actually."
Draco didn't answer, turning his attention back to the front of the room just as Kevin Entwhistle, the burly Ravenclaw boy beside Morag, raised his hand.
Draco smirked and began counting down the seconds in his head.
Draco winced at the sight.
"Yes." Hermione sighed. "We checked their wands to confirm if it really was them. They were definitely the ones who trashed the common rooms. When we asked them why they did it though, they said they don't actually remember doing it."
Aria faked a cough at his words and nervously looked away, still squirming under his heated gaze. She managed to force out a strangled laugh and set her empty wine glass down onto the kitchen counter.
was any closer to having talent for the position too, mind you." He drawled, causing Aria's eyes to widen as she immediately bit down on her tongue to keep from laughing.
"So it's
"Well, I believe that's it for today. À la prochaine, au revoir." Fleur flashed them all one last, dazzling smile as she stood up and folded her hands behind her back, waiting patiently as the 8th years stood up to gather their things and began piling out of the classroom.
"I'm sure a Death Eater like him is
Does it bother you to know that the great and perfect Harriah Potter could actually be just like
into laughter at the exact same time Draco spat a whole mouthful of coffee across the table at a poor, unsuspecting Zach's face.
"With the right potions and spells to speed up the healing process…about a week, I'd reckon." Madam Pomfrey answered, ignoring the way Aria's eyes widened in dismay. "The top part of that left wing of yours looks badly broken, it needs a bit of time to heal." She explained.
"To be fair, I
as she was
"Reject me." Aria spoke much louder this time, the harshness of her voice causing a dull ache in Draco's chest that he forced himself to ignore. "You said you didn't want this right? You don't want to be my mate? Reject the mating call. You're perfectly able to, the bond is only formed from my side anyway. You're not obligated to accept it."
Neville smiled wryly, looking amused at her words.
"So, what do you say? Do we have a deal?" She asked, grinning.
Aria didn't bother answering him as she stood up and headed towards the exit of the common room. She heard Draco and Blaise calling after her but she ignored their confused protests as she hastened her steps and made her way back towards the main wing of the castle.
by the way. You've obviously never drunk this much before, have you?" He snickered.
Instead of answering, Ron stuck his tongue out at her while Hermione just shook her head at their antics. As soon as they were gone and Aria found herself alone at the table with Draco once more, she turned to him and gave him a soft smile.
Luna blinked and stared at them as though she thought they were the dumbest people alive. "The real reason we get drunk is when we're exposed to too many Tlipmuddles. Unfortunately, crowds like these tend to attract them. They leave behind a special kind of chemical in our blood when they come to suck the alcohol out through our skin; and that chemical is what makes us drunk."
about to marry an old man!"
Aria reluctantly followed his gaze, trying hard not to scowl when she saw the short-haired girl glaring back at her.
Eventually, Zach spoke up.
it's not him, Hermione." Aria interrupted her again in a firm, angry voice. "We just agreed that someone else could have hexed that Gryffindor Prefect to get those passwords. So I'd appreciate it if you stopped pointing fingers at my housemates unless we have all our facts straight."
"Not that it's any of your business, but I was helping take care of some plants in the greenhouse
"Shouldn't you know that already? I thought you said you can read emotions?"
She couldn't.
"Who started the—"
was coming." Malfoy hissed at him, gritting his teeth.
"Good morning to you too, Hermione." Aria greeted her in a sarcastic tone of voice as she watched the brunette huff again before depositing all of her books onto the foot of Aria's bed. "What's got you into such a delightful mood?" She asked.
Aria fought the urge to flinch at the stab of guilt that suddenly pierced her in the gut.
Blaise cursed under his breath but he obliged, reluctantly crouching down and placing his wand by his feet. Beside him, Draco's eyes narrowed and he began to crouch down slowly, pretending to lower his wand. When Fisher's gaze flickered, Draco sprang back to his feet and made a sharp, jabbing movement with his wand, hurling a powerful blinding jinx into Fisher's face.
" Neville hissed back, though his cheeks reddened slightly as he took his wand out and cast a quick cleaning charm on his shoes. "Unlike a selfish person who probably can't lift a perfectly manicured fingernail to save her life, I'm actually productive during my spare time."
"Draco, I'm still trying to convince. But I'm very persuasive so I'm sure I can get him to tag along. Pansy, on the other hand…Well—" Blaise grimaced and ducked his head behind his hand.
" He growled loudly, causing the said Gryffindor to flinch at the anger in his voice. "Didn't I specifically tell you
we'll be making fun of and all—"
"And how certain are you that this person will act out again?" McGonagall countered.

"It's in the way you stare at her when she's not looking. I've seen you looking at her that way for years."
to killing anyway." Fisher hissed, wincing as he slapped Blaise's hands away when he tried to help him back up. "Why don't you just kill me already? What are you waiting for?" He taunted.
"Oh really? I hadn't noticed." Aria retorted sarcastically, rolling her eyes at him before she snatched the flask from his hand and took another long swig.

"Draco,
"And besides, in the same way that magical society likes to hold veelas accountable for their allure, wouldn't you all agree that it's only fair to also hold vampires accountable for their fixations? Or more importantly, their powers?"
Narcissa gave him an exasperated smile, looking a little worn out by his stubbornness.
"Why?" Draco asked calmly.
To be honest, the rest of the Slytherin eighth years weren't any better off as they sat back and continued to watch the strange scene unfold in front of them in stunned, bemused silence.
Aria rolled her eyes and waved her concerns aside.
She winced and stepped away from him, putting a good couple feet of safe distance between their flushed, aroused bodies. "You horny prick. Haven't we established that I'm still sore?" She grumbled.
interested in someone else, but that won't stop her father from trying to push her towards Draco."
"My mate."
"Aria!" He blurted out as he reached them, ignoring Draco completely as he checked her for any obvious signs of injury. "Bloody hell, are you okay?! I'm so sorry, I couldn't get to you in time – I-I thought you were, I was—" He stopped and his eyes suddenly widened when he caught sight of the small part of her broken wing that was protruding from her left shoulder. His breath hitched and he looked up, wincing as he met Aria's equally panicked expression.
When Austin gave her one last smile and turned around, getting ready to fly off in the other direction, Aria automatically leaned forward and suddenly found herself
The rest of Hannah's indignant retort was cut off when both Blaise and Draco suddenly looked up and glanced at someone over her shoulder. Everyone turned to follow their gaze, watching as Aria entered the common room from the stairs of the girls' dormitories. When she glanced up and saw everyone staring at her, Aria arched an eyebrow at them and gave them a nonplussed look.
"Draco, stop." Aria placed a hand on Draco's arm, shaking her head as she calmly pulled him back down to sit beside her.
"…are these beans crushed enough?"
"—tell me; how does it feel to be the biggest celebrity of the Wizarding World right now? You're a
Aria's knees finally buckled and her wings burst out from beneath her shoulders as she came with a loud, sobbing cry, her entire vision blacking out as she collapsed forward onto the bed beneath him.
"Apologize?!" Draco stiffened and he sneered at the other boy in contempt. "Why the hell do I have to apologize?!"
"In my defense, if I hadn't, you probably would have ended up killing me." She retorted haughtily, sniffing.
For a few seconds, neither of them seemed to know how to react, and when Aria turned to him, Draco frantically tried to come up with something to say. Thankfully, Andromeda managed to divert Aria's confused expression when she reached over and gave Teddy an affectionate kiss on the top of his head.
She remembered all of her awkward encounters with Draco in the Slytherin Common Room, and how he walked away from her every time she tried to approach him, pretending as though nothing had happened between them.
idea how much that makes me feel better." She added playfully.
When Hannah realized what she just did, she slapped both of her hands over her mouth in mortification and sank down low into her seat to hide her face. Pansy just closed her eyes and reached up to pinch the bridge of her nose, sighing in resignation as she watched Blaise collapse into his seat again, his shoulders shaking with laughter. As usual, Morag looked completely unaffected by all the attention they were getting from the other houses. Zach, on the other hand, looked as though he was still trying to figure out what was going on.
"Anyway, I myself can walk into a room and immediately sense if any of the occupants are wizard or witch, muggle, werewolf, veela, mermaid, well...you get the picture."

"I still can't believe you did that! Now we're

"Do you even
"Like that matters when dealing with these loathsome veela." Pansy retorted.
Both the Slytherin and Gryffindor Quidditch Teams had already cleared out by then, as well as all of the other students who had watched the game so Draco made quite a strange sight. He sat there by himself, unusually quiet as he stared thoughtfully up at Hogwarts castle.
They stared intently at each other for a long time, both sets of eyes unwilling to blink, and before she realized what was happening, Aria began to feel a little lightheaded when she caught a whiff of his scent again. This time, the pleasant minty smell of his aftershave was intermingled with something that she knew was
"I believe the exact terms of our arrangement was — in exchange for me helping him get a book from the Restricted Section, Draco agreed that — if the two of you ever
Aria giggled at his reaction and shook her head, pressing him back down to lie on the bed.
"Oh gods...
Draco looked amused at her embarrassment and he gave her a teasing grin.
" She clarified.
It hurt to move.
not you." Pansy scoffed, rolling her eyes.
That was how Draco found himself picking at the food on his plate, staring off into empty space as Narcissa sat across the table in front of him, droning on and on about the latest set of draperies she had purchased for one of the sitting rooms in the manor. He wasn't exactly sure how long he'd been sitting there, lost in his own thoughts and deliberately tuning his mother out, but eventually, Draco was broken out of his trance when Narcissa sighed and cleared her throat.
"Walk a little bit faster, Malfoy."
"You do…? But how—"
"Fuck off."
"Isn't this a bit big for just one person though?" Draco pointed out as they removed their shoes and he followed her into the living room.
"No, that's okay." She looked strangely worried at his offer and frantically shook her head. "I'm actually just heading for the station. I need to take the train back to London—"
To his confusion, Narcissa's features softened and she answered him with a fond smile. "She was probably just overwhelmed by it all. And to be honest, I can't really blame her. I mean, you do realize the significance of this whole thing to a veela, don't you?"
"Actually, we both decided that it would be a two-year engagement." Hermione told her, causing Aria's eyes to widen slightly in surprise. "That way, we'll have enough time to prepare, as well as plan out our budget for the wedding. We don't want to spend too much after all, there's still the matter of saving up enough money for a house to consider."
"You know, like details about her and Neville's sex life." Blaise shrugged.
Most of the Slytherins they knew had been resorted and scattered among the other three houses. However, there were

"That's alright. Corey, why don't you go ahead and fly around? I'll stay here and observe you for now." Aria offered as she handed the Comet 260 over to Corey.
"I think you've been hanging around all those Slytherins too much." Ron added with a snort, shaking his head when Aria snickered at their reaction.

"Well…It's just that…Your hands are
Aria fell silent at that, trying not to wince when she remembered how she had nearly killed Draco with that 'sectumsempra' spell that same year.
"Because we dated, you prat!"
He cleared his throat and reached over, clapping Draco lightly on the shoulder. "Good luck; and let me know how it turns out. Oh and it goes without saying that I expect to be your Best Man, by the way."

of course."
"Hannah, do you want to know the truth?" Neville suddenly spoke up in a firm, reassuring tone of voice, drawing everyone's attention to him. "Being 'sexy' has nothing to do with your appearance or how much skin you show. The truth is, if you really want Ernie to notice you more, you just have to be yourself around him. Sexiness is not just about physical attractiveness." He explained.
It felt weird telling something this personal to Harry but It didn't feel wrong. "Well I'd told my parents over summer and that went well.. so I wanted to tell people at school," he started to divulge. "It took me awhile to build up the courage though, I knew wizards were fine with it but didn't know how the mud-muggle borns would react," he didn't like having to call mudbloods muggle-borns but he knew Harry would get angry at him and as much as he didn't like to admit it, he valued their new friendship.
It had been a week since Malfoy had turned the flirting back on him, he was sat having breakfast in the great hall. When he saw Seamus come and take a seat opposite him next to Hermione. "So Harry, what's happened to the Malfoy teasing?" "Yeah I was meaning to ask you about that to mate, it seems like you've been trying to avoid the git all week," came Fred's voice from next to Ron. Just my luck Fred takes an interest in this again, now of all times he thought to himself. "Oh well you know, It's been a month just thought if I didn't stop soon the idiot would think I actually wanted to bang him," he spoke in what he hoped was a relaxed tone. Seamus, Ron and the twins gave a little chuckle at his response. "I was beginning to think the ferret had done something back to you," spoke Fred. "Nah we all know he wouldn't hurt Harry," Seamus joked causing the other boys to snigger.
Aria watched as Greg nodded and headed over to the refreshment table. On his way back, he stopped briefly to talk to Draco, and Aria's eyes narrowed when both boys suddenly turned their backs on her.
"Don't worry, it's here." Ron chuckled as reached into his robes and pulled out the said necklace, showing it to her. He turned to Hermione and gave her a wide, grateful grin. "I hardly take this thing off nowadays, it's incredibly useful."
Neville's eyes narrowed, and he turned to level Pansy with a slight frown. "And you know this
They rounded another corner and Aria followed him towards a stone wall at the end of a long narrow, hallway. Neville muttered the password ("Machiavellian") and they both clambered through the entrance.
She collapsed onto her back, wincing as she turned her head to the side and caught glimpses of Ron and Neville dueling with Bentley a few feet away. Unfortunately, Bentley's vampire speed was unmatched and he avoided all of their spells easily. He eventually caught Neville by the neck, lifting him up and throwing him across the hall. There was another scuffle that followed; and Aria heard Ron's angry shouts as he continued to duel with Bentley but she was too far away to actually see what was happening.
"We'd better head down to the Potions classroom already if we want to get good seats. Oh yeah, that reminds me." Pansy cut herself off and rifled briefly through her schoolbag, pulling out a small sheet of parchment. Without glancing at her, she thrust the parchment at Aria and waved it impatiently in front of her face.
"Yes,
" He complained loudly.
"He was my first. Okay?"
"Malfoy."
"Before you do that, there's actually another thing I would like for you to give to her, Draco." Narcissa turned to Andromeda, giving her sister an expectant look. "Were you able to bring it with you, Andy?" She asked.
"And may I ask, exactly
"I believe the word you're looking for, Potter, is 'stupid'. '
Their lips were still joined when Draco parted her legs again and finally pushed into her tight, wet warmth. Aria immediately closed her eyes, gasping as she felt a whole new wave of pleasurable tremors threatening to overwhelm her all at once at the feeling of him entering her for the first time. She sighed in relief and arched against him, wrapping her legs tightly around his waist to draw him closer and lock their bodies together.
" Aria breathed out, closing her eyes and squirming with arousal when his hand lingered just below her navel. "The feeling just...
"That's not even the worst part." Hannah's mood grew serious and she lowered her gaze to the floor, shaking her head. "The person who did it, whoever it was, used
She ignored his obvious discomfort and opened another drawer behind him, causing him to wince at the soft, creaking sound.
Feeling a little vindictive, Draco stifled a smirk and decided to prolong her agony a bit longer.
want me to rehash how you were so hopelessly in love with Oliver Rivers when I found you that night in sixth year?" Aria pointed out with an amused smirk.
Aria was broken out of her thoughts a few minutes later by a loud
Wood straightened in his seat and interlaced his fingers together, folding both of his hands onto the table. "The most important thing you need to remember about today's discussion is that there are
"Are you telling me to cut my hair?" She asked, blinking at him in disbelief.
Aria opened her eyes, blushing when she saw the solemn expression on his face.
"I can talk to the Minister of Magic directly and ask him to back me up." Aria retorted, raising her chin and meeting McGonagall's frown with a defiant glare. "And if that doesn't work, I'll tell the whole bloody Prophet that Hogwarts is discriminating against its students and that I myself experienced it firsthand. Better yet, tell the board that if they don't agree, I'll make a big public spectacle about this whole thing. I have no doubt that the entire Wizarding World will eat this up, and I
The more he thought about it, the more Draco realized that Aria never really talked about her feelings before (and every time their past conversations even ventured near the topic, she would always change the subject); so he had absolutely no idea how she felt about him — or if she even cared about him at all.
As he passed by the Gryffindor table, Draco's gaze flicked suspiciously over to the small group of Gryffindors sitting near the very back of the room.
When he received no answer, Draco slowly turned the knob and pushed the door open.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to freak you out like that." She let out a nervous laugh, careful not to meet Draco's sharp gaze. "I just…I don't like it when people suddenly touch me or get too close. After effect of the war, I suppose."
"Not yet." Draco admitted, wincing to himself as he began assembling an array of healing potions and medicinal salves on his tray. "They'll be sending the results via owls this afternoon, so I'll probably only find out whether I passed or not as soon as I get home."
If Aria thought that nothing else could have made her absolutely crappy week worse than it already was, Blaise proved her wrong.
He turned to give Corey another admonishing glare, but instead, it ended up as a worried frown when he noticed the distressed expression that continued to linger on the younger boy's face.
"She's right, though. That wasn't funny." Ron mumbled in agreement as he shoved a spoonful of mash potatoes into his mouth, accidentally spraying Aria with bits of food as he spoke.
it had ever sorted so, as McGonagall was currently trying to explain to them, the 8th years had
"It's not about sympathy."
"You're my Dream Girl; you always have been. And during the war, when my life was so terrible and every day, I kept thinking I was going to die at the hands of the Dark Lord, all I thought about to get me through it all...was
"Aria!"
?" He whispered.
It was amusing to observe how differently everyone seemed to be dealing with all of the stress.
"Ow, bloody hell, someone just stepped on my shoes!" Draco complained as he trudged after her, scowling when he found himself being pushed, elbowed and shoved as they weaved their way through the unruly sea of wizards, witches and muggles who were entering and exiting the many different train platforms of the station.
"The secret's out, by the way."
"Yeah, Malfoy. What's wrong? You've been looking foul all morning." Greg pointed out.
"Ron,
"That's not what it was. Look, I know it looks bad; but you're completely misunderstanding the situation—"
There was an uncomfortable silence that followed, and none of the reporters looked as though they were inclined to answer. Before Aria could continue, however, another reporter from the crowd suddenly spoke up in a loud, obnoxiously saccharine voice.
Neither Pansy nor Aria spoke for a long time after that, both girls working in relative silence as they cast charms on their mops and began working as fast as they could cleaning the floors of the classroom.
She froze again and blinked at the peculiarity of his response.
wanted to?!" Dean retorted, a disgruntled look on his face as he yanked off his new blue and white scarf. "I don't want to be a Ravenclaw, damn it!"
"What?" He snapped.
Aria and Ron both nodded in agreement before they promptly turned their attention back to their chess game. Meanwhile, Hermione leaned back, popped open one of her textbooks and began working on one of her assignments.
"They're fair and blonde and bloody gorgeous?" He blurted out, causing a chorus of snorts and snickers to erupt from the class.
"I like big open spaces." Aria averted her gaze from his and walked over to the window to avoid looking at him. When Draco continued to stare at her, obviously waiting for her response, Aria turned around again and gave him a teasing smile, changing the topic.
, the decision is up to Corey here. If he wants to play, then you should let him play. Besides, if he and Aria have been flying for weeks now and there hasn't been any negative impact on him, then don't you think it's fine? I mean, if his healer did say it would be safe, then there should be no reason to worry." He reasoned calmly.
He sighed at that but he nodded reluctantly and left, closing the door quietly behind him. As soon as only Aria, Hermione, and Ilyana were left in the small hospital room, Ilyana smiled again and slowly turned her attention back to Aria.
"You are sick."
"I was just enjoying the view." He drawled.
"Ah yes,
going to tell you." Aria retorted with a plucky smirk before boldly downing the entire shot of firewhiskey he had given her without so much as a flinch.
His two companions looked up at him in surprise, their attentions from each other momentarily diverted.
"Overprotective?! You reckless harpy—"
"Oh I like
"What do you want? I don't even know why you're tailing after me like this,
"Potter. Longbottom. Do you need the table?" He ignored the death glare that Pansy was shooting him from across the table and swept some of their books aside to make room for the other two Slytherins.
"You're awake."
"Er…That's nice of you, Zach. Thanks." Aria blinked and managed an awkward smile before cautiously backing away when Zach seemed to lean in even closer to her from his seat until the entire front of his torso was lying down on the table.
"Aria, stop it!"
"You were the one who wanted me to spike your own girlfriend's drink!"
He didn't wait for Aria to say anything else after that as he shot Pansy one last, angry sneer before he turned on his heel and stormed off, his footsteps fading away down the long, narrow corridor. As soon as he was gone, Aria shifted her gaze over to Pansy in question. When she saw the way the girl was sniffing and hugging herself, purposely avoiding her eyes, Aria let out another exasperated sigh and fought the urge to roll her eyes.
"Hey—!"
Sighing, Aria reluctantly took the seat beside Blaise, careful not to accidentally knock over the piles of books scattered around them. Blaise grinned at that and rewarded her with a wink before turning back to his essay, which, Aria couldn't help but notice enviously, looked about halfway finished.
if you know what I mean." He winked.
At her words, the anxious expression on Draco's face finally melted away.
"Sorry about my snippiness on the way here, Hermione." She ignored the way Hermione's eyebrows arched at her words and scowled, picking at an imaginary speck of dust on her blanket. "I was being really childish, taking my frustration about this stupid veela mess with Malfoy on you and Ron like that." She admitted with a huff.
you!"
powerful and will undoubtedly defend themselves if they sense you to be a threat. Most wizards will not even be able to get close enough to a Veela to force a bond with them this way. Of course, it is a different story altogether if you know her name and possess at least one of her feathers. This is the reason I refused to teach you the Feather Curse." Fleur's eyes narrowed slightly as she glared at Michael Corner again, causing the Ravenclaw to swallow loudly and lower himself back down into his seat.
Draco pulled his mouth away from hers and leaned down, biting a messy trail along her collarbone before moving back up and tugging on her earlobes with his teeth.
She told them.
When she made a face at him, he grabbed the apple from his mouth and swallowed before reading the small card attached to the box of chocolates. "It's from a Gryffindor bloke in 5th year named Miles Penworth. Come on mate, it can't honestly be that bad. I've talked to Penworth, he seems pretty normal." He pointed out.
Skeeter stuck her nose in the air. "I'll have you know, Miss Potter, that I
The light shining down on her from the moon was bright,
Draco's hand shook as he swallowed before carefully adjusting Aria in his arms again, making sure that the strange wing-protrusion was hidden from everyone else's view.
"That's awfully presumptuous of you—Draco!"
"You're such a tease."
"Aren't you two going to go after her?" Aria finally spoke up, directing her blank stare at Blaise and Draco.
"My guess is,
After a long moment, she turned to Blaise again and gave him a questioning look.
Draco smiled and wrapped his arms around her waist, drawing her body closer against his.
"A lot of girls like him in Hufflepuff too." Astoria offered, shrugging at them.
She hesitated, blinking a few times as her eyes flicked back and forth between his abashed features and the coat he held in his hands. When he didn't relent, she sighed in defeat and nodded, turning around and allowing him to help her back into her coat. After he left the payment for their meal on the table and slipped into his own, she tucked her hand through his arm and they left the café together.
"It's obvious, isn't it?"
" He glared hatefully at Draco once more.
?" He complained loudly, making a disgusted face. "There are other things I'd much rather be doing—"
"No offense, Morag. But
"Personally, I find it sexy if a girl is confident in her own skin and about who she is or what she wants. It's because that self-assurance in her personality is reflected in the way she carries herself." Draco smirked at the stunned look on Hannah's face.
down there?!"
"N—no, actually. I have a boyfriend. But Ernie doesn't really drink that much—"
"Don't they have any rules against people like
This time, Granger raised her hand and Draco's narrowed gray eyes flicked over to her.
Aria screamed as Bentley eventually tossed an unconscious Hermione onto the floor.
He spat, ignoring the warning look on Aria's face as he walked around her and strode right up to Draco, pushing him away from her. Seething, Bentley tilted his chin to glare up at him despite their height difference.
on us or anything are you?" He teased.
"What?" She asked cautiously.
her to do as she was told. Even now, as she backed away from Bentley's approaching form, that presence in her head only seemed to grow stronger and
"It was just a suggestion." Draco shrugged, continuing to speak in the same forced, casual voice that Aria had never heard him use before. "I'm curious, by the way. Has your hair always been that long?"
Ironically, Pansy looked a little taken back by her hostile reaction to Aria's statement because she had gone completely still, her eyes a little wide in belated realization. When she saw both Hannah and Morag staring at her, as well as the way Aria was glaring at her in challenge, the sneer on her face quickly vanished and she shrugged before pointedly turning her attention back to her trunk.
, he absolutely did not hear the petty huffiness in his own voice as he spoke. "I'm sure he'd be more than happy to waltz with you for as long as you want."
Aria was trying very hard not to let the heated blush on her face show as she averted her gaze from his, reaching up behind her to begin twisting her hair back into a loose braid.
Thankfully, most of the reporters (with the exception of Rita Skeeter, for obvious reasons) kept their questions confined to the topics that Aria had agreed to discuss beforehand.
Zach groaned under his breath, wincing and burying his face into a bewildered Demelza's shoulder.
Aria and Hermione to roll their eyes and give him irritated glares.
"Thank you."
When Aria blinked and stared at him in confusion, Blaise chuckled and decided to explain further.
"Do you still think I regret any of this, Malfoy?" Aria whispered teasingly against his cheek before she lowered her mouth and began placing hot, searing kisses against the pulse point of his neck. "Do you see now how much I want you as much as you want me?"
that other women will never be able to achieve through any beauty products." Fleur said with a smug, completely unapologetic smile.
Ron's expression suddenly grew serious and he turned to give her a pointed look.
I figured she'd be able to take it. Besides, she was more than an hour late – and while we're on that subject, so are you." He gave Draco a pointed look before pouring him a shot of the same drink he had just offered Aria.
As soon as the words left Aria's lips, Draco reached out and grabbed her chin, tilting her face up to deepen their kiss even more. Eventually, his thrusts picked up and he began pounding into her harder, his hands moving to grasp roughly at her ass so that he could yank her against him in time with the forceful snap of his hips.
"Lighter shades like what?" She asked curiously.
Instead, she was wearing a long coat over a green turtle-neck dress that hugged her svelte figure perfectly, ending a few inches above her knees. As Draco gulped and unwittingly allowed his eyes to trail down, he noticed that she was wearing black tights underneath her dress, along with a pair of knee-high boots that matched the same tan color of the gloves on her hands.
that subject—" When Blaise paused and his grin began to widen
It started when Seamus Finnigan decided to spike the drinks of all of the Slytherins with a Weasley concoction during dinner, while everyone was eating in the Great Hall. Within a few minutes, every single Slytherin (including Potter, because apparently Finnigan didn't even think to spare the bloody Chosen One from his ridiculous tomfoolery) began hiccuping like crazy, and colorful, quaffle-sized bubbles began coming out of their mouths.
Once he made it to the bottom of the stairs he just saw the back of Theo head out the door. Pansy and Blaise were looking at him completely confused 'I'll deal with them another time' he thought. To much had happened tonight first Potter having a crush on him, then Theo liking him, then the kiss and the fact he still had no ideas who's cologne he smelt in the amortina along with Theo. 'Your are such an idiot, your probably just lost your best friend' he thought as he kicked the wall.
About forty five minutes later they'd made a successful draught of peace, only because Potter was doing most of it wrong so Draco had to do most of it for him as he just ogled at the other boy. Even though Potter insisted he made it and Draco helped. "Potter, you mind if you try the next one on your own? There's one from Snape I want to try," he asked the other boy who was in the middle of laying of ingredients "Yeah, go for it" he replied. He was kind of nervous to make this one he'd put it of for a while, he knew he shouldn't be scared because after all it was just a smell but he was scared to make it.
Instead Malfoy quickly turned around and a second later he had the tip of his wand under Harry's chin and tilting his head up to look him in the eyes. "You know Potter, I couldn't help but notice you at quidditch practise the other night. Your good on a broom..." Malfoy continued in no more than a whisper with his face only inches away from Harry's. "...your swift, fast and you wear that tight jumper." Malfoy gave him a wink before putting his wand away and stepping back. He started laughing as he backed away "Looks like I'm not the only one who freezes then Potter,".
Just want to say sorry for the way this chapter ended and Harry and Draco do get together eventually but that won't be for a few more chapters.
Merlin's Beard what had he got himself into Draco thought to himself. First apologising to Potter and now agreeing to try and be friends with him. But the other boy was right, they hated each other and for what? Things that happened 15 years before. I suppose meeting him once won’t do any harm and if it doesn’t go well we can go back to hating each other Draco thought. He didn’t like the thought of that though, hating Potter, he’d never completely liked the thought of it even in first year. But he never had the choice to hate or not hate him before, he was kind of secretly glad things had happened how they did.
They'd been back at Hogwarts for about for about 2 weeks now, he hadn't told people at school yet he wanted to and the only question was how and when. He felt more cautious about doing it at school he didn't know why tho he was still Draco Malfoy a Pureblood feared by most other students the fact he liked blokes not girls wouldn't change that. The only people in school who might not be happy about it were any mudbloods but he could handle them, they wouldn't do anything that bad anyways. Right? Right. He still couldn't figure out how he wanted to do it other than he knew he wanted to do it in the most quick way possible. His entire day was spent coming up with a way, he only managed to come up with one at dinner: it was perfect he thought and it didn't require much work on his part. He stayed at the table in the great hall with Pansy until he notices a third year group of Slytherins get up and leave, he didn't know much about the girls other than they could spread gossip quicker than The Daily Prophet. He waited till everyone other than Pansy and the gossipy group were out of earshot ”Listen Pansy I need to talk to you about something,“ he heard the third years hush their voices a bit and were doing a not so subtle job at listening in. "Alright what's up D," responded Pansy with a sort of intrigued tone in her voice, "Well umm there's this thing that I've known for a while and I told my parents over summer and I want to tell people at school as well," he didn't know if it was best to just say it or to say a bit before. Pansy linked her arm through his and put her head on his shoulder, she often did this if she was tired or one of them was upset over something. "Alright, what is it?" She asked in the same gentle tone his mother had in the summer. "Well Pansy, I'm gay," he'd never actually said that word out loud before even when he told his parents, it felt really good to tho. Pansy lifted her head up off his shoulder to look him in the eyes "Seriously?" She asked as Draco tried to recall a time he'd ever seen her so shocked before. "Yes seriously pans," he answered noticing how the third years looked shell shocked and he knew his plan had worked. Pansy rested her head back onto his shoulder and they carried on in silence for a few seconds "you know I still love you right D not in that way obviously, but your my best friend and it's okay with me if you wanna be with boys," came a rather tired voice off his shoulder. "I know and I love you too pans." They'd arrived at the entrance to the Slytherin common room the third years quickly rushing over to some fourth years Draco being ninety nine percent sure he knew what they would be speaking about "I'm gonna head up for an early night, see ya tomorrow pans," he said while climbing the stairs to the boys dorms.
"So anyway what about you? When did you know?" Harry asked in a more cheery voice, while forcing a smile, clearly trying to lighten the mood. "Oh that," Draco hadn't told this to anyone before but figured if Harry could tell him that he could say this. "Well, I started questioning in third year back then I just thought I wanted to be really good friends with him but looking back on it now, I definitely had a crush on Theo. Then last year when I ended up on the Quidditch pitch snogging the face off of a Durmstrang, It kind of sealed the deal," he disclose. He could tell by Harry's face he hadn't liked hearing about the Durmstrang, but he didn't seem to let it effect his mood.
Over the next two weeks Harry would do it a couple more times. At first it was to stop the twins begging him but after the fourth time they got bored of it. Seamus and most others in there year still found it hilarious though. The only people other than the slytherins who weren't that happy about it were Ron and Hermione. Hermione thought it was stupid and a waste of time so she just tended to ignore it. Ron on the other hand was more confused as to why Harry was doing it as he knew Harry was also bent. He'd asked Harry about it a few times and always got the same reply "Like you said mate, payback,". Ron knew that wasn't the actually reason but gave up on asking Harry about it.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was a few minutes past seven and he'd just arrived outside the tapestry. Potter was pacing again he decided not to interrupt as he looked like he was concentrating on something, 'I wonder if all our meetings will start with Potter pacing,' he thought. He stopped pacing then looked up at the wall as the doors to the Room of requirement appeared. He looked over to Potter, "It's the room of requirement, you pace in front of it three times thinking of what you want it to be and then it becomes it," Potter said enthusiastically walking over to him. He'd already known about the room as his father had told him about it when he first went to Hogwarts, he let Potter talk about it as he seemed to enjoy showing it to him.
He was sat in the great hall with Theo, Blaise and Pansy. They'd been joking around about Blaise and him hearing Theo moan in his sleep the past night, the boy refusing to tell the others what he was dreaming about when he noticed Potter. He was staring at him, but not like he'd done in the past. Then he looked at him like he was plotting to use an unforgivable on him now there was something in his eyes. Something different. At first Draco thought he was sad but he soon decided it was more confused than sad.
"Potter, I accept your apology about the past month but I can’t about everything else. I was a complete git to you and your friends and... umm.. I’m sorry,.. I’m sorry about making jokes about your parents or your scar and constantly getting at you and all the other stuff,” did he really just apologise to Harry Potter? Coming up here tonight he would never have guessed it was going to turn out this way but somewhere deep down he was sorry for what he did to Potter.
The past month Seamus had told rather a few jokes involving him and Malfoy, they always caused those around them to laugh a bit but they always annoyed Harry. He zoned out of the conversation at that point, which is something he'd been doing a lot of the past week. He was constantly thinking about something either Umbridge, the DA, Qudditch practise but mainly Malfoy. He couldn't get the other boy out his head, no matter how much he tries to distract himself, his thoughts always found there way back to his enticing blonde hair or those annoyingly good looking cheek bones. He hated admitting this to himself but Merlin he did find Malfoy attractive.
They met again the next night, Draco decides to brew a potion Snape had set him for some extra practise.
It was Draco, he managed to slip past Binns without getting noticed and sat down besides Him. He looked like he rushed there from somewhere, his hair was more messed up than usual - though Harry would still consider it neat- and he seemed slightly out of breath.
They were about half why there when Draco looked round at Theo. He still had his arm around him and was looking down at the ground, "Mate, you sure you're okay? You know you can talk to me right," he asked the other boy trying to get Theo to at least spill a little bit about what's bugging him so much. He was normally quite happy and lively it was definitely odd for him to be like this. "Yeah all good, just a bit tired." Theo voiced as he gave Draco an obviously fake smile. They went on the whole day with Draco avoiding the subject.
"Hey sorry about that, come on lets head down," Hermione said whilst standing between them as they made there way down to the great hall. She was going on about something for her Herbology homework but Harry wasn't paying much attention. He was thinking back to the conversation he was having with Ron, which lead him to think about Cedric, he'd got over the boy a long time ago but he still missed him. Even if it was just in a friend way.
"I don't care, I like someone else anyway," Draco spat before strutting into the common room and up to the dorms. He knew Theo would have more questions if he stayed and there was no way Draco was going to answer them. He was kind of glad they had that conversation he finally saw how much Theo was going to push this down. He lay on his bed just thinking about anything he could to take his mind off the argument. No matter what he was thinking about though. his thoughts just kept going back to the raven haired gryffindor seeker.
"You think," Potter said jokingly, whilst he was trying to act as if he hadn't just heard the most shocking thing since his father telling him The dark lord was back. "Wait so you don't smell you?" Potter asked curiously, picking up on the thing Draco had whished he hadn't. "Um," he spoke more to himself than to Potter. He hadn't actually focused on what he smelt before, he couldn't quite make out what it was. There was a mixture of coconut, something he couldn't name but knew he'd smelt it in the common room and then a cologne, the cologne was the strongest sent but he had no idea who's it was. "Nah it's Coconut and cologne for me," he responded to Potter choosing the leave out the unnamed thing from the common room.
He was about to go back to the astronomy when he realised it. It was the first time he was smelling it since that night, but it couldn't be. If it was Harry's cologne he'd have smelt it on him in the past few days, wouldn't he? "P-Potter who's cologne's on this jumper?" he stuttered out, hoping for any other answer to the one he got. "Mine, I don't wear it that often though," he said while flipping through one of his books. "Right," he said back barely audible, clearly Harry hadn't heard him as he carried on looking at his book.
"D, you alright?" Pansy spoke gently while shaking his arm. "Yeah, I was just umm... never mind," Draco stuttered as he turned his gaze back to the girl sat opposite him. "What's Potter done to get in your head this time," Theo quizzed him. "Huh?" Draco said while mentally kicking himself for staring. "That is who you were staring at right?" Theo said with a little more of a relaxed tone. "No, wasn't staring at anyone just zoned out." He hadn't told them about what happened last week and he wasn't going to now. Theo gave him a nod of understanding and the group went on their way to Herbology.
He didn't like lying to Harry even if it was something as small as what potion he was making. He didn't know why but it made him feel guilty, when he lied to his other friends he didn't get like this. It was only Harry tha- he was thinking Harry.
It was only once they were right next to each other that Draco smelt it, his hair smelt of coconut. He wasn't that shocked as he had liked the other boy a few years back, he wasn't to sure about his feelings now though. All he knew was part of the amortentia smelt like him, the coconut was and what he thought was from the common room, he was now certain was their dorm, The cologne wasn't though, Theo always wore the same one and was definitely not the one Draco smelt but he decided to ignore that part for now. He didn't know how big this part of him was but he knew that some part of him liked Theo.
"It's getting late we should head back," Potter spoke as he tided his stuff up. "Yeah so when you next free?" Draco asked as he started tiding his stuff up too and putting his cloak back on, the sleeve brushing over the top of his potion leaving a trace of the amortentia. "Um, Friday?" Potter asked, "Yeah, how about Astronomy up at the tower," he asked whilst picking up his bag "Sure, see ya," Potter responded as he left the room first. Draco only left a few seconds after though Potter was already gone.
He was still wrapped in his thoughts of trying to figure out who's cologne it was when he got back to the common room. Pansy and Blaise were sat in the armchairs next to the fire and Theo was lying down across the sofa between the two. He was talking enthusiastically to them completely different to the last time Draco had seen him last night. "Hey, where you been?" Blaise asked as he neared them, Pansy and Theo whipped there heads round to look at who Blaise was talking to. "Oh nowhere," he responded "Just umm practising potions,". He stood next to the sofa as Theo sat upright to let Draco flop down next to him, he lay back down again this time placing his head on Draco's lap. He did this often with the three others but mostly to Draco. "You sure 'bout that D?" Pansy asked as he mentally cursed himself for stuttering. "Probably out somewhere with a boy," Blaise joked as Pansy and him laughed along with this.
"You alright?" Draco spoke quietly to the boy on his lap, he was staring at the wall with a confused look etched into his face, he whipped his head to look at Draco. Then sat up looking more confused as his eyes stared to wash over with a glassy look to them. He stood up and was on his way up to their Dorm in a split second. 'He figured it out' Draco thought to himself, "What was that all about?" Pansy asked as she and Blaise looked at him waiting for a explanation. "Umm I'll go and see," he said whilst he got up and headed over to the stairs.
It was mid October and Harry was on his way back from the library he'd gone to pick up a book him Ron and Hermione needed for there charms homework. He'd just turned down a third floor corridor and tripped over his laces once he retied them he got the book and carried on, his left shoulder was hurting a bit but it was nothing he couldn't handle so he just left it. He noticed Malfoy was further on down the corridor, he probably loved seeing me fall over Harry thought. Once again he had that thought that Malfoy managed to move with grace like a swift jungle cat while Harry really was this little puppy tripping over everything.  A few seconds later he wasn't that far behind Malfoy when he notice the other boy had started to draw his wand. Harry stopped walking so this is when Malfoy was going to get back at him for the past month Harry thought but Merlin he was wrong.
He woke up early that morning, got ready and then waited for Ron and Hermione. He sat in the common room on one of the sofas in front of the fire. He couldn't quite believe that last night actually happened. He was happy they could try and be friends, really happy actually. Yeah part of him wanted more but he knew it was unrealistic to go from hating each other one day to dating the next. That isn't to say he thinks they'll start dating after hanging out a bit, they might just stay friends and Harry would be happy with that. The fact he managed to be alone with Draco so long without getting hexed was still quite new to him.
"What you thinking about?" came Hermione's voice from behind him in almost a teasing tone. "Nothing.. just umm.. nothing," he was mentally kicking himself for not being able to lie to her. She gave him a knowing look but she dropped it and the three of them headed off to the great hall for breakfast. They'd just got out of the portrait hole when Hermione spotted one of her other friends from Hufflepuff, "I just need to speak to her for a second, do you mind waiting for a minute?" She asked the boys. "Yeah sure go," Ron replied as she walked off after the other girl.
What's Potter got to be confused about? If anything he should be the confused one and Merlin he was confused he thought to himself. Potter was full on avoiding him, even though they've hated each other for five years they never did that to each other before. Potter would speed walk in the other direction if he saw him and he even asked Snape to change partners in potions. Which Snape actually agreed to which Draco was not expecting even though it was only for the week, so I'd be back to normal in their next lesson. Potter even went as far as to just not show up to the rest of the classes where they were seated next to each other, which was about half. Draco had heard a rumour that Potter was getting detention with McGonagall for this but he didn't believe it. Snape and Umbridge were the only professors who ever punish the boy who lived.
As the night went on it started to get rather cold and Draco was regretting not bringing a coat or jumper. He started to shake a bit and was just about to say they call it a night when Harry started taking his hoodie off. He pulled it off his head leaving his hair in more of a mess than normal, Draco thought he'd gone mad it was freezing. "Take it," Harry said while passing him his hoodie, "But you'll freez-" he began to protest suddenly caring more for Harry than himself. "I'll be fine, your shaking.Take it," Draco got the feeling Harry wouldn't let him say no so he slipped the hoodie on.
They'd been in the library for about 20 minutes and all Harry had written was "DA 12/5/95" on the top of the page before he was back on the topic of the blonde slytherin. He was trying to come up with a reasonable excuse for dwelling on this every minute of every day for the past week. His only conclusion about his feelings though was he'd recently developed a new found attraction for the other boy and he didn't like what happened the other night as their faces were so close together he could have kissed him, if he wanted, which he didn't. He didn't know why he kept having to clarify that he didn't. Then like a light bulb had been switched on in his head, he dropped his quill (which had been aimlessly drawing a heart on his parchment) and he stared out the window ignoring Ron and Hermione asking if he was alright. He let it sink in for a second. He liked him. He Harry Potter, the boy who lived had a crush on Draco Malfoy, son of one of Voldemort's most trusted death eaters. Merlin this was not going to end well.
He climbed up the flight of stairs to the Astronomy tower to find Potter already there. He was in his uniform but he had replaced his cloak with a black hoodie, "Hey," Potter turned round to look at him a visible blush growing on his cheeks.
He got up and slowly walked over to the railings whilst shaking his head, "Can I trust you Malfoy?" he murmured, "Course," he tried to speak as reassuring as he could as he had a feeling he knew what Harry was going to tell him. "It's umm.. It's boys not girls," he spoke in a voice so quiet Draco could barely hear him, he had his back turned to him now. Draco got up and walked over to him, he placed a hand on his shoulder and gently turned Harry to look at him, "Okay.. then got any boys?" they were both now leaning on the railings looking out at the sky.
It was about half an hour before Ron and him normally went to sleep, they were in their dorm whilst the other boys were still in the common room. "Why'd you think he chose to do it now?" He heard Ron say pulling him out of his thought of Malfoy. He was beyond shocked as he heard about Malfoy being like him. "Who? And do what?" Harry asked as he was beyond confused about what Ron was on about now. "Malfoy, I mean why'd you think he chose to do it now with everything that's going on, I recon he's got a boy," he felt weird as he heard the mention of Malfoy with another boy but he just brushed it off. "I don't know he doesn't need a boyfriend to come out, he might just thought it was time perhaps or got fed up of hiding in the closet," God Harry really knew about that last one. "Suppose. Could you image it? Wanting to be with another boy I mean, I can't." Harry looked down at his hands. He'd been feeling down all day and just really wanted the conversation to be about anything other than Malfoy or imagining being with boys. "Umm I suppose not, never given it much thought," Harry lied. "Ron would you tell me, if you were I mean?" Harry quizzed him "Of course mate, it wouldn't change anything between us even if one of us were. You'd tell me right?" Ron said looking over at his best mate seeing something was clearing bothering him. Harry looked down at his hands again, he trusted Ron and he was tired of lying to his best mate. "Yes I would tell you," he answered Ron who was now sat on the bed next to his. "Ron, promise you won't tell anyone," he tried to speak clearly but it came out as more of a whisper. "Umm sure of course mate, what is it?" Ron asked curiously. "Yes I can imagine it, being with a boy it's being with a girl I can't imagine," he looked up at Ron who was wearing a look of shock and caring. "So you're gay?" Ron asked after a few seconds. Harry slightly nodded his head, Ron came over next to him and put his hand on his back "It's alright mate, I'm okay with it and like I said it doesn't change anything between us, as long as you don't get a crush on me, we're fine,". Both the boys stood up and gave each other a quick hug whilst patting each other on the back "Thanks mate," Harry said quietly. Ron silently nodded his head " anytime mate, night" "night".
He wasn't quite sure what he was going to say to him, by the way he looked when leaving the common room Draco was fully expecting to find him in the same state he had done the other night. He wondered if that was why he was like that the other day but Theo wasn't homophobic he thought. He didn't quite know what to make of all this, he'd never really had a problem with it, he'd heard of people getting Internalised homophobia but he always thought it was just bigot muggles that had it. Theo had clearly taken it harder than he did, if he is gay that is but based of the last few minutes he was almost certain he was.
"What the hell Potter, who gives one if D likes boys or girls, you little intolerable git, you don't have to tease him for it," Parkinson yelled at him whilst drawing her wand. "Pans, leave it that's what you told me to do yesterday, you curse him now you'll end up in detention with Snape for Merlin knows how long," Malfoy practically hissed at Parkinson whilst dragging her back to where she was before. Harry was confused at what Malfoy had meant at that last statement Snape hated him everyone knew that, if someone hexed him for embarrassing his godson he would probably have a party. Harry smirked at the mental image of Snape having a party it was both the most disturbing and hilarious thing he'd thought of in a while. Malfoy obviously thinking Harry was still thinking about the events that just happened, instead of his godfather drunk on firewiskey, spoke to him even though it was more of a hiss "I'll get you back for that Scarhead, mark my words." With that him and Parkinson marched back down the hallway somewhere, he noticed how even angry Malfoy had ten times more grace when he walked than Harry did, He was like this magnificent jungle cat whilst Harry was like this little puppy walking into everything and tripping up everywhere he went.
He was snapped out his thoughts as Pansy coughed besides him and the other two scrambled around to look at them. Daphne started blushing as she realised she'd been caught, she quickly tucked her shirt back into her skirt and looked down at the ground. Theo just looked at Draco, he was also blushing but left his shirt half open. He stared at him in the eyes, Draco couldn't make out if it was a look of fear or annoyance. Pansy was looking between the three and clearly felt the tension growing between the two boys and so had Daphne as they both seemed to silently communicate to each other to go inside. So they hurriedly made their way into the common room.
"Come on Harry it'll be fun, get back at the slimy git, for the past few years," Harry didn't know wether he should be concerned or not about Seamus' enthusiasm about this topic.  The two of them with Hermione and Ron were on the way down to potions. "I don't know Seamus don't get me wrong I hate the guy but I think you should leave him alone about this. If you want to annoy him just call him a ferret again,". "Seamus if Harry doesn't want to do it, he doesn't have to. So if that's all you came here to talk to us about then leave," Ron snapped at Seamus. He looked back at Harry clearly annoyed this time, then slouched away whilst muttering under his breathe, "The way Harry acts he might as well be a poof himself," he didn't think he was meant to hear that so he left Seamus be. "Just ignore him Harry, if you snap at him about that you may as well tell him what you told me last night," Ron spoke as Hermione lifted her head out the book she was reading, giving Ron a puzzled look about the last part of his sentence then went back to her book.
They spent the next half hour making small talk about Quidditch and school and various other things whilst making there individual Potions. "Dang Malfoy, You trying to clone yourself with that or what?" Potter said teasingly at him. "Huh?" was all he managed to get out as he was completely confused as to what Potter was on about. "That," he said pointing to Draco's caldron "It stinks of Vanilla, Apple tart and mainly your cologne. What you making anyways?" Potter responded clearly not knowing what he'd just done. 'Merlin' he thought to himself, 'Harry Potter had a crush on me, vanilla is my shampoo, apple tart my favourite food and my cologne. Potter's gay and likes me. Merlin. The boy who lived has a crush on son of death eater.' "Veriterserum, think I've done it wrong though," he lied before he could bombard Potter with all the questions going round his head, he knew he couldn't do that though.
They got down to the dungeons, Seamus and Dean were talking on one side of the doorframe and Malfoy and Parkinson were on the other side. The rest of the corridor was empty, just go for it, Harry thought. He walked up in front of Malfoy "What do you want Scarhea-" Malfoy didn't finish his sentence as Harry had pushed him up to the wall. He had his hands on either of his shoulders so to pin him down "Heard about your news, having been able to stop thinking about it actually. Wouldn't mind getting all up on that if you know what I mean," Harry whispered into Malfoy's ear. He stepped back and saw Seamus laughing hysterically at Malfoy who seemed to have frozen up in shock. "Guess I was wrong about you Harry," Seamus spoke as he handed Harry his hand, he clasped it and they pulled each other in hitting the other on the back. He smiled at Seamus but he felt awful about it. He wouldn't be surprised if Malfoy had used the cruciatus on him there and then. Hermione and Ron both looked at him in complete confusion.
“Oh, c’mon Hermione,” Harry said with a chuckle.  “I wouldn’t have survived without you and Ron watching my back. Think of all the times we worked together to deal with completely impossible situations.  The three of us were a team, and we fought the good fight.  Besides, if you had been any more powerful back then, you’d have been intolerable.”
Harry said with a smile, “At least she didn’t rub it in.”
When lunchtime came, Draco apparated right at the front door of the Edinburgh house belonging to Astoria’s Aunt Isabella.   It was a stunning five-bedroom stone house in the Blacket Conservation Area of Edinburgh, with a slated roof and five large case windows facing the street.  Draco realized that he was arriving unannounced.  He knocked loudly on the door.  He was greeted by Timsy, one of Isabella’s house-elves.
But perhaps what was most surprising to Draco was the letter’s salutation and closing.  “Dear Draco,” Harry had written at the beginning of the letter.  Draco couldn’t think of another time that Potter had addressed him as “Draco,” and he was surprised by how he found it touching.  But even more touching was how Harry closed the letter—”Harry aka Potter aka Scarhead.” Draco laughed out loud at the closing.  Other people might think it an inappropriate way to close a condolence letter, but the irreverent humor perfectly suited Draco’s personality and deftly acknowledged the complex, snarky relationship between the Slytherin and the Gryffindor.
“I do,” Harry replied. “And if you absolutely hate it at my place we can always come up with an alternate plan.”
“My name’s Harry.”
Harry smiled with embarrassment. “That’s me, I guess,” he said.
On a warm evening in late May, Harry apparated at Grangeley, Hermione’s and Ron’s country cottage in Kent.  He had spoken to Hermione at the Ministry a few days earlier, explaining that he wanted to discuss a personal matter with the couple.  Hermione suggested that he pop over to Grangeley for supper so that he could also see his godchildren, Hugo and Rose.
“I’m speechless for once, Harry,” Hermione said.  “When-er-how did this happen?”
*****
Harry and Draco had both apparated home before suppertime. Kreacher and Roody served the wizards spaghetti Bolognese, which was one of Harry’s favorite comfort foods, accompanied by a side of broccoli and a garden salad.  A ten-year-old bottle of Barbaresco from the wine cellar complemented the meal perfectly.  After devouring the delicious meal, Harry and Draco retired to the drawing room where they continued sipping the delicious red wine.
The time soon came to tell others about their relationship status.  One evening when Harry and Draco were lying in bed, Harry said, “I think it’s time for me to tell my friends and family about our relationship. You’re so important to me, as are they.  I want you to get to know them, and for them to get to know you.”
“I have been seeing a Muggle psychologist for almost two months now,” Harry said. Draco raised his eyebrows in surprise.  He inclined his head, waiting for Harry to continue.
“OK,” Harry began. “If I do agree to see a Muggle psychologist, what’s the next step?”
The wizards apparated in the Grangely parlor at the appointed time.  Hugo and Rose ran up to Harry, demanding hugs and welcoming him with shouts of “Uncle Harry.”  Harry then introduced the children to Draco, saying, “Hugo and Rose, I’d like you to meet my partner, Draco.  Draco, this is Hugo and Rose, my godchildren.”
Draco plopped down in the matching chair facing Harry’s.  “I went to Edinburgh to meet with Astoria and spend time with Scorpius,” he said.
After viewing and describing the memory, Harry let Petunia have it with both barrels. “How dare you withhold food from your nephew, your own sister’s only son, you fucking cow! Just because you were jealous that she had magic and you didn’t!  The most barbaric and inhuman person in the world wouldn’t keep food from a starving boy.  If anyone deserves the Cruciatus curse, it’s you.  Even the Ministry of Magic would exonerate me for casting it.”
“Together? What do you mean ‘together’?  I know you’re still living together.”  Hermione asked with a puzzled look.
Draco was astonished.  The Chosen One had just disclosed to him that he’s gay.  Draco was shocked not only by Harry’s sexual orientation but also by Harry’s willingness to come out to his former enemy, the old rival who had used every possible device to make Harry’s life miserable.  Harry’s honest declaration indicated either that he trusted Draco or that he felt invulnerable to the homophobia that was rampant in the magical community.  Maybe both. Whatever the case might be Draco was impressed.
Draco sighed and said, “He has been living with his mother in Scotland.  Astoria and I had a rather serious row about three months ago, and we agreed that we needed some space from each other.  She insisted that I stay at the manor, while she took Scorpius with her to visit her aunt in Edinburgh.  I miss Scorpius a lot.”
*****
After moving into Malfoy Manor at the beginning of August, Harry, Draco, and Scorpius visited Devon a few times so that Draco and Scorpius could meet Harry’s children.  In a private conversation Harry had explained to Ginny that he and Draco were now a couple.  Her initial reaction was similar to her brother’s—shock and disbelief—but she eventually came around and treated Draco with civility.  Harry hoped that eventually she would act more warmly towards his lover.
“How about you? Did you come?” Draco asked.
“Like I never want us to be apart,” Draco said quietly.
“How about your day, Harry?” Draco asked.
Lifting his head up for a second, Harry yelled back, “Go for it!” then immediately returned to his task.
Draco immediately removed his hand from the top of Harry’s head.  Again Harry said, “Draco? What’s going on?”
Harry smiled and said, “Thanks, Ron. You’ve been my best mate forever.  You and my boyfriend have to get along.” Ron grunted his reply.
Harry could tell that Ron was a little less welcoming than his wife but was making an effort.  He greeted Harry with a handshake and a one-armed hug, then extended his hand to Draco and said, “Welcome, Malfoy, it’s been a while.  Heard you been keeping my good mate company.  How’s life?”
“No worries, Draco,” Harry said with a laugh.  “I’m not picking up any foul odor from you.  In fact, I quite like the smell of your cologne.”  Draco blushed.
“Is there anything you could tell Draco about your feelings that would feel less risky than saying ‘I’m in love with you’?” Keith asked.
“I don’t know how to describe it,” Harry said haltingly.  “Partners? Boyfriends? Lovers?”
“Very well then, Harry,” Dr. Mathey said with a kind smile. “Then I must insist you call me ‘Keith.’”
Draco remembered learning of Cedric’s death and attending his memorial service.  Reflecting on that period in his life, he also realized that he didn’t understand the enormity of the tragedy back then.  Death hadn’t yet touched Draco personally.  During his fourth year at Hogwarts, Draco still possessed that teenage feeling of invincibility and immortality.  Thinking about Cedric’s death now, he was struck by how devastating it must have been to his family and friends, and especially to Harry.  The least Draco could do would be to view Harry’s memory of the tragedy with him.
“What do you think that would look like, Harry?” Keith asked gently.  “What words would you like Professor Snape to say back to you?  Can you pretend to be him, responding to what you just told him?”
“Not as much as I like,” Harry admitted.  “But I try to apparate at the Whimple house at least once a week for lunch with the kids and spend at least one day each weekend with them.  They have stayed here a few times since the divorce, but it’s been a while since their last visit.  I think they find this ancestral home a bit gloomy and spooky, and they miss the beauty of the countryside.”
Harry felt the healing power of Draco’s words wash over him.  He continued to cry into Draco’s shoulder but a sense of comfort began to moderate his feelings of grief and despair. It made sense to him now why he had wanted so much for Draco to view this particular memory.  He had known on an intuitive level that Draco could and would provide the comfort he needed.
Hilda then said, “It was a real pleasure meeting you, Harry, and I look forward to working with you.  We wizards and witches need to work on our ability to heal mental and emotional wounds.  That’s why I’m so grateful for the opportunity to work with and learn from Keith.  I suspect today may have been a bit challenging for you, remembering and recounting painful episodes in your life.  With your permission I’d like to cast a Stamina charm to help restore your emotional energy.  Would that be OK?”
“I do want to get to know the Weasleys, I really do, but I’m pretty nervous about it,” Draco admitted.  “I haven’t exactly been the nicest to them over the years.”
“I’m glad, cariad,” Harry replied. “And I’m proud of you for apologizing for past behavior.  I could tell that won Ron over.”
“Can I see your scar?” Scorpius asked in the outspoken way that only children can get away with.
“You could say that,” Draco replied.  “I went to Edinburgh on my lunch break.  Astoria and I decided to get a divorce.”
Astoria nodded. With a tone of resignation she said, “To be brutally honest, Draco, I haven’t missed you either. I guess that means it’s over.”
As soon as Harry apparated in the drawing room of Malfoy Manor, he looked around to see who else was in attendance and immediately felt ill at ease.  He expected that he was persona non grata to many of the pureblood wizards who had allied themselves with the Dark Lord during the Second Wizarding War.  Draco, however, came to his rescue right away, extending his hand and saying, “Harry, thank you so much for coming.  Please come say hello to my mother.”
Scorpius and Albus got along famously from the beginning of their acquaintance.  The two little wizards were only a year apart in age and loved playing together.  They would rush around on their toy brooms, pretending to fly and creating elaborate fantasies in which they were the heroes in the midst of thrilling and perilous adventures.
“I can’t explain it, Draco,” Harry said, “but I keep wanting you to view this particular memory of mine.  It’s as though you’re the only person who can help me with it.  The problem is that the memory is very disturbing—it’s when I witnessed the death of our schoolmate, Cedric Diggory.  And apart from being concerned about how awful the memory is, I’m also aware that you recently lost your father. So I worry about how viewing the memory might exacerbate your own grief.”
“What you did was perfect,” Harry said. “You did ease my pain, and I’m forever grateful.  If there’s anything I can ever do to help you out, all you have to do is ask.”
Draco reflected for a moment and then said, “Pansy is the first person that comes to mind.  She’ll probably be cool with it, if a little surprised.  Astoria and Scorpius, of course.  Scorpius already loves you, and I expect Astoria will be amused by this development. I don’t imagine that Blaise will react well.  But Pike will react better than Blaise.  I dread telling my mother--she won’t react well, I can guarantee. You’re probably close to her worst nightmare—a half-blood gay wizard.  The only thing worse would be a total mudblood gay wizard or a Muggle.”
The topic of potions was a prime example.  It was Harry’s least favorite subject at Hogwarts, but he found himself intrigued and impressed by how much Draco knew about potions.  And Draco made the subject fascinating.  Harry thought that if Draco had been the Potions master at Hogwarts instead of Snape, Harry would have really enjoyed the class and learned so much more.
After Harry and Draco had exchanged messages via owl, they scheduled a meeting at the Ministry of Magic the following Monday morning.  As both men had expected, Lucius Malfoy’s suicide immediately became the top news story in the wizarding world, covered excessively and obnoxiously by The Daily Prophet and the other less popular, but still influential, magical tabloids.  Reporters were camped all around Malfoy Manor, desperate for glimpses of Draco and Narcissa.
“Draco, I can’t thank you enough for what you did today,” Harry said after they had apparated back at 12 Grimmauld Place.  “You don’t know how much you helped, how much comfort you gave me.”
“That is so amazing, Harry,” Hermione said in awe. “How did I have no idea about your independent study with Remus?”
“Yes,” Draco said. “They do sound like remarkable people.”  He had been raised to believe that the Weasleys were an inferior wizarding family.  He was experiencing a high level of cognitive dissonance. The kindness and love the Weasleys had shown Harry sounded so wonderful, in contrast to the cold, forbidding, and judgmental attitude with which the Malfoys treated everyone, including their own family members.  Draco’s mind was reeling, and he realized that he needed a break from this conversation.  He need time by himself to reflect.
“Not many,” Hermione admitted, “but I know of at least five in London.”
Narcissa was all politeness.  “Mr. Potter.  Thank you for coming.  It means a great deal to Draco and me.”
Hermione laughed out loud.  “Honestly, Harry,” she exclaimed. “But seriously, I think there’s a psychologist who could fit the bill.  His name is Keith Mathey and his understanding of magic is impressive, probably because he has a close relative who is a witch or wizard.  Dr. Mathey comes highly recommended by the staff at St. Mungo’s.  I’ve heard that he is one of the very few Muggles who have been invited to speak to hospital staff about mental and emotional health.  He has also collaborated with magical healers on some difficult cases, and surprisingly the healers expressed appreciation for Dr. Mathey’s assistance."
“Well, definitely not full disclosure,” Harry said.  “I’d have to go with one of the in-between ones. I’ll just go crazy if I say and do nothing.
Draco took a deep breath and said, “I don’t know.  It felt so good to hug you at my dad’s funeral and earlier today at the therapist’s office.  It felt right, you know?  The physical contact, I mean.”
Hermione then said to Harry, “I’ll go get supper ready and send Ron in.”
Draco nodded.  “What about Ginny and your other in-laws?”
Keith then asked, “What do you wish Professor Snape would say back to you, Harry?”
Harry filled out the forms as best he could, taking care to answer the questions as if he were a Muggle, not a wizard.  After all he didn’t know who, other than Dr. Mathey, might have access to the forms.  The forms also included information and questions related to payment of services.  Hermione had informed him that Dr. Mathey would negotiate a fee for his services after conducting an initial assessment of Harry’s concerns.  As Harry didn’t know how to answer the questions about payment, he left them unanswered.  He returned the forms to Ms. Gunn and said, “ I did the best I could, but there were some questions I couldn’t answer.”
Harry had made arrangements with Dr. Mathey for Hermione and Ron to join his next therapy session.  Keith warmly welcomed the couple and introduced them to Hilda.  He explained what their role was and how the session would proceed—Hermione and Ron would view selected memories that Harry had siphoned into the pensieve and then share with Harry any thoughts and feelings they wished to share.  Keith alerted the couple to the fact that viewing another person’s painful memories can be distressing, sometimes to the point of vicarious traumatization.  He assured them that he and Hilda would monitor the process and interrupt it if they observed any signs of excessive distress.  Keith also stated that he and Hilda would provide any support or debriefing the couple might need after viewing Harry’s memories.
“You’re welcome, Harry,” Draco replied. “I wanted to ease your pain and wasn’t sure what to do,” he admitted.
“So telling him would be a big risk,” Keith observed.
“I know, Ron,” Harry said in a conciliatory tone. “But for my sake please give Draco a chance.  He’s not the same person he was at Hogwarts.  If he were, I wouldn’t have fallen in love with him.  And he’s sorry for things he did and said in the past.  I know he is.  I need my friends and family to accept him and to support our relationship.  So please try for my sake?”
As soon as Draco said that he was up again and was pacing on the other side of the room, "Don't say that," he spoke harshly. "Th-," Draco tried to reason with him before getting interrupted again. "DON'T SAY THAT, DON'T SAY THAT ABOUT ME, DON'T USE THE WORD ABOUT ME!" and with that he broke down in tears again. "I'm sorry D," he said as he fell into the hug Draco offered him. They stood there for a while Draco felt like crying to, regardless of his feelings for Theo he was his best friend and it broke his heart seeing him in this much pain especially about something he had found so easy. "D, I don't know what I am and I don't want people to know anything yet," the other boy whispered to him. "Okay," this was the one thing he could relate to about everything Theo had said that night. "But, all I know is the cologne I smelt on you cloak tonight... It was yours," they both froze as he spoke those words.
He still had about twenty minutes before he was meeting Malfoy, he decided to just go up to the tower early. Once he got up there he sat down leaning against one of the railing looking at the view. He hadn't done this many times before, it really was beautiful and quite peaceful. He looked up at the moon, it was a full moon, he felt a hint of sadness at this fact as he knew what Remus would be going through at the moment. He thought about him, Sirius, the weasley's they'd all become his family over the past five years and he loved them all dearly. At that thought he heard someone start to walk up the stairs and he got up and started pacing again quickly trying to come up with something to say to the other boy who was hurriedly approaching.
