I cracked first, practically tackling him into a hug. I cried for a bit, too, and I choked out, “I’m
He slowly untied his tie, then unbuttoned his shirt and chucked it off. He stared at the big bruise on his chest, and hesitantly poked at it. It stung. He leaned over and dug through his trunk, looking for-
on it in a slightly darker color. I love it immediately, and pull it on over my pajamas. (My pajamas? Harry's pajamas?) It's warm and soft and exactly what I need. There's a tin in the package, too, and I open it. It's homemade fudge. Oh, god. I love fudge.
“Nnnnno…” he stutters out, and rolls over with a small yelp. He pushes his face into Harry's chest, and I watch as a few tears roll down his cheeks. He’s saying something, way too quiet for me to hear. I come back to my senses, and I start to cast a few healing charms on Draco, but there’s not much I can do.
She gave me a box of one of my favorite Honeydukes sweets, Caramel Cobwebs. I smile, at least I still can be friends with Pansy when I go back. I know she's got my back. Same with Blaise.
I’m dating the Chosen One.” I scowled and leaned in to kiss Harry. He responds immediately, as always, and slips his tongue into my mouth. I graze his bottom lip with my teeth, and he pushes me into the wall. I have a quick flashback to my first time with him.
I hear the door open loudly, and I crack an eye open and see Granger and Weasel. I hear her ask something, but I don’t bother to listen closely. I know I’m going to die at this point. I don’t have enough let for anything. Except Harry. I’ll do whatever I can to stay. For Harry. Just for Harry.
I was snapped out of it by Harry grabbing my leg and slinging in over his hip. It took all of my self-control to not start humping him.
“Ang said that I need to get there right now, if possible. So-” Harry was cut off for what felt like a millionth time.
And B. When the he saw Harry dive, he didn't even follow him. He knew that he had seen the Snitch, and that he would catch it. So Draco just stayed where he was, his eyes following Harry. And then, he thought,
but I try and not let it show. I knew Pansy shagged people regularly, and I'm fairly sure that she's shagged almost every male at this school that's 4th year and up, but I didn't know that she could walk up to anyone and say,
He was definitely quitting after this. The second that Marcus Flint could see past the red in his eyes after they lost, Draco would quit.
Draco felt the need to figure out what had upset Harry, and he said impulsively, "Do you know why he was upset, Seamus?"
Blaise and I were flipping through books, looking for anything that could help us. These books are our only hope (Until we go back to Hogsmeade) for helping Draco out. I look through a chapter titled
More fun stuff next chapter :) a bit of humor, hopefully, lots of fluff, and a bit of angst, cuz wtf would this story be without angst. Love you all! ❤️
Pansy frowned, and then grabbed Blaise's hand and started tugging him away. "Wait." I managed to choke out, and Pansy stopped and looked at me. "If... if Draco doesn't want to be with me... tell him that that's fine. I'll get over it, probably. And promise me that we'll all still hang out and be friends. Please." Pansy nodded quickly. "If that fucker doesn't want to stay with you, that's his fucking fault. He's missing out on one of the sweetest boys known to mankind. He'd be an
I find it in me to listen to Hermione and Harry. This is going to be the last few things I hear, and this might be better than dying in silence. Harry’s trying to save me. To bring me back. Even if he’s just doing it because of his savior complex, he’s still trying. He’s doing everything he can.
magazine. She's my little sister, who I spoiled and loved on. She was six. She looked enough like me that we could have been identical twins when I was her age...
A few people were shagging on top of boxes, or being fucked into the floor, completely laid out for everyone to see. Others were snogged into the walls, groping each other. Draco immediately made sure that none of them were Harry. He would have run out crying like a baby if any of them had been him. A few were laying on the floor, sprawled out, their eyes closed, and in the corner someone puked into a box. In the middle of the room, there was a circle or students, all sitting down, (Draco was sure that they probably couldn't stand) and lots of the Gryffindors were talking loudly, and they were all holding a mug, occasionally taking swigs from it. He spotted Harry's dark hair immediately, and next to him were a ginger and a brunette. Draco was thankful that they had their back to him.
have a fire blazing inside it. It has a long, low-backed sofa, and many armchairs. When I walk in, I'm surprised as to what I find. My mother is standing by a wall, and my father is standing by a armchair close to the fire. My Aunt Bella is also there. More dark figures are crowded by that high-back, dark red armchair. I make out one of their faces to be one of my father's friends.
"Well, they started out here, but then they started scaring people away, so I moved 'em upstairs. They don't seem to mind, but a few passed out on the stairs."
Oooooooooooh. It finally happened... KEEP IN MIND FOLKS THAT THERE WILL BE ABSOLUTELY no HINNY IN THE FINAL CHAPTERS. DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT. THERE WILl BE DRARRY, DRARRY, AND MORE DRARRY. Anyway, I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOUR RESPONSE TO THIS! Also, thank you so FUCKING MUCH to the most wonderful people, you go by the pseud nightlykudos, Malfoy25, Amora819, Drxxy_Fxnfiction, and last, BUT NOT LEAST, the wonderful, amazing, TayHawkes_91! LOVE YOU ALL SO MUCH! If you're worried about Pansy... please don't be. It will ALL work out. (Hint hint) LOVE YOU ALL! KEEP REVIEWING!
"Draco. The highest honor, as you know, is to join the Dark Lord. Today, it is your time to do that." The need to leave, to run, to get
“I… it’s been awkward, when I’ve talked to him. Either he leaves immediately, or we stand there, staring at the ground, not talking. He doesn’t look good, that I can tell you.”
Harry walked out onto the field, his head held high, and his face impassive. He lead the group, with Ron on his left, followed by his two beaters, Jimmy Peakes and Ritchie Coote, and Ginny on his right, behind her were Demezla Robins and Katie Bell. They moved in a V-Formation and, across the field, were the Slytherins. They met in the middle, and he watched out of the corner of his eye as Ron and Ginny tensed up. He determinedly did not look at Draco, who was on Marcus Flint's left side. Harry's face was a cold, hard, mask, and his body was taut with tension.
It was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little noises. A number of curious silver instruments stood on spindle-legged tables, whirring and emitting little puffs of smoke. The walls were covered with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, all of whom were snoozing gently in their frames. There was also an enormous, claw-footed desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind it, a shabby, tainted wizard's hat — the Sorting Hat. My eyes swept the room, looking for the Headmaster. He was sitting in a chair, to my left, along with- wait.
that Harry had looked up at him. For a second. It was enough to make him feel good. But now he thought that he was imagining it. He probably was. So he pretended, lied to himself, and said that he didn't feel anything,
I'm going to have to ignore him... when all I want is to run into his arms and kiss the living daylights out of him.
He would go back to their old rivalry, if that's what Draco wanted. And it seemed that he had made that part clear. (
She squealed, and then said, “Do you guys want to sneak out to Hog’s Head tonight? We could celebrate, if you know what I mean.”
I felt horrible, and I moved to give him a hug, and he slapped my hand away. “WHAT THE FUCK, DRACO?!” I screamed, jumping off the bed.
Hermione just wanted to leave with Harry and Ron, and to not come back. Studies be damned. To be safe, leave the war behind, and live their lives a little. Right now, the way things were going, Harry was being raised like a pig for slaughter. That wouldn't happen. Not while Hermione was alive. She thought about running to the Shrieking Shack, and apperating them away. To somewhere that was warm, with white sand and an ocean so wide that it went on forever. To somewhere
Once we reach the top, Snape pushes a door open and then sweeps in. I walk in, taking in the surroundings.
things with him, if you know what I mean. (*winks*) He wanted to find out who made Draco this way, and to deck them in the face. (
when he thought he saw Harry look at him. So he was now feeling like shit. Complete and utter shit. So he was mad at himself for not even making an
I lay back down on my bed, sighing. I really don't want to open the gift from Harry, but at the same time I want to. It just makes it
He wasn’t eating, and it looked as though he was going to fall asleep at the table. Harry wanted to go over and wrap an arm around him, pulling him into his chest, then rub his shoulders in just the way that Draco loved-
I find what I'm looking for eventually. I rip open the letter on the top open violently, and I watch as the letter falls to the floor. I stare at it, recognizing Harry's handwriting quickly. I think I know it better than my own. My hand darts down to grab it, and I read it quickly.
When Draco got up there, he couldn't believe his eyes. He was standing in a dusty room, the artificial light flooding his senses, holey white sheets covering the windows, and boxes scattered all over. But the appearance of the room was not what he was thinking about. It was the teens.
I've always wanted a Firebolt. Father says that I already have a good enough broom, no matter how much I beg. It's unlike him to not get me anything I want... but not unheard of.
I murmured the password, and then stepped through. I was almost out of the Common Room when someone grabbed my arm. I spun around with so quickly it made my head spin.
if I shared an Alpha’s personal information. No joke.” Harry nodded, yet again, and then said, “It’s a fucked up system.” Angelina seemed glad that Harry agreed, and then said, “That it is.” She opened up a folder, and then said, “I think that you should read the files after you figure out whether their scent is compatible with yours. Just, you know, as a privacy thing, even though it’s legal for you to read all up on them. I guess you could refuse me, though,” she ended, her voice turning cold.
"My sister-" she stopped to draw in a quick breath. "Samantha- she accidentally consumed poison, a very rare one- and the only cure is Unicorn eye! A fucking Unicorn hasn't been seen in years!
of when Harry and him used to play Seeker's Games. Just them and the Snitch. Draco would never admit that Harry was better than him. He was, though. He won almost ever time.
His warm breath fanned out across my face, and I closed my eyes. “Yes…” I give a tiny sigh. “Do I have to? Why can’t I just spend Christmas here at Hogwarts?” Harry just shook his head a bit, and then replied, “You always spend Christmas with your parents. How would they react if you said, “Hey Mom and Dad, I want to spend Christmas at Hogwarts for the first time ever because I’m dating Harry Potter. Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about that. The fact that I’m gay as fuck
He hit the stone floor with a thud. His head was spinning and there was a sharp pain in his ribs and his wrist.
hopeless. I can't even make a dramatic exit without grabbing my boyfriend. I'm so needy. We eventually made it to the train station in Hogsmeade. It was filled with students, all chatting, and some were clutching there cats so hard I thought that they might die of suffocation. Harry leaned down and kissed me quickly, not making a scene of it. I pulled him into a hug, and he whispered, "I'll miss you. But I'll make due for a bit. See you soon. Enjoy Christmas with your parents." I pushed my mouth up to his ear and whispered, "I'll miss you, so much, baby." I stopped, unsure of what to say. "I wish I didn't have to go." I muttered under my breath. Harry gave me one of his famous smiles, and said, "Enjoy it. Not everyone lives in a mansion." I smirked a bit, and then I heard the boarding call for the train. Harry leaned in to kiss me once more, squeezed me hard, and then stepped back. I got on the train with a sad smile. I got into a compartment towards the back, hoping no one else would decide to come in. I stared out the window. My thoughts were running along the lines of
Harry still remembers everything about Hogwarts. Okay, it’s only been around two years, but two years is a long time. Especially after the Ministry trying to sort out the Wizarding World, which seemed to take forever. Although, they
It brings almost instant relief, and so he gets up, knowing he only has about five minutes till the spell wears off. That’s the thing about this spell, it wears off quickly. Draco tried using it multiple times in one day, once, and it had dire effects. (Including nausea, sore throat, and every other terrible thing you can think of.) (Okay, not
His arm was an angry red, and there were a few cuts. The blood mixed with the water, it ran red, and Draco couldn’t tear his eyes away from it.
Neville stood up, and walked to Malfoy. He just simply kicked Malfoy's crumpled up form, and walked in the direction that the Golden Trio had gone. Lots of Gryffindors (And a few Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs) (Most of the people from other houses that left were in the DA) got up and left. When Luna breezed past him, she said "I would insult you for hurting one of my five friends, but I can see the guilt eating you up inside... it's enough of a punishment for anyone. Good day to you, Draco. And be careful for Snacklepuffs. They're particularly vicious this time of year," she said in her dreamy, high, voice.
Pansy stopped for a second, calming down, deciding if she was going to agree with me, or beat me into a pulp.
“YOU’RE GETTING MARRIED, ‘MIONE!” Ron shouts, and I think the whole castle would of heard him if ‘Mione hadn’t done a silencing charm.
Please HIT THAT KUDOS BUTTON AND MAKE SOMEONE'S DAY! PLEASE? ALSO, EVEN BETTER, :) COMMENT! THAT MAKES MY DAY!!!!! Also, positive comments give me motivation to write! (I will delete critisicm, as I want to keep this fic positve, since it's just for fun) Type a few words and keep this story going! Ok, thanks!
And then it starts to get hotter. There’s a warm feeling in my arms and chest, almost as if someone had started to concentrate heat there. It doesn’t feel uncomfortable at first, but then it goes from pleasantly warm, hot, and then to uncomfortably hot. I want to scream, it feels like someone set me on fire, but then the feeling subsides and it feels like someone poured sunshine into my veins. It feels good, warm, and if I could bottle this feeling and keep it forever I would. My eyes are closed, and I enjoy the warmth, but then it cuts off. It leaves me feeling cold. empty, and hurt. The pain is back, more so in my legs. But that’s not the first thing that I think about. It’s the fact that the warm hands that were holding me are now gone.
nice of you to show up!" my aunt said quickly, in her high-pitched, girly, over-excited manner. I nodded at her, still unsure of what I was seeing. I pushed my face into a cold mask. My father turned and faced me, as did my mother. When I looked at my mother's face I gave a small gasp. It wasn't audible, but I did it anyway. There were dark circles under my mother's eyes, and her face was creased with a worried and pained expression. "Draco." my father drawled in his cold manner, his eyes blank. I nodded, walking closer. "We have a very esteemed guest here, today." I nodded again. The tension was so thick in the air you could feel it. Everyone was tense, except for my Aunt Bella. She was smiling, seemingly excited. She was swishing her wand back and forth, a maniac smile on her face. I wondered again who was in the chair, but I kept silent. I was polite, like I was taught to be. Then, a high, cold, voice broke the silence. "Draco." I felt dread wash over me in a wave.
he thought to himself. Harry, replied, “Angelina, I know what’s good for my health. Of course I’ll listen to you.” Angelina gave him a bright smile, and then said, “This way,” and headed out of the room, coffee cup in her right hand, wand in her left. Harry followed next to her, on her left, hands in his pockets. Angelina turned her head so that she could talk to him. “So, we had to put him in a magical coma around a week ago. He was stressing himself out too much, and as you know, that’s not good for an Omega’s health.” Harry murmured an agreement. “Sorry I didn’t tell you.” Harry said, “It’s all good, Ang.”
"Anyway, Draco, as much as I've enjoyed this little conversation, I'm sure that Harry would like an arrogant tosser like you out of his face. By the way, ferret, don't expect to have any friends in Gryffindor. They're all mad at you. Who wouldn't be? You're a fucking prick, and Harry's right. He should have never dated you."
He slipped off his shoes, tugged his socks off, and then unbuckled his belt. He threw them on the floor, and then slid his trousers off. He grabbed the red and gold pajama pants that were on the very top of his trunk and pulled them on.
An owl tapped at his window, and Harry got up to open the window. The owl flew in, cold air gushing in with it, and landed on Harry’s shoulder.
I gave him a dramatic sigh, and cast a levitation charm on my trunk. I started to storm out of the room, but not before grabbing Harry's hand to drag him alone with me. Oh, I am
Hey guys! Just a quick thing, I know this chapter doesn’t center on Draco, but next chapter will. Also, the first part of the chapter takes place after classes, and right before dinner. Second part is dinner, but that should be obvious once you read it. So, guys, NEXT CHAPTER IS THE CLIMAX! Eek! Anyway, thank you guys for reviewing! It’s so great to hear from you!
Ron’s face lit up. “Really? Maybe this’ll be the one, Harry!” Everyone else in the room looked up at that.
much harder to cut things off with him. But at the same time I'm a needy bitch that wants to open it. So I do, because I'm pathetic.
“You- you were gone, and I- I don’t know why I freaked out. I just- I just... I just did. That isn’t normal, Pans.”
Oh, fuck you, parents. I probably would be being fucked senseless right now, if I had stayed. Really, Harry probably would have had to carry me everywhere. Oh, those were the times. I had a brief flashback to the first weekend that we had fucked so much that I couldn't walk, and I was so sore that Harry carried me to all of my classes that Monday.
"WHAT DID I EVER DO TO HIM?" Harry roared, quiet enough that the rest of the hall couldn't hear, but loud enough that some of the Gryffindors turned their heads towards him.
we're out. They're hardcore drinkers, they are. And they're all drunk to hell and back. All of them are either passed out on the floor, puking on each other, are shagging right next to everybody, drinking mug after mug, or are talking wildly, and laughing their butts off."
"Hey, Healer Weasley," Harry said, deciding to be polite and call her by her official name. She smirked at him, and said, "Please, Harry I ask that you refrain from that shit well in my office." Harry laughed, and she laughed right along with him. Good to know that his old Quidditch Captain was still herself. “Would you like some coffee, Harry?” she said, swivelling her chair so that it faced the opposite direction from her desk, and facing a small plastic folding table that had a coffee machine on it, along with some styrofoam cups and some cream. Harry muttered a, “Yes, please,” and Angelina poured some coffee into a styrofoam cup and asked, “Cream?” Harry shook his head, and Angelina handed it to him. He took a big gulp, downing all of the coffee in the small cup in one go.
honor, Draco. You should be running over here to get your mark! There is no refusing the Dark Lord." I just stand there. It stays like this, and then there is a soft hissing noise. I watch as a huge snake glides to the armchair. Oh. It's Nagini. The Dark Lord's snake. I nod stiffly after a bit. It's Death Eaterism or death. I want to live. But I don't want to become a disgusting Death Eater. I walk over to the armchair, and my father smiles. "Good, Draco," the Dark Lord says. "You have made the right decision." Auntie Bella gives a high-pitched squeal. "
Hermione locked eyes with Draco. You couldn't have looked away from her intense gaze if you wanted to.
I stopped for a moment, my anger stopped in it’s tracks, (A very rare thing) and my mouth hung open. Draco looked up at me, his eyes wide.
“I... I think... I don’t know, Gorgeous. I... Harry will come around when he’s ready, right?” Hermione bits on her bottom lip, a habit of hers when she’s nervous. I lean down and search for my cigarettes in my bag. I pull one out and light it. I only smoke when I’m really worried. I really shouldn’t have done this, but when I look up, Hermione is sighing.
“We should probably go to DADA… ugh, I don’t think I can deal with Snape right now.” Hermione said. Pansy held on tighter, and Hermione started to remove herself. Pansy just whimpered, and she held on tighter. Hermione just gave into her, sighing, and said, “If Snape asks, I’m out sick. Bad cramps.” I nod, and then sigh. Girls can
I mean, who gets five gigantic boxes of pranks? I want to ask him about that, but if I get my way I'll either never talk to him again, or I'll magically go back in time and stay at Hogwarts for Christmas. Really, if I had just stayed this could have all been avoided till summer. I'd have had just
Draco shakes his head, trying to get the memory of seeing Harry's Patronus for the first time out of his head, and asks "Where are they?"
Hey guys! If you’re new, welcome to my story, and if you’ve been reading it since I put it out, welcome back! Anyway, enjoy this really short, sad chapter. (This was more just something that was a small note in the story...) (It helps you understand later on.) Also, I just wanted to say what Pansy was wearing, because I am obsessed with her fashion sense. (Sorry guys if I’ve went into too much detail on this type of stuff.) She’s wearing a cropped, dark green, long sleeved shirt. It had thin green stripes that are a bit lighter than the dark green. She’s wearing very skinny skinny jeans, and they’re black. Also, her favorite combat boots, because I have a head cannon that those are basically her babies. (Lol) And also, she has a few other piercings. Double piercings on her ears, in the traditional spot, and on her left ear a black bar, and on her right two silver rings further up on her ear. She also has a bellybutton ring. And she’s wearing black lipstick. Okay, WAY too much on Pansy, I think, but I enjoy creating her outfits. Ha. Anyway, ENJOY THE CHAPTER!
I find what I'm looking for eventually. I rip open the letter on the top open violently, and I watch as the letter falls to the floor. I stare at it, recognizing Harry's handwriting quickly. I think I know it better than my own. My hand darts down to grab it, and I read it quickly.
The curtains are suddenly drawn away, and I want to hiss. The sunlight stings my eyes, and I try to throw a hand up to block it. Tiny hot streaks of pain shoot up my arm, feeling like it's going to fall off because of the pain, or if not, I'll rip it off myself.
that can't be right. It isn't. We haven't fought seriously since Draco said that he was worried about all of my fucking brushes with death. And I told him 'who else is going to save the fucking world?' That was the first time we broke up. We got together at the beginning of the year... and it was in October when we broke up the first time. It's basically been smooth sailing from there. Well, we got in shouting matches sometimes, but no one agrees on everything, and we didn't ever fight on such a major scale. According to Pansy, Draco had a harder time with breaking up with me than I did, and he was fucking scared because I went back to the way things were, (Aka 3rd year hatred of each other) and I acted like everything was fine and I was fine and I didn't give a fuck about him. I made sure to tell him how much he meant to me after I heard that. But I never told him that I knew about that, though. We try not to keep secrets from each other, but we can have a pretty rocky relationship. After the break up, we've mostly been all lovey dovey, though. I like that much better. He's shy, and always is scared that I'll push him away. (Not that that would
"Go to fucking hell, you bitchy fucking ferret," Hermione said, and her voice was like liquid nitrogen, and then she helped the ginger pull Harry's shaking form out of the Great Hall. The Hall was dead quiet, no one was moving. Not even the teachers. (You'd think they'd been Confunded.) It stayed this way for a bit, and then Ginny stood up. She walked over to Draco, and then kneed him in the balls. He fell to the ground, pulling his knees into his chest and wrapping his arms around them.
Hello Guys! Welcome to my fic! It's going to be long, and I swear to God I will do everything in my power to finish it. I already have it planned out, and it should all come together. SO, BEFORE WE START THIS! WARNING: DO NOT READ THIS IF SUICIDE ATTEMPTS, CUTTING YOURSELF, AND DEPRESSION ARE SOMETHING YOU CAN'T/SHOULDN'T READ!!!! Really, turn back now if that make you uncomfortable/triggers you. So, after that dreary warning, welcome to my sad little fic where Draco and Harry are super happy, Draco gets his dark mark and feels like he is complete fucking shit, and pushed Harry away. LOTS OF ANGST. Anyway, enjoy!
been gay since they were eleven. I still don't understand why you shagged me during fifth year, though... you were after Potter then. Well, I guess I'll just have to go and seduce someone. Maybe I should shag Goldstein... he's nice-looking, and good at shagging, too."
and want to run away screaming, I'm going to stay here because you didn't really have a choice and you're my friend'."
He hadn’t really been thinking properly when he rushed past Harry and the fucking Weaslette, so, there he was, tumbling down the stairs. He tried to protect his head, because even though he had a death wish, he would rather not die of head related injury. Case closed. He let out a whimper when a sharp crack of pain flashed through his ribs, and started to wonder if he just hadn’t noticed how many stairs there were, or he was just falling really, really, slowly.
“You shouldn’t smoke, Pans... but I think it’s explainable right now... You know how bad it is for you... you know what, give me one.”
Hi everyone! Welcome back! First off, this is a sad chapter. *Cries* It will get better. (In QUITE a few chapters.) Kinda cute? Maybe? Idk. And second of all, THANK YOU SO MUCH TO Kaijawitch and OaK for the lovely reviews! AND A EVEN BIGGER THANK YOU TO THE LOVELY Goblet_of_fire4 FOR BEING GIVING ME SUCH AMAZING REVIEWS! THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU! Love you guys. Enjoy the chapter. 😉
“Hermione and I talked about this, and if you’d been listening earlier you would know that we don’t want a big wedding. Just our family, you, Harry, Ron, maybe Luna, a few other Gryffindors, and honestly, I’m not inviting any of the girls that I share a dorm with. They’re all stuck-up, spoiled brats.”
Harry’s relationship with Ginny, since that had broken up, had been very platonic. He couldn’t think of her any other way, even if he tried to. Ginny was very much a person that showed their love through physical affection, so Harry was used to all the hugs and kisses and handholding. That was just the way Ginny was.
Pansy was practically bouncing around the room. She stopped, gave me a serious look, and said, “Is that a problem?”
I thought this bathroom was abandoned. I would have decided to end it somewhere else if I had known that…
His eyes were wild, and it was the expression of someone who was utterly helpless, terrified, worried, hopeless, and scared.
Ron was thinking about how if Harry wanted to hurt the twitchy little ferret, he wouldn't be able to stop him. No one could. He might even die...
I'm ready to be done with it all. Harry lashing out is completely understandable. I would do the same. It gave me a painful reminder of why I had to leave him. I only cause him pain.
“But she also said she was 100% sure that he wouldn’t come. So. Uh, yeah. Stop worrying, Harry. He mostly likely won’t come.”
out of the Common Room, his robes billowing out behind him, I follow, and shoot Blaise a nervous look.
I glance back at Blaise, and his face has harden, as if he was preparing for battle. I suppose we are, so I harden my face, too. I storm into Draco's room. And he's sitting on his bed, all balled up. He sees me, and jumps off his bed, wiping his face and then hardening it. I drop Blaise's hand and then storm over to him. I grab his shoulders and shake him. (Maybe I was trying to shake some sense into him?)
Maybe I should just avoid him. That seems like the best option. Much better than my other choices...
He set a tray on the nightstand next to my bed, bowed, and then scurried out. I looked over and found that it was steak, potatoes, and broccoli. There was a goblet, and a fork, knife, and spoon.
O M G, I'm so sorry, I've been gone for WAY too long. Like, three+ weeks? Okay, so here's what you guys should know. Two hours ago I had no intention of completing this fic, it was dead to me. And, somehow, it came back to life? Idk, guys.  So please enjoy this short chapter, knowing that this fic could have been COMPLETELY abandoned. I'll write a longer one later. Love y'all!
And finally, more Obsessed_with_drarry, who has been such a wonderful commenter that I can't even start on how lovely she is. Anyway, thank you guys!
Honestly, wet dreams. Such an unpractical thing, but now I can appreciate them. That's the only time I get to have sex, since... Well, I'd rather not go down more painful pathways, but I've been fucking horny and this is a good thing. Closest to the real thing, even if it's all fake. I'd rather have to orgasm in my pants than to go without it at all.
He took a second to notice that Harry was staring forward with a very bored expression, and so was Ron. Neither of their eyes moved, and Draco was sure that they were decidedly not looking at him.
Harry walked into St. Mungo's, and headed straight towards a 'Welcome Witch'. He noted the sign that said,
He stared at the tattoo that was etched into his skin. He started to scrub the skin raw, and it hurt. But Draco felt like that’s what he deserved. So he kept scrubbing, scrubbing, scrubbing…
“Aha! Right here.” She placed the key in the lock, twisted it, and then pulled the key out and set it in her pocket.
"Hi, I need to see Dr. Johnson as soon as possible." Harry said, with a blinding smile. The girl's face fell, obviously she thought that he was mated to Ang.
I've been thinking about how I'm going to break up with him. I don't want to come back and kiss him, make him think things are fine. But I don't want to break up with him the second I see him. So... I could... I could...
I walked into the manor, looking around. I had forgotten how big it was. Harry was right. I am a lucky fucker. I through the house, and a house elf came and took my trunk upstairs, presumably to my bedroom. I strolled through the many rooms in the house, vaguely heading towards my mother's favorite sitting room. I walked through a room full of big oil painting. I knew that they were priceless, and we had at least ten the room. I don't think that you can get much richer than that. Harry's made me realize just how good I have it. I open the door to the dark sitting room that my mother spends most of her time in. It's a big room, all dark and made of dark blues, reds, and blacks. It has a huge fireplace, and I have yet to see it
Harry was surprised that she didn't faint right then and there. She collected herself, and smiled at him. Harry, in response, winked. Why Harry did this? It was fun to just casually flirt. If the new Omega didn't work out, she wouldn't be half bad.
Oh, fuck. Stop it, Draco. You really should stop thinking about all of those great times with Harry. If I kept this up, I would be lost in memories all of the time. And that can't happen.
I put my hand up in front of me, trying to prevent Pansy from kicking the living daylights out of me.
But he was weak. He glanced at Malfoy quickly, out of the corner of his eye, and what he saw made him feel worried. Very, very, worried.
been a lot of stress, being ‘The Chosen One’ and all, but yet, Harry missed it. He missed hanging out by the lake with all of his friends, talking about small things like there wasn’t a war going on.
Harry's the fucking Chosen One. He's the one who'll destroy Voldemort. Who will put all of the Death Eaters in Azkaban, or kill them.
He wasn't surprised by the absence of the Slytherins, as they always went to Hog's Head, where you could get drunk off your arse and no one would care, even if you were thirteen. But the Gryffindors always came here. Gryffindors practically lived here when they were in Hogsmeade.
Draco had stumbled across that spell in a book that was almost older than time itself. It came from the first Malfoys library. Draco thinks that the spell has been forgotten.
I roar, all of my rage flying out like it's been pent up for years. I shake him harder, and then I press my forehead against his. "WHAT WERE YOU DOING, LEAVING US HANGING LIKE THAT?! WHAT WERE YOU DOING LEAVING
She gave me a box of one of my favorite Honeydukes sweets, Caramel Cobwebs. I smile, at least I still can be friends with Pansy when I go back. I know she's got my back. Same with Blaise. Even if Pansy's dating Hermione...
AHHHHHHHHHHHH! I FINALLY did something right! I’m throwing happiness around like confetti rn. *throwing confetti* HAPPINESS TO YOU, HAPPINESS TO YOU, HAPPINESS TO- *hits some baby in the face* oops. My bad.
I mean, I know that the world doesn't revolve around me. (I may forget it at times, though...) But really. Come on. I just got added to the biggest group of fucking bullies. Against my fucking will.
“Again, Blaise, that’s besides the point.” she spits in my direction, fiddling with her emerald ring.
good." she spits out in her insane voice. I kneel down in front of the chair. I don't make direct eye contact with the Dark Lord, but I watch as he draws his wand. I glance over at my Mother, and her expression is pained as ever. I glance at my Father, who's expression is blank. Auntie Bellatrix's is excited. The Dark Lord pushes up my sleeve. His hands are cold, and I want to recoil instantly. His hands feel gross on my skin, and it repulses me. It takes all of my will to stay were I am. I am replaced by a blank numbness, there is nothing in my heart. It's like my insides are filled with ice. The Dark Lord puts his wand to my left forearm. My last thought before the pain is
Hi everyone! I am back, and I would seriously like to apologize, I haven't updated really since August, and that's a horrible thing in my mind. I will, drumroll please, be revamping the fic! And finishing it! I’m going to go back and fix up all the old chapters, and if you want to reread them go ahead, since the plot might change a bit, and my writing has gotten better. I promise, swearing on my fucking life, that I will do everything I can to finish this fic. I’m only going to be updating weekly (with a few exceptions), and I hope that’ll help me get back into the hang of things. Y’all have been so sweet, and I can’t wait to read more of your lovely comments and get to know you again. Here’s a little sneak peak into what will come after I update the old chapters!
. Sometimes, if I close my eyes, I can almost smell the warm smell that is Harry. It's hard to explain, it's just warm. I want to wrap myself in a blanket of it. My pajamas don't smell like him, though, no matter how hard I try to imagine it. I stole this weeks ago. I don't honestly know why my Mother grabbed these certain ones. They're the red and gold of Gryffindor. But I don't give a fuck as to
When Draco was in the shower, he felt more relaxed. He let the hot water work it’s magic, and it always calmed him down. The familiar scents were comforting, and it felt nice to wash his hair. But, of course, Draco was busy remembering the time that Harry had washed his hair, and how nice it had felt. How he had slowly worked his fingers through his hair, rubbing his skull, and then rinsed it out gently. He had pulled Draco close, and the warm water hit his back as he stood there, rubbing circles over Draco’s shoulders. It had felt so nice…
time. You are special, Draco. I believe you are ready. Or, of course, if you refuse, I will kill you. So, I suppose it's this or death... Or I suppose your parents would satisfy my need to kill, too. Your choice, Draco."
That's the only way to describe it. It's like my insides are coated with nothing, nothing, and more nothing. The silent tears are rolling down my face, and I think that I'm not even cutting straight.
"We broke up. It would have been too hard to stay in a relationship with her being gone every other week."
I pick up the knife, and lay back down. I push up my right sleeve. I haven't taken off my pajamas my mother put me in after I passed out that day. I can't look at the skin on my left arm. I haven't looked at the Dark Mark. So that means I haven't showered in three days. (I normally shower every day.) I stare at my left arm for long periods of time, though. It switches between that and the ceiling.
I listened to the song Home, by Cavetown the whole time I wrote this chapter, so go check it out, it’s a great song. (Sad, though.)
Okay, you’re all probably all wondering why I went into such detail on what Pansy was wearing, and what she looked like, but I just want you to get a good sense of what she looked like in my story. I’ll probably do it with all of my other characters, too. (Lol)  Also, I wanted to point out that there is nothing romantic between Pansy and Draco, Pansy just always uses pet names for Draco. Haha. REVIEW REVIEW REVIEW!
That’s a bit too much for my brain, at the moment, and I just nodded, and then said, “Only if you’ll help me, ‘Mione.”
So Draco walked through the castle, his broom and things that he had in his locker in his hands, and eventually made it to the portrait hole.
personal information.” Harry nodded, not sure if he should laugh or be serious. “Seriously, Harry, I could get
Well, it's been a long time, hasn't it, folks? I'd like to apologize, I've been puking my guts out for a while now. I'm finally better, and I only had it in me to respond to a few comments when I wasn't puking, or sleeping. So if you will excuse my absence, I'm going to try and post as many fucking chapters as possible today! Yay! So, please, COMMENT, REVIEW, TELL ME HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS, and so on. Well, let's get into the chapter, shall we? Also, shout-outs are at the end.
Harry glanced over at Draco, who was sitting at the edge of the Slytherin table, all by himself. His head was lowered, so Harry couldn’t get a good look at his face, but he had come to the conclusion that Draco was just really
"So, that brings me to the question. Your Mother has come to bring you back to your manor. I said we shall give you a choice as to whether you want to leave or not. If you do choose to leave, we will have lessons arranged for you so as you can come back. If you choose to stay, we can have it arranged so you can leave on the weekends to visit your family and sister."
He set a tray on the nightstand next to my bed, bowed, and then scurried out. I looked over and found that it was steak, potatoes, and broccoli. There was a goblet, and a fork, knife, and spoon.
Hey guys! I’m really sorry, I’m going camping again and I won’t be back until Saturday. HANG IN THERE! Normal updating will resume after I get back.
I was also thinking about how if I had stayed, we probably would have fucked so much that I couldn't walk.
hopeless. I can't even make a dramatic exit without grabbing my boyfriend. I'm so needy. We eventually made it to the train station in Hogsmeade. It was filled with students, all chatting, and some were clutching there cats so hard I thought that they might die of suffocation. Harry leaned down and kissed me quickly, not making a scene of it. I pulled him into a hug, and he whispered, "I'll miss you. But I'll make due for a bit. See you soon. Enjoy Christmas with your parents." I pushed my mouth up to his ear and whispered, "I'll miss you, so much, baby." I stopped, unsure of what to say. "I wish I didn't have to go." I muttered under my breath. Harry gave me one of his famous smiles, and said, "Enjoy it. Not everyone lives in a mansion." I smirked a bit, and then I heard the boarding call for the train. Harry leaned in to kiss me once more, squeezed me hard, and then stepped back. I got on the train with a sad smile. I got into a compartment towards the back, hoping no one else would decide to come in. I stared out the window. My thoughts were running along the lines of
no. This just keeps getting worse and worse.” Blaise nodded slowly, and then replied, “What are we going to tell the Golden Trio?” I sigh, throwing myself down next to Blaise dramatically.
Just a really, really, really sad fucking chapter which made me cry and I am now tearing my own heart out SOMEONE HELP ME! Just sad, guys. There’s like under ten more angsty   chapters in this fic, so please... just try not to cry. I fucking dare you.
I mean, who gets five gigantic boxes of pranks? I want to ask him about that, but if I get my way I'll either never talk to him again, or I'll magically go back in time and stay at Hogwarts for Christmas. Really, if I had just stayed this could have all been avoided till summer. I'd have had just
I open the package, and it's an amazing eagle feather quill. I think she must have seen me eyeing Harry's... I love it.
I muttered a quick incantation for dreamless sleep, and Ron made a move to pick Harry up once the hurt noises stopped. I helped him pull Harry into his arms, and then stepped back. We walked through the halls, not saying a word. My emotions were swirling around, and I couldn't sort them out. It was a ball of emotion, all knotted together and impossible to sort out. Form the look on Ron's face, that was how he was feeling, too.
look a bit better than Blaise, but not by much. Hermione went over to Pansy immediately and wrapped her arms around her, stroking her hair. Blaise slumped against the wall, tipping his head back.
I give a quick nod, and then give Harry a hug. “We should go, Pans. Curfew is in a few minutes.” Blaise says, and I nod.
“I- you- you were- I woke up- and- and- and you- you were- gone- and I- I- started to- to- panic- and- and then- I- I- started crying- and- I felt- felt like- there- there was- there wasn’t anything- anything happy- and- and- I felt- I felt like- felt like- like I- don’t- don’t want to- want to-
Harry is staring at the floor unblinkingly. I’m afraid he’s going to burn a hole in it. I give him a sad look, and then Blaise tugs me out of Ron and Harry’s dorm, and then through the Common Room, and out the portrait hole.
A look of horror came over his face, and then he whimpered. The tears picked back up up, and eventually his body was being racked by angry sobs.
I feel Harry’s hands on my chest. His hands are so warm, and I’m so cold all of the time now. It’s like stepping in the shower after being out in the cold.
Haha, I think the first notes were longer than the chapter. LONGER CHAPTER WILL COME SOON! Okay, just wanted to get a few things out of the way. Pansy was sitting in the library, and if any of you have watched the movies, can you remember back to when Harry is looking and Romilda Vane and being like, “But I AM the Chosen One.” Hope you can. That’s where Pansy is sitting. K? Ok. If you guys haven’t watched the movies, it’s basically just a slab of wood built into the wall of the library. Haha. Okay, also, Draco has shortish hair in this fic, I guess. Hermione’s hair is more curls than bushy, also. Harry’s is black and curly and messy and it has a habit of always sticking up. Ron’s is just... Ron’s? Yeah. Anyway, IF I GET FOUR COMMENTS I WILL POST A CHAPTER EVERY DAY! YOU CAN DO IT! Love you guys!
It hurt just a bit to crawl around on the stone floor, if you could even call it a crawl. It was more dragging himself around.  He couldn’t stand the sharp flashes that he was getting every few seconds, so he cast a temporary pain relief spell.
"That's for hurting Harry," she said, her voice angry and it was almost like it her words were burning Draco's skin. She then walked out of the Hall gracefully, tossing her hair over her shoulder.
He gave me a small nod, and I kissed his forehead. I headed out of the room, (Still strutting like I wasn’t dead tired...) marching straight towards my bathroom.
I was sure that I had never run this fast before. My legs were pumping, and I felt like I was flying. But that wasn’t the point.
He dismissed the thought and tried to sit up, letting out a small whimper at the pain in his head, and then he screeched “Dammit!” when he shifted something in his ribs and it caused a hot, sharp pain to run through him with a vengeance. He cradled his wrist against his chest, and then started to crawl.
A. He had just quit Quidditch, one of his favorite things, or used to be favorite things. He had no clue what his father would say about this. And he felt really, really crummy. He had just quit Quidditch because he was too scared to face Harry. And because it reminded him
that it left Harry breathless. He immediately picked out the minty scent, which confused him, because
I pick up the knife, and lay back down. I push up my right sleeve. I haven't taken off my pajamas my mother put me in after I passed out that day. I can't look at the skin on my left arm. I haven't looked at the Dark Mark. So that means I haven't showered in three days. (I normally shower every day.) I stare at my left arm for long periods of time, though. It switches between that and the ceiling.
I’m surprised, but I recover quickly, and and hand her one. She puts it in her mouth, and I light it for her. She takes a deep drag, and then pulls it out of mouth.
HANGING LIKE THAT?! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT FUCKED HIM UP? I AM GOING TO KICK YOUR BITCHY FACE IN UNLESS I GET A GOOD REASON FOR IGNORING ME? FOR IGNORING YOU FUCKING BOYFRIEND, WHO WAS PRACTICALLY SALIVATING WAITING FOR YOU TO COME BACK! WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU THINKING, DRACO?!"  Draco started crying at some point during me shouting at him. The sobs were racking his body, and I felt a little bad for yelling at him so much. I leaned in and hugged him. He sobbed into my shoulder, and rubbed his back. I felt bad for yelling at him, but I still wanted an answer. "I still want an answer, you know..." Draco just sobbed harder at that, and then he said, "I- I- you- you- you can't tell anyone- not even Hermione- or Ron- or
He was walking into the hall, his head low, and if you looked closely, you could see the shadows in his eyes.
I mean, I’ve never been particularly good at anything, except DADA, I suppose. So to be magically powerful? That’s just a bit much.
That letter had me crying for hours. It's tear-stained now, and I laid down and cradled it to my chest, trying to absorb all the love Harry put in the letter. I crawl to the edge of my bed and grab the package that Mrs. Weasley gave me, and I open it. It's a darkish green sweater, with a
“Oh, I was wondering if you wanted to sneak out and go get drinks with Hermione, Ron, Harry, and I? We were thinking about going to Hog’s Head.”
Suddenly, out of the blue, Harry slammed his fist down on the table. Ron nearly choked, and Hermione almost fell out of her seat.
Blaise shakes his head again, and then says, “No, it won’t. At least probably not. Have you met Harry? He’ll get past it. Eventually. It’s more
It's satisfying, cutting. I watch the blood drip down my arm and onto the black sheets. No one will notice the stain. I feel the pain, and I enjoy it, almost. I feel like I got what I deserve. I do it again. And again. And again, again, again, again.
I place the blade horizontally across my wrist, and then push push in. It hurts a lot, and I feel a few involuntary sobs work their way out of my throat. The tears slip down my cheeks, and I try to not cry. I keep pushing, going directly under my mark, and lift up once I reach the end. It’s so bloody that I can’t see anything, and, even though I don’t really care, I don’t want to die just yet. So I mutter a healing charm, and it barely works. It seals the cut a bit, stops the bleeding a tad, and I stare at my arm. I peel the bit of skin that I cut off up, and there’s more blood. If the Mark works like a Muggle tattoo, it’s only inked into the top layer of skin, and I cut that off, so it shouldn’t be there anymore, should it? I hope that I got rid of it… then I could be free. Nothing holding me back. I could go back to the way things used to be…
His warm breath fanned out across my face, and I closed my eyes. “Yes…” I give a tiny sigh. “Do I have to? Why can’t I just spend Christmas here at Hogwarts?” Harry just shook his head a bit, and then replied, “You always spend Christmas with your parents. How would they react if you said, “Hey Mom and Dad, I want to spend Christmas at Hogwarts for the first time ever because I’m dating Harry Potter. Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about that. The fact that I’m gay as fuck
“Harry, you need to heal him.” I hear Granger say, and I question her mental health. I know that Harry’s almost as bad at healing charms as I am, and I know that Granger is quite good at them. She should be a healer.
“He’s just had this completely dazed look to him, his eyes are blank, and he’s looking around, as if he’s looking for something, but isn’t seeing anything. At all. It’s really starting to worry me. I though it would wear off after a day or so, but it’s been a week. He’s doing everything he should. Doing his homework, eating, sleeping, getting dressed, going to quidditch... It’s like he’s here, but isn’t. It’s really starting to worry me!”
" Flint cracked under Madam Hooch's gaze, and stuck his hand out. Harry gripped it tightly, and it was more a
But of course it had already been pushed out of his mind. He watched as Marcus Flint stalked off the field, a few Slytherin trailing behind him, a safe distance away. Harry couldn't help but feel happy at the image. Someone tapped him on the shoulder, and he spun around, only to find Ginny.
I place my hands on Draco’s chest, and I don’t even think of an incantation. I think about closing the cuts all over him, and I pour my magic into him. It feels like I’m a bottomless pit, I just push it into him, focusing on his chest.
I start thinking about everything again, and all of the sudden the panic wells up sharply inside me, and I-
I tighten my grip on my knife, and I lift it up to my forearm. I’ve cut a lot in the past few days… more than I probably should. I’ve lost a lot of blood. If I cared about it, I would probably cast a few healing charms. I cast one blood replenishing charm, but I’ve always been shit at healing charms. And I’m going to get lots of scars… not that I’ll be around much longer to look at them. I’ve been thinking about ending it. It seems easier than going on, like this. Much easier.
I wake the next morning to a pile of presents stacked at the end of the bed. I stare at them, willing them to be things that mean something to me, instead of the fucking expensive garbage I always get. I remember Harry telling me about the normal presents that he gets, and they're things like chocolate frogs, Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, fudge, socks, and books. And his personal favorite has always been his Weasley sweater. He wears it every chance he gets, I swear.
Anyways, enjoy, it might take me a bit to get back into the swing of writing, so please bear with me :)
Harry snapped himself out of it, and smiled at Ron, who was currently talking about how great his mate, Lavender, is. Harry smiled at Ron and nodded, and cast a glance around him. Most of his friends were lounging around him, sitting on various chairs and couches. Theo was chatting with Blaise about, from what Harry could pick up, the best sex they’d ever had. The two Alphas were close, and both were devilishly handsome. Before Theo had gotten bonded to Daph, they had gone out to clubs together so that they could fuck someone. They worked well together, and, honestly, Harry was surprised that they hadn’t bonded, even though he knew that they both wanted Omegas. Okay, maybe Harry wasn’t all that surprised, there had been some major sexual tension between Daph and Theo. His eyes traveled to Ginny and Luna, who were snogging over in a deep red armchair over in the corner, by a window. The moonlight was illuminating Luna’s silvery hair, and Harry absentmindedly thought that it was pretty. Harry was glad that they were together. They were so damn cute. They made such a great couple. Harry recalled that Ginny’s rut was soon, and that’s probably why they were full-on snogging. Not to mention, with a crowd. Not that anyone would judge them for it. There were so many couples in their friend group, no one batted an eye anymore. There was Pansy and ‘Mione, Ron and Lav, Dean and Seamus, Gin and Lu, Theo and Daph-
"Shake hands." Madam Hooch said, and Harry watched as the other Captain looked at him, waiting for him to stick his hand out. No way in
He starts to fall backwards, and I whip my wand out, casting a cushioning charm. His head hits the ground, and I silently wish for Madame Pomfrey to show up
That was a huge monument in our relationship. Were I trusted him enough to… well, I hadn’t placed much trust in him until then. I didn’t fall once that day.
Mine was really pretty nice, but smaller than the own I had at home. I turned the water on in the shower, (A little too hot, just the way I like it) and then I looked at myself in the mirror.
I'm going to beat the crap out of that fucker." Harry stood up, his head whipping around, looking for the blonde-headed boy.
Harry's the fucking Chosen One. He's the one who'll destroy Voldemort. Who will put all of the Death Eaters in Azkaban, or kill them.
and here she is, sending me food and a cozy sweater. I really don't deserve it. I realize there's a note in the bottom. I pick it up and read it, and it says:
much harder to cut things off with him. But at the same time I'm a needy bitch that wants to open it. So I do, because I'm pathetic.
I'm waiting for Draco, right by the doors. A ton of other people are there, and I'm standing with Pansy, Blaise, Ron, and Hermione. Pansy's holding Hermione's hand, and Ron, Blaise, and I are standing behind them. I watch the stream of students head in. I look carefully Draco, watching for his pale blond hair. I finally spot him, and I nudge Pansy. "Ooh! It's Draco!" I smile, and the rest look in the direction that Pansy's pointing. We all wait, knowing our efforts to struggle through the crowd to get to him would be useless. When he's in hearing range, Pansy shouts "DRACO! DRACO, OVER HERE!" and I watch his face closely to see if he heard us. His eyes slid towards us, so quickly I almost missed it, and then back down to the floor. He picks up his pace, and blusters right past us. I feel the shock roll over me. Pansy reaches out and grabs his arm. (
One of his friends, Angelina Johnson, a fellow Gryffindor who was now a Healer at St. Mungo’s,  married to George Weasley, and a Beta, would send a letter to Harry any time an unclaimed Omega that needed a home was put in her care. That didn’t happen very often, though. The letters could come anywhere from a month to a year and a half apart.
"We should go... the train is leaving soon." I jutted out my lower lip and pouted shamelessly, and Harry smirked. He detached himself from me, and I crossed my arms. His smirk widened, and he leaned in and gave me what was meant to be a short kiss. My hands immediately went to his hair, rooting him to the spot. I pushed my tongue into his mouth, and pulled his body onto mine. Harry lost himself in the kiss, but eventually had the sense to pull away. "Come on, Draco. We have to go. You'll miss the train."
Harry was chewing on a piece of toast, half-heartedly listening to Ron and Hermione's banter. 'Mione was going on about homework they had last night, and Ron was now stuffing bacon in his face with vigor.
The blood was satisfying. I hadn't done this recently, but I now remember why I did it in the first place. It made me hurt, which is what someone like me should be doing. Constantly. I put the knife back up at my wrist, and then pulled it back down. I only did it light enough that it would cause me pain, but not permanent damage, well, other than scars. But those will probably heal. With time. Maybe not completely. The hope is that they'll serve as reminds for what I am.
When my arm is so filled with blood and it's soaked through my trousers, I slip the silver potions knife back in my pocket, and stare out at the sky.
Maybe we could just… well, um… oh! We could practise on this cabinet, over here. The key should be somewhere around here…” She got up, and started looking by the cabinet.
must not die. I won't allow it. My mother's expression is so full of pain. I want to free her of that expression.
“So, Harry, I was thinking.” ‘Mione paused to rub her temples, and then continued. “You should practice your wandless magic. It’s an amazing skill, and I would kill, well, not really, to be able to do that. I researched it a bit this morning, and only powerful wizards and witches are able to do it. It’s a rare skill, and I think that you should practice it. It’d be quite useful. It’s almost like casting a non-verbal spell. Speaking of which, have you guys been able to do those yet? I’ve got mine down.”
I will answer all of your comments when I get back, so sorry to those who are waiting. All comments are appreciated! They keep this story going!
The time seems to hurtle forward, and suddenly, I'm at the Hogsmeade station, getting on a carriage to go to Hogwarts, walking into the castle...
That letter had me crying for hours. It's tear-stained now, and I laid down and cradled it to my chest, trying to absorb all the love Harry put in the letter. I crawl to the edge of my bed and grab the package that Mrs. Weasley gave me, and I open it. It's a darkish green sweater, with a
Harry Potter had been looking for a compatible scent for a long time. He was nineteen, and he still hadn’t found his mate, and he’d been an Alpha since the age of sixteen. That was
hang out whenever the fuck we need to. No fucker'll ruin our sixsome. Fivesome? I don't know. If he makes the most idiotic choice, we will still hang out like everything is normal. I swear on my mother's grave." Everyone nodded, and I said, "Thank you, so, so, much, Pans." Pansy nodded, and then said, "Can we get together in your dorm at 7:00 tonight? We'll discuss what happened then." I nodded and gave a small smile, and Pansy tugged Blaise away. Hermione slipped my arm over her shoulder, and the three of us walked back to the common room.
Maybe I should just avoid him. That seems like the best option. Much better than my other choices...
) angry, and confused all in one. It hurt to look at him. I dragged him into a empty classroom near the Gryffindor Common Room, I slumped him against the wall, and he sand down to the floor. The sobs started to rack his body, and I crouched down next to him, wiping tears off his cheeks. Ron was standing awkwardly behind me, his arms crossed over his chest. His expression was so awkward that I wanted to laugh, but that would be entirely inappropriate at a time like this. I backed up, and just stared at him. He cried, his body shaking, and what i was seeing made me want to punch that fucker in the face.
Ron and I smiled, and then Ron said, “You are you and what have you done with Hermione Granger?” Hermione’s brows furrowed, and then Ron laughed. “That’s the most brilliant idea you’ve had yet, Hermione.”
I gave him a dramatic sigh, and cast a levitation charm on my trunk. I started to storm out of the room, but not before grabbing Harry's hand to drag him alone with me. Oh, I am
“Dammit, Blaise! What the fuck are we going to do?!” Blaise shakes his head, and he looks as if he’s in shock.
I've gotten a bit better. I've gotten to the point where I can eat a bit, sleep a bit. No more than two hours, though. Mostly a mix between nightmares, memories, (Mostly of being deflowered) and, well, just Harry. Mostly nightmares that involve Harry, though. Fuck.
"Thank you, sir." Draco said, and then got out of his chair, climbing over the bar, and heading up the stairs that were to his left.
And last of all, there's Ron's gift. He gave me a large box of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. I snorted. It's such a
(We used to hang out together when Harry and I were together. I mean, technically we still are. Kinda.) I
"Welp, mate, you 'est get goin'. Ron's talkin' abou' murderin' some Slytherin prick named... I think 'e 'as talkin' abou'... Dra... Draco... Malcoy? I dunno, man. Stay safe, dude."
His left arm, to be exact...) He recoils so quickly that if I had blinked I would have missed it. He walks even faster, and turns to the left, which is the way down to the Slytherin's common room. Pansy looks shocked, as the rest of us do, I'm sure. "What... what just happened..." I manage to choke out. Everyone turns their attention to me. "Mate, did you fight before he left?" "No!" I reply quickly, and then I feel something sink into my bones, like I've had a bucket of ice cold water dumped over my head. Draco, ignoring us... because of me? No...
"What the fuck do you think you're doing here, trying to sit next to us, ferret?" Hermione hissed at him. Draco looked over, and was surprised at what he saw. Hermione was sitting right next to where he was standing, and her eyes were completely clear.
Please don't hate me? (I'm a little upset with myself, tbh.) It's all part of my plan. (Which has 60 parts, btw.) (It took me forever to come up with a rough line for the story to follow.) Please, guys, REVIEW! It makes my fucking day! Also, I promise that it'll get bet soon. And there'll be fluff galore. (At least for a bit.) (Then some more angst, I guess.) Also, I'm very, very sorry for breaking Hermione and Pansy up, I'll fix them in a bit. I just need a few minutes of space. Maybe I'll throw in a bit of Ron and Hermione? Idk. Maybe I should just put Pansmione right back together again. Idk, guys, idk. Anyway, REVIEW REVIEW REVIEW!
Little did he know... Draco had been watching him the whole time. And not to follow him when he dove, presumably having sighted the Snitch.
Oooooooh! Folks, please tell me what you thought. Also, I wanted you to forgive me for my sins, and show that Harry DID feel bad about 'cheating' on Draco. So, guys, please feel better.
I swear on my life I would die to be a normal kid who gets normal things and has a normal family that doesn't roll around in gold and they aren't worried about table manners and parties, but playing Quidditch in the backyard and doing housework.
Harry was pushing against them, straining himself, his anger telling him to punch the ferret into the floor, to scream words at him that would have made Mrs. Weasely have him stick a bar of soap in his mouth, to jinx him into next week, to leave him bleeding. To make him feel
No name. Figures. Blaise isn't one for details. When I open it, it's a small model of a Firebolt, and it's pretty cool, actually. It reminds me of Harry's amazing broom.
” I said, this time with more enthusiasm. Hermione rattled the handle again, and then shook her head.
“PANSY! Calm down! I tried, and you always do things a thousand times better than I do. So don’t worry about it. You can just talk to Draco in a bit, sort things out, calm things down. You’re much better and the feelings rubbish than I am.”
tries to upset Pansy in any way when she’s mad. Or annoyed. Or on her period. Dealing with her during her period is the worst. That is something to avoid at all costs.
the way around my eyes. I had dark eye shadow, and it stuck out against my creamy white skin. My dark read lipstick was a stark contrast to my dark eyes, and I rather liked the look of it. My black bangs were plastered to my forehead, and my longer bob was deflated. My rose-gold hoop earrings and diamond studs were tangled with my raven black hair. My body still looked spectacular, though.
"Ah! They set this all up for me! I do all of the homework and learn the lessons while I'm gone, and then I come back perfectly ready for classes. You'd know this if you'd ask me about
Not- not a word. O- okay? I- I need you to- to promise me, Pansy." I nod and say "You have a Slytherin's word, Dray." He nodded, and then pulled his hands away. He backed up a bit, and then his hand moved to his sleeve. I was confused, and then he pushed his sleeve up. I almost gasped, but I hardened my face. I didn't let a crack of emotion show. I heard a small gasp from Blaise, but nothing more. I wanted to ask lots of questions, but I was at a loss for words. My hand twitched at my side. I wanted to ask, to know
Oh, fuck you, parents. I probably would be being fucked senseless right now, if I had stayed. Really, Harry probably would have had to carry me everywhere. Oh, those were the times. I had a brief flashback to the first weekend that we had fucked so much that I couldn't walk, and I was so sore that Harry carried me to all of my classes that Monday.
Now he’s going to save me like he saves everyone, and I know that it’s not because he loves me. It’s because he saves everyone. It’s his thing. Huge savior complex. So it’s nothing personal. Just saving me because his conscience wouldn’t let him leave me here. It’d torture him. Again, it’s nothing personal.
I calmed down a bit when I saw that it was only Pansy. My brows furrowed at what I saw. Her face was flushed and her eyes blood-shot, and I wondered why she had been crying.
He started to feel completely numb again. Just numb. And like the sky was on his shoulders. He just felt down, depressed, done…
Like he promised, it's a huge box of Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes. He mentioned something about having a lifetime supply... but this was a
Draco sighs. "I- I- I just don't know how it's going to work out... but it's your guys' life. I can't ask that of you."
Others nodded, and started to aparate out. (Harry had adjusted the wards so they could.) Luna threw her arms around Harry, and then backed away. Ginny pulled Harry into a tight hug, and whispered, “I really hope that this is the one, Harry.” Harry breathed in her scent, said “Me, too, Ginny. Me too.” and then backed away. Ginny gave him a kiss on his cheek, and then went over to Luna, grabbing her hand, and then apparating them out of Harry’s house.
He looked over at Draco, who was above him. He had been circling the same spot for most of the game, and Harry was worried he was going to fall off his broom. He was slumped over, and Harry wasn't sure if he even had his eyes open.
"Good job, Mate!" Ron said, and then gave him a thump on the back. Harry was smiling so hard that his mouth hurt.
I walked into Snape’s classroom, holding Ron up. Thank Merlin that Snape wasn’t here yet. I sat down at a desk, and Ron flopped into his chair. He moaned, and then I pulled out my text book.
I pull Draco close, stroking his back, and muttering sweet things. He sobs on my shirt, soaking it with tears, but I couldn’t care less right now. “What’s wrong, Dray, darling? What happened?” I say softly.
fifth year. So Dray makes him better, too. They're the cutest together. I have a brief flashback to October, a week or so after Dray and Harry broke up.
Oh, I’m a idiot. I hand her my wand, which I didn’t even realise that I was holding. She pockets it, and then I hold my hand out.
I hear him plead with Hermione, asking her to help him. With what? I’m a lost cause, Harry. I did this to myself. This isn’t your fault. If I die, it isn’t your fault.
thing to do. He doesn't particularly like me, but we get along for Harry's sake. Totally his style. Something that no one could say was outright bad, because there
was overwhelming. Ron tugged Harry out of Malfoy's face, and muttered "You can do so much better than this, mate."
I come up short. No, that was just a product of my imagination. Nothing real. Just my hopeless self trying to keep me from going insane. It was a dream. Isn't it always?
I think I see Draco move his arm a bit, but before I can make more of it, Ron taps on my shoulder. “What should I do, ‘Mione?”
When I turned 14, I filled out. My skinny, short, frame was filled up with wide hips, a nice round ass, and bigs boobs. Everything else stayed nice and tiny, and, to my delight, my waist was small.
We’re thinking some time in March… it’s not going to be big. I was thinking you two, Ginny, Luna, Neville, Lavender and Parvati, Fay and Emily, and Blaise? Pansy said that she was going to invite Draco-”
I nearly peed myself when I named this chapter, but I didn't want to explain that early, cuz y'all didn't know what was in store for you. Anyway, this is my first REAL sex scene, and I hope it met your expectations. (I know I put that one in the first chapter, but that wasn't good. At all.) So, please comment! Tell me what you thought of it! Anyway, love you guys, xoxo :)
I looked at my face, evaluating it. My traditional black mascara was a bit smudged, as was my heavy eyeliner. I did cat’s eyes with it, and it went
give you all his records, because, fuck, society isn’t fair. Omegas have the worst end of the stick.” Harry nodded, and murmured, “They really do.” Angelina continued. “It’s a load of shit, really. You can see his files because there’s an off chance that your scents will be compatible, but if you weren’t an Alpha, Merlin forbid that
Hey guys! I’m so sorry for not posting yesterday, I actually wrote this chapter three other times and it just didn’t seem right. One outcome actually ended with Harry finding a stray puppy, and keeping it. SO. Anyway, please comment! More angst coming soon, and more story development. Also, thank you to all of my wonderful reviewers, particularly Obsessed_with_drarry. YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!
A chorus of cheers came up through the crowd, so loud that they completely over-powered the moans and groan and shouts of the Slytherins. Harry held the Snitch up high, and then landed. His team came running over as soon as they landed, and he was caught in hugs and pats on the back and shouts of praise.
When we arrive at a Gargoyle, and Snape mutters "Sherbet Lemon" and the Gargoyle leaps aside. A staircase appears, and Snape gets on it, so I do too.
"Welcome to St. Mungo's, how may I help you today-" the lady looked up with an utterly bored expression, registered who Harry was, and her eyes widened. "Harry Potter!" she said in a girlish voice. "Can I be of any assistance to you?" she squealed, all well battering her eyelashes and noticeably rearranging her shirt so that it showed off her cleavage. He watched as the girl conspicuously scented the air, and then lifted her head and brushed her blonde hair back so that her neck was clearly visible. It was either to allow Harry to see that she didn't have a bond mark, or so that her scent reached him more easily. Harry had already noticed that she was a Beta, and had a nice scent, too. It was like... freshly-made coffee, maybe? Something else, too. Like Harry had said, it was nice, but it wasn't
“Harry, darling, I’m so sorry.” I say, giving him a sad look. “We’re going to try and stay friends with him, try to make him see sense, mostly,” I say with a small sigh. “That’s a good idea, gorgeous.” Hermione says. Ron gags at the pet name. “I would do it myself, but I’d bet all of my money on the fact that he doesn’t want to be around
I'm laying in my gigantic bed, in my cold, empty, room, that is dark and dank and damp and most of all cold.
Harry just looked like he was in shock. He had a dazed look, and his eyes were dull. Hermione had an arm wrapped around him, and I felt so bad for him that I didn’t even have it in me to be jealous. Ron was furious, and his face was almost as red as his hair. (Which was
It's going to be the end of the Wizarding World if he comes to full power. So, uh, yeah. Sorry bro."
I was also thinking about how if I had stayed, we probably would have fucked so much that I couldn't walk.
“I’m going to ask him to Best Man, but I’m almost 100% sure that he won’t even go, so I figured that you could be my back-up. Sound good? Oh, and on the off chance that he
I was holding a bit of Harry's weight, but nowhere near as much as Ron. (This would have been a lot easier if we had been dragging him around last year. He was always such a twig, but thanks to all of his Quidditch practice, a growth spurt, and Mrs. Weasely's cooking, he was finally muscular, and quite tall, actually, but is still more skinny than I would have liked.) Harry was shaking, and his expression was sad, (no,
have a fire blazing inside it. It has a long, low-backed sofa, and many armchairs. When I walk in, I'm surprised as to what I find. My mother is standing by a wall, and my father is standing by a armchair close to the fire. My Aunt Bella is also there. More dark figures are crowded by that high-back, dark red armchair. I make out one of their faces to be one of my father's friends.
Like he promised, it's a huge box of Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes. He mentioned something about having a lifetime supply... but this was a
He turned around when someone tapped on his shoulder, and he was surprised to see Seamus Finnigan standing there, swaying unsteadily.
I grab a piece and shove it in my mouth, and it's heavenly. I eat a few more pieces, trying hard not to cry on it. Why is Mrs. Weasley giving me a sweater and fudge? I mean, I called them blood traitors for
"I would have known if you had brewed a Sober-Up potion yesterday. Pansy would've told me. You guys talked last night before she left, right?" Draco's mind was not up to speed with the fact that Hermione didn't want to talk.
"AND FIFTH OF ALL, YOU EXPECTED ME TO DO MY OWN HOMEWORK WITHOUT HERMIONE LOOKING IT OVER? WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH MY DRACO? Also, how else am I going become best friends with the best seeker at Hogwarts? How am I going to ride a Firebolt? THERE ARE THINGS I NEED!"
And I'll be left with my parents and I will be a fucking follower of the person who is going to tear the world down for power and no will to live.

I shook my head slightly. "It means, 'as shitty as this is, and no matter how much I hate fucking Death Eaters and want to wipe them off the earth, and no matter how much I hate
“So, wandless magic is complex, and hard, and apparently it’s tiring to do, so that’s why most wizards prefer to just use their wands. But, the thing is, wandless magic is more powerful. Almost like a force of nature… Anyway, let’s say you were to cast a healing charm. If you were to place your hands on the person that you were healing, per say, and cast the charm, it would be much more powerful. It’d heal the person much more effectively, for one, but would also heal them much quicker. It’s quite a gift, Harry. Anyway, it’s quite taxing, and most wizards or witches pass out after casting powerful spells the first few times. That’s why it’s better to practice. It’s like working out, the more you practice, the stronger you become. And when you use it, it’s like flexing a muscle. So, again, I think that you should practice.”
and here she is, sending me food and a cozy sweater. I really don't deserve it. I realize there's a note in the bottom. I pick it up and read it, and it says:
I walked into the manor, looking around. I had forgotten how big it was. Harry was right. I am a lucky fucker. I through the house, and a house elf came and took my trunk upstairs, presumably to my bedroom. I strolled through the many rooms in the house, vaguely heading towards my mother's favorite sitting room. I walked through a room full of big oil paintings. I knew that they were priceless, and we had at least ten the room. I don't think that you can get much richer than that. Harry's made me realize just how good I have it. I open the door to the dark sitting room that my mother spends most of her time in. It's a big room, all dark and made of dark blues, reds, and blacks. It has a huge fireplace, and I have yet to see it
When we get back to the Common Room, I follow Blaise into his Dorm, just to check on Dray. When I enter, I find Draco culled up in a ball on his side, crying. I rush over, thanking Merlin for the fact that Theo, Crabbe, and Goyle are sleeping, and wrap my arms around him. Blaise casts a quick
"Yeah, we talked about it a long time ago. I wanted to shag a lot more often than her, and so she said it was okay for me to shag people, as long as I didn't get in a relationship with them."
I open the package, and it's an amazing eagle feather quill. I think she must have seen me eyeing Harry's... I love it.
I accidentally fell out of my bed, trying to get out. I stand up, groping around the nightstand for my glasses. I slip them on, and then find that I have a potion sitting on my desk. There’s also a note.
I don't want to break him. Or me. (Because I'll be the one that suffers the most from this, obviously.)
And last of all, there's Ron's gift. He gave me a large box of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. I snorted. It's such a
He pulled the sweater on, careful to not get blood on it. (Or tried to not get blood on it. There was too much not to.)
*cough*) So Harry would go back to (seemingly) hating him. If that's what Draco wanted. Harry loved him too much to hurt him. He wouldn't go running after Draco, drooling. Maybe he would get a girlfriend, just to prove that he was over Draco. Yeah, he would maybe do that. He could go back to the glares in the halls, the mean words, (After all, they were just
to ignore Harry. And for not going after the Snitch. (He wasn't really bothered by the latter, though.)
He didn't really notice when he left the Three Broomsticks, and walked down the streets, hands shoved deep in his coat pockets. His only intention was to go get drunk as hell, and hopefully forget about all of this. In the moment, he couldn't remember if he was a happy, snuggly drunk, or a sad, depressed drunk. His eyes darted to left, and then the right, and then back to the left, and the right again. He scanned the windows of the shops, looking for a sign of Harry, not even realizing that he was. He turned, pushing open the door to the Hog's Head. It was dark and dirty, and they windows were thick with grime. He walked in, and was comforted by the green and silver ties, and sat down at the bar.
Of course, he had found scents that were quite pleasant, so pleasant that he wanked off to them, and he knew that if he didn’t ever find the right scent, he could easily be happy with these people. They were always a back-up option.
Hermione squealed, and then said, “Practice tonight, at 9:30? Pansy has to go back to the hospital at nine, so I’ll be free then.”
good." she spits out in her insane voice. I kneel down in front of the chair. I don't make direct eye contact with the Dark Lord, but I watch as he draws his wand. I glance over at my Mother, and her expression is pained as ever. I glance at my Father, who's expression is blank. Auntie Bellatrix's is excited. The Dark Lord pushes up my sleeve. His hands are cold, and I want to recoil instantly. It takes all of my will to stay were I am. I am replaced by a blank numbness, there is nothing in my heart. It's like my insides are filled with ice. The Dark Lord puts his wand to my left forearm. My last thought before the pain is
I've always wanted a Firebolt. Father says that I already have a good enough broom, no matter how much I beg. It's unlike him to not get me anything I want... but not unheard of.
“Really, mate, how thick are you? She said she’s getting married, and there’s nothing we can do about it! So
It'll hurt. A lot. For the both of us. I think it will hurt me more, though. He has a life. And a gigantic hero complex. And a saving people thing. And friends. And a bunch of girls that would marry him in a heartbeat. (Don't think about that, Draco...) And a house. And any career he wants. Anything he really wants, he can get. Because he's our savior. I know he'll be the one to do Voldemort in, if anyone can. (I'm starting to think it's impossible, though...) And the fact that you can throw anything at Harry, and he'll get over it, with time.
I gave her a hug, and she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and then said "See you next week" and I gave her a nod. She then proceeded to march out of the Common Room.
Draco had not said a word. The tears were going to break free any second. Later, where no one else could see, the sobs were going to shake his body. His emotions would be a hurricane. The pain, the depression, the numbness, the anger...
Hey Guys! READ THIS FIRST PART. Okay, I'm REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, sorry for not updating for a week. I had to take a bit of a break, A. for my mental health, and B. I lost motivation. (I haven't been getting very many comments!) Really sorry, my mental health has been pretty crummy lately, so I hope it gets better soon. NOTE FOR THIS CHAPTER, this switches between no one's POV, to kinda looking in on someone's thoughts, back to no one's POV, and then to Hermione's, and then back to the kinda focusing on someone. Also, PLEASE comment. It makes my day a bazillion times better. And, speaking of commenting, a BIG thank you to the amazing, spectacular, lovely, stupendous, incredible, stunning, magnificent Goblet_of_fire4. He of She has reviewed my every update, and the reviews are so wonderful that it makes my heart hurt. THANK YOU! Guys, I really would just LOVE if you would review, even if you are reading this once it's finished. It keeps the story going! Anyway, a bit of a sad chapter. :( Sorry guys. Also, go listen to the song Issues, by Julia Micheals, Skinny Love, by Birdy, and Goodbyes, by Post Malone. Those are the songs that inspired that inspired this chapter. (Lol. I love music too much.) LOVE YOU GUYS! (Sorry for the long note.)
“So, what are we going to do? Just wait until he shows some emotion?” I ask her, leaning back in my chair. She’s sitting on the desk, and she runs her hands over the book’s spines.
The lesson went on as normal, and his smile ebbed away after a few minutes. He dropped multiple things throughout the lesson, and his smile always returned when he did. I think Ron’s head is going to split open.
I grab a piece and shove it in my mouth, and it's heavenly. I eat a few more pieces, trying hard not to cry on it. Why is Mrs. Weasley giving me a sweater and fudge? I mean, I called them blood traitors for
Hermione smiled, and then said, “Well, I was going to ask Ginny and Luna to be my Bridesmaids, and you guys to be my Groomsmen? Does that sound okay?”
His eyes were dull and he looked like he was looking at me and not seeing anything. And then they close.
This was one of the nice things about being a Slytherin. (Thank Merlin that Salazar Slytherin believed in girls each having their own bathroom...) All girls had their own bathroom.
No. No, no, no. A Unicorn hadn't been seen in since the Death Eaters killed every one they could find!
Draco was only there because he didn't want to abandon his team right before a match, and they likely couldn't have try-outs and train in the new Seeker in time for the game. He should've just quit. Any player could have been better than him right now.
He had landed as soon as he thought that Harry looked at him when he landed... and decidedly not looked at him again. He didn't want to see him that happy without him. It hurt.
(I understand. I kinda just said that I was going to leave a VERY LITTLE cliffhanger.) I’m sorry, I don’t have time to do shout-outs, so next update there will be a gigantic thank you!
I've gotten a bit better since... that day. I've gotten to the point where I can eat a bit, sleep a bit. No more than two hours, though. Mostly a mix between nightmares, memories, (Mostly of being deflowered) and, well, just Harry. Mostly nightmares that involve Harry, though. Fuck.
could think of, and none of it's worked... I think we'll have to let him do what he needs to do, and support him. I
"Your sister accidentally drank a drop of poison that was stored in your potions cabinet. We think that she was looking for a pepper-up potion, due to the fact that she was not feeling good, earlier in the day. Thankfully, your Father saw, immediately rushed to St. Mungo's."
I shook my head, I was completely confused as to what just happened. "Pansy, no." I said quietly. "If this is what he wants... I'm not going to make him do anything he doesn't want to." I just looked down at my shoes, biting my lips. Ron muttered, "Fucking ferret..." and Blaise just said, "Asshole." Hermione was alternating between looking at me and Pansy. She let go of Pansy's hand and gave me a hug. Pansy looked a bit shocked, but she had a murderous look in her eyes. I don't know what happened to Pansy. She walked over and
Blaise told me about breakfast, and you've been crying and moping and lost in your own head! I don't even know what to do anymore! I have to leave today, I'm going to going to be at school for a week and at the hospital the next! How are you going to live without me?"
I’m dating the Chosen One.” I scowled and leaned in to kiss Harry. He responds immediately, as always, and slips his tongue into my mouth. I graze his bottom lip with my teeth, and he pushes me into the wall. I have a quick flashback to my first time with him.
It'll hurt. A lot. For the both of us. I think it will hurt me more, though. He has a life. And a gigantic hero complex. And a saving people thing. And friends. And a bunch of girls that would marry him in and heartbeat. (Don't think about that, Draco...) And a house. And any career he wants. Anything he really wants, he can get. Because he's our savior. I know he'll be the one to do Voldemort in, if anyone can. (I'm starting to think it's impossible, though...) And the fact that you can throw anything at Harry, and he'll get over it, with time.
Panic takes over and I can't do anything but lie there and take it as it turns my stomach. I want to throw up but I can't move at all. I want to curl up into a ball and make it feel better.
Dray!” I hiss, my eyes raking up and down his body. I tear off his shirt, looking up and down his chest. There’s blood all over, and it’s hard to find where it’s coming from.
Well, guys, I’m back. AND SO IS DRACOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Lol, guys, this story has been horrible the past few chapters. I AM WORKING HARD TO MAKE IT BETTER, so please stick around? The climax is hitting on chapter after the next. Soooooooo, my boys’ll be getting better soon. (Ish)
Harry was sick of it all. Sick of not having his Draco. So Harry was going to go back to the way things used to be. That's what Draco wanted. So, because Harry loved him
"The St. Mungo's healers are looking desperately, along with an Auror or two, a few people from the Ministry, and some of my own, including the Centaurs and Hagrid. We're doing everything we can."
“Do you guys remember any of last night?” I ask, wondering if I was the only one who didn’t remember everything.
ALSO, if anyone would do fan art for this, I would be SO, SO, SO, HAPPY! Like idc if it’s like two year old scribbles, anything would be amazing! Just send me the link if u do! PLEASE? I’d love you forever!
*Laughs nervously* I honestly have no fucking clue what he’s looking up... ok, fine, it’s something about the Imperius
Draco grabbed a sponge, dumped some soap on it, and started scrubbing his chest. He moved to his shoulders, and then down his right arm, and then to his left-
that ‘Mione’s right. She always is. (I’m serious. She literally hasn’t been wrong yet.) No one in our group has gotten pregnant yet, but I’m pretty sure that all of the Omegas or Beta girls are on birth control. (We’re a bit young for children…) (Nineteen and twenty is still pretty young.) Anyways, Harry was remembering how he’d become friends with, well, if he was going to list them off, he might as well. He’d become friends with Ron, Lav, Pansy, ‘Mione, Gin, Lu, Dean, Seamus, Theo, Daph, Blaise, Parvati, Nev, and Cho. Honestly, it sounded like a big group, but in reality, it was only fourteen people. That’s not very many, when you think about it. Most of them were at Harry’s house right now. Lav was out with Parvati, Daph, and Cho. Pansy was in rut right now, so her and ‘Mione are back at their flat with Crookshanks and Precious. (Who’s Pansy’s pitbull. Long story.) Gin and Luna decided to skip the girl’s night, in favor of hanging out at my house. Gin, like I said, she’s close to her rut, and she’d probably scare the other girls. (We’re all scary and more dominant than usual when we’re close to a rut.) (Like, super scary.)
