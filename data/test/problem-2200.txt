“You don’t, if it’s not a stranger the residue won’t do any harm.” Bonhomme replied with a bright smile, tapping his temple with a finger “In theory adding different residue around it can help the body recognize the magic and push it out. But it’s a dangerous operation. I don’t advise it.” He shook his head.
Harry could hear the steel in his voice, hard and cold, covering the vulnerability he’d just witnessed. Why had Malfoy let him see that?
It wasn’t Hanson walking in with his breakfast, though. Upon asking he was informed it was her day off and he found himself missing her cutting take on the day’s news. It wasn’t just an injection of energy first thing in the morning, he realized, she was his connection to the goings on in the outside world, everyone who came visit had a stark lack of information for him. The realization gave him a moment of pause. His friends were well intentioned, trying to distract him, but it ended up making him feel cut off and pushed aside and endlessly frustrated about his lack of involvement. He still hadn’t received an update on the case he’d been working on when he got injured.
Hermione hummed her agreement.
“You should take a picture, it will last you longer,” Harry teased him.
“You know what? Maybe I won’t,” Draco replied, walking up to the bed, looking down at Harry with an air of challenge.
"You're going to miss the birth of your

is always open for anyone who wants to drop me a line.
“I promised you a good fuck, didn’t I?” Draco hummed, running a soothing hand down Harry’s side. “Are you ok bottoming?”
"If he had to pick a Weasley he could at least have gone for the elder one, she gets her brain from her mother."
"Do you think this could be replicated up north?" Potter asked after they took a tour of the village.
After accidentally burning his hands on a careless power balancing procedure, Draco followed Healer Gupta out of the village and past the treeline, leaving the trainees under the supervision of Miss Rana to finish the job.
“And yet here you are” Harry pointed out.
“Wanna hear about it?” She offered, unfolding the paper. The fact that Harry agreed to it was probably an indicator of how desperate he was to not be left alone to think.
“They are all signed by Healer Dana or Nurse Roberts as well, so unless you’re investigating them for falsifying medical records I’d say they stand.” Blaise waved the objection away with a casual swipe of his hand. That seemed to give the committee a moment of pause, some very pointed looks were exchanged. Draco felt a cold chill run down his back, were they going to disregard the reports and base their judgment on spotty testimonial evidence? But Andrews nodded “Fair enough, we’ll expedite the proceeding. The reports are still very incriminating” He pointed out, relaxing back in his chair.
Opinions? Complaints? Suggestions? Direct them to the comment section or
“Isn’t she dating Healer Dana, these days?” Harry asked.
“Are you coming to Sadistique this weekend?” Blaise asked after a while. He let Draco mull over their conversation for a bit before moving on to lighter topics.
“You will have to ask me again then, won’t you? And maybe do it properly,” There was the tiniest hint of a smile on Malfoy’s face as he started the spell again and all Harry could do was grit his teeth against the pain.
“Which is…” Blasie waved a hand encouraging Draco to elaborate.
Once she finished adjusting his painkillers she pulled out a copy of the Prophet.
“A house elf only takes care of his master.” He declared, getting to work on the eggs.
Harry listened to her paint a picture of the crumbling structure of wizarding public service system. He had to admit under all the snark she was making some very good arguments. The Auror department never suffered lack of funding or personnel, but he’d heard Hermione complain about those same things and he wondered if his experience was the exception to a much more worrying trend inside ministry departments.
“That and the fact that your husband and I are constantly lying to him. Feels like a less than ideal way to start a relationship. Make it illegal and base it on lies.”
Malfoy looked at him for a long moment without saying a word.
cold!” He gasped, fading into a chuckle.
"Yeah, civilised," Harry commented bitterly. "How do we deal with it?"

By nightfall, they were settling in a hotel room in Amritsar, the Golden Temple illuminated against the night sky out the window. It was nothing compared to their connecting suites in Mumbai, but as he watched Potter drop his clothes in a pile and head to the enclosed bathroom to shower, Draco knew they didn't need the wide berth, they'd learnt to breathe in sync and exist in the same space. He dropped his backpack at the foot of his bed, leaving the one closer to the window to Potter, and barely made it into his pyjamas and under the sheets before passing out.
WARNINGS
"I need to see how far they go," Malfoy told him. "Shirt off."
They returned to the city only after every last person had recovered from the curse and the land was completely cleansed from its influence, and Potter insisted on sending a message to Granger immediately. The absurdity of using a Muggle phone to call the Four Seasons and discuss the crafting of a series of water mirrors was entirely lost on him, apparently.
The day had started so well, too. This odd tentative truce with Potter had carried through their months apart and it felt fresh and hopeful, like there was a rope bridge thrown across what was previously an impassable canyon… or maybe only a door in a previously impenetrable wall. Draco had woken up early and did his morning yoga in his underwear in front of the window overlooking the city. His precious few minutes in savasana were interrupted by Potter's gentle knock on the door between their rooms.
“I wasn’t sure you were even listening,” Harry admitted, looping a finger in Draco’s belt loop, pulling him closer, “or that you actually cared.”
“Hello Harry, Draco. So, Grimmauld Place was checked out, and whatever you guys did or didn’t do in there made a veritable mess. The amount of unstable magic in there is the stuff of nightmares so, as much as I trust in the capabilities of my colleagues from the curse-breaking division, and the volatile magic specialists, we should start thinking about an alternative accommodation for you, Harry,” she told them, summoning a chair and plopping down in it. “And I haven’t properly thanked you, Draco. I know whatever you pulled off inside that house probably saved Ron’s life and half a dozen other officers,” she added with a smile. “What
I know it's been two weeks and some but the new chapter is long and it's published so I consider it a win.

“So, you’ll start on my arm?” he asked, just to be sure he got it right.
“Good, we’re on the same page,” Draco gave him a tight smile and gestured for him to follow. He found a mostly empty corridor and discreetly threw up some privacy charms around them.
Draco worked quickly and efficiently, first setting up the tests that needed time to react before moving on to the ones that would give an immediate result. With every precise flick of his wand scratching off another line from his list his frustration grew exponentially, his hands tugging at his hair as time ticked by bringing no new information to light. Of course, it had to be the last thing he checked to turn out positive, because it was just how things went for him lately. At least Potter was being quiet and collaborative, maybe a little too quiet, watching him work with an intensity he rarely saw even from first year trainees.
“Yes, Harry,” Draco moaned, “like that.”
The only thing keeping him company was Teddy's letter checking in after the first weeks of classes. Apparently, quidditch tryouts had been delayed so he hadn’t had a chance to take his shot yet. He’d been shopping around for classes, trying to decide what to take as electives, he was starting to consider asking for a Time-Turner to pull a Hermione Granger. Harry was not too happy about that one. He remembered how Hermione got that year, the lack of sleep, absence from friendships, all-around craziness that overtook her life. He didn’t want Teddy to feel that kind of pressure. He’d have to write back to him soon and try to dissuade him.
“I slept ok, had another weird dream,” Harry reported “woke up in pain.” Malfoy frowned at that
"You have six years of experience on me," he pointed out, as if that meant anything in the face of Draco's name when it came to dealing with British wixen.
“Since when do you hate putting up a performance?” Blaise asked, twisting Draco’s hair around his fingers, the smallest hint of teasing in his voice as he looked down at him.
With that knowledge heavy in his chest, he worked every day, breathing life in his patients, soothing wounds, unravelling curse damage, cleansing poisons. Each day it got hotter and more humid, to the point where he had to teach Griffith how to weave a Weather-Control Charm into his Personal Protection Charms so they wouldn't drip sweat on whoever they were operating on. He sorely missed the desert on those days.
“Careful, Rosie, don’t squish Uncle Harry,” Ron warned her, catching her before she could sit on Harry’s arm. He resituated her on Harry’s good side to avoid any accidents.
"Come here," Malfoy ordered, gesturing for Harry to come back in front of him.
"Mr Singh has three children, the youngest almost of school age," Draco continued, but Harry was lagging behind.
"Oh…" Harry rubbed the tip of his boot against a rough spot on the floor. "They never really wanted me as part of their family. I was a burden for eleven years and a curse for the following seven. They were more than happy to be rid of me when the Order came to collect me to send me to war."
"Fine. But you better feed me at some point."
"One more way I failed you. I should have protected you better." Draco shook his head taking her hands and kneeling in front of her
“Oh, I think you took care of that pretty well on your own,” Ron chuckled.
Did you catch the big reveal of this chapter? Did you see it coming?
for a chat.
He kept dreaming of brewing potions and it didn’t seem half as fun as what Teddy got up to during the weekend. He knew he should dissuade him from using the fruit of his labour in school. On the other hand, something told him Remus wouldn’t be entirely against the notion of his child making some trouble, especially if it was made by creative employment of academic prowess. Somehow, despite everything, there was a lot of his parents in Teddy, and Harry was comforted by the thought that they would be proud of the young boy he'd become, that he hadn't failed them.
Malfoy was his old rival, one who’d shared a lot of trauma with him and now an accomplished healer working on him, nothing more.
"We're going to meditate and you will put your distractions away," Healer Gupta instructed.
Draco smiled and handed him the papers to sign.
Draco brought a hand down to cup Harry’s balls. Aso soon as he did Harry arched up
for getting me out of my head about these last few chapters.
He should have known throwing Potter in the mix would do nothing to lessen the pressure, but what alternative did he truly have?
The worst of the angst is passed, we're heading towards happy ending zone and we're doing it through Luna's intervention.
“Let’s go.”
A brief stop at the caves of Elephanta explained the better shape the local community was in. The entire island was heavily magically charged with a soothing and nurturing energy that not even the establishment of British cannon positions on the southwest side could disrupt more than a little.
Harry’d been very vocally against Teddy visiting Malfoy Manor back when Andromeda had been reconnecting with Narcissa. The place was too filled with darkness and bad memories, it was no place for a child. Andromeda had given him a little time to sort his feelings out and then put her foot down and that had been it.
“He rarely is, but it’s only for a while. Weasley says he’s getting close, once Potter’s out of danger I’ll go back to what I was doing before.”
He flicked his wand and crossed off the line from the list with a deep sigh, rubbing a hand down his face. Just one left, the weight of his weariness hanging on his shoulders.
“And you’re experiencing the same symptoms now?” He asked eventually.
"I'm not leaving, Griffith, I'm going to be a good yell away at any point, and I have complete confidence in your ability to handle things without me. I
The desperate tone of Harry’s voice was enough to send Draco over the edge with a tortured groan. Harry was going to be the death of him. He gave a twist with his wrist, swirling his thumb over the head of Harry’s cock as his rhythm faltered. It didn’t take much more for Harry to twitch in his hand and clench deliciously around Draco’s cock, riding his own orgasm.
"I'm sure I won't."
Malfoy hummed. “That’s what slashed him open and burned him down,” he concluded with a nod, he’d seen the aftermath of it.
Almost.
“You can’t,” Draco’s voice was firm, but Weasley still thought it was an opening for debate.
Harry wasted no time before flopping over, away from the wet spot, and grin up at Draco, the complete picture of satisfaction and indulgence. Draco smiled down at him and finally got rid of his clothes, damp with sweat and other bodily fluids. Once he was just as naked as Harry he reached for his wand, but Harry’s hand closed around his wrist.
“Of course, because who needs structure or discipline when you have the saviour of the wizarding world on the team?” Draco sighed, he should have expected some nonsense like that.
“I’m here quite often to be honest.” Harry replied with a friendly smile “But it’s good to know at least someone is happy about it.” He added.
"I was still a boy when I fought that war." Draco replied, letting her take a seat on the stone bench under the gazebo overlooking the garden.
“It’s a fairly recent technique, or well, recently rediscovered, it was developed by a research group studying Celtic and aboriginal body painting traditions.”
"Something dangerous?" Parvati guessed.
"Saving your ungrateful arse from unknown curses! What I was hired to do," Harry replied, cradling his arm close to his chest as the burning sensation settled deep in the muscle, already starting to spread from where the water touched him.
With a lot of time free to wonder why Malfoy wouldn’t be able to take care of him and had to pawn him off to someone else.
There's a lot more Draco, a little more Teddy, almost nothing of what you actually want. But there is a little bit of plot so I consider this another win.
Harry watched him repeat the process several times, followed the tension in his shoulders and the furrow of his brows building and breaking the moment those memories were pulled from his mind and he relaxed.
“Auror Potter, it’s such a privilege to have you with us.” He said, pushing his glasses up his nose and holding out a hand to shake.
“Alright. I’m inked.” Malfoy told him. Of all the things Harry imagined to hear that was not the one Harry expected. He looked at Malfoy’s uniform, buttoned neatly up to his neck, the long sleeves, closed tightly at the wrist, no more skin showing than strictly necessary. Where would he get a tattoo? His mind went back to Ginny joking about his supposed Hungarian Horntail tattoo across his chest. He could see Malfoy with a sprawling dragon sleeping on his shoulders.
"Follow Vikram, he'll lead you out."
Embarrassingly, Harry fell asleep halfway through a game of chess with Ron, while he was telling him about the hazing of the recruits before they became Aurors proper, another fun thing he was missing out on.
"Here," Harry offered him a scarf.
“Of course, thank you for letting me know.” He replied before addressing the trainees “You two are dismissed, go ahead, Andrews doesn’t tolerate tardiness.” He told them, nodding to the door.
“Let’s just say you weren’t entirely off the mark arguing that my plan would trigger the Unbreakable,” Draco admitted. “It was a bit of a gamble and we got pretty close.”
Before Harry could continue there was a rustle in the undergrowth ahead of them and a moment later a man emerged from the darkness of the jungle, making his way towards the light of the torches at the side of the path.
Warnings Harry feels left behind by his friends/family finding their soulmates and building families of their own. To make himself feel better he gets drunk and has a horrible hook up.
As he gathered wood for the pyre Harry could feel the weight of Malfoy's words, 'I promised', and the question kept coming back. What did he need from Malfoy? He wanted everything, he wanted to see every part of him, understand the man he was now more than he wanted him to embark in the impossible mission of understanding Harry when Harry could barely understand himself. He wanted to
Suddenly the room wasn’t there anymore, only a shut door and a silvery dome behind it. He tried to reach for the door but it disappeared before his fingers could reach it, and in the next breath he was back in his own body in St Mungo’s.
Harry nodded. “Alright,” he agreed. “Why did you pick those memories?” Harry asked, picking up his wand again, twirling it between his fingers.
“A-ah, don’t get sidetracked. You have classes to hold,” Draco reminded him, heading to the closet to get dressed.
Malfoy nodded, “Be careful with it, your joints are very delicate right now,” he recommended, stopping at the door of the common room. “Keep the sling on and don’t do anything stupid. I’ll come check on you later.”
There was already movement around the little town, people preparing the dough for gujiya, drums being brought out, and if he looked over Malfoy's shoulder, he could see coloured powders starting to show up in the hands of children. It didn't take long for the unrestrained joy to fill the streets. Song and dance swept through the village, with drums sending clouds of yellow and pink up in the air with every beat. Young men and women chased each other, smearing reds and blues and greens on each other, the elders joining in by Summoning and shaping colourful clouds they could jump through.
Draco ran a hand through his hair taking a slow breath. “I’m telling you transferring him suddenly apropos nothing just after they get a little exposed is going to raise concerns. We have to assume they know nothing so far; I’ve been very careful with him and he’s getting better at Occlumency. Besides they wouldn’t want to kill him in the hospital and show their hand. They probably don’t want to kill him at all if they think they can use him for information on the case,” he tried to reason.
“Why don’t you go to France, Draco?” he murmured, aching tenderness bleeding into his voice as he watched the bone deep exhaustion coming to the surface on Draco’s body. “I know Laennec Hospital has offered you a position as a potion master there. You could do good work without having to fight every step of the way. You would have an actual career instead of being stuck in trauma for eternity.” He carefully picked the glass out of his loose fingers before Draco could think of refilling it again.
She barely let the driver park before jumping off the jeep, she didn't much care whether her security detail could keep up as she headed towards the flaps of the tent. It was more of a formality, really. She had probably handled more Dark and cursed objects than any of those young Aurors fresh out of training.  She was confident she could take them out with just a bit of effort. She missed having Ron on her team, but after having Rose and Hugo they agreed it was best to not work together anymore. Should Hermione actually be the target of an assassination attempt it wouldn't do to have the kids lose both their parents in one fell swoop.
So, they were barely more than trainees, he already knew that, and it wasn't necessarily a bad thing. It meant that they weren't already set in their ways, willing to bend and think outside the box.
Hermione chuckled, “That’s fair, but that’s what you want? A relationship with him?”
As soon as the thought crossed his mind he felt guilty. He already did make something just as good. James wouldn't have been there without him, even giving Luna and Ginny the space to be his parents without Harry butting in, his dark hair and brown skin were all Potter. And the girls had gone ahead and used his other sample for another pregnancy. It would still be Ginny's eggs but she would also be the one to carry. He had no right to feel sorry for himself. He had made an impact on the world, if he died tomorrow, he knew he'd done good and would leave people who loved him. And he still had two years, maybe a little bit more if he was lucky.
“Keep going,” he groaned.
Objectively he was Harry’s type in a lot of ways, especially now that he was a grown accomplished man.
Harry glanced down at the empty glass and then back up at Malfoy, holding an equally empty glass, and then he started giggling at the absurdity of Malfoy getting them both high without even trying.
It was still early when he got back in. There were people hanging out at the bar, and late diners still filled the restaurants. Hermione was sharing a drink with Professor Chambers in the lounge and she waved him over as soon as she spotted him.
“It’s relevant to me.” It was the
“But you never did,” Harry concluded.
"It's not me, Potter. It's something outside!" Malfoy returned the kick for good measure.
"Malfoy was a child soldier like any of us, he had the misfortune of ending on the wrong side of a conflict much bigger than him. When the chips were down, he refused to identify Harry, buying us the chance to escape. At the end of the Battle of Hogwarts he defected in front of everyone and joined the fight against Voldemort. Too little, too late, but I believe it shows his potential for change."
“We’re going to heal your chest wound now.” He informed him just as Healer Dana walked through the door.
“I’ll start,” Harry decided, pushing himself up to sit. “I want to apologize. What I did to you was honestly fucked up. I should have given you some credit, I should have trusted you. I went so far over the line I don’t even know how I can even ask you to forgive me for forcing my way into the Pensieve.” Harry took a slow breath to settle the twist in his stomach at the thought of what he’d done. “Those were incredibly private memories, and I had no right to make demands over them. You had every right to share them at your own pace, or not share them at all, and I took that decision away from you.” Harry looked up from his lap to Draco’s face. “I’m really sorry, and know that if there is any way I can make it better I will. I mean it. Anything.”
"The British Ministry of Magic has never addressed the damage done to other magical communities during the colonial empire and some, most I would say, are still struggling to get back on their feet after gaining independence. I want to do something about that now that I have the resources, and I'm going to start with West Bengal. I'm going to help the development of schools, try to rebuild traditional magical practices the empire tried to eradicate, reach out to isolated magical communities and promote their inclusion in the education system," Hermione started to explain her plan of attack.
“She married Blaise, she’s practically my sister,” Malfoy replied. “Besides she was in our year and my house, Potter, it’s a bit hard not to get to know each other when you live together for seven years,” he pointed out.
Draco couldn’t help the weak chuckle at that; he pressed the heel of his hand against his forehead, thinking of the near heart attack Potter gave him when he decided it would be a good idea to leave the hospital to have dinner at the Weasleys’.
him," Hermione told him. "Don't push me to pick, Harry, you won't like the answer."
"If each of them had an enchanted mirror, washed in the water of the same river, the same water, the same metal…"
Harry’s eyes snapped open and fixed unwaveringly on Draco’s face as he leaned down again to resume his ministration. Harry was perfect, the weight of him on Draco’s tongue pulled a deep moan out of him that was immediately echoed by Harry, his fingers tangling in Draco’s hair. His hand wasn’t pushing as Draco slowly, oh so slowly sank down, feeling Harry’s considerable length fill his mouth. Harry was never demanding, his fingers twisting in Draco’s hair more out of a need to ground himself than anything else.
“Mate, he was visiting the grave of the woman he almost married, what do you think?” Ron replied looking up at him with wide eyes. “It wasn’t a jolly walk in the park, but it was… you know, composed,” he shrugged.
"Very pretty, dad," Rose replied after taking a critical look at his face and reaching out to flatten a bit of his beard. Harry wasn’t about to question her process but the amount of glitter that appeared on her palm when she took it back wasn’t encouraging.
"So I've heard, which begs the question why are you here asking me to come along for a second trip." Draco turned to Granger "I'm sure you have Healers lining up at your door to be associated with your pet project. And they can't be all entirely inept, Griffith himself was halfway decent when I left him."
“Which was still excessive,” Blaise reminded him.
“You could start by formulating it as a question instead of an order, assuming I’ll just do whatever you please,” Malfoy mentioned casually.
He turned, with a frown of confusion as if he wasn't used to his own name. When his eyes settled on her she flinched at the sight of red irises. He froze at her reaction, then quickly waved his wand at his face, and in a blink, they were back to cool grey before disappearing behind dark lenses.
Harry had wanted to kiss every unexpected and stupidly attractive freckle on Draco’s body, map all the scars, old and new, on his skin. But now that the thought of Draco’s tongue in his arse had been planted in his head, Harry couldn’t think of anything else.
“You’re a rubbish chess player,” Malfoy replied immediately, a teasing glint in his eyes.
“Malfoy?” he asked.
“I’m just really bored… going mad kind of bored,” he admitted after a long moment of embarrassed silence. Draco hummed, a smile tugging at his lips at the obvious discomfort Potter found himself in, confessing something as frivolous as boredom.
"Whatever poisoned them is still active, and even if I spent all day directly cleansing them one by one it would be like using a tissue to fix a breached dam. We need to find the root cause. Whatever happened in the caves needs to be fixed, and only then I'd be able to heal them."
"He's a Death Eater! And you have emergency Healers at St Mungo's who would be all too happy to drop whatever and follow you halfway around the world," Harry retorted.
“Am I now?” Malfoy replied, a smile already tugging at his lips as a teasing glint lit up his eyes. “What did I say about assuming things, Potter?”
The man nodded uncertainly.
“And who knows, maybe he will actually put some pressure on the central government now that he has a finger in the cause,” she mentioned.
As they surveyed the damage Draco couldn't help but turn to Healer Gupta.
"Is he going to be as pleasantly surprised by my presence as last time?" he asked.
“I wasn’t in too much pain this morning and I was kind of bored of losing at chess,” he replied with an easy smile.
WARNING / DISCLAIMER
the last. There was still a piece of his family.
“Yeah, you’re lucky I do,” Draco grumbled, settling a little into the couch.
Draco ended up researching deep into the night, under Soup’s disapproving gaze. It was astounding how he could look down on him from a height of under 3 feet. He could swear the little bugger switched him to decaf around eleven and hummed disapprovingly every time Draco asked for another cup. He needed to find the best way to test for the wide range of possible traumas Potter might have suffered and went unchecked until they surfaced now, messing with his recovery in unforeseen ways.
"I know, 'Mione, if anything bad happens you'll know through the coins, otherwise, wait for our letter," Harry reassured her with a smile. "I'll see you in a couple of weeks."
Harry did end up studying up on West Bengal, not only to soothe his anxiety after he'd given Hermione his availability, but because, like Parvati said, he wanted it to be his chance to touch and experience Indian culture and find his roots, things his father would have probably taught him if he'd had the chance.
“I feel like there’s a ‘but’ there.” Potter added, but there was a relieved smile on his face at the news.
"A lion?" Malfoy commented as his eyes fell on the lion's head tattoo over his left pectoral. "Leaning into the Gryffindor golden boy image, much?" His teasing was gentle, meant to distract him from the cold fingers tracing the lines of curse damage up his arm and crawling over his shoulder. Harry didn't mention the actual meaning of it, it was irrelevant now.
Draco woke up before his alarm had a chance to go off, the weight of the day crashing on him the moment he opened his eyes. He took a slow breath, letting the air out from his mouth and steeled himself against the day ahead. He stood in front of the bathroom mirror, straightened his back and squared his shoulders before opening the cabinet to take out the razor.
“No, I’m the nurse on shift,” he replied quickly. Draco raised an eyebrow looking down at him.
When they finally,
"No, Healer Malfoy," he mumbled, staring at his shoes.
Malfoy tore his eyes away from the domed top and looked back at Harry's face, the question clear on his face.
“Oh, that’s how you’re going to play it?” Harry smiled down at him with a raised eyebrow. “What other gentlemanly habits have you retained, then, Malfoy?”
As the last notes of "una voce poco fa" floated through the air Draco stood. They didn't have much time left to lose. He didn't have to speak for Pansy to follow him into his bedroom, picking up the robes on the way. She hung them to Draco’s wardrobe and opened the garment bag, showing off the content. The robes were stunning, of course, there wasn't a garment made by Pany that was less than. But this ensemble was beyond. A black so pure it was vaguely disquieting to look at, accented with polished metal at the collar and at the shoulders. The two sides connected with a fine chain at the neck and the motif repeated down the double breast of the waistcoat hanging inside the robes, each pair of buttons connected, the silver bringing light to the garment and setting off its stunning darkness.
Between recovering from his latest near-death, wrapping up the case, setting up his transfer, and getting the proper training, Harry did end up missing the arrival of the new Auror recruits, but he made up for it by promising to join their training retreat in June.
Three hours later Harry knew more about Draco’s friends’ sex life than he ever thought he would, and discovered a few kinks he never imagined he could have. And he couldn’t wait for Draco to just come back from France so he could have one on one time with him in the ridiculous king-sized bed he’d seen in the master bedroom.
“I will do my very best,” Harry promised. He was too invested in his own recovery now to do something to jeopardise it. “Oh, and, Malfoy?” he called when the man turned around to leave.
“And wasn’t that wishful thinking,” he commented, bitterness bleeding into his voice. “Thank you, Soup, I can always count on you,” he said eventually.
What can I say? It's a Christmas miracle, performed by the lovely
“Oh, that,” Potter mumbled, looking away. “No, I don’t think so?”
“Oh, that feels so weird” Potter chuckled, looking down at himself, reaching up to poke at his own side, giggling at the sensation “What is this?” He asked.
The arrival of their last week in Calcutta took Draco completely by surprise. He'd grown too comfortable with the luxury of the hotel and Potter's company. He couldn't believe it was already time to say goodbye to Healer Gupta and Miss Rana. They were going to the inauguration of the new gurukul. Granger would oversee the signing of the agreement on the lowering of isolating measures on the island community after a year of teaching, and then they would each be off on their way, the negotiation on the wider state schooling programme to continue, after Granger's return to England, between local activists and their own government.
As usual this chapter was betaed by the wonderful
“Malfoy?” Harry tried again to get Malfoy’s attention, he needed to know what exactly he’d seen to make him react like that.
who came through for me once again. Jay, you were the best gift this Christmas, the discord squad knows just how serious I am when I say it.
If you've been following closely you know the days are running out so the tag 'preparing for death' becomes extremely relevant in this chapter.
Harry watched summer turn into fall and then edge into winter, the leaves turn different shades of red and orange and fall down on his windowsill, leaving the trees bare.
"Let the people rebuild their hospital and help me teach them how to protect themselves," Healer Gupta replied simply.
"I'll get Hermione to put her foot down about lifting the spell secreting the land," Harry decided.
“No more lies.”
"Standard protocol—extract, isolate, transport to neutralise."
“My head, and my hand, the good one,” Harry replied, waving said hand.
He heard Malfoy's gasp when they turned and there it was. The Shaheed Minar, white against the darkening sky, cutting the darkening sunset in two, bright thanks to the new lighting.
Harry is thirsty, Draco is mildly amused.
“Spill all over yourself from just my hand?” Harry rubbed his chin up Draco’s neck to kiss his jaw.
They chatted about the fallout from the last mission, how the department was scrambling to do damage control and how the press was running wild as usual.
By popular request there is now a reading group on discord if you don't want to take the trip alone.
I think this is about enough, I know it’s getting long so I’m playing the exit song for myself. One last mention needs to go to the entire discord squad for creating the perfect environment for me to be able to create.
“There are safeguards that prevent any magic from interfering with the mark. From what we know of the man that crafted it, probably lethal safeguards. Muggle was the only way I could get it,” he explained.
He was perfect, kneeling above Harry, those black briefs looked painted on and the golden pattern on the elastic did nothing to dispel the illusion of a renaissance painting.
"But you didn't. You had the chance and you didn't."
“And?” Harry prompted.
“Mhm?”
"Your information is more than a bit out of date. I quit almost six years ago and put together my own firm," Weasley told him. "I couldn't deal with Charlie's silent treatment after the dragon thing came out and I wanted to be a bit more flexible about which jobs I took."
"Can't he have graduated from open hostility to the much more mature position of pretending I don't exist at all?"
Draco is just tired with life in general, Harry is bored and things just can't seem to go Draco's way.
"Potter—" Malfoy called him when they got off, but when Harry turned around he hesitated. "Thank you."
He waited until they were wrapped in fluffy bathrobes walking down a quiet corridor with walls decorated with stunningly intricate geometric mosaics before asking the question.
“Any chance I can speak to your partner about it?” He asked Potter, doing things informally would avoid him the headache of making a formal request to the ministry and the bureaucracy that came with it.
“So, Potter, I hear we might have more in common than originally thought,” Blaise mentioned casually, stirring his tea.
“Let me see it, Draco, come for me,” he growled, dragging his teeth down Draco’s neck.
“What’s different this time?” he asked, pinning Draco down with a look.
"With a Popper-Modified Miracle Growth, sure."
“How does that just come up in casual discussion?” Harry asked once he managed to get his breathing under control.
He woke up with a headache, the smell of the greenhouse lingering in his nose and a strange pain in his right hand that promised the start of a not-so-great day.
"I went out with a French team of volunteers in Somalia. An earthquake had triggered old curses weaved into the earth by slave traders. The damage was unimaginable and we had to work with basically nothing while the ground beneath our very feet kept shaking. The first thing I learnt was a Stabilisation Spell and how to uphold it for hours. We worked in teams of three, one to keep the ground still, one to hold up the tent and one to actually operate on the patients." Healer Gupta had a knowing smile on her face; she knew something about adverse environments.
Harry shook his head. "You probably don't even remember this but we met in Madam Malkin's shop and you weren't the image of pleasantness there either," he informed him.
Potter begged for the truth and Draco had to keep lying.
for the beta work.
Pansy smiled at him when he walked out of the fireplace. “you thinking about coming out like that?” She asked, sizing him up as if she hadn’t dressed him herself in the morning. “It suits you but you’re not taking the robes out to a club before I debut them on a runway.”
"You tracked him down? For me?"
Padma smiled and shook her head. "Hermione knows exactly who you are, and I'm sure you'd be on top of her list even if you
Draco moaned softly at the wanton display, the elegant arch of Harry’s back called to him to trace each knob of his spine with his tongue, and Draco wasn’t one to deny himself simple pleasures. He didn’t resist the temptation to kiss one of Harry’s perfect plump buttocks either or to give the other a little nibble. The bottle of lube abandoned and forgotten as Draco got distracted worshipping the perfect shape of Harry’s arse until Harry was positively begging him to get a move on.
Harry didn’t need him to repeat it. He rolled over and shoved a pillow under his hips, hissing when his cock brushed against the cool silk case.
He knew Potter hated it, hated the admiration and show of gratitude the people insisted on bestowing on him. He carried it written on his face as much as he avoided looking at Draco as if he was transparent, a ghost of an unpleasant memory. That's why he noticed when Potter's eyes snapped to him and he bristled when he heard the man serving them food address him with their nickname and such a high honorific. There was no way he was going to let it lie.
Of course, impossible was to be expected when it came to Potter.
"I do." Draco propped his elbow up on the table and leaned his chin on his hand, studying the young man in front of him while a waitress quickly cleared the empty plates. Judging by his age, he must have been one of the first to start Hogwarts after reconstructions. This man, with his round face and curly hair, had only had a brush with the war, too young to entirely understand what was going on if he was lucky.
They grabbed their food and found a nice spot on the beach to eat, looking out to the sea, gently lapping at the sand.
He stopped when he saw a figure in front of Potter’s door, looking around in the least subtle way one could imagine.
"About as well as anybody else, I believe," Malfoy replied laconically.
“It converged close to your core, which could indicate a bond.” Draco told him, putting the lens down.
He kept himself behind the cover of trees and shrubbery for good measure as they made their way down the stone path. When Malfoy finally stopped, Harry scanned the environment, trying to catch whoever was going to come and avoid being taken by surprise. But Malfoy didn't seem to be waiting for anyone, he just… unrolled a yoga mat and started a leisurely practice.
"Ok," she agreed quickly. "Will you braid my hair?" She didn't have any problem dropping the topic until later, when she could leverage her parents to get her way. Harry had watched her play her cards with Ron and Hermione masterfully to get whatever she wanted more than once through the years, and he'd be damned if she wasn't going to get sorted into Slytherin when her time came.
Draco sighed and rolled on his side to look Harry in the eye.
and has been for the past seven years, is a volunteer emergency Healer with more field experience than half the emergency and trauma team in St Mungo's put together."
Malfoy’s hand moved quickly, spinning his wand in tight circles around his wrist, if he concentrated, he could feel his magic imbue his blood.
“Was that a question?”
“So do you, aren’t you going to be late?”
“You’re not. Want to try again?” he offered, clasping his hands behind his back. Clearly this man was no threat and he wanted to play with him for a bit, he never got to have any fun these days.
One last note, for real.
“Ok…” Harry replied just as easily. He was starting to learn this dance with Malfoy, about him setting up clear boundaries. Malfoy would say no, Harry would take a step back and then Malfoy would take a step closer. This time though Harry didn’t have the patience to wait “Why?” he asked softly, he knew he couldn’t push Malfoy on it, but he’d never denied Harry explanations, and Harry needed one of those now.
Malfoy nodded and then his eyes settled on Harry. "Potter, were you looking for me or is this a lucky coincidence?" he asked with a casual tone that set Harry's blood boiling.
"It's a garment fit for a warrior." She nodded.
Some truths are revealed, some skin too.
Harry bit his tongue for Hermione's sake, but his blood boiled whenever he saw Malfoy surrounded by simpering people, falling all over each other to express their gratitude. It was a mockery of what they were doing, a distorted mirror, and a disgusting repeat of the same prejudice and privilege structure that destroyed their community. Two women of colour were doing significant work to rebuild the community but it was the white fascist putting plasters on scraped knees and kissing babies that got treated like a hero. And Malfoy let them. He must have missed having his crew of yes men; this must be a nice nostalgic moment, feeling like the big man around.
“And Harry, Draco is
"Seriously, Potter, where are you taking me?"
His eyes lingered on Malfoy, every day struggling to channel any magic without his wand as a conduit but trying all the same to break from those stringent rules. As the end of March approached fast, Harry felt the community shift around him, the excitement spread through children and young adults alike and he found himself smiling more, sending a spare thought to the Patils, probably preparing to celebrate Holi back in London as well.
“Would you mind?” Draco asked, nodding towards the mirror as sat on the bed to tie up his shoes.
"Potter…" he whispered, hesitating to reach out to him.
Zabini still swung by on day two of Draco’s trip, probably to check for corpses, and he stuck around for tea.
“Shut up, it does not!” Potter replied with a small laugh “Now you’re just fucking with me” he chuckled shaking his head.
Draco wasn't sure how much help he could be in either department, so he followed Healer Gupta's lead in the hopes of at least learning some new techniques to employ. He kept an eye on Granger, discussing a plan with Professor Chambers to leverage whatever influence she might have for some more resources to try and avoid the incident repeating itself.
“They’re pretty cool.” Harry confirmed “They were the ones who got me here in time so Malfoy could put me back together.” He pointed out, earning himself a satisfied nod from Healer Dana.
She recognised the order and simplicity of a low resource operation as they slowly made their way through, past the Magizoologist pavilion and the kitchens, towards the medical tent.
for a chat.
As soon as Harry finished eating Malfoy got busy setting up for the rest of the tests.
“Oh.” Now Harry wished he hadn’t pushed. It
It took him a good few minutes to find his way back to the foyer and he was still fuming when he got to his bedroom. He barely got a wink of sleep, replaying every word Malfoy threw at him in his mind. He couldn't stand the thought of working with him around for months.
Draco hummed softly, burying his nose in the crook of Harry’s neck. “What else?” he encouraged him. “What do you truly desire?”
"This isn't right" He murmured. The sight was foreign, it sent a shot of disgust through him. This wasn't him. It was all wrong.
“You too, mate” Seamus replied with a fond smile “Come on, play with me.” He told him, turning the board.
"Is it time-sensitive?" She asked.
“Do you really have nothing better to do than stay here and collect my dreams like divination homework?” he asked Malfoy.
“I’m good.” Harry replied “Rough night?” He asked as Malfoy checked him over. He shrugged under the questioning look he got as an answer “You don’t look so fresh” He pointed out.
After a few minutes the wrinkly face of Charles Bonhomme appeared in the mirror, his dark eyes glinting behind wire rimmed glasses as he smiled at them from a high-backed armchair.
He told him so explicitly when they went to visit the enclave on Gharapuri. They were on a speedboat flying over the waves towards the island when Potter brought it up apropos nothing.
Draco hummed, leaning back against the chair and sipping his tea. "Last known guru present?"
“Actually, no.” He looked up at him with a small grin. “I don’t hate to say it at all,” he amended before continuing a little more seriously. “You look like shit and you need to take care of yourself. There’s only so much Soup can do for you. Pansy and I are worried, and so is your mother.”
"You're right, mon chou, I'm sorry, I'm just teasing." The ease with which Malfoy bent to Teddy's reprimand made Harry's breath catch in his throat. Who was this man? "Truth is your godfather was the better seeker, but that's just about the only thing he bested me at." He amended.
“You want to help me open all these letters?” Harry asked him eyeing the stack of envelopes on the nightstand.
“You should be.” The elf nodded, pushing the front door open.
Draco nodded with a soft hum. “So, what is it that you really want?” That was the million-dollar question in the end.
"He paid for it?!" He couldn't believe Hermione would have the gall to put it that way.
“Malfoy,” Ron sighed, shifting a little so he could get comfortable with Hugo strapped to his chest.
"Oh, hello, Potter."
The Privacy Charms around their table allowed the conversation to flow easily, undisturbed by the other patrons of the restaurant and, as captivated as Draco was by Healer Gupta's recount of the end of her field training, channelling the change of the season and oncoming monsoon to cleanse an entire family's curse damage, Granger's self-satisfied smile didn't escape his notice.
"I'm fine," he lied, but couldn't bring himself to reject what little comfort she still had to offer him.
“It’s the first two elements of my vow of non-maleficence,” he replied, “it’s very similar to the one muggle physicians take, I’m told; except in my case, much more binding. The first part means ‘do no harm’ the second says ‘care for’. There is a third part that calls for healing.”
“Oh, I don’t doubt that, you’re just not the easiest patient, and I don’t see Malfoy being the type to put up with that.” Seamus replied.
“You want to come with, Soup?” Harry asked over tea, “You probably have more experience with magical houses than any of us, that one specifically,” he pointed out.
"I'm not some kind of mercenary, Granger, you have the trained monkeys at St Mungo's for that." Malfoy didn't bother to hide his distaste as he pushed his hair back from where it stuck to his forehead with sweat. "And I assume you're aware there is no love lost between England and I these days."
is a better headline than ‘
“Know it? Unlike you I do work here,” he pre-empted him, lifting his chin a little.
Draco nodded with steadfast confidence that grounded Harry in the reality of it.
Potter seemed hesitant at the idea.
Potter didn't even ask him to come along with him to the Golden Temple, as if he knew that Draco would follow him wherever he led, as if he knew how addictive it was to stand under his eyes and have his complete attention. He rinsed his feet in the water basin outside the temple door and covered his head, following in Potter's every step along the decorated corridor. He watched the awe flood his face as he took in the intricate decoration of the ceilings and the strong columns holding the structure up. He felt warmth spread in his chest at the way Potter’s eyes widened and his breath caught at every turn, and with all the art surrounding them, there was nothing Draco wanted to look at more than Potter’s face filled with childlike wonder. He let Potter set the pace, lingering and walking slowly across the wide rooms, he waited quietly when he stopped to pray in the comfortable cool air in the middle of the temple, surrounded by strangers that shared with him more than Draco could hope.
Harry shrugged “I slept through the night” He replied “But I got the weirdest dreams, really vivid and really boring.” He mentioned.
“Yeah, but why did you let me stay there? It was...” intimate? private? “personal.” Harry settled on the supremely unsatisfactory definition for what he’d just felt. He looked up at Malfoy, trying to understand why he’d be so ready to show that kind of vulnerability so openly, without reserves. He had no doubt Malfoy could have kept him out if he wanted to.
“Debatable. Do you want to finish our game?” Harry asked.
There were so many things Harry wanted to explore Draco didn’t know where to start. In the end, he left himself with the options open, setting out a couple candles, ropes, and a couple other toys he’d seen Harry eye with open want.
Granger narrowed her eyes at him. "It's not his style," she pointed out. "Do I need to worry about you two?"
“No, you’re not a guest of theirs or you wouldn’t have lied to me in the first place,” Draco cut him off again. This one was too easy, he hadn’t even had to try and the man was ready to wet his pants. Draco squared his shoulders and took a purposeful step towards him.
I'm incredibly happy with the ending of this chapter and I cannot wait to hear about what you think about it. Things are starting to ramp up and comments make me happy to write more, so be nice and feed a writer.
” by firethesound, first of all thank you, second of all it was done on purpose.
“Forgive me, Healer Malfoy, but the trainees are needed for a seminar with Healer Andrews.” She informed them. Malfoy turned around when he heard his name, nodding at her.
"But you're the better Healer," he insisted.
“They are?” He asked, wide eyes trained on her.
“No, that’s just what my father used to bring her all the time,” he replied. “Nice try but you need to be more critical about the information you extract, especially if you make deductions based on circumstantial evidence. Better luck next time.”
“It’s supposed to track magic flow, but you’re too bafflingly powerful and your core, as partially depleted as it is, still makes it cluster, so I can’t get a read.” Draco replied, ignoring the hair that had slipped out of the knot at the back of his head as he went to check on the blood, which was of course inert.
“No, he went to help Mummy’s friend.” Rose provided helpfully. Harry turned from her to Ron, both eyebrows raised in a silent question about this friend of mummy’s that needed help on a Sunday morning.
Malfoy hadn’t nicked him once so far, and Harry was sure he wouldn’t. But he could. He could do anything he wanted, and he was giving Harry a thorough shave, telling him in a low soothing voice how Pansy and Daphne were about to leave for France and then Milan to showcase Pansy’s new collection. He caught some mention of Blaise missing his wife terribly and becoming mopey and needy and clingy whenever they left… There was an unexpected fondness in Malfoy’s tone, but Harry was too busy ignoring his embarrassing erection to pay too much attention to the finer details.
"Well, you could start by defusing the curse. There is an artefact on the bottom of that pool. I've seen one like it before. It leeches off people's magic, funnelling it into a specific spell, hence the isolation around the room. It was widely used during magical warfare by the empire, but was deemed too unreliable to use between civilised people."
In a spot he couldn’t reach with his one usable hand.
He was just starting to commiserate himself when Soup appeared with a resounding crack, holding the chessboard with one hand and a packed lunch with the other.
"Oh, no, Sādā Sāpa has property to oversee," Taranjit told him, taking out a folder from a messenger bag. "All the paperwork is in order and the restorations were made according to direction," he told Draco, handing it over.
Sorry about the beard, I know some of you loved it but it had to go.
"Yes, Healer Malfoy."
"Sādā Sāpa, I was starting to think you would never come!"
There's a lot of classical music in this one.
“She’s upset,” Soup stated as if it was obvious.
“Potter is right here, you know?” Harry mentioned, trying to cut the tension, waving his good hand a little.
” and “
“You could lose your arm, Potter. Permanently,” Malfoy told him, urging him to reconsider, trying to bring home the reality of the situation.
“Y-es.”
It took Draco weeks to plan the perfect scene for Harry. That first fantasy he’d seen inside Harry’s mind so many months before was branded in his mind, and he wanted to give Harry that, he wanted to give him everything he wanted, take the burden of having to think and decide, let him just
"Are any of these people still alive?" he asked, pointing at the lower collateral branches.
You know the drill, I'm still living wild without a beta, any mistake comes only from my own hands.
“You skipped tea last week and Teddy would not have it.” She replied, smiling at her boys.
The British delegation met up with Healer Gupta and her trainees at a secluded bend of the Hoogly river. They were a good ways away from the city centre of Calcutta but they were in no way outside of its limit, either. They all loaded into a low and wide wooden boat. Draco felt it when they crossed the border of inconceivably sturdy Muggle-Repelling Charms and floated slowly along a new branch of the river that hadn't been there a moment before. They docked not long after that, on a small island emerging from the murky water of the river. The group split up as soon as they got off the boat. Granger took Potter, her Charms Professor and Miss Yuvarani to go meet the elders and start exploring the possibility of establishing a new gurukul for the community. That left Draco with Auror Foster, who looked for all intents and purposes like she'd lost a bet to Potter and she suspected foul play, and a St Mungo's Healer he hadn't bothered learning the name of. Along with the Bengali Healers and Miss Rana, they were tasked to open up shop at the temporary medical centre and investigate the general state of the population.
Ron left right before dinner, when Hugo started to get fussy.
“What does it mean?” Harry asked, looking back down to the sharp crisp lines and the intimately realistic feel of the scroll on Malfoy’s skin, the curl of the paper, the warmth of the shadows.
"Come in," he called, pushing himself up and Summoning a robe, quickly tying it around his waist as Potter walked in with a covered tray.
"Allow me to dispel the notion that England is paying for me in any way. While it may have been Ambassador Granger who tracked me down personally to recruit me for this diplomatic mission, I'm here at the pleasure of the Bengali government, who is paying for my stay. But that's not what got your golden panties in a twist, is it, Potter? You don't care about something as vile as money."
“Good for her,” Draco hummed, settling back down between Harry’s legs. “And good for you.” The two of them had always made quite the handsome pair, and the thought of Harry enthusiastically receiving a good dicking from Ginevra made Draco reach down to open his trousers to relieve the uncomfortable pressure around his cock.
"What I need, you cannot give me. I need for my roots not to have been burned out of the ground. I need for my house not to have been destroyed and torn apart, for my family not to have been eradicated."
He didn’t turn around when Draco joined him on the balcony and hesitantly placed a hand over Harry’s on the balustrade.
Ron nodded and dipped a bit of bread in his soup.
“You should have seen him, Harry,” Ron chuckled before launching in a horrible imitation of Draco. “I know most of you are functional illiterates, but even this dishrag clearly states that the Healer involved in criminal activities got killed in the raid!” Ron waved his copy of the prophet with unmatched fury. “As you can see I am very much
“He showed up and asked for help,” Ron replied, glossing over the fact that he showed up in the middle of the night in his pyjamas.
“I suppose it could work.” Bonhomme conceded “but it’s unpredictable. A four handed draw from the magical core with the healer as conduit would be safest.” He argued.
"Have you no shame?" Harry accused him, the words burning in his throat. "Sāhab-ji." He spat the honorific like it was poison. "It always comes back to your ego, doesn't it?"
Draco’s eyes snapped up from where they were roaming over the newly exposed skin.
Hermione was just happy to see him frequent the library without being externally compelled, and Ron was all too eager for him to entertain the kids with tales of tigers and rain and colours and songs.
“Yeah, at least I got to sleep tonight.” He replied, pushing himself up a little “Anything new on the prophet?” He asked.
"Not yet." Pansy summoned a stool in front of the mirror "Sit." she ordered. He did, still staring at himself in the mirror. The perfectly creased trousers, the belt, the hair, he was only missing the darned cane. He took a deep breath, feeling the waistcoat resist against the push of his chest, giving him something to focus on.  He closed his eyes, focusing on Pansy’s hands in his hair and the music floating in from the living room, the slow build and flow of the strings lulling him back into calm. He gradually settled into the weight of his clothes, embracing the feeling of being contained, protected, held up, his friends were lending him strength and he was going to welcome it, let it fill him.
Draco wasn’t sure where the time had gone but suddenly he was standing in the gardens of Parkinson house, a little ways away from the big stone gazebo Astoria had installed when they moved in, smiling as Scorpius gleefully ripped open his new miniature broom, filling the floor of the gazebo with colourful scraps of paper. Astoria had insisted they waited until he turned five before giving him one, but Draco wasn't going to wait a day more. The gardens of Parkinson House were filled with preschool children from Scorpius' kindergarten, every single one of them filled to the brim with sugar quills, chocolate frogs and handfuls of every flavour beans. It didn’t take long for the parents to look past the imposing architecture and internal courtyards of Parkinson House to see the spread prepared under the comfortable shade of the huge gazebo, providing a quiet space to socialize while the kids ran around on the grass, occasionally dipping their hands in the pool to splash each other. It was a nice enough April afternoon to not be worried about them getting wet. A gentle breeze cut through the warmth of the sun and made Astoria’s leaf green sundress sway as she walked towards him.
“Malfoy, talk to me, what’s going on?” He asked softly after a long tense moment of silence “please.” His fear showing in his voice despite his best effort. That seemed to do the trick, Malfoy’s eyes focused on him, clarity returning to them.
“I’m-”
We get into some action and you get the most phoned in plot twist in the history of literature.
“Right, as we were. Brown and Bingley are here to assist me on a series of tests, thanks to your partner’s input we made a list of possible causes for your current condition.” he explained, showing him a roll of parchment he’d brought with him.
“Your operation, Weasley, keep up. It’s being run from inside the hospital, at least in part,” Draco elaborated, annoyed that Weasley wasn’t following.
"Anything I needed, uh?" Harry smiled, holding the quill right above the parchment.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Merlin, Harry…”
“Forgive me, Potter, but if you don’t mind I believe it’s my job to decide that.” Draco argued, sitting down and crossing his legs at the knee “So, when did these weird dreams happen before?” He asked, getting comfortable in the chair next to the bed.
“Care to share any more details so I can try and fix that for you?” Draco prompted after a moment of silence. He needed to exercise all of his patience, even if it was Potter, Draco was a professional, dealing with patients was what he did for a living, the calling of his life.
As he passed the Structural Support Charm over to Griffith and got to work reconstructing the remaining lobes of the girl's lungs, he tuned them out, the musical lilt of Bengali words easing his concentration as he threaded soft tissue together to slowly fill the empty chest cavity. At some point, he noticed Healer Gupta had left to take care of the preventative measures along with her trainees. Luckily, Griffith kept a better grasp on time passing and reminded him to stretch every few hours.
“From what I saw, it wasn’t easy at all,” Harry pointed out. He wasn’t going to forget the image of Draco falling apart, wracked with guilt, over Blaise’s couch.
As promised here's the new chapter. We're moving along people!
"Why did you bring him on, then? He's a Malfoy, his family were probably here starving people and stealing art in the 1770s."
Again.
"Unplottable," Yuvarani provided, "and locked them under heavy Muggle-Repelling Charms as well as strict confinement spells. After that they let the cities grow as they pleased, which is how we ended up with these insular communities so close to Muggle cities.  Some are even inside city limits but cut off from the world."
/We need a Healer!/
I'm still my own beta so all mistakes are mine and mine alone.
“So, that’s what they mean when they say Slytherins are good with their tongues,” Harry eventually managed, rolling on his back, away from the wet spot.
A man burst in, carrying a little girl's body and urgently speaking words Draco didn't need to understand to get the picture. The girl looked perfectly okay, which usually meant that something was horribly wrong with her. He shot to his feet and gestured for the man to follow him inside, hoping Griffith and Miss Rana would get the message and catch up.
"They can't communicate with other magical communities reliably and can't find each other in time of need." The image of bars across a window and a lock on the door he couldn't open came back to Harry.
"Are you going to need me around this afternoon?" he asked, getting up.
Draco had to take a second for his brain to catch up with the fact that Harry was actually saying he might like to be dominated, that Draco wasn’t imagining it. He saved all the enticing images that sprang forth in his mind to indulge in later, in private, maybe in the shower.
“Gee, I wonder why...” Harry replied, wrapping his arms around Draco, dropping a kiss on his neck.
“Hey Draco, your house elf seems to think you’re a hot mess,” Blaise greeted him. He took off his robes and draped them over the back of an armchair, leaving him only with a crisp white shirt underneath and a deep purple tie. He came straight from the office then.
Disruption didn’t seem too bad when it was Teddy and Andromeda walking in around eleven, arms full of packages.
"Thank you, Malfoy, you've done remarkable work these past months and I couldn't have brought this mission home without you."
"I'm not going to work with him." Harry crossed his arms and stared down Hermione.
He could recall the last time their paths crossed, almost ten years prior, at Draco's sentencing. Shacklebolt and McGonagall had campaigned for everyone to get a fair trial and there had been massive use of Veritaserum during every step of the proceeding. He'd felt the taste of bile on his tongue as he was compelled to report on every last horrifying and cowardly act he'd been party to, the weeks in Azkaban an uninterrupted nightmare. And then Granger had stepped up to the witness stand. Draco had her screams of tortured pain still resonating in his ears as she delivered a potion-compelled character testimony.
The following week was excruciating, Harry barely got a glimpse of Malfoy. Hanson informed him the hospital had been hit with several cases of poisoning, which only worsened the ordinary chaos. To add to the general frenzy, the onslaught of accidental magic mishaps that normally hit around the end of September had come early this year. It kept the whole staff very busy. Harry was stable so he became a secondary priority. Healer Dana checked in on him daily but it was more making sure he was still alive than anything else.
"Is that why you left England?"
He noticed it as soon as he walked through the door. It was designed to be hard to miss. The obnoxiously bright lime green envelope sitting in the middle of his desk could only mean one thing:
The aching tenderness in Malfoy's tone was too raw for Harry, still too comfortable with their jabs and barbs, hiding everything else beneath them. When Malfoy held out his arm for Harry to undo the cuff, he hesitated with his fingers just shy of Malfoy's skin, his eyes drawn towards the faint scar lines crossing over his chest, now exposed by the open shirt.
It was Sunday, Ron’s day off, so soon he’d be able to wheedle news of the case out of him and finally stop feeling so horribly cut off from the rest of the department while such progress was being made.
“It’s my first day teaching, I want to look good,” Harry insisted.
“You thought being a healer would assuage your sense of guilt over your involvement in the war, Master Malfoy,” he replied without missing a beat.
Harry rolled up his sleeves and walked up to the pond, trying to make up the shape of what was lying on the bottom.
"You weren't even done with training at the time. It's not your responsibility to vanquish every single evil in the world," Malfoy replied sounding annoyingly reasonable. Harry wanted to argue that maybe not every evil but this specific one was his responsibility to vanquish, but Malfoy was already asking about the night and any change after the last rounds of tests.
Before Harry could probe deeper and ask about the sustainability of such an arrangement, Hermione and Malfoy stepped out of the elevator with the other three members of the British delegation. Hermione had changed into a light anarkali suit in shades of cream and gold that complimented her dark skin wonderfully. She'd tied her hair back in a bun and looked like she was ready to tackle anything. His fellow Auror, Sabrina Foster, and Professor Chambers were in semi-formal sets of robes that couldn't have been comfortable if not for the Weather-Control Charm running in every room of the hotel. Griffith seemed to be trying his best to look as unassuming as possible.
Soup inexplicably started splitting his time between Grimmauld Place and Draco’s apartment, much like Draco himself. Grimmauld wasn’t very close to the hospital, and it wasn’t connected to the public floo network, Harry had only connected it to the Burrow, Ron’s and Andromeda’s, but it did its very best to make Draco feel extremely welcome whenever he came over. Appealing to his more hedonistic side apparently was a winning strategy, and Harry couldn’t be more pleased with his house working with him to keep his partner close. Draco was over often enough that, when he wasn’t, Harry started missing waking up to him cuddled up to his side in bed, seeking out Harry’s warmth during the night.
Utkarsh Bagh = flourishing garden
“Are you sure you’re good to operate?” Potter asked softly, looking up at him with a mix of concern and uncertainty on his face. He’d lost all credibility in Potter’s eyes, and he didn’t even know the half of it, he’d acted like a first year trainee, he should have known better.
"I asked for a special furlough for you, so you can come visit them with me." He told her eventually. There weren't many chances for his mother to leave the manor and he wished he could accompany her back into the world on a more joyous occasion, but those were their circumstances.
“Aren’t you going to open it?” Harry prompted, when it became clear Draco was stalling.
Laennec Hospital had grown a lot in the ten years Draco had been away. From a small peripheral medical centre, it had become a first-tier research hub, with great momentum going forward, and they still wanted Draco to be part of their team.
“You’re going to be ok, Potter.” Malfoy told him again, meeting his eyes and holding his gaze for a moment, there was certainty on his face and Harry nodded slowly, willing himself to believe that Malfoy knew what he was doing.
“Malfoy?” he called softly, watching his slender wrist bend and flick his wand in a flourish that by now was intimately familiar.
"I don't think I have anything to wear with this colour," Harry commented. "I will have to go shopping."

“What about your training in Occlumency, is he good enough to hold secrets?” Blaise nudged his forehead to bring his attention back to them and not the danger looming over Potter.
They did end up getting street food, because Potter was like that. Draco ran a few diagnostics before he allowed either of them to eat anything out of a cart, but he had to admit the panipuris were indeed delicious, almost worth getting caught halfway across the city when another storm set in. Umbrella Charms were completely useless. They Apparated to the closest spot and ran the rest of the way, the warm rain sluicing down their faces as they ran full pelt against the rising wind laughing with the roaring of the approaching storm. They both looked like drowned rats when they finally made it back to the hotel and the receptionist offered to arrange a restorative soak at the spa to make sure they didn't catch their death. Still completely out of breath and full of unexplainable energy, as if keyed into the storm building right outside, Draco could only nod, knowing Potter was doing the same behind him.
“You know what I mean, the truth?”
Harry nodded, “Yeah, they talked too, you know, Parseltongue, but they talked, I think they bit him,” he confirmed.
He did end up visiting Paediatrics once or twice and, much to everyone’s delight, he lost a few more games of chess, not all of them on purpose.
's fault, her and the discord squad are a bunch of horrible enablers.
“Setting boundaries, good, Potter. What are they?” Zabini nodded with a pleased smile and a twinkle in his eyes.
" Malfoy replied. "And in case you haven't noticed, I'm not really in the position to do much about it."
“Come here, you’re not going to be the person who shows up late when they work at their own house.”
“I always have time to discuss my work with young healers. And, guérisseur Malfoy, gros merde.” Bonhomme told him, waving a hand at him as he cut off the spell. The halo of white curly hair lingering for a moment on the surface of the mirror as it went dark and then went back to reflective. Draco was going to need all the luck he could get to sort this out.
“You’d be surprised at how dirty administrative work can get.” He replied with a small smile.
"Sit."
Proceed without worry, we're out of the danger zone.
“I hate it, Blaise,” Draco sighed rubbing his eyes.
“Good, that’s settled then.”
“Ah… I shouldn’t let you back here...” McReary hesitated.
“Naughty Potter,” Draco tsked, failing miserably to keep the fondness out of his voice. “So...” He prompted, sliding both hands into Harry’s hair, scratching his nails lightly onto his scalp. Harry’s eyes fluttered closed as he tilted his head back to follow the touch of his hands.
We're nearing the endzone and things will start to precipitate pretty quickly from now on.
"I am," he replied noncommittally.
lying to you, had been since almost the beginning. I should be the one to apologize to you. For manipulating you and gaslighting you and bringing your own best friend into it. I deliberately hurt you, twisting the knife in your guilt to make you back off when you got to close to the truth. And as much as I might want to I can’t apologize for that, because I’m not really sorry. It kept you and everyone else safe, I can’t be sorry for that. But hurting you in the process…” Draco swallowed hard, trying to fight the lump in his throat. “You know I have many things to regret, and this doesn’t even come close to a satisfactory apology, but know that what I did, hurting you, is coming close to the top of my list. Despite what many may think, I took no pleasure in hurting you like that.” Draco’s eyes were shining with the steadfast honesty of his admission, and Harry wanted to believe him so badly.
He almost forgot Malfoy was there at all as they chanted the puja in front of the decorated stack of wood and dry palm leaves. His heart beat to the tempo of the chanting. The wood was set ablaze and he smiled as the night was lit up by the warm light of the fire, its heat licking at his face as he slowly walked around it.
They took a seat on the floor in the rapidly filling langar room.
Diana Damrau is an actual person and she indeed played the Queen of the night at the Royal Opera House of London wearing truly stunning costumes
“Should I be expecting that kind of proposal as well?” He joked, spreading a hand over Draco’s chest, a small smile tugging at the corner of his lips.
“Well, I have two functioning arms and an intact torso. I still look fresher than you.” Malfoy shot back.
“And you’re still convinced it’s a bond?” he asked unconvinced. Harry nodded confident in his assessment of the situation, it was just a very boring one.
Harry didn’t have much time to get bored once Malfoy left, almost immediately nurse Hanson came in to check on him.
Maybe he just didn’t want to deal with him.
“What makes you think it doesn’t right now?” Malfoy countered, gently squeezing his arm to test the growth of muscle under the frail skin.
"You got me to London only to make it easier to corner me and get me on board with another mission for you, Granger, uh?" he surmised after listening to the two of them lay out the details of the next trip.
“I am” He replied, stepping back away from the bed. “I’m sorry for interrupting, I’ll leave you to it.” He added, a little stilted, squeezing Teddy’s shoulder once before letting go of him and turning to Andromeda. He bent down to kiss her cheek “I’ll come by for tea another day if you’ll have me.” He murmured. Andromeda nodded, cupping his cheek in a way strikingly similar to what she did with Harry.
Harry delicately pushed deeper inside Draco’s mind. He found no resistance as he waded past the haze of fondness and affection that coloured Draco’s thoughts in that moment.
Nurse Hanson wholeheartedly endorsed his plan and helped him put on a shirt, the buttons entirely outside the realm of his current abilities. She also produced a sling and helped him slide his arm into it, nodding at him in satisfaction.
“I didn’t know,” Draco replied, almost apologetic, he could have restored it if he’d known.
“A fantasy, it’s entirely natural, we all have them and I won’t hold it against you.” Malfoy finished for him, annoyingly in control of himself. Harry’d just accidentally shown himself on his knees begging…
“It was too easy to scheme behind your back.” It was barely a whisper.
When they emerged from the arches back into the midday sun Potter turned to him, almost hesitant, an expression Draco had yet to see on him.
“You’re very knowledgeable about my work, Healer Malfoy.” Bonhomme commented with a warm smile, pushing his glasses up his arched nose “It could be a bond, but there’s many reasons why a host may not flush out the residue.” He told him “It happens because the residue isn’t… how you say? A stranger to the man’s own.” He explained “If I get cursed with my own wand for example, or by my children, my magic knows them, it has a hard time pushing them out. Much simpler explanation than a spontaneous bond, non?” He tilted his head to the side, rubbing his cheek for a moment ad he thought
Blaise hummed “I’m very happy to hear you say that. We move to expedite the proceeding, given Healer Malfoy’s collaborative disposition towards the committee and the abundance of evidence.” He stated with a conciliatory smile, the elegance of his performance was mesmerizing, he was playing Andrews against himself.
I'm fully aware Hermione is going to get up to some questionable practices in the next chapters when it comes to confidentiality and she's basically in constant conflict of interest from here to the end, but it's all in good fun, don't @ me. (It's funny because I'm anon, so you can't @ me until the end of the fest)

“Are you still listening to me, Potter?” he asked after a moment.
“Finnigan?” He vaguely remembered a Gryffindor in their year with a penchant for explosion, certainly couldn’t be the same one.
“Say, McReary, is there any chance I could take a peek at the logbooks to know when the next shipping of ingredients comes in?” he asked, as polite and agreeable he could manage, unthreatening as he could ever be.
“Are you going like that?” Harry asked, eyeing the towel wrapped around Draco’s hips.
What to say about this chapter? It's kinda short and not much happened at all. The action got left out. But sometimes that's how it goes.
"Ah… I heard about yesterday," Harry said the only thing that came to mind.
"I'm sure you will," Draco replied, pride filling his chest. He glossed over the fact that his own father had bought his way onto the team. Scorpius wasn't paying attention to him anymore anyway, already running off with Hugo, offering him a turn on the broom. Pansy joined him under the magnolia, she brushed a hand down Astoria’s back as she headed to the gazebo to take over hostess duties.
Harry grumbled something under his breath about it not having been so bad. “Zabini… Are Malfoy and him a thing?” he asked.
“I’m hoping this might make you reconsider that,” she told him, sliding the envelope to him.
The first time Harry joined Draco and his friends for an outing at Sadistique, it wasn’t nearly as scary as he thought it would be. It was in July, after he came back from the Auror training retreat and Blaise’s attitude helped demystify the whole experience for Harry. There was so much that caught Harry’s attention that he didn’t know what to focus on at first, but what made his guts twist with want, in the end, was watching Blaise kneel at Daphne’s feet, a look of pure adoration on both their faces, as she fed him snacks.
almost
"Stop resisting, we're trying to get you out!"
Harry looked at him sheepishly and shook his head.
if you want to chat.
“This time it’s putting you in the position to jeopardize your career,” Blaise hummed “Is he worth it?” He asked, wondering if Draco was ever going to let go of his weird thing for Potter. Some days Pansy and he thought it was over but those two always found a way back into each other’s orbits, it would have been funny if it hadn’t been maddening.
“Yes, and then?” he prompted.
in danger, Harry realized.
“How else are you going to learn, Potter, from staring longingly into my eyes?” Malfoy asked, unsheathing his wand and pressing it to his temple. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes for a second. He slowly pulled a long, silvery strand from his head, his shoulders sagging when it detached, hanging from the tip of his wand before he dropped it into the swirling liquid of the pensieve.
As usual thanks to
“In the coming days I might not be able to be as present as I’d like so she will be taking over for me when needed.” Harry could swear there was an unsatisfied edge to his voice, a displeased angle to his lips, like this whole thing was an annoyance to him and Harry immediately needed to know why. “Aadhya, I’m sure Potter doesn’t need an introduction.” She nodded with an amicable smile.
“How did it go?” She asked, standing to get the robes off of him and back into the garment bag.
“Has this happened before?” He asked as he flipped the chart to check that they didn’t change the ingredients of his painkillers, but no, they were the same Murphy used and the dosage was the same. Potter could have started developing a sensitivity to it, given the frequency of his visits to st Mungo’s.
“Not much. It’s like… a phantom sensation? Like when you can still feel it after something touched you?” he tried to explain it as best he could, while Malfoy traced his palm and his wrist with his fingers in a way that seemed designed to derail any coherent train of thoughts Harry might try to have.
Malfoy didn't speak, he just looked at him blankly and Harry needed him to react, to do something, to give himself away, to make sense of it.
Harry looked down at his hand and closed the fist. “Feels fine,” he replied before spotting the purple streaks running from his knuckles to his wrist. “Woah, those weren’t there this morning!”
Harry was like spilt water, folding in on himself as he knelt down, bright green eyes looking up at him, open and vulnerable. Draco’s heart was like warm wax melting in his chest at the sight and he couldn’t help reaching out to trace the angle of Harry’s cheekbone with his fingers.
"I don't think Hari cares about that right now," Taranjit stopped Draco's info dump, giving Harry a kind smile.
“You’re stationary,” Draco told him, standing over him.
Harry resigned himself to being a lab rat for a while, trying to keep up with the exchanges happening between Malfoy and the two trainees after every test that turned out negative or unhelpful. As they crossed things off the list he could almost taste Malfoy’s frustration growing, which did nothing to help his unease with being constantly touched by strangers that had a tad too little regard for being gentle.
Draco’s hand settled, cool and strong, on Harry’s neck, his thumb rushing against the angle of his jaw, scraping against the beard. “I was always listening.”
"That's very noble of you, Granger, but you know I'm an emergency Healer, not a guru."
“For those not adept at math that means you were in a high-risk situation once every two weeks on average.” He doubled down, letting all of his disapproval bleed into his voice. Harry would usually be squirming under the weight of that look but the effect was ruined by Bingley jumping in
Potter walked with purpose, a clear direction in mind, and made them weave among passersby for almost half an hour until Potter found what he was looking for: an arc sketched in coal on a building that used to be white. As soon as he touched the tip of his wand to it, the grime disappeared from the wall and the lines of it became crisper, opening a passage to what looked like a wide garden. Potter walked through first, and Draco followed, letting the passage close behind him.
After leaving Potter’s room Draco went back to his office. He had a report to write to the Auror department, detailing Potter’s status and the estimated time he was going to be unfit for duty. Threading the line of patient confidentiality on those was always a delicate balance, especially given the fact that if he didn’t make it stringent enough Potter would try to work around it and get back in the field before he was ready. On the other hand if he gave out too many details it would most definitely get leaked to the press and make a pr mess for him to deal with.
"Come on, Potter, don't make me beg, the water is wonderful," he murmured, listening for Potter's breath, still hesitating at the door. "I promise I won't peek."
“I just want to make things better,” Draco whispered, his voice raw with the effort not to let go, his eyes getting watery as he tried desperately not to cry in front of the enormity of that task, one he could never measure up to.
He'd left in a self-imposed exile, dedicating every day to training and working for free to offer relief to people hurt by the system he'd profited from since before he was born. And yet it wasn't enough. It would never be enough for Potter's anger to stop being justified. But that didn't absolve him from trying.
No warnings in this chapter, it's all fine and dandy (in the context of the story you're reading)
Both.
“Good,” he purred, a pleased smile tugging at his lips. “Was it so hard?” he asked, running his fingers through dark hair.
"I am. This is my pro bono for the year, another thing I couldn't really do while working for the bank."
I have to thank
“Weasley, you beautiful angel of a man, Potter’s bonded to the person who cursed him. I couldn’t work it out because I assumed it was all part of the protection charm work of the building, but there was an actual person.” Malfoy ran a hand through his hair, “Oh that makes so much sense.”
He let Draco push the briefs down all the way and reveal himself, completely naked and just as comfortable with it as the first time he stripped in front of Harry. Under the warm sunlight, he was no less perfect than the sculptures decorating the foyer. He was a piece of art, splayed on Harry’s bed, offered up as a buffet for Harry to feast on. He wrapped a hand loosely around Draco’s cock and gave a slow tug, swiping his thumb over the head, spreading the pre-come around.
“Ah, yes, that was why you missed the girls’ early Halloween party, you were busy at a birthday,” Blaise hummed.
“I can assure you Healer Malfoy is more than capable.” Dana caught the tail end of the conversation as she walked back in.
Molly stayed well into the afternoon, catching him up with all the family gossip and then some about people he didn’t quite know, distant cousins and neighbours and obscure celebrities. Then she moved on to talk about the kids’ fast approaching new year at Hogwarts, how Teddy was sure he was going to make the quidditch team this year after the extra training they’d done over the summer. The room felt warmer and almost comfortable, less stifling with her in it. She didn’t even make Harry feel weird when he asked her to scratch his unreachable itch.
He remembered being kept in the dark while people sacrificed themselves for him, while a war went on around him and he was forbidden from intervening. He never wanted to feel like he was idling in a corner while he could be doing something useful, something impactful.
Granger cornered him one morning at the end of May and told him in no uncertain terms that he was taking a day off and he was going to spend it at the spa surrounded by crystals so he could recharge his magic.
Draco Lucius Malfoy.
“Then there was a door and it shut me out of your defences and the door was gone, so I couldn’t get back in.”
“Fine. You can play spy until I find a way to account for the new information,” Malfoy conceded, making Harry smile in triumph.
Harry watched powerless as Malfoy gradually unravelled before him. It was a frightening sight, like an earthquake opening the ground beneath his feet, the unbridled powers of nature unleashing destruction. Malfoy had been cool, in control and solid in the midst of uncertainty, seeing him blanche and crumble in the chair sent Harry’s guts twisting, he had no more secure anchors if Malfoy lost his resolve, he had no solid ground to stand on.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I wasn’t worried about me.”
"I… Actually, I don't," Hermione told him sheepishly. Somehow it had been more important to find where he was rather than where he technically owned a house.
Draco's knees gave out from under him and he crumpled into Harry's arms. "I'm sorry." It was a broken whisper against Harry's neck as his tears drenched Harry's shoulder.
“Are you sure, Soup?” Draco asked, the tiniest hint of worry behind his words. Harry knew Draco trusted the elf with his life, but he couldn’t help but wonder whether Soup was still trying to get him killed and make it look like an accident.
“I want more. I want to kneel at your feet and be nothing except for yours.” There was a raw edge in Harry’s voice, barely more than a whisper hanging in the air, swirling between them.
“What would you like me to do about that?” he asked after letting Potter stew under him for a delicious second. He really shouldn’t be petty like that but watching Potter squirm was delightful, a wholesome form of entertainment he hadn’t been able to partake in for many many years.
If at some point during this fic you found yourself thinking “Hey, this reminds me of that scene in
What concerned him, now that he’d inspected the latest addition to his body, was a strong itch to take a walk. He’d been cooped up inside his room too long.
After the first day, Draco joined the reconstruction team, working on securing the structural integrity of the mountainside, fixing the houses that were damaged in the latest accident, but soon enough he was directed to the restoration experts to recover the content of old manuscripts and from there shuffled to the education team where he finally settled. He checked in on Griffith once every day, on the hike to or from the community but, as predicted, he had things handled and Draco could relax and teach kids the grounding techniques he'd learnt from Healer Gupta, or sit and learn from the tiny ancient woman Granger had managed to get on board to revive Maharathi magical practises, buried under the sprawling prescriptive English conformism. He got a lot of henna stains on his clothes and fingers as he watched teenagers reapply the ritual designs on their arms as they faded.
Harry thought about it for a moment, trying to separate the feelings from the technique.
so do yourselves a favor and go read it this week while you wait for me to work through next chapter and this pesky thing called academic duties.
“I’m not an elf” He replied, deciding to dismiss Potter’s nonsense for a moment. “I see a solution and more problems” He told him “The residue has coagulated away from your chest wound, so I can fix that without putting you in danger.” He started, a tentative sense of accomplishment sitting in his gut, daring to light a flicker of hope inside him.
"Harry, it's a cursed marking covering his entire forearm, it's not like he can very easily hide it," she pointed out placidly. "And it doesn't hold the same meaning here as it does in the UK. Not everyone is affected by it like we are. As horrible as it may sound, Voldemort wasn't that big a deal outside of the UK."
"You said you had business to attend to…"
It was over way too quickly. Harry came embarrassingly fast; all it took was one long, slender finger sliding in his loose, relaxed hole to brush against his prostate, and it pushed him over the edge, coming with a strangled cry. Draco’s free hand immediately went to his dick to stroke him through it, gradually slowing down as he milked every last drop of pleasure from him, until Harry was left boneless and sated, sprawled on the bed.
Harry watched him slowly up the difficulty of the positions, lean muscles flexing as he shifted the weight of his body, flowing seamlessly from one asana to the next. The precision and economy of movement and breath were exactly how he remembered them when they duelled back in school; with a wand or a broom Malfoy had always been lethal and precise. Harry idly wondered when and how did he start practising yoga. It didn't seem like something he would pick up from British high society, and yet the ease with which he moved indicated a seasoned practitioner. He was so distracted by his thoughts that Malfoy almost bumped into him on his way back to the hotel.
There was a message from Pansy waiting for Draco at home.
Sādā sāpa = White Snake
“Was it developed by suicidal garden gnomes?” He asked, glancing at him with a raised eyebrow “Because it would explain a lot of what’s going on here.” he added, tapping the list with a finger.
“No, I have to brew Potter’s next batch of potions and I have an early shift on Monday. Aadhya can’t be there and I don’t know who else can be trusted at the hospital,” he sighed.
Draco's deathday comes and goes, Harry believes he's dead and grieves him. The fic is NOT tagged MCD for a reason.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re leaving?” Harry asked. Malfoy nodded.
It's an actual Christmas chapter on Christmas day. You're welcome, I know, I'm spoiling you with all this content but it's Christmas and we're all a little nicer.
Draco never did things halfway, Blaise had known it for a long time, and when he started getting attached to Potter again, he knew he was going to go in deep without coming up for air. Draco didn’t fall just a little bit in love, he gave everything until there was nothing left to give. Not many people could handle that kind of thing, there weren’t many people Draco allowed the privilege to try, especially after Astoria.
“And what would that craft be, pray tell?” Harry asked, shifting backwards on his elbows until he felt the slope of pillows against his back.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Harry asked, narrowing his eyes at him.
“Oh, no, Harry, I wasn’t even mentioned by name, unlike a few Aurors I know. What
"Take my shirt off, Potter," Malfoy whispered, a gentle finger trapping his wrist and prompting him into action.
for a chat.
“He’s probably right,” Draco agreed with a resigned sigh, smiling when Soup’s voice came in from the other room.
I'm also available to chat
"Thank you, Daddy, I love it!" Scorpius smiled up at him, completely unperturbed by the grass stains over his presumably brand-new grey shirt, or the bit of mud on his cheek, and took the broom back. "I'm going to become great and make the Quidditch team just like you."
relevant part.
“Do you think we can ever stop?” Draco asked.
Draco only had to briefly stop by St Mungo’s once he got back to England to pick up a few things, and then he could go home. Where Harry was. Waiting and making a list of all the ways he wanted Draco to take him apart. For a moment Draco’s life felt perfectly on track.
@NanBlythe, @sutera28, @LoonyBadger, @Caterine2403 Thank you for taking the journey with me more or less from the beginning. Talking to you guys in the comments was what made this whole adventure exciting and meaningful. In particular I want to thank @Caterine2403 for making me feel for the first time the truly international nature of fandom and @LoonyBadger for being so unwaveringly supportive of my writing but adamantly refusing to enable my procrastination of academic work, if I’ve gotten as far as I have on my thesis (which isn’t that far, tbh, but still...) it’s also because of you. (Also I’m writing these in the law library instead of working… oops?)
He looked like he dropped out of a wet dream, clad in black robes, flowing around him like they were liquid and his hair done up like some northern warrior god. He had at least three layers of clothes on him and he still painted the most erotic picture Harry had ever seen. How he didn’t die from overheating dressed like that in the middle of August was a whole different question, one Harry’s brain did not have enough blood to ask at the moment. Harry was too busy ogling to worry about Teddy jumping down the bed and charging at the man with a delighted cry of “Draco!”.
“What was it he did last time?” At this point, Blaise was just having fun at Draco’s expense, giving him a moment of breath, a distraction.
Draco wished he'd paid more attention to what he was eating; the different smells of spices mixed in his nose as more and more plates and bowls were brought to the table, but he was too engrossed in the discussion of balancing a wix's magical core with their life force and their environment. He was used to North African cuisine, mostly accustomed to the heat level, but he wasn't prepared for the way bitter and sweet mixed and played off each other along with the floral notes of cardamom and saffron.
Draco shook his head. "I have to take you somewhere first." He wiped his face as discreetly as he could. It felt all wrong but if he didn't do it now, he would never get to it.
“Of course. You’ll find the details and documentation in the envelope. Let me know soon, though,” she recommended.
"I hope you know what you're doing, Ambassador," Malfoy mentioned before sliding his glasses back on his face and walking out, presumably to get back to work on cleansing clueless Muggles and reckless wizards from Nundu poison.
Harry spent most of his days listening to Hermione and Professor Chambers discuss the local history of magic with a group of ancient-looking wixen. He tried to keep up with the discussion, and the history of colonial oppression made him angry enough that for a while he forgot about Malfoy on the other end of the island playing hero. He knew that Malfoy was up to something. He didn't fall for his charm and the friendly mask he put on for everyone around. He had to have a motive to be around, unpaid. It didn't matter how many sideways glances Hermione threw at him; he was going to get to the bottom of it. It almost felt too easy when he caught him sneaking back into his room early in the morning two days in a row. He just needed to follow him next time and see where he went and who he talked to. He wasn't going to let the ferret screw up Hermione's mission. It was easy to Disillusion himself, cast a Notice-Me-Not as precaution and walk leisurely a few feet behind him, light as a Lethifold and unnoticed by everyone.
Her words cut deep. They were true but it wasn't enough. He hadn't done enough in the end and he'd done too much for it to be balanced by that. His mother was sitting straight right next to him, thin and frail, her hair greyer than he remembered it being the last time he'd seen her.
“We'll have to tell him sooner or later," she told him softly.
Harry hurried back up to his room to shower and get down to breakfast. He almost asked Foster to switch groups, given how Malfoy had managed to stay behind the previous day, and Merlin knew who he met and what he did after they left him and Griffith behind on the island. Hermione's stern look made him reconsider. He needed to gather more evidence of Malfoy's misdeeds so she would be persuaded before he made a move that blatant. He held back and tried not to step on anyone's feet, content to observe as Hermione gathered all the elders, the ones who were less removed from the last guru that survived in the community after Britain swooped in, destroying gurukuls and eradicating gurus. Yuvarani worked hard to translate the fast-paced speech of Professor Chambers. He tried to keep up with what they were talking about, charms were charms after all, but soon enough they went into the harnessing of weather and life force that was too far outside his field of specialisation to make heads or tails either in English or Bengali.
“Yeah, we’ve been putting him through the wringer with all the tests we ran on him,” Malfoy agreed. “You finished the investigation?” he asked looking up at Ron.
"And you're okay with that?" Potter asked.
"Let's hope not, I will never be able to repay the favour."
"Appreciated all the same." Bill smiled at him with a touch of cordial amusement that Draco was not used to receiving from a Weasley.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to intrude, I didn’t know you had visitors.” He apologized to Harry, still not letting go of Teddy, who didn’t seem to mind at all.
Ever since he first started he’d been under constant scrutiny and consistently denied the leeway to make mistakes that was afforded to his peers. Spite was mostly what moved him to excel. Spite and pride and a deep-seated desperation to make something good of himself. If they were going to question his every move he was going to give them nothing to question. He built up an impressive survival rate among his patients and he knew protocol like he knew his own name.
leave some love in the comments, I feed on your feelings.
Instead, Potter sat him down in the foyer and slowly retraced his lineage until Draco could repeat it back to him. It was like being eight again, sitting in the drawing room at Malfoy Manor, following with his fingers the branches of the Black family tree until it intersected with the Malfoys and then back up again the other side. As he looked at Potter, though, there was a different kind of urgency in his eyes when he guided Draco through generations of Potters, back before their name was anglicised to sound more respectable.
“Healer Gupta is fully able to hold this class without me at this point, but enjoys indulging my ego, much like you.”
but it was glaringly obvious.
The plot thickens.
The pyre built in the small town square was impressive in height and Harry was presented with the effigy of Holika to place on top of it to put the finishing touch on the stack.
Malfoy greeted her with a bow of his head. "Healer Gupta, it's a pleasure to meet you, I look forward to working with you."
“We’d been growing apart for a while and she was ready to admit it. I wasn’t. I told her some pretty nasty stuff the last time we fought about it. Ron didn’t speak to me for weeks but we all worked it out in the end,” Harry summarized.
"Why are you going through this much trouble to track this side of your family tree?" Malfoy’s question broke the silence, startling Harry out of his idle musing about food.
"I thought it was a bullshit rumour!"
You can always come over to
He turned around to find Hermione coming out of the elevator.
He ended up staying for a light dinner and only left when it started getting late for his appointment with the others. He imagined Pansy would not appreciate his tardiness. He found her already waiting in his living room, chatting with Soup. He instantly felt the stab of guilt for not warning he wasn't coming back for dinner.
“Oh, come on, you can’t be all that surprised either.”
Potter's lips curled in a shadow of a smile, "M'rnin."
“Paediatrics is in the west wing,” Malfoy mentioned.
“It’s not your handwriting,” Harry noticed, studying the letters once more, they weren’t nearly as slanted as Malfoy’s handwriting, but they had the same sharp angles and tight loops.
You know the drill by now, I'm my own beta so if you catch typos you know I'm the only one responsible.
He dropped the paper on the table and sent the note to Soup, then he sent one to Blaise, asking him if he was up for a night of legal advice that evening. The reply came almost immediately.
“No, thank you, for not giving up on this place.”
“Just the concerned boyfriend.”
"Harry, this is Taranjit Singh, Taranjit, this is Harry Potter. You two are cousins, too many times removed to bother to count, but you're of the same blood."
Harry’s frown deepened with every word out of Draco’s mouth.
Hermione sighed, pushed open the door and walked in. "I'm starting to wonder whether I've bitten more than I can chew," she admitted.
“This,” Draco replied, handing him the green envelope. “And my pretty face, you know you can’t say no to me,” he added flipping his hair over his shoulder.
"You don't have to accept it. I will turn this into a gurukul if you don't want it. Taranjit agreed it would be the best way to—"
He nodded. "It's good to meet you, Hari."
"You know you could write to him yourself, right? International post does work."
“Morning, you guys have news?”
for a chat.
Saying that he’d forgotten all about the tabled discussion with Harry by the time he got home would be a lie, but for sure some new topics of discussion had come up, and Draco needed celebrations, the kind that didn’t need extensive negotiations first.
“But I’m fine, look at me, alive, fit to work and all. You’re the one in the hospital bed,” Draco reassured him.
"I want you to get some freshly butchered meat when we get back to the city and practice regrowing tissue without the help of potions, because I have the feeling this isn't going to be the last organ we'll have to remake and there is only one of me." He tore his eyes off the girl and glanced up at Griffith's face waiting for him to acknowledge the order.
"Could be better," Malfoy replied, giving her a tired smile, "Never happier to see your face, Sahiba."
When the grey London winter turned into a tentative grey London spring, Harry was ready for it to be April already, but there were briefings to be had and arrangements to be made, specific training to be done and a million other things Harry wished could be over already.
They stopped in front of a wrought-iron gate, the metal spikes curled and twisted into delicate vines and the hinges moved silently when Taranjit pushed it open. The garden was bare, with newly planted flowers dotting the aired soil, along with what looked like an ancient tree a little ways away from the house. They walked along the stone path up to the steps leading to the arched entrance.
"I don't know how, Potter," he hissed.
The one day off turned into two because the heavy rain prevented them from going back to the island. Draco woke up to the sound of it hitting the window, obscuring the view and wrapping him in a bubble away from the world. It took a long contemplative moment to realise he wasn't going to be able to go out and do yoga in the garden.
"Potter?" Same straight nose and thin lips.
"What's on your mind?" he asked, handing over a piece of roti, a bowl of Bhindi Masala between them.
Hermione nodded and kept her eyes trained forward, trying to come up with the right words. She only had one chance to get him on board and she had no backup listed for this mission. The crunch of gravel under the tires got louder as they left the archaeological site behind, proceeding into a gorge. The smooth stone cliffs on either side of the narrow road gave her respite from the relentless heat of the sun.
Finnigan was the first to reply, telling them he’d planned to come by that same afternoon to check in on Harry and he’d be happy to sit down with them and share whatever information he could to help.
“Don’t you have other work to do?” Ron asked.
When he made his way back inside to the bar there was no trace of Potter or Granger anywhere. He ordered half a glass of champagne and toasted to the good luck of this endeavour; he would drink the other half of this drink once the job was done. It was like a promise, something Bill Weasley had taught him when they crossed paths in Egypt for the first time. The team adopted it and Draco felt for the first time terribly alone toasting on his own at a hotel bar in Calcutta about to embark on a mission with people who could barely look him in the eye.
Harry's eyes fell to his left arm when he moved to bring it to his chest. His shirt looked feather-light, white against skin that used to be milk white. Just like his face, the forearms, bared where the sleeved had been rolled up to his elbows, were tanned, and a careful look could spot freckles in the most unexpected places. Still, it didn't take much attention to see the curves of the Dark Mark wrapping around his left forearm, shamelessly on display.
"You became a better man than I thought you could grow into back when I knew you," he admitted. Hermione had been right.
Harry took a slow breath, pushing down the lump closing his throat at the thought of yet another piece of his heritage that was lost, one broken, the other still with Aberforth.
“Speaking about me?” Malfoy asked as he walked in, an ornate basin floating after him.
Healer Gupta had said something of the sort, about the environment shaping the person's magic and their magic shaping the environment in turn, until one or the other was thrown out of balance.
Harry laughed at the utter outrage on Malfoy's face at the idea that Harry would bend his entire life to avoid him.
“I’m the one who doesn’t have another day. The preliminary hearing is tomorrow.” He told her, his shoulders slightly hunched “I want to finish the job while I still can.”
Eventually the fire extinguished and Malfoy let go of him, leaving Harry with the ghost of his touch lighting up his skin. He watched Malfoy sit down gingerly, still holding onto his wand with an unsteady hand.
Comment to show support for Hermione who has to deal with those two all the time.
"Duly noted." She smiled at him, fully aware that she wasn't going to get much more goodwill from him.
"You want to do some tourism, Malfoy?" she asked with an amused smile.
"Daddy, look!" The excited scream pulled Draco's attention back to the sunny lawn where Scorpius was currently hovering five inches off the soft grass, holding onto the broomstick for dear life.
"Does it hurt?" Draco eventually asked, gently cradling Harry's head in his hand, "do you need me to get you some ice?" He offered, trying not to laugh at Harry's misery.
"A Thread Around the World," Harry replied. "I figured widening the net outside the UK would give me a better chance, and if nothing else I will have travelled a bit."
“I’m doing very well, Soup is never without work taking care of Master Malfoy,” he replied, his thinly veiled irreverence making Blaise chuckle as he walked in.
Harry wasted the morning away playing chess and napping intermittently. He was unusually tired for a man who’d spent the last few days in a hospital bed. There was a physical exhaustion making his arm heavy as he moved the pieces on the board. He couldn’t quite explain it and it was making it hard for him to concentrate on strategy. Malfoy had warned him about needing time to recover but he hadn’t expected it to be so bad, he’d felt mostly ok the previous day.
more death preparation happens in this chapter.
“Yeah, I have made a few trips round these halls,” Potter commented, scratching his beard with a little smile that was almost self-conscious if not for the glint in his eyes. He wasn’t even sorry about his unnecessary recklessness.
"Not with your bare hands, for Merlin's sake."
“Thank you, Soup” Draco replied, curling his hands around it and inhaling the scent, slowly sipping it and feeling the dark power of coffee filling his veins and bringing life back into him. Should he cut back his caffeine intake? Probably. Definitely not now. He needed it to live.
Harry grinned, getting up. "You
"One usually doesn't stack the odds against oneself," Draco countered. "How bad did Potter take it? He looked ready to Apparate directly back to London when he saw me."
Potter shook his head, "That is all temporary. I'm talking about the wiping away of culture in the name of conformity, the stunted growth of a people in the name of control. The separation, the instigation of conflict. That is what England left behind. That is what it still stands for, despite whatever mask of respectability and honour it presents."
“Sure, whatever that means.” Draco caved throwing his hands up, he didn’t have the patience to discuss muggle practices right now. “I’m going to need to draw some blood and test it.” He told Potter.
“I wasn’t the one to break up with Ginny,” he said eventually. Malfoy’s raised eyebrow and the tilt of his head betrayed his curiosity far more than his detached “Do tell” did.
Once again, a gesture from Malfoy stopped the women from protesting at Harry's words.
"Under and then up," Harry replied. "There's an opening under the waterfall that's going to take us on top. From there it's going to be just a few minutes until we cross into Unplottable land if the directions are accurate."
“Do you think any of those two things have changed since you two took that decision?” Blaise continued stroking Draco’s hair.
He didn’t have to go very far, he ran into Ron and Malfoy almost immediately, both in uniform and looking grim. Despite the context, a spark of excitement ignited deep in his chest, it looked like there was news on the case.
Harry regarded her sceptically, but her dark eyes were earnest and he had to concede the point. "I don't like it," he informed her.
"Sorry." He raised his hands in surrender. "I don't, but I suspect you're about to tell me."
"I'm afraid there have been too many generations gone without guidance, and it's only one community. There's one for every major city, let alone those who retreated in the rural areas. How can I get to all of them? What if there is no one left who remembers the way to get to the Unplottable lands?" Hermione sighed. "And then we need gurus. They are already hard to come by for structured magical schools. Even there, they rely on Western-trained teachers, keeping traditional magical practices as an advanced elective. And I don't have money or fame to entice them with to rebuild small gurukuls around the country."
"Can we please get two limoons, Baahir?" Malfoy asked the man working the stoves.
"The tidal bore always does some damage when it gets this high, but not always to this extent. People have learnt how to prepare for the monsoon so the storm doesn't take them by surprise anymore, but the surge in water and air energy can affect the magic. The storm and the tide are a kind of power to be harnessed or avoided but their magic isn’t controlled enough to do either. The wild energy inside them calls to the wide energy outside," Miss Rana explained.
“I was doing damage control while Potter did his very best to nullify all of our progress. He Apparated us, Blaise! His hand is missing and he side-alonged me because apparently, no other mode of transportation was suitable for him!” Draco’s voice was reaching a bafflingly high pitch by the end of that sentence.
Draco had done what none of them could, always just a smidge too late for it to matter, never in the way they wanted him to. He’d gotten Harry Potter to kneel at his feet, achieved Voldemort’s most secret desire.
