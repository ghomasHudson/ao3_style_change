Harry observed the wide expanse of nothing. He didn’t have many memories of the exterior of the Manor, having only been there twice in his life, and he now wondered what it had been like to grow up with so much space. The property, once overlooked by that sprawling mansion, was nothing but a humongous snowy field dotted with oaks and fir trees, and it made it appear even bigger than Harry remembered. While Harry wasn’t an architect, the potential of such a space made him giddy, and he was eager to dig into the power of the land to see what his magic would come up with. He’d felt similarly about the orphanage, his first project after he quit Auror training and launched his consultation business (
Draco gasps. “I didn’t ward the raspberries!” He bolts towards the door and Harry grabs his arm to stop him.
“Bad idea,” Draco replied with an air of mischief. “Wood and Bell are stuck under the mistletoe. Looks like they’ll stay there all night.”
Harry stares again. It’s quiet for a bit, until Draco snorts, and that’s when Harry loses control and laughs so hard he drops the plate. The squishy noise from the “cake” sends Draco into hysterics, and Harry isn’t far behind.
“Harry! I thought I’d have to drag you here!” Three steps, and she’s hugging the breath out of him. “Oh, I’m so glad to see you!”
Harry is about to say no, but then he remembers. He looks at the elf and asks, “Could you tell Hermione I’m okay? And bring Draco Malfoy here, if he’s not busy? Wherever this is. Please.”
Draco started bragging to hide how hurt he was. He didn’t know what he’d done wrong, though Pansy had tried to explain it to him, but Pansy was a girl, and Draco, at the time, thought she didn’t know what she was talking about.
The house didn’t need any decoration to be festive; the noise, the various WWW products George had sneaked under his mother’s nose, the presence of so many people casting colourful spells to amuse the children, the mismatched tableware Molly only used when she ran out of plates—it was enough.
For Draco, things aren’t that easy. When he’s lucky, he gets rejection letters. Most of the time, the Masters he contacts never reply. He’s still unsure about what he wants; any mastery in a subject he enjoys would be useful. It’s not like he has many opportunities. The Goblins eventually accept to take him on into the curse-breaking program so he can get valuable experience - perhaps he’ll end up working for them, maybe not. Still, it’s an offer he can’t afford to refuse for now, and it may become his ticket to the Department of Mysteries later.
“When in doubt, ask an Unspeakable.” Draco moved to stand up, hesitated, and instead gathered Harry into his arms.
Harry glances around and notices Hogwarts quite a few miles away. There are more fireworks, but they are far enough to be silent. “I’ll rephrase: somewhere without a view on the castle and without people.”
Potter fidgeted under the covers, and his feet, clad in those weird socks, brushed against Draco’s leg. “It’s not just talking to snakes?”
Draco hadn’t been held in his sleep for years—he’d had one boyfriend, and Theo wasn’t much of a cuddler. So when he woke up on Sunday morning, wrapped in a warm embrace with the distinct, scratchy feeling of a beard on the back of his neck, it took him a few seconds to figure out where he was. And, in quick succession, flashes of memories bloomed behind his still-closed eyelids.
As the thought of the slow development of their relationship crossed his mind, he grinned, and with a spring in his step, he passed the threshold of Draco’s parlour.
A surge of emotion boiled in his stomach. He went back upstairs and hid in bed until exhaustion claimed him.
“It’s just water,” Amanuel said before Harry could ask about the risks of his unexpected dip. “Very salty water, mind you, but you’re not in trouble.”
A haughty sniff later, and the other man’s skin lost its sickly tone. “Well, it fits my job description and our travel plans.” He smirked. “You’re not getting rid of me on this one, Potty.”
As soon as the train left King’s Cross station, Harry rushed out of his compartment and ran. His heart was beating so fast! He wanted to meet the small version of Draco. He’d been told not to expect him to be nice, but Harry thought it was dumb because the big version was only prickly on the surface. Like a giant cactus. Jim was so lucky.
They shared their new tent more than once instead of Apparting back and forth, and on the last morning, Draco woke up in Harry's arms. He froze, cheek resting on a naked shoulder. He had no idea how he'd gotten into this situation.
Warrington’s bushy eyebrows rose until they disappeared under his fringe. He didn’t say a word, and he didn’t need to. Harry remembered all too well what happened the last time he’d used magic to sort through a drawer. Ink tended to react in disastrous ways.
Another quick nod. Eyes shut, Harry kissed him, a soft pressure that made Malfoy whimper and clutch at Harry’s shirt. Harry opened his mouth and shivered as Malfoy gave a tentative lick, melting when the kiss deepened. He held Malfoy impossibly close, one hand gripping his hair and the other travelling down his back. Malfoy’s hands were on his waist, then a hot palm pressed against his chest and a leg wormed its way between Harry’s thighs. He gasped, broke the kiss and his breath hitched. Malfoy looked incredible. Spit-slick lips, darkened eyes, hair sticking out in odd directions. Harry wanted to kiss him again, to drown in his scent and taste, and he was about to when Malfoy’s hand sneaked into his trousers.
Sirius, who was busy trying to compose a letter (probably to Lupin, and he’d likely never send it, the coward), didn’t look at him, only grunting in greetings. Harry, however, embraced him and breathed in the scent of his neck. Draco clung to his shirt.
A knock at the door startled him badly enough to make him jump to his feet and grab his wand. Ron’s hand on his wrist helped slow his breathing.
A groan escapes Harry’s throat, convincing Hermione that she guessed exactly what was going on, and Harry is waiting for that inevitable sensation of being cornered, trapped, and misunderstood. It doesn’t happen.
The most tedious part of a runic warding ritual was the placement of hundreds of carved rocks at the edge of existing wards—especially blood wards that made his Dark Mark hurt. Having to carry the weight of an obscure concealment spell on his shoulders while Harry was gallivanting under his Invisibility Cloak made it ten times worse. Draco’s knees did not appreciate his current position. Crouching, trying to forget the sting along his forearm, he shivered. It was a cold September evening, and he should have known he was underdressed.
Nothing. Was this some kind of trap? A joke? Or a miracle? As quietly as he could, Harry opened the fridge and found a small Tupperware with some pasta from yesterday. No sauce, no butter, but it was food and Harry wasn’t picky. He hurried to his cupboard when he heard Uncle Vernon’s car pulling into the driveway and ate his pasta slowly, chewing each bite thoroughly, just in time for Dudley to come back from wherever he had been.
Harry drinks a full glass of water, wondering why Draco bothers buying those bottles instead of squeezing an actual lemon. “It’d taste better,” he adds after voicing his thoughts. “Less like dish soap.”
The chill of the room didn’t last, and soon Draco’s back glistened with sweat. Harry was a bit rougher than he’d been before but paid close attention to Draco’s body language to ensure he enjoyed every moment of this, especially after he came and was so sensitive. Harry had honed his observational skills from years of spying on him, and it was second-nature to be aware of the smallest tension in his shoulders, even as he slid in and out of him. Draco had tried to stay in one position, holding himself up, but he’d abandoned that idea and was now laying on his stomach with one of the blankets muffling his voice. He was so, so beautiful. Harry would never get tired of this.
Harry looks at him with suspiciously wet eyes. “Draco-” He breathes in and out a few times, slowly, then leans in and kisses him. It’s strange with the Bubblehead charm, but a kiss is a kiss, and Draco returns it enthusiastically.
He looked outside at the bleak grey skies. The holly tree by the window sagged under the weight of the snow. “You agree, don’t you?” he muttered in a scratchy voice as he spotted a beautiful bird preening its red feathers. Non-magical animals had deserted the Manor and its grove, but magical creatures thrived without the presence of the Dark Lord. The bird looked like a cardinal, but Draco was sure he’d seen it in a Care of Magical Creatures book before. Something about omens of hope.
According to Hermione, misery loves company. Harry wishes that were true. His friends mean well; they just don’t understand him. It’s okay; Harry doesn’t understand them either. Actually, that’s bullshit. It’s not okay. If it were, Harry wouldn’t be sniffling, alone in the dark, sitting in the new and (slightly) improved Knockturn Alley.
When he joins Harry in the dormitory afterwards, he knows his chest and neck are a bit flushed, and the heat of the water isn’t entirely responsible.
And that was when the door opened with a loud creak. The boys jumped apart, and Harry groaned internally at the sight of Narcissa Malfoy’s unimpressed frown. It vanished when she looked at her son.
Unlike the child’s room, this one was bare. It was very small: the double bed took most of its width and the ceiling dipped on both sides. He had a large window above the bed, which made him smile as it meant he could see the sky at night. At the foot of the bed, there was enough space for a cupboard. Two shelves were screwed into the wall. It would be too small if he had to live in there all the time, but for a bedroom, it would do, and to be completely honest, Draco thought it was a beautiful place, with the wooden beams of the roof visible and the whiteness of it all. Only the shelves were made of the same wood as the beams. The bed looked very comfortable.
Harry searched for Malfoy’s hand and clasped it. Draco held onto him, and Harry promised himself that he wouldn’t leave him alone, crying in a bathroom, ever again. Whatever this feeling was between them, the few days spent here had already changed their lives for the better.
It took two whole days before the fused skin returned to normal. Two days of correcting Defence copies, brewing pain-relievers, massaging sore wrists, and helping Harry shower. Forty-eight hours of feeding him, dressing and undressing him, spooning him in bed, and teaching him to appreciate classical music (a nearly fruitless endeavour). He’d fallen so deeply in love; there was no going back.
When Harry spoke again, he noticed that his “s” sounded a bit different, but everything was odd right now anyway. “What’s down there?”
Merlin, but finding Malfoy attractive would be his downfall. Since his Big Gay Awakening (courtesy of the portrait he now carried with him), Harry’s mind had focused on two types of people: dark and mysterious—reminding him, to his everlasting shame, that maybe, just maybe, he’d harboured an inappropriate crush on his godfather—and pale, blonde and mouthy. He blinked, coughed and crossed his arms, acting as if he hadn’t been staring. “That’s the one?”
Hermione Floo-called to make sure he was alright. She listened as he explained he needed some time to himself, didn’t berate him for it, and only requested to see him a few days later. Today’s the day.
Once Draco, Harry and Croaker were rid of the walking annoyance, the meeting took a sudden turn and put Harry on alert.
“So much for the great hero.” Malfoy’s observations continued while Noodle dozed off around Harry’s neck. He wove layers of Muggle-repelling charms around the area and hit the rock with several detection spells “Alright, Golden Boy, your turn. I have no idea why it’s doing that. It’s just a rock.”
The kitchen was only three steps away from the bed, so he was grateful for his husband’s thoughtfulness: Harry was already up and busy preparing breakfast, but there was no smell to bother him because he cast a bubble charm around the stove. One of the many reasons he loved the man and cherished every moment spent with him.
He’s ready to explain why the Transfiguration was an incredible display for such a young child, but then he hears a noise, looks up, and lets out a strangled sound. Their pet ferret, Slinky, is floating near the ceiling.
Someone is pushing, and a new stream of people floods the street from the Apparition point. Harry blinks dazedly. There’s a sudden burst of noise, loud cheers, and the mob pushes again. He’s stuck. He reaches for his wand, but no spell comes to mind. He needs to go back to the bookshop, he can’t do this.
It barely took five minutes: the employee hadn’t lied when he’d allied himself with Harry. With his marriage officially recognised and the adoption papers validated, he barely refrained from hugging the life out of the man.
Harry opens the door to the basement when the trunk almost crashes into him (Draco flicked his wand and he didn’t do it on purpose, he swears). Teddy used to have a nice room upstairs, but when they visited for Christmas in their first year at Hogwarts, they claimed the basement as their own. It’s like having their own apartment, and Teddy doesn’t mind living underground, so Harry and Draco agreed and turned that space into Teddy’s home. It has a private bathroom, too. Draco brings their trunk down the stairs, Harry on his heels.
Sharing every meal helps with that for sure: recently, he hasn’t tightened his belt like he used to, his hips aren’t as bony, and he’s discovering a wide range of flavours thanks to his desire to push Draco’s taste buds out of their comfort zone. If it gets Molly off his back about his weight, he’ll take it.
“You know, this is much simpler than it seems,” Blaise said with a small smirk. “Draco isn’t Hermione. As surprising as it may sound, he won’t need you to prove your intelligence and organisational skills. Thank Merlin, because we all know you’d suck at it.” His smirk widened at Harry’s outraged hiss. “Draco will want to spend time with you. Don’t go out of your way to impress him, because you’ll look stupid. He knows you, so believe me, you should be yourself.”
Slytherin rested his chin in his palm, elbow resting on something Draco couldn’t see in the painting. “Now that I have you both here, tell me: how come I can sense that you, Harry Potter, are a Parselmouth, yet you have yet to use that power?”
Draco had rarely shown himself in such a vulnerable state when someone could see him, yet he broke down again and sobbed his heart out when he spoke about his seventh year. The Carrows forcing children to torture their friends, the monster waiting for him each time he went home. The fear of knowing that Potter had vanished. The panic when he’d been brought to the Manor, the lie he’d told, the punishment he’d been given.
“That depends on your definition of pain. I think both you and I are well-acquainted with it. It wasn’t pleasant on my wrist and elbow, but it’s nothing like Crucio. Why, do you want one?”
“No, my wand is still tugging at me.” He cast a Revealing Charm, which Harry complemented with the same detection spells he’d used on his mirror. If he put enough power in them, they’d cover a wide area.
Warrington was not impressed, as he had the afternoon shift and would need to find the files. “Not running off would be a start.”
“You’re kidding me.” But he wasn’t, and Draco knew it. Years ago, the thought of Muggles being intelligent enough to build such a device would’ve caused him to laugh, but he’d grown out of that distorted view of the world. He looked up at the white trails in the blue-grey sky. Those were from planes, and he understood what a plane was. So a satellite would be even higher. “Are they visible?”
The rest of the school is still wary or hateful, but the attacks stop. It’s a bit humiliating to rely on the Golden Trio’s help for his safety, but he didn’t ask them to do it, so it’s alright. It’s nice to be able to get out of the common room without keeping a shield up at all times.
Cho shook her head. “I know. I’m not proud of it. Anthony isn’t, either. We should have been helping Ron and Terry from the start—did you know they’ve been working on this thing since they finished their training?”
“Are you okay?” Harry asked, feigning concern. “I’d love it if you came with me to the Burrow for Christmas, but you don’t have to.”
"Ah, the joys of central heating." In Draco's imaginary future, Noodle would bask on those tiles every day, and Harry would fill their shared wine cabinet with low-quality beverages from Lidl. He chased those images away, but they were soon replaced by explicit ones as Harry moaned at his first bite of pizza. "That good, huh?"
Ashamed of the whole situation, he tried to reassure his housemate. But of course, being a Gryffindor, Harry didn’t leave, though to his credit, he didn’t open the door either.
He doesn’t bother with his Arithmancy assignments anymore. Professor Vector hates him and fails him no matter what. He studies on his own, hoping the NEWTs experts can be impartial. He’s not sure what career he wants - who would hire a Death Eater? He has no idea, so he needs to get as many NEWTs as possible. Perhaps he can work for the Goblins. They won’t care about the Mark.
Malfoy’s features soften briefly in a way that sends a pang of something through Harry’s heart. “It’s the bags under your eyes. You look awful.”
He breathed in the scent of Harry’s shampoo and looked at him, finding him smiling at the witches and wizards dancing in the grass. His hair was still long, but the grey streaks were broad and had spread to his short beard. He kissed the wrinkles at the corner of his eyes, and Harry smiled at him.
Sirius focused on Harry instantly, saying his name with a broken voice, as if he hadn’t talked for a long time. “You—you look so much like James!”
I'm also back in full lockdown. Not that it changes anything to my daily life because I have literally not left my house or seen anyone except the grocery delivery drivers since March.
“Hello to you too, Potter.” He has a crow on his shoulder, pecking at his hair, a kitten climbing his leg with its teeny tiny claws, and what looks like a bright purple Fwooper nesting on his head. He’s standing completely still, and Harry pinches himself. Hard.
Once again, the rooms were identical. Draco had laid out his silk pyjamas on the bed, and Harry found himself remembering how good he looked in them. “You’re sure one night is fine?” Harry pointed at the suitcase. Draco only unpacked if they stayed somewhere for more than twenty-four hours.
They’ve had this house for two months, and they’re thinking of breaking down the wall downstairs because there’s no reason to pretend they still live separately. Draco loves Harry’s living room. He has time to spare now that he’s waiting for a confirmation of his Mastery and no longer has an apprenticeship to go to. He’s making plans; McGonagall approached him with an offer if his Mastery is validated. Slughorn wants to shrink his timetable, and Hogwarts is in need of a Potion teacher who can take over every pre-OWLs student. It’s a chance he may never get again. If he works at Hogwarts, he will be able to repurpose an empty classroom for his own experiments, which means he can free up his current potions lab in the house. Without the lab, they can get rid of a wall or two. Harry likes the idea of removing the upstairs kitchen to enlarge the living room. On the lower floor, they could have a bigger dining area, and perhaps a giant bathtub, because Draco hates his shower. He tried to Transfigure it and the plumbing rebelled.
He came home each evening to try to relax, but the Mind Compass bothered him, and he sunk into academic research until dawn two nights in a row. He wanted to ensure they weren't making a mistake by seeking it out, but as expected, the Compass wasn't mentioned anywhere. Draco ended up reading everything he could about similar objects, those affecting the brain and thought process. It brought back uncomfortable memories about the necklace he'd given to Katie Bell in sixth year. He needed a way to protect himself and Potter against that kind of magic because even Salazar didn't know if it could affect them without someone actively using it for that purpose. Its magic wasn't dark, after all, unlike every other artefact in those old, dusty books.
Harry stops paying attention. Soon, Molly is sitting by his side, a reassuring hand around his wrist.
A warm kiss on his cheek brings him back to reality, where he finds Harry looking at him in a way that is reminiscent of a patient parent. “Earth to Draco.”
Last year, Wood had asked Hagrid to play the part, and Draco had been horrified when he’d found himself pressed against a coat that had not been washed in decades. There had been bugs crawling into Hagrid’s beard! He’d given them
Harry had shown Draco around after a nerve-wracking introduction, and Draco had promptly been given his very own Weasley jumper depicting a dragon eating a giant parsnip. Molly had cooked a feast, serving Draco three times because he was too thin and making Harry, Ron and Ginny snicker. It was a wonder Draco could still move afterwards. He’d collapsed on a worn couch next to Charlie and hadn’t budged since. He hadn’t talked much either, but he’d watched the kids tear into their presents with a small smile on his face, and he'd let Harry wrap him in an embrace after Harry discovered his gift and was too choked up to speak. The embrace didn't last; after all, Harry knew, from having experienced Molly’s feeding frenzies, that Draco must’ve been a bit sick. So he stayed by his side, careful not to move him, listening to Gabriel’s stories. Victoire and baby Dominique, Bill and Fleur’s daughters, hung onto his every word.
"That' s—I appreciate it. Thank you." He strode into the kitchen, opened the boxes he was carrying and levitated each pizza into its respective plate, under a stasis charm so they'd stay hot. "If you want to serve us drinks, there's a 2001 Côtes-du-Rhône in the wine cabinet. I'll go change."
“Really?” he whispered, struggling to comprehend what was happening. He had a vision of her as a tiny little girl in the Hogwarts library, surrounded by a tower of books and admonishing him and Ron for not reading
. But these memories bled into reality when he moved closer, startling Malfoy, who turned around with a wand in his hand, eyes wide, nose and mouth bleeding.
When they came down from the high, Potter glanced at their hands. “You know, cum looks a bit like a sea cucumber’s innards.”
Draco sniffed, nose in the air. He hid it well, but Harry could always see right through him. Secretly, Draco was delighted that his mini-him (not so mini anymore) had seen the light and said yes to a triad marriage. Mother was ecstatic, and Father had reluctantly agreed to have the ceremony on the Manor’s grounds. This version of Draco had made him age prematurely by getting a Muggle degree and collaborating with Hermione on the Wizarding Space Project.
Harry summoned his bag, reached inside and pulled out a pile of resized books and a stack of Muggle pieces of paper. A muttered Engorgio gave them their original size back, and Harry handed him the thickest volume.
“I don’t know where you’ve been, but there was a war, and a group of genocidal maniacs lived in my home.”
He eyed Teddy from the side, noticing with amusement that the child had smeared so much icing on one of the biscuits that it now resembled a shapeless blob. “That one will get soggy.” Teddy ignored him. Eager to know more about the giant parsnip of doom, Harry straightened the parchment and found the last sentence he’d read.
Harry walked away until he no longer heard the exchange of voices in the parlour. He took the stairs to the first floor, wondering if Ron would be available for a game of pickup Quidditch after his shift at Wheezes. It was weird, being the only one without a proper job. Without his spirit-chasing assignments and housework, he’d go insane with boredom. Picking at his nails, he reached the first floor, turned to the left, and entered the room he’d turned into an office. A cup of coffee awaited him on the desk, under a stasis charm, and a scrap of parchment had been left next to it. Harry bit his lips so he wouldn’t giggle like a love-struck fool. A heart had been drawn hastily under the words “
With a suspicious glare, Malfoy glanced at his leg, parting the torn fabric and revealing a deep laceration running up his thigh. Harry shivered and kneeled by his side. “Let me help.”
Draco, sat cross-legged beside him, was frowning, and wiping sweat off Harry’s brow with a damp cloth.
“You little tease,” Draco groaned. He washed Harry’s hair in return, then his shoulders, before wrapping his hand around his and Harry’s cocks, heavy and full, and pulling with that little twist of his wrist at the end. Harry let out a loud moan and kissed him.
H.E.A.L.E.R., or Haunted Edifices Assessment and Land Examination for Restoration (thanks, Hermione) was very much in demand these days. Many wizarding families relocated to properties having belonged to people who would be in Azkaban for the rest of their lives. Harry’s line of work also allowed him to collaborate with his friends—Ron, as an Auror, had his back during the assessments; Bill and Fleur took care of any curse Harry wasn’t able to deal with; Hermione handled the legal aspect of his job, and even Neville participated if dangerous magical plants threatened the assessor.
When they take a holiday to Spain the week after, Harry is more excited than Scorpius and gives an embarrassing display of emotions when the wandmaker shows them his best child-friendly wands. They’re short, made of wood associated with peace, friendship or kindness, and they each contain a stone. Scorpius is chosen by a rowan wand with an Amethyst core. The dampener is woven into the wood and looks like a thread of gold.
“The Basilisk was a protector, supposed to be let loose on our attackers. This Chamber was built so we’d have a place to run. If there was a siege, students and staff could live here, undetected—safe. Even sealed, there was always a way to open it if one had magic, but it has been lost to time.” His gaze fell on Harry, who fidgeted. “Magical blood splattered on the entrance would trigger siege wards and force it to open. I understand that the door is now located in a privy, which was not my intent, and I also understand that one of you must have bled nearby for this to happen.”
Malfoy takes Harry’s arm, but before they Apparate, Harry takes a second to observe his expression. His eyes shine as if Malfoy was on the verge of tears, and a muscle is pulsing in his jaw. His mouth is set in a grim line. Harry realises that against all odds, Malfoy cares about him.
“He’s lucky he only lost one tooth,” Andromeda adds, before turning around and joining Arthur, Bill and Fleur near the shed.
With everything they’d both been through, Harry didn’t mind Malfoy anymore. Sharing a dorm with him and being the only one willing to talk to him at first had changed things. Malfoy was still quick to anger, prickly and snarky, but he was also funny. Harry believed he’d been truthful about his change of heart. He’d also apologised to Hermione and often worked on assignments with her — to Ron’s dismay. That didn’t mean Harry and Malfoy didn’t argue. In fact, they might be fighting even more now, but it was different. Ron called it banter, and Harry had learned about an ongoing betting pool with stakes ranging from murder to marriage. Thinking back on it, Harry scoffed. Marriage. Right. Harry blamed Seamus’ drunken ramblings. Thanks to him, news of his sexual orientation had spread like wildfire through the entire school, leading students to wonder about the nature of the tension between Harry and Malfoy. A
The painting pinched the bridge of his nose and hissed about insane people digging up what shouldn’t have been dug up, making Noodle agree that things under the sand should stay there. Harry and Draco moved away from the box.
He stopped staring, feeling the heat on his cheeks. Malfoy was standing in front of a door covered in tiny carvings of various magical creatures surrounding a coiled snake. Harry hissed and shuddered when the round door slid into the wall.
Well. Draco stares at him and feels guilty for embarrassing him. “That’s okay. You were a tad busy. I guess you had other things on your mind.”
"Thank you for trusting me with your darkest secrets." Harry made a show of bowing, his glasses almost falling into his empty plate. "Who stocked your cabinet, then? I don't know shit about wine, but even I have heard of some of those."
Draco couldn’t stomach much, these days, but this was quite different from the opulent feast offered in the Great Hall. He sat up as slowly as possible, because his arm hurt, and took a piece of the bread.
“Ah, but where’s the fun in that?” Draco purred, stepping closer and drawing random shapes on Harry’s shirt with the tip of his index finger. “You interrupted a nice, quiet evening, one I was in dire need of. I should punish you.”
Harry’s voice in Parseltongue doesn’t sound like the Dark Lord’s. That must be why he doesn’t go past “startled”.
Harry had no idea how he could still move, but he managed to climb on the bed and sit on Draco’s lap. Draco’s hands roamed up and down his back, fingers dipped between his arse-cheeks and breached him. Harry breathed out and kissed Draco, then tilted his head up when Draco slid into him. Harry was still slightly sore from earlier, but the sensation faded quickly.
He hated how his chin wobbled. Blinking back tears, he thought about the slaps he wouldn’t get, the food he could steal without consequences.
Draco frowned, bewildered and almost annoyed that no one was dying. “What’s wrong with you? Can’t undress yourself like any civilised adult?”
It seemed like Harry had the same idea since they almost collided when Draco twisted on his seat to kiss him. Their lips met, and only Draco’s reluctance to act inappropriately in public prevented that kiss from turning into a heated snogging session.
Harry’s heart aches. He clears his throat, and turns his attention to the kitten, which is curled into a ball and sleeping soundly. “I need to find a Kneazle for my godson.” There. That’s a safe topic.
“Well, that was stupid of you,” said Draco, and Harry took in several breaths, unclenching his fists and releasing the sheets he’d been gripping so tightly.
Harry was also growing a bit moody, but not enough to want to part from his godson. Draco hadn’t shown any indication of boredom or fatigue yet, so why not?
He spotted some that must have been Latin and others in unfamiliar alphabets. He wondered if Muggles learned about those languages in History lessons; having only attended Muggle school until he was eleven, he realised he’d be in trouble if he had to go back to that world permanently. What about Maths and sciences? He was good at spelling, so that was one thing, but what of those who struggled?
Harry had so many questions. What would they do now? Were they a thing? If not, would they ever do that again? He wanted to suck Malfoy’s cock, was hungry for it in a way that was alien to him. He wanted to undo him, to make him lose his composure. He tucked himself back into his pants before his cock could show its renewed interest.
I'm overwhelmed by all your amazing comments! I'll reply at the end of the month when I finish posting, but in the meantime, thank you!
Harry let him escape, understanding the urge to be alone and perhaps cry in peace. The gash in Malfoy’s leg was gone, healed by a potent lotion found in a cupboard, but Malfoy still needed to apply it on the wound to strengthen the new skin. Harry waited for him, still surprised to feel so worried each time Malfoy seemed on the verge of crumbling, and astonished that Malfoy opened up to him, little by little. They just clicked. Here, in their bubble, far from the awed stares or the angry mob, they weren’t the Boy-Who-Lived and the Death Eater, but two teenagers scarred by war, who knew all too well what the Cruciatus felt like and how a man sounded when he died. They were Harry, who spent his life trying to fly under the radar, underperforming at school, beaten black and blue by his cousin, ignored—at best—by those who were supposed to take care of him, starved and treated like a slave. They were Draco, born and raised in the lap of luxury, adored by his parents, educated and smart, expected to always do his best, spoiled and well-fed, feeling like a failure if he didn’t perform well, his pain minimised by everyone just because he’d had a privileged upbringing and thought he had no right to feel sorry for himself. How many times had Harry heard it from Ron this year? How Malfoy didn’t have a right to look so sad and lonely, because he still had his money and family?
There was a ringing in his ears, but as far as he could tell, he wasn’t dead. Harry assessed the situation. His shoulder hurt, but it didn’t seem too serious, and he could still feel his toes.
He’s relieved that Father isn’t in the parlour this time. He has no wish to argue about marrying Astoria, and he refuses to explain, again, why she helped conceive Scorpius, no strings attached, and would do it again in a heartbeat. Carrying a child for another couple is a concept that Father will never understand. Draco doesn’t care about his opinion anymore, but that doesn’t mean he enjoys being ambushed and questioned once a month. Eager to avoid an encounter, he finds his way to the west wing, Mother’s favourite part of the Manor, and smiles as she walks towards him, arms open wide. He accepts a brief hug, comforted by her floral perfume. She’s been wearing the same expensive cologne for as long as he can remember.
He and Malfoy stayed on that beach until sunrise, casting Warming Charms at each other, alternating between lengthy discussions about birds and stars, and even longer moments of complete silence. “I don’t remember,” he lies, smothering the urge to smile like a loon, but it’s too late, Hermione notices.
When Malfoy summoned a stone from the other room and turned it into a wonky three-legged stool, then sat near the corpse, Harry clenched his fists. “What are you doing?”
Number 12, Grimmauld Place was a Victorian monstrosity. According to Mother’s childhood stories, the house used to give her nightmares, and Draco understood why. Potter had already modernised it and gotten rid of some of Mother’s least favourite features, yet it still felt very much like a Black family home. He was spared the sight of the house elves’ heads hanging on the wall, the portrait of Great Aunt Walburga or the various paintings depicting terrifying creatures and tortures. The place didn’t feel oppressive nor reeked of forbidden magic like he’d feared, but it still wasn’t pleasing to the eye, and he could imagine Mother wandering those long, narrow corridors in the dark, scared of whatever lurked in the shadows. She hated dark spaces; there was a reason why she’d always avoided the dungeons at the Manor.
They move in on the first day of summer and have their first fight eight days later. The various types of plants Draco wants to grow near the gnarly oak tree in the corner of the garden are not appropriate. A firebush is a terrible idea. Harry accuses him of pyromania, and Draco retaliates by sending Loki after him. Harry explains how their new wards won’t protect the neighbours if the wind carries embers over the fence, and Draco relents. He’ll refrain from planting anything too harmful — but if the neighbours intrude, he reserves the right to unleash an army of garden gnomes on them.
“Hear, hear!” Ginny yells from somewhere behind Harry. “I can barely move, if I fly I’ll drop. I look pregnant.”
Malfoy is busy petting Pinecone, who purrs like a motorbike, when Harry finally sits by his side after being shooed away from the kitchen. “I thought you only had one tattoo,” Harry says, judging it a safe topic.
He left the boathouse to find his boyfriend again, and when he did, he hugged him and kissed him in full view of their friends and families.
Ona cackled. “No, you won’t. You need her too much. Hey, Cassius, remember how they couldn’t stop staring at each other?”
“Impolite.” Harry couldn’t help but feel a twinge of worry for Draco. Did he still have control of the land or would dangerous creatures be attracted to its magic? Old Pureblood properties had wards for a reason! Was the wardstone gone as well? What was the boathouse like? Winter had come early this year, much earlier than usual, and had brought ice-cold temperatures, colder than Harry had ever seen outside of the Scottish Highlands. A boathouse sounded like it’d be wet and freezing. “
“I promise I didn’t.” With a sniff, Potter read the same sentence as Draco, bit his lip, turned the page, and stared at the paper. Then he threw his head back and laughed loudly, startling Draco, who grabbed the stack of paper. Harry let it go, now grasping Draco’s thigh and seeming unable to calm down.
They’re navigating the maze of the British housing market and discovering the outrageous prices of London. Harry never thought it’d be exciting to try to find a place to live, but helping Draco lit a flame of enthusiasm at the prospect of leaving Grimmauld Place.
Wizards weren’t immune to Muggle diseases; they were just less likely to catch them since magic gave them additional protections or fought viruses faster. He’d known that he could suffer just as badly as Abel after both of them caught the flu two years ago. Learning about immunisation had been a revelation. He and Scorpius were now vaccinated against every recommended Muggle ailment.
“Fuck, do that again!” He kisses him deeply, tasting the sweetness of treacle tart and chocolate mousse. He’s so hard he can’t think. His fingers explore and tease. Harry calls his name in that breathless way that almost causes him to come.
His lab didn’t smell awful anymore. He peeked into his classroom and found it clean and safe. Good, he wouldn’t have to cancel his classes come morning. He turned on the MagiMusic player. (Yes, he had more than one, scattered where he usually dwelt. Yes, there was one in Potter’s quarters. No, Potter didn’t share his love for heart-wrenching, exquisite tunes—they made him
At least the Wizarding World and mobile phones weren’t compatible yet. The thought of his friends getting a hold of social media and sharing Draco’s antics for all the world to see terrified him. Most of them had no idea Internet even existed. Still, if they kept rejecting their old ways and dated Muggleborns, or chose to follow Draco’s footsteps and study in University, there’d be no haven for him anymore. Not that Draco was an expert in technology, but he
He winces as the fluid dampens the seat of his briefs. For the first time, he is thankful for the requirement of the heavy formal robes even though it’s quite balmy for the first of September.
As per usual around Potter, he wants to argue, but Potter looks so pleased with himself he can’t bring himself to do it. He’s being slowly worn down by that earnest stare and sappy smile. It’s sickening.
With a sigh Harry tightened his arms around the man beside him until Malfoy’s face was pressed back against his chest. He didn’t know what to say so instead of speaking they lay together in silence for a long time until eventually he fell asleep.
Harry took a page out of his son’s book and stuck his tongue out at the other man’s back. It felt surprisingly good.
There was a dainty clearing of the throat. Harry and Malfoy both turned to look at the woman sitting at their table. She was smiling as if she knew a secret they didn’t.
Harry rocked back on his heels and pushed his hands into his pockets. Sergio had carefully written out his mobile number on a piece of paper and slipped it into his pocket before Harry had left. When Harry felt the folded wad on his fingers, he immediately pulled his hands out again. “I am going to guess that we aren’t just talking about a geranium then?”
“Just the one leg then. Next time we’re doing it in your office with the TV, I want to watch Come Dine With Me again.”
Draco howls into his gag, thrashing his hips. His cock is impossibly, starting to thicken again, particularly with the way Potter is drinking him in. He must not have been able to see him then.
“Not even enough for a deposit on a flat?” finished Malfoy. “Exactly. It was enough cash for a train ticket from London to Paris, enough to buy myself a hotel for a weekend, and enough to get me drunker than I’ve ever been in my life. And that’s it.”
The next morning the children slept in until their pre-arranged late check out while Harry packed up their luggage. Then he made it through the tearful goodbyes with his children who were heading back to the home Harry had once shared with Ginny, while Harry was left making his way to Hogsmeade alone.
“Yeah,” agreed Draco. “And he had a habit of seducing and sneaking off with young men, ruining the marriage contracts their parents had set up for them. The Sacred Twenty-Eight had him imprisoned after they found young Lord Selwyn strung up in the attic swallowing Percy’s cock.”
It’s like being on a racing broom in the middle of a storm. Images and emotions whipping past Draco almost faster than he can process. The excitement of trying on his first robes as a first year, annoyance at Draco drawing the appraisal of Professor Snape, fury and humiliation at the sight of the Potter Stinks! badges.
Cock bobbing inches from his lips, Draco looks up, eyes flinty and filthy and licks his lips. “I’m going to suck you off, Potter. I’m going to get my lips wrapped around your cock and suck you down until you come right on my tongue.”
“Francis sent a tripping jinx at Frankie today in class, they were everywhere, that’s why I gave them detention,” Draco huffs, unable to resist the opportunity to complain teacher-to-teacher no matter how inappropriate the timing. “So, I was desperate for a shower, you can imagine.”
The bell above the door tinkled, and they drew apart as a customer walked in and asked Malfoy to help her pick out an orchid. Harry leaned against the counter and watched as Malfoy took on an air of kind professionalism. All traces of the sulky, drama queen were pushed aside until the woman had her new purchase in hand and was out the door again. Then with a sort of shiver that seemed to affect his full body, Malfoy slumped back into his chair. His bottom lip swelled out, his brow wrinkled, and he pulled his arms over his chest.
“Why?” asked Harry even as Malfoy stood. Somehow he felt he had completely lost control of this conversation, although he doubted he had ever had any control to begin with.
Harry opens the vial and swirls the liquid inside, letting the scent drift up. He’s not smelled it since his sixth year. He still smells treacle, but there’s a new scent, something he can’t quite identify but is maddeningly familiar.
The thing is, Potter’s a bit of a hoarder. He seems to keep every scrap of paper, and every useless knick-knack that every student has ever given him. One wall is absolutely plastered with thank you cards and doodles of the man scribbled in the margins of parchment. And he’s only been teaching for a little over a year. How’d he get so many?
Harry shrugged. He didn’t really want to say it. He always embarrassed himself when he tried to pronounce French, or any other language for that matter. It was probably pretty stupid of him to think he could live in Paris. “Merde,” he said after he summoned up the courage.
He gamely set up a Muggle bank account, located the nearest supermarket, applied for a credit card, and hooked up the old fashioned rotary phone to the network, even though he didn’t know anyone else with a Muggle phone number. He wandered the streets in his neighborhood, learned how to hail a taxi, and stayed far, far away from the Wizarding sector.
Draco wrinkles his nose with distaste. Harry would call him out on it, but the nose wrinkling is better than what used to come out of his mouth, so maybe he can live with it. “Don’t be ridiculous, we agreed on Christmas,” says Draco, which is annoying, but then he says; “I have a present for you,” which is still confusing.
Harry laughed about his bad pronunciation and learned how to carol in French, he drank far too many of Lauren’s awful flavored martinis and stopped for street food with Marie on the way home, that he would almost certainly regret in the morning.
“Malfoy, you followed me out to Hagrid’s hut. You got detention for being out after curfew, same as I did.”
“What are these for?” he asks, rather stupidly. He’d been an Auror for six years before becoming a professor, he knows what they’re for. He’s just surprised Draco would have them or allow Harry to use them on him.
Beneath him, Draco is trying to thrust up, but Harry’s build is much heavier, and with his hands tied and arse full it’s not hard to pin him down by the shoulders. His hips however only start to buck more as Harry lifts himself up to line himself up and that won’t do at all.
“I don’t work for the Ministry anymore, Malfoy,” explained Harry. He wondered why he even had to. Surely the Daily Prophet was available in Paris somewhere. Or perhaps his humiliation had been spread across the front pages of the French equivalent.
They work together swiftly, Draco levitating alongside Neville until the mirror is slowly covered up once more. He doesn’t try to look at it again, almost afraid of what he’ll see next, but he catches the odd flash of bottle green.
They both know he does. Draco’s whining loudly enough and his balls are drawing up in warning. “Keep going, fuck, fucking love your cock, stretching me out so good, harder, harder!”
A hand, a real hand, falls onto his shoulder. “Careful,” says Neville. “Harry’s told me about this.”
Harry actually felt his jaw drop. “You’ve got to be kidding. My head of house had it out for your house? Don’t you think that’s a bit, y’know, pot calling the kettle black and all that?”
“Just after I’d finished my training the Ministry sent me on this publicity tour to improve diplomatic or international relations, or some such rot. Two-dozen cities over two months. I was in Cape Town, Jerusalem, Washington D.C., Tokyo, Sydney, and then I was here, in Paris. The Ministry saved it for last. I think because it was so close to home. By the time I got here I was so tired of traveling, of being the Harry Potter the Ministry wanted me to be.
It was incredibly rude and it caused Malfoy to turn bright red and scrunch up his face like an angry dog, but Harry couldn’t help it. He’d completely forgotten the memory of the amazing bouncing ferret and burst out laughing. The couple at the next table eyed him uneasily.
And no, they didn’t, but Harry had rather hoped they were getting to the point in their relationship where he didn’t have to plan to spend the night with Draco. That he could come and knock on his boyfriend’s door at any time and expect to be welcomed inside. That he might be keyed into the wards even, or expected.
“Who do you think broke into your desk? Your locking spells are Auror grade. I'll give you that. It took me nearly twenty minutes to break through.”
“Potter, I send my mother flowers after I forget her birthday. I send my landlady flowers whenever I am late on my rent. I’ll send a bouquet to my accountant’s office during the holidays to thank him for taking care of my taxes. I don’t send the man I’m sleeping with flowers. That practically screams, ‘Thank you for sucking my cock when no one else will you dainty little thing.’”
It wasn’t like being at war. It wasn’t good versus evil, light versus dark. It was just him, Harry. Doing the best he could to make a difference and hoping it was enough.
“Alright, boyfriends,” he agrees and Potter lights up like a fucking Christmas tree and throws himself at Draco’s face. Draco immediately regrets his words as he’s thrown off the pillows and his head hits the hard stone beneath, but Potter’s cradling his face and kissing him so it’s easy enough to ignore the throb of pain. “Wait,” he gasps in between kisses. “Hold on.”
Harry was very nearly catching on, but decided not to face the truth quite yet. It had been too long since he’d had an inane conversation with Malfoy. “You do realize you are a florist?”
Harry’s shocked, Draco’s never so much as offered to make him a cup of tea. After this morning, he certainly hadn’t thought Draco would be in the mood for any type of kindness.
“Draco,” says Harry, careful to use his name. “If it’s a reminder, or a piece of history, or something like that, fine, just say it, but if there was a way you could have it removed, not as a hypothetical, but as a real, true thing, would you want to do that?”
“I know you aren’t upset over sex, Malfoy, or who is or isn’t having it,” snapped Harry, getting a little annoyed. He’d seen the other man parade about countless times with secret little smiles on his face in response to thoughts that Harry ‘just wouldn’t understand’ or messages sent to his mobile at inappropriate moments.
“Tell me where you’re coming from then,” Malfoy said after several further moments of huffing and puffing angrily.
“Basically,” said Malfoy. Then he pushed against Harry’s side and guided him towards the nearby café. “Here. They do the best croque madame.”
“He starts coming around every few months, takes Draco out for dinners and drinks, or on weekends away, and then he disappears without a word. No good.”
Draco starts unhooking his robes. He’d made a quick detour to his private rooms after dinner and he’s no longer wearing anything underneath.
Draco wants to demand an explanation, but Potter is utterly ignoring his moans and whimpers now, even as it becomes harder and harder to ignore the battering his prostate is taking. When it becomes clear that Potter is bent on ignoring him, when he takes a seat behind his desk with his back to Draco, he gives in.
“Yes,” he confirms. Harry’s stomach sinks a bit further, he doesn’t want to know who with but is also desperate to find out more. “It creates obsession,” explains Draco. “Not love.”
It all made Harry want to laugh and pull the blond against his chest and soothe him like a petulant child. “Why are you with him if he makes you so cross then?” he asked. It was the first time Harry had said as much, but he had been given strength of will by his recent number of orgasms.
His cock throbs, he can feel it start to chub up where it’s resting against his thigh. He’s not sure if it’s Draco’s words or the way he’s pressing into his body, for once taking the initiative and bending forwards to press sucking kisses into his neck.
Potter laughs easily, but of course, he didn’t have his orgasm interrupted by the arrival of the gamekeeper. No, he’d filled Draco’s arse with his sticky cum then fucked off. Draco had been left holding his cock and with his pants literally around his ankles in the platform waiting room while his useless fuckbuddy tried to head Hagrid off. Even then he’d only just had enough time to pull his pants and trousers up, his unhappy cock tucked into the waistband before Hagrid was welcoming him back for another year.
Malfoy’s expression did not so much as fall as it did freeze. The smile looked much more forced now. “From Mother. Yes, of course.” He looked down at the box and nodded to himself.
Harry rolled his eyes, but decided not to point out that the only person he’d had any type of conversation with since moving to this city already spoke English.
Harry with his limp, wet cock still hanging out of his trousers, smiles down at him and shrugs. “No plan really,” he says. “Just wanted to see if I could get lucky.”
“Are you counting hippogryphs?” asks Harry once his hips are flush against Draco’s arse. He’s leaning over Draco’s back, resting his chin on his shoulder, watching the muddy looking potion boil at high heat.
There was a retort bubbling angrily in the back of Harry’s throat, but he was pretty sure if he picked an argument Malfoy would leave him up on this hill, and he wasn’t sure he could navigate the Métro on his own.
It’s then that Harry looks down and sees the mess between Draco’s thighs. At some point he’d cum for a second time, completely untouched, sucking on Harry’s cock.
Draco resists the urge to make more frustrated noises. He doesn’t even have words for how out of sorts he is. He’s been soundly locked away from his cock for the past two days and he’d like it back, thank you very much. Last night he’d tried to use his fingers to pry the damn thing off and the snake had bit his thumb. Not to mention what a pain it had been to figure out how to take a piss.
It’s easy enough to imagine they are talking about him. About how filthy he looks, strung up, covered in his own cum, drool leaking from his stretched open mouth. Maybe they’re talking about who gets to fuck him first. Maybe they both intend to fuck him. Or maybe Eddie wants to fuck him, but Potter won’t let him, because Draco’s only a needy little slut for him.
“The connection was fucking fantastic,” confirmed Harry. “You, however, are the absolute worst sort of boyfriend in the world, you nearly got me off in front of Ron and Hermoine, you berk.”
It takes a further agonising ten minutes for everyone to make their goodbyes and filter out. Marietta asks so many follow up questions that Harry has to instruct her to come back during his office hours and Francis stays behind to whisper something into Draco’s ear.
“I thought you were chaperoning today?” asks Harry, knowing that somewhere nearby Neville is probably having a right time with his lot and would probably appreciate the Potion Master’s help since whatever the seventh years have taken is almost certainly potions related.
“Right, Draco.” Sometimes Harry still forgot and slipped. Sometimes he did it on purpose. “He wanted to come to a proper Muggle party. He’s trying.”
The boy chuckled and jumped out of bed with a nimbleness that Harry envied. He wasn’t quite old enough for his joints to pop yet, but he certainly wasn’t bouncing about as he had ten years ago. And his muscles protested the movement of slinging his legs out of bed after the particular acrobatics of the night before.
“Temporary obsession,” explains Draco. “You like how cock hungry I get once I’ve had a taste? Desperate to bend over and happy to spread myself open for you?”
He and Malfoy had never spoken of Harry’s relationship with Ginny past the information that they had been married for a number of years and had decided to divorce. Malfoy had never even let on whether or not he knew why he and Ginny had divorced in the first place.
Harry’s never been a huge fan of excessive touch, but he lets Draco’s hands wander. One plays with the hair on the back of his neck while the other strokes across his chest, searching out the skin in between his buttons. Harry doesn’t care though, not as long as Draco keeps sucking his tongue like that.
Slowly, he presses forward, kissing Draco gently, letting him decide if he wants to accept the kiss or not. Their lips touch for a moment and Draco’s part just slightly. It’s not quite the same as when he’d been under the influence of the Amortenia, but it’s just as intoxicating. Harry sucks Draco’s bottom lip and pulls him closer, desperate to show him how much he wants him.
“Who?” tried Harry even though he knew it was in vain. He had hoped he’d been less transparent, but apparently he hadn’t.
The vibrations are powerful, almost too much for the sensitive skin of his rim. Potter teases entry, dipping the tapered head in, then stroking down his taint and back up again.
Then Draco tips his head back opens his mouth and whines. “Need you so bad, Harry, Merlin you feel so good on my cock, so fucking good, cum on my face, Harry, come on!”
Marie was blissfully unaware of his past attraction to Malfoy, and Kate had been the one to set him up with Matthew, so Harry sequestered himself in a corner with the girls. Kate’s husband Jon was a decent conversationalist, but he was more interested in celebrating with his wife while the baby was at home with the sitter than in talking with Harry. At around ten Craig and Pierre came through, ‘Making the rounds’ as Craig explained, they invited Harry to join them at their next party which they promised to be much more fun, but Harry declined.
Harry nods but still has a hard time understanding how obsession can be sexy. He has five stalkers and two restraining orders. It’s not a game.
Thankfully none of his children mentioned his most recent shame, though sometimes James stared at him with narrowed, blame filled eyes. His oldest son had been the most upset over the declaration that his parents were getting a divorce. Lily and Albus had both cried at the news, but had quickly adjusted to the idea living without their father. James had shouted at Harry for hours before collapsing into bed and letting his father rock him to a tear-induced sleep.
Despite the truly spectacular orgasm Harry gave him on the Hogwarts Express, Draco’s still angry about being left unsatisfied. Never mind that Harry had rectified the situation as soon as possible. It’s annoying, especially considering that just last week he’d been gagging for it as much as Harry had after two months away. And Harry doesn’t want to think about if it had been two months for Draco like it has for him. He doesn’t want to think about who else Draco might have had during that time. It’s not like they're exclusive, or that they even talk about anything like that.
Immediately Potter’s mouth disappears, formed over with skin until it looks like he never had one at all. Potter makes a furious sound in his throat and moves to push away from his desk so Draco says; “Petrificus Totalus,” and his whole body freezes in place.
Harry returns the favour, and cups a hand around Draco’s leaking cock to give it a stroke. “I didn’t think that far ahead to be honest. What do you want?”
Draco’s hand tenses, his nail catching on the hair behind Harry’s ear. He untangles it gently. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“Mrs. Malfoy,” he managed as respectfully as possible, though it felt strange calling this woman by the same name as his somehow-not friend.
“Yeah, so did I,” added Albus as he flicked through channels on Harry’s telly. He’d spent the whole summer determined to find an English speaking show and had yet to be successful.
“Shhhh,” Potter soothes, pressing small kisses against his arse cheeks as his finger presses in. “Gripping me so tight, look at that… No need to hurry, gorgeous, finish your work, I’m not stopping you.”
“Now, let’s try that again,” continues Draco with that unnatural smile. He’s trying very hard to make it look like they are having a lovely chat. His new first year Slytherin’s are indeed watching, as is a table full of Gryffindors who are always ready to come to Harry’s defence whether he wants it or not. “Give me my potion now before I castrate you in front of the entire school.”
“Right near your shop actually.” Harry had realized it only this morning when he had been contemplating Malfoy’s business card and realized that it was the address of the florist shop he regularly passed on his walks to the Eiffel Tower.
“He was here when I moved in. Found him in the hall closet. Snape must have shoved him in there after he removed him from the dungeon.”
“Thank you for your help today, gentlemen,” says McGonagall from where she sits in her purple armchair.
“You’d love them,” continues Draco. “You could use them some time while you fuck me. We’ll fill you up together and then I’ll pull them out at just the right time and you’ll cum so hard you’ll see stars. I did. I wanked myself so hard, just like this Harry, just like I’m doing for you now, brought myself right at the edge and then,” his hand speeds up and Harry can’t help but thrust his hips into the movement, eyes closed, imagining he’s watching Draco wank himself with his arse full of beads. “Just as I was about to cum, I pulled the beads out. All of them, all at once, all five, rubbing across my prostate, popping out of my tight hole and it was so, so good, I exploded all over the duvet. You going to do that for me now, Harry? Going to cum all over my hand?”
The cushioning charm catches him before he hits his head on the stone and then Harry is free to tug off his trousers. He winces as the material of his boxes separates wetly from his body, he doesn’t know how Draco deals with it honestly. Standing for ten minutes with the lube dripping from his arse was certainly a test of his patience.
They break apart for another shared breath, and then Draco’s on him again, the tips of their tongues coming together as they gasp into one another’s mouths. Draco whimpers then shakes, and then…
Potter eases off and gives Draco space to breathe. “I still want to wait on telling anyone else,” Potter’s smile falters so Draco presses on. “Until Christmas,” he compromises. “Just until Christmas.” It’s only a few months away, long enough for Draco to see how this plays out, for him to be sure.
“Was there a reason we couldn’t just talk at that café?” asked Harry once he’d hoped he’d gained control of his breath enough to not sound winded.
“Chaser?” said the boy as he reached for the bowl of limes. He picked one up between his thumb and forefinger and then pressed it against the side of his own neck.
The only thing he can think as he gasps and cums all over the tile floor of Aberforth’s toilets is, thank goodness he’d made it somewhere private in time. With the way his body is shuddering and heaving with the aftermath of his orgasm, there’s no way he would have been able to hide that from his friends.
“What do you think of this lettuce, does it look a bit wilted to you?” Malfoy asked as they wandered through produce. He had his own basket draped over one arm, and it was predictably filled with far more pastries and sweets than actual food. Harry gave him credit for buying any vegetables at all.
So he told the boy his name and found out that the energetic lad who’d ridden his cock last night like a sous chef was named Sergio.
“Leave it,” he leers as his lips descend. The hand slides down his wrist as a tongue pushes in between his lips. Fingers gently caress his own, sliding against his pink polished nails as Harry wraps his own tongue against the intruder. Then just as suddenly both retreat.
“That’s okay,” said Harry. He did not comment on what a terribly Wizard name Draco Malfoy was. He didn’t want to hurt the other man’s feelings after all.
Wherever he is, Draco has obviously cum himself, because his hole is empty and the hand on his cock is gone. Instead, there’s just the gentle caress on his hip and then another down his sternum, then nothing at all.
A hand stops his train of thought, locking around his wrist. Harry looks away from the mirror to find that he’s been snuck up on and Draco’s right beside him.
He wants to refuse. He wants to leave Potter standing there with that insufferable smirk. He wants…well what he wants is for Potter to finish the job he started.
Occasionally, Malfoy would wave to someone as they passed, or shout out something in French that Harry tried to grasp with his limited understanding. He caught words like hello and goodbye easily enough, it was everything in between that was a muddle.
Harry scowled at his tiny espresso cup and waited for Malfoy to finish and somehow acknowledge him, preferably once the other man decided to remove his tongue from the roof of his mouth. Even Malfoy’s lost-in-very-important-thought look required drawing attention to an orifice Harry would rather ignore on a man he didn’t particularly like.
This is the part that Harry does actually feel guilty about. From a distance it must certainly appear that he is the most discerning wizard in the world. The truth is, as usual, far simpler than the lies and speculation spread by Rita Skeeter and eaten up by his adoring, but confused and often concerned public. The truth is he likes it.
Harry looked at him. Malfoy’s tongue was poking into his cheek now, he could see the bulge of it beneath his skin. He was probably biting it, Harry realized.
And okay, the kissing is good. That can stay, but he definitely doesn’t want to hold hands under the breakfast table.
Harry snorted and thanked the employee. Once outside, he stepped into the alley again and cast a stasis charm on both drinks so they’d stay piping hot and appetising. Then he walked home, leaving the main street to find his way to the poshest area of Islington.
Drinking in Draco’s confidence, Harry psyched himself up. The cloak offered them enough protection, as inconvenient as it was, and he tightened his grip on his wand. “All right. I’m getting out.”
Draco disagreed. Sure, it was lush and thick and not as gaudy as it could have been, but that was it. Not to mention, it had been there on Saturday already, it wasn’t
He sits there with a hand buried in Harry’s hair and a palm pressed against his chest, and he doesn’t understand why Harry’s not moving, why he’s not breathing and why he’s so still. He sees movement out of the corner of his eye, and he knows voices are calling him, but he doesn’t hear them, they’re a blur of sound all around him, and they don’t matter because Harry is not blinking, why is he still staring, why is his gaze so empty?
If Harry had to pinpoint the time when he realised something was off, it would be five months after the war, when he visited his parents’ graves in Godric’s Hollow with Professor McGonagall. He’d wanted her there so she’d Conjure a headstone for Sirius, who deserved to be there with Harry’s parents but left nothing to bury. As she was putting the finishing touches to the stone, Harry spotted what he thought was a hag, hiding at the back of the cemetery, carrying a lantern.
on himself would be a good idea right now, but Harry doesn’t even need to, because Loki flies towards his owner and drips water all over Harry’s head in the process. “Er, hi. Been here long?” Harry asks. He wants to take that camera and immortalise Draco’s beauty immediately.
Casting a spell had woken him enough to make the uncomfortable mattress unbearable to lie on, so he sat up with a loud sigh and rubbed his eyes. He wasn’t ready to leave his cocoon.
From then on, Draco had become one of his young self’s tutors. He’d been astonished when Mother let him teach him about technology and Muggle history. Lucius disapproved; however, he had little leeway when it came to Mother, as she had more sway over him than most people thought.
It’s odd, being in classes with Granger when the other two aren’t there. It’s weirder when she talks to him.
Green eyes flicked to the ceiling and back to Draco. Potter always did that when he was embarrassed. “It’s a spell. I mispronounced it.”
When they’d decided to travel back in time, the comfort of their home had been one of the reasons for their hesitation. Their friends were another.
They did not have a dominant/submissive relationship in the slightest; not that there was anything wrong with those, but it didn’t appeal to them. But they both thought their friends’ theories were endless sources of entertainment. Draco enjoyed being mysterious; his parlour was his workspace where he exaggerated some of his personality traits, and yes, he had cat-like tendencies, but he was also a dork who took the Pygmy Puffs on walks around the property and talked to Bowtruckles. He drank far too much tea, woke up several times at night, and came back to bed grumpy, spewing vitriol about possessing a bladder. He complained about Harry’s hair, Harry’s lacklustre ability to cut vegetables in even slices, Harry’s body heat in summer, Harry’s cold toes in winter, Harry’s snores when Harry had a cold, Harry’s clothes—and Harry took it all in stride. After all, he, too, found many reasons to tease and annoy Draco. It was part of their dynamic. It confused everyone.
When Harry Potter came home from school on the first Friday of October, he dragged his feet, hand clenched tightly around his latest report card. He’d done everything he could to score lower than his cousin, but Dudley’s results had been so bad that he had still received better marks.
She does not take the bait. “You’ve post from three different wizards and a witch all asking for dates,” she says once she’d finished riffling through his letters. She tosses the stack back onto the table where she must have found them and gives him a disapproving look.
“Twelve hippogryphs,” thrust, “Thirteen hippogryphs,” thrust, “Fourteen— ah— hipp—” thrust, “Fif—teen...” thrust.
Draco’s not looking at him anymore, but he’s doing his best not to look at anything really. Harry’s doing his best not to look at Draco’s arm, the one he knows is smeared with ink like an old bruise. The one Draco keeps covered up as much as possible though he isn’t embarrassed when Harry catches a flash.
“The what?” snaps Draco, all prickly again right when Harry had got him to go all sweet. “There’s a sucking spell and you’ve never told me before? What the shit, Percy?”
Eventually they hopped off the Métro and caught a bus to take them the remainder of the way up the steep hill. However, the bus could only take them so far, so the last ten minutes of the journey were spent climbing up steep stairs and alleyways after Malfoy as Harry did his best to disguise how unfit he’d become.
There’s no possible way a finger has managed to find its way into his arse through the layers of his pants, trousers, and the seat of the bloody chair he’s sitting in, but that is absolutely what it feels like and Harry is familiar enough to know what the slim, wiggling thing is. It pumps in and out of him a few times while he silently goes to pieces, and then disappears entirely.
And Draco wouldn’t allow himself to be used so carelessly, Harry thought. At least not by Harry. With Harry, he’d put up a token struggle, he’d tease and torment, and try and make Harry come before he was ready, then make fun of him for it. He might not even bottom for Harry, he might say something dirty in a superior tone like ‘Malfoy’s do not take it up the arse, Potter’ and make it sound like gospel.
He took them to the Louvre, and to Montmartre, and to Notre Dame, and to walk along the Seine. They walked across the lover’s bridge eating ice cream and Lily insisted that they have a lock. Harry purchased one from a street vendor and wrote out their four names carefully on one side. Lily added a heart. James and Albus rolled their eyes at one another, but helped Lily link the lock on the chain link fence and James took great joy in throwing the key into the Seine as hard as he could.
He hadn’t realized how much he had missed that eyebrow. “That’s ridiculous even for you, Potter.” Malfoy turned back to Harry’s counter. He was only making enough tea for one, so Harry grabbed the chipped mug for himself and nudged him over.
“Look, Frederick,” Harry says as calmly as he can. “You showed up at your boss’s dinner party with Harry Potter. That’s what you paid for, and that’s what you got. Your colleagues will be talking about that for weeks, and I know I greased the wheels with your boss to give you the Barcelona account.” He sighs as he realizes he’s not getting through to the punter. “Can’t you be happy with what you have?”
“Please, Harry,” he says. “I’ll take such good care of you.” And if that isn’t one of the hottest things he’s ever heard Draco say.
It only takes two spells for Harry to retrieve the cuffs and wrap them around each of Draco’s wrists. He doesn’t even have to stop thrusting in Draco’s mouth to do it. Draco wines, but swirls his tongue against the vein on the underside of Harry’s shaft and otherwise doesn’t miss a beat. Harry flicks his wand again and connects the cuffs with a short chain so Draco’s forced to keep his hands still in front of him.
“Of course we have a kitchen!” he grumbles, but he doesn’t mention ever having visited which is suspicious. Draco’s a big fan of the lie of omission when he doesn’t want to admit something.
Potter glances to the left suddenly, right where Draco’s cum has landed and he realizes that he’s projected past whatever barrier is in place. He shivers, hips jerking and body twitching in the aftermath of his second orgasm. Potter licks his lips.
To his credit, Malfoy didn’t laugh, but he did smirk and he did make Harry say it three more times before he was satisfied.
“Fat is it?” he quips then winces as his head hits the wall and Draco’s wand (not the one he is hoping to feel) pushes against the underside of his jaw.
“Bloody fuck, Potter,” breathes Draco. Now that he’s cum all he can feel are the aches and pains of the bondage and cards. He desperately wants another shower and it’s got to be past midnight, on a school night no less.
McGonagall always spells the test names out, never calls them the ‘owls’ and ‘newts’ like the rest of them do. Draco and Neville exchange a hidden glance and smile at that. It’s one of the things the staff teases about behind her back. How much shorter their staff meetings would be during exam time if McGonagall didn’t always take the time to spell out their acronyms. Thankfully, McGonagall doesn’t notice. She’s getting up there, but she still has eyes in the back of her head.
He sits himself down on the edge of Potter’s desk, right on top of his paperwork. Thankfully his robe is only open at the front so his bare arse isn’t in danger of being smeared in wet ink. It’s hard not to luxuriate in Potter’s laser-focused attention. The only thing the man can move are his eyes, and they’re drinking Draco in as he displays himself shamelessly. He sets his booted feet on the chair’s armrests and tilts back so Potter can see what he means by prepared.
Malfoy’s lips twitched. It was almost a smile. “Oh, quite a lot of things, Potter. But first, desert.” With an arrogant flick of the wrist Malfoy called over the waiter and ordered something in French that Harry was only sure had chocolate in the title. “Now, are you here on Ministry business?”
“Where is Potter?” Draco went around the table to find a chair far away from the ancient servant, who followed him regardless, wringing his gnarly hands and cackling between unintelligible mutters. It would be just Draco’s luck to be murdered by Kreacher after his narrow escape from yesterday’s kidnapping attempt.
“Smith has been arrested, but he’s not the only one who wants you dead. Not many of us are spending the holidays here, but I want you to be safe.”
Draco snickered and removed his own jacket and boots. He took a few steps towards the kitchen, filled the kettle and let the water boil (after remembering that the appliances were running on magic and worked differently than the ones he was used to). He found milk in the fridge and a brand-new pack of cocoa in the cupboard, so he set out to prepare a nice mug of hot chocolate for his now tired little boy. When it was ready, he lowered the temperature, using his wand for the first time in years and feeling like a First Year when he had to try three times.
Teddy’s disgusted groan could be heard nearby, and of course, Cassius bloody Warrington muttered something about blackmail material and Draco’s dignity.
She transferred the biscuits onto a plate, forming a messy tower, before glancing at him. “Harry James Potter, that was not subtle.” She rolled her eyes when he grinned. “He’s adorable, of course, but you knew that. Blaise is still a mother-hen.”
The familiarity of Hermione’s rant is quite nostalgic. How long has it been since Harry spent time with her without the urge to run for the hills? He takes a seat on the cream-coloured sofa and picks at the wool of the blanket, hearing the kettle boil on the other side of the thin wall. The flat is tiny; Hermione earned her Mastery in Arithmancy from the Magical Institute of Higher Education a few months ago and found a job in the Department of Mysteries soon after, but she has yet to earn enough money to afford a better place. She often talks about moving to Edinburgh, citing the need to live far from London but still benefit from a bustling city. That’s part of what drove her and Ron apart. Harry frowns; he lost track of that story. When Hermione comes back with two cups of flavoured oolong tea, Harry bites his tongue to avoid asking her about it. He’ll find out soon enough.
“Don’t tell anyone I’m there!” He opened the cupboard, but it was hopeless. Perhaps he could move everything out and cram himself inside—
Those small windows he always forgot to clean, the curtains that Harry didn’t want to get rid of, the pictures on the walls, the framed Potter Stinks badge and the painting of Hedwig…
. So he ran, judged by the disapproving stares of the portraits—those left untouched or already repaired.
Harry shook his head. Kreacher was one of a kind. He watched the empty wardrobe fill with elegant robes that should hopefully fit Draco, and he decided to check the pantry. No doubt Malfoy would appreciate a snack.
That sounded unsafe and stupid. The repressed Slytherin Harry liked to pretend wasn’t lurking in his mind was screaming at him. He had only listened to that part of himself during the summer when self-preservation was vital, and it had done its job in keeping him alive until now. Dealing with Malfoy didn’t appeal to him in the slightest, but neither was letting him bleed out in the exact spot Lockhart had stood before losing his memories. In all fairness, Malfoy wasn’t a threat any longer. He might never have been one. The Wizengamot had judged him for his part in the war, and if it weren’t for Harry, he’d be rotting in Azkaban. Harry didn’t think he deserved it. He also knew that Malfoy’s aggressivity this year was his way of protecting himself.
He walks to the cash register and stands behind an old man who is paying in Knuts. It takes a while and gives Harry the opportunity to assess the best way to rush back to the Leaky Cauldron. It’s just on the other side of the street, but the human wave increases the distance. It’s so much worse than when he arrived. Behind the counter, Cho puts on a polite smile which grows when the man leaves and Harry hands her his books with a small nod.
Malfoy shook his head wildly. Harry let go of his wariness and took Malfoy’s fists in his hands gently. The other boy didn’t flinch. Encouraged, he moved close enough to notice very light freckles on the bridge of Malfoy’s nose.
Harry had once tried to convince him that yes, Harry himself was capable of cleaning up after himself, and no, Kreacher didn’t need to wash sweaty, stained sheets. Harry had, in the first three years after the war, tried to catch up on a youth that had been stolen from him, and while he hadn’t always brought his partners home for the night, Kreacher’s workload increased quite a bit. But while the senile little bugger complained, he’d been adamant that it was his duty, and that “Master Harry” should not do the washing unless he wanted Kreacher to remove his eyeballs with a spoon. Whether Kreacher meant Harry’s eyeballs or his own, Harry never wanted to find out.
The common room is blessedly quiet. He’s the only Slytherin who came back for what McGonagall calls eighth year, which is just seventh year with the curriculum the Carrows tore to shreds. She didn’t want to add an entire year’s worth of students to existing classes. Some of them have part-time jobs or apprenticeships already. They need adjustments. It’s like Potter, Boot and the Weasel, who don’t attend school in the morning. They’re training to be Aurors, started right after the war. Draco heard that the Ministry let them into the program on the condition that they get their NEWTs as soon as possible.
He decides on another course of action. He lets go of his hand and wraps him in a gentle embrace. “Whatever you decide, I’ll be there. I’ll support you.”
Harry folded the parchment and put it back in the envelope, then smiled at Teddy. “It’s from your cousin.”
“So, does it go even further back? What do you know?” Draco asked, and Potter stilled, waiting for an answer.
From his seat, he could see the street when someone entered the bar and could only stare at the gaudy letters of McLaggen’s Pride on the other side of the alley. He arched an eyebrow, curious as it hadn’t been there three months ago. “McLaggen—Gryffindor? A year above us?”
Harry raises both hands in surrender, letting go of his tie. He steps back and sits on what would be Theo’s bed had the boy returned (Draco lives alone in the dorms, but the usual number of beds are there anyway). It’s where he’s apparently decided to sleep tonight. “You’re still weak.”
The sight of him sat on Draco's favourite, expensive furniture was enough to make him giddy. Harry gave him a soft smile. "I'm fine now, and tea would be great. Thanks."
Goyle, Dudley, or Gabriel also had the dubious idea to put mistletoe above the spot where everyone would stand to read the menu, as Harry and Draco quickly discovered.
Harry’s stomach churned, and he shivered at the phantom feeling of icy water running down his back. “They wouldn’t. You’re an Auror.”
Draco features heavily in Harry’s dreams, and it isn’t long before Harry has to wash his sheets in the morning like a bloody teenager. His sex drive has always been rather low and since the end of the war, he didn’t touch himself that often, being either tired or loathing his existence too much to care. If he masturbated, it was out of habit, a quick orgasm in the shower, or because it helped him fall asleep. Hermione would probably have a name for his lack of interest, but pigs will fly before he considers talking to anyone about it. Ron is somewhat aware of it, and Harry has no desire to elaborate.
Draco takes one look at his red face and laughs. “Sorry,” he says, looking anything but. “I didn’t think it mattered. You’ve never seemed to care about any of my toys.”
“Ah,” she was smiling a bit sadly. “Of course. Then perhaps you may give me a moment to purchase these? He loves the caramel ones, but they’re all out at the moment.
“And you? Married out of Hogwarts, only divorced one year? You’ve been alone a lot have you?” Harry winced at the tone. Malfoy hadn’t been so callous in months.  Malfoy was sitting up now, swinging his legs off the couch and pushing himself up with his hands. “Well?” he demanded.
Potter only slows long enough for Draco to drop his cock and then returns to his near brutal pace, balls slapping against Draco as he chases his orgasm. He only lasts a few thrusts more before he’s collapsing against Draco’s back.
Draco tenses slightly as Harry releases the spell, starting from his toes to his head, to give him time to adjust to the added weight. He probably shouldn’t stay upside down for long, but perhaps there’s a charm for next time that Percy knows so he can keep the position longer.
It was hard to imagine that the body beneath him was Draco's when everything about it was wrong. But then Sergio squeezed the muscles in his arse around his cock. The elusive orgasm that tore out of him was almost painful. It left him panting and near shaking with irritation and slumped over a body that was distinctly lacking in sharp angels.
The attention is fantastic, but Draco is in a hurry. He’s teased himself long enough and he has no real intention of making this last. And also, damn it, Potter does need to finish his proposal, even though he doesn’t know why he cares about that.
Harry watched the expressions play across Malfoy’s face with an interest akin to fascination. There was bliss, joy, ecstasy, and an almost sexual moan of delight. All of which were more revealing expressions than Harry had been witness to during all six years of school together.
Although it looks as if Draco is immune to the sudden wealth of skin on display, Harry knows better. He can feel the slight falter in Draco’s otherwise precise movements, and he’s sure there’s tenting in the front of Draco’s trousers. But the man remains almost clinical in his task, not even lingering when he moves behind Harry and massages down Harry’s back, ending at the very top of his arse.
Harry wondered if it should feel strange being around Malfoy again. Instead it felt perfectly normal for the other man to join in on his shopping trip.
“It didn’t take nearly so long the other night, did it?” continues Draco. “You had me strung up right quick.”
It’s still not exactly what Harry had had in mind, but he doesn’t know what to say. In some ways, Draco is so much more experienced than he is, but he doesn’t want to let on because he knows part of Draco’s attraction to him is the authority and control that goes with being Harry Potter.
Harry blinks, catches up, and grins. “Just thinking about how many times you’ve had to borrow Kreacher for that to be true.” It’s a cheap shot, betraying his best friend, but Hermoine’s furious, “Ronald Weasley,” buys him a moment of precious time.
“The Potters didn’t always marry Purebloods, but they did it often enough to still be highly respected by more traditional families. The name appears for the first time around the thirteenth century; your direct ancestor is Ignotus Peverell, whose daughter married the first Potter. Who was, coincidentally, a potter from Persia.” He bit his lip. “As in, pottery maker. When he was in Britain, he took a name that later became Potter.”
“Okay. So, I came back in time to help you, because I know how life is for you and you don’t deserve this. But because of the protection on the house, I couldn’t just take you away.”
“That’s their default setting.” Hermione grabs her drink and hands another to Parvati, and her ring glints under the magical lamps. Harry thinks her and Ron’s hectic, on-and-off love story and open relationship is much juicier than his own. Journalists should focus on that. But they’re scared of ending up in a jar, so they don’t.
He cancelled the concealment spell. Harry removed his invisibility cloak on the way to the bathroom, and as the water from the shower splashed inside the small cubicle on the other side of the wall, Draco fell onto the bed and inhaled Harry’s scent, nose buried into his pillow.
He’s allowed to leave the infirmary if he takes it easy; he’s told it was a very near thing, his death, and Harry has already written to his mother to tell her he’s awake. She can’t visit, she’s still on house arrest.
in front of him. No point in reading it. He still bought it every single day because it was proof of Harry’s idiocy. It helped him remember that the year was not 2010, but 1989, should he ever doubt it. He hadn’t brought his phone with him—not that it would work, anyway—but he was still itching to check it.
He doesn’t overcook the pasta, but it’s a very near thing. The evening is warm and humid, and Harry’s temples ache from the impending thunderstorm. As he fills the plates, a flicker of concern flashes in Draco’s eyes. “I’m fine,” he mumbles, and Draco raises an eyebrow. “Really. Just a headache.”
Arms hugging his right leg, Draco tilted his head and smiled. “You’re right. Birds are much smarter.” If this was supposed to distract Harry, it worked. No hint of fear lingered when his partner acted like a lovable prat.
Harry shuddered as his mind replaced what had been taken. He’d been so safe here. Why did his head have to open itself to an intruder again? What would it take to earn the right to a normal life? He welcomed the grounding heat of Draco’s hand on his knee, unsettled by the intensity of the feelings in that silver wisp.
“Why would I need Polyjuice when I can do this?” Teddy turns into a carbon-copy of Professor Trelawney and points at Draco with a shaky finger. “I see your future, oh my poor boy!” They switch back to themself as Draco snorts. Teddy doesn’t change their appearance much aside from their hair. They enjoy looking like their parents too much.
Harry shuddered, memories coming to the surface, guilt choking him—so much blood, and that hint of relief in Malfoy’s terrified gaze, like he’d
“Let’s not pretend damaging human property can ever affect a balance that exists since the dawn of time, shall we?” Croaker drawled, before nodding towards the door. “Please see yourself out, Unspeakable K.”
The Malfoys had celebrated Christmas because it was an excuse to spoil Draco, who got presents for Yule too. Any excuse to shower him with gifts sounded great in his parents’ mind. As an adult, he didn’t see the point of celebrating both. Not anymore. But for Teddy (and Potter, his traitorous brain added), he’d celebrate anything and even dress up if needed.
After some thinking, Draco found the perfect way to annoy Kreacher even more. “I propose a flamboyantly gay Christmas tree this year.”
“Shabby, too,” Susan added. “Not very clean. Cormac’s customers are either people Parvati threw out of here or people who hate Slytherins. They can’t go in, the magic at the door kicks them out.”
Potter shook his head and stared at a miniature golden bust that had chives instead of hair (it was Gilderoy Lockhart. A gift from Pansy). "I thought you'd be living in a Victorian penthouse. This looks too Muggle for you, but it suits you."
The bookshop is quiet at least. Whatever is going on outside left it alone, and Harry takes his time browsing. He knows what he came here for and finds it in seconds, but there’s a new Muggle fiction area and the colourful spines on those books catch Harry’s eye. It’s not that magical fiction is always bad, but publishers are reluctant to accept manuscripts from Muggleborns, or Half-Blood with Muggle names, and reading magical fiction which so much as mentions the Muggle world is similar to that romanticisation of colonialism. Harry can’t stand it. Apparently, the owners of the shop agree, and Muggle books are slowly taking over. Harry picks up
Standing by Draco’s side, Harry crossed his (not that muscular!) arms on his chest, and to Draco’s surprise, didn’t say a word. He didn’t yell at the woman or step between her and Draco to protect him. This wasn’t the righteous Golden Boy who’d irked Draco so much at school, the chivalrous defender lauded in the
A brief memory of being stuck to a wall until they both calmed down flashed through Harry’s mind, and he flushed in embarrassment. Malfoy took a few steps, let out a loud breath and sat beside him, fists clenched and hair ruffled.
Draco sniffs, and eats the last of Harry’s calamari. “We’re not sappy, we’re supporting each other in the face of your incessant blabbering.”
Draco snorted at the sight of his son’s feather crown. The giggling boy was playing in the grass with Fawkes, who kept placing loose feathers and twigs in his hair. Scratching behind Thor’s ears, he wondered why he couldn’t sit still.
The Yule tree (okay, fine, it had been a Yule tree for Yule, now it was a Christmas tree) was not flamboyantly gay with rainbow paint, which would be a shame if Harry hadn’t been so fascinated by its flickering lights. He was trying to appear collected like any adult would, but Draco knew that look. Draco had seen the wonder on his face each year when Hogwarts was decorated for Christmas, and it had been something he would’ve expected from a small child, not from a teenager.
“Can you date it?” That would at least help them figure out which language it could be, but Malfoy’s dating spell failed. Harry sighed; the signs reminded him of Roman numbers but were still clearly different, and he wouldn’t be able to sleep without an answer. So, he grabbed the portrait and woke up his occupant.
Sometimes, they still wake up screaming, startle at sudden noises or the sight of certain spells. No magic on earth can heal their minds with a quick flick of a wand, but they have each other’s support when things get dark.
“Five points to Slytherin.” His hand rested on the small of Draco’s back, firm and strong. “We decorated it together, so excuse me for loving it.”
So, he got to work, wanting everything to be perfect for his first real meal with the one he owed everything to.
Malfoy mumbled something that might have been “fuck off” before sitting up, shaking. The hatred on his face lasted until he looked around, assisted by a
He reached blindly for his wand. Picturing the first time he’d held baby Edward Lupin, he cast his Patronus (a fox. Mother had taught him). “Tell Wood I’m sick.” He then proceeded to cough his lungs out.
Draco’s memories of what happened are blurry. He can’t feel his body, aside from an odd tingling sensation in his hands, but when he slips out of his half-dreamy, half-conscious state and realises he’s still alive, he gasps. That’s when he hears it. Potter’s voice. Calling his name, calling him
Draco didn’t care. She could scream for help all she wanted. “What the fuck is wrong with you?” he snarled. She looked at him with the disdain he’d grown so used to over the years.
