“So, you don’t think the point is just to embarrass the Chief Warlock? Revenge or something, something political?”
“Nev said
Harry rubbed one hand over the back of his neck, cheeks flaming. “Ah, right. I don’t really know much about sex toys. Not really my thing, I suppose.”
Draco could imagine a great many things Potter may be good for, unfortunately, and many of them crossed his mind as he watched Potter kneel on the stone floor of the Ward Room, a map of England unfolding in front of him, and a small glowing globule of magic hovering just above it.
Ron poked his head around Harry’s door at half five. “Pint?”
“Seven diamonds,” Harry said, peevishly, and messily poured himself another drink. “You were gone for ages.”
“So, should I be suspicious?”
“Harden up, Bujalski.” Ron was remorseless. “Last, and by no means least, if I can get Anders' pants off, maybe I can remove the stick up his arse while I’m at it!”
“Don’t you think it strange,” Malfoy said calmly, “that she married Scamander, even though surely she knew she preferred women? Maybe she did it just so he could get her up the duff. She certainly left him quickly enough once she’d had them. Or maybe she wanted to cash in on the family name for professional reasons-”
he would. Because Harry had always been lucky like that.
“And decorations,” Malfoy said, pleased. Harry nodded. And decorations.
Potter kissed him.
Pansy’s eyes glittered, and she licked the rim of her glass in a way that had Harry looking anywhere else. Ginny smirked and pushed a heavy fall of long hair over her shoulder. “Harry, babe, you look smashing. Been at the gym?” Draco materialised as if Summoned. “Malfoy.”
Draco made a pained sound, and pinched the bridge of his nose. Potter crouched down beside the girl, who was looking decidedly wobbly. “What were you trying to do with the little owls?”
A queue snaked its way down the street, kept in formation by a velvet rope strung between regularly spaced brass bollards. Harry wondered how these Muggles could stand to line up in the cold like that, especially the girls, who seemed rather under-dressed for standing outdoors on a cool mid-September evening. Harry was glad of his leather jacket, as a puff of cold wind ruffled the sweaty hair at the nape of his neck.
"…I'll get you something. Accio-"
“You alright?”
Devlin shifted his cargo from one arm to the other, and fished a file from within the folds of his robes, its cover an instantly recognisable Auror red. Harry took it from him and flipped to the first page case summary. “Apparently there’s evidence suggesting this-” Harry gestured towards a disturbingly wobbling knob. “Devlin, you’d better put those down. So, the Auror investigation has uncovered evidence that this was the result of a cursed Muggle object.” Harry lifted a trio of large crime scene photographs from the file and showed them to Devlin, arms now free of his burden. A dirt-caked dildo was pictured at the bottom of a shallow hole in what was presumably Throttlebottom’s garden; the next was a somewhat blurry shot of an Auror lifting the thing out of the hole, the lack of focus probably a result of the photographer shaking with laughter. Harry recognised the symptoms; nearly all of Ron’s stag night pictures had ended up in the same condition, as Neville had been designated the official photographer, and proved to be an exceptionally giggly drunk.
, too.
Well. Perhaps not quite in the face. More like an inch above the papery forehead of what seemed to be an elf.
“Fornicating?” Ginny said bluntly, to Draco’s half-asked question. “Like rabbits.”
“Indeed. I realise it’s a bit early, but I was wondering if you might let my friend and I pop upstairs for a drink before the doors open.”
“I’d never,” Draco’s fingers dug in, and as Harry came he could only hold on, and murmur, “Draco, Draco, Draco,” until Draco tumbled over, too.
“You’re not making me a cause, Potter.”
“Hey, big fella,” Harry murmured it through a kiss pressed to his hair. “You’re alright. You’ve had a bit of a fright today, haven’t you?”
Harry crossed the garden to the woodpile, where Malfoy had been stacking log after retrieved log.
With great amusement, Draco watched Potter’s eyes pop open, and the tea bag was hastily removed.
Draco was just starting to regret the macchiato when the pictures came in. There was Draco stretching in the car park. There was a picture of him coming out of the sea - glowing blue water coursing down his bare chest, his nipples dark and hard, his jeans barely hanging on by the swell of his arse and little else. “Holy shit,” Theo said, his eyes wide. “That’s borderline pornographic, Draco.”
“What did Parkinson have?”
That got Malfoy to turn his head slightly, enough to level a glare at Harry, but he still wouldn’t face him. Malfoy’s skin was blotchy. Harry clenched his fist and felt the fabric tighten around his hand, and he crossed the room to stand in Malfoy’s personal space. Within punching distance.
The report made
It was almost funny, so Draco barked a short laugh, and turned to look briefly into Potter's earnest eyes.
“Oh, good for him,” Draco said, his fingertips going white where they were digging into the wood. “He doesn’t look a day over eighteen. You should have let him at least try. He seemed so enthusiastic.”
“You will.” They all said, in perfect unison.
Potter grinned at him. “Oh, you like me alright. Don’t try to pretend you haven’t been fighting this since the day I joined the team. You’re very good at it, except for the blushing – which I’m all for, don’t get me wrong.”
Hermione gave Ron a speaking look, and Ron gave one back. It was above and beyond their usual silent
“Oh,” Harry said, and shuffled further over in his bed. “Well, I can help you with that.”
“Here comes your boy,” Pansy said with a wry smile. Draco deliberately didn’t look over.
He was definitely getting hard again. “You
“Good work, Potter.” If he’d had any breath himself, Harry might’ve complained, but that would be a much bigger exaggeration, and nobody would believe him, anyway, were there anyone other than the two of them here to witness it, because it was a fact widely known that there were few things Harry Potter enjoyed more than a nude and sweaty Draco Malfoy lying on top of him.
Malfoy stretched, and Harry tried very hard not to look, with middling success. “You know, Potter, it’ll fall off if you’re not careful.”
Potter let the legs of the chair down loudly. “Can’t say. Classified.”
Draco Malfoy woke on the first morning of his holidays in a cold rage.
tellings off.” Harry stared at him, until Malfoy began to look self conscious and brushed at his face. “What?”
Harry nodded. It was quite surreal, sitting here with Malfoy, who he hadn’t spoken to in – well,  probably years, with a room filled with sex toys just behind them, calmly talking about rubber cocks. “Thanks, that’s really helpful. I guess I’ll go and visit the other lot at,” Harry looked over at the scrap of paper again. “
There was a shriek, a crash, then a collective gasp, and finally, a noisy splash, and Draco knew what he would see before he even turned around. A server had been knocked flat on her rear, and was surrounded by miniature dill pancakes topped with salmon. There were strands of garnish in her hair. Undersecretary Scrivener, presumably having collided with her some seconds earlier, had subsequently tumbled arse over tit into the Mermish Ambassador’s tank, and there resided, looking perplexed and more than a little drunk, while the Ambassador squawked in indignation.
“Nothing,” Draco shrugged. “Sometimes things just end.”
“Thought you were doing roast lamb,” Harry said, following Ron down the hall of the flat to the kitchen.
no. Forever no, forever and ever and ever, amen. Unless in the future it
“That was disgusting,” Ron said thickly.
Ron took the trick with an even bigger trump. “You didn’t answer my question.”
“Well, try to do it while walking, Potter, if you think you can manage both things at once. I’m busy.”
"Is the meal okay? I can send it back, if it's no good."
“Hey. Pretty boy.” A man stepped abruptly into Harry’s personal space. “You look like you want your dick sucked.”
There wasn’t much more to do, other than to pass Malfoy some gloves, and try to stop sweating by sheer force of will.  “Right. So - erm. We just…”
Harry blinked. “So, doesn’t that mean…”
“Ah…”
“Well,” Draco said, as if picking up a conversation they’d been having for hours, but which had probably mostly been going on silently in his own head. “We need a room for Mother, since she’ll be coming in from Mayenne a few days before.” Draco was stretched to his full extent on the settee, his head in Harry’s lap, and his feet up on the velvet curve of the arm. It was almost getting warm enough to forgo a fire, but there was just enough chill in the March evenings that they could still enjoy its cozy warmth. The glow from the hearth, and yesterday’s cricket replay on the television flickered in the otherwise pleasantly dark sitting room, the only other light a buttery yellow lamp behind them that gave Draco just enough illumination to see his infamous pad with.
The rest of the day passed in a blur of parchment and regulations. Draco was almost surprised to see the clock read five o’clock when he finally looked up from his desk, and stretched, his muscles cramped and protesting, and almost every joint cracked noisily. There was a rap at the door, and Draco picked up his wand and opened it, revealing a traumatised-looking Potter on the other side. Every strand of hair on his head was standing on end, and the collar of his robes had become twisted drastically to the right.
Draco gave him a look. “It troubles me that you’re comparing hunting for Horcruxes favourably against cleaning the house for our engagement party.”
Summer means more people out and about, so there are more accidents, altercations, and the heatwave makes people quick to anger. Drunk, disorderly, publicly nude, urinating in locations they definitely shouldn’t be urinating - memorably, they booked a pair of stallholders selling charmed sunglasses and hats to unsuspecting Muggles at Bournemouth beach. Charmed, not cursed, but they were making a killing out of unassuming straw hats and plastic sunnies, imbued with cooling and shading spells. They’d needed nearly the whole division out on the sand to track down all those happy customers.
Now, with the former Quidditch Room restored to a pleasant twin, sans bedding, there were two more rooms to tackle, and both of them gave Harry stomach cramps.
“And what do you think about that?”
“You’d like that, wouldn’t you? Mad bastard. You’re the only person I know who gets off on being insulted.” Malfoy grinned at him, and Harry knocked their glasses together.”Happy birthday, git. You should have told me.” Harry should have bloody known.
A wisp of white puffed in the cold morning air as he exhaled.
“I think this week you should come out to a club with me, instead.” Malfoy settled back in his chair, and waited. Harry’s throat felt dry, and he took a huge mouthful of tea.
There were cufflinks from Hermes, a long coat from Balenciaga, two more from Burberry (a lovely mustard leather trench, and a black military style which reminded Harry a little bit of Draco’s old Auror uniform). A black suit from Dior, and a velvet one from Ferragamo...a dark, tarnished gold puffer jacket from Ferragamo too, Harry seemed to recall he’d bought quite a great deal, even by his standards, from that particular collection.
Monday morning saw Harry up to his ears in paperwork. There were enough referrals on his desk to build a small house, and the results of a number of recent Trackers needed a final review before they were escalated to the arrest stage. Harry’s head was bent over one such report when he realised there was someone standing in his doorway, silently boring holes into the top of his head with their eyes.
Potter was silent for a moment, his eyes soft. He reached out and clasped his warm hand on Draco’s knee. It felt hot through his thin trousers. “You’re right.” His thumb rubbed a gentle circle. “I tried to tell you yesterday.”
Harry shook his head. “Mungo’s told me not to when I was being discharged, and I got the distinct impression things could get pretty messy if I didn’t comply.”
done it, and called him friend…Draco stepped forward too, clumsily, and pressed his mouth against Potter's. He closed his eyes and kissed, very softly, his heart pounding and his mind whirling, trying to make sense of what he was doing here.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Hardly, Ron. We were best friends.”
“What are you planning to do to me?”
"No!" Harry shouted, dying of humiliation. "God, of course not, Malfoy. Merlin's
It was Pansy’s hand on his shoulder now, urging him on. If he didn’t go now, well. Draco pushed his fingers through his hair, hooked his jacket from the back of the stool, and followed her out, managing not to look back at that corner of the pub again.
Oops.
He broke the kiss, or tried to — his mouth seemed glued to Potter’s neck, and his hands were already halfway up the back of his robe. “What are you doing for the next two weeks, Potter?”
— to be roused from it. The dream was already vanishing, and Draco could hardly recall which of the Beaters precisely had been worshipping his calves, nor the exact shade of the tight, brown nipples of the Keeper whose thumbs had pressed firmly into the arch of his left foot. He’d never get back to it, now, not even if his mobile stopped ringing immediately and he went directly back to sleep.
"You kissed me," Draco murmured, slightly accusingly.
Harry smiled and put another delicate chocolate leaf into his mouth.
“Just looking tonight, Potter. Remember? Have fun tomorrow, and call me if you have any questions.”
“Harry Potter,” Malfoy said, pushing off the wall and crushing the cigarette under a heel in one graceful movement. He looked Harry up and down, a smile barely quirking his lips. “Look at you.” His eyes dropped back down, trailed down Harry’s body for a second look with an almost palpable intensity.
He thought about how Malfoy had looked tonight. The way his perfectly tailored trousers had been cut around his hips and thighs, and arse. Harry was the last person to care about clothes, to know anything about them, but he knew Malfoy looked incredible in his tonight. His hair glowing fuschia in the neon light in the street.
, that was Draco oh so close…
If Weasley was going, then there was no way Potter wouldn’t be there too.
“Don’t you think he would have given me any sort of clue, if that were the case? It’s been six months, Granger. He’s never made any sort of gesture in front of our friends to show we’re anything more than friendly work colleagues. He’s never asked me to stay the night. We see each other at work, or the Mallard, or for as long as it takes for us to get off at his place. Look, it’s my fault for getting carried away with it.” Draco shook his head. “I knew when I went home with him the first time that I’d made a mistake, but I did it anyway. I’m not a good person, I know that, but I’m trying to do good things. Make better decisions.” He looked away. The bar was a watery blur around him. “I’ll come to the tournament, I’ll come to everything for Teddy, I promise you that. But I need to be nothing to Potter, because I can’t handle being nothing much.”
Potter stepped away.
a favour?”
“Fuck!” Weasley spluttered and pushed his mug onto the nearest flat surface, hot tea seeping into the front of his robe. Draco pulled the letter from the morning from his coat pocket and chucked it at Weasley’s head.
“I don’t want
icing, make sure it’s not coffee flavoured, and absolutely no powdered sugar. A reminder to all of you, keep your ‘umms’ and ‘errs’ to a minimum, eliminate them if you can, and please try to avoid using hard ‘k’ sounds, or the word ‘evidently’.” Draco eyed Wedderburn. “Perhaps you shouldn’t speak at all, Wedderburn. It’s your first time.”
“Do you want another cup?” Potter’s fingers moved, and the cemetery of deceased beverages winked away, Banished somewhere. That was another of Potter’s irresponsible habits. Just wandlessly doing things, constantly, right in front of Draco like it was nothing special. As if it didn’t make Draco want to immediately get horizontal. The impudence.
Mmm, Malfoy’s thumb was stroking his hip like he’d done earlier, and it felt ridiculously good. “I guess it's about being inexperienced. People judging me. People wanting to be with me for the wrong reasons.”
They’d decided on the same service for the catering, even though Molly had insisted, but Harry had been just as insistent that he wanted her to enjoy every second of the party, and that if she loved him, she would comply. She’d narrowed her eyes and called him a wicked boy, and Draco had laughed so hard he had to leave the room, but she’d given in, and now she was swaying around the sitting room in Arthur’s arms, red-cheeked and giggling that she couldn’t feel her feet. The champagne was clearly very good.
“You know, they say that grooming another person is a sign of intimacy and possession.”
“Red curry chicken and coconut rice, with a double serve of curry puffs because I know they’re your favourite.”
Harry tried not to laugh. “You’re not even paying attention to me. I kind of expected more from you, Parkinson.”
He wanted French flax linen hotel sheets, and the prickle of a slight sunburn that would darken his skin just enough to cause his hair and eyes to glow like a Veela. He wanted fresh oysters, and moussaka, and crisp but expensive casual shirts unbuttoned at the throat and rolled up at the elbows. He wanted olives, and cold white wine, and the salt smell of the Myrtoan sea. He had at least three paperbacks to get through and some new Muggle thing Pansy had got him called an iPod, that was filled with music she called ‘chillout electronica’. He wanted horseback riding in the hills. He wanted fresh goat cheese on warm flat bread. He wanted dolmades and hot, fresh tyropita. He wanted a sunbed on Vrelos Beach. He wanted honey-soaked baklava on the terrace of his hotel after a sweaty night of fucking. He really, really wanted the sex.
“You’ve got to start Silencing the bathroom when you take your morning piss, mate.”
Fuck’s
Draco snorted into his glass. “I told you, you’re only a genius if this works. Your other option is ‘idiot’.”
“No,” Draco moved toward the fireplace. “I’m not here for niceties. You have something to say, get on with it.” He wanted to be in Floo range. He didn’t have to come here. He didn’t need to listen to any of Potter’s bullshit. He’d leave if Potter pushed him too far, he would just fucking leave.
“And on your holidays, yes,” Potter said, his breath tickling the hair at the base of Draco’s neck. “You mentioned.” Potter’s fingers flexed round his wrists again. “Right, I’m about to start. Just try to stay relaxed just like this, and we should be done in no time.”
At that last thought, Harry sat up suddenly, remembering Malfoy had given him something as they parted in the little laneway. A small box - he moved quickly to the washing hamper, where his jeans remained, ready to be laundered when he eventually ran out of clean socks. A quick rummage in the pockets and his fingers found the sharp edges of a rectangular object. Curiously, Harry pulled it out and turned it over in his hands. Inspiration, Malfoy had said. Spend the day in bed, but unshrink this first.
Well, now he was definitely keeping the crisps for himself. “Don’t let Hermione hear you talking like that. You’ll get another lecture on discriminating against the differently abled.”
The pad and pen from the kitchen slapped into Draco’s palm a moment later. “Starting a new list.” Harry grinned. Of course he was. “Now, obviously this affects a lot of the rooms, correct?”
Malfoy snorted slightly into his cup. “Throttlebottom’s a pustulant little boil, isn’t he.” Malfoy paused. “Kingsley Shacklebolt shouted at me, once. I didn’t have a solid bowel movement for at least a week after.”
“I don’t care,” Draco pushed back into Potter’s groin, and they both made embarrassing noises as Potter’s cock, already sticky at the tip and hard as a rock, slid against Draco’s arse. Potter pressed himself against Draco’s body completely, his lips mouthing at Draco’s neck and nipping at his shoulder through the fabric of his shirt. Potter’s hands spread over Draco’s hips, slid up and under the hem of his shirt to stroke his stomach, feather light fingertips that teased past the jut of Draco’s erection, hot and leaking where it pressed against his shirt. Draco’s fingers tightened on the edge of the bench. “Touch me,” Draco’s voice was pleading, but he didn’t care. “Come on.”
“Yes, you can check my calendar. It clearly says ‘Brandy Alexander’ at 4.30pm.” Potter snorted his laughter into his tea, and Draco maintained an expression of determined innocence. “Very difficult to re-schedule, that one. Quite a shame.”
“Is it normal to be turned on by yourself?” Draco asked, faintly.
Potter shrugged again, let his lips lift almost into a smile. “Tea?”
Potter had not spotted Draco yet; he was busily tipping his head back, presumably savouring the final drops of what was most certainly tea from his upturned paper cup. Draco considered ducking into the nearest office, cupboard, or quite frankly behind a potted plant, and hiding. But that was absurd. Really, what was the worst that could happen? Potter could apologise for being drunk and flirty, and they would both laugh it off and forget about it. Well, Draco wouldn’t really forget about it, but at least the wild fantasy that there might be something there between them could be put to bed. So to speak. He would do his best to be casual, and dismissive, as if it was not a big deal at all, and things like that happened to Draco all the time. He could totally maintain his dignity.
“Was he bad in the sack, Malfoy?” Ginny helped herself to more of his wine gums before he could snatch them out of her reach. “He was pretty alright when we were a thing. If we hadn’t been so much alike, we might not have split up, but over time it was like dating myself, just with less-”
“He’s in love with you,” Blaise said flatly.
“Of course, darling,” Draco said sarcastically. “Red Beard- I mean, Ginny, will of course bring her not-girlfriend.”
“Why do you look like you’ve been dug up? What’s happened?”
“About whether they’ve used a - a plug before, things like that.”
Draco spoke abruptly, ten minutes in.
But it was impossible not to think of him. This was all Malfoy’s doing, and Malfoy was so fucking gorgeous. He thought Harry was gorgeous. Harry actually felt a bit gorgeous, for the first time in his life. If Malfoy was here, Harry would bet he would be telling him what to do. Harry would like to give him a show, not that he was sure he knew how. Harry looked at his face in the mirror, let his eyes wander down his torso to his cock. He shifted his feet, widened his thighs - yes, that looked good, the light a mellow gold behind him. His cock was wet and slipped between the tight circle of his fist. He tipped his head back, watched the tendons flex in the warm light. He felt so hard in his own hand, his hand felt so good on his prick. He bit his lip, and that felt good too, he looked good doing it. Sultry.
“CHIPS!” Ginny bellowed, letting herself in the front door. “Hot chips, coming through!” Hermione moved around the kitchen getting plates and cutlery, and Ginny stomped in, bringing the salty smell of fried potato, and an unmistakable hint of honeysuckle. It made Harry think of Malfoy again, flushed and surprised under the light of a pub lamp, freshly hugged.
As expected, the interviews took very little time to complete. There wasn’t much to tell, though Potter asked all manner of questions of the Gamma shift Keepers, like whether they noticed any unusual odors, did they feel this or that sensation in their magic at any point, and was there a taste of fennel or toadflax? They climbed the ladders to the topmost rafters and took samples of the residual spell residue, which seemed on the surface to be the basic, expected owl magic that anyone would find in a large Owlery, as well as the standard enchantments for owl-keeping.
The third picture was a close-up of the base of the toy. Most of the dirt had been brushed away, and a row of raised numbers was visible, probably some sort of model code, or serial number, along with a distinct stamp declaring ‘MADE IN CHINA’. Harry sighed. Definitely Muggle. And almost certainly tampered with by magic, if the potato-like roots creeping from the underside were any indication. “Mr Weasley said it was rather urgent, sir.”
Although. Technically, Potter had the upper hand in this situation; he had been much more inebriated than Draco, and could therefore excuse his overly friendly behaviour quite easily. Draco had hardly been pissed at all, and had still gone along with it, so this was rather more embarrassing for him. Actually, the more Draco thought about it, the less absurd hiding from Potter seemed, after all.
Potter raised an eyebrow. “You know, you could at least pretend to be polite to me, Malfoy. Isn’t that what people in offices do?”
“Um,” Harry served himself some, distractedly. “Fried bacon lardons, scallions, a bit of diced red pepper, coriander, and the dressings just a whole jar of good mayo mixed up with some curry powder and dijon mustard.”
Draco just couldn't do breakfast properly without Harry. For one thing, he couldn't cook. It was part simple ineptitude on his behalf, and part determination to make sure Harry had to continue looking after him in this way, because he couldn't do it for himself. Hermione had scoffed once that it was utter laziness, and Draco behaving like a spoiled brat. She'd told Harry it was absolutely the most ridiculous excuse she had ever heard for avoidance of a chore, and that Harry had been royally sucked in for believing it. But Harry knew better, because he knew that breakfast was
That shed no further light on why in Salazar’s name the elf was here. Why not an owl, or a Patronus? Why was
Harry grinned. He really had. “Lettuce and walnut salad,
There were millions of men in London. Draco’d checked the census records once, when he was extra bored at work. There would have to be one hundred thousand of them, surely, that looked somewhat like Potter (statistically - he’d done the sums on another slow afternoon). And
Draco scrawled little pictures in the margins as he went on. There were several bats, an improbably woolly sheep, and what looked a lot like a cherry bakewell tart.
“Not this time, pet. In those jeans, that t-shirt, your hair looks - looks like…”
“I must admit, I’d have never thought I’d see the day you’d be slumming it in joggers, Malfoy.”
are traditional. He said it like that means something.”
The meeting room emptied quickly, and Draco studiously did not turn to look at Potter, who was obviously loitering at the door, until it was just the two of them and to acknowledge him was unavoidable.
Ginny had the serviette pressed to her mouth again, her eyes nearly watering with glee. “Oh - my -
. Free.
“He said the joyous misery of requited love,” Hermione translated, as Harry’s mouth was largely muffled by a pillow. Hermione had got pretty good at interpreting his sulky mumbles. They had spent quite a bit of time being miserable together in tents, after all.
“Why not, Harry?” Hermione’s hand was cool when she touched his wrist. She was using a bloody charm!
Potter made a sound like he was swallowing a laugh. “I’m not the one in head to toe cashmere.”
Malfoy, not anymore, if he ever really had. He’d known certain parts of Malfoy when they were at school, and Malfoy had known certain parts of him too.  But Harry wasn’t normally one to feel such attraction to someone that he didn’t otherwise have a strong connection with.
“And Auntie will want to stay as well, so they can spend as much time as possible together. Plus, you know what they’re both like. Two glasses of champagne, and they’ll be collapsed on the nearest upholstered surface together, weeping about how much they love each other.” Draco snorted, as if he wasn’t as much of a lightweight as they were. “We can probably put them in a twin room and save a little space. And Tedward, of course, he’ll need his usual.”
Draco dropped his wand and rubbed his face. “Not — I mean, why are you here, in my house? I don’t know anyone with an elf anymore.”
“You make it sound so easy, to just be brave.” Draco swallowed hard. “But I’m a coward.”
Harry nodded. “Now onto...”
Harry nodded again. He’d expected this. “If I’m ever going to exploit my celebrity, it might as well be for this.”
Harry only nodded, face hot, and the other man moved away.
Draco turned and gave his most reassuring smile to the witch in the bubble. “We’re on the case, not to worry.” The lift lurched off. Draco’s smile slid into a glare.
Harry stared at his back. Malfoy’s shoulders were rigid with tension. “Malfoy - wait on.”
Malfoy put the pot down carefully, and took a step towards him. “Harry…”
“Of who, me, or Malfoy?”
“Nothing,” Harry echoed. There was a bowl of Twiglets on the table to share, but Harry hated Twiglets, and thought moodily about apple cider flavoured crisps, and posh smiles. “The usual. Robards is riding him and it's not fair.”
Or, he was serious.
“Then take it,” Potter said, and fell back from Draco’s lap against the bed.
“Are you fucking Potter again?”
“Your magic is clearly back. You always enjoy cooking a little better when you don’t have to clean up by hand. I’ll bet you didn’t make yourself anything nicer than beans on toast, and...” Draco squinted, and sniffed. “Sausages.”
, you thieving shit, instead of…” Harry shrugged, no idea what Malfoy would usually have done on his birthday. “I dunno, partying somewhere more trendy than this place.”
“Should I expect this rude treatment for long?”
“So, I promise I’ll resign if things go badly.”
“It’s like a hose, Potter.”
“I could remind you,” Potter said, and his voice licked up Draco’s spine like a flame. “You seem like you have time right now.”
Again.
Malfoy sipped his tea, and crossed his legs at the knee. “Would you care to talk about it?” Harry gave him a look before dropping his head again. Malfoy rolled his eyes. “I think you’ll find I’m quite a good listener, Potter. And I’ve heard quite a lot of peculiar shit in my time.”
“It’s bespoke. I made it, the charm and the glass,” Malfoy said, still watching his customers. Harry stared at him, until Malfoy noticed, and turned his attention back to Harry. “You seem surprised. Always underestimating my talents, Potter, which I should warn you are considerable, and,” Malfoy’s eyes dropped briefly to Harry’s mouth, and Harry felt the hair on the back of his neck stand on end. “And quite diverse. It’s basically a modified Foe Glass, but instead of showing me my enemies, it shows me my customers. Quite a tricky bit of magic, that; I had to dismantle one to work it out, and they’re very expensive. I went through five before I had it worked out. The spellwork on how to create them isn’t especially easy to lay one's hands on, either. But I do like a challenge.”
Malfoy paused for a moment, as if considering whether to deny knowledge of said Silenced pissing, and then shrugged, and came and sat directly on Harry’s lap. His arse and thighs were warm, and Harry was not to be blamed when things started to firm up beneath them.
Malfoy hadn’t stopped looking at him with that half smirk. “Never tried one, or did and didn't like it?”
Harry ran his left hand down, from his chest, across his belly, feeling one kind of tension leave his body in favour of another. His muscles twitched, the soft scratch of hair below his navel under slick fingers which moved across his hip and behind himself, over the wet flesh of his arse to skim between and stroke across the furled skin deeper within. He’d barely worked a fingertip inside himself when he came, grunting with the force of it, grunting Malfoy’s name as he spattered hard against the shower tile, before warm water rinsed the mess away again.
Draco grinned. “Why not?”
“What was he doing visiting you at work?” Ginny said, breathlessly. Harry stared at his food, shoved another mouthful in, and when he couldn’t stall any longer, cleared his throat.
“Yes sir.”
Potter leaned forward in his chair. “I think I worked pretty hard myself, Malfoy – being an Auror isn’t exactly a walk in the park.”
“Seriously, it’s better that we don’t go in there. We’ve done so much already,” Harry gestured at all the boxes. “Let’s leave this last bit for now. I’ll work on it through the week!”
Theo groaned loudly. Blaise shook his head. “I fucking knew this would happen. Well done, Icarus, you’ve finally flown too close to the sun.”
“You pulled me from the fiendfyre,” Draco said, his voice thick. “I’ve felt like I was burning ever since.” Potter crushed their lips together, sliding his hand up into Draco’s hair, his fingers rough-tipped and strong, and Draco pushed hard against him. His mouth was perfect, plush lips, warm and wet, his tongue in Draco’s mouth. Potter was a hot and welcome weight on his thighs, Draco pushed his hands up the back of Potter’s shirt and pressed his fingertips into the dimples at the bottom of his spine.
"Draco. Are you alright?"
“Malfoy!” Harry huffed out an embarrassed laugh. “I think the mead has gone to your head.”
Nor did it make any sense that Potter might be acting like this just to stitch Draco up. For a start, he would know that this would immediately destroy any sort of cooperative working relationship they had formed over the last six months. Draco found himself staring deeply into the frozen eye of the sculpted ice dolphin at the buffet. Potter might not be ambitious but he liked his job, and had always wanted to do well at it. But more than that, Draco was fairly certain that Potter wouldn’t do something so needlessly cruel, not after all he had been through himself when the gossip rags had caught hold of the story behind his and Ginny Weasley’s break up so many years earlier.
Potter looked down at the files in his arms, then up at the cloud of memos. “I feel like I’ve walked into some sort of elaborate trap.”
“He needs to get over it. I have.”
Malfoy hummed. “Denounce? Condemn?” His eyes lit up. “Roast!”
Harry smiled against his mouth. Breakfast was his favorite part of the day, and it was nine-tenths because he shared it with Draco.
They were going to have to improvise. Harry's eyes scanned the table, and lit upon the butterdish. His fingers scrambled over the tablecloth, reached the edge of the ceramic dish and pulled it closer. He knocked off the lid, looked at it once, and knew they'd have to throw the rest of the butter out once they were done. And then he plunged his fingers in, and coated them greasily in the thick yellow spread.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “But you didn’t accept.” It wasn’t a question. Harry shook his head, once.
Harry turned to face Malfoy fully with a small sigh. Malfoy seemed not to register surprise at all to see Harry, as if he’d always known he’d eventually show up.
“You were
“Shush,” Theo held up one hand, and took a long sip of his own coffee. “Zabini, in this family we give if we expect to receive, and Malfoy, stop avoiding the subject. You want help, you explain what’s going on, otherwise I’m going back to bed.”
He thumbed to the next file, which was in fact a video which picked up immediately from the previous photograph. It was in slow motion: the glowing, blue magic of the waves fizzing around his knees, the jeans pulling down so low at the front that you could actually see pubic hair...luminous drips running along the cuts of muscle, along the shallow threads of his scars. Draco watched himself push back the wet tangle of his hair, softly biting his bottom lip as he made his slow way over the sand. He turned and looked back at the water, then a wide, brilliant smile straight to the camera, and a flick of the wrist in a gesture of friendly insult.
Harry’s briefing with Ron, Shacklebolt and Throttlebottom had been difficult to say the least – it was now Thursday, almost a full week since the cocks first appeared, and Harry was no closer to a solution. Following his visit to Malfoy’s shop on Wednesday mid-morning, Harry had sent away the details of the postbox to see who it was registered to. He wasn’t expecting an answer until at least Friday, and in the meantime wasted the rest of the afternoon searching through Ministry census records to see if there was any mention of a Fanny Ballhatchet in Cockfosters, or anywhere else in Wizarding Britain in the last hundred years. As expected, there was none.
Harry wrinkled his brow. “Well. I guess I hope he shits himself to death about it, then?”
Oh good grief, Harry was sweating. “Erm.” Malfoy looked away for a moment and thrust his hand into the brown paper carry bag, and the very next moment, slapped an enormous blue-green dildo onto the bench in front of Harry.
Potter grinned. “What do you think I’m good for, Malfoy?”
"I'm just gonna…erm."
nudes. “It’s a bit pathetic, isn’t it.”
Draco stared at him again. “Yes, Potter, and I like a clean office, but you don’t see me pushing house elves over to get to a mop and broom, do you.”
“Yes, well. Your farts are pretty vulgar. They’re not a body part, fortunately, so talking about them a bit less than usual is perfectly acceptable.”
“Vol-au-vent,” Draco said distractedly, fishing in his pocket for a handkerchief.
Draco was grateful for the wall. Potter was running his fingertips gently over his clavicle, and it was doing things to his knees. “You like me.”
Two hours later found Harry nudging open the glass doors of Blaise Zabini’s offices with his hip, two take away coffee cups in a caddy in one hand, and several shopping bags in the unmistakable purple of Liberty of London in the other.
Potter just looked at him with dark eyes. “Come home with me.”
“Get fucked, Potter.” Draco said over his shoulder, walking away.
She pulled the sleeve of his uniform robe, and Malfoy let her slip them off his shoulders, so he was clad in just his Muggle suit, which was a light grey colour, with a smart, white shirt. He looked delicious.
“How dare you,” Draco said. “If I had a hair out of place, I’d know about it.” Potter threw back his head and laughed, and Draco wondered what other people were thinking, if they were looking at them, if people had noticed that Harry Potter was all but holding Draco’s hand, in front of a sculpted ice centrepiece with a giant frozen cock on it instead of a dolphin’s beak.
“Yeah, because Ron will have hurt feelings that you haven’t deemed him the hottest one,” Draco said with a smirk. “He’s so jealous and possessive when it comes to you.”
“You could always delegate the biting stuff to the fieldwork team, sir. I know Rosewarne has some experience with biting toilets, and I was around for the tea cup epidemic of 2002.”
“She’ll see I’m a young wizard in love, and will pity me.”
"No - it looks good. It's my favourite, actually."
The lift stopped at Level 2, and Draco pushed his way out.
He tried very hard not to breathe Malfoy in, but Malfoy smelled unfairly delicious, and then there was the matter of how lovely and warm, and firm, his body felt where it was pressed against Harry’s. He could feel his glasses slipping slowly down to his nostrils, aided by the sweat gathering on bridge of his nose. Malfoy hadn’t looked all sweaty and weird when
, Draco. I have my orders.”
“Yes.”
of these?”
Said pointy git patted Harry on the belly, his breath a rapid, moist puff against Harry’s throat. “Excellent shag,” Harry huffed into Draco’s hair, which was sweaty, with long strands of it catching in Harry’s stubble and sticking to Harry’s equally sweaty neck. “One of our best, I reckon.”
“Not even remotely,” Draco said, and he tried to arch his back even further. “Well, aside from the fact that when you started in the department a bit over a year ago, I wanted to strangle you, and now I all I want is to get my hands around your throat for entirely unrelated reasons.”
Malfoy shrugged, grabbed an enormous handful of crisps - Harry’s favourite, apple cider flavoured; they were supposed to
“What about it,” Draco said, baffled.
“I already said I agreed with you,” Draco said, swallowing the wine in one. “What do you want from me?” It wasn’t like he could go back in time and un-fuck Potter. Potter had seen to that himself, when he and his friends had smashed every Time Turner in the United Kingdom escaping Draco’s own father and his Death Eater chums.
, Draco, you can’t say
“Rude,” Harry said moodily to his can-crumpet.
She went pink. “He’s not mine,” Pansy stabbed the ruined lychee nervously with her straw.
“I’m right here, Draco, keep your hair on,” Granger levitated several jugs of foamy beer, and a stack of glasses, and managed to get them onto the table without spilling a drop. “Ron, I’ll need to share your chair, there isn’t enough room.”
“Let’s go to Hampton Wick, Harry,” Ginny was barely in the car before Ron started. Ginny groaned loudly.
He hated, hated,
“What was it, what were the things,” Harry asked, “that added up to me liking Malfoy?”
“Sold,” Potter said, and he was halfway out the door before he’d finished the word. “I’ll get my coat and see you back here in five minutes.”
“Oh, gross, Weasley,” Bujalski mimed vomiting into her pint. “I’ll never eat again, you prick.”
been smashing the dildo around between the artificial thighs of a sex doll. How was that fair? In fact, this was all quite horribly
“No.”
Her lips quirked. “Do you even like this place?”
“Oh.” Harry shrugged. “I normally try and do some work, I suppose.”
Twenty minutes later, Harry stepped into the shower behind Draco, who was still rinsing out some sort of hair mask. He plastered himself against the wet warmth of Draco’s back.
“Their birthdays are bookends,” Draco lifted his chin in the direction of the Gryffindor crew. “Potter and Longbottom. I’ll be fine on my own,” A lie. “As long as I can keep it in my pants, we don’t have a problem.”
“You forgot your
“So...you’re upset that I took responsibility away from you?” Potter transitioned from blank to confused. “But you’ve got so much work to do already, I thought you would have been happy to have less on your plate.”
Malfoy was laughing at his desk, tired and bruised-looking around the eyes.
“Shut up.”
“Unacceptable,” Draco muttered with fury, clearing a path through the muck with his wand as he struggled through the crowd to the lifts. Wix who were clearly less adept with charmwork held briefcases, and copies of the
“To explain to you exactly what you can expect if you do anything to displease Draco between now and the end of your life.”
He laughed. “I had an unfair advantage. Famously good at lip reading.” He leaned in close, and spoke directly into Harry’s ear. “Famously good with my fingers, too, for future reference.” Harry’s mouth was dry. He wasn’t quite sure how to respond. His body knew, but apparently it hadn’t let his mouth in on the plan. Orange Singlet Paul jostled Harry’s waistband again. “This is your first time out, isn’t it?”
“A million. A billion, maybe.” Harry’s hands slipped down, and cupped Draco’s backside. “Harry, no fondling me in front of McGonagall!”
In the bedroom, Potter lit the bedside lamps with a low, golden light. The bed, as always, was in disarray. “Shoes and shirt off, then on your stomach.” Potter was rolling up his shirtsleeves, and Draco unlaced his boots, set them carefully near the door, and unbuttoned his shirt. Potter watched him.
Harry rubbed a hand across his face, shoving his glasses up onto his forehead. “Circe’s tits, Malfoy.”
, complete with its unmissable front page headline.
“I’m not excited yet, but maybe you’ve forgotten what that looks like.” Potter pulled out the straw and dropped it on the bartop, and took a sip of the drink. “You know, since it’s been a while.”
“Thank you,” Harry said grumpily, not really annoyed with Draco, but playing along was half the fun, he’d learned. “Carry on, I suppose.”
with said item. He felt flustered and continued to sweat in a very annoying way that caused his wand to slip around in his fist, and his hair to form damp spikes which poked him sharply in the eyes.  Would Malfoy hang around to watch? He would probably need Malfoy’s help if there were special instructions for operating - it. Or maybe you just stuck it in. Could it be that simple? Harry recalled that it probably hadn't been quite that simple when real people’s privates were concerned, but this was just a lab test and there should be no need to perform any fancy moves...right? But what if Malfoy judged him for his
“I wanted to be the first person to say that to you this year,” Draco said, his voice low. “I think you’re the person I care about the most.”
The pitch was warded to the back teeth, and Potter had paced the sidelines with his wand drawn the entirety of each match. Teddy had probably never been safer in his short life. “See it? I squealed like a little baby crup.” He shook his head solemnly. “Very embarrassing for me. And I nearly had to change my pants!”
, maybe Luna or someone equally distracting, because if this went on much longer he’d do something bloody stupid. “To answer your question, yes, it’ll all be fine. It’ll last until at least Sunday, unless I end the charms, or extend them.” He looked at Harry, just smiling. “I think we’re probably done with the decorating. Are you ready to eat?”
“Seamus fully bolted up to the dorm, and Harry realised what he was doing and went after him, and we could hear shouting and things being knocked about, but then we heard Seamus absolutely hollering and sure enough he’d had a crack at Summoning that little album and it’d slid right out from under Harry’s pillow. We gave him
“Nev snoring?” Harry paused, and groaned. “Ron pissing.”
"Coming?"
Later, after they’d taken a drive to the charity shop and dropped off all Harry’s junk in the loading dock out the back, Hermione stopped the Renault at Grimmauld’s front gate, where Ron kissed him noisily on both cheeks and tried to shout as loudly as possible that Harry must try not to wank too often even if he was terribly lonely.
Harry grabbed his wrist, jerking his arm and forcing Draco to look at him.
“Let’s start with in the department.” Potter seemed amused. “I know we’ve had our differences, but I’ve been trying to be cooperative since I came on board.”
“Sorry Vicky, just a little internal debate that became external.” He took the cup from her extended hands, and balanced it on top of his Out tray. “You’re a star, thank you.” Vicky left as silently as she had come in, and Harry gave his mental Hermione a stern glare, and turned his mind toward his reports with determination. There was nothing wrong with his personal life, no matter what Subconscious Hermione, or actual Hermione, had to say about it.
,” Harry spluttered, mortified. “I mean, this wall, and all the customers. When I came in, there was nobody else in the shop.”
Harry was dancing on the balls of his feet by the time the Floo roared to life, and Draco hopped through. “Finally.”
each lash of Malfoy’s fist on his own cock, and he cursed himself again for not having taken care of his sex life some time ago.
Draco heaved an enormous (and only slightly exaggerated) sigh, and flopped directly onto Harry’s chest without making any obvious attempt to do so gently.
it, have they, not like the Weird Sisters-”
Well, he’d never noticed that. “What else?”
to get into it. He’d bought all the stationery Hermione had so excitedly recommended, a small fortune of it, with sticky flags and multi-coloured highlighters, and Tippex -
He shrugged. “It’s only Malfoy, Harry. I’d have had a few things to say about it if you’d told us you’re going to live as a hermit in the Forbidden Forest to try and seduce a centaur. Shagging Malfoy is probably one of the least alarming things you could’ve done, in the scheme of things.”
“What about my face?” Draco asked worriedly.
“So I am,” Malfoy murmured. “I should probably stop.”
“I think I might fuck you on that fancy chair,” Harry said breathlessly, and Draco went even pinker.
“There’s a good reason for that-”
Harry wandered out again and found himself in the sitting room, picking up stray case files and stacking them on the old corner desk. He didn’t really want to do any work, nor any housework, but he’s fidgety and doesn't quite know what to do with himself. It’s barely half-eight and he hasn’t any plans until his Sunday night workout.
Perhaps his eyes lingered too long. Potter was looking back.
“I see – reason for leaving?” Potter was wearing purple robes.
“What’s the word?” Ron said, peering under the tarp at the remains of the shrub cuttings, and generally poking at things on the bench. “What does it all mean?”
Prompt 'pumpkin', this is the most wordcount non-compliant yet.
“You weren’t a Prefect,” Draco panted, curling his toes. “You can’t hand out points.”
Draco stood in front of him now, and had gently wrapped his long fingers around Harry’s wrists. His own fists were clenched, and he focused on meeting Draco’s lovely grey eyes, which had softened again, as they often did, and on the warm touch sliding down his wrists to clasp his slowly opening hands.
Potter shook his head. “Six hours, and you’ve already advanced to sexting.”
“I told you it’d be a mistake.” Pansy sounded tired. Weary of his shit, probably. Draco could empathise. He was pretty fucking sick of his shit as well.
Finding an outfit for a Muggle club had taken practically the whole day, and Harry wasn’t convinced he had succeeded, now that he was taking a second look.
Ron raised an eyebrow. “In his knickers, you say?”
Harry sighed. “Point taken, Malfoy, but-”
“Please grab the wand before the penis, Harry,” Neville said loudly, and in a very put upon tone. “I feel like I shouldn’t have to ask, after all the complaining about loud pissing this week.”
“Fucking hell, Bog! Wear a bell, would you?”
Harry thumped his glass down on the table and pointed his finger in Malfoy’s face. “That’s a lie, and I won’t have you spreading such rubbish about my friend, Malfoy! You don’t know a thing about their relationship.”
He looked like something Harry would very much like to put his mouth on.
“Okay,” Harry said, helplessly. “You can come over for pasta salad.”
of Draco’s notebooks, the one he was using for the wedding planning, was on the kitchen table where he must have left it after making himself breakfast in the morning.
- and the flagstones were hell on both of their knees, but were otherwise clean as a whistle, and most importantly, right there, as they apparently couldn’t hold on long enough to reach a room with a rug, let alone any soft furnishings.
Weasley waved off the Junior Auror who came promptly to the door. “Shut your trap, Malfoy. Harry’s consulting.” Potter lifted his visitor lanyard and waved it smugly in Draco’s direction. It was Draco’s turn to raise an eyebrow.
The rest of the outfit was no easier. Harry tried all of his shirts, but found he looked disturbingly like Michael Flatley when pairing any one of them with the tight jeans, and quickly ruled them all out too. Something plain seemed like a safe choice, so he pulled on a white t-shirt, groaning when he found it barely reached his hips and clung to his shoulders and chest. In desperation he threw on an old leather jacket that had once belonged to Sirius. It was buttery-soft and somewhat comforting, and he felt slightly less exposed with it on.
Some hours, and several pints later, Malfoy slapped one hand decisively on the tabletop. “Home time, I think.”
“I thought you and Ginevra split up.” Malfoy’s voice is tight. He loads another deposit of pumpkin on the duck, and this time gets it into Ted’s mouth in one go.
was leading, right now, in his softly lit bedroom and his fingers that already brushed over the front of his jeans. But Malfoy. It felt good to want things again, to feel desire, to not know what was to come. Maybe that’s what all this had been about, the last ten years of nothing much. Nobody could argue that Harry hadn’t had more than his share of drama in his life; after school, and Voldemort, well, it hadn’t exactly stopped, had it? He’d chosen the Auror life, four years of intense training, then another six on the job before it had come to a head: take a promotion to Senior Auror, with a five year pathway to Deputy Head, then Head; or jump track to Misuse and live a quiet life for once.
Condensation dripped down the side of Weasley’s pint glass and gathered on the table. This wasn’t the sort of place that handed out beer mats. “What else is there, then, if all that stuff’s out?”
God, he was so
“Come on, then,” Malfoy inclined his head to the kitchen door.
“Actually, it’s equal second, I don’t report to you-”
Harry stepped closer to the wall and gave it an experimental poke with one finger. It felt smooth like glass, but slightly warm, and a small ripple spread from the point of contact and wobbled outwards until it faded. “Where did you find this stuff?” Harry didn’t bother to disguise his curiosity. “I’ve never even heard of it before.”
She uncovered her face. “For what it’s worth, I did bet against it, however in my defense I was rather keen on getting in your pants myself at that point. Having said that, I did always harbour a bit of a fantasy about you and Malfoy in the Quidditch changing room.” Ron gagged and took a large mouthful of orange juice as if to wash away a bad taste.
“Roger,” Malfoy helpfully supplied.
Potter let out a miserable groan. “Fuck. Draco. Please listen, will you - just listen to me for a second?” Draco looked away from him, and into the cold grate of the fireplace. “How could I have known you wanted something like that? You always leave.”
Draco couldn’t help the small smile that twisted his lips, and Potter grinned back. “I’m sorry I called you ‘Pinhead’. Lashing out.” Potter shrugged it off. “And I don’t want you to think I’d hate working for you, or that you’re not good enough for the job. You are.” Draco sighed again. “I guess I’m just frustrated that I’ve spent ten years jumping through hoops for a man who hasn’t appreciated it for a second.” He let his head fall against Potter’s shoulder with a thunk.
“I always wanted your attention.” Malfoy said it quietly, with a little smile on his lips, his eyes on the bottles of booze lined up behind the bar. “I’m a simple creature, Potter. I went about it the only way I knew how. Being a little bastard.”
“It’s not strange at all,” Harry said, fondly. “I think it’s kismet.”
That sent his cousin into a snorting cascade of laughter. “Oh my
“Already sorted, Mr Malfoy,” said Pierce, now back from the loos, and clad head to toe in emerald.
“Nobody thinks you’re an idiot, Harry.” Hermione said reassuringly, and then after a moment, when neither of his other so-called best friends said a word in agreement, she scrunched her nose apologetically, and amended, “not
“Are you going to manhandle me?” Malfoy’s voice was high and breathy, almost as if he were enjoying this. “I love a good scrap.”
Bog pushed an envelope onto the duvet. “Urgent message from the Ministry for Auror Malfoy.”
“Fingers,” Harry breathed. How could Malfoy even hear him, over all this noise. “I like his hands.”
No, he was thinking about how Malfoy’s throat might feel under his mouth.
The sounds of the pub came upon him suddenly, as if switched on. A Muggle place, free of wizarding journalists, dark and fairly quiet aside from the low murmur of conversation, and the chink of cutlery on plates. He looked down at his own plate - roast lamb, and red wine gravy. Mashed potatoes on the side, creamy white mounds, and a pile of fat, green peas nestled beside it. He went to pick up his fork, and found it already in his hand.
The smell of him still filled Harry’s nostrils, from the brief moment Malfoy was pressed against him in the lane - he’d desperately wanted Malfoy to kiss him then, and the needy tug of desire showed no sign of easing with distance or fresh park air. Harry was fairly sure he’d never felt so frustrated, and he was definitely positive he’d never felt more like taking someone home, or being taken home by them, with the unequivocal intent to fuck. But here he was, standing in a park in Islington at ten to two in the morning, with three quarters of an erection and a very slight ringing in his ears.
Instead of that, he was awake, far too early and entirely against his will. He’d been in the middle of a frankly sinful dream wherein he was receiving a deep tissue massage from several well-oiled and scarcely clad members of the Australian National Quidditch Team, and it was a crime — literally, a
“I’m having a creepy thought,” Ginny’s eyes are fixed on Teddy. “That this is what our children would look like.”
He laughed, and brushed the wetness from his eyes. “No. It’s fucking horrible.” Draco held out his glass, and gently clinked it against hers. “Thanks for coming.”
.” Draco popped the ‘p’ as much as he could manage with vodka numbed lips. “Anyway, there was a fire at our school and he dragged me out. I would have died. Now he’s grown up and he’s a-” Draco fumbled for the Muggle word, “-detective. Still saving the helpless, with his big arms and thighs.” He sighed. “So, to answer your question, he looks like a hero. With round glasses and green eyes, and sex hair - black sex hair.” Draco very quietly eased out a vodkary belch. “And scars all over the place, but the best one’s right on his head, it sort of zigzags and bisects his eyebrow.” He looked at Cabbage Head, who seemed dumbfounded. Probably never heard the word ‘bisected’ before. “That means it cuts through-”
“What, like fifteen years ago? Are you still worried about those things?”
“Right – well. My investigation.” Harry cleared his throat and retrieved his notepad and a self-inking quill from the inner pocket of his robe. Malfoy gestured towards a small, glass walled office in the corner of what Harry could now see was a large warehouse. Crate after crate was stacked on neat shelves, with helpful signs such as ‘Dildos – glass (3-6 inches)’ and ‘Nipple clamps’. Harry felt sweaty and flustered, and wasted no time striding into the small room and taking a seat on the opposite side of what was clearly Malfoy’s desk.
“Split up, yes. Had a couple of kids, didn’t they?”
“Help me tie this fucking thing, will you?”
“Potter if you don't stop putting yourself down, I’m going to have to take you over my knee.”
“We’ve reservations at The Wolseley,” Parkinson said with a small smirk. Malfoy’s eyebrows rose.
The minute the whole table had finished their answers, Harry volunteered to get the next round, and Apparated halfway across the pub without checking whether they wanted beer again, or something stronger.
“He’s not mine,”Malfoy said smoothly. “But I have to agree with you about the eyes.”
“That’s expected of me, though. I’m posh.” Draco levitated his cup wandlessly while he fished for his wand in his coat pocket. Givenchy wasn’t really the most appropriate attire for work. The pockets were too fussy, and his thigh holster was much more convenient. “And it’s hardly head to toe. My socks aren’t cashmere. Neither are my shoes, or my coat.”
“Bottoms up, Potter.” Malfoy raised his glass and Harry did the same, then lifted it to his lips for a slow sip. The scent of honey filled his senses, and the mead burned down his throat in a hot rush. “If things go well tonight, this might not be the only bottom you find is up for you.” And then, Harry was choking, coughing down the thick liquid as the fumes stung his sinuses. Malfoy was laughing. “Good lord, Potter, relax. I’ve really never seen anyone wound quite so tightly as you.”
he could almost hear Malfoy whisper, and Harry felt his heart pick up. He thrust it gently in, then out.
Potter’s wand was tracking the magical signature. Draco was using his own to sweep the area for threats, of which there were none so far, unless you counted the peat bogs, or the incessant wind, which frankly, Draco did, particularly after the third time he stumbled. An old barn was just ahead, and Draco could detect a massive, but benign magical presence, consistent with a very large number of Ministry owls.
Malfoy looked at Harry with amusement. “Only if the ‘one’ was attached to a person, Potter. Otherwise they don’t have their own heat source, although they will warm up on contact with the body.”
Draco pressed his lips together, and attempted not to catch the scent of Potter’s shampoo. His joggers were cashmere Tom Ford, and his hoodie was cashmere McQueen. Even his trainers were designer, but he suspected Potter knew that, considering he was obviously wearing Prada Chelsea boots himself, and over £600 a pair at that, not to mention the Balmain jeans.
“Yep.”
"No - yes - I mean, I don't
“Can’t say.”
Tuscan wind chimes.
“You can’t Apparate out of the Ministry, Potter, and especially not from the Ward Room.” Potter just looked at him. “Don’t tell me.
“I wondered where you’d got to lately,” Potter had said, smoke curling in the pink morning light. “Given up leg day for this?”
Harry coughed and pulled self-consciously at the hem of his t-shirt, then ran a nervous hand through his hair. “Yeah, sorry. I don’t really have a clue about clothes. I probably should’ve asked Hermione for help. You look-”
“I’ve actually got some things shrunk in my pocket, just in case. I could always stay at a hotel, if it’s any impos-”
Draco got up with false reluctance. “Don’t ruin my risotto, Potter, I’ve been looking forward to it all day.” He bumped softly into Harry, and pressed his face into his shoulder. Harry put his free arm around Draco’s waist and pulled him close.
“Malfoy – hi. That wasn’t what it looked like.”
“Dunno, I guess you must have mentioned it a couple of times.” He’d mentioned it just the once. They’d both been pissed as newts. Harry thought it might have been the moment he realised his feelings had gone beyond just friendship with Malfoy, listening to him talk about introducing the near extinct species to the copse at the bottom of his mother’s estate, his eyes alight and his hands gesturing gracefully between them.  “Happy birthday, anyway. Next year I won’t forget.”
me? You stupid fuck. Smith hates us both, remember that. So while I’m obeying every one of his nonsense, bullshit rules, he can still use
Harry nodded and cleared his throat. “I’ll get you a drink, and then I’ll pop upstairs for a quick tidy.”
Draco was burning hot and clenching tight around him. He rocked and thrust and fucked himself unapologetically over and over, while Harry's eyes swam. He closed his hands around Draco's prick and
“Don’t you
“No need. Already pulled them, and had a quick go through. I’ve made some notes for Potter and I to guide the secondary interview, if the Keepers can manage to stop their weeping long enough to be intelligible.”
“You are mad,” Draco said fondly. He let Potter put his arms around him, and settled comfortably against his chest. Now that he was used to him, he really couldn’t imagine not having Potter around the office. He really couldn’t remember what it had been like before he’d joined the team, to be honest. “Can I tell you a something no one else knows?”
So Harry told Draco about the Healer’s visit, and the off-hand comment that had sparked his idea, and about his visit to Zabini, while Draco ate his steak and salad, and hand-cut chips, and laughed delightedly.
“Nothing. Sorry. Didn’t mean to be dramatic. Just. I’m sort of maybe seeing someone.”
Draco raised a hand to his lips, pressing his fingers to them in near confusion - had Potter really just kissed him?
“Well, what am I hearing, then?”
“Are you really?” Hermione’s voice was soft and encouraging, a tone he’d heard her take many times with her children. Harry felt himself beginning to sweat.
“Yes, thank you,” Draco said with exasperation. “I don’t need it spelled out for me.”
die of jealousy. He sighed. “I don’t understand where the line is with you Slytherins.”
“Thank you.”
Draco started almost as badly as Weasley had. “Jesus Christ, Potter. What are you doing here?” The man himself was leaning inadvisably far back in Weasley’s guest chair, jammed in the corner and ready to ambush a person, and looking thoroughly amused. Draco sniffed, and tried very hard not to let on that his heart was hammering. “Last I checked, you didn’t work for the Aurors anymore.”
“Harry we have no issue with anyone you decide to see. You're an adult and you make your own decisions. You know what's right for you.” Hermione’s hand was warm and reassuring on his wrist again. Harry dragged the tines of his fork through the mess of beans and egg on his plate.
“You also promised me that you’d make sure nothing happened that I didn’t enthusiastically consent to. Malfoy,” Harry turned his face til their lips were almost touching. “If I consent any more enthusiastically, I’m going to tear a hole in the front of my trousers.”
Potter had already drained his tea, and was pouring a second cup. “Going to the Christmas party?”
Potter laughed again, and sat up, Summoning a pair of joggers from a chest of drawers across the room. “You’re not going to go home in the raw, are you? I mean, I know it’s Floo to Floo, but still. Imagine if you ended up in the wrong fireplace? Imagine if you burned something sensitive on the way through!”
“I was a queer kid living under the same roof as the Devil’s henchwoman. Voldemort used to pop in for tea with a ruddy great snake. There were werewolves living in the orchard. It wasn’t ideal.”
Bog just looked at him with swampy eyes before vanishing without a sound.
“Potter,” he said questioningly, but right as scheduled, Harry’s mobile rang, and he waved Malfoy off apologetically.
No, he bloody wasn’t. He was one deep breath of Potter’s shampoo away from swooning backwards and directly off his stool. “It’s afternoon, Potter,” Draco said, a little hoarse, pointing to the large clock above them. Potter squinted at it, and pushed his glasses up his nose.
“Before you go, since you mention it…” Harry rubbed the back of his neck nervously. “You haven’t noticed anything that might indicate that I might, well, that if we decide to, you know, have kids…”
He wasn’t heroic. He was a feckless idiot who thought rules didn't apply to him (Robards), who had a death wish (Hermione), and who didn’t have enough restraint to wait a fucking minute and consider the very reasonable advice of his long-suffering partner (Malfoy). All Harry knew, was that something in him urged him to
“Malfoy!” Ron bellowed, and slapped him on the back so hard Draco almost spilled his wine. “A little bird told me you’ve been transferred back onto the morning rotation. Shove over, would you, Parkinson.”
He clenched his hands on Draco's arsecheeks, thrusting up into the delicious circle of his fist.
Draco had picked up a set of gloves and was measuring them against his own hand. “So, what happened? This isn’t just a couple of months worth of gifts, Harry.”
She rolled her eyes. “You’re not scary. You’re like a grumpy kneazle at best. Potter came back from the dead, and killed a basilisk when he was like twelve. If that doesn’t frighten yet arouse you, there’s something wrong.”
“Sweetheart…” Harry put his right hand over Draco’s where it rested on his chest, and brought his left up to touch him as gently as he could, his fingers tracing Draco’s sharp jaw and pointed chin. Draco sighed.
Draco cast the charms to tie the laces on his oxfords as he took the stairs as quickly as possible, his shirt flapping open around his chest.
“You can’t call me little man anymore, I’m ten,” Teddy said, face mashed into Draco’s shoulder. Draco pressed a kiss to the top of his head. He still smelled like baby shampoo.
Draco gave him a look. “Because I know you, Potter. Also, Ron mentioned you’re off magic for the week, and I know you don’t know where we keep the matches.”
“That I think I like. A male person,  I mean. What I’m saying is, I went out with a man, that I like. Last night.” Ugh, this was already a disaster.
“Fellas! As much as I’d usually enjoy this weird mating ritual of yours, I don’t have the time, so can we please all focus on the issue at hand, which is several thousand missing owls.”
“I’m going to put an end to it.”
inner Hermione warned him.
“I – well, maybe I’ve ignored you because I don’t like you.”
“Behave yourself, Potter. We have a lot of work to do.”
“The one that used to reduce hardened criminals to custard in the interrogation room,” Hermione replied mildly. Ron wisely kept silent. “Let’s change the subject. How’s your love life?”
“Well, here’s some good news for you,” Ginny said, elbowing him in the side again, and holding out the orange creams. “I’m not your friend.”
“I don’t know what’s so funny,” Draco glared at him. “You’re wearing team colours too, practically everyone here is.”
Draco supressed a smirk. “
“But you will.”
“I’m telling you, Ron – keep it simple. Take her somewhere nice for dinner, and then a night at a nice hotel. And the Leaky does not count for either of those. Get her some flowers, she likes roses, right?”
“Yes, I’m very scary.” Draco refused to turn and look at Potter, and instead glared across the room to where the waiter was attempting to persuade Orange Robes not to molest the ice sculpture. It was not going well.
“Once,” Draco said, but that had been a very different experience. He’d been with Mother, and they were resetting the Manor wards. Even then, it had been unsettling to have someone else touch his magic that way, even someone he trusted and loved — he had no idea what this would feel like. The wards were older, the job was bigger, and there was the small matter of his unrequited infatuation.
“Is my virtue safe?” Potter asked, amused, and Draco pretended he didn’t feel the flush of embarrassment creeping up his throat.
Gems rattled into the hourglass, and Draco extracted himself from Potter’s grasp momentarily. From the relative safety of the buffet table, Draco nibbled on a vol-au-vent and watched Potter manipulate his audience. Was that what he was doing to Draco, as well? Potter caught his eye, and winked at Draco. He felt warm, and a little giddy. Perhaps he was manipulating him, but to what end? Potter was neither political nor ambitious, unless he had an incredibly obscure and slow moving plan in action. And should he be appointed by Scrivener as his replacement at some future point, well it was hardly the worst thing that could happen. Frankly, as long as Scrivener was out of the way Draco didn’t give a fuck who he worked for, and he had been silently preparing himself for the prospect of Potter as Undersecretary since his third week in the department.
“We can be the octogenarian Romeo and Juliet.”
Potter arranged himself beside Draco on the rug. Draco could only look at him, a dozen clever remarks ripe in his thoughts and ready to be delivered with a smirk – but instead, Draco just looked at Potter, and Potter smiled at him, white toothed and red cheeked, sweaty and sticky with come, and desperately attractive. Draco smiled back, and hardly spared a thought for how sweaty and come-streaked he was himself. Potter found his spectacles, abandoned in the heat of the moment by Draco’s dustbin, and finally disentangled his wristwatch from his shirtsleeve. He propped his head up on one hand, and just looked at Draco in silence. Eventually, he moved his hand to brush a dampened segment of hair from Draco’s forehead, murmuring something about a hair out of place.
Harry kissed him quickly on the mouth, and Levitated some plates from the cupboards. “We make the rules in this house, remember, so if dinnertime is at four, it’s at four. Serve the salad, would you, and I’ll slice up the meat.”
“Thanks for your hospitality, Potter. See you at work.”
, who on earth would be interested in whether he was on the market, or not. As far as Draco knew he was still social poison, and about as far from an eligible prospect as possible while not actually residing in Azkaban. “When you say ‘traditional’...?”
“By wand, do you mean wand, or do you mean penis?”
Ron laughed at him. “How long’s Malfoy been gone for this time?”
special, Potter - like, remedial Potions special.”
Potter came closer, and reached for Draco’s hand, pulling him to his chest. “I learned from very early on that ‘not angry, disappointed’ was code for ‘really fucking angry’. Actually, Hermione’s best spells were perfected while she was disappointed in Ron. Sometimes I think the War might have gone on a bit longer if Ron had been
“There bloody is. It’s your ‘I’m going to get involved where I’m not required’ face. I’ve seen it many, many times.”
Which meant cooking the muggle way, and cleaning the hut by hand, and washing his clothes in a tub, by hand. It meant digging the pumpkin patch using a real pick and elbow grease, and shovelling real manure around as required. Repairing the fences and scarecrows by hand. Cutting the grass surrounding the hut with a scythe when it got too tall. Keeping the fire lit using a tinderbox and logs, and chopping said logs with the heavy, old axe. And collecting those logs from the perimeter of the forest.
Harry snorted. “Give it a rest, you’ll give me ideas and I don’t have time for an extra long shower this morning.”
"You certainly jumped at the chance to be my warden though, didn't you Potter?"
Malfoy was just slightly below him, standing on the first step of the stairs. He gave Harry a small smile, and still seemed to be amused, rather than offended. “We haven’t been those boys in a long time, Potter. I’m sure I’ve never said this and I’ll probably deny it if asked, but I respect you. Seeing you in the state you were in last week brought back some unpleasant memories of my own coming out and I wish I’d had someone to tell me I wasn’t a freak. That it was okay not to be sure. That taking your time and waiting til you’re ready is perfectly sensible. That there’s no rush.”
Hermione beamed at him, and Harry tried to focus on safely making the turn into the laneway that led to the car park of the cafe, without rolling the Polo into a ditch and killing them all, or any of Ron’s precious deer.
we’ve sorted out the fucking owl problem?”

"Lube…quick, lube, I'm not long for it love, I'm sorry!"
“Were you thinking about the backyard?”
off and chewing smugly.
“Happy birthday, Harry,” Draco said again, and he came in and sat on Harry’s bed, right by his legs. His eyes were twinkling with the reflected flame of the birthday candle, and he picked up the cupcake with his long fingers, and held it out for Harry to take. “Make a wish.”
Harry’s knees wobbled, and Ron hoisted him up again. “No, I mean, we both think you’re hot. Ron,” Harry stopped mid-flight, and grabbed Ron by the shoulders earnestly. “Ron, you’re hot, you’re objectively hot, but you’re not the
Draco said Blaise would know what charity auctions would be coming up, that Harry could donate some of the more expensive, non-Muggle items to. He would be allowed to keep
Harry turned around when Ron didn’t answer, and found him wedging the last triangle of Harry’s toast into his already crammed mouth, looking only slightly ashamed of himself. “Wathabou ith I mathe yoo Heth Auler?”
“Guess that’s that, then.”
Draco moaned again. “Helga’s
“I beg to differ.” Michael Sheen was
"What?"
“I’ve already put down everyone I can think of, so I’ll read them out and you stop me if you have any objections.” Draco smoothed the paper out, and Harry sighed heavily, and tipped a ladle of broth over the rice. “Mum, Auntie A, and Tedward. Molly and Arthur, Bill, Fleur and the kids, Hot Weasley-”
“Harry,” Weasley said. “He’s been Bound, so he can’t say anything much about what he does to anyone. Physically can’t.”

“Um, add in my cousin but
Malfoy remained utterly composed, as he had for the duration of their somewhat bizarre meeting. “It’s my pleasure, Potter. I’m always happy to help the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.” He smiled slightly at Harry. “Be sure to let me know if I can be of any further service.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Do you mean in this department, or in the universe generally?” They had made it to Draco’s office door. Fishing his wand from the sleeves of his robes, he released the lock, and huffed again when Potter followed him in and made himself at home on Draco’s guest chair. With deeply felt irritation, Draco removed his outer robe, hung it neatly on the hook beside the door, and took his own seat on the other side of the desk.
had he asked? Harry’s embarrassment felt like it might become terminal. He cleared his throat and drew his eyebrows into what he hoped was a serious furrow. “Malfoy, are you aware of the current situation regarding the Chief Warlock’s garden?”
Harry barked a surprised laugh. “What was in that cigarette, Malfoy? I think you’ve forgotten I was a spotty, speccy runt with hair like an old toothbrush. Were you smoking them at Hogwarts, too?”
“Um. Well, it’s, he-”
She nodded, and Draco set about taking the sample and explaining what would happen next, while Potter took inventory of the owls, and sent a Patronus back to the Ministry. Before long, several Aurors and all of the Owl Keepers arrived to begin the monumental task of getting the owls safely back to the Ministry. Then Draco and Potter brought her in.
“You’re in Mysteries, then. We don’t have any other classified divisions.”
“Roger,” Harry agreed. Malfoy hoisted Roger’s bulky frame onto its front, the bollocks thunking gently as they moved.
“Scrivenation, the art of predicting the mood of Undersecretary Scrivener based on patterns of behaviour, such as wardrobe, choice of morning beverage, and whether or not there’s a staff meeting scheduled. It’s actually quite a bit more accurate than its magical cousin, Divination.” Wedderburn made a noise like a besotted sheep, and Malfoy shushed him.
“Harry Potter,” Draco sat at the bar like a common drunk, and realised, through the haze of vodka, that he’d ranted this aloud, when someone seated to his left responded. “What’s this Harry Potter look like?”
, the thought was intrusive and very nearly exited his actual mouth. “Do you need anything from your flat?”
Harry shook his head. “The usual.”
“He’s right,” Ginny said. “You do look exactly like a toe. Now, throw down your fucking card, Ron! A quick game’s a good game.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “She’s not still - for goodness sake.” He held out the card again. “I’ve got plenty of money, I don’t need free drinks from her.”
“Nonsense,” Malfoy said smoothly. “Listen, if you’re not doing anything Thursday night, I was wondering if you’d do me a favour.”
“Right, he’ll get upset that I took you to bed. Jealous git.”
He gripped the mantle until his knuckles went white. “What the fuck were you doing talking about me to Longbottom?” And what the fuck was Longbottom doing talking to Potter about Draco?
Malfoy’s face was doing that thing again, where he smiled mostly with his eyes, and looked amazing. “What, you don’t think I can keep it up long enough?”
No, not thinking of Malfoy, thinking about himself. His eyes. He’d always liked them too, as soon as the first person had told him they were just like his mothers. They were a nice green, a warm sort of green. Right now the green was almost swallowed up by black. That was definitely a little bit hot.
Potter really needed to take more responsibility for his own actions, actually. It was hardly fair of him, wandering around in unbuttoned uniform - worse, when he unbuttoned it, one handed, fingers lazily slipping button after button from their loops, while Potter leaned against this very same door. Chatting casually to Draco like he wasn’t all but stripping for him.
“I love you,” Draco whispered into his ear, and Harry was melting hot, and gasped that he was going to come, and Draco said it again, “I love you, Harry,” and that was how he finished, spilling, bucking hard and without grace.
“You’ve been flirting with me since I came into your shop.”
Harry looked at Malfoy with what he knew must be a pathetic expression - grateful, besotted, dumb as a bag of hair - but Malfoy was talking to Pereira, and pouring himself a glass. Dignity intact for the moment.
Harry blinked. Malfoy was standing beside Harry’s bed, in Harry’s room. Malfoy was wearing rather skimpy briefs, and a thin, silky robe that wasn’t tied up, and nothing else, other than a glare, and some impressive bed head.
“Then maybe we shouldn’t be having it.”
“I don’t know! Get me whatever I need to make calls and send those messages. The sooner the better.” He paused. “Please.”
Draco had looked up at Harry at some stage, and evidently his creeping sense of impending doom was showing, even upside down. “That’s a lot of bedrooms.”
They pushed and pulled at each other; clothing was wrenched from shoulders and arms, belts hastily unbuckled and dragged through loops. Potter seemed particularly skilled at clutching Draco to his body, rubbing himself hard against any part of Draco he could find, whilst simultaneously divesting Draco of his clothing at a steady pace. It was almost as if he had a very useful extra pair of hands, Draco thought wildly, his head spinning from oxygen deprivation and the sheer lack of blood in most parts of his body but one. The moment came when they were almost entirely naked; Draco’s trousers were caught in a bunch around an ankle, and he was fairly sure Potter’s wristwatch was caught in the cuff of one shirtsleeve. There was nothing between them but a thin sheen of sweat, and Draco breathed hard against Potter’s throat, the pulse which beat against his lips echoed in the heated thrum of Potter’s cock pressed firmly into his hip.
Draco, bless his cunning and perfectly shaped backside, had also worked out the best way to get Harry-related admin done. This was something he’d figured out in their early days as Aurors, although these days his methods were far more intimate. The key was to make sure Harry was immobilised - getting his hair cut at the barbers, being measured for robes, or, stirring a fussy risotto - and strike. Equally as important was not giving Harry too many choices to pick from. This tactic was a proven winner. Draco already knew virtually all of Harry’s preferences, so he came prepared with simple decisions like midnight blue metallic or classic black for the exterior, and cream leather or grey for the interior, and two bedrooms with ensuite and downstairs loo, or three bedrooms and a family bathroom.
Potter shrugged. “I like sports.”
“In and out, Potter,” Malfoy prompted with obvious amusement.
, Draco.”
“Don’t care,” Draco said, one hand raised to shush him, the other lifting the last of his drink to his mouth.
can in fact do this, but you can’t tell me how.” Potter opened his mouth, but Draco waved him off. “Nevermind, Potter. Let’s just get this done.” He looped an arm through Potter’s and ignored the smell of chocolate. “If you Splinch me, I’ll have your balls. If you damage my coat, I’ll kill you. Understood?”
“Is that the Throttlebottom case you’re working on, Potter?” Harry cringed. It was apparent by his tone that Shacklebolt knew very well that it was not, and it was equally as apparent that he was fairly unimpressed by that knowledge. The fact that the Minister for Magic was taking time out to make a personal visit at all was hardly a good omen.
“Zabini,” Harry beamed, and held out a latte. “Could you spare a minute?”
“It’s alright, Verity. I can’t say you’re not in a world of trouble, but I’ll make sure everyone understands you had good intentions. I’ll vouch for you,” Harry smiled at her warmly. “I’m the famous Harry Potter, so they’ll listen to me. No Tower of London for you this time.” She gave a watery chuckle, and Draco’s heart did strange things again, as did his belly, and his legs, a little. “Auror Malfoy needs to take a sample of your magic, and then we have to bring you in. Do we have your consent?”
Draco’s hair tickled his face, and Harry reached up blindly, still half asleep and without his specs. “No. I don’t want you to go. I’m keeping you here with me.” He managed to pull Draco down on top of him, and Draco went, laughing softly.
Like a
Ginny hummed in agreement. “That
Harry did indeed love posh soaps, and if that were all they needed, then he wouldn’t be feeling so anxious about it. But that’s not all that was needed. Not by a long shot.
Ron had bits of bok choy sticking out of his mouth. “So he’s really not going back to Auroring, then?” Harry shook his head, and Ron chewed sadly. “Fuck. I can’t say I’m surprised, but still. He was a really good partner.”
Ginny’s eyes narrowed. “I’ll have you know-”
“Calm down, you complete knob,” Draco said softly. “I can see you panicking.” Harry cracked open one eye, and saw Draco had crawled over the remaining gloves to sit right beside him. He looked down at Harry, with a small frown, and then put his hand flat and firm in the centre of Harry’s chest. He felt himself relax almost immediately. Things would be alright. Draco wouldn’t be looking at him like that if he was about to chuck him.
“Yeah, sorry. Just got a lot on my mind.”
And Harry laughed around his cock, because Draco was the funniest person he knew, even seconds away from orgasm, and Draco was really moaning now. Harry traced his fingertip over the tight furl of Draco’s hole, closed his eyes and reached out with his magic, and
“Holy fuck—!” Draco ripped the eye mask off, his wand in hand in seconds thanks to years of drills and training, and pointed dead in the face of whoever was now in his bedroom, mumbling directly into his ear.
“Ron,” Harry sighed. “You know where I stand on this.”
At the sound of his name, spoken by Potter, his vision clarified. His hearing came back to him and he finally focused on the person speaking to him. Yes, Potter. He took a gasping breath, suddenly feeling as if he hadn't been breathing deeply enough for all the long hours they'd been here, at the Wizengamot. His mouth worked for a moment without sound, before he managed a dry whisper which cracked in the middle.
“Let’s get the fuck out of here, Neville, before I lose one of my favourite extremities.”
“But you’re not having one with anyone else, though, are you? In fact, I can’t remember the last time you pulled, or even made an attempt.”
“You’ve done very well tonight, Potter. Very well indeed.”
Draco's eyes adjusted to the dim light. Potter was to the left of him, watching him earnestly, an air of nervous energy about him. Why would Potter be nervous? If anyone, it should be Draco, coming to live in a strange house that smelled like the Black's, with a man whom he -
Except...well.
Mollified, Malfoy drew a blank sheet of parchment from the tray on his desk and picked up a quill. “Specifications?”
“Well, unfortunately it means I’m still not really anywhere near fixing the problem of the cocks in the Throttlebottom’s garden. I still don’t
“How did it make you feel, to be the object of her desire? To know how much she wanted you?”
Harry spotted some cans of lemon-flavoured mineral water in the door, and bypassed his usual beer in favour of it. Lemon reminded him of Malfoy. Lemon sorbet, lemon madeleines, lemon-drop biscuits. “Do you mind?” He gestured to Ron with the can, and Ron shook his head, and went back to seasoning the chicken.
“That we did.”
His stomach churned, and he let Potter lead the way, protect him, lead him out of the den of wolfish press and away.
Potter’s fingers traced the crease along Draco’s hip and thigh. Draco knew that Potter would touch him, soon, but the agony of waiting even a matter of moments kept his breathing ragged and his nerves raw. As his hand closed around Draco’s prick, Potter opened his eyes and looked at Draco, and Draco felt his heart pound harder. He was sticky with need, and Potter smeared his thumb through the wetness until Draco gasped his name, and in the next moment, he was silent, barely able to breathe as Potter first rubbed the tip of Draco’s prick across his bottom lip, then slid his mouth down the length of it entirely. Draco’s fingers went to Potter’s hair, carding through the damp strands and twisting them around his fingers, and Potter groaned around Draco’s cock, his mouth slick heat and suction, and too much, and not enough, all at once. Potter’s hands gripped him, fingertips pressing hard into his flesh until there was no chance of escaping bruising; one hand was splayed at the base of Draco’s cock, holding him still and alternately gripping, stroking upwards to meet the downward slip-slide of Potter’s mouth. The other grasped Draco’s thigh, had hoisted it up and over Potter’s shoulder, and Draco could feel the slight scratch of stubble on Potter’s jaw on the inside of his thigh, could feel it on Potter’s chin as it scraped Draco’s balls. He was going to fucking come, he could feel it in his spine, in the clenching of his calves, he could feel it burning in his chest as if he had run a marathon. The rug bit at his shoulders and heels as Draco’s spine arched, and Potter knew precisely what was coming, had abandoned Draco’s thigh in favour of a hand between his own while the other pressed Draco’s hip to the floor, and all the while his mouth was a constant, wet pressure, too tight, too hot, too fucking much. Potter didn’t stop, wouldn’t stop, and Draco was coming and Potter was taking it all, taking all of him, every drop, every jerk and pulse of his cock, every broken moan and bead of sweat. Then Potter pulled away with a whispered curse, his fist quickening, and Draco felt the hot brand of come on his thighs, and heard Potter say his name on a ragged breath. Draco, for his part, couldn’t imagine ever being able to organise his thoughts enough to ever speak a word again; he suspected the ability had left him at speed along with his orgasm.
Martin gave Malfoy what appeared to be an almost warm smile, if he was capable of such a thing. He was enormous, with a neck as thick as one of his own meaty thighs, and he looked like he might burst out of his suit jacket with one unexpected sneeze. “Mr Malfoy, good to have you back. Are you joining us this evening?”
“Dunno,” Harry shrugged. “Willpower?”
“What’s the story with Potter having photos of you?”
of fancy moves? And assumed Harry was just crap in bed. Not that he cared what
“Mmm, but I’m famously a workaholic. What’s your excuse?”
The door slammed open a second time, and Potter burst in. “I had no idea, honestly. Are you okay?” Potter’s glasses fogged in the humid air almost instantly, and he took them off and spelled them clear, before replacing them on his nose and staring at Draco with owlish concern.
