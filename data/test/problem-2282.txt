Malfoy turned, drying his hands in a towel. “Have Ginny and Luna shown you around any more of the city yet?”
The sensation of Harry holding him, so vividly imagined, it felt like a real memory. Of Harry taking his hand. Meeting his eye in the hall.
He wished he had someone to talk with. At moments like these, he missed Snape with an awful pang, the miserable bastard. He could ask his potions mastery mentor for advice, but he didn’t want to admit he was working on another project, not after receiving the three-month warning from him. And his mother was out of the question.
The seagull above had been joined by another. They cried out and dived, squabbling over a scrap on the ground.
Ginny drove the way she flew: fast, smooth. He slipped into the exultant feeling. They passed golden fields, electrical posts, thick stands of conifers.
, and grabbed the first clean clothes that came to hand. He looked down at himself and realized how mismatched and disorganized he was in an orange Cannons t-shirt, blue button-down, and black jeans.
Harry stopped to watch from across the street. An occasional car passed by, briefly blocking Harry’s line of sight, but he didn’t pay them any attention. The sight of the man’s hands pushing into the dough—turning it, pressing it back together again—arrested him. Maybe it was the confident, sure movement. Maybe it was the way the man coolly ignored the two people staring from just the other side of the window. Maybe it was the total focus he directed onto the task. Harry had seen Molly make bread plenty of times; he’d even made bread, himself. But the baker behind the window was completely absorbed by his task in a way that made it something more.
.” The suggestion sends an immediate lance of fear and nausea through him. Malfoy flinches, and Harry says again, in a more even tone, “No.”
Also, he liked his cubicle. He liked its three flimsy walls and the pictures tacked all over them—Ron and Hermione and the kids, Charlie grinning over the neck of a sedated dragon, Teddy waving from a broom. He felt at home here. Certainly more at home than he did at Grimmauld Place.
again,” he hissed. He clanked the jar onto the counter and stalked to the front door. He shoved his feet into boots and cursed as he plunged into the fine cold rain. He reached for his wand, but his fingers met the flat material of his trousers. He’d left it inside in the kitchen.
That inexplicably angered Harry. “Well, what was I supposed to think? Of course I thought you were lying. You were a suspect.”
Thank Merlin it was so early in the year. There were a few evergreens—mostly non-magical—but some of the more…interesting plants were still dormant or hadn’t sprouted yet. That wasn’t true for
“You know,” Ron said casually, stabbing up a bit of chow mein. “Bill’s wrapped up in a project for the next couple of weeks. I’m sure he’ll be happy to come over after that.”
“Bugger it,” he muttered, and set off towards the rose bushes and the three tall, willowy dairy goats ripping chunks from the branches.
Harry blinks. “Thanks. I think. There wasn’t much chance of dodging it, considering I jumped in the way.”
“You little escape artist,” he murmured, and couldn’t keep the disgusted affection from his voice. “How in the name of Morgana are you getting out?”
Fortunately, the food came shortly after. Harry decided he was grateful for the waiter, even if he did want to hex him when the bloke looked at Malfoy. But why should Harry care, anyway? Let him wink at Malfoy and his stupid hat. It made no difference to Harry.
Alarmed, he checked the wards again; they must have been malfunctioning because they told him no one was there.
The only thing he doesn’t tell her about is Malfoy’s involvement in charities. It feels like that is not his information to share.
Back in the sitting room, he set the chest on the table and smoothed a hand over its top. His mouth was dry. He lifted the lid.
Malfoy was doing, work Harry thinks is important, work that Harry wants to contribute to, as well. At the time, he wasn’t thinking about himself or about Malfoy, not as personalities. But of course the press and the public would only see it that way.
Ginny pointed across the field to cast another marker. “So how’s it going with your big gay awakening?”
Ginny opened the door of a car parked along the pavement and then crossed over to the passenger—no, the driver’s—side.
Sure enough, Malfoy was already inside. He had claimed a corner booth near a window. The glow from the stained glass lamp above the table threw colored light over his hair. He was dressed in a shimmery grey shirt and charcoal jeans, which were at once more casual and more fashionable than anything Harry had seen him in at the coffeehouse. In comparison, Harry felt drab in his khaki trousers and brown button-down.
He steadied himself on the railing as he walked up the porch steps. No shame in using a handrail. That’s what it was there for.
“I think Luna’s out back,” Ginny said, slamming her own door shut. “Do you want to go down and say hi? I’ll get your bag.”
“Classical rules,” Malfoy says, tapping his wand to the deck. The cards shuffle themselves with a buzz.
Harry botched his first two attempts to pour a latte. Malfoy hovered over him and clicked his tongue and said something about “velocity,” which did nothing to help Harry understand why the steamed milk wasn’t mixing properly with the thick espresso when he poured it in.
There’s Malfoy: Malfoy standing down Hills and Bate with cool aplomb, as if he hadn’t been rattled out of bed before he’d had his morning tea. Malfoy allowing Harry to act as his proxy in the search so he wouldn’t have to watch the aurors pry apart his life. Malfoy trying to pry
They watch as past-Harry researches Malfoy’s records at the Ministry. Harry did not consciously choose to include this memory, but the magic must have pulled it in. Unfortunately.
“I feel much better. The healer says I’ll be good to go home soon.” He pushes aside his mostly-empty dish. He steels himself and meets his friend’s gaze. “Hermione, what happened to Malfoy? There’s something you’re not telling me. Whatever it is, it’s causing me more worry to speculate.”
“Oh. No.” His mind raced. Saturday was less than a week away. He hadn’t realized so much time had passed already. His thoughts went to Ginny and Luna and the farm, then came to Malfoy and stayed there. Malfoy and the night they’d had.
“Will you stop that?” Draco snapped as Potter inspected the details on the antique bone china set, leaning so close that he passed into the cabinet. Maybe it was seeing Potter move through solid surfaces, or maybe it was the instinctual fear that he
He did like Curse-Breaking when he was practicing it alongside Bill. They kept up an easy conversation, and any time Harry got stuck on a curse, Bill figured out the bit that was giving him trouble. But one afternoon, Bill went downstairs to get lunch, while Harry volunteered to keep working on the curse that had been giving them trouble all day. Not a particularly tricky curse—just time-consuming to pull apart. Alone in the attic, picking apart the little knots of magic, Harry quickly grew bored and exhausted and lonely.
It wasn’t a moment before Chesterfield and Williams were there, shouting warnings to Malfoy, putting an arm around Harry’s shoulders.
It all plays out around them, including Harry’s compulsive cooking for Malfoy and even Harry’s sleepless nights over the weekend as he worried about the hearing. (How had those ended up in the pensieve?) His shock that the hearing had been postponed, his anger that Hermione and Malfoy hadn’t told him about the postponement, him sitting alone in his house with shaking hands.
The platform continued to rise. From above, the magical folk looked so small. The whole magical bookshop, however, only appeared to get bigger. There were
Malfoy sighs. “Why don’t you join me in the parlor, Potter? How nice of you to drop by. I’m sorry I didn’t know you were coming. I would have had tea set for us.” But he’s walking while he talks, and Harry rolls his eyes at his back.
Malfoy paid for the book and slipped it into his bag, then he took Harry through a side door. They exited into a sunken courtyard occupied by artists selling paintings and little stuffed magical creatures and knitted accessories. Harry bought a small Thunderbird for Luna and a Snitch beanie for Ginny.
“All right.” He cleared his throat and turned to the pitcher of water she’d set out for him to practice on. “Er…” He made the wand movement and stumbled through the incantation from what he
Leaves rustled. A hemp cord hanging over the pathway swayed. Draco didn’t move, only gave another whistle.
Then there were the costs of feed for the creatures and delivery fees and repairs to the house, when he couldn’t manage those himself.
Harry pulled his gaze away from Malfoy. There, hanging from the wall, were a number of small, framed etchings.
Something about that vulnerability had Harry sitting up, and he kissed Malfoy. Malfoy seemed like he expected to either plunder Harry’s mouth again or be plundered, but Harry deflected his tongue and took control of the kiss sweetly, grazing his teeth over Malfoy’s lips, sucking, caressing.
Harry faced disciplinary action. The Unspeakables didn’t take kindly to the maltreatment of their own. Not that Harry could have known Malfoy was an Unspeakable. Robards argued this fact, argued that it was stupid to have kept the knowledge from Harry in the first place. It was irresponsible and reckless, and if Robards had been able to tell Harry as he’d originally argued, then they wouldn’t be in this predicament now.
Malfoy blinks owlishly and relaxes back in his chair. “Touchy, Potter. I didn’t say there was anything
The thought came with a vivid image of Malfoy’s sharp profile as he drove. “You should probably be sitting down for that one,” Charlie had told him with a grin—and maybe in private, Harry reckoned as he glanced in shock at the label, which depicted an anthropomorphic letter D with hooded eyes and with large cherries floating above its head like thought bubbles, each with a little drawing of a daydream inside.
“You spent a lot of energy working in the attic this last week,” Hermione said, casually, as she unloaded a platter of chicken. (“Mum cooked it,” Ron mouthed at Harry, in reassurance.) “Bill said you liked Curse-Breaking?”
him. It was just…his thoughts were still jumbled, and he needed them not to be so jumbled when he saw Malfoy again.
Hermione frowns. Glances at the clock—both the real one and the one next to it with her, Ron, and Harry’s names. Ron’s hand is still pointed at “Work.”
Malfoy scrutinizes him, tapping his long fingers on the tea cup. “So when you cast powerful spells, you can’t breathe.”
Malfoy murmured a charm. A shiver of alarm went through Harry, but in the next instant, the view in the telescope cleared and sharpened. Harry found himself looking at a number of shops and buildings.
Harry’s heart pounds. It’s the combination of port and adrenaline. Malfoy regards him with the look of a cat that’s got the mouse by the tail.
A little bag flew to him. He poured a small pile of dried grubs onto his hand and lifted his open palm.
, whose umbrella-like leaves glistened with beads of water from the last rain. It was a spitting image of its cousin, the
They hesitated a moment at the fireplace, and a weird, charged moment passed in which Harry wanted to kiss Malfoy but didn’t know whether it would be welcome. For an instant, Malfoy’s gaze flickered to Harry’s mouth. A thrill went through Harry.
Harry feels sick all over again at that. He sneaks a surreptitious look at Malfoy and finds him still as stone and pale.
They parted, and she smiled up at him. “We’re so glad to have you here, Harry. It’s really nice that you finally have the time.”
Harry frowned and stopped at something he noticed on one of the windows. A silvery line with a star, like an asterisk, at its end. It stood up vertically, and it gleamed with different colors, like the shimmer of oil on water. “What does that symbol mean? There’s one on your door, as well. It looks like a wand. Is it for wizarding establishments?”
Draco snorted, and touched tiny Harry’s head. He flipped the page, and he and Harry were receiving their first Auror assignment together.
“Not very long. I suspect the ley lines carried illness to the earth here. Or it might have been released by the Nibblers in the soil.”
If Draco wasn’t prepared to contribute to the hallowed science of potion-making, then he didn’t deserve the mastery.
He thought of the letters again. Lupin. His parents. The Order. Tonks. He threw another piece of bread to the seagulls. A small flock descended on it.
himself at Malfoy. But again, Malfoy dispersed before reforming, whisper-thin but unbreakable, a rapier, a pick, a crowbar. He stabbed inward, leaned hard.
Harry pointed and pulled the trigger. So did the others. For an instant, nothing happened, and Harry wondered if something had gone wrong. Then the air exploded with a high-pitched droning, and hundreds of fairies burst into the air.
“Yeah. Fine,” Harry says, pouring himself another glass. He catches Hermione eyeing the glass, so he only fills it a third of the way before setting the bottle back down. Alcohol doesn’t set the thing off, he’s told her. But Hermione…is Hermione, and it’s easier to limit his alcohol consumption than wage silent war with her all night. Anyway, he really
Harry blinked. He hadn’t realized that he had zoned out so completely. He came out of his daze, but the sense of being clear and empty and fully present stayed with him. “Hey, Malfoy.”
Harry’s head spins. He still hasn’t fully regained his breath from the walk to the courtroom. He left St. Mungo’s against his healer’s orders. He’s still furious with Hermione. She hadn’t told him about the hearing being held today. He learned about it in that morning’s
He was surprised Malfoy hadn’t noticed him. He was surprised everyone in the shop wasn’t side-eying him. Harry could feel his own awareness of Malfoy like a solid force in the air.
“But why bring attention to the compound at all by framing Poesy Potions for it, if that was your intent?” Shacklebolt asks patiently.
The feel of Malfoy’s body untensing around Harry’s fingers was so sweet. He wanted to do this all night, wanted to take Malfoy apart with nothing more than this.
Robards is done, Harry realizes. It isn’t just Harry he’s frustrated with. He’s got the energy of a tired, hungry old bear. Someone in the Ministry cares about this investigation, but it isn’t Robards, and Harry’s expected to sweep up the pieces and make something out of them.
Heather showed him how to enter orders, run the cards, and operate the cash drawer. Harry still didn’t know the names to half the drinks, but he thought he would try out his newly discovered “charm” and began to make random suggestions to the customers. Not all of them took the suggestion, but enough of them did—including some regulars with established orders—that Heather gave him an impressed look. Malfoy kept his own expression carefully neutral, but Harry could tell that he was impressed, too—though perhaps not as impressed when Harry took the liberty to bark drink orders at him. Then he looked tight-lipped and disgruntled. Harry liked that expression, and so he took the opportunity to snap several more orders at him.
Harry’s stomach sinks, and he is just retreating from the floo when a blond head appears over the top of the sofa. Malfoy cranes his neck. “Potter?”
opportunity to needle Potter, Draco put on his most airy voice and said, “If the Unspeakables were unable to help you, it’s unlikely my chances will be better. Whether or not I’m successful in my attempt to help you, this will take a significant amount of my time—not to mention supplies.”
Hills gives him a sharp look. Bate glares. And Harry can’t read Malfoy’s expression, but when Hills turns his gaze to Malfoy and says, “Do you authorize Auror Potter to supervise this search in your stead?” he nods.
“It’s not as bad as it could be,” she says, though. “But you’ve certainly set back your healing, and you’ve demonstrated that your body is still incapable of casting powerful spells.”
Malfoy didn’t seem to notice Harry watching. He gazed off toward the horizon. Then his gaze met Harry’s.
“I’ll get these, Harry. Don’t worry,” Luna said. He didn’t have it in him to argue that he didn’t mind and could use something to occupy him. Also, Luna had that kind look on her face, and so he couldn’t do anything but thank her and wander up to his room. That is, the
So began Malfoy’s next task for Harry: to Summon things as he called on them. Except Malfoy snapped the names so fast that Harry didn’t hear half of them correctly, so when he tried to Summon them, nothing came—or the wrong things zoomed happily into his waiting hand, and he had to levitate them back or Scourgify a mess he’d made while trying to keep up with Malfoy’s demands.
He drowned under piles of old accounting scrolls that included a detailed listing of every purchase made to stock the larder, and Harry Vanished those, as well, because he didn’t think anyone needed one hundred scrolls of “beef tongues: 3; sheep intestines: 1; goat heads: 2,” no matter what Hermione might have said about “history.”
Harry feels the impact down in the pores of his bones. The shield shudders. If Harry weren’t already on his hands and knees, the force would have felled him.
Ginny raised her eyebrows. “Intense? Demanding? Crowded into a small space with your childhood nemesis?”
He turned, though he knew he was already too late. He stumbled on the uneven surface, and suddenly the sharp rocks were rising toward him. Shouts went up behind him. He braced himself for impact, but then—a foot from the barnacle-crusted ground—he was caught as if by a giant invisible hand. Then Malfoy was hauling him up by the scruff of his shirt.
By the little bit of light in the hall, Harry can just make out the shape of a person—a man, by the height and shape. Sparks crackle through the air as the wizard draws back his wand. Harry doesn’t know what the person has planned, but he funnels his magic up into a powerful shield just as a different spell crackles over it.
To pace himself—and to not watch Malfoy’s thumb rub circles in the condensation on his beer glass as he talked. Harry couldn’t tear his eyes away.
She smiles. It’s tinged with a bit of emotion, more than her usual professional smile. Sadness, maybe. His heart clenches. But he knows. He already knows. He’s ready for the worst.
Hermione’s eyes refocus on Harry. She chews her lip. Seems to decide something. “I hate to say it, Harry, but I don’t like this.”
He glanced at the clock. He found himself as he’d been that morning: namely, wondering what to do with himself. He was tempted to dismiss the thought of accomplishing anything useful and settle down with a cup of tisane, maybe read a nice book. But he had at least an hour of sunlight left, and he ought to do something in the garden before it got dark. That, or he could—he really should—work on his mastery potion.
He keeps glancing at the clock and reminding himself that he doesn’t have anywhere to be. He’s quit. And he refuses to floo Malfoy. Not this early.
He cast a charm he’d learned as an Auror to repeat words—distinctly and clearly in his ears—as they were spoken. With this, and with the realization that Malfoy was pronouncing some things with a distinct American accent, Harry called the next thing Malfoy asked for: something called “shortening.” Harry cast the Summoning Charm so forcefully, the objects around the tub rattled as it flew from its spot, and it zoomed toward Harry. Harry snatched it from the air and smiled triumphantly at Malfoy.
Harry’s eyes focus. He realizes the book on his lap is upside down and has been the entire time. He clears his throat and lifts his gaze. Malfoy stands a few feet away, arms crossed, raising an eyebrow.
A little before lunch, Harry scrubs the dirt from his nails and pulls on a checked shirt and a pair of jeans, then floos Malfoy. The sitting room is dark and empty. This time no one appears to greet him, but Harry steps through anyway. He doesn’t bring any of the leftovers from last night because he doesn’t want Malfoy to read into that—whatever he would read from that.
It made perfect sense, then, and Harry poured his next latte perfectly. He shot a look at Malfoy. “Why didn’t you just say that?”
looking at him like he’s an idiot, and so he says, “Mind if I come over? Not—as an auror, or even to talk about the case, unless you want to. Not that I don’t care about it. I just.”
“This is an interesting surprise,” Malfoy said. He was dressed in a white linen shirt and dark blue jeans.
It was ridiculous and vaguely magical (except the taxidermy heads did not blink) and crowded with pedestrians—a shock to the system after the peace of Ginny and Luna’s farm.
of the muggle village if he was going to be subjected to regular house calls by its residents? Might as well purge his home of all magical objects, plants, and beasts.
One customer from the counter. Malfoy popped lids onto a line of drinks and handed them off to a tall man with a fleeting grin that was somewhere between friendly and smirking.
He stood for a while with Sirius’s chest of letters in his arms. He debated taking it downstairs and rifling through the rest of the letters. Not that he would read them. The thought discomfited him. They were too private for that, even if they did include mentions of his parents. But maybe they weren’t even all letters. And maybe he could ask Hermione about a spell to check for the presence of specific words. It wouldn’t be so invasive if he were just looking for mentions of Prongs and Lily. Sirius and Lupin wouldn’t have minded that, probably.
He spotted some witches and wizards in traditional robes, as well as people wearing dress from other countries, though the majority wore Muggle clothing—some more appropriately than others. Although, when he stepped through the barrier into the general Muggle section of the airport, he had to reevaluate that thought. Quite a few of the people coming from the Muggle airplane terminals wore some surprising articles of clothing in even more surprising combinations.
“Like this,” she said, pressed against him. “I thought it might be better to spread the hugs out, you see.”
He waited till he was in the potion lab with the door closed and locked—not like that would do any good, really—to slump against a table. “Fuck,” he whispered. His hands were shaking. He looked helplessly around the lab. Merlin. Where would he even start?
He set his bag on the bed. Hermione had helped him pack it. There weren’t a lot of things he’d brought with him—most of his material possessions had belonged to Grimmauld, so he’d left them—but he had enough that she’d set up an elaborate Undetectable Extension Charm on his luggage to contain it.
Hermione falls silent. He can feel her gaze on him. The energy in the room shifts, and he can tell it’s hit her that he’s cooking and what that must mean for his mood. He goes on to the next carrot.
He did. Malfoy signed it with an incomprehensible scrawl. Legally, that would do. The two other aurors stood by as witness, and the recording charms captured the action, too. There was no doubt Malfoy had given his willing consent.
Harry assumed he would sit next to Luna or Ginny, but they slid together into the booth opposite Malfoy. He hesitated, calculating the amount of space left on the seat next to Ginny.
The cider was sweet and tart, some kind of berry thing, or so he gathered from the picture on the label. “This is good,” he said. “What are you having?”
Harry braced himself for an acerbic retort from Malfoy—maybe a snap of his fingers and a reminder to “keep up”—but Malfoy only regarded him with a blank expression, as if he were preoccupied. He was leaning against the counter, drumming his fingers against its top. Maybe it was from all of the coffee; maybe it was excess energy from the lunch rush.
“Thanks, Luna.” With the food in his stomach, and some time to recover from the Portkey trip, he felt a little better, but the number of doors dizzied him right now.
Harry insisted on taking the full brunt. After all, he had been the acting authority in the situation. Two weeks’ suspension and a flaying by Robards, who was already trying to run an office that was overwhelmed and understaffed. This gave Harry a lot of time to sit at home and think about that night in the Ministry and how he’d misinterpreted Robards’ orders, which had been to
They landed behind the vegetable garden. Under Harry’s hands, Malfoy stumbled. Harry braced his hips, steadying him.
The air here was cool and slightly stuffy and smelled of books. Harry wondered if Hermione had visited when she’d come. The enchanted ceiling showed a black night sky and ribbons of colored light—an aurora.
Malfoy smiles. It’s a different sort of smile than Harry has seen on his face before. Just for a moment. Then it twists into its more usual smirk, and Malfoy says, “Remember to eat tonight.”
“You should show him the beauty micrometer, Draco. Harry, you haven’t seen one of these before, have you? Daddy couldn’t believe it when he saw it.”
The feel of pressure inside of him persisted, but Malfoy’s bedroom blurred. Harry clung to the feeling of Malfoy’s hand against his thigh.
remedies to the muggles, but that was hardly Potter’s business, anyway. He finished with a grand, “I always knew you were dense.”
An alarming frisson of pleasure shot through him. He gasped. “Shit. I’m gonna come.” He lifted his hand to touch his cock, then remembered himself and flung it back down.
Harry gathers himself up. “I could share my memories with you of the last couple of weeks. Help fill in the gaps.”
“I mean, the archive department knows. Alex was in my office, but he didn’t seem to notice the files on my desk, and it’s not like he’d know what they are, anyway.”
“Er, no. But I’ve only had chicken eggs, and they just taste like eggs to me. And doesn’t chicken taste like everything?”
Malfoy ran a hand through his hair. He had creases at the edges of his eyes, and his cheeks were tinged pink.
Most painful of all was the fact that he still desired Malfoy. Even now, despite the invasion, longing clawed at him. His walls were down, nothing to contain it. It burned in his body along with the shame, all mixed together so they became the same thing.
So, Robards suspects something. Or he doesn’t trust Harry, either because he thinks Harry is up to something with the Malfoy case or because he doesn’t have faith in Harry’s faculties. Whatever the reason, there’s nothing for it now: Hills and Bate will be reporting back on Harry’s presence at Malfoy’s. It didn’t escape Harry’s notice how Hills shortened the search and muzzled Bate. He’s sure he saw sympathy in the older man’s expression, and Harry dares to think he might find an unexpected ally in him. But that doesn’t change the fact that he’s bound to include Harry in the write-up.
what Malfoy is going to ask, or at least he thinks he does, and the idea of answering truthfully makes him want to puke; the idea of answering
“No…” Harry stared down at the letters, dazed. It was obviously a completely different set, but Harry could have been kneeling in the attic again, unfolding Lupin’s letter.
The bus arrived in a billow of heat, and its doors hissed open. Harry climbed up behind Malfoy and fumbled at the pay machine for his card, only for the bus driver to tell him, “Your friend already paid.”
Harry wakes with a jerk. He is sitting up, his neck stiff. He’s not in his bed; he’s in a chair in a room lit green. The light flares, the bright hue of the killing curse.
“That’s it. I’m not sending you through the floo like this. You’d just pitch onto your head on the other side. You’d fall down your own stairs. For Merlin’s sake, you’d go into your kitchen for a cup of tea and set the whole place on fire. Who knows.”
The problem was that neither of them had any idea how to make a popup book, magical or muggle. They enlisted Luna’s help and soon had several prototypes. Those helped, though making the actual book had still been a learning curve; the quality from the beginning to the end of the book differed noticeably. Thankfully, Harry doubted Teddy would care—or even notice. He had an eight-year-old’s delight for all things fun and colorful and enchanted.
Ron comes in a few minutes later, and Harry meets his wide-eyed gaze with his own as he cradles a sobbing Hermione against his chest. Ron raises both eyebrows in a look of,
Minister Shacklebolt recovers first. “Mr. Potter. What fortunate timing you have. Please sit. This does concern you.”
He gazed out of the window at the dormant south garden and the rocky grassland beyond. A fine rain fell. The clouds hung low and grey, but a trick of the late-winter light had the pink blossoms of the plum tree glowing as if with their own illumination. It was Draco’s least favorite time of year—endlessly rainy, lingeringly cold, grey as a pewter cauldron, and damp in a way that seeped into one’s skin—but it had its moments of odd beauty.
It had been years since he’d seen Parkinson. She and Malfoy were turned towards each other with wide smiles, and Harry’s stomach jumped again, but not in a pleasant way this time. Because—Harry didn’t like that smile. It wasn’t the same smile he’d become fond of over the last couple of weeks. It reminded him of a time he would rather forget.
The waiter held out his hand, and Malfoy handed over the menu. He hadn’t even looked at it. “Mushroom risotto with the rosemary chicken breast,” he said, smoothly.
When she steps up next to him and leans against the counter, she comes quietly. She doesn’t say anything else, just watches him chop.
Thankfully, once they’d accepted that he wouldn’t allow them to assault his roses any longer, they picked their way towards Rosemary and Heather’s land without much more trouble.
Earlier that evening, Harry had invited Ron and Hermione over. Since Hermione was busy, Ron came over himself. He brought a Chinese takeaway and a treacle tart from Molly. A sense of déjà vu gripped Harry.
Ginny and Luna. Merlin. It’d been years since he’d seen them. He still remembered hugging them goodbye before they left for the US.
Maybe because he was so tired, and maybe because he had spent so much time in their kitchen the last few days, he felt as if he’d slipped into a pleasant time continuum in which Luna and Ginny were forever stepping around each other in the kitchen, a bit like a dance, chatting and trading casual kisses and fond looks.
“That’s all right. Mine isn’t the best, either. I’m a brewer, not a brewer. We’ve got a Potions master for the formulations. Samantha. All we need to do is add the special ingredients at the times and temperatures she tells us, which isn’t unlike non-magical beer brewing. Our beers don’t fall under the division for regulated potions, so we don’t have to be licensed the same way as potions breweries. This gives us a little more freedom in some ways, although it limits our scope so we don’t cross the line.”
“Up, Harry,” she said, fists on her hips, and he could only blink and gawp as she clenched his wrist, all but hauling him into the kitchen.
The fields gave way to buildings, and they entered a more densely populated area. They passed shopping plazas and office buildings and signs for petrol stations and restaurants.
“They use some kind of special hops variety for this one,” Harry said. “Less bitter. Kind of piney.”
“At least let me in so I’m not standing here like a knob,” Harry said. He gave the door an experimental nudge with his foot. It moved slightly. Harry pushed it open and squeezed past Malfoy, who looked surprised, then consternated.
He’s all the way back to the DMLE before he realizes he’s still holding the smile on his face, now a taut rictus. One of the secretaries glances at him uneasily, and he drops it.
The conversation rambled after that. They discussed other plants on the farm (including the onions, which were in flower), Luna’s latest experiments in spicy pickles, Ginny and Harry’s thoughts on the most recent bunch of Quidditch students, and the health of the farm’s creatures.
They all tucked in, and the waitress returned with the pint of IPA, and Ginny only smirked at him this time after the waitress had turned away instead of saying something that could be overheard, and Harry only rolled his eyes in response.
“Package delivery sounds nice,” Ginny said with a completely straight face. “You’d have to learn how to drive, though, Harry.”
Maybe because he wanted to maintain the dream, he packed his bag with clothes and toiletries for a few days. Then—because of course it was a dream, and he didn’t want to embarrass himself—he left it on the bed when he went downstairs for breakfast.
A few minutes later, Heather brought him a brulee coffee, a bowl of mushroom soup, and a cheese scone.
For an instant, Harry thought it was part of the occlumency, part of Malfoy’s defenses. Then the feeling pulsed and congealed, like an explosion in reverse—and this wasn’t a defense, this was a memory.
He moved around the kitchen, preparing soup and a slice of cheese from the wheel Heather had given him earlier. When he reached for bread to go with the cheese, he remembered he was out and grimaced.
They dozed for a time, Harry drifting in a pleasant space between dream and waking, until Malfoy’s wand alarm buzzed and sent up sparks. They showered separately, and dressed and packed in silence. Malfoy settled the bill. Harry wasn’t sure of the etiquette in this case, but he vowed to pay for the meals for the day.
“What? I haven’t— I haven’t seen you in six years, and I figured—I don’t even know what you’ve been up to.”
His gaze met Harry’s. He abruptly ceased struggling. Blood from a split lip smeared his cheek. His black robes were torn at the collar and splattered with grey, as if by a spray of bleach. The regal mouth was frozen in a half snarl, half frown. The eyebrows were drawn together in a way that almost looked startled. But the grey irises were cutting.
The smile on Malfoy’s face is hard and mocking, but seemingly directed at himself. “Trying to publish my research.”
She completes her set of diagnostics and performs a complicated charm that eases his lungs. He takes a deep, relieved breath.
He unfolded from his place at the desk. Standing, he came up to Harry’s shoulder. He looked like he fit perfectly in the cramped confines of the hat shop, as if it had grown around him, or he had shrunk to fit it. Harry, however, felt oversized and cramped. He wondered if this was how Hagrid always felt.
While Draco spoke, he cast a quick look around the garden, but he saw no other glimpse of white-furred movement.
“No,” Malfoy breathed, in disbelief. He’d followed Harry inside, and the sound of his voice so close sent shivers over Harry.
Harry huffed and took the spot next to him. The seat was squashy and sent up smells of antique wood and beer as Harry sat down.
didn’t quite know. A small struggling spark of anger tried to catch in his chest, but it quickly went out. Harry hadn’t known because he’d never asked. Never visited. And Draco Malfoy had. He didn’t know how he felt about that. He wanted to feel resentment, but instead felt guilty because Malfoy had apparently been helping Luna and Ginny—and Harry had not.
He rolled over and stood. He felt strangely heavy, strangely light—as if he were half made of wind. He didn’t care that he hadn’t won the game. He
The air in the kitchen was motionless and smelled vaguely of recently-Transfigured wood and their meal. It sounded like the clink of forks on porcelain and Ron chewing.
Besides the roses, the garden lacked much color. Maybe Molly could help him choose something to plant along the paths, now that you could see them. That would be nice.
For the first time, Harry can see the full headline and the large picture beneath it. The photo features Harry looking unblinking and tight-lipped straight into the camera.
The letters were all nestled inside, as if a month hadn’t passed. Harry ran a finger along them. Pulled one out at random.
things about having grown up fighting a snake-faced Dark wizard and then spending the last decade running after yet more Dark wizards was that it put everything else in perspective. Few things seemed so bad compared to all that.
Just beyond view, the surf pounded against the rocks. Water sloshed against the sides of Thor’s Well. Every so often, an especially strong surge burst into the air.
Luna shook her head. “No, it wouldn’t be best. We need a number of people to take them down and put them back up again safely. I’d rather not risk a fire.”
“Chicken casserole,” Harry said, not looking at Malfoy, marching to the kitchen counter to deposit the dish in its stasis charm. “I forget to eat when I’m under stress, so I thought—” He shrugged. He didn’t add that he tended to cook when he was stressed about other people. Malfoy was probably worried enough on his own without Harry’s helping on top of it.
They passed lavish displays and floating platforms that carried people to the higher shelves of the floor-to-ceiling bookcases. There was a caged-off area for the “Books That Bite — enter at your own risk” and a special room for old, cursed volumes with “tours and viewings by appointment only.”
With Malfoy, it wasn’t hard at all. Even though Malfoy had asked, even though he’d given permission, Harry expected resistance—there was always resistance—but Malfoy was waiting for him, and he slipped inside as though through an open door.
Harry could feel an apology lodged deep inside of him, but the words wouldn’t come out. It wasn’t the right time. It wasn’t what Malfoy needed right now.
“All right, then,” he said, and went to fetch a piece of fine parchment, the kind used for official documents.
Soon, Harry was decorating the drinks with finesse and calling out orders while placing them on the pick-up counter as if he’d been working behind the counter for weeks.
A few moments later, Potter shifted restlessly and added, “And I, er, don’t have any other bodily needs.”
“Magical,” Malfoy corrected automatically, a bit like Luna, but snootier. “They’re magical establishments, yes. Or friendly to them. This shop is owned by a Noble—a Squib. There’s another down the street owned by a non-magical family member of a magical.”
They took the stairs back up to street level, passing window box planters and individually-painted bricks and a calico cat that stared out at them from a bedroom.
surprised.” She stepped forward to take Harry’s hand, and—like earlier—threaded her fingers between his. He looked down at their hands.
He brought it out to the table overlooking the garden. A breeze stirred up, bringing smells of rosemary and flowers, and he breathed in deep, trying to clear his head.
“It’s fantastic!” With a few fluid waves of her wand, she cleared the stacks of books, revealing floor space and a rickety chair next to her own. “Would you like to sit down?”
“You’ve got to be kidding me,” he groaned. He flopped back in bed and stared up at the ceiling. Malfoy could have
“The first thing to know about Portland is that, to fully experience it, you have to take public transportation.”
Downstairs, the back door was open to the patio. Voices drifted in from outside. A spell to keep bugs and wildlife from entering the house shimmered in the threshold, and it prickled Harry’s skin as he walked through. Harry braced himself to see Malfoy, but only Ginny and Luna sat there, each with a glass of pale green liquid and the remnants of blackberry pie.
He said, “I like it here.” In the daydream, in Malfoy’s living room, Malfoy’s hands in his. “I’d like to stay.”
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “Shopping for a hat. Imagine my shock coming for a beret and finding you.”
Harry returns to Malfoy’s cottage that afternoon with Hermione. The scene is dizzily familiar. There is tea, this time set on a larger table with enough room for all of them and a tray of little sandwiches, a tureen of mushroom bisque, a bowl of salad. Malfoy is stiffly formal, Hermione’s eyes guarded. But they shake hands politely enough, and Hermione accepts Malfoy’s invitation to sit.
Hugging her gave him an unexpected warm feeling and made his eyes burn inexplicably. For a long moment, he didn’t know what to say, just returned her embrace, neither of them moving.
After the tour, and another mug of scorched coffee, Sophie showed Harry how to make hats. His voice settled into a lecturing cadence that was not quite a Binns-level drone, but—paired with his yawning—it had
Harry bites the corner of his mouth. It’s not like he’s trying to hide this…“something.” Hermione already knows; well, if she didn’t before, he’s sure she does after this evening. It’s just that this thing between him and Draco simply…is. He can’t define it yet. Maybe he feels a bit like it’ll shatter if he tries to hold it too hard.
And that was how he’d found himself following after her across the crunchy grass to the broomshed, the air still cool, the sun slanting at a sharp angle and glinting off the tops of longer grass.
Harry remembers his manners. He says, “Thanks for tea. And supper. And breakfast this morning. And, er—”
Harry calmed his voice. “It belonged to my godfather. Sirius.” His throat was suddenly tight. “He left it to me.”
Then Malfoy seemed to remember that he and Harry were meant to help with the lunch rush, and they returned to the front of the shop.
No, it wasn’t competence alone that made the master. It was the deep understanding, the creativity and courage to experiment, the commitment to advancing the art and science of potion-making.
Merlin. Harry remembered the lube. He squeezed some onto his hands, which were surprisingly steady. Harry did not feel steady.
He thought they would stop to eat at the stone and wooden bench outside the ice cream shop, but Malfoy took him to the car park around the side of the shop and stepped behind a van. Harry licked a trail of melting ice cream from the side of his cone and watched as Malfoy murmured a couple of charms at his own. It looked like a Stasis Charm and something that glimmered like a Shield Charm. Done with this, he tucked the cone into his bag. Then he reached for Harry’s.
“So you came here with Pansy, who came with Luna and Ginny—I won’t ask, it’s not my business”—actually, he thought he might ask Luna later—“and decided to open a coffee shop.”
Harry says, “He’s a researcher. He’s been looking into the effects of the byproducts they dump into the water supply. Seems they might turn magical babies into squibs.”
“I shouldn’t be.” He couldn’t keep the taste of bitterness from his tone. “Just. I thought we were getting along pretty well—really well for someone who didn’t ever want to see me. Not that I ever wanted to see him again.” Not until Harry had met him again, had got to know him.
“It most certainly is,” Malfoy said, and reached forward to pluck both glasses from Harry’s hands. (His own glass was empty now, Harry noticed.) He set each glass into its spot on the block and then picked up the next. “Here. A hefeweizen. Something you’d be more used to.”
“So I’m going to put you to work.” He clapped his hands. “Chop-chop. Eat up. And drink your coffee. You’ll need it. Lunch rush soon.”
Harry grimaced. He told Ron about how some of the weatherproofing charms had apparently failed years ago, how the walls and floor were crumbling with dry rot in places. The wallpaper needed to be pulled, the walls painted. Old Doxy nests needed to be cleared out of the draperies. A cursed window that always let in a cold wind, even on still, sunny days. Rugs that needed to be removed. Stains that looked suspiciously like blood.
Draco smoothed his hand over the page. “You’re staring. Don’t think I can’t see you.” He looked up, expression tender, sardonic. “If you’re done drinking in the sight of me, fetch the projector.”
“Hey. I’m Harry. Harry Potter? Luna called and asked if I could, er, help you around the shop today?”
In his pocket, his hand closed around one of the little agates Malfoy had given him on the hidden beach. He’d found it earlier in the bathroom of the guest bedroom—his bedroom—where he must have left it on the edge of the sink. The feel of the smooth stone came with the memory of Malfoy pressing it into his palm.
Harry hesitated. He knew he was nervous because his mouth was dry. His occlumency walls had been shattered since the night with Malfoy. He took a moment to reinforce them, but then, that wasn’t the point here, was it.
The sheets moved as Malfoy shifted his legs beneath them. His hips bucked. The tendons in his arm stood out under Harry’s grip, but this time, he wasn’t trying to pull away.
Malfoy’s friend—and because Harry was starting to understand that. Instead, Malfoy’s words filled Harry with something more baffling: a soft longing. But for what, Harry wasn’t sure.
But he lets his hands go and steps back, crossing his arms. His expression clouds with a shrewd look. A corner of his mouth quirks up, cool and cruel. “Just what wasn’t I supposed to see, Potter?”
In his tipsy state, Harry was so thankful for the intervention that he leaned forward to kiss her cheek, which caused Ginny to shriek and Luna to demand her girlfriend back. Luna was laughing while she shouted, but she did sound a bit serious about it.
. Merlin. Not like Draco had any chance of figuring out a potion to help Potter, as it was. So it would be good if Potter disappeared on him. Anyway, if what Potter said was correct, then what he needed was probably some combination of spellwork and potion, which was out of Draco’s expertise.
about it—mouthy and smug, a little bit of a show-off, with bursts of aggressive energy—but also: surprisingly tender. Caressing Harry’s sides, pressing kisses down his spine, even as he fucked Harry wide open and told him how he wasn’t going to stop until Harry begged.
Malfoy’s eyes narrowed as if he were attempting to identify an insult in Harry’s words—though Harry was being sincere, so wished him luck with that.
Not that he thought he could get any sleep. What he wanted to do was go for a fly, but he was too drunk for that. Luna probably did have a Sobering Potion sitting around, if he asked. But then, he didn’t want to be sober right now. He didn’t know if it would make the image of Malfoy and Parkinson laughing together better or worse in his mind. He didn’t know if being sober would make the idea of going back to England better or worse.
The milkmaid above the hearth eyes him mildly, hands folded on her lap. The cow behind her kicks one leg into the straw. There is a lingering scent of something fruity and sweet in the air.
He stopped in the doorway of the herbal room. The smell here was quite different from that of the lab, sweet and tangy without the slight, discomfiting hint of putrefying flesh and singed hair. Was that why he enjoyed crafting muggle medicine? It was so much more pleasant to the senses than brewing draughts. Certainly, the work here was far easier on the eyes. Sunlight flooded the space. Who’d decided that all potion labs must be windowless, in any case?
As he points his wand at his temple, Harry experiences a strange double vision. It’s as if he stands outside of himself, watching as he draws the memory out, the way he once watched Dumbledore. The memory tickles from above his ear. With a careful movement, he sends the silvery wisp into the pensieve.
Which is when Harry remembered why he hated him. Would hexing a non-magical break the Statue if the non-magical didn’t know what had hit him?
“How long have you fantasized about taking my cock up your arse? Did you dream of me holding you down and fucking you fast? Or slow?” Here, Harry sped up briefly and then slowed nearly to a stop, and Malfoy groaned.
Ginny opened her mouth to reply, then paused, and a strange expression came over her face. She thumped her chest, frowned, and let out a loud burp and three pink bubbles.
Harry isn’t. But Ron looks like death warmed over, and he’s off to work. And what he needs isn’t a pain potion or water. What he needs is to talk to Hermione.
Potter scowled. “I spent two months with them. As you can see, that was pointless.” He spread his arms.
Harry had lost his command of language completely, but that was fine because Malfoy didn’t seem to expect a reply. He groped for his wand and murmured Cleaning Charms over both of them, then flopped down next to Harry.
“They emit some kind of magical resonance that we can’t sense, but it drives the fairies bonkers. You’d have to ask Dad for the full version, but get ready for an hour-long lecture. We’ve got”—she patted the bags—“several of these because you need as many people as possible. The fairies hop into another mound to escape, but we don’t want them hopping into another mound—we want them to move to another field, preferably not one of ours—so you can’t leave any unattended. Here’s how you set it up.”
He pulled out his legal pad, the one with the notes about the repairs needed at Grimmauld. Before Apparating into the city, he’d dug it out of his bag from where it was hiding beneath a few pairs of forgotten pants and socks.
It’s a shock to see it now. Harry’s spent a happy decade—longer—without thinking about Malfoy. And he could joyfully go the rest of his life without thinking about him, too.
They ate mostly in silence—Harry tense and confused and a little embarrassed at his worry for Malfoy and his impulsive need to provide him food, Malfoy thoughtful and remote, eating his serving in small, measured bites.
Since Thor’s Well, Malfoy’s hair had been wispy and impossibly soft, floating around in the wind. Harry knew his own hair was extra messy. Drying Charms always did that. Even if Harry hadn’t already known that, he would have suspected something was up from the way Malfoy repeatedly glanced at him, mouth tightening as if Harry’s hair offended him. Harry tried not to smile.
Harry’s gone hot around the neck and he knows he’s coloring. His magic has gathered under his skin like lightning ready to crack.
“I’m all right.” Better, now that he’d found her. He’d woken feeling out of sorts, only to find the house filled with light and with dappled, shifting leaf shadows—but empty. “What are you reading?”
Draco raised his gaze. Over the old man’s shoulder, he caught sight of the venomous tentacula’s spiny arms waving in the air. His eyes widened, then he quickly schooled his expression.
The truth is, a part of him regrets the decision. Sometimes, in his darker moments, he thinks he ought to have let the curse hit Alex as intended, or at least tried the shield charm. Then he immediately feels guilty and pulls back the thought. But it always lives there, lodged beneath his heart, like something small and flat and hard-shelled that lives beneath a rock. It’s not like ending up in a desk job would have hurt Alex in the long run. It would have got him out of the field; it would have been better for his family. And Harry could still be out there, doing the one thing he’s good at. The one thing he’s useful at.
Harry did, and Luna told him everything she had learned from the book while he tried his best to follow her words. Their rhythm kept pulling him in; Luna was soothing to listen to, and the more he relaxed, the more he missed what she was actually saying. It had something to do with the sick tree, the one she had been trying to heal since he’d arrived.
Ginny took the teapot and a couple of cups and the cheesecake and Harry out to a little table in the shade of the garden. The flowers looked motionless, but if Harry stared at them for a few seconds, he saw the bees that rose from them and flew around each other to land in the next flower. They reminded him of Ginny and Luna in the kitchen.
Malfoy returned with a small tray. He placed a steaming mug on the little side table next to Harry, along with a plate of shortbread biscuits, then sat down with his own.
Technically Harry was done with his morning egg collection round, but the truth was, it was never over at the farm. He was cleaning the remnants of a late breakfast from the patio table when he spotted a little pink egg in a plant pot.
was going to happen had spread to his elbow joints, his chest, and the corners of his jaw. He stopped in the middle of the dim space and shook himself.
Bemused, Harry nodded. Malfoy went away. Clean bright sunlight filled the space. The decorative moulding was almost invisible against the white of the wall in the bright light. It was a newer building, but made to look older, a pretentiousness that fit Malfoy.
With the city behind them, the countryside spread out for miles on either side of the road, with mountains in the distance to either side, including one tall peak streaked with white.
questioned what the Ministry is accusing Malfoy of, but he pushed forward with the investigation anyway.
“Yes. All right. I’m going to grab a few references and see if we can’t begin to identify what kind of potion they used on you.”
There was a short scuffle on the other side of the screen, though Harry almost wondered if he imagined it because Hermione never looked away from the camera. Her face expression briefly pinched. Then she said, “You know? Never mind. You’re on holiday. You can show us when you get home. Speaking of which, do you need us to meet you at the Portkey office? You shouldn’t Apparate after a big jump like that.”
She showed him how to turn the Emitter on and calibrate it. She also showed him how to seal the fairy mounds with an incantation, which needed to be done as soon the fairies had left them.
Malfoy is looking at him with an odd expression. His eyes drop briefly to Harry’s hand on his cheek, so fast that maybe Harry imagined it. Then Malfoy’s face folds into the familiar mask of contempt. “You’re as stubborn as you are impulsive, aren’t you?”
Harry looked up from the flowers. “Did you feel in competition with me? What do you mean, you don’t need to boost her ego?”
“Oh!” Harry said, stopping in the threshold. He’d spotted the big bed against the far wall, and a familiar citrusy smell hung in the air. This was Malfoy’s bedroom.
Anyway. The privacy of the interrogation room was an illusion. Williams and Chesterfield would be watching every twitch they made from the other side of a charmed one-way wall.
There was no time to think of anything. The fairies circled back around in a huge swarm, wings glinting hard and bright in the sunlight, and Malfoy shot another spell at them. Malfoy then closed the last of the green-tagged mounds in quick succession. When he was done with that, he began to help Harry with the blue mounds.
“There he is!” Ginny said. She turned in her seat, grinning, and gave his rumpled form a leering once-over.
Malfoy sneers. “What? Holding hands? Singing songs? No, I don’t. And I think I rather prefer that. Much as you loathe someone
“Really, Harry,” Malfoy said, his eyes bright, cheeks flushed. “It’s like living in a mausoleum. A crypt. An above-ground catacomb.”
“Yes, Potter. My coffeehouse, my rules. Also, it’s standard coffee shop etiquette here. Not that I should expect you to understand the concept.”
A bubble of incredulous laughter threatens to well out of Harry. He struggles to hold it in and thinks he does a good job of it, except that Hermione casts him a disapproving glance. He wrestles his mouth into a frown and looks straight ahead at Malfoy as the man pours three cups of tea. Harry doesn’t know what’s wrong with himself, why he suddenly feels hysterical while sitting here with his previous nemesis and his longtime best friend. Probably it’s the civility of the entire affair. The
he’d closed the cages last night. And he was certain that if he checked on the cages now, he’d find them all locked.
go through my house without my permission, which you do not have. When I get back, I’ll…deal with you then.”
Maybe he’d make it into a library, then. But really, it didn’t bear thinking about yet. He still had three months.
Harry smiled. He kept half an eye on the menu and half on Malfoy and the way he occasionally reached up to brush his hair out of his eyes or fidget with his water glass. The fact of the matter was, he’d found Malfoy’s ranting in the car incredibly amusing, and a little bit of a turn on. Harry had wanted to lean over and kiss Malfoy’s frowning mouth more than once, which very well
“You aren’t sure what you want to do now that you’ve left the Aurors, are you? And it will be difficult for you to know, really, unless you see some of what’s possible. So you should see what it’s like to work different jobs.”
Instead, those unwavering eyes blink, and then one shoulder lifts in a shrug. “I don’t know. Volunteering for the job, Potter?”
Harry surged forward, every nerve alight, because he recognized that voice, even without the clipped consonants and condescending drawl.
The letter is dated for nearly a year ago. He recognizes what it is now. It’s a request for access to records under the Freedom of Information Act. Harry has seen requests like this before. It’s not uncommon for the Ministry to request access to information held by universities and other organizations. But this request includes months’ worth of Malfoy’s correspondences—any that were written using the university letterhead or made via the university office floo—not to mention a staggering list of academic documents regarding potions manufacture.
He and Malfoy stepped into a cavernous space whose ceiling stretched much higher than the floor of the bookshop above. It brought Harry memories of Flourish and Blotts, though Flourish and Blotts had never been so
She huffs a laugh. “My professional opinion, Mr. Potter, is that the mind, once tampered with, is never the same. Imagine rummaging through a room. Taking items out. Putting them back in. You can return them all, but inevitably, you won’t get them all back where they belonged. And some things will be forgotten. For all intents lost.” She takes his hand, gazes into his eyes with her kind ones. “But Harry, healing is always improving, and I am constantly amazed at what can be accomplished if one has the will. Just look at what Hermione accomplished with her parents.”
Malfoy stared. Then scoffed. “What, you think you’ll just balance things out by offering me to do legilimency on you? Besides the fact that it’s an utterly rubbish idea, it’s beside the point. I didn’t have a choice.”
In the end, Malfoy wins by a landslide. He twirls his hand, and the burnt remains of the cards gather and reassemble into a whole deck.
been comforted by his own friends and adopted family. All the while, Malfoy was probably laughing at him.
“So, what do you actually plan to do when you get back? I don’t suppose you’re honestly interested in taking up hat-selling.”
“Mmm,” Malfoy hummed. His hand brushed over Harry’s side—Harry shivered from the touch—and traveled down, over his balls, to his cock. “Wow. You’re really hard for it.”
Harry listened hard. Occasionally he ran into foreign wizards and witches. He knew enough of French, Russian, Italian, and a few other languages to at least recognize which translation charm he needed. But he shook his head at this.
“Is that man having his ass eaten out by the other fine gentleman there? Yes. He is. Why, Potter. You’re
They stepped out into the wind. Far below, people walked over a landscape of rocks to a place where, every so often, a plume of sea spray shot from a hole in the rocks and was carried sideways by the wind. It looked just like Malfoy’s art, but in motion. A number of people stood perilously close to the hole’s jagged edge, holding up their phones. There were no walls, no railing to separate them from the gaping maw in the rock and the water frothing furiously up through it. It was the kind of casual disregard for danger that Harry expected from wizards, not people without magic.
“Yes! It’s been a dry summer. Would you like to help Ginny and me levitate her a little later? We do that sometimes. So she can feel like she’s flying. She’ll water the fields for us. But maybe you’d like a nap first.”
All Harry knew was, he’d already suffered for forcing himself into Malfoy’s memories. Viewing them had been punishment enough; now he’d paid with his humiliation. So what did Malfoy want from him?
“Hey.” He ran a hand through his hair. Despite the Sobering Potion he’d taken the night before, he’d still woken with a bit of a headache and a case of dry mouth, and everything was blurred around the edges. “How have things been?”
“Yes, thank you, Draco. So good to spend time with you today. It’s always nice having you for the whole day.” She pressed a light kiss to Malfoy’s cheek. “Good night, Harry.”
Harry wasn’t sure how to respond. This was so unlike the Malfoy he remembered. A few days ago, he would have said something cutting in reply. Who was
Potter looked at the wheelbarrow of soil and at Draco’s grubby hand. His eyebrows rose. “That’s a sight I never thought I’d see.”
Harry’s gaze traveled down. He noticed the silvery marks criss-crossing Malfoy’s chest. The sight sent a stab of alarm through him, then another when he realized they were scars—and a wash of cold when he realized what had caused them. Who.
coffee, rich and almost chocolatey. Harry would have to stand a little closer to cast the Fitting Charm. He hoped Malfoy would say no. He wanted Malfoy to say yes.
“I knew it the moment you showed me those letters. I just— It was easier to think you hadn’t changed. But you have, haven’t you? The research and the charities—”
“Have you read it?” Hermione says, opening the newspaper. “Poesy Potions and the Ministry both declined to comment. The trolls!”
Harry’s face heated. “Merlin, Malfoy. And you were asking me what I do to books when no one’s looking?”
Harry felt restless as he waited for his order. After a few minutes, most of the cats dispersed. They gamboled around, passing in and out of frames. It reminded him unpleasantly of Umbridge’s office without the pink.
There is Malfoy, mouth set, eyes flashing in a way that is entirely distracting, especially now without the immediate anger drowning out Harry’s other emotions. But he doesn’t let himself dwell on that. There are the letters—and it is embarrassingly obvious now how twitchy Harry was, how quickly he grabbed his wand when Malfoy whirled, how nonthreatening the packet of letters was, quivering in Malfoy’s hand.
Harry didn’t tell Malfoy that, whatever expression was on his face, it had nothing to do with criticizing Malfoy’s idea to cast the lights. He shook his head to clear it. “No. That’s a brilliant idea,” he said, and cast his own ball of light. It was pale golden in color and rose to circle around Malfoy’s before drifting in another direction.
Ginny’s words from earlier about his “big gay awakening” came back to him, and he nearly groaned aloud.
Harry sets down his cup. He tells Hermione everything from the beginning, starting with Robards calling him into the office and Harry’s excitement at getting the case, which was quickly banked when he saw Malfoy’s name. The nature of the case—
Harry was acutely aware of Malfoy next to him. He couldn’t remember ever being so close when they weren’t in a fight. Malfoy, however, appeared not to notice him.
“Luna and Ginny showed me this spot the first time we came to the coast. I like to come here sometimes and look for stones.” Malfoy was looking down at the ground as he said it, but Harry got the impression that he wasn’t really seeing it.
Harry almost said, and then remembered that he was supposed to be friendly toward Malfoy, so instead, he said, “You must.”
The house was just the way it had been when Harry left: doors and windows open, quiet—a gently-breathing stillness. Wind chimes made music in the afternoon. A scrub jay shrieked twice from a rock.
Her face appeared above the books. “Oh, hullo, Harry! I didn’t hear you come in. How are you this morning?”
Bolder now, Harry turned his body in order to face Malfoy fully. “What do you want, then? What’s enough for you? Want the rest of them? Like to see how I imagined you fucking me?”
“Pretending you don’t exist to preserve my sanity, while asking myself what in Salazar’s name I was thinking yesterday, and wondering if I’m not still in some extended and particularly vivid nightmare.”
One eyebrow rose to a peak. “What? Have you never tried?” His voice dropped to a murmur. “It feels really good.”
Those two words were so completely American, the crisp vowels Harry expected to hear lengthened, the sharp consonants softened, they sounded like someone else spoke them. He glanced at the board again. “Ham sandwich?”
They brought their motley collection of scrolls and journals to the table to add to the books already there, and Malfoy sorted the materials into small piles that appeared to make sense to him. Harry was reminded again of Hermione, but it was so uniquely
Draco met his gaze calmly, though his mouth had gone dry. “All right then, Potter. No need to pop a nonexistent blood vessel.” And because
Breakfast rush over, Malfoy returned to his post at the window. He scooped flour and other powdery ingredients from tubs, measured out liquids. Watching Malfoy’s back as he worked reminded Harry vaguely of Potions class, though Malfoy had never moved quite so swiftly or with such long movements. In Potions, you tended to move carefully if you didn’t want to toss ingredients into someone else’s cauldron—or knock it over. But this was as if Malfoy had taken all of his efficiency and set it free.
to waterproof his clothes, but if he arrived in town as dry as a dementor’s breath, people would start asking questions.
“So help me,” Draco muttered. His mind spun for a moment before he thought to call up a recording spell. To Potter, he said, “Do I have your verbal agreement to the terms of this contract, which are subject to change?”
And with that, the flames flash back to orange. Harry leans his shoulder against the fireplace wall, probably too close to the fire, but he can’t bring himself to move away.
Malfoy hadn’t asked him like this before. It was…nice. It was mad, but. But nice. Especially with the way Malfoy was looking at him, eyes dark, focused on him.
When he returned to the kitchen, his heart gave a little leap of shock to find Potter sitting where Draco had left him. Maybe a part of him had been hoping he’d been hallucinating Potter’s visit; or maybe it was because he caught a glimpse of the space between Potter’s bottom and the chair, and the rose-pattern teapot through Potter’s head.
In the dark of the night, the events of the day replay themselves. Hills and Bate, Malfoy’s anxious expression, Robards’ outrage,
“Are you— First of all, never do that again. You’re going to get us into an accident! Second: didn’t you
Harry glances heavenward. “I’m tired, Malfoy. Now you know what went on.” A thought occurs to him. “How is your house being secured?”
have bought that when I was twelve, Potter. Do you mean to insult my intelligence, or does it just come naturally?”
Harry didn’t realize the situation he was in until a whirring, fluttering wall of fairies had completely enclosed him. The Shield Charm spat and sparked. The pressure of his own magic squeezed around him. He felt a moment of panic as the air buzzed in his throat as if electrified.
The pale lips tug into a smirk. “It’s all right that you don’t resent me. That you cook me food and stay up all night with worry. Will you stay up all night, worrying about me all alone at the manor?”
“Oh, fuck off,” Harry says, but there isn’t much heat in his voice. He’s had time to think about the entire incident. Too much time. And he’s heard possibly every version of chastisement and rant. “He has a wife and a newborn son.”
Malfoy glances at him with a twitch of his mouth. “No one, except for the important people in the room.”
Harry stared. “What? Did you think you’d find a secret tally of your faults? That I wanked in the shower to thoughts of cutting you apart?”
Luna gave him a smile, pushed between one extravagant fur coat and an orange knit jumper, and disappeared inside. A moment later, her voice drifted out to him, muffled and as if from a distance: “Come on, Harry. It’s like Platform 9 & 3/4.”
A small twist at the corner of Malfoy’s sardonic mouth. He murmurs, “Anything that isn’t foie gras and truffles is plebeian, Potter.”
He spent another few minutes watching the Erumpent make its daily migration from one half of the distant field to the other. It went slowly, though Harry knew from personal experience that it could move much, much faster. Harry watched it till it was out of sight, until enough time had passed that a certain blond could have reasonably eaten and left.
They all moved a little further into the entryway. From here, Harry could see one of the windows of the sitting room was open, the view almost completely taken up by a half-wild-looking rose bush.
Malfoy’s eyes on him are warm with a restrained amusement, almost a fondness, and Harry has to swallow and look away.
“It’s a delicate operation. A well-timed and well-oiled machine. A dance. A science. A craft. And it starts by putting yesterday’s dough into the ovens. Each of these trays has a Stasis Charm over it. The charms kick in to stop the bread from proving any longer after a certain point. This allows me to make dough the day beforehand without the dough developing past the stage I’d like. You’ll need to take the Stasis Charms off of each tray before you put it in the oven.”
Hermione tells him what Harry said, the whole story as she understands it from Harry, minus the way Harry had sat in her kitchen, at a loss for what to do. Somewhere about halfway through the telling, her mouth loses its determined stiffness and her shoulders relax and Malfoy leans forward in his own seat as he asks questions, his elegant voice going a little breathless. Harry watches the transformation but is still hard-pressed to say what caused it, what the turning point was. All he knows is that suddenly, Malfoy is agreeing to show Hermione his study, and the two of them are putting down their tea and dishes. The sandwiches have barely been touched. The soup congeals in its little bowls. Harry is the only one to have eaten his food, his appetite having returned around the time they started using words like
an impressive use of that spell, Draco. I’ve never seen it used like that before, but it makes sense. How are you feeling? The initial blast was so powerful, and you kept it going so long the second time.”
Malfoy pushes the fringe from his eye with a slender hand. His cheeks are pink. Harry can’t tell if it’s the light of the fire or tipsiness or perhaps that Malfoy is blushing. “More like I expected…more rowdiness from your lot. All right. Truth, then.”
Malfoy touched a finger to the skin next to Harry’s hole. Harry felt the sensation all the way through him.
Malfoy looked predatory. He was enjoying this. Harry shouldn’t give him the satisfaction of a reaction, but he was dizzy and his mouth was dry. He couldn’t think straight. “Ah, no. I’ve never tried.”
“Getting him extra caffeinated for you,” the purple-haired barista—“Heather” according to her name tag—said to Malfoy when he reappeared.
The corners of Malfoy’s mouth turn down. In his dangling fingers, the port glass—which he’d been idly swirling—goes still. Harry knows half a minute of confused feelings—his instant anger mixed with a just-as-sudden influx of regret and a heart-pounding emotion akin to fear. Then Malfoy says, “I was courting Astoria Greengrass. She was in the year below ours in school. Daphne’s younger sister. But I stopped when I realized it wouldn’t do for me—that no witch would.”
Draco straddled Harry’s lap. The look on his face sent a pang through Harry’s gut. Draco was still buttoned up, but his hair was in disarray.
Then he squeezed into the recesses of Harry’s mind as if looking for something. As if Harry’s shame and humiliation weren’t enough, and he needed to pry into the places even Harry rarely visited, while Harry writhed and tore at him and gasped.
Everyone in the court turns to the new voice. A deep voice, rough and familiar. Harry’s heart leaps.
Harry didn’t know what else to say. Words tumbled through his mind as he tried to come up with the right combination—the right thing to say to make Malfoy understand—because Malfoy still hadn’t opened the door for him and was looking at Harry like he didn’t recognize him.
Although there was no reason for Harry to feel winded, he sounded breathless as he said, “I was helping Luna on the farm and lost track of the time.”
“We also use a sourdough starter. Almost all of our baked goods are made with sourdough as a base. How sour they are depends on how long they prove.”
“Gluttons,” Heather said with disgust. Then, as they nearly ripped her arm from its socket in their enthusiasm, she snapped, “Watch it, now!” They backed off, jaws crunching.
“Almost as soon as I moved to Oregon. In the US, especially in this part of the country, it’s practically impossible to get around without driving. Easier for magical folks, but ultimately more convenient all around to have a car. Difficult to Apparate if you haven’t been to a location before. And you miss the countryside.”
The ham was thickly sliced, dry, and smoky-flavored. The bread was a buttery croissant. There was a pickle spear on the side, along with what turned out to be a pickled carrot.
He can’t stop thinking about Malfoy. Nothing in particular about him. Just…him. His prim manners and acid wit and neatly pressed clothes. His long ink-stained fingers, the lines at the corners of his eyes. When they were in school, Harry never thought of Malfoy as
Draco stalked around the garden, looking for the culprit. This time, without a muggle to witness him, he let out a high-pitched whistle. He held the tip of his wand to his lips to augment the call, warping it to sound...well, a lot like a whale song.
A flurry of plates and utensils and vegetables swirl around the kitchen. Draco stands in the center of the storm, hair tousled, eyes wild. It takes him a minute to notice Harry leaning in the doorway with his mouth turned up in a lopsided grin.
Malfoy’s voice was mocking, but there was something else in it, something playful and warm. The side of his hand gently pressed against the side of Harry’s on the ground.
Tea and toast. Tea and toast first, before arguments with Potter. Before any conscious thought is needed.
Harry scowled. He tossed back the rest in a gulp and suppressed a violent shiver. “Godric. That’s. Awful.”
“Now you may have it back,” Malfoy said. He reached into his bag and withdrew the ice cream cone—carefully, cradling it like a kitten. “It’s all right,” he murmured to the cone. “Harry can eat you now, I promise.”
Harry worked his fist over Malfoy’s cock, entranced. Malfoy was so hard, his skin so soft and so slick with precome. He noted every squeeze and twist that drew a reaction from Malfoy and repeated each until Malfoy was mewling desperately and digging his nails into Harry’s back.
Harry froze, hands still grasping the brim of the hat, then turned. (“Excuse me,” the hat said. “We’re not done here?”)
Harry felt the tingle of Malfoy’s magic over him. Then Malfoy drew Harry toward him, and Harry went with it bonelessly.
Harry swore he could feel the heat of Malfoy’s body in the cramped quarters. He might have had room to take at least one step back, but he didn’t. He was too absorbed with watching Malfoy’s hand spin a knob as the milk in the pitcher swirled and hissed. The mirror against the back wall was very close, so Harry had a good view in the reflection.
Malfoy gave him a look strikingly like Hermione. “There’s more than one book here on the subject, Potter. This”—he circled his finger in the air—“is the section on magical plant illnesses. If you start at that end at the top, I’ll start on this end at the bottom. If you went through Luna’s collection this morning, I hope you’d be able to remember at least some of the books she already has.”
him. He had been there talking to Harry, had discussed other details with him. They’d had a long conversation. And nowhere in there had he mentioned that Harry would need to wake up in the middle of the night.
Now he’s sitting up, forcing some tasteless muck into his mouth so that he won’t have to drink a nutrition potion again. Ron was by earlier with Rose, and George visited shortly after with a gift wrapped in orange paper. (It sits on the edge of his overbed table; he knows better than to open it in a hospital room.) No one has talked to him about what happened at Malfoy’s house—or what happened to Malfoy—and Harry hasn’t asked. Partly, because he doesn’t know how much Hermione has told Ron about her involvement with Malfoy’s investigation.
he didn’t have an appetite for more than two of the biscuits when they were done,” Draco muttered. “You didn’t think to stop him?” Harry scoffed: “And ruin a perfectly good memory?”)
, and turns the hob to high. A jar of tea, the container of milk, and a mug fly onto the counter, cupboards opening and slamming like the wings of agitated snitches. With the tea set up, Harry moves onto the dirty dishes, sweeping them into the sink with a stab of his wand. They clang distressingly, but none break, to Harry’s distant relief and more immediate annoyance.
“‘Phone number’? ‘Gotten’?” he said. He stolidly ignored Malfoy’s gaze, which he felt prickling the side of his face.
in your own space, where you won’t terrorize the muggles and, more importantly, where I don’t need to encounter you every time I want tea.”
Harry wrinkled his nose. He wanted to tell her that a car ride was nearly as bad, though it wasn’t, really—except he did feel uneasy hurtling down this side of the street, not that he would admit it to Ginny.
Malfoy palmed Harry’s balls and lifted them to lick the tender skin behind them. Down, toward Harry’s arse, using his other hand to push aside Harry’s cheek. Somehow, the
The road curved and wound its way into the hills, where trees pressed close, making a green tunnel. Ginny cracked the windows, and the smell of pine wafted in. They passed through a small town with a single petrol station and one short stretch of old buildings. “Vacuum Repair” said one shop front. “Stationery” said another.
Malfoy and Ginny continued to banter. Meanwhile, Harry sipped his beer and pledged to pace himself with it. He could not allow himself to get as hammered as he had at the previous pub night.
There is no reason for Harry to start guiltily when someone raps lightly at his door, but he does, slamming closed the book in his hands.
Malfoy looks dubious, but he accepts the plate Harry offers him. He regards the little quiches with a curled lip.
At that, Ginny’s eyes widened. But before Harry could interpret the expression, the waiter appeared.
In the end, they had trays and trays of rolled triangles of dough that Malfoy insisted had “perfect lamination,” but Harry didn’t care, he only wanted to throttle Malfoy.
They dusted flour over the tabletop and tipped the mixed dough onto it. The flour barely showed on Malfoy’s pale skin, but was obvious on Harry’s. Malfoy talked Harry through the folding process he used, which he’d apparently learned from a fifth-generation baker in France. It introduced more air into the dough for a
Harry’s eyes widened, sensing his sarcasm backfiring on him. “Actually, I probably should start with something else, something less…”
Draco rushed forward in time to prevent Edward from stroking the deceptively innocent-looking flowers. Visions of visits from the DMLE flashed through his mind: court summons and Statue of Secrecy violations, officers tramping around in his gardens, obliviators spending a week camped on his land, his prized plant breeding stock taken away, his creatures carted off.
Malfoy pushes away from the chair, rolling his eyes again, like Harry is making demands of him. “Fine. Whatever.”
Harry stood across the street and watched him mix dough. The hands that had become familiar to him. The white-blond hair that fell over his features. Though Harry couldn’t see it, he knew there would be a little crease of concentration between Malfoy’s eyebrows. Harry licked his dry lips.
Malfoy’s eyebrows furrow, and he looks at the fire in the fireplace, obviously about ready to comment on the warmth in the room. Then a thought appears to strike him, and he says, “Did you come by floo?”
“I don’t know. I was thinking of working full-time with Luna on the farm. We never have enough help. But we’re lucky to break even with farm costs and revenue. For anything else, we need another source of income. I was originally thinking of maybe opening a training camp here permanently. Hence the shed. But the college was looking for someone, and a permanent training camp would have meant a lot of people and a lot of noise for most of the year.”
“Thank you,” Draco said, dryly. “Truly flattered.” He narrowed his eyes. “Who gave you my information?”
Harry is trying to place why he seems familiar when the man turns just enough to recognize his features from last night’s Internet search.
Malfoy glanced at him. Frowned. Put the pen in his teeth. Opened the book and placed it atop the other so the passages aligned. Took the pen from his mouth.
Brushing his teeth that night before bed, Harry is still thinking about Malfoy. Malfoy and Robards and the Ministry’s letters and the blank spaces on the case file.
Harry doesn’t know what to say or ask—nothing that isn’t self-evident, in any case. But the silence stretches on until he has to break it some way. As he hands Malfoy his tea, he says, “So they discharged you.”
Malfoy was boastful about it, himself. But Harry didn’t mind it so much in Malfoy. There was something funny about the way Malfoy gestured animatedly and waxed poetic about the Internet and recipe searches. Harry wasn’t the only one to think so. The girls stifled laughter.
Harry thought it strange that Malfoy hadn't amounted to something...greater with his life. A politician, maybe, or—oh, he didn't know
Harry had no idea what to say. He blinked back at Malfoy, still tingling from the combination of his own magic and Malfoy’s washing over him.
Harry’s gaze moved to the woman behind the counter. She had purple-streaked hair and smiled as she handed a receipt to the current customer. Next to her, a man with cropped dark hair pushed buttons at the bank of coffee machines behind the counter.
Maybe it was the lazy energy of the day, maybe it was the salt water, maybe it was the food or the soothing rumble of the car, but Harry found himself falling asleep as he watched the scenery pass by.
Harry completed the ritual of paying with the card and then stepped aside and leaned against the pick-up counter.
They had spent the rest of the evening talking about food: what they missed from their travels, what they missed from England when they were away. Ron continued to shoot covetous looks at the chips. He also gave Harry an update on the goings-on in the Auror department. It wasn’t quite so uncomfortable now for Harry to hear about cases he’d been on that were now closed and new cases he wasn’t familiar with. It seemed like it belonged to someone else’s life. As Ron recounted anecdotes about illegal potioneers that checked themselves into St Mungo’s with poisoning—and Portkeys that were transporting unsuspecting Muggles from charity shops to chateaus in the Loire Valley—Harry felt a vague wistfulness, but mostly he felt relief.
He became aware of a screaming in the back of his mind. As he stepped into the kitchen, the sound crescendoed, and he blinked at the cloud of steam rising from the hob. It was the kettle.
Harry attempted the anti-jinx he’d learned from the Curse-Breaker consultant they’d had on the crop cases. It had no effect.
Malfoy rolls his eyes and twirls his wand. A snifter of brandy sails to Harry. Harry sits in the chair opposite Malfoy and takes a drink. He tries not to make a face—hard liquor’s never really been his thing, he’s more of a cider man—but must not entirely succeed, because Malfoy smirks over the rim of his glass.
Harry leans over the kitchen table, squeezing his chin. No word from Robards. That means he specifically did not inform Harry about the tip on Malfoy or the planned search.
“So Malfoy gave you the grand tour of his shop,” Ginny said, drawing his attention back. She had a peculiar look on her face again, and Harry didn’t trust it.
Harry looked at Malfoy, who grinned at him as he sucked the last of the ice cream from the nub of cone he had left.
It all comes out in the next half an hour. Malfoy shares that Harry was on his case for weeks and had discovered the truth for himself: that Malfoy, in fact, was behind the squib-producing compound he was attempting to blame on Poesy Potions. The story comes out in the matter-of-fact way of people under veritaserum, the words almost tumbling out of his mouth, but in his clipped, sneering tones. Malfoy wanted to put a stop to muggleborns.
Hermione furrows her brow and pours them tea, adding milk to both—and sugar to his. Harry cradles his hands around his cup and looks back at her through the rising steam.
“I’ll help,” he said. Ginny, unlike Luna, did not protest, only grunted when he lent his magic. She looked perfectly capable of doing it on her own. He struggled to keep up with her, in fact, but if Ginny noticed—or if she thought he was hindering her own efforts—she didn’t say anything. Steadily, the dent straightened out of the wall until the wall looked restored.
Harry ate the sandwich and the pickle spear and even the pickled carrot—which was weird—and drank the…coffee. He watched the queue form up and empty again.
Slipping his foot into the first sandal, he felt the smooth round surface of an egg just before he applied his weight. He heard the crunch and felt the thick, wet splatter.
Luna’s response had been so overwhelmingly positive that Harry felt guilty. Originally, he’d planned to take off for the day and see more of the city by himself. Only, when he arrived in the alley down the street from Malfoy’s shop, he remembered that sometimes Luna stopped by to deliver food.
Then a little while after that, Draco pulls away. His lips are red and his cheeks are pink and his hair sticks up in attractive clumps. “Hermione’s going to wonder where I am.”
The pale white-and-tan beasts watched him as he approached, fixing him with their devilish slit-pupil eyes while they rrrrip rrrrrrripped more branches from the roses.
Harry’s heart sped up, and for a moment, their eyes met. Then Draco Malfoy’s gaze slid to one of the people watching next to the window, and he smiled, and turned to toss the ball of dough onto a pan.
Harry couldn’t see any reason not to, and Malfoy was watching, so he took a drink. “That’s. Some kind of fruit. And…I have no idea what that is. Something spicy.”
Hand gripping the door frame, Alex makes a face. He doesn’t say sorry, at least. He’s done that enough. Sorry. Thank you. How can I repay you.
“If you touch a thing, Potter, so help me. Your piece of paper is not a search warrant, and you and I both know it.”
He strolled around the side of the counter and met Harry’s gaze with a lazy expression, which was when Harry realized that Malfoy had known he’d been watching the entire time. His heart flip-flopped.
He glanced back at Malfoy, who had just finished snapping a lid on a drink and handing it to a customer with a smile. Malfoy never had been very good at pretending to feel something he didn’t. And though he might have learned the art of dissembling sometime over the last ten years, Harry got the impression this wasn’t an act. The staff who worked with Malfoy smiled, nodded, danced around him, and said straightforward things to him with easy confidence. Judging by their body language, they got equally straightforward responses.
But she hadn’t smiled. She furrowed her brow and hugged her arms to her chest. “We’re here for you. Don’t stay locked up forever. It’s not good.”
Too late, he realizes his prominent position in the entry hall. The door swings open and the two familiar faces appear over Malfoy’s shoulder.
Malfoy bucked again. Harry’s heart raced. He knew where this would lead, and he looked forward to it. But also—he’d never before sucked cock. Not that he intended to let that stop him.
Malfoy didn’t comment on Harry’s lack of attention or his hopelessness with non-combat charms, only enunciated the incantation for him and then lifted his wand to sketch the movement in the air.
She reminded him sharply of Molly in that moment. He rolled over and buried his head under his pillow. This was supposed to be a holiday. A minute later, he heaved himself up. It was for the best, anyway. He’d been lying there thinking about Malfoy. Malfoy and his coffee shop and his friendship with Luna and Ginny. He replayed the conversation in his head. It had remained unexpectedly polite, and was unsettling for that.
And Harry’s tenderest secrets: his obsession with the peek of skin above the cuffs of Malfoy’s robes, the wrists delicate and blue-veined. The way Malfoy’s jeers warmed his stomach in a way that had nothing to do with anger.
“Always,” Edward conceded. “But we can’t have the praise going to your head. You might decide you’re too good for us and leave for the big city.”
It was more or less on this note that Harry left Sunday night, Malfoy nearly frantic as he pushed Harry into the floo. Harry managed only a few hours of restless sleep that night; he was sure he was more worried than Malfoy. But then, his worry was bound up with his guilt and the distressing knowledge that the Ministry—the Ministry he’s worked so hard for, the Ministry that had publicly eviscerated him while he was in school and yet he still stubbornly trusted to do the right thing—is covering up a scandal that put people at risk, that stole their magic, their heritage, their future from them. Malfoy had the moral high ground here, and he was walking to the slaughter with his usual pureblood comportment, head held high and proud, while Harry could only watch.
, Potter.” He lifted his hand and made a loose fist and then waved it, as if holding a wand. Then he repeated the movement.
The men took turns with curses, with kicks. They were playing with him now. And he was bawling. Bawling, like a child, and begging. A little part of his mind stood aside, watching with revulsion.
For the last few years, business had been working out quite well for them. Best of all, they could make their own schedule—which meant taking three weeks around Christmas and the New Year off. It was nice to spend time with friends and family—and each other—as they pleased. These last few days, they’d had Teddy over, and, for the most part, it’d been a delight—if a little messy.
Some time later, they met back together, and Harry showed Malfoy his haul of stones. He had spent some time looking for the most beautiful ones to show Malfoy, but Malfoy only frowned. He plucked several from Harry’s hand and tossed them onto the ground.
Harry rolled his eyes but stilled his foot. He reached for a small leather-bound box with a latch that required a gentle Unlocking Charm to open. The lid sprang open, and the sight of letters inside of it triggered a memory of Sirius’s collection in the attic.
Malfoy only sniffed. “I have a very good imagination, thank you very much.” He turned, walking toward the back wall, obviously expecting Harry to follow.
Then, he was fucking Harry, the hot drag of his cock hitting Harry’s prostate with every thrust. He was so
Harry pads over to the little junk drawer near the sink. There are all sorts of things in there. Snapped quills and Muggle rubber bands and chocolate frog cards and owl treats and knuts and a lizard skull and a bag of dried mugwort and little potion bottles that roll with the movement of the drawer opening. Harry sifts through it all and pulls out the picture of Malfoy. Malfoy glares at him. A little smile tugs at Harry’s lips, which causes Malfoy in the picture to look briefly confused and then scowl all the harder.
His heart raced. His heart should not be racing. It was Malfoy. Just…Malfoy. The prat he’d beaten at Quidditch. Who had sneered and insulted his friends and thought too much of himself.
A bolt of inspiration struck him, and he broke away to spiral high, high up—far above the balls of light, high enough that he was out of their light. From there, he could see the stars clearly. They surrounded him all the way down to the horizon in every direction he looked—as if he were in space.
She casts a disillusionment charm on them both in order to avoid the press, who are having a field day. Harry is relieved Malfoy was escorted separately to the Ministry’s jail, bypassing all of these vultures.
“So he cast the shield charm just before he dropped unconscious,” Shacklebolt says. “And you left him in that state?”
“Malfoy,” Ginny said, and—to Harry’s further surprise—bent down for her own quick hug, which Malfoy returned with a dry, but fond, “Weasley.”
“And I thought I’d see if we could…chat. You know. Since you’re obviously a part of Ginny and Luna’s life.”
Williams and Chesterfield must have sent a message to Robards, too. A silvery bull charged into the room. It reared its head and boomed, “Call Potter. We need—”
“Don’t be crass. It’s called a silencing charm, and you could have used one,” Draco said, coolly avoiding Harry’s gaze, though there was a flush on his cheeks and neck. He straightened his clothes and hair. Done with that, he waved his wand, placing the book under a disillusionment again. He tucked his wand into his pocket and glanced at Harry, who was still rubbing his nose. He frowned. “Are you all right? I didn’t bite
“Thanks.” He accepts the mirror from her. “Remember the case file on Malfoy I was waiting for clearance on? Yeah. That. It finally arrived in my inbox.”
Hermione and Ron asked him to come by. He declined. He couldn’t meet Hermione’s eyes through the floo.
Harry cracked his hand away from his eyes. Still bright. He gave it another moment and then tenderly peeled his hands away. The kitchen was alive with light, every lamp turned on. He glanced behind him. The front of the shop was dark, barely visible, illuminated only by the light of a street lamp beyond the front door.
They walked for a long time. The bonfires became brighter as the sky grew darker, until they were walking through dusk, and the wet shore gleamed with deep pinks and blues. Walking endlessly, a bit like their endless drive that day. The shore and sky stretched before them, tugged them on.
Harry’s fingers turn white on the porcelain plate. He has to remember why he came here. He has to remember— There’s something beneath Malfoy’s bluster. Harry can’t quite place it, but he can see the shadow of it lurking beneath the narrowed eyes and razor mouth.
Harry stepped into his own corner. He felt inexplicably nervous. The device was unwieldy in his hand. He’d never held a gun before, not even a toy gun. It felt wrong and bulky and cartoonish, like a thing that really had been taken from an old science fiction show. He cracked a smile at the thought of Arthur binging on vintage sci-fi movies in the name of research.
Inside the brown picket fence, the grounds are well-maintained. No peacocks strut over the lawn, but the grass and bushes are manicured, and the low hedges along the path are cut straight enough to measure by. The flowerbeds are a bit overgrown, but even that’s in an artful, intentional manner. The house itself is a storybook cottage of faded bricks, red and brown roof shingles, diamond-shaped window panes, and frilly embellishments painted pale green. Ivy consumes half the house and creeps up the chimney stack.
The flow of words mostly went in one ear and out the other, but Harry liked hearing Malfoy talk, liked hearing the cadence of Americanisms mixed with the posh drawl that came out when Malfoy was lecturing. It amused Harry maybe more than it should have. He wanted to keep Malfoy going, so he asked a couple of questions, which perked Malfoy up—and soon Harry was hearing about single-origin beans and farmer relations and fair trade and specialty coffee.
Harry walks up the path to Draco’s cottage. He’s in the mood to go on foot. He’s been thinking, and the air is sweet today, the sun warm.
Harry resists rolling his own eyes. Of course Malfoy would home in on his weakness. But he should probably be glad it’s that and not Harry’s
In reality, they’d never made it quite to the rock. There was nothing to see when it was that dark, so they’d turned back to the car. But now, they stopped near its base, and Malfoy tugged Harry’s hand, drawing him close.
A bunch of tiny multicolored frogs leaped into the pathway, and Harry paused so they could pass. Two children playing by the fountain squealed at the sight of them and crouched down to watch them hop and bobble toward the fountain’s edge, where the frogs leaped to the lip of the fountain in a spray of color. The children laughed and thrust their hands out to catch the frogs (they didn’t succeed) or to help them. A couple of straggling frogs used their hands as a step up and disappeared over the edge of the fountain.
They were stretched out on the sofa, scent of pine wafting from a small green-foil tree—Draco passed out on Harry, Teddy making little-kid snores from the floor. This was the only page with sound. “I love you, you stubborn wanker,” paper-Harry murmured to a sleeping Draco.
And then Harry was being ripped from the memory, from the private part of Malfoy’s mind, and he let it happen.
“Mmm, no. That would be more complicated than taking the entire ward system down. But there is a break built into the wards about half a mile south. Most of the small animals know to pass through that way, but hatchlings won’t know about it. I imagine they’re confused, having just been born.”
Malfoy accepts the cup. “That doesn’t explain why you collapsed on my floor. You couldn’t breathe, could you?”
A little while later, Harry found himself back at Knead. He hadn’t planned it. He’d just walked until he was standing in front of the door. And he couldn’t turn away because Malfoy was in the front window, making dough, and his gaze met Harry’s.
“You’re being distracting,” Malfoy said at one point, and parked Harry at the till to take orders, which Harry did not point out was probably a worse mistake than leaving him on barista duty.
“Huh? Oh. No, they haven’t.” Luna and Ginny had remained busy around the farm, and so had Harry. It hadn’t even occurred to him that he still hadn’t seen much of Portland.
It had been forever since he’d felt so exhilarated—but even when he’d played Quidditch, he hadn’t felt quite like
“This is the dividing line,” Luna said. Something about the quality of her voice—hushed, almost a whisper—prevented him from asking what it divided, though it was clear as they left the creek behind that they had entered the forest.
He’d give it a day. A day for the anxiety of opening the letter to settle. A day to wake up without the weight of existential dread in his gut and have tea and toast like a normal wizard without chasing wayward creatures and old men about the garden, overturning pales of fish fertilizer and upsetting all of the plants. Then, he’d consider his next course of action. Three months. He had enough time.
“Mine this time?” Harry said, and sent a silver wisp from his temple into the water. He murmured the incantation and tapped the side of the projector with his wand. The water shivered and threw fractured light into the air. It trembled, blurred, and then sharpened into a scene from earlier that evening: Harry, Draco, Teddy, and a clean, pre-biscuit-baking kitchen.
Harry went into the kitchen to make himself a sandwich. He had it with a glass of the iced tea. The nervousness he’d felt on his trip here had relaxed, but there was a new tension in him, a feeling like teeth gritting, like a spell waiting to go off but trapped.
The windows of the coffee shop were dark. Harry’s heart sank as he approached. Ginny with her practical jokes. He was going to strangle her.
Then Harry wanted to stop at a shop that made fudge, and at the tourist gift shop next to it, which Malfoy bore with dignity.
High spots of pink appear on Malfoy’s cheeks. “Let me see if I can get this straight. You’re suggesting I use legilimency on you.”
Luna had given him and Malfoy the easier job, Harry thought: to make the ground soft and wet enough that she, Ginny, and Parkinson could lift the tree and its roots. He lifted his hand when Malfoy did and said the incantation. It was surprisingly easy, casting together—maybe because of the time they’d spent working in the coffeehouse, maybe because of the time they’d spent…doing other things. Malfoy’s magic mingled with Harry’s. It wasn’t the blast that it had been when Malfoy rescued him from the fairies. It washed over Harry in waves.
But that proved useless. Malfoy’s statement, in his edged handwriting, was just as illegible, all pointy symbols like some forgotten language.
The uncensored case file still hasn’t come up from Records yet, he sees. He suppresses his annoyance and collects all of the files he does have, then begins to skim through them over again.
Harry huffed. “I don’t, all right. I…” His eyes warmed. Too close. His emotions were too close to the surface. He’d almost forgotten what they were like, bubbling under his skin. But he pursed his lips, pressed on. “When I saw you in the Ministry. When they brought you in…” His voice failed. Malfoy regarded him with an inscrutable expression. Harry scowled. “I was really fucking angry, all right? I thought. Fuck. I thought I was sending you to Azkaban.” He covered his face. Fresh tears tracked down his cheeks. Shit. Why was he still here?
Harry gave Draco the honor of opening the book this time. He loved to watch the way Draco’s face softened, loved the look of wonder and pride as Draco flipped through the pages they’d already created: 23 of them so far, one for each day of December that had passed.
Later, replaying her words, Harry thinks about Malfoy, about how Malfoy had found himself on the wrong side of the war, about how he responded by becoming this advocate for muggles and muggleborns, this man who donates silently to charities and fights furiously for the rights of muggleborns—about how
“Next week is going to be busy,” Harry says. He has to look away from Draco before the expression on the other man’s face opens him up and Draco can see all of
Harry found his bag waiting on one of the armchairs near the stove. He unpacked his things, unshrank them, and placed them into the drawers and onto the empty shelves: shirts and trousers and trainers and toothbrush, as well as one book on visiting Oregon that had been written in 1977, gifted to him by Arthur. He poked through the cabinets in the en-suite and found a vial of Sleeping Draught. He silently blessed his friends for that.
The conversation turned to Parkinson’s recent travels through Italy. Parkinson recounted tales of Venice and Naples animatedly while smoke trickled from her mouth and Ginny and Luna’s colored bubbles floated around her.
“And. Erm. I found these. I’m not. Uh. Not sure what you’ll think of them. They’re old letters between Remus and Sirius. But I thought—when he’s old enough—Teddy might want something of his dad’s.”
The thing about Grimmauld Place was that it was very quiet. Harry hadn’t really noticed before, maybe because he’d typically come home to sleep and bathe and—sometimes—eat. Now, spending days in it alone, he became aware of the void where sounds should be: the cackle of a crow, the clack of the bamboo wind chime, the brush of curtains in the breeze, the faint buzz of the fridge.
Harry was sitting on the top step of the garden path, having an American “biscuit” with some kind of sauce—Luna called it vegan gravy; it wasn’t half bad—and wondering what Luna had in store for him next (and just how he could duck out of it) when something dropped next to him with a loud thump.
Just as Harry is wondering if one more floo jump would kill his appetite, Malfoy sits up and says, “I think that’s it for now. Granger, thank you for your help.”
He thinks about that, sometimes. People who know the truth about what happened in the Forbidden Forest—like Hermione and Ron and Ginny—insist that he was brave for facing his death. He knows the truth. He was simply resigned. There was no other way. He had no choice. Not like Malfoy.  Malfoy could turn away from all of this at any time, could live a quiet, pleasant life in his cottage, donating anonymously to charities and allowing the polluted water to be someone else’s problem. But he isn’t. He’s determined and passionate and doggedly stubborn.
Harry squawked. He looked down to see that his outfit had been Transfigured into a white chef’s jacket. His hand flew to his head, and he pulled off a pleated, fluffy hat.
Harry stumbled, folding the dough in the wrong direction and pushing too hard. He felt Malfoy’s disapproving look and reshaped the dough into a ball.
They rolled down an overpass, along a tree-lined road and onto a dual carriageway flanked by golden grass. That was another thing here: the roads were so much wider.
“Yeah. Just, the hearing tomorrow. This was brilliant, Hermione, it was. But I’m worried it’s too late, and not enough.”
He feels a moment of frustration at himself that he let someone sneak up on him, followed by a pang of grief and apology for his friends. He closes his eyes.
She blinks up at him, gives herself a little shake. “Yes. Right here.” She rummages through a bag she left on the kitchen table. “Did you get something before you left?”
A while later, Harry blinks open his sticky eyes with an ache in his neck and a bit of drool at the corner of his mouth.
Draco smiled, all slyness and teeth. He pulled Harry’s shirt the rest of the way off, Harry moving to accommodate Draco’s hands. Pulled the jeans off, the pants. He loomed over Harry on hands and knees. “Have you ever done this before?”
Except they aren’t, really. No one is firing off spells, the protesters all appear in acceptably muggle clothes, and there is nothing inherently Statute-breaking about standing around in a group holding paper signs. So the aurors mill around on the street above the Ministry in their glamoured uniforms alongside the muggle police, including Harry, who stands not far from the red phone booth, meeting the determined stare of witches and wizards and a surprising number of muggles—and trying not to grin.
Harry’s own thoughts collected around that realization and filed into a blade that he used to cut through.
“And I’ll be done working on this prototype with George by then.” He made a face. “I’d better. Rotten thing’s already taking weeks longer than it should have. Point is, you don’t have to do this alone. You know?”
Harry wonders, briefly, if that’s why he came over: to start something—an argument, a debate—with Malfoy. He decides he didn’t, shakes the tension out of his shoulders, and says, “Are you going to offer me a drink?”
Potter eyed him. “I was getting bored sitting in the kitchen. So I came out here. Did you do all this? The birds are singing. It’s beautiful. And you have pets.”
She cackled once more, then they were encased in silence again except for the rumble of the wheels over the road.
Harry runs a hand over the smooth, cool surface of the desk. The liquid in the pensieve moves slowly, gleaming mother-of-pearl.
“Haystack Rock and Thor’s Well,” Luna said. “They’re very nice, aren’t they? Draco has a lot of nice artwork. He’s collected it from all over Oregon. A lot of artists live here.”
A sound—something like a rustle of leaves—pulled Draco’s attention away. It was nothing, probably the wind, but when Draco turned back to Edward, the old man had stepped into the middle of the path and planted his hands on his hips.
and says she’s proud of him for it. Maybe that’s true, but as far as Harry’s concerned, knowing the facts and understanding what he’s getting into is just the right thing to do.
Several times, Malfoy came close to licking the most vulnerable part of Harry, but he always skirted around, away. He pushed Harry’s arse cheeks wide with both hands, and his mouth went everywhere except the places Harry most wanted it.
cats, so once he saw past the similarity to Umbridge’s office, it was…pleasant. Ish. And the coffee was…okay. He hadn’t expected the “salted” to be quite so salty, but it was mostly palatable. It didn’t have the same body as Malfoy’s coffee, though, and it was harsher.
So it was evening when at last they parked and Malfoy announced that they’d arrived in Cannon Beach.
Luna led him through the vegetable and herb gardens on the way back to the house, collecting basil, tomatoes, dill, and an onion as she went, so he had seen a fair amount of the farm by the time he settled in to eat a vegetable omelet and sourdough toast.
After another couple minutes, he’d convinced them to begin walking in the direction of his neighbors’ property. A good thing he’d left his wand in the house. He was tempted to hex the trio of them, and it would be just his luck if he spooked them so badly that they stopped giving milk, or if they came back to lay waste to his garden out of petty revenge. They were demon creatures. They’d do that.
He needs to get out. He’s going mad. Maybe that’s Robards’ plan: to drive Harry from the department now that he’s lost his use. Foist pointless casework on him, fail to give him access to all of the necessary records.
She glances over her shoulder, as if confirming the room is presentable. It’s an action Harry’s got used to since Rose began to crawl. And later, walk. And ride a toy broomstick.
Shacklebolt listens calmly to the whole story, only occasionally lifting a hand to cut Robards off before the head auror can butt in.
He lay down on the bed. It felt a bit like the last time—the first time—in Malfoy’s bed, except everything happened slower now, and clearer. The mattress springs creaked underneath him; he could feel them against his back. Malfoy was looking at him with something beyond appreciation, and that made Harry even more excited.
Malfoy plucked a number stand from the counter and handed it to Harry. “We’ll bring your order out.”
Harry had the feeling of being squeezed, of all the air pressing out of his lungs. He swallowed tightly. Lowered the page.
Malfoy was standing close enough that Harry could smell the scent of coffee coming from him—the scent of
Draco took the kettle off the heat. He was aware of Potter standing awkwardly just inside the kitchen. He studiously did not look at him; he focused on the task of pulling a second mug down from the cupboard.
Near the end of the morning, when the students were losing energy and beginning to drift into small groups at the edges of the practice field, he and Ginny began a spontaneous Seeker’s game. His pulse raced. Ginny flattened herself to the handle of her broom, flyaways streaming around her face. The Snitch glinted in the hard afternoon sun, even with charms softening its glare.
Harry has no idea why he’s winding Malfoy up, because that is exactly what he’s doing, despite the fact that he’s not in school anymore. He’s 32, and he’s here in an official capacity. He checks himself, hard. “No one’s making any accusations. But I can’t believe the Ministry sent those.”
Malfoy laughed. His hand shot out, caught a gleam of gold. He pulled up sharply, and Harry realized he was hurtling toward the ground.
“This one that you and Draco brought back from the bookshop.” She lifted it so he could see the cover. He remembered it only vaguely as the one Malfoy had taken from the high shelf. His mind had been on other things at the time. That thought sent a confusing stab of emotion through him, and he shoved his hands deeper into his pockets.
It occurred to Harry that he could walk around until two and return then. No reason for him to sit here. Then his gaze drifted to the street view beyond Malfoy, at a bus passing and a woman on a skateboard with a dog, and he thought he didn’t mind sitting for a little while.
He didn’t run. If he did, he would only spook the voracious monsters off, and good luck rounding them up, then. He wished he’d had a mind to grab carrots out of the larder.
He pulled down the loose leaf and put the water on to boil, and—once he’d rinsed the dregs of Edward’s coffee from the mug left on the table—it was nearly as if the intervening episode hadn’t happened. Even the low-key sense of foreboding, which had returned to his gut, didn’t keep him from humming. It was a song Kara had taught him on her last visit, a disgustingly catchy tune. He’d have it stuck in his head all day now. Right then, though, he didn’t mind. The kettle hissed cheerfully. The toast sprang from the muggle contraption on the counter, a perfect shade of golden brown. The fire in the hearth stoked itself high. He poured the water for the tea. Opened the jar of jam. Arranged the toast on his favorite blue clay plate, the one with nice heft and a little chip on the edge. He smiled a curling sort of smile as he spread a thick layer of butter and then jam on each slice. It was a subtle science and art, achieving the perfect ratio, one honed through years of practice and experimentation.
Parkinson was still giving Malfoy a considering look. Then her gaze traveled to Malfoy’s hat, and she said, “What
he didn’t need the company, he was quite all right. He dashed inside and performed a frantic search of the house before finding his notes on the floor near the duchess. He made a face at her and jogged back outside.
“And they were mysteriously unable to collect a sample,” Draco deadpanned. “There had to be other containers of potion in the lab. Don’t tell me that you were special enough to be standing next to the only barrel of potion in the building, Potter.”
, Malfoy thought, with a tinge of impatience and laughter that had an edge. Not quite cruel, but not kind.
“I don’t know what to say. Would you like my professional opinion, or would you like my reply as a friend?”
Harry smirked. “I have to say, I never imagined us in this position. I always wondered what went on in that head of yours.”
He’d never fucked a man before, and while Harry reckoned the mechanics of it were similar enough, he felt a great urge not to hurt Malfoy, to do it right—to make him feel good.
The photo of Malfoy continues to frown at him, the steel grey eyes unblinking. Harry’s own eyes begin to water from staring so long, until he gives in and blinks, himself, and slips the photo into the inside pocket of his robes.
The problem with Portland, Oregon, wasn’t the lack of coffeehouses, Harry thought. It was the overabundance of them.
He had spent much of the day before wandering around its fields and forests. Luna had been right. He
about being domestic. I’m simply…surprised to see it on you. It’s not a bad look for you, really. And have you seen a house-elf here?”
Draco held back a retort. He eyed Potter. He might have taken the opportunity to grind him a little more into the dirt, but he simply couldn’t find it in himself. For having just started his day, he was inexplicably exhausted. That, and Draco’s suspicions about the truth of Potter's condition were discouraging: that Potter had died but hadn’t accepted it yet. In that light, antagonizing him for the sake of it lost its allure.
Once inside with the door closed, he stands in the darkness and scans the little room blindly. He considers—and rejects—the idea of turning on the light, which his colleagues and Robards will be able to see through the window above the door. Instead, he casts a low
Malfoy lowered his hand. “Come back to the sitting room with me. For once in your life, don’t be a stubborn arse.”
“They are, aren’t they?” Malfoy said. His thumb rubbed along Harry’s skin above the collar of his shirt. “Take this off?”
“No.” Harry swirled a piece of chicken around on the plate. “Actually, I was thinking of being a barista.”
Harry let his arm with the Emitter drop limply, and he wiped sweat from his forehead with the back of his wand hand.
Harry was nonplussed. He didn’t understand the slight defensiveness in Malfoy’s tone—then belatedly realized that Malfoy’s own job was technically Muggle.
“It’s an onion blossom,” Luna said to Harry, as the waiter set down the plate. “A treat, since we exerted a lot of energy today. Especially you, Draco.”
Potter came into the kitchen a few minutes later as Draco was pouring his tea. Draco studiously ignored him. He placed the tea on the table along with a plate of toast with slices of cheese.
Harry bit his own thumb. He was both relieved and disappointed when Malfoy pulled back—hissed when Malfoy replaced his tongue with a finger, which he used to trace circles around Harry’s hole. Harry shivered from the cool kiss of lube.
He lifted a hand to rub one of the small, bright green leaves between his fingers. They looked like spring leaves, and they covered the tree, almost glowing in the late summer sun.
“And you’ve already established that you don’t need to eat,” Draco said, staring intently at his parchment as he scratched notes; he still felt ill at the memory of Potter’s arm cut off at the wrist by the wood of the table. “Am I to understand your body doesn’t need sustenance in this state?”
Harry drew away from the forefinger and laved the thumb, took it into his mouth, applied his teeth to the pad.
Malfoy drew himself up, face lighting, but paused. He began to tilt his head, and then he waggled it slowly, neither a nod nor a shake.
The narrow aisle widened into a little room with a number of mirrors perched on the shelves and a small upholstered chair that looked like it was for customers.
Malfoy, who’s been standing perfectly still, relaxes with a small huff. “Unless you plan on inviting yourself to breakfast again.”
Harry hadn’t experienced resistance before this because Malfoy had been feeding him lies. Of course. He wasn’t an Unspeakable—how had Harry believed that?—but he was a gifted occlumens.
say, really, and his problem had always been things coming out of his mouth that shouldn’t. And the Prince(ss) Charming Lambic, which Charlie said was their bedrock brew, because it did what people typically wanted beer to do and
Malfoy got in beside him, and they made their way up the bumpy drive to the little road that led to the motorway. Harry couldn’t look away from Malfoy’s hands on the wheel, where they rested so casually, with their tendons and knuckles, thumbs hooked around the wheel.
“Sure, yes, come on then,” Malfoy says, instead, and moments later, Harry stands up in front of the opposite hearth.
His heart was full. It was good to feel connected to her again. He loved her, though he wasn’t in love with her anymore, and the feeling of that made him so happy. Ginny grinned at him, and he got the sense that she felt the same way.
Harry doesn’t know why he finds the garden so unexpected. Even in the dark, it’s apparent how well kept it is. Of course it is. The front garden is so tidy; why not the back? But there is something about this one that strikes him as—special. Like it’s not made for other people. The front lawn and the manicured shrubs that frame it are for appearances. This, Harry can tell, is for Malfoy alone.
Maybe he should have ordered the Hindsight 20/20 beer or at least the Prince(ess) Charming one so he could charmingly deflect the attention. But he still had some of the Daydream Doppelbock in his system, and he wasn’t keen on seeing how it mixed with another effect. Not in public, not with Malfoy sitting across from him and Parkinson looking at him like a shark.
Harry tells them everything—from arriving on Malfoy’s doorstep (minus the ludicrous wards) to flooing to Malfoy’s house to check on him out of concern. He shares his suspicions about Poesy Potions and the appearance of the Poesy CEO at the Ministry. He doesn’t leave out anything except Hermione’s involvement—and his own personal visits. If someone wants to obliviate him, he wants to make damned sure that this entire courtroom hears everything he has to say first.
“Yes! I take my business very seriously, Potter, and I wouldn’t trust anyone else’s ability to gather intelligence.”
Draco leaped backwards and flailed his arms. Tea went flying. Something large and thin dropped onto his plate—a packet of letters from the leg of the owl that screeched again, made a broad turn, and swept back out through the window.
“Oh, you know. I missed you both too much. I got into town today and had to stop by and terrorize this one. Next thing I know, I’m being dragged to the pub.”
Draco met her at the fence. She panted to a stop, flyaway hairs wild around the handkerchief tied over her head.
The quality of the pastry was a little better than that of the coffee. Mostly. He doubted it had been made that morning, though. It tasted slightly stale.
useful he’d learned from his childhood: how to remain civil and polite and gracious even in trying situations. Draco agreed to let Heather come and mend the fence, though he silently vowed to return the next day and reinforce it with some charms to dissuade the livestock. In the past, the goats had proved rather immune to charms—likely, they just didn’t care, the stubborn things—but it would make him feel…productive.
Malfoy stares. “What, Potter? Do you think there’s some nefarious reason behind it? Do you think they sacked me for bad practices?”
Then they are standing above the pensieve once more, and Harry is looking at the room through his own eyes.
“And you bring the wand up like this at the end,” she was saying, as Harry reined his attention in again. “And end with a downward motion.”
Seconds later, a bundle of white fluff appeared on a shelf above Draco, twitched its downy tail, and launched into the air. It spun gracefully towards him like a very big dandelion seed and landed on his hand. Tiny toes grasped his fingers, claws needling as the featherfee steadied itself.
They walked to the middle of the Quidditch practice field. A wind swept over them, carrying dampness from the forest beyond. Harry thought he heard the soft hoots of the Erumpent. He looked around. Perhaps if it were a full moon night, this plan would have worked better.
“What the—” Harry leaps back and glances upwards in time to see the swift form of a mechanical bird shoot back into the gable above.
“You only laugh because you are jealous,” Malfoy said, loftily. “You wish you had a study as nice as mine.”
“Smart thinking,” Malfoy murmurs. “That’s just where I would put them.” He’s stepping forward and motioning with his hands as he speaks. Hills nods his thanks and begins to walk in the direction indicated.
As soon as Harry’s feet hit ground, he released Malfoy’s hand. He could still feel the warmth against his skin. He rubbed his palm against his trouser leg. Malfoy noticed but didn’t say anything, only gave him a once-over as if to check that he was intact and then turned and strolled down the alley.
