That memory led to a small, silver wisp coming out of his wand. “Yes!” Harry exclaimed, pride beaming on his face. “I knew you could do it!”
“Yes, your entire family was. But the Ministry doesn’t appear to find you very threatening, else they would not have even offered that deal to your parents,” McGonagall said somewhat bitterly. “Mr. Malfoy, some leadership in the Ministry is under the impression that desperate times call for desperate measures. The struggle we’ve been facing for the past few decades did not end with the fall of Voldemort. There are still Death Eaters at large, the Ministry is not having success apprehending them, and so they feel the need to reassure the public that they are doing something. Hence, the hasty imprisonment of your parents.
“Like you would know what Parisans look like,” Draco said teasingly. “Don’t worry, I’ll take you there someday. Shall we?”
Putting his hand on the doorknob, Harry turned to face Draco. “We’ll see.” And with that he walked out the door.
Dean went next. He told Draco about his life on the run, how scared he was for his family. He told Draco how cold it was out in random forests, how it felt to watch his fellow companions get taken by Snatchers, some of them killed. Dean spoke of the hunger, the cold, the pain of knowing that his friends were at Hogwarts but were perhaps no safer than he was.
“You guys were out there a long time. What, are you becoming friends with Potter or something?” Blaise asked teasingly.
As if by an unspoken agreement, Narcissa and Draco remained silent throughout the car journey. They were both sitting in the backseat while the escort was in front, but they only touched hands once in a while and gave each other reassuring looks. It was hard to get out of the mindset that anything they said would be used against them. And Draco knew that his parents weren’t necessarily out of the woods yet, and may never be.  The journey to St. Mungo’s was brief, and they were escorted inside quickly. Unfortunately there were a few members of the Prophet waiting to snap a few pictures, but Narcissa ignored reporters’ calls, as did Draco.
Harry sat on the bed with Draco. “ I know you don’t want to talk about it, but I promise you it’ll help—“
Draco desperately wished that he could follow the others out of the shack. He knew for certain that a panic attack was coming on. He thought coming here would be the most anxiety-inducing part, but hearing everyone’s stories rattled him to his core, the shakes in his mind bringing up memories that he constantly fought to keep down. Dean Thomas hung back, but Weasley nodded him forward. Finally, it was just himself and Ginny alone in the shack. “I’m not sure I’ll ever forgive you, Malfoy,” she started. “But I guess we all have to move on somehow.”
Harry smiled. “I don’t think it will be bad. Come on—“ Harry offered Draco his hand. They walked inside, and Draco prepared to face the family he mocked for years.
Harry stopped in his tracks. “Oh, shite. You didn’t know? Yeah, the dagger killed him.” Draco nodded and was silent for a moment. He wasn’t quite...sad, because it had been years since he spoke to or even really thought about his longtime house-elf. But he also regretted that his previous playmate was brutally murdered in that way. “We buried him,” Harry continued. “Gave him a nice gravestone and everything. I can tell you where it is if you want to go visit him sometime.”
Even I couldn’t contain myself for that much longer. Can’t wait for these two to find out what they really need....As always comments are so loved and appreciated!
Harry looked into Draco’s eyes for a moment, as if to see if he really meant the apology. Then his face, red from stress, broke out into a smile. “I forgive you. Thank you for apologizing. I’m sure it must have been difficult to—“ Harry frowned and reached into his pocket.
Greg gave him a sad smile. “You never really let me, mate,” he said gently. “But now is the time to start fresh, at least with each other.”
“Dunno,” Draco said, feeling a little sick again. He recounted his afternoon, filling in gaps where rumors couldn’t supply his friends with the knowledge they wanted. The hard parts were not any easier to talk about than they were in Auror Yarney’s office, and he had to steel himself against the bedpost multiple times, trying to draw strength to finish speaking. When he finished his story, all his friends were looking forlornly at the ground.
“I wouldn’t really have a problem with you telling her, I suppose. But I don’t think there’s a reason to tell the kid,” he said nervously.
He must have fallen asleep and rather quickly too, because he silently jolted awake when the door to his compartment burst opened. The individual who disturbed him was breathing quickly and bolted the door—something Draco realized he should have done. The figure’s back was still turned to Draco, but he could nevertheless tell that it was none other than Harry Potter who had entered his compartment. Draco didn’t know how to react. Seeing Potter brought back memories that he didn’t want to relive—the Fiendfyre, when him and his friends were captured at Malfoy Manor. Draco was literally face-to-face with one of his nightmares.
He looked down at Harry, who was now dozing peacefully in his arms. Ginny Weasley was definitely right about one thing. His plans often had horrible, horrible consequences for innocent people that he never answered for. People were forgiving him really easily, but what had he actually done for others? There was no way he could drag Harry into this mess again. He needed to figure this out—not on his own, but by asking the right people for proper help.
“The car is here for you, Master Draco” Tilly said. Draco’s parents weren’t allowed to accompany him to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters this year. He was somewhat relieved. His parents hadn’t been out in public at all since the War ended, and neither had he. Over his months spent lounging around in apathy, he had imagined dozens of scenarios, dozens of possible reactions to his presence. In all of them, the response was infinitely better without his parents there.
Draco felt grass under his fingers and tasted vomit in his mouth. He was gasping and crying, the world swimming under his body. His left arm still hurt—he was not sure if he was injured, if the Dark Lord was summoning him once more, or if the pain was an echo. He was unbelievably cold despite the heat of his arm. As he became more aware of his surroundings, he noticed Potter’s voice and someone’s hand on his back. He was sitting up and Potter was next to him, apparently soothing him with nonsensical stories.
She leaned back in her chair. “Then I will not be able to let you continue to attend this school as a student.”
Then again, when was he ever good at scheming? His plans in sixth year had nearly killed two students unintentionally. Perhaps he could confide in his friends from Slytherin. Then again, they weren’t looked upon favorably by society as it was. He didn’t want to involve them unless it was absolutely necessary.
“That’s—that’s fair. If my grades suffer, I’ll go,” Draco said. He wasn’t sure he had ever had a conversation this long with Professor McGonagall, or this civil.
“Draco has been very good at Hogwarts. He even has made Harry Potter an ally,” Narcissa said proudly. At any other point Draco would be grateful for her defense of him, but he just cringed inwardly. If Lucius really did know about his relationship with Harry Potter, he had to do everything he could to not bring up the Boy Who Lived—a goal which was certainly unprecedented.
Pomfrey shook her head. “It’s vital that you both listen to me very closely. Seamus is the one who found Blaise, and he is the one who kept Blaise alive. It was Seamus’ magic my spells were reacting to, as if I were casting them on him instead.”
When she returned for a second glance, his expression was blank again, body rigid. It was as though he’d never moved.
Silence thudded through him. Surely not. But he knew that voice. Just the night before, it had uttered his name in a way he’d never, ever thought he would hear. Impossible to pretend it a dream. He suspected that he would only be granted nightmares from here on out anyway.
The next corridor was lined with thick pillars. They cast deep shadows, and Blaise moved more easily through them. He’d seen no one for hours. Hours of creeping, granted, moving far too slowly for his peace of mind. It was the all-too-probable consequences of carelessness that stopped Blaise from picking up the pace and kept the sweat running down his forehead at every turn in these endless hallways. If he didn’t know better, he would have counted this place deserted.
“I…” Harry flushed in sudden comprehension. Of course Dumbledore knew. If Luna knew, then Dumbledore knew; the castle itself probably knew his business by now, every stone and every portrait, even if most of its living denizens had no idea. And if he didn’t feel closer to Ginny, he certainly felt differently about Draco. Harry jerked his eyes away before the truth of it betrayed him. “Well.”
She was so long. She could easily have stretched halfway to him, nose to tail. Her middle was thick and powerful, clenching muscles, squeezing muscles. Blaise swallowed and tightened his grip on his wand.
That familiar and uncomfortable thing burned in Harry’s stomach. He peered at Seamus. “He’s—Seamus, what about your—”
“Do you think they can see this?” she asked, looking at the monoliths marching off into the darkness.
She held George’s hand, listened to Fred breathing, and wondered helplessly where her friends were at that moment.
Hermione stumbled toward the sound of Luna’s voice, legs weary to the point of collapse. The wind pushed at her and she looked up to find nothing but barren fields and clouds. Picturesque at any other moment, but Hermione could only moan at the vast emptiness.
Draco tore his mouth away and pushed hard, finally gaining space between them. His stomach felt uncomfortably hollow. Was there a point somewhere back in the past when he hadn’t felt dread? He couldn’t remember.
He’d been crying; it was in his voice. Stress, then. She could hardly blame him. She felt numb throughout, and knew it was only a matter of time before the events of the day caught up and tried to drown her.
Seamus broke away long enough to tilt his head toward Blaise’s ear. His lips moved soundlessly—who could hear a thing over this music?—and Blaise’s hand found Seamus’, lifting it from where it rested against his side and settling it on his knee instead. Their fingers wove together and before long, their heads were bent and they were entirely involved in each other’s mouths again.
Hermione picked up the brush balanced against the lip and proceeded to painstakingly mark over the blue in bloody red streaks: more knots, but jagged this time, full of sharp angles and jagged hashes that looked as though they were trying to leap off Morag’s skin. Finally she straightened, took one last appraisal, and turned to the rest of them. “If you have your wands on you, I need you to give them to me, just for a moment.”
“Draco,” she started. His head lifted sharply, expression smoothed with surprise. Ginny licked her lips, his first name tasting foreign on her tongue. “Why did Harry pick you to do this?”
When they reached the last step, Luna pressed her palm flat to the wall and held it there. The air vibrated. Oliver halted, holding Luna at the physical edge of her domain.
Harry’s gaze sharpened alarmingly. He came quickly toward her, until she thought she’d have to step back to avoid collision. “They knew you were with Draco?”
touch Draco. He could hear his own breath hitching, feel himself gripping too tightly, and suddenly Draco squeezed his arms, and Harry burst out, “You don’t need to do th—”
Draco shook his head. He wiped the blood from Theodore’s lips, the rivulets sliding down his cheeks into dark hair. The front of Theodore’s drenched shirt was a widening stain, turning his skin ashen in comparison. It didn’t look real, any of it.
“No, go on. If it will settle some sliver of guilt in your oh-so-noble heart, then by all means, unburden yourself.” He was sneering; he was so angry his vision had sharpened and now the shadows were endless and Harry stood out like a glowing beacon.
Dumbledore folded his hands. Harry could still feel the familiar, impenetrable gaze of his former instructor, as if the man were flesh and blood sitting in the room next to him. “Ah, yes. Mr Malfoy.” He leaned forward slightly. “You regret his part in all of this?”
And there was the old chill, creeping back in. Perhaps there was no longer a way to separate the two. “No, I’m afraid not.”
And—a last nail pounding in—there were things Harry felt for Draco that he did not feel for Ginny. There were things he—he
“Could he have cast some sort of protection over himself?” Moody growled. “Something to keep him going for long enough to escape? A form of Vivacis or Durabilis?”
Abruptly, it was too hard to think of Draco Malfoy. He felt as though Nott were standing over his shoulder, clinging to his branches. He’d hardly even known the man. Harry sought for Ginny’s face in his mind instead. He spun her out like silk: fiery strands of hair, the smatter of freckles, and the smile he remembered, the one that flickered like light and shone like gold. His heartbeat slowed. The room filled with stillness and the strains of Luna’s voice rising in another song, and if he thought about it hard enough, he could almost smell Ginny’s rose perfume.
die for you. This is going to work and then where will we be? Where will I be? I hope it’s far away, somewhere where I don’t have to see any of this, where I don’t have to cart women into your arms so you can save the bloody world! I don’t fucking care anymore, not about this world, not about you, or your spells or your perfect war—”
her now, in love with someone who didn’t feel the same. Fuck it all, the bond would be the same broken shell, even if he did want it with all his heart.
He couldn’t think. Couldn’t make sense of it. It was an endless knot, one he had tied himself, and kept tightening because the inner loops were just too raw. Theodore was in there, tangled hopelessly with Harry, buried underneath him, dead, bloody, shoved aside like a broken Remembrall, and hurting so deeply.
it? Say it out loud for everyone to hear and judge? Admit it, admit it, say what he’d done, what he’d made them all—Not the fucking bond, the bond had nothing to do with it, this was—
Blaise reached out and tugged Ginny’s cloak gently, but it was Seamus who spoke. “Gin, be careful what you say about… Remember, it’s still Malfoy.”
Oh gods, what was this? What was he doing? This didn’t feel like him, he couldn’t fight it or control it or even tamp it down, it was using his body without his permission—
Draco stood at the side of the bed staring down at Harry, and did not move or speak. Harry wanted to look away, but he knew he couldn’t break this moment as he had so many others. He owed it to Blaise and to Seamus, and to Draco, to own up to what he’d done.
And after today, Blaise would be finishing his own mission. The end of the war was marching ever nearer. Harry rubbed his face, breathing as slowly as he could manage.
Harry studied his hands for a long moment, feeling the silence press. “It’s been over a year,” he said. “I’m sure they’ve been together for over a year.” He grimaced at Pomfrey. “What does this have to do with anything?”
Blaise and Seamus’ arrival had lent a new melancholy to his sleep and what he saw there. Woven moments from past days and words in gibberish that his dream-self always seemed to understand… Eventually their banality gave way to the chilly void that took control of his mind just before he woke. It was a companion waiting in a line of dreams to speak to him, but always, always finding him at least once before the morning light.
Harry’s brow shuttered. “What are you talking about? This isn’t about guilt, this is about gratitude. For risking your life.”
Her vision returned first in sparks, and then random shimmers. She could hear emptiness, the hollow sound of open land, but she had no idea where she was. In a few seconds she would see it. Hopefully she would be alone.
she thought as they skirted along the ridge. She certainly wasn’t going to be one. Who gave a flying fuck if Malfoy wanted to sacrifice his happiness for Harry Potter? It was only one half of the equation anyway, and there was no way to know what Harry’s feelings on the matter were. Martyrs had cast themselves over the proverbial cliff for less; a one-sided love affair was hardly new to the cause.
For once, Harry couldn’t find any tears of his own. He felt utterly drained, his mind a ball of stone. Seamus crossed the grass ahead on dragging feet, as though he were marching toward a cliff’s edge. Harry had the sudden and startling thought that Seamus had already plunged over that edge, that he would just continue to walk and walk, right out of Luna’s extended shield and into the war’s wasteland. If Seamus was already gone inside, what was the use of his body coming back?
A bedraggled, motionless woman was revealed. Brown hair long and tangled, skin disturbingly pale. Her eyes were too empty, almost filmed over, and Harry’s gut rolled before he realised what, and who, he was really seeing.
“Harry.” Hermione’s arm came around his shoulders. He found her eyes trained on him. The warmth in their depths soothed. “Don’t jump the gun. He’ll be all right. He will. We’ve done everything we can, and it’s going to pay off.”
The words fuelled an anger they shouldn’t have; Harry heard accusation there and didn’t care that it was his own accusation against himself. He jerked away from the table, seeking some way to release the sudden gust of energy.
But Draco didn’t move any further. It was as though he’d lost the will to follow through. Or maybe—Harry peered at him sharply, at his flushed face and kiss-reddened mouth. Draco’s eyes slid shut, and for just a moment, his body clenched around Harry.
Pomfrey sighed. She looked incredibly old. “I’m sure that’s not the case, not truly. He may be dreaming, or this may all be backlash, trying to create some sort of equilibrium and not being able to do so because of Mr Zabini’s absence.”
“But you are, Harry,” she cried. “You’re going to put the entire plan in limbo over Draco Malfoy? You hardly know him!” Her expression twisted into something horrible. “You’ll put your own life in danger, and mine and Ginny’s, and everyone’s, just so you can have some inconsequential—”
“Very astute, Harry, as usual.” Dumbledore nodded approvingly. “There were other factors. Your choice in partners after Ms Weasley was something you kept from many people, but not from me.”
He’d worked hard for it, months ago. It was the only time he’d really gotten to know Potter, listening to the strange sentences flowing from his throat, copying the timbre and stress to memory. He still had no idea what he was saying, but Potter had taught him two sentences. Only two.
Blaise allowed himself a last, pain-dulled look, and then turned, drawing on every reserve he had. Just drop the ward, and then Apparition was not out of the question… if he could only
Death Eaters. He frowned at the stars. It was colder up north. Snow and ice, frozen lands with an even icier heart, because somewhere beneath the earth, they were there.
Hermione moved around the edge of a pile of rubble, intent on reaching the end of the street. She was almost level with the pile when the clouds above parted again, letting a slice of starlight through onto the street below. Hermione glanced up, smiling at the glittering points of light. She allowed herself a brief moment. Rain spattered in thick drops onto her head and hands, and she looked down to avoid the rubble—
No. It didn’t matter who Harry might have taken to his bed. This was still Draco Malfoy, and she was a long way from believing that six years of rivalry had succumbed to two years of desperation. It did not work like that. Harry had standards and Draco would have to have done something drastic to meet them. Coming over to the Order’s side wouldn’t have been enough and that wasn’t just her hope talking. She still understood Harry Potter, in all the important ways.
As expected, everyone then turned to stare at him. Harry kept his eyes on Hermione, and she cleared her throat, tapping the yellow jar again.
“You fucking bastard!” Draco hit him, a solid punch to the shoulder, another to his ribs. Harry would have staggered backward if not for the renewed hold Draco had on his shirt. “No! Not on your damned life, I’m not going to—
It had been months since Harry had seen his former schoolmate. He could picture every tiny worry-line marring that pale skin, every downward twitch of Malfoy’s lips as if the man were cast in a portrait alongside Dumbledore. Harry couldn’t remember the last time he’d ever seen that face without the lines, or that mouth shaped into anything but a twist. Merlin knew there had been little enough to warrant any other expression. Years ago, perhaps, Malfoy had smirked, even smiled. But it seemed a dream. Everything, from the moment Draco Malfoy had stepped back into Harry’s life, dragging his loss into the light behind him, seemed like a dream.
At least her pursuer had been forced to Apparate as many times as she; his eyes would be playing tricks on him as well, and perhaps, gods, perhaps he hadn’t been able to catch the tail end of her magic this time.
Draco took a deep breath and listened to himself exhale. The library was devoid of other people, though there were signs that someone had been there recently. The peg-hollows pressed into the faded carpet were obviously Moody’s. There were shoe depressions of varying sizes, and even the mark of bare feet. Draco was tempted to remove his own shoes, to sink toes into the carpet and perhaps even sink himself there. To breathe the dusty scent of books and peace for as long as he was able.
“Then maybe they did know,” Ginny murmured. Her blue eyes were troubled. They darted across the room, fixing briefly on the person standing there. Hermione looked too and saw Draco Malfoy shift his weight fitfully. She glanced at Harry and noticed a resigned twist to his lips.
The fire flared as Kingsley opened the door, ushering the group inside. They all squeezed in around the table in the room, looking expectantly at their newest arrival.
“He’s planning things. It’s been busy, what with Moody and Kingsley. Hermione Granger came in earlier. Remus Lupin, so of course Harry’s been to see him. And he’s been t—” She stuttered. “Talking to Draco.”
Had he come this far, through the deaths of his parents and this infernal mess of a war, only to—he shut down the thought before it could gain momentum. Gods, it was
Her attention wandered again. What had she been thinking about a second ago? Well, it was gone now, whatever it was. To wherever thoughts went to take the piss. Hermione snickered to herself. The crackling of the fire and the splitting of the large logs pulsed heat into the hall. Hermione thought she’d never seen the room so brightly lit. But the firelight wasn’t reaching everywhere. She squinted, not caring that she was blatantly staring.
She didn’t know what Hannah had told them. But it had been a trap. A Dark Mark woven into Hannah’s very flesh, set to erupt at the slightest touch. Perhaps rigged for Hermione’s specific touch. She pressed her hands over her face. They couldn’t have set it for her, could they? Did they know her that well?
There were other versions, just as disturbing. Some nights, Harry Potter stood there and watched him fail to act, or watched as he raised his wand and struck Dumbledore down in an eruption of green light. Those were the nights Draco woke without breath, feeling as if all the eyes in what was left of this miserable, rotting world were fixed upon him. To be observed at such a forlorn moment, to wake clenching his wand in shaking fingers, not knowing which spells had actually burst out of that wand and which spells were the fanciful leanings of nightmare.
All he seemed to do was put people in harm’s way, as a baby, then many times as a teenager, and finally, now, at the end of it all.
She let it go. It was piss-poor and disappointing to him as well. He just didn’t know how to face her with Draco’s scent and sensation still clinging to his skin.
Seamus inched up further on the bed, tucking himself around Blaise, snugging his body as close as he could. He threaded one hand through Blaise’s hair and sighed, long and low.
something was wrong, several very big things were wrong. Humans obviously weren’t meant for this magic. It had the power to eat them alive. Him and Lovegood and Finnigan, and if Blaise had survived—
“All right, when I say, we’re running, down the hall to the side doors, where you exit for Herbology. Don’t stop, don’t wait for us, just get the kids out, we’ll be right behind you.”
It was never enough to let a person walk away, still breathing. But it was enough to let him walk away with his dignity intact. Harry was the only one in the room, save Remus, perhaps, who would not be tempted to destroy Malfoy in such a personal way.
“Sending one person out is the option that risks the fewest people,” Moody countered. “It doesn’t matter if they’ve been in the castle. They’ll never be able to direct Death Eaters back, not even under Veritaserum. But
Harry carefully encircled Draco’s wrist with his fingers and Draco shuddered again. His own accompanying tremor did not feel so unsettled this time. “Getting better?” Harry asked.
said. And believe me, I watched her. But nothing else ever came up, so I figure she caught a stray spell. Unless their ultimate dastardly plan is to keep us all from casting any verbal spells at all. Death Eaters aren’t perfect, you know.”
“She’s not dead. Not Hermione. They’re not...” One of his hands climbed through his hair. “What does Draco say?”
“Then why did it feel like I—” Draco didn’t finish the sentence. Harry was struck suddenly by the memory of Draco in pain, on the bed beneath him and babbling nonsense, grasping for him and yet curling away like it burned to touch.
They followed him into the dining room, but in the end, it was Dean who removed Katie from Malfoy’s vicinity, guiding her up the stairs with a hand on her shoulder. Harry could hear her spitting angry responses to his low tones as they receded into the darkness. He turned from Sloper, not caring for the sullen twist of his features.
Draco’s head was already shaking, shaking. He caught Theodore’s face between both hands, wiping at his chin with his thumbs.
Luna said clearly in Harry’s head. The urgency was unfamiliar; Luna had never once expressed such anxiety to him, Siren’s Ward or not. Harry staggered, banged into the stone wall, and nearly fell. Hermione dragged him up again, but Harry’s sight gave a lurch that spun the hallway right round. Down at the end of it, someone came into view at a full run and a cord snapped taut, dragging Harry upright. Hermione hissed and let go of his arm, but then Harry had him, had Draco—Draco who had just crossed the entire castle—skin to skin, his face in Harry’s hands, his breath against Harry’s mouth.
The squirrelly feeling in her gut flared and died away again. It had been a constant companion ever since she’d left Seamus and Blaise, but the past two nights, she had barely noticed. Now a nagging prickle made her peer harder at the tree line, peek over her shoulder into the void behind.
Harry closed the bed hangings, the grating around the fireplace, and then the door behind him, leaving the room to its shadows. He walked the halls to his own chamber in flickering silence.
“I can’t.” He hung his head. It seemed so pointless, here at death’s door, to keep secrets from his last friend. “Do you know what I’ve done, Blaise?”
“The only way I can see it working is if we craft the protection spell so that it tailors itself to Draco’s magic. Uniquely.” And she stopped. Stared at them.
“That’s where these other singers come in,” Minerva answered. Clearly she’d prepared this. And then kept it from all of them. Harry was again assaulted by the thought of all the things he didn’t—
“I couldn’t figure it out,” she said softly. “Not even a year ago. And it was all right there for me to see, wasn’t it? All this time, we’ve…”
The silence afterward was a beat in Harry’s ears. He trembled, appalled at his admission and deliriously fearful of the response it would receive. When Remus didn’t say anything, just stared at him with sorrow all over his face, Harry turned away. Almost immediately, the weight of what he’d said hit him, thunked down on his shoulders and sobered the anger right out of him. He blinked rapidly at the wall, a heavy heat in his throat.
His friend’s eyes were wide. They darted over him and Draco wondered what Blaise was searching for. Whether or not he found it. Whether he himself was strong enough to provide it.
He must have sobbed it; Hermione struggled off the wall and wrapped her arms around him, rocking him as the rest broke free. Harry cried, snotty and wet into her sweater, until his face was a mess and his eyes burned. He clung to her tightly enough to hurt his bones, but it was so hard to let her go.
“Give Harry and Luna my best,” he whispered. When they pulled apart, he stepped back and crossed his arms over his chest. Ginny turned away. Malfoy’s gaze was on her as she approached, leaving her face only when Blaise embraced him in farewell. It was the first emotion she saw cross those stark features, and it was gone as soon as Blaise released him.
Blaise stood there, frozen, only to be wrenched out of it again by the sound of running feet. He flattened himself against the wall, ducking into a deep shadow caused by a column and the scantly placed torches, but he knew if Goyle came close enough, he would be seen.
Seamus looked at her, feeling empty. She waved her wand in gentle sweeps. The silver glow changed gradually, turning a ghostly purple and bathing the Healer’s face. Her eyes widened, and suddenly Seamus was looking at a face full of sorrow. Of awe. She laid a thin hand on his arm.
Harry flexed his hips forward gently. Steadily. Draco’s hands tensed around handfuls of sheet. His head fell loosely back to the bed, and the burning in Harry’s belly flickered up out of the depths.
Harry laughed again; Hermione could always pick out the sound, zero in on it like some kind of beacon. Maybe because he laughed so infrequently. He always had, even when they were children just starting out at the doors of this very castle. Even back when he’d had something to smile about, he rarely ever
He hadn’t followed her. Yes, and maybe the world had stopped spinning around the sun, too. Hermione had stopped indulging such a fantasy. One day ago, to be exact. This Death Eater was too good. He’d abandoned the rest of his colleagues in order to keep up with her Apparition, and even the constant switching between her wand and Ginny’s had not derailed him. Hermione dug into her pack and pulled out Ginny’s wand anyway, shoving her own into its place. If nothing else, she could continue to convince him that there were two of them instead of just her, alone in the shrouded hills.
It was cold and dark when something swept through the castle. Harry jolted awake, arms full of Draco’s naked warmth, the shallow breaths of his lover fluttering against his shoulder. He could hear it, in the stones and the air, between the sleepy hissing of the fire’s coals. A song, a tune, but… not.
Neville twitched as if he might go after Seamus anyway, just throw it all to the wind and… go. His mouth hardened, then went slack again. Whatever he saw in Harry’s face, Harry didn’t know, but he was grateful for the result.
Ginny chewed her lip. And found Malfoy watching her again. Had he asked her a question? She couldn’t be sure; she’d been so lost in her thoughts. “What?”
It was one thing to kill Voldemort. As ugly a deed as that might be, Harry had no doubt that he’d find the incentive. Especially now, with the world half gone.
The offering was full of pain, and that was what made it so hard to hear. Remus wasn’t used to it; he was saying that nobody could ever be used to it. The spark of Harry’s ire exploded.
Blaise came to a turn and stopped. He pressed against the wet wall and listened. Nothing but the dripping. He peered around the corner. Another empty corridor, eerie in yellowish light. There were no pillars this time, just the sweating walls. He drew a breath and went down the hall at a silent run, feeling the vulnerability of each step as though it were a stutter in his heart.
He perched on one of the ancient stone banisters at the bottom of the staircase. The air rippled more fervently as the newcomer passed through the second level of Luna’s ward, and Harry felt the vibration of the final threshold—just outside the doors—in the marrow of his bones. It had been some time since he’d felt another person’s arrival.
“If only everyone could see how hot you look right now.” He teased, burrowing his head into the neck of the brunette, kissing his jawline.
As Harry walked back to the Gryffindor common room, he couldn’t help but smile. It was like he had found a new reason to come back to Hogwarts, a reason to go on even though he was being hunted, a reason not to give up hope. He had found something special, something that meant a lot to him and that he could tell meant a lot to Draco as well. The next time he went up to the astronomy tower, fuck work, he would be with Draco the entire time.
When he woke the next morning, Draco Malfoy was the first thing on his mind. Was he flirting with him yesterday?! Despite his long lasting hatred towards the blond, Harry felt as though he still felt other things for him as well. Maybe after all this time, this was Draco’s way of showing he returned those feelings. Harry decided he would have to start a conversation. No relationship ever got anywhere when you just stared at each other and did nothing about it. When he saw Draco already in the library, he couldn’t help but feel nervous.
The next day in Divination was the final day before the astronomy tower. Then they would be up there for two days. The two boys were frantically trying to come up with some sort of research to make up for the days they had spent distracted. That's when he noticed the dark mark on Draco’s arm.
“I don’t want to go.” Ron moaned. “She is miserable.” Harry dragged him up to the classroom. They sat at the last empty table, then Professor Trelawney walked through the curtain.
Draco climbed the stairs to the top of the tower. He had been thinking about this moment over and over in his mind and still didn’t know what on earth he was going to say. In the end, he saw Harry, with the stars framing his face and green eyes sparkling and had become speechless. Harry turned and smiled at him. Draco regained the ability to speak, sort of.
“That sounds like a great idea.” he agreed. “My name is Draco Malfoy, but call me Draco.” He said, still smiling. This was going better that Harry thought it would.
“If only we could continue this all night…” Harry began almost like he wanted to forget what he was about to say next. “...but we do have a project.” The two reluctantly got up and walked over to where they had left their bags. They rolled out a piece of parchment on the table Professor Trelawney had left there. Despite the fact that there were two chairs, Draco sat down in one, only to have Harry sit on top of him and kiss him. Draco did not want to stop kissing him, but they had to do this project. Their lips parted reluctantly as they looked down at the parchment. A few hours later, they were staring down at a chart of stars that they had drawn onto the parchment. Draco sighed and rested his free hand onto Harry’s thigh. Harry, who was still sitting on Draco’s lap, kissed his neck again. Then it all made sense. Harry was the boy with the green eyes, but he had known that for a long time. His demise was his downfall, but not the downfall in the way he had guessed. It was the downfall of his pride, of his invisable barrier to try and not fall in love, the downfall of the fake Draco, who was a death eater, who was not gay, who was a bully. Now he could just accept all of his flaws openly and not give a fuck what everyone else thought. He grabbed Harry and pulled him to his lips, sliding his tongue into his mouth. They kissed so passionately, they almost fell from the chair. This was it. Draco Malfoy was not going to be his father, he was going to be himself.
She longed for the days before, when she hadn’t known that Harry had slept with Draco, or how deeply Draco’s feelings for her intended went. When she was just nervous and excited by the prospect of knowing Harry intimately again, of seeing the end of this war in sight at last. Blaise and Seamus with her by the fire, sharing food and telling stories, awaiting the next turn of the road, the next step in whatever plan was being hatched for them all. It was just a game then, and everyone was alive and healthy and together. Scattered physically, but together somehow in a way they weren’t any longer. She knew it was stupid, that people had been dying left and right no matter what she understood about Harry and Draco’s relationship, but at least she’d felt safe.
It was so beside the point that Harry had to laugh. So he did. Hermione jerked her hand off his arm as if he’d burnt her, and stared at him like he’d gone insane. Maybe he had. But there was something else in her expression that boiled his blood, brought the untapped anger straight to the surface.
“But you did care for him, Draco.” Blaise stroked the back of his hand with his thumb. “Even if… it wasn’t the way he wanted you to. You were his friend.”
All at once, a figure turned the corner. Blaise stopped, his heart slamming up into his throat, but it was too late. The person froze, robes swishing around him. Blaise saw the wand in the man’s right hand, the voluminous black of velvet, and features he knew all too well.
They all had a vested interest in this, and Harry had not attempted to keep them out. Whatever came of it, whatever was spoken under the cold light of truth, it was best they hear it for themselves.
“I’ve been touching him the whole time!” Seamus cried. “I haven’t let go once. I can feel him pulling himself up!”
He leaned on her suddenly and she fell on her back with the heat of his body pressed against her chest. With a flurry of grunting and cursing, Ron got his shirt half off, then gave up and gathered her to him. Hermione sank down with his mouth over hers, drifting into a haze of plush pillows and freckles. One of his hands stroked her face and throat; the other slid down her leg and up it again, climbing under the loose skirt. His palm was wide on her thigh and it felt so much like it belonged there. He paused at the juncture of her hip and leg and squeezed the sensitive skin there. She pressed up against him, shivering, finding his tongue with hers and just… kissing him.
“Do you…” She struggled to find a proper segue, not sure why it was important to give Malfoy this moment. “What exactly is the spell Luna’s using?”
“Is he breathing alright?” Her wand had paused over Blaise’s side and steady white light was pulsing into him with a disorienting grinding sound.
“She says we have to wait for McGonagall,” Hermione said tiredly. Harry said nothing in response, because who knew where Minerva McGonagall was at that moment? Who knew whether she still had the scrolls and maps she had pulled out of Grimmauld Place when that hideout had finally failed them? Harry felt as he had when Luna had informed him of Draco and Ginny’s imminent departure for the castle: stuck doing nothing to speed things along. All any of them could do was wait, and hope that Luna could discover the whereabouts of their former Deputy Headmistress.
It was George who kept waking and drifting, unable to remain asleep for the fever, and then unable to stand the light when his eyes opened.
“Sudden. He wouldn’t let me heal him. I could have, if only—” Fred rubbed a hand over his eyes. Ginny stroked the mussed hair from his forehead. He hadn’t bathed yet and she could see the filth in rivulets on his flesh.
Something lurked behind the grey, words or thoughts, Harry couldn’t tell, but they had not been uttered, even in the gentling sunset through his windows. Draco’s body sprawled across Harry’s bed, limbs entangled in and against Harry’s, and yet oddly separate.
She nodded erratically, eyes unfocussed and aimed at the floor some ways in front of her. Her mouth opened, but the sound that issued from it broke across the note. Harry looked around, waiting for some sign of falling wards, of… something, and in that instant, Luna’s fingers dug hard and fast into his flesh. She stared straight at him, eyes watering.
He tugged his aching eyes away from the impenetrable gloom, and turned his face up to the rain. As before, he did not feel cleansed. He would only feel that once he’d reached their destination and given over his charge. Then perhaps he could just wash himself of this whole mistake.
“Good. Tell Lovegood to start calling them all back tomorrow, then. It’s time we brought them home.”
But even that thought was repugnant now. The suspicion made her feel unclean. Ashamed. She’d seen real fear in his eyes; it had driven extra force into her swing, sparking hotly through her and leading her to slam a branch into the head of another person. For all she knew, she’d killed the girl. For Malfoy.
Ginny nodded shakily. She took two deep breaths, and then her gaze moved past him. She gave a sharp cry and lurched backward, clapping a hand over her mouth. Draco’s grip on her other wrist caught her, tumbling her onto her side in the grass. Draco whipped around and found himself a foot away from a Death Eater.
“Yes, but what did you do to it?” Neville glanced around at all of them. “I’ve cultivated the plants that can make these dyes, but they don’t do
At last, he became aware of Ginny’s breathing. It had changed from desperate hitches to a slow, shuddery heave. Draco felt her hand twitch under his own. She squeezed his arm.
The rain hammered against the wards over the windows, springing away in tiny spatters. The sky outside was the colour of soot.
In a last ditch effort that should have occurred to him first, he appealed to Luna, only to find that she’d been trying from the moment she was able.
Draco paled. “I know about it,” he muttered. “Blaise told me what happened out there. What he had to do.”
He didn’t want to cry again; it hurt, it fucking burned holes through him and he was afraid he didn’t have enough solid body left to hold together anymore.
Blaise fell to the side, kicking out and making contact with something. He heard her hiss; something clamped around his ankle with incredible force, and then, more fire. Blaise’s mind toppled. He snapped his other leg around, catching her square in the jaw. There was a terrible popping noise, as of small bones. The serpent rolled along the floor, her body jerking uncontrollably.
“If anyone can find him, it’ll be Seamus,” Ginny said stiffly. Hermione looked sharply at her friend, as sharply as her aching head would allow. Beside her, Madam Pomfrey clucked warningly.
So close. She wasn’t ready to deal with this sad little triangle yet. But in mere hours, she would be shoved right into it.
“I’m telling you, she’ll do it. She’s got more control over that thing than any of us know. She was just in there healing Hermione alongside Madam Pomfrey!”
But he’d said nothing about her disregard for his orders. Ginny fidgeted. Was he grateful? He’d been relieved at the time; there was no other name for it. But given the opportunity to think about it, to remember…
The war had already sucked away two of his best friends. It was poetic justice that he, the one who had dragged them all into it, go next.
The remains of the door blasted apart in a rain of wood and iron. Millicent spun around. Already her face was masking itself, fingers tightening around her wand. But her fear was apparent. A dark figure shoved through the splintered doorway into the room. Blaise had an impression of glittering eyes fixating on him before Millicent stepped forward.
“Oh, yes,” Draco seethed, “your precious bond. I know all about it. Weasley isn’t exactly tight-lipped when she’s gloating.”
Huge chunks of masonry were missing from the walls. Jagged holes and spirit-blue flames eating into bare stone as though it were wood. Doors knocked completely off their hinges and window glass strewn across the floor. An entire length of the main staircase lay in a heap of rubble in the atrium, and Hermione forced her eyes away before she could start finding limbs trapped beneath. The front doors were blocked by toppled stone.
Both of Moody’s eyes swivelled to him. Harry met his gaze. “Don’t worry, Alastor. The last one needs to be dealt with at a certain time, and only then. That’s all.”
Blaise confirmed the still-empty hallway over his shoulder and hunkered down next to the closed door. No visible signs of spellwork. He pulled out his wand and gripped it. If the hissing hadn’t called her, then this would. With all the inherent magic in this section, the Death Eaters might not feel such a tiny spell, but a snake would sense the change in pressure, no matter how slight.
“Draco,” Harry murmured, and Draco shot such utter loathing into him that it was all he could do not to sick up. His insides had dried out. He didn’t think he’d fully understood what was staring him in the face until this moment.
Blaise had not said a word about what was happening; he didn’t need to. Seamus felt each internal failure as it occurred: his leg muscles, liver, stomach. Blaise’s heart tripped on. His lungs heaved in time to some inner rhythm. Seamus felt each breath as it came and went.
Harry leaned close to Malfoy again, so near hat he could see the separation of fine blond strands falling over his ear. His voice shook, just a little. “In Conwy, Draco. Why were you hiding from Voldemort?”
“It will be.” Oh, yes. It would be. Dumbledore had spent a great deal of time convincing him of what was required of him, back when his portrait still hung in the Headmistress’ office at Hogwarts. Harry massaged the bridge of his nose.
A spasm crossed Oliver’s face. “They’re… managing. Still living their lives as normal. Salazar, some
How long had Hannah been alive while Hermione snuck around in the dark and the rain? Had she answered their questions? How much had she been able to divert, to keep silent? How many lies had she convinced them of?
Hermione leaned against a tilting slab of wall and rubbed her arms, peering out from her pocket of shadow into the street beyond. Where was Hannah?
His head hurt. The ache whispered through his dreams like a dark spirit, and he could feel Seamus there as well, circling the pain, stroking at his mind with slow fingers. For long moments, Seamus was beside him, and he thrashed out, reaching, to find the bed empty and himself not even certain he’d moved. Perhaps he had dreamt it all.
Harry blinked twice, then folded his arms back around her. “Thank the gods,” he sighed. “I was afraid—”
Harry frowned. It was odd seeing the expression from such a low angle. Seamus inhaled and felt rather than saw Blaise’s chest rise.
“Yes,” she replied. “I no longer believe that the periods of… restfulness, as we have termed them, are a sign of healing. His blood work and the results of the tests…” She inhaled deeply. “Each time, his body seems to slow down even more than the previous time. I know I told you that it was a good sign. I thought it was. But the crash that always follows has only been growing deeper. He’s searching for something he cannot find.”
Blaise studied him. Something new shadowed his eyes. “I won’t drag him along with me, if that’s what you—”
Ginny looked away. “It was all right. You know?” Blaise swivelled his head to look at her, and she ploughed ahead. “I mean… Malfoy. Liking Harry. Wanting… Harry. I didn’t care, it didn’t make a bit of difference, only—”
She ate a handful of granola. It had gone stale already. Damn this weather. It sucked the taste out of everything.
A vague sort of panic throbbed at Hermione’s nerves. She squinted, and the ache rolling in her skull expanded. Ginny was looking at her, eyes wide with concern.
Harry tilted his head. “I want to thank you for bringing her here safely. I know you didn’t have to do it. There’s no way I can properly express my gratitude. But I…” His shoulders twitched. “We wanted to thank you.”
He didn’t even pause, just wheeled around and led her up the next stairwell. The boys’ rooms. Just around the first bend in the staircase, a group of students in pyjamas clustered on the landing, hugging the wall and each other. They stared down at Ron and Hermione from the darkness.
But Ginny just looked sicker. And Harry felt sicker. He massaged his forehead with his fingers. He was utterly at a loss over what to do next.
His eyes opened again on their own. Blaise swam up into consciousness as though surfacing from a dark, dank lake. He blinked. Sunlight streamed in shafts through the dusty windows. The warmth of the room was almost overwhelming; he knew without thinking that to move would upset the balance, make him too hot. Blaise inhaled. Exhaled. Became aware of an indefinable ache. He touched his temple with one hand. No longer his head aching. Seamus’ arm was a limp, sleepy mass around his middle. He rubbed over his lover’s fingers. Seamus did not even twitch.
Draco’s hand fluttered helplessly; his fingers tightened around Theodore’s already loose collar, slid over his rain-slicked cheek. “Grimmauld. I can Apparate us both.”
But even then, Harry welcomed it. He had to get away from himself. His sleep was growing worse. The depth made no difference; he recognised the dark, cold silence that had been growing as the months ticked along. Only the one night he’d spent curled around Draco, moving and touching—the sleep afterward—had been vacant of Voldemort’s desolate tug at his gut.
Suddenly it was impossible to be that close to Harry. Draco put a few feet between them, and Harry stopped.
She stopped at last and looked at him. Her shoulders were hunched, eyes narrowed. Draco paid it no mind. It really was inconsequential. He shrugged off his pack, sweeping the cloak from his shoulders. “We’ll sleep here.”
“Seamus, are you…” Harry leaned toward his friend, worried for an entirely different reason. “You’re sick. You’re sick, too.”
“I know,” she cut him off. “You think I’m blind, that I can’t feel it changing this entire place?” Her head twitched to the side as though she were pulling herself up short. “I didn’t come here for that. I came here for Seamus.”
don’t. Just.” Harry pulled Draco tight to his body and devoured his mouth. His hands razed over Draco as though trying to pull him in. Draco’s mind tumbled, his head going light and dizzy. He could do nothing except cling to Harry, cling and realise that his body hadn’t in fact had enough and was again spiralling toward arousal.
“Shut up and tell me where she is!” the girl shrieked at him. Draco did wince then. Surely the sound would bring the rest. He found the figure in the forest again. Black cloak, and something dangling from one side, like a bulbous limb.
“It's like you’ve read my mind, Potter.” The two rolled onto the floor, robes flying off as their hands grabbed at each other’s shirts and lips clashing together in the dark of night. Draco practically ripped Harry’s shirt off of his body. The feeling of bare skin touching made them go faster. Harry’s hands trembled on the zipper of Draco’s pants, pulling it down. Before Harry could fully realize what was happening, his clothes were pulled off of him, then Draco’s gentle weight was back on him, pushing him down onto the floor. Their bare skin was pressing into each other with only the warm air in between them. Harry could feel the other boy’s hands searching his body and feeling the shape of him. Every inch of them was pressed into the other and the smooth feeling of skin was making Harry breathless. Pulling away, Draco lifted his hand to Harry’s mouth.
There was no one else he could think of besides Harry Potter. How would he wind up liking Harry Potter. He had just rejected Draco’s friendship yesterday and now this? Well, at least that would make his new task easier. All he had to do was make sure Potter hated him, that way there would be no chance of this coming true.
“What?” Draco looked confused, then he looked down at his mark. “Oh.” he said softly, a tear came from his eye. “No, I won’t try to kill you. I was forced to become a death eater. I did not want to be.” Harry felt a pang of guilt. Poor Draco had been forced by his parents to become a death eater and now he was just bringing up memories of it.
“Hullo, I’m Harry Potter, but I go by Harry.” They shook hands and the two burst out laughing. Madam Prince, the librarian, gave them a sharp glare and the laughter faded to a small giggle.
“I know.” Harry agreed. “Qudditch is so much better than Divination!” The two became engrossed in a new conversation that lasted the rest of the period. They came out of the library still talking about which teams were the best and their favorite players. Then Harry snapped back to reality. They separated and he went to go join his friends at lunch. Now he knew for sure he liked Draco Malfoy. He could be funny, and nice once you opened up to him a bit.
When Draco heard that the ‘famous Harry Potter’ had been treated like a house elf for most of his life, it shocked him. It also made the boy he had grown to care for more human and more real. He felt anger towards anyone who dared treat him that way. He was shocked by how much he cared about Harry. Then came that magical moment when Harry’s lips met his. He couldn’t forget how free and happy he felt in that single moment. It had left him with hope. Maybe he didn’t have to follow what his father wanted for him. Maybe Harry could take him away from all of that. He felt an urge to continue this at any cost. Tomorrow, he decided. When they had the astronomy tower all to themselves at night.
“Yes..yes.yess.” Harry’s words were jumbled because he felt so high. “Please…” He added. Draco slid his dick slowly into Harry’s ass. Harry moaned, then screamed. “Faster..” He begged.
“What the bloody hell does he think he is doing?!” Ron almost yelled. All eyes were on Draco as planned. He came and sat right next to Harry.
“Well, Harry.” Draco added with a bit of a giggle. “I found that it is quite boring and that I would much rather research something like Qudditch.”
The next night, Harry left dinner early. He couldn’t help it. He wanted as much time with Draco as he could get. He got up to the astronomy tower and it was empty, so he sat at their little table and waited. He looked out at the stars and sighed. This would be a night to remember. Footsteps made him turn around excitedly. Draco walked into the moonlight, the silver light dancing across his blonde hair and making his gray eyes seem brighter and full of joy. He looked so handsome. Harry walked over to him.
“Suck, Potter.” He told him. Harry took Draco’s fingers into his mouth and let his tongue run all over them, sucking them. Draco pulled his hand back and brought it down to Harry’s dick. His fingers rested for a moment at the entrance. Then he pushed one of them in slowly. Harry moaned, but as Draco pushed further and more fingers were added, his moans became screams. He felt something that he had never felt before. It was incredible. He could feel Draco pulling his fingers back out. Draco’s lips kissed his dick as a reward. Then Draco’s strong hands grabbed Harry’s waist and pulled Harry onto his stomach. Draco leaned on top of him and began to kiss his neck gently.
“If it makes you feel any better, I had to do chores for my aunt and uncle all the time because they hated me.” Harry supplied. Draco’s eyes widened in surprise.
“Good morning, children!” Her voice went up awkwardly as she glanced around the room. “I was crystal gazing and I have seen what we are doing in class for the rest of the week!” Her eyes lingered on Harry, then traveled to Draco. They both glanced at each other and made brief eye contact, before Draco looked away. That was weird. “I will choose partners for a project! We will take turns going to the astronomy tower to chart stars, going to the library for research, and in here,” she gestured to the curtains and pillows in her classroom, “to work on your star charts.” The class buzzed with excitement. Partners were always an interesting thing if Professor Trelawney picked them because she could see the future. Ron looked nervously over at Harry. Hermione was not in this class and she was the one who helped Ron through a lot of his school work.
Some truce. She should have found a better way to get her thoughts across. She tried to rectify her statement, but Draco cut her off.
Oh gods, what had he done? He could have just let her go, there in the forest. Left her to them. Watched as they dragged her away from the task she’d been set to do, forever. He could have… he could have let her die and been done with it. But he hadn’t. He’d thrown himself to the wolves instead, but he hadn’t died, as he’d expected—hoped? He’d come through it, thanks to the very person he’d sacrificed himself for. He’d gotten them both to the safety of ancient magic, and now, now he was going to get her the rest of the way, to the castle, to—
Malfoy studied her a little too frankly. “It’s a castle,” he said silkily. “There could even be a portcullis.”
“Does Minerva still have Filius’ scrolls?” Moody asked, squinting his good eye. Remus gave a wry smile.
Harry found that tiny smile playing about the other man’s lips again. He studied Oliver. “She’s very much changed.”
Harry woke with the scent of smoke hovering in his nostrils. Luna’s voice was bright and clear, filtering out of the very walls. The room shone; dust motes drifted through a thin shaft of yellow coming through the window, and the gold pooled on the floor.
“Draco.” Harry’s body came more alert in Draco’s grip, but it wasn’t enough, not fast enough. Draco moaned and pulled even closer, wrapped a leg around Harry and dragged them together until they were pressed close all along their fronts, and it still wasn’t enough. He itched, every inch of his body felt like it was writhing, needed to be touched, a mere brush from Harry and it would cool and be fine, he just needed—
He found the streets blocked entirely near the city wall and resorted to climbing the steps, hunched low, breath rasping in his ears. The remains of St. Mary’s Abbey, still wreathed in fog, were charred, with dark splashes of something Draco did not want to think about across the lower stones. He could see bodies in the soupy mist. The abbey was the focal point of the wards protecting the west side of the city; Draco felt no prickle of magic as he skirted by it and descended the wall again. Faint booms echoed further within the old city. From time to time, Draco heard the clack of running feet, the cries of people. But he saw no one.
Well. Let him sleep. Blaise could not gain that peace himself for the thoughts caroming through his head.
Ginny paused. It wasn’t what she’d expected. But it certainly didn’t preclude some insult further down the line. “What about it?”
“There are a lot of things I don’t want,” Harry managed. Draco’s hands climbed over his shoulders and clutched there, fingers tightening as he spoke. “This…” He almost shied away from speaking it aloud. “…isn’t one of them.”
He could still see how wide her eyes had been. They would be fixed on the Death Eater, but Draco could no longer see him. He was facing the wrong way, and all he could see was the tossing grass. Rainwater dripped into his eyes.
“We all have our parts to play after all, Ron,” she stated, tapping the table for emphasis. “Jobs to do.”
Harry needed to touch him, to feel the life within this body. He’d not managed to take it away yet; for reasons he couldn’t fathom, he’d been granted a reprieve in spite of his stupidity. Draco was here, moving under him and against him and
“You’re saying we have a way of protecting ourselves.” Harry gestured at Morag. “Painting ourselves.”
“It is not difficult to deduce certain truths if one is willing to open one’s mind to them.” Dumbledore’s tone was still so patient. “His focus on you has caught my notice more than once. His choice to come to you in the first place. And he did come to you, Harry. Not to the Order.”
For long moments, Seamus did not move, and finally Kingsley stepped forward and lit the pyre with a respectfully murmured spell. Luna’s song shifted from random notes to a heartrending melody.
“Even then, it was not until Draco himself gave strength to the possibility that I dared to hope. He is many things, but he is not as good at masking his emotions as he attempts to be. Ever since he arrived on Grimmauld’s front stoop, he has tried to be near you whenever he can. If not physically, then by other means.”
Harry was just closing the door to Luna’s chamber when Mad-Eye Moody came stumping down the hallway. The clack of his knobbly cane struck a staccato cadence with his peg-leg. Moody saw him and grunted.
And then Harry broke the moment. “Alright. Hermione. Is it your impression that Seamus was in trouble?”
“I am asking her to marry me. But not only that. I’m asking her to… to—” Harry struggled, unable to find the right phrase. “To trust me.” The description fell woefully short of the mess in his mind.
She nodded. For a long moment, Draco couldn’t move. Then he shifted his hand off of hers, gripping the edge of the stone. The moss cushioned his fingers and tendrils of magic crept up his arm. Draco shivered and watched the rain sheeting down around them.
Her head bobbed like a heavy weight on her neck. “And he does, every time. Every single time, his body attempts to pull itself back up. But that’s during the times when you feel him in pain, Seamus. The periods of calm are the exact opposite: he collapses then, deeper with each. He’s no longer fighting then, and so the pain subsides. In time, I don’t think he’ll have the ability to come up from it again.”
It couldn’t have been more different, this afternoon. Last night had been full of speed and groping hands, breathless mouths seeking gods knew what. What Harry was coming down off of now was quieter, a rush born of patience and stamina, and a shallow but lasting climax that had dropped from Draco’s body at last on a choked gasp. But it had been no less needy, or desperate. Draco’s fingers still squeezed his bicep, forgotten there in the shock of a final kiss unlike the frenzy of the others.
He stretched out on his back in the grass. To his right, broken stone monoliths rose against the hills like voids, the ghost of a great castle where weeds already grew and magic still trickled. Even the wreck felt familiar. He’d expected it to be painful, treading the paths he’d walked before, when the stones were still whole under his feet and cheerful voices echoed down cavernous hallways.
He shook his head, dumbfounded. She glanced at her wand, and then turned to him, eyes hard, jaw set. “I can’t let you get away with this. But I won’t be the one to—Blaise—” She took a shuddering breath and stepped away from him. Raised her wand.
Malfoy’s features twisted into a grimace as he yanked at the knapsack straps. “I’m sorry, too,” he bit out.
“Draco,” he wheezed. He opened his eyes and couldn’t see, couldn’t smell or feel anything except where his body touched Draco’s. Couldn’t seem to get enough air. Luna’s song pressed on his lungs, his ribs, seemed to fist his heart from the inside.
Draco wrenched his hand away. “You can’t tell me what to do.” But there was no force in it, and Harry’s hand encircled his with a gentle grip. He turned Draco around at last. Draco saw his face slacken in surprise and knew that he’d noticed the tears welling. Hated Harry for seeing it, for causing it, but he could only stare back miserably. Harry’s hold on him tightened and Draco felt the touch of Harry’s other hand on his arm, running up and down in cautious sweeps.
They signaled the children together again and left the library as fast as they could. Hermione saw the first hooded figure when she turned the corner, but it was Ron who blasted it back over the railing into the chaos below. Hermione’s heart jumped into her throat. “Go behind!” she hissed, motioning Ron back. “Guard the back!”
Cracks sounded around him, and shouts. Blaise concentrated with all his might on one thought, one coherent image.
Pansy had done it, over and over. That was comforting, in a weird sort of way. And Blaise was much more prepared than she had been. Still, the most primal part of his body knew exactly what he was facing, and his instincts screamed at him to get the fuck up and go, further away, not closer like he planned.
“Draco,” Harry hissed. But Draco turned easily out of his reach and tugged his trousers up, hiding those pale hips from sight. Harry’s chest ached fiercely and suddenly at the loss. Had Draco come here because he knew he would soon be sent away? Harry snatched for his arm again, and Draco backed away, fumbling the bottom two buttons of his shirt. He wouldn’t meet Harry’s eyes, but Harry could see that Draco’s were dull, too glittery around the edges.
The man flew off his feet as if a giant had smacked him away. His wand soared into the darkness. Shouts erupted in the dank alleyways around her. Hermione scrambled to her feet, hearing crack after crack. She turned on her heel and Apparated Merlin knew where, knowing they’d be right behind her.
Malfoy said nothing, but she saw him draw his cloak more tightly around himself. The rain fell, flattening his hair to his head. Ginny wondered absurdly how the two of them must look. If someone were to walk into the clearing right at that moment—
Another funny look passed over Blaise’s face, and for a moment, Ginny saw anger there underneath. Almost. Then Blaise sighed and it was gone, replaced by resignation. “Much longer, I think.”
Harry’s chest tightened. He struggled to push down the confused thoughts caroming through his head. “Malfoy’s one of the cleverer people I know. He won’t let anything happen to them.” He looked up sharply. “And Luna believes in him. You can ask her if you aren’t sure about me.”
It had been Ginny’s final notice that her childishness had no place there anymore, and it had hit hard. As if the death of her youngest brother had not smacked her senseless already. Still, she’d been able to hope, she’d had that ability, until they taken the room away from them, gave to someone they’d actually been able to find, and Hermione passed out on the floor right in front of her.
But Draco went oddly limp just as Harry stroked over the thin scar running up his side. Harry could still feel Draco’s arousal with his other hand. But the man himself had ceased to move.
And of course, Harry was there, focussed only on Blaise and Seamus, running right by Draco and on down the stairs, just ahead of Madam Pomfrey.
“Don’t you see, that’s the beauty of it,” Hermione said. “The spells are already there, in the mixing process! We didn’t have to develop any of these concoctions ourselves. We found all of the instructions in these papers. Wode and madder, and weld, too, which is yellow, have always been blended with magical protection in mind. The oldest magic users used the paints to shield their people in battle, Harry.”
The last word held an edge of desperation. Harry was caught in the wholly unfamiliar glint to Malfoy’s eyes. But the moment shattered suddenly and painfully; Katie’s wand jammed into Malfoy’s throat.
“That’s why she was upset this morning,” Seamus said quietly. Harry had no idea what he was talking about, but the sorrow in Seamus’ face told him that he’d hurt Madam Pomfrey, an emotional blow that he couldn’t forgive himself for yet.
Pomfrey nodded. “A day or two, perhaps. I should be seeing improvement tomorrow. It helps that Seamus is perfectly healthy otherwise.”
Draco’s cheeks heated. He was afraid of where this was going, felt stupid for worrying about such a triviality. Compared with Blaise’s fate, his own fear was foolish.
Draco tightened his cloak further, scowling. He had no idea why he should dream such things; Harry Potter had not been anywhere near that rooftop. Draco had seen him later, chasing them down to the—
He briefly filled Moody in on what Oliver had told him. Moody’s leading questions made it clear that Oliver had already summarised, and Moody meant to work out any details that may not have occurred to him but which Harry might have picked up on. But there was really very little to be gleaned from Oliver’s tale. The best piece of news Harry could give him—the best he’d heard all evening, in fact—was of the Weasley twins’ staggering success in monitoring the departure of the Death Eaters that had been stalking about London’s grimy alleyways.
She would have found some modicum of satisfaction in that if not for the wrenching hurt in Harry’s expression.
“That was constriction?” Krum asked, eyes wide. He stared at the mess of wood. Even the wand’s core element was gone, burnt to an unidentifiable crisp on the rug.
Luna sat in a gilt chair in the middle of the room, her feet drawn beneath her. Her face glowed in the light from the huge hearth in the far wall. Harry shut the door behind him and let the heat comfort. Luna’s voice flowed over him like silk.
It was becoming habit, forcing himself to remain calm, but that didn’t make it any easier. “What, he hasn’t done enough? He’s fulfilled his ‘duties.’ For Godric’s sake, Moody—”
“What?! Harry, that's awful! If I ever meet them I swear I’ll..” He seemed to realize that he said it out loud because he blushed slightly. Harry was touched. Not even Ron or Hermione had had that kind of reaction to the Dursleys before. Before he knew what he was doing, he leaned forward and pushed his lips against Draco’s. To his surprise, he felt Draco return the kiss, and wrap his arms around Harry, pulling Harry against him. Then they slowly parted, realizing what just happened. They parted from the library in silence, but not quite an awkward silence, but more of a hopeful one.
“Hey, babe.” Draco said. Harry smiled and climbed on to his lap. Draco’s arms went around Harry’s waist and Harry threw in arms around Draco’s neck. Harry raised his lips until they were kissing. They kissed for a bit before pulling away to look at all the shocked faces surrounding them. It was so worth it.
It was a week after that magical night and Harry was walking into the great hall with his friends for breakfast. He had a smile on his face that came from knowing that a great plan was in place and he couldn’t wait to see the looks on everyone’s faces. He sat down calmly at the table, trying to contain his excitement. A few minutes later, Draco Malfoy walked in. He walked right over to the Gryffindor table.
Draco pushed harder, faster, moving his hips to distribute the pressure. It was like nothing Harry had ever felt before. Before he knew it, it was over and he could feel Draco pulling out. They lay there for a moment before Draco was guiding Harry’s hands to replicate the incredible process again. This time, Harry was the one on top. It was a new experience, but he felt strangely motivated by Draco’s screams. It seemed that he made everything he did sexy. Now they lay again in the dark, but this time they were breathing hard.
The next day in Divination, Draco walked by Harry and brushed his arm. The shorter boy’s face turned a cute shade of pink behind his glasses. Draco couldn’t help but feel a strange desire to pull the brunette into an embrace and kiss him senseless. He looked away, a blush coming to his own cheeks. Draco could swear he could see Potter staring at him. Well. He thought. Maybe I should have a little fun while I work. Draco slid his arm around Harry, reaching for a book, making more physical contact with the other boy’s lower back than needed. Harry’s eyes went wide and his blush got darker. Draco gave him his award winning seductive smile. Potter looked away.
The second he realized that they were calling crushes for real, he almost laughed at Blaise’s face when they called him and Pansy. Draco, being gay, had never liked the girl himself, but she had a thing for him, so he went along with it. He never knew his best friend had a crush on her! That made him smile. Then he realized that this meant that they might choose his crush, his crush on Harry. If his friends found out… No, he would act unfazed and amused so that everyone would think Harry liked him. That was the perfect plan. When they called out Harry’s name, he held his breath, then his name followed. He glanced at Harry only to see a slight blush on his face. Did Harry actually like him? Draco felt fear seize him. What if Professor Trelawaney did this on purpose? What if she wanted him to come to his “demise” or possibly death? He forced a smirk so he looked unsuspicious, but inside fear was eating him away. When Professor Trelawaney said, “Harry Potter…” He felt his attention snap back into focus. The tension was building in his chest. “And Draco Malfoy.” The whole room looked at the two boys. Draco smirked and acted like he was not the one who liked Harry. He was not about to let the whole grade know that. Draco could swear he saw Potter blush, but it couldn’t be, right? Professor Trelawaney called out a few more names, then told everyone their assigned places. Harry and Draco were going to the astronomy tower last and right now they were on the library step. This was going to be exhausting! Looking through books and trying to ignore Harry at the same time was going to be a lot of work. As they made their way through shelves of books, they ignored each other like the plague. Draco occasionally started off in Harry’s direction, but looked away when he was caught. A few times he caught Harry looking at him and it gave him a flicker of hope. What if Potter really did like him? He could feel his heart beating a little faster. But what about Trelawney’s prediction? What if Harry liking him wasn’t a good thing? These thoughts plagued Draco Malfoy even in sleep. He could not really sleep for long with all of these thoughts running wild inside of his head.
“You- look…” At that moment, Harry grabbed him and pulled him close so that their noses touched, then leaned into a slow kiss. It began gently, then became more passionate. Their lips moved in a hungry way, as if they couldn't get enough of each other. Draco’s right hand nestled into Harry’s hair, pulling him closer and getting lost in the dark tangles. Harry’s hand had found its way to Draco’s shirt, grabbing some of the material and dragging him forward. Draco’s robe fell from his back and he used his free hand to push off Harry’s. The two now landed on the floor with Harry on bottom and Draco on top. Harry’s hands pulled up Draco’s shirt and slid across his stomach and felt all of his muscles. Draco leaned closer and moved his line of kisses across the other boy’s face and down to his neck. He kissed the soft skin gently then bit it more harshly. Harry squirmed slightly under him and his thighs tightened on Draco’s hips. Encouraged, Draco bit harder into the skin of his lover’s neck. Harry let out a moan. Both of the boys stopped for a breath, staring down at each other. Harry’s face was flushed and he had slight pinkness to his cheeks. His green eyes had a wild glow and his dark hair was disheveled by Draco’s hands. Draco smiled.
Draco Malfoy awoke in the middle of the night, the flashback still ringing in his head. Now that they were in sixth year, Harry had grown up a good deal, but he had stayed true to his mission, despite the temptations. Sighing, he looked over at the alarm clock. 2:30. He buried his head in a pillow, but still couldn’t get the words of the memory out. Draco’s arm burned slightly. It had been doing that since he got his dark mark. These were the lengths he would need to go to please his father and keep Harry far away from himself. Looking further out, the shapes of the other beds in the dorm appeared. They couldn’t know about his slight obsession with Harry Potter. They would all disown him and tease him. No, that would not be happening. Not now.
Harry kissed his neck and squeezed him tighter, willed the ache away as best he could, and hoped to all the gods that it would have some positive effect.
The bed by the far wall was neatly made. Undisturbed. Seemingly innocuous books were piled in droves about the room, in corners, at the foot of the large wing-backed chair in the centre. They were old tomes, cracked with age but well-cared for: Malfoy’s library. So Kingsley and Bill had been successful. Harry tore his eyes from the ancient texts and fixed them on the figure sitting in the chair instead.
Draco pressed a hand to his eyes. How long had their clocks been ticking? Had he signed Theodore’s death warrant as well, just by existing? By being his friend during school? By becoming his lover—
Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. He reached out as if to touch his own portrait frame. His fingers hung in the air, a breath away. “The wards have been changing. Ms Lovegood has commented. She cannot yet judge how far things have progressed, however.”
Weasley turned over in her sleep and Draco swung up out of his reverie. The images faded, but the dark red remained ingrained in his brain, the green dwindling of Theodore’s eyes.
He avoided Dumbledore’s portrait room, still too sick at heart to face his mentor. Thinking about it curdled thickly in his gut, and he turned his steps toward the cavernous front atrium instead, feeling the shame associated with running.
A thousand imagined reasons soared into Harry’s head, bumbling and cluttering around each other. The meaning of them all overwhelmed him and he shut his eyes briefly, trying to pinpoint the questions he had to ask to sort it all out. “How… Who came back?”
A razor-second later, she had slung a Death Eater into the wall a foot away from the foremost student.
She shouldn’t have said it. It was just asking for more questions, and Blaise gave them to her readily without even speaking. Just a look. It was so tempting to tell him, let it all spill out and stop poisoning her every thought.
But the attempt at a smile faded on her lips. Malfoy’s face had paled: bloodless cheeks under darkening eyes. Ginny was caught in a tidal glare that stole all her words. With a jerk, Malfoy looked away.
Draco had time to inhale, to recognise the voice, before someone turned the corner. Harry Potter, so covered in dust he was grey, glasses still clean from some charm, and a short, shallow-looking gash running up his left wrist. He was holding a second wand, long and thin and black, which he shoved into his back pocket as he knelt.
The door was clean. Blaise’s breath clotted in his lungs as he raised his hand and laid his palm against the uneven wooden surface. Petrified with age and endless moisture, the door was dark and solid. No embedded curse shot through Blaise’s body. It was just a door.
Hermione looked cursorily up and down the deserted, rock-strewn street. But it was mere habit tonight. She hadn’t seen a living Death Eater in weeks. Hannah’d had a run-in with one in Glasgow several nights ago, but he’d been “young, inexperienced, dealt with easily.” Hermione had not asked for details; the pierce of Hannah’s gaze reminded her too much of the look on her own face that second week after Christmas—
And Madam Marchbanks. The old woman caught Harry’s eye and gave the slightest of nods. Harry chose one of her questions. “You will provide us with the names of the Death Eaters your age.”
Hermione studied the graceful lines of the Celtic harp where it stood half in shadow by the hearth, then poked Luna in the side. “More like someone asked the house-elves again.”
He touched Draco again, thought it at the same time, and Draco’s eyes opened wide. He turned his head slowly to look at Harry.
and knowing even as he spoke that it was mostly a lie, that he’d never, ever told anyone his real, shameful reasons for seeking the Order out that night so long ago.
“He wasn’t expecting us.” Krum looked satisfied, and proud. “He thought he’d done all that was necessary to subdue my country.”
“How can you be sure?” Draco said it as if it had spilled out without his consent. “If Dumbledore thought it was—”
. He had been there in his nightmares and it broke cold sweat across his flesh. Draco ran, and the mottled light rippled over Ginny’s cloak in front of him. The rain drenched dark swathes into her pack.
Harry covered his mouth with his hand. Draco watched him cry. Other emotions flared, feeble wisps across the bond. His lover swayed in the middle of the room, half trying to return to Harry’s side, the other half demanding he get away, run and keep running until all of this was gone. Harry felt every inch and couldn’t bear it.
“He’s breathing,” Harry stated. He gestured. “Look at him, he’s… What do you mean you don’t know how he’s still alive?”
She made no move, only stared at him from across the sunken floor. Blaise backed away from her slowly, his wand trained upon her tapered head. He had a few minutes at most. Anti-Apparition wards of such a large scope took time to dismantle, and until they managed it, the Death Eaters would have to use their feet instead. And then however long it took them to break through his spells. If he hadn’t dealt with her by then…
The woman and her child would be safer in the city than with her. The best thing to do was to find Hannah, make the wand exchange, and get on with what she was supposed to be doing. The more places she went tonight, the more confused the Death Eaters would be, and the further away from their real target she could lure them. She only hoped this storm didn’t stretch over the Dales. She could do with a proper spot of warmth, and dry clothing for once.
The others passed by without speaking. Their tracks carved a path through the field, bending the grass down until it glittered, wet and deep green. Harry stood in the shadow of the door, reluctant to step past Luna. It was stupid; she knew exactly where he was. She knew where everyone was.
But Hermione’s brew was the purest and cruelest that Harry had ever witnessed. It allowed nothing to escape. Harry had seen Death Eaters offer up the names of their own children in order to escape its relentless force.
Luna didn’t answer immediately, and then Minerva cleared her throat. “Ms Lovegood has proposed—to me—leaving the castle when the time comes.”
Draco shook his head. The tension remained around his mouth. Harry could feel expanses he was sure he wasn’t supposed to feel. Normal was a long way off these days. “Draco?”
know at least one thing. And she thought it had been far, far better when she hadn’t known anything about Draco Malfoy.
Fuck. She probably had Draco to thank for their existence, too, somehow. Wouldn’t that just be the way?
Blaise’s smile wavered. And then words broke from him in a barely controlled gust. “I think I killed Greg.”
That was it: for the first time since she’d met Harry Potter, she didn’t know how it would turn out.
Eventually sleep was a necessity. Oliver Wood relieved Harry of his current scroll just as Harry’s head hit the table, and sent him out of the room. Hermione had departed for the Infirmary a few hours back with a splitting headache, and Moody had clunked off to see to a few new arrivals. The twins now sat at the table, brows furrowed identically as they went through the pile of scrolls, and Remus leaned on the hearth, studying an uneven parchment that looked like it was about to crumble to pieces.
There was no magical tingle, no movement in the corner of his eye. Nothing but the freezing rain. He should be welcoming the silence, the lack of arguing between him and the woman sitting a stone’s throw away, clutching her cloak with white fingers. But silence only gave him time to think.
Ginny swallowed, wondering if the strange light in his eyes was really for her. She’d thought it would be easy to tell, but now that she was faced with it, she had no idea.
Harry stared at him still, body vibrating. Torn, by whatever Lovegood had just… said? Draco hadn’t heard a thing, but obviously Harry had. Draco rubbed his forehead with both hands and the sick feeling grew. He couldn’t look at Harry.
“Harry says it’s a ward. She knew we were coming and she let us in. Called us in, even. She knows everything that’s going on in the castle.” He paused, studying his lover’s passive profile. “Has she… Can you…”
“No,” the older woman said, very crisply. “No, she’s not. She’s Apparated too often in too short a period of time. It could be days before she recovers fully. Weeks. I have no way of knowing here. And the longer you keep the two of us out of my Infirmary, the less of a chance I’ll have to figure out what she’s done to herself!”
Harry shut his eyes. Were they really sitting here, he and his best friend, discussing ending his life as though it were a task in the middle of a checklist? Of course they couldn’t tell anyone; like it or not, he’d long been a figurehead. The newest arrivals said it every time they walked in from the cold:
Remus gave him the tiniest shake to get his attention and looked intently at him. “We all keep living, Harry. We go on without them. All right?”
she recognised there. His skin was ashen even in the gold light and he looked at her miserably. Ginny’s mouth dropped open. There had never been a time, even in the extremes of his anger, that she had seen his walls stripped away. He probably wasn’t even aware it had happened. Now there was just a man in front of her, torn by something monumental and trying desperately to keep it locked away. Draco Malfoy… was in pain. Helplessly so.
A drunken nod. Malfoy’s face was like a stone tablet, blank on first glance, but when Harry peered closer, he could see it was etched deeply with lines of strangled emotion. He studied his old rival and saw the end in Malfoy’s eyes. Something tightened in Harry’s chest, and he swallowed against it.
The ripple skated over his left forearm like sparks. Draco gasped before he could stop himself, and Ginny Weasley looked up.
just dismantle the anti-Apparition wards around the entire base in an attempt to get into the room with him.
His night was sleepless. He lay on his back in the earliest hours and sought the familiar cracks in his ceiling, thoughts shifting over that closed door upstairs and the broken person within. A few hours and Malfoy would be gone, as quickly and suddenly as he’d arrived. In all likelihood, Harry would never again lay eyes on the boy—the man—who had made his school days a torment.
A sneer finally curled Malfoy’s mouth, but it looked unfamiliar and cold. He spread his hands accommodatingly. “We guardians specialise in several fields now, Weasley.”
The sunlight bathing the narrow hallway shifted as the wind rolled the clouds past outside. Harry stopped, caught by the colours the dusty stained glass made over the tapestries. The carefully cut and welded picture windows had not seen proper sunlight in months. He looked over the pictures as he walked, sinuous creatures and lithe half-humans depicted in translucent reds, tawny golds, and rich greens.
Beyond the forest, she caught glimpses of plains covered in unkempt grass and dotted with the silhouettes of lone trees. Now and again, she saw deep black furrows in the earth, a sign of spellcasting. From weeks ago or months, there was no way to tell. The soil was charred and gouged, the huge scars of destructive spells hatching their way across the fields. A battle, then. Ginny fancied she could still taste the sulfur of Diffindo Severitas, the sickly sweet musk of the Razing Hexes. The stark moonlight did nothing to alleviate the sensation.
Maybe this was penance. This was deserved. Harry dropped his head into his hands and Remus immediately drew them away from his face, easing him close again. “Harry, what else? What is it?”
Someone stood in the blackness where the dawn did not touch. Draco saw a void behind, an empty, sucking hole. The person standing there did not move. Draco felt eyes on them. He shut his own eyes and knew who it was. “Nothing we can do.”
the end, or at least the beginning of it. That snake, the one he’d trumped up into a monstrous behemoth in his dreams, was the doorway to the finish line, and his part in it began in solitude.
Seamus could see Pomfrey watching out of the corner of her eye even as her wand continued to touch and rise. “Death Eaters,” he managed. His mind threatened to sink.
A guarded look passed over Harry’s face. “Seamus left again to find Hermione. Blaise… isn’t here yet.”
It is all right, I—” She looked at her concealed companion, and when she spoke again, it was in a much quieter voice. “I will deal with her.”
“You’re a sight,” she said. Fred looked at her for a long moment, and then the tiniest of smiles cracked his pallor.
Hannah’s arms were spread, her hair a lopsided halo around her head, gold tarnished by the street’s filth. The front of her shirt and part of the now-lily-white skin of her stomach had been blackened by a grotesque char mark. Hermione’s eyes followed the dark snake’s curving form over Hannah’s side, from the eye sockets of the skull to where the tongue flicked a mangled burn just above her navel. As she watched, raindrops splatted down on the mark and washed rivulets of soot away.
Blaise felt Seamus’ mind drift. He rubbed his hand over his eyes, then stared back up at the stars. Potter had vanished sometime after that, taking Lovegood and Moody with him, and it was then that Blaise knew the end, and his mission, was coming. Besides himself, only Moody and Potter knew where he was headed, and they were sequestered somewhere out of reach until he had accomplished his task.
For a moment, nobody moved. Then Ginny’s grip loosened and she started to rise. Her eyes were trained sharply on Harry, and something in her face looked especially raw. Ginny’s gaze darted for just an instant, a mere twitch. “I’ll go.”
She rubbed her eyes, massaging them awake. Malfoy’s expression was now nondescript; either he was ignoring her dream or she’d made no sound worthy of investigation. Ginny felt it to be the latter; surely his understanding would have shown in some way. A blush, a sneer. A comment, if she were very unlucky.
Millicent’s eyes moved past him and fixed on the dead serpent. She whipped her gaze back to him. Disbelief cluttered her eyes. “What have you done?”
Harry’s eyes widened. He straightened slowly, but she could see the energy, gliding and sparking through his frame at her words. “Are you alright here for a minute?”
“He’s sustained considerable damage to his entire system. There are signs of Cruciatus in his nerves, but the real problem—”One of her hands clenched around the other. Moody’s magical eye darted over Blaise’s prone figure.
“Of course she does, Harry.” Remus spoke patiently from his place at the table. Su was now picking herself up and brushing off her palms, but she looked a little cowed. Remus gave her a steady look until she smiled back at him. “She has agreed to tell us should things slide even slightly out of her grip.”
that easily, it wasn’t his way. No, he’d rise up like a phoenix and save the whole damn world, and then, if Draco were still alive after the dust had settled, they’d come to him hand in hand and express their overwhelming gratitude, and he’d just stand there and nod, and never, ever have the chance to scream out the grief and agony that was building, roiling, twisting inside him even now.
The fact that he had nowhere to go wasn’t a deterrent. Harry strode as fast as he could, hearing the echo of his steps under the notes of Luna’s harp. He couldn’t go to her, and he couldn’t go to Hermione or Ginny or the twins, and he most certainly couldn’t go to Draco. He would probably sick up on the floor or something if he had to see the wounds in Draco’s eyes, and he knew they would be there, even if Draco wasn’t blaming him. Harry already blamed himself.
She had fifteen minutes until she had to be in Llangollen. That was where Ginny had last been ‘seen.’ Then twenty minutes until Wensleydale, with Luna’s wand instead, provided she could find Hannah in time. If not, Hannah would simply go to Wensleydale herself and wait for her. There was a sign with a green dragon on it.
Harry stopped, hands helpless at his sides, hovering between flushing and speaking. Finally he got his mouth to work. “About what?”
It no longer felt strange to use another’s wand. The uneasy tingle that had lanced up her arm the first night was now almost a necessity. It felt natural, as if her own wand had always given her a jolt or two just before a spell went off. Luna’s wand, strangely enough, tickled in her fingertips, and a jittery bounciness accompanied the magic it cast. Ginny’s was a fiery shock that Hermione imagined made the ends of her hair frizzle. She’d never thought how a person’s wand, a person’s magic, could hold so much of their personality within it.
Harry crumpled, squeezed his eyes shut and swayed bodily into Draco’s legs. Draco moved instinctively, catching him, holding him upright for just one moment. He bent over Harry and cried into his hair, then pushed him away and left the room.
Ginny found her eyes skittering away to follow the landscape. She took a deep breath. “Are we still on schedule?”
Draco’s body arched sinuously—helplessly—against his. Hands clutched. His hips thrust so tightly to Harry’s that Harry felt the lightning spasm skating through Draco’s muscles. He gasped, and Draco made an equally desperate sound. His hips shuddered again. Again, rolling up, pressing to Harry’s. The sight of Draco tightening, giving in, caught at Harry’s breath. His heart gave a strange, sublime shift, hurting for one glorious instant; Harry moaned, gathered Draco to him, enfolded his arms and legs, and met his mouth hard.
Draco tried to imagine it, and for an instant he thought he had. And then his mind shoved it away; too large, too… much. “It sounds overwhelming.”
A few sniffles sounded this time; some of the younger students were growing teary-eyed. Ron’s hand descended on her shoulder.
“Remus.” The name burst from Harry in a soft exclamation. Remus Lupin straightened in his chair and gave Harry a tired, warm smile.
Wind rushed across the grass, cleaving furrows and whipping water away. The torrent had slowed to a gentle drip and the clouds were rolling by overhead with astonishing speed, patching the earth with shadows. Ginny lay curled in her cloak, one arm looped around the base of the stone. Her face was hidden in the folds of her hood. Draco stood several meters away, a hand poised against a larger stone.
Harry looked at the nearest wall. The edges of the wallpaper were curling, warped by the damp and bordered in mold. “I’ll take you to your room.” He started for the door and, after a shaky moment, heard Malfoy’s footsteps following.
His pursuer wheeled around the corner and halted, wand jerking up warily. Dark eyes darted up and down the hallway. A few steps forward and Goyle would notice an oddly shaped shadow under the second torch on the right… But the Death Eater did not move. His wide face had gone flat. No trace of a smile left. Blaise quelled his heavy breathing and forced himself to concentrate. Goyle had been a fool, but he was obviously no longer the slouch Blaise remembered. This war had turned him into a thinker. A killer. Blaise couldn’t use magic; that left him with few options. If only Goyle would get closer, he could—but then he’d be seen—
Harry pushed the door wide, and was gladdened by Hermione’s shriek as Neville leaned into the opening behind him. Hermione pulled Neville through the doorway, hugging him so tightly he let out an ‘oof!’ Whatever she had to say was lost to further hubbub when she noticed Krum, and by the time they all actually got inside the room, both Su and Morag were looking impatient.
No, Malfoy had not known names. Yes, he had considered a possible threat to his family. No, he had never attempted to warn his mother. The slow, painful fall of his face as each question presented itself showed Harry more than enough about what Malfoy’s opinions of his actions were in this matter.
Ginny went white. Her freckles were much too dark against her pallor. Something haunted crept into her face.
“Bunch of Death Eaters,” he shouted back. Masonry rained down. Ron coughed and blinked at her again. “And Harry.”
“Come on!” She led the way, dashing past the corner and the shroud of dust, the chaotic clash of spells beyond. The doors looked a kilometre away, but eventually she reached them, blasted the lock to smithereens, and pushed students in before her.
“We’ll treat it like another strategic review,” he said, gruff. Beside him, Draco’s mouth tightened. Hermione looked up, more nervous than he’d expected. It irritated him, that she could be caught off guard when he could not allow himself to be.
Irritation flared. She dug her fingers into Harry’s back, and he blinked, looking down at her once more. His gaze warmed. He pulled her close again, brushing his lips over her hair. “So glad you’re alright.”
Remus wrapped his arms around him and rocked him closer, shushing him. Harry smelled wolfsbane and the scent of earth worked into Remus’ cloak. He clutched handfuls of fabric, gripping and releasing. Remus made no attempt to stop him.
He wanted to tell her it was all his fault. But he couldn’t stomach everyone else in the room looking at him like he’d personally struck Blaise down. In the end, Harry nodded and let her think what she wanted to think.
Harry patted Oliver’s shoulder. “Up the stairs. Second hall to the right, and straight on. She’ll guide you the rest of the way.”
“I mean that by all rights, he shouldn’t be. He’s had enough poison to kill a young Horntail. I found three broken ribs and deep bruising all over his torso. One of his kidneys just isn’t working anymore, and that’s saying nothing of the spell damage to his nerves!” She drew a shaky breath. “I’ve stabilised him as best I can. Everything I can fix right now is healed. I just… I have no idea why he’s still breathing, but he is.”
The day he finally turned back toward Grimmauld Place, he could feel Seamus in his fingertips. Every step was experienced fully. His body hurt more, and yet grew stronger at the same time, until he opened the door ready to leap out of his skin, hands shaking so hard the knob rattled. He needed—needed to get somewhere, something, someone, and it wasn’t until he saw Seamus’ bloodshot eyes that he really thought of Seamus at all. It had only been himself those nights alone, what
she seen? Maybe Oliver was right, maybe Seamus had been—Oh, she couldn’t think and they were all staring at her.
The next day… days? They passed without Harry, without Draco. Someone brought food to their door. Harry was relatively sure no one had walked in on anything humiliating: the bond seemed content to stick them in close proximity but not to bind them physically. Harry existed in a stupor filled entirely with Draco: Draco’s smell, Draco’s thoughts, the heat of Draco’s skin. Whenever he roused, they were in contact, woven together on the bed, all limbs and tangle; sometimes just their fingers tightly interlocked. He wasn’t sure how long he spent with his mouth hovering a mere breath from Draco’s, air passing between them even as thought and emotion bled together.
Hermione nodded, her nose bumping his head. Likely they would have to tell everyone in the top echelons. Strategy would be formulated with this at the center. It was the loneliest Harry had ever felt.
Chilly air rushed into the cave, hastened by the narrow crevice entry. It was laden with the sweet tang of rain. Draco tugged his cloak around himself, pulling his knees close to his chest. The ends of Weasley’s bedraggled ponytail ruffled briefly and settled back to the cave floor. Draco looked away, forcing the last eddies of sleep from his mind.
The woman saw her and startled, stepping in front of… Hermione squinted into the drizzle and made out a child standing in her shadow. Hermione raised a hand cautiously and straightened.
What if… Ginny stumbled slightly. What if she was wrong in thinking that those three years had been the same blank slate for Harry as they’d been for her? The war had swung up and grabbed hold too tightly for Ginny to even consider another emotional entanglement. But there had been opportunities, that she could not deny. Only the thought that Harry might be waiting for her had kept her out of Dean’s bed a year ago, and she’d heard through the walls and tent canvas the trysts that would never be repeated, but were necessary for comfort’s sake. People came together, people split apart again. The relief of stress was so very important to avoid insanity. She’d simply found other ways to go about it.
He slid his free hand into his pocket and drew out one of the obsidian Minis-ports. It would leave the tiniest of trace signatures when it went off. They might sense it, they might not. He heard his companion swallow once.
“We’re fine.” Ginny licked her lips. Glanced again toward Malfoy. Hermione frowned, unable to place the weird conflict in her friend’s face. Ginny continued. “Really, Hermione, we are. Only, they intimated that…”
“Oh god,” Harry choked. Or maybe not. Draco wasn’t sure what he was hearing and what he was thinking anymore. What was coming through the half-formed bond. He used Harry’s shoulders to push up, push closer, reached down and found what he wanted and then lowered down again, and Harry was
He looked back over his shoulder, gesturing at the people still out on the stairs, and Viktor Krum stepped up to the threshold, pulling a worn cloak from his shoulders.
It wasn’t until six nights later, his lover catching his breath heavily in his arms for a different reason, that Blaise thought through his post-coital haze and understood that Seamus should have died. It should be a corpse in his arms. Somehow, Seamus had found his way back to him, and that same, fragile thread between them, the one that had brought him home, had kept him alive for hours when he should have perished.
But he couldn’t help the way his eyes flicked of their own accord. The Death Eater’s eyebrows rose. “You really expect me to fall for it, don’t you? I haven’t the patience for this, Malfoy. I
hell. Harry pulled his trousers on. His dresser was rattling, jumping and scraping against the wall, and he could barely see through the red in his eyes. He strode out of his room, not looking at Draco again, slamming the door much too hard.
More than once, Ginny caught herself wishing for him to be the way he had been, and then grew angry every time.
Harry looked back over his shoulder. Malfoy was still staring at the wall. There was a shimmer at the edges of his eyes, above the dark smudges underneath. He nodded jerkily, knowing Malfoy would not see, and left the room before the knowledge pressed in on him.
“It’s all right, you haven’t missed anything,” she assured him. “We’re still… Pomfrey says all we can do now is wait.”
It took Harry a minute to sort out the jumble. He wasn’t ready, or prepared, to talk about Ginny Weasley. His reasons for evading it seemed shameful, but it felt like one thing he could avoid. One thing in all this mess that wasn’t careening toward him quite as fast as everything else. “Don’t,” he whispered. He feared saying any more for what might come out on top of it.
Draco was fearful and mortified. Did Ginny think that he had told Harry everything? That he had made Harry talk to her on his behalf? “How did you know? How did you know where I was, and that Weasley was involved?”
Draco wasn’t sure where she was going with this. “Exactly. Of course you are. So why make things worse by approaching me? I didn’t just stand by and do nothing at the Manor, I tormented you for years.” Part of Draco felt like he was purposefully egging her on. Now that things have calmed down with his parents, he was focusing more on Hogwarts, and that meant focusing on everything he did during the past few years. He felt like everyone was giving him far too much credit for very mild changes.
Draco knew it was more than just the Patronus that was upsetting him. He was nearly the halfway point of his last year of schooling. What in the world would be next? Malfoys didn’t usually have “jobs” per say, but they made sure to stay active in the Wizarding community, and conducted business in dealing with dark artifacts and investment properties. But who in the wizarding community would want to interact with Draco?
“I’ve said that enough times to know when it’s a lie. I know what’s happening tomorrow,” Harry stole a glance at Draco, watching his wince. “and I know that you probably don’t want to talk about it. So I’m here specifically to not talk about it with you. We can talk about anything else or we can just be quiet. We can even take our meals in the kitchens today, if you’d like. Just to get away.”
Draco knew that he was about to find out. Harry was sitting on his bed, watching Draco pack on Friday afternoon for his weekend visit to Malfoy Manor. “Are you nervous?” he asked.
Draco didn’t really know what to say to that. His mind was filled with memories of the Death Eater meeting where the Dark Lord taunted Draco about babysitting Nymphadora and Lupin’s kids. “Didn’t they have a kid?”
“No, I want to know how bad it is. Plus, I need to make sure no one is actually threatening me or my family.” This was definitely true, but not the full reason why Draco wanted to open each and every letter. He took some sick pleasure out of the pain that he felt with each horrible word. It felt good to punish himself, as if with each hate note he was one step closer to the finish line of finally being redeemed for his actions.
Draco explained to her that everything was fine. He told her he was roommates with Potter but that it wasn’t so bad. He left out his attack from the Ravenclaw student and instead claimed that the other students mostly ignored him.
“I mean...I just have no way to heal myself, since I can’t use magic. So I lost consciousness, but I’m not sure I nearly died.”
It was a few days after Draco’s date with Harry, and the day before his parents’ trial. All the emotional progress that Draco made in the past few months seemed to have disappeared.  His hands were shaking as he buttoned up his coat, and he felt irritable and nauseous. He had also spent the past few nights with unrestful sleep. Though he was extraordinarily happy that Harry had expressed interest in going on another date, he missed the warm presence beside him at night dearly.
Granger narrowed her eyes at Draco’s accusatory tone. “He prefers to work these things out alone, for the most part. He learned a lot of strategies at the Mind Healer’s. He’ll come back when he’s ready. But if he isn’t back in five minutes, I’ll go talk to him.” She continued her conversation with Neville.
Draco sighed with exhaustion. It had already been a long day and it was barely dinnertime. He stole a glance at the stack of textbooks next to him—he really should do homework, but his head was swimming with the events of the day. One small nap wouldn’t hurt anything.
“Yeah. I just feel ridiculous.” He had been ill for the past few days. Harry had wanted him to go to the Hospital Wing, but Draco knew all too well what was going on. This was reminiscent of the entire summer when he fought to keep simple foods down and battled clammy hands and a nervous stomach. “I thought all this was over with. I thought I was done with this.” Draco was frustrated with himself that he regressed this far.
Draco wanted to believe her—he did want to feel better. He wanted to not freak out every time something mildly bad happened to him. He wanted to fall into bed at night not afraid of the nightmares that were to come. He wanted his energy back, he wanted his spirit back. “I don’t see how sitting here and talking to you for an hour a week will help me feel better.”
“No,” Harry said. “Children are forgiving. He’ll only know the you that you are now. And Andromeda—she’ll completely understand why you had to leave, maybe better than anyone. Maybe it will be good for you two to chat.”
“No, no. I—thanks.” Draco stood up to leave, putting his hand on the chair’s armrest as the world swayed a bit. He could hear Professor Snape’s portrait make a faint noise of concern behind him.
Draco slowly turned his head toward Potter, sitting across from him. Potter looked open and somewhat eager to have a conversation.
“Harry, I—I think I have to tell my parents about us. Wait, no. I know I have to tell my parents about us.”
As they ended their day at the Ministry, Draco having accomplished his mission, Draco couldn’t help but worry that Harry was mad at him. Back in Kingsley’s office, Draco had tried to touch Harry’s shoulder, and he seemed to deliberately shift away. Draco also tried to make eye contact, and Harry met his eyes only with a cold stare. Once they all got back to Professor McGonagall’s office and went their separate ways, Draco asked Harry to hang back. Thankfully Hermione and Neville obliged, giving them a small smile as Draco thanked them again.
It was only later, when they were under the covers in Draco’s bed where he thought they both belonged, that Draco let himself process what had happened earlier that evening. He tried not to tense his body, not wanting to worry the sleepy Harry that was curled against his chest. Draco wondered if Harry had thoughts of his own, and wished that he could read them through the fingertips that were grazing the top of his head.
Draco wasn’t expecting this direct of a question. “Just...just tell my mother I love her, and I’ll hopefully see her soon.”
“Are you just going to stand there gaping all day like you’re some sort of a stranger? Come in, son,” his father bellowed from inside. He was leaning on his cane heavily—whereas before it was more of a display of wealth and provided security from revealing an old Quidditch injury, Lucius appeared to actually need the cane now.
Draco wasn’t sure what to do. He could approach Greg and try to win him back over. Looking around the platform, he didn’t see any of the other “eighth-year” Slytherins. He decided to board the train a little early, hoping for an empty compartment. He went for the one toward the back, shut the door, and pulled down the shade. He hoisted his trunk on the top shelf with difficulty and collapsed into the seat, taking comfort sitting down. Trying to keep his breathing even was an embarrassing challenge. Draco wondered if this was the furthest he had walked and the most active he had been since the Battle.
“Can’t use magic.” Draco couldn’t even begin to process the fact that both Harry Potter and Hermione Granger were in his bedroom right now, the fact that once again, Potter had saved his life. He closed his eyes again.
“Hi everyone. Thank you so much for getting up early to come to this meeting, I promise it won’t take too long. As Professor McGonagall said, we aren’t getting our class schedules today, that’ll come tomorrow. She wasn’t sure about year sizes, so they’re still sorting out everything. But I thought today would be a good day anyway just to get used to being back in school.”
!” He opened his eyes only to find the faint outline of a creature, not a full Patronus. Still, it was certainly progress.
“Yes,” Draco said without hesitation. “I want to see my mother. I want to see how they question her, I want to make sure she’s alright.”
“Oh, Draco. I love you so much. You don’t even know. I love you. And please, be kind to your father.”
Draco took the beret, muttered a quick thank you, and ran back to grab Harry’s arm. “We have to go. Now.” He dragged a panicked Harry away to an alley.
As Draco broke away from these memories, he noticed Blaise’s eyebrows furrowed as he drew his hand away. Draco had to recover—he could not show weakness in front of Blaise. “Um...yeah. Bigger room, right. Well, I’m sure Potter will take more than his fair share of the room.” Thankfully Draco’s attempt at diverting the situation was successful—Blaise’s concerned expression turned into a grin.
This ended up being a bit of a longer one, but I’m sure you guys don’t mind! I have a busy weekend so the next one may be delayed until Sunday or Monday. I think I will split this up into different parts of a series. Thank you for all your feedback, I absolutely love it and love you guys!
Though he welcomed the pain of the cold, part of him wished he brought his coat. It was nearing mid-November now, and it almost smelled like it was going to snow. He made his way out of the castle and down toward the Forbidden Forest. His feet were tracing the same steps that he so often took to perform raids on Dumbledore’s Army. He wondered if the DA was still active. Harry hadn’t mentioned anything about it, and there wasn’t much of a need. He almost envied them—a close group of friends that practiced dueling. Draco found that his spell work left more to be desired, especially after an insane rotation of Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, some of whom were incompetent. Then again, he couldn’t join any dueling group now with the manacle on his wrist.
Before long, it was time to say goodbye. Unfortunately the Malfoy Manor Floo had been permanently shut down shortly after Narcissa got there. They were still trying to determine how the Time Turner was stolen, so no one could go in or out without direct Ministry supervision. Draco would have to take the Hogwarts Express, where he would then be accompanied by a Ministry driver to Wiltshire.
So he decided to crack open his door and try to see if there was anyone inside the common room. From his angle, it looked empty. The Gryffindors’ Exploding Snap game had been abandoned, with pillows strewn over the floor as cushions. Draco tentatively moved toward the kitchen, but it seemed he was in the clear. He sighed and turned to make himself some tea.
“But this is the first step. You’re going to do it.” Harry looked at Draco with such certainty and determination. Draco
Draco’s nightmare started to come back to him. He closed his eyes but knew that he couldn’t prevent the oncoming attack. Eyes sweeping the living space, he realized that his body could not turn against him in this room, no way, not in front of all of these people. He knew going to his room would corner him. There was only one option.
I liked writing this one! Let’s hope the trial brings Draco and Harry closer together. As always, please let me know what you think and leave your comments! I love reading them and I love you guys.
“I wanted to thank you.” Luna spoke in the same even tone as though Draco had just not heard what she said rather than was baffled by it. “You treated me well when I was in your home. I appreciate that. Things would probably have been better for you if you acted like the others.”
“I’m sure they won’t mind more players,” Daphne said. “If they do, we can always just sit and watch, be the scorekeepers or something.”
Ughhhh I love writing this developing friendship! Please let me know what you think. I love you guys
Regardless of his location, Draco doubted that he would have been able to eat today. It was September 1st, and his trunk stared at him menacingly from the end of his bed. He put on a suit, washed his face in the adjoining bathroom with cold water himself, and then dragged his trunk down two flights of stairs to the main floor.
Harry’s hand hesitated from its spot on Draco’s cheek, but he continued to stroke it with his thumb while he spoke. “Dray—I’ve never...I’ve never even with a woman, I—“
The two of them walked out of their classroom. “I’m sure they’ll be a little awkward, but they won’t mind. They certainly won’t just gawk at you like I’m sure anyone else would if you decided to grace them with your presence.” Draco nodded to a giggling group of girls that had just passed them, their attention thankfully only on the Boy Who Lived.
“Malfoy,” the same female voice said again. “Malfoy can you hear me? I need you to open your eyes.” Thinking of his mother, Draco reluctantly obliged, and nearly vomited from the dizziness as Granger’s face swam before him.
“Well, I’m not going to. The next step of Occlumency is learning how to alter your own memories as you’re showing them. It’s similar to how people can alter their memories when they take them out to be put into a Pensive. You can change whatever you hated so much about that kiss.” Draco gave Harry a moment to think, and when he nodded, Draco began looking at Harry’s memory.
“It wasn’t that bad, Potter and I didn’t really talk. I just had some trouble sleeping. Where’s the coffee?” Draco needed a pick-me up for the horrors that this meeting was bound to bring.
“Listen,” Draco leaned forward. “My parents—well, my mom at least, has told you everything she knows, I
“I don’t care! You’ve been through enough, mate,” Blaise said, pointing his fork at Draco. “You deserve to be happy. If Potter is what makes you happy, then he better cooperate.”
All of a sudden Harry stirred next to him, and then sat bolt upright in bed, knocking Draco’s teeth together as the top of Harry’s head hit Draco’s jaw. Draco noticed a cold sweat on his boyfriend’s back as Harry’s chest moved up and down rapidly. “You’re alright, you’re safe.” Draco immediately started rubbing Harry’s back, and sat up to be at his level. After a few moments of Draco continuing to coo nothings, Harry calmed down. Draco stood up and got him a glass of water, as Harry had done for him so many times. “Do you want to talk about it?”
“Yes, Narcissa Malfoy has been useful to the Ministry, and therefore I don’t think many of us saw the benefits of holding her in Azkaban for much longer,” the man said while the reporter quickly jotted down his words. “She’ll still be under house arrest as her original probation required, and we will need to monitor Malfoy Manor more closely, but she will no longer be imprisoned.” Draco’s heart leapt—he found it hard to believe that his mother was free after only about two hours of a trial, but he was thrilled nevertheless.
“Shut up Potter, I didn’t do it for you.” More silence. Draco didn’t know why, but he was starting to feel a little ill. He leaned his head against the cool window and closed his eyes, trying to calm down. He did not want this problem following him to school. He was going to leave all this behind at the Manor. He was going to go to school, not speak to anyone, and graduate in the most boring possible way. Then—well, he could think about what would happen after that once he got there.
“Dragon?” Draco snapped out of his memories and sat up in bed at the sound of his mother’s voice—tentative and worried as it always had been this summer. “Would you like some breakfast?”
Draco held the wand. He had tortured adults and children alike with this wand. He had performed the Imperius Curse with this wand. He was holding this wand when he was trying to work up the courage to kill his Headmaster. He held this wand through it all, but now he felt as though the wand had its grip on him.
“Potter, you could ask me anything you want and there’s nothing I would be able to do about it. I quite literally can’t hurt you, remember?” Draco held up his manacled arm.
“Look at you two scums.” A chillingly familiar voice sounded from behind them. “The Boy Who Lived, getting all cute and cozy with a cowardly traitor.”
Draco stared oddly at Harry, but the latter seemed too agitated for Draco to argue. Once he was sufficiently close to Harry, the young man pulled the blanket around both of them, covering their whole bodies. Draco could still see through the fabric, but the world shimmered a bit. “Is this an Invisibility Cloak?”
The bathroom had been fixed, but was still abandoned due to Myrtle and the bad things that had occurred there. Draco had used it as a hideout sometimes in seventh year, and welcomed the familiar surroundings. He sank to the floor, trying not to vomit, and held his head in his hands.
Draco’s father exhaled sharply through his nose. “That is one thing that he will never have. You need to be careful, Draco. It’s fine to be close to him
The driver handed Draco his rolling trunk and made a hasty exit, giving Draco a minute to orient himself. He had a reflexive fear of this house despite the recent improvements. His stomach turned and he for a moment thought he would be ill right in the rose bush. Thankfully he regained control, because one of the front doors swung open.
Draco really wasn’t in the mood to tolerate stupid ideas. He glanced at the clock, though—it was only a quarter past two. He had many hours to kill before morning, and at least this way he knew he wouldn’t fall asleep. “Fine.” He settled into an armchair across Hermione.
“Oh, Draco,” Narcissa’s eyes welled with tears, and Draco found it hard to resist the temptation to look away. He hated seeing his mother upset. “I want you to be a part of this family more than anything in the world.”
I’m going home for Thanksgiving break tomorrow, so I imagine I’ll either have a lot of chapters published this week or very few. Either way, I can guarantee a new one by Wednesday! As always, let me know what you think. Love you guys!
After a few moments, he opened his eyes. Christine looked at him with sympathy—he hated it. “That sounds like a lot. I’m really sorry you don’t want to be here. I understand why you don’t. Is there anything I can do?”
. And it had been the Order of the Phoenix who had fought so hard for the Dark Lord’s defeat, not the Aurors.
Harry continued, rubbing at his forehead. “Do you know what I would do if you had gotten in trouble? If you had gotten yourself thrown into Azkaban? I—“ He sank down into a chair and gave a deep sigh.
In seventh year, they argued constantly over who would take up various duties proposed by the Carrows. Draco found the sight of her annoying, and another reminder of the future that he was likely to be forced into. He assumed that she felt the same way. He wasn’t sure who she would rather have been with, but it certainly wasn’t him at that point. If he did see her again over the holidays, he wanted to apologize. It wasn’t her fault that she was a representation of everything that was wrong with his life at that point. She had suffered, too. Hopefully her travels and escape from England had done her some good.
“I have no idea,” Draco replied. Harry’s mention of his parents pulled at his heartstrings. “It doesn’t really matter to them as long as I produce an heir, so I’m not sure why they would care.”
Draco sighed in frustration and finished gathering his things. He took a moment to sit on the bed and catch his breath, steadying himself against the post. It was going to be a long day.
“I know, Dragon, but they’re being quite generous given the...circumstances. I think that we should just hear them out. I know that you and Pansy had a lot of falling outs over the past year, but both of you were in very stressful situations. It’s remarkable how different things can be when—“
The older kids inspired everyone. Draco sat as students began to share their stories of horror from the past year, some nearly yelling at Draco from anger but others bursting into tears or just staring numbly at the floor. Draco didn’t know what story was the worst or which reaction tugged at his heart more. He knew that the war had traumatized everyone, he really did. But he didn’t know the extent to which his peers—some of them just children—carried it around with them. What had he been doing over the past week? Fawning over Harry Potter, enjoying his life? While these students were down here trying to wrestle control of the universe away from the Ministry? He felt awful. He encouraged the misery that was burning deep inside of him, not knowing if he deserved to be so sad, but knowing for certain that he should never be happy again.
That perfectly described the following week for Draco. He was closer to Harry than ever. They were inching closer to a new level of intimacy. For the first time, Draco was actively communicating what he wanted to someone who was listening. Draco was better at that than Harry. Dragging information out from the Boy Who Lived was so hard partially because Draco wasn’t sure Harry knew what he wanted.
Harry paused and looked at Draco. “A panic attack. It’s the Muggle term for—well, for what just happened.”
No angst today! You guys deserve some romance. We’ll get back into sort of the “plot” next time, and we’ll see how Draco can rely on Harry now that they’re together. As always, let me know what you think! Love you guys.
“Your actions say otherwise. I have nothing more to say to you. My only advice at this point is to try not to mess things up any more than you already have, though I know that will be impossible for you.”
her, she’s strong, she’s funny...I just don’t want to be with her. And I don’t know why. Did you—“ Potter abruptly cut off the beginning of his question in favor of looking down at his feet. “Nevermind.”
“Well you could jeopardize your life doing that, not to mention ours!” Narcissa rarely raised her voice with Draco, and he cowered a little. She seemed to realize that she had become angry, and morphed her expression back into one that Draco could more easily recognize. “I’m sorry, sweetheart, I’m not upset with you. It’s just a stressful situation, that’s all. You’re—you’re all the Malfoys have left. I know that’s a lot of pressure, but it’s true. Even if your father and I make it through our retrial, we’re going to be social outcasts. You’re the only hope this family has.”
“Harry, you’ve fought enough. I guess if everything you’ve said is true, you’ve spent the past, what, four years fighting? Let other people help you for once. You deserve to be a normal student.”
“I hadn’t either,” Harry said, staring into the fire wistfully. “Until this past summer. Teddy is the absolute best. He can change his hair like Tonks, and he really enjoys that. He looks at you with complete love and trust. It’s honestly unlike anything I’ve ever experienced.” Serious again, Harry met Draco’s eyes. “He’s not going to know anything about your past. He’s just going to know that he has another relative who cares about him. And honestly, he needs whatever blood family he can get.”
The hallways were quiet as most everyone else was in classes or studying. Draco decided to go back to his room to look at the application in peace. He unfolded the sheet of paper as he sat at his desk.  The application included some basic information, and then a spot to request individual visits with prisoners. He would have to see his mother and father separately.
Draco felt like his heart was breaking—this was all supposed to be over already. After a few more minutes of precious conversation, Yarney gave the two of them a one-minute warning.
“Oi, you say you don’t want him to participate in the group and he just said he wouldn’t. What the hell do you want from him? It’s not his fault he can’t fix your loony sister.” Draco glared at Blaise as he said this last part. All gratitude Draco was starting to build for Blaise sticking up for him vanished when the inevitable happened.
Finally his mind gave him a rest. He was aware of Harry stripping him down to his underwear and then dressing him in blankets instead, and he was aware that they were in Hagrid’s cabin. He even had the decency to be a little embarrassed that they were in the home of the professor he tried so desperately to get fired. But everything else felt twinkly, and he calmed down as his emotions melted into mush.
“Oh yeah,” Harry frowned at Draco’s wrist. “I had a conversation with McGonagall about what happened.”
“I’m not too keen on them finding out myself,” Harry shuddered. “Not because of you. I wouldn’t want them to find out about anyone I was dating. They suggested I was dating Hermione back in fourth year, and she actually got hate mail over it.”
Draco took a deep breath. “Look,” he said. “For once in my life, I’m going to be honest. I’ve had a shite few years, and I’ve been a shite person nearly all my life. I spent years tormenting most of you, especially you and your family, Weasley. I was arrogant and I thought that being a pureblood made me better than anyone else. It was wrong. I shouldn’t have realized all this was wrong just because of what I went through, but that’s what got me thinking.
Draco shrugged, feeling a little guilty. “They were mostly my...henchmen I guess. That’s putting it a little nicely as it is. Especially toward the end. I just bullied them into doing whatever I wanted. We never talked about much else. To be quite truthful, they never really talked to me, it was mostly me droning on and on...you should know, you were Greg once!”
Draco smiled back, feeling a little more reassured. He realized that he knew fairly little about the man sitting next to him. Knowing how he felt when he was around Harry was certainly enough to warrant wanting to go on a date, but if they were to enter a real relationship he was going to have to know more.
After a few more moments and kisses, Harry and Draco stumbled as the train pulled into the station. Draco didn’t even say the word “goodbye,” because it was nearly too much to bear after months of sleeping in the same room, and even the same bed. Draco gave Harry one final kiss and turned to collect his luggage and say goodbye to his friends.
The night had ended on a positive note, and Draco was able to sleep through the night with little difficulty despite his earlier flashback. Yesterday felt like a long time ago, but Draco remembered that he had a decision to make. Should he go to Hogsmeade with Potter and his friends after he tutored Harry in Potions? He would like to get a gift for his mother before he sent a small care package out, but that place also held bad memories for him. He put Madame Rosmerta under the Imperius Curse, and sometimes he had Occlumency lessons with his Aunt Bellatrix at the Hogs Head last year. If Draco wasn’t focused enough, Bellatrix would torture him while his mom watched with tears in her eyes. That hurt way more than the physical pain. Seeing the look on his mother’s face...
“My ‘negative’ emotion of choice to hide that I was afraid was anger. After Voldemort came back, I was furious at everything and everyone, even people who didn’t deserve it. Ron, Hermione, Sirius, they all tried to make me feel better, but I just pushed them away. I was just so mad that no one was telling me anything, and so afraid of what I would be expected to do. So I know what you mean.”
“Your mother and I wanted to make clear our expectations for you this year. You are to follow all rules related to your probation. You are to get high marks in all of your courses and be polite to your professors. You are to be especially kind to all pureblood students. Their families have been very gracious in letting us back into the inner circle. You will not tarnish the Malfoy name.”
“I recall no such conversation,” Lucius folded his arms. “We clearly do not want the same thing right now.”
“Fine, thank you. I have the application to see my parents,” Draco handed Mr. Burke the form. He put it in the inside pocket of his coat.
“What is this artifact?” Kingsley’s voice boomed, though he sounded like he already knew the answer.
Everyone looked at Draco, expecting him to speak. His mouth felt dry. “I’m here because the Minister is making me. I didn’t want to come back to this ridiculous school. And I’m not going to your stupid group either.”
To Draco’s horror, once again his eyes filled with tears. Nothing was going right anyway—his parents were in Azkaban, he couldn’t do magic...Mr. Burke was asking him to do the impossible by making everything better again. If everything was going downhill, he may as well enjoy himself along the ride.
“Oh,” Harry looked down. “I lived with my aunt and uncle, and they didn’t like me one bit. Thought I was a right nuisance. Before I had a growth spurt, I lived in the cupboard under their stairs.”
“When you were discussing what to do, did you ever consider notifying a Ministry official of what had happened?”
“Why do I have to spell everything out for you? Clearly your survival hasn’t depended on intelligence,” Draco sneered. When Potter just waited for him to respond, he said “Death Eaters can’t produce a Patronus” through gritted teeth.
“No,” Draco said truthfully. “I don’t know how anyone is supposed to figure this stuff out.” Harry was silent for a moment. “Hey,” Draco said, wanting to get his attention. Harry looked up at him. “You know that we don’t have to do this now, right? Rush any of it? I’m happy with you. I’m happy to have you sitting with me, I’m happy talking with you, I’m happy doing anything with you. Happiest I’ve ever been.”
He clasped Draco’s shoulder—which he hated—and pulled him in closer. Draco assumed that to his mother, it looked like a gesture of affection. But his father usually only did this as a warning.
Granger turned around and called to the rest. “They’ve renovated the whole Prefect area into a dormitory for us. They figured no one would mind giving up that luxury if it meant we could earn our degrees.”
Draco cleared his throat. He wasn’t often asked direct questions like that. Draco looked at Harry, who smiled. “He’s...he makes Hogwarts interesting. He lets me make mistakes but also doesn’t let me off the hook. He encourages me to apologize and to be better. He gives me things to look forward to...” Draco stopped there because he was worried he was going to start crying.
Draco felt a rush of affection for Harry but also a little embarrassed and concerned. He was telling Hermione Granger and Neville Longbottom, two powerful individuals with high Ministry standing, that Draco needed to commit a crime tomorrow. Did Harry expect them to not question anything?
It was just Harry and Draco again, and they began to walk back to the train station. “What a day,” Draco sighed.
As for the rest of the letters, Draco hesitantly picked up the first one. He got a paper cut opening it, and sucked on his pointed finger while thumbing through the pages. It was about what he expected, phrases such as “how could you do this to the Wizarding World” and “scum of the Earth” and “you should be in Azkaban.” He told himself it didn’t matter, but somehow he found his father in between those lines from strangers, saying and believing the same things about his own son.
“You wouldn’t want to anyway, my dragon, it’s been days since I’ve had a bath,” Narcissa smiled kindly but tiredly at Draco.
Narcissa remained silent for a moment. She put down her fork and cleared her throat. “Harry Potter is not our mortal enemy, Lucius. And our son is not perverted.”
“Um...I don’t know. I’ll think about it.” Draco was taken aback that Savior Potter was inviting him to anything. The thought of being around everyone and playing Quidditch again made him feel a little sick.
Draco looked up—she seemed to say this last part with quite a lot of emphasis. Did she know that he had snuck out with Harry to Diagon Alley? He was worried enough that Mr. Burke had recognized him...
“I definitely understand how you feel. There are things that I still haven’t talked about with my Mind Healer, and I’m not sure I’ll ever be ready. Hermione is always pushing me to talk about things, which is fine if it works for her, but I’m not sure it works for me. Keep trying, though. I’ve been surprised about how much it has helped sometimes to get things off my chest.”
“Listen, Malfoy, whatever you’re trying to play at, we’re going to figure it out sooner or later,” Zacharias Smith piped up from the back. Most other people nodded.
. “Oh,” Draco said. He shouldn’t be surprised. Vincent and Greg spent nearly all of their free time together. Draco had never seen them kiss or anything, but they were always playfully shoving each other. Besides, Draco was too focused on himself to really notice what others were doing around him. “I—I think that would have been nice.”
Harry Potter morphed before his eyes with a few simple incantations. His hair became a lighter brown, and his face filled out a little. With the glasses Draco could certainly still tell that it was the Boy Who Lived disguised, but it was likely that people wouldn’t notice as they would expect Harry Potter to be either at Hogwarts or in Hogsmeade, not this far away from the safe haven of school.
“It’s your choice, Malfoy,” Ginny said, though she didn’t move from her spot. “What’s it going to be?”
He walked back slowly into their bedroom. Harry was still asleep on the couch, mumbling a little, but not appearing to be in the grips of a nightmare. Draco sighed and took his duvet from his bed, covering Harry with it. He was careful not to wake Harry, and the man turned over and let out a small noise of appeasement. Draco left their bedroom, heart still racing, wanting someone to talk to. He went out to the common area, but it was empty. He almost wished that Granger was awake, stirring her tea, waiting to draw something out of him like poison. But no one was there to startle him like she would. He doubled back and raised a hand to knock quietly on Blaise’s door, then put it down. Mind Healer Christine had always encouraged him to reach out if he felt like he needed to talk to someone. But that felt like asking a lot of him at the moment. Finally, Draco decided to take a walk outside, even though he could get caught and reprimanded.
ago, we were barely—oh Merlin,” Draco said again, at a loss for words. Malfoys never lost their composure in such situations. What else had Draco confessed to people without his knowing?
His eyes kept wandering to the Headmaster’s chair above—once occupied by the man he tried to kill, and more recently by his now dead mentor. Still slightly shaky from his earlier panic attack and not wanting a relapse, Draco reached for his goblet. He thought of firewhiskey, being of age, but found it only filled with water. He drank gratefully anyway—his throat felt dry and scratchy.
After all the chaos on Saturday, Draco couldn’t bear to get out of bed much on Sunday. His friends brought him food and tried to reassure him, but he didn’t have much of an appetite for either food or comfort. Harry gave him space during the day, but at night tried to engage in conversation. Draco was polite enough, but couldn’t bear to talk about anything serious. Part of him was just plain exhausted—he spent nearly the past three months in bed not speaking to anyone, so it had been quite an eventful week. The other part of him knew that he would have to save all his energy for this session today. His original plan was to refuse to speak to the Mind Healer, but now that he knew his probation was hanging on a thread, he would have to try and participate at least a little.
“Well...” Draco felt awkward. He knew that Harry, Blaise, Daphne, and Greg were certainly his friends, so their sacrifice at least made sense. But why were Granger and Longbottom agreeing to do this, after all Draco had done to them? What did they expect in return? “Thank you all. I owe you all...something.”
“Blaise, you were making a scene.” She took a deep breath. “We all need to learn how to be here for each other. We’re all each other has. Draco, if you had talked to one of us instead of running out yesterday, you may not have gotten attacked. I know we’ve never been a bunch to talk about our feelings, even last year, but I think we’ve reached a breaking point.”
The quarters really were quite nice. The side of the room that was clearly Potter’s was red, and in addition to the four-poster bed and wardrobe had a desk and an armchair that sat near the window overlooking the grounds. Draco got an equally large portion of the room which had a fluffy green rug and similar furniture. His trunk was waiting for him at the end of his bed.
His suite hadn’t changed much over the years. He started out with a small crib in the corner of his room next to the window, and then immediately moved to a giant king-sized bed with green satin covers. The crib was moved out and replaced with a couch and chair set complete with a bookshelf in between. He had a window seat to overlook the gardens, and often curled up there with a good book in the summer. In sixth year he ordered Tilly to put curtains around his bed so that he could have some privacy, and some warning should someone enter. While the Dark Lord was living in his home, he would often use his dresser as a barricade. Thankfully the Dark Lord never tried to enter his room, but his Aunt Bellatrix did multiple times and often called him a coward for blocking the entrance. He just wanted to feel safe somewhere, and his room was his only option to do so.
Narcissa sat, picking at her cuticles. Draco didn’t want to scare her half to death, but he had to take his chance while he still could. He slowly slipped the Invisibility Cloak off, and the ruffling of the fabric falling to the ground make her look up.
This was something Harry would never get over. The beauty of magic. The warmth in the air as things were put right. He could feel it. He could breathe it in as it moved around him. For a moment he was alright with it. Then the spell was over, the house was put back the way it was meant to be. And the feeling of magic left him.
“It surprised me more that you were wanting to help young Malfoy'' Dumbledore said. Draco's head snapped up. He didn't like the way that sounded coming from Dumbledore. In fact, everything about the way the headmaster spoke and moved about the room felt uneasy to Draco. It was familiar and it made his skin crawl. ‘Young Malfoy’ it was the way many addressed him, the way many referred to him, and yet. And yet it made him want to run away. Made his throat close up and his fingers tremble. He hated it. And he couldn't place where that hatred came from. He felt sick. “The two of you never have gotten along have you?” He risked a glance at Potter and cringed at the expression peaking through a swollen eye and busted up lip. He had been on the receiving end of such looks from Potter for years. Looking at him like this though, it pulled at him.
His eyes, almost out of habit, glanced to the sky. Nothing here had happened to warrant the dark mark but ever since his fourth year, he’s caught himself looking for it any time a situation feels off.
“I haven’t heard him around yet but feel free to go on up and wake him, no need in him wasting the day lazing about” Harry didn’t point up that the sun only just started to rise a moment ago and it could hardly be considered wasting the day to be asleep at such an early hour. He thanked her and walked up the stairs to Ron's room. He knew the way well. He spent as much time here as he could get away with since second year when Ron and the twins saved him from being trapped behind barred windows.
Here's the thing guys timeline-wise I have backed myself into a corner somewhat. the story is on track but I can't not keep up the alternating povs and the Harry chapters would be entirely too long if I just keep going. so while I have material planned for unconscious Draco as you will read here in a moment there's not very much of it. this is the shortest chapter I have ever posted in I think any of my stories if I'm remembering right and I promise it will be the shortest chapter in this story from now on and the parts that follow since this will be a two or three-part series in future. chapter thirteen I am hoping will make up for the lack of content and should be up within the next day or two at the most.
Nobody knew what happened, in the way that everybody knew what happened. They all had their own version of what went down the night their savior almost died. Almost died, Draco scoffed at the thought. There was no almost about it. Harry Potter was dying if he was not already dead. It’s been a little over a week since anyone heard anything about the health of harry potter.
It was a single shard of glass. He picked the glass up and examined it closely. The edges were jagged and sharp and sent chills through Draco, thinking about how Harry cut himself open with such a crude weapon. He flipped the glass over and saw it was a broken piece of a mirror. It clearly reflected the bags under Draco's eyes. He looked away and quickly shoved it into his pocket. He turned his attention to the wall of sinks behind him, looking for which mirror harry had shattered to get his weapon, but none of the mirrors were even slightly cracked. So he didn't get the piece from this room then. It dawned on Draco that this must have been planned. He must have held onto the piece of broken mirror for a while before he brought himself to do it. That thought filled Draco with a sense of dread as he slid his hand into his pocket and wrapped it around the shard. He knew he should take it straight to Dumbledore, but the thought of handing it over felt wrong somehow. It felt like throwing harry under the bus, but in reality, it would be throwing himself under the bus, showing up in the headmaster's office with the murder weapon in hand. With that kind of proof, Draco would find himself locked away in Azkaban quicker than he could say ‘I didn't do it’. He needed to show someone though, didn't he? Or maybe he didn't, maybe he could keep this to himself. He didn't know what it would do to the wizarding world if they knew their savior tried to kill himself. Draco shook his head and headed out of the bathroom hand still wrapped around the broken glass deep in his pocket. He felt afraid to let it go for some horrible reason.
“Ah, Harry we really must be going” Harry was relieved as Dumbledore reappeared. He needed to get back.
“Head of Slytherin I was. Don’t you go holding it against me either. You would be Gryffindor then eh?. Like your mother.”
“Well go with you,” she said not even stopping to look at the shocked weasel, instead, turning and exiting the room just ahead of him. They walked through the hall side by side in silence. At some point, Weasley must have pulled himself together because he was now just a few paces behind them. Draco knew he must have looked miserable, and wondered if that was what people were staring at or if it was the fact that he was walking peacefully next to Hermione Granger. For good measure, he glared at a group of first and second years, satisfied when they looked properly terrified and stopped staring at him.
“Oh, I don't know maybe you could tell me what happened to Potter?” Blaise was taller than him by a few inches and it infuriated him to no end to have to look up at somebody. People should have to look up to him.
He knew that waiting inside would be a warm meal and hugs and his best friend whom Harry had taken to referring to as his brother. Hermione might even be inside as well. His other best friend. He couldn't bring himself to go inside yet. He sank instead to the front step. The lights were off of course. He had no idea what time it had been when he woke to Draco falling on the floor. Even less how much time he had spent staring at the carpet in Horace’s living room, though Harry came to suspect it wasn’t actually Horace’s place, to begin with. The Weasly’s would no doubt be asleep and while they wouldn’t mind waking up for him he wasn’t about to make them. He wasn’t ready to be around anyone anyways.
They all sat in the now clean sitting room. Every time Horace looked at Harry like he was about to say something Dumbledore spoke up. Harry didn’t much care. He tuned them out and sat looking at his worn-down sneakers. Abruptly Dumbledore stood. Harry hurried to follow suit and the last to rise was Horace looking rather disappointed,
“Okay,” She said slowly, trying to find whatever words she was going to say. She looked almost hurt. Harry bit his lip feeling guilt swell in his stomach. “Harry you have to understand how that sounds” He didn’t really. For days he’d been trying to figure it all out. For days he's been completely lost on the subject. “It sounds like a trap Harry” she sounded apologetic he shook his head at the thought.
Harry pulled himself back to the men in the room. While he was distracted with the clean-up, He must have moved deeper into the room because now he stood in the middle of it. Horace was looking at him the way Harry was so used to strangers looking at him. Wide-eyed and mouth opened in a silent ‘oh’.
He kicked a rock every few steps. The rock slid across the pavement in front of him skipping and jumping along as Harry kicked it. It was a game he liked to play, see how far he can kick a rock from the park all the way to number 4. It was stupid and mindless. But if he made it all the way back and the rock was still in front of him, he’d leave it in the driveway. It always annoyed his Aunt Petunia who took pride in her perfectly manicured front lawn and all the handpicked stones that went there. And when Aunt Petunia was annoyed, she annoyed Uncle Vernon which was always Harrys’ goal. And it’s not like they could tie a stupid little rock to him.
He pushed himself shakily to his feet and brushed out his clothes and ignored the underlying throb that engulfed his entire body. He glanced over his shoulder in time to see the mirror version of himself leaning in to kiss Harry before the picture faded and he could see himself as he was now. Beaten, marked, bloody. He looked back at the Weasley, and Granger, who he hadn't noticed before.
The last of the night sky had disappeared for the day. He was almost to the other side of the park when something caught his eye. A color that felt out of place among the bright primary colors of the play yard and the dirt.
“Yes, I yeah I have it,” Draco said slowly, the idea of handing it over to anyone still made him feel uneasy.  But he pulled it out of his pocket and held it out to her all the same.
Trigger Warnings for this chapter!! it does contain literal torture of a teenager. please skip this chapter if that upsets you!!!
He was a Malfoy. He was a Slytherin, He was a Deatheater if the dark mark on his arm was any indication, not that he could clearly remember how he’d gotten it. He should be taking notes, should be getting ready to return to the manor with everything he’s learned. He should be taking Potter with him, turning him in. He was wounded and weak and it would end the war before it could fully start. This, what he was doing now, went against everything he had been taught to do and say and believe. There were expectations he had to upkeep. There were rules. Harry Potter was the enemy. But he didn’t stop. He didn’t slow. He didn’t let go.
He didn't want to keep it from Ron, he just thought a practice run and perhaps an ally would be helpful. He wanted to tell Hermione first, he thought.
The house looked not just abandoned but much like it should be a crime scene.  If anyone was in there Harry wasn’t sure he wanted to be the one to find them. He had seen more than enough Death and Blood recently. Dumbledore walked up the paved sidewalk to the door. Harry really shouldn’t have been shocked. He followed because at this point his only way back to the castle was Dumbledore, and while he was sure he could catch the train if he really wanted to leave the Headmaster here he would rather get back sooner. Soon as he could, which would mean going along with whatever this plan of his was.
It seeped from a slash that stretched from the bottom of Malfoy’s ribs, across his stomach, and ended at his hip. Harry took in the angry gash for a moment before pressing a towel over the deepest part. Watching Petunia’s fluffy white towel soak up the blood was hypnotizing. The red contrasted against the white in a way that shouldn’t be beautiful, considering the source. There was no hope for the towel. He wondered briefly how long until his aunt noticed she was missing one.
If the walk from the park to the house was rough on Harry’s always aching limbs, it had nothing on the trek up the stairs. His whole body shook when his feet fell on the top step. All at once, the relief at being almost there was replaced with his sinking heart. His bedroom door was wide open. Meaning, his uncle had spent at least a few minutes looking for him this morning. That was never a good sign. He fought against the tremble that had begun to creep up his spine and made his way through the doorway. At least he wouldn't have to worry with another doorknob.
“Ah, so this is how you’ve decided to persuade me” Horace crossed his arms over his chest, much like a child. In fact, Harry was certain he had seen this exact scowly look on Dudleys face when they were younger and Petunia had thought to try and curb Dudley's diet. “Don’t think I don't know what you're trying to do Albus. The answer is no”
So this one is quite a bit longer than previous chapters. what do you prefer? the longer or shorter chapters? let me know!
“Potters dead. Go write to your death eater parents and start celebrating the news.” Draco laid back in his bed, fully clothed on top of the covers.
“I get it, Potter.” Draco slid to the floor his back against Harry's bed. “The pressure you were under, I was under it too.”  Draco dropped Harry's wand  “I'm sorry I couldn't save you harry. I'm so sorry I couldn't keep you safe.” a last tear slid down Draco's face and the room grew fuzzy. “I'm so sorry Harry,” he breathed.
He reached out to touch his shoulder, gently rolling him onto his back, Harry intended to check for breathing and to try to wake him but he stumbled back with a sharp gasp escaping his lips.
Draco's eyes flicked to the empty seat at the table. The seat directly to the right of the Dark Lord, who was talking about something or another. It was dangerous for Draco not to know what was being talked about, but he usually never had to say more than ‘yes, my Lord’ or ‘no, my Lord’.
“Do you want lunch?” Ron asked, clapping his hands together and standing up. Lunch? Had Harry been allowed to sleep that long? And if that much time had passed what was happening to Draco now. Had he woken up to find Harry gone? Would he care? His stomach hurt thinking about it. He shook his head.
“Come on Ron.” Hermione pulled at his arm. She looked like she was close to tears. Draco looked away. Seeing people cry made him very uncomfortable, it was something that was always looked down on in his home growing up.
“Potter,” he whispered barely above a breath. The other boy looked at him, startled and wide-eyed and for a flash of a moment Draco caught himself wanting to go back to that house and… “Are you alright?” it was starting to feel wrong to even think of him as Potter after everything he’d seen.
“Did, did you hear that?” He asked Harry almost pleadingly. He wasn’t surprised when Harry shook his head. It had been his mother's voice and. She was telling him to run. Why would his mother be telling him to run? Why did it feel like so much more than that? He was moving backward, away from Potter away from the almost concern he held in his eyes. In his damned swollen eyes that made Draco think of too large men and cracking noises and busted lips.
“It’s illegal to force someone to take it I was simply asking a question and I'd like it if you gave Draco a chance to answer for himself.”
“Stop,” Someone to his left said. It cut through the sickening glee he felt at the boy's pain. He faced the person who spoke. Harry recognized him and gasped. Voldemort became aware of him then, lurking behind his eyes and they were different people again. Everything went black as Harry was forced out of the moment.
“Your… your safe” the word safe tasted like a lie in his mouth. Tasted like acid and made the back of his left hand itch.
“I must admit I was surprised, Harry, to receive your letter. I had thought Hedwig was locked up on your time home.” What the bloody hell was this oafe even saying right now. He thought he heard Potter laugh quietly, almost bitterly, beside him.
“Ah yes.  Lily lovely Lily” Horace said in a way that made Harry want to steal away the photo and keep it for himself. She was young and smiling, it was the first time he had seen a picture of her this young. “She was one of mine, your mother,” Harry bristled “Lily Evans. One of the brightest I ever taught. so full of life she was beautiful too, you know. Charming girl, I used to tell her she ought to have been a Slytherin. Bus she wouldn't hear of it. had quite the smart mouth.” Harry set the frame down and turned to look at Horace more closely.
“Draco” His father hissed as quietly as he could, trying not to draw attention to them. Draco looked over his father who was glancing pointedly at Dracos hands. The trembling had gotten worse. Silently Draco took a breath and forced them to be still before blinking coldly at his father and turning away. His father recently taught him to be unwavering. To be stone cold. One thing Draco was good at was pretending.
His door opened and Draco was quick to jump up and fix his hair to lay flat and perfect again. But when he looked his mother wasn’t looking at him, but at the ring, lying abandoned on the dresser. She’d never seen him take it off.
“We deserve to know what this rat did to Harry.” Ron raged. Draco looked over to see The mudblood physically holding Ron's arms back to keep the weasel from pouncing on him again.
Harry wiped sweat off his forehead. Yeah, he hated the heat, but it was far better than being in that house all day. He much preferred sitting in an abandoned swing or riding around on trains all day to the way things were at home. No, the Dursleys was not a home. These days Harry wasn’t sure where ‘home’ could be.
“Go on Poppy. Hurry.” Dumbledore said as calm as he always was. She disappeared with a snap. “Everyone else goes to your dormitories, now,” he said exuding so much authority everyone was gone within seconds. Everyone except Draco and of course Harry's beloved friends who were already making there way over to him.
“Leaving so soon?” Horace said with an air of disappointment. Harry would argue they’d been here for hours. Drinking and talking about pointless things.
Draco glanced back at the empty seat only to realize at some point Severus Snape had joined the group. It wasn’t good that Draco could miss that. If he missed too much he’d get himself into trouble. He tuned back into the meeting.
“You killed him!” Ron spat in Draco's face but he did nothing to deny it. What was the point? Harry Potter is dead and nobody is going to believe anything Draco had to say. Besides who would honestly believe that Harry Potter, the boy who lived, The golden boy, The savior of the damn Wizarding world, would try and take his own life? The realization of that overwhelmed Draco. Was that honestly and truly what happened. Harry Potter tried to kill himself?  Harry Potter had slit his wrists in such a horrific way, try as he might Draco couldn't erase the picture now embedded in his memory. Within seconds of Ron’s outburst, pain exploded across his face. Draco didn't try to stop him, He just laid there taking everything the weasel could throw at him, knowing it wasn't enough, knowing it could never be enough. It wasn't long enough before Ron was hauled off of him, leaving Draco lying on the floor, dazed and awaiting the next strike.
What had that been? He knew it wasn’t him. He hadn’t done any form of accidental magic since the summer before his third year. No matter how upset he got or how hurt he was he hadn’t wanted to risk expulsion. So he knew it wasn’t coming from him.
“Is Ron up?” He asked, he felt a bit rude by doing so but if anything was going to make him feel better it would be him.
“You can go if you want. You didn't have to stay here for me” Ron gave him a look that screamed ‘you've got to be kidding me’ and took another bite of sandwich.
Furniture reformed and stood upright, keys found their place back on a piano in the corner of the room. The stain seemed to be absorbed by the rug. The chandelier rose almost directly in front of him and fixed itself back on the ceiling, the dust of broken crystal lifted and swirled together as if on the wind until the pieces were whole again, attaching to the chandelier. The room lit up with the replacement of it.
Harry sat in his swing and kicked the dirt. He was alone. And it was quiet. But there was something in the air that felt… well it felt like magic.
“Oh, you mustn't think me prejudiced!” Oh, must he not? “No no no haven’t I just said your mother was one of my all-time favorites?” Harry was failing to see how that made anything better. He found himself wondering what was taking Dumbledore so long to come back. He was pointing out the other frames, the ones that Harry hadn’t bothered with. Telling him all about who was who and what they did for him. What gifts they sent him.
“Malfoy?” He shook his head. He didn't want to hear that name. But he said nothing about it. “Are you alright?” The same question Draco had asked of him earlier.
“I see,” she said. “Now Draco. I know you were the one who got me here. And I thank you for that. But nobody knows how exactly you found him. I know it might not be something you want to talk about I know the headmaster has told me you don't but I was hoping you wouldn't mind terribly sitting down and talking with me for a just a few minutes.” she said as she pointed her wand towards Dracos black eye.
“Get some sleep Harry,” She said and left before he could ask. He sat in the middle of the bed wrapped up in himself for unknowable hours. He hated to admit but he was afraid of falling asleep. Exhaustion pulled at him, begged him to relax into the pillow and blankets. In the end, it had to have won. He had no memory of laying down, no recollection of uncurling himself. But here he was, feet tangled in sweat-soaked sheets and the sun high in the sky. Far too high for it to be morning.
Harry Potter, Golden boy, The Chosen One, Saviour of the Wizarding World, Harry Potter down the bloody stairs.
There was a sound, so low, almost nonexistent and if it hadn't been for the massive amount of attention Draco was paying to the noises surrounding him he probably wouldn't have noticed. It wasn't obvious and for a moment he thought he made it up. He stood upright and listened. It took a few moments, few moments that he later regretted hesitating on. But soon he heard what had made him pause. It sounded like someone was breathing. But it was so light. Draco turned around to face the room. Who dared to interrupt in his moment of weakness? Nobody could be seen, only stall doors and shadows. But still, a shallow breathing could be heard.
The next morning Harry left before anyone woke up to tell him what he needed to do, sure it might piss them off later if they remember. He woke and snuck out before light could even begin to touch his bedroom. He left before his uncle even started to get ready for work. Sure he was tired. Dead tired. He hadn’t much been able to sleep after… well, just after.
“-but not faintly harm one another, if I am to kill him.” The Dark Lord walked past Draco and he felt himself stiffen slightly. “I am to do so with another's wand. Come, surely one of you would like the honor?” there was that word again. Honor. The Dark Lord was walking back towards them now. “Hmm? What about you?” Draco almost choked. He was staring straight ahead. Please please not me. He thought desperately. “Lucius?” To Dracos left he could see the Dark Lord’s hand reaching out to his father.
Ginny’s eyes widened, and for the first time since they’d stopped, Draco saw the fear in them. The helplessness. He stilled, watching the play in her face. She studied him for a tense moment, so close that her exhalations skated over his face. And then she nodded.
But she didn’t cry. Her jaw finally jutted out, and Harry saw with relief that she’d moved past it. She wasn’t even looking at him anymore, not really seeing him. Her attention was fixed somewhere far away.
“Do you have any plans we could put to good use?” Goyle murmured. “Or… maybe that lover of yours? Where is he this time of year?”
through him, eating up his muscles. Blaise cried out and let go, reaching for the hurt instead, the horror. He found his shirt ripped, his arm bleeding, and her head rearing for another strike. Blaise threw himself back with all his strength and just barely avoided the flashing teeth. She closed in, fangs bared. Blaise jabbed out with his wand and the snake actually screeched, a high-pitched sound that caromed through his ears. She flailed with her whole body, tail lashing madly over the floor, catching him across the legs. She jerked herself free of the wand point embedded into her eye.
Harry’s laugh had drawn Draco Malfoy’s attention as well. Malfoy stood several paces from the door, crisp white shirt opened just at his throat. His face was a mixture of annoyance and weariness, gaze fixed on Harry, who, Hermione could see, was quite oblivious to the noise he was making. Of course, things were already loud; why Harry’s voice should cut such a swath through it, she wasn’t sure, but it did. The freedom in the sound was rare.
“We can tailor a specific enchantment into the paint,” Hermione whispered, staring at the flagstones like a berated school girl, “to guard you from everyone else and only let Draco’s magic through.”
Harry’s eyes tracked back to Seamus’ face. Seamus squinted. There was an odd glow humming about the edges of Harry’s face, his hair and mouth and… and eyes. Very faint. Seamus’ chest clutched, oddly soothed and yet hurting terribly at the same time. Not the same pain, but so, so familiar. And then Harry looked away and it was gone, leaving Seamus to the raging aches of his body.
that aren’t working, and they should be! I can’t even begin to explain it. His… his kidneys, for example. His lungs are struggling and I can’t find a reason for it. He has massive internal bleeding and his body is
Harry had arrived in the Infirmary that morning, clean-clothed and alert, and Ginny had found one last sprig of hope in the twisted thorns in her chest. His eyes, vibrant jade, had widened when he saw her, and there was no hint of the anxiety she had been feeling all night. Perhaps… perhaps he had just gone to bed, and been caught up in more important things for the past day. Perhaps he’d wanted to give her time alone with Fred and George.
Her tone was clipped, almost annoyed. For a moment, Harry was back with his old Headmistress as she eyed him down the length of her nose. He smiled and took an ancient scroll over to the table.
The notes, whispery and shy at first, gathered strength. Harry was certain it wasn’t so much his strength as Luna coaxing the music from him. But he was glad to let it come. It twined around the harp sounds, and Luna’s voice rode above them both, mantling itself in their luxury.
