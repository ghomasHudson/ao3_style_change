"I-I should leave, it's late already," he said, still shaking.
After Severus researched his mind and found strong barriers and false memories, he feared that everything the letter said was true. So, he asked Severus to destroy the barriers and eliminate false memories, but he hadn't felt or remembered anything different so Severus used
"As soon as I found out about the Black Mansion, I'll let you know, for the moment I'm going to rest – his voice had no inflection making it difficult for godfather to know what his opinion was about what he had to do.
"Don't even dream that I’ll leave you guys alone in a room Ginevra Weasley!" he exclaimed annoyed.
- I thought I was grounded and couldn't get out of my room, - He knew it was a good opportunity to get fresh air, but Harry couldn't help but be disturbed when he had a chance.
– I'd rather not talk about it again, why don’t we …
"Purity," Severus said and walked in.
They came out of the greenhouses and said goodbye to Theo and Blaise who were going to send an owl. Draco and Harry headed to their common room along with another group from their house.
With a wrist movement, he opened the door, revealing a Severus in his classic black robe. He looked relaxed as usual, but the Dark Lord was able to see a couple of drops slip down his forehead, a sign that he had run to get there as soon as possible. He could not suppress a smile of satisfaction at the fact that the man was still afraid of him.
Harry had to swallow the acidic response he had for Ron’s idiocy when he heard seven different voices exclaim Ron!, while he received a swat to the back of his head from his mom.
He felt his fangs grow and told himself to stop before he did something crazy, but before that he indulged once more in the sight before him, once again staring at the beautiful body he had before him.
and that bothered him even more because he felt he was missing something important.
"I know, but I'm counting on Hermione, I know she'll know how to make him understand things," he said quietly.
He quickly approached under the watchful eye of his "dear" cousin but when he saw one of his hands climb up over the Gryffindor’s back, he snarled before pulling Harry to him with strength. He saw that the man was about to protest but before he did, he was detained by the grip of Professor Lupin, who just smiled amused.
– Draco – he whispered.
"Oh come on Harry, don't be a party pooper, join us," they said laughing.
Harry shuddered just thinking about it. The truth is, he hadn't thought of that.
He finished reading just as he heard the shower go out. He kept the letter in the envelope and placed it on the bedside table. He lifted his gaze at the same time as a white, good-looking, tall man with long black hair and beautiful gray eyes came out. He was wrapped only with a towel at his waist exposing his muscular abdomen and tunned legs. He looked up smiling with rascality.
"Yes Remus, thank you," he said incorporating himself. – “My fath.. is Tom still here?" He asked stirring in Draco's arms, who had risen along with Harry and hugged him in the back.
Harry hugged her and followed her inside the house. When they arrived at the dining room, he was amazed to find the whole family there, he did not expect to see Bill, Fleur, and Charly.
They turned around, but before advancing a couple of steps Draco saw a hand fall on Harry's shoulder and turn him around violently. Without even thinking, he turned quickly and raised his right hand by pushing with his magic to the ungainly body of the redhead against the back of the classroom leaving him unconscious.
– Of course, he’s okay, you don't have to worry about that. And regarding the fact about them pestering him- he let out a small chuckle – well that’s more than probable. – he saw as he clenched his fits and frowned – But more or less interrogation from Hermione’s part- he turned and walked towards the door and added – just so give you some peace of mind ill tell you that Harry does not like Ginny, at least not in that way, she is like a sister for him.
“Is there anything wrong, Sorting Hat? – asked Dumbledore staring at him.
He didn't know how long it had been, he was so focused on his reading that he was startled when Harry wallowed in bed and looked just in time to see Nagini slide down the bed.
Voldemort smiled pleased, that boy was an excellent Slytherin.
The remaining two days were quiet and by that last night, they had scheduled a special dinner.
They entered the chimney together and threw flu powders as he pronounced "Grimmauld Place Number 12".
“Draco! Someone could see us," Harry said pulling away with a blush.
"Harry, I think you should go for the portkey you lent him yesterday," he said slowly looking at Draco. He saw Harry nod and ran up the stairs– it isn’t necessary to tell you that no matter what you have to do, don’t let him get to Harry without knowing his intentions. Right?
Tom guessed what was coming and knew he wouldn't like it in the slightest.
When he finally made it down he realized that the kitchen was full of all the murmurs of the family members and he felt that he was beginning to lack air, he was afraid of looking at them in the face and in no way did the fact that the twin’s words resonated loudly in his head as if amusing themselves with him and his naivety.
The afternoon passed slow and fast at the same time, as Harry wanted to know what was hidden from him and at the same time preferred to remain in ignorance, he did not want to feel any more pain than he felt. But since nothing lasts forever, he had to gather his courage to place some sleeping draught in the glass of milk he offered Ron before going to bed, courtesy of the twins. He went to bed and five minutes later Ron was sleeping soundly, and he would for some time. He got out of the room quietly and went towards the back garden where they had arranged to meet to
ancestor! Besides, how dare you destroy my diary!? – he shouted, shaking the boy completely frightened.
"I hadn't thought about that Moony, but I think you're right – and then added in a lower tone – or so I hope.
Harry looked at him scared.
"Oh, come on, you deserve it too," Harry said, surprising everyone and Severus himself when he felt the brunette hug him.
Harry smiled gratefully at them.
I was worried about Harry, I wanted to know why he had ended up asleep or passed out or whatever, but he also wanted to think about how to proceed in front of the Lord. When he sent him to the bathtub with ice water he had time to think about what had happened a few hours earlier. He should not have kissed Harry, he overlooked the ancient pure-blooded traditions, and the Lord had been within his right to do what he did and even more. But he would fix it as soon as possible, because, if he was sure of anything it was the fact that he wouldn’t let anybody get between him and Harry.
– Moony you know how he is; he will feel betrayed.  I’m afraid he won’t forgive me for all the pain I caused him, you know how much I love him, and I don’t think I can stand for his rejection,” he said with his eyes on the ground, - but I don’t know who his other father is and I can’t leave him again, he’ll need us to deal with the situation.
He hadn't realized that his eyes had been stained red, but Nagini and Severus had noticed and that was why the poor snake was curled in a corner and Severus had a trembling hand on the doorknob without turning his eyes away from the man in front of him.
"I see Tom kept his word for the Slytherins," he said, going into bed and patting next to him.
Two hours later the team was formed, with Draco as captain and Keeper; Harry as a seeker; Marcus Flint, Adrian Pucey and Graham Montague as chasers; Gregory Goyle and Vincent Crabbe as Beaters.
"I know, Professor, that's why I want to be selected again," he saw mistrust in Dumbledore’s eyes, and he decided to get his ace out. “I have a plan that I know will work and will flip the board in my favor.”  Harry knew he wasn't lying, the board would be in his favor, but that didn't mean it included the Order and the Headmaster.
When they saw the sender everyone was astonished, but no one took it. Until it got up in the air in front of Harry.
– Oh Black, couldn't you wait longer before returning? He said with annoyance and slight disgust.
– Thank you. Yes, I'll leave before it gets dark, but I'll be back in a couple of days – Harry looked at him with insecurity for a couple of seconds and then scooted over to make room for Draco to lay down. Draco looked at him surprised and rapidly turned towards the door – Don’t worry about him. Come on. – he said extending his hand for a couple of seconds before he took it.
Harry wanted to believe, but he didn't want to get hurt if it turned out not to be true. Draco watched the brunette, saw his indecision and the glow of hope in his green eyes. He was so baffled by what was happening that he had forgotten a simple spell of recognition that his father had taught him years ago. He got closer to the brunets’ body to disguise his wand and pronounce the spell slowly.
Remus went in and smiled fondly at the image.
"Enough," he said, rubbing his arms, "this is very uncomfortable.
Without him noticing he had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady and the professor gave her the password. He went in followed by Harry. The pregnant silence that followed his entrance made Harry uncomfortable.
"Come on, the train's about to leave," he said goodbye to the adults with a nod and they both crossed the barrier.
Harry was lying down with his bag ready in bed, thinking about the way to tell his friends and family the truth. He feared their reaction and possible rejection, he did not want to be seen as a monster or as the son of a monster; he loved them like the family he never had and if they turned him down, he didn't know what he would do. On the other hand, there was Draco, he knew he was leaving for a couple of days, but he couldn't help thinking that he wouldn't see him and that he was going to miss him. It was foolish, he knew it because they had only been friends for a few days, but he was by his side when he discovered his origin and recovered the one he believed to be his only living relative; besides that, Draco had accepted him even being the son of who he was and he had promised that he would help him bring his parents back, or rather his dad and Lily. If he was honest with himself, he had already grown accustomed to his presence and he would need it those days.
open it but
He found his godfather waiting for him in the living room and walked closer to him.
"Oh, Mom went to call them, they'd be right down," he said, looking at Fleur and her brother.
"I was just coming to say goodbye, I guess you're leaving in a few hours," he said indecisively.
– It's good to know that some of your old habits are still there. I'll take your word. Bring me tea with some milk and biscuits, preferably...
has very strong emotions. But this time it was worse because his emotions changed drastically – he ended up thoughtful.
"I-I don't know what you’re talking about," he replied uncomfortably.
Harry was going to ask something else, but he was interrupted by the Headmaster’s arrival.
"Hey guys, how are you doing with your inventions?" he asked innocently.
"You know Draco, I have a mission for you–he saw the boy tense and smiled – but that shouldn't worry you, is not at all difficult. Although I must admit that my original plans have changed, so for now I'll just ask you to find out if you can access Mansion Black and...– he stood in front of the boy and looked him in the eye – to befriend Harry Potter when you return to Hogwarts.
"It wasn't my fault, go take it out on my uncles! -  He said frowning, giving the stranger a defiant look. He didn’t like people mentioning his size or his body missing a few pounds. -Besides, who are you, and why have you invaded our house in such a manner? – he asked taking a step back.
– Potter – Tom hissed dangerously low, causing a chill on everyone present except the person he wanted.
After dinner, they went into the living room to talk.
"Thank you, Draco. " Harry placed a kiss on his cheek before he walked to the bathroom. "I'll see you at dinner."
"Yes, it's just that Master Harry doesn't want...– he stopped; he shouldn't disobey his master.
He said, looking at him with hate.
Harry nodded as he smiled and set aside, palming the empty space with his right hand.
– Look, Paddy, Hedwig brought Harry's letters!  – he quickly approached followed by Sirius – I don't think we'll have to wait any longer to meet with little Prongs.
The two Blacks stopped their diatribe and looked at Remus in surprise.
Harry awoke with a strange feeling, though after all, he found out last night it would be expected. Still, when he got up, he couldn't help but think he'd need Draco with him at the end of the day and he didn't like it at all. He took advantage of the opportunity that not everyone was awake and took a quick shower and dresses for breakfast.
"I was not expecting that, but all the more reason we start with those classes young man," he looked at Harry's face of desolation, and added, "I'm not mistaken I assuming Young Malfoy knows Occlumency, maybe in his spare time he could help us show you tricks that will aid you in managing it sooner.
– Don't do anything Draco! "He said hastily –They will have the protection of the ministry and the Headmaster. I don't want you to get hurt because of me," he said, worried.
"I'll kill them slowly," he said, striding towards Harry who backed in fear until he hit the wall.
– What's wrong Potter, don't you recognize me? –  he asked with a mocking grin, making his eyes shine mischievously.
The elf disappeared the bag with a snap of fingers and instead, an old book of potions bound in dark skin and golden letters appeared.
“Harry”. Draco gasped.
enough who dares touch Harry will pay dearly, " he says giving them all a murderous look.
He was devastated to learn that maybe this were the last nights he would spend at Ron's house with his family, but there was no turning back. He did not notice when tears began to fall silently down his cheeks. He let out the pain and minutes later he fell asleep.
He looked at Draco and smiled at him in gratitude, took Hedwig's cage, and nodded towards Draco.
"But if that's true, and you've joined You-Know-Who," Neville said, looking at everyone, "I'm sure you would do it to protect us and not to betray us. That wouldn't be you, you'd never leave us, right guys? – he asked with certainty.
He inhaled and exhaled deeply and began to tell them everything he had experienced in the Burrow, relying on Draco's support in the most difficult moments. When he finally finished, he felt very tired, but also free from that loneliness that had been installed in his heart upon knowledge of the betrayal.
Harry blinked surprised.
"I hope that sigh is because you missed me– he spoke amused.
“So urgent that it cannot wait until after the selection? – she asked with concern looking at him with scrutiny looking for wounds.
He went up to his room and looked for comfortable clothes. He was worried about Draco; he had been out for almost two hours and was afraid that Vold...
Harry let out a laugh, they didn't even know how close they were.
Harry looked at him in horror, he had never made him so afraid as he was at that moment, not even when he almost killed him at the cemetery.  He heard a chuckle and looked at Sirius with astonishment.
– And what if when I grow up I become like him? What if...
– Is there anything wrong with my clothes? – he asked, observing himself.
But Malfoy only watched the parchment in front of him engrossed.
He would surely cruciate that snake one of these the point of exhaustion. Voldemort squirted his eyes dangerously causing a shudder in his "guests."
Draco quickly approached to open the window as he recognized his godfather's owl.
Voldemort had left the pensieve a few minutes ago, but he still couldn't believe what he had found in those memories. He found it truly incredible to believe that the little malnourished boy he had seen grow up as his worst enemy was actually his son,
Harry was surprised but closed his eyes when he felt Draco kiss him and enjoyed the caress. When he heard the disappearance, he lay down on the couch while waiting for Draco to return.
Harry touched Draco's shoulder reassuringly before answering.
I will also revisit previous chapters and edit them since none of the chapters have been edited for errors and mistakes. I am human and sometimes my bilingual brain sees an error and understands it so I sometimes skip them unintentionally. And sometimes some phrases in Spanish make no sense in English in its literal translation so I try to explain them in my notes and search for other prases in English that fit. I know many of these errors were stated in the comments. Worry not, I will edit them and correct them.
"Yes, I'm used to this kind of thing every year," he said, shrugging.
Frustrated, he kicked the chair next to him and it fell with a deaf blow a few thousandths of a second before the sound of an appearance was heard right in front of his house.
Harry felt himself being expelled out of the memory abruptly. He ended up on his knees on the cold ground, panting. When he had sufficiently recovered from the ordeal, he picked up the
– Good, good. Let's not turn this into a meaningless discussion. Let's catch up and see what we do next– he looked at Harry and added—You guys start.
–Atta boy my little Prongs. We'll help you if that's what you want. You have our support and I guess my
"Wow, Harry, I must say it doesn't sound very far-fetched, but my dear boy, I don't know if it will work," he said, leaning back on the chair. “Because for that you'd have to give up your friends, we both know what Mr. Malfoy thinks of Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger. I don't think you'll be able to withstand Mr. Malfoy's humiliations. Without adding that you will be seen as a traitor throughout the school” – he ended up staring at him.
He watched his godfather and Remus look at each other for a second before nodding and turning to the couple in front of them.
– Your wand, please.
"Like you little cousin?" he asked malice – It shows that you are not worried about Harry, you are very preoccupied with that book.
"Draco is not what you're thinking," Harry said, "they just...
"Tell us, Harry, how did you meet and become
"No, of course, he hasn’t been here Harry - Ron replied before Hermione spoke.
“I know, it’s a term of endearment. I know you're all man," he replied, slipping his hands down the boy's hips.
– Harry! Your scar is bleeding!
"We won't tell our mother that you gave us the money, but tell us, Harry, why are you worried about what our mother says? " they asked.
"All right Severus, we're leaving," he said, "we have a lot of things to do," he looked at the others, and he added, "I'll be back in a few hours for dinner. We must agree on a few points before Potter's return to Hogwarts. My elf will bring you everything needed to feed Potter properly," he said, turning around-  "By the way, don't worry about the wards, I'll put new and more powerful ones" With that said, he went out with Severus after him.
Sirius and Remus came from their walk through the city streets when they saw a beautiful white owl they instantly recognized.
money before returning from school, knowing that the privileges granted by his godfather would end when the Dursleys knew that Sirius had died.Not that he was going to tell them, but he had not wanted to risk that, somehow, they would find out and he had to go hungry; because the last thing he wanted to do was worry Ron and Hermione more than they already were because of what had happened in the ministry.
A minute later the room protections fell, Draco quickly sat up and with the book under his arm he left the room and headed towards the kitchen. But when he got to the kitchen, he could only hear Potter telling the elf to let him walk around the house but to take notice of what he did and what he touched while he followed the Black family loving elf to a room. Draco got to see just before they left the hallway an envelope in Harry’s hands. He let out a sigh of frustration and returned to lock himself in the room.
"About Harry Potter, my Lord," he said with
– That's obvious Harry, but you don't have to tell us where you are or with who, that's something that's better kept with you.
"Excuse me, Professor McGonagall—called Harry controlling as best as possible the tremor of his voice and looking the teacher in the eye.
Minutes later Harry disappeared with Dobby towards the burrow.
Many miles away things were very different.
The blonde lay in the free space of the bed feeling uncomfortable, so he crossed his arms behind his head without looked at the brunet. The latter watched the blonde lie next to him and after a few seconds of hesitation snuggled up to his right side to feel his warmth, he felt the blonde get uncomfortable with his closeness but didn’t reject him, so Harry didn’t move.
"Of course not, the important thing is that you're okay," he said, getting up with his Harry in his arms, "I'll take you to your room so you can rest.
"Thank you, Colin," he said, smiling, "and I'm Harry, not Potter. See you around”
He let all the memories fall impatiently inside the pensieve and he dived.
– All right, then give me half an hour. I'll go up for my wand and go to the Mansion for a change of clothes and come back to help you with the enchantments... and to be here in case things get out of hand- he saw that the brunette was going to protest, but shut him up before he spoke- I know you can't say anything about what you are doing, I'll just be around in case something happens. Just for that, so calm down—The blonde explains, raising his hands in a sign of surrender.
– I'm ready Paddy just needed to pick up a few things. Let's go – he smiled at Sirius's emotion, he looked like a little boy who had been promised a popsicle upon arrival.
– Harry, who is that man? – he looked at him from top to bottom hiding his envy. “and where did you get those clothes? I don't think Dumbledore would like you being accompanied by some stranger and...
Greetings again. Another wonderful and intriguing chapter brought to you by our dear author VampirepPrincess27.
– If it were up to me, you wouldn't leave this room, brat. But Dudley didn't want to go out on the street, he says he heard a very loud sound in front of the house -. He turned around and left the list on the bedside table and before he left, he added — You have half an hour to return—and slammed the door.
While Remus was cautiously driving him to the couch, Sirius brought him a well-loaded cup of tea.
"I'm not leaving, I'll just bring a seat. -  he tried to pry his sleeve, but Potter held tightly.
He was so lost in his thoughts that he didn't see that a redhead came right in front of him.
Harry looked at them without quite understanding what they were referring to, but something inside him told him it wasn't a good thing.
don’t I
CREATOR:@VampirePrincess27
His heart was beating wildly as he began to glide his eyes at the first words.
– Severus, you will have time to continue lamenting your bad luck later. For now, I want to know how the research I asked for is going, now more than ever I need to regain my appearance.
Malfoy was standing in front of his bureau. He felt his soul fall to the ground.
–It looks like our little Harry is in love, don’t you think so, George.
Harry went out downcast into his common room.
– I know. My elf told me that the
– Why Harry? It shouldn’t be the scar again, right? – she asked evaluating him with her eyes.
He smiled arrogantly before pulling Harry around the waist and bringing him completely to his chest, looking at the blonde.
– "Yes sir, Dobby gets paid for his work and gets one day off a month."
Everyone sat there staring at the figure of the man disappearing down the aisle. The moment he disappeared from the hall; they saw the boy with unruly black hair hasten towards the hallway.
"Of course, the seed was already sown, they believed everything I told them, and I got them to think it was the best thing for everyone," he saw the woman rise in front of him.
The conviction in Harry's voice gave him strength for what was coming. He nodded and answered his godfather’s letter.
"My lord" they bowed and left the room quickly.
The letter was dated almost 16 years ago, but as much as he tried to remember something, his mind went blank. He’d never been with anyone, yes, had had one-night stands, but he never slept with the same person twice and he had
on the chair next to the bed.
"After all, we're both Black," Draco replied with malice, "and it's not like I need your permission, Black, I already have the consent of the Dark Lord," He said arrogantly, and he smiled at the stupefied look in their faces  – "All right, I'm going to go see how Harry's doing". He turned around and headed for the stairs.
Draco didn't know how to take his godfather’s advice, but he'd think about it later. He walked to the panel that was hidden in his room and pull out a small box, smiled slightly, and placed it in his robe before leaving.
– You guys win! I'll go for the weekend, but don't expect me to stay with them for the rest of the holidays! I have to see Tom before we go to Hogwarts– he saw the cheerful face of his godfather and decided to annoy him –  Oh, but yes, it will be with the condition that Draco stays here at the mansion. I want him to be here when I return from the burrow. – he saw the grimace and he smiled triumphantly. Even though he didn’t know why his godfather didn’t tolerate Draco, he used it all the time to annoy him.
He felt that the heat from his body was beginning to stay in his lower parts and he told himself that he needed a cold shower urgently.
THIS IS A TRANSLATION FROM THE ORIGINAL WORK IN SPANISH BY MY DEAR FRIEND @VampirePrincess27.
– Ah! It's you – but before she continued, she noticed the presence of someone else and turned to observe it.
Tom was sitting in the living room looking thoughtful. He turned his wand distractedly as he held a letter in his left hand. The irony of this situation had not overlooked him. It was the second time he was in this situation, only that they were two different people and two kinds of feelings. He was so self-absorbed that he didn't notice Nagini's entrance.
"There's no time to waste, I'll just tell you to moderate your questions – he spoke quickly – but above all, for nothing in the world, don't you ever think of insulting Potter. That boy turned out to be even more important to the Lord than he already was. Now let's go.
They laughed happily but Harry noticed a couple of more insistent looks than the others. He looked up just in time to see the twins watching him seriously while the others were distracted, but when they were discovered they smiled faintly. Harry knew there was something else, but he had no idea how to find out, so he did the only thing he could: pretend nothing was wrong.
"Of course, it couldn't be any other way," he smiled sideways.
“Harry, we don't believe them. They're saying that you joined You- know-Who and that's why you're going to Slytherin, that you're a traitor," Angelina said, and she denied frantically, “but I don't think so; I always knew that Ronald was envious of your fame and Hermione just wants to use your influence, but that doesn't mean you'd abandon us for something so low” she finishes with conviction.
– I could break this spell by spell and end the barriers, but it would give The Order time if any alarm is triggered. So better...– He directed his wand to the ground and uttered another spell in parsel. Immediately a dense haze began to come out of his wand and began to slip between the silver threads – destroy them all, together.
"Harry you must understand that things are not easy for the family at the moment and that everyone makes the decision they think is right  – they came up to him and put a hand on each shoulder and looked at him fondly – but we too have made a decision we think is right.
"I'll think about it, Potter, but...—he saw the boy's grimace of disgust and he breathed in —I don't assure you much, Harry.-  The last word was said a couple of shades lower. He felt tremendously uncomfortable but the smile on his son's face might be worth it— Concerning the scar I can't tell you what's going on, I'll get Severus to investigate. All right let's stop wasting our time and tell me what happened at the Weasleys' house—he saw his son's smile disappeared and he narrowed his eyes dangerously.
– To us! –  they said together.
– I don't know yet, maybe... Draco is the only one, apart from the twins, whom I can trust," he said, fighting the knot in his throat.
Translator's Notes
He said like it was obvious – “Plus that kid's a pervert, don't you remember how he had Harry when we got here by flu?! – He asks looking at Remus in disbelief.
After a few minutes, everyone started to retire and get some rest, so he didn’t have any other choice than to follow his friends toward the room. He went in after Hermione, Ron coming in behind him. He desired this conversation as much as a Cruciatus from his father, but he could at least divert the topic. Before they began, he raised his barriers, he didn’t think they knew Legilimency, but he couldn’t be careless.
Translator's Notes
He walked towards the table and took the letter, unfolded it, and read.
“Of course, today I will practice some Quidditch. Of course, if His Majesty accepts me," he said, smiling and bowing in a teasing manner.
They both laughed joyfully as the upsetting moment had passed.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry counted to ten before he spoke again, he didn't want to fight Ron before he knew whether or not he could trust him.
He was so focused that he didn't realize he was just circling around his armchair, nor did he realize that a pair of sneering eyes were following his movements.
– I... I am sorry. He was very tired, and I told him to rest while we waited but I didn't hear you come out, I’ve best wake him up," he said nervously.
Draco felt as if he been kicked in his stomach. Did that mean the Lord already knew Harry was his son?
Tom was surprised by the sudden question but still nodded.
"Let Snivellus know that Harry has to go to the Weasleys' house– he stared at him for a few seconds before he spoke again – I suppose you're relieved to know that he won't have to see that being –he was pleased with the boy's serious assent and smiled to himself, as he liked to make the boy uncomfortable– Now hurry in sending that owl. The last thing we need is a problem because of his absence tomorrow – having said this he turned around and went towards his room; He had to take a bath to relax, leaving both men alone.
–I want to talk to him, Hermione.
– Oh no, guys! Don't tell me it's because of the money I gave you; If so, Mrs. Weasley will kill me," he said, really worried.
– Hello Harry – Fleur came up and hugged him hard before kissing him on the cheek, her accent noticeable.
"Harry, I know the last thing you want to do is remember everything, but if so, things will get even harder and we have to know exactly what happened to be prepared," he saw Harry nod and added, "we'll make you some tea and wait for you in the room when you're ready, right, Sirius? –  he asked with a tone that left no room for discussion.
PS. anyone caught that reference?
ps. I will be editing the earlier chapters and fixing some of the orthographical errors.
"Oh look, but if it isn’t traitorous Potter
"If you say so, but well we didn't come to disturb your fantasies – they looked at each other before they went on – there's something important that we have to tell you Harry, but we don't know if you...—but they were interrupted by Harry.
– At the moment it is not much, I just need you to go with me to Gringotts bank and if should any problems arise you disappear with me. I also wanted to ask you to please tell no one; not Dumbledore, not anyone. Could you?
The next thing he felt was the sun's rays falling directly on his face and he knew he hadn't closed the curtains at night.
– Draco Lucius Malfoy Black! Stop! – screamed a mad Sirius – Stop walking around the room! Don’t you see you are about to give me a nervous breakdown? – he said breathing rapidly.
Harry rolled his eyes at the password, but still went in, the portrait closed behind him. he didn’t even look up from the ground or pay attention to what Severus said, he kept trying to understand what had happened outside with Draco.
The elf appeared before them bowing to Harry.
Harry startled at being discovered and got up and went to sit next to the blond.
– Whatever the reason, you'll be fine. Don't worry – Harry turned around and pulled an object out of his robe – take this with you. It's a portkey The Order gave me at the end of this course in case I needed it and it will bring you straight towards Grimmauld Place.
“Haven't you been able to find out anything else?”  He said without hiding his disappointment.
Tom connected his gaze with green eyes equal to his own and smiled, but the object of his perusal was covered with another body that was a little taller. Annoyed, he fixed his gaze on orbs gray and cold as ice.
"Oh Harry dear, good morning– she came up and kissed him on the cheek – I suppose you're leaving today – she looked at Hermine and Ron with the corner of her eyes.
At Black Mansion, the atmosphere was depressing since Harry had departed. No one did anything, all lost in their thoughts.
Draco was nervous, he hoped he hadn't gone that far. He was about to retract when he saw Harry smile sweetly and nod before he spoke.
But Severus knew him well and knew he had to play dirty if he wanted to know what the hell had happened in there and more when he saw that his godson had taken something out of his pocket, probably a portkey like last time. So he just followed him in his haste to get out of the wards and took his arm at the same time they disappeared towards Malfoy Manor.
"What the hell...– Sirius gave the boy in front of him a serious look– when I catch you I'll kill you degenerate brat, I warned you not to put your filthy hands back on my little Prongs' body–but he was interrupted by Harry's soft words.
"Padfoot!" he felt his cheeks burning, "Draco is no pervert. He's my friend and although we've been alone and slept together is not what you are thinking, right Draco? – Harry looked at him and was surprised by the icy look he was giving his godfather.
When he arrived, the twins were already there, sitting on a blanket they placed on the grass, they looked up when they heard his footsteps.
–After all? – asked Malfoy squinting– Come on, Potter, after you can make me give an unbreakable oath o you give me
"The bank is in front of Master Harry," said the elf, pointing to the end of the alley.
Slowly, he placed the fingertips on his neck by sliding them from his ear following the line of his jaw. Inadvertently he had come closer to him until he touched one side of his neck with the tip of his nose, he smelled so delicious that he couldn’t stand the urge to try it. He pulled out the tip of his tongue and slide it by drawing circles on exposed skin feeling a shudder through his spine. He was so lost tasting the taste of the blonde's skin that he didn't realize draco had turned his head even more exposing his neck until he heard a groan coming out of the blonde's throat. He quickly broke away from his neck feeling the heat rise through his face and he noticed with relief that Draco was still asleep, so as he could, he got out of the blonde’s arms and headed straight towards the bathroom. He needed a cold shower at once.
After showering, Harry fell asleep peacefully on the chest of the blonde who had become his favorite pillow.
He said, looking at him with certainty but without daring to hold his gaze for too long so as to not risk him using Legilimency. “I know that I shouldn't risk being caught; for that, the plan I have is simple but effective. With him I could approach Draco Malfoy, his father is Voldemort's right-hand man, and it would be so easy to manipulate him.” he winced through the words, but the Headmaster could very well interpret it as displeasure. “After all, he has always wanted to be my friend, and having the Prince of Slytherin as a friend, the Slytherin house will take me seriously and obey me and I could find out more.” – he finished, shrugging his shoulders as it was something really simple.
Draco groaned when he heard Harry declare himself his own. He went down to his mouth and kissed him, sticking his tongue in, and exploring the delicious mouth of the brunette as his hands glided down his sides.
When he opened his eyes again, he was standing in the center of the living room or so he believed, his eyes were blurred by all the tears he was shedding. He could see Kreacher wringing his hands, but he was only able to deny in silence and utter a soft "I want to be alone" and without saying another word, he dropped to the floor behind the couch, hugging his legs and burying his head between his knees. He didn't want to accept reality. Just two days ago he had left the mansion, fervently believing that his friends would be with him, and now he doesn't even know if they had ever truly been his friends.
Meanwhile, Severus felt the world come at him. Hadn't the useless of his godson heard a word of what he warned him about?
Harry moved the wand to reposition the spell, he didn't want to know anymore he'd heard enough. He stood there without moving until he felt a hand gently perch on his right shoulder, sighing, he turned and faced those who appeared to be his only allies.
He squeezed his wand in anger. If only he had listened to James before all of that. He could have obtained power and prestige over time, but James, Jame's love was something he had at that time and he set it aside to follow his ambitions. He sighed with melancholy. That was the day someone erased their memories, the day he had lost him. But know he knew he was alive, roaming someplace; he would find him and they wouldn't be separated again.
But Malfoy thought the opposite. Harry's trousers highlighted his slender body and his T-shirt left nothing to the imagination, highlighted his arm muscles and perfectly finely detailed his abdominal muscles, but what was wreaking havoc on his sanity were those whimsical drops of water that slipped through his hair following a line along his neck, getting lost in his chest.
– Guys I...
–Voldemort – he finished for her.
"Harry dear," Mrs. Wesley said, looking suspiciously at the brown-haired man, "are you all right? I thought you weren't coming, and I was worried.
He felt so lost that he wasn't sure how he should proceed. He needed to tell Nagini and he needed her help and her advice. He turned around decisively but it was useless because Nagini was behind him staring at him.
The class was not so complicated thanks to Draco's help and as soon as it finished, they went to the library to do the homework and that way have the afternoon free.
–I think Harry that Draco is right. In addition, Sirius and I want to know first of all, what is your decision about your... other parent. You know we'll support you and no matter your decision is, we'll be there for you.
"Have
– Harry, my dear boy, what is it? – he asked by looking at him from top to bottom.
“With that, you will make sure that our little Ronnie explodes with jealousy, but do not worry we will be your shadow, we will make sure that nothing happens to you.”
"That sounds very good Dobby–. Harry watched him a few seconds before asking him – Dobby, I called you because... I wanted to know if you... could you help me?
“I-I …- Harry stuttered.
"More!" Harry repeated outraged – that's very dangerous and...
"Shhh," Draco said, putting a finger on his lips – “We both know that you are the best seeker, and it doesn't bother me at all to leave you the position in exchange for the cup," he said, smiling cheekily.
"Well Harry, if I didn't know we were talking about Voldemort, I'd think he's just a worried father, but I think this is a hysterical father – he walked to the boys and reached out to them and then smiled halfway through – apparently you just got your father's first scolding.
– Are you all right? You were sleeping well and all of a sudden you... I thought it was a nightmare, but then you started...
Draco tells Harry the truth. Harry goes to his meeting.
As you all probably know this story is an authorized translation. My good friend @VampirePrincess27 is the author and the original publication in Spanish is already in chapter 61! XD So, if anybody understands Spanish and wants to read further on then you are welcomed to go to her profile. The story is still ongoing so, my little darlings you will have me for a couple of more months. He he he
–But-but it wasn't my fault either, it was attacking the students! Also, why are you worried about the diary, it was just an old book that manipulated people with your..., - he pronounces slowly, "By Merlin! Don't tell me it was... that was... a Horcrux! – he ended up horrified.
"That's your decision, I just wanted to make you see a reality that could be. Now go say goodbye to Harry, I’m sure he is waiting for you and that is why he hasn’t come down.  – he saw the indecision on boy and added – Don’t worry about Sirius, I’ll go keep him occupied long enough. Now go!
But Draco like the first four times had not deigned to respond. He was just walking back and forth lost in his thoughts. Harry had already taken too long, and he was worried about what that mudblood and that weasel could do to him.
"I don't think I can muster enough neurons to think about this right now, I just know I like to do it," he said.
“Of course not little Prongs! You look great, worthy of a Potter and a Riddle, of course," he said, approaching him. “Let’s go have breakfast or we will be late” He pulled him with and made him sit next to him and in front of Draco, who did not take his eyes off him.
Harry stared at the scene hoping to see something but could only realize his father's effort to avoid fighting his mother's invasion and expression of concentration.
Harry blinked slowly, directing his gaze to a pair of gray eyes, stopping the flow of his magic as he recognized them.
"Don’t try to lie to my face Potter, why don’t you take a look at yours” he spat, conjuring a mirror and send it floating towards Harry violently, but stopping softly when it reached him.
Severus got up and went out without a word.
– You must calm down! –  Severus said, feeling out of place and surprised by what he had just heard, really surprised.
"Master Potter," he said contemptuously, giving an exaggerated bow while he began his repertoire of insults to the half-breeds, blood traitors, mudbloods, and more. Harry sighed and let him rant at ease. He knew that if he wanted him on his side, he had to use all his pieces carefully.
Many miles away the situation was different.
That said, he left the room and disappeared towards Black Mansion.
I can't wait to translate the next chapter for you guys. See you next Sunday.  Stay safe people.
Blaise and Theo were in shock, their mouths open and their eyes like plates. They couldn't believe what their eyes saw, Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter kissing passionately in front of them. When, for Merlin, had that happened?
Harry and Draco gave a startled jump. Harry fell ass first on the floor, with his glasses turned sideways, when Draco got up from the sofa looking around disoriented with his wand at the ready. But Harry fell giving his back to the fireplace, so he didn’t know what had woke them up.
Without showing a shred of emotion he nodded.
"You're lucky, but I didn't come for that," he said, holding his hand, "Our letters from Hogwarts have arrived and they are waiting for us to agree who's going to buy the supplies," he led the boy inside the manor.
"Imagine if I had accepted Malfoy's friendship, although that might have made me stronger – he wanted to cause them the same pain they were causing him, but he didn't realize it had been very obvious until he found the look of disbelief and a little horror from the twins. He blinked rapidly and added in an attempt to fix his little slip of the tongue – But, of course, that …
SPOILER ALERT(not really): Could contain grammatical and/or minor tense errors. Grammar nazis assemble. XD I'll get to them eventually.
A heartbreaking cry resonated throughout the house as the other Death Eaters swallowed saliva begging Merlin not to be the Lord's next anti-stress ball.
"That woman is horrible Prongslet," Sirius said, looking at her body.
"Draco!" he rose from the couch but the pain in his scar was unbearable, he felt as if his head was bursting.
his brain was screaming, but he could do nothing but get lost in those silver pits until he felt a slight rub of lips near the corner of his mouth. He let out a little gasp. He saw him come in and smile, he was about to ask what the hell all that had been, when he spoke.
“All right, Harry, I'll leave you. You're in good hands," he said, looking at the twins in a warning sign.
Draco smiled slightly before nodding.
"Thank you for everything you're doing for me," he said with tears in his eyes, "but how will you return to school after what happened with Umbridge? And after you leave school what are you guys going to do? - he said with uncertainty.
– I... I didn't...– Draco didn't know what to say, he hadn't thought about it that far, but now he understood that he could lose him either way; if Harry turned him down or if he went with someone else.
"Draco please calm down," Blaise said, beginning to get scared.
He growled with frustration, but still stopped himself from throwing an
AUTHOR: VampirePrincess27
– Draco!  You fool! You had me so worried”. he was so relieved to see the blonde safe and sound that he didn't think about what he did. He went to him and hug him tightly, wishing he could keep him safe all the time.
– What happened? Is Harry all right? –  Sirius asked distressed looking both ways, but when he laid eyes on both boys, he rolled them. – Can I Know… why the hell do you both like to sleep in “that” position whenever you are together? – he asked annoyed.
Severus stood in front of the boy putting both hands on his shoulders and staring at him.
Tom disconnected from Potter's chitchat when the words "killed," "basilisk," "destroy" and "diary" came into his ears.
Tany XD
Harry showed up in a dark alley, he could hear people's murmurs, so he assumed they were near Gringotts.
– he screamed.
– Enough guys! That's something I would do for you all the time and if I had to, do it again, you have nothing to thank me for, you would do it for me too," he said seriously.
– Enough! "Draco had never been embarrassed as he was now. – that's my business; besides Harry is my friend and we have just established good friendship; I won’t lose him because of this – he said with determination.
After finishing his chocolate, he lay down again waiting for Draco's arrival. Now that Draco had gone, he noticed that the house felt empty, he was lonely and did not want to be alone. He was so tired he didn't feel when he fell asleep.
But despite the ambition of his uncles of learning of his fortune, it was enough that they saw a couple of galleons in their hand to retract their idea of charging the time they had to keep him. Although that didn't stop them from giving anything to him again arguing that he had enough money to never ask them for anything; this, however, was no problem for him.But the worst argument he had with his uncle and aunt was the one that now had him at crossroads,  (considering between leaving Privet Drive or being locked up for two more weeks) happened the day before afternoon, when an unknown owl had arrived by the chimney of the house interrupting the visit of one of the neighbors to his aunt Petunia carrying a letter for Harry, which was not strange, the strange thing was the sender of the letter.
Tom tried to debate Nagini's argument but all he was able to do was blow like fish out of the water.
He was so engrossed in his thoughts that he did not realize the adults had come out of the pensieve a long time ago and watched him in disbelief.
Translator’s Notes
Remus watched him leave and took a deep breath to soothe his nascent erection. When he was dressed, they sat together on the bed, each with his letter.
Harry was confused, he couldn't think of a valid enough reason to hate his father.
– Of course! His place is by my side, James as my husband and you as my heir," he said, trying to disguise how proud he was.
Voldemort was giving sparks through his eyes, if it weren't for the fact that he now knew that Potter was his son he would have crucio the boy till unconsciousness. Although his wand burned with the desire to launch it.
So, Voldemort finally knows that Harry is his son! And their encounter is approaching. Will it go as planned? Although Harry being Harry, I doubt it. And Nagini is certainly my spirit animal. LMAO
– Enough Draco– snarled Severus.

Sirius looked him in the eye and when he saw his reaction, – What's the matter, Moony? Are you all right?” he asked him.
Harry lowered his gaze with real sadness, not because of the Weasleys and Granger, but for all the other people he considered friends. He raised his gaze and sighed.
Harry lowered his gaze ashamed to feel like this.
"Come in Severus –he observed the man move forward and closed the door – well, I need you to go with the old coot and find out what those ancient hands are scheming. There is something that doesn’t add up and I need to know that he hasn’t placed his wand in anything. * (2)
–Now I know why you got like that yesterday Potter.
– "Uncle Vernon, tomorrow I have to go to... one place" – upon the annoying look of his uncle he quickly added – "I have to start fixing my house to move out as soon as possible" – it worked. His gaze changed to one of joy.
– Not that I agree with their behavior, but you must understand them Harry. They're worried about you, they're afraid you're wrong to think that when he knows the truth about you, he'll look for you and form a family. They don't want him to hurt you any more than he's already done to you, and I agree with that, but I'll support you in whatever you decide and I'll keep you protected forever – he ended up giving him a little kiss on the forehead.
He approached slowly, quietly, and when he was behind Malfoy, he hugged him from behind and hid his face among his back.
can help us locate him. isn't that right Draco?" he smiled with amusement when he saw the boy's extreme paleness.
He continued to suck, bite, and kiss his entire neck, enjoying the groans of the brunette.
– All right, then take a shower, and let's go down to breakfast so you're ready before noon.
Harry watched him undecided. He wanted to tell him the truth, even though he was afraid of his rejection afterward, but he also didn't know how long he could keep the secret without losing his mind. He needed to trust someone and if things went wrong, he could always erase his memory and pretend they never met and have always hated each other. Though he knew that would hurt him greatly.
"Mr. Malfoy!" The professor exclaimed surprised.
"Well, I... –he didn’t want to talk about what happened, but he knew he had to. So, he let out a sigh, and rising from Draco's chest looked at both men and whispered. –“Things didn't go well and I... I couldn’t stand it, I had to get out of there. So, the twins helped me out without being seen and...
Those present came out of their shock and brandished their wands. Draco seeing Harry's intention to get closer positioned in front of him, threatening the man in front of him and being followed by the two elders. Forming a protective barrier.
"I'm too tired," he said without looking at the redhead as he changed, "I think I'll fall asleep as soon as I fall into bed.
– Of course Harry Potter sir. Dobby will do whatever you ask."
" he screamed, “I thought I had friends, but now I see I was too naive," he ended up looking at them sadly, but he immediately was indifferent. “Well, goodbye Weasley, Granger “he nodded in their direction. “It was a pleasure to meet you … or maybe not," he said in a cold voice.
He didn't know if it was real or it had been a dream, but he wouldn't stop to analyze its odds. He quickly got up from bed, took his glasses, and ran down the stairs to the living room.  He drifted in front of the couch when he saw a blonde head sleeping peacefully and looked around for something that would indicate that he hadn't dreamed of everything he remembered, but his disappointment was great seeing as there were no suitcases or anything to indicate the presence of somebody else apart from Draco. He was about to give up when he heard a voice at the top of the stairs.
“Stupid Potter you won't get away with it, as soon as I put my hands on you …”
"You knew from the beginning how this would end, and now you will have the opportunity to meet new people and forge new friendships and relationships," he said, looking at him.
– Are you crazy? I will never allow you to...
– The only ones? –  Sirius asked in a tone identical to Draco's – What about Molly? Ron? –  he said upset.
– I just arranged an appointment with him five minutes before twelve o'clock at the mansion. That way it won't give him time to ask me where I've been, because if he sent me a letter, it's because he already looked for me at the manor.
–You shouldn't do it Draco, just look at his behavior and if it can't be done then tell him you can come in and... – but Sirius interrupted him.
Everyone looked at him with wrap attention, he felt a little uncomfortable, but quickly set it aside. He took air and move on to tell them about his entire plan, then waited for their thoughts on the matter.
"I think it would help Potter, maybe it would be wise for the boy to spend some time with him and get him away from the influence the Slytherins may have on him.”
"All right, I don't have a choice," he said with resignation.
"I suppose so, they always made me bored," he smiled, "although I'd like you to teach me to read the book upside down like you because I didn't learn that at school," he said with a smirk and saw with satisfaction as his cousin blushed bright red.
The blonde did not respond, he was too surprised that Harry had called him several times by name. He gently placed him on the bed taking off his glasses and when he turned to sit on a chair he felt a tug bringing him back. He turned around and found Potter’s green eyes fill with tears again.
"We have to wait, there are things to fix," he said in a firm voice as he took a seat on the couch.
– I know he’ll forgive you; Harry is a very smart and very noble boy. He’ll understand and this time we’ll be together all five, but if you prefer, then I’ll talk to him first and then we'll all meet. We must also know what decision he will make regarding his other father.
When he finally finished his torture, Harry avoided his father's gaze; He didn't want to see his disappointment at him being so weak.
"Don't worry it's nothing serious, it will be over soon – Harry tried to reassure him, but he knew Draco would ask for explanations.
But he hadn't turned around when he was detained by an excited Sirius.
"Call him a traitor again and they will be picking your pieces from the walls you skint (1)," Draco said, in a low, dangerous voice, almost a whisper.
– I'm fine... And about what I’m doing I'm just going to tell you I have to send a couple of letters, and then you and I will sit down and talk.
listen to me
"All right, Potter, wait here," she said sternly and walked into the dining room closing the door.
Harry woke up when he felt something damp go down his neck.
"You seem to be very asleep–he saw his cheeks blushing deliciously – I guess you were very tired, so I suggest we go quickly for your things and go back to sleep, what do you say?– he threw a Malfoy-brand smile that melted anyone.
His body had changed. He looked slimmer, more muscular yes but slimmer. His skin ceased to be grey and dry to be white and soft, his nose had ceased to be two holes and now it was straight. His blood-red eyes had disappeared and now they were green, his ears ceased to be pointed and now they were smaller; but mostly he recovered his beautiful hair, which now looked a few shades lighter and wavier.
"That won't be necessary," Harry said with determination, "when you decide you can come with me, for space and the money don't worry.
Draco fell to the ground writhing in pain but for his relief didn't last long.
"But I don't need them," he said hastily.
He passed his feet on the top of the bench and took a seat. He ignored everyone’s attention on him and looked at Zabini nodding in his direction to then look at the blonde and nod with the same courtesy knowing that all his movements were being analyzed by the whole school, surely expecting a fight or at least an explosion of rage on the Prince of Slytherin’s part. The blonde gave him a look of complete indifference that, while knowing it was for appearance's sake, still made him uncomfortable.
“What the hell's wrong with that one? – grumbles Ron looking at the carriage with anger.
"Kreacher!
Harry felt with deep sadness the falsehood in which she had been his best friend and under lower his gaze.
“Draco didn't do anything silly I'm sure Potter isn't looking for trouble. Please put the wand down and let's talk," he said, approaching the blonde.
Sensing no danger, he decided to transfigure the chair into a comfortable armchair, and settling down with his book on his lap, ready to spend a few good hours reading.
– It seems that you inherited James's inappropriate sense of humor.
When he arrived, he violently opened the door with a wand movement and they entered a gloomy corridor, following the murmurs coming from further into the house.
Seeing the surprised glances of the adults he felt too weak by what he had said he got up and quickly left for his room while the adults followed him with their gaze.
He smirked lightly seeing his partner in shock, gave him a soft kiss, and went out to the kitchen.
Frustrated that he had agreed to the voice of his conscience, he sat on a brown sofa. He would try his luck with the letter, maybe his parents would tell him how to open it. He was comfortable, just what he needed to read the letter his parents had left him. He looked at the envelope once more and let out the air he was holding, opened the ochre envelope with trembling fingers, unfolding the scroll.
"Yes, or at this rate, I will fall asleep in your legs," he said, rising and rubbing his eyes.
and alone," Ron said mockingly, "Where is that coward friend of yours?
"I need to read this book, but it's protected with black magic– he turned and looked him straight in the eyes – as you know I don't know how to undo the enchantments that protect it. But I'm sure you could.
The elf appeared with a small plop.
"Of course, Harry". He sighed, knowing that from now on he knew there would be nothing he would deny the brunette.
They looked at him for a few seconds in shock. The first to get up was Remus, who smiled kindly at him and held out his hand, a hand that Draco quickly narrowed as he got up.
Tom got up and took a deep breath of air before talking again, this time with more peace of mind, but not least worried and now, besides, furious.
Harry looked the twins in the eye and when they smiled at him cheering him up, he rose firmly. He walked with his head upright ignoring all the looks and murmurs around him.
Remus Lupin was watching the Eiffel Tower through the window, it was dark, and the tower's glowing lights stood out against the purple sky. Paris was a place that had always seemed beautiful to him, but despite the beautiful view he had he could not help but think of the letter that had come to him the day before.
"All right, I won't touch a single oxygenated hair now, but then hold me back because I can no longer bear to see this scene anymore," he said with his teeth clenched.
When he was done, he called his hawk and tied the letter.
"We are all ears," both Slytherin said.
Tom got comfortable in the chair and set out to listen to his son. He could feel his anger grow on the same level as Harry's pain, but every time he saw him trying to withstand his tears, he just wanted to go to that hovel and slowly and painfully torture that mudblood and the redhead.
– What's going on Ginny? Do you need anything? – he asked without knowing how to smooth the matter.
– All right, my dear friends, where were we? Ah yes...
Translator's Note
"You don't have to Harry," Dean and Seamus said, "We believe you; you would never do anything to hurt us, and we'd understand if you started thinking more about yourself," Seamus said, "you've always worried about us, and now you deserve to be happy," he ended with a smile.
Tom watched him at length, weighing his options. He got up and rounded his desk, stood in front of his son.
– Let’s go, sleepyhead, rest while they come out. I'll wake you up when they're outside – that said, he pulled the body of the brunette over his lap without getting any resistance and placed him between his legs.
"As helpful as ever, Severus," he said mockingly," let's go now, I have a family of poor little weasels to torture.
Harry watched the box with great interest for a moment and then turned his attention to the letter he held in his hand. Heart hammering in his ears, he slowly turned the letter, a strangled gasp came out of his throat as his heart beated in an unbridled fashion.
"I suppose that if he has forgiven me, who not only took away his family, but also destroyed his infancy, don’t have the right to demand to know your reasons, but – he got up a nailed his gaze unto the gray ones of the young man kneeled before him, who had a cautious hopeful glint. – that does not mean that from now on I won’t watch out for his happiness and safety, so – he walked around the blond before stopping in front of him. – Yes, I will allow you to court my son – the gray eyes brightened immensely – But you must know that if you aren’t HIS happiness, you will step aside and allow him to be happy  with someone else. – those gray eyes darkened for a couple of seconds before a determination that he hadn’t seen in a while and that and that made him remember with sadness his dear James.
"That would not be known for sure by my lord, I think it would be best to ask him first.
"Wow Harry, you're full of surprises, but before you leave we wanted to give you this – they spread a fake galleon – we put the same enchantment that the ones we use in the ED have, but this will only be for the three of us, so don't worry about our messages reaching someone else.
"I don't know...– he was so confused and hurt that he felt his heart torn to pieces – I just want to go back to Draco, I want him to hug me as usual and tell me that everything will be fine – he ignored their looks of amazement and beg them with a look to let him go.
Harry would have been surprised if it weren't for what came out of Malfoy's mouth was no more than a whisper. He watched him raise his hand and direct his trembling fingers toward the letter. This was a good time to know if he could trust him, with
Draco was surprised by what he had just heard, was it his imagination or had the other boy declared? But, when he was going to ask him what he meant with what he said, he realized that the brunette was asleep. He caressed his cheek gently and drew him further to him, as he was not sleepy, he would enjoy the warmth and softness of his body before he left.
– Sure, but first let me see how things are. I won't risk taking you to him without knowing if he hasn't changed his mind," he said, swallowing saliva at the prospect of coming back head-on with that being.
"Wow I didn't know you'd missed me so much – he was surprised by the brunette's reaction but didn't hesitate to answer the hug – if I'm going to get this reception I think I'm going to have to go out more often," he said jokingly.
– I understand you; the day has been heavy. Good night Harry," the redhead said with a murmur.
"It seems that Granger was very effusive when she said goodbye to Potter," Theo mocking said, "I always thought Granger was in love with Weasley, but I seem to be wrong," he said without knowing he was making a mistake.
– I don't know, but I must go, I don't have a choice. Maybe he knows where my mother is and... He looked at Harry in surprise—or maybe he already knows the truth about you and wants us to capture you!
"Padfoot?" he asks separating from Draco.
“Everything okay? –  asked Harry looking at Draco.
"Purity," said a smiling brunette "Good night.
Heya Guys, This was yesterday's update. I was kind of lazy and did not post. But here it is! Enjoy! XD
– ¡Dobby!
He had decided, he would read the damm letter for the last time and immediately bring Snape to his presence.
"I assume that you already know the reason for your visit, don't you, Mr. Malfoy? – he spoke slowly.
Me: *wags eyebrows and smirks*
"Yes, you better than anyone know – she raised her gaze and looked at him – and well… I was wondering if you will leave someone to follow your lineage- seeing the surprised expression on Harry’s face she hastened to explain – I’m not saying you are going to die or that I want you to die, is just that … you never know what can happen and well.. you know I have always been in love with you and … you know, I wouldn’t mind if …
Harry didn't know how much time he had spent looking at the memories, but he didn't get startled when the elf showed up with the pensieve. He was not aware of anything around him, he didn't even remember that Malfoy was still in the Mansion because he only had eyes for the pensieve. He asked Kreacher to deposit it on the table next to the box and gave him precise orders that no one was to bother him. That said, he dismissed the elf immediately.
Harry looked at them for a few seconds, he felt uncomfortable under their eyes. Like he was at a ministry hearing again.
“Oh perfect! Then don't waste any more time and head to the dining room, the banquet is about to end.”
But the Lord shut him up with a movement of his hand as he stuck his red eyes on the blond boy in front of him.
Draco was upset that he was surprised with his guard down, that was unforgivable for a Malfoy and all because he was thinking about the Gryffindor's delicious body, but he was going to get payback when he returned, well, if after meeting the dark lord he came back alive. But he couldn’t let Severus know with whom he had been these days, so, he hid his emotions like a proud Malfoy before replying to his godfather.
When he walked into the library, he found Potter in front of one of the bottom shelves watching a book, and what a book!
"You're right, Harry, I don’t think we ever saw it that way. – she turned towards Ron- Right Ron?
– No. Of course not, but that doesn't excuse your lack of tact, Severus," he responded annoyed by staring at him.
"You don't know what this means to me," he said with a lump in his throat, "I thought I was alone, that none of you would support me.
Harry felt his heart sink and new tears were gathering in his eyes.
He left the letter on the table and set out to take a bath, but just as he was about to go into a shower, Nagini slipped in lazily.
– I know you're right, but Remus at least let me try. I know what my duty is, but I still won't give up without fighting first," he said with conviction.
Harry stared at the place where Kreacher disappeared debating what to do now. He decided to eat something light and then call Dobby. He lifted a board off the floor and took a couple of sandwiches and orange juice. He missed pumpkin juice, but he could have always had a little tomorrow. While eating, he tried to see the pros and cons of staying in the mansion without telling anyone; but after half an hour he decided that depending on the content of the information given to him in the bank tomorrow he would decide whether to stay or not; because at the end of the day the information should be important if he was asked to keep quiet.
Harry smiled, content with the approval of his godfather. After all, he needed that little shred of humor to face what was coming.
Draco frowned in disagreement and shook his head. He saw the expression of confusion on Harry's face and added quickly.
"My-my diary—he stuttered and he immediately turned to his son—Do you have any idea what you did?! – he screamed – That basilisk was one of the few inheritances of The Great Salazar Slytherin,
"He doesn’t know Moony," he handed out the letter with sadness, "but we must return as soon as possible. I knew it would hurt him for me to die in front of his eyes, but my little Harry is devastated, he blames himself for my death, and I don't want him to suffer anymore because of me.
(See the end of the chapter for
– Are you talking about Mr. Nott or Mr. Zabini perhaps? – Snape didn't take his eyes off him; he knew his godson was using
"Potter, calm down or you’ll blow up the castle," Severus said, stopping.
An hour later Harry came down to the dining room and met Malfoy for breakfast. He knew sooner or later he would have to deal with the situation, but he preferred later rather than sooner. However, he had no escape, the blonde watched him from the table. He cleared his throat to divert attention from his face because he was beginning to feel the heat rising down his cheeks.
"Of course," he said, smiling, "just tell me the password.
– No Harry!
Voldemort turned around ready to cruciate that toad color snake but found a closed door.
Tom narrowed his eyes watching the boy for a few seconds. He should have calmed down a little bit, after all, he didn't want to hurt him, he was just hugging him.
– He regretted his last sentence when he saw a grimace of pain across Malfoy's face but in the next second it was gone; instead, there was an unemotional mask.
Harry talked the rest of the way to the castle with Luna, or rather, heard the girl tell him about her travels and the fantastic creatures she met.
Severus was mouthing like a fish out of the water when he learned the content of the pensieve. He did not know what bizarre world he was in to make James Potter the lover of the Dark Lord and not only that, but Harry Potter himself, the Boy-Who-Lived himself turned out to be his son. This wouldn’t bring anything good, except problems and headaches that were already beginning.
– If you just trusted me a little more, I could help you with the heavy burden on your shoulders. You don't have to do it all your own Harry.
– Mmmm he may be with some conquest. All right, Severus, I'll give you an extension, you have until tomorrow at noon to find him and bring him to my presence. Don't let me down again, Severus. You may retire.
father in a good way.
Voldemort was sitting in his favorite armchair in shock, his breathing agitated and his eyes completely open.
he hissed turning around slightly embarrassed.
– y-yes thank you – Harry came over to take a seat at the table for breakfast.
– I... I don't know... I don't... - Harry was baffled; he didn't know what to do.

Hi guys! First I must apologize for there being no update last week. Life you know? but anyways! here is the next chapter. Enjoy!
The sensations during his tale manifested as expected, from pain, sadness, and disappointment to amazement. But the emotion that stood amongst the others was Ire, the rage to those who had dared to hurt Harry, those whom he had considered friends.
He took Harry's trunk and they disappeared on their way to the mansion.
SPOILER ALERT(not really): Could contain grammatical and/or minor tense errors. Feel free to point them out. LOL
"I guess he thought about it," he said, smiling, but then he got serious “I... I have the consent of the Lord and your father's friends, but if you don't...”  he didn’t finish the sentence, suddenly insecure.

– Well, if that's the case then do it. Bring him here, after all, he remembered my father, maybe he will give me the opportunity to tell him the whole truth and if not then …
"I... well it's that... I didn't give it too much importance," he said, stirring awkwardly.
– All right, since we're all together, let's take the opportunity to catch up. We have a lot to tell you, Harry. But first I'd like you to explain what my pervert of a cousin is doing with you, with no one else in the house and sleeping together on the couch – he asks pulling him by the waist and lying against his chest, getting a snort in response.
Sirius saw him leave with his godson in his arms and was about to follow him when he was stopped by an enraged lycanthrope.
He felt the colors come up to his face because of shame and anger. He stepped with his arms outstretched to throw himself into the neck of that perverted blonde when he felt him being held by the arm.
"What's up Draco?" he asked with concern.
I'd made it. The director's eyes shone brightly as he heard that phrase. I quickly scribble on a piece of
They appeared in front of the window of his house hidden behind some thickets.

– Young Malfoy asked Dobby to tell Harry Potter that he was coming soon and that in the meantime Dobby would take care of Harry Potter.
Harry had already put on his green silk pajamas when the portrait opened revealing the blonde wearing a black silk pajama.
“Harry!" He said surprised, “I thought you didn't...”
-Wait Potter,- spoke a familiar, terribly well-known voice. Harry tensed at that moment, begging Merlin that this drag of words did not belong to whom he believed, or he would be dead. He turned slowly thinking it was impossible for him to be here. Serious mistake.
– Where have you been, Draco? And before you lie to me let me tell you that I have already checked the mansion and there is no sign that you have been in the house for at least two or three days, not to mention that part of your clothes and personal belongings are missing –  he looked him in the eyes trying to read his mind, but he hadn’t been taught occlumency for nothing.
Harry couldn't believe what she was trying to say.
– What will you tell him when he asks you if you've been able to enter the Mansion? Keep in mind that whatever the answer will endanger you or Harry–Remus wasn't entirely convinced.
Harry was stunned. Was he listening to his parents say they would separate their soul? He didn't quite understand what that meant, but if it was black magic it was a very dangerous thing, but he couldn't help but feel something warm on his chest knowing they'd done it for him.
. That was undoubtedly an image he would treasure for the rest of his life. But now he had other things to do and the sooner the better.
The whole Great Dining Room was plunged into absolute silence and Harry felt all the looks nailed to him.
"You called Young Malfoy– he bowed.
before Sirius came in and had a heart attack.
Harry frowned but made himself looked uninterested. He heard them close the door and got close without making any noise. He didn’t hear anything but he could see shadows under the door so he deduced it was a
The week had flown between classes, assignments, and friends. He had received letters from his father, Remus, and his godfather congratulating him on his new house. His father had told him that he already had progressed in his research into his father and Lily's Horcruxes but would explain when they saw each other.
He glowered at the gargoyle before spitting the absurd password. He knocked and waited for permission to enter, seconds he took advantage of to compose his mask.
Now he’ll have to find another puppet because Potter comes with me whether he wants to or not," he said in a firm voice.
Voldemort winced in disgust before answering.
2) Old Dotard - an old person who has become physically weak and whose mental faculties have declined.
"You'll know that later, for now, I need to know if you can get into Black Mansion– he sat down again and stared at the boy in front of him, - I'm just going to tell you that I need Potter guarded and protected anywhere, anytime, from whatever and especially from whoever deems him harm.
– What the hell? - Sirius said with annoyance.
When they walked through the door, he still didn't erase his smile of satisfaction. He looked at Harry sand winked at him while smiling.
"Good night Ron," he said with regret, trying to hold back tears as he thought he had been betrayed by those he believed were his best friends.
"You're getting very lazy," Draco said, voice laced with amusement at Harry's sounds.
"I don't think it's that big of a deal," but he stopped when he felt Draco's fingers caress his cheek.
“Of course not! "He said outraged without realizing the hurt look of the blond. “Don’t even think about it, I told you before,
"You look a lot like James," he said, surprising the boy, "but you're smaller and weaker than him," he said with a mocking grimace.
– I believe... that you have your answer there Paddy.” Remus replied quietly, stunned to see Harry like that with whom he thought he was his worst enemy apart from Voldemort.
