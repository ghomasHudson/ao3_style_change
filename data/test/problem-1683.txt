So here I am, in my godfathers dingy dungeon office, immobilized in an extremely cold iron chair. The jar of fairy wings was the only thing I managed to focus on out of all the creepy ingredients in the room. They're each about the size of my thumb, and an iridescent blue/pink that glows slightly in the firelight.
"Shall we take this somewhere else," Potter whispers, apparently studying his foot.
"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks," Potter snaps. The fire makes my cheeks go pink and I spit a very Slytherin sounding retort back at him. Potter and the Weasley stand up and Weasley is pissed.
Of all people, why must it always be Potter?
The exams and the studying that led up to them mostly occupied my mind, but I was terrified out of my wits at what I had nearly done. I could have killed him if I wanted to. I can hardly remember anything from the last few weeks of school.
"Makes sense. So, are we going to do this, or what?" Harry looks shocked and splutters out almost-words at this.
Draco considers this, gazing at Potter through wide eyes. He realizes his hand is still in Dracos hair and relinquishes his grip immediately.
"Draco?" Harry whispers tentatively.
"Potter..."
I thought this might have gotten better as I became an adult, but no; as is with my life and luck, that would never work.
"Hmm. I still don't trust him," he mutters while finally putting down my new cat.
"Well isn't that fucking fantastic," I grumble, handing the parchment over to Blaise and Pansy so they can read it too. We had all been getting Crucio'd by Snape almost daily, and have taken to hiding in the kitchens and having light conversation with the many elves there. Some were teaching Blaise to sew, some were teaching Pansy healing charms, some were teaching me to cook. They're quite scintillating company once you get to know them. My favorite thing to make was treacle tart, and every time I spotted Pretty Boy across the Great Hall shoving it into his face I felt, yet again, that odd sense of warm excitement deep in my belly. I had to be careful when this happened, however, because I once punctured my goblet with my talons, boiling the pumpkin juice inside. That night held an extra long session with Snape.
"Have you..." He trails off, unsure what to say. "Have you ever heard of a safeword?" Harry shakes his head. "Ok, well, basically... If you're having sex or are in a relationship with someone, you usually want a word that you can use if your limits are pushed. Like, if Blaise, Pansy and I are talking about something that bothers Theo, he'll yell 'asparagus,' and we drop the subject. Make sense?"
comments are appreciated!! also sorry for the filler chapter, when i wrote it originally life was hectic. i wrote this to flesh out my imaginary world as an escape from the real one
"I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find - how about - up a tree?" Yep, definitely displaying.
"You don't know anything! You can't understand!"
Oh god.
"Hermione--" he wheezed. Merlin, she was stronger than she looked.
This time, Tom paid attention to him. "Voldemort is my past, present and future." He smirked and turned around, using Draco's wand to write words in the air.
The summer that followed was... horrible. There was no other way to describe it. There was clear tension between father and son, so much so that even the house-elves (who normally tried to keep out of their master’s business) noticed. Draco kept himself cooped up in the family library while Lucius was out doing who knows what, who knows where. And frankly, Draco didn't care what his father was doing. The feelings of rage and stinging betrayal were all that accompanied thoughts of his father nowadays.
I'm thinking of making a new story. How would you guys feel about a Draco meets the Avengers story. Probably dimension travelling. He would become an Avenger. Just tell me what you think about it!
I have to admit, first year is definitely my least favorite.
He saw Harry's face soften. "I'm so sorry, Draco. We've been awful this year, but we won't be anymore," he promised.
He kept his answer short, not wanting to say more than he had to. Lucius noticed what he was doing - he wasn't an idiot - and narrowed his eyes, he was angry.
"Lucius," Dumbledore nodded.
"I-I can't believe-" Hermione blew into the tissue again,
plagued his mind,
Dobby squeaked and left. Harry made to follow him but was stopped when Draco grabbed his arm. Harry faced Draco, confusion lining his face.
"Oh wait, I forgot I wanted to tell you something." Harry walked behind him, Draco turned back to look at him,
He made his way down a flight of stairs to find the Weasley's at a table eating breakfast, Harry was right behind him as he sat down next to Ron and Harry sat down next to him.
"I need... Veela suppressant potions," he mumbled just loud enough. Whatever Severus had been expecting, it obviously hadn't been that, given how he very uncharacteristically fumbled with the Aconite. Once he had gotten his grip on the vial, he gave Draco a wide-eyed stare before his eyes narrowed, looking at Draco's face. Checking to see if Draco was lying.
Either that or he was drunk, and that was rather ridiculous considering the fact that he was twelve years old, but Potter always was a notorious lightweight, Draco had mocked him for it multiple times.
"I was worried." He whispered, and Draco didn't know what to say, he was touched.
"NO!" Tom yelled as his basilisk fell to the floor, dead.
He said a quick 'Thank you, Profesor' and practically ran out of the classroom.
Harry looked at him in confusion but Draco just shook his head, asking Harry to trust him and was surprised at how willingly he complied. Draco pushed through the crowd of people who were now buying their own books and made his way over to the Weasleys and the Grangers.
"The what?" Harry and Ron spoke in unison.
Draco wobbled to a stand and walked over to her.
"The troll-" Speak of the devil, he stopped right in front of the girl's bathroom and saw that the troll had already gone in, he could Hermione yelling inside.
"I knew you had it in you! Was this your plan all along, get close to the mudblood and then break her filthy little heart, good job!" Nott came up to him and patted him on the shoulder, his sentiments were echoed by the rest of his team.
Was it possible that it wasn't a dream? There was something about a cat in his dream, that cat was most likely Mrs Norris. He narrowed his eyes, deep in thought. This hadn't happened last time, what was different this time, he thought back...
Finally, they got some help from a portrait. Sir Cummemberg or something? Overall, he was rather overdramatic.
Luna was laying down on the grass near Hagrid's hut. The weather was chilly, but not unbearably so. Draco quite enjoyed cold weather. He liked the feeling of the cool air on his face as well as the feeling of warm air hitting him when he went back into Hogwarts.
He sneered in disgust as if saying the name brought him physical pain, and Harry looked at him in confusion, he didn't understand what was happening, Draco suddenly felt...wrong.
"Ugh." Draco wrinkled his nose in disgust, sticking his tongue out.
"He can't actually do that..." Draco mumbled to himself, already thinking of a plan. Maybe this way, he could atone for one of the horrible things he had done in the past. It wouldn't be much, but it was a start.
McGonagall hesitated before answering.
"No." Draco answered slowly, it was weird, everything in him told him to scream 'yes, Potter, of course I'm mad at you!', but he knew that it was wrong to scream at
Draco looked at the doorway; students were slowly coming in. It looked like they were one of the first ones. He should have enough time to talk to whoever Luna wanted him to.
"Been a while, eh Draco?" Terry said as they all walked through the clearing.
Draco let out a sigh. He knew what would happen, but there was always that nagging feeling in the back of his mind: what if this time was different?
He had been there for her when she hadn't been able to make a single friend, he had been there for her when she was crying all alone in the library. He had been there for her! And what did she do in return? Leave him when he needed her most.
Harry shrugged. "By...fighting?" He smiled hesitantly.
"Of course we do, you're a genius, Draco!" Harry told him, looking at him as if it was obvious.
"Harry!" Mr Granger smiled.
Draco glanced around him, it was nice to be with all of his friends again. Being in Ravenclaw hadn’t made it easy to hang out with them.
"Mr. Malfoy, I'm sure you know why I called you here," Lupin started off, his usual calm demeanor was replaced with a stance that was both alert and tired at the same time.
The tears fell onto Harry's wound and they burned for a second, but only for a second. Then, the pain that was flooding his veins started to fade. It was so quick that Harry had to get his bearings. His ears were no longer ringing and he could hear someone yelling.
Draco yelled out in frustration, Dobby would continue taking his mail, how would he talk to Harry. Harry was a fragile boy, he overthought the smallest things and didn't think other things through, he was frustrating, but Draco had to protect him, and that meant keeping Harry happy, or at least, as happy as was possible for him.
Draco felt a bit of pride, they were believing him, he really was a good actor.
"Yeah, I'm fine, what did you want to show me?" Draco shook his head a bit, trying to shake the thoughts out of his mind, he always was an active thinker, a bit too active if you asked him.
Of course Lucius heard, he always heard about everything, if everything went according to plan, he should get disowned soon, as long as mother didn't interfere to much.
He didn't know how that made sense, but it did.
"Harry wouldn't let us wake you up until Mum made him, he fell asleep with you there you know, carried you to the bed and everything. We tried to put you down on the bed, but anytime you were off Harry's lap, you started to throw a fuss." Fred (or maybe George) laughed.
"We're thinking about what you said, you know, with Snape." Ron whispered, but Hagrid still overheard.
"Thank you, Professor." Flitwick nodded at him.
"I'm not speaking to him." Hermione had calmed down now, looking at them in determination.
Draco felt a pang of sympathy run through him.
But he knew that it was unlikely.
The troll turned around to look at him, it looked mad and confused, he glared at it.
He wanted to be friends--
Oh, right, the private thing. He should take it, Flitwick was the best dueler of his time.
He should visit Harry in the Hospital Wing-
Hermione was all over him in an instant, snatching the potions from Ron, who had taken them back, not giving Draco any time to think about what was happening before she was shoving potions down his throat.
Anthony rubbed a hand on the back of his neck, "Yeah?" He said uncertainly.
Draco nodded.
It seemed like an eternity, but eventually, Harry came out of the foundation, catching the snitch, while Nott fell off his broom and landed on his arse.
know. He tried to figure it out but he didn't know why he said what he did, maybe he could tell Flitwick, but he would just think that he was making an excuse, but maybe he would believe him.
Luna raised her hand. "The moon frogs tell me I should go first, Sir!"
"I don't get it either, but maybe we could ask him, instead of insulting his friend."
"Sure." He mumbled.
Yes, that sounded like Crabbe and Goyle. Tell them to take a right and they turn around and go to the South Pole instead. He was a bit proud of Harry for standing up for himself. He did see the irony in it. How he had been in Nott's position more than once. But really, he just didn't want to deal with the boy right now. And from the look in Nott's eyes, he didn't want to either. He was probably just bothering them for reputation's sake. Draco had done the same thing more than once in the previous timeline.
"Get away from my friend!" Draco had to keep himself from laughing at Harry's stance, he puffed out his chest, trying to make himself look bigger given his scrawny figure.
"Sorry, we doubted you mate." One of the beaters said, but Draco wasn't listening, questions were running through his head, he didn't understand, he was confused.
He would most likely get a howler tomorrow, he should be prepared for that.
"Brats!" Tom yelled.
"I have no idea what you're talking about." Lucius raised his head.
"What is this?" Draco whispered, trying to free his hand, he and Hermione may have been calm, but Ron and Harry weren't.
"Hmm.” Harry was still looking at Draco, like he could solve all the boy's mysteries by just staring at him.
"Someones going to take the Philopheser's stone tonight!" She yelled, and McGonagall's papers fell out of her hands, she looked at them in shock.
Draco snapped his fingers, "Eyes on the clouds Weasley, and ears on me, I have some words for you!" Ron raised his face and looked at Harry, who was looking back at him in pity.
"Listen Draco," he started, in a voice that startled Draco. Terry actually sounded serious for once. "I know that you've been dealing with some pretty bad stuff lately. Last year took its toll on you, but... I can tell there's something else that's been bothering you. If you can't tell me, then I want you to tell someone else. I don't care about knowing your secrets. I just want you to feel better because you're my friend, and I care about you."
"What are we even supposed to do with the keys?"
"Besides, didn't you see the faces Nott was making? He pretended to faint and everyone at the Slytherin table found it hilarious!" Harry yelled, face getting red. Either from humiliation or anger, Draco couldn't tell.
"Sorry, Hermione! We were in the library—he disappeared." Harry looked noticeably dishevelled; he must have run all the way to the Gryffindor common room from the library.
Love you all, have a good read every one!
"Would you like to go on a date with me, Luna?"
"So you have chosen to study Divination." She gave Hermione a look, one much different from the one she had given Draco. Her eyes hardened just a tad and her smile faltered the slightest bit. The words that Trelawney had said in the last timeline suddenly came back to him, as well as how much Granger had complained during this class.
Perhaps that was the power that they knew not, something could have happened, what, Albus only had the slightest clue to.
"A book I've been eyeing should be no problem for your family." Anthony smiled.
Making his way through the common room, he noticed the dirty looks he got from some of his older classmates, he didn't care, it would take a while and a lot of action before their views of him started to change.
But with that said, Nott had been gaining a lot of favor with the board lately. It had come out of nowhere. He had done the same thing Lucius had planned, and in doing so had become much more powerful. His vote was now worth that of two people. He had Greengrass and Avery under his thumb. If he pushed for the execution of a Hippogriff it would definitely get approved. With Lucius opposing him, however...
"I can see green smoke."
(See the end of the chapter for
Everyone came running in, every teacher and every student, once they saw what the commotion was about, they were all looking at the cat in horror. In blood, it wrote,
Harry started packing up his things and Ron put a hook on the bars,
"Draco, I know about him." She glanced at Dumbledore. She had planned to tell him what was happening, but Draco had talked to them, he had asked them why they were there. Yes, it was only one sentence, but it was a whole lot better than when he was avoiding them like the plague. He had made the first move; maybe Hermione could talk some sense into him and make him come forward on his own.
"Where did you learn that spell? How did you preform it?" Hermione asked sharply.
"Draco! Harry!" A voice called out. But it sounded so far away.
Dumbledore had a habit of not asking people questions and just thinking of the answer himself, although he supposed this Dumbledore could be a bit different from the Dumbledore that he knew, Merlin he hoped he was, but at the same time he hoped he wasn't, Draco didn't handle change well, it messed him up, he had learned that about himself when he had found out that he was a Veela and that he was a Seer.
Slowly, the scene around him began to melt, changing from the Divination room to the grounds outside of Hogwarts. The Whomping Willow that they had crashed into stood before him, and he watched as the scene changed from day to night. It was like watching time shiftshift/surge/fly  around him, seeing teachers pass and go, and seeing animals blur dash/blur/run quickly from one side of his vision to another.
"Why would he keep this from me?" Severus spoke to himself.
And now, here he was in the hospital wing, Harry sitting by his side even though Dumbledore had called him to his office. Harry had explicitly said that he wasn't going to be leaving Draco any time soon, and Draco had no intention of letting him leave before he had properly berated him about all the absolutely
"What are we doing?" he whispered, asking Harry.
************
Ron turned to Harry, ignoring Hermione. "Why would Malfoy tear up Hermione's room?"
Draco recognised the author, he had passed away in his timeline in Draco's 4th year, a sad sight, but Draco hadn't known him then, perhaps he would be able to meet him now, perhaps.
He made his way toward the door and closed it as soon as he was out of the class.
"Mate, I know that you have a crush on him or something, but he was clearly leading you on!" Ron shook Harry, trying to snap him out of it, but Harry put his hands on Ron's and made him stop.
to talk to would be nice, he could tell the book anything and it wouldn't tell anyone.
*********************
Cold water was thrown on his face and Draco darted up. He felt horrible. He felt like throwing up but knew he wouldn't be able to even if he wanted to. His head was killing him, and he felt so
He dipped his quill in ink and started to write.
"So he's not like his father."
It was always a solemn mood whenever one of his parents got that call. That they had failed.
He nodded towards the Slytherins and walked back to his dorm.
A few of the teachers rushed up to help Harry. He was holding his arm; it was clearly broken. Draco wasn't worried about the broken arm; what he was worried about was that Lockhart was the one healing it.
Hermione smiled and absolutely went off about all the things that she had learned, she asked him some questions and he answered as best as he could.
But the question had gotten his attention. "What of, Professor?" He asked, genuinely confused and worried at the same time. Had something happened?
Harry smiled sheepishly, "She said speak
They entered a long tunnel with statues of snakes lining the sides of the hall. Their mouths were open and their fake tongues were out, hissing at them. The floor was decorated with a checker pattern; all in all, it was pretty fancy. A bright light shone at the end of the hall.
"I thought you sent him to get ingredients," Seamus frowned.
*************************
A friendship with Nott would be achievable, as long as he didn't outright insult him and hurt his pride, that was one of the worst things you could do to a Slytherin, it was right up there with public embarrassment, at least then he could get you back for it.
"So... what's up?" Terry asked, rubbing the back of his neck.
Draco found himself blushing, he loved compliments, even if they weren't about his intelligence. He was right, Draco could tell him anything, could he tell Tom that he was a time traveller, it would be nice to tell someone without having to worry about them thinking him crazy or telling other people.
But he called her a mudblood, it would be understandable if she didn't forgive him, the thought of Hermione never forgiving him made the tears come back, why had he said that?
Everyone turned to look at him and Patil, most of them were confused, but Professor Flitwick took one look at him and his feather and he fell off of his stack of books. Okay, so maybe he shouldn't have acted on impulse.
Draco suddenly stopped hissing, but a new hissing took its place. It was in the walls.
Malfoy didn't seem the slightest bit put off by Davies hidden insults or his accusations, he remained calm.
It was completely unpredictable.
"Interesting." Mr Granger looked like he carried the same hunger for knowledge that Draco did, he loved being able to educate people without coming across as snotty or prude.
"Where are you going?" Hermione asked, and Draco turned back to her.
********************
________________________________________________
He shrugged. "You should try it." But Draco knew how unlikely that would be, it was clear that Trelawney wasn't exactly fond of Hermione and the feeling was clearly mutual.
"The one on the third floor." The forbidden one.
Harry struggled but finally grabbed Draco's hand, and Draco pulled him up and closed the door.
He didn't know what they had to do with this, but he knew that those colors represented the founders, there was nothing else that made sense with them, it was a stretch, he knew that, but it felt right, and when something felt right, he didn't ignore it.
There was a light shining from the hallway next to them. It was a faint glow that came from McGonagall's office. They could hear silent muttering coming from the office. Harry looked at Ron, warning him to be quiet. Ron rolled his eyes but nodded.
She hesitated for a moment before nodding and putting it over her. "I'll be right behind you," she muttered, and they nodded at where they thought she was.
"Hear what?" Ron tilted his head, his eyebrows furrowed.
Draco smiled, it was all working out. Draco walked into the charms classroom and took his seat next to Patil, they were learning
"You're acting...shy." Terry and shy did not go together.
"You're too nice for your own good sometimes, Draco." He almost laughed at that, no one thought him kind, let alone
Harry's cheeks pinked, he must have a thing for compliments, his cheeks always pinked when Draco complimented him, which wasn't often, but he could only assume that it was the same for other people, after all, why would it be different for Draco alone? A rather ridiculous thought.
************
He turned back, a confused look on his face.
And before Draco knew it, the mist was hurtling towards him, and then
Images of Harry on the floor, crying while his friends looked at him in disgust flooded into his mind, and Draco smiled.
"Can someone tell me what's happening?" She asked in a harsh tone, but she was really honestly scared, it had been a long time since Albus had asked her to heal a student in anywhere except the hospital wing when they were actually able to get there.
"The incident?"
Harry brandished his wand and yelled,
"New student?" Draco asked. He hadn't heard anything about new students.
face.
Draco nodded. "How did you know?" he asked.
He picked up the book that had caught his eye, it had a simple title.
the Weasley's. His father sneered and scoffed every time he saw the familiar ginger hair in the fireplace but didn't comment on it. Sometimes, Draco thought Lucius might feel guilty of what he did. Sometimes, Draco found that he didn't give a fuck. Other times, it was nice to see him actually showing remorse for something.
"Such a young child, a prophesy, what was it?" Poppy asked Albus.
"Draco's your godson, Professor?" Harry tilted his head as he lifted Draco up, he was surprisingly light.
Their bodies began to... bubble, and their features began to change and morph and warp. Harry's hair began to change, getting shorter and changing to blonde. His skin got lighter, and his eyes changed to blue. His scar was no longer visible. Harry could feel his bones rearranging, it was a horrible feeling. The Gryffindor emblem on his clothes morphed into the Ravenclaw bird.
***********
They should've gotten rid of it. Should have thrown it into the forbidden forest and let it be eaten by the creatures that lived there. Maybe that would've done it.
"Great job, Harry!" He gushed.
He did not look happy, but Draco didn't care.
"We need you to help us, we already went to Hagrid, and he let slip something about Nicolas Flamel."
"I hate it when you make sense."
___________________________________
But it wasn't any of them. Instead, it was Professor Trelawney. Damn. He should've known from how airy and eccentric the voice sounded. He always wondered why her voice was like that; it couldn't have been because she was a Seer. Draco was a Seer and he sure as hell didn't talk like that.
Now, Hermione rushed over to help Ron. Harry looked over at her, "You help Ron, Draco and I will stop Snape." He spoke gallantly, Harry was really working himself up. Hermione nodded and continued to try and help Ron, Harry tugged him along and they made their way to the door, slowly creeping in.
And then, she was gone.
So he hugged Harry back.
He rembered how little Draco had confided in his Godfather that he wanted to be in Slytherin, it must have come as a surprise to him when he started chanting 'Not Slytherin', but if it worked for Potter, it would sure as hell work for him, and it did, even though it did consider Gryffindor for a moment.
"Meet me after class today." Flitwick comanded, and then he went back to teaching his class, but Draco still caught him looking at him in fascination.
"Crabbe. Midnight all right? We'll meet you in the trophy room; that's always unlocked."
Suddenly, the tallest Weasley pops out of the wall, closely followed by the twins. Then the She-Weasel and her mother, then-
The claws all fly up to me, gliding over my skin painfully. The black sigils disappeared as the talons stroked over them, instead leaving reddish purple lines across my wrists. It stung like a million wasps were mating on my arms, but stopped just as soon as it started and Mother was quick to rub a healing salve on the wounds.
"Looks like you don't need to try out," Blaise says, sidling up to me. "But I don't think there would've been much competition between you and the others, you were always the best back at the Manor."
"I don't quite like it down here," Blaise says, "makes me wanna go all gargoyle, what with all the stone." He frowns around at the slimy looking walls.
"I uh..." He pauses, unsure of how to say this. "I just wanted to say" - he averts his eyes and the words gush out before either can breathe - "I just wanted to let you know that you mean a lot to me. You turn my insides to some sort of happy mush and I can hardly believe that I've had the privilege of getting to know you." Silence. "Sorry, that was probably stupid, I-"
A gentle hand shaking my shoulder is what wakes me. Memory rushes my mind, appalling me to attention. Upon inspection, I'm on the floor of the bedroom Potter Apparated us to. It can't have been too long since I passed out.
We argue a bit more before a small rat bites Goyle's hand. It's missing a toe, probably got into a fight with a dog or something.
"I... It's nothing, don't worry," he says breathlessly in response.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes, I'm here." The voice comes out from thin air and Draco wonders for what might possibly be the ninth time that day whether he's going insane. First Potter is a vampire, then he kisses Potter, then he agrees to be a Feeder? Hearing voices would fit in perfectly with this newfound insanity.
I had been to Diagon Alley before, but never was it this busy. Mother would take me in the early morning to retrieve money from the family vault. Father would take me in the later hours of the day and we'd head to Bourgin and Burkes. Today, however, the newest students for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry were out shopping for school supplies. Father had gone to get my books, and Mother walked me to Madam Malkins, the robe shop. I, of course, told her to leave me there and wait at the wand shop. My Mother will not watch me get measured, I can't lose that dignity.
"Aren't you a Prefect?" Pansy demands. I hadn't noticed the badge before then, but there it is. A big silver P gleaming on his breast pocket.
Dobby apparates to us then, holding two bowls. One of them contains a mound of what look to be occamy claws, the other home to a fine powder, glittering purple-blue-green in the sunlight. He smiles at us, placing the wooden bowls on the little glass garden table before disapparating away. Mother removes her hands from my shoulders once more, turning to fiddle with the occamy claws, leaving me to gape at her nervously. She senses this and, of course, states that it's not polite to stare open mouthed at a woman's backside.
"Tell me what happened. And I just got out of the shower, Blaise told me in the bathroom," she says as though she and Blaise regularly bathe together or something. "Stop looking at me like that, we're worried about you." Her eyes finally shrink down to normal size and her skin loses some of its murky hue.
"Did-did she?" He whispers. I nearly kick him into oblivion right there. What an idiot. I didn't want him to see that, but now it's too late. He just stares at it, mouth opening and closing like a dumb koi.
"Yes," Professor McGonagall nodded.
They turned the car around and Draco held out his hand, "Come on Harry!"
Draco cringed at the analogy he had made, had he just referred to himself becoming a Veela much like the sexual education teachers had taught puberty to them?
"It's policy, Ron. Harry cannot go to Hogsmeade without his permission slip." Hermione flipped a page of her book.
"If the Professor hadn't been there..." Harry looked away, letting himself trail off. The thought of Harry dying made Draco's blood freeze. Harry couldn't die, he just couldn't. And Draco wouldn't let anyone take Harry from him. Not after all he had gone through just to be there!
"No, Professor! Don't look that way!" Terry tugged on her sleeve. He had been distracting McGonagall for a full hour and he had learned far too much about Transfiguration. It was already his best subject! He had an E in it!
"Come on," she said, and they followed her to Dumbledore's tower.
He had to leave. His breathing picked up. He had to get out of here. His heart started hammering in his chest.
He turned to Hermione, they had an argument concerning Draco, Harry thought that they should at least listen to him, but Hermione was dead set on ignoring him, and Ron wasn't exactly much help, Harry missed Draco, and he really just wanted this all to be done with.
Tomorrow, he would put his plan in action.
"Draco calm down, I believe you, I don't know what's happening, but we will figure this out, here." Flitwick went to his shelf and got some books from his shelf and handed them to Draco.
Draco sniffed and started writing, teardrops hitting the page as he wrote,
Something jumped out of the bushes, half man, half horse, a centaur.
*********
"Strawberry Yeti," he said before the Gargoyle even tried to ask. The staircase was revealed and Draco bolted up the steps. He didn't want to think Dumbledore had actually Obliviated Severus, but what else was there to think?
Draco sucked in a breath, he knew that the muggles were bad, but he had never heard of muggles hiding magic from a magic bearer, Draco briefly wondered how it would be without magic and shuddered at the prospect of it.
Good reading lovely's!
When she did something that was wrong or she pushed into others conversations, Draco gently told her that what she was doing was rude, he taught her how to analyze other people, and she was happy. He was kinder than other people, but she still saw the way people looked at him, like they were expecting him to say something completely out of turn.
After we get dressed, we head to the entrance hall before taking the tunnel to the kitchens. Consequently, we run into an older Hufflepuff with the same destination. We're just turning a corner, arms linked, when we walk directly into the chest of Cedric Diggory.
"Yes, exactly. I heard he's a sort of savage - lives in a hut on school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed."
He pulls off his shirt first, revealing a scarred expanse of tanned skin, stretched taught over defined, bulging muscles. Hands frantically undoing his flies, he catches my gaze. His eyes seem to glow eerily with immense heat. It scares me to no end.
"Malfoy, are you paying attention to anything I'm saying?" The Savior snaps at me, and my eyes widen in response while more blood rushes downward. I nod. "Good. Now, Adelphi used to be an Unspeakable. She studied Horcruxes, gadgets, and invented spells and potions. She's damn smart, and she uses any means possible to get her way. She has spells and potions on her side that you can't fathom..." I can't continue paying attention when he's talking like this. Despite my efforts, I'm rock hard and raring to go.
Grandma Malfoy was killed by her husband when Father was my age, as the Malfoy name had a reputation, and nobody could discover that we're partbreds. Father had killed Grandma Black in front of me, when he caught her telling me about the prowess of the Veela. Great Grandma Black was killed by Aunt Bella, but that was before I was born.
"Here," I pant out, grinning giddily. "Open the box." Blaise takes it, tilting his head questioningly. "Careful with the scissors."
"I'm sure." And with that, they enter.
"Bloody fuck," I swear quietly.
Draco looks into Potter's viridian gaze, nearly panting at the sheer heat of their kiss. The raven haired boy is looking back and forth at each of Dracos eyes in the most infuriatingly obnoxious way, making Draco go dizzy. He finally stops fixing the blond with that searching look of his, just to share a moment of heat before nodding. This isn't over yet.
"What is that, Mother?" I ask tentatively, tracing the light marks across her wrists and hands.
I'm surprised to see how unbothered - gleeful, even - he is at dinner. Did he want to go back home? Maybe I'll get some answers from from, Vince and Greg flanking me to the other side of the vast Great Hall.
"Do shut up."
"No," the boy said, looking somewhat baffled at that. I shall explain, just like Father did for me.
Dozens of owls swoop in through the windows of the Great Hall. A pair of large tawnies drop a large package in my lap and wait for me to pay them before leaving. These must be the Nifflers. I run out the hall towards the kitchens where I know Blaise and Pansy currently reside. They had gone in there immediately after class to make a dress form, and couldn't finish in time for dinner. I would have stayed with them, except I knew my package would be arriving today.
"He's the gamekeeper," he replied with a small frown. I must not sound impressive enough for him.
"Can I go now, Godfather?" I drawl out in the most bored voice I can muster. He nods in response.
"Give it here, or I'll knock you off that broom!" His eyes are full of fury, directed at me. I'm a little scared now, the Veela in me screaming that I have angered the best potential mate I have.
"I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you?" I'm getting frantic now. "They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, Imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families." Like Father says. "What's your surname anyway?"
"Theo says that if you didn't care about him you wouldn't have gone against Lucius' wishes and tried to warn him. Theo also says to stop looking at him." Theodore's great great grandmother was an Augurey, and he had many of the traits that the Irish Phoenix's were known for.
He flips me over, pushing my face into the mattress with one hand, the other presumably lining himself up. His knees go between my thighs and push to widen my stance. Wasting no time with gentle nudges, he thrusts home in just one go. The sound that wrenches itself from my throat can only be described as unholy.
"I'm not sure... Close the door?" Draco complies. When he looks up Potter has closed the space between them. He reaches his right hand up to grab a handful of Dracos white blond hair, pulling to expose his neck, leaning in to sniff greedily. "Yes. You do smell as good as you look," he says into the pale skin of Dracos neck. "You're a Veela, hmm?"
"I wish I could forget about it that easily," she replies, frowning now. "What with all the violent practices held at the Manor and such, breaking my arm..." She trails off, not wanting to speak aloud of Gizzy. I know how hard that was for Pansy, and I'm not at all surprised she can't let go.
"What do you want?" Harry says, lifting his eyes from an article about cauldron thickness to fix his eyes on the lean blond boy beside him. Nobody should be allowed to be that attractive, and, coming from a straight guy, that says a lot.
After breakfast, she leads me out to the grounds with her, handing me a bucket of seed so I can join her in feeding the peacocks. Thinking back on it, they're probably my favorite part of life at the Manor. Mother and I used to come sit on the bench in the garden, the birds milling about curiously. I'd sit in her lap and she'd tell me stories, sometimes reading them to me, but other times making them up as she went. She'd taught me how to dance among the ivory roses and blush colored peonies, the fragrance soaking into our shining hair beneath the stars. It was here that I'd learnt of the stars, the constellations, the galaxies - I became so attached to the night sky it always felt like a close friend. My favorite was Sirius, the dog star, and when I told Mum this she had chuckled solemnly to herself, shaking her head eloquently. Apparently Sirius was the name of my Mother's cousin, brother to Regulus. She had told me teary eyed stories about the boys and their days at Hogwarts, lamenting about how much she had missed the two of them.
In our first potions class(with Gryffindor, no less) I couldn't help but steal looks at a very handsome boy whose named rhymed with "scary otter." Father had me practice potions all the time, with Snape tutoring me in the summers, so I hadn't felt the need to pay much attention to the lesson. Blaise sat next to me, with Pansy to his left, and neither of them seemed to enjoy being underground very much. It was quite weird actually, Blaise looked more grey than usual, and Pansys hair didn't shine green in the dim light. Her hair usually reminded me of a crow perched in the sun, black but slightly iridescent. She's told me it's probably because of her being part Nixie, a lake dwelling subspecies of Merfolk that resembled anthropomorphized frogs.
"Thanks Dobby," I say, eyes shut tight. An oddly hot weight falls into my lap and i look down to see fiery orange eyes, pupils blown looking up at me from Klaus' newly hairless, wrinkly face. "Care to give a warning next time?" He blinks at me, very slowly. {That's how cats say i love you}
Harry grabs his hand, a small frown on his face, and paces in front of an empty wall until a door appears. Draco gasps and pulls his hand away.
"Lucius, please," she begs, kneeling before him. "Please don't hurt him."
He hums in response just as I spot the biggest man I've ever seen, grinning at the other boy and holding enormous ice creams. "I say, look at that man!"
"Theo what the hell," I say, snorting. He just narrows his eyes at the cat, eyeing it over as though it could be hiding something in it's smokey black fur. "Theo, put him down."
That seems to do the trick. I get a glimpse of white scarring on the back of his right hand in the moonlight before it's placed on my neck. Potter doesn't press, or squeeze, or do anything for that matter; he just stares at me with a challenge in his eyes.
"Shut up and get it over with, Potter."
"No, Pans, those are Veela tattoos. Mom gave them to me today. Do you wanna go out and play with the cocks?" I ask hopefully, grabbing her wrist and running when she nods. "The chicks are just starting to get their adult plumage, look," I say, pointing at a very leggy female - she's grey-brown with bright blue shoulders and a scalloped pea green neck, and the skin around her eyes is yellow. "That's a java green. Out of all the varieties, those ones have the prettiest females." I smirk at her.
Rather than focus on him, I turn to the decor. Blaise did quite a nice job on the drapes: silver lace gently taming the greenish light from the window behind the stage, a plush green velvet pillow on the stool Daphne put together, extra candles lit upon the walls. It was cozy. Cozy enough to make me drift to sleep during Flint's juggling act.
Gilderoy Lockhart is signing books in Flourish and Blotts today. Dobby tried to warn Potter, but to no avail. So I'm forced to wait for him with Father, preparing myself to plant the Dark Lord's diary from school on him. Father isn't sure what it'll do, but Dobby said it has powerful magic that will release a great beast. I'm not sure if I can follow through with my father's wishes.
When he looks up into Harry's gaze, his hunger is reflected in those emerald eyes. Draco drags Harry into the hot, frothy water and kisses him full on the mouth while Potter squeezes his arse.
"Don't. Scratch me as much as you can. Choke me. Merlin, just fucking hurt me, please." I'm practically begging her already, but she grins sadistically before gripping my hair and pulling me down to her eye level.
The way he scissors me open would have been downright painful if not for how he frequently caressed my prostate. He went in almost dry with his fingers, stretching me with scary urgency. I feel like I'm floating. His hand on my neck reduces blood flow to my brain as he reduces me to a downright, shivering, moaning mess.
It lands firmly in her chest, a terrific crunch echoing in the stillness. She giggles breathlessly, eyes glinting when she meets my gaze again. Adelphi drops to her knees before crawling closer to me, grabbing my collar in both hands. Her blood gushes over both of us like some gruesome hot spring.
"Get me out of here before I make you lose some," I mutter, my eyes closimg against my will. The hands return, followed by thick, muscular arms. I'm pulled into a hug, swirling through existence, unable to breathe. He's stronger than I thought, and apparently Adelphi isn't the only one trying to kill me tonight. Only difference being that he's trying to strangle me rather than--

"Oh yeah, oops. Okay," Harry breathes out, cheeks burning as he lines himself up. "I'll just, er, grab your waist. I got you," the last word turns into a question as he slides into the tight heat of Dracos arse, breaking into a moan at the insanity of it.
"I wonder how long you'll be waiting, spread across dumpsters around the city, before some poor Auror or Muggle policeman finds one of your parts. Maybe the search for the rest of you will take weeks... Yeah, I'm gonna cut you into as many pieces as I can. Don'tcha think that'll be fun?"
"Master Draco!" He squeals, trying and failing to push the rogue Kneazle off his scrawny shoulders. "Your father has a terrible plan!"
"Is that a promise?" He waggles his eyebrows in the most annoying way possible, smirking wildly.
"No. Yes. Water based lube wouldn't work in the water, it'd get washed up. Silicone lube kills condoms but would be good in this particular situation." He pauses for an answer, but it doesn't come. "Just... Hand over the bottle."
"She's right, Malfoy," Theo mutters. The whole group turns to him and his expression goes blank. His eyes are open wide and glazed over, and the way his mouth looks gives the distinct impression that there's a toad inside that's desperately trying to escape. He leans to Blaise and whispers something inaudible.
Fire. It seems it's all I've ever had. It comes from my talons, bursting from my skin and shredding all logical thought. Fire. It's the only thing that keeps me safe. Each day I can feel it burning within me. Fire. It burns my thoughts into ashes, showing no mercy. It courses through my being, my body, my soul-it belongs to me and me only. Fire. The only thing that can make sense of the chaos surrounding me. Maybe it made me.
"Draco, I'm having a bit of trouble with this. Do you think you could help me?" Luna asked from beside him.
He opened the book and the writing was back,
It felt like he had been punched in the gut. Was this what the others had felt when he had done the exact same things? He already felt guilty for his past but this...
He felt numb, like his whole world was falling apart.
"Where did you find this?" She narrowed her eyes.
"No! No Hermione! I don't want your help! I don't want anyone's help!" Draco's voice sounded distorted at the end, and he slapped his hand over his mouth. When he retracted his hand, he was looking at it in horror. He was looking at
"Not you too," Draco sighed. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had been acting this way as well. It was getting annoying and quickly. Draco didn't like not knowing things. He wasn't used to it!
Pain blinded him in his arm, but he heard the basilisk gurgle and knew that he had hit the basilisk.
And for the first time in history. Hermione Granger walked out of a class before she was dismissed.
"Justin's been petrified!" Dean burst into the common room looking pale.
When his father checked his phone a few more times than he was supposed to during family dinner, he knew he would have to stay in his room for the rest of the night.
Terry (or at least, Ron looked exactly like Terry) came out of his stall, looking at himself. When he looked at Harry, he gasped.
If it was possible, the Eagle would have scoffed, but since it wasn't, it let him through.
Everyone in the great hall looked on in horror, some in amazement, and some in confusion as the heir to the Malfoy family chanted 'Not Slytherin' while being sorted. A quick glance at the Slytherin table would tell you how the Slytherin's felt about this.
"Surely you've heard the rumors about him excelling in all his subjects, now we know how he does it, he is magically gifted." Albus chimed in.
to the poor cat!" Draco said, looking at him in fear.
WHAT DO YOU MEANNNNNNN
"Come on, Draco. We know you don't come to the Quidditch matches, but you have to know about the Slytherin vs. Gryffindor match today!" Terry sat down next to him.
"What are you three doing here?" A voice spoke from behind them. It was Professor McGonagall.
"So..." Harry started and they both looked at each other.
Hermione gasped, "I think I'm going to be sick." She gagged and ran into a stall, shutting the door.
They stood outside her office, she was walking out of it, writing on a few peices of paper.
"I thought he was my friend!" Hermione yelled and looked away, putting her hands in her face.
He grabbed a book from the shelf and began flipping through the pages, ignoring them all until he landed on the one with a moving picture of a blue rose.
"Harry!" He heard Ron call after him, but Harry didn't care. He was going to save Draco and he wouldn't let some scary slide get in the way of it.
He was happy that he had the oppurtunity to be taught by McGonagall privately, but really, this was getting ridiculous, what was next, Quirell?
"Things have been changing, with me, my hair's softer than ever, my eyes are more blue, even my skin's softer, what's happening to me?" All three of their eyes widened and Draco had to suppress a smirk, they had connected the dots.
My, My, look at me, treating you all with two chapters in a row.
Draco thought about it for a moment, was he okay? No, he wasn't, he had just broken his friend's heart and he felt like crying, Harry and Ron would most likely never talk to him again and everything had just gotten so fucked up, he didn't even know why he had just ruined their friendship...
"Draco Malfoy!" He flinched, a booming voice yelling right in his ear.
"Shhh!" Harry put a finger to his mouth, he didn't want them to wake up Draco, he already looked really tired, if the dark circles under his eyes were anything to go by.
"Well... you see... I might have shown Draco into your room earlier today. He looked weird." Seamus shrugged and Hermione whipped around.
"Finnigan?" Draco asked, annoyed.
Draco was about to speak up when he heard a familiar voice, "Harry? Draco? What're yeh doing 'ere." Hagrid walked down the entrance to Knockturn, looking at Harry and Draco in confusion.
"Today, we will be learning about Animagi, can anyone tell me what those are?"
He made his way to his bed, no one else was in the room right now, he had time to think.
Nott flew up to Harry, most likely mocking him, when the Snitch came up right next to him. Nott didn't notice it (how thick could you be?) but Harry did. Even when a Bludger was chasing him, he dove after the Snitch. Nott followed him right after, and they plunged into the foundation of the pitch. Draco couldn't see them, but he wasn't worried; he knew that Harry would make it out alive. He had last time.
"You shouldn't get lost in your Inner Eye for so long, child." Everyone heard, gasps ringing through the crowd. Hermione gave him a look and Draco found himself inching away from her; she looked at him not unlike she looked at a new book.
"Hermione!" Hagrid greeted her, and she joined them in Flourish and Botts, which was unexpectedly crowded, more so than normal.
"I think Draco's part Veela," Hermione said unexpectedly.
"An omen of death, Harry. The worst omen of death." Draco's voice got smaller as images of Harry in various encounters flashed through his mind. What if he had done something that would make this year go different? It had already happened last year.
"No, you idiot." Draco's voice sounded watery, and he sniffed in the middle of the short sentence, but he was feeling better, Potter was distracting him, keeping Draco from looking in the mirror again, keeping Draco from letting his emotions out, because Draco knew, if he let them out now, he wouldn't be able to bring them back in.
"I have a favor to ask, Severus." Draco cut to the point. Severus hated it when people wasted his time.
Ron didn't stop but yelled, "What?!"
to eat the oranges alright?"
Draco
Draco returned to potting his mandrake.
The book, it was the book, as soon as he touched it, a feeling flooded through his veins, he didn't know how to describe it, content? Maybe happiness?
"No." Draco yawned and pushed deeper into his pillow, it was weirdly warm and hard.
Draco looked at the other Snape.
So much.
"Fine, let's tell McGonagall." Draco would love to see how this would turn out, if they weren't going to listen to him, he wasn't going to suggest his brilliant ideas anymore, that would teach them.
He could play this off as a seer vision, couldn't he? He opened his mouth to tell her that it was, but the words wouldn't come out, he could say anything else, but not that it was a vision, he tried, but they wouldn't come out, why wouldn't they come out?
"Hermione, that's a load of bollocks. How could a book possess someone?" Ron laughed despite the withering glare Hermione was giving him.
Looking around, he could tell that they already were.
"Really, that subject is absolutely blasphemous." Hermione waved a fork in the air, no doubt ready to go on a rant on the subject.
But, the telly had never shown a man and a man falling in love, he had never seen it in real life either, was it even an option, or was he just a
"You idiot! You utter idiot!" Draco started, and Ron groaned, slamming his face against the wheel.
"Fight a Basilisk?" Harry said, amusement lacing his voice.
Right after Lunch was Care of Magical Creatures. Sadly, it wasn't a class Draco shared with the others, so he met with the other Ravenclaws he had taken to hanging out with: Luna Lovegood, Terry Boot, and Anthony Goldenstein.

"Happens all the time in the muggle movies," Terry nodded sagely.
There wasn't much known about

"A Veelas allure is very powerfull Mr. Malfoy, the weak willed will fall prey to it, and that is a dangerous thing. People will try to touch you, and you must tell them no, some will still try, if they do then you are free to use as much magical force is necessary to get them off. I do not want you to feel guilty about hurting them, while yes the Allure will be strong, it is not unfightable, and only those that want to give in, will."
"They just found him," Dean nodded.
Something told him that this year was going to be much more interesting.
"Oh my god, do you have a crush on Nott?" Ron yelled.
Draco settled back onto his bed and grabbed one of the books that were on his side table. After all that had happened this year, he had completely forgotten about his research. There were still many things he had to educate himself on. As well as talk to a certain Centaur. The year was nearly over and he was being closely watched, but there were still ways to get into contact with beings in the Forbidden Forest.
"Yeah, good." Draco nodded, picking up the abandoned lamp and handing it to Harry, who took it, not even paying attention to what Draco was putting in his hands.
Knowing that he was the reason Flitwick was this happy brought a small smile to his face -he had a heart- which turned into a full blown one when he heard what the man said,
Hermione rolled her eyes and went back to her food, pointedly not looking at him. Draco resisted the urge to do the same to her. Instead opting to pull out a book from his bag. The Malfoy family library had quite a bit on Seers and Time Travel. Merlin knows no one in the family actually read them, though. They were merely there for display, just as much of the house was.
"Approve of?" Draco raised an eyebrow.
I just wanted to say that I love you all, and this story has received so much more praise than I had ever thought it would, I've been rewatching the movies to make everything a bit more accurate, and I just want you all to know how much I love you.
The Diary.
do?" He tilted his head, and his expression changed once again, this time morphing into fear and horror.
"Professor Flitwick kept him after class, he did a non-verbal spell his first try!" Patil said with the same childish excitement.
parseltongue!" Draco continued to yell from his hospital bed.
"I told you!" Harry yelled in triumph as he saw their stumped faces.
Luna giggled. "The Lovey Doveys have been talking with the Cupid babies about this, you know. They've been very excited. It's so rare for them to see a courting that they actually approve of."
He turned around and yelled, "You brat--"
Draco quickly turned his thought away. Thinking about last year always made him feel awful. Like he was drowning. Like everything was muffled and far away and the only thing he could think about was that awful diary and how he
With that, he left and made his way back to the Ravenclaw dormitory, not looking back at Severus, he didn't want to get into an argument with him, not now, not when the memories were still fresh in his mind.
"You know Dobby?" Harry questioned.
*********************
"What vapor?"
Draco's train of thought crashed and burned,
But now Draco had a question, if he didn't travel back, if he had stayed in the Manor while everyone was dying, while the Death Eaters were killing everyone one by one, when they had finally killed professor Snape, if he had stayed, would he still have had the vision, the prophesy.
"What do you want?" Draco questioned, eyeing the paper in the boy's hands.
Draco held his breath as he walked into the office once again, almost two months after he had fainted inside of it, that thought brought another one into Draco's mind, he had stayed at the castle during Winter break, the first time he had ever done so.
Never in a million years would he have imagined himself in this position. Merlin would rise again before he would agree to this. But... the guilt for what he had done last year was eating him up inside. He would never disobey his lord but.... at the expense of his own child. The thought pained him more than he would ever admit. Could he really deny him this after the hell he had put him through last year? The summer had been hell for him. Hearing his child cry out in his sleep and the aged look in his eyes.
Draco turned to the left, where he saw a transparent person leaning into him. He backed away; once it wasn't directly in his face, he recognized the ghost as Moaning Myrtle. He had forgotten that she haunted this bathroom.
Luna scurried back over to them. She didn't look as composed as she normally did. But she looked better and nowhere near as terrified as she was before, so that was a good thing.
product.
"What if she says no?" He asked.
"That was not a question Albus, it was merely a statement." How idiotic did he think Draco was?
He had met the man who had written the book, and he had helped him, a weird man, but a sweet one. Draco believed his name was,
"Of course, Headmaster, if you hadn't called me down, I probably would have come here myself. Speaking of coming here, I had a question.." Draco let himself trail off and looked away, seemingly nervous (he was, but not about what they were thinking).
"Obviously-" He looked up but cut himself off again.
"Are you okay?" Harry asked, and Draco lazily tried to hit him in the head once again but missed as he had aimed for the wrong Harry, oh great, he was seeing double.
Immediately, the man started screeching, crying out "It burns!"
He flicked his wand and the letters moved to rearrange themselves into a new word, a new sentence.
Was this part of the prophesy, the boy had said a prodigy, he had said many things, Albus had already stored them in his mind, he would write it down later.
I'm trying to fix my mistakes, and I don't know why I can't!" The rage was still there, but now there was also sadness. His emotions were all jumbled up; he didn't know what to feel. Should he be sad, or angry?
Lucius let out a sigh, and if he wasn't the respectable Pureblood he was, he would have run a hand over his face. Opposing Nott. The house of Nott wasn't one he thought of often. They didn't normally stand out much. They were like the houses of Greengrass and Parkinson; not nearly important enough for a Malfoy such as himself to pay attention to.
Lucius opened it and read aloud once again,
****************
"What is it, Professor?" Dean Thomas asked, his eyebrows furrowed in concern.
Draco was awake now, he lifted his head to glare at the person in question, only to find the twins standing above him and the room lit up with sunlight, how long had he been sleeping? And why did his pillow have a heartbeat?
"Mr Malfoy, my eyes are here." Okay, so wrong Snape.
"The boat has not sunk, all the people on it are married."
Hermione got the Diary and made to leave the room with Ron when she heard Harry say something to Draco. "So, I saw this and thought of you, so..."
***********
"Why didn't you use the rooster, you idiot?!" Draco ignored his question and continued to yell at him in a wobbly voice.
"Gryffindor!" The hat called out.
"I did not you lia-"
"Hermione!" Ron yelled at the same time as Harry yelled, "Draco!", were those dunces even listening to them, Hermione had said stay still and yet they were struggling like fishes out of water.
"I just thought of the incantation in my head and then swished and flicked." He smiled sheepishly.
Potter waited for a second before answering him, as if he was waiting for Draco to yell something out again, "Just follow me."
"What are we doing, and why did you stuff me inside a dusty old classroom?" Draco was slightly annoyed, and he made sure it spilt into his tone.
Suddenly, the whole animosity between Potter and Malfoy made sense. But he wasn't that person anymore. And neither was Harry. In a way, Malfoy was a different person. As well as Potter. It was no longer Potter and Malfoy, instead, it was
"You fir--" Ron said but Harry was already ahead of him.
Albus Dumbledore.
************************
"Patronus?" Harry asked.
"See, all it took was one trip to Draco and he figured out what we've been trying to for months!" Harry looked at him, now he was the one who was starstruck, and Draco couldn't help but blush, he loved compliments.
Oh shit, he used the wrong name, Potter didn't seem to mind though, he looked happy that Draco wasn't yelling at him.
"It shows us what we want?" Harry asked, another question, another distraction, and yes, Draco decided that he liked this Potter, he was a welcome distraction to everything.
"She said yes! She said yes!" Harry squealed in a voice that could break glass.
It didn't take long for Draco to recognize the man as Remus Lupin. The werewolf. His prejudice towards werewolves hadn't gone away in the slightest. But that was to be expected when you had Fenrir fucking Greyback in your house for a year.
Potter dragged Draco across the castle, it was weird, they had walked past Flich without him even noticing they were there, Potter even did a few childish faces, moking the man.
"Okay. I'm going to sound crazy, I know, but let's go to the library." It looked like it physically pained Ron to say those words, and despite the circumstances, Hermione giggled.
"So, Malfoy, I wanted to ask you something." Weasley spoke up.
Draco wasn't really walking towards Luna; he was being dragged by Terry while Anthony was bouncing next to them, blabbing about something. He learned two things right there: Terry was abnormally strong and energetic, and Anthony couldn't stop talking for more than two minutes.
He whipped around, wand already pointed, and came face to face with Remus Lupin. That didn't do anything to calm him because all he could think was
Potter picks Draco up bridal style, placing him in the bubbling and steaming water, making a great show of undressing himself. His tan, thick fingers slowly unbutton Harry's best school shirt, and Draco knows at once that they'd feel criminally good inside him. Each inch of caramel skin that gets revealed is absolutely delicious looking, taut muscles and scars slightly lighter than the rest of the skin. Draco wants nothing more than to lick the boy in front of him, and his mouth waters as Harry reaches to undo his trousers.
"My mother gave them to me, your Grandma Black. They're sigil tattoos, but very faint, and very powerful. The ink is ground up gemstones - labradorite, sodalite, lepidolite, to name a few - ground up into pieces small enough to float between the layers of your skin. That's why they sparkle." She pauses, resting her hands on my shoulders again. "I will give you yours today, my dragon. It may hurt a bit, but it is an important tradition that will keep you safe, and pain is but a temporary emotion. Besides, I've a salve prepared to numb the stinging afterwards."
When she finally faces me again, she has her wand in hand, and gestures for me to sit on our bench. A young silver spaulding cock jumps to sit next to me, nipping my fingers affectionately to hide the fact he's searching me for seed. With all my years experience with peafowl, I see straight through his ruse.
"Make me."
(See the end of the chapter for
I walk down the carpeted wooden steps, toward my demise. "Bet you loved that, Potter," I say with a sneer and then I'm nose-to-nose with my "nemesis."

"Ok, well," I breathe in, trying to decide how to explain. "We were patrolling the forest, and Longbottom asked about Father. I got pissed and transformed. Hagrid put me with Potter instead and next I can remember I'm having nightmares about dead unicorns getting their blood drunk and burning people alive. Is that good enough for you?" I say, exasperated. She frowns, but leaves the dorm reluctantly without another word to me.
Vincent, funnily enough, was one fourth River Troll. It gave him an odd appearance - flat nose, hairy arms, wide shoulders, fat neck, etc. - but my favorite part (to laugh at), was his stupid grunt of a voice. He can't transform like the more animalistic of us.
"Wait, so you and Longbottom.... ?" Draco lets his silver eyes travel to Neville, landing on Harry and going back again. Harry scratches his neck, clearly uncomfortable.
I want to see him using Sectumsempra, the same exact spell he had used on me in our 6th year, on a Dark wizard; I want to see him covered in sweat, blood, and tears while he interrogates a prisoner; I want to have him cut neat stripes down my chest and lick away my blood; I want to have him pound into me like I have no say in it; I want Him.
"Young Master Malfoy, I presume you share the wish of Master Blaise? Dobby can leaves you be if you wants."
"Give it here, Malfoy," Potter growls at me, and I feel the indistinct urge to show off for him. Am I displaying for him?! I smile and continue my show.
"We have a different idea of what disgraces the name of Wizard, Malfoy."
"Say that again," says Weasley, face red as his hair. What did I even say again?
"If you get uncomfortable, name a vegetable," Malfoy breathes into the caramel skin of Harry's neck. Harry chuckles breathlessly.
Consciousness hits me like a brick before I can register why my cheek burns. Father stands above me, hand raised and ready to strike me again. It seems I had another hot dream.
He gets cut off by long, slender fingers that reach around to grab the nape of his neck in an unyielding grip, yanking him forward to meet a pale pink pout.
"No!" Bella shrieks, turning to face them. The fire retreats down her arms, sitting content in her palms. Her face contorted in horror, she's a monster. She must be. "Don't look at me!" She cries, bloody tears streaking down her face. Her eyes go blank, and she drops to her knees. A dizzy smile appears on her face as she transforms back. Behind her, Cygnus Black stands with his wand pointed at Bella's neck. He must be protecting Cissa and Andy, he must be.
A sudden commotion at the signing stand grabs my attention and I look down in time to see a very nervous looking Harry held in a deathgrip by Lockhart while a camera flashes at them avidly.
"You, I? Would - really?" Now it's Dracos turn to laugh.
Many things happen at once.
I couldn't hide my interest this time. He had a huge spread of sweets around him, and with that much ambition, even for food, he must be a Slytherin. Maybe he'd share a dorm with me...
The Mudblood, Granger, began clinging to Potter and Weasley after the incident with the troll, validating the rumor that they had fought the troll together, as she seemed to quite dislike them beforehand.
"Do you get off on the fact that you just had a near death experience?" He cocks an eyebrow, hands slowing to a snail's pace. "Or maybe you should think about your pregnant wife who has no idea whether you're alive or dead right now. You go to bars often?" I nod. He chuckles. "Does she get off on knowing you're fucking other people?" His massive cock is finally released, and Potter pounces on me.
"Merlin, would you all just shut up?! Draco this, Draco that," Daphne begins, "The rest of us have problems too, what the hell is so important that we must listen to his every whim or worry? Hmm?!"
I'm so sorry about this. Your Godfather owled to us about how often he's caught you mid-transformation, and your Father decided it best to add some Power Sedative to the sweets I made for you. Hopefully it doesn't taste too bad, darling. Please write home soon, I miss you very dearly.
Apparently that was enough for her, because she relents. I jump off the couch, turning to see her frowning at her hands. Blaise pokes her neck, causing her to leap from his lap, as well.
Andromeda's fingers lengthen to sharp points. Pearly pink wings sprout from her shoulders. Fire creeps from her hands to her chest. She flings a handful of flame at her father's face. This must be done.
I spot him, sitting in the front row, just in time to see him hop up with a gentle smile plastered to his lips. He takes the stool from Bulstrode, pulling it out from under her rather than pushing her off. He's blond, plays Keeper for our Quidditch team, and one of few Muggleborns in our House. Unfortunately, he's also quite attractive.
The gameskeeper decides to put me with Pretty Boy Potter instead, and off we go. He spots a unicorn, bright white under the light of the moon. I would have noticed it sooner had I not been in shock over how I almost burnt Longbottom to a crisp.
"H-Harry?" Neville sits up, blinking groggily and rubbing his eyes. When Longbottom is awake enough to register what he's seeing, the forms of the other boys are separated by about five feet. "Were you two-"
"No, I just-" Harry breaks off, laughing. "Vampire fangs have an odd chemical on them? Like venom, almost? And it gives an, er, a happy sort of effect. As in, like, you know? Are you happy to see me, or is your wand in your pocket type deal, yeah?"
"Busy time at the Ministry, I hear. All those raids..." Father let's the sentence hang in the air before continuing, "I hope they're paying you overtime?" He sneers, reaching into what I presume to be Potter's cauldron and pulling out a Transfiguration textbook. "Obviously not," he drawls, opening the book and placing something in it discreetly. Oh fuck. "Dear me, what's the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it?"
"You're more forward than most of the people I've met here."
"Malfoy," calls Flint, Slytherin captain. "Write your father and tell him thanks for the brooms. You're part of the team now."
"What the hell does that mean?" Draco asks angrily. "Are-Are you calling me a lesbian?" Harry chuckles and it only winds up the blond even further.
i love comments very very much! i was unfocused when writing this, mainly due to anger at my cat who had spilled coffee on the books i had just bought
Suddenly the people he is speaking to are all bright red tomatoes.
Of course, Pretty Boy and Red got to school through other means. The first morning back at school was punctuated not only by their return, but the Howler that Weasleys mother sent. I try to save Harry, and this is what I get instead? He put himself in more danger, got seen by Muggles, and to top it off, they get a Howler when I'm partway transformed and my senses are far beyond humanly possible. So not only am I boiling my orange juice with my fire, but I'm deafened for the day. I can't even hear my own screams when my Godfather is using the Cruciatus Curse on me before class as punishment. Who cares, anyway?
"I'd take you anytime on my own," I growl, hoping he'll take the bait. Maybe I can actually talk to him, alone. "Tonight, if you want. Wizard's duel. Wands only - no contact," even if I wanna touch your hair. I notice the flash of fear in his emerald eyes. "What's the matter? Never heard of a wizard's duel before, I suppose?"
"Tell me, do I smell as good as I look, Potter?" He falters at this, and Draco seizes the chance to eye him over. His caramel skin practically gleams over his muscular form, his emerald gaze more intense than Dumbledores, his curly black hair muffed up and windswept endearingly.
"You liked that, didn't you? You're fucking disgusting." I can't find any way to respond, any words that can get me out of this scrutiny. I feel incredibly vulnerable, but the worst part is that I might actually like this? "I can see you eye fucking me all the time. Is it true the other Unspeakables hide from you when I drop off artifacts? It must be - I can see it in your eyes. Maybe we aren't so different, Malfoy. After all, I've been wanting this for a long time. Wanting you, that is. And now I shall have you." He flicks his hand and our clothes are Vanished, the raw power he emits radiating under his skin and dancing along my spine tantalizingly.
I tentatively reach up a hand to put the naked Kneazle, noting that Dobby is wrapping up a charcoal colored yarnball in my peripheral vision. When I touch Klaus, he feels like a hot peach with an excess of skin. It's an odd sensation, and he purrs into my palm, pressing his face into my hand.
"Potter, you've got yourself a girlfriend!" I say somewhat jealously. Maybe I want him to be my boyfriend. Her face went as red as her hair in embarrassment.
They weren't close, exactly, and they never miss a chance to poke fun at each other, but their jokes and jibes and insults hold none of the venom they had held in the past. It was odd, really. The two boys had hated each other for nearly seven years before they came to the realization that they were two sides of the same coin. Both were used in the war, neither were given much choice, both suffered losses of people they loved, neither were treated well at home. Yet it was far beyond impossible for them to just leave the past in the past and start over - they held too much bitterness from old, immature habits.
Potter nods.
Inside, a king sized bed with silky black sheets in the back; a grey couch sat in front of a great, roaring hearth to the left; a jacuzzi on the right; a large counter running along most of the walls at a perfect height to bend someone over. The entire back wall is covered in shelves which display an impressive array of lubes, condoms, dildos, ropes, massage bars, and first aid items.
original author's notes literally just say that party rock has not been in the house tonight for many months. yeah. anyways comments are nice
"Where did it even come from?" Pansy thinks aloud, rubbing her hand on the green silk sheets on my four poster. Blaise wiggles his chin and looks up at the ceiling, seeming thoughtful.
Trying to hide it with a sneer, I say, "Oh yeah?" And he reminds me my bodyguards are still on the ground. Sly little bitch. "Catch it if you can, then!" I retaliate, dropping the Remembrall, watching for his next action.
"What the fuck? Malfoy?"
"How could you... Potter?" Dracos voice rises in pitch, breath catching in fear when he sees tiny little fangs when Potter pulls back with a grin.
"I was already heading here, like I said. It's mine and my girlfriends one month today, and I was going to make her something special." He shuffles his feet as he talks. Must be a nervous habit.
"Holy shit, Malfoy. Keep an eye on 'em, eh?" Diggory calls from across the room. Hei snickers in his lap.
"Who do you think did it?" Pansy asks excitedly, sitting on Blaise's lap and laying over mine. I absently run my fingers through her hair, reminded of when she would cry on us after an especially horrid flying lesson at the Manor.
"Ok, that's a vegetable. Took you a while, Harry," he turns to leave before his smile drops at the notice of his mistake.
