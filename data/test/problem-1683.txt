That round little pudgy face, big intelligent brown eyes watching the whole thing play out. Those same brown eyes I got to stare into earlier today as she screamed her son into the world. Those same brown eyes I saw in miniature when little Vincent stared up at me. Our baby girl is a Mama. A fierce mama bear that will wrangle the world into exactly the place she wants her son to grow up in.
I pointed to Elena and Ethan (yes, we somehow managed to get a muggle with no direct relation in the wizarding world permission to attend the ritual!), along with Beatrix, Finnegan, Antonio, Eric, Martin, and Guinevere. Those eight were ready and waiting, bravely stripping off to illustrate that the students could do so as well - IF they wanted to - before starting up on their drumming. The students and their parents were all given a choice to join in on the drumming (which is a *lot* of drums that had to be conjured!), or the dancing. The five of us taught the traditional dances from around the world, encouraging everyone to dance, take breaks by drumming and getting something to drink, and then dance some more, haha!
So I started thinking about places we haven't been. Where would we like to go and explore? But then I realized that we're taking a massive group so what if I pick somewhere we've never been and it turns out awful. Now we're stuck in some awful place with a million children all because I wanted to try something new and different.
You started spanking me, but they definitely felt like your warm-up spankings. This was going to get so good. "You can start out as hard as you like, but I find if I get him good and warmed up first and increase the intensity gradually, I can really make his cute little arse a beautiful shade of red." Oh my bloody hell, you were talking about me like I wasn't even there again. "Come over here and watch this." Fuck, you were spanking me with Neville only a foot away from my quickly warming backside. The two of you started discussing technique and how to avoid getting your own hand too sore. And then, "why don't you give him a couple so you can really gauge how hard you can go. Don't worry, my Harry enjoys a flogging and even the occasional caning, you couldn't hurt him with your bare hand if you tried." Fuck, don't challenge the man!
The man had a fit of apoplexy, as far as I could tell, coupled with a minor heart attack. It took him a good minute or two to stop practically choking on his own tongue and spit out a thank you. Also, his hands shook so much that he dropped the voucher three times before managing to attach it to his clip board.
We made our way to the playroom and managed to get about five minutes of snogging and groping in while we waiting for Charlie and Neville to arrive. They popped in, and I could barely contain my giggles. Besides the collar he wears no matter what he's doing, Charlie had none of his pup gear on. He may as well have since he was so excited, bouncing on his heals, panting a little, big goopy smile, if he had a tail he would have been wagging it!
-Haz: "No, Eris would be in Slytherin. She and I are a team, I will most definitely be Slytherin, she'll go there too."
I know what you mean about worrying that going to the festival was too much, too soon. And if we weren't taking the children it would definitely be. I adored our wonderful weekend, but as I told the grandmothers it was just too long for me to be away from them while they're so tiny! One overnight would have been lovely, but two nights was rough. But if we're taking Muffy and Dibly and two of the five children are old enough to need supervision but not a ton of hands on care, it will be wonderful. I am just imagining Lainie having a million tiny heart attacks over the sheer volume of music she will get to experience.
I raised a brow at her in a near snarl. Apparently her definition of NOT sexist is a person who agrees that she CAN do an equal job as the men all while expecting to be treated like a Princess. Rather than correct her erroneous assumption - AGAIN - I simply whipped out my wand and cast: "Petrificus Totalis!" After that, I conjured a bodybag, zipped her up in it, and pointed at a huge brawler of a new student - who was already decently competent since he was already an Auror.
Oh! Wow, I got off topic huh? Long story as short as I can possibly make it, I ran out of stuff to do. Yeah, I was so worried about not having to see someone that I wanted to hex, that I got here much too early and was bored around two in the afternoon. And now that I've removed myself from the situation, I feel really embarrassed and immature for running out on my son's announcement. I feel like an utter shite. If Orion hasn't already emotionally emancipated himself from being my son, tell him I love him and I'm sorry I ran away like a coward.
Yes! There are a ton of musicals that haven't been turned into movies. We can go to any music shop and order sheet music and sometimes even scripts for musicals. You and Elena should take a trip into London some time soon, browse for music, and then shop for costumes!
This could be it! This could be what gets Gina Mitchell safely out of the lives of these children she tried to ruin!
I kissed him for a few long and leisurely minutes. "Yeah, I suppose that I would like having an opportunity to walk around your mind. Once in, it's actually relatively easy to bring you into my mind too, if you want."
Alright, I am going to spiral if I keep thinking about this. She's a little girl, she's scared, she needs her Daddy to not be an arsehole. I can't go back in time and change things, I can only support her going forward. Please remind me of this if you see me in a panic spiral alright?
"Yeah, I'll send out a group text to the Aurors - even those not on duty," Robards promised. "As they can get here quickly enough if they should happen to receive their message. We'll coordinate in the Auror tent."
My father sang an absurd song that worked because his long flowing platinum blond hair as actually rather perfect for it, haha. Pansy sang the part of 'Ken' - which is now one of my top ten best life moments! Too bad, hahaha, it such a shame that my siblings had to miss this, ahahahahahahaha!
Ungh, I didn't originally intend for this to be sexy. I just wanted to make you feel better. But seeing your arse on display and then all plugged up. Hearing you moan and groan your way through the entire filling portion of the enema. That rock hard shaft of yours dripping and begging to be touched. I think I may have discovered a new kink.
"Alright," Jacob agreed with a grin. She ran and he really did chase her around the hill a few times. JUST as he was closing into to catch her, she squealed in fake alarm, turned to run in a different direction, and lightly pushed him.
Parvati Patil was at the South Point, which is associated with summer (fire) and Gryffindor. "I call upon the Goddess Parvati, consort of Shiva, Goddess of Harvest and Protector of women! Hear me and join us in this celebration!"
I was taken a bit aback at first. "Erm... well technically I'm Bisexual, but hmm... I supposed I first realized that I might be... different when I was watching a particular boy. All. The. Time. He seemed to be all I could think about and I was quite obsessed. For the longest time, that boy seemed to loathe me, and so, I had to do my best to get his attention in any way possible, often by making him miserable or embarrassed."
Harry thinks he won the private Seeker's challenge and Draco feels that Harry only proved his point.
After a bit, she wondered if she could practice her bellydancing, and since that is a dance form I also love - and requires absolutely no touching - I decided that would be a brilliant idea.
So, after that announcement was made, I was in the middle of shaking everyone's hands - as were Pippa and the girls as they were being included in the mini celebration, but don't worry, only a single glass of Vodka was passed around for us all to drink from - when something unexpected occurred.
So, as it turns out, there's quite a bit of scar tissue in Zaire's colon and last part of his large intestine that it actively interferes with his ability to go as he should. I have inadvertently been helping his problem NOT get worse by using magic to clean him out before things got out of hand, but still, it's an all around bad situation that our Dear Healer can thankfully fix.
Then he got that crazy look in his eye and he went a teeny bit RHH. Not a full cyclone, but it was getting breezy in that kitchen. "Ollie! He's wearing his wedding band!"
I was then inundated with six or seven children shouting angrily at their brother/uncle/friend. I could not stop laughing. Not only did Sebastian out that there was more than just himself that snuck into the show, but their own shouting slapped a guilty label on themselves. "Hey guys? I knew you were there. We had wards up that told us if anyone without a ticket got into the seating area."
On the one hand, I want to support him, but on the other, I want to lock him in a dragon guarded tower until I know for certain that he's not addicted - or has broken the habit if he is.
You are probably right about the Occlumency versus Legilimency. I excelled at Occlumency because it was part of my upbringing to hide certain things. I'm sure you probably noticed this already, but even while we were at school, I almost never let anyone know when I was in actual pain unless it was to my benefit somehow, and then I made a scene out of it and milked it for every knut it was worth. Thus, Occlumency came naturally to me. I also *love* secrets, so I suppose that Legilimency came fairly easily to me too. That said, I can see how you are intuitive to emotions and would excel in Legilimency.
But even if you were discussing the specific technicalities of their birth, which you definitely were at that point, then "they" are clearly not your husbands' biological children? False. Gabriel is my freaking magical heir for crying out loud!
I went and got drunk again today, and then I went and did something so stupid that it was almost Gryffindor. I announced to the world that I was dating you. See, what happened was, well, as I said, I got drunk. And in my drunkenness, I was dancing and flirting just a tiny bit, and someone (possibly Dimitri, it's a bit fuzzy actually) tried to kiss me, but I told them no. Apparently I *can* control myself when drunk. Sort of.
You wasted no time. I thought with how sweet you were being, and this being your first non-doppelganger playdate that you might be slower or timid. No. You opened your mouth and seemed to try and swallow him whole.
I laughed. "You COULD, but I think you might have better luck pulling her in close during a dance and whispering in her ear some of the filthy things you can do to her, and then see how fast she drops her knickers - if she's even wearing any to begin with. In the light of day, it will probably never be that easy, but here in this club, well, that's what they're all here for. Might as well go take advantage of it."
Harry, you are most definitely right. I am not suited for this job - the actual job of running the Aurors. I DO like the challenge it presents, but there are FAR too many things to do each day. So I am going to take it on temporarily to fix the things that are wrong, but then hand it off to others.
I smirked at him almost evilly but didn't say anything. Instead, I watched as you fished stripping him off, and then set your mind and fingers to taking him apart and making him squeal. In the process, you prepared him so well that he *might* have been able to take Blaise. Well, probably not Blaise, seeing as how massive that man is, but you know what I mean.
We were there for Sirius, but the Viper asked to tag along since he's never had a chance to just be lighthearted and attempt to relax. I think he might actually be reluctant to let Sirius out of his sight at the moment. Perhaps afraid that Sirius will turn out to be a figment of his imagination after all.
"Now..." I drawled hesitantly before taking a breath and committing to a course of action. "Well, I suppose we can only see how far this goes. We can go into it with the best of intentions, and if it works, it's a win for all three of us, but if it doesn't work, at least we can feel confident that we tried and it just wasn't meant to be."
I also felt a bit powerful and like I could take over the world if I wanted, but since I've never wanted that, I just sort of let it fade as I fell asleep.
Imagining you wanking in general is detrimental to my sanity. Not to mention the mild friction burn I gave myself. Imagining you wanking to thoughts of *me* shagging you... Well, it takes my breath away.
Ugh, not so little anymore though. It's not by a whole lot, but just enough for her to tease me over it. She's taller than me! My oldest child, my little Lainie-Girl, is a full inch taller than I am. I think I'll start wearing heels from now on!
And then there're those vocalizations again. I really love them so much. Anyway, I think you can see why I think Kisa would love this song you had me learn, haha. Note, Kisa wasn't singing the song TO me - as a lover might - but to me because she wanted to share a song she loved and thought I would like.
Then the two of you started to undress each other, buttons came undone, trousers came off, and hands started to slide into pants. Nope, THIS is what was going to kill me! You both stood up and helped the other shuck their pants, and before I knew it, I was tied up and helpless while I watched Draco Malfoy drop to his knees and suck as much of Neville Longbottom's cock into his mouth as he was able. Neville began thrusting his hips, not enough to actively control the situation but just those little juts when you can't control your hips because of the talented mouth around you. Believe me, I know those hip thrusts! And after what felt like an eternity, I saw him shudder, heard him groan, and heard the unmistakable sounds of you swallowing as much as you could.
P.S. If you both agree I can't ask of you what I want to ask of you please tell me immediately. Just say "No Harry" so I can try and clear it out of my mind. We'll never speak of it again.
Speaking of tiny, Eris deflected the attention off of her by asking to hold Wojtek. "Vo-tek? Voy-tek?"
I don't know about you but I literally passed out still on top of and inside you. I sincerely prayed that my parents would be smart enough to let us sleep until at least noon. They probably would have - I certainly got to sleep nearly that long - but you apparently woke up around 9 or so, rolled me off you with a kiss, and left to go check on the kids.
And for something to read, they each got a copy of Tales of Beedle the Bard, a muggle fairy tales book, and then some sort of age appropriate book.
The live band - that had been playing various lively music all morning to set a good mood for the whole town and all the MANY guests that were flocking to the town from all over the world (as naturally, Viona had invited Unity Royalty that she's bonded with over the years). In fact, the pre-wedding celebration/party had been in full swing since around 11AM when the various shops opened to sell things like tea, lunch, and souvenirs. Yes. Viona had made (or at least approved the making of) official souvenirs for her wedding.
I'm going to sign off now and try to chat with Vanessa. Even if she doesn't respond, I can at least let her know that I'm trying. But before I go, just know that no matter what happens, I will be home tomorrow night. On the one hand, if I make progress and get her to open up to me tomorrow, we'll both need a break by nighttime, and on the other hand, if I DON'T, it'll more than likely be beneficial to have time apart at that point anyway.
Obviously doing his best not to offend me, Oliver pet me again. "I'm actually hoping to see you like this again at some point. It's weird, but you look adorable and I just want to pet you all day."
Are we still going to our mystery getaway you rescheduled from last week? It's been over 24 hours since our last shag and I am pretty sure I am going through withdrawals! We can reschedule again or we can escape tomorrow morning, whichever you want, but I WILL be getting at least 2 shags tonight to make up for this trauma I am suffering from! If we don't go anywhere this weekend I am going to ask Narcissa to garden with me, I think I could use the stress relief that comes from the earth.
As we ate, we chatted about this and that. He wanted to hear more about my vision and didn't quite believe I was serious about having the ability until I mentioned to him that it was part of the reason I originally wanted to be part of the Aurors - as a sort of consultant that ended up being the Chief of Raids. After our mouthwatering dessert of cherry cheesecake, Oliver pulled me close and wrapped one arm around me even as he rested his head on my shoulder, making me lean my head against his as we continued to talk about some of the raids I'd conducted over the years.
I gently picked it up and placed the memory back inside it. "Are you ready to face your own memories now? Or do you want to look through a few more of mine?"
You smirked evilly at me, reaching behind yourself for something you'd hidden. "Lift off Mutt, I'll help you get ready." As soon as you were out of my arse, I felt the blunt head of my favorite plug up against me. "You're too needy, I have to keep you all filled up so you don't maul me in public. This should keep you calm, yeah?"
"Oh, nothing to concern you, Longbottom. Charlie and I are simply talking about our mutual love for dragons and tattoos," I informed him. "I think he would look divine if he had a smaller Opaleye right about here." I caressed a line down the right side of Charlie's back. "What do you think?"
P.S. One of these years, we're going to have to attend (or host) the adult version of the ritual, heh heh heh...
I'm so sorry, I wasn't *trying* to be a snob or an arse, or whatever you want to call it. I'd never been to any muggle restaurants in all of Great Britain before. It's one thing to Portkey to Japan to eat at a prestigious muggle place there - because the culture is so very different that we could pretend that they weren't muggles, or what have you. It's *very* different to eat at a muggle place in one's own backyard - so to speak - because then one might have to admit that muggles aren't so different than us after all.
Eris sort of glared at me at that. "Is that your way of saying that you think I'm too young and would prefer that I just get rid of it!"
I’m glad, as we’re wizards, the fix was easy enough for you to have it done quickly and painlessly. Now, as much as I’m sure you hate having to admit to any weakness, aren’t you glad you got it checked out and fixed? Now you too can have option three: all the shagging you can get with none of the painful bollocks twinges.
They're going to keep looking, but at this point, a fair amount of luck will have to be involved in actually finding her.
Harry feels they have a certified menagerie, and Draco decides it's time for a Spa day with Elena and River.
Under normal circumstances, say Ron gets in a long and exhausting duel, and he comes out low on magic. Chances are that sleeping for two or three days would solve the problem and he'd be back to normal - by regenerating his own magic while sleeping. But let's say that despite winning the duel, he still needs to cast a bunch of wards to protect his kids (because he's alone with them for some reason. WAIT! Better example, the Viper. Picture him fighting tooth and nail to protect his kids). Well, in THAT instance - after a hard duel - his magic is too low to cast a simple Lumos, but since he NEEDS it, he takes a replenishing potion that is supposed to REPLACE a portion of his magic. In other words, give a little bit of simple generic magic to him. Even in a very strong and potent potion, it's only going to be able to replace so much. That's just biology, I suppose.
Whatever she was going to say next was cut short as my father kissed her. The same sort of kiss I give you that makes all the Kids groan in disgust. Apparently I am still a kid.
And when you've cried your last tear for the day, blown up your last vase, and glamoured the pink out of your weary eyes, we will be inviting our whole family for a lovely meal and game and movie night. Because not only have they all missed you these last weeks, but each of your children wants to be here for you.
"Wizard, actually," I corrected him with a light sneer. In shock, he ran off screeching as if I was a demon hound hot on his trail.
Oh! Speaking of staying somewhere … wow I am awesome at segues … Miles and Sammy will be here Monday morning bright and early. I promised Miles he could leave Sammy with us Monday evening so he can meet up with Colm and figure out what's going to change or stay the same now that they're on the same continent. Both with Sammy's custody and care, as well as their potential rekindling of the relationship.
You know how I've lain my head on your lap and talked about my various options as you've ran your hands through my hair - during those times when you're not busy signing things and giving interviews, that is. My main three out of all the many I have to choose from are:
Also, who was the other unnamed, when was this mysterious death, and who do I have to thank for the mystery?
Seven minutes. What in the hell? Okay, I think I need to hunt one of you down. Oh! Since Draco seems to think it's adorable to marmoset his way into my classes, maybe it's time Ollie gets to meet my foxy little friend.
"Yes, certainly," she agreed, looking relieved that I remembered she was a human who needed to eat at some point. It probably didn't help that she kissed my cheek as she left the room.
Necklace looked a bit affronted at this point. "What would you have me do? Throw away everything I've worked for my whole life? What would I do then? Work in your father's shop with you? Do you really think your father would let YOU take over his shop if he knew about us?!"
So here's how it would go down; we would be talking about some subject, let's say flowers, and he would say "I really like eucalyptus as the base greenery."
I think all of our travels prior to Iran were beautiful life experiences for our children to learn. They may be spoiled rich kids, but they are spoiled rich kids with enormous hearts who want to use every ounce of their privilege to make things better for those with less. I know, I've spent the last decade extolling the brilliance of our children. They're the cutest, and the smartest, and the funniest, and the most talented, blah blah blah. But in all seriousness, I don't know any children better than ours. They are just good, right down to their souls.
I held up a hand and made the BSL gesture for no. "You're wrong, you keep me scheduled and running on time. That's my JOB, not my entire life. And if it's any consolation, the fact that you are SO excellent at your job is the reason WHY I am letting you go. You are more than willing to work long hours with me, and you NEVER nag me into going home at a reasonable hour. You were the perfect secretary when that is what I needed, but now I need one that will kick my arse out of the office when I've put in a full day and it's time to go home and see my husband and children."
I think the Viper and I have come to an understanding. Yeah, saying "other me" and "other Harry" has gotten confusing, so I am just going to refer to him as the Viper. Except, damnit, that sounds like a cool nickname. I get "Chosen One" and "Boy Who Lived" and he gets "The Viper"?
Honestly Draco, dragons? Baby dragons? Three baby dragons? I know you sometimes call me a moron, but I know exactly what you're trying to do. No dragons! Baby or otherwise!
"So, the news is that this year, your husband, Draco, is traveling with you, rather than staying home to take care of your younger children. Do you think he would mind if I asked him a question?"
I'm going to ignore the strange sort of full feeling in my lower abdomen, and the mild but incessant queasiness, and start on your nightly molestation.
"DEAR MR. MALFOY! WE AT THE MINISTRY ARE DELIGHTED TO INVITE YOU BACK TO DISCUSS YOUR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY! PLEASE STOP BY TO MEET WITH US LATER TODAY AT 4PM!"
"I understand," I murmured honestly. "When I had my first few children, I was frantic to build my fortune up from enough to take care of us comfortably for my entire lifetime to enough to take care of my kids and their kids for generations to come. So I completely understand where you are coming from. That said, I now have so many kids that - realistically - it's a much better plan to use my time to ensure they all have skills they can use to support themselves so that if I should happen to die after an unforeseen disaster wipes out my fortune, they can still live comfortable lives and provide for their children."
My father chuckled. "At this rate, in 50 or 100 years, Malfoy will be the most common family name in the Wizarding World! Every third person you come across will be a Malfoy!"
I decided to do what a true Malfoy would do. Why bring your old things when you can just get new ones? So I cast a duplication charm on every photo on the wall. That's what's in those boxes. A copy to bring with us. The originals will stay where they were placed, where they belong, waiting for us to come back. I've packed a set of MMM's so we can have even more to add when we get home.
Well, I'm certain Zaire made a feast of some sort to enjoy while we relax. But the point is that we're all going to be together and doing nothing but spending time with each other. Probably around a bonfire.
Family Table: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic9CqnOCcI4&fbclid=IwAR3fuy6XRPcrZtQ8aYY02L08CFtsmgpOt_juQnFR4E6h1b4z0-sI7RltZp4
First of all, I will not condone or refuse to condone anything. I have opinions. I have opinions on the health of my husband. I have opinions on the direction I want this family to move in. I have opinions on the potential arrival of three new children for me to help raise. But - and I truly mean this with all of my heart - I will support any choice you make. Yes, even if that choice involves selective reduction or placing the child or children up for adoption.
See, he was fussing and since I was still up anyway, I just grabbed him and started walking around. Then I brought him to the ballroom and started dancing with him. Then I strapped him to me and brought him for a run.
We both relaxed a bit and got into the dance at that point, until we spontaneously sung in unison a bit later. "I'm only good at being baaaaad… Baaad…"
We migrated to the dining room, where my mother promptly blurted out 'her' exciting news to my father. He sighed and gave her a few Galleons. It seems my mother is on a roll!
Your shaft is shorter than mine by about half an inch, but it's also just noticeably wider. My favorite part is the puffy mushroom head. I *love* pulling back the foreskin and swirling my tongue around the velvety glans. Then I probe the little slit with my tongue, trying my best to get at the goodies within and - Ah! I'm thinking about the wrong thing again!
I have to tell you, between her sass and her pranks, Kisa is awesome. But, knowing she punched a kid for kissing her? She's my teeny tiny hero!
Kingsley seems just as baffled as, though much less emotional than, the rest of us. He swears the veritaserum given to Lina's father was in perfect working condition. He said he even tested it on himself and accidentally told his assistant they were attractive. Oops! The Medinas live in a fairly secluded area, her father's really the only man she's ever around, both houses near theirs are single moms with a few kids.
P.S. I don't want to deface your ancestors, just their portraits. It's not like I'm going to go throw paint at their graves or anything. I just want to destroy someone who disparaged my babies!
I’m not asking you to have another baby. You said that thing about feeling weird when I call you babe or baby, so I opened my last email calling you babe.
And then we traded jokes and danced and drank some more. When I was in the process of passing out, I know I lay down on a cushion with the two of you (the cushions were large and very plush ^_^ ), and I'm pretty sure his parents were on a cushion a few feet away, but when I woke up a little before noon, I was all alone on the cushion.
This coming weekend, we have Julia coming to the Manor to do updated family pictures. And to prepare for that, I know we have more clothing than anyone possibly needs, but we need to pick out some good coordinating outfits for all six of us as well as at least one coordinating outfit for the kids. If we don't have anything we love we may have to go shopping to pick something out.
Yeah sure, it's literally about spending a night with a lover before leaving (at least partially), but the way our kids sang it, it seemed more like an: us against the world song.
I can't believe my life. That's actually what's keeping me from sleep. I am so overwhelmed with love and sheer disbelief that this is my life. In a few hours it's going to be our first family Christmas. I am going to sit on the sofa, exhausted, wishing the hot cocoa in my mug was actually coffee, and watch my loved ones on my first ever Christmas with a real family. Tonight before bed, I got to listen to you read our daughter The Night Before Christmas. The kids and I set out fresh biscuits and milk for Santa. I had to help send a very excited Sebastian and Della back to bed a half a dozen times each. We're going to sing (me quite terribly) carols. We're going to eat way too much delicious food. How did I get here? The boy watching Christmas morning from his cupboard is going to wake up tomorrow morning smothered in love. It's too much.
Talking was apparently code for making out. It seems that River thinks things were going rather well. They had set Stella in the center of the bed so that she couldn't fall off, and then sat on the side of the bed just kissing for about a half an hour. River says he could sense that Ananda was upset about something, so he didn't even suggest taking shirts off.
Between you buggering me into oblivion before bed, and either you or Muffy getting up all night with the babies, I woke up this morning well rested, refreshed, and ready for my first ever marathon. I had breakfast with all of you, although I ate some quite different foods than you did, no one else needed to start their day with that many carbs! I left you to get our whole crew ready, I gave all of the kiddos big hugs and kisses. And then I left to check in.
Ugh, why is he always arguing with me about your penis? Harry can't take two. Harry can't think penises are pretty. Harry doesn't really have a missing gag reflex. He's being a right prick about …. pricks.
Meanwhile, the other Harry was gaping at Hermione like he certain he was seeing a ghost. We both seemed afraid all of a sudden that HIS Hermione had been killed in the war or something. But thankfully, we were wrong.
Oh, must have been a nightmare. By this point, I was directly outside the house, but I wasn't sure if I should run in the front door, to the back of the house, and up the stairs, or if I should run around to the side so that I could run up the stairs to the balcony, over all the shattered glass, and in through the now doorless entry to the game room.
In fact, you must have actually handed Jaz to Muffy because I don't recall her being in the room by that point. All I registered was you climbing into bed with me to take full advantage of my ready to go state of arousal. I promptly rolled you under me and attacked your neck, but not a vampire attack, a regular love bite attack.
I'm really excited for this next excitement coming up in our lives, this choose your own adventure business you're doing. I think I might even try a room or two once it's up and running. I have to say though, I wasn't mad because I was under the impression it was mostly safe. But I forgot to factor into account that my weirdo husband thinks about taunting sharks and booping dragons! Honestly, what am I going to do with you? It sounds dangerous to you because you might go about poking dragons in the nose?!? Have you thought about trying the adventure without taunting dangerous creatures? Yeah, I thought not.
In any case, as you said, we received invitations to the wedding of Viper and Tiger. I have absolutely no shame in admitting that I'm extremely glad that we didn't have to do a single thing to help them plan or finalize and implement their plans. You and I got to simply stay at home and enjoy our leisure time. Such as it is.
I'm also the one who passed out and almost killed us all, luckily we didn't die but I caused them to be preemies. Did you know that premature birth can be a factor in Epilepsy? Yeah, I've been scouring the internet for as much information as I can get my hands on. So obviously if it's anyone's fault, it's mine. I laid on our kitchen floor wasting precious time that the healers could have been stopping the labor or getting me magic replenishers or something.
If they didn't already think they made the right choice, after sightseeing all day I know your parents are certain of their decision to fly themselves and our brothers and sisters separately. I'm pretty sure the new sign language tutor wants to join them on the flight home. Do you think Leah will last very long? I'm worried you may have hired one that scares easily. She seemed a bit overwhelmed with us? I'm sure it will be ok, there's a difference between being trapped on an airplane with twenty-eight other people, plus elves, plus the pilot, and teaching a large, but smaller than that, group of people in our oversized Manor.
"Haz, we both needed to remind ourselves we were alive, we both had an itch to scratch, but even if I were willing to date my alternate universe godson, I think he and I are definitely much too fucked up to accomplish anything but a terribly dysfunctional relationship."
So, that's why I am wide awake when you're both sleeping, and all the little ones are asleep. I can't stop thinking about how scary it is that our grown daughter doesn't need us. But I'm humbled to my core to know that she DOES want us.
"Oh she will!" You insisted, and then promptly shared some of the fruit on your plate with her so that she would be too happy and distracted to want to come back to me.
No thank you. I will just stay in the coma if that's the case. And honestly, if I really were in a coma? Congratulations Harry's subconscious because you are hella creative. The whole men can get up the duff thing? That was some stellar imagining.
P.S. It sounds like my potion will be ready tomorrow, so maybe I'll be able to actually get out of bed for more than 10 minutes at a time when you leave. Also, even though the MANY potions Rowe has me taking to boost my magic (that I will still continue to take even after the potion made from your blood is ready) are doing their job and keeping me at a steady level of magic sufficient to sustain my pregnancy, I STILL feel like I need to drink your blood. It's probably a good thing that I was too weak to Apparate to you while I was recuperating in the White Room, and also that you've been out of bed keeping our family alive and happy while I've been confined to our bed, because I think that having you near me at this exact moment would result in another vampire attack on you...
The older a woman gets, the more likely she is to be engaged or married. Once she's engaged, a woman begins to wear a breast covering - which in this modern age usually means a plain or beaded bra. But it could also be an animal skin. Once she is married, a woman wears fully covering clothing to announce for the world to see that she is taken.
Unghhhh, why was that so humiliatingly sexy? Why was I even harder at that? Stupid stupid little dick getting hard from being shamed in front of my friends! Damn it! Now you have me saying it's little! You're in my head!
This means that the kids naturally reached you while I was still strolling down the aisle. I wonder, did you mentally wonder and fantasize for a moment that I was walking down THE Aisle toward you? I know I did. Apparently, I'm very ready to get this wedding over with and be all three HUSBANDS once and for all.
Seriously, she SCHOOLED him on how to run a better business by NOT discriminating. And just so you know, our other brilliant children were more than ready to back her up with facts, projections, and anecdotes to prove their point. IN RUSSIAN NO LESS!
Thus, I can only conclude that there is something else that is making raids in general the point of contention. Why have me give up THEM when I wasn't even on a raid last night? I was on an undercover mission - which is a completely different thing. I can see how in the past, those missions have all had a bit of a feel to them that I was taking bigger risks, but I still feel that I was able to manage the risks to the point that they were minor risks or even non-existent.
Part of my plans involve stopping in to see Kingsley today to see if he's willing to let me have some auror grade veritaserum. I told the person that I was going to require a veritaserum … confession? Interrogation? Well whatever, I told them they were taking it if they truly want me to believe them. And they were relieved that I was being so cautious. Those are my plans today, I am going to heavily question this person. Ask them a million questions and get down to the bottom of what happened. And if I get the answers that make sense, I um, I am going to bring you to the cottage and let you know everything that's happened and why.
He pouted. "Why must you ALWAYS take HOURS to shag? Why can't you just shove me up against the wall and ram into me so hard I pass out?" His hands were urging my shaft to do just that.
I chuckled and gave him a bit of a flirty grin, feeling so much better now that plans were being made to deal with my vision, should it happen to be true. "Harry and I recently threw a nice old fashioned orgy. Only reason we didn't invite you is that the last time I hinted I might like to invite you to such a party, you looked at me like I deserved to be kissed by a dementor, and so, I took that to mean you weren't interested. Ever."
You assured me that you would let me keep my safety net, and started to slowly and carefully bring me down from the ceiling and untie me. You rubbed the circulation back into my limbs, and kissed every single spot that was deliciously rubbed raw from the ropes. I saw that Charlie had made the same decision to wait for later, and was either given a ring at that point or had had his placed at the same time mine was.
I don't think I've mentioned it, but when I was talking with Kingsley and Bletchly last week I found out they closed the case for how my hair was stolen. I was a bit annoyed when I found out they hadn't told me, but I was also on edge from missing you so I may have blown things just a smidge out of proportion. The reason they didn't see the need to tell me right away is because it's not something I should have to worry about again.
You whined softly in disappointment that we were being interrupted, but were also probably very grateful that you didn't have to pull on a robe to hide the tail while pacing back and forth with a distraught child.
Wednesday night was obviously movie night (E.T. it was so good!!). George and Angelina brought Mac as usual. Poor kid walked in, breathed in the atmosphere, and immediately asked me why I hadn't called for him earlier. Oh my little buddy, this shouldn't be your responsibility! He asked his parents if he could take Thursday off to help his Uncle Harry help the new Kids. I tried to argue a bit, but George just laughed at me saying, "When our Mac gets the idea of helping someone in his head, there's no stopping him." And that was that. And then our stubborn girl heard that her cousin Mac was taking Thursday off and asked if she could take a half a day (apparently she had some exam in the morning that she didn't want to miss) to help out giving the tours and settling the Kids in. Sorry, I didn't check with you first, but I was pretty sure that between you and Elena, you would be the easier to talk into a day off of school. I figured if SHE was alright taking the day off, YOU wouldn't have an issue saying yes.
I have something called Post Partum Depression. Basically, even though I was quite ready to have the twins out of my body physically, emotionally, I guess I just never wanted to let them go. But I had to, and now I'm cranky as fuck about it.
Turning, you faced Hermione, gave her a brilliant smile, squeezed her hand, and said: "You're doing really well. I'm always amazed by your brilliance. Good luck!"
I love being a wizard! I mean obviously there are so many reasons … Eris and Orion being two of them! But being able to do the stargazing tour our way was really nice.
Laughing maniacally, I cried out: "Accio Amala!" This naturally had Amala at my side in about 10 seconds. I pointed at the complainer and commanded: "Get 'im girl!" To which she complied and he shrieked like a little girl and put far more effort into his running than he had all evening. As did a few others.
The best part of the meeting was my time with Viona. You are a little possessive of your time with her, and I don’t feel like she knows me as well as she knows you. She has two daddies! So when you guys were getting into the small print and the contract language I got her all to myself. I sang her a few songs, and she wasn’t even offended by my terrible singing. I just told her all about myself and how I was going to give her every ounce of love she deserves and she drifted to sleep in my arms to the sound of my voice. I love her so much it hurts. Oh no, here come the tears again.
Since he was busy rapidly trying to fill me in on everything I didn't know, I took the time to look through the book he'd shifted for me to see. It was the business ledger, starting from when he'd bought the place and keeping track of all the income and expenses right up until the previous night as - presumably - Orion doesn't update the book until after the place closes and he's had a chance to count everything up. As he'd just said, his earnings were astonishing and (don't tell Viona I said this) even more lucrative than River's Song AND a few of her lesser earning businesses.
Then Hermione pointed at you as imperiously. "Ron! Harry! Blaise! Take all of the children and go, right now!!!"
Almost all of the attendees were in full costume. I saw a lot of Harry and Dracos. Quite a few Lunas and wouldn't she be so pleased by that? The Bellatrixes and Voldemorts were not exactly my favorite costumes but they were certainly well executed. However, my favorite costume was the guy dressed as a Howler. He pretty much just wore two pieces of red cardboard in front and in back. It was painted nicely and certainly looked like the Howler envelopes, but the fact that he went around the room screaming at people in character? Amazing. Do NOT tell Molly I said this, but when the Howler guy went up to someone dressed as Ron and started shrieking at him about stealing Arthur's flying car? I could have just keeled over with laughter, his Molly impression was spot on!
So it was that we spent last night with Ron and Blaise at their stag do. I had my hands quite full because Oliver said going in that no matter what happened, he was certain he didn't want us to be FULLY playing around with anyone else - at least not until we're officially married and he's positive that he's not going to lose us to the charms of others - silly bunny! In any case, being the ONLY person at the stag do that was immune to Blaise's impossible to resist sex magic meant that I was kept hopping, running back and forth between the two sides of the club keeping the two of you from begging to be shagged by everyone else there!
I would have held you all night long last night for no reason at all, it's kind of one of my favorite things to do. I would have definitely held you all night for how emotionally needy you were after the events of the past week. But after finding out about your beautiful generosity? I probably would have forced my snuggles on you whether you asked for them or not!
Merlin, I am so glad I had my tablet with me in the kitchens while you two got up to shenanigans last night! No matter how lovely you felt last night Dragon, if you had somehow lost all of your money to our friends in poker you would have been even more of a bear this morning than you already were. You dislike losing money ... hell you dislike losing period. And, despite mine and Ollie's constant reassurance that your arse is fit and lovely, I believe you may have been quite upset to find out you ate four batches of biscuits while under the influence of 'brownies'!
The whole putting Oliver on the businesses for Unity and the Stables. Okay, some of our businesses are more important to us than others. We may own bits and pieces or entire businesses that we don't care about other than it being a good investment or perhaps we trusted the person running it and thought it would make a good investment. I am partial owner of WWW because I actually put up the start-up capital and throughout the years if and when there was more investment opportunity I have put up more. It's a good investment, I trust George to know what's going to work for his business, but besides the fact that my brother is the owner, I am not emotionally invested in the business. I don't need my or either of your names on the business.
Now don't get me wrong, I've gone running with you a lot lately, and you've also gone dancing with me. All in all, I'd say our exercise levels are pretty good, which might explain why we're both starting to look pretty close to our prepregnancy shape. Yes, we both have this swollen puffiness on our chests because we're nursing, but the rest of my body no longer makes me want to run screaming from the room when I pass a mirror.
From behind us, you pulled out our tails and began stretching us out, readying us for our owners' use. Starting with two fingers, quickly upping it to three, and even sneaking that fourth in eventually. I assume you were doing the same with Charlie since he was grunting and moaning away while we made an absolutely wet mess of Neville's lap. We were so good right? We shared Charlie's owner's dick and I shared my Master's fingers.
I assume this one is going to take my attempts at strict parenting just as seriously as the others do. I love that our girls are learning to be strong powerful women, but could they wait until they’re a little older and at least pretend they listen to me?
I'm really not sure if he thought this all through, and what to do if his classmates found out what he was doing. But to my surprise, he either DID think it through, or he has the ability to accept sudden criticism and embrace it without shame. Because he did one of the LAST things I expected from our quiet observer - the boy who may have been raised in a nudist household with no shame, but has STILL usually been more of a follower (with our girls being the leaders) than an attention seeker. Oh sure, he sings and dances with the rest of us, but he's NOT the one to start the giant singalong.
In the mean time, I'm looking forward to helping Donna and Dudley figure out which one of their kids has magic. My money's on the youngest - since this accidental magic is a new 'symptom,' and one would think that if it's the older ones, they would have exhibited something sooner. But we'll see.
I swear, I will drag your arse to the damn healers. I don't care if you are completely starkers, kicking and screaming, you.are.going!
"Alright... How's this? I'm not ready to fully shag anyone, but it HAS been so long since I've had anything other than my hand on me. I... I think I'd like... a blowjob?" He informed us hesitantly.
Lastly, as for the trip you want, I'll look into our options and plan something for next weekend - possibly starting on Thursday, haha. Unless we have something planned... Better yet, consult with Tabitha and find out when we have time in our schedule, then let me know when it is and I'll plan something.
Meanwhile, you (and me too, if I'm honest) were having the nearly opposite situation. It's our - well not exactly first child to graduate, but our first adopted child plus our first naturally (magically, whatever) born children graduating. We had that same bittersweet feeling of pride, but I suppose ours was tempered by the knowledge that we get to do this a hundred more times.
Because of course, why not, I like being reminded that at my heart I am actually a mean man and a terrible father. What kind of man verbally pulls away from their child when they've done absolutely nothing wrong? She could have used her own loo but she thought you might like to see Wojtek all squeaky clean and fluffy after his bath so she decided to cut out a step and just bathe him in ours. And now I'm the arsehole who decided to just call her your daughter.
As I said, my plans were going perfectly, until we heard a voice say: "Daddies, stop doing that weird thing you're doing and come with me."
I love you. I will always love you. But I honestly don't know if I can ever forgive you for this one. I thought there would never be anything I can't forgive you for, but you may have managed to find it.
I felt so bad about not posting to this story at all yesterday that I posted all four chapters in a matter of about 4 hours, lol.
"She really did!" Elena backed her up. "Although, if glares could murder, he'd be dead on the floor and have no idea what hit him!"
Oi! When I said that I wouldn't mind a little marathon shopping session, I had no idea that I was basically condemning myself to shopping for a week straight! But if I'm honest, I had so much fun that despite being exhausted, I don't even care that I've been dragged all over creation by our brood.
Here's another little tidbit I find hilarious. It seems that this dare occurred on the very first day of classes - so, Monday September 4th, and he happened to faint and be discovered as pregnant on Monday December 4th - exactly 13 weeks gone to the day (or, well, 15 because as you remember, pregnancy is counted from the day of the last period, even for those of us who don't have them, haha).
Ugh, there's just been so much stress and drama and real life getting in the way of silly nonsense. Not that everything has been bad, not even most of it has been bad. Prepping and beginning our new jobs as Professors took up a lot of time and that wasn't bad in any way, although it was stressful. Gaining new grandchildren meant traveling to other continents and sitting in hospitals. That definitely was stressful and parts were hard to deal with, but overall still fantastic.
And then we head to Unity House tomorrow evening to celebrate with them. To make sure they have a wonderful, magical Christmas. I will get to see their eyes light up when they open their presents. We will get to have a musical jam session I am sure!
When I look into your eyes, I can see all the love you have for me, and sometimes, I can even see my own love for you reflected back at me in the vibrant jewels that are the windows to your soul,
If anything, our family full of different needs would be the best place for a child who has a little something extra, we already have every specialist in the UK on speed dial!
"You want to know, how it will be, me and him or you and me? You both stand there, your wild hair flowing, your eyes alive, your mind still growing, saying to me, what can we do now that we both love you? I love you too and I don't really see,
Good thing you made reservations. I wonder if they believed you when you said 28 plus several babies? We basically ordered everything on the menu, hahahaha! Not to mention several bottles of their Bollinger Champagne.
"That's not even your job, Draco! You conduct raids and TEACH self defense. This is going to be interrogation and case building," you argued.
"Exactly," Yesenia murmured in agreement. "Which is why - even though I am happy that Lina suffered no trauma or rape - I am so very sad about the situation in general. It breaks my heart."
Then she was such a little cranky-pants on the flight home that her sleeping so much when we got home was understandable (and welcomed!) But once she caught up on the lost sleep, I expected her to go back to a more normal schedule.
I pulled out the small box I had grabbed from my vault the other day in the hopes that this would happen. "To help my ancestors find you, I present an official Potter family crest" it was the coordinating pendant with the Potter crest that I had given Elena at her ceremony, just a bit less feminine. I put it over his head, and he immediately started fiddling with it. He's part Potter already!
"Good," I stated in delight. Then I shifted so that I could slip out of bed. "I'm going to assume by your positions of submission that I'm in complete control of both of you for the day. Thus, I'm going to take full advantage of it. Just give me a minute or so to go to the loo, and then we'll get started."
It's just too much of a coincidence to not be connected don't you think? He annoyed Morgana and all of a sudden his heart is freaking out?
I am so happy they worked out. I was worried when she came of age and Blaise found her that it would ruin what he had with Ron and Mione. Instead it made all of them better. They're the reason I knew Ollie coming into our love would make us better. They were proof that love doesn't divide but multiply as long as people are honest and open and willing to put in the work.
Fucking Hell! I just remembered, your mum came in at some point while we were drunk! I think she took pictures! Oh Merlin no!
I actually had to think about it, but I came to the conclusion that what she wanted sounded interesting and worthwhile, so: Yes, I do, but ONLY if you are comfortable with it. I'll tell her you want to watch or be involved if that's what you'd prefer.
But that isn't the case for my Draco. I really thought hard about what kind of date to give my Draco on our special day. We've had so many special days over the years. Do I go big and posh and fancy for my spoiled prat of a husband? Do I just ignore the idea of a date at all and drag him to the playroom for sexy shenanigans? While I might enjoy that in theory, I wanted to do something special, remind my Draco that even nineteen years later, I do choose him again and again every day. We've had a lot of big dates, huge international anniversary trips, and SO many filthy fantasy fulfillment.
Oh! Speaking of Pansy, I think I just heard the floo, and since I'm still sitting naked in bed, I should probably get up and get dressed. Warning, YOU may not have *that* sort of relationship with her, but I have in the past, and if she comes in the room to find me naked, she's going to flirt and grope me at the very least, so while I won't play around without any sort of permission from you, I can see how it would look bad if you walked into the room at that exact moment, and yep, she's here and smirking at me cattily.
"I'm not trying to," I replied. "I suppose that I am unconsciously holding back though. I'll stop doing that now."
MERLIN!!! It's been far too long since the last time I got to truly fulfill my sharing and voyeurism kinks! Strangely enough, you'd think that any threesome between us would fulfill them, but I suppose that at those times, I feel that you are both MINE to the point that I'm not actually sharing you with anyone, and the voyeurism thing also tends to take a back seat to me actually participating.
Well now, weren't they just FASCINATED! I actually had to promise to go into the station tomorrow and give them a demonstration of the device, but rather quickly after that, they left. And we... every single one of us decided a nap in a big fluffy pile was in order.
And there are death eater children? How does that even work? I thought the death eaters were the ones who worked for Voldemort. How could there be children death eaters?
But here are the reasonings: While we both (and probably all you readers) agree that this family DEFINITELY would have loved that baby, sometimes, the responsible thing to do is actually choose better circumstances for a baby to be conceived. So the issue WASN'T lack of love. It was literally just wanting any and all future babies to be conceived in wanted and/or planned situations.
In this world, Harry had defeated Voldemort in the Final Battle at Hogwarts on May 2nd 1998. In the OTHER Harry's world, Voldemort had taken Harry's body away when he thought he'd killed him, and declaring Harry dead (witnessed by Hagrid), won the war. That had been the start of two years of torture that resulted in other Harry giving birth to two children fathered by Voldemort and having them taken away upon birth for someone else to raise.
"And that arse!" The first whispered, but I was standing right next to her and so could hear her every word.
Robards did the actual speaking: "Witches and Wizards, if you could all please calm down. We have everything we need to resolve this case. As you can see," (they actually played Ollivander's memory for everyone to see, using a device I didn't know about that can project the memory against a wall like a movie. This will help me when I get around to tinkering with that memory camera you suggested.) "Draco Malfoy very clearly WAS attacked and defended his life and those of his two daughters from murder. This is not a crime in our world, and there was absolutely no malice or criminal intent in Mr. Malfoy's mind. Thus, he is not being charged with anything and is being released to rejoin his family."
Our son is moving! He's going to the other side of the world! He won't have us to help him, I am so distraught - I can't handle these emotions.
So now, we're talking a group loo break before heading off to the next place. I've given up caring that a girl cast a glamour on (presumably) her boyfriend to sneak him into the loo with her. They are more than likely sharing the same stall at this very moment, but as I said, that's on them if they forget to cast the protection spells. Maybe one of the female chaperones in there will notice if the stall starts shaking rhythmically and put a stop to it.
I truly feel for her as a victim of rape, and I know that everyone deals with their own trauma differently, but wouldn't you think that her priority would be getting her child away from her rapist? Don't you think she'd be more concerned with filing those charges so that Gavin could go home with her and not have to be near Lucius? Something is really fishy here. I think it's time to lawyer up. Not that I don't think Lucius should financially support his child regardless of where he lives, but I think we need some assurance that whatever happens is what's best for Gavin.
Oh my love, my sweet silly dragon, my heart. You are the worst evil villain of all time. You either tried to figure out the least painful ways for him to die, or you came up with overly dramatic plans. You were trying to give an old gay wizard a shiny cursed necklace? You thought about training an attack spider? Give him wine with a slow enough death that he would have time to get to an antidote? Remember that time you bullied me by drawing a picture of me, folding it up into a pretty bird, and then blew it to me like a kiss? Oh my Draco, remind me to never let you plot our revenge schemes.
What do most parents want from their kids? Or at least I assume they do - I wouldn't actually know being raised with house elves. But chores, right? Parents want their kids to do chores such as clean their room, wash some dishes, and vanish the trash. SO, if we market these non wand devices to kids themselves, they might just be a goldmine market. The slogan can be something like: "Kids, tired of your parents nagging you to do your chores? Well now you can do them all at the push of a few buttons!" And how are parents going to argue with that? The chores are getting done and the parents didn't have to nag, hahahahahaha!
We are going to start with a nice quiet hike, and a lovely dinner date just the three of us. I already made the reservations; a beautiful beachfront restaurant with an extensive menu and great reviews.
Alright alright! Mind on my family! Focus on getting the littles to bed... Good thing I'm pacing anyway because I think Morgana must be teething or having a growth spurt, because she is FUSSY right now. Maybe she's coming down with something?
Yes... after another bit of extensive research - sped up exponentially by Hermione and her ability to find information in mere seconds - I've confirmed that QAL is not just a contraceptive herb, but also rather effective at rendering the potion useless. See, even an inferior potion would generally override basic contraceptive measure - such as a spell. For example, Farrah and Orion. HOWEVER, this particular herb interacts with a fertility potion so strongly that it basically renders it impotent. Pun sort of intended.
Don't worry! She's fine! And if the thing I think happened actually happened and it's the result of the thing I think it is - she's actually going to not only be fine but better than she has been. Sorry, that's a crazy run-on sentence that even my two Harry-Mumbling translators probably couldn't figure out. Basically, I think I figured out Ren's sleeping problems. So I called Rowe to set up an appointment for this afternoon to test my hypothesis.
So after the three of us watched our kids graduate earlier, the two of you sobbing shamelessly while I tried my best to remain dignified (but apparently failed at least a little, ugh) - I had my hands full of babies but I could feel the two of you holding hands behind my back. For Oliver, it's his last child reaching this huge milestone, and he'll probably only have a few months to possibly a few years at most before his both leave the nest for good. I can understand him weeping with both pride and a bittersweet wistful longing for the 'good old days.'
Girly had also looked him up and down, but she must've seen him before, because all she said was: "You've filled out." She then turned back to her reflection. "Try using that stuff the Chief brought. It smells SO bloody good! You're sure to pull the entire club if you smell like that."
"Hmm..." I harrumphed lightly. "Well, since you actually are 18 as of today AND already living on your own half a world away from me, I'll not make a fuss, but forgive me for being a little concerned about you."
I'm not the only one concerned about my students though. Robards has taken steps to ensure that they're all being monitored by security spells when not on duty, and paired up with senior Aurors when on duty. So, for now, we have to believe that everyone is safe.
P.S. I know what you mean about how absolutely hilarious it is when someone turns bright red from embarrassment. One time, this boy was trying to flirt with me by being obnoxious, and then he got turned into a ferret! When he turned back into a (fucking fit) boy he was SO red!
Strangely, when I was leaving, having been dismissed from our beloved dictator's presence, I paused to look back at her and saw her rubbing her temples and grumbling under her breath something along the lines of: "First Ethan and now dad; what's next?"
You were so groggy that Z was well aware something was wrong, and he wasn't willing to take the chance that she'd hurt you. He gave her a very serious face, pointed to me, and said "Daddy first!" He called me Daddy! Draco, he hadn't done that before. I mean, I know how attached to me he is. I think he's finally understanding that I love him. But up until this point he hasn't called me anything. So now Rowe is amused at our drama, Zaire is impatient, you're half asleep, and I'm crying. It's like the beginning of a terrible joke! When I nodded at her, she shot the spell at me that she knew would light up! And light up it did! My abdomen glowed that beautiful golden light that lets anyone watching know that I am pregnant.
Ugh, I will be patient, I want all of those fun things to start already but I also want everyone to be rested enough to have fun.
made sure he didn't ever hurt anyone else, I know you wanting Eris to come forward with evidence and testimony was all coming from a place of love and care. But his behavior is HIS responsibility. When you literally asked her if she wanted that on her conscience? She was just traumatized, her body used against her will, and that message told her she was to blame and would be partially to blame for any further rapes this monster perpetrated in the future.
"And this is my fiancée Pearl," Hazel stated, holding hands with the young woman who looked familiar or some reason. I raised my brow in surprise.
Well, with the meeting more or less concluded, Robards told me to give him a few days to think things over a bit more, and maybe come up with a plan. Meanwhile, he wants me to do as I suggested, and give the female Aurors - especially my former students - any tech I deem useful; tweaking it if necessary first.
I love you, you stupid infuriatingly perfect man. Do you know how hard it is to be married to you sometimes? You're fucking perfect. You're beautiful, and brilliant, you are a master with finances, you organize businesses in a way I can't even organize my socks. You have an unending supply of love for our children, you're patient and loving. Every single person who lays eyes on you wants you, and here I am selfishly trying to keep all of that to myself. Do you have any idea how hard it is to be madly in love with someone who you feel inferior to in every way? I couldn't keep a singleton pregnancy long enough to have her full term, but you take care of our entire family while pregnant with twins. I couldn't handle a day of Auror training, and you're singlehandedly solving some of their hardest cases with no training whatsoever. Oh, and that's not enough, you have to solve muggle cases as well.
Feeling rather heavy in spirit, I decided to return to the Manor and type this up before passing out. I assume that you'll have time to read this email before coming to the Manor tomorrow for that thing. I'll leave it up to you to decide if you want to wake me alone to talk things over, or if you want to talk everything over with Oliver FIRST, and then come wake me to talk it over again.
Viper allowed his Polyjuice to wear off during the interrogation, but Tommy and Bellerophon maintained their disguise so that if any of the Aurors happened to be members of that group that once repeatedly tried to kill them, their identities were safe.
Fine! This time I mean it! I'm stopping, I'm stopping, stop poking me with those icicles you call toes Oliver!
Thus, you and Oliver more than likely returned to our bedroom right about the time I normally wake up only to find me missing. At that point, I hadn't even woken up enough to send you an insta-owl letting you know where I was, but I was running about a quarter of the school around the Quidditch Pitch. Then I led the kids through stretching and blocking drills.
Lucky for Sammy but unfortunate for our vault, she's probably going to be the recipient of my excessive stress shopping.
That was our day. It was long - and kind of fun - but mostly, I just hate that you weren't there to completely boss me around and tell me my decisions for designing our quarters were "utterly plebeian Harry!" Hopefully you're available to magi-skype and I'll at least get to talk with you face to face soon.
"No, I'm not Draco, your husband is in the back bedroom. I'll just stay out here and wait for Oliver to come get me."
Honestly, the second we realized what it was, you were practically apparating to Erma’s house or Ginger’s office to get it away from your baby.
I feel like I say this every time we take a trip with just us, but I love that it's just us with the only extras being our child wrangling staff as well as Sirius, Teddy, and *Sammy.* Is that selfish of me? It's not that I don't love our friends and our additional family members, but sometimes it needs to just be us. I have a really hard time wrapping my head around loving our extended family unconditionally but also knowing that I love you and our kids more than the others. How does that even work? There are no conditions on my love for our nieces and nephews, but I also could rank people I love in order of most love and this family of ours would top my list.
I will admit to being so very proud of you, because instead of turning your anger on Oliver for interrupting us, you took a deep breath, and then said: "Vanessa, when you're in the midst of what feels like uncontrollable rage magic, start by taking a few deep breaths and giving yourself a moment to think about what you are actually doing."
Being committed to doing anything or everything that makes me happy does not extend to having a child you don't want to have. I agree with all of those reasons your anxiety-ridden mind came up with as to why having a baby would not be the best idea.
Yes, this revelation came to me while I was in the Crystal Room, so since I was there anyway, I did a bit of smashing, and then a bit of maintenance meditation. Then Oliver came home and the two of us satisfied his unreasonable pregnancy horniness - Note: Unreasonable=perfectly reasonable and utterly enjoyable.
He touches her occasionally, and other times he sits near her talking or singing to her without touching, and sometimes I can see him walk up to her and then immediately walk away. And the more I watch Guinnie's more questionable behavior, the more I realize it comes from her having absolutely no control over anything. She freaks when people touch her despite her making mad faces or crying, she loves being in your arms because that's always been her safety net, she likes being in my arms because she can have as much milk as she likes. And I think she likes when Atreyu spends time with her because he really seems to understand what she wants or more importantly what she doesn't want.
"I still think he's barmy for doing that voluntarily, but I can see that he's keeping them healthy and happy," Robards said, wiggling his fingers in front of Morgana's nose. She predictably stopped babbling to glare at him. The entire room grew dimmer until he was smart enough to pull his hand back and shake his head with a huff of laughter. "Still doesn't like others, I see."
So, my first instinct was to of course ask 'Mione about pregnancies. But I thought you didn't want to tell anyone until we were past a certain stage? I know she won't spill the beans, she didn't tell anyone about Viona, but I didn't want to tell people without you. If you don't mind her knowing before anyone else then I will be asking her to do some research for me. I'm going to justify making her work by saying that she loves a good research challenge, but mostly I am just a lazy researcher and want the answers handed to me in her pretty handwriting and color coded!
Hell, if anything, I think you’d be upset to find out we haven’t been shagging or touching because of my misplaced guilt. Sorry?
After waking up on Thursday morning, *with* Viona - weren't you surprised? I've been telling you that with Eris not letting me sleep more than two hours at a time, I'm actually up in the mornings around 8ish. Bleh! It's *not* something I relish, but on days when we have so much to do, it's rather nice.
I honestly can't decide what emotion I'm feeling about it. Relief to no longer be the tops of the lists. A little offended that they ousted our perfect fiance. Or weirded out by the idea of anyone finding my little brother attractive. I think I'm just going to stick with over-all horrified.
Okay, I know I'm being unreasonable. I just miss you! And your email quite got my hopes up, when you said the Russian contingent told you to send the girls "home with Leah" for a moment I thought that meant they were coming HOME ... not back to Grandmama's house. When I finally caught on and realized what you had said it was like being hit with all of you leaving all over again. I had to cry into Ollie's lap.
I have to apologize all over again, I really think that my last email was a product of post pregnancy hormones. I got frantic and panicky that Morgana was crying and accused you of something that I logically KNOW would never happen. You love OUR babies SOOOOO much. You'd never harm a hair on any of their heads!
But lest you wonder about the waste of alcohol, don't worry, there wasn't all that much to begin with, and so, it's not a great loss.
I'm feeling so well rested! I got to fly before bed and then sleep the entire night through. I can't remember my last full night's sleep.
Ok I think I have hidden from the terrifying not-yet-ten-year-old for long enough. I mean, gotten enough work done. So I'll head home now.
There in the back, next to and mostly hidden by a large garbage container, was a girl. She was on her hands and knees and spewing more unpleasantness onto what was already there to begin with. With a frown of concern, I cast a spell to see what was wrong. Was she sick? Was she poisoned?
Yes, I talked Lucius Malfoy into spending the evening playing muggle board games with his children and grandchildren. No, I can't believe it either.
But moving on. You say Elena has a crush??? I'm going to have to have a subtle chat with her in which I look deeply into her eyes, and don't you dare warn her!
Shite, gotta go! Just heard Lily and Caelum whisper something about tickling and "that might wake Daddy."
Draco is so very proud of Oliver, and then Oliver and Harry spend time with the older kids while Draco deals with something.
I don't know why, but yes, I do feel love for her. I want to be like a father to her, but I *also* want to be like a good friend that CAN freakin' flirt and have inappropriate conversations without being accused of wanting to shag the bloody hell out of her! I DO NOT WANT HER! And as for why I get so jealous and snarly when it comes to River and her, I don't understand that either, except for that I feel protective of both of them and simply want them to bloody fucking STOP!
Then we went to check on the preparations, Narcissa was busy setting up the area we were going to use for the small party after the ceremony, and as usual everything was flawless and ahead of schedule. So, we headed out to the North Lawns where Arthur and Lucius were setting up the site.  They had already set up the altar and were busy cleansing and consecrating the area. I would normally have been worried to leave those two alone and unattended, but they were working like a well-oiled machine. I shouldn’t have underestimated them, they are aware of the importance of the ritual and would do nothing to sabotage their granddaughter’s happiness.
P.S. It's actually a bit weird when you call me babe or baby, but even though half of me wants to protest, the other half melts. It's baffling!
Alright, I know that you can't tell how long it takes me to write an email, or whether or not I take breaks, but I feel I should tell you that I just took a rather long break simply to breath and stop from panicking over the previous paragraph. You're not in here at the moment, so maybe I really am dreaming...
"You sound rather intelligent and honestly, I'm surprised that you're willing to tell me any of this," I said, because she almost sounded like she was talking about someone else. Someone that she didn't have to care too much about.
Sort of immersion learning, as Saoirse and Rhys taught all our kids over the years. And by the way, NO you may not fire them. I love them almost more than I love my own parents! And don't you *dare* tell any of them I said that!!!
The three littles took a nap together on the lawns? Please tell me someone got pictures! I am missing everything! And then you had all three of them crammed on your lap for a big snuggle? Aww, I bet it was the sweetest thing! I can't wait to see you with your arms full of our children! What do you think the bubbles will look like? I will love them no matter what, but seeing as we have a big-brown-eyed baby, wouldn't it be sweet if we ended up with one green-eyed and one grey-eyed? Like a whole set!
In more recent examples, Oberon has parents who - while having kicked him out at the worst time of year - are still legally HIS parents. In order to adopt him, we'd have to either convince them to give up their legal rights OR fight a potentially long and hard legal battle with them. I am confident that we would win, but I'm not certain that would be the best for Oberon. Can you imagine how it might feel to know that after being kicked out, his parents fought hard to keep him, but then were forced to give him up due to us having FAR better lawyers and more money to fight with? Perhaps save this discussion until summer hols and see if his parents have changed their minds yet, and if not, how he feels about us then. If he's ready to accept us as his family at that point, let's get it done.
Oooh, while I was writing this, I got a notification that you emailed me! So I am off to check that and I have to assume I will see you soon!
Now she's asleep, drooling on your head a bit, I should probably move her. And you're still asleep. So I will type ... something. I'm not sure what to say to help.
Anyway, as I predicted, I returned before you were fully finished changing. You'd gotten into a pair of denims, a sort of ratty old pair that wasn't as distressed as the ones that show off your lovely bum, but still not anything I would have picked for you or me. It was apparently after you'd taken your top off but before you put a tee shirt on that Viona decided on a dress and insisted you help her into it, so I found you half naked - so to speak. I felt not love or lust at the sight, but pure attraction. I suppose that I don't have to have emotions to want to shag you into the nearest bed.
"Sure thing love. Oh! Can you PLEASE put your no longer starving to death cheetah in her impossible to escape yard while you're gone. I logically *know* she probably won't hurt us at this point (she's practically slept in our bed the last few days) but I can't help but think that she's only waiting for you to stop paying attention to her for a few minutes so that she can get rid of the rest of us and have you all to herself.."
We did those pictures, some absolutely ridiculous costumed pictures, and before we knew it we were getting into our more traditional wizarding wear for the big family pictures. River took some with his grandparents while we rocked the babies to sleep. In theory I would have wanted Eri and Ori to be awake for these group shots, but it was past their naptime, and we were cramming a lot of people into one big portrait. I think calm, sleeping babies in our arms would make for a better picture than two overtired cranky babies. We may have been able to get away with an overtired Orion, but I know Eris was probably five minutes away from a meltdown when she finally fell asleep.
We are less than two weeks from end of term. Finals are happening starting this Thursday. What have these students spent the last nine or so months doing? I can promise you it isn't studying! It's like they had no idea finals would ever happen and they're panicking. I can give the little ages a pass because maybe they're not as used to the finals process, but sixth years? Sixth years! Apparently they were surprised by the tests that happen annually.
WHY in the buggering hell did it take TWO bloody hours to buy FOUR instruments? Well, it's because none of us had the slightest idea what instruments they might actually like. So..... We bought them each a full set and took the time to engrave each set with their names, trying to match colors to favorites whenever possible. Also, Viona insisted that we buy each set of instruments its own pouch - a magic one where each instrument when shoved into the opening of the pouch is spelled to automatically shrink down and go to it's official place so that it's not just rattling around in there getting banged up.
I am not mad at you that your self worth seems to make you question our devotion to you and our family.
But that will take *years* to implement, even if I bought it all today, so it's not likely to come up again in conversation for a while.
I can't do this anymore! I'm coming home! Ok, I'm not coming home. But I really want to. It's been a week. An entire week without your arms around me. An entire week waking up alone!
Oh Merlin and Godric! You want *my mother* to see me in a tiny and adorable form?! Alright, fine... I'll go talk to her about that in a minute. But *only* because you make a valid point about Viona reacting badly, but I might have to say no to any and all photos. I mean can you imagine how embarrassing that would be if one of our friends came over and saw the photo on the wall and asked when we brought Viona to the Zoo and how in the buggering hell did we manage to talk the staff into letting us get photos of the animals with her? MERLIN!
If I can't have fun doing everyday things with my family, then I picked the wrong family! What isn't fun about attempting a giant art project, making a terrible mess, and giggling like crazy with some of the best humans I know?
Insanely, they forgot that you are you, and tried to force/Imperius you into stealing a lot of money for them. The only smart part of their entire plan was that you - having access to all our vaults (at least, the non dark ones) - would actually be able to get in and empty them all without committing an actual crime. YOU wouldn't actually be stealing anything, but rather 'voluntarily' giving it all to them.
I went in to see Kingsley again this morning. I figured I would tell you all about it while we worked out, but then I figured I would be working on regulating my breathing while running, so this might be the better option.
Oooh, should we place bets on Pansy's baby fever? So far, it's taken Viona to get her to warm up to babies at all. Now Roderick and Bianca are warming her up to the idea of having her own. And I bet you her Goddaughter being born will turn up the heat and she will go full baby fever! I'd be willing to bet that she's pregnant within two months of Eris' birth.
The two of us let Elena and Muffy keep an eye on Viona - who also delighted in an opportunity to find chocolate - while we sat near the refreshments. You were eating a bowl full of watermelon chunks, and I was eating pate and caviar on sourdough rye crackers with a bowl of gravy to dip them in. This apparently seemed like an excellent opportunity for everyone who wasn't participating in the hunt to come over to you (well, both of us, but mostly you) to talk about how close you must be to giving birth. Whether it was a boy or a girl. Do we have any names picked out? And by the way, thank you SOOOO MUCH for defeating the Dark Lord. Is there anything you need? Is there anything they can do to thank you?
"I'll do my best," I promised as I kissed her hand. Then I grabbed Alric and pulled him closer so that I could kiss him on the cheek. "Congratulations on surviving the first night, and hopefully, you'll continue to survive until you're old and grey."
I had first and second years today for the two classes I sat in on. The little firsties are so cute I could just die. Were we ever that small Draco? Carrying around books that are practically half their size. Their teeny tiny little robes making them look like toddlers playing dressup in their parents clothes. Asking the most adorable questions. Luckily I've had a lifetime of fielding what seem like insane questions about Muggle life from Arthur. What's the function of a rubber duck indeed!
I really hope not. Whenever those that we've lost come to my mind, I like to push all of my love and thanks out into the universe. I hope they can feel it. I like to think my parents can feel it like a big emotional hug. That Fred can hear my laughter. That Lainie's parents can feel how humbled and thankful I am for having her in my life.
I'm going to watch you sleep until I feel sleepy again myself. Happily, I'm up to about six hours of awake time now. Unfortunately, it seems to be a twice a day thing where I'm awake for about 6 hours in the afternoon, then I go to bed and sleep for about six hours, wake up for six, sleep for six, and so on. I think my body's just not comfortable staying asleep for a normal amount of time because Eris makes everything ache ferociously.
Any time you want to be right here, just imagine me and all this will appear, you can keep this moment all your life, forever near, a dream worth keeping,
Cheer up, Rowe will have plenty of potions safe for pregnancy that you can take to clear up that cold in no time. Unless you are simply using the cold as a way to get out of something you don't want to do, which would explain why you haven't taken some potions for it already.
I told her that I'd taken care of that this year for the entire school, and she not only laughed, but also hugged me tight and congratulated me on having the bravery to potentially embarrass myself in front of the whole school like that. Apparently Rowe's granddaughter had sent an owl asking for a time to chat, and based on the timing, she's certain that the chat is probably going to be on that topic.
Erm... I'm going to be in the bathroom if you need me. My routine for today is going to be EXTRA thorough...
However, at some point your body must have gotten the memo that you were holding a fit guy in your arms. I heard a softly whispered "Harry," and thinking you were just trying to quietly call me, I responded with "Yes Love?"
I frantically ran to my computer, assuming that if you had gone off to pretend to be an auror or rescue a troop of rabid monkeys you would have emailed me. Well, I did have an email from you, I did a quick skim to the end to see what your sign off was. Color me surprised when you said you were going to take a bath, and as far as I know no one heard from you after that bath. Off I popped to the tub, and there you were, sound asleep, soaking wet, covered in bubbles. Thank goodness for warming charms and safety charms to keep you from drowning.
If we hold on together, I know our dreams will never die, dreams see us through to forever, where clouds roll by, for you and I,
I know we give them an allowance and would be perfectly happy to financially support them for the rest of their lives, but I also recognize the value of giving them enough money to either invest and increase (like I did) or make mistakes with. Obviously, I'm hoping for the first one, haha. I also know that we each have a fortune to split amongst them, but we also sort of keep our fortunes separate - probably so that they can't BOTH disappear should the economy happen to plummet and all my businesses run dry at the same time.
"The demon would murder a little old lady for some good quality red right about now," I informed you.
Thus, when I noticed Zaire grimace and rub first his lower belly, and then itch his butt as subtly as possible, I was fairly certain that he had to go to the bathroom. This concerned me because ever since he arrived at Unity Africa, he's had a case of constipation. The caregivers say that part of it was probably extreme reluctance to perform an act that could hurt or remind him of previous hurt since they'd healed him. The other part was that he was so malnourished that his body probably assumed that it needed to hang on to every bit of nutrients it had.
"Otherwise it never happens," I grumbled. "And even the spell doesn't feel right. Bottoming is fine, but even then, it feels a bit like my prostate has gone numb."
"I... I appreciate you telling me, and I WANT to return the favor, but I'm afraid that... well... I'm surprisingly old fashioned, and I'm getting too damn old to settle for less than everything I want. As much as I want to be with the both of you, I want to be MARRIED. I want to be with someone who wants to be a family with me..."
Since we have a big day on Saturday and you've had a busy week with all of your classes, I'd really really really like it if you'd do me a favor and get some rest the next few days.
She was naturally the Vampire, haha. She had a few students of all ages/backgrounds doing parts of their own performances as she walked through them, sort of unseen as she watched them all celebrate. As she did this, she sang to herself a song about how lonely it is to be a Vampire during such a happy time of year. Then she chose a victim to eat.
"She might also use a temporary silencing charm until you've learned your lesson and apologize via a sincerely hand written letter," Sev added, stroking his chin in thought. "And you are lucky - young lady - that you are not in Hogwarts yet, for I would have been obligated to deduct about 40 house points from you."
Can we just go home today? I know, we were going to stay until tomorrow, we even put ourselves down as tentatively checking out Sunday instead. Just in case we wanted to extend our honeymoon a bit longer. After yesterday's trek through the tundras of Narnia, I think I'd like to be out of the snow and settled in at home. I'd especially like to get Draco to Rowe's to get him checked out.
I nodded in agreement. "But we want to make it clear that YOU don't need to feel pressured. If you still need more time, or if you don't feel the same, we'll understand."
We’re leaving today! We’re leaving today! I’m so excited I could throw up! Is it 2:00 yet? Maybe I’d be more relaxed if I had been the one who got a full body massage last night!
But as I was saying, since I had very little to do today, once I finished with Rory and Nate (brothers not lovers, hahaha), I wandered the area around the part I own just off Diagon. As it turns out, there's an animal equivalent of Unity House not too far away. Just a couple of blocks over. They take in animals from the other shelters - animals that have been up for adoption for a while and are scheduled to be euthanized. This place takes them, tries to adopt them out, but otherwise cares for them until they either find a forever home or die of old age. As I understand it, there are also a precious few homes around the country that take in certain breeds of dog to care for, sort of sharing the burden of this place, but sadly, there is ALWAYS *far* more animals in need than there are homes willing to take them in.
I got all squeaky clean, even had a bath with the littles, and then had a wonderful breakfast with everyone but you, my lazy boy! I'm teasing of course, if my body would have let me sleep in any later I'd still be in bed too! Stupid internal clock.
Harry, there is a demon inside me and it *demands* fermented ginger, avocados, and sashimi. I couldn't keep anything at all down this morning until Muffy brought me a small bowl of fermented ginger slices, and then suddenly, I *needed* sashimi smothered in avocado with a little sea salt and pepper. And milk! I may have drank the entire cow!
So with our orders clear, I deployed my Aurors in waves, with the Ward Specialists going in first. I went with them to toss out my mapping drones and ensure that they were sending perfect signals to my magi-tablet. Once the Aurors and officers arrived, the situation was a rather simple one. We just slightly outnumbered the brawlers, and they weren't expecting us, so we were able to take the majority of them down quickly.
A bit uncertainly, I looked over at you. You were staring at my face, which you came over to caress.
Eventually, I realized that I was hearing something and stopped to look. That's when I found a cage in the corner of our room containing a new pet. I had to ask Muffy because I had no idea what this half rabbit half guinea pig looking thing was. As it turns out, at 25cm with another 10cm of tail, weighing maybe half a kilogram and having gorgeous blue/gray fur - the softest fur you've ever felt!
We walked away and I felt myself calming down. When we were no longer able to see that scum, and were in the relative privacy of the shade outside a book store, I stopped and pulled Viona into a hug.
Yeah. One. Our daughter is one day old. A single day old. Your husband just had a human surgically removed from him. You have family coming in from all over the globe to meet our newest daughter and you won't be here. She's been born and she's already old news. Serenity is SO yesterday, I'm already bored, off to another universe. I know it's hard for you to keep your mind still or stay on something for longer than a moment or two, but she literally still has vernix in her fat little neck rolls and she's already moved down on your list of important things.
It's not that I never noticed any of the nude paintings in the Manor, but I guess I didn't realize quite how many there were. And I don't really spend much time in the room Snape and Sirius were fighting in. It wasn't until I was reading your description of the fight that I realized every portrait in there had some naked Malfoy lounging about. Mmm, naked Malfoy. Mmm, my naked Malfoy. Naked and lounging on some settee, letting me kneel at his feet and feed him grapes. Letting me put my head in his lap while he pets me like a good boy.
"When you were here before, couldn't look you in the eye, you're just like an Angel, your skin makes me cry, you float like a feather, in a beautiful world, I wish I was special, you're so fucking special, but I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo, what the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here -"
I was completely unwilling to wake either of you, as much as I want to talk with you and see those quicksilver and molten chocolate eyes I've missed so much, I'm sure the both of you are in dire need of good sleep too. So, as soon as I awoke, I shot one of those bloody uncomfortable bladder spells at myself, sat up as best I could without moving either of you very far from your perch (you're heads are now resting in my lap instead of my chest), and summoned my tablet so I could write to you.
In any case, I'm going to sign off, give little peanut back to her anxious father, and finally return to our bed where I hope to snuggle up to my loves.
Fine! We probably should continue to live in the world we’re so invested in! But I stand by my belief that England’s weather is stupid and we should try moving our island and its weather to England.
And I know you pretended to be a scrooge about it, but not only were your children lit up with joy at how fun they found these ridiculous clothes to be, it also turned into a giant family sing-along. And we all know how much you love a big family sing-along.
So... after pacing my closet and stroking my Komboloi for at least an hour as I've read, reread, and mentally argued the possibility presented in your email, I've decided that I can and will make this decision for you. You clearly want to go, and it will be beneficial for so many young lives that... I'm ordering you to go talk to YOUR Mind Healer to prepare yourself for this massive undertaking. Because as I was saying before I got on a tangent, this is the absolute best time to do this. We have a little over a year before Elena goes to Hogwarts, and that should be plenty of time to get Unity Africa up and running so that we can come home in time for her to catch the Hogwarts Express and get sorted into - Ravenclaw, more than likely.
She looked like she was simultaneously trying to hide under the ground AND beam in pride. "Thanks dad! See you later!"
Today, everything is right with the world. Or at least here on the beach in Cape Town. I'll admit that yesterday wasn't my finest day. I succumbed to my rage and severely beat up a few men who had tried to prey on our daughter - along with her sister and cousin. As I beat them, I looked into their eyes because I needed to know why they thought this was acceptable behavior, and I quickly realized that they were drunk.
Erm, Harry? WHY did you reverse Apparate or banish or whatever you did our baby to me without coming with her? Was she upsetting you or something and you needed some space? She seems a little fussy to me, but not so bad as to be banished...
And everyone wanted to ask me how I thought they did during their performances last night. I didn't tell any of them, but my favorite was also Lainie's performance with the littles. I cannot believe she got that many toddlers to follow along with her to do "Do Re Mi" from The Sound of Music! Ok, maybe I can believe it, our girl can do anything she sets her sights on! And little Matilda falling asleep on her lap mid-song? Can it get any more adorable than that?
