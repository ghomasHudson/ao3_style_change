She hooted and flew across the room towards her perch near the end of his declaration.
When it came with a shout of “Holly Heads would never-!” He pulled the cord.
Harry couldn’t help but grin under his hood.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Good. We’re leaving in fifteen minutes.”
Harry, though he admitted he knew Lupin, would not volunteer any information about the Omega. When Draco grilled him, he’d answered, “he’ll tell you when he’s ready.”
Draco groaned. “That’s hard.”
‘Then how do you know all this?!’ Draco demanded to know.
‘I will.’
Draco stood with behind the low fence that separated the day-care part of Myrion from the school, watching as Adelaide sat down next to two other Omegas. She started chatting with them. Draco couldn’t hear what they were talking about, but Adelaide seemed to be at ease and that was what was most important.
With a flick of the guard’s wand, the man’s hands and ankles got chained to a pole anchored in the ground next to the fireplace. The man was pulled forward uncomfortably, falling to his knees and grunting as it happened. Draco now understood why Remus was on the floor.
Draco blinked. “What about Harry?”
“It’s lotsa’ fun, y’know.”
He found himself craving for Harry’s presence more and more, practically jumping at the Alpha when he came home.
Draco counted in his head. “Six left, I think.”
While Draco took a moment to catch his breath, Harry pressed his lips to Draco’s neck, lightly kissing their bond mark and pressing his hips against Draco’s again.
With a sigh of indecision, he lifted the laundry hamper and left the room.
“Where do you think Remus lived before he came here?”
“Do you think it is possible to get our heat visits back?” Sirius’ tone was low and careful, as if he was afraid about breaching the subject with Draco.
“I want to sign it,” Draco said for the fourth time that day.
And then Mr Potter left.
Feeling that they were crossing into dangerous territory - they had hardly discussed Harry’s position at work at all, but Draco imagined that there would be an end to his extended leave at some point - Draco murmured, “I like having you at home with me. It makes me feel safe.”
He dressed in light clothes, soft cottons that didn’t hurt his oversensitive skin, and used the stupid donut pillow Bella had given him when they sat down in the kitchen.
When they entered the Leaky Cauldron to pick up Remus - but not before picking up a tub of mocha ice cream at Fortescue's - Remus was still sitting in the dark corner, now joined by a third figure.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t think that is what you really want,” Draco countered as gently as he could. “You love Sirius.”
Draco slipped out of Harry’s embrace quickly and grabbed Adelaide’s hand. ‘We understand. Come on, Adelaide.’ They left the kitchen quickly, leaving Harry to discuss matters with Molly, as was the standard when steps like these were taken in courtship.
There was shouting, people screaming, dead bodies on the floor. Draco could barely register it over the ringing in his own ears, now cowering behind his mate and regretting his choice to leave the room.
“How old were you?” Draco asked in a whisper, wanting to hear more of the story.
‘Yeah… I’m not much one for fighting though… I like gardening.’
Robards again swiped his hand over his face, sighing. “How long?”
Harry gasped and moaned, ‘fuck, that’s…’
‘All taken care of,’ Harry answered, pressing his lips to Draco’s pulse point again and at the same time spelling away the remainder of both their pyjamas.
Draco buried his face in the crook of Harry’s neck, murmuring, “I’m glad you’re home… safe…” but by that time, Harry was already asleep.
Adelaide nodded. ‘The neighbour – I drank tea with her every Friday morning – heard some unusual noises and alerted the aurors. I don’t remember much of this because when I was transported I was still in heat, but Molly told me that one auror couldn’t keep his mouth shut and told someone at the Prophet. When I was brought here I recovered quickly though.’ She looked up to him, as she was just a hint shorter than he was, and frowned a little. ‘And then you arrived. We all thought you were going to die, Draco.’
Back home, Draco convinced Harry that going upstairs, taking a shower and getting properly dressed would be well worth his while, so while Harry did that, Draco scoured their room for things that smelled like him and Harry and collected them in a spare laundry basket. When he was done, Harry wasn’t out of the shower yet, so Draco went on to the office to look for other things.
“Play nice now, children,” Molly admonished them, making Draco chuckle, “yes mommy.”
“Yeah, it’s upstairs, in the nursery,” he said. His brain didn’t catch up on the question. It was slow, occupied by other things happening in his body and the weird-feeling, hard-to-describe tugs that had been coming through the bond in unison with the cramp and contractions all morning.
Harry immediately noted the shifted mood, and let his hand slip off Draco’s stomach, replacing it on his hip. “I’m sorry.”
“Did you read my book?” The food Harry had brought was a near perfect copy of the suggested breakfast in ‘A pregnancy guide’.
‘Don’t you think that’s a bit crude? She’s probably still heartbroken, you acting this way towards here isn’t going to better the situation,’ Hermione pointed out.
“Sure,” Harry agreed easily. “Should we get anything else?” He put his arm around Draco, pulling his lithe body a little closer. Draco happily obliged and snuggled a little closer. “Some candy, and… I’m not sure, maybe something for the house… I’d like to look around a little.”
“A little disappointed,” Harry admitted, while Draco at the same time muttered, “really fucking sore.”
‘More, more, please please please…’
‘I don’t know. It seems appropriate.’
Harry remained quiet for a while, but then batted Draco’s hand away from his groin. ‘Fine. On the bed. On your back. Be good now, or I won’t do anything to you.’
She cleared her throat. ‘You were retrieved from your parents’ house by a Ministry rescue team after an anonymous letter was send to Harry, in which it was stated you were being abused severely and needed to be taken away from there as soon as possible. Harry obviously wanted to go and whisk you away immediately, but it took a day or two to find a team that was willing to help. You see, it wasn’t easy to break through the wards surrounding your house, and it was even harder to get through the ones that protected you. Next to that, they had to break the connection between you and your Alpha, so that he couldn’t just order you to come back. I had already agreed to take care of you, of course, but I hadn’t expected you to be in such a state, oh honey, I was so scared for you…’
Mrs Weasley saved him. ‘Well, why don’t you boys sit down now, hmm, I’ll make you some tea.’
“My child,” She continued with a hitch. “Scared you can just have the run of the house.”
"It's just the last time I was here a man named Hagrid had my vault key, he'd gotten it from a man named Albus Dumbledore.. I was under the assumption that I needed his permission."
He soon came across a small section on magical disguises. Rogrig had been right that these were minor things. Most looked like they wouldn’t fool anyone, things like cheap looking false teeth and fake mustaches that’d stick to you for hours. Harry was about to go a bit mental wondering how Rogrig could think these would fool anyone when he came across a curious little item. There were only three left on the shelf, it was advertised as a party gag. It looked like a cheap Muggle confetti popper he'd seen on shelves around New Years. However with one big difference. These promised that when popped at someone their physical appearance would change for the hour. There was a moving image on the back showing how it worked, with a tagline next to it in big bold letters stating “New Year New You!”
And so it continued on like this until they got to the most recent account history of the Potter House.
He had thought they’d finally beaten this weirdness out of him. The boy was still strange but there hadn’t been any of his incidents in years. He didn't fuss like he used to, smiled when it was pleasant to do so. He was up before the sun making breakfast for them, with a refill on his coffee to boot. It was the least he could do, Vernon thought. All without that whine he had when he was littler. Yes, things had finally started pulling together again in the Dursley household. Then July came and with it all these blasted letters! The little frea-
“What in God’s name did you do to your hair!” Vernon steamrolled over Harry, and truthfully he was thankful Uncle Vernon had. Harry had forgotten about his hair, now though he found himself stuttering mentally trying to think of an excuse.
“I was just coming in from a walk Uncl-“ Harry started to say.
"Well, Heir Potter shall we start answering some of those questions you have?"
“Very good. Do it again.” and with that he took the key and turned to leave.
That didn’t mean he couldn’t play, it just meant it was more difficult. That was one of the reasons Hagrid was so refreshing. Playing the game with Hagrid was so easy, it felt like he had three decks of cards to choose from. So many options available to him. He discovered quickly that Hagrid came in with the idea that he could do no wrong, he was a hero. Too bad Hagrid didn’t have more to give him, more influence, he could play him like a fiddle.
Slipping from the loo with all the grace of an arthritic bull Harry tottled his way over to the bar shoving past patrons and growling grumpy expletives along the way.
Hood up head down, Harry exited Diagon Alley headed for the Dursleys.
“What was that sir! I really can’t hear you!” Harry said, voice wavering.

“Just a little swish and flick and I can give you the same.” He said, putting on a mischievous Cheshire grin.
The bird stared blankly past Harry once he stopped his petting but he took that as a yes and presented his vault key to her anyway. It glinted in the moonlight. She gave it a curious look and he continued.
“Vault key?” The goblin interrupted with a practiced businesslike ease, reaching out with a knobby hand.
Caught blinking rapidly looking down at his shoes away from the light. Aunt Petunia was up very early still in her sleeping clothes, a long red nightgown, her hair up in curlers.
All this and more before he finally released Tom from Harlan’s needy clutches. Harry told himself he wasn’t just tormenting the man needlessly, he was making absolutely positive that Tom would want nothing to do with Harlan after this encounter was over.
He was quite proud of himself actually no one seemed to give two shi-
Harry realized with a shutter he was trapped, she was giving him that same look she had given him last night. A dreadfully cold scowl that he hadn’t seen in years.
It was rather infuriating actually. Harry felt like he was bursting at the seams, and in a twisted sort of way he couldn't really even blame the Dursleys for not telling him the truth about his parents, about his wizarding heritage.
She was perched on the headboard of his bed, regaly watching him from above, himself supplicating below in a circle of books. Beseeching her interest.
Rogrig squinted past him dangerously leaning back in his chair with a long deliberate drag of his cigarellos.
This was killing him, he needed proper answers..
Harry mentally took a deep breath, he still had the advantage, he was the customer, he hadn’t done anything wrong. He was just being a bit rude. Tom definitely didn't just permanently deafen him.
Tom, looking relieved seemed to fall back into the motions he’d done a thousand times before. He efficiently pulled a ledger book out from under the counter with an inviting toothless smile.
“We’re gonna get set up right Hedwig… Then we’ll be ready.” He said dreamily.
“Did you think I wouldn’t notice the missing money you ungrateful selfish little boy.” She hissed lunging for Harry’s ear making pinching motions like a great big lobster.
“Uh- yes thank you..” Harry said.
“Till the first of September.” Harlan supplied.
Harry shivered remembering this morning, and kept to the same strict rules he’d used yesterday, hood up head down.
Harry found Hagrid had exited his life with the same abruptness he’d entered it. The whirlwind events of the past morning almost felt like a dream, so completely surreal he might’ve thought that was the case until he looked up and saw the owl again.
Looking up he met Rogrigs eyes briefly only for them to skitter away quickly to continue boring a hole in his desk.
Wait! Was that? No it couldn't be, he could've sworn he’d seen something on the horizon.
‘Yes – well – but – ’
Draco sniffed. ‘No, tell me.’
Draco gasped and closed his eyes again as the praise washed over him. He started to pant when Harry slowly pressed his hand inside him, trying to relax his muscles to that his Alpha could fill him completely.
Adelaide giggled, “Draco!” and Molly looked away, though Draco could see her smile.
Harry led Draco outside and into Diagon Alley, where it was even busier. He offered Draco his arm as guidance, which Draco happily accepted.
‘You could have asked me to join you.’
“I thought you knew you could trust me.”
“I know.” Harry kneeled in front of his mate, placing a warm hand on Draco’s knee.
‘Yes…’
Draco blinked, surprised. “What?”
‘Yes, sir. It is painful.’
Draco studied the screen, eventually seeing the little squares, but finding it hard to distinguish them when the images kept on moving. ‘I think I get it…’
‘Submit.’
‘That must’ve been hard,’ Harry politely answered, ‘but if you could please excuse us…’
Harry shook his head, ‘see, this is what I have to deal with on a weekly basis.’
“What about working less? Just desk work?”
Harry remained quiet, so Draco continued: “I felt like maybe my feelings...” He swallowed nervously, hoping he didn’t say anything wrong, “...my needs were a nuisance to you. You are always so busy with work that...” Draco fell silent, unsure of how to finish his sentence.
‘We should make a memorial plaque or something for them,’ Draco decided fiercely.
As Adelaide shuffled into the adjacent kitchen, she mentioned, “you seem out of it today. Everything okay?”
Once safely out of the department, Harry slid his arm around Draco’s waist. He was going towards the exit when Draco jerked to the right, in the direction of the ORO. Harry said nothing and followed Draco’s lead as he led them to Hermione’s office.
Draco stood up and tossed the test, not wanting to look at it any longer. He sucked in a deep, deliberate breath, steadying himself against the kitchen counter. “Let’s go get ice cream at Fortescue’s.” The words meant nothing, the emotion behind it, carefully hidden sadness, disappointment, the physical tiredness and soreness he still felt, were conveyed through their bond.
Harry suddenly smiled, a flash of white teeth and lips curling up to form the cheeky grin Draco loved so much. “I wouldn’t mind having kids.” He moved his hand a little, placing it over Draco's flat stomach. “I think you'd look lovely, carrying our child.”
Draco sipped from his hot cocoa. “We still haven’t seen the last one of those weird vampire films.”
Harry eventually sat down next to Draco. “I took a leave of absence.”
“Please wait here, Healer Roberts will be with you shortly,” Bella said, opening an office door and gesturing towards a comfortable looking settee. “In the meantime, can I get you anything? Coffee? Tea?”
“We cannot wait for his arrival.” Her voice was low and understanding, but also strict. “We’ll make sure he can enter the room should he arrive in time or during the procedure. Okay?”
(Also, tell me what you think of characters that are non-existent in the books, like Miss Fawley and Adelaide! Are they fun/good or do you think I should try to stick to the original characters for the most part?)
Both remained quiet as they entered the park. Draco was starting to get a little tired, and when he saw a bench, he steered them towards it. “I just need to rest for a few minutes,” he said. It felt like an apology -
Let me know what you think! I always enjoy hearing what people have to say.
More inaudible murmur.
‘A women, too,’ Draco said, feeling stupid tears escaping from his eyes.
Draco looked over to them with a smile, wondering how they would answer the little curiosity beast.
Draco got out of bed. ‘Yes.’
‘It’s fine, really.’
He could hear the chair scraping across the floor and Harry’s light-footed footsteps, before the Alpha stood next to him. ‘Oh. Right. I forgot,’ Harry said. He ran a hand through his hair. ‘Well, I guess we could buy a new wardrobe. Hermione?!’
‘We could visit Myrion in official capacity,’ Hermione suggested, sounding calmer than before and a bit more like her usual self.
‘Good afternoon,’ Adelaide greeted formally and she gave Hermione a nod – she couldn’t do more, still holding Draco, but she had noticed Hermione was an Alpha, Draco knew, because she adopted the standard etiquette for greeting Alphas. ‘Could you bring as back home, please? Draco is very upset.’
‘It’s beautiful,’ Harry whispered, ‘I had no idea it was like this.’
Oh my god, how long has it been? Almost two months? Anyway, this chapter is long overdue.
Hi there, here's another chapter! Because I definitely know how to schedule things (not), this is a Christmas chapter.
With a deep breath, he leaned forward, opening his eyes again and trying to make sense out of Lupin’s work. “What are you working on today?” Lupin’s projects varied from week to week, and he kept detailed records of what he did in his notebooks. Both Harry and Draco understood and accepted that they would not be involved in whatever Lupin was doing unless he asked for their explicit help.
I re-wrote it at least four times, so here it is, crappy or not
Adelaide giggled again.
One of the things Draco liked about her, was that she cared about both of their answers - she treated both him and Harry with respect. It was - once again - not the norm he’d grown up with. It was refreshing.
‘FINALLY!’ Hermione shouted when they returned, but she didn’t sound angry. She sounded… excited. ‘What took you so long!?’
that!’ Harry exclaimed.
Harry laughed, and for a second, Draco felt offended, until Harry added; “It’s okay, honey. You can tell whoever you like, okay?”
Harry hummed his agreement.
‘It’s moving.’
She turned. ‘Ah, Draco. What is it?’
Draco whimpered. He moved his hips against Harry’s hand, hard again, wanting to come quickly. But Harry took his time, gently stroking Draco’s cock, rubbing his fingers over his head before moving back down again to first him tightly, making Draco choke on his own breath. ‘Harry… please.’
They were quiet for a while and Draco considered pretending that nothing had happened during his last heat.
‘Good boy, you’re so good for me, Draco,’ Harry panted and Draco moaned a little from hearing his Alpha speaking like that. ‘Good boy… yes… now spread your legs.’
Draco went downstairs again, to the kitchen, where Hermione stood ready by the pensieve. Walking up to it, he started to feel more nervous.
I'm sorry that this one's a little late, life got real busy for a moment there.
Harry chuckled. ‘Alright, I’ll see you downstairs in a few.’
‘I’ll be right in the next room if you need anything,’ Mrs Weasley interrupted their awkward reunion.
“No, I’m not... not really.”  Harry came even closer and very quickly, almost shyly rubbed his cheek against Draco’s. “I felt horrified when I couldn’t find you when I woke up and I took it out on her.”
“Eight weeks,” he whispered back. “We’re waiting until twelve weeks to announce.”
tired. Can we arrange to meet and discuss everything some other day?” Tired was an understatement. He felt dead on his feet, and ready for another comfort nap in his nest. With the new plushies, of course.
“Draco?” It was Hermione.
‘He asked horrendous things!’ His mother nearly shouted.
Draco was nervous. They both were, he could feel through the bond. But aside from the nervous butterflies in his stomach, he was excited. He couldn’t wait to carry Harry’s children.
Aaawwwriightt, what do you think? Will Draco muster up the courage to tell Harry about his wishes? Do you think Harry is unaware of Draco's wish to get pregnant, or maybe he does know, and is just not ready for that?
Hermione buried her face in her hands. ‘You went through the entire Ikea?’
you need to tell me.’
He opened the wardrobe. There wasn’t really any place for his clothes. Not that Harry owned very many clothes. The wardrobe was just too small. ‘Harry?’
“I’m not,” Hermione calmly attested. “But I am your friend, as well as a qualified ORO official, so you can talk to me about it.”
‘I’m not.’
‘You’re being so good, aren’t you? Just for me,’ his Alpha’s voice cut off Draco’s train of thought and he moaned again, ‘yes, yes, yes, just for you…’
Draco cowered away from Mrs Weasley, ‘please don’t hurt me,’ he squeaked, afraid that she might do things like that, too.
“Morning, love,” Harry responded, coming into the kitchen and kissing Draco’s cheek. He let his hand slide over Draco’s ribs, to his stomach, and murmured, “hello to you too, baby.” It made Draco smile, and he turned, curling himself in Harry’s arms. “How was the meeting?”
‘It just seemed to extreme. We, for instance, I presented at a much younger age and well, everyone expected Neville to be a Beta so our friendship was okay, and it was just that, nothing more than friendship. But Augusta made it rather clear that I wasn’t supposed to visit anymore when it turned out he was an Omega after all.’
‘Just look at me,’ Harry tried.
He sighed. Being alone wasn’t really something he was great at. A glance at the clock told him he had only two more hours to go before it was an appropriate time to drop by at the Burrow. He sighed again and walked into the kitchen. The chore list for today lay on the kitchen table and he picked it up, studying it as if he didn’t do these every day.
“When the summer was over, Sirius asked me to come with him. I did. Been together ever since.” He absentmindedly placed two fingers over the faded bond mark at the side of his throat.
Remus rose from his seat without another word, and came home with Harry and Draco.
“Um…” Nerves crept into his throat, and he suddenly felt very alone and unprotected.
‘To Mr Potter?’ She looked up now, not quite looking him in the eye but at least he could see more of her face now. She was much paler than he remembered.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco looked up, a bit confused. “Hmw, what?”
Having quite some time left, he sat down in one of the many window seats that could be found in the store, and started flipping through his first pick: “Being an Omega”. It seemed to be targeted at newly presented Omegas, but then again, Draco had never had the luxury of access to these types of educational books.
‘Molly, listen, Hermione said – ’
And used that smile and even made to show his neck! That horrible, horrible man can never come near our boy again. EVER!’
‘No, no, of course not,’ Harry hastened to say. ‘I just… It’s not quite what I expected.’
‘Nooo…’ Draco moaned and he lifted his hips a bit, to meet Harry’s thrusts.
“I do. But I’m not sure if I can keep doing this.”
Draco shifted uncomfortably in his seat. ‘He ordered me to obey.’
A hand slid over his cock, fisting it firmly and at the same time, Harry moved his fist inside Draco.
Draco stepped closer to Harry again. ‘Oh. Okay.’
Harry abruptly stood up. ‘I see we can’t talk about this civilised. I should leave. I’ll pick up Adelaide and Draco at half past two.’
“I see you are every bit as feisty as you were when you were a child. Crabbe, bring him to the room.”
“I’m going, are you sure you don’t want me to bring you to the Burrow?” Harry wrapped his arm gently around Draco and kissed him quickly.
By his
“Dominate you more, as well,” Adelaide provided.
Draco looked up to read the sign.
‘Mr Potter?’ Adelaide slipped through the door. ‘Mr Potter, are you still awake?’
“I’m okay.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco shook his head. “No, we weren’t.”
Draco turned his head sideways, whining, ‘please…’ He pushed himself up on all fours, presenting his leaking arse to Harry
‘We’ve got enough evidence to let the Aurors confiscate the files,’ Hermione decided. ‘We don’t have the authorisation to do that, but they do.’ She seemed to be a bit disappointed when she added, ‘if we’ve come across a real criminal we might have transfer the case over to the Auror office.’
“I see.”
“We’ll be fine,” Harry promised as he stepped closer. He placed a gentle arm around Draco’s waist and let his hand curl around his hip, making Draco sigh and lean into his mate a little more. “You really think so?”
Draco’s feelings were conflicted. Harry was the reason why he was afraid, but whenever he was afraid, he fled to Harry. The fact that Harry and his Alpha-ness didn’t fill the room as much anymore relieved Draco of some of his fear. “I need to you stay,” he whispered, barely audible, but trying to transmit his feelings through the bond. Harry’s feelings – concern, lingering anger,
Draco felt his lips curl up in a faint smile. Having only met Hermione a few times, he had the idea that she didn’t often forget things like that.
“O-okay.” Draco looked at Harry, who seemed to be as baffled as he was. He squeezed his hand, and Harry squeezed back. “We can do twins,” he said, but it sounded like he was trying to convince himself as much as Draco.
Harry wrapped his arm around Draco’s waist and pulled him a little closer, murmuring something Draco couldn’t quite make out, but that didn’t matter, he could feel how Harry felt through their bond.
Draco suppressed a smile; no need to show Harry how it felt to win a discussion.
It made the stranger frown. “I thought your parents had raised you better.”
take measures.’
Draco stumbled out of the floo and came eye to eye with a breastfeeding Adelaide. He awkwardly looked away. “Erhm… Hi.”
“Okay.” Harry got up, immediately close to Draco again. They stood there for a short while, close but not touching. “You smell of metal and cold,” Harry sighed, sounding unhappy about that.
As soon as Draco’s body touched the bed though, he was gone, sleeping the deep sleep only drunken people sleep.
“Your accounts are much the same as they were yesterday and I have yet to finish the report on potential investment strategies. It
Then decided he definitely could after a second thought. But after living with them for the last 10 years he wasn’t surprised. That realization is what cooled his Dursley ire. They’d starved him, locked him in a cupboard for years. Was he to expect they’d have the decency to tell him the truth about his legacy. Of course not, they were the Dursleys. They were awful.
Rogrig didn't even turn, the words had barely finished coming out of Harry’s mouth when a small scotch tumbler popped into his hand full of clear clean water.
“As I said before Heir Potter, we care little for how men both magical and muggle govern themselves outside of these walls. We only care about their money, not how it's gained.” Rogrig said with a bored air. “It is the duty of Aurors to hold Wizards accountable to their laws, not the goblins of Gringotts.”
“Ah no shame in that son.” He said with another pat to Harry’s shoulder.
“Um sure. Please.” Harry said shifting uncomfortably in his seat suddenly feeling caught but not quite sure why.
In awe of magic once again, he quietly sent Rogrig his thanks. He was sure he could pull this off.
With a flourish Harry gathered himself to his knees and pulled his wand out of the pocket of his hoodie.
So, was it any wonder Harry was a bit peeved. This big magical man came in and threw off years of degrading toiling self-deprecating work, told him he’d “catch up” with all this magic stuff, and then turned around and sent him
He could do with some proper clothes too. Proper food, a proper prescription for his glasses. It’s a wonder Hagrid hadn’t said anything about the condition he found him in, a wonder nobody he’d met in Diagon Alley had said anything. He was a mess. Hagrid was a bit of a mess himself if Harry was being honest, it's possible he just assumed that's how Harry was and not a distinct indication of the conditions in which he lived. If that was the case it made Harry like the big idiot more for it.
He’d always been alone, and the Dursleys always made such a big fuss out of it, out of everything he did. His powers. His magic. Was something he learned early on to just hide or ignore when he could. When something
He’d just spent the last 4 days discovering his school books were capable of answering none of his questions and only seemed good for creating newer, more obscure ones. With the added side effect of getting him very excited about what he’d be learning to do. Spell work seemed incredibly varied and downright useful. Mostly.
“We’ll need to test your magical signature in order to verify your identity. Then we can summon your key for you.. It requires a drop of blood and the application of a bit of goblin magic. With your consent of course.”
It'd been almost three years without an incident, well three years without the Dursley’s being aware of an incident. There had been quite a few incidents actually but that was the game wasn’t it. That was his game.
Another face could blend him into the background, perceived less, a non threat, inconspicuous. Less likely to be called upon in class, ignored by bullies.
That could’ve gone worse Harry thought.
“There isn’t a useful scrap of information in any of these!” Harry told Hedwig with a sharp gesture at his open school books.
he repeated to himself like a mantra. He was desperate. With a stubborn obstinance he summoned the courage to show his hand. Drop all his masks. Harry finally looked up to make direct eye contact with Rogrig, daring him to say anything about what he just witnessed about what he was currently witnessing.
He soon decided he was as ready as he'd ever be.
However he knew most adults wouldn't approve of an 11 year old wandering London on their own. He had to make himself inconspicuous to them.
All it took was a quick prick of Harry's finger and a small drop of his blood dripped down and landed in the center of a blank piece of parchment below. It began to glow faintly as Rogrig spoke some sort of incantation. Soon the drop moved and began writing in a language Harry had never seen before. Then with a pop Harry’s vault key dropped onto the desk before them. Harry's eyes widened in surprise, still shocked by the reality of magic.
All his other text books read like made up guides for fictional solutions to improbable things. The potions text seemed the most logical, but only if you had an understanding of the illogical properties the ingredients possessed.
As was he for his.
loud in here! I must insist you do something about this noise!” Harry’s voice gave a wavering little whine at the end.
Harry, now confident he could pull this off, made his way into The Leaky Cauldron just after 11 in the morning, the majority of his 50 pounds spent. He knew where to go to get more though his vault at Gringotts was calling to him.
at it.
“Agh!” Vernon yelped, jumping back when three letters flew through a gap in the poorly sealed window and slapped him in the face.
With that the conversation shifted to the physical assets controlled by the Potters.
“Gringotts has been open every hour since the last great goblin war ended, and will not close until such a time as another goblin war begins.” Rogrig said no small amount of pride, and tacked on at the end. “Besides, some wizards only come out at night, and yes we do the infernal muggle paper money, it's all the muggleborns have.”
The fact that he had magic powers was the least surprising revelation of the lot given his day to day. He had always gotten himself in odd scenarios. Freakish some might even say.
“I learned to summon my vault key Hedwig, it took a lot of stress to get it but now that we have it I can finally get some answers.”
A tapping at his window drew his attention.
He grabbed his wand and the stolen fifty note and slipped into the hall. With quiet creaks of the stairs he descended down. As he approached it he thought better than the front door, to many eyes on the front drive. So he turned towards the kitchen and exited out through the back garden door.
“No I really appreciated Rogrig, it was fun to hear about my family I’ve always wondered about them, I never thought I’d learn so many interesting little things about them.”
He'd worked it out last night and it was going smoothly so far.
Some faces worked better than others. Some didn’t work at all. That was another aspect of the game. For example Harry learned the hard way he couldn’t intimidate. It never worked for him, he was underfed, scrawny and poorly dressed.
His anger had shifted since Hagrid’s revelation. He couldn’t stop thinking about how he was apparently some big hero and no one had thought to check up on him. How he was expected to just go back. He was having a hard time blaming Hagrid, he was truthfully rather dim and he didn't seem to know much anyway. He was only the messenger. Harry shouldn’t. Couldn’t expect him to do more than he had, he’d done more than enough already. More than the Dursleys had done in 10 years.
When Harry arrived he quickly found a seat near the back. He was planning on watching Tom, and listening to some of the conversations around him.
If he played with half a deck of cards with most people, he played with a quarter deck with the Dursleys. No matter what he did he’d never have their support. He knew that. It didn't take a magical revelation for him to realize it. His presence was always and would always be a constant reminder of the burden they perceived him as, his roots a blemish on their family. It didn't matter that his parents weren’t actually the drunks that killed themselves and scarred their baby boy in a reckless midnight drive. They were wizards and Harry learned not a day ago that the Dursleys actually thought that was worse.
Dudely was miserable the
Harry's ears were ringing and he was waving away bits of confetti, as the oddest sensation he’d ever felt ran down his body. It felt viscous like oil and left a tingling sensation on his skin as it moved.
Hermione looked up, replying, “Draco,” rather dryly.
“Calm down, Harry,” Draco chuckled, “we’ll be fine.”
Adelaide patted his knee. “It takes time.”
‘Yes, sir.’
Harry laughed a little, but it sounded just as awkward as Draco felt. ‘We could look up his file at the ORO to see if he actually owns all these Omegas – because that’s illegal.’
A sharp, rapping knock on the door, ‘boys, lunch break is over now. I expect the both of you back in the office in five minutes.’ Hermione sounded stern but not angry.
‘I won’t I won’t, I’ll do anything, please,’ Draco whined and he pushed his arse back against Harry’s hands.
Draco crossed his arms in front of his stomach, obscuring it from the curious gaze of Miss Parkinson.
O MY GOD A CLIFFHANGER WHAT DID I DO?!
“They’re in awe of you. Let them be,” Draco said with a small smile.
‘Harry, people are staring at us,’ Draco whispered, ‘why are they staring?’
“Of course they didn’t find anything upon their first visit, but after that happened, things got… less pleasant.” Draco joined Lupin, mimicking his movements with the paint roller, loading it and then applying it to the wall. The roller was heavier than he had anticipated. “One of my teachers eventually anonymously reported it. Harry carried me out as I was pretty much dying.”
Draco blinked. It had been some time since he had seen Hermione in full-on work modus. “Thank you.”
Draco did as instructed, watching Healer Roberts closely as she placed a flat, oval-shaped stone on his stomach. It was cold, and he tensed up a little. Healer Roberts was unbothered, conjuring her wand and murmuring a spell in a low tone. It made a blue-ish shimmer settle over Draco’s stomach, and with another spell, the stone projected up an image of their little baby. Harry’s fingers clenched around Draco’s.
Draco placed their teacups on their desks and wandered into the library-part of the office. The books were sorted by main subject, and then alphabetically.
“Bella will set you up with the extra vitamins, and I’ll make sure she adds some more information on twin pregnancies. I’d like to see you back in three weeks.”
Two lines.
Hermione reached across the table and took one of his hands. ‘Draco, this… I…’ She drew in a deep breath, ‘I could talk to Harry for you and see what he has to say about this. If he does not deny, or even confirm what you told me, I think you should try to build a case against him. Because what you described to me is most definitely abuse.’
Adelaide retreated to the guest room shortly after dinner, leaving him alone with Harry and Hermione. He sat in a kitchen chair while Hermione spread out pieces of parchment on the table. Draco tried to decipher what they were about, but he wasn’t that great at reading upside down, so couldn’t get much out of it. Harry though, sat on the right side of the table and hummed a few times, looked at them.
What do you think? Are all three victims of abuse? Or maybe just one or two? What is up with Luna's Alpha?
‘Hmm-mm… I know, it’s good right?’
Draco patted his ever-flat stomach and downed his glass, which magically refilled itself. “Nope. Lotsa sex, though.”
“W-what?” Harry managed, sounding appropriately confused, but happy.
‘Is that why you went to Myrion?’ Draco asked, trying to sound curious instead of pushy.
‘Mrs Weasley owled Hermione for me this morning,’ Draco said slowly, ‘I’d like to see Harry again.’
‘Of course, Draco, whatever you need,’ was the soft answer to that.
I went to the dentist yesterday and no kidding, my jaw still hurts so bad, it's terrible.
‘They’re hiding the school from view, only Omegas can enter,’ Harry started, ‘and they allow prospected owners to remain anonymous. From what I gathered, only the principle knows to whom the Omegas are promised.’
There was no window in the room where he was held, and after a few hours, Draco gave up on trying to tell time. He averted his attention to other things. Crabbe had left the light on, and it was unpleasantly sharp. It was one of those cheap tube lights that muggles used in many schools. Every now and then, it flickered.
“Okay, well, let me give you something lighter for now, and a few more of the stronger ones for after the next heat too.”  She disappeared behind a set of large cabinets and came back with more vials. As she slid them across the counter, she, after some clear hesitation added, “if sitting is becoming a bit of an issue, I could also give you a donut pillow.”
“Please,” Draco breathed, closing his eyes as another extended sting of pain zinged through his body.
Draco shrugged, “it’s nice to have the option.”
“I don’t want to move again,” Lupin murmured.
‘I know.’ Harry turned sideways a bit, so that Draco could see his face. His eyes, normally so warm and loving, were now cold and filled with an emotion Draco didn’t recognise.
Harry laughed. “I’m sorry, baby.” He sank down next to Draco and looked over to where their children were playing. “Maybe we need to teach Elizabeth how to say no to her sister.”
‘Sure, I’d like to have a sleepover at Grimmauld Place. Harry promised to show me what a television box is and we never got around doing that…’
Harry shrugged. “Yeah, well, I didn’t want to forget anyone.”
‘I’m here.’ Harry pressed a cool hand against Draco’s forehead.
“Oh. Okay.” Draco dropped the subject and placed Victoria back in her crib where she promptly fell asleep again. Bending over was still kind of painful, and he leaned into his back when he had let her go. Soon, he felt Harry’s warm, supportive hand settle over the sore spot, rubbing slow circles.
‘Don’t. Bare. Your. Neck,’ Harry gritted out. Draco immediately stopped but whimpered again in need.
“... so all in all, it’s only a matter of deciding what we want,” Draco recapped their visit to Edinburg for Adelaide and Molly.
‘Harry and I got into a fight,’ he blurted out, unable to keep quiet with her trying so hard to make him talk.
‘Why?’
Draco bowed back, gracefully. His mother was content, he could see from the corners of his eyes.
So... What do you think? Will our lovely couple dive into the world of possible pregnancies? Will they come across more problems as they go? How will their relationship develop, now that Harry's taken some time off? What will friends and family think?
‘Remind me that I should thank Hermione for sending me to that shop.’ Harry stepped closer to Draco and hugged him quickly.
“That’s sensible,” she agreed. “If you need any help or advice in the meantime…” The rest of her sentence got cut off  when Harry, Arthur and Ron entered the sunroom for a break. Adelaide and Draco parted again, and didn’t speak about their respective secrets for the rest of the day.
‘You’re going into heat. Well, I’d say you
‘Okay,’ Draco sniffed, ‘but I still don’t like it and you’re not forgiven for hiding this from me.’
Draco rose quickly, remembering his manners just in time and nodded. ‘Yes, mother, thank you.’ He stood still, because all guests were supposed to come to the Omega and greet them.
‘Almost there, that’s great Draco, you’re such a good boy…’
So here it is, all the smut. Enjoy!
Draco wasn’t even seated yet when she started.
Adelaide hummed and placed an arm around Draco’s waist, coming in even closer. The closeness of another, non-competing Omega did wonders for Draco’s tiredness and he made a mental note to do some research on the effects of having another Omega close during pregnancy. “You can’t tell anyone. Not even Molly,” he warned.
‘It’s very nice to meet you, Draco,’ Hermione said in a decided tone and she stepped aside, ‘would you like to come into the office for a while?’ She looked at Harry, shaking her head only a little bit in disapproval.
It turned out Mr Potter wanted to see him as well. He wanted to come over that same afternoon, to which Mrs Weasley had agreed.
No cliffhanger this time! (Well, I don't consider this to be a cliffhanger)
Harry raised his eyebrows in question and surprise, ‘I do that?’
Draco sneaked out of the guest room, turning his head every few steps to check if Adelaide was still asleep. Having made it out of the bedroom safely, he looked at the dreaded staircase. Most, if not all steps were creaky.
“I see.” Asking questions didn’t feel like an option to Draco. He would take any information Lupin would offer him, though.
In the kitchen, he leaned against the countertop, while Hermione instructed Harry to sit. She placed her suitcase on the table and opened it. Inside stood a pensieve. Draco had seen them before, so he knew what they were, but why Hermione had brought one was a mystery to him.
Living at Grimmauld Place was not as difficult as Draco had thought it would be, mostly because Ginny had moved out. He’d asked Harry about it, who had shrugged, “I didn’t want her here anymore. It’s my house, so she left”.
So Draco obeyed.
Mr Potter looked at Draco’s mother, waiting a bit too long to reply. ‘Of course, Mrs Malfoy. I understand.’ He relocated his gaze back to Draco. ‘You may dress now, thank you.’
He started to cry, curling up to be as small as possible and pulling up the blankets.
“He lived,” Draco finished the sentence.
Just as Draco poked his head out the door, Harry was there. He smiled at Draco and Draco smiled back automatically, stepping outside and into Harry’s embrace.
‘I think you grew up with the wrong idea and – stop moving your hips! Christ, Draco.’
‘What?’ she said angrily, ‘I said I don’t want to talk to you, I’m still mad.’
Draco nodded. ‘So how does it work?’
Draco felt a smile form on his lips. ‘I would.’ Even though the things Hermione wrote were usually on a whole different level than Draco was used to, he enjoyed reading them nonetheless. It was fun and interesting and most always it was about improving the life for Omegas, which was something he was always interested in.
“No,” Harry said firmly, “no protesting. I agree that preparing a little is a good idea – I wouldn’t want you to experience nest-panic – but there is no need to panic about this now. We have time, we’re only doing this when you’re ready for it.”
‘I know something that’ll cheer you up,’ she then said.
Adelaide seemed a bit giddy as well, as she had just provided Draco with a detailed description of how she slept with both Molly and Arthur.
Harry wrapped his arm around Draco’s waist, pulling him close. ‘Just five months now.’
After a few minutes of slow breathing, the fear started to leak out of the other’s scent, and Draco asked; “you okay?”
“Later this week.” Draco placed a hand on his steadily growing - though still small - bump. “But so far everything’s looking good. So no worries here.”
Next week's chapter is "Work, work, work"
(channeling my inner conspirator here ^^)
“It would be-” Harry abruptly ended his sentence, fixating his gaze on Draco and breathing in through his nose deliberately. He blinked, then let his gaze slide over his mate.
‘And you only went to school with other Omegas?’
Harry’s hand stilled. ‘Do you want to?’
Harry shook his head and sighed. “And you didn’t ask me if I was okay with you babysitting, the
‘It’s okay… I’m right here…’ Harry soothed. ‘I’m going to let you go now, okay? You have to undress.’
Keep in mind that this chapter and all chapters until chapter 10 have been written over the course of these last three years, and I've proofread them for consistency - but as I said, my writing style has evolved over this time so I can't promise 100% consistency when it comes to
“Hey, hey, it’s okay,” Draco said, trying to keep his tone low and soothing. He sent a glare up to the woman. “Step away from him.”
Draco closed his eyes, mustering up the courage to say it. ‘I – IthinkI’mreadytobondwithyou,’ he spluttered awkwardly
‘I – I want to go home,’ he said tightly, trying not to cry. He was not going to cry over something as pity as this.
‘Please,’ Draco gasped, ‘I need…’
One more vicious kick and his Alpha left. When he stood in the threshold, he spoke one more time. ‘Clean up after yourself.’ And left, locking the door behind him.
He dreamed about it day and night, fantasizing about a little baby boy with Harry’s dark hair and eyes, but Draco’s slender build, or maybe a chubby little girl with Harry’s fierce eyes and Draco’s light, silvery hair or…
Draco jerked his head to the side to see Mr Potter standing next to the bathtub. He blushed and wanted to curl up, disappear, felt embarrassed for being seen by him this way, but aroused at the same time.
It surprised Draco time and time again how adept she was at convincing him to talk, even though they already had many arguments much like this one. “Just promise me you won’t tell Harry.”
Draco now clutched the stegosaurus more tightly. “No. We’ll take them home immediately.”
His mother looked positively furious. ‘If I may, Mr Potter. Omega skin bruises easily and Draco’s skin is particularly sensitive. Next to that he is a bit clumsy. If he walks into something it will immediately cause bruising on his skin.’
Draco could barely comprehend that Harry had been the one to kill the villain. Instead, he asked, suddenly panicked, “Tori and Lizzie, are- are they-”
She frowned a little at him and he hastily added, ‘miss Fawley.’
Draco turned away again, putting his headphones on, giving the couple as much privacy as the situation allowed.
‘But if you get dressed, I’ll take you with me and drop you off at Hermione’s office. I think she wanted to talk to you about some of the new laws she’ll be putting forward at the Wizengamot…’
“I nearly went mad without you.”
“I think they’re more afraid than in awe. I’m sure they still use me as an example in the academy.”
His instincts recognised the order immediately and he stood up stiffly.
‘I’d be willing to do that,’ Harry offered, ‘if you are okay with that too, Draco? And we’ll have to ask Molly for permission, of course.’
I KNOW ANOTHER CLIFFHANGER DAMN.
Anyway, that was all the senseless babble for now, enjoy this chapter!
(See the end of the chapter for
They both were quiet for another few minutes.
More pressure and he whimpered again, as slowly Harry started to push his fist inside. As soon as Draco realised what he was doing, he moaned and tried to relax his muscles, allowing Harry to do it. His instincts told him Harry was preparing him to be knotted and suddenly that was all the wanted, all he needed.
Draco bucked his hips back up, grinding inexpertly into Harry’s. ‘You call this fun?’
“He’s awake,” Remus announced in a quiet tone.
But the damage was done already. Draco had retreated from Harry’s grip and stepped back, towards the stairs. Hermione grabbed him by the arm.
Draco closed his eyes and moaned, ‘Merlin, Harry…’
Just as he was on the edge of it, Harry pulled his fingers back gently, whispering, ‘you’ve been so good, Draco, such a good boy, so good, just for me…’ and tapping his wand on his leg as well as Draco’s stomach to clean them.
“How different?”
“There there,” Adelaide murmured in a soft, soothing voice and she rubbed his back.
‘I don’t know,’ Hermione sighed, ‘I’m close to thinking maybe I was wrong all along and there is nothing to make a case out of. Maybe I just overreacted when I noticed the amount of abuse records. I just – I’ll go to the Ministry to request those files.’
Draco bit his lip, looking at the floor. “I tried to hide it from you.”
“We’ll ask in a few hours, okay? It’s too early for them to be up. Just try to sleep a little more.” He petted Elizabeth’s soft, blonde curls.
“Nothing! Just sit...”  Draco looked around, looking for a surface that was safe for Harry to sit on while he decorated, “... there.”
“Very well Heir Potter, you have sufficiently proven that you’re capable of summoning your vault key.” Rogrig said, blowing smoke to the ceiling as he leaned back in his chair. “Just in time as well, my shift ends at 7.”
With a hitch in his throat Harry sucked in a gulp of air.
Ok maybe he was having a bit too much fun.
Harry looked down at himself, some hero, he was currently wearing a stained up old t-shirt 4 sizes too large for him, he was scrawny, barely fed. Forget about being emotionally ready. iIntellectually ready. He wasn’t even physically ready to enter this new world. And time was ticking down quickly.
“There may be other options…” Rogrig said slowly voice echoing off his wall of filing cabinets. He had noted that the boy seemed worn, more so than yesterday. Like he’d aged years overnight. He had dark red rings around his eyes. They were clouded and lacked the confidence and hope he’d left Gringotts with yesterday. His hands were scraped and he smelled of dried blood and sweat.
“Never too soon to prepare” Harry replied adding a bit of a nasally whine to his voice while looking down at his shoes for anonymity. He placed 3 Galleons on the counter.
“Yes of course you are Mr. Patterson. How long did you say you were staying?”
“May I have some water?” Harry asked, his mouth gone suddenly dry.
"Thank you, sir." Harry said truthfully, grateful.
“Yes I had it.”
Why yes it’s true he did have an owl.
From there he tried his best to act like he belonged moving from street to street till he reached the familiar train station from days before and bought himself a ticket to Paddington at one of the many self-serve ticket kiosks.
Harry was surprised at how well it seemed to work and read the fine print.
“I asked if you’re lost son?”
Besides, it’d be very useful even in the short term, bleaching his hair and concealing his scar still weren’t very effective given a real hard look.
He was Vernon Dursley! He did the scaring by God and no bloody owls would be getting to him. No sir, not today, not tomorrow, not ever.
Harry counted himself lucky he had gotten back a little after 9, if this had happened at 10 Uncle Vernon might’ve just stabbed him anyway. Aunt Petunia entered then, or Harry had just noticed. She was glowering at him clutching a worried looking Dudley behind herself, keeping him at the kitchen door and away from the home invader.
“Hedwig!” Harry smiled, reassured by the sight of her again.
With a click of the latch he was safe in his own space again.
“Oh no don't worry Rogrig I’m not here for that..” Harry said shifting from foot to foot uncomfortably.
“Just walking into my!” He spluttered around the popsicle in his mouth freezer door still open and in his hand.
“Just doing my job, Heir Potter.”
Harry shut and locked it again and turned to get himself ready. He was going back to Diagon Alley and he thought it prudent to keep that to himself. The Dursleys didn't seem to bother with him anymore, frightened of his magic. But he knew that only went so far and he was hesitant to push the limits. The Dursleys weren’t the issue though, right now they’d be happiest if he left in the night and never came back.
He wasn’t sure how long he’d been running or even how long he’d been there before Hedwig alighted on his shoulder giving him a soft hoot and nibbling lightly on his ear. But he didn’t know where he was and didn’t recognize the street name. All the same it didn’t seem to matter much to him at the moment, Harry leaned in close to Hedwig and tucked his chin over her feet, awkwardly snuggling the bird as best he could. Clambering for whatever comfort she provided, they stayed like that until Harry’s legs fell asleep, his tears ran dry and his breathing returned to normal.
________________________________
Well not scared..
He learned that some of the Potter treasures had gone missing, some with the recent death of his parents, others longer ago. Some treasures were so old other families had claimed them as well, and they were stuck in an ownership war.
“Of course I’m sure!” Harry grumbled out, falling back into irritated old man.
Things just sometimes happened around him. Like he understood snakes. Like actually understood them. Not in a wildlife expert: I know this things habits kind of way, but a "hello how do you do?" Kind of way.
This is my attempt at writing a manipulative, sneaky and morally grey Harry Potter, a Slytherin Harry if you will. I'm obviously not the first to do this, and I'm sure I won't be the last. Hopefully I haven't ouroborosed myself to badly by reading all the other good Slytherin Harry fics out there, but hey this is for fun! We're having fun!
The added recognizability in the wizarding world would make this particularly difficult to pull off. And even if adult wizards were fine with 11 year olds moving about on their own he found his fame new and very challenging. The experience of being so seen in The Leaky Cauldron when Hagrid had brought him in made him very uncomfortable. He didn't like losing control of his narrative.
Knowing what plays were available with each individual person, when to make them, and what could be gained from it, that was his game.
Harry passed many shops he hadn’t seen on his last two visits to the alley, noting with a passive interest some of the side streets off Diagon Alley. Like Horizont Alley and with more tentative glances, the entrance to Knockturn Alley.
“Of course!” Harry said, jumping at the help. “I consent.”
“Uh. Would you have time to discuss something, privately?” Harry asked, making pleading eye contact with the goblin.
“I.. Oh.” Harry said speechless.
“Most inns wouldn’t rent a room to someone your age without adult consent or supervision. You know, wizard laws, irresponsible children, safety and all that.” Rogrig ground out looking like it was difficult to even talk about the customs of humans.
“A quarter to 7, quitting time.” Rogrig said, satisfied, and began to pack up his desk.
“Ah Har- Harlannn... Harlan Patterson.” Harry eventually drew out, god he was fumbling all over himself tonight.
He had picked up yesterday that goblins didn't seem to mind kids being about on their own, but he was pretty positive wizards shared the same view as Muggles when it came to child safety. Parents or guardians were supposed to accompany them to places. That was all well and good Harry thought, when those guardians truly cared.
Dropping the knife back on the table Uncle Vernon quickly turned and gathered his family still standing at the door and started herding them out of the scene.
“Sorry Rogrig” Harry said sheepishly. “It won’t happen again.”
Searching the cramped little isles keeping his head low whenever he passed another customer. Stepping over the occasional whoopee cushion that he learned would scream if he stepped on it, and around the wind-up teeth that'd rattle towards him trying to bite at his ankles.
“Ah, Heir Potter, back so soon?” Rogrig said with a curious tilt to his head.
Picking them back up he proceeded to tear them with a growl making a bitter little pile of confetti.
Tom just glanced over at him again and gave him a nod of recognition.
The door made another rude noise on his way out.
And his cursed nephew.
“Oh! What about dinner sir?” Harry said, stopping him at the door.
Eventually Rogrig came to the end of the documents, Harry's head swimming with history and the intricacies of business dealings, holdings, and ownership laws. He was supremely grateful to have Rogrig leading him through this.
Sadly JKR wrote Harry Potter...
Many of the things he heard he didn’t understand at all. Even so he decided this was something he needed to do daily if he could manage it. He’d read once that the best way to learn a language was to immerse yourself in it, and Harry assumed the same was probably true for wizarding stuff. Besides, if he could manage to keep from looking shocked at every seemingly common element of magical life he’d probably be better for it.
He looked over his shoulder at the now blonde boy, “let's get your identity verified and see if we can’t find you the answers you seek.”
Harry couldn’t help but enjoy himself, he’d never had the opportunity to be crotchety, he’d never even had the opportunity too whine. It was oddly freeing.
“Do you like it Uncle?” Harry quickly replied, giving his hair a flip. His life flashed before his eyes at the end of his hairs 2 second arc.
vaults, Heir Potter, the money is yours by birth right and by magic.” He emphasized his point with a puff of smoke in Harry's direction, and a flick of one of his cigarillos. “You will find that we care little for how men both magical and muggle govern themselves outside of these walls. This is a business, we care about their money. Nothing else.” Finished, Rogrig turned on his heel and continued briskly through the halls.
“You’re sure?” Tom said with a mischievous grin writing down the name in his ledger.
Tom looked genuinely relieved as well. He was finally rid of Harlan, and Harry was sure he had no clue he’d just rented a room to Harry Potter for the next 3 weeks.
“Finally summoned it then?” Rogrig grinned.
“If that’ll be all sir please step out of line… We are a business.” Rogrig said, sounding suddenly more bored than smug.
He stopped at a drugstore first and drifted over to the makeup section looking for a bit of concealer. The cashier gave him a couple odd looks but didn’t give him much trouble. He had his scar covered with a hasty application, Harry thought it a bit fun actually. However this still wasn’t enough, he was still distinctly Harry Potter to those that saw him last week even with the symbol of his fame covered.
“Alrighty Mr. Patterson you’ll be in room 452.” Tom said, turning seemingly surprised to see the old man struggling to wrangle his coins.
"I'll be out all day today. It may be best.. Safest, to entertain yourself till this evening. I should be back by then." She gave a quiet hoot in return, and with a few more pets he opened the window and she flew silently out and into the pre-dawn light.
And so Harry sat, and when it was as busy as he’d ever seen it and as loud as he’d ever heard it he got up and squeezed through the mingling crowd making his way to the loo. When he was in with the door shut and locked he backed against the wall to reread the directions on the back of the poppers package.
“Better Sir?” Harry jumped, snapping his focus away from the muted patrons. Tom's voice was surprisingly loud over the now quiet din of the dining room. He was now fully attentive to Harry and was giving him a curious inquisitive look. Harry’s heart jumped at the sudden focus and he quickly tried to school his face back to that irritated expression he walked up to Tom with, but was finding it hard to keep the awe off his face.
Harry pinked at his ears being so obviously seen.
“Uh i guess so.”
“Good good,” Rogrig said taking the key from Harry’s hands. “Now I want you to focus on that feeling and I want you to imagine the key as best you can. I can feel it’s tied itself to you now, if you picture it clearly enough and give it a tug it will come to you, now go ahead and give it a try.” So saying Rogrig got up from his desk with a huff of smoke and exited his office taking Harry’s vault key with him.
“Would you like to know why I invited you to my office today?” Rogrig said making eye contact.
His heart was thudding in his ears he couldn’t breathe! He grabbed onto one of the stair banisters holding on with all the strength he could muster.
He was really struggling today.
“Hagrid seemed to think I would be ok.. Said Hogwarts would catch me up.” Harry said, trying to excuse his ignorance in a bid to save face. Even while knowing Rogrig was right, it was the whole reason he was here. To better prepare himself.
“Yes of course,” Harry continued. “Uh- While I have you I’d like to inquire about a room? I’ll be needing somewhere to stay for a couple weeks.”
A big man named Hagrid had actually just walked him through a magical alley-way, helped him buy supplies for wizards school, explained to him that he was some sort of baby war hero, then left.. Just like that: "Oh by the way yer a wizard Arry, have an owl, goodbye." He hadn't a clue how to care for an owl or any desire to own one. They were apparently "dead useful" though.
“Oh. That- oh.” Harry wasn’t sure what to say.
He instinctively played for innocence.
He remained the same height, it seems the magic didn't reach all the way to the bones. But what it did reach. It
, there are bad wizards. He couldn’t help picking on the big idiot, and there probably wasn't any harm in it if he kept it to himself.
“Ignorance is a dangerous thing in a world where touching the wrong quill could be the difference in having and not having a hand.”
"I'll just add your blood verification to the Potter folder." Rogrig huffed, puffing smoke out in big breathy grunts of exertion, the drawer just kept going, extending out across the office now.
“Would you like to see something?” He said, excited to share his accomplishment.
She was still a new and constant surprise for him after only a week, and his day had been long.
“Who!”
Vernon Dursley was scared.
There was only so much fear an intangible invisible threat could inspire without having to eventually make good on it, and it was currently a very hollow promise of a threat.
"Very well,” Rogrig said gathering some papers, “once summoned we will instruct you on how to feel for its presence and summon it yourself. If only to avoid this inconvenience in the future." Rogrig said, hopping down from his dais and opening a half door to the left of it, gesturing for Harry to enter.
Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream was a must. He'd been craving it for the last week since Hagrid took him. Flourish and Blotts for sure he thought as he passed, giving it a longing glance, much to learn, do much to catch up on. Twilfitt and Tattings had some very nice clothes it seemed, and oh! He had to get another couple sets of school robes from Madam Malkin's. For that matter he'd have to pick up another set of all his first year supplies.
He found him, he was on duty at a dais near the back on the right.
“You!”
He supposed he’d just have to handle this himself. It's what he's always done anyway.
His skin was crawling, physically, he felt it moving, shifting, adjusting.
Harry could only think that the events of the last two weeks had all been too much for him. All the revelations and balancing acts piling up on his shoulders, the incident this morning with Aunt Petunia and his old cupboard being the final straw.
“I-“ Vernon started looking suddenly trapped like he’d blindly jumped and found the fall was much further than he’d been told. Visibly gathering himself Vernon snapped out “Clean this mess up
Harry wasn't sure he'd ever seen so many numbers before. “So what does this all, um mean?” He asked hesitantly, not understanding or really knowing what to do with the stacks of papers set before him.
“Boy! What in the bloody hell do you think you're doing! Sneaking into my dining room at such an ungodly hour!” Vernon bellowed, the other end of his bitten through popsicle flying from his mouth to land at Harry’s feet.
Harry collapsed against a tree. He was sweaty and heaving big breaths through chapped lips. His legs were on fire and his lungs ached, and he had dried blood from small cuts on his hands. The glass from the light he numbly pieced together.
Well, he was just having a look at the sea. On a blustery night like tonight, how could he not. So exciting! No sir, not creeping at a window, watching for owls, not at all.
‘We’re going upstairs now,’ Hermione told Draco and she placed her hand in his back, giving a gentle push towards the stairs. They followed the memory-trio up to the floor where Hermione and Ron lived, and then up to Ginny’s floor. ‘Pay attention,’ Hermione said, ‘this is important.’
“I thought you were angry with Adelaide,”  Draco quietly murmured.
“Alright. What is it?”
‘So how do you make sand cookies?’ he asked the little boy.
‘Likewise,’ he said, feeling a lot less nervous than when she had arrived.
‘I will leave you to it then.’ She left.
Adelaide laughed and patted her own ever-growing belly. ‘That makes two of us. And I’m fairly sure I’m fatter than you are.’
“Almost twenty-five,” Draco murmured. “But I’ve been on heat suppressants from my fifteenth until I met Harry so... seven years...”
He frowned. ‘Approved Omega literature.’
Draco thought about that for a few minutes, ‘well – yes, I suppose, but you’re not… I’m not… I’m not supposed to instigate fights or… partake in them at all…’ He was unsure of his answer, because, yes, Omegas weren’t supposed to fight, contradict or challenge their Alphas and if the Alpha was the instigator, Omegas were just supposed to take it. But in the Weasley household, many of the things he’d learned as an Omega turned out to be untrue or not applicable to the situation.
Harry stayed quiet, allowing Draco to mentally distance himself from both Harry and the bond. Draco could still feel Harry’s conflicted emotions through the bond, but it was much more muted now. He drew in a deep, steadying breath and felt the panic slowly seep away.  Eventually, the gentle pull towards his Alpha won over Draco's fear of him.
Hermione sighed. ‘Just talk to him about it, okay?’
“It did.”
He was being pulled out of the memory in a green, smoky haze as Harry stepped into the floo.
“Honestly, that sounds tiring and uncomfortable,”  Adelaide admitted.
“You’re not helping, Harry.” Draco turned away from the mirror and towards his partner. “The thought we’ll be parents within a few weeks is…” he felt anxiety soar in his stomach and ride up into his throat, making him feel like he needed to throw up. “... terrifying,” he finished his sentence in a whisper.
The first few weeks of the courtship consisted of Harry visiting Draco at least three times a week, but sometimes more. Harry tried to come over for longer periods of time or sometimes even the whole day at least twice a week, but often visited for lunch or dinner, and sometimes visited right after dinner. He and Draco would then usually go on a walk. Because Draco had expressed his preference for Adelaide joining them as a chaperone, they couldn’t often go that far, but no-one complained about that.
In part, I understand that the ending of the previous chapter can be shocking to some, but at the same time I wondered: Why be so upset when earlier in the story I have described/ mentioned similar abuse. Is it
“Would you like some more guidance in the process?” Healer Roberts then suggested in a soft, non-offensive tone. “I understand it’s all a bit much, and it’s very normal and understandable to feel like you need more time, more space, or like you need to talk to someone.”
‘Yes, yes, anything,’ Harry confirmed distractedly.
Draco shrugged. ‘Just how life has been since… you know.’
It was a full house at the Borrow. All the kids were there, and a couple Draco didn’t recognize. The man had shaggy, brown hair, and a scar on his upper lip. He was skinny, and his suit - or at least, Draco assumed the outfit was supposed to be a suit - hung loosely around his too-large frame. A woman flanked him, as if they were attached at the hip. She wore black jeans and sneakers, and a brightly coloured rainbow sweater. Her eyes sparkled with excitement. It was obvious that she was the extraverted of the two.
So when Mrs Weasley sat down and looked at him expectantly, he drew in a deep breath and dropped the bomb, ‘I think I’m ready to bond with Harry.’
