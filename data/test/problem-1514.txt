“Look, if you don’t tell me, I’m just going to go straight to Snape. He’s not much better than you, I’ll admit it, but he would at least tell me what the hell is going on.”
“No, I want to… with you…” he lost his voice somewhere in his throat, and Potter’s fingers squeezed gently, and the world was such a marvelous, wonderous place. It took another minute or so until the brooms appeared before them, and Potter sent one of them back. He got on the other one and carefully helped Draco mount behind him.
“Master Harry says he is fine, but Master is wrong. Either Master is more foolish than he looks, or he lies. Kreacher wonders which one is it?”
“Draco? What are you doing here?” Harry’s breath went right out of his chest with a bang. Rushing to her feet in front of him, looking highly confused, was Bellatrix Lestrange.
“That’s bullshit, Malfoy. Nothing's going to happen to you when school is over. Dumbledore isn't going to let that happen. Hell, I'm not going to let that happen.”
Something hurt - his chest felt tight and full of thorns. There was a high-pitched cry of alarm in his mind and his head was going to burst with it. Danger. “What do you mean, Sir?”
Harry blinked at him, confused. “That he was a half-blood? He was. What?” Draco shook his head, because this wasn’t it, but what he thought he heard… just couldn’t be. “It’s true. Voldemort, or well, Riddle, he was a half-blood. The Marvolo part was his magical ancestry, but Riddle was a Muggle. You can check it yourself. If we get out of here, I mean.”
“Draco, please, not now. You can reprimand me all you want later, all right? but there’s a… we need to talk about some things first.”
“I’m a little hot,” Malfoy replied innocently, though his smile was devilish. “You Gryffindors sure like to heat your dorms. It's far cooler in Slytherin.”
They weren’t, not really, he didn’t think. But knowing he will have their support – that Hermione and Pansy will help him find a suitable program, that Ron will help with official document procuring, that Blaise will write his submissions with him, that Theo will help with revisions… knowing that Mother will be there, every step of the way, encouraging, believing… knowing Harry will be there…
It took some effort not to laugh. Nothing was ever really up to Draco, and this issue was no different. He measured Potter in his glance, searching for the obvious lie, but there were no traces of it on his face. For a startling moment Draco thought that perhaps Potter actually meant it – that if he said he wanted to leave, Potter would really allow him to go. The idea made him shiver.
Draco knew that tone, and he was all for pushing the line when possible, but he wasn’t brave enough to defy
“Doesn’t matter,” Harry smiled and shook his head. “Draco, I never thought for a moment this was going to be easy. But we’re… we’re making some progress, aren’t we?”
. He tried, gods help him, he tried – but his throat was parched, and his tongue was made of sand, and he couldn’t speak. All he managed to caw when his lips finally parted was a desperate plea for water, but he wasn’t even sure if it was audible.
“What the hell was that?” Harry asked, maybe a little too harshly. The anger he felt when standing there helpless and watching Malfoy get beaten was still a little too burning to speak calmly. He grabbed the boy by the shoulders and turned him so he was facing Harry, who took in the horrifying sight of too much blood on the way-too-pale face.
in his gut. It was wrong, but then, the rules did change. They had to. Because now there was Harry Bloody Potter in the way, and Draco had to do something about it if he wanted things to go back to normal.
“What is it?” Draco sucked in a sigh. He was in physical pain with how gently Harry looked at him right now.
He didn’t want to lie, so he avoided the question. “My – the man I was with, He did the wards when I moved in here. When He left, I didn’t exactly… well, I don’t have a wand anyway. I was just hoping you could take a look, see that everything is all right.”
like he jokingly said sometimes in his head. It’s not like he could really, actually call him – he was Potter, just Potter. Always Potter, which on its own was already too much. He couldn’t very well be
“I used to see his face every night,” he muttered, his gaze trailing the embers in the fireplace. “Whenever I closed my eyes, I’d always think of him. And I’d get this really… hollow sort of feeling inside, like I’m all empty. But now I don’t really feel this way anymore. I mean it's not that I'm not –obviously I'm still sad and everything, but it’s not… as intense? I don’t know.” He buried his head in his hands. “I just feel like I’m not giving him enough.”
“All right,” Harry said, making sure Snape is still quite distant. “Tonight then. The Room of Requirement.”
“Why? Can you not think for yourself why? Are you really this dim, or are you just incredibly naïve?”
Draco’s sharp intake of air was startling in the otherwise quiet room. Harry wasn’t talking about some innocent breathing exercise or something general and safe. He was talking about the
Harry, either. “Look, I wasn’t exactly… it was shit, the way I reacted. I never meant to – obviously I have no problem with you being gay or anything. It would be kinda hypocritical for me, being bi myself and all. I was just caught off guard and wished you’d have
“Draco, come on, enough already. I’ve told you over a hundred times.” Potter must have noticed his reaction, or perhaps just realized how harsh he sounded, since he hurried to retract his words. “I mean… look, I know you’re worried, but that’s all they could do for now. Until they get the results back there’s just nothing else, and that could take weeks still. Since they can’t track down the symptoms to any curse they know… and in any case, I told you what they’d said. The thorn apple you used totally saved my life. And I’m not in any immediate danger here, so it’s all fine.”
“Remember what we talked about, the power in a name? That one has the power to make me ill.” He got to his feet and Potter did too. None of them were too drunk, judging by their steady posture. “Well, Potter. Thank you for tonight. I hope the celebration was satisfying enough.”
“I’m afraid you’ve been duped,” Draco said as calmly as he could. “No one to blame but yourself, really.” Lucius let go of him or rather threw him towards the floor, hard. Draco hit it and sat back up, rubbing his head. “That’s not very sportsman-like, Father.”
necessary, so no backing out of this one, you fucking chicken). First and foremost, Draco being there would shift Grove’s focus; instead of going for Harry, he’d go right to the source. He would much rather torment Draco than start rifling through history to choose a really good story for Harry to die over. Second, which was also incredibly important, Draco being there would give Harry pause. He won’t do anything terrible in front of Draco – he won’t do anything that’d scare him. And lastly, same as Grove’s, if Draco was to attend, Harry’s focus would alter as well. He would pay much more attention to Draco than to Grove, and he would be stronger for him. Draco didn’t make the rules; Harry was a hero always, but being in front of the people he was trying to protect was a powerful motive. If Draco's there, Harry wouldn’t shatter. Draco would be his chainmail, he’d protect him, and it was about damn time for that. Harry has been doing all of this for him, all this time, and it was only right for Draco to do it now. Something for Harry, for a change. Finally something for Harry.
Sighing heavily he got up again, holding his sore head. Malfoy seemed to be waking up as well, staring at him through one open eyelid. “Morning,” Harry said gravely, hardly daring to look at the blond.
“Yes, I get that’s the general idea,” Malfoy gritted his teeth. Hermione had gotten the hang of Apparition by the second lesson, which really was no surprise to anyone. “It’s just a little hard to concentrate with… well, with this one here in every lesson, giving me those dirty looks.”
Draco cast the spell and his cock was slathered in a layer of cool, slimy gel. It wasn’t unpleasant, just wholly unfamiliar, and he had to look at Draco to relax. He had an idea about what should go where, it was all just so… so very new.
The blush on his cheeks distracted the eye from the pockmarks, making the young man look even more fetching. “Oh, absolutely everything. He’s brilliant. He’s so smart, he’s been there for like three years already and he knows just about everything. And he’s so funny, everybody’s always laughing their arses off around him, and – “ the blush deepened, and Draco was practically ecstatic. “Well, erm. I just wanted to… make him notice me. He doesn’t really know my name yet.”
“No one’s saying they don’t,” she was still so fucking calm. Draco wanted to smack that smile off her face.
He did the impossible and sent his hand forward. It hovered above Potter’s knee, an inch above the denim, and for a second they both just stared at it, transfixed. Then it landed with a soft thud and suddenly Draco was aware of the sweetest pain he could never imagine. He didn’t think he’s brave enough to close his eyes, so he just looked away at the wall and drew a deep breath. For better or worse, he was a little bit Potter’s now, and it was freeing just as it was terrifying.
Harry was frozen for the longest moment, completely unable to move. It was Malfoy who finally jumped off of him, landing somewhat stickily on the sofa, eyes open in utter terror. Swallowing nervously, Harry tried to force his lips into saying something, but he failed. He closed his eyes in shame.
Keeping His eyes directly on him, He took a step back. “I love you, Draco. More than I ever thought possible, more than I even wished to. You are the single most important thing to me, do you understand that? More valuable than any other.”
“No, I get it. Whatever you say.” He had to be careful now, because he didn’t really trust himself to act appropriately anymore. He was spread pretty thin this past week – these past months – and his self-control was waning.
He tried to smile at them, but his muscles wouldn’t budge. “Thanks, guys. I – I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... it means a lot.” Ron clapped him on the shoulder, and Harry felt himself sinking in the sofa, a little less tense. Maybe they were right. Not that it necessarily meant he felt better about the whole thing, but... maybe it meant he could try. Out of habit he pulled the Marauder’s map from his pocket and opened it, his eyes traveling automatically to a certain dormitory in the dungeons. But when he didn’t see Malfoy’s name there, a cold dread filled his insides and for a second his eyesight went black.
“I know what Draco has told you, and I’m aware of what you told Draco. But the person you have been discussing was never, in fact, the
“Don’t,” he shook his head and decidedly averted his gaze. He knew somewhere inside him he would never be enough to change Harry’s mind, but to see it so blatantly was terrible. A reminder that Harry didn’t trust him. That he too didn’t really care for what Draco wanted. And even if he was only doing it because he tried to protect him – Draco wasn’t a child, he knew what was coming, and Harry wasn’t letting him make his own decision. Because he was less. Because he didn’t count, not even here. “Just… don’t.”
But Harry was speaking again, and Draco’s thoughts evaporated into sheer horror. “So you’re offering to give me those names in return for what, exactly?”
“Sorry, yeah.” They were sitting on the smaller sofa, close-close in a way Draco never dreamed he’d want to be, with Harry’s other arm wrapped around his waist. It was nice, bordering on too much, but he wasn’t ready to let go just yet. Coming down from the high of
“God, Draco,” he chuckled hysterically, rubbing his eyes with one hand while the other stayed on Draco’s shoulder. “You fucking scared me.”
He was only taking his job seriously, he told himself over and over again. Dumbledore left him a mission, and he wasn’t going to let him down.
Down below, everyone was at work; Blaise on the box affixed to the wall, Weasley attaching the harness to the statue, Granger at the door, eyes on her own cameras. Pansy was down at security, probably driving the poor guards wild – Draco had seen the alterations she made to her uniform.
seriously? He seriously just said that to him?) he wondered what Harry and Mother would have told the old wizard during that conversation. Hours long – the thought of it made him shudder with discomfort. His fingers trembled something awful when he fumbled with the catch, and it took a solid couple of minutes before he had the wand out. The moment he touched it, Draco knew. His eyes nearly tore out of his face.
Harry opened his mouth to say something, then shut it again with a sigh. What could he possibly say to him? No words could ever do. Draco’s hand shook a little on his knee, and again he stared at it to avoid the grey eyes. Once more he thought he can see something peculiar. Without giving it much thought he grabbed the arm, bringing it to him. Ignoring the stunned gasp, he pulled the sleeve up.
Draco would have snorted if he had the air. Instead he focused on taking it in one painful gulp at a time, blinking feverishly against the darkness of the rag. Not seeing Grove’s face so close to his was probably a blessing, but it also meant he had no idea what the man was about to do. There was frozen fear running down his veins, and it had to compete with a hot, hard rush of anger. The summation of the two was the opposite of mild.
“I really do hate you sometimes, you know that?” Potter pouted. Then he sighed, the most miserable sound in the world. He knew just as well as Draco that however badly he wanted to return, he just wasn’t ready. “Fine. Fine. A few more days, and that’s it. Hand me that parchment, I’ll write to my commander. Oh, stop giving me that dirty look, I said I’ll do it!”
“Oh, Harry. There’s no need to be so dramatic. I’m sure we can all come to some kind of understanding.”
“What if I never love you the way you want me to?” Draco asked, mostly to be difficult (because Harry deserved
Warnings: mentions of blood. Lots of blood. If that upsets you perhaps you'd like to skip the first part altogether and start after the asterisks.
“Stop it. Stop speaking to me. I don’t want to hear you ever again. I don’t want you to even look at me anymore. from now on, except for doing as I say, we will have absolutely zero contact.”
“So, so fucking scared. That if I looked at you now, I won’t be able to help myself. That I would hurt you. I don’t want to hurt you, Draco. Please.”
Draco hit his head against the coffee table’s leg and was suddenly awake. It wasn’t all that much better.
) got him smoothly to his feet, and he picked up the strange note in slightly-trembling fingers. It was Potter’s messy handwriting, and recognizing it made Draco feel instantly warmer.
This was a very vexing conversation. Draco was torn between anger with Potter’s stupidity, amusement at his innocence, general fear of opening this can of flobberworms, and a desperate sort of sadness that threatened to swallow him whole. “All right.”
“I think he is trying to teach me,” he said quietly, watching the embers crackle and gleam. “With this whole thing with you. I think he’s trying to show me something, to… teach me something I need to know. Something about kindness, and forgiveness, and – and love.” He felt his cheeks burn, but he was pretty sure he was right. Didn’t the headmaster practically tell him that last year? That his greatest power he possessed over Voldemort is love?
“I’m so sorry. So, so sorry.” He seemed unable to say anything more. Harry felt his heart seizing in his chest, the mad rush almost blinding him, to be near him,
He was at war. For days now he was at war. One would think that by now he’d be used to it, a seasoned veteran, but he was just bloody exhausted. This one wasn’t altogether different than battles he’d fought in the past. It revolved around the same principles; loyalty, redemption, obligation. His fucking tendency to destroy any and every good thing he had. The sick way he couldn’t even stick to his own bloody decisions. How pathetic, how weak he was, and how he was always spinning just outside of control, with no chance of ever really grabbing it.
Another deep breath, another miniature panic, but he had no choice but to tell them. Drawing the necessary information from his memories wasn’t entirely easy, perhaps not even feasible, like casting a fishing rod into a cloud and hoping for a good catch. Arriving at any conclusions would be an extraordinary feat. Still, they were waiting for him to do it, and Draco tried. He reeled in the pieces of fog and tried to put them into some kind of order.
Breakfast was served on the bed, and it was uncomfortable and messy and Draco would not have traded it for the world. For one wounded and pretty weak and one – well, being
“We don’t know for sure they didn’t already,” Hermione said in a pained little whisper. “Listen, I know how you feel, I really do. But… if we go back there then everything he’s done, all he sacrificed, it would all be for nothing. Please, tell me you understand that?”
“Severus, naturally, who has been helping you all along. He cares much for you, he would not let you die… and your other friend, of course. Potter.”
“I see.” Draco could constantly feel the slippery, cold tendrils drilling into his mind. “Have you made a mistake, Draco? Messed your little scheme up?”
“No, you’ve made your choice a long time ago,” Harry snarled. Draco reacted as if he’d hit him, his gaze falling back to the floor. “You told me, all those months ago, do you remember? You told me this is what you wanted. Well, Malfoy, you got it. Your beloved Voldemort will be happy with you at last. Maybe he will even stop torturing you for a second to tell you how well you’ve done.” He was so upset, he nearly drew no pleasure from the collective trembling that went through the room when he said their master’s name.
“He was so good,” Harry said suddenly, and was horrified to hear his voice breaking. “He was so smart and kind and he bloody cared about me, Malfoy. He was…” he could only really whisper now, but he had to carry on: “He was the only one I could write to…”
“That’s what he’s told you, here! How can you be so sure it is the truth? How do you know what he told Snape isn’t true? That the moment he hears you can’t save his mum, he’ll turn around and stab me in the back?” There was no more room for politeness in his talk.
“Potter…” Draco expelled a long-suffering sigh. “I know what you’re trying to do here. I appreciate it, but really, there's no need. You told me about my mother, and now you brought me these papers about her, so your debt is definitely paid. You don’t need to feel guilty about riling me up anymore. You’re all good.”
“I need to ask you something. I know you’re in shock, I know it’s – I know all of it is a lot, all right? But we have to talk about it before your boyfriend comes back. It’s about… the connection between you two.”
“Please,” Draco whispered, bending his head down. “Potter, please let me.” He won’t be able to face the night on his own. Not after all the stress, and with being in this unfamiliar environment. Not after the previous three nights. He just won’t.
It was nearly morning when they spoke again. Draco had been awake for a while, trying not to make a sound as the pain potion he was probably given was fading and the agony – strong but manageable until now – was flaring up bout by bout. Only when it was truly impossible not to he moved, a tiny adjusting of his position, enough to startle his mother awake. “What is it?” she asked immediately, and Draco loved her so much he felt ill.
“Right, it was just that my house is closer to St. Mungo’s, and he might need to be monitored – with the bond as well – “
. But now… he had no idea what he’s going to find in there, now. Back when He was alive Draco always knew. Back when He was alive, and Draco barely was. Back when He was alive and there was the floor and being quiet and dying a little every day in trying to please. Back when He was alive –
Harry snorted, but Draco was too astounded to laugh. He knew that statement for the complete poppycock it was; his mother detested talking about private matters. And feelings? She’d be more comfortable dining with Satan. She was doing it for him.
“Well I don’t want exactly what they have,” he rolled his eyes as though Draco was the one being ridiculous. “I just meant the extent of – no, actually, screw that, okay? Draco, all I want is you. Honestly. I don’t care how, I don’t care when, I just… you’re what I want.”
“It’s my pleasure. Well, Daniel, I’m sure your office paramour will not stay indifferent to this gorgeous bouquet. From my experience, no one does.” Just to be extra sure, Draco smiled into the flowers until they were even brighter than before. He didn’t often use his magic, which was shaky and ragged and out of his control even if he did have a wand. But for this man, this true and dear friend, he was damned if he will not do his very best. The wandless spell seemed to work this time, which might have been a fluke, or a true sign of how bloody insane he was getting.
It was far, far less terrible than he’d imagined, because he was constantly surrounded by people who made him feel safe. Harry didn’t let go of him for one bloody minute (literally. He literally didn’t let go of him for the space of a literal minute). Pansy kept very close, and Theo and Blaise too, and Mother was always in the area, and even Ron and Hermione came by more than several times to make sure he was all right, looking incredible in white and gold, Hermione’s beaming face radiant, Ron’s every freckle gleaming with happiness. Draco’s left hand was clenched around his wand the whole time, and those he loved were there to help.
Harry blanched. “What? Draco, no. Of course not. I told you before, I’m never going to… I won’t punish you. That’s not how things work between us. I promise.”
they come here all the time? Even people as good as them would tire at some point. They didn’t owe him anything, they never even liked him. Why were they still here?
“Oh, really? What did they do?” Potter brought two interested eyes back to him, and Draco nearly choked on a piece of fish in his mouth.
No, not anyone. He was quick to rectify this terrible mistake in his head, but apparently the gods of chance did not accept take-backs. The door opened just at that moment, and into the shop entered none other than Harry Bloody Potter.
“Just… when you said you lived here alone, it felt like you were lying. And then when you said you don’t like eating alone, I kind of… I thought there was someone in the picture, and that you weren’t telling me about him. I’m sorry, I don’t mean to go all Auror on you. I was just curious.”
Scowling, Draco nodded and they walked beyond the drawing room. Draco wasn’t aware he was holding his breath until he had to release it in order to cast the spell. Holding his wand at the next door along, he was using the same incantation as Granger was a landing above them, though he couldn’t have known that. Weasley looked at him with surprise.
“I’m not proving a damn thing!” Draco found himself yelling, but he almost didn’t care. “I have no idea what you want from me!”
“Maybe,” Potter conceded, looking beat. “I don’t know. I’ll… we’ll see, okay? It’s not like I’m in a mad rush to date. There’s work to think about, and Ron and Hermione with their wedding, and there’s – well, you.”
For some reason, Malfoy looked absolutely mortified. He didn’t argue, though, as Snape walked past his desk and looked at the students starting up with their potions. With a slightly shaky hand, Malfoy picked up a knife and started chopping up beetle heads.
Then it zoomed right into his face; the whole plastic casing and the flowers inside it, roots and all, crashed into his nose. Draco released the loudest gasp in existence and ran inside to grab a glass and fill it with water. There was no time for a second attempt with his magic. He needed to make sure what he does now is right, and if his estimation is correct, he probably had under a minute to make it work before it’s too late.
“I’m sorry, Malfoy. I wish I knew sooner. I wish I could do something to help.” Harry could hardly even look at him now, his face was excruciating to watch. He averted his glance instead to the sliver of white arm showing, eyes narrowing when he glimpsed a white line on the pale skin. But then Draco spoke and he lost focus.
to do it. The phoenix in the hall knew that; it gave him a sharp-beaked, buttony-eyed sort of admonishing look that turned the contents of his stomach to ashes. There was a strong sense of wrong coming from the painting, and Draco could feel the gravity of the
“You need to know, Potter. You need to know what the Dark Lord tasked me to do. I need to tell you.”
He must have been dreaming; there was no way in living hell Malfoy was dancing the waltz with Voldemort in a ballroom, wearing a long lacey dress. Although he knew it was a dream, Harry couldn’t help but crumble with the unbelievable agony, falling to the floor as pair after pair of masked Death Eaters entered the room and started dancing around him. Wailing in pain, unable to get up, Harry could only watch as they drew nearer and nearer, led by Draco and Voldemort who were dancing ever faster, and Voldemort was spinning Draco in a speed that was actually sickening…
rug in the bedroom. A seventies-looking kitchen, and then this living room looks like a museum – and who has a security camera in their flat? I bet you he’s a porn star. Or in the mafia, or something, I don’t know.”
“Get ready,” Harry glanced behind his shoulder, then took some ridiculous fighting stance facing the door. Draco thought it was the most idiotic thing he’d ever seen. Harry couldn’t even use magic.
“What on earth is going on?” he asked, genuinely concerned. His anger was gone, replaced by panic. Had he hit him so hard? How could he possibly have caused so much damage? “Stop struggling, you idiot, let me see,” he said as he tried to pull the blond’s shirt up. “Come on, let me – what the fuck?”
“This is a mobile phone,” Potter explained patiently. “It’s a communication method. A Muggle communication method.”
“Oh god, I’m sorry. I thought – I wanted to call you a million times, but I didn’t want to pressure you. I thought the notes would be – I’m sorry, that was such a stupid idea.”
No, he couldn’t find it in him to deal with this right now. “If you’re not going to leave by the end of the sentence, I beg you not to finish it. I – it’s already so much. Please don’t make it worse.” Harry sighed heavily, but he remained silent, and Draco was grateful. At least that. “What new things did you discover about him?”
for him to do anymore. What did it even mean, what he deserved? Was there some god of karma somewhere dishing out punishments and rewards? Did it fucking mean anything, what he did, what he got? Was there ever any order to it, any proportion? The answer was no. A big, fat, hairy fucking no. Draco paid so much for the murder of a man who was still alive. He mauled himself into ruins for the hurt his father suffered at the hands of others. And the crimes he had committed, because he did, many of them – did he even pay for them yet? Who could bloody say? It was meaningless, the whole thing was meaningless, and – and – and Draco was not going to do that anymore. No. He wasn’t. He just wasn’t.
For a second he had to close his eyes, the feeling was so unnerving. Once again it was a mistake; the moment he did so the weapons began to speak to him, whispering in terrible hisses of the misfortune they brought countless others. He nearly covered his ears with his hands, willing the curse to pass, for he knew it was only a game his father was playing with him. Without much thinking he grabbed Granger’s hand and pressed softly. He didn’t know if she is also prey to these nightmares, or if his father is torturing him alone. He did not turn to look at her face. She pressed back.
“I thought you said we were enemies. I thought you said you wanted to attack me, and I had already hit you several times. Why would you come here, knowing full well I’m going to be armed, without your bloody wand?”
“Goodbye, Draco,” Potter snarled, then he turned on his heel and left. Draco was far, far too stunned to try and even think of what just happened between them. He could not
Malfoy yanked his arm from Harry’s hold violently. “I never meant for any of this to happen! I never thought it will – fuck, I never thought that I – and then you came along with your bloody golden boy ways, and I was absolutely helpless – gods help me, Potter, you’ve ruined everything!”
He did - enclosing his arms around Harry’s back and leaning his head on Harry’s shoulder, Draco sort of melted into him. Harry held as tightly as he dared without choking him, and even that didn’t feel like enough. He needed to feel him, to taste him again - every inch of his body was burning with desire. But he knew Draco was crushed, and so miserable, and so afraid and alone; that sadness actually brought tears to his eyes. He was furious, still, but now with himself as well, for letting Draco go through this by himself for such a long time. He was still mad at him, of course, but he could tell that it would slowly transform into something more manageable. Right now he couldn’t focus on the anger. He had to be a man of his word. He had to support the fuck out of him, even if only so that he would be able to yell at him all he wants later. And also, perhaps more importantly - because Draco’s pain absolutely broke his heart, even more so than his betrayal. Confused and sad and annoyed, Harry buried his head in Draco’s neck, unsuccessfully trying to suppress his own sobs.
stop me with virtual nothing. I was being such an idiot and I’m so sorry I didn’t… I should have known. I put you through hell for absolutely nothing.”
“He’s still not letting you have it?” Harry asked incredulously. It was just such an inconceivable thing to do, to take someone’s wand away from them. He could just as well have taken Malfoy’s arm; the wand was a part of him, if not the most important part.
Malfoy lowered his gaze to his knees, and he looked so sad, it hurt in Harry’s chest. “Yes, it’s been fine.” His voice was completely flat. Harry cleared his throat.
Oh, gods. He really screwed everything up, hasn’t he? All this time, all these months… lying to Harry, fucking with his mind, and look what it did to him. Draco had so many opportunities to push him away, to make sure he leaves, keep him away from danger. And what did he do in each one of these opportunities? He pulled him ever closer, because Draco was selfish. Because he needed someone, and he didn’t care who he might hurt.
“No!” he exclaimed in horror, eyes turning between his two friends. “No, we haven’t done that yet! We just – just a little bit of – “ but he really wasn’t going to explain any further, and in any case, Malfoy decided now was the right time to follow them out, and he stopped next to Harry.
“Yes, we should.” Harry turned to leave, when a thought crossed his frozen mind. “Do you know where my mother is, by the way?”
“Draco…” he couldn’t resist the tone, though; his eyes zoomed back to Harry’s green. “Nothing is going to happen to you. After we’re quite sure you’re not going to have to do anything – drastic – because of the bond, you can go… home. You’re welcome to stay at Grimmauld for as long as you like, or you could – I mean, you have plenty of options. You won’t have to hide anymore, and no one is going to hurt you. I won’t – there won’t be any – you’re going to be just fine.”
No, not a river – perhaps a stream; the more he looked at it, the smaller it got, until it was only a faint blue line snaking off in the distance. Draco tried, but couldn’t see its end. It had no end. He looked around – there was something eerie and unsettling about the whole place, especially with the thick fog covering the banks either side. It made him feel strangely exposed.
“Thanks, Malfoy. I’m… that’s nice. It’s still the weirdest bloody thing ever, but it is nice.” He cleared his throat and brushed a sleeve past his eyes. “See you around, I guess?”
“I said you wouldn’t know love if it bit you in your snaky arse,” Potter spat, and Draco gasped. Such blatant disrespect – but surely he will be punished for it, he will be made to hurt, and Draco wanted to warn him – to protect him – but there was nothing to do; he could not move, and only they controlled the pain.
“Yeah, mad, isn’t it? At first everything went dark, then suddenly her blood began to glow – just in the cauldron, then in her too, you could see every vessel glowing, it was insane – and then she suddenly went up in flames. Snape’s jaw literally fell to the floor. I don’t think it was meant to happen.”
Gods, Potter was being dense. Draco wanted to smother him, him and those big, earnest green lanterns of his. Instead he laughed, and the sound was both foreign and jarring to his ears. “It’s not as easy as it sounds. There are many restrictions on parolees like me, and not everyone would be willing to sell me a wand anyway.”
That was unexpected enough to make Draco’s head pop up and look at Harry. “From school? I – of course, yes, why?”
“No – what – Malfoy! Your mother nearly fainted. Pansy Parkinson bawled her eyes out. They wrote about your suicide for weeks in the Daily Prophet. And all this time you were what,
“Grove – he was in the breakout reports. The one where your – the one from last week. His name was in those reports.” Harry looked pretty ill as well. Draco squinted his eyes at him, unable to look for some reason.
“All right. In the meantime… here we go. I won't give you a warning, okay?” Harry nodded and waited. He found that it was easier when he closed his eyes, so he did, and he concentrated on his breathing.
Harry’s grin only grew wider. “Is that right? What could I do to rectify that, sir?” he moved quickly, straddling Malfoy’s lap, arms stretching around his back. Malfoy’s arms shot immediately to hold him, his eyes twinkling.
“No, I’d say she’s not,” he replied. It took a moment until he turned around to face him. “What are you doing, Harry? Get back under, now.”
Draco was too stunned to reply straightaway. He had to take some very limited breaths. “Who said we had to be equal? He saved me, Potter. He deserved some more from me. It was only right.”
Harry nodded, and there was such gentleness in that gesture, it made his chest burn. “All right. I’ll just hop in the shower, then I could – I dunno, go sleep somewhere else or something.”
Not for more food, not for anything – no chance, not now. He wasn’t too paralyzed with fear this time, wasn’t even spelled frozen. They thought they had him, that starvation and humiliation and pain and
“I’m sure you know, Harry, why it is that we are here. It is Draco’s wish to refuse Lord Voldemort’s orders and keep his mother out of harm’s way. I am glad you came to me, even though it of course would have been favorable had it happened sooner.” Harry felt his cheeks burn and started mumbling something, but Dumbledore had already moved on. “I must confess to you as well, Harry, that at the moment there isn’t much we can do for Narcissa. We shall endeavor to make contact, and if the opportunity arises we will aid in her escape in any way possible. I will, of course, keep you updated.”
Potter’s soft laughter was like silver fucking bells. “Draco, I don’t know if I’ve quite… thanked you yet. For – well, for all of it.”
Potter laughed, and Draco could relax a little from his wound-up state. “Rubbish. Have you seen yourself? You’d look good in anything.” He took a few successive short breaths. “All right. I’m leaving, then. You got everything you need? Phone’s at the ready? Remember which keys to press to get me?”
Draco was far too broken and stunned to do anything but obey. The portkey glimmered and shook, and an uncomfortable moment later they were in a flat that looked recognizable, yet wasn’t the one Draco expected to see. It wasn’t His. Must have really been a hallucination. What –
“I’m afraid what I don’t have enough of is patience for this conversation. Shut it right now, I don’t want to hear about it. Dear gods, Potter, you’re incorrigible.”
In the first few minutes he didn’t even notice the quiet, so busy was he screaming at himself in his head and cursing his own stupidity. But after a while, when he reached the forest, he noticed. There was no one else around, no one else for possibly miles. The nearest Muggle residence was fifteen miles away, and this was all private property (Mother never told him where she got the gold to rent it). Harry, probably biting his nails bloody, was all the way back at the cottage. And so Draco was alone, in this place he didn’t really know, and
He shook himself out of his reverie and looked at Ron, who was smirking. “Sorry, did you say something?”
Harry’s hand made some uncertain movements, as if it didn’t quite know if it wanted to touch him or not. Fat tears rolled down his mournful face as he whispered, “Draco…”
“Say that He did. I’m not – I’m sorry, Harry, but I’m struggling to understand the relevance. We just learned He’s a mass murderer. Why does it matter if…?”
Harry threw him a dirty look, but if he was being honest, Malfoy was most probably right. Hermione would be spending every minute she can studying. And Ron was at the Burrow with the excellent food cooked by Mrs. Weasley, so chances were he was spending a lot of his time wolfing it down. “What do you think Crabbe and Goyle are doing?”
Another anxious moment passed before he could hear the rustling of magic and Potter materialized in front of him. “How did you know I was there?”
Malfoy resisted, but only for a minute. “I’m sure it’ll be just as sore on the eyes as the way you’ve decorated the Room,” he said disdainfully as he followed Harry up the stairs. “All red and mismatched like. But oh well, if I must sacrifice my delicate senses in order to keep up with you…” his scornful look only intensified when the fat lady’s portrait moved and they found themselves in the common room. “Just as I thought,” he muttered, his eyes catching all the golden-red banners and lion symbols. “It’s gruesome.”
Filch was muttering something in the background, but Harry was too busy watching Malfoy’s face become a darker shade of pink as his lips parted in rage. Whatever nasty thing he was going to say was forever lost on his lips, though, when another figure emerged into the hallway.
“I don’t think so, Harry Potter, sir. Dobby can see where they are without Mr. Malfoy noticing. He can take you there, too.”
Harry shrugged, because although he knew it was true, there wasn't much he could do about it. “He’s been trying to murder me ever since I was a year old. Nothing’s really changed. There’s nothing I can do but try to fight him.” The blond didn’t reply, and Harry sunk into his own thoughts. Then a question occurred to him. “How do you know that, though?”
“Yes. But – but maybe I could talk to Dr. Mars myself. Try to get… to do it slower, or something. I don’t know. Dr. Radford is good, I guess, but she doesn’t know the magic around it well enough, so…”
was probably just late in His meetings with the other men. Meetings that Draco had zero interest in, naturally. He'd been burned enough by sticking his nose where it didn’t belong, and that was a mistake he was not likely to ever make again. So yes. It must be a meeting keeping Him away, because He wouldn’t leave him.
doing that – touching Draco in that way – it made his head reel. “I’m sorry, Harry… I couldn’t stand it…”
“I scraped the wall.” He seemed like he couldn’t care less. Harry bit back an impatient response and simply stared at him.
He snapped back to reality. “Yes, sorry. I’m not going anywhere, I just… wanted to bring you more water.”
– well, loved it, he definitely loved it. Potter may have felt the sudden hesitation in him, for he gently detached himself from Draco’s lips and struggled to open his eyes.
A few shots later, Harry got to the conclusion that Firewhiskey was probably one of the best things in the world. He was sprawled on the sofa, Malfoy sitting somewhere next to his feet, head on the armrest. The room was spinning lightly around him, but he wasn’t fazed in the least. Instead he was really quite happy. The warm glow in his chest made everything seem so much better. No danger could really get past the golden haze inside him; nothing stopped him, nothing worried him. He was completely and absolutely free.
Excellent change of subject, Draco complimented him in his heart, but of course that’s not what he said. “Boo-hoo,” he mocked instead. “Little Potty needs his nap time?” though his mouth, the fucking traitor, tore in a yawn as well.
“I’m sorry,” he said, and it almost sounded genuine though he refused to look at any of them still. “I really am sorry. But you know I have to do this. I have no choice.”
“I can see your other hand going for your wand. I’ll have you know the vial is uncharmable; you cannot summon or levitate it, you can’t break it and you can’t physically remove it from my hand. It is spelled against all that. Test me, and I will show you. I don’t particularly want to die today, but I will do it just to spite you.”
Potter’s face conveyed such a deep sense of agony, Draco could feel it without having to look. “I’m so sorry. I shouldn’t have barged in like that. I – I wasn’t thinking. I’m sorry.”
“Sorry,” Harry hurried to say, aghast. He must have been as white as a sheet, and he could feel his heart racing inside him fifty times its normal speed. He wanted to be there for Draco, he really did, but he just wasn’t certain he could take it. Lowering his eyes to the ground he tried to stabilize his breathing.
“You always say that,” Harry said quizzically. “Rising from the ashes, the whole phoenix chat. It’s – Draco, you’re not a phoenix. You’re not dead. You don’t need to be reborn.”
Draco looked relieved, the unbelievable fool, and Harry loved him so much he felt delirious. The weight of the ring on his finger was tangible proof, a physical evidence that this was really happening.
“It says – it says Harry!” Draco exclaimed. Potter’s smile did that thing it sometimes does, where it goes really-really soft all at once, and Draco’s stomach reacted automatically with a little dance.
“Hey,” Harry said softly, but it was still enough to make Malfoy jump. He turned around quickly, exhaling with relief when Harry took off the cloak and revealed himself. “What are you doing here?”
“Right.” Rather abashed, Harry quickly cleared his throat and mastered his face into a serious expression. “Okay, Malfoy. Let’s practice. You can tell me all about what’s going on with you later.” He was still breathing harshly, though, when Malfoy raised his wand.
Harry’s tone was careful. “If you want. You can talk about anything. Hell, the first three sessions all I talked about was cooking.” Draco was going to protest, but something Harry said gave him pause.
“Even if I was into hideous, four-eyed prats,” Malfoy proclaimed evenly, “don’t flatter yourself. And don’t worry: I will never look in your direction again, your highness. I see you have gone a little paranoid of late. I wonder why that is.”
Malfoy laughed, and Harry could feel the tension slowly leaving his body. if the Slytherin isn’t bothered by what’s happened last night, maybe he shouldn’t be either. He felt courageous enough to look at him. “I was thinking, Potter, I should ask for my wand back. I think there is a chance Snape will agree now, seeing how… well, I just think he might. And then we could practice Occlumency, and… the other things.”
“No, you did nothing wrong,” Potter finally deigned to look at him. “Okay? Nothing. I’m… I’m sorry, I can’t think very straight right now, I think the wine has affected me some. Is it all right if we, er, carry on this conversation tomorrow?”
Draco groaned and buried his face in his hands. “Gods damn it to pieces, Potter. Could you maybe not be a perfect fucking prick for a second? You’re insufferable.” A small chuckle made him groan even louder. “I mean it.”
Which maybe was enough, because Draco felt his smile tugging the edge of his lips, and realized that his life might actually be going in the right direction, for once.
“On your way home. Did you notice anything out of the ordinary on your walk? Perhaps saw something you didn’t expect to see?”
“Sure,” Harry said, and for a second Malfoy looked so sad he found himself itching to touch him again. But he fought down the urge and cleared his throat. “Now, Dumbledore did basically say I’m in charge. So I guess we should meet every week or something, just to catch up. Oh, and I want you to eat like a normal person again, okay? I think you’ve actually lost more weight this week.”
Draco looked at the floor in an attempt to find some relief. Thinking of a young, lost, lonely Potter wasn’t something he could do so easily. “What did you say?”
“I did not leave, you know where I have been. And if all is going according to plan, why have you come here? You did not think you deserve a reward for a plan halfway done?” Lucius’s anger was cold and distant. Draco hated that more than anything in the world. Well, more than almost anything.
“You’re far braver than I,” Harry left it with that nonsensical remark. Draco sighed. The absolute, pure fright running down his veins in such intensity meant he couldn’t even feel he was afraid anymore.
Draco raised his eyes to him. Potter was confused; instead of laying the blame on him, like he should have been doing, he was looking for excuses. Draco smiled softly; he was at fault with that same offence too many times before. “No, Potter. It wasn’t their responsibility. They did their best, but they didn't have a choice by then – it was me, my own stupid actions that led me to be in his possession. Only me… I’m sorry for being such a masochist.” He didn’t mean to blurt out that last sentence, but habit forced it and it was too late to take back now.
“I doubt I would, Golden Boy and all,” Harry rolled his eyes but still looked pained. “But yeah, I guess if it came to that… I don’t know, that’s all I’m saying. I just don’t know.”
They stayed there in silence for a while. Draco looked at the ceiling, and Harry just breathed, like he could kneel all day for all he cared. Draco knew from experience he actually would. He hated him, sometimes.
“You’re cute ‘s well,” he attempted, but all the words kind of jumbled into one and he couldn’t try to say more, just stare up happily at the pale face. Malfoy was looking at him with such tenderness, he was absolutely on cloud nine. Nothing could be better than this.
“Oh, I think I do. I think I know you very, very well. How many years now have you been bullying everyone around? How many years have you made it your mission to make me miserable?” Harry could feel it all swelling inside him: all the years of being mistreated, all the times he humiliated him, the injustice of it all … Snape always taking his side… Snape, in general… and Sirius… “How many times have you proved that you are nothing but a selfish, scared, evil fucking psychopath?”
Draco had to try and make him understand, however impossible it may seem, however hard it was to form a coherent thought. “There were certain… elements… which were out of my hands. There are things I can’t control – “
“Well you should let me do something for you, then. Not cooking or cleaning, obviously, because I’m rather inept at those departments. Something else.”
“But you didn’t want to,” he said, and he couldn’t quite keep the misery out of his voice. He tried so hard all day, and then he was stupid enough to let this happen. How could he do this? how could he let himself? “You said you didn’t want to. I - I made you do it.” He tried not to sound like it was the end of the world, but he kind of felt like it was.
“You just need to make the right choice,” he said in a whisper when Snape was far enough. Malfoy’s eyes shot so wide, Harry felt a jolt of fear in his gut.
“And what about you two?” Harry asked, a little concerned. “You can’t really show your faces there any more than I can.”
“There were several times, yes,” he answered in a level tone. “Usually not as bad as the last one, but I’ve sported a broken arm for a while.”
“It’s because Draco stopped taking the magic-dampening potions. They would have been inhibiting your own magic all this time… and we didn’t know.”
Harry chewed on his lip for a little while, staring at the flames. God, how he wished Sirius’s face would pop out of them right now and give him some advice in his bark-like voice. It was with a pang that he realized he hadn’t been thinking about Sirius as much these past few weeks. It was a weird, painful feeling in his gut. He felt like he might be sick.
“Let’s – “ Harry pulled him up and looked everywhere, frantic. “Umm, the bedroom, let’s go there.” And without another word he dragged Draco across the living room and basically hurled him inside, slamming the door shut after them. Draco’s eyes skirted over the bearskin rug and the four-poster bed, and saw absolutely nothing. His heart hammered in his chest so hard it must have been showing in the fabric of his shirt.
, too much darkness, too much sweat-covered-nightmares and barely-healed-scars that affected his waking hours just as much as his sleep when prompted. To show someone all of that just wasn’t something he was programmed to do. For years he was trained relentlessly to shut his mouth. Screw that; his whole life he was taught to bottle everything down, to keep a tight lid on it all and place it somewhere even he won’t remember. How was he meant to override all of that and just… what, talk about it? The very idea seemed ludicrous.
“And what, if I may ask, spurred this sudden change?” the fire glimmered in his grey eyes, yet they remained quite blank. His father was always so good at detachment.
Draco couldn’t hear anything after that. All he could think of was how He betrayed him, how completely and totally He did. It was a very devastating sort of betrayal, too. For even if he could put aside the whole Dark Lord thing, even if Draco was happy to be His – well, His pet, probably, if he’s being honest – teaming up with
“No, Hermione – wait – “ but it was too late; she had already closed the door behind them. Harry could only give Malfoy a quick look before he leapt to his feet and ran after them. “Hermione, Ron, wait!”
He woke up every few minutes, glancing up, and there she was. She must have been lying on the bed with him, and her fingers left a buzzing sensation on his skin, but he would not move away for the world. She didn’t say anything, just looked at him, as if she could never have her fill. As if she would be quite content just looking at him for the rest of her life, like this was all she wanted in the world. Draco understood completely.
“We had better only take them in the very last second, so we’re not wasting any time. Remember the potion will only give us about an hour. Now, about the cloak. I’m sorry, Harry, I just don’t think it’s big enough to cover the five of us.”
Potter smirked. “It’s ravioli, and you’re going to love it. I also brought risotto and some gnocchi. If you don’t lick your fingers after your plate is done, I will clean your house for a whole week.”
He didn’t even know what it was they wanted, but he knew he can’t give it. Give in now, and he’d lose everything. This was the very last thing still in him, his last
“But – Grove isn’t dead,” Harry said, confused, and Draco wanted nothing more than to run to him and hide in his arms forever. Well, maybe he just wanted to run, period.
“It was just – it was pretty,” Draco nodded, a bitter taste in his mouth. “Let’s go back. I’m sorry.” They made their way in heavy, panting silence, and Draco felt so bad that by the time they got back he actually had to excuse himself to the loo, where he threw up dinner (he made ravioli that night, before he went on his walk. Harry blatantly lied and said it rivaled with the little place by the Ministry. Thinking about it made Draco hurl even harder; Harry was so
“Do you remember when I told you how I nearly, er, committed suicide?” Draco’s insides were performing a circus trick, presumably involving tight rope and flaming loops. It was highly distracting. “I wasn’t exactly honest with you. I didn’t
“I believe so, Father.” Draco wasn’t meeting his father’s eyes, either. He kept his low on the ground, seemingly unable to keep them in one place; it almost looked like he was searching the room. Harry noticed he was intently not looking at his mother.
It was a fascinating experience, discovering all his different body parts as each of them ached rather singularly, but he didn’t have the time. The face returned, and some baffling seconds later Draco found himself propped up to sitting. He would have slumped right back down if there wasn’t something at his back – a wall. Draco blinked again at the now visible room.
“Oh, that’s obviously not what I meant!” Hermione said with dignity. “I meant if they’ve been learning Occlumency!”
What was most terrifying was the gleam in the grey eyes as the man looked at him. Terrifying, because it was very much not so. “I don’t understand. Has – has the dragon eaten her?”
“You must understand,” He said, this time to Draco. “After what happened – after that night when you finally started seeing reason – I’m afraid the damage Lucius suffered had been… irreparable.” He looked at Lucius’s empty eyes. “He went out of his mind. Tried to attack Parker – actually put him in a coma for a couple of months. He was a danger to himself and to others, Draco. I had no choice. I had to remove his memories.”
“I’m fine,” Draco said, which was perhaps the furthest away from the truth he’d been in years. “What are you doing here?”
“Very well. I shall see you tomorrow in class, Draco. Remember to keep your mind closed and not to let Dumbledore see a single thing. I cannot stress how important it is to ensure he does not find out any details of the plan. He must never learn you are, in fact, working on your task at the very moment.”
“Nothing – I must have cut myself over something – “ Weasley put his finger in his mouth, and Draco saw a bead of blood disappear. He groaned with exasperation.
There was no warning this time, but Harry was somewhat better prepared. The memories seemed blurry, like a poor-quality video; things were jumping rather unintelligibly around. Harry recognized with some difficulty that he was looking at the graveyard, at Cedric’s dead body. Then Voldemort was in front of him, and his red eyes were suddenly sharpening and becoming almost too close, too real –
“God, you’re such a prat,” Harry buried his face in his hands, annoyed. It was when they were finally together and speaking that Harry felt least certain about wanting to help the boy in the first place. Malfoy was just so… he took a deep breath. “Listen, I know you said over and over that you don’t need my help, but I think you do. I know Crabbe and Goyle can’t help you, because they are reporting back home.”
Draco snorted. “I don’t think so. You want to get me, you can come right here and take me in person.” It was a very exceptional experience, to speak in Harry’s deep voice.
“I see. Well, it’s as much as I suspected, but… okay. I think – and please don’t be mad at me, all right? I’ve been thinking about it for a while now. You know how you said you’d been marked? I know you didn’t want to hear it before, but Draco, I really think that the tattoo – sort of – binds you to him. Not in the same way Voldemort’s did, obviously, but that it created some sort of connection. And maybe it even lets him – I don’t know, gives him some power over you, makes it impossible for you to refuse him. Makes it so you won’t be able to go against him. Because you so obviously wanted to, Draco, but for some reason you just... couldn't. I mean, I might be shooting in the dark here, but the fact he knows so much… How else can you explain it?”
"You know there was never actual poison in that bracelet, Draco. You know it wasn't real. Surely you would have caught on by now."
“Okay, Harry, so maybe he was,” Ron said cautiously. “Maybe You-Know-Who is really threatening his mum. But then that doesn’t solve the problem of the mission he got from him. You can’t honestly trust Malfoy when he’s literally told you he’s going to serve him.”
The new Defence against the Dark Arts teacher was a thin young woman with a black ponytail and very serious, deep-set eyes. Harry, who’d missed her introduction at the feast last night, got quickly filled in by Ron that her name was Professor Electra, and that she used to be an auror serving at the same unit as Tonks before accepting the job at Hogwarts.
He could hear the smile in his best friend’s voice. “I’m glad for you, mate. Really, I am. Who would have thought that it would be Malfoy, right?” Harry shook his head, chuckling.
“I think you have, yes, once or twice. It was stronger than me, though, you know. Family trait.” He gave an involuntary little wince. “I got a letter this week,” he said in a very by-the-way tone. Harry wasn’t fooled.
Draco shook his head. “I don’t think – I don’t know. All my thoughts were my own. After she was taken… well, even if there was a spell there, I don’t think it would have made too much of a difference.” He sniffled. “Professor, will she be all right?”
Draco was so close to tears he was startled. The last thing he wanted was to hurt Potter. Potter who’s already done so much for him. “Please don’t worry about it. I’m fine, really. Hey, at least now I’ll probably remember to lock the door when I come in.”
“Th-thank you, Mr. Draco, sir,” he stammered, and then returned his gaze to Harry. “Is Harry Potter – friends with Mr. Draco now?”
“Malfoy – what are you doing?” Weasley shouted, trying to pull him back, but Draco was completely entranced by the figure before him and would not listen. He didn’t think he’d ever see him again, not alive. He didn’t think – nor did he want to, if he was being honest. But seeing his father now did not make him think of that night. He was sure it will. He thought he’d never be able to see Lucius again without thinking about it. But what he was actually thinking about right now was the Manor when it used to be their home, and flying together under blue sky, and
Draco knew about guns – He told him all about them. Such a riddle that man was; for someone who spoke so much about life and healing, He was fascinated by death to an extent that was genuinely frightening. Raised by Muggles, or so Draco figured from the very little He’d told him, He knew all about the extravagant ways they invented to off one other. Draco heard about guns and cannons, lances and bombs, landmines and tanks. To be honest, it made him a little ill. There was a spark in the dark of His eyes that lit when they discussed it, and Draco didn’t like it at all. It’s not like he needed a reminder that He was a – well – that He was drawn to that type of thing. Draco knew he had every reason to be afraid. It was just that besides fucking terrifying, He was also his whole life, and so it hardly mattered. Draco loved Him with all of his heart. Fear was constrained in second place, down there in his gut, and could not compete. He knew the truth, which was above all else; there could never be anyone who would know Draco the way He does and still care for him.
“No,” he panted, although it felt a little cruel. Under no circumstances would he let Draco go face Death Eaters on his own. Under no circumstances would he leave him defenseless like that. “I’m sorry, but you’re not going there alone. It’s either with me, or not at all.”
money than he should by the end of the day, He would only get suspicious. Someone else had better come along, so he can slip them the extra. Someone come along now, he thought loudly, aiming his energy towards the street. Anyone.
“It’s not that. I have no doubt he’s strong if he’s managed to spook you like that. It’s just… damn, Draco, I missed you so much.”
“I didn’t know,” she said, half-pleading. “Not really. I thought I was seeing things, ghosts again – I still see them everywhere, you know. Nymphadora, Ted, they’re all around. And when I saw – when I thought I saw someone who looked like… I didn’t believe it, not really. Cissa was already at such a state, that for her sake, I thought the best thing to do was… when Harry told me he was going to Lily’s grave the day after I thought it couldn’t really hurt. I had no doubt that he’d know for certain – and that if he were to find you, I’d hear about it soon enough. Harry never was able to shut up when it came to you. So when he just came by the following week I took it as a sign I had been right, that it wasn’t… gods, Draco, I’m so sorry.”
Another glance at the window – must be around three in the morning. What the fuck kept Him so long? Draco’s mind was absolutely spinning, and the ache in his abdomen steadily grew worse. What did he do to spur this reaction? Sure, what happened today was outrageous – nearing unforgivable – but surely not enough to keep Him away? Draco ran shaky fingers over his bracelet, trying to sober somewhat, a difficult thing to achieve through the numbing pain. The cuff bracelet was made out of two interlocking loops of silver, one thick and polished smooth, the second thinner and wavy. The way the two bands clanged against each other was calming to his frayed nerves, and with a few well-practiced breathes he could attempt to think again. Was His absence in some way connected to Potter? Could He be afraid of him enough to run away? The thought nearly made him smile. No, not scared then, but if so, what was it? It couldn't be that He was trying to hurt Potter, could it? To make good on His promise to Draco,
Suddenly they were too far apart, and Draco took the few steps to Harry’s bed like a man possessed. “What’s wrong?” Harry asked immediately, his voice rough with weariness, and Draco just – he just – with a flick of Harry’s wand he stretched the bed twice as wide and threw himself down next to Harry, now staring at him in utter shock. “Draco?”
“Do you think he’s trying to keep you out? Like Dumbledore said?” she whispered as they both bent their heads to him and Seamus and Neville started talking about the breakout again.
“Well, maybe not exactly innocent, but… well… I mean, you’ve not killed anyone. And you’ve not joined him, not yet. So there’s still hope for you. You can still be – “ he didn’t want to say it, but Malfoy did it for him.
“You are going to find out very soon what the Golden Boy can do,” Harry breathed, pointing his wand at him. “You wanted to do this, didn’t you? Well raise your wand, Malfoy. Now.”
– if anything, they’re going to give you a medal of honor. You won’t be facing any charges for that, you absolute git.”
“It’s not your fault,” Harry said, feeling like he’s stuck in some nightmarish loop. “He had to be believable, otherwise they never would have let him near us. He had time to think of what to do in that case, I suppose… we left him up there in the Room of Requirement to formulate his little plan…” he didn’t know why he was so furious. After all, Draco did all this for him, to save his life and his mother’s. He warned him he will do it, too. He made him promise… without realizing he was doing it, Harry clenched his hands into fists. The bloody idiot.
“They’ll try it again,” was all his lips were able to say. The more he thought about it, the more he realized he’s correct. Voldemort knew now what was the best way to hurt him and force his hand; he must have seen it in Harry when he thought he was about to die. There was no reason to think he will hesitate to do it again. “Professor, we must protect him. We have to keep him safe. If they try again – “ Harry stopped there, but he had a feeling they all knew what he wanted to say. I
“No you don’t, you son of a bitch,” Harry grunted, pulling him back, and the fighting resumed. Draco let his eyes close and relinquished his grip on these uncertain surroundings. It would probably be better if he took a little break from it all.
“I’ve been meaning to ask,” he said when he sat back down, and Draco opened wide grey eyes to him, “about… your tattoo.”
“It’s no trouble at all. I told you, I enjoy it.” Now Potter was on the other side of the door, and Draco was left without anything to say. “Good night, Malfoy.” And he was gone.
“Nonsense, Draco. We are family, after all. It may have been a surprise, but still a great opportunity to spend some time together.” She smiled menacingly, and Harry could feel the old hatred bubbling inside him, stirring his soul back from its stunned, frozen state. This was bad. This was very, very bad. One look at Hermione showed him what he already knew; they had absolutely no choice. So he followed the woman out of the room and into the deserted hallway, mind reeling.
Draco scoffed some color back to his cheeks. “You can’t lie for shit, Potter, but… thanks. I – thank you.” He didn’t know what else to say to that wonderful, wonderful man. That wonderful pillock who for some reason just kept coming back and didn’t walk away from him and didn’t leave him. That wonderful pillock that he…
“In fact, we will, and we can. Draco – I am here to warn you. if you will not cooperate with us by nightfall, our dear friends have been authorized full access to your every faculty. And with about – I don’t know, twenty or so men in the castle with very little place to
“Just lie down, all right? You need to rest. You’re not strong enough to be walking around like that. I really think you should be seen by a – “
He would have fallen straight to his knees and kissed the hem of his trousers if he didn’t catch himself just in time. “Thank you for – for that. I don’t think I can tell you how much it meant to me. I…” no, he really couldn’t. Potter made a move like he was about to touch him, but then just reached for the plates and started dishing out. Indian again. Draco’s stomach growled in approval.
“I really wish you’d stop calling me that,” Harry grunted, rubbing his eyes. “It’s starting to get on my nerves.”
Draco gulped the sea-air, fresh and crisp, and stared at the building unblinkingly. The rotten wooden beams had been replaced, the missing bricks relayed, the windows fixed – large and covered by a light curtain, currently drawn. There was even a little vegetable garden, just visible beyond the newly-refurbished fence. Draco could see the sea through the distant living room windows. He stood agape for a moment before he remembered Harry was there, too.
“Well, something’s definitely up. You’ve been out of your mind all week, and he seems so miserable. What was it? Did you fight?”
“Harry. Please.” He huffed, but quietened, and Draco found he really didn’t know what to say. His head was on fire, underwater, some fucking how, and this was far beyond dangerous. “There’s a lot about me you don’t know yet. There are – things – complications. I can’t ever really… I can’t love anyone, not fully. I’ve given you what I can, but I… I can’t give any more. I can’t give you my heart.”
“Thank you, Potter,” Malfoy said, again in that strangled voice. “I – really appreciate it. I know I don’t deserve it.”
Harry kissed back, warm and wet and choked, a little, and Draco laughed into his open mouth, laughed and cried and laughed, until – and he was such an
“After you kissed him.” He had to look at her now; she sounded so business-like, not at all stunned, like he was telling her something about the weather and not about how he went and kissed their all-time school rival. “Did he say anything? Did he kiss you back?”
Draco nodded to his plate, suddenly unable to look at him. “Yes, that – that could work.” The evening continued in a smooth, softly-sizzling-embers sort of atmosphere that had Draco absolutely dizzy and filled him with confusion all the way up to his eyebrows. All week Potter acted outright strange, and Draco just didn’t know what to make of it. The soft glances he’d been sneaking whenever he thought Draco was looking the other way. The absent smile that played on his lips. His body language suggesting all the time he was about to touch, yet never quite fulfilling that promise. Draco was almost bewildered enough to ask, but not all that brave. He just wanted to know what the fuck was going on, because something was
Draco shook his head and the fog cleared a tiny bit. This was a part of him, once. With this he did things – wonderful things, brilliant things, terrible things. For he was all that and more: wonderful, brilliant, terrible. There were tears in his eyes when he lifted his head. “My Lord?”
“I can only imagine,” Potter nodded encouragingly. “Really, I admire that. You are such a strong person, Malfoy. Strong and incredible. Even if you can’t cook for shit.”
“Incarcerous,” the man all but leered, and thin ropes struggled around Harry’s body, binding him tight.
A dull pain was developing behind his left eyebrow. “You’re joking, right? You can’t come back here. No one can know I’m alive, remember?” there it went again, that ring of impending doom in his ears… Gods, Potter was such an absolute pillock when he wasn’t busy World-Saving and everything.
As he assumed, his friends did not come by themselves. Dumbledore was at the door and he pulled it closed gently, his eyes lacking their usual glint. Harry didn’t care about that. He pushed Hermione softly away from his arms and faced the headmaster, who didn’t insult his intelligence with an empty smile. Instead he reached out and handed Harry a scroll. “You have a letter, Harry. It’s from Draco.”
with him romantically?” and Harry knew what the silence was; Snape was reaching into his mind. But why did Draco let him see that? Shouldn’t he try his best to hide it?
“Oh no you don’t,” Hermione placed a hand on one of his shoulders, Ron on the other. “Harry, you need to rest. You can see him later. The both of you have a lot of recovery to do – “
In a very surprising turn of events, He ignored Harry’s disrespect. No punishment was meted out, no scorching remark; His eyes were on Draco alone. “You can imagine, my love, what an achievement it was, for him to be able to concoct something that was only ever considered a myth. Such a feat of true ingenuity, such a remarkable show of his strength. To be the only wizard in existence with the ability to be reborn… And such a magnificent potion he was able to conceive, so powerful, so potent. The immortal ingredients; feathers of a phoenix in the prime of its life, scarab beetles, the tail of an Ouroboros… the regenerating agents, vervain, fluxweed, thorn apple… And of course, the source of power – blood, willingly offered. Naturally, the original potion contained Father’s. But once I had already been changed, it didn’t have to be so. The subsequent potions were far less complicated, also in that regard. As long as it was willingly given, the blood could be taken from any source.”
“Just… things.” He gave him a bashful look. “I don’t really want to talk about it, if that’s all right.”
His mind did a double take and there it was again, David leaning against the counter, smiling as he usually was and a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. “You don’t say much, do you?” Day after day after day of leaning against counters with a smile and –
“Let me go,” she said resolutely, and all three heads turned to her with surprise. Hermione ceased her pacing. “I'm meant to be there, they will be expecting me. Let me go and see what I can do for him.”
“Indeed. You see, as long as Father was alive, maintaining the connection between us was fairly simple – all I had to do was keep taking the potion he designed for me. But once he died, it became all the more complicated. It had been… an unpleasant discovery. I had started to revert. I gathered that I needed to strengthen the potion somehow, and it wasn’t too long until I realized what I was missing. Fergus’s blood was willingly given, but lacking a certain… attachment.”
The Unforgiveable curses were quite different than Occlumency, which Harry was for the first time in his life starting to get. He became pretty good at deflecting Malfoy’s attempts at invading his mind, and in the odd time he had succeeded, Harry could push him out rather easily. He was not, however, making any progress with the Unforgiveables.
It would suffice to say Harry was not fooled. “Come on, what is it? Do you want to leave? Because we can, right now, no one would say anything. We can just go.”
“You don’t know what video games are? Right. You’ve not been really living as a Muggle, then. He’s, well… there was this thing he did that sort of preserved his – let’s say life force. So we had to kill all of them first, the little
“Okay, okay, I’m sorry. I keep forgetting you’re a wizard at Muggle technology now.” The smile that played on his lips was enough to send a not-unpleasant shiver down Draco’s spine.
Draco still couldn’t look at him, so he looked at his bare feet. Harry’s big toe was almost square-shaped, and quite hairy too. Draco hated that he found it endearing. “You said there were some new developments in the Fergus Macnair case. What could be new about someone who’s been dead for five years?”
“All right, here, I’m taking it. Honestly, though. Do you – and I really don’t mean to be nosy, but – do you have enough?” Potter grimaced uncomfortably. He didn’t look any more pleased than Draco felt.
“It sounds so terrible,” Harry said before he could stop himself, looking at him intently. “He's awful, Malfoy. The people who actually choose to follow him must be mental. I don’t see how anyone could want this for themselves, for their family.” He didn’t really mean to say the last part, to make that accusation at Malfoy’s father, but he wasn’t really in control of his lips.
At some point they had to come back in, though, when it was getting too dark to see. They missed lunch, so by dinner time they were absolutely famished, and both rejoiced in the fact that once again Snape was missing and they could sit together.
It took time for the tall man to answer. “You are out of your mind, Draco. It seems as though I am the one who was mistaken. I never should have let you out of my grasp for so long - I see you still sorely need my close attention.” There was that familiar flash in the grey of his eyes, and Draco almost sighed with relief. He was getting close, he could feel it.
Harry almost spluttered an array of insults before he could stop himself. Taking an extremely deep breath, he looked right at the Potions master. “I’m sorry, Professor. Must have missed you there.”
“Maybe we could go inside?” Harry nodded, so glum it hurt in Draco’s chest, and led the way to the house. It looked lovely on the inside – not all that different to the cottage, actually. More pictures, maybe; some classical, some Muggle, but most of them were the faces of people he recognized. Harry’s family. Even Draco was up there… quickly he averted his eyes to inspect anything that wasn’t the walls. The furniture was all very soft, light colors, comfortable. It looked like a tiny, proper home. Draco loved it so much he thought he might accidentally cry.
Something in Potter’s expression softened. “All right then, yeah. I’ll do it. Why don’t you go and get started in your bedroom in the meantime? I’ll come by in a few minutes to help you with the bed. I know a fitted sheet is the worst possible thing to do without magic.”
They kept coming round, and after a while it was getting to be almost comfortable; Theo and Ron hit it off immediately due to their shared interest in board games, and Blaise and Hermione were practically joined at the hip (or at the Arithmancy book, in any case). Pansy ruled their little group with much ease, and Harry was just so happy to be around them all that he couldn’t keep the smile off his face. Even Mother was very glad to entertain everyone. She kept asking about bringing Andromeda and Teddy for a visit too, but Draco requested a little more time. He wasn’t sure he’s ready for that, yet.
“I did too, Sir. Last night was…” he couldn’t find the right words to describe it. “I thought maybe you’d –“ no, he simply couldn't. It was too painful to continue. Draco closed his eyes and felt the hand stroking his hair gently.
“We are over halfway through the semester, and that poses the perfect opportunity to sit down and reflect. Looking back to analyze combat situations is one of the most productive ways to prepare for the future. Your mistakes, I honestly believe, are your greatest teacher.” She smiled sweetly, and Harry wanted to hex her. He knew where this was going, and he didn’t like it one bit. “I’d like you to sit down in your pairs or threes and talk about our previous training sessions. You would have thirty minutes to draw some conclusions in pairs, another thirty minutes in your core groups, and then we would end in a shared discussion. Please find yourselves a comfortable spot, and I shall see you and hear your thoughts soon.”
“Now!” Harry shouted, and he just sprinted forwards. One of the figures got him as he ran, and he could feel the blue paint hit his cloak. When he reached close enough to shoot, he felt another curse hitting him from behind, the spot where Malfoy was meant to be watching. Harry turned to look at him furiously, but he just shrugged and smirked, which almost had Harry changing his direction and running towards him with the curse. But the figure was right there, and Harry got it with a well-aimed “
it? Are you completely out of your mind?” Harry nearly lost his head in a tizzy when he thought it was gone during the fight at the flat. And now he was suggesting just giving it to Draco?
“Reach out?” his heart was beating faster, his breathing shallower, but still he did not understand. This was everything he longed for all year, his father taking care of it, helping him… loving him… but this was just too much, and his mind was too fraught… “How?”
“Nothing. I just… no, really, it’s nothing.” It took this long for Draco to notice how red his eyes were and how sleep-deprived he actually looked, what with all the excitement.
Harry had barely a second to try and digest what was said when the curses were back to zooming over his head. He sent a desperate look to the others behind the desk, trying hard to think what to do. He knew that Professor Electra said no one will be actually injured, and that it wasn’t really dark wizards out there, but it still felt pretty damn bad. He took a moment to catch his breath, and then darted a look up.
Having realized he didn’t deserve it made absolutely no difference in his situation; the rod still tore him apart and Him inside after it hurt just in the way it did then, but worse. He was still dying. His father’s face was still right in front of his eyes, in so much pain, and he was suffering eternally. This was still happening, and there was still nothing he could do about it, nothing at all. He had no voice from all the screaming and no energy in his withering limbs and no magic he could actually use. There was nothing he could do to stop it, to stop Him. There was no comfort in knowing he’s going through something he didn’t deserve.
The shift between them happened one evening, on Christmas Eve. He and Malfoy played chess till they got bored, and now Malfoy was laying on his bed (Ron’s bed, Harry had to remind himself) reading a book, and Harry was on his own bed, watching him. He felt like the blond was aware of his glance, because the edges of his lips quivered. At long last he couldn’t take it anymore and looked at Harry. “What is it now, Potter?”
– he was still better than none. None was… tricky. None was complicated. None meant Draco was alone with the iron curtain, and that was a bit of a problem nowadays.
Over the thrum of canons, the shock of gunfire, the cries of the wounded, the pandemonium of absolute hell, Draco could hear him. He had no idea how. He had no idea why. But the thing that got him up, the only thing that registered, lying there in the rubble, covered in dust and only barely conscious after the explosion, was his voice. The soldier’s. Draco knew it was his without having to ask. Without needing to confirm it, either. And he didn’t resent it, he didn’t hate him for it. It was a clear voice, like bells ringing, like meadows and cups of strong tea and smooth golden rings. Like… not war. His voice was the opposite of war. There was a word for it, probably, had to have been, but Draco couldn’t find it right now. The only thing he could find was the soldier, his scent, his colors, and his voice. Draco hoped it was enough to pull him through. He kept fighting.
Panic made everything far more difficult, and instead of closing the shop in ten minutes, it took him nearly thirty. It was easy enough to act calm in front of Potter, because the alternative would have fucking crushed him, but now that he was alone Draco didn’t know what to do with himself. He was absolutely mad. Not only was he seen – and by Potter, of all the people in the world – but to add insult to injury he
It was like the old man just punched him in the stomach; Harry doubled-down, letter crumpling in his hand, airless. “You – you think – D-Dr-“ a drop of his tears hit the parchment. He didn’t see it tracing a sudden blue light across it.
“And you thought that time was tonight?” Harry couldn’t believe the feelings in his exhausted body. It was too difficult to comprehend; Draco hardly even looked at him in the beginning of the evening, he had the weight of the world on his shoulders, and then – then this… it was too much to handle.
“Right, that. It’s… I’m sorry, I didn’t think – I just didn’t know how you’d be when you woke up. If you’d still be trying to… you know.” Harry’s jittery hand came up to tug at the grimy dark locks of his hair. He looked so miserable, Draco actually gasped.
He hoped his voice was measured as he spoke, feigning nonchalance and probably failing miserably: “Is that all?”
“Interesting. Very interesting indeed.” He took a second simply staring into his son’s eyes. They had nearly the same color – the older man’s were slightly bluer tinged, and the boy’s more silver. Draco did not quiver against his stare. Without a word his father walked past him and Weasley and went to open the door.
Draco shrugged, assembling himself towards something that at least resembled solid. Quick, he needed a thought about fucking water snake venom. Good thing he still knew a thing or two about potions. “I doubt it. The effects last far longer than should be possible for a venom of such caliber. I don’t think…” he was shocked with his own audacity, but Granger looked like she would really like to hear him out, and Harry’s eyes lit up more than he’d seen in forever, so he bucked up. “I don’t think it’s any venom or poison, to be honest, not from any animal or plant source. I would have either been dead long ago, or the effects would have worn off.”
