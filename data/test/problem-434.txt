‘And to me, you are … a distraction,’ he said. ‘When you are sucking my cock, I don’t have to think about my dying father and …’ He shrugged, nodding at his bandaged left forearm.
The Golden Trio were the last to join the crowd milling outside the Potions classroom. Potter glowered when his eyes met Draco’s and turned away to talk to the pompous prat Macmillan before Draco could respond. Draco scowled, stuffing his hands into his pockets.

society pages?’ Sirius retorted, mock scandalised. ‘Ah, yes, the Veela child. Might to stay away from him, Harry. I heard he killed a man with his bare hands when he was only eight.’
Draco frowned at him, unsure what this had to do with Harry. “No. Healer Mitra wouldn’t tell me, which is very unethical of him. I have a right to know, as a patient.”
brilliant, if a bit too gaudy for Draco’s taste. He couldn’t understand their sort of insane Gryffindor bravery, but he could appreciate it.
Harry shakes his head, laughing. It seems that Zabini speaks more often in jest than not, a manner that is amusing enough when one has the appetite to encourage him. As is proper, they take no more than two dances, and step aside to pursue their conversation further. With great flair and dramatics, Zabini tells Harry about the commissions he has been sent on by his mother. Lady Zabini is a famed portrait artist constantly in search for interesting individuals to sit for her.
All Potter was doing was chatting with another bloke – and Draco’s instinctual reaction is to transform into a bird-headed monster. Potter will be the death of him.
Eltanin was bored: the prince and princesses were older than him, and like Dumbledore, more interested in political manoeuvres. He was making his escape to his favourite greenhouse, the one perched on the edge of cliffs overlooking the harbour, when he caught the scent of storm clouds.
Dumbledore pretended not to notice, demurring. ‘He is far too young, Minerva.’
Snape slashed his wand to the right, rending the air apart violently; the wall in front of him cracked, the floor shuddering.

of someone sitting down heavily. ‘I don’t think Draco realises what he’s doing,’ Remus says tersely.
‘Like you think they’re lesser than you because they’re poor! The Weasleys have more integrity and honour than your entire family have in a single little fingernail.’
‘You’re so fucking cynical. What about us then?’ Potter bit his bottom lip, looking as if he wished he could take his question back.
. He struggles with the prophecy that he will be the one to kill the Dark Lord, and he struggles harder with the path society has set for omegas. Several times a week, Draco sits in the Potions classroom, trying to do his homework, as Harry bends, sweating, over the cauldron. Snape, with coercion from McGonagall, has given grudging permission for Harry to start learning how to brew the suppressant potion.
‘Oh, no, no, Harry, I’m right here. I’ve been at home the whole time.’
unfair, but Draco didn’t see how whinging about it could change it. Whenever Blaise and Theo went on about it, Draco usually shut up and concentrated on drinking.
‘Smell?’ Father echoes, his brows furrowed, before his creased forehead smoothens when he realises what Draco means.
‘Right,’ she said. ‘Do you … are you thinking of … making a career change?’
‘Well, there’s all the snogging and frotting and blowjobs, which are
Anger snapped in Draco’s chest, hot and overwhelming as lava. He drew his wand. ‘
, Draco decides, is the word to describe him. He cannot tell if Zabini is the alpha, so he starts sitting with the Slytherin for every Herbology class—noticeable enough for Parkinson to leer, ‘Ooh, watch out, Zabini, looks like Malfoy has decided you will be his next boyfriend. Lucky thing you like it rough in bed!’
Draco looks back at Potter, whose green eyes are gleaming and smile is warm and genuine. It’s fine. Draco will be fine, because now, he sees how his strength can be useful. He leans in and says with a smirk: ‘Not so scared now that I’m here, eh, Potter?’
Harry feels those scarred palms dragging across his bare chest, the roughness sparking heat across his skin, Draco’s long fingers digging into his flesh. He hears the gasp and the whimper, mouths panting in desire.
They lapse into momentary silence.
get off, pinning additional responsibility on Harry?
‘And it would seem Harry Potter himself agrees with my proposal,’ the wizard said, blue eyes sparkling with spiteful triumph. ‘He is pushing for the destruction of Malfoy Manor. He has publicly denounced Slytherins as dishonourable people, people who can’t be trusted, people who lie and cheat. Of course, he hasn’t spoken for the Slytherin Registry yet, but I
‘I was eight. I was at the Parkinson estate for tea with Mother. Their gardener kidnapped me—and tried to rape me,’ —Hermione gasps, clapping her hands over her mouth— ‘so I killed him.’ Draco looks around at them, not quite meeting Harry’s gaze. ‘You don’t have to look like that. He didn’t do it in the end.’
“Exactly.”
“My patient needs rest now, Minister.”
“Dumbledore, he was - well - I cared about him. Obviously. I still do. And I know he cared about me too, or whatever. But, turns out, that didn’t stop him from using me the entire time. He never told me everything. He let me know just enough, and only at the last minute, to manipulate me into doing what needed doing. And I think I sort of get it. I don’t completely blame him. I can’t even say that it would have been nice to know that I was a - that I had to die, because even knowing for fifteen minutes was too long.”
“Oh, right, of course. Well, there are loads of empty rooms, you can just pick one, and I’m sure they’ll let you take the ingredients you need from the school supplies.”
“Prudy is being glad that Master Draco is alive! Prudy was so worried!”
“I’m glad.”
He could just close his eyes and let himself sleep for a bit, couldn’t he? But no, he wasn’t truly safe here. That Auror had sent a message and very soon, they’d be in here determined to find a way to capture him. Before that happened, he wanted a crutch, and he’d rather not use his new powers in front of anyone else.
“Wait - so house-elves used to be free?”
.” His leg crumpled beneath him, and he landed in an awkward heap on his left side. One of the damn crutches whacked him on the shin on the way down.
he had picked up on Draco’s distress.
“The war is
“No. Just broke both his arms and legs.” Potter eyed Draco’s crutches warily. Smart boy.
Draco’s eyes flew open. A man was looming over him, shaking him - his uncle - Draco shouted and hit upwards, shoving at the man’s chest as hard as he could. The man staggered back a step, releasing his shoulder, and Draco rolled away, half-falling off the bed. He cried out as his left leg tried to take his weight, ignored the cramp and somehow managed to right himself. He grabbed his crutches from on top of the bed covers and backed up blindly until he came up against the pillar of the next bed over, brandishing the wooden crutches in front of him like weapons.
“You can’t go back there, father.” He struggled to slow his breathing.
but I can’t really just ignore it.”
Potter rolled his eyes, which was supposed to be
After a couple of minutes, she looked up again. “Right, well, the diagnosis is very simple, as I’m sure you’ve figured out: the muscle remaining in your leg isn’t strong enough to take your weight. I also suspect that the muscle underneath the regrown skin has formed its own scar tissue, which is preventing the remaining muscle fibres from contracting and moving over each other as freely as they should. How much do you know about the way muscles work?”
He turned back hastily, and Potter caught his eye. Draco’s shoulders rose as he braced for the confession he would have to give. But Potter carefully didn’t ask, didn’t even look curious, and Draco relaxed as he felt no urge to start talking.
There was a sound from Draco’s left and he turned his head, to see another, much younger, house-elf who he very much did recognise.
The man stood only three steps away, framed in the same doorway that Draco and Prudy had come through. It was his dear old uncle, Rodolphus Lestrange, wearing torn, blood-stained robes and clutching a bag stuffed full of what Draco recognised as silverware and various expensive heirlooms.
“I’ll be careful,” said Potter. Draco wanted to make a snide comment about the likelihood of caution and Harry Potter ever being found within sight of each other, but stopped himself.
A few minutes later, someone from their left slid a piece of parchment and a quill and a bottle of ink towards them. Draco reluctantly let go of his mother’s hand to allow her to reach for them.
Draco stopped. Peeves floated three feet above the floor, glaring at Draco. A smile twisted across his features with no trace of his normal glee.
“Because your ghost would have been flat as a pancake!” She cackled again. “Urgh, seriously though, imagine it. All squished and shattered… ew,” she shuddered, “no
Draco nodded. The man was sitting so close, but his attention was on the road in front of them. He manipulated a stick in between them and did something with his feet, and all at once the car was moving.
She nodded and her whole face crumpled, her nose going even redder, the tears pouring down her cheeks. “Y-yes, Master M-Malfoy, but W-Winky is n-not knowing it until t-two days ago, sir!”
“Depending on how much consistent effort you put into the exercises, I’m confident we’ll see significant improvement within three or four months.”
Waiting for Potter’s return was exceedingly boring. Draco had never realised how often he wanted to move until he had to lie entirely still. He passed the time by watching the rich afternoon sunlight catch on the dust motes and refract through the Bloody Baron. He thought about trying to engage the ghost in conversation but didn’t want to show his guardian any disrespect.
Although apparently there was still plenty of guilt left to go round. Unbidden, an image of William Weasley’s scarred face came to mind. If maiming someone for life wasn’t bad enough to merit a spot on his top-seven list of people he’d wronged, what the hell was? What had he done that was
“Hold on a minute, then.” And Potter was up and in the bedroom, kneeling over by the drawer beneath the bunk, muttering a spell. A moment later he held up his handiwork for Draco to see. The sweatshirt was now a midnight black.
Prudy looked horrified. “Prudy is not cutting the master!”
Madam Pomfrey came over to join them, and summoned three extra chairs. She and Potter sat on the bed’s left side, the headmistress and minister on the right, far enough down the bed that Draco could just about keep them all in view.
Then Potter turned and walked quickly out of the common room, followed by the Aurors.
“Oh, well, congratulations, Malfoy. You’re not a murderer. What an achievement.”
Potter gasped and wrapped his arms around himself, wracked by a full-body shiver.
“On three.” He scooped up a large forkful.
“Don’t bother. It sucked. And I don’t want to be forced into explaining it to you.”
so I’d be ready to use it on Dumbledore. Fuck.” He couldn’t stop his voice from breaking, the words thickening with tears, and he
“Fucking hell.”
The place had been thoroughly ransacked. The very idea of cleaning it up without a wand was a joke. The floor of the tiny kitchenette was ankle-deep in smashed crockery and several of the cabinet doors had been torn off. Two of the four bunk-beds in the bedroom were lying on their side on the floor, blocking access to the other end of the room, and one of the thin mattresses had been gutted with swipes of a knife. Back in the main room, a wireless lay smashed on its side on the tiny dining table. The contents of pretty much every drawer and shelf in the whole place had been dumped on the ground and stamped on.
started to trust that the driver wouldn’t hit anything with his car when he eased them out of the flow and stopped by the edge of a pavement.
She continued moving her hands above Draco’s skin in small deliberate circles, and despite the fact that she wasn’t touching him, Draco could feel her magic tingling across his chest where she passed. It felt soothing, and he realised that she was helping to dispel the deep ache that the old magic had left clinging to his bones.
Potter looked awful. His eyes were red-rimmed and his hair was sticking almost straight up, and his black formal robes were half unbuttoned, revealing a glimpse of a ratty T-shirt underneath. He was holding a large bottle of firewhiskey in one hand, and a crinkly bag of takeaway in the other. Draco’s stomach swooped a little as he remembered where Potter had been today: Fred Weasley’s funeral.
“My wand was broken. I - got it fixed after the battle.”
“Please, master, don’t…” Her pleading sounded almost betrayed.
“Malfoy! Can you hear me? You’ve got to let me in, the branches are still growing, I can’t get through!”
Draco took a deep breath. “It aches a little, pretty much all the time. If I put any weight on it or even move it too quickly, it cramps up. It takes about a minute for the cramp to subside. I was using crutches to walk around.”
“Malfoy? What’s wrong?”
“Secondly, both Mr Potter and Headmistress McGonagall spent yesterday with Peeves, making sure he
“Ouch. Okay. So this looks like a burn? Or a bite?”
She crouched down on the stool and doubled over with grief, clutching her hands to her stomach and bawling. Draco’s chest clenched even tighter and he sat up, unsure how to comfort her. Eventually, he settled on laying one hand across her tiny back.
wand,” said Draco.
Draco’s stomach suddenly felt cold. “The Manor was not a place where I could let my guard down, Potter. A summons could come at any time.” Unbidden, his right hand came up to rub at the sleeve covering his bandaged left forearm.
“Well, Potter, I’m glad my predicament amuses you. You deserve a bit of a break, for Gods’ sake.”
bodies couldn’t be tied together with magic, could they? Suddenly, he realised how complicated his body was, and he was burning with curiosity. But he didn’t want to reveal any more of his ignorance to this muggle. It didn’t seem right for him to know so much less than her.
a student is simply intolerable.”
He was grateful to be interrupted by the distinctive crack of a house-elf arriving.
“I’m not going to ask how you feel, okay? I don’t want you to explain. I know you feel like crap.”
“Oh! It’s okay, that’s not Peeves!”
Not that he had drunk enough to black out yesterday. Potter had succumbed to unconsciousness shortly after getting Draco to say he would come with him to the funeral. There was still a quarter of the bottle of fire whiskey left, but Draco didn’t actually want to drink it. (Definitely out of practice.) So he had tucked Potter up in his nest of blankets as best as he could (if he’d had his bloody wand, he would have levitated him to a bunk-bed) and wobbled into the bedroom on his crutches to pass out in a new bunk-bed, in the vain hope that its mattress would be more comfortable than the one he’d slept in before.
The Minister stayed silent.
. If anything deserved expulsion, that was it. It even ranked above Potter’s attempt on Draco’s life; even at the time, despite being busy bleeding to death on the floor, it had been obvious that Potter hadn’t known what he was doing. This level of forgiveness was, in fact, a fitting tribute to Dumbledore’s brand of insanity. He wanted to tell McGonagall so, but he didn’t want her to change her mind, so he didn’t know what to say.
“We have to stop meeting like this,” he muttered at the ceiling, then winced. His throat felt like it was coated in sand. The back of his head throbbed and his left leg ached. This time there were no house-elves around to heal him, and somehow it seemed as though he had been bruised everywhere.
I’d have reached out to Dumbledore and asked for his protection instead of trying to kill him. But your parents influenced you on those things too. The bullying and prejudice
After several long moments, Potter unclenched slightly, and Draco dared to glance at his face. Potter’s jaw was tight and his eyes hard and gleaming.
“You fucker, Dumbledore.” His words lacked bite, though. The only reason he could tell how much guilt he’d been repressing was the strange, airy gap it had left in his mid-section.
“I think not. That cell wasn’t very comfortable.”
He finally got himself settled at the tiny dining table. The whole process had taken him much longer than it should - even bending over his truck had been difficult on one leg, with the crutches balanced against its side and then sliding to the floor with a clatter. He was breathing fast from the effort and frustration, and he had to try quite hard not to let his breathing get even faster.
“What? You could
Draco turned his head away from the livid face looming above him. Lestrange’s hand darted out and seized him brutally round the chin, forcing him to turn back and look into his uncle’s dark eyes. Lestrange was panting with fury, but as Draco watched, his expression shifted into an altogether different emotion.
“Harry Potter is wishing for me to heal you, sir.”
Potter was frowning into the middle distance past Malfoy’s right shoulder. He had drawn his wand almost absent-mindedly, and was now rolling it back and forth in his fingers in what was clearly a nervous habit.
“What?”
“Of course, Madam Pomfrey. Thank you, Lord Malfoy. I believe what you have told us will save some lives, and finish the last of this war that much sooner. I may call upon you in the future with more questions, if you are willing.”
Frona turned to her. “Is young Master Malfoy a good master, Prudy?”
“It already has been seen to, by a house-elf. It’s a curse wound. I doubt that there’s much else that can be done for it.”
“I’m aware this may be a bit of a culture shock for you, Mr Malfoy, but when you don’t have magic, there is no instant fix.”
“Never mind, never mind. You’ve missed your chance to meet Teddy, Molly has already taken him in. I’ll have to introduce you to him afterwards.”
Draco glared at him, breathing hard. “When?”
“Saturday.”
“Ah. Um…”
Winky wailed in anguish, and buried her face against Draco’s knee.
He reached into his trouser pocket and pulled out the piece of strange Muggle parchment.
Myrtle cackled with such glee that it reminded Draco of Pansy Parkinson.
Weasley.
Frona stopped circling her hands above Draco and sat back on a tiny stool behind her with a deep sigh. “Frona has done all that can be done, Master Malfoy. How is you feeling?”
He turned and left the room.
“That should be sufficient to deter Peeves,” said McGonagall. “I will see to it that your possessions are packed and your trunk ready to go by tomorrow, Malfoy.”
“Potter. There is an obvious solution here.”
Someone sitting at the table behind them started saying, “Hey, are you bleeding - ?”
Draco sagged with relief as the compulsion to start talking faded.
! You killed him! Slashed him open, cut him to ribbons before my very eyes!”
Potter looked awkward. “Oh, well - I, er, couldn’t find it this morning. I think it’s still in Hermione’s bag.”
Draco frowned at her, but he knew that now was not the time to ask how that had happened.
Draco frowned at his father. Lucius looked back at him, his puffy face almost kind. Draco swallowed past a lump in his throat. “I’m never going to see you again, am I?”
Draco leant one crutch up against the side of the kitchenette so he could open the cupboard, and bring out two plates. It was awkward with one hand but he tried not to look like it was difficult. He didn’t want Potter to notice and then just levitate them over to the table. He wanted to do this. He turned and hopped back towards the table on one crutch, with the plates propped on his hip.
“Two secs…” he said, and then dumped a handful of coins into Draco’s still-open palm.
my involvement. I am already going down for life, Draco. It will not really make things worse. But it will prove to them that you are not leaving anything out. The more you can show that you are putting distance between us, the better.”
Draco felt himself go cold. Living back at the Manor… He licked his lips, mouth suddenly dry. “No. I would… prefer an alternative.”
Draco put everything he had into restraining a mean comment.
“Yes. And it’s Malfoy.”
“That’s… completely
He snapped his mouth shut, but it was too late. Potter’s eyes narrowed.
“Yes. I can’t put any pressure on my leg. If I use the muscle then it seizes up and starts cramping.”
Dimly, Draco noted that Potter was kneeling next to him.
The Elder wand wasn’t a myth. The Dark Lord was holding it, which surely meant that it was all over, that they were going to die right then in that hall. But Potter hadn’t even flinched, he had looked so focused and confident, and for the first time Draco thought that he might succeed.
Faces were transformed by the light, becoming softer and more sympathetic. Even the looming hugeness of Hagrid away on the left seemed less rough -
Potter worried his bottom lip with his thumb. “A broomstick?”
Draco could hear his own breathing. It made a horrible, rattling, gasping sound. His whole left side felt warm.
former childhood nemesis returned. Potter must have come in quite quietly, because the first Draco knew about it was when he stepped into Draco’s restricted field of vision.
The spell did not let him hesitate. He was almost grateful that it was taking control, because he personally felt paralysed. He got himself into a kneeling position, a corner of the invisibility cloak getting caught under his leg and almost making him fall. He tore the cloak from over his head. There might have been shouts, even some screams, but all he could do was crane his neck - he had to meet their eyes - there, not so hard to get their attention when everyone was already staring at him, first Hagrid, then Longbottom, Granger and Weasley -
Potter hesitated, and then sat down on the edge of Draco’s bed. Draco wondered for a moment why he hadn’t just taken the chair placed right by the bed-side, but then realised it was so that Draco could still easily see Potter’s face without having to move his head.
“No haunting. I can handle Potter on my own. I’ll see you later though, Myrtle, okay?”
“We asked Slughorn for the password.”
Draco squeezed his eyes shut. Lestrange used the hand squeezing Draco’s chin to slam Draco’s head back against the floor. The rag-rug softened the impact slightly, but the pain still bloomed across the back of Draco’s skull.
“Yeah, and - your ears went pointy.”
With a smirk of triumph Draco set it loose, sending the model to fly over and circle round the real Potter’s head, dive-bombing his face in a flawless Wronski feint before pulling up and hovering at Potter’s eye-level so that he could take a closer look.
“Sure, of course. See you then, lad.”
Draco felt an answering smile wanting to tug at his lips. “Thanks, Potter. For telling me all this. I do feel better.”
He had only taken one step - well, swing - forward when he saw Potter give a nod, and in unison, both the Aurors and Potter raised their wands higher.
” Lestrange growled, and ropes lashed around Draco, binding his arms to his sides and his legs together, the cane trapped uncomfortably between his right hand and his thigh. He overbalanced and landed on his side, half on a rag-rug. He twisted desperately over onto his back to keep Lestrange in view.
At that the woman finally blinked and got over herself. She looked down at a large appointment book in front of her and ran her finger along the entries.
Draco raised his eyebrows in a question. His eyes were watering.
Potter nodded. “Good.”
“Mr Malfoy, thank you very much.” Madam Pomfrey was practically beaming at him. “This will let me do more than just the minimum. I’ll be able to take some pressure off St Mungo’s. I must go write and tell the Head Nurse…”
As soon as Potter heard him start talking he yelled, “
“Honestly, it’s not that bad. I can deal with it.”
Draco grit his teeth. “You
It seemed that the more still and silent he held his body, the less he could hold his mind in check. His thoughts whirred, and nearly all of them made him feel uneasy. He jumped from wondering what it would be like to live in Grimmauld Place, to whether he wanted to return to Hogwarts next year, to Peeves, to his uncle, no - he’d rather imagine his parents being shut up into their cells in Azkaban than think of
“Three life-debts I owe you, Potter. One for the fire, one for that Death Eater in the corridor during the battle and one for stopping Peeves from crushing me. It really pisses me off.”
Draco looked from his father to his mother, hoping to find her ready to help him talk some sense into Lucius. Instead she was nodding, her face grave.
“No, I know. I’m not stupid enough to think you actually
“I know. I know. But, well, he did say sorry.” Potter’s lip quirked up in a half-smile.
” she said, and a silver octopus was swimming through the air away from them.
“Please take a seat, Mr Malfoy,” said Anne Liston, and Draco noticed that she was already sitting down in that rolling chair. He took a look at her, sitting with her hands clasped in front of her red cardigan, and even with his heart-rate heightened he couldn’t persuade himself that she meant him any harm. There was no need for breaking the Statute of Secrecy just yet.
“I’ll tell you, Potter, although you’ll need to be more specific. Oh, and lose your bodyguards.”
“Uh - hi, Myrtle…”
“Huh. Still. I thought you were such a
“Anyway, look, Malfoy, I should probably be getting back to Hogwarts for the night. But all I’m saying is that you’re not doing anyone any good if you go around beating yourself up. Sure, absolutely, go ahead and do these tasks to pay penance, it’s certainly got some poetic justice to it, but you’ve got to
He turned towards the door to the living room and frowned. A slight, silvery light was coming from in there, although it was barely noticeable against the sunshine. He gripped his crutches and swung himself as fast as possible towards the living room, his hangover forgotten; that light looked like a -
Potter bit his lip, and nodded.
“That sounds like a bad pun.”
“It’s okay, Prudy - the Matron healed me too. By tomorrow I’ll be back to normal.”
Draco got up and gathered the pillows from the bunk beds too, going over to the fireplace with them jammed under his arms and using a crutch to poke the tangle of blankets into two even piles. He then added two pillows to each pile and eased himself down to the floor, hard to do with one leg held out awkwardly. It was embarrassing to have Potter watch him struggle with such simple actions, so he busied himself getting all the blankets and pillows around and under him rather than meet his eyes.
Draco winced. At least his memory of the aftermath of the attack involved a general impression of shattered agony, rather than anything specific.
Draco had to plant his crutches more firmly against the grass to prevent himself swaying where he stood. He felt ill.
Oh, shit.
“The Fiendfyre. A griffin got a bite out of the back of my left calf while I was climbing those desks.” Draco reached down and pulled aside the tatters of his left trouser leg, and Potter leaned in almost reluctantly to look. He winced.
The Aurors, a man and a woman, both glanced at the tree growing out of the floor and its grisly fruit, but Potter wasn’t distracted for a second.
“If you say so, Malfoy.”
“Oak, yes.”
, they had to get the message - and then shouted over the growing sound around him - “I have wronged you, I beg your forgiveness!”
“Bill, I reckon I should take him back to the tent. Are you all right by yourself - ?”
“Do you have any friends or relatives you could stay with?”
He didn’t see Goyle. He did see his cousin, Nymphadora Tonks, and her werewolf husband. He felt a stronger clench of sadness for this Tonks, someone he had never and, now, would never meet, than he did for his own aunt Bellatrix.
“Yes. A griffin.” Why did it matter what animal it was? He sounded stupid.
Draco blinked at her in surprise. “What do you mean? I’ve been arrested, Prudy.”
Draco nodded, letting himself relax a fraction. They were probably still in cells just down the hall somewhere, but he knew Potter wouldn’t confirm that.
His father held the knife in his left hand, so he could press the blade into the meat of his right palm, under the table. Not even a flicker of discomfort marred his father’s impassive expression as blood started to trickle down his fingers from the deep gash in his hand.
Draco laughed.
From the corner of his eye, Draco could see that Potter’s posture was as tense and brittle as his voice. Draco drew the firewhiskey bottle closer and poured himself another finger, before handing it to Potter. He waited another minute, but Potter seemed determined not to say anything more, and Draco could no longer resist commenting.
“Don’t you ‘hi, Myrtle’
“Good. Now move.” Potter jerked his head towards the door.
He could not remember ever feeling this frantic. He felt sick. He couldn’t do it, he
“Well, fear not, Potter, I’m an expert. I have constructed quite a routine in the last year. Although only at school, of course, and a bit less on week-nights.”
“Yes, but…”
moving cars, all speeding directly across their path.
“You’re welcome,” Potter mumbled. His eyes looked bright, greener than usual. “Malfoy, I just realised something - both the first time and the last time I faced Tom, I survived because of, well, because of a mother’s love. Mine, when I was a baby, and yours, last week.”
The doctor was looking at him shrewdly when he surfaced. “You don’t have to tell me how you got injured, Mr Malfoy, only in what ways it has limited your movement.”
The next few minutes were spent in awkward silence, eating the delicious, spicy, greasy food. Draco was glad to see a bit of colour coming back into Potter’s pale, brown cheeks as they finished off the last of the chicken korma.
He concentrated on each movement, dividing the task of standing into parts that were small enough to face. Getting up off the floor had never felt so complicated, and it probably took him a full five minutes, but by heavily relying on his hands and right leg, he managed it. He didn’t bother trying his left leg, he knew full well that it couldn’t support his weight. He used it as little as possible and half-hopped over the stone to the door.
Draco raised his eyebrows. “How did you explain the murder tree, then? And the shield I made when Peeves was after me?”
“Malfoy, you have to come! Here - ”
Potter was smiling. “Yeah, cars are death-traps, you wouldn’t believe how many muggles die in crashes every year.” He grinned at Draco’s appalled face. “But if my uncle could get away with driving like a maniac everywhere and never getting hurt then I reckon you have to be pretty unlucky for it to actually happen to you.”
Draco grudgingly opened his eyes. His eyeballs felt gritty and his back was stiff from this horrible mattress. And his leg ached. The sunshine poured in through the cloth of the tent, hot and bright. It seemed to stab into his brain. Fuck. He was out of practice with this alcohol thing. Had it really only been a week since he had last blacked out in his bed in the Slytherin dorms? Had it really only been a week since the end of the war? It felt like six months.
Light came through a gap in the branches.
The marble continued inside, on both the walls and floor. Directly in front of him a corridor continued deeper into the building, and to the side a muggle woman sat behind a long, high reception desk. She wore a bright pink blouse which matched her bright pink lipstick, and seemed to be only a few years older than Draco. For a second, they both looked at each other without saying anything. The woman seemed a bit surprised at his appearance, and was not nearly as good as the taxi driver at hiding it. Draco shifted uneasily - he knew wearing the cloak had been a mistake.
cursed her and gave her a bad knock to the head, but Madam Pomfrey didn’t seem worried.”
And yet
“No! No, Master Draco, sir. Prudy is being so happy you survived. Prudy th-thought we is all - all safe. But it was being a war, sir. We cannot all survive.”
Madam Pomfrey’s lips twitched. “Fortunately, physiotherapy is not the same as surgery. And they don’t just cut people open while a patient can feel it, by the way. The muggles have some very clever techniques for blocking pain.”
“It was a war. At the time I was livid, but I understand now how important it was that you took it. Giving up my wand was apparently my small sacrifice towards a world without the Dark Lord. Anyway, my mother lent me hers when I came back to school, which was a lot better than nothing. So it was her who went without.”
“Oh, well, that’s all right then - sarcasm, of course it isn’t - wait, he said
Why would Potter want to reassure him?
Prudy peered at him from over the clutched pillow-case. She waited for him to continue, but Draco’s throat had closed up on him.
. Potter looked almost nervous.
“Oh. Yeah. We were apparating - I’d forgotten that.”
Potter was now literally trying to tear his hair out. To hell with whether it was appropriate or not, Draco couldn’t let him just sit alone like this. He scooted over, the blankets coming along too in a tangle around his legs, got in as close as he could to Potter’s side and wrapped an arm around his shoulders. Draco felt his own eyes prickle as Potter choked and curled tighter in on himself, his whole body juddering with misery.
He looked over to his left, past Potter, and watched as his aunt (still peculiar to think that was who she was) closed her eyes for a moment, grief clearly etched in the tight press of her lips. Then she lifted her wand to her throat, cast a
“Here, sit down.”
Draco pulled the armchair holding his breakfast closer to him and ate some toast mechanically as he thought about what to do. He had told Potter he would stay put here in Slytherin, but this was important. He had until ten in the morning before his interrogation, which he estimated was still in an hour or two. He wished he could cast a
“We didn’t kill you, Professor,” Potter said calmly, and Dumbledore exploded into dust.
“Mate? Your seatbelt?”
Frona’s eyes narrowed. “And before now?”
“It sounds dirty! And it’s not like that! I can’t hear them in my head or anything, they don’t
“Right. Um.” Potter turned to him, looking slightly sheepish. “Malfoy, you’d help the Ministry with all this - post-war stuff, right?”
Myrtle suddenly cackled, the crying forgotten, and executed a quick loop. “Ha! I’m glad you didn’t die this time, Draco.” She looked down at him with a glint in her eye.
Of course, Draco would be questioned under Veritaserum in any case, but it still wouldn’t be as revealing as freely offering his memories to the court. The damage to his father would be limited by the court’s knowledge of the right questions to ask. But he would also be offering no more than every other Death Eater. He would have no bargaining power at all.
“She even forgot to tell you to drink your potion,” said Potter, amused.
, you snivelling little worm. You never loved him, never served him willingly. Just like your father, only in it for what you could get out of it. You make me
He cursed and tried not to clench his teeth too much as the cramp slowly wore off. Gods, that was annoying. He grabbed his crutches and swung himself up to standing, manoeuvring himself to the bathroom.
His eyes were immediately drawn to something shifting in the darkness at the far end of the corridor - the dust coiling upwards, forming a shape, a man’s shape -
“Too bad. I’ve made you an appointment for this Friday. This letter contains the details.”
Draco looked wildly around the Hollow, trying to see if there was any other way to prevent the imminent disaster. His gaze skated over a cluster of familiar people standing a little further along from Hagrid, and instantly everything got worse.
“No. It is… very ancient magic.”
“Yes, they did. And very powerful. We couldn’t do much against them, actually, and we didn’t have much reason to trust them. When we first encountered each other, there were atrocities committed on both sides. It came to the brink of all-out war. Frona said that the Path of the Penitent came out of the negotiations to avoid that war. It’s a way for an elf to take personal responsibility for their wrongs, and atone for them directly. In the meantime, that elf cannot be held against their will, and afterwards, if they’ve walked the Path successfully, then they are allowed a fresh start. It’s an older way of settling things than the Wizengamot. It both predates and supersedes our wizarding laws. It only works if the elf has never committed murder, though.” Draco stopped, suddenly realising how close he had come to ruining his own chances by nearly killing Lestrange. Would that have counted, since it was self-defence?
She blinked her large, frightened eyes at him and wrung her hands in a familiar gesture of distress.
They crossed the road, Draco bringing up the rear. Weasley opened the gate into the tiny paved area that passed as a front garden. The stone steps up to the front door were worn with age and a trifle uneven, and Draco took care not to stumble in any way under Weasley’s examination.
Potter spoke to the foot of the bed, avoiding everyone’s incredulity. “Oh yeah, um, of course.” Potter quite obviously wished he’d never said anything. “That’d probably make more sense, you know, Grimmauld Place is horrible, even I don’t want to stay there much.”
He had hardly managed to get himself to his feet (foot) before the young receptionist was back, followed by an older woman wearing a neat red cardigan and loose grey trousers. She was tall, solid-looking, white, and had her hair cut shorter than his own, even though she was probably older than his mother. Draco couldn’t help but stare a little. He wasn’t used to seeing women wearing trousers, and the only woman he knew with a short hair-style was Madam Hooch.
Draco felt his insides freeze.
He finished the ‘Y’ with a tasteful flourish and sat back, considering what format was most logical. He decided on a table, and wrote two column headings:
He passed the knife to Draco. Draco’s heart had started beating faster already in anticipation of the pain, and he wanted to kick himself for being such a coward. After everything, was he really afraid of a little
Shacklebolt nodded. “Those conditions seem eminently reasonable to me, Lord Malfoy, and I am happy to meet them. And if we are therefore in agreement, then I would like to start with the most time-sensitive issue: what you may be able to tell us about where the other Death Eaters are hiding.”
“Eleven, of course.”
, Malfoy! If Snape hadn’t been there you’d have
Draco adjusted his sweaty grip on the cross-bar of the crutches and did as he was bid. He was still hyperventilating, still over-sensitive to everything, but he fixed his eye’s on Potter’s back and somehow followed him back out of the door, down the steep steps, across the road, over the grass and back through the tent flap.
Potter was staring at him as if he had never seen him before. Draco supposed that it was exceedingly strange to hear himself apologising, especially to this particular person. Then Potter sighed.
Draco all but threw himself down in a clatter of crutches and shook Potter roughly by the shoulder.
to say anything -
think of himself as a killer?
“Woah,” said Potter.
Potter grinned.
Draco opened his mouth, and then shut it again. “Not a lot.”
The thought almost made him whimper. He really didn’t want to start thinking about it. He had spent most of every day, when not actively busy trying to survive, deliberately trying not to think about it. But he had to, didn’t he? He had to face it so he could move forwards on the Path.
It seemed that the battle had not reached down here. The clock had fallen from its mantelpiece, presumably during some of the heavier artillery barrages, but otherwise it looked exactly the same. There was even some abandoned homework on a table at the far side of the room.
“You’re sending me to a
,” she said, and Draco couldn’t prevent the way he startled back, holding his hands up to try and ward it off, panic flaring. But just as before, the red light dispersed harmlessly about a foot away from him.
“Then fine. Can’t lie to me, right? So get on with it and cast those spells.” He gestured blindly towards Draco with his wand, one hand still clutching his head.
Draco felt the air leave his lungs in a rush, as if he’d been winded. Potter looked a bit surprised himself, in fact. Draco automatically grasped for some sort of scathing comeback, but he couldn’t actually speak. He supposed that he shouldn’t feel
, maybe hit him with his cane, but he couldn’t seem to move. Even his breath had stopped. The next moment, Lestrange had got his bearings and slashed viciously with his wand, and Draco heard a pained squeak from Prudy as she crashed into the kitchen cabinets.
“And what’s that?” Potter mumbled into his knees.
Draco shivered. Now that Frona’s magic was no longer bathing him, he could feel the cold of the dungeon against his bare skin. He reached behind him and picked up the cloth that had been cushioning his head. It was his shirt and the remains of his singed and filthy school robes, which he pulled on again eagerly. The dirty fabric felt disgusting against his skin, but it cut out the worst of the chill.
“Just a little one, here on my hand. You can heal it in a minute.”
“I will be in Azkaban for the rest of my life,” his father continued. He could have been speaking of the weather. “Your mother may fare better - ”
But it wasn’t Peeves. It was Moaning Myrtle.
“Are - are you all right?”
“Yes, Master, but I is being able to apparate you away.”
“You said it was a family secret, right?”
Two hours later, Draco and Prudy landed in the entrance hall of the Manor. Draco had to let go of Prudy’s hand and lean heavily on the cane Frona had conjured for him to avoid falling to the floor as his left calf spasmed. He pressed the back of his hand to his mouth to prevent any sound of pain escaping and waited for the half-minute it took for his leg muscle to settle again. Prudy watched him carefully, eyes wide and worried.
“Not really, Potter, I wish I didn’t need your help.” Draco sighed and took it anyway. Potter braced and easily took his weight, which was a good thing as Draco had to rely on him rather a lot to get up using only one leg and one crutch.
Frona peered at him from her stool, and Prudy was wringing her hands again in sympathy, looking concerned. Her pity made Draco sit up straighter. It wouldn’t do to let his house-elf think he couldn’t handle himself. Although, perhaps it was a little late for that - she had seen him at his most helpless, after all. But it was different now he was Lord of the Manor. This was a fresh start, or at least he could pretend it was.
A hand? The muggle was going to touch him? Oh, Gods…
“I can recommend some pleasant hotels - ”
“Not if I had to use Dark Magic to do it, I wouldn’t!”
I couldn’t haunt him a little bit? Like I did with the Hornby bitch? You know I would do it for you, Draco…”
“Go ahead.”
“Yes.” His voice came out as a whisper. He cleared his throat and met Frona’s gaze. “Yes. I’m very sorry.”
Draco nodded again, in lieu of a proper bow, which he couldn’t quite manage with the crutches. He thought of offering his hand to shake, but she probably didn’t want to touch a Death Eater any more than necessary.
Potter filled his own glass with an
“Yep. Apparently Ginny is over me. She’s into Neville now.”
“Did you say -?”
He sat up straighter and took pleasure in dipping his quill in the ink, tapping it deftly on the side of the glass to clear the excess. In the top right corner he wrote the date - it took him a moment to figure it out - and in the top left, his name, so the professor would know whose work it was. Then, neatly, in the top centre, he wrote the title:
He pushed himself up to a sitting position on the floor, his back against the sofa, and hugged his knees close. He felt physically sick. He gulped breaths, desperately trying to settle his stomach and lower his heart-rate. It was the same level of fear that he’d felt during the Fiendfyre the first time; he was absolutely pouring sweat, his magic was crackling wildly in the air around him, and Merlin, but he was terrified.
and I really, really don’t get why you think you need to return the favour.”
A bright shot of red light fizzled a foot from where it would have collided with his left shoulder. Ropes hit the air a foot from his right. He had to do this before they stopped casting spells designed to trap him and started casting to hurt, to kill.
A Weasley with a badly-scarred face. Oh, Merlin.
Draco snorted. “Thanks.”
“Haven’t you even been
can either relax and get all skinny, or they can bunch up and get all fat, which then tugs on your bones and causes movement. There’s almost always an opposing pair of muscle groups, like the biceps and triceps in your arm here, so when one is contracting the other is extending. So you can see that if there was some scar tissue binding all these little ropes together, none of them would be able to move across each other freely. There’s a lot more going on in terms of how these cells are triggered, but that’s the basics. Any questions?”
“The spirits of your ancestors? A
“I guess you had to be doing something in here apart from following the tent chores rota.”
He was almost happy to see the same taxi driver man again, and he had a strange urge to tell him about the appointment, and the exercises he was supposed to do twice a day. Fortunately, he was too terrified by the movement of all the cars around them to open his mouth. He did, however, remember to arrange for the man to pick him up again for his appointment next Tuesday.
Potter drew his wand and Draco tensed, even though he
“Prudy, I - I have to tell you something. It’s about - about Dobby.”
“The Weasley who
“How about curry?” Potter slid another box over towards him, which was full of some kind of pungent stew of an unnaturally orange variety.
“Oh, come on! Freshening charm, Stomach Settler, Sobriety Hex? Everyone in Hogwarts knows them by the end of fourth year!”
Potter’s voice drifted over the still air.
“And water. Would you like me to show you?”
Her eyebrows rose. “Oh, is that so? That is excellent news. You would think Poppy would have mentioned it in her letter. But I suppose she is very busy with casualties at the moment.”
He was sure he was about to get hexed, but then the patronus spoke, in Granger’s voice, and Potter wheeled around to face that instead.
“Maybe it would have helped a bit on some of the nights we spent in this tent this year. God, it was grim.”
Draco sucked in a breath.
The sudden movement jarred his bones, and he gritted his teeth and laid back down as his whole left side throbbed. He took a careful deep breath and probed the pain. His bones seemed to be whole again, but fragile and tender. A dull ache had settled deep in his lungs.
The house-elf - Winky, Potter’s note said - wore a dress, which was surprising. Draco had never properly met any free elves before and now in the space of a few days he had met two of them. She placed the tray holding his breakfast on the nearest armchair and turned back to him, her wide brown eyes nervous.
“She’ll be fine, no thanks to you.
“Why are you so confident, Malfoy? You think you’ve got some Dark Magic that Tom didn’t?”
They sat in silence for a moment - the first awkward silence since the meal began.
Draco stared up at the ceiling and wondered if his parents had been transferred away from the Hogwarts dungeons yet.
Potter refilled his glass and took another large swallow. They drank steadily for another twenty minutes before Potter spoke again, the words slightly slurred together.
Potter held up the cloak in triumph and then threw it at Draco without ceremony. As Draco grabbed the elegant ripples of fabric out of the air, he suddenly knew what it was, and he was more dumbfounded than if Potter had decided to give him his wand back. Potter had said he would let him use it last night, but it was also clear that Potter had been so drunk at the time that he didn’t even remember that conversation.
“Your - ? You know, your seatbelt? Like this?”
“Oh, yes. Back in first year she actually said that.”
“You’re
He knew his voice sounded rough with emotion, but he felt too warm to mind. He looked over at Potter and didn’t even try to stop himself from beaming. “Thanks for telling me, Potter. It means a lot. Obviously.”
"Fabulous, I found a delightful recipe for salmon and sticky rice that I think you'll really love," Draco bounced in place, the excitement vibrating from within as he planned out the ingredients they would need. He had waited for this day for so long, to finally be able to cook a meal for Harry that he was willing to try.
Wisps of memories swirled through the misty waters of the pensieve before him, he never thought that he would reach the point of relying upon the carefully stored and collected memories, carefully compiled by his one true love for his eyes only. It had been some time now since they had parted for the final time, and now Draco was left alone on the mortal plane with only the memories of his husband remaining.
"Here, I've got you," the words shocked Draco as much as the hand gripping his arm did. Without him noticing someone had managed to approach him, catching him mid fall and swiftly up-righting him. Draco couldn't believe that he had almost fallen in front of a stranger, and yet he couldn't be more thankful that they had stepped in to save him. There was no way he had the time to deal with an injury this week, especially with the busy schedule he had for both university and work, he needed all of his limbs to be fully functioning.
"We need to talk about this Draco," the words breached the silence with no warning. The pair had shared few words since the latest story surrounding their relationship had made its way into that morning's edition of The Daily Prophet. Harry's hands clasped tightly around the boiling mug within his hands, his grip becoming stronger as he stared into the depths of the hot tea. He hadn't even been thirsty when he had made it, but the comfort he drew from the coral mug and the steaming beverage it held was what he needed in that moment.
"I'll be fine Harry, and don't call my ball merely fancy, it's going to be an extravaganza!" Harry laughed as Draco called back in outrage at the perceived slight, he loved to rile him up. "Oh, and please never wear coral in my presence again, it's ghastly."
"Alright, hurry up boys, it's leaving in just a few moments," Regulus faffed, quickly making sure their trunks were piled onto the train and that both looked their best. With a swipe of his wand, clothing smoothed down and their hair flattened, any attempts at taming Harry's curls failed, but at least the pair looked more put together than before. The pair hurried inside the compartment they had claimed as their own, rushing to the window as the whistle blew loudly.

"Oh, I forgot, the man who paid told me he'd see you again tomorrow evening, said you'd know who he is," Draco hummed slightly, realising that the mysterious stranger who he'd seen every evening that week must have been the one behind the taxi. With a nod and a shouted thank you, he sprinted up to his front door, ready to sit down with a cup of tea and just sleep.

"It's alright, I don't mind sharing," his voice was deep and husky, but there was a warmth to it as he spoke to Draco, ensuring him that there was no bother in sharing the item. "I'm glad I could stop you from falling, I couldn't imagine it would be any fun landing on the ice."
"Yeah, I'm out here. What's taking you so long, it's almost dinner time," Draco called back, his voice laced with confusion as he waited for Harry to make an appearance.
"I'm sorry Draco, I'm so sorry. You know I didn't want it to end this way." It had been a few days and neither had taken the breakup well, Draco had isolated himself from everyone, was barely eating and truly had his friends worried. Harry tried to hide behind the mask of being the Chosen One, smiling and laughing away as he carried on with his usual routine, and yet his smiles never reached his eyes and his green eyes were filled with pain and guilt. This was what he had wanted after all, and yet all he could feel now was regret, he had made a mistake and he was almost positive it was too late to fix it.
"Draco, by the way," he startled the man as he climbed into the taxi. "The name's Draco." As the taxi pulled away from the curb, he could see the man smile as he mouthed his name, all in all, Draco counted it as a small win for the evening.
As they reached the stoop, their hands brushed together one final time, before the stranger reached up to brush a stray strand of hair out of Draco's eyes. At that moment, there was no escaping the connection between them. As if they were a pair of magnets, they were drawn together, cheeks flushed from the biting cold and the heat between them. The need for privacy dissipated as their lips met in the softest kiss either had experienced. For Draco, it was the first kiss they would ever share together, the start of something new and exciting, forcing him to push forward ever so slightly.
"Of course Mr Malfoy-Potter, I'll tell the caterers right away," with a quick nod she rolled up the parchment and apparated away, a loud crack echoing through the room as she did so. Now that Draco's assistant was gone, his attention focused on his husband, casually leaning up against a table filled with sample platters for taste testing. Striding towards him, Harry was struck by how agile Draco was, smoothly bypassing the mass of people hurrying around trying to ensure that every last detail for the ball was perfect.
With all of that pressure and weight being thrust upon them, it was no wonder they themselves had begun to crumble under the constantly watching eyes, inevitably leading to the cracks forming within their relationship. Resentment and anger had begun to bleed through, neither wanting to talk about the hurt they were personally feeling, but knowing that it would likely never stop. Communication was the key to all relationships working, and they had stopped communicating some time ago.
"I miss it too Harry. I miss it so much, but I don't know if we can ever go back to being what we were. I don't know if I can put my heart on the line for you like that again," it was everything he had expected to hear, and yet wished he wouldn't. It was understandable, why would Draco willingly put himself back in the line of fire, opening himself up to potentially being hurt once again. If anything, it would have been more surprising if he had said yes and thrown himself back into a relationship with Harry. How could he have expected him to immediately say yes to such a huge thing, and yet he was still willing to fight for the chance.
Pine green eyes flickered towards his partner, assessing the way Draco's hands gripped at the newspaper, threatening to tear through the pages at a moment's notice. His steel grey eyes flashed with rage as they glared down at the identical eyes staring up at him from the paper. Another story about his father had been published that morning, another story questioning how the boy-who-lived could dare to date Death Eater's son.
The potions classroom was practically silent, students hunched over their work stations as they prepared their ingredients, no one daring to make a noise. Professor Snape prowled between the rows of children, watching as they diligently attempted to slice and crush each ingredient to his extremely high standards. Draco's hands moved swiftly as he diced away at the Adder's Tongue in front of him, Harry squirming next to him, gagging as he scooped Flobberworm Mucus into the brass scales sat between them.
Drabble Prompt - Day 3) Bulky
"Oh alright Harry, we won't embarrass you anymore," James rolled his eyes towards his husband, before pointing towards an empty carriage of the train. "Here you are boys, one empty carriage for you to snog in." He chuckled, before ushering them onto the train, lifting Hedwig and her cage up into the train. Slipping a piece of chicken between the bars, James gave the faithful owl a scratch on the head before passing her over to his son.
"That's fair I suppose, but then you haven't been exactly forthcoming with your own details," Draco reminded him, receiving a shy smile in return for the teasing remark.
"I didn't want it to be like that, I didn't want to do that to you." The pain in his voice was clear, as was the guilt Harry felt, his voice cracking as he spoke. He had never wanted to hurt Draco, he truly loved the boy, and yet he had caused him so much hurt it was agony.
It was difficult to continue on that way, but neither could control themselves. There was no stopping the passion, the waves of lust that rolled over them both as soon as they locked eyes, silver meeting green as their irises dilated with a burning want and desire. That would have to be enough for them, the tragic lovers that stood no chance in the world they lived within.
"You didn't offend me, you did surprise me though, no one's ever done something like that for me, I wasn't expecting it," he sent the green eyed stranger a smile as they turned the corner, swerving slightly to avoid a thick section of slippery ice.
Teeth dug into the plump flesh of his bottom lip as he paced the length of The Owlery, just waiting for his companion to arrive. He was late, and that was never a good thing. Their relationship was secretive, hidden from the prying eyes of the world. Neither wanted to feel the disappointment and weight of others expectations thrust upon them, something that they knew would happen as soon as their involvement became public knowledge. It was better, safer, for them to stay hidden, to stay a secret that refused to be spilled from their lips.
"I won't I swear, I vow I'll do anything for us to work," the honesty was so clear in his voice, that Draco knew he would do anything to save themselves and their relationship. It made it easier to try again, knowing that they were both willing and ready to put the effort in.
Glancing down at the tanned hand keeping him stable, Draco risked a glimpse up at the man who had saved him, blue eyes meeting emerald green, Draco felt a connection to the stranger that he had never felt before. "Thank you, for keeping me upright," he spoke softly, receiving little more than a nod from his mysterious stranger before heading off into the city, intent on hurrying home before anymore snow began to fall.
They both knew that they should have ended such an affair long ago, that putting it off, clinging to one another in the hope that something would change was selfish. They had accepted that they were selfish people who clung to those small moments in time where they could be emotional, sharing their feelings with one another and knowing in that moment, they were free to be who they wanted to be. It was selfish of them to give one another such false hope, knowing that it could never happen, but clinging to the mirage they had created.
Once again, Draco was hurrying out of the bar, this time the snow was already falling in thick sheets, and he could barely feel his feet from the numbness that had started to spread throughout his body. His uniform did not provide the warmth that he desperately wished for, instead the thin material of his trousers and t-shirt welcomed the shill as he wrapped his thin cardigan around himself as tightly as possible.
"It wasn't a problem, I thought it would be a nice thing to do, sorry if i offended you," he worried his lip with his teeth, an anxious tone to his voice as he spoke, clearly hoping that Draco hadn't taken offence to someone helping him out. Neither had realise that as they spoke, they had begun to talk their way through the city, clearly the stranger had been intent on making sure he got home safely once again.
Drabble Prompt - Day 5) Blade
"Not really, something seems to have caught my eye around here though," he murmured softly.
"Draco, could you be a dear, and grab the floo powder from the kitchen? It should be in a jar the tall cupboard," Regulus directed.
~Thursday~
Draco knew he shouldn't have gotten attached as easily as he had, it had only been a week after all. It was in that moment that Draco realised the first kiss they had shared together, would be their last. There would be no more kisses from his mysterious saviour, no one waiting for him to finish work or to walk home during the lonely cold nights. Draco knew it had been too good to be true, but he hadn't expected this.
"Well, I wouldn't say predictable perhaps, but you have made a habit of being here every evening this week bar last night," leveling a stern look upon his face as he gazed at the man, Draco remembered the pre-booked and aid for taxi from the night before. "By the way, thank you for the taxi. I forgot my wallet and I'm sure you saw all of that snow, so I'm very thankful, but you didn't have to do that."
"Leave off Harry, I think it's adorable that your parents are still so in love!" Draco exclaimed from his side.
"Anyway, thank you so much for both yesterday and today, I definitely appreciate the umbrella," Draco started, grabbing the sodden jacket he had draped over his shoulders and lifting it above his head. "I've got to head back in now, but thanks for stopping and giving me that shield, this rain is nasty!"
"I can hear you laughing Draco! It's not funny!"
"Fine, you can pick something different. But please don't get something weird and disgusting," Harry could just imagine some of the things that Draco could potentially make him eat. He had witnessed his boyfriend eating octopus and fish eggs, there was no telling what Draco had up his sleeve. He just prayed that it was something recognisable at least.
"We're coming Reggie! No need to panic now, this isn't our first trip on the Hogwarts Express," the boy sauntered down the stairs, carding a hand through the black curls he inherited from his father. Behind him, his boyfriend followed, blonde hair sticking up in all directions, giving away what they had been up to before Regulus had interfered.
"Yeah Harry, we're adorable," James stuck his tongue out at his son, before smirking slightly as he carried on teasing. "Anyway, how'd you think you came about if we weren't-"
"Please stop!" Harry begged. "Dad, make him stop!"
"I guess this is goodbye then?"
"Wow," the stranger murmured. "I guess that keeps you pretty busy alongside working at the bar then?"
"See, I told you he had it out for me," Harry whispered sharply as Draco rolled his eyes, shoving the ladle into his hands while swapping places.
"Yes I'm trying!" Draco huffed, blowing out a deep breath of air as he continued to tug at the door. "I need you to push as I pull Harry, our combined strength should make it open." Harry huffed before moving closer to the door, propping his broomstick up against the wall before pushing against the door with all of his might. He could hear Draco on the other side as he puffed and struggled, and still, the door refused to move.
"Ew, fish. Does it have to be fish?" It was impossible to not let out the moan of disgust as Harry imagined a big pink fish, flopping about on his plate. He could guarantee that it would be nothing like the crispy cod and salty chips he preferred at the local takeaway, soaked in vinegar and oil.
"Oh really, well that's a lovely thing to tell a person who is trapped in a room, you utter imbecile," he snapped.
Freezing at the sight before him, Draco turned up the volume, struggling to comprehend the sight before him. There he was, the mysterious stranger from outside the bar, the one who'd saved him on Monday, held an umbrella over his head on Tuesday, paid for a taxi to take him home on Thursday and kissed him just yesterday.
"Dad! Really? That was so unnecessary!" The adults both snickered as the two teens scrunch their faces up in disgust, unable to believe the direction the conversation had turned.
It had never occurred to him that Harry would go first, struck down by an unknown curse while chasing a new batch of wickedly dark and evil wizards. Draco had never believed he would have to face a future alone, sat by his husband's bed side, watching as he slowly faded and the final wisps of his life force slipped from his body. It was ridiculous of him to think that Harry was safe from the clutches of death and that Draco was safe from the ever growing reach of loneliness.
"Well, I suppose I could forgive you for that indiscretion, after all, we're friends now. I'll see you tomorrow, I'm going to finally teach you how to prepare your potions ingredients correctly, I can't stand to watch you make a mess of it anymore," With that being the intended end of the conversation, Draco turned and continued to saunter his way towards the Slytherin common room, leaving behind a very confused, yet happy, Harry.
Silence filled the cottage that he once shared with Harry. No longer was it filled with warmth and laughter, now it was a cold and empty shell, a painful reminder of what once was and what could have been. It had become a painful memory and not the home that Draco used to hurry back to, it wasn't the place it had once been. Shadows creeped and lurked in the corners, memories of arguments and the hollow emotions of pending loneliness seeped through the brick walls. It was not the beacon of love and life it used to be, instead a cold reminder of everything he had lost and could not recapture.
"More like he doesn't want me to distract you," Harry muttered watching as his boyfriend scraped the diced tongue into the cauldron. Almost immediately it transitioned from a bright buttercup yellow into a vivid fuchsia that Harry would have never expected. The art of brewing potions had never been his forte, something that Snape had no issue with picking up on.
"Sure thing Regulus, why don't you help me Harry?" The pair shared a sneaky grin as Harry began to rapidly nod his head, moving to follow his boyfriend, until a hand on his chest forcefully held him in place.
He had been clueless as to what had been happening, not only to Harry and their relationship, but to himself and the way he was changing. He had lost his way, he didn't know who he was anymore, what he was doing with his life or where he was going. Surely the only thing that was left was downhill, he needed to make some changes, because he couldn't continue on the path he was heading down. He knew that if he did, Draco would end up penniless and alone, his fake friends having fled for someone with deeper and richer pockets, while those who truly loved him would have been pushed away some time previously.
Draco didn't think that he could catch him if he tried. He struggled to understand how it had happened, how he had managed to push away someone who was so loyal to him. Constantly there for him, lending a listening ear and calm reassuring words when things didn't go right. It was Harry who had always believed in Draco and his musical endeavours, that there was absolutely a chance for him to break through the music industry. It was Harry that had booked him his first few gigs, driving him up and down the breadth of England, guitar wedged in the boot while Theo, Blaise and later Pansy were squished into the backseat. It was also Harry that would cheer the loudest at every performance, singing along to every word and watching him become a well known rockstar right before his eyes.
But goblins are forgotten the moment the vault door opened and Harry saw the fortune his parents have left him. Minnie told him he needn’t take out too much, since she or his godfathers are more than capable and willing to buy his school supplies for him. So he took enough for treats and presents he can get for his guardians now that he has some money –
“Fuck off Ginny,” Harry with a grin, “I did not have a hard on for Draco back then.”
“Harry!” She didn’t sound angry, she sounded shocked. “You have to come over to the Muggle Liaison Office.”
Without thinking Harry said
“It’s three in the morning, of course I’m in bed.”
“And you used magic. Why did you use your magic?”
Peace and love xx
The other four looked at him in shock.
“You will do no such thing,” Draco said appalled. “If you apparate the state you’re in you’ll splice off an arm, and I happen to like your arms so please keep them attached to your body. We’ll get you a cab.”
As the movie played Harry could see Draco becoming engrossed in the story. By the time ET lay dying in the field hospital Draco was crying, and at the end, as ET points at Elliot’s forehead saying
“But you are always such a twat to me.”
was at Malfoy Manor it was awful, the noise of……well…..you know. Anyway I persuaded one of the house elves to get me a Muggle guitar and I locked myself in my room learning to play so I didn’t have to hear what was going on in the house.”
“I’m just having lunch with him,” Harry muttered. “We’re not seeing each other or anything, we’re not even friends really.”
“Umm, no. I don’t have a CD player.” Harry mumbled.
“Where did you learn that?” Harry asked.
“When I said I left the wizarding world I meant I totally left it, I haven’t seen a Quidditch game since before the battle. I am rather enjoying muggle soccer now, more kicking, less broomsticks.” Draco took a sip of his wine. “You must be very proud of Ginny.”
“It’s a metal detector, to check that people aren’t carrying knives or something.” Hermione replied.
Harry could hear heavy footsteps moving away, he tried to open his eyes; it was an effort just to make that small movement.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes. The band is making me miserable, I used to love being out on tour with the guys but I hate it now.”
“Your aura has changed, I can see Draco’s energy around you, it’s intertwined with yours. It’s quite beautiful actually. So you and Draco are together?”
“Ok, ok,” Harry said trying to calm the other boy down. “But you can’t go on like this, you need help.”
This was the same conversation they’d had almost every week since the war had ended and Harry had returned to his godfather’s house. Kreacher had fought in the Battle of Hogwarts, leading the house elves to attack the Death Eaters, and he had taken several injuries during the fighting. Harry had tried time and again to give Kreacher his freedom but the stubborn elf continually refused and insisted on serving Harry until he died, although Harry was pretty sure that the elf would outlive him.
Harry threw the floo powder into the fireplace and headed home.
Despite the pain of his wounds this was the happiest Harry had been in months, years even. He was with the man he loved, and who loved him back, and his best friends seemed to be finally accepting Draco into their lives.
Draco led them through a maze of walkways to the stage, Harry could hear the chant of the crowd growing louder as they walked.
“Thanks Gin, that means a lot to me,” Harry smiled. “You know I never meant to hurt you, I just hadn’t figured out my sexuality back then.”
Harry was undecided at what to do, he was definitely attracted to Draco but it would be hard to have a relationship with him, there was a lot of history to get over. Harry checked the time, it was already nearly five; he was covered in dust, cobwebs and pieces of dead beetles, he needed to shower, get dressed and out the door in 30 minutes if he was going to make it for six. He made his decision. Throwing the broomstick twigs in the bin, much to Kreacher’s annoyance, Harry closed up the room and ran to his bedroom to get ready as quickly as he could. He was ready in twenty five minutes which was less than half the time he took that morning but looking in the mirror he couldn’t tell the difference between taking over an hour to get ready and under half an hour. Leaving explicit instructions with Kreacher to not open the bedroom and rescue the twigs Harry raced out the house to catch a cab. It was Saturday evening; getting a cab took longer than before and the traffic was heavier so it was six fifteen by the time Harry got to the venue and gave his name to the doorman. He was given another laminated pass and ushered into the hospitality suite. Draco was leaning against the back wall with a smirk on his face, he beckoned Harry over and made a show of checking the time.
“I need proper food, the food on tour is appalling.”
Harry picked up his wine and the opened bottled following Luna into the dining room off the kitchen. A huge smile broke out over Neville’s face as he hugged first Luna and then Harry.
01.31
The waitress returned with their food, she smiled at Draco brushing her hand against his as she placed his plate in front of him. Draco smiled back and for an instant Harry felt a stab of jealousy.
Molly ushered everyone back into the kitchen where the table was laden down with roast turkey and all the trimmings. Meal times at the Weasley’s were not for the fainthearted and Harry noted that Draco was somewhat shocked as everyone dug in, leaning across each other to fill plates, passing dishes back and forwards. Harry was sure that meal times at Malfoy Manor had been a much more formal affair, but Draco seemed to be enjoying himself talking to Arthur who was enthralled by the world of Muggle music and was peppering Draco with questions.
“Never, it’s hilarious.”
It was a typical London morning in September, the streets were damp from an earlier rainstorm that had thankfully stopped, but it had left the air feeling damp and chilly. Harry had moved to London after the war taking over his godfather’s house and, despite being able to floo to work, still occasionally enjoyed riding the tube as he had in his youth. After the short walk from the Ministry building, Harry and Hermione were seated in comfortable armchairs around a small glass table in the
“Draco…..I…I can’t hold on much longer.”
“Thank you Harry,” Draco said when they finally came up for air. “That was the best surprise birthday party I’ve ever had.”
And then it was done.
***************************************************************************
Luna gave a soft smile. “If you say so Ron, but I still think it was meant for Harry.”
“We put some flowers on Dobby’s grave while we were there,” Hermione said, “told him you were doing really well.”
“Just let it go Potter.” Draco’s voice was hoarse with emotion. “You can’t help me.” He dropped his head onto his knees. “No one can help me.”
“I really need to brush up on my Muggle studies,” Harry said. “How did you manage when you first started out in the Muggle world?”
“You have feelings……for me? Like you like me?”
“So you quit? Just like that?” Harry still couldn’t take it in.
Draco’s eyes widened slightly. “Are you saying that you fancy me?”
“Am I better at it than Pansy? You looked like you were thoroughly enjoying it from where I was watching.”
“I never thought he was a monster, just a giant twat. And he’s using magic again, does that mean he’s coming back to the wizarding world. That would make things a lot easier for your relationship.”
“Just open it.”
Draco held up a hand to stop Harry talking. “Are you gay Harry?”
“When was the last time we went on a date Ronald Weasley?” Hermione huffed.

“Are you sure you want to do that? You’ll see my arm and……” Draco couldn’t say the words.
I hope you are enjoying this fic - please leave comments and feedback as they are much appreciated.
“Anything to say Ron? Because I swear to Merlin that if one more nasty remark about Draco comes out of your mouth I’ll ram this bottle down your fucking throat.”
The blast caught Harry full in the chest, he felt his limbs stiffen and he toppled over landing a few feet from Draco, his wand rolling from his hand coming to rest mere inches from the blonde.
“It’s not just a
“I’ll get the champagne,” Ron said, “Proper Muggle stuff from France, I had Fleur send me a crate.”

“If I recall, you punched me from under the invisibility cloak, which wasn’t very sporting.” Draco said rolling his eyes. “And by the way, you hit like a girl.”
Ron snorted. “Why him? Of all the fucking men out there why pick him?”
Peace and love xx
“Bye Harry,” Neville shouted from the floo. “And I kinda think Malfoy is hot too!”
“Umm, remember those girls in the coffee shop?”
“Are you ok?” Draco’s voice was gruff and sensual.
Draco placed the vase on the breakfast bar and carried two glasses of wine over to the seating area. “The Manor feels dark too, dark in more ways than from just lack of natural light.”
“Bloody hell, how did that get there?” Neville removed the offending clump and tossed it in the fireplace. “How is life as a muggle rock star Draco?”
“Jackass,” Harry said with a smile. “Luna is coming over for dinner tonight, I’ve not seen her for a while what with moon frog mating season and a plague of gulping plimpies.”
Draco is back in the Ministry but why is he there? And an invitation leaves Harry confused.
, his face heating with embarrassment at the thought,
Harry pondered all this as he made his way to the Muggle Liaison Office where he found Hermione standing at the door to the office chewing on a fingernail.
The kiss had been long and passionate and after Kreacher had taken Draco back home Harry felt rather lost. The last week had been emotionally intense; years of thoughts and feelings had been brought to the surface, reexamined, blown apart and rebuilt into something new, and whilst Harry was ecstatically happy, his burgeoning relationship with Draco brought new problems into his life. Harry knew Draco had changed from the deceitful, spiteful kid he was at school, nor was he the Death Eater he’d been forced to become, yet there were still a large proportion of the wizarding community, some of his friends among them, who would still judge Draco by his past actions. He needed to talk things through, and whilst Hermione and Ron were his closest friends Ron had already made it clear that he was not willing to give Draco the benefit of the doubt. Neville had always been supportive of Harry and was a good sounding board so he scribbled a quick note and asked Kreacher to take it to Neville, who now lived at Hogwarts. House elves could apparate into Hogwarts whereas wizards couldn’t and Muggle phones did not work within the Hogwarts grounds.
As the waitress left Harry noticed giggling coming from two girls in their late teens who were staring at them from a nearby table. One of the girls got up and walk over to their table, she was blushing furiously as she approached.

Harry groaned. “Cute but boring as fuck. He spent the whole evening talking about the best twenty opening moves at wizard chess.”
“Me?” Harry was shocked. “You want me to be your best man?”
was just about to start.
“I think you have had enough my little Gryffindork,” Draco smiled, “we should see about getting you home.”
“No it’s not a joke. Draco and I, we’re together.”
“Rowle,” Harry slowly released Draco’s hand ready to push him away if the dark wizard made a move. “What rock did you crawl out from under?”
3 months later......
What did Muggles wear to a rock concert? Harry had no idea so he called Dudley who now ran a successful plumbing business, and had in fact replaced all the plumbing at Grimmauld Place. After laughing, not unkindly, for a good five minutes Dudley suggested black jeans, t-shirt and a leather jacket. Harry had rifled through his wardrobe finally settling on an old faded pair of black jeans with tears in both knees, a plain black t-shirt, and a lightweight black hoodie in lieu of a leather jacket. After unsuccessfully trying to tame his hair in to some kind of style Harry shouted a goodbye to Kreacher and set out to meet Hermione, Ron and Luna at Alexandra Palace.
Harry walked over to the windows and looked out, the view was spectacular giving a clear view over the lock and the busy streets below.
Harry didn’t have a clue what Draco was talking about. “I’ll get you some new chakras, just come for a walk.”
Harry held out his hand to receive the envelope but the clerk hesitated. “I…I wasn’t sure whether I should give it to you but I didn’t know what else to do.”
Drunk Harry is kind of cute :)
Harry threw a knight at Draco. “Don’t get all sulky when Nev beats you, you know how you hate losing.”
“At that time Luna was the only person who reached out to me, it meant a lot to me.”
“Of course Master Harry, I have prepared her favourite; turmeric and ginger soup with duckweed cress.” Kreacher saw the look of disgust on Harry’s face. “Master Harry will be served beef stew with dumplings.”
Draco made his way to the mic stand in total darkness. This was the song, Harry remembered, where he stood alone in the spotlight with a quiet acoustic band behind him.
Harry felt bad for the elf. “I’ll go back to the library, I’ll pretend I haven’t seen it. It will be our secret.”
“Thank you Hermione, and I hear you are doing great things at The Ministry.” Malfoy turned to Ron. “I also hear that Weasley’s Wizards Wheezes is doing very well.”
“I’m sorry babe,” Draco whispered into Harry’s hair, “touring is really hard on me. I had to de-stress properly so that I could be myself. So that I could be with you.”
was the last thought Harry had before the world went black.
“But what would Kreacher do? Kreacher lives to serve Master Harry.” The elf made an attempt at a bow but his knees gave way and he toppled over.
The hat in McGonagall’s hands began to sing.
“Bloody amazing,” Draco smiled, “but I think we need to clean ourselves up.”
Harry flicked through the photos, they were mostly of Draco but one photo shot from the side of stage had captured Harry, Luna, Hermione and Ron. Harry clicked on a video but Ron leaned over and shut the laptop down.
Harry was shocked to see tears form in Draco’s eyes. “Are you ok? I’m sorry if I upset you.”
***********************************************
“It’s ok Harry, I’m not expecting us to be best friends overnight, but if you are willing maybe we could stay in touch, see how things go?” The sincerity in Draco’s eyes told Harry what he needed to know.
It was only a short walk to the studio. It was smaller than Harry had imagined and the control room contained a huge desk full of hundreds of buttons, sliders and computer screens.
“Took a quick trip to Malfoy Manor this morning. I still have a fully stocked potions room there.” Draco handed Harry a small vial containing a murky brown sludge. “Yes, it does taste as bad as it looks but it will help.”
Hermione glared at him. She grabbed the wand and two tickets. “You go through and stay with Luna, we will meet you in there in a few minutes.”
Draco smiled. “That means the world to me Harry, and as much as I wish to stay I do really need to get home, do you think Kreacher could take me?”
It had snowed overnight, carpeting the world in a blanket of white; Draco wrapped Harry up in a big winter coat, gloves, scarf and hat and took him out to walk through the grounds. The grounds were vast, covering several acres, with many groves of trees where Draco said he had played with Pansy, Theo and Vincent when they were children. Draco led Harry past the yew hedges, snow crunching underfoot as they walked, to a landscaped terrace. The fountain in the center of the terrace had frozen in mid flow creating a spectacular ice sculpture, it reminded Harry of the decorations at the Yule Ball back in forth year at Hogwarts. Draco wiped the snow off an iron bench, pulled Harry down to sit next to him, draping an arm across Harry’s shoulders. They sat in silence for a while looking back at the Manor in the distance.
Harry smiled, Neville was always so practical and thoughtful, always ready to help out his friends.
Harry moved to sit next to Draco. “Hug?”
“Ok, I’ll be there in a few minutes,” Harry said taping the disk to end the call.
’ during his troubled years at Malfoy Manor, so the songs were all complete when the band formed, but now all the band members wanted input into the new album and the tracks were not coming together very well with four different writing styles.
Draco pulled back, Harry’s cock falling from his mouth with a soft pop. “Sit.”
A bit of a fluffy chapter!
Draco spent hours recoding the vocals for ‘
Harry gave a small nod and placed a soft kiss on Draco’s lips. Draco let out a low moan as Harry trailed a hand across his chest. Harry was enthralled by the softness of his skin it was like silk, totally smooth and hairless, he then walked his fingers down his stomach following the thin line of fine white hairs that led down under the waistband of Draco’s trousers. The bulge concealed beneath the fabric jumped when Harry popped the button and pulled down the zip, and as he pulled the material away he could see a wet patch on the underpants where some pre-come had leaked out. Harry pulled both trousers and underwear down over Draco’s hips revealing his hard manhood jutting from a thatch of platinum blonde hairs. Harry had never seen or touched another man’s erect penis before and he hesitated slightly, Draco seemed to sense his nervousness and resumed his stroking of Harry’s hard dick. That was all the encouragement Harry needed, he wrapped his hand around Draco’s rigid member and began to stroke him in time with Draco’s movements on his own cock. The blonde’s cock was slightly longer than Harry own dick so he adjusted his stroke to accommodate the additional inch.  Draco gripped Harry harder than he would when he wanked himself but with a slower stroke, the combination was one he found he liked and he moaned as Draco completed another languid stroke. Draco leaned in and smashed his lips against Harry’s; the kiss was passionate, fierce, hungry. Draco increased the pace of his strokes, Harry followed suit knowing neither would not last long now before they came.
“I want to see you,” Harry growled, “I don’t care about the mark.”
Harry let out his breath in a ragged gasp as Draco’s hand closed around his throbbing erection, pulled back the foreskin and ran his thumb over the tip smearing pre-come across the engorged head.
“He’s doing great, although McGonagall sent him a rather stern letter about the exploding inkwells after a student placed several in a Quidditch ball box and they exploded in Madam Hooch’s face.”
“Well I was right to follow him, he was trying to kill Dumbledore!” Harry said hotly.
Harry pulled the map out of his book bag reciting the spell to reveal the markers and, out of habit, checked the map for Draco’s name. Crabbe and Goyle appeared to be making their way back to their common room but Draco was not with them. That was highly unusual. Draco had been using the two Slytherin thugs to act as lookouts, even using Polyjuice potion to disguise them, and was rarely without them by his side. Harry scanned the parchment eventually finding Draco’s marker in a storage room by the transfiguration classroom, and he was alone. This was his chance; Harry had been following Draco for weeks but had never managed to catch him without his henchmen in tow. With a wry smile Harry left the library and made his way through the castle following the map to Draco’s marker.
Harry received a second text with the address for the restaurant.
“Please don’t take this the wrong way,’ Draco said, “but I’m so tired I don’t think I would do myself any justice tonight.”
“She’s great thanks Kreacher,” Neville stepped out of the fireplace and shook off the remnants of floo powder from his clothes.
Harry picked at his dinner whilst casting furtive glances at Draco. The blonde was pushing around the food on his plate but Harry had not seen him take a single bite, in fact Harry couldn’t remember the last time he had seen him eat a full meal. He’d been watching him for weeks and with the exception of the earlier incident in Snape’s classroom Draco had been quiet and withdrawn all term.
Harry grimaced. After he had come out as gay he had spent several months hanging out at gay bars having random hookups with men that he didn’t even like, desperately trying to find someone to be with. His friends had staged an ‘intervention’ one night gently telling him that being gay was exactly like being straight, finding ‘the one’ would not happen with a pickup from a bar but it would just happen naturally when he found someone he liked. Since then he had been on a few dates, even had a short-lived relationship with a wizard from the Portkey department, but had still not been able to find someone he wanted to be with.
Harry hesitated then took Malfoy’s hand. “And you Draco.” He was surprised that he actually meant it.
“Are you in bed?”
Ron rubbed the back of his neck. “Well, he did save your life, and he was proper upset when we got here, he was a total mess. It’s obvious he cares about you.”
Harry snorted. “You can try.”
“Go on Pans, have a drink,” Draco cajoled seeing Harry’s discomfort, “it will help you relax. I know you get all jittery being around Muggles”
Draco paled. “I don’t think I can do that. I don’t have good memories of the last time I was there.”
Peace and love xx
*********************************************************************************
“What? That’s brilliant mate!” Ron grinned.
The dinner was amazing, Ron really was an excellent cook, and as Hermione and Luna set the table for dessert Neville raised the topic that Harry had been avoiding all night.

“You’re leaving? You mean I won’t see you for weeks?” Harry’s heart constricted at the thought of not seeing Draco for weeks.
“Malfoy Manor holds a lot of bad memories for me but having you here is helping me build new, happy ones.”
“What’s going on Malfoy?” Harry asked gently. “You look awful. No offence.”
“The now is because after going to the Ministry I want to see if I can fit back in the wizarding world, I’m not sure I want to but I would like know if it’s possible. The why you…..” Draco looked Harry directly in the eyes, “It’s you because you are the one person that I wanted to be my friend then, and I still want you to be my friend now.”
he’ll always be Malfoy to me.”
Draco tugged at Harry’s sweatshirt pulling it up over his torso, his lips only leaving Harry’s for a second as the shirt passed over his head. Harry fumbled as he tried to remove Draco’s shirt, swearing as he yanked it off and threw it on the floor. Lips still joined Draco walked Harry backwards to the bed, pushing him lightly on his back before climbing on to straddle him. Harry ran a finger across the fine silvery scars that crisscrossed Draco’s chest.
Draco pawed through the bags from the supermarket, muttering about garlic, lemon and rosemary.
“Vividly, my ribs ached for a week.” Draco smiled at the memory. “I seem to remember I made you dance around like an idiot in return.”
“It wasn’t the kind of thing I could talk about in my family. It had been arranged for me to marry Daphne Greengrass, but after the war the agreement, thankfully, was broken.’
“Put me on speaker.”
“Why now?” Harry asked, “and why me?”
“Do you see now?” Draco hissed. “There are no choices, there is no way out.”
Dinner was fantastic as usual, Kreacher had glowed with happiness as they all complimented him on his superb meal and then scurried away to make up boxes for Neville and Ron to take with them. The friends took their wine and slices of birthday cake into the lounge to relax and play a few hands of exploding snap.
“One more movie,” Draco said, “and then dinner. And I’m choosing this time, no more sad kids movies.”
“You didn’t give me much warning, traffic was terrible and –“
“There’s someone here, a dark wizard, I can feel it.” Harry kept his eyes on the shadows. “They must have trailed me here somehow, maybe saw me at the Leaky Cauldron this afternoon.”
Harry knew that this was the real question for Draco. “Yes Draco, I fancy all of you.”
“I can’t believe it, Draco Malfoy playing in a Muggle band to Muggle audiences.” Harry plopped down into one of the chairs outside the department door. “What the hell is that all about?”
“That’s a rather long and complex story but that is not important right now. What matters is what it does.”
“Err, yes, really, umm, nice. Kreacher can you put them in a vase?”
Harry smiled, Luna worked part time at The Quibbler with her father and still insisted that Nargles and other creatures existed despite any evidence to support them. After the war Luna had studied to be a mind healer and had helped several students deal with the trauma that had effected them all in one way or another. During the first year after they left Hogwarts she had sent Harry, Hermione and Ron a letter every month nattering on about her quest to find the elusive Crumple-Horned Snorkacks or some other random creature. Luna had often included pressed flowers, leaves or twigs from her garden in the letters, which Harry had discarded, but the letters had been very welcome in those first few months as he tried to adjust from being at Hogwarts to becoming a trainee Auror. He'd found it very lonely to be without his friends and  Luna's letters always made him smile.
After the last guest had headed for home Harry and Draco sat on the bench, as they had on Christmas Eve, looking back at Malfoy Manor.
“Do you want to Harry?” Hermione asked. “We could just thank him and then leave?”
“He’s up to something,” Harry said turning his gaze back to the Slytherin table, “I know he’s up to something. He’s using the Room of Requirement and I just need to find out why.”
Harry heard the whole story as Hermione dressed his wounds. Draco’s disarming spell had nudged Rowle’s wand just enough that the slicing spell had grazed Harry’s side rather that hitting him full on. The wounds had still been substantial and Harry was bleeding profusely; Draco had picked Harry up and apparated them to the only place he could think of where he had medical supplies, Malfoy Manor. He had placed Harry on the bed in his old bedroom, the sheets stained red with Harry’s blood within minutes. Draco knew his healing skills were not sufficient and that he needed help, he sent one of the house elves to fetch Hermione who had returned with Ron in tow. Draco knew from firsthand experience how deep the spell cut, but between Draco and Hermione they had managed to mend Harry’s broken ribs, stop the bleeding and partially heal the wounds. Harry had lost a lot of blood and the wounds were still fragile, neither Draco nor Hermione thought it was a good idea to move Harry until the healing process had progressed further.
Harry lead them to their seats which were on a raised platform in a closed off area left of the stage marked VIP. The rest of the floor was standing only and the place was quickly filling up with thousands of fans.
Luna tried a spoonful of her soup. “The soup is delicious, quite the best I’ve had for a while.”
“Oh my god really? Lumos Solem?” A second Muggle girl squealed. “I
They meandered through the market for hours; Draco bought a black silk scarf, making Harry promise not to tell Pansy he had bought it from a market stall, and Harry found a beautifully wrought silver hairpin in the shape of an otter that he bought for Hermione’s Christmas present. They ate pita bread stuffed with feta cheese, roasted vegetables and olives as they wandered along the canal and stopped at a pub for a pint of beer. They had just left the pub and were heading back to Draco’s apartment as the storm broke. The sky turned black with thick dark clouds, thunder rolling overhead, lightening flashing and the wind gusting through the trees. The rain started as large, fat drops then became a sheet of water sluicing through the street like a river. Draco and Harry ran for the apartment building, they were soaking wet within seconds and by the time they reached the front door of the complex they were like drowned rats. Up in the apartment Draco gave Harry a warm fluffy towel to dry off with and a pair of sweatpants and a sweatshirt to change into whilst he placed their wet clothes in the dryer.
Harry tapped the disk with his wand to accept the call, he hoped that he wasn’t about to get a tirade of abuse from Hermione over papers ruined with coffee. She could rival a Howler when she really got going.
“Does it feel good?” Draco’s voice was low and heavy, “I bet it feels good.”
“I had suspicions, I always thought you had a crush on Malfoy at school, you paid more attention to him than me in sixth year. Honestly I don’t know what took you so long, I mean you and Draco have had hard ons for each other for years.”
They sat holding each other for a while longer, both boys hanging on to the last few minutes, dragging them out until Draco stood and pulled Harry to his feet.
“You ok Harry?” Pansy asked.
Harry had no answer for that. There was a soft knock and Kreacher hesitantly opened the lounge door.
“A wizard spell is on the Muggle internet?” Harry asked. “How does that even happen?”
“Have fun darling, break an arm,” Pansy whispered back.
“Come on Potter, let’s get this over with.” Draco raised his wand and pointed it at Harry.
Ron disappeared off to buy some drinks whilst the rest settled in their seats to watch the opening act, a hideously loud band that more screamed the songs than sang them. Halfway through the third song Hermione snuck Ron’s wand from her purse and cast a muffling spell around them, making the band infinitely more bearable.
“I should be going, let you get some rest.”
Harry and Draco took the floo to The Burrow early afternoon and arrived to a cacophony of noise and the aroma of roasting turkey. Draco had confessed to Harry that he was very nervous, although he was now on relatively friendly terms with Ron he was still anxious about meeting with the rest of the Weasleys. His father had been particularly nasty to Arthur, there was no love lost between them, and he had used Ginny to open the Chamber of Secrets where she had almost died. For his part Draco had mercilessly taunted and mocked the Weasley family throughout his years at Hogwarts and had almost killed Ron with the poisoned wine meant for Dumbledore. Harry had assured him that Molly would not have invited him if he were not welcome.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Of course it’s not fair, that’s why I did it.”
When Harry looked confused Draco sighed. “To clarify, to keep him from learning about my feelings for you.”
Harry began to rock his hips forwards pushing himself into Draco’s mouth, his fingers grabbed a handful of blonde hair, pulling at it as he neared his climax. He opened his eyes to look down to see Draco kneeling between his legs, pumping himself to the same rhythm, the head of his beautiful cock glistening with pre-come.
Hermione and Ron both looked at him.
“I’m sorry Hermione,” Harry said, “I didn’t mean for you to be mad at him.”
“Guilt, I feel guilty. Ron and Hermione are my best friends and I’ve not told them about Draco, and Ron…well he doesn’t like Draco.”
“Arm, leg, who cares. Muggle’s have such silly sayings.”
Harry’s heart sank to his stomach. “Can’t we just lose the memory of you telling me about Dumbledore? Keep the memories of us, the memories of being together?”
Harry drew Draco into a hug and held him until his crying subsided. “Magic isn’t evil Draco, evil is the people who use it to hurt others.”
In spite of himself Harry smiled. “No, it’s not gobstones guy.”
“Actually,” Luna said, “Draco is a very sensitive person, he never wanted to see anyone hurt, and I don’t think he will ever touch magic again even though he can.”
Draco laughed. “It was tiring. I don’t get to see anything except the tour bus, hotels and the venues. It all looks the same after a while. Sometimes I have to tape the name of the city we’re in to the mic stand so I don’t say the wrong place name at the show.”
“The slow one just before the end, ‘My Heart is Green’ I think it is called.”
“Yes, oh fuck yes.”
******************************************************
“Drinks,” Harry said quickly before Draco could start to undress, “we need drinks!”
“Lock him up in Azkaban!”
“Ere, you can’t take that in, might take an eye out wiv that. Why are you taking a stick in wiv you anyway?”
Hermione was showing Harry the engagement ring, a sparking diamond set into white gold, as Ron handed him a glass of champagne.
Harry raised his head. “You made me a potion? Where did you make a potion?”
Draco dropped a kiss on Harry’s forehead. “I always call you Harry in my mind.”
“Happy Christmas Harry, and I suppose you can wish ferret face a happy Christmas from me too.” Ron gave Harry a cheeky grin and disappeared into the mob of people inside the shop.
“Thanks Kreacher!”
“Because I love you my beautiful little Gryffindork,” the smile that lit up Draco’s face was something that Harry wanted to hold in his memory forever, “because I love you.”
“Your songs are so good D, I’ve been listening to them all week.”
“That’s the third morning in a row that Malfoy has skipped breakfast,” Harry said.
“You’ll be just fine Nev,” Harry said with a smile, “just remember to check in the mirror before you go to class.”
“What the fuck Malfoy? Why?”
The long slim box flew into his hand. Harry had wrapped it in green tissue paper with a green ribbon. “This is for you Draco.”
Neville shook his head. “It’s fine Harry,”
– slower track
do the Yorkshires?” Ron yelled back.
Harry’s stomach squeezed into knots. It had been Draco that had cast the
Draco led Harry to the bedroom, he held Harry’s face in his hands kissing him gently, running his tongue along Harry’s bottom lip then darting it in to Harry’s mouth. He swirled his tongue around Harry’s mouth connecting with his tongue, placed a hand on the back of Harry’s head and pulled him closer, crushing their lips together. Draco tangled his fingers into unruly brown locks whilst the other slipped under Harry’s shirt tracing small circles on the skin of his back. A soft moan escaped Harry’s mouth as Draco pressed his body against him, the blonde’s erection digging into Harry’s hip as he ground his pelvis against him.
“Doesn’t make up for the two times we saved Malfoy’s arse during the Battle of Hogwarts,” Ron said, but there was no malice in his words and he had a ghost of a smile on his lips.
“Really?” Hermione said rolling her eyes dramatically.
Hermione giggled. “Ok, he is boring, but you’ll find the right guy one day Harry, I know you will.”
“What?” Ron said a forkful of mashed potato poised halfway to his mouth. “I’m a growing boy, I need a lot of food to keep this mean machine in tip top condition.”
“Actually you need to thank Pansy for the potion.”
“So where’s ferret face then?”
“I’ve been wanking about you ever since,” Harry admitted, a blush staining his cheeks.
Draco led Harry in to the recording studio, the walls were painted a scarlet red with grey trim and the black ceiling was dotted with hundreds of tiny lights. It reminded Harry of the backdrop curtain at Draco’s shows.
“And you kept the twigs?”
is Malfoy.”
“Before we settle down for the start of term feast we will have the sorting ceremony. When I call your name please step forward, sit on the stool and the hat will sort you into your house.”
“Thank you for coming Harry, I took the liberty of ordering a bottle of wine, would you like a glass?”
“Thanks for coming. Guess we’ll see you at the venue then?”
Harry looked at his friends. “I don’t know that I can ever forgive him for what he did but if he really is trying then we should at least be civil to him. Anyway we probably won’t see him again now he’s firmly living in the Muggle world.”
“But Ron….”
After several weeks Harry made Draco come over to Grimmauld Place for dinner, he sent Kreacher to fetch him because Harry knew that, left alone, Draco would eat nothing and drink gallons of coffee. Kreacher had been appalled at how skinny Draco had become and darted into the kitchen muttering ‘skin and bones’ and ‘needs feeding up’ under his breath. Twenty minutes later they were at the dining table where Kreacher served a thick meaty stew, mountains of buttery mashed potatoes and a steamed chocolate pudding with custard for dessert. Harry had never figured out how Kreacher managed to produce so much food so quickly, especially since he had never seen the elf go food shopping. Draco only ate a small portion of the meal but he did have a large helping of the pudding, after eating Harry had taken him into the study where they curled up together on the sofa in front of a roaring fire.
Back at home that evening after Kreacher had removed Harry’s empty dinner tray and left him a glass of wine, Harry reread Draco’s letter. The letter brought forward a sting of painful memories; Draco had been a total twat at school and had made Harry’s life miserable at times, but far beyond schoolboy teasing and pranks were much darker things. Draco had tried to kill Dumbledore and had hurt other people in his attempts, and although he didn’t kill Dumbledore himself he was instrumental in his death. Draco had worked with the Death Eaters, helped them to follow Voldemort’s plans to bring about the destruction of The Ministry and the death of Harry himself. Yet Harry had seen the desperation in Draco when he confronted him in the bathroom, saw him lower his wand rather than strike at Dumbledore, and heard him deny Harry’s presence at Malfoy Manor. The latter actions were those that Harry testified to at the Malfoy’s trials but even when giving that evidence he did not feel any friendship or warmth towards Draco, he was just doing what was right.
coffee shop, Harry had ordered a large café mocha and a slice of treacle tart whilst Hermione was sipping on a cappuccino with her almond croissant balanced on her knee. Harry placed his coffee cup on the table so he could begin to attack his treacle tart but caught a disapproving ‘tut’ from Hermione.
Malfoy turned his gaze to the three others at the table. “Luna, a pleasure as always, Hermione, Ron, so very good of you to be here. I hope you all enjoyed the show.”
“Yes, for a week or so now.”
Peace and love xx
’ series, and a case of very fine French wine.
They talked for another thirty minutes, despite growing up in the Muggle word Harry hadn’t really lived in it for over five years and a lot of the things Draco spoke about went straight over his head. Equally, some of the wizarding subjects Harry talked about were now outside Draco’s experience. It was a complete role reversal of their lives during their years at Hogwarts. Harry reluctantly ended the call then headed to the kitchen to check that Kreacher had remembered Luna would be coming to dinner.
“Draco didn’t kill Fred.” Harry said, he was surprised his own voice was so calm. “Voldemort caused all those deaths including Fred’s.”
Harry organized the party with the help of Ron as Hermione was busy planning for the wedding next month. Harry wanted a marquee in the grounds of Malfoy Manor, by the terrace with the fountain, with a music and food and fun. Ron was in charge of the marquee and the games and Harry was taking care of the rest. Harry had some fancy invitations printed with the date and time of the party and explicit instructions to not mention it to Draco as it was a surprise. He had invited everyone he could think of including Pansy who had sent Harry a long and vacuous letter giving him suggestions on colour schemes and decorations. Draco was due back from tour two days before his birthday. Harry was going to spend the time with him at his Camden apartment, leaving Ron and George to set everything up, and then take Draco to the Manor for the party. Harry was very pleased with himself, it was going to be the best party ever.
Harry knew it was time to have ‘the talk’, he didn’t want to but they had to talk. He took a deep breath.
“I don’t know, just keep walking.” Harry slipped his wand out of his jacket, “Keep close to me but run if I tell you.”
“You’ve fancied me since then? Since second year?”
“Just a few announcements before we begin our feast. A reminder that Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes exploding inkwells are now banned, and Quidditch trials will take place in three weeks’ time. I am also very pleased to announce that we have three new professors joining the teaching staff this year, and even more delighted that all three are former Hogwarts students. Professor Sprout and Professor Crane have both taken retirement, Professor Longbottom will now be taking over the position as Herbology master and Professor Potter has joined us as Defense Against the Dark Art master. Lastly, I am happy to say that we are now able to reinstate the Muggle Studies class with Professor Malfoy who will also be offering music classes to those who are interested. Please join me in welcoming them back to Hogwarts.”
as good as the day you were turned into a ferret,” he chuckled. “Malfoy, the past is past. If I had continued to hold our Hogwarts days against you, I would not have agreed to take on your case, no matter how many biscuits Harry tried to bribe me with.”
She began to make introductions around the table. Harry smiled and nodded and did his best to remember names. Most of them were from sixth and fifth years in Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. There was a couple from Gryffindor Harry had vaguely seen around the common room; they grinned at him excitedly. There were a number of older students too, alumni who had come back to help. The older man on Luna’s right turned out to be one such volunteer: Luc, who was in seventh year when Harry was in fifth.
‘I don’t have all night, Potter,’ Malfoy says teasingly, raising an eyebrow. ‘Ask me. I promise I won’t bite.’
He waved a hand over his shoulder, the door tinkling shut behind him. He suppressed a groan, pushing his hands into his pockets and setting off down the street.
They part for a breath, and Draco is dropping kisses on his cheek, his chin, his neck, his arms wrapping around Harry tightly. Harry laughs breathlessly, slipping his arms around Draco’s waist. Their bodies press against each other, heat growing between them. There could be no denial now that they are both longing for
She takes a deep breath, glancing at her king, who has not looked away from Eltanin. Eltanin does not know her to be able to read anything in her scent beyond the musk of old books and autumn leaves, but he reads her uneasiness on her face clearly enough.
Draco feels the ground crumbling beneath his feet, his world shifting abruptly. ‘You should have stayed away.’
‘No, and that’s the problem. Neither of them sees what’s happening. Surely Dumbledore knows about this—he watches them at school. Why hasn’t he done anything?’
‘Pity – would be nice to see you there. I’m not keen on going,’ Potter said heavily. ‘Bloody hell, Hermione was saying that girls might try to slip me love potions.’
Draco finds that it is very easy, after all, to be a Veela when people see him for what he is and yet, do not flee. His fingers slide along Harry’s palm and curls around his hand, fingertips resting on the back of the other boy’s hand. The other boy’s hand is warm and clammy. He knows that Harry feels the tug too—somewhere close to the heart—from the way his green eyes widen.
Then Malfoy curled his fingers upwards and hit a spot that made Harry’s mind white out in sheer pleasure. He mewled, back arching, feet curling. When he came back down again, he looked at his lover, about to ask, ‘What the
Regulus pulls away and smiles sadly. ‘I only ask for my brother’s forgiveness. I did this for him, and no one else.’ And the sky splits away with thunder, noise given form as a blast of white light, and Harry is hurtling away backwards through the darkness, pulling relentlessly along by the red thread.
Lucius and Narcissa looked at each other, and at Draco, her eyes flicking to Harry for a split second, and they relented, swearing an Unbreakable Vow to join the Order. Draco wasn’t happy that they had to take the Vow at the insistence of other members. ‘They wouldn’t betray
Harry blinked. Malfoy looked at him, smiling genially. He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, his tailored school robes neatly in place, his silver-and-green tie perfectly knotted. Like the rest of them, he looked like any other eighteen-year-old Hogwarts student; it took a longer gaze to see the dark smudges beneath his unreadable grey eyes and the faint worry lines on his forehead.
‘Fine, fine, I’m coming too!’ Nev says, his jaw set stubbornly.
‘You have been such a good and obedient boy, I forget that you are only six,’ she says, her voice cracking. ‘I’m sorry, Harry. I will do better from now on. You will never have to fear
‘I was too slow,’ Harry mumbles, looking down at the powder glittering on the floor.
, they hear a rustle in the bushes behind them. They look around to see an unkempt wizard two rows over in the midst of shearing a bush. He is frozen, staring at them with wide, goggling eyes, his wand raised in mid-air.
Harry Potter is clearly one of those people who are unafraid of confronting strangers.
Harry laughs, falling with his arms wide open. ‘I’m covered in blood.’
‘Oh, no. Terry’s fancied Lee for ages,’ Luna informed him, taking the empty seat next to him, a crystal goblet of fizzing Dragonfire brandy in her hand.
Harry’s hand is gentle on Draco’s shoulder. Draco startles, his head snapping up because Harry is shaking. Harry is looking at him as if his sky has shattered around him and the darkness is encroaching. He looks at Draco with an inscrutable plea in his eyes.
Harry stares at his friend, thunderstruck. He has stupidly only been thinking about himself. The prophecy says that he will be the one to kill Voldemort; it makes sense that everything related to Voldemort that comes his way must be made into a weapon—
‘Oh,’ Harry said again, feeling slow and stupid. ‘I’m sorry.’ His words tasted like mud.
‘But …’ Harry is frowning down at his spaghetti. ‘Isn’t it … weird knowing who you’re going to marry at eleven? You didn’t have a choice.’
Zabini slammed his hands into Draco’s chest, driving him backwards. The door swung shut behind him. Draco staggered back, hitting a desk.
‘HANG ON!’ Potter screamed over the roar of the Fiendfyre licking at their feet.
Draco gritted his teeth.
, because of what the rags write!’
Harry snorts. ‘Well, you are right in that. Both you and my mother need not fear for my sisters. They are particular about marriage – and rightly so – and I believe that if they should descend into the dreaded spinsterhood, they will do so with grace and aplomp. In any case, I will support them.’
. Do you not remember the shape it has always been, even before you met Harry Potter? That is how you carry on—how I carry on—remembering that I have always been enough for myself, and yes, I love him, I still do, but I … will live. You see?’
,’ he whispered as over his shoulder, Yaxley yelled out, ‘
‘I’m Harry Potter. Sirius is my godfather. He and Remus Lupin raised me,’ he says. ‘Am I really alive?’ He looks down at his grey skin, flipping his hands over. ‘What did they want with me?’
He looks over indifferently. He is peering over Harry’s shoulder at the list of people who signed up for Quidditch try-outs. Narcissa sent a reminder letter this morning, predicting accurately that Draco would forget, and he dropped the elegantly wrapped packages into their laps, as they settled into the common room after dinner.
Potter’s left arm stretches out across the table, his knuckles a hair’s breadth away from Draco’s. Draco can feel the warmth of the other man’s hand, his skin tingling in anticipation. He moves his hand away.
‘Ah! Ah, what’s this? Oh my, yes, you are a Veela, aren’t you? Well, your mind isn’t so different from a wizard’s, you know. Ah, and this soul-bond of yours –’
Draco didn’t have time to wait for
"Alpha—" the omega whines, a hand brushing Eltanin's shoulder.
.’ The last word he spat out in Draco’s direction, spittle landing on Draco’s chest.
‘Oh,’ Harry swallows audibly. ‘That might be because I’m no longer taking suppression potions, don’t you think?’
Harry stood with him, his hands still reaching out. “
Her Draco.
But he can still help. He saw Voldemort attacking Mr Weasley—as a snake; is Voldemort an Animagus?—and Ron’s dad would have died if he had not told Minnie in time. Knowing what Voldemort is doing is saving lives, but Dumbledore becomes only graver when he hears how Harry knew, and he makes Harry take Occlumency lessons with
‘We don’t have any omegas in our year, do we?’ Seamus asks, glancing down the Gryffindor table. ‘I hear there’s an omega in Hufflepuff, a second-year.’
“Mr Malfoy! Mr Malfoy,
Malfoy looks at him with incredulity, a sardonic twist to his lips. ‘And yet, Bennet, you could not have looked at me with more loathing on the first night we reunited.’ He waves a hand, dismissing Harry’s protests. ‘Oh, I am not accusing you of prejudice. I am merely stating a fact. After all, I have made terrible mistakes.’
But Harry cannot be some weakling that needs saving when he must kill the Dark Lord one day. He wakes up some nights, thrashing, feeling desperately useless, with no idea how he is going to save his family and friends from Voldemort.
‘I’ll kill him for you,’ Draco says, and they stare at him, lounging against the headboard, one leg drawn up on the bed. His hair braided over one shoulder, his expression languorous, he sounds as if he has offered to make a cup of tea for Harry.
He presses a hand against Harry’s bare chest, and Harry is moving before the thought even completes in his mind:
All he remembers of
‘I tried, Master!’ he cried, terrified that he might have disobeyed Sirius. ‘Master Regulus told me to destroy it, and I tried and tried, but nothing worked! Oh, I know I have been disobedient, stupid, stupid house elf. You wanted to throw so many of Master Regulus’s things away, but I had to keep this—it is my duty to destroy it!’ So, they gave Kreacher the basilisk fang, and the elf destroyed the locket, his tiny chest heaving with emotion that he had finally managed to obey his beloved master’s last order.
Malfoy freezes. The very air seems to hold its breath – Harry certainly is – before the other man turns around sharply, his face an inscrutable mask.
Draco was dumbfounded. Why would Wormtail’s name appear on a parchment Potter owned? Potter had to know Wormtail helped kill his parents. Not made by Potter and his friends then. He tapped the map again. ‘
It takes another two hours before they come to the meeting point: a circle of enormous heaventrees arranged so perfectly no human hands or wands could have achieved it.
Narcissa, exhausted by the journey, sinks to her knees on the edge of the grove. Lucius drops to the ground next to her. His pale face is pinched with similar fatigue and anxiety. They cannot Apparate or fly; the Fae would not allow them so easy a journey for the bequeath they are seeking here.
Draco’s skin itches, even when they leave the shop behind and the Bubble-Head Charm is removed. He clutches his wand, cool and lifeless in his hand, seeing the worry on his parents’ faces. He knows that no stick can ever make him the wizard he needs to be.
Mathis raises his head, eyes calculative. ‘What purpose did killing them serve?’ he asks, voice low, measured.
Draco shrugged, not liking where this was going. ‘Buggering, hopefully.’ He reached out for Potter, but the other boy caught his hand – his left hand – and held it.
‘My name is Jonas,’ the man announced. ‘And we have sex.’
Harry does not think there is any merit to confer any further on subjects of war. Those matters are in the past, and should remain there, as far as he is concerned. Hermione and Lizzy are a few of those stubborn persons who expatiate frequently on the topic. There is freedom, they said, to be found in finally being able to discuss it.
Potter surged to his feet, his wand pointed at Draco’s chest. Draco took a step back, clutching his wand.
‘You could help us, marry one of us,’ Draco suggested.
Draco’s poor performance in class was attracting the teachers’ attention as well. McGonagall would give Draco her infamous, pinched-lip look of disapproval and Snape was asking to meet Draco, something Draco had been putting off with excuses of Quidditch practice.
There is a hidden alcove behind it, and three people very much engaged in each other’s bodies. One of them—male—moans, ‘Oh, fuck, Zabini, you tart.’ Another voice—female this time—demands, ‘My turn!’
the alpha?’ Draco asks. ‘He’s one of the strongest I’ve scented—besides Dumbledore and myself, of course.’
His family approves of his proposal heartily. While it would be ideal for Harry and all four of his sisters to take the trip together, their obligations at Longbourn mean that only Harry, Jane and Kitty are free to go. Lizzy insists that Kitty will go, and Lydia will stay at home to help her with the horses and Jane’s greenhouse. Lydia, aware at least of what her transgression at the Netherfield ball had cost her eldest sister, accepts her punishment with poor grace.
‘When you were
son and a Black is anything but a coward. Wouldn’t you agree, sister?’
Draco steps back, wiping his muddy hands on his trousers, trying to rub away the sensation of having touched Potter’s waxy skin.
Harry’s heart is beating faster, his skin heating up. He clenches his fists, his palms rather damp. He must not assume – he must not, but oh! He could hope, could not he? It is hope stirring in his breast.It is hope that trembles across his skin. He treads carefully so as not to spill the hope he gathers in his hands.
Harry’s head jerked up, knocking into Draco’s chin.
too weak.
‘Were you not insulted by my presumption?’ Malfoy’s voice is quiet and placid. ‘Were you not furious that I dared equate my experiences during the war to yours?’
The omega growls, grabbing Blaise's arm tightly. "Don't
Draco pulled himself away from the gold cauldron, joining the other Slytherins at the table near a cauldron that only seemed to contain clear plain water.
‘Why did you give him Amortentia?’ Narcissa was being uncharacteristically gentle. Usually, whenever Draco made a mistake, her castigation would be even more searing than Father’s.
might react that holds him back. Will Draco think him a traitor – an omega lurking around him – for keeping it a secret for so long?
Harry feels a piece of driftwood pushed about by the sea of people crowding Diagon Alley. Before today, his idea of a crowd was the Tesco’s off Privet Drive during sales. He clamps his hand tight around Moony’s hand, certain that he lets go, he will get lost – a thought that makes his stomach flip.
‘It’s all right, dear child,’ she says gently. ‘I’m fine. There is no need to be so scared. See?’ She moves her arm up and down. ‘There was no harm done.’
‘Draco, what is on your mind?’ his mother asked. She was smiling at him fondly from where she lay on the hospital bed, her face so pale and her hair so fair she seemed to sink into the white sheets. There were deep bruises beneath her eyes like thumbprints of purple-black ink.
don’t want you to go. Pans and Greg and everybody else, including – including Seamus, you know, you know he’s taken a liking to you – oh, not
‘Hullo, chaps, are we talking about the sexes tonight?’ Seamus asks brightly, wedging himself between Neville and Dean. ‘Oy, budge up, you fat arses.’
They would have heard more, but Tonks catches them, and sends them running upstairs to their rooms. Harry sits cross-legged on his bed, Draco next to him, looking down at his bedspread to avoid his friends’ eyes. Ron and the twins have taken to look at Harry speculatively, as if assessing his ability to kill Voldemort, while Neville would anxiously ask Harry if normal spells work against the Dark Lord.
He hears movement behind him, whirls around—Neville stares at him, wand raised and trembling, face ashen with horror. ‘Draco, don’t,’ he whispers.
Numbly, he points his wand, and whispers, ‘
‘Let’s deal with you now,’ Potter said.
‘Draco, it’s worse. Look,’ Zabini strode forwards, brandishing a newspaper, his face ashen.
you,” Draco snarled, launching himself at his erstwhile friend, curling his hands around that thin, spindly neck.
The silence that greeted his words yawned like a dark pit filled with knives. Draco refused to think what those words might mean, or how Potter was staring at Weasley with horror, or how Granger was grimacing again. The pit was filled with poison-tipped knives, and he could only get sliced to bits.
They return to Hogwarts for sixth year, but school has taken on a patina of unreality, as the wizarding world grapples with Death Eaters in the shadows. The Order and the Ministry have started the fight early enough that the Death Eaters have yet to publicly declare war.
A muscle worked in Potter’s jaw. He held Draco’s face tighter. ‘Fine, let’s do it your way. Let’s barter. I answer one of your questions – any question you can think of – and you’ll answer one of mine. And you must give me the absolute truth.’ His eyes were sombre and unyielding.
The article had reduced Malfoy to a conniving seducer, Harry a humiliated trembling virgin. He had flatly refused to address the story whenever a reporter waylaid him at some official event. He would neither confirm nor deny it, because it was none of their fucking business what had gone on between Malfoy and him.
for Father’s death has not crossed my mind in the slightest. We also know that we both know we are soulmates—and I know how you feel about me. I can feel it, I can read it on your face—as well as I know you read
‘No thanks to
Theo thrashed, kicking Draco soundly in the stomach. It was too close to the epicentre of Draco’s torture. He screamed once more when he was thrown backwards. He landed on the floor, dragging the armchair down with him.
‘A complete and utter rubbish bachelor pad.’
Seamus shrugs. ‘There’s that. I reckon we’ll have to, if we want,’ he says flippantly, glancing at Dean. ‘It’s a bit hard on the omegas then, innit? If alphas don’t want them for mating, who will? I’ve heard that it’s a lot of trouble, dealing with their heat every month—sounds like some sort of illness.’
He was inconsolable, but he did not tell his mother or Blaise: Voldemort was rising at court, and three months after the ball, Father fell from his horse on a hunting trip, and died in the hunting lodge leagues away from the palace. Voldemort and his Death Eaters bore home his body wrapped in linen and stinking of rotting flesh and dead flowers.

“Yes, it isn’t fair,” Potter agreed, looking at Draco. “Especially since most of you have changed.”

“Well, that was fucking rude,” Draco said.

a nasty git. Goodnight, Potter. Thank you for dinner. I apologise for imposing.”
Harry stops in mid-air, looking down. She is the size of his thumb, but he doesn’t need to see her face to know that she is absolutely furious. He swallows, and turns his broom around. It is Minnie’s old broom really: an ancient Cleansweep Four that takes ten minutes to get ten metres off the ground and at a speed no faster than a running boy. He thinks of going as slowly as he can, but the longer Minnie has to stew, the worse his punishment will be.
The blond stiffens. ‘Don’t fucking do it just because I told you to!’ he snarls.
He can hear his screaming now, his throat burning with fire. His wings beat the air around him, the air smelling of feathers and metal. He is leaping forwards, the man now falling away from him, his face in a rictus of fear. Draco lands on his prey, and hooks his iron-grey claws into the man’s chest, and rips apart.
He hears them salute— "Your majesty!" —and the footsteps stomping after him. He smells the ire, like bitter herbs, on the omega's scent, but they do not speak, as they march through the ruined corridors, holes in the crumbling walls revealing the blurry purple moors surrounding the estate.
‘I won’t let anything happen to you,’ he says fiercely.
