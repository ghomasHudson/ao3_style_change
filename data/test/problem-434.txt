Their professor nodded gravely. “I met Lily as a child before Hogwarts. I was the one who explained the ‘weird’ things happening around her were magic. I told her she was special and shouldn’t listen to the cruel things her sister said.”
Draco. The one who kept his true self hidden to prevent his enemies from exploiting his vulnerabilities. The one with a fiercely protective streak and a wealth of compassion and gentleness secreted beneath his aristocratic veneer.
who wish you harm.” He allowed his meaning to sink in, smirking at Harry’s curt nod. “My family will also guarantee you protection, should you ever need it.”
“This information will elicit a craze in the castle tomorrow. Remember that Mr. Potter is one of us now and it is not just the duty of his immediate friends within Slytherin to protect him, but it is up to
All eyes turned to him as he settled at his new House’s table, but Harry remained outwardly unruffled as he filled his plate and buttered his toast. He was a Slytherin. He had an image to uphold, and with his friends supporting him, he would weather the storm.
Merlin, he was a prick. It was obvious to anyone who paid attention that Draco was suffering. His diminished appetite was evident as his clothes became looser throughout the year until they hung off his emaciated frame, and the bruising under his eyes seemed more akin to a matching set of black eyes, rather than lack of sleep. If he’d seen such signs on literally anyone else, Harry would’ve jumped in to save them, but because it was Malfoy, he left him to drown.
The Slytherins listened with rapt fascination as he described their world through Muggle-raised eyes. As the only life they’d ever known, it dawned on the purebloods how much they took for granted.
Glancing at the blond, he realized he’d never seen Draco Malfoy without his mask until today. He’d risked his life to reveal his true colours that night in the woods, but the trust in Draco’s decision to let Harry see him without it
She tossed him a wicked smirk. “You may blame it on my nature if you wish, but I think most would agree it is simply who I am.”
Draco attempted a reassuring smile, but it was more of a grimace, though Harry appreciated the effort. “It’s...not great, but if Uncle Sev has a plan, then it isn’t unsolvable. We’ll see what he has to say about it when we get to his room.”
When he regained the ability to speak a few moments later, Harry whispered, “I still have it. The button from the Cup.” Draco’s eyes shined brightly and his mouth curved into a small smile. “If anyone asked me at the time why I kept it, I couldn’t have given them an answer. But every time I picked it up, I saw your fear and heard the plea in your voice, and I...couldn’t throw it away. When I saw you on the far edge of the platform at the start of term, I realized I kept it because I was sure it’d be the only token of yours I’d ever have.”
“No,” he growled. “You don’t have to do this. I can help you. Dumbledore can help you and your parents. Just say the word.”
Rolling his tumbler between his palms, Draco gathered his scattered thoughts before explaining what he’d learned about the Gryffindors’ gaslighting. When he reached the part of the story detailing Harry’s panic attacks, he slammed back the rest of his whisky and forced the sordid details of the boy’s childhood abuse through clenched teeth.
A loud crash interrupted the well-oiled mechanics, and he twirled at the sound, wand at the ready, but lowered it instantly when he saw a small creature wearing mismatched socks and a clean pillowcase.
“I need you to ward the portrait. My spells would be counteracted immediately, I fear, and my students’ desire to have a conversation in private.” Severus emphasized the last word and shot a scathing glare to the man whose calculating gaze hadn’t left Harry since his arrival.
Arching a perfectly shaped eyebrow at him, she drawled, “Or would you rather marry me simply because our fathers wish it? What about the Greengrass girls? I heard a rumour they were candidates for the Malfoy heir, as well.”
Rejoining him on the bed, Draco cuddled him close and buried his nose in his hair, the sweet scent of Harry’s shampoo instantly easing his tense muscles. It amazed him that he could do this now. He’d revealed his feelings without Harry brandishing his wand and hexing him sideways. That alone was miraculous. Yet even more astounding than the discovery that his feelings were reciprocated was learning that the fearless boy was actually quite fragile and craving someone who wouldn’t judge him for cracking under pressure. And that he, for reasons he couldn't fathom, trusted Draco to be that person.
Inclining his head a fraction, Snape said, “I suggest you find a tutor to stay abreast of your studies. The tournament is not an excuse to slack off, Mr. Potter. However, the first task is in three weeks, and you will need time to master new spells in preparation. If you check the back of your timetable, I’m sure you’ll find the information illuminating,” he drawled before sweeping out of the hall.
“It’s always been you, Harry. Since we were eleven and hated each other, at twelve when I admired your bravery in the Chamber from afar, at thirteen when I realized what my true feelings were and ran like a coward in the other direction. Last year during the tournament, I was certain you aimed to kill me with your foolhardy stunts during the tasks. But Merlin, Harry, I didn’t think my heart could break more than it did when I heard about the damn apple. Don’t you know better than to eat untested food or drink?”
Barking a surprised laugh, Draco pulled him in for a hug while Snape and Pomfrey shared an amused glance. “Course not, you daft idiot,” he said fondly. Patting his back, he murmured, “Let’s finish this, so we can meet up with our friends.”
Harry met him on the landing and gallantly held open the door, and he refrained from kissing the handsome idiot through sheer willpower. Stepping into the impressive abode, Draco gawked at the portraits of prior Head professors and magical artefacts displayed among the books and rich decor.
“Oh, dear,” the former Headmaster muttered as the once-proud scion of House Malfoy crumpled to the floor and wept.
“Thank you,” he whispered. “I was sure last night I wouldn’t survive the damn thing. I’ve always had help with stuff like this.”
“Ever since we met that lovely boy, the one responsible for ending the war if you recall—” she added archly, forcing him to nod in concession “—they have been inseparable. I thought surely you would approve of his friendship with the Boy Who Lived.”
“On the nightstand, please,” Draco said, resolutely avoiding Theo and Blaise’s narrowed eyes. The elf nodded and laid a box of twenty-one vials on top of the table between their beds. Harry slumped against a bedpost at the sight of so many corked bottles, dejected and resigned to the cruel hand of Fate.
Pansy patted his arm encouragingly when they turned to the last girl. “And this is Miss Tracey Davis.”
Clearing his throat, Harry said, “I was happy about the age restriction because it meant I could have a normal year and enjoy the tournament from the sidelines. Besides, do you honestly believe I could get past the age-line if the Weasley twins couldn’t?”
“Come again?” Pansy quipped, earning a mutinous glare from both boys while the rest of them smothered their amusement in their tea.
“He won’t see this,” Draco interrupted. “I can control how much of the memory I show him and I promise, this will stay between us. It’s a very personal, private thing between soulmates and I won’t share it with anyone. You have my word,” he vowed.
But Draco...Oh, gods, Draco. Casting a quick silencing spell around himself, Harry sank behind a pile of rubble and sobbed. Only hours ago he’d renewed his promise to survive the battle and smother him in celebratory kisses, which Draco eagerly vowed to return. It had been the glimmer of hope spurring him to win throughout the fight, but it snuffed out like a candle when he stumbled out of the Pensieve.
Pomfrey pursed her lips but maintained her professionalism when she informed Harry that she would place him on a nutrition potion regimen. On top of three square meals a day, the potions would help him reach an average weight. His Head of House readily agreed, reminding Harry that the additional rigours of the tournament required him to be as healthy as possible.
His palms sweated slightly at the formality of their greetings. Was this a pureblood thing? Or one of those “old traditions” Snape mentioned? Was there a right way or a wrong way to answer? What would happen if he screwed up?
With difficulty, Harry shoved down the overwhelming emotions attempting to claw out of his chest and rasped. “I-I know I have no right to ask, but can you...can you promise not to leave? People have a habit of abandoning me. My parents, my godfather, the Weasleys, Hermione, even Dumbledore. I’m not strong enough to be alone, not after years spent —”
Ron grimaced while the rest collapsed on the ground in stitches, their dirty jokes barely discernible through their maniacal laughter. Turning to the adults watching in fond amusement, Ron sighed heavily. This was why they fought a war, he reminded himself. To rid the world of evil and let everyone have their happily ever after.
Studying the enigmatic man next to him, Draco realized there was so much about him he didn’t know despite their years of school, but he desperately wanted to. Snippets of the past six years danced across Draco’s mind: detentions, hallway duels, Quidditch matches, Tri-Wizard tournament tasks, the Inquisitorial Squad hunting down the DA. Harry had long been the center of his world. Whether rage or pride fueled Draco’s actions, he always gave as good as he got, refusing to back down from a challenge issued by emerald eyes. The reality of walking away, of not knowing how Harry was faring daily, left him decidedly off-kilter.
“It’s not just you,” Harry rushed to say, desperate to remove the insecurity casting shadows in his eyes. He was wholly unprepared for the return of Draco’s adoring gaze with his impulsive admission and blushed furiously.
Everyone, except Draco who couldn’t tear his awed eyes off Harry, shared a look. There were half-bloods and ambitious muggle-borns in their House, though admittedly, they didn’t interact with them much. Of course, that could be changed. Nodding in unison, they agreed to make more of an effort and break down the barriers keeping them separated.
Waving his wand around the room, additional seats appeared as he invited them to sit and eat. “I noticed some of you were absent at breakfast. I imagine you’re hungry. Don’t be shy, help yourselves.”
The elegance of her magic filled Draco with shame. He knew as well as anyone Granger was brilliant, but aside from watching her cast in class, he’d never paid attention to how deftly she wielded it. It further proved everything his parents taught him to believe was nothing but lies. Granger might be muggle born, but her magic was innate, just like his, and not in the least bit tainted.
Shrugging him off, she shook her head as tears trailed across her cheeks. Hermione rushed over and gently linked their elbows together, tossing a venomous glare to the twins who cowered under her wrath.
“I realized over the summer how important you are to me. That the years spent taunting you to gain your attention masked something else entirely,” Draco whispered. “At the World Cup, I didn’t spare a single thought for myself; I could only think what...they would do if they found you.”
Draco stretched his legs along the bed and crossed his ankles, shooting his bickering friends a smirk as he rubbed the excess lotion into his hands before leaning back on his elbows to allow it to sink in. His gaze shifted sideways and caught Harry nibbling his lip by the foot of his bed.
“Are you alright?” Draco murmured out of the corner of his mouth. Lowering his head to hide his smile at his constant attentiveness, Harry mumbled an affirmative and pointedly ignored Crabbe and Theo’s lighthearted snickers behind him.
Pride bubbled in Draco’s chest and he reined in the urge to hug the stupidly brave boy. Instead, he defaulted to what they did best and shot him a playful smirk.
Shaking his head violently, Draco doubled over and focused on choking down the bile scorching his esophagus. Scrambling off the desk with a gasp, Harry dashed to his side, hands hovering to offer help in case he became sick.
Tears streaked across the portrait’s cheeks, but Harry shoved off the desk and turned his back on him. Disappearing under his cloak, he fled the office, hands scrabbling for purchase along the smooth stone walls as his vision blurred on the stairs, but he refused to break down near Dumbledore again.
. That’s a hard line. I swear to Merlin if one of you tossers loses your temper with him, you’ll answer to me,” he growled. “Don’t loom over him or act threatening: no raised fists or hands that give the impression you’re about to strike him. Don’t touch him unexpectedly; he might punch you on reflex and spend the rest of his life apologizing for it. Don’t surprise him from behind for the same reason.”
Two days after attempting to revive her best friend, Hermione was still besieged with guilt. Ron waited on the other side of the curtain as she hesitantly pressed her lips to his and selfishly prayed he didn’t love her. When she emerged in tears, she couldn’t put words to her riotous emotions as she drenched Ron’s shirt.
He trembled uncontrollably and his breaths turned shallow as fear overrode his brain. Flicking his eyes around the curtained space, his heart rate spiked. It was too small, too tight, too close. He couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t breathe. Why couldn’t he breathe?
Nodding happily, Dobby popped out of existence, granting Harry peace to drink his tea and polish off the plate of biscuits undisturbed. Casting a quick
Draco nodded curtly in acknowledgment, though he still couldn’t meet Harry’s gaze. What if this was a figment of his imagination? A hallucination brought about by despair? He couldn’t bear to look up and find none of it was real.
“Why do you hate him? Harry, I mean,” Draco asked. “You hated him before you even met him. At least I had the decency to start a feud
The sorrow in Harry’s gaze gave way to astonishment before melting into searing want as he read the sincerity painted across his features.
Ron swallowed hard when she fisted her robes directly over her heart. “What if there is someone he loves and we don’t know about them?” she continued. “It could be a guy for all we know, which widens the pool by an
“I was never a boy,” Harry growled. “You made sure of that when you sent me to live with the Dursleys and tested my compliance at Hogwarts. You guaranteed it the night I forced poison down your throat — on your orders. You turned me into an unquestioning soldier and sent me off to war knowing I would never see Draco or my friends again. You’re no better than Tom, robbing me of the people I love and denying me the chance to tell them.” He chuckled bitterly. “Anything for the greater good, am I right?”
everything he gave him. Gripping him lightly by the hips, Draco shuffled him closer, swallowing his soulmate’s needy whimpers with pride. When Harry unconsciously rocked against his thigh, revealing his excitement however, Draco leapt back as though burned.
Closing her eyes in concentration, she snapped her fingers. Both wizards startled when they flew open a moment later, revealing pupils blown so wide they obscured all the colour in her enormous eyes.
The ghost smiled. “Of course, lad. Turn left at the top of the corridor.” Ducking through the wall opposite, the friar disappeared and Harry wasted no time following his directions.
of us. I care not for your personality clashes and petty squabbles. You can hash them out in your own time, in the privacy of our common room. But out there”—he waved his arm to indicate the castle at large—“we guard our own. Remember, travel in pairs or large groups;
The Headmaster immediately signalled for the meal to be served, allowing hushed conversations to fill the room as the students filled their plates. Flicking his eyes to the head table, Draco breathed easier at Severus’ subtle nod of approval.
“You aren’t the only one with house-elf connections, Potter,” he teased. Warmth bloomed behind Draco’s ribs with the return of Harry’s signature smile. After years of hoping for the blinding force of that crooked grin to be directed at him, finally earning it felt better than winning the Quidditch Cup.
Draco wasn’t about to tell him there were binding statements that would suffice, not when an opportunity for a physical sealing with his long-time crush was
“Dobby,” Harry called politely. Draco didn’t have time to question the name before his old house-elf appeared beside them.
Draco inclined his head politely. “I mean no disrespect, sir. Professor Snape announced a new House edict following Harry’s re-sorting last night: no Slytherin is to wander the halls alone. I’m merely here as an escort.”
“Yes, sir. Yesterday morning I noticed Harry was absent from breakfast, which was worrying considering the events at the feast Friday night.” McGonagall’s eyebrows rose sharply at the use of his first name, but she didn’t interrupt as Draco told her how he found him in the kitchens, leaving out the part about Teekey and the full nature of his conversation with Harry.
“But I was a clueless, impressionable kid who didn’t understand this world. My initial ideas about Slytherin were just as racist and elitist as blood supremacists, but I know better now. House affiliations are meaningless in reality. Believe me, arseholes don’t give a shit about something as petty as which dorm you slept in at school when they’re throwing curses at you.”
Shaking his head adamantly, Harry squeezed the hand still resting on his chest. “Don’t apologize. I get them, too. Are you feeling better?” Draco nodded as intense eyes searched him before Harry exhaled in relief and levitated a glass of water toward him. Raising the glass in thanks, Draco wet his dry mouth and sank into the supple leather.
His sharp features softened when he stroked Harry’s cheek. “Madam Malkins. I met a boy with wild hair and brilliant eyes and I was lost, but I didn’t realize what those traitorous feelings meant until fourth year.” He quirked a brow in silent question, and Harry chuckled.
Draco followed him as far as the entryway and propped on the doorjamb, narrowing his eyes warningly to anyone who passed Harry as he slipped into the bathroom. When he glanced toward the commons, it did not surprise him to find the lads and Pansy huddled at the mouth of the hall.
Draco wrinkled his nose distastefully. “Is this another Muggle idea?” Harry shrugged helplessly, and Draco scoffed. “Well, let’s get one thing straight—in a manner of speaking,” he joked, causing them to snort at the terrible pun. “We have magic, which means men and women in same-sex partnerships have multiple options for having biological children, so heirs for my line aren’t a concern. Other than that, what reason would my parents have to be upset over who I prefer to kiss?”
“Honestly, Ron, did you not see this coming?” He shook his head dumbly while they groaned at his obliviousness.
“This may be the one instance Granger was wrong then,” he joked. Chuckling at Harry’s bemused expression, he explained. “She was sure you hadn’t figured out how you felt and warned me you might need time to process. I recall her saying I shouldn’t be offended if you said ‘something asinine.’ ”
Narrowing her eyes at the intimidating figure wearing a red cloak in a dark wood, Teekey said, “Master demands you hold your tongue and stopper your ears. My Master will get what he wants and yours will not.”
“Shhh, don’t say it. Don’t even think it,” he interrupted, fingertips hovering over his lips. “I swear, Harry, I’m not going anywhere. Nor am I allowing you to go back to that horrific place. I don’t know how yet, but I vow on my magic, you’ll not go back there again.” Draco’s rain-scented aura rippled across his skin, sealing his promise and Harry shivered, struck by the vehemence of the oath and the intimacy of his magic ghosting over him.
Severus paused outside the curtains when he noted the abnormal silence and cautiously peeked around the barrier in case they had a privacy spell in place. What he found broke his heart. Draco was curled protectively around the other boy, his aristocratic mask absent in the face of fear and uncertainty, while he consoled a trembling Harry.
Taking Harry’s hand, they shouted their goodbyes and headed into the gardens. They shrieked when they stumbled into a gathering of Lucius’ famed albino peacocks, racing to escape the disgruntled peafowl trying to peck them. When they reached the pond, Harry bent over his knees, while Draco sprawled on his back and flung an arm across his eyes.
The offer was a balm for his soul. Draco hadn’t realized how much he wished Harry would come to his rescue until the possibility stretched before him. It seemed ludicrous to expect the Chosen One to give a damn about him, much less return his deeply buried affections. It was a childish dream that crossed his mind only in the safety of his subconscious, kept under lock and key behind impenetrable Occlumency shields. Yet, it didn’t seem quite so impossible as he drank the earnestness in the stubborn Gryffindor's gaze like a man dying of thirst.
“Headmaster,” Severus said when she swept out of the room. “If you don’t mind, I’d like to get my newest charge officially settled before classes resume tomorrow.”
Theo’s blue eyes sparkled with triumph, and Draco clapped him on the shoulder. Turning to Harry, Draco furrowed his brow. “Is this what you want? A re-sort? Another chance to be a Slytherin?”
A humourless laugh escaped him as he sat up and raked his hands through his chin-length hair. “My apologies,” he said, addressing the far wall instead of his students. “I live with constant regret, though I fear some guilt is eternal.”
Smacking his lips in appreciation after a long swig, Harry quipped, “I never thought I’d be the type to enjoy fancy water.”
Draco rolled his eyes at the good-natured ribbing. “I’m also younger and not a professional athlete, but that’s beside the point. You have your...interests and I have mine.”
“Enough, Moody.” Dumbledore ran a hand down his beard in contemplation. “Can I trust you, Mr. Malfoy, to keep what you hear and see to yourself?”
Appraising him coolly, she whispered, “May I remind you the curse is bound to whomever Harry loves, not the other way around, which means the person kissing him doesn’t have to be in love with him.”
Forcing down the bile rising in his throat, Ron murmured, “You could be right. It might be someone we’d never expect or worse, he’s not in love with anyone, at all. But have you considered those closest to him?”
Pulling his Galleon from his pocket, he sucked in a few ragged breaths so the enchantment could understand him before whispering his final promise. A promise he wanted to say in person, and now never would. But he wasn’t about to leave it unsaid, either.
The sound of his voice was all it took to snap Harry out of his stupor and send him running. Uncaring of the tears streaking through the dirt and blood on his face or the wands directed at the blond in the doorway, he launched himself in Draco’s arms with a cry of joy.
“Well, let’s be careful what we say around the paintings, shall we?” Pansy said, trying for chipper and Harry admired her attempt to lighten the dismal mood.
Not only did Draco look at him like he mattered, but he took care of him. It wasn’t something he was used to after years of conditioning to be independent and then three years amongst Gryffindors who never quite understood his oddities or how to handle them. But it was definitely something he appreciated, though he lacked the words to express it.
“Definitely,” Harry replied with a smile—reassurance and a promise in one. His stomach flipped at the naked relief on Draco’s face before he took a seat with Blaise a table over.
“I will escort you to the common room. I think we’ve done quite enough for one day. Once I’ve sorted the details regarding our next steps, then we will meet to explain what we discovered today. For now, I ask that you not tell any of your friends what we learned,” Severus said firmly, relaxing when they murmured their understanding.
“Of course, Professor. Thank you for everything and for supporting me on this,” Harry said thickly, squeezing her fingers to convey all the things he couldn’t say. She patted the back of his hand with a sad smile before releasing him.
“Can’t you feel it? Like lightning beneath your skin every time you look at me? Because I do, Draco, but I didn’t understand what it meant until it was just you and me.”
are true Slytherins and right now the safety of one of our own is at stake. We must close ranks. Do I make myself clear?”
Severus listened with growing horror, wondering in a foggy part of his brain if he’d been confounded, because he certainly wasn’t hearing correctly.
“I sometimes forget he was also your house-elf,” Harry snickered as he doctored his drink. “I always see your father’s face when I freed him and forget he lived at the Manor with you.”
revealed a cloak. Barking a laugh with a shake of his head, Draco teased, “That explains so fucking much, Potter.”
The students listened in awe as the man widely believed to be cold and callous emerged in a new light. Harry studied the professor closely, recalling what Draco said about Snape helping discover who put him in the line of fire. It made sense that like the younger Slytherins, there might be more to him underneath his public persona, and he supposed Snape couldn’t be all bad if he had Draco’s respect as a surrogate father.
“No,” Pansy said with deadly calm. “Harry’s mine now. I’m sorry Draco, you’ll have to fight me for him because no one is laying a goddamn finger on him ever again or I will raze this entire castle to cinder blocks.”
“Mmm, you did, darling. Though I’m inclined to forgive you since Harry is such a dear,” Pansy replied from her lounged position against Goyle’s broad chest.
“Oh, nicely done, Blaise! That shape enhances your face and makes your eyes more visible,” Theo said, tilting his head and checking the angles.
Tapping a coin with his wand, he brought it to his lips and whispered a short phrase. She grinned when “Mione, you’re the best” circled the edge of the second Galleon. Repeating the process on the other coin, her reply of “Thank you, I concur” garnered a round of chuckles from the trio when it flashed on the first coin. Pressing the enchanted coins in his hands, she squeezed his arm and shooed him toward Dumbledore’s office.
“He’s a possibility. We can’t rule him out, but we can’t focus solely on him, either,” Draco stated firmly. “If we do, we might miss something and I’m not taking chances.”
His stomach twisted to learn she needed such safeguards while at school, but he felt positively nauseous when he realized that now he did, too. Looking uncertainly to Draco, his friend raised an aristocratic brow and pointedly fiddled with a button on his cuff. The message was clear: the gift wasn’t any different from an emergency portkey and there wasn’t a good reason, beyond pride, to refuse it.
“It doesn’t matter,” he whispered, tears streaking across his gaunt features. “He’s going to kill me and my parents for failing my task. It’s intentionally impossible. He means for me to die, to punish my father before he destroys us; to show his followers what he will do to any who disappoint him.”
“I don’t see the Boy Who Lived,” Draco continued quietly. “I see a guy who loves treacle tart but skips steps in potions because he can’t sit still long enough to read the instructions. A guy who would do anything for his friends, but lives to fly on his broom and leave his problems on the ground. A guy I’ve had to keep at arm’s length, though I want nothing more than to close the distance because it is the only way I know to keep him safe.”
An idea struck Draco as he held the boy with too many burdens and he impulsively murmured an incantation from his childhood. A blissful sense of peace that was so rare in his life filled Harry’s heart as pleasant dreams of gentle song and aromatic hearth fire cocooned his mind. Burrowing into the comforting warmth surrounding him, Harry smiled as the enchanting melody quieted his churning subconscious and pulled him deeper into sleep’s inviting arms.
“Right, that’s enough,” Draco declared, crossing his arms over his chest with a scowl. “I’m certain Harry appreciates your support, but it’s been a rather long day, so kindly let the man breathe. Thank you.”
Sucking in a furious breath through his teeth, Harry shook his head and tucked Draco’s face into the crook of his neck. The implication was clear without saying the words aloud. Lucius meant for him to take the Mark.
The seven of them regrouped in the common room ten minutes before dinner. By wordless agreement, they struck up a safe conversation about quidditch while Pansy checked the new password on the board. Greg frowned at the sheen in her dark eyes when she rejoined the group but didn’t ask when he extended his elbow and they fell into step with the others.
Leaning over, he put his hand under Potters chin and lifted his face up to his. Potter was surprisingly warm on his hand. Draco studied his wide green eyes that were staring at him in shock for a second and then smiled and leaned in closer. Potter held his breath as Draco whispered "I will see you at four right here." Then released his chin and sauntered off, leaving Potter in a furious confused daze.
"So I suppose I'm in debt to your friend for saving mine? Lovely. Well honestly, good riddance. If Blaise gets himself in trouble, I can't be the only one who saves his neck." Draco reasoned to Potter, not exactly realizing that he sort if complimented the Granger girl. But if Blaise found something to like in her then so be it.
Blaise grinned down at Hermione, not being one to ever miss his chance. "Hey you gorgeous, kind , wonderful woman you, would you do me the honor of being my date to the Samhain ball?" Hermione bit her lip and smiled, nodding yes as she kissed him. Blaise grinned at the rest of the group "I don't know about you suckers, but I got the most beautiful woman in the world as my date." As he got up with Hermione in his lap and literally carried her out of the room. She laughed and lightly smacked his chest, trying to get him to put her down. But Blaise, ever the winner, ran off with his most precious prize.
"He's out and about, wandering." He let on, trying to stay as vague as possible. He saw McGonagall enter the hall and was rather embarrassed to discover he was excited, this meant Harry was back. Glancing around, he couldn't find him. But McGonagall was sitting down and eating with the teachers now.
Eventually, he got fed up. So Draco looked up with a raised eyebrow and made the best mistake of his life. He got on Potter's nerves.
"We mostly just walked around Hogsmead and talked really. Potter's quite a bore. Honestly the most exciting thing we did was visit the Weasely twins Joke Shop. Even that was a downer." Harry looked at Malfoy and rolled his eyes, making it clear that Malfoy was exaggerating or leaving something out. Hermione would have to inquire about that later. But for now, she was just happy to see the two of them getting along.
Ron lasted a couple seconds longer before he started roaring, his laughter hearty and full. He held on to the bedpost for dear life as he hunched over, clutching his own stomach.
Harry wandered around until he found himself at the top of the astronomy tower where Blaise and Hermione were. Hermione looked up with a smile that faded fast when she saw Harry's dazed expression. She quickly got up and crossed over the tower to where he was and assessed him with a studious eye.
McGonagall stood up immediately and scanned the hall rather quickly before moving around the professors table and striding towards the doors.
"Good on you Draco." Harry muttered, stumbling over the words. He didn't know if there was even a proper way to respond to that.
"I just borrowed it. You can wait your turn." He said, stowing it deeper away into his robes. Draco shook his head adamantly,
Fat Lady. "VIGILANCE!" He snapped, passing into the common room, completely ignoring the dirty look the Fat Lady gave him.
Climbing the steps of the astronomy tower, 2 at a time, Draco imagined how it would happen, telling Potter how he felt.
But now, the freedom was exhilarating. Draco could choose his future with this boy with little fear of repercussion from his parents or the Dark Lord.
"You wanted me to.. I was supposed to.. I don't quite remember to be honest." Harry's face was full of confusion and his eyes glazed over a little.
It was covered in blood. There was someone underneath his blankets though, peeling back the covers, Harry found Draco Malfoy, or at least what was left of him. All over his bed.
The nights events came rushing back to him and Harry turned over to bury his face in the pillow groaning "Oh god.." There was a deep chuckle coming from the side of him and he looked up to see Malfoy watching him. He was sitting against the wall and his hair for once, wasn't perfect. It was mussed and he looked sexy as hell. Harry frowned at the unwelcome thought and follwed Draco's head down to the rest of his body and realized what the pillow he had been using really was. Malfoy's lap.
Harry paused mid-breath. He didn't actually have a plausible excuse for that one, so he did the opposite of what Malfoy expected, he leaned closer so their noses were barely touching and whispered "Maybe I just enjoy being on top of you. Ever think about that one? And please, I'm straddling you, I think we are friends.  Call me Harry."
"Fred and George's new product. Its called the 'Pocket Shop' basically like a shopping bag except its invisible, weightless, and the products you put in are immediately payed for. It follows you when you come in and doesn't leave the store. The best part is the only person who can put products in is the person who has money to pay for it. Childsafe. It also sends your products to your room when your done and the bag simply.. Disappears. I don't know how they do it." Potter explained, watching Dracos expression with amusement.
"I want you." That was all that came out of Draco's mouth. The relief in Harry's bright green eyes was overwhelming as Draco took his hand.
Eventually, Hermione came up and asked what the fuss was about and they calmed down enough to tell her. She snickered, gave Harry and apologetic smile and walked back out. Her light laughter reaching them as she went down the stairs.
"I'm going to go find Malfoy. You two behave." He demanded sternly. They nodded and watched him leave. One worrying for her friend and one worrying for all of them.
After the session, Ron left with clear instructions to come back the following week, same time. He didn't feel much different but it was nice to get his thoughts and feelings out. Meznoa had instructed him to remind himself periodically that it was not his fault whenever he started hearing the voices from his dreams. It sounded easy enough he supposed.
"Same goes to you. Night!"  shaking his head up at the ceiling, Harry gave the painting the password "Pumpernickel" and walked into the common room to go to bed. Exhausted and wide awake at the same time, it was awhile before Harry's thoughts drifted off to sleep with his mind. His last one being
Once again, before Hermione and Blaise could do anything, she raised her wand and performed a spell on their friend.
When the meal was over, Harry and Draco stood up at the same time and said their byes. They walked away, both trying to NOT watch the other person yet somehow, ending up staring at eachother as they walked, resulting in a clumsy Harry crashing into another person. Draco let out a bark of laughter as Harry went down once again. That poor guy really needed to watch where he was going.
"Let's go!" Yet Potter resisted so Drack snatched his hand and yanked him to his feet and dragged him out the door. Completely ignoring the scene he was making and trying to ignore the burning sensation he felt on his face. When they were out of the Three Broomsticks, Draco kept walking forward, where to he didn't know. He just had to get away.
He had forgotten that he grabbed Potter's hand because he was so caught up in his own annoyance. When the bastard reminded him that they were still holding hands, Draco did his best to act disgusted, but the sad truth was.. He didn't actually mind. The thought made him stop cold and he whipped around to tell Potter to bug off. Now.. They were on the ground.
"It's a big secret though so... shhhhh" Draco slurred, pushing his index finger roughly against Harry's lips. Harry smiled lightly at his efforts. As pathetically drunk as Draco was, he was still adorable.
He couldn't open his mouth to say anything, he was too embarrassed that they got caught that all he could do was stare mutely in horror. He couldn't quite catch what McGonagall said over the ringing in his ears. But considering Malfoy was nodding lightly, he assumed Draco caught some of it.
"And miss a surely wonderful day with the famous Harry Potter? Never! But I mean, you must have some brilliant stories to share considering how famous and talented you and your friends are! I look forward to our.. Date" Draco said, smirking at Harry 's flushed face.
Harry looked over his choice of breakfast options and frowned, none of them looked super appealing. In fact, he wasn't even hungry anymore. All he wanted to do was look at Draco and think about Draco. He almost couldn't take his eyes off of him. Draco just took over his every thought and it was so extremely difficult to concentrate. Much less eat.
Draco had been shocked of course and thoroughly considering whether or not he should shove Potter off him, in case he woke up soon and found that Draco had let him stay. While entertaining the thought, he slowly turned his thoughts to Harry's hair. The wild, curly black mess. His hand was still in it.
"Excuse me?!" Harry asked, rather shocked. He could feel his eyebrows creeping up towards his hairline.
He grabbed the book he needed and walked as fast as he could, barreling out of the section and directly into no other than Draco Malfoy. They stood up immediately and Draco looked back and forth between the aisle and the book that Harry was clearly trying to hide.
Harry was trying really really hard not to laugh. He heard Draco's shout which was funny enough but the fact that Malfoy was so mad that he actually touched Harry? Hilarious! Not to mention he was still holding his hand.
Draco sighs, mentally shaking his head. "There once was a kindly old wizard who used his magic generously and wisely for the benefit of his neighbors..."
"I come here all the time, it's where I spend my friday nights and Wednesday mornings. I love the atmosphere here. There aren't any nargles and I can do any work I have in peace. Not to mention all the people are super friendly!" She paused and smiled at him.
Harry wondered how Mione managed to drag Blaise into this. How did she get HIM to join S.P.E.W? Shaking off the thought, he waved at them before being immediately bombarded by food. The elves practically threw it at him. He felt a little bad taking advantage of them. Or maybe it was just because Hermione was there. Either way, whats a guy to do.
" Merlin's beard! Malfoy let me go! " Harry yelled his annoyance, he needed to leave, to get away from him. Malfoy however, swemed to just want to fight.
Seamus cracked first. Laughing so hard, spit was flying as he lost his balance and promptly fell on the bed at Harry's feet, pounding the bed beside him.
Ron didn't say much of anything about the subject. Or anything at all really. He never really spoke at breakfast or dinner because he was too busy stuffing his face with food which was honestly fine with everyone else.
"I don't know, we could see where this goes? I'm not sure if you want to make this into a relationship. Or if that's a good idea as of now. But we can work on it. What do you want?" Harry questioned.
"I'm sorry if he wasn't supposed to tell me headmistress, I just wanted to know where he was going and he said that it was a secret and he'd tell me when he got back. He kind of looked funny but I figured it was ner-"
Harry gaped at them in silent horror as they continued their laughter, faces turned red from exertion. He said that? He didn't even really like Draco! They were barely friends! Harry told them that as they sobered up, panting hard, Seamus paused mid mouth wipe and they started laughing again, quite obviously not believing a word of it.
"Fuck you Malfoy!" He barks, tossing something at him. It's 'The Tales of Beedle, The Bard'. Malfoy stares at Potter wide-eyed, confusion washing over him.
Harry paused his screaming as he realized who's hand it was. Draco. He stared in horror at the malicious look in the devil cat's eyes amd turned and ran as fast as he could to the dormitory.
"Well! Our school has been chosen to host a ball. Not Yule this time, but Samhain. The schools Beuxbaton, Llivermony, and Durmstrang will all be joining us. Please remember that this is the biggest ball Hogwarts has had the joy of hosting and we expect you to be on your best behavior. Classes are hereby cancelled until the Monday after Halloween." Cheers sounded throughout the hall drowning out Hermione's groan.
"I'd love to Ron, that'd be wonderful." Ron then turned to Harry with a questioning look. " Oi, Harry, who are you going to ask? " Harry pondered that for a moment "Well, I was thinking about askin-" At the same time Ginny said
Draco was holding his sworn enemies hand. Harry Potter. The Chosen One. The Gryffindor Saviour. Harry Potter. Harry Potter. How in the world did this happen? Draco was admittedly thrilled, he was to put it shortly, super gay. In both ways. He wanted to shout Harry's name from the roof tops. But then he started thinking. Actual thoughts.
Malfoy looked up in confusion, not having heard about their weekend fiasco. Harry met his eye and smiled
"I know Ron, I quite like you too." The words echoed in Ron's head. He wasn't sure he got his point across but at the same time. He knew he did. Luna always understood him, what he said, what he meant and what he was trying to say. Even if he didn't know anything else, he still knew that much.
"Fine then, I reckon I'll see you at 4 to go to Hogsmead? Since I am obviously in love with you." Harry invited testily, completely ignoring the swift kick Hermione sent him under the table. Draco smirked, just knowing that Potter was bluffing and would eventually wimp out. He'll play this game and win.
"I know, and that's ok. Everyone gets scared sometimes Draco. If you want to take it slow we can do that. Hell, we don't have to date at all. We can forget this happened if you want. " Draco heard Harry, sort of. He knew what he was saying. But Draco was thinking more about holding Harry's hand. That was what he wanted.
Draco sighed and walked over to his bed, taking his shirt off as he went. Blaise was still out, probably shagging Granger in a closet somewhere. Maybe not. He was never sure when it came to those two. Blaise was kinder around her, better. But right now, he just wanted to talk to his friend.
But he would always be there for his friends. No matter who they chose. No matter what obstacles were in the way. And they will always be there for him too. Or they would. If Ron actually told them anything.
Apparently not. Minerva couldn't stop herself from smiling quite widely. She had, after all, just won 10 galleons. Horace was smiling too, despite the fact that he had just lost money. He had some sort of obsession with 'young love'.
Harry was pushed up against the wall. And if he was going to be honest, he liked it. Alot. He and Draco had gotten in a playful nudging match which turned into light pushing, only ending when Draco shoved him against a wall and held him there. Harry had gasped from suprise and then just held Draco's gaze with a smirk, wondering who would break the stare first.
Mrs. Weasley however, is a perfect motherly figure and Harry was more than happy to stay with them. She'd made it very clear that he was forever welcome in her home. Although being smothered in love and affection, while nice for a change, sometimes got a little weird.
Instead, Draco pulled back the covers on his bed, flicked his wand to close the drapes, and curled up in a ball under the blankets. Slowly drifting off into a troubled sleep filled with Harry Potter.
"Daddy and I have been restoring our house after his horn exploded. Other then that, I've been going out and just trying to move forward. I'm sure you understand, that's why you're here isn't it? You're trying to make things better?" Her soft voice held the weight of the worlds in it. Ron didn't have a vocal response so he nodded. Luna smiled sweetly at him and stopped in front of a building.
Ron was just watching the two in horror, his mouth wide open, Chicken leg halfway there yet hanging limply, completely forgotten due to the scene unfolding before them: not quite able to believe this was happening.   Hermione just rolled her eyes, smiled and leaned into Blaise's arms, the two talking quietly to each other.
"Right. sorry I must have confused Saint Potter with someone else, your twin perhaps? I forgot you were one half of the Weasley twin set. Let me know when we are done acting like toddlers." He called over his shoulder, walking back into the common room leaving a furious and confused Harry at the door.
Ginny went back to reading her book, when he didn't say anything immediately.. Or declare he was still in love with her. She was trying not to be too obvious about the fact she kept looking at him every 10 seconds. She really didn't know why she'd broken it off with him. She was miserable without him and his unintentional charm. She carefully lifted her hand and tapped Harry's leg twice to get his attention. When he turned she felt her cheeks go mildly red but she had something to say and Merlin knows she was going to say it!!
"What the fuck do you think you are doing, Potter?" Draco growled, trying very hard to appear menacing but failing given where they were.
"Earlier, you said that you were Bi, that you understood what was going on. And I've been realizing this for awhile now but I think I wanted to say it out loud, to you. Sober, preferably. I am gay. And I really like you." Draco paused to catch his breath, the words coming out rushed at the end. He stared at Harry, trying to get a read on his thoughts.
"What I want.. What I want is you. It's been you for awhile. I want to see where this is going to take us. We don't need to make anything official right now though, that's fine. But definitely realize I'm going to stake a claim on you." He spoke softly, a smile, a real smile, stretching across his face.
"Potter, I don't believe I ever asked a question." Draco rasped. He wasn't sure where the air in his lungs went but. It definitely made it harder to talk.
They had simply been walking down the halls when Horace claimed to hear a pair of footsteps and suggested they took a detour and  see which pair of lovebirds was roaming around this time. Minnie had agreed because, well, why not. Just another thing to gossip with the other teachers about.
Smiled. Ron was smiling again. Often too! Alot of that was thanks to Luna. She had helped him out of the darkest place in his life. He was happy again. He could feel again.
Shrugging, Draco got up and headed down to the Great Hall for breakfast. He found Blaise at the Gryffindor table, unsurprisingly he had Hermione in his arms. He sat down across from his friend and started dishing up. Looking around the hall, he saw alot more house unity. The sectioned tables were more ignored and people seemed to be starting to sit with whomever they wanted. They had started that. Actually, Blaise and Hermione had started that. It never failed to awe him how far they've come in such a short time.
Lightly shrugging his shoulders, Harry stood up and exited. Banishing the confusion from his mind, there were more important tasks at hand He needed to go find Draco so they could practice for the ball.
"You're a little bit of a klutz Potter. You ok?" Behind Draco's nonchalant smile, worry had caused furrowed a little, betraying his entire "I dont care" attitude.
Luna whipped around and nodded. The dreamy smile she was so well known for spread across her face. She looped her arm through his and led him the opposite way she'd been heading.
If you asked Draco, it was a mess. They stepped on each others toes so often it was a wonder neither had broken any yet. A small miracle that both of them are guys and therefore would NOT beimg wearing heels. Not to mention, Potter had NO rhythm. He kept going on a completely different beat and speeding up and slowing down randomly. It was safe to say they were doomed.
"Witches and Wizards seeking counseling post-war, visit the new wing~ Level 6, The Emotional Trauma Ward."
Both of the boys looked extremely embarrased and were trying to figure out if they were in trouble or just recieving a warning. Their eyes darted simultaneously between her, Horace, and eachother. Minnie just rolled her eyes and lightly shook her head. She knew Horace looked entirely too happy. Sighing, she turned and walked the other way, she knew Horace would quickly follow.
Harrys brow was furrowed. He looked confused. Draco wasn't sure if this was good or bad so he rushed on.
When Harry opened his eyes from the best sleep he'd known, he panicked. Where in the bloody hell was he? The room was covered in emerald green and silver. If he didn't know better it was the Slytherin common room.. Which means...
Ron was to say the least, confused. It appeared they were dating now? He had figured that something was up, Harry had never been so carefree, happy, and.. loud acting? He wasn't sure what the word for it was. But his actions were loud.
Draco walked slowly over to where Potter was waiting. The boy was tapping his foot impatiently, leaning up against a wall with his arms crossed. When he spotted Draco, he walked over and grabbed his arm.
He could hear a very faint "Fuck You World!!" Before there was another gruesome splat. They had landed right next to eachother. In fact, it appeared as though they were looking at eachother, even in death their hands were reaching towards eachother. How poetic. What Shakespearean bullshit.
Harry didn't think it'd be possible to blush more but, apparently he was wrong. Malfoy would be Malfoy.
"Why last night before we went to bed. He said he was going to be late to breakfast because of the errand."
Harry and Draco entered the RoR to find a beautiful ballroom with stained glass windows, a wide, arcing ceiling, and plenty of smooth floor to practice. Taking a step forward, he immediately tripped and fell over two pairs of dancing shoes that had appeared at his feet.
Draco labelled this thought as "stupid" and immediately proceeded to shove it out of his mind. Just because Harry admitted he was bi, didn't mean Potter was bi for him.
Fuming, he stomped out of the library and back to the common room. However, as soon as he enters, he feels overwhelmed. The room is stifling, theres too many people in here. He quickly darts up the stair to his room and throws himself on the bed. He trys to block out any unbidden thoughts as he stared at the ceiling. Waiting for sleep to come. For the nightmares to come.
Shaking his head slowly, Ron exited the wards and apparated away. He landed somewhere London. He would have gone to Muggle London but they wouldn't be able to help him there. Rolling his eyes, he realized an easier approach. He apparated again to St. Mungos. Pushing his way inside, he made towards the front desk. The tired looking witch smiled at him encouragingly.
She didn't want to hurt him. She didn't wish him ill. She just wanted him back. And that wasn't going to happen anytime soon.
After the war, after the seemingly endless procession of funerals, Ron realized something important. He needed help.
"Not everything is about you and my life does not revolve around you and your wants and needs. Leave me be. consider this your warning." He said, turning on his heel and storming away, leaving behind a dumbfounded Draco with his arm still stretched out, reaching for Harry.
Despite what her students may think, she greatly adores her students and her house. She'd go to great lengths to help any of them and having to do this to one of her favorite students hurts her. More than they'd know.
"I admire that, Ron. Alot of people don't have the courage or strength to try to do that, not this early anyways."
He walked down the rest of the stairs and yawned loudly to alert Hermione that he was awake so she wouldn't be scared to death when he came up behind her. She shot up, not paying attention to Blaise who toppled onto the ground groaning, and gave him a strange look.
Draco was hysterical. He just couldn't stop laughing. From the moment Harry had woken he'd been holding in a snigger. The poor boy was so nervous and embarrassed Draco didn't even have to explain why he had been watching Harry sleep, or why he didn't shove Harry off when he woke up. (Again). The only thing he did do was remove his hand from Potters hair and unclasped their hands. Potter had woken up about three moments later and it was hilarious.
"I uh. Well. I fell. Not really sure how. Just kinda fell backwards. Thanks for helping me up." Harry explained hurriedly, his face burning.
The only real reason, that Harry found was that he honestly thinks Malfoy was bluffing. There was no way Malfoy sincerely wanted to spend time with Harry. He quite obviously only agreed to shock Harry and scare him off. But little did Malfoy know it took alot more than that to scare him off. That thing that Malfoy did, with his chin, was also just a move to make Harry uncomfortable. He probably copied it off Blaise, seeing as Blaise did that to Hermione just this morning. He really needed to talk to Hermione. But she was off doing god knows what with Blaise.
Minerva McGonagall considered herself a pretty knowledgeable person when it came to the doings of her students. She knew of the Marauders map that Harry used, in fact, when his father was in her class, it was she who suggested spells under her breath that might make it work better. She was indeed a true Gryffindor and she enjoyed watching her little lions flourish as they grew and become more and more daring.
Draco suppressed a smile at the sounds of annoyance in the mans voice. It sounded vaguely familiar too.
The sun somehow already ducked behind the tree tops as they walked the long road home. Draco wondered where all the time had gone in the day, it had go be at least 7 if not later. But it didn't feel like they spent three hours at Hogsmead, it was quite ridiculous. But it did remind him of a muggle saying he had heard once. "Time flys when you're having fun."
I saw what he had on and knew it was the cause of the scene. After They all greeted us. Aiden started making breakfast which was absolutely amazing to everyone.
'' You will have quite a lot to say, Mister Potter. If you don't comply, I will be forced to resort to Legilimency and then all of your secrets will be spilled without preamble or your consistent stuttering. ''
"I think Harry," he paused this was going to sound so weird, "I think Harry was raped," Draco gasped for breath.
I was surprised when someone came up behind me and started kissing my neck, but quickly turned to see Draco. I started to kiss him while Severus went to my neck. From the both of them I was in a lot of pleasure. I gasped sharply when Severus bit down on my neck and knew that it was to leave a mark on me which I didn't mind, but I knew there was a lot more to come.
"POMFREY!!" Draco was shouting at the top of his lungs but no matter how much he screamed there came no response from the office.
They began to walk out when Pomfrey stopped them saying, "Could we schedule an appointment every week on Sunday around 1:00? Maybe for the next month or two?" She asked.
He then entered Harry's room an abundance of toys surrounded him a toddler bed and yet again a colour slider Harry would have fun with that.
I've been waiting for a long time for our submissive to come into his or her inheritance. It doesn't matter if our mate is male or female. I will love them any way.
Since the dose was small Harry shrunk slowly, at first Draco didn't notice it just teased him for being 'shorter' suddenly he had a reversed growth spurt he was now a tiny three year old Harry Potter....
"Okay, okay, let's read a story get up on my back your gonna have a piggyback ride!" Draco helped Harry get up and than he told Harry stories all the way to the dorms...
This is not my chapter I only changed it a bit and added a few things. This belongs to the original author @ A_M_BOOK
"No! We are gonna do something that's more fun than that party! We are going to Hogsmead," Draco stated.
"No Draco, I think that you will do just fine with what you are provided and all of your fellow Slytherins will help you," Dumbledore shoved off the complaint,
When Draco woke up later that morning he was startled to find Harry gone! Where was he but it didn't take long for him to find Harry playing with a Barbie which he ever so carefully placed in a small truck.
Draco's voice seemed to trail on until Harry shouted, "yes! I know the de-aging one to, let's do that one,"
"Nothing, let's get this shirt on you...." Draco slid it on to him and Harry fit it to size. Well as well as he could.
She stood up and checked her appearance combing back some of her crazy fuzzy hair, and smiled in the mirror. This is what she wanted all along!
The child had a strange way to speak and pronounce things, but to Draco it was very cute how Harry used w's instead of r's.
I'll do it!'' Draco seemed to override Dumbledore's voice. He knew that Dumbledore would allow it he was such a foolish man!
"My mother, she won't reply to me after the war..." Pansy looked up, "its fine I never liked her anyways!"
'' Is that so? I think I have every right to know, as a teacher so concerned with your well being'' He had made the word ' concerned ' sound like a curse and Harry winced at the tone he used, he couldn't help himself.
"Hawwy want dem to be Dwacos friend!" Harry smiled rushing down the stairs he climbs on in occupied chair in the common room clearing his throat he said, "wisten! Wisten! I Hawwy, and i wuv Dwaco! I wawnt you guwys to wuv him to!" He smiled looking like he convinced the crowd, unfortunately not all took favour to the small child espisially the eighth years, "Oh go get a life Draco don't force your baby to take car of you!" Blaise yelled.
The letter ripped and turned it self into ashes and I relaxed into Tom's arms. "Well" I said "it wasn't so bad" I finished. My mates started laughing till they had tears in their eyes. Once they were done I talked to them again. "Don't we have something to do?" I asked them and Draco answered "house hunting" he exclaimed. I liked Draco. He is energetic and entertaining. He just made me happy with his personality and style. We got out of the bed and went to go take our showers and get ready for the day. Draco had on a silver suit that made his eyes gray eyes stand out.
Everyone knew what Harry's life was like with the Dursley family, it came out after the war that his family used to abuse him and used him like a house elf, so there was no way that Draco would allow him to go back to that family. Then he would rather do it himself!
When I landed in Gringotts, I stumbled a little before catching myself on one of the chairs in the room.
I had pale skin and red lips with long eyelashes and black eyebrows, but what shocked me the most was the wings that were the same blue as my eyes with black lineing.
Draco shut his eyes and rolled back his sleeves, where what seemed to be a million cuts were showing on his wrist.
Aiden took our hands and pulled us to the door and opened it. I heard foot steps rushing towards us and I pulled Aiden into my arms to protect him.
Neville was off his rocker he just saw his girlfriend, wait was she even his girlfriend anymore? Kiss a traitor.
The next owl was from Mrs. Weasley and Ginny, they had sent me a lot of home cooked food but all of a sudden I sniffed the air and smelt an oder coming from the food which smelled like bad potions and didn't eat them .
He first saw a flat screen TV which he knew muggles used to watch their shows and movies on and a long comfy green couch with a soft red carpet which didn't clash at all surprisingly, making his way to the kitchen he saw a list of things he would never learn how to use and instead he would just use magic he made his way to his bedroom which already had all his clothes there folded neatly it was a green room to represent Slytherin but noticed a slider which could change the colour of his room to whatever he wanted, he changed it to a soft grey colour which reminded him of his room at Malfoy Manor.
"I don't want you to either," muttered Draco as they exited the office, Draco just giving up, the eighth years were bad enough, insulting him mostly for not killing famous Potter and the first to seventh years just thought of him as the traitor Malfoy, of course he wasn't! He was the great Draco Malfoy! But all that would be gone now that he was bringing Po- Harry into the dorms.
"Yes, boo boo," Draco smiled as Harry expertly put on his shirt and pants still to big but better fit for him.
"Look what I have here guys!" She put on a baby voice, "whittle Harry Potter!!!!!" The entire common room cackled and started jeering and laughing throwing stuff at him and teasing him, Harry was crying he couldn't understand what was happening!
Draco was panicking, his back had started bleeding, he was now about a foot taller but that badly affected his scratches.
Harry was in the process of fixing his shirt at the moment and had no intention to listen in on the conversation until Pomfrey said, "ah yes! What about a lollipop for the good little boy?"
I wrapped my arms around him too. "Don't let anyone see you in something like this" I whispered in his ear and he shivered against me and buried his head in my neck.
"It seems that our little submissive changed into his kitten form by accident." I said with amusement in my eyes. Draco, Tom and Severus walked over to me and looked at Aiden taking in one of his forms and his scent to keep track of him in any form, he might take. "I wonder if he can change back ?" Draco said as he took Aiden from my arms into his own.  Aiden tried to walk up Draco's arm, he was clumsily trying to sit on his shoulder.
"Hello Mr Potter or should I say Mr Lupin," I heard a goblin say from my right . I looked to my right to see a unknown goblin in front of me. "Hello" I greeted the goblin "My name is Bloodfang and I'm the head of Gringotts," Bloodfang explained to me. "Nice to meet you, but can you please explain to me why you keep calling me Mr Lupin?" I asked Bloodfang, instead of answering me he pulled out a dagger,a piece of parchment and a potion. "Cut your finger and drop some blood into the potion, then shake it, last pour it onto the parchment and we will see what and who you are." Bloodfang told me. I did as he told me and waited for something to appear on the parchment.
I'm sorry, it might take a while before I can update again. I have not been feeling well for a long time and it's getting worse and not better.
Harry put his hand over Draco's mouth looking around to see if he saw anybody coming, no one was though.
I chuckled when I saw them make out and gave a sharp whistle to get their attention making them break apart. Tom and I chuckled when we saw how flustered they look.
It has been brought to us The Goblins of Gringotts, that you have came into your magical and creature inheritance. We would like for you to come in so we could help you find out how strong you are. The paper is a port key and the password is "fire" just say it and it will bring you to the head of Gringotts.
Draco sighed whispering the Password "Pech gut," and the painting swung open revealing what looked to be the entire Slytherins all forming a circle around Draco, singing:
After my Dom's showed me their true forms I was still in awe, when they put their Glamours back up. "Let's go pay for your things," Lucius said to me ."We're not done just yet, " I told him with a smirk on my face and a mischievous look in my eyes. "We still have to get shoes and jewelry to go with my pretty new dresses," I told them and walked up to the checkout counter. I heard all of my Dom's groan before walking out of the dressing room. "Just kidding," I told them. I handed the dresses to Madam Malkin and she rang them up. "It will be 900 Gallons," she told me before I could pull out my card, Lucius handed her his own card and she took it. "You did not have to start today, you know?" I told Lucy. "I know, but I wanted to." Draco then proceeded to call a house elf called Bubble. "Mays I help young master?" Bubble asked. "Can you bring these to fathers room?" Draco asked the elf. "Of course, young master," Bubble said and popped off.
"Hey! What type of idiot are you! He is a baby!" Draco yelled growing extremely protective over Harry.
The trio entered Dumbledore's office, with no one inside Draco decided to take a seat with Little Harry on his lap, he knew that it was rude to take a seat with out permission but he wanted to play with Harry.
'' Potter, not only do I find you out of bed past curfew, but I also stumble upon you slicing open your skin with an almost masochistic reverence. If you would indulge, I will not allow you to leave until you have given reason for this inane act,'' The man said, tone aloof and cool, as always.
What was she thinking! But Hermione knew that was the single most best kiss ever, she had wanted it forever! Her lips were soft and delicate and yet lit her on fire.
When they reached the clothing department Draco finally told Harry to stop pulling on his ear and set him down.
He had known, of course, that the homophobia ranged far and wide in the wizarding world, as it was in the muggle realm as well.
"No need don' worry I'll keep those Gryffindors off Harry!" He tapped Harry's little nose before looking at Pansy.
When she was about to lose hope a beautiful lady dressed in a red dress purple lipstick and a dark bob walked in.
I got out of the bed silently and went to do my daily routine. Once done I put on a pair of black joggers and a white shirt to be comfortable while moving everything. Even though we had magic, magic couldn't be used on potions or ingredients, so I had to do it the muggle way and be very careful with my precious ingredients.
"Dearie! I just finished sending off an owl to Dumbledore why don't we leave little Harry here for the night?"
"Who's uncle Vernon next to the great Potters!" Draco said he didn't like the Potters, but everybody knew they were great people and no one argued with that.
As I was pulled into Tom's arms I relaxed in them and took a deep breath to take in his sent. I saw my father's and other family rush to us. I made Tom let go of me and rushed to meet them.
Harry put his hands back over Draco’s mouth and looked around them to see if anyone was coming, but no one was coming and the little boy let out a sigh of relief.
Harry's eyes widened, "I WUV Candwy!!!" He gulped down the syrup which was actually delayed aging potion to turn him five.
Once again this chapter's credit goes to the original author - @ theblobonwallstreet. This is in no way my work.
"I'll do it!" Draco seemed to override Dumbledores voice. He knew Dumbledore would allow it he was such a foolish man!
Draco rushed down the stairs surprised at how fast that little child could run picked him up and ran back to the dorms. Draco began giving Harry a little talking to nothing harsh just a few rules he didn't even notice Pansy scrambling after them.
Draco looked down at the cute little boys face, he was giggling and clapping his little hands together ,Draco forgot all his problems bumping into a wall because he wasn’t focusing on where he was walking, falling down and accidentally let go of little Harry.
They had been disappointed to hear he was gay ( all the girls was very disappointed and Ginevera Weasley the most. Some boys were hopeful that they now stood a chance.) but to hear who he fancied was beyond their comprehension and they tore him apart for it, broken him further as was he already was.
"Mr. Malfoy turned Mr. Potter into a baby during potions." Snape informed Dumbledore rolling his eyes in the process.
''Sir,'' Harry said shakily, looking up at Severus as the man glared down at him with his known sneer.
"My baby is safe!" Draco was crying and smiling deeply at Neville, "how could I ever repay you Neville?" He cried.
When they had reached the door that had once had led to the revolting three headed dog, ( Severus knew that the dog was a Cerberus, it was said that he was the Guardian that guarded the Underworld's / Hell's entrance and his master was Hades.)
Frick, not only was he bringing a baby Harry Potter into the dorms, but he was bringing him on the first day of the new semester! And the new year!
I was a kitten even though I was 17 years of age. After a while of watching my mates, I knew they had forgotten that they had magic, so I meowed as loudly as I could to get their attention , but it only caught Lucius's attention and he looked down at me, just as a look of realization crossed his face, he bent down to pick me up, he  started to scratching behind my ears making me purr. I was so relaxed smoothing waves of my magic poured out of me. My mates almost turned into puddles of goo at the feeling and turned to me and Lucy.
"Wait" I exclaimed once we were all dressed. "Can we go to my dog father's?" I asked my mates. They all looked at each other and it looked like they were having a silent conversation. They finally came to an agreement. "We can go to your dog father's but not for very long," Tom said "But I have to tell them who I really am," I said back to them. A look of realization dawned across their faces. "We will stay however long it takes," Lucy said and took me into his arms. "Okay" I said "Hold on to me " I told all my mates, I was going to bring us all to my real fathers. They did as told and we disappeared with a loud pop and landed in front of #12 Grimmauld Palace. "Do any of you guys have parchment and a quill?" I asked. Draco pulled out parchment and Severus pulled out a quill. The Order of the Phoenix can be found at #12 Grimmauld Palace. I wrote on the paper and showed it to all of my mates. "Memorize it" I told them.
We were brought out of our thoughts by a person appearing before us . It was our submissive mate, He was wearing a short dress that fitted him perfectly and a floor length cloak with matching ear rings. He saw our stairs and pulled his cloak over himself.
He opened up a rather large toy trunk that housed dolls and trucks anything else you could really want to play with.
I was waiting for midnight to come, at midnight it would be my 17th birthday. Right now I was laying down in Dudley's second room on the bed trying to recover from my resent beating from my uncle Vernon.
When I sneezed I didn't know what happened or why my mates and everything got a lot bigger. I watched in amusement as they started panicking even using their creatures to look for me , but all of a sudden I felt something on my face and I went cross eyed to see wat was on my face, just to see I have whiskers on my face, I almost started hyperventilating until I remembered my creature inheritances, suddenly I knew I had some how changed into my kitten form.
"Yes, Madam..." Draco had forgotten about last night until right now when he saw a woman which seemed to resemble Bellatrix?
Frick, not only was he bringing a baby Harry into the dorms, but he was bringing him in on the first day of the semester! Of the year!
When they went to Madam Pomfrey's all she said was that his back was going to randomly bleed at times and wrapped a large bandage around his back to prevent any further bleeding.
He leaned down to kiss me making me melt into him and kiss him back. The kiss was slow and tender, I knew this was what I  have wanted from the start.
Well then Draco, if you are sure that you are up to the task then I see no reason to stop you, but , I also see no reasons to give you anything special for your actions. I would prefer it for you to still keep him in your Slytherin is Dormitory.'' Dumbledore winked at Draco.
‘’ Pottew a bad name! ‘’ Harry said whispering to him as if the little boy was telling Draco a big secret.
His eyes followed the movement of his hand as he hastily tried to put the razor away with out his Professor noticing and he moved swiftly towards Harry, looming over the boy until the boy got awkwardly to his feet.
(A.E: in this fanfic Romione isn't a thing and hope I didn't offend any lesbians! I didn't mean to btw! Continuing on.)
Yes, headmaster, I am sure.'' There was no other way he was sure Snape wouldn't do it and he wouldn't let him be sent back to those people.
Early the next morning Hermione woke up to a little spoon, next to Pansy, they were fully dressed ᵀᴴᴬᴺᴷ ᴳᴼᴰ she thought, she didn't know if she was ready for THAT yet...
Harry pulled on his face forcing him to look down to look at him, ‘’Hawwy don wanna meet new scawy people. ‘’ The little boy almost said in tears.
"I came to say I'm here if you need support, I understand and I think you are still a great Malfoy no matter what!" Pansy smiled.
Draco screamed. All the students turned and faced baby Harry some oohed and awed others laughed and Ron and Hermione laughed, Draco could just hear them saying, "serves the fagot right!"
"I'm not sure Granger must've made some sort of potion I would assume...." Pomfrey looked paler than ever.
I knew I was blushing madly when Severus said that to me, I couldn't make the blush go away. I felt him chuckle and put 2 fingers under my chin to make me look into his pretty onix eyes.
He leaned down to kiss me making me melt into him and kiss him back. The kiss was slow and tender, I knew this was what I  have wanted from the start.
Harry wanted to argue more and even mention to Severus that he could go to jail for delving into his mind with out his permission but the man was already delving in his thoughts.
‘’ No Draco, I think that you will do just fine with what you are provided and all of your fellow Slytherins will help, ‘’ Dumbledore shoved off his complaint without even hearing him out.
I awoke with a body on me and looked down to see Lucius there. I moved so I was sitting up and shook Lucius lightly to wake him up. It took a few minutes but he finally woke up.
Ah, yes, well Severus then you must simply re - age him!'' Dumbledore said in his scratchy voice to Severus with a bit of glee in his voice.
Harry on the other hand kept smiling at Draco either because Snape had shown favour in him or something.... Else.... Draco quickly shook the thought off of him but kept on thinking ᴡʜᴀᴛ ᴀ ғʀᴇᴀᴋ ᴡʜᴀᴛ ɪs ʜᴇ ᴛʜɪɴᴋɪɴɢ?
Little Harry was very cute, he put his hand on Draco's mouth every time he tried to speak. Harry told him cutely, '' No, no, Dwaco listen to Hawwy. I Hawwy you Dwaco wite?'' He asked to Draco.
Draco looked at the Honeydukes employee who looked startled said, "its - on- the - house d- d- d-" Draco rushed out before she could finish and ran straight up to Madam Pomfrey's.
What he didn't know was how violently his supposed friends and mere acquaintances would react to his own confessions.
I was the first to wake up and was spooning Lucius. We were all cuddling (even if I hate to admit it). In the middle was Aiden, then Draco and Lucius on both sides of him, then Tom and I on either sides of them.
"No! I saw you with Blaise! BLAISE! The filthy traitor, this is done!" Pansy cried running to Draco and Harry's dorm.
Hermione walked forwards bending down at the tots size, "Don't listen to Ron little boy... Here take this popsicle it's a great flavour!"
Pansy knew it must be just a friendly gesture, but she was still resisting feeling the place where Hermione's hand had just been.
A week from today was Halloween... She decided that she would ask Pansy out to get butter beer on Halloween.
Draco mustered up the courage to pick Harry up whisper in his ear, "No Harry they don't," he shot the kids a nasty look before taking off to the eighth year dorms.
I put the blue one on my pointer finger on my left hand. I put the red one on my right ring finger and then put the green one on my right pointer finger. I only had the yellow ring left and then I put the yellow ring on my left middle finger. Once they all were in place they disappeared from view. "I can contact your mates for you, while you go shopping," Bloodfang said as he was writing 3 letters.
Pansy grabbed her face and they were kissing, they knew they both wanted this and now they were getting it.
When I heard his thundering foot steps reach the kitchen, I broke down into a mess and started sobbing as quietly as I could.
Draco motioned for the older two to come to the kitchen as Harry laughed and waddled over as well and he couldn't see how worried the three teens looked.
"Draco!!!! You need HELP!!!" Neville cried, at that point they broke down into tears falling asleep next to each other, Harry at some point decided to lie with them.
"Oh Drake...." Neville looked down, were those? No they couldn't be! "Draco could you roll up your sleeves?" Neville asked sheepishly.
"Why are you trying to hang out with me?" Draco tried to act strong and fierce but the truth was he was ecstatic that HARRY POTTER might want to hang out with him!
I chuckled when I saw them make out and gave a sharp whistle to get their attention making them break apart. Tom and I chuckled when we saw how flustered they look.
‘’ Who is uncle Vernon next to the great Potters! ‘’ Draco said,he didn’t like the Potters , but everybody knew that they were great people and no one would argue with that.
Now he needed to see what was up with Pomfrey, he walked in and saw Madam Pomfrey lying on the ground dead.
I was confused after the letter but went to go take a shower, when I passed by the floor length mirror I saw a flash of purple and turned to look back what I saw shocked me. I grew to 5'3 and my eyes changed to the brightest blue I had ever seen.
Harry woke up earlier than Draco so he made his way down to his room and began to explore he found out about the slider and began trying it out deciding on a nice baby blue colour would work fine for him.
On the other hand, there were no other towers that were not fully occupied by either teacher quarters, or student quarters and the Astronomy Tower was the ideal place for anyone to go, whether they intended to pursue sex, stargazing, romance , suicide or simply to have time for themselves, free from the confines of the indoors - since students were no longer allowed on the outdoor grounds with strict adult supervision.
"Dwaco!" Harry ran forwards and hugged him tightly. "Pamsy anwd wenville were kwissing!" Harry intimidated kissing.
I slowly woke up but I was sore everywhere. Looked around and saw 6 owls sitting around with packages I got up and went over to unload them of their burdens, the first owl was from Remus and Sirius.
"Oh, shit! We need to get ready," Draco picked up the baby and placed him in a chair, "what would you like for breakfast boo boo?" He asked.
There was more of variety, sometimes in some places and in other others, more hatred. All this information he knew.
We decided to go to Tom's manor first to get everything he wanted and needed that was necessary to him, but before we could apparate. Aiden sneezed and disappeared in a quiet pop.
I jumped into my father's arms. "Siri, Remy." I wispered as I hugged the life out of them. "Harry we can't breath," Remy told me . I blushed and stepped back. "Sorry" I said to them. "Oh, I came here for a reason and I need to do some things today" I told them. "Okay, pup but why are Snape ,The Malfoy's, and an unknown person doing here?" Siri growled out. I laughed nervously "It's a long story" I told them. "We have time" they said at the same time."We'll can I have all The Weasley's but not Ginny and Mrs Weasley, the Headmaster , any other teachers here and that is it, to the kitchen." I said to them and all of these people went to the kitchen. "Why not us?" The people that names weren't mentioned asked me. "Because, I don't need you" I said and pulled my mates to the kitchen and closed the door behind me and put up a lot of spells and charms so no one could break them or try to eavesdrop. "What's wrong Harry" Mr. Weasley asked. I went over to him and hugged him and he hugged me back. Then I told them all about what happened to me and who I really am.
"Why not? Snape loves you!" Draco laughed picking Harry up. "I need to go in so you do to, you know the rules boo," Draco looked at Harry.
"Sorry little bud I was really mean to make it up for you I'll take you to honey dukes today okay?" He smiled down at Harry.
"Bloodfang do you have my inheritance paper?" I asked him instead of answering he passed the paper to me and I passed it to my two closes mates. When they were reading the paper they almost lost control of their magic.
My Dom's all handsome in their own ways. Their hair were all to their waists and taller than me, that was the same as mine but the color of their eyes were different and I could not wait for them claim me as theirs.
"Well Pomfrey has asked me to do a check up on the room once in a while.... I was checking her office when I found this!" He pulled out a shiny bullet, "A bullet I found a simple spell which told me what had happened in this room.... I only had to go back a few weeks to see YOU walk in and suddenly what? Pomfrey was shot!"
try to walk up my arm to sit on my shoulder and I helped him get to his destination. "Can you change back?" I asked Aiden. My little Quis Fortis shook his head no and started to fall asleep on me. "Can we actually start moving tomorrow and get some sleep?" I asked my mates quietly not to disturb Aiden from his sleep. Instead of someone answering me, Tom took us to his bedroom and we all fell asleep, but not before I put Aiden down. So that we could make more progress tomorrow.
I was surprised and confused when I came into my inheritance on my 17th birthday and that same day I found two of my mates, Lucius and Tom. They loved me with every fault and I loved them back.
Harry giggled then put on a much more serious face and whispered in Draco's ear, ‘’ Uncum Verwom .‘’
Your new mate has come to Gringotts and had taken their inheritance test. He had me contact you for he whishes to meet you in a few hours. The parchment you are holding is a port key for you and your other mates to take you four straight to my office.
"Okay, Hawwy, wanna be 5!" Harry ran around the house pretending to be super man, "you said super man stay up thwis wate!"
"Okay, hop on," Draco bent over as the made their way out of the Slytherin dorms and up to madam Pomfreys.
Even though Snape seemed to favour the small child, Harry didn't like his greasy hair or big nose or how he always snapped at HIS Draco! HIS!
I was the first to wake up and was spooning Lucius. We were all cuddling (even if I hate to admit it). In the middle was Aiden, then Draco and Lucius on both sides of him, then Tom and I on either sides of them.
Harry was panicking, ‘’ Oh, no! Hawwy kill Dwaco, no no no Hawwy no want to kiwl Dwaco! Hawwy wuf Dwwaco! ‘’ Harry sat on the ground and began crying a big puddle of tears on the ground as he was panicking about Draco before Draco stood up and picked up the crying toddler.
Within hours Bellatrix was taken to Azkaban stuff was not looking good for the blonde in fact he had a questioning next month! But he had Harry he had the best time with that silly kid. He said the funniest things and was just plain adorable!
Potter turned and set upon the next flight of stairs. He was quick to follow, staying in the shadows as he had done so many times before, on so many  of the same nights, following exactly this one person. ( Severus knew that it was stalking, but he just wanted to know what this boy was up to and what he was doing.) He could do this in his sleep, he was quite sure, but stayed cautious from fear of becoming presumptuous. He did not yet wish to miscalculate and reveal his presence to the boy he was following.
"Go wild kid!" He smiled going up to the person working there, "if Harry eats anything just tell me I'll pay for it," he winked and chased after Harry.
I JUST WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW THAT I MAY NOT POST FOR A WHILE I AM ENTERING MY OWN ORIGANAL BOOK ABOUT A VAMPIRE ON BOOKNET FOR THE NEXT THREE MONTHS.
"Today we will be testing you, you and a partner must complete a potion with no book or other help," Snape flicked his wand making the classes potions books clear and neatly stack onto his desk.
As he reached their dorm and entered he saw Pansy and Neville snogging, as Harry looked at them strangely.
'' I don't think you have the right to know that, Sir, '' Harry said with as much malice as he could muster, his chin jutting out with defiance.
"Ronald is a bitch, he's kept me from Harry, from accepting him, telling me to do stuff or else! I hate him!" Hermione sobbed.
Draco cleared his throat and said ‘’ Headmaster Dumbledore, I really do not think that's a very good idea, I mean - ‘’
I would have to get my ears pierced, but I was going to do that anyway "How much is this all together ma'am?" I asked the owner of the store. "Everything you want is 750 Galleons all together." Madam Malkin said. I gave her the amount, plus 50 more Galleons extra as a tip and everything she had done for me. Next I went to a Magical ear piercing place and got the ear piercings that I wanted.
"Class dismissed..." Snape scowled but before Draco could rush to have a word with him he ran into his office.
I did what he told me to do and ended up at Diagon Ally, the very first place I went to was " Robes for all Occasions". Where I got silver ,blue ,purple ,and Black floor length robes. They fit me perfectly in all of the right places, giving people a look at my body, but they wouldn't look for long after I meet my mates . But there was something that caught my eye, it was a dress with a matching cloak and earrings.
That's when Dumbledore decided to walk into the room all dramatically, Draco almost rolled his eyes at the dramatics but it would ruin his pureblood mask.
"It's just that.... We'll first of all Blaise and me... Well we.... we had sex," Neville looked at Draco who was clearly stunned, "I mean I was under a love potion, but it felt right? Like I wanted it? It all sounds so wrong! Than Pansy broke up with me, and she's dating Granger!"
But it was faint,he quickly thought about everything he knew about muggle wounds and repaired it, he thought not to tell anyone what just happened he even erased the last 10 minutes of her mind.
"Let's go, " Tom said and took Aiden's hand before walking to Ollivanders. "Welcome back Mr Potter or is it Mr. Black?" Ollivander asked. "It's Lupin-Black" Aiden told him.
"If you keep up with that we won't get anything done today" I told them and Aiden moved to greet Tom and I.
This caused the vial to tip over and caused a drop to go onto Harry's water bottle that hadn't been enclosed into the vial... Draco startled picked up the vial not noticing the liquid seeping into Harry's water bottle and quickly sat it up right.
"Remember put the shirt on right actually let's get your cream done shall we..." he grabbed the cream and spread it over Harry's back, which was so full of scars it hurt Draco to see it.
"Come with me," she took Harry and Draco to a painting with a grassy landscape and she said "Whare Liebe" the painting swung open revealing a beautiful dormitory with a complete common room!
Harry hopped off the chair and disappeared for a moment returning with some tight jeans and T-shirt.
Draco sat down and began to watch a wizard show on a network he had just found. And started to prepare for a long night.
The house elves cleaned up, then we went to all of our old homes to move everything we needed to the new one and soon we were finished.
"To go Trick or Treating!" Draco smiled, he knew it was a fun muggle custom, but didn't care any way.
I was walking down the Alley when I saw an owl coming towards me, it looked Regal and I recognised the owl. I gently took the letter from the owl and began reading it.
"No, you see, Nev, you got these two sections mixed up... Hey guys!" Pansy waves at the two signalling to come sit.
"So your ready to be a big kid tomorrow! But first you need to drink this," Draco had an orange liquid on a spoon.
All of them just didn't care if he was already broken nor did they care that they broke him further.
"Neville, I hate you. I don't care what you think, Hermione has her explanations, it's all Ron who's in the wrong, and you! You are just a piece of dirt." Pansy snarled and walked away.
"No, Harry, Draco has to get ready for-" Draco stopped himself it was Saturday there was no school today.
Harry and Draco walks down the cold corridor at around 8, Harry is getting tired but Draco insisted that it's the best time to find Halloween costumes.
He closed his eyes and leaned his head back against the stone wall, his mind calling forth unbidden memories of the countless dreams and fantasies he had detained of his Professor, finally able to relax under the cold stars.
"I live dare," Harry sounded bored more than scared what crap has this kid gone through? "Now let's wead stowy!"
'' Sir, I have nothing to say to you, '' Harry replied, trying and failing to sound as if he were indifferent to what Severus was saying.
"Whatever! What brings you here?" Pansy asked whispering an address in a barn owls ear watching as it takes off.
Harry began to cry letting go of the wand he grabbed the wand and than picked Harry up, "now go to your room I'll tell you when breakfast is ready,"
Draco crouched down and looked Harry right in the eyes, "Who told you Potter was a bad name, boo boo?"
H͟͟a͟͟ t͟͟h͟͟a͟͟t͟͟'s͟͟ n͟͟o͟͟t͟͟ t͟͟h͟͟e͟͟ e͟͟n͟͟d͟͟ i͟͟d͟͟i͟͟o͟͟t͟͟s͟͟ k͟͟e͟͟e͟͟p͟͟ r͟͟e͟͟a͟͟d͟͟i͟͟n͟͟g͟͟!
All the way they rushed to Dumbledore's office he comforted the boy growing a connection with the sweet baby boy. His dimples crinkled up when he laughed and drooped when he cried he was adorable, basically.
"You are the last one to wake up" I told him. Lucy simply nodded and got out of the bed pulling me with him. Together we went through our morning routine and soon we were done. I had on red joggers and a white shirt ,while Lucius had on light blue joggers and a white shirt .
"This is ridiculous," he mutters. Out of the corner of his eyes, he sees Potter squirm, something like suprise flitters across his face.
She DID notice however, that Draco and Harry were closer then they'd ever been. Not in the physical sense, but in the sense of they were friends. Not pretending anymore. Though if she had to guess, they probably still wouldn't admit it. Stubborn boys.
"Luna I really like you." He breathed. It didn't feel forced or rushed. He and Luna always seemed to do things at their own pace and it worked for them.
"Well where have you been?" Draco asked slowly, looking back and forth between the two people in front of him.
She felt Blaise's hand cover hers rather possessively so she turned to face him and he just smiled down at her and planted a kiss on her lips. She rolled her eyes at his affection but she knew that he knew she loved it. But  she still batted his hands away. (Which he immediately wrapped around her waist, and burrowed his face into her neck and shoulder) and turned back to the boys who had now arrived and seated. Harry opposite to Malfoy. This was definitely quite the scene. She wanted details!
"Dunno. Everyones avoiding me except you really. And maybe Ron but hes just gone. I'm really confused on what's going on. "
They continued shopping, Draco grabbing items that might be useful later like the Peruvian Darkness Powder, Chocolates that gave the eater huge painful blisters, a couple Dung Bombs, and a blanket that kept a perfect temperature of 18° C. Potter raised his eyebrow at the last item he'd grabbed and watched as Draco blushed.
"So, Luna, what have you been up to this summer?" Probably not the best phrase but it was just going to be what he went with.
Severus noted the slight tremble of the boy’s hand when he took a steadying sip of the amber liquid before crossing the room and taking a seat. They sat quietly for a while, lost in thought and alcohol, before Severus spoke.
“Infirmary,” Fred mumbled while rubbing his neck. “I’ll take you there,” he offered, laying a hand on her shoulder.
Once the students lined up, Snape announced, “We have a new housemate whom most of you have become accustomed to over the weekend. I will not tell you more than this, but Mr. Potter has been officially re-sorted into Slytherin as of an hour ago.”
When Lucius remained silent, Narcissa scoffed in irritation. “Honestly, Lucius, there is no one better than Harry. Even if you ignore the fact that he is enamoured with our Dragon and rich enough to provide for him without touching a single knut in the Malfoy vaults, there is the political clout his name brings us. Sadly, of all the merits regarding Draco’s prospects, I know the one you favour,” she sniffed derisively.
“Not here, Mr. Potter. I will explain in my office.” Severus pointed to the shoes under the bed in silent order before slipping out of the curtained area with Pomfrey. Harry sank on the bed and tied his laces with numb fingers, glancing furtively at the mute blond in front of him.
“Shh, Harry. I’ll speak to my parents. They’ll fix this. I know you don’t care for my father, and I can’t blame you, but he has sway in the Ministry. He can get things sorted with your relatives, alright?” Shoving aside his anger at Harry’s mistreatment, Draco poured care and compassion into him with each heartbeat. But a fresh wave of icy terror flowed through the bond and Draco shuddered.
Pushing off the wall, he willingly offered his back to the man he’d spent their school years tormenting, allowing him to lay the cloak over his shoulders. His breath hitched when Harry’s fingertips skirted his collarbones in the faintest caress. Maneuvering around him, Harry reached up and flipped the large hood over his head, stepping back with a critical eye to ensure he was hidden. Nodding in satisfaction, he beckoned Draco to follow him.
Outfit in hand, he snagged Draco’s sleeve as he passed and whispered in his ear, “I want everything, Draco.”
“Slytherin,” Harry interrupted confidently. “It wanted to sort me there first year, but I argued against it due to gossip I heard on the Hogwarts Express that made me distrust the House.”
“You’ve worked yourself to the bone. You can’t blame yourself for students being entirely too clever and vindictive for their own good,” McGonagall replied wearily.
Narcissa smiled triumphantly. “Of course I have, darling. I never go into battle without victory assured.” Pouring a second cup for each of them, she continued breezily, “You should expect a response from the Parkinsons. I sent off a letter this morning terminating the agreement between our families.”
A gentle hand rubbed his back, and he instinctively leaned into Draco’s grounding touch, his tense muscles unbunching under soothing fingers.
“You think I don’t know that?” Harry said, eyes sparkling with mirth. “Have you forgotten who my best friend is? She read everything about soulmates in the library during our first year and insisted we memorize them. We may not have grown up in the wizarding world, but Hermione is nothing if not prepared.”
Sliding his free hand behind Harry’s neck, Draco adjusted the angle and dipped his face to meet him. “I love you,” he sighed against his lips.
Flashing him a shy smile, Harry disappeared behind the green velvet curtains and tried to catch his breath. So much had happened in a few scant hours, but he honestly didn’t regret any of it. Accepting his former rival into the fold and spilling his darkest secrets to him didn’t feel wrong after what Draco did for him over the summer. If that didn’t prove where his loyalties truly lied, then Harry didn’t know what would.
Chuckling softly, Harry tipped his head toward Draco. The elf’s eyes widened comically when he recognized him, but Harry laid a gentle hand on his bony arm. “He’s a friend, Dobby. Would you mind getting us some tea, please?”
“I did. What about you?” Harry smiled at Draco’s nod before fiddling with the edge of his napkin. “Are we telling the others when we get back? About the potions?”
As they tugged on their outer robes, Draco stepped in front of Harry, smiling at the curiosity dancing across his face. Nimble fingers loosened his tie and Harry’s breath hitched when grey eyes darkened as he expertly reworked the silk. From his periphery, Harry saw the wicked smirks exchanged between their roommates, but he couldn’t tear his gaze away from Draco to call them out.
Harry wasn’t her only clue, either. Malfoy had been incredibly subdued since Harry’s cursed sleep; no longer tormenting the first years or deducting massive House points on Prefect rounds. His usual jeers toward the Gryffindors were nonexistent, and he stopped joining the Inquisitorial Squad, which had become quite rabid after the failed attack on Umbridge, on their missions to shut down the DA.
Draco blinked as Harry raked a hand through his messy hair to center himself. His throat clicked loudly in the deafening silence when he swallowed the lump threatening to unravel the threads of his composure as he fell into mesmerizing silver pools.
“We were young and stupid when we declared each other enemies. But we’re older now and we both know there are bigger things to worry about than petty school feuds,” Harry stated simply. “You need someone in your corner and I’m offering to be that person.” Draco bristled at the imagined slight in his words, but Harry shook his head in annoyance and cut him off.
The Hall exploded into furious whispers the moment Dumbledore sat down, while hatred emanated from the Gryffindor table like a heatwave.
Their professor arched a skeptical brow, but Draco turned to him hopefully. “Tell me what you’re thinking.”
“You slept on the bloody flagstones last night, Harry. Take the damn bed,” he demanded with a huff. Ducking his head to hide his pleased flush, Harry set his remaining clothes on top of Draco’s trunk and jerked a thumb toward the door.
“Headmaster,” Severus said, his impatience apparent when he looked pointedly at the Hat. Dumbledore sighed, and the professor took it as permission, snatching the artefact and placing it on Harry’s head. The comfortable tingle of the Hat’s magic seeped into his mind, but its raspy voice spoke aloud, surprising everyone.
“I’m fine, Draco,” he reassured quietly, hyper-aware of the unknown Slytherins scattered around the room. “Ready to go?”
“I’d just discovered an entire universe hidden in the heart of London,” Harry continued. “A world I should have grown up in but was wholly ignorant of. Dumbledore tasked Hagrid with taking me shopping for supplies and during one of his rambling explanations about Hogwarts, he said Slytherin House had a reputation for producing Dark wizards.” He shook his head sadly. “The idea that something could tarnish this new world terrified me. And yeah, you didn’t help your case when you insulted the first person who was ever nice to me and then proudly announced before our sorting which House you wanted.”
No sooner had he turned to leave than the Fat Friar glided through a nearby wall. He paused at the sound of Harry’s muffled cries. Tutting kindly in the empty hallway, the ghost said, “If someone happened to be up and about, lonely and peckish, I would recommend a visit to the kitchen for a spot of tea in front of a warm fire. Look for the fruit basket on the wall and tickle the pear. Tell them the friar sent you and they’ll take care of you.”
Harry’s cries quieted as he listened and Draco forced himself to press on, though his tongue felt weighted with lead by his uncharacteristic vulnerability.
“Does it feel like it might mean...everything?” Draco asked uncertainly, closing the distance between them. Harry nodded, neck turning pink when he peered at him through dark lashes, and Draco’s heart stopped.
Raising his wand, he ignored the defensive stance of the agitated Auror and intoned crisply. “I swear on my magic that nothing seen or heard at this meeting, nor any subsequent meetings in which I escort Harry Potter, shall ever pass my lips. So mote it be.”
Smiling softly to allay her fear, she said, “I’m sure you’ve heard of Mr. Potter’s…predicament.” The girl flushed slightly and nodded.
Exhaling sharply through his nose, Harry said, “Remember the day we met in Madam Malkins? That was my first time in Diagon. I’d only known about the existence of magic for maybe twelve hours. Everything was new and shiny and bright: pictures that moved, chocolate that hopped, goblins running a bank, and owl post! It was, for lack of a better word,
Fewer students were milling about, so their return to the dungeons was mercifully uneventful. Upon reaching the entrance, Severus tapped a specific pattern on the wall and muttered a password, overwriting the old one, before leading the way into the common room. The sudden appearance of their Head of House caused a stir, but despite his perpetual scowl, he waited patiently as the Prefects rounded up everyone in the dormitories.
Draco set an alarm as soon as Harry’s face disappeared behind the bed curtains before flopping against his mound of pillows with a ragged exhale. He’d wanted to be close to Harry since he was eleven, and now that he'd been granted a second chance, he couldn’t quite believe it. Pinching his arm, he winced at the sharp pain that proved he wasn’t dreaming and tugged his bag closer to distract him from the boy resting mere feet away.
“Thanks, Draco,” he said. Turning apologetically to his friends, he said, “I know we had plans to hang out, but I think I'll take a nap before dinner. I’m knackered.”
An ear-piercing shriek rent the air and silenced the furor in the hall. Lowering his wand, Dumbledore rose from his place at the Head table with a serious expression.
His hand shot out and snagged Draco’s wrist before he could second-guess himself and tugged him wordlessly onto the bed. Draco gulped but followed the motion without complaint. Staying on top of the duvet, he closed the distance between them, all too aware Harry could hear his pounding heart when he burrowed against his chest.
“I’m fine with either. I’ll probably close the curtains, anyway, so if you want to hang out here it won’t bother me.” There was a pregnant pause while he fidgeted before he rubbed the back of his neck and asked, “You really don’t mind me crashing here? Won’t your roommates care?”
Draco shivered and buried his face against his neck, dampening Harry’s shirt with saltwater at the terrifying admission of a near-death experience. He knew there had been a few such moments over the past year since Harry was always especially chatty those nights, needing Draco to distract him from the reality of war. But he had a feeling there was more to this story, though he didn’t doubt Harry would share it when he was ready.
“Why what?” Draco asked, brow furrowed in confusion. “Why blokes or why Potter? Why do I torment him instead of showering him with compliments? Why do I tell everyone I can’t stand him when it’s rather the opposite?”
Licking his lips nervously, Draco cupped his face with his free hand, memorizing the softness of his skin against his palm and the peaceful expression on his face, in case this was the last time he was granted permission to be this close.
Flushing slightly under his expectant gaze, he prayed he wasn’t about to make a fool of himself. “What about Veela hair?”
She levelled him with an intense glower, and he quailed under the rage simmering in her ice-blue eyes. “It wasn’t official. There were no legal documents promising our children to one another or discussing the terms to combine our assets. It was merely a verbal
Colin squeaked and hurried away, deciding that as Harry had an escort, his presence was no longer needed. Draco and Harry nodded to their scowling professor as they exited, wincing when the door slammed behind them.
Harry didn’t care what other people said. He was finally in the House he was meant to be in, with friends who understood him on a level the Gryffindors were incapable of after three years. Not to mention Draco, who’d always defied description, and continued to elude explanation despite learning more about him.
The mediwitch tore her gaze off the sheet and swallowed several times before finding her voice. “No, I cannot. As his Head of House, Severus, you act as his magical guardian. Unless Harry wishes for someone else to take that role, no one else shall ever know what we’ve been made privy to.”
A faint scuff outside caught their attention and Draco jerked his head to the door with a wink. Harry waggled his eyebrows mischievously as the blond tiptoed to the centre of the room.
It has been brought to my attention that I need to list every character that will be bashed in the story. Well, considering the story is incomplete and I don't want to fill the tag list with unnecessary crap that's what the "Gryffindors being asshats" tag is for. It's an all-encompassing warning. So, y'know, fair fucking warning.
returning to Gryffindor tower to face the blasted music; inwardly cringing when he imagined the epic rant Ron and Hermione would have lined up for choosing to ally with the hated House.
Snickering quietly, Harry relaxed with the ribbing and shot him a grateful smile. “Yeah, I like it, too. Still don’t know how he did it, but I can’t let Blaise become the master of my hair. I won’t give him the satisfaction,” he said in poor imitation of Draco’s haughtiness. The snarky comment sent them into a fit of giggles, to which their friends rolled their eyes when they entered.
,” Theo hissed, leaning so far out of his armchair, he nearly toppled onto Blaise. “No wonder you fit in. You’re meant to be one of us.”
Rolling his eyes in irritation, he said, “A room that only appears when you need it and provides whatever you ask for. Hence, its other name, the Room of Requirement.”
“Potter’s one of mine now,” he announced without preamble. “He’s under my protection, which means he’s under all of ours. If you have questions, direct them to me. But know this: I may not deign to answer and you’ll just have to accept that. We’ve struck an accord and I won’t tolerate any bullshit about it.”
The partnership between the boys proved to the world that the past was truly past and common ground could be easily cultivated. Angling her face toward the table, she hid her smile behind her teacup as Harry recovered first, scrambling to his feet and extending a hand to Draco, their hold lingering for a beat or two once they were both upright.
Stepping aside, he ushered the group inside and double-checked the hall for eavesdroppers and suspicious paintings. Warding the door with a layer of privacy spells, he pressed a finger to his lips and tilted his head to the portrait over his mantle. Pride welled in his chest for his godson when they nodded and remained silent.
Wincing in pain and regret, George panted, “We, uh, had a brilliant plan to get rid of Umbridge, you see.”
Biting his lip with indecision, Harry studied him carefully and found only genuine concern. Taking a chance to trust the boy who’d pulled the curtain on his own secrets, he haltingly explained what happened in Gryffindor tower. His stomach flipped when Draco’s concern morphed into anger, growing into dread when the Slytherin demanded clarification on what set off his panic attack. Unable to stop himself, Harry blurted the story of his childhood, the words flowing from his lips like a ruptured dam. Draco’s rage turned murderous as the unedited story of Harry’s life shattered everything he believed about the Golden Boy.
“Flibbertigibbet,” Harry mumbled to the portrait. He grimaced when the Fat Lady sniffed disapprovingly at him but said nothing in his defence as it swung open.
Harry growled in frustration when Katie Bell told him she had no recollection of who passed her the necklace. He didn’t blame her for the memory lapse, but it didn’t help him narrow down the list of suspects, either.
Despite the bone-weary exhaustion making him feel decades older, it had been worth it. Glancing around the Great Hall, Harry took stock of how many of them survived the night. Though the casualties on their side had not been many, they’d lost good, brave people who could never be replaced.
.” Clenching his fists, he forced the words through his teeth with difficulty. “It wasn’t by choice. The options were: take the Mark to make up for Father’s mistakes or let Greyback have my mother.”
“Heiress Millicent Bulstrode,” Pansy said, moving right along to the curvy brunette with a small mouth and a permanently bored expression. Her brown eyes were warm, however, easing the harshness of her fixed features as she, too, curtsied. He bowed again and just managed to keep the astonishment off his face when Millicent spoke.
, Draco’s brain supplied through the swirl of horrifying information. How had the wizarding world’s hero grown up abused without anyone noticing? His heart ached for Harry. He’d sorely misjudged him and ruthlessly tormented him when he clearly had a plethora of personal demons to battle. Merlin, he’d been such a prick. Without thinking, Draco pulled him into his arms for a tight hug and ran a hand through his thick hair to calm him.
A strange hum vibrating along his core caught his attention right before the doors to the hall burst open with a surge of chaotic magic. Harry twirled wand in hand to face the new threat, but he dropped it, mouth agape when he saw Draco in the entryway. He’d filled out during their separation, gaining weight and muscle, and grown into his jawline. The healthy flush on his cheeks reminded Harry of berries and clotted cream, and he desperately wanted to know if he would taste it on his lips.
“Come on. You need more sleep, but your idiot dorm mates are probably holed up in the tower. However, I have the solution to your problem,” Draco smirked, aiming to lighten the mood.
A hand snagged her hooded robe as she passed an empty room, but another clamped over her mouth before she could scream.
But Dumbledore’s warnings rang through Harry’s head like a broken record. He was contractually obligated to compete through the magic of the Goblet, or he would lose his magic. Not to mention the tasks themselves were designed to test the champions’ mettle in brutal and daring ways, famed for ending in death for many of the tournament’s previous contenders.
“Please, sir,” Colin pleaded, wringing his hands. “The Headmaster says he must come. Mr. Ollivander is coming from London and —”
Memories of the Quidditch World Cup months earlier flashed through his mind. The Malfoy’s in their private box, spines straight and aristocratic masks firmly in place. The raucous celebration of the Irish fans after their win, interrupted by screams and the chilling laughter of Death Eaters as they tormented the campers. Getting caught by his school rival in the trees with an emergency portkey in his hands, demanding he take his friends and flee.
It was close enough to the truth to be believable and surrounded by cunning Slytherins he didn’t have to worry about one of them causing a scene over minor details, like Hermione was famous for doing.
“Skipping the Samhain festivities, I see? This must be about Potter then.” He harrumphed when the boy nodded curtly. “I can’t do anything about it. It’s a magically binding contract. He’ll have to compete or forfeit his magic, though I can’t figure out how he managed to get his name in or trick the Goblet into a fourth champion.”
“I wonder what else Potter doesn’t know,” Blaise said in an undertone. The sobering statement earned thoughtful looks from the others and an approving nod from the blond as he lounged against the high-back chair.
Both of Severus’ eyebrows rose at that, but Draco’s expression hardened and he launched out of his chair, pacing the room while gesturing wildly.
Chuckling in disbelief, Draco said, “You’re not. An annoying git with a smart mouth maybe, but I like that about you,” he teased before sobering. “The Dark Lord attacked you when you were an infant and placed a target on your back, but that was never any fault of yours, Harry.”
“This is one for the books,” Draco stated with conviction. “Generations of cursebreakers and potion masters will study the twins’ poisoned apple until someone finally cracks how they work in combination so effectively.”
“How long?” Harry asked as his thumb rubbed mindless circles on the sliver of exposed skin above the waistband of Draco’s trousers.
The proof of their bond was both exhilarating and terrifying. Exhilarating, in that he’d hoped for a tie to Harry, but terrifying in that he doubted the Gryffindor would be best pleased with their situation. Recognizing the need for reciprocity, he roughly untucked and unbuttoned his shirt, yanking the fabric aside and revealing his secret to the boy he could no longer claim to hate.
He suddenly doubted Albus was ever unaware of Sirius Black’s innocence, which might be why Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump Dumbledore never pressed for a trial. Veritaserum would’ve easily proven Black’s story about Pettigrew and granted him custody of Harry, instead of the Dursleys, making the boy less malleable for Albus’ schemes.
A year ago Harry would’ve responded aggressively, but things had mellowed between them since their summer encounter; their taunts giving way to stilted acknowledgement in the halls and shared classes. And now, with no one else to rely on since his name emerged from the Goblet last night, Harry wasn't about to risk being an arse to the only person who sought him out. Nor did he want to when he realized the quiver in Malfoy’s voice mimicked his terror from the World Cup.
Harry caged him against the wall with a growl and glared at him. “Fuck, no, Draco. I wouldn’t...you drive me mental, but I hope I have more self-control than that,” he said, mouthing kisses along his jaw. “You’re so fucking arrogant, so bloody pompous, but fuck if I don’t love your posh accent and your damn smirk.”
His opinion of the man reached an all-time low after the gut-wrenching revelations from the night before; leaving Harry defenceless at the hands of cruel muggles was irresponsible and utterly reprehensible. Discovering that Dumbledore pushed him toward Gryffindor by not-so-subtly placing Molly at the platform when a lost Harry needed rescuing, combined with Hagrid’s ham-handed warnings against Slytherin, was the last straw.
“I bet Dumbledore let him,” spat Seamus. “Always been the Headmaster’s favourite. Wonder why that is?”
Harry held his gaze with an intensity that should’ve been terrifying, yet felt oddly comforting. “Yes, I will. Though I won’t lie, your loyalty and theirs might be suspect without a vow.
“Harry, I will have your new timetable ready at breakfast. Do not be late. You’ll also start your nutrition potions tonight. I’ll have Teekey deliver one while I brew a fresh supply this evening. Take it either an hour before meals so you aren’t too full to eat or an hour after, should you forget. Start with small portions at meals and work up to larger ones as your appetite naturally increases. Any questions?”
I’m so glad it’s done, but damn, it’s impossible to work when strange men are in my house and I have to distract a toddler from the madness that is screwing up our routine. And that’s BEFORE this chapter decided to eat my lunch and be completely uncooperative, but this is where we ended up.
Vain? Perhaps. But there wasn’t anything wrong with enjoying simple pleasures or caring for the only body a person had.
Blinking out of the haze of memories, Malfoy’s expression turned contemplative and Harry realized he’d been fiddling with a button of his uniform under his loose tie. Instead of sneering, the corner of Malfoy’s mouth curled in a faint smile, and he dipped his head in acknowledgement. Harry returned it with a lopsided grin before ducking his head to hide his flushed cheeks and rejoined the conversation taking place around him.
Actually, now that he thought about it, someone probably had realized it and decided that was reason enough to not make such information common knowledge. And oh, didn’t that royally piss him off.
Theo’s alarm blared at an ungodly hour and, despite the Slytherins’ grumbling, they rolled out of bed moments after. However, it took all three of them to extract Harry from his cocoon. Though after a rousing hot shower, Harry found he appreciated the extra time when Blaise dragged him back to the bathroom after he dressed to tame his hair with various charms and styling products.
Shrugging half-heartedly, he said, “You might feel that way, but does Harry? How can you be sure? What if the reason he hasn’t said anything is that he doesn’t want to ruin anything between you two?”
He didn’t know what to think anymore, except that he didn’t regret his choice. The sheer multitude of unanswered questions regarding his former housemates proved he never knew them at all.
Steeling himself for the awful truth of what the diagnostic spells would reveal, he nodded. “I’d like Draco and Professor Snape to be present, if that’s alright.”
Ice settled in Harry’s gut when he realized who Malfoy meant. There couldn’t be anyone else capable of reducing the proud scion of pureblood elitism to this shocking display of emotion. Shame coursed hot up his throat as he watched him break. Instead of assuming the worst and stalking him, he should have shown compassion and offered to help.
“Why?” he whispered, worrying his ragged cuticles. “Why did you help me this summer? Why help me now?”
“May I say something?” Draco searched her face for a moment before nodding. “Harry is a wonderful person, as you’ve already mentioned, but he’s a bit dense regarding feelings. There is a high possibility he returns your affection, but he doesn’t know it himself.”
“No, Master Snape,” she said, flopping her ears with a shake of her head. “The other elves will not remove it, either.”
As it was, everyone they came across on the lazy Sunday gave them a wide berth with Snape’s long stride leading the way, robes billowing in his wake. To outsiders, it looked as though the notoriously snide professor was leading Harry to his doom. He didn’t miss the nasty smirks and excited gossip spreading at the thought of Harry getting his comeuppance.
Shaking out the shimmering fabric with a smile, Harry held it open in invitation. “Now come on. Let’s get going. The sooner the better, yeah?”
While part of him was admittedly nervous about the students’ reaction, a larger part was excited. Most of the Slytherin classes were solo or held with Ravenclaw, though they still had Potions and DADA with Gryffindor, and Pansy glumly informed him they shared Divination with Hufflepuff, but it could be worse.
By midday, the entire school heard the story of Harry swiping Umbridge’s apple from her desk after his detention and collapsing outside the DADA classroom with the first bite. Padma Patil found him during her Prefect rounds and immediately levitated him to the infirmary, running into the Weasley twins on the way, who realized their mistake and bolted to Gryffindor Tower.
Rubbing her temples with another glance toward the infirmary, Madam Pomfrey mused thoughtfully. “I’ve heard mention of Ms. Chang from Ravenclaw being seen with him from time to time. Ask his friends about her. Maybe we’ll get lucky and he’ll be right as rain in a couple of days.”
Harry chewed his lip as his perception of the brusque Slytherin shifted further. In light of Draco’s confession, he understood why he acted the way he did. Why he tried to mould himself into his father’s idea of the perfect Malfoy to avoid the man’s wrath.
A shock wave of Harry’s magic shook the chamber, startling the wizards present and the observing portraits. He glared at Dumbledore with fire in his eyes as he rose to his feet, his power crackling and charging the room with an uneasy aura.
Slender fingers rested against his mouth, halting his torrent of words. “No, Harry,” he whispered as he laid their foreheads together. “We still have time. You’ll defeat him and we’ll have all the time in the world. But you have to promise to stay alive.”
“With me.” Severus bit his cheek as Draco floundered when he realized how that statement could be misconstrued. “Not like that! Merlin’s arse! Why does everyone automatically assume…”
“I should wake him so he doesn’t miss dinner,” he replied woodenly. No one mentioned there were three hours until dinner as he swept out the door, leaving his friends with more questions than answers.
Spinning his goblet on the table with a considering frown, Draco said, “We should, to avoid suspicious questions in public, but not tonight. I don’t have it in me, I’m afraid.”
Draco smiled, his thumb skirting across his hand before letting him go. “Come on, then. The sooner we go inside, the sooner we can have this done.”
In a hazy part of his brain, he heard a soft voice counting his breaths and felt thumbs rub soothing circles on his biceps. It slowly drew him from his near panic and brought the room into focus once more. Blinking dazedly at Draco’s concerned face, he smiled faintly as his vision cleared.
Though, with the possibility of Harry being attracted to boys, she began surreptitiously observing likely candidates. Ernie Macmillan was a Hufflepuff, and fairly good-looking, but kind of an idiot. Anthony Goldstein or Terry Boot, maybe? They were both Ravenclaws and therefore, not stupid, but they weren’t engaging enough to catch his eye. No matter how she tried to deny it, Malfoy was at the top of the list.
before he could protest. Though, once the water hit his parched tastebuds, he realized it was exactly what he needed.
Staring out the large windows revealing the eerie magnificence of the Black Lake, he muttered, “I belonged in Gryffindor once, but Ron and Seamus have always been insanely jealous of me. Picking fights over my fame, asking me to use my name for favours, while simultaneously despising that I have money and making me feel guilty for covering a round at The Three Broomsticks. Not to mention the times Gryffindor believed the rumours about me, instead of trusting my word.” His shoulders curled around his ears, remembering the hell that was second year, and blinked back the tears threatening to make an appearance.
Blaise and Theo shared a pained look before wordlessly agreeing to call it a night. Though, whether any of them besides Harry actually got any sleep was another thing entirely.
“Because I could see how much you wanted to kiss me.” Draco’s head jerked up in astonishment and his blush trailed to his exposed chest. Rolling a shoulder in a casual shrug, Harry tore his gaze away from the intoxicating sight of Draco’s torso, and said, “And I wanted to know.”
Shifting uncomfortably at the betrayal in her voice, he stammered, “It’s, uh, a bit more than unhappy, Professor.”
Harry’s lips twitched and Draco snorted until their composure crumbled and they crowed with laughter, burning off the residual unease that came with any discussion of Voldemort. Harry watched the boy he once considered an enemy double over, the sound of his genuine amusement filling up the cavernous room. It was deep and rich when it wasn’t laced with malicious intent, and to finally hear it up close instead of in broken snippets across a crowded hall felt like the beginning of something foundational between them.
Closing the gap between them, Draco said, “Harry, you know I’ll always have your back and support you however you need.”
The waver in the confident tone he knew so well sent a chill down his spine. Swallowing hard, Harry looked at the paper hovering in the air and read the contents, trying not to balk over the sheer volume of his history.
An unexpected rush of warmth flooded him with her easy acceptance of him into their exclusive fold. It sent a rush of endorphins through his anxiety-riddled nervous system and loosened his tongue.
“I didn’t feel safe,” he said, wringing his hands. “At that moment, Professor, I didn’t trust anyone in that room enough to sleep next to them in the dark. After I came down from my panic attack, I left the tower and roamed the castle. I ended up in the kitchens around three in the morning and slept on the floor there overnight.”
Clearing his throat with a blush, Draco slid his hands from Harry’s and rose elegantly to his feet. “I’ll be back in an hour or so. Pansy and the lads will keep you occupied.”
suggesting an alliance with Potter for practicality’s sake and nothing else?” Draco’s fair skin turned scarlet and Severus smirked. “I thought not, though your true motivation matters little. He’s an honorary snake and we take care of our own.”
Throwing her bag strap over her chest, Hermione hissed, “You once said I needed to get my priorities straight, but that statement could more readily be applied to you. Come to me when you’re ready to offer real help instead of wild theories.”
“As your friend, I feel you should tell me why you slept in the kitchens instead of your dorm. It’s only fair since I poured my heart out to you, after all,” Draco said, unable to disguise the worry tugging the corner of his mouth into a subtle frown as he released him.
His whisky glass froze halfway to his lips as something else niggled his brain. “Draco, have any of the Gryffindors come searching for him? Prefects? His former friends? Professor McGonagall?”
Closing the gap between them, Draco traced Harry’s bottom lip with his thumb. “What did you want to know, Harry?”
The Hat wheezed with dusty laughter and the Slytherins smirked appreciatively. “Spoken like a true snake, Mr. Potter! Despite your intellect, Ravenclaw will not suit and while you are indeed loyal and true, Hufflepuff would be unsafe for you. While Gryffindors are courageous and brash, they are also proud and lack tact. Tell me, who came to your aid when you needed it most?”
Harry winced as his aunt’s harsh words through the years echoed through his head. Severus noticed his flinch and scowled.
“Never,” he swore fervently. “I enjoy being the person you trust and I’d never do anything to jeopardize that. I...value it too much.” Licking his lips nervously, Draco breathed, “As I value you. I don’t want to mess things up —”
Tilting his head up to compensate for the inch or two Draco had on him, Harry forgot to breathe for a moment as grey eyes turned dark when he dipped to meet him. His eyelids fell shut when sinewy arms wrapped around his back, and blood pounded in his ears when a puff of hot air fanned across his lips a split second before they touched.
“As to contracts, I suggest we wait for them to reach courting age and decide in their own time,” Narcissa said sensibly. “They might fall out before anything of note transpires.” She paused and smirked knowingly at her husband. “Though I rather doubt that. They are both too obstinate to let go of something they want.”
“Mr. Malfoy, escort our resident celebrity to the Headmaster’s office, lest his adoring fans hold him up,” the man said.
Seamus wheezed between cackles. “Aye, they’ll be bloomin’ for a while, but I'm bettin' they’re more like to be early instead of late after a year apart!”
Rising slowly to his feet, Draco cautiously offered his hand. Déjà vu washed over them at the simple gesture, but this time it was extended in genuine friendship instead of self-assured pride. Shooting him a wobbly smile, Harry grasped it without hesitation and let the taller boy haul him effortlessly to his feet.
“Young Harry is in the kitchens, Master Snape,” she said, sounding far away despite standing right next to them. “He has been there all night.”
Grabbing their things, the quartet met the rest of their friends in the commons where Pansy predictably squealed over his perfect hair and smart uniform. He huffed a laugh as she fawned over him and complimented the others on their handiwork.
Covering his face with his hands, Severus sucked in deep breaths as he fought to control the guilt attempting to drag him under. Draco gaped at his godfather’s quivering shoulders and ragged gasps, wondering what could have garnered such a reaction from him. Turning to his friends, he saw them all wearing similar expressions, clearly at a loss for what to do.
Pausing outside of the second-floor girl’s bathroom, Harry steeled himself for whatever he might find behind the door. An ambush, maybe? It was unlikely Malfoy reopened the Chamber since he wasn’t a Parselmouth; not that it would matter if he did, the only creature that could aid him was long dead. Still, he was a Slytherin through and through and it wouldn’t do to walk into a trap.
“Mr. Potter was absent from breakfast, and I need to speak to him. Have you or any other elves seen him by chance?”
“Alright, boys,” Dumbledore said, startling them from their embrace. “Tonight, Draco, you’ll go to a temporary safe house while we finalize arrangements for a permanent one. We should have everything sorted by tomorrow.”
Severus’ gaze flicked to Harry, inclining his head fractionally, which Harry returned with a smile. None of the students clapped or cheered at the rousing speech, but the magic thrumming in the commons was buoyant and bright, giving away their pride and excitement. Unable to rein in his magic in the charged atmosphere, Harry’s aura rose in greeting and a rush of answering energy slammed into his core.
Krum unclenched his fists and visibly shook off his residual anger. Extending his hand with a grunt, he announced decisively. “Ve vill ‘elp you, ‘Arry Potter.”
“What the hell do you think you’re doing?” Draco growled, pressing his chest against Harry’s heaving shoulders in subtle reassurance to stave off his mounting anxiety. “You can’t just grab people like that! Especially minors. Unhand him immediately.”
Draco slumped in his chair, astounded by Dumbledore’s admission and apparent disinterest in what became of him. If not for Harry’s impressive display and utter disregard for authority while defending him, he feared the man would’ve left him to the mercy of the wolves. His extremities unexpectedly went numb as paralyzing fear coursed through him, imagining all the ways Greyback would ensure he suffered before eviscerating him.
Groaning as his cheeks flamed, Draco buried his face in Harry’s neck. “Shut up,” he groused. “I’m gay and you’re my soulmate. Obviously, I think you’re cute.”
The sentiment went unspoken, but not unsaid. Betrayed by their body language, Harry unconsciously leaned into Draco’s hand, chasing more contact which the blond gave willingly, pressing his palm flush to the centre of his chest.
Nodding curtly, he lowered his gaze and tried to bury the terrifying images flashing through his mind. His friends’ impassive faces as Ron towered over him: the lines of his body poised for violence, large hands balled into fists, the press of the door at his back—nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, no way to escape the incoming blow.
There was this weird butterfly feeling in Harry's stomach, he sort of felt like flying and simultaneously was so nervous he worried he might hurl. The thoughts in his head were racing 100 miles an hour. He didn't know how he got so lucky. He wasn't sure what to say, or if he should say anything at all. He felt an abnormally goofy smile on his face and just couldn't get rid of it. He was so happy and yet so nervous.
The boys gave up on dancing for the day by the time the cd was done playing. They left the room to go to dinner, not having realized how much time had passed till Harry checked a beat up looking watch on his wrist.
They finished practice ten minutes before dinner started, deciding to walk down together instead of parting like they usually did. They entered the Great Hall in a flurry, their hair messy and slightly out of breath from the dancing and walking to dinner. They didn't realize what it looked like they'd been doing, with their robes haphazard and their hair mussed. Both of their faces slightly red.
McGonagall slowly walked to her study and sat down. It was time to figure out who was messing with her students. This was completely unacceptable behavior at Hogwarts.
Harry's face burned brighter as he quickly nodded. He turned and gathered up his stuff, intending to leave before making it awkward again.
He walked slowly into the kitchen and made a sandwich. He should probably eat something, he honestly wasn't hungry. But he didn't want to deal with the fatigue.
The Great Hall was absolutely packed. It was probably at its maximum capacity for people yet somehow it still seemed like there was an.. Emptiness. No one was quite sure what it was but it made them all pull their friends and loved ones in closer, trying to erase the feeling. Even the Durmstrang students noticed, their expressions going grim and looking around for a supposed threat.
He knew his future was bright. He had options and he had time. But the brightest part of his future was always going to be the blonde who was sitting beside him.
"Hi, my name is Ron." His voice was weak and hoarse from disuse. He wasn't sure when the last time he used it was.
Thoughts raced in Harry's head as he supported the wasted Slytherin. Draco was staring at him, his face was for once open and expectant. His light grey eyes studied him, assessing and carrying a suprisingly heavy amount of intensity for his level of intoxication. He was waiting.  He expected an answer, an answer that Harry didn't know how to give.
Draco smirked at Pott-Harry and gently pushed him off so that Draco could stand up and offer Harry a hand. They started walking back to Hogswarts, linking arms, silently daring one another to let go. Another control test, and a curious friendship in the making.
Hermione and Blaise caught Harry as he sagged in their arms, Hermione shrieking in suprise and Blaise using his other hand to pull out his wand and aim at Professor McGonagle who rolled her eyes and quickly disarmed him.
The two were up against a wall in a very flagrant state of affection. Minnie was temporarily suprised how open the two were, especially considering how new this romance was. But they weren't kissing. Just staring. But then they were. And they just went at it.
She pulled back and smiled up at him. Her wide eyes were always so expressful and pure. She never hid anything from him and was never scared to speak her mind. And his for that matter. Ron bent his neck down and on impulse kissed her cheek.
Harry woke up alone. There were no boys and no sound coming from anywhere in the room. It was in the silence that he found a headache waiting for him. A huge, pounding headache. It felt like someone was going at it with a drill.
Draco fought against a smile, there was a hint of understanding between them. Harry would accept Draco for who he was. Harry was the first person who understood.
When the meal was over Draco stood up and eyed Harry rather hesitantly, unsure if they were going to practice for the ball again today or not. Potter however, seemed completely unaware of his existence and stood up, brushing past him silently as he walked down the hall.
It was about a half hour before curfew and Harry just couldn't stop thinking about the war. He knew tonight was going to be a rough one. But could he handle the nightmares tonight? He knew what would help.. But getting it was just embarrassing.
Smiling at the gorgeous blonde, Harry opted to take a couple handfulls of grapes, that would have to do for now. The most important thing was how could Harry get Draco back up to the astronomy tower? Or maybe they could borrow the room of requirements. Either way Harry was determined to have time with his new boyfriend.
"Malfoy, I can't either. I've been practicing since I left the Great Hall." Harry grinned, jokingly punching Draco. Draco felt immensely relieved and rolled his eyes. He didn't know why he had been so nervous about telling him. He forgot that Harry wasn't like some of his Slytherin friends- uptight and snobby. Harry was easy-going and quite relieving if Draco were to be honest. But there was a problem, neither of them could dance. Obviously, they should practice.
It was weird. That was the best way Draco could describe it. The dance was in a couple days, Draco was dating Harry Potter, and it was weird. Not bad, not at all. Just strange. The first day they were together everybody stared at them and whispered to each other. Draco couldn't stop blushing, it wasn't like him to be so flustered about the person he was with.
A determined knock sounds on the door, startling Draco into a sitting position. Potter bursts into the room, not even waiting for an answer. How exactly he got into the common room is beyond Draco but what does he care?
Harry knew something was off. Hermione kept giving him weird glances, Ron was nowhere to be found and Draco kept turning bright red and ran the other direction whenever Harry saw him. Draco of all people. He hightailed from the room through the nearest exit whenever he saw Harry as if he had some sort of disease.Why were they avoiding him?! He sighed and turned on his heel in the dormitory where Hermione gave him yet ANOTHER look. The kind of look that set him on edge like she was waiting for him to explode or something.
Harry blushed bright red and nodded. This was a start. A good one. Something new they could build off of.
Ron Weasley wouldn't call himself oblivious. In fact, if you asked him, he would say he was quite perceptive. He just happened to be perceptive more when it was pointed out then on his own time. He was a listener! That's it.
When 3:50 came, Harry shot up, changed into his non-school day wear and raced down to the Great hall. He arrived exactly at 3:59 and Malfoy arrived one minute later. Of course he had to be exactly on time. Bloody prick. But.. He had still came. He called Harry's bluff as much as Harry had called his. With a forced smile at one another, they quietly walked down to where the teachers were waiting to shoo the remaining students off to Hogsmead.
Draco however was confused. Last night was a blur. He remembered drinking and drinking everything after that was fuzzy.
He still can't believe it. He stares at Potters head, at his shoulders rising and falling evenly. As his words echo in Draco's mind. Maybe reading to Harry wasn't so embarrassing after all. And if Potter was really talking about needing 'The Tales of Beedle, The Bard ' to keep the nightmares away, it seems to have worked. He looks peaceful at least.
Harry watched them all in amusement, still curious why they were so worked up but his amusement quickly turned to dread as Seamus explained between laughs "Harry.. Did you know.. That you talk.... In your sleep?!" Then all four stopped laughing and deadpanned stared at Harry, in unison, they moaned "Oh Dracoooooo!!!" And lost it again.
Draco was getting impatient and a little anxious. Its time for the truth to come out. It had been weighing down on him for awhile and he thought it was time for Harry to know. When the common room door opened, Draco could feel the small ball of dread increase in his stomach. He couldn't do this! Not now. Maybe not ever. He could fake it. He would get away with that.. Right?
They arrived at the Great Hall slightly out of breath from rushing to dinner and speed walked to the table, eager to eat. Not even caring that they were causing a scene or that dinner had already started. Hermione was once again giving them a look and smiling like she knew some big secret. Blaise noticed her staring at them and pinched her side. She let out a little shriek and punched him on the arm.
Harry was losing time. He wasn't sure what was going on, or maybe he was going insane? Either way things were missing from his memory. He knew he went on an errand for McGonagall but when he tried to think more about it, a fog clouded his mind and he was left in a state of major confusion.
