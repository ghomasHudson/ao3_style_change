The corner of Draco’s mouth turned up a bit. ‘All right.’ He turned his gaze to the two journals in front of himself and produced his wand from a pocket.
They turn simultaneously to where Goyle stands three doors down. He looks around forlornly, lost without Malfoy to guide him, and then scrubs at a patch of sauce that has spilled down his front. His eyes flit up guiltily, trying to see if anyone has caught him.
“You’re deliberating missing my point—”
When Harry leaves the gray room the next morning, he’s not sure he’s slept at all. Any dip into sleep was brief and unsettled, and now, in the light of early morning, his entire body feels heavy with exhaustion. Even the mirror is worried at the sight of him.
“No problem.”
Hermione is watching him carefully. Her deep brown eyes squint in the setting sun, and Harry’s are sore from the glare, but even with that he can see the caution in the way she watches him. The way she’s handling him with care, sensing fragility, even though it was her who’d been tortured and her who had
So he has to try. For them, he has to try.
“Leave it, Ron,” Harry mutters, placing a hand on his shoulder. Ron steps back reluctantly but continues to glare.
,” Ron snaps. Ginny just rolls her eyes and brushes past Harry on her way out of the Burrow. They make eye contact as she does, and Harry can feel his grin die a bit.
And now the letters from Hogwarts, the eighth and final ones, have arrived. The return to Hogwarts looms only a week away, carefully tucked into a distant corner in Harry’s mind.
Ginny laughs. “Honestly, Hermione, I expected better from you.”
A week after the Hogwarts letters arrive, he starts awake again, gut dropping from the sensation of once more witnessing Dumbledore’s plunge from the Astronomy Tower. Harry wrestles with the knot in his heaving chest before homing in on Ron’s snores from across the room. He tries to even his breaths to match Ron’s, and after a moment, the knot in his chest loosens enough to relax.
“Maybe they’ve hired two new professors,” Hermione says doubtfully, her eyes scanning the table. Her brow furrows. “But where’s—”
McGonagall finishes the list and begins to lead them toward the east wing of the sixth floor, cutting off Harry’s view of Malfoy’s face. He tries not to feel frustrated by this. Ron trails in stunned silence beside Harry and Hermione. The trio falls behind the rest of the group, separating easily in the others’ distraction.
, he reasons, just what Malfoy was doing—and he had good reason to be. He was right in sixth year. That time, Malfoy was a Death Eater who caused the death of Dumbledore and let a steady stream of other Death Eaters into the castle. Maybe Ron is right this year.
“You poor dear,” the mirror coos, making Harry jump. “You look positively dreadful.”
It just never happened. That stasis had lulled Harry in, and the longer he took refuge in it, the less he wanted to disturb it. The less he wanted to kiss Ginny. The less he wanted to consider what being with her would be like.
Harry leaves Ron to grapple with Malfoy and makes his way to Goyle. The east wing of the sixth floor is comprised of a long stretch of doorways, each engraved with a different creature. Harry’s and Goyle’s, upon closer inspection, is engraved with dozens of coiling and uncoiling snakes. He wonders if they would understand him if he spoke Parseltongue, and then is struck by the absurd hilarity of someone finding him alone in the hallway, speaking to his door. Maybe he really has gone round the bend.
“Er, looks like it,” Harry winces sympathetically. Even Hermione looks a bit sorry.
-----
“I’m done, dear! Can’t you see I’m done?”
Harry keeps his eyes trained on the eggs, grown rubbery and cold in his neglect, so he can pretend she didn’t direct that last part toward him. “Besides, it was dark—maybe he was in his bed the whole time and you didn’t see. Maybe you dreamt the whole thing. And honestly, Ron, just because
Of the three of them, Hermione seems the most well-rested, though of course she almost always looks like that. Her unending energy is a marvel, really, as much as it can be irritating.
. Fascinating read, this is. Did you know muggles have to
Voldemort’s deformed hands, at once child and corpse-like, close around Harry’s throat like a vice.
Two four-post beds lie on either side of the room, one to the left of a large, iron-framed widow and the other shrouded in shadows across from it. Goyle heads immediately toward the darker bed and begins digging through his trunk. Upon second glance, Harry notices his own trunk sitting beside the window bed.
“If you had been listening, Weasley, you would know. You need to place your hand on the door beside mine, or else the wards won’t admit you. Do you truly need me to explain first-year knowledge of wards to you?”
And then the first nightmare came. And then the next. And then the next, and the next, over and over again, like a highlight reel of all of Harry’s worst moments and fears.
That was the last time Harry tried sleeping there.
“What? It’s not my fault that Harry doesn’t want—” he silences himself at another glare from Hermione, then says to Harry: “Sorry, mate. Didn’t mean to say it was your fault, either.”
The tomatoes are coming in nicely. Harry is bent over their blooming green buds, brushing dirt off his jeans and t-shirt, when Hermione finds him. He knows immediately that it’s her, brown toes peeking over pale sandal straps; ever since her month in Australia, working to regain her parents’ memories, she’s come back tanned and sandal-clad. He supposes she’s earned the right to relax a bit.
“How is Luna?” Harry latches hastily onto the change in subject matter. Truthfully, he knows how Luna is—she’s been owling him regularly from her travels through the wizarding region of Nepal. He’s not sure what prompted her to keep him in the loop about her searches for gravity-resistant tigers, but he’s quietly grateful for the kind, if batty, human contact she’s offered.
He draws closer and closer and Harry is repulsed, Harry wants to move, to run, but he can’t. He is frozen as Voldemort draws nearer and Harry doesn’t want it, doesn’t want to be touched, can’t stand to be touched, don’t touch, don’t touch, don’t touch—
“Mistakes? They’ve made some bloody big mistakes, Hermione!” Ron’s fists clench at his sides. Harry wonders if he’s thinking about what those mistakes cost, or
At breakfast, he tries desperately not to fall asleep into his eggs and toast. He tries to remember to eat them, too, so Hermione won’t shoot him that fretful, knowing look in her dark brown eyes. Next to him, Ron tries to rant about Draco through mouthfuls of hash browns.
By the time Hermione returns down the stairs with a yawning Ron in tow, Mrs. Weasley has got the luggage and floo powder ready in the living room, and Harry has worked his way through a cup of tea and a slice of toast.
“Now, I will read the assignments one by one, and then you will be led to your new dormitories. Michael Corner and Neville Longbottom…”
?” Ginny says. She looks amused. “You can stop whinging now.”
“Well?” she presses. “Any broken hearts you’ve abandoned in the name of education, Harry? Don’t be shy.”
“Thanks.”
say anything about my parents. Not when yours are a pair of murderers.”
cauldron.”).  Even Mrs. Weasley seems a bit lost to be early for once. It’s a sudden reminder that what once was a horde of late, forgetful children is now whittled down to just the four of them. No one seems to know quite what to do.
Harry wishes they hadn’t been so early. More and more people continue to throng in—hordes of eager first-years gawping at him from around their parents, clumps of upper-years growing hushed and awed as he walks by, and—to his great distress—several flashes of cameras burning his retinas. The growing crowd silences and parts for his group as they walk, and urgent whispers commence the second he passes. It almost reminds him of his second year, when everyone thought he was the heir of Slytherin, except this time it is pure and unadulterated worship, not suspicion, and this time is a thousand times worse. The knot in his chest tightens painfully in the press of the crowd, and he trains his eyes on the graying fire of Mrs. Weasley’s hair.
Ron goes a little pink in the face, the way he does whenever someone offers him something. Harry can see his face twist a bit as he weighs his pride against angering Hermione. His mouth snaps shut.
Draco grunted with a pained expression. ‘Sit with me. Hold my hand.’
“A little,” Draco answered. If it were all healthy skin, his body would’ve likely reacted to the touch much more embarrassingly.
“Er, for Longbottom.” It seemed like Potter didn’t need it.
Harry tucked his chin in, and danced close—rocking and contracting in time to the music. Draco could feel the heat off his body, the warm breath ghosting over his cheek.
Her eyes widened in response.
“Um. Yeah. Love notes.” He blushed and winced immediately. It was still a bit embarrassing to say out loud.
Harry sucked in a breath, and immediately returned to sucking on Draco’s neck with increased fervour, nibbling on Draco’s earlobe, and kissing behind his ear. All while pausing here and there to have a peek at Draco’s lap.
Draco’s kneejerk reaction was to narrow his eyes. “What are you getting at?”
Draco huffed a laugh. ‘
“Hoo.”
'What about you two, how long have you been friends?'
“Movie room?” Draco echoed, surprised.
‘You’re falling asleep. We should go inside.’
‘To what?!’
-ed an empty classroom nearby, and held the door open with a bitter, ‘After you.’
“Yeah.”
'Right.' Harry blinked at him like he'd only just realised that Draco was at work. 'Sorry, yeah, I'll just … try you later,' he said, getting quieter the more he spoke. Harry turned towards the door and reached out for the handle. Something made him pause, because he curled his fingers into a fist, and turned right back around.
Well, two could play at that, whatever it was.
Draco watched it all in awe. “You’re not supposed to... just catch it on fire.”
“No,” Ginny interrupted, frowning at the paper. “I didn’t write this.”
He’ll have to try to pretend he’d never send it, he supposed. And, if it was bad, he didn’t even have to send it, he realised. That took a little pressure off.
about Harry James Potter.
“Merlin—”
‘Yes, but it is unusual to receive gifts, isn’t it, sir?’
Draco sucked in a breath, and reached out for Harry's ankle (the closest body part to him). 'Harry—'
He cleared his throat. “Yes, and go … puke-yellow. Er, let’s find our seats.”
Friends. Of course. Harry released a breath he didn’t realise he’d been holding. Draco’s response filled his head like words circling round a drain. When they sunk in, he gave a little shake to his head, and swallowed. ‘Ah. Like a mobile phone.’
He felt a furious blush coming on, and turned away to face the wall. Harry seemed to think nothing of that, moving over to his corner of the room. Draco was definitely not going to look. Instead he inspected the green wallpaper, and the little corner at the bottom of the seam, that’d got itself un-stuck. Wallpaper was nice, sure. Because of the wide variety of patterns. But paint was just tidier over time, wasn’t it? Although... paint could chip, come to think of it.
Draco eyed him warily. ‘I should get us some supper.’
“Since always, I suppose.”
He glanced up again at Malfoy there. Just sitting at the Hufflepuff table, with no idea of what Harry was thinking.
Draco exhaled slow. 'Just a bit of exercise.'
Their movements sped up—became more frantic.
Harry pulled back and just looked at her. The pretty freckles on her face, her kind eyes. He planted a smacking kiss on her cheek.
Draco exhaled. Would he? Or would he retreat and try to pretend nothing was wrong—as had been his instinct for so long? Well... it was a choice, in the end, wasn’t it? “Yes, I promise I’ll talk to you.”
Harry smiled, maybe a little sadly. “Yeah.” He took a sip of wine.
Harry took another gulp of cocoa, smiling against the mug’s rim.
God. Draco was on fire, he could feel his blood pumping—
He exhaled a deep breath, glad at the change of topic. “Yes. Let’s.”
‘Did you bring it with you?’ she asked, sitting up straighter in her chair, looking around to see if there were just a diary laying around, perhaps near his shoes.
His breaths sped up, as he felt a gentle hand on his back.
Draco stiffened. So, it was finally happening then, Draco thought to himself. They were going to have sex for the first time. He was going to have sex with his beautiful, perfect wife. His best friend.
‘Mm,’ Potter uttered, looking up at the stars, ‘I think we can still do magic in space.’
The owl crunched it, and flew off again, without further comment.
Draco hummed his acknowledgment. Harry saw him take another drink of wine out of the corner of his eye.
Potter turned his head, and Draco followed where he was looking. It was Ronald Weasley... The man was shooting significant looks at Potter.
Harry led them out of the castle, and they walked in silence, side by side, on the lawn towards the lake. Harry kept hitting his right palm against his left fist, in a nervous gesture. He didn’t know what to say.
“What was all that ruckus?” she asked him.
A knock came at the door, bringing him out of his thoughts. That was odd—it couldn’t be much past 9am, and they weren’t expecting anyone.
‘Now I kiss you,’ Harry murmured, leaning in, as Draco moved his head back out of reach.
Harry couldn’t help but smile as he watched.
She laughed breathily. ‘You were just thinking dirty thoughts about Malfoy,’ she said low enough to not be overheard.
This time, Malfoy broke away from the kiss. “This isn’t my room.”
He took a step closer. ‘Who else knows I’m here? Does the Prophet know?’ His eyes showed a dangerous intensity.
‘Why does Santa Claus have such a big sack?’
‘Do we have to break up?’ Harry asked into Draco’s chest, and his whole upper body clenched inwards at the thought. They needed to talk about this, though, even though it was painful. This was important.
He ate in silence, thankfully the elderly couple didn’t try to strike up any more conversation. He tried to keep his thoughts away from self-pity, away from loneliness. Thinking about going outside again cheered him up a bit.
He glanced at Harry. ‘It’ll only chime if you close it.’
So—slowly—Draco turned the page. Glancing from the ghost, and then down at the blank parchment. Well. This was rather odd, wasn’t it?
Malfoy nodded, and Parkinson spun around, gliding away.
Harry walked to his kitchen, feeling off about the whole situation already. He hadn’t thought sex was an issue until now. Though: he was pretty sure there was a lot more to it than just sex.
Nothing had prepared Harry for how this felt.
“But I was supposed to be with Ron,” he said, loud enough for Draco to make out.
She sighed. ‘Yes, I
‘I … see ...' Potter’s brow furrowed.
‘Malfoy?’ Moira asked thoughtfully. ‘You call each other by your family names?’
Draco arranged his three glasses between his knees, and twisted around to hold Harry closer, closer to himself.
“Harry? Can I talk to you?”
. Was there a chance he wouldn't? 'Yes, I want you to. Did you have other plans?'
Just a few notes:
Harry’s heartrate picked up. Not in a panicky way this time, though.
But Draco left anyway.
“Agreed,” he murmured into her hair, holding her like he’ll never let her go, because he won’t. Because he didn’t know any other way to deal with that evening. Because of the rush of grief, of fear, threatening to overcome.
Harry felt himself lean back against the door; he was knackered. He could probably fall asleep where he stood.
Their tongues flicked out. Wet. Soft. Warmth. Hot breath. Oh, the taste of him. Sweet and warm.
And then, Draco kissed him.
. I don't want to have my entire meal with you sitting silently, judging my reactions.'
Draco tore his eyes from Harry's back and found Ruben leaning forward, fixing him with a glare.
Draco decided not to comment further, and moved out of Harry's line of sight again—back to the closet. He tossed his button-up into the hamper, and grabbed a clean t-shirt from the shelf inside the closet, pulling it on.
And the smell—the smell might have been the best part.
Alcohol was
Harry showed him, a little screen on the back showed the photograph.
‘Oh! No.
There came a banging on the door, Draco jumped.
'Joni Mitchell wrote her album
‘All right, mate?’ Ron asked absentmindedly.
She gave him a more thorough once-over, and grinned. She grabbed his wrist, and pulled him forward. And the crowd was just … parting for her.
Hermione sighed, and then smiled. ‘So, tell us about your weekend, Harry.’
'Oh?'
Potter groaned again, throwing an arm over his eyes to hide them. “I was so clingy with you and annoying. Just... inserting myself in your space like that.”
And then Harry was coming, in hot bitter bursts into Draco’s mouth. And Draco swallowed it as it came, lapping at it with abandon, just as he came into Harry’s mouth.
And so it went. Malfoy ignored him. Avoided him. Refused to speak to or acknowledge him in any capacity. It was like Harry was invisible.
‘Oh, yeah,’ Harry murmured. ‘Well …’ He licked his lips. ‘There are ways I could show that I truly want this.’
“Oh?”
Harry gritted his teeth. ‘He’s not—’
“Stop. How about we agree to stop blaming ourselves, or putting ourselves down. Right here, right now. I love you—do you love me?”
‘I should go,’ Draco said.
Malfoy nodded. ‘So do it.’
‘Brilliant,’ he said. And he meant it. ‘What do you feel like? Had any cravings lately?’ Harry walked over to the fridge to look inside. He was pretty well-stocked. The grocery delivery came just the other day.
‘Oh, ah, well, I guess tomorrow.’ He’d done everything he’d originally planned, and more. Plus, he’d already bothered Potter enough.
Harry tried to smile. He knew he must look very, very out of place in his corduroy trousers and navy blazer. Professor clothes, Ron called them. ‘Harry Potter … Er, I was looking to see Draco Malfoy?’
Draco laughed. “Yes.”
Harry took a step forward. His mouth was slightly open, but he wasn't saying anything. Draco could see the smallest hint of pink tongue there.
Draco turned to the white screen behind himself, and flicked the little plastic button that he held in his palm—a bit of simple Muggle technology. He could handle one button.
The paper climbed staircases, hugging the edges. A student kicked it, sending it flying. Thankfully in the correct direction.
‘Harry …’ Draco said, looking into Harry’s eyes pointedly.
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s shoulders. “Sorry,” he mumbled, and leaned in to press their mouths together.
‘No, not since dinner. And call me Harry.’ Harry closed his eyes now.
She nodded curtly.
Draco frowned. “Whatever. I’ve told you all there is to know, then.”
Ron, on the other hand, was avoiding the subject of Malfoy at all costs.
Draco sighed and rubbed his eyes. Then, he found himself eyeing the telly. He’d never used one before, and wasn’t sure if he could operate it properly, but it could be interesting to try.
Pansy was pretty. More than pretty. She had an edge to her that was dangerous and exciting. Like he could cut himself on her ribs and bleed, and not even mind. She belonged in a film noir, perched on the side of a desk with long legs and shining black hair. He could be the detective, and her: the stereotypical woman in distress. She’d lick her lips slowly, she’d run a hand over his pantleg, up to his crotch.
“Can I see?” she asked.
Harry let out a soft laugh.
‘I’ll go with you. To France,’ he found himself saying.
“I hope you don’t take this the wrong way, but, you do seem... sensitive.” Potter leaned back in his chair to worry his bottom lip with his teeth, watching Draco.
Malfoy shot him a look. ‘Eloquent. Come on.’ He waved to a spot beside his bed.
Okay, maybe Harry was being a bit rude. He genuinely liked it, he did. It just shocked him, is all. He thought he’d had Malfoy pegged—
“Oh, uh, doesn’t matter.”
. Honey-sweet and chewy, just a little bit tart.
Draco licked at his bottom lip again. ‘Is it too forced to just kiss you? Or should we go on a date first?’
Draco's fingers were slow—and thorough. And it gave Harry goosebumps up the back of his arms. No one had ever done this for him, it was like he was being cared for …
“Well, Harry,” Hermione said, speaking slowly—carefully. “It’s dangerous to compare yourself to others. The way a relationship looks on the outside, is not always how it is behind closed doors. And a marriage takes a lot of hard work—it isn’t supposed to be easy. But I suspect you know all that anyhow.”
Draco found himself blinking again, and whispered, “...My cock?”
It made Harry's heart lurch as he kissed back. It was so gentle, he could probably melt right there and then.
As promised, Ruben produced five shots for the lot of them.
And then there they were—back at the first true home Harry had ever known. It even smelled the same (but did he expect any different?). They all settled into the Great Hall, taking up their usual seats at their usual tables. The Sorting Ceremony proceeded as it always had—with so many new, bright-eyed faces. They were young and hopeful and excited to learn about magic. It was … nostalgic. And nice.
'Not in the least.'
“You should have moved on!” The Hufflepuff said, with tears streaming down her reddened face.
He had acknowledged his feelings. He had raised questions that he didn’t have answers to. Yet.
‘Hello. How’s quarantine life treating you?’ Harry asked.
He broke away from Harry’s cock, just for a moment, just to warn, “I’m going to come.”
Closer to the door, Malfoy’s voice came out clearer. “No,
Surely if it were a prank, Harry wouldn’t kiss Draco in front of the entire common room—could it be … real?
“Yeah,” Harry said, without even pausing to think about it.
He shook his head in an attempt to clear it.
‘Oh. I see. Anything interesting yet?’
Potter laughed, darting glances from his plate and over to Draco and back. “But you like real human men too, yeah?”
from the book.
He didn’t dare look back. He just held it, as if it were perfectly normal for them, even though his heart was pounding hard in his chest.
A laugh burst out of Draco. Potter was just so … so ...
‘It’s your idea—’
He trembled in bed, his mind screaming at him that it might be true. Malfoy’s wounds could be reopening—they had no idea of what that spell truly did, after all. Malfoy could be dying, alone, at that very moment. Harry could still be
‘Ah,’ Draco said, starring at Harry’s mouth, now. ‘Well that’s good, since I’ve just accepted a job at Belford Hospital.’
“Okay, so, the Fat Lady was wrong?” Harry asked, staring at the clasped hands on his lap.
Malfoy produced a piece of chalk from his pocket and kneeled down. He busied himself drawing complex shapes right onto the floor. He checked over his work, and then drew a large circle, more than encompassing the symbols. It was large enough to seat five people inside. “Sit beside me.” He patted a spot to his left.
“So...” Potter started. “Is there anything you want to do today? Like swim or go on a boat or something? Go on a walk? Kick a ball around? Play a board game?”
The hand had dropped awkwardly to Draco’s side. His eyelids lowered and his mouth pressed into a firm line. Then, Draco had said, ‘Thank you.’
Draco nodded curtly, though he didn’t really want to leave Harry so soon.
‘Mmhmm.’ Draco didn’t look put off by the touching. He was smiling a bit. His cheeks were a bit pink though.
“Hello … Mei. Ah, can I speak with you?”
Pansy leaned closer so that she wouldn’t be overheard. “Draco, don’t isolate yourself.”
“No it isn’t!”
Harry looked up at him, but he seemed to be more interested in the crystals and gems on Luna’s bedside table. “No?”
“Why are you single? Why aren’t you married to Ginevra Weasley, or someone like her, and have three charming biracial, wild-haired and freckled children by now?”
“No!” Harry rushed to say. Jesus, he just asked about a walk. “Hang on, are we—? Er … you haven’t exactly told me ‘yes’, yet. But I just thought we could, like, talk ...”
Harry sighed. ‘That’s exactly what I don’t want.’
'Well … thank you.'
physically dangerous." Minerva cleared her throat. "But I would advise against picking up any mysterious items, without first knowing what they may do, in the future.” She looked at him pointedly, and interlaced her fingers on the desk. “It is a rare magical pearl from Hyderabad,” she added, frowning down at the sphere wrapped in cloth sat on her desk. “A city in South India.”
Hermione made to sit up but Harry stopped her. “Sorry, don’t get up. It’s nothing, really.”
His body shook … perhaps from having stood so long in cold, wet clothes. Or perhaps from the swirling emotions within himself, that he was trying very hard to ignore.
‘Well … yes,’ Harry answered weakly.
This was
They were only walking in opposite directions down the hall. It was perfectly normal for a professor to acknowledge another professor when they ran into each other.
“Didn’t that last one have something to do with a pickled toad?” she asked, wrinkling her nose. “Gross. As if I’d ever write something like that. I’m a bit offended you’d thought it was me.”
It was still altogether too hot out, with hardly a cloud in the sky. He felt uncomfortable, and it wasn't just the weather. Nervous, excitable first years were buzzing around him, casting Harry shy, awestruck glances that he was trying to ignore. He tried staring at the train instead.
Harry watched Malfoy, with legs swinging up on that desk, and a thoughtful expression on his face. If only Ron and Hermione could see him like this, then they’d know what Harry knew, that Malfoy was not terribly
Fuck.
A breathy laugh. 'Fuck, yeah.' Draco moved in closer, and ran his hand down Harry's wet lower back, and cupped his arse cheek. 'You've a fantastic arse,' he murmured, leaning in to kiss at Harry's jaw.
‘Hmm?’ Harry kept staring at Draco, silently daring him to look again, so he could communicate something with his body language. He didn’t know what exactly, just something that’d make Draco know to talk to him.
This was the boy who danced in the middle of the Great Hall with Parvati Patil, and the man who danced with him at red-tinged gay club in Ibiza Town.
It was decidedly better than all of them laughing at him, anyhow.
Weasley held the bag of huge marshmallows open for them both to take a couple, then he turned to move on to other people.
Malfoy looked down, and realised what he’d done. He exhaled hard, evidently disappointed in himself. He brought his head back up and smiled softly at Mrs Weasley. “Yes, I’d love that.”
So, Harry filled Neville in on all the happenings he’d missed.
He licked his bottom lip. “Harry Potter...” Merlin, what was he doing? “It would be very difficult to hate you.”
But, well … Harry wished he’d never known. Just … never known.
‘It’s a deal,’ Harry said.
And Potter seemed to stiffen, his mouth pinched, his chest rose and fell like he’d had to take a deep breath.
'You love me,' Harry echoed, seemingly from somewhere far off.
“I’ve long ago accepted that my actions after sixteen made it impossible to have anything I wanted age fifteen and under. In the years since, I’ve had to adjust my … life expectations.”
"Yes."
Draco looked around, seeing the island in a new, painful light.
Draco had his own glass of wine in hand, that he swirled around leisurely, looking back at Harry with relaxation and contentment written all over his face.
Harry leaned against the table, "Is your uncle around? He gave me something that I really need to talk to him about."
Draco pauses for a moment, taking in the view.
Draco walked behind the cat, nearly slipping on the last step from a puddle. He had to think quick and grab a jutted out piece of rock to keep from falling. The panther looked at Draco, amusement dancing in his eyes.
"I was thinking," McGonagall spoke, "That maybe the student who had missed on their education during the war could come back and finish up."
Harry turned his head into Draco's neck and sighed. Draco tried not to think about it. He actually tried not to think about anything pleasant in that moment, for fear of what his body would do.
"Oh my god.." He grabbed Draco's shoulder and shook them hard, "Draco! Wake up!"
"It's the panther, sir." Thomas supplied as he quickly lead Draco towards the enchanted rooms. "Maybelle was making final passes and she couldn't sense him in the room at all so her and David went in, with guards watching of course, but as soon as they stepped in every light in the room went off and the guards dropped down unconscious and the door to the room locked itself. We haven't been able to get in or to get word from May nor David."
Everything went smoothly the rest of potions. Harry kept his heart somewhat in check and was able to brew a decent potion, mainly from Draco constantly pointing out what he was doing wrong.
"Not when your family is at risk. Not when the people you love the most could
"They really used to do that to you?"
"How was that a try? I clearly got a rise out, didn't I?"
Hampton swallowed thickly, "This ritual.. is it just to keep the island beautiful or is there something larger at stake?"
Pansy snorted, "He doesn't but if Draco really doesn't want something than he would do everything he can to ignore it and push it away, even if it killed him."
"Would you mind.. oh I don't know,
When the door shut behind him, Harry thought for a moment about calling Hermione. Maybe she could help some how.
Draco looked down at Harry, "For what it's worth, I'm extremely sorry about everything I said. Especially to Hagrid and Hermione."
"To find out which one is strong enough to do the spell and be the sacrifice." Hampton recalled.
"He didn't know I had it. I found it with the other textbooks in the classroom. I had lost my book so Slughorn let me borrow one."
"There is a pier of some sort on the other side of the island. I think they have a fun fair, too. Would you wanna do that today?"
Granger huffed. "It has nothing to do with Ron - and don't call him that." She turned her Marguise cut wedding ring back and forth on her finger. "Of course I can distance myself from.. personal issues while working, Draco. I know you are unfamiliar with the concept but some of us know how to be professional."
Another silence found them, but this one was a nice kind.
"But please," Malfoy pleaded, "Please I need your help. I have to stop this." He sounded close to tears, "Please."
. These days, from what I have gathered, it's unheard of. With the reactions you are having towards him, the need to take care of him, he would have to be at least half-breed or more to pull this strong of a connection. Anything less than that wouldn't cause the.. electric feeling you get around him, at least not to the intensity you are describing."
now?"
"Oh, shit,"
going through his skull.
Draco smiled at him, "Thank you, you were incredible too."
Letting out a deep breath, he let all his thoughts slip away. Instead, he focused on his steps, looking around at the beautiful surroundings. He smiled as he felt the heat of the morning sun and the soft breeze that seemed to be permanently blowing on the island on his skin.
story."
The heat radiating off of it felt the same as putting your hand over an actual fire.
Harry looked around himself at the smiling faces of his former-classmates (which, technically they aren't exactly
"Who's the new pet, Draco?" Pansy Parkinson asked as Draco walked up to the small rustic table she sat at, pulling out a seat and sitting across from his childhood friend and Pansy's boyfriend of four years, Blaise Zabini.
The boy removed his robe and dropped it on the far right bed, "Mind if I call this one?"
Harry let out a slow breath, "Draco doesn't.. he doesn't want me.. he just feels pulled because of.. because.."
"If I have to hear Astoria go on about one more bloody boring bloke I will actually
The moment he looked up, Harry stopped breathing for the twelfth time in the past 24 hours. Sitting on a bar stool, with his legs dangling loosely, sat Malfoy looking as if he was on top of the world. The song began slowly but all Harry could focus on was how the light made Malfoy's hair and smile shine even brighter.
Harry smiled at the door Draco went through, "Yeah he is."
his glasses from here.
A low rumbling could be heard from a distance.
Granger walked away giggling as Draco stared at the empty space in the door quietly seething.
Looking out of the small café's window, Hampton let out a deep sigh, wishing that Founder meetings didn't have to always take place in the dead of night.
Kyle bit his lip, hiding a smile, "Thank you. If you don't mind me asking, what are your plans now that your shows are over?"
“It’s gonna be okay.. I’ll make sure you’ll be okay..” he kept whispering over and over again.
He picked up his phone, pressing Hermione's name, hoping she will pick up in spite of how late it was over there.
"Professor, If Mal- if Draco says he can't take the potion, he shouldn't be forced to."
Stepping in, he had to take a moment before his eyes fully adjusted from the bright, sunny day to the dim lights in the store. It was much bigger on the inside than it looked on the out. There was a pine wood circular desk right at the entrance, and a tall lady that reminded him of a much older Madame Pomfrey sat behind what looked like a muggle computer and a younger girl stood beside her scanning books with her wand. Pass the desk, were at least twenty rows of shelves, with what looked like even more shelves the further you went into the store. There was also small rooms on the left hand side, most of them left open but two with closed doors with an "
By the time Harry got down to breakfast, his mind had made up more questions than even Rita Skeeter could possibly ask, and he was so hungry he could have eaten a whole Basilisk. Just to prove his case, he had third helpings of toast and eggs.
"You see I went to visit Ol' Howler and the strangest thing had happened. I was just wondering if there is some sort of magic found in the tree, at least, you know, from what legends say. Do they ever mention any sort of.. dark magic?"
Draco to talk to him? He should of pushed harder, especially after knowing what could happen to Veela's without their mates. He should have tried harder. Why didn't he try harder?
More often than not, Harry would find his gaze drift off towards Malfoy. If Harry thought his extreme change of appearance was peculiar, his attitude and personality switch was even more so. The blue-haired boy sat off by a bookshelf next to a fire place with his former-Slytherin friends, Pansy and Blaise. From the corner of his eye, Harry would watch as Malfoy smiling broadly at his friends, sometimes even laughing with the most open expression Harry had ever seen on the boy. It was the most bizarre thing he has seen in a while. And to make things even more bizarre, the sight was sending tingles down his arms. Harry decided to ignore that fact.
. I like you Draco. Not just as a friend. If you wouldn't have pushed me away all those times, you would have seen that."
"That's exactly what I mean, Potter."
"Oh really?"
Whatever Harry had been expecting when he was told that the function Draco was performing at was a family reunion, it defiantly wasn't this.
While he knows his friends would allows love him not matter what, he couldn’t help but fear that they would make him choose between them or Draco. Through the years, even after the war, their hatred for anything remotely Malfoy seemed to become more intense. He understood why completely. Draco was an ass all of school. He was down right
. Harry answered with an even softer goodnight.
Harry lightly slapped his cheek, he moved his hand down the grab the back of Draco's neck, playing with the soft hairs at the nape, "You are hilarious, Draco Malfoy. No, but I was thinking after the performance, we can go out to the carnival. We didn't get a chance to earlier with everything that had happened."
Harry stood stalk still. He wasn't sure which part he was more flushed by: Draco calling him Harry, Draco wanting to pay for his food, or the intense tingles that where happening where Draco's hand was touching.
Draco grabbed it lightly in his hand, covering the blistered side gently. He looked around to make sure no one was watching before whispering a quick healing charm.
Harry leaned back against Draco's chest, "I am never going to get just one normal week, am I?"
The backstage door opened, voices that were once muffled bounced off of the hallway's walls.
When Harry decided to befriend Malfoy it was mainly McGonagal's doing.
"Your neck looks weird like that."
"What was it exactly, that he gave you?" George had turned to stare directly at Harry.
After a few seconds, he decided to voice his question, "Hey, Harry, how did you know about this place?"
Malfoy blushed slightly, looking down at the floor.
*****
Draco shrugged, his shoulder lightly rubbing Harry's, "I do but since the war it's not the same. Mother shut herself off and stopped talking to majority of her friends and family, me included most of the time. Father is in Azkaban were I hope he will stay till the day he dies. I talked to Pansy almost everyday and Blaise is there if I need him but it's not the same. None of us have heard from Gregory since he left. Apparently him and Crabbe were much closer than we thought."
Harry, however, soothed him, "We wanted to." There had been some debate, to be honest, but after Lucius had offered to Hermione to copy books from his library for the 'studious' redhead, they had agreed that this was the right thing to do. The past was in the past. It was time for a new beginning.
Grinning, Harry revealed, "I am sure you are right about Quidditch games, but the Harpies are notoriously secretive about their try-outs and Kingsley's niece has been vying for a position for the last two years. She has outright forbidden him from putting his weight behind her. But with official tickets and a little Polyjuice, he, his sister and her husband can attend."
"Yes, Master?"
Andromeda seemed to fight with herself before suggesting, "Have you thought about helping Cissy? I know it's not something you would choose for yourself. Her chances of success are rather low. But helping squibs is a good cause and indeed a challenge."
"Sorry," he mumbled on instinct, but then shook himself out of it. "No! You know what, I won't apologise! We have been fucking searching for all of you for close to three fucking months! And here you are. Happy and carefree! Hiding under the damn British Library in a part of the building that should not even exist! Nobody seems coerced or strained. Instead, all of you are rolling your eyes at us as if being found is a bloody every-day occurrence to you!"
"Shouting at her, I imagine."
Then, everyone returned to their meal. During dessert, where Lucius and Narcissa enjoyed a delicious cherry pie, and Draco and Harry an assortment of fresh cheeses, the raven-haired wondered, "Draco, is it possible that we have mice in the attic? I think I heard some tripling for the last few nights."
With a soft smile, Harry nodded in agreement. "He offered to spare you three times. But when you remained stubborn, he killed you. Then he tried to kill me."
Dreading number two, because this was an entirely sensible request, Lucius nodded, “Yes, my Lord.”
All four actually, since all of a sudden, memories that were not his, rose to the surface of Draco's mind. "It weighted you down … like lead."
--O-O--
Trying to find a way around the constriction Draco had placed on him, the elf shared, “After your quarrel with Mister Malfoy, Mistress and the young Master were quite concerned. Kreacher served dinner, but they barely ate before retiring early.”
Studying his godson for a moment, Severus then ordered in a tone that brokered no argument, "Get up. Take a shower. Shave and brush your teeth. I'm expecting you in twenty minutes in the kitchen, looking like your mother would
"Of course. The stronger the blood, the greater the power. That's apparently their conviction."
Of course, the execution of a former Death Eater warranted merely basic media attention, especially if there were no other flashy news in the paper. Also, being close to Dementors still scared most people. However, if the convict in question had had a run-in with the 'Saviour', things got a lot more interesting. The moment Neville and Harry appeared at the execution site, Robarts swept them up and put them on guard duty, despite them not being on the roster. Surprised at the hundred-or-so people in attendance, the raven-haired admitted, "I was not aware that Anton Dolohov was such a public figure."
"Not as long as
"It is not my fault that their 'English Breakfast' is extraordinarily delicious." The blonde defended herself while sipping from her cup serenely.
Still wringing his hands, the elf avoided his eyes when replying, "Sir is Harry Potter, head of the Potter family, head of the Black family, Master of the house."
Every other day, Harry was tasked with getting updates from Malfoy Manor. And though he basically could not understand a single word, everyone involved appeared more excited as days went on. By now, the hopeful mood seemed to hit the young Auror the moment he entered the Manor, leaving him in high spirits for the rest of the day.
descendant, fortunately."
"Always."
"You need a lab," Harry concluded. "And your …"
"Harry," he croaked, shivering all of a sudden. "My name is Harry. Please, don't call me 'my Lord', I'm not Him. All I want to do is help."
Able to follow the former teacher's line of thinking, Pince piped up, "But elves are bound to places as much as they are bound to families. Such spells, or charms, would not close but rather hide that connection."
Shaking his head, Lucius explained, "I tried to steal one of your vegetables but received a nasty burn for the attempt."
"Oh, … how do you feel? Do you want to talk about it?"
"How is he?" Was the first question out of Harry's mouth, when he stepped out of the floo.
The next day went without Draco sharing either lunch or tea with Severus again. He also skipped dinner. Since Harry had been caught up at the Ministry, the Potion Master decided to take a light meal in his room.
Every surviving member of Dumbledore's Army followed suit.
Hermione was pulled out of her sleep when a house-elf popped in, carrying a tray of food. "You were supposed to wake me!" She hissed, but the older wizard seemed unconcerned.
Not able to help himself, Bill rose from his seat and hugged the woman. "Thank you! This is brilliant!"
Griphook had already opened it, but the last Potter pulled back from the entrance, shaking his head. "I can't. I'm hungry, and I need the loo and … and I can't."
wizard in the country knows about it. My job is quite difficult on occasion. I see no reason not to use all means available to intimidate an opponent or instil trust in a witness to get it to talk to me. Fame goes a long way in our world."
After the other wizard had taken a few calming breathes, he clarified, "I am offering, Draco. I am not forcing anything on you. I want to reward you for services rendered."
"Yes, my time, fruits of the earth or flower-wreathes Luna enjoys making. My altar at home is my mantlepiece."
"No," Draco replied evenly but raised his hand when Harry opened his mouth. "I have, however, given Astoria the means to do it herself."
That was not a question Draco had considered before. Being forced to share intention, means and opportunity had been something he and Severus had prepared for. But did he actually want to share the details of how he had killed a man? Draco had to take responsibility for that. At Hogwarts, he had been able to avoid it, avoided to take someone's life. But now … Astoria had done it, but he had provided the means. She had been the abused wife, emotionally compromised, but Draco had acted in cold blood and with a clear mind. Didn't that deserve some kind of penalty? Murderers were supposed to go to Azkaban. He undoubtedly deserved it now.
A few tapestries had been rolled up against the wall. The young witch, however, seemed more interested in what was behind them. Using their combined strength, the two wizards had stabilised the carpets, while Hermione had pulled out a covered painting. Putting it on a sideboard, after removing the jewellery case, she had folded back the protective fabric.
"I scored an O," the Auror whispered.
"Like liking each other!" the child piped up.
"Nobody knows, really. Dumbledore theorised that you sacrificing your life for me created this powerful magical protection. One that shielded me from Tom's dark magic, till the ritual at the graveyard in fourth year."
Shrugging nonchalant, the redhead stated, "Not more than sixty to seventy percent. You are regarded by the goblins."
Looking at the witch and wizards, at the table, Severus saw the wisdom of the request. "I will see to it."
Another head shake. But Narcissa was not satisfied with non-verbal answers any longer. "What did he take?" She repeated the question, insisting on an answer.
"Why am I not surprised!" Blaise sneered, claiming the strawberry ice-cream before George could snatch it away.
"From that day on, I came to you nearly every evening. Talking about … nothing really, since not a lot was happening these days. I was just …"
"Emilia, … ahm … hi … I mean, … good morning. Would you care for a cup of tea?"
"Just because he is legally entitled to the Black−vaults, does not make him a member of the family!" The portrait declared icily. "I'm very disappointed in you, Narcissa. You were such a sweet, little girl with perfect manners and an understanding of what was proper. We were all so happy when your father and Abraxas Malfoy started arranging your wedding contract. What, by Merlin, happened to you?"
"Oh, Harry," Lily sighed. "Don't say that, darling. I am sure …" Yet stopped when Harry pulled up his hair, revealing his fading scar. "Tom gave this to me, the first time he tried to kill me."
"Sir!"
"With pleasure." Pulling out his wand, Draco cast, "Silencio."
With a wicked gleam in his eyes, Harry inquired, "Is that so." Then he leaned down and whispered words directly into the Potion Master's skin.
"She's a she?"
--O-O--
Pulling a change of clothes and some toiletries out of the horrible bag, the two wizards were in the process of putting on their dress-robes, when a realisation hit Draco. "That was the reason for you sleeping in my room. Am I right? Not some weird sense of proprietary!"
Lucius had managed to catch a duck and a dove and was smiling smugly when his liege touched down on the ground beside him. Harry had not managed to capture even one of the conjured animals and was currently wrestling with the reason for that. Right at the start of the hunt, their transfigured prey had flushed a mangled and half-starved snow fox, from his hiding place; a rotten tree at the edge of the forest. The beast had been half mad with fear and hunger, darting over snow-covered fields in a desperate attempt to find new shelter. Only when the animal had been at the end of its strength, had Harry been able to pick it up without getting bitten. However, as soon as the kit had realised that the human had no intentions of harming it, it had tried to burrow into the young wizard's cloak to find protection from the wind. Though Harry had accommodated the animal, it had been a constant struggle to keep it from falling off the soaring broom, as the fox kept crawling around inside his jacket.
"Your house-elf puts spices in your coffee?"
The former Death Eater could not help but shiver. He had lived under the same roof as Voldemort, but even towards the end, he had always been able to predict his Lord’s actions. They had been vile, torturous and painful, but he had known what to expect. Harry Potter was an unknown factor. His face was void of emotion, and the pureblood could imagine him casting a curse as easily as petrifying him and shipping him back to Azkaban. Or – even worse – round up Lucius’ family and send them back to the Manor, where they would suffer isolation and starvation, entirely at the mercy of an Auror who had none for former followers of the Dark Lord.
Studying the platinum-blond for a heartbeat, getting lost in his own head, Harry nodded, "Maybe she wants to join us for dinner in an hour?"
"When is it ever not?" The blond grumbled. "But fine. Since Uncle Sev is out for the count, come on up. I want to show you how far I have come with the wolfsbane potion."
Casting his eyes back to the past, Neville shivered before he nodded. "The potion exploded straight into her face, and there was … by Merlin," He sighed, rubbing his eyes as if exhausted, trapped in the memories of that horrible afternoon. "There was blood everywhere and I … there were only a few drops of Dittany left in my bottle. You know we all had a vial on us in seventh year. Somehow that habit stuck, and I thank Merlin for that every day."
"Shire horses," Narcissa whispered, watching the impressive animals thundering around the hill, approaching the Lovegood residency at full speed. Draco's hand entwined with his mother's, but even then, Harry could see his fingers trembling with excitement. He seemed to gravitate towards the giant beasts, but his father held him back. "Don't, Draco. These are wild animals, not suitable for riding."
Grinning, Neville put his arm around Harry's shoulder and admitted, "I do not have the slightest clue, my friend."
Mounting his own horse, a flecked mare that had taken a liking to him, the raven−haired shrugged. "I assume they have never been that way since before you were born. Decisions have consequences, and I think your father will see that entering the Ritual of Compulsory Surrender with me was the smartest one he has made in quite a while."
Frowning, Neville ordered, "Auror Leewood, check her. And take her wand. We'll bring her in for questioning."
"Why?"
Class, right along with Harry, Ron and Hermione for destroying a Horcrux and for 'outstanding behaviour in the face of mortal danger'. As if facing Voldemort in that courtyard had anything on living through the Carrows and keeping the others safe, during seventh year. There was no job on the British Isles they would not have given me."
"And he signed it?"
Stepping around him, Granger seemed a little uneasy on her feet, no wonder after having a killing curse aimed at her. So Lucius reached out to stabilise her. He hid his smile when she mumbled, "Tap it to the floor." The moment he did, the simmering bubble around them was sucked back into the Basilisk's fanged mouth, before its eyes dulled to a metal grey again.
Raising his eyebrow, the Slytherin challenged, "You were saying?"
Hearing that, Harry had groaned, "I have a contract with Luna and The Quibbler, Narcissa. Do you know what you have said? How can I keep your promise without having Luna's paper suffer?"
"Because Luna and I are working for it! Nobody says that you can't have it too, if you are making enough of an effort."
"Don't be," the witch replied, taking the young boy's hand. "Teddy seemed to enjoy himself, but now prepare yourself for dinner." Looking at the pink-haired boy, she decided, "We will wash off this paint, and you, Harry, can go upstairs to change."
The others hovered uncertainly at that outburst until Leewood asked drily, "Feeling better now?"
"Touch his torso and the floor! All you need to do is let your magic flow. Be careful not to push anything into his system. Just try to open up and allow yourself to become a conduit. Energy always tries to even out, you just have to give it the means. If you feel the overflow, push it into the spell we have woven." Bill explained.
Slowly reaching out, giving him ample time to retreat, she patted his arm. "Because you are strong, so amazingly strong, it blows my mind at times."
"Never thought I'd need one."
"But you promised to help me pick seeds, so I can grow Victoire a tree for her birthday!" The young boy's lips began to tremble. "Uncle Harry is not that good with plants. He said so himself and Neville couldn't make time. And you promised!"
Swallowing down tears she felt welling up, Hermione inquired, "What did you tell them?"
Shrugging, darkness clouded his face. "After Greyback … what do I really have to be afraid of? Becoming a monster? Bloodtooth … he's all bark and no bite. We don't even work in the same department."
Harry shrugged, "Kinda obvious. I have been getting these strange feelings lately when I am around him. Over the past few weeks they have continuously gotten stronger and very intense. I did some research, with Hermione's help, and I started studying up on Veela because that was the only thing that could really make sense." He looked to Fleur, "I saw you the first night back at school, leaving Draco's bed, I heard the end of your conversation."
etched into it forever. Harry sat down, taking Hermione's hand away from her arm. She sat rigid, her face fell cold.
"Yes, really." The Professor ushered her three former students towards a café across the sun-heated road, "Why don't we get something to drink and we can speak more on the matter?"
Draco slipped his wand out, "Let's get him sedated and out of here and then we can see what we are working with and what we can do for him."
"No, this is most definitely not a sign. If anything it's a reminder of why I left in the first place." Draco leaned back onto the rock, "Pansy the second I saw him.. the second I looked at his stupid face and saw his stupid green eyes and his stupid hair that he still doesn't know how to fix.. it was like everything rushed back to me. Everything that I have tried so hard to forget, tried so hard to push away just came crashing back."
They both looked at each other.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco had almost made it all the way to the top of the vines before he noticed the slight tingle of magic surrounding his hands. He looked up, startled at the cat who had moved positions and was now sitting upright on the branch, tailing hanging down loosely.
Everyone turned to look at the baker. They all blinked at him for a very long moment.
Draco looked up at Harry, fingers still rubbing Harry's skin, "Not much. Being attacked nearly everyday with a wand that didn't chose you, there fore barely could do a simple
“What are we going to do, Draco?” Harry said solemnly.
Draco smiled widely, turning towards the band, "Sounds like they want another song? What do you say guys?"
you are in with the Ministry."
Hermione put her spoon down, "Do you need me to come with you?"
Hermione was the first to stand, "Classes start tomorrow so I think I'm going to head back. I advise the rest of you to do the same."
He glanced up at the vines in his clutch. Time seemed to slow as the last of vines split away from each other, Draco felt all his breath leave him, and his mind instantly sending him to the worst of his nightmares.
Draco spoke up, "Why isn't there many left?"
Suddenly, Malfoy pulled away, instantly forcing himself to relax. After a breath, he blurted, "Want to go down to the kitchens? I could really use a late-night-early-morning snack."
As he reached for Draco's hands, Draco, in a flash, pulled his hands away, gripping Harry's shoulders and switched their position so Harry was the one trapped between the boy and the wall.
Harry looked thoughtful for a moment, "That could work.. but
He attempted to pull away from Harry, but Harry only held on tighter, using one of his hands to lift Draco's chin, "You don't have to believe me. I know you probably don't. But just know that I do forgive you. That I don't hold anything against you. I thought I did, but seeing you again after all this time has shown me what I have always subconsciously known. That what happened over those years was simply just cause and effect. Even if I do have a few thoughts on our past, we have grown. Both of us. The second I saw you for the first time I knew that you weren't the same Malfoy I knew in school. Well, the second time I saw you. The first I may have run into the bathroom like a scarred ninny."
and got to travel the muggle world. He was very proud of the life he has made for himself. He loves what he does, he has made some new friends from all around, and best of all, he doesn't have to deal with the drama that the war had. He got away from all the pointing, the stares, the prejudice. He rarely thought about the war these days. He still has his scars and nightmares, but he chooses to see them as reminders of what he has survived, not a reminders of where he comes from, literally and metaphorically.
"Because,"
Draco as always been very gifted in
, he has never had the opportunity to fully treat a wild cat. Draco felt a shiver run through his blood as he thought about all the new challenges he soon will be facing. If there is one thing Draco has always known about himself, it was that he loved a good challenge. Also, seeing as his Animagus was that of the feline species, it will be very interesting to learn more about his larger family.
Draco nodded, putting down the jar he was holding.
"No you aren't."
Harry's smirk grew wider, "Okay, how about we do
He raised his head as Professor Slughorn wobbled in, "Rough life, Malfoy."
was doing things to Harry that he has never felt with any other girl or boy. The feeling was become addicting.
Harry chuckled, softly. "I think being in the Hufflepuff's old room is doing some crazy things to my head."
A few minutes later, Harry stared at his reflection for the gazillionth time. He wore his favorite shirt - a dark red button down -  with a pair of washed out blue jeans that fit him snugly.
Harry gazed down at the parchment that sat between the two boys, trying to decide if he should mention the Half-Blood Prince’s book that he used. Seeing Malfoy looking at him in wonder, he knew he had to tell him. "I had this book. It was written by someone who called themselves the ‘Half-Blood Prince’, who actually-"
"Yeah but they aren't as good as yours." Draco winked, causing a bright red to float up Harry's neck and face.
Sighing, he flopped himself under the large oak, found on a small hill by the Great Lake.
Draco glanced around the cage, finding only a dark, empty room surrounding it. He looked back at the boy, forcing his face into a soft, kind look to hide the fear and disgust he felt. "No, I'm not here to hurt you." He slowly knelt down, noting the subtle flinch the boy gave. "My name is Draco, would you mind telling me yours?"
Harry had to cover his mouth to stop himself from laughing too loudly, "I, um, I think I can give you an explanation for that one."
Harry's smile, along with Malfoy's, broke, just like Hermione's voice from that one little word.
They all mumbled in agreement as their waitress walked up with their food.
Harry turned and began walking back the way he came from, not daring to turn around and look back at his used-to-be nemesis. He felt if he turned around and saw the brightness that seemed to live on this new Malfoy's face, he wouldn't be able to stop looking.
we harbor the same gifts our ancestors do. At least some of us do."
Slughorn wobbled over, noticing the blood, his face paled and he sent for Madame Pomfrey.
"Ah, yes, yes. I will have to see if I can find him tomorrow before the ritual, than."
"I'll see you around, Malfoy."
Taking a shallow breath, he stepped closer to the bars, pausing only for a moment to see the cat's reaction, before unlocking the cage door and walking through. The cat let of out a low rumble in warning. Draco crouched down again before speaking softly to the animal, "I understand you are afraid. But you don't have to fear us, we are here to help you. My mate and I rescue ones like you for our share. We won't hurt you, we want to help you."
Harry couldn't help but smile at the brightness that shown through the boy's face when talking about his old elf. He suddenly felt an overwhelming curiosity about the boy next to him, feeling an intense want -
. Strolling down towards the path that lead to back to school, the aroma of baked goods and coffee drew him into a quaint bookshop/cafe.
As the crowd erupted, he barely heard them. His eyes stayed stuck on the not-so-small anymore boy - no
The next morning, Harry woke up with a grin, still on a bit of a high from the previous day. He jumped out of bed, eager to get down stairs, and began getting dressed and ready for the day.
*****
Harry looked at him with such wonder in his eyes. Under the stars, his eyes shown brightly.
Draco raised an eyebrow, "Who said I wouldn't enjoy it?"
Those eyes, those brilliant green eyes that were slowly getting brighter as he looked up at Draco constantly taking Draco's breath away. The contrast from the darkness of his skin and fur to the brightness of the green was simply breath taking. This panther was truly astonishingly beautiful. Draco ran his hand down the cat's head twice before slowly removing it from his knee and standing up.
Harry felt Draco lay down beside him. He turned towards the boy as more tears slipped. He hated this. He finally started to feel normal again. Well, what he assumes is normal.. he has never really been it before but what he has felt the past days has felt extremely nice and refreshing. Even the bad parts, felt good; they felt good because it was choices he was making not choices someone else was making for him. He was starting to feel alive like he had a whole bright life in front of him.
As he spoke the blue lights began flowing gently in the ring, almost in the motions of a soft stream. As the magic swirled, Draco's hair raised higher as the magical atmosphere became denser.
He put his hands on the back of his neck, massaging the muscles gently. Killing one person for the sake of beauty was one things, killing two just to keep an island beautiful was another. There has to be more to it. Why would they kill two innocent people just to have pretty land?
are thinking now? I think we might be the ones touched in the head, not the creators of the universe."
The two boys sat in silence until the sun went down, they eventually moved to head back to the dorms, staying silent the whole way there. The only words spoken were a soft
Draco looked down confused, “You don’t feel them? They are all over the island.”
Luna's eyes brightened as she spotted Malfoy, "Hello, cousin. I love your hair!" She sauntered over to him and ran a hand through the sky blue strands, "It is gorgeous. It really makes your eyes pop."
Hermione began to speak as they made their way out the hall, "I think I know who that little girl is that Malfoy talks to."
"Darling, the only stupid thing here is you."
Mr. Perch, a French baker, added, "I haven't personally met either boy, but I did see the dark one go into Mr. Gallings shop."
The end of what Narcissa said to Draco was taken from a quote: “Allow failure to teach you a supreme lesson: Each sunset is the beginning of a very, very bright and powerful sunrise.” – Sri Chinmoy. Source of quote: inspirationfeed.com/sunset-quotes/
Draco spoke up, "Why isn't there many left?"
Malfoy shook his head, "No one could have."
Harry, who was watching the exchange along with Hermione and Ginny, couldn't help but agree with Luna.
"I'm think I'm going to move here." Harry thought out loud, to no one in particular.
"999. Unknown moves. Get Hermione Granger and a RE member STAT." He whispered towards his wrist.
They stood in awkward silence for a moment before Hampton walked towards a table in the far corner and sat down, gesturing Harry to do the same.
Draco took in a ragged breath, letting it sit in his lungs a moment before slowly releasing it. He slid his hand towards his bracelet, pressing the silver button on the side.
She rolled her eyes as she fully stepped into the room, shutting the door behind herself. "Why are you like this?" She asked, exasperated.
Granger jerked back, eyes widening as she took in the sight of Draco standing among the mess. "Oh, Merlin, Draco, hi.. I'm sorry about the mess." She walked further into the room, picking up a few books from the floor. "It's usually not like this, sorry, just things have been- well, you know. Well, actually you don't know, but, just, sorry. I-"
By Monday morning he felt if he looked at anymore books he would have no choice but to off himself by placing his head in the middle of two books and slamming them together. Which was a real shame because one: he now has to spent an entire evening with Granger while looking through even more books and two: he knows Granger would never allow him to hurt her books by slamming his head in between them.
Hampton stared at his shoes for a moment before responding, "So, both boys will die?"
Draco pulled Harry closer, “Don’t worry, love. I like it. Quite a lot actually.”
Harry shook his head, "That day.. when you talked to me at the bar, you knew who I was."
When the elevator dinged, Draco quickly shoved the three pamphlets into his pocket and turned towards the doors.
Mitch's flight didn't leave until an hour after Draco's, so she walked with him to his port. It was small talk most of the way there, until a serious look floated onto Mitch's face.
Ginny and Luna dropped the many supplies they carried. An array of chips, snack cakes, dips, and finger sandwiches fell to the table. Malfoy placed down what looked like muggle soda along with pumpkin juice and plastic cups elegantly onto the table besides the snacks.
"I have a Dreamless Sleep and a Sleeping Draught, would you like one to help for the night?" Pansy asked.
Harry turned to fully face him, "I know you did. We were in a war. We were children. We had people who we looked up to who told us what to do and we listened and we believed them even when they weren't always right because we didn't know any better." He ran an aggravated hand through his hair, "Hell, we still are children. Looking back I have realized how screwed each and everyone of us were with our role models being who they were. That war was
From his seat across the hall, Harry gasped as his eyes landed on his former nemesis.
"Malfoy, are you sure-"
As he grasped it tightly, it suddenly seemed to come alive. A warm feeling passed through Harry, the heat source seemed to come from the necklace in his hand.
When Potter just stood, making no other movements besides his swaying, Draco started to feel a little worried, "Hey, Potter, are you alright?"
"-but instead, we decided to go with green, very pretentious of a Slytherin, I know, I know, but it wasn't Slytherin green, it was more of an emerald. Much like your eyes."
******
A heavy silence fell over as they stared into the stormy clouds.
Draco was cut off as an ear pitching scream sounded around the entire room. The scream so high pitched, Draco had to hold onto his mic stand to keep from falling over. The room seemed to disappear, leaving only Draco and the insanely high pitched scream that continuously got louder. Draco felt as if his body was completely empty, nothing left but the drilling sounds and his own agony. The sound rang through Draco's mind, body, and soul, eating away at every piece of him. The noise of a thousand nails on chalkboards and a million saws going through steel echoed in his mind, even after he knew the sound had subsided.
Malfoy's face looked panicked. Harry was hit with a desperate need to take Malfoy out of this situation.
Something was very, very off here.
Harry folded his arms over his chest, "Are you trying to convince me or yourself?"
he had for Harry ran so deep inside his body that he felt like every single organ, vein, nerve and muscle worked to be able to keep Harry happy. He realized in this moment, what he said upstairs was so true that it almost hurt. He knew he would do anything to keep this precious life safe, no matter the cost.
"Yeah, um, I have to-"
He stepped closer to the two unconscious bodies, while keeping an eye on the panther. The cat jumped up onto a large boulder off to the side, sitting down roughly, tail whipping in irritation.
Draco was beginning to think Harry might have put a spell on his eyes to make anyone who sees them lose their breath.
Taking a bite out of his eggs, Draco chewed slowly before responding, "Are
The restroom was dimly lit, like it often was during late nights. He strolled over to one of the sinks and turned on the cold water, letting the water stream down his hands for a moment before rubbing it on his neck and face, letting the vague memories of his nightmares slip down the drain. The depression, he knew, would take a little longer to disappear.
said it was either him or her. The women who raised me, took care of me even when darkness over took our home, or a man I only knew from word of mouth and hollow speeches. It wasn't exactly the hardest decision I've ever made. It wasn't until I got to the top of those stairs. Till I saw him. I could tell he was weak.." Malfoy audible gulped. "I could see it in his eyes. He was already basically dead. Even knowing that.. that this man was most likely going to die whether from my hand or not.. I-" His voice broke off.
Malfoy dried his hands quickly and cast a
Parkinson sat observing him. She searched his face, finally nodding as she found what she was looking for. "I don't like you, Potter. Lord knows why Draco does. But he does and if you truly
As the man spoke, Draco leaned closer to Harry whispering, “The building is spelled, Harry."
"Did you have your own elves growing up?"
It seemed as if every student was in the common room when Harry and Malfoy arrived. Even Hermione, who is rooming in their old houses rooms, was there, chatting happily with Luna Lovegood and Ginny Weasley.
They walked silently the rest of the way down the pier, both lost in their own thoughts trying to process the knowledge they both received
"Like a dog?"
George, Draco learned, was smiling widely, "Yes it is. Bravo, Mr. Malfoy. I heard you will be performing tonight at the meeting. Everyone is very excited to see you again."
"But we still were old enough to make our own choices. I was old enough. I knew exactly what I was doing, why I was doing it, and what it would become. And I. still. did. it." Draco sighed, wishing the fun atmosphere from a few minutes ago was still here, "I did it because I was afraid. People,
Harry leaned into Draco, grabbing both his hands and lacing them with his own, "Thank you." He said earnestly.
Two Months ago, he would have assumed the sour face Malfoy had on his face was a yearly thing. No matter where or who he was with, Harry thought his face would stay the same. He quickly, as their friendship began to grow closer, realized his mistakes.
Hand strumming the last cord, Draco felt himself become frozen. Draco is often on stages, always performing for new people, new personalities, new faces. But he has never had someone, let alone someone from his past, look at him with such awe. As odd as it was to have
Hampton's eyes scanned the room glancing at the familiar members of the Founders. Each member was the "man of the house" for each founding family. Many of them are the father figures, except for Mrs. Mellow and Widow Annie, whose husbands have both passed. Seeing as Hampton was the oldest of his three siblings and their parents have long passed, he had no choice in being the chosen one for his name.
Harry looked towards Malfoy, noticing he had tensed slightly, finger freezing in its movements down the page. His skin seemed to turn even whiter than it normally is, competing with the white snow that falls every winter. In the blink of an eye, the boy relaxed again and continued skimming the book, the only indication of his discomfort was the still slightly tensed shoulders and the worry-inducing paleness. Harry wanted to reach over and soothe the rest of the tension out of his neck, but quickly diminished the idea knowing Malfoy wouldn't be very accepting of it.
Malfoy nodded, not breaking eye contact, "I know I was the biggest asshole. I was worst than that, honestly. I'm not asking for forgiveness, though I am really sorry about what had happened and what I contributed to the suffering of all of you." Malfoy sighed, "Everything I did, well most things, were because I had no other choice. I had to be this bad guy. I had to fight against everything."
Harry looked up, confused on who he is talking to, "Um, are you.. did you hit your head that hard that you are now talking to air?"
Harry and Hampton rushed into the bar, hoping a good seat was still available. The room was packed to the rim, with people squeezed together like sardines.
"On the contrary," the man admitted somewhat hoarsely. "The Dark Mark seemed to like another item of parselmagic so close."
Tilting his head with the hint of a smile, the Potion Master agreed. "Indeed, it does not."
After they had left the house, he lectured, "There is no such thing as 'eyedropping'. Watching other people in secret is called spying."
"Ruby!"
a Potion Master, as of this week. There is no one better at Ritual Magic than Manson. And Narcissa cares for the medical side of things. However, she's the only 'not-expert'. Should we do something about that?"
"It's charmed," Artur explained. "You put your hand on the clock-face and say
In a matter-of-fact tone, the Lady of the House had explained to him, what she thought of Harry running off for seventh year, leaving her grandson to fend for himself and the younger years, at Hogwarts. She detailed the trials and tribulations her boy had gone through and pointed out the magical strength and leadership skills he had gained in the process.
"Are they, …" Anastasia's eyes bore into Harry's for a heartbeat, before she shrugged easily. "Well, that's too bad."
"The Order of Merlin 2
When the pair disappeared through the flames, Charles gapped, "Did he just connect the most secretive library in the entire kingdom to the house of a convict?"
"You dunderhead! Marriage has nothing to do with childish notions as trust or love or faith! It is the merge of two people and their assets, no matter how meagre they might be! You can rest assured that Arthur would have insisted on a wedding contract to eliminate the risk of anybody seeing his daughter as a gold-digger. As it would have been proper!"
While Blackwood's elf curled up on the floor wailing, Harry pulled Emerald into his arms, "Baby-girl, you were brilliant! I'm so proud of you!"
"He was a greasy git!"
So many things had occurred in the first twenty-six years of her life. Three-headed dogs, poisonous plants, menacing beetles, winged omens of death, torture and dragons, starvation and battles for life and death, even horcruxes, inadvertently created or not. But none of these things had ever felt personal to Hermione. In the end, it had always been Harry's problems she had taken on. It had been her own choice and though, looking back, Hermione knew that she could have never chosen differently. She had been the mistress of her own fate. But this,
"Yes. … No!" Harry was torn. "I … maybe it would be better if I waited a few hours. I can't abandon my job every time something comes up at home. And it's nearly 4 p.m.. Not long before we can call it a day."
"Severus," the other man repeated, "Never Sev!"
"It is completely safe!" The blond insisted. "I did my research, just like you taught me. Nothing in there is even remotely toxic and the reciprocal effects between the ingredients are neglectable."
Grouching, Griphook inquired, "Do you want to see your vault now, Master Snape, or would you prefer to continue discussing your take on goblin psychology with Lord Potter-Black?"
Not taking her eyes off her bloody name, aware of how much it would hurt Harry if this did not work, Narcissa clasped her hands and prayed to all the gods she remembered. When the blood vanished, and a faint glow travelled over the depiction of the tree, she smiled with grim satisfaction. Turning around, she offered the portrait of her formerly beloved aunt a cold look.
The Aurors did their best to stun and confine, but their range was limited. After a few minutes, Robarts ordered, "Potter, drop the shield!"
When Hermione had been pregnant with Rose, she had savoured combinations of chocolate and hard cured sausage in all forms. More than once, Ron had been tempted to weep over the chocolate treats he had brought for her when seeing them combined with Italian sausage.
Leaning against the staircase, Draco chuckled. "Is he always like this?"
"All those 'heavily involved in aiding and abetting the Dark Lord Voldemort's downfall' were honoured with an Order of Merlin 2
"Thank you."
Putting an arm around Lily, James agreed, "Sniv… Severus is right, Harry. Peter is not your concern any longer, so stop wasting your time thinking about him. He is not worth it."
"If," she repeated with forced calm, "that potion is in any way related to my husband's death, you may return and will receive your answer."
“Damn, Neville!” Harry cried out, doing his best to keep the unconscious figure from collapsing.
Hogwarts … so the school was still in session. A weight he had not known he had carried, was now lifted from his shoulders. No matter the outcome. The castle was still standing, and Poppy was still in charge of the infirmary. In a way, it felt enough. Exhaustion washed over him, and though he wished differently, his hand slipped from Emilia's fingers. He tried to force himself to stay awake, but the witch's comforting words soothed him, when she promised, "You can go to sleep now. We will be here in the morning."
As Draco lay in bed that night, he went over Severus' notes once again, trying to discover where he had gone wrong. When his vibrating wand woke him the next day, he felt like he had just closed his eyes.
Heading towards the kitchen, still familiar with the layout of the former Order of Phoenix's Headquarters, the Minister decided, "I would not say no to either. Do you think Mr Potter has any biscuits prepared? The ones with ginger perhaps? I really could do with some sugar."
Choking on his tea, the Potion Master fought for breath, as Neville spelled away the mess he made. "Longbottom, are you honestly thanking me for being a bastard for you for seven years?"
There was this damn hopeful look in Potter's eyes, and for a moment, Draco had to remind himself, that the raven-haired still had no right to make Severus Snape's research public, that he was angry at him for his indiscretion. Even if it was only in the privacy of his own home.
Have fun and Happy Easter to all of you who celebrate it and a great weekend to those who don't.
"Yes, so, we thought about relocating the potions lab to a recently discovered dungeon floor. We could lift the roof so you could have a living space, independent from the rest of the house. We thought bedroom, office-slash-salon, bathroom obviously and a small kitchen with a dining room attached, or detached, according to your liking. It wouldn't be huge, around 970 square feet with maybe a small storage area under the roof. But it could be planned to satisfy your needs. And one day, we may even add a nursery." He tapered off; worried that he had said too much; or too little.
"Mr Potter," Severus interrupted in his best 'professor's' voice. "Don't tell me that Mr Malfoy and I need to give you the 'wands and holsters' talk."
--O-O--
"You made
"I will," Harry mumbled, diving under the table for a few of the vegetables.
Narrowing his eyes, the other wizard stated, "We are not done talking about this!"
"How could he, Harry? Why did it have to be him and not Bill, or Charlie, or Percy, or …"
With a sigh, because this was something he simply could not keep to himself, Harry had turned towards his two best friends. "Sorry, guys, … could you …?" Vaguely he gestured towards the door.
Doing as they were told, the Black-sisters activated the spell that turned their watches into an imitation of the Weasley clock. Trading a quick glance, they discovered wordlessly, that both watches had been equipped with not one but two hands each. Tilting her head, Narcissa spoke quietly, "This gift is very much appreciated." 'Especially the 'Mortal Danger' section she hoped the boys' hands would stay away from.' "Thank you, Molly, … Arthur."
After the door had closed behind Draco, Harry pondered, "No, I really think I don't," before he returned to his desk. He might not understand what the innocent present of a child meant to the Malfoy heir, but maybe, in time, he would.
Claiming both bottles, Astoria tilted her head gratefully. "Thank you, Draco. I'm …," but before she could offer debt or something similar, she caught herself. She was in no position to make promises, right now, so she merely repeated. "I am very grateful."
Without your encouragements and feedback, ideas and criticism (because yes, I even took those to the heart) you all accompanied me through what has been the most challenging time of my life. Thank you all for your patience, your understanding and your kind words. The person that is undoubtedly most, most, MOST important for the success of this story, is my betareader DarthKrande. She was my guiding light and my ever-patient sounding board for new ideas and plot bunnies. I could have done this without her!
There was another vault. The 'main' Potter vault, as Griphook had told Harry once the war had been over. His 'expenses' vault had contained merely a fraction of his family's wealth, meant to tidy him over Hogwarts. But while Harry had been able to bring himself to enter Sirius' private vault, the one his parents had used was merely gaining income, remaining untouched.
Maybe, Harry thought, he should introduce the two wizards at one point, since he seriously doubted that Snape would come out of his coma - and even more his role in the war - unscattered. Still, his talks … monologues really … with their residing 'dungeon bat' had always comforted him more than the obligatory sessions with the mind healer. Now, however, Harry was not sure if he was allowed to have them any longer. Maybe Snape would hate him if he came to his senses. Perhaps he would be grateful. Yet if the young wizard was honest with himself, he did not want to enter a conversation his opposite only entertained out of gratitude. Listening to the clock chime, Harry decided that there was nothing he could do about it for now. So, he gently closed the door again and made his way up to the attic.
Clenching his butter-knife for a moment, Draco nodded. "I'm aware. It's just … all this brings up a lot of bad memories."
"And how exactly do you propose I do that?"
Uncaring if he was followed, the goblin sneered, "Since Master Snape was considered dead, he does not have an account manager."
Shivering on the floor, Lucius' lips moved restlessly, though no sound came out. Hiding his face behind his long, platinum tresses, he tried his best to keep himself from betraying any secrets through other means than speech. He flinched slightly when Hermione stepped up to him and put a comforting hand on his shoulder. Apparently, the pain was not all gone, though he was free to 'talk' at the moment.
"… it might be all about the mindset."
Surprisingly, he actually sounded genuine, so the young woman nodded and left Grimmauld Place for the apothecary. Leaving Harry with his guardians-slash-servants for now.
" and threw the first hex, right at Shacklebolt.
For a moment, the young witch seemed to contemplate putting up a fight, but - since she could not take her eyes off the sword - she sooner rather than later recognised the blade. Her hand began to tremble as she lowered her wand. Barely audible, she whispered, "That's Excalibur, the sword of … who, by Merlin, are you?"
"Like their sanity?"
"Well, we are currently working on the potion that gives it colour. But I think it's not that far off," Harry mumbled, doing his best to hide his smile.
"Out of the question!" Draco decided. "The last thing Severus might remember about father might be him losing the favour of the Dark Lord. But him being bound to you, serving you devotedly might be a bit of a stretch. Best not to talk about him."
"What ritual?" His father wanted to know.
Chuckling, Ron looked over his shoulder. "Oh, yes. He and your 'love interest' came in about half an hour ago. They are in the back garden. Hermione is helping them to set up a cage."
Stay safe and stay healthy.
Touching the raven-haired's shoulder, his new partner turned him around. "Listening to gran's stories, you would think that I single-handedly saved the entire student body from the Carrows. But I had Luna and Ginny and the other seventh years. I do not need you to be all-powerful. Just be Harry and have my back and allow me to protect yours. Can you do that?"
Gesturing for Kreacher to serve his master, she asked, “How long have you been awake?”
"He is?" The youngest red-head asked surprised. "But what about …?" She gestured into the vague direction of the second bedroom on the third floor.
someone in Draco's corner unconditionally. The blond had had a hard-enough life after all. Yet a tiny part of him envied the unreserved support. The raven-haired nearly flinched when a warm hand touched his shoulder, turning him back around.
With a pop, the elf appeared. With great dignity, he bowed and inquired, "What can Kreacher do for you, Master?" At the same time, he glared mutinous at the two wizards, daring them to say something about the tinsel that dangled off his ears.
"What do you mean '
Molly, however, shook her head decidedly. "Absolutely not, dearie. You went through all the trouble to invite the family. The least we can do is let you sleep in your own bed!"
, more than anything, that had him firecalling the Weasleys’ house that night. To his surprise, it wasn’t Mrs. Weasley who answered after a few moments, but Hermione, hair frizzing and flying with the muss of sleep. She had taken one look at Harry’s shaking form and immediately flooed over to retrieve him.
“I’m sure he will.” Hermione blushes. “I mean—stability is more important than ever. I’m sure Professor McGonagall will prioritize it over everything else.”
“Maybe it won’t be so bad,” Hermione says bracingly. She catches Ron’s look of disbelief. “I just mean…Malfoy has to live with you for the rest of the year. He knows he can’t afford any more disciplinary issues, not with his history. Maybe he’ll be more respectful now that you have to share a living space. If not for your sake, then for his own.”
“Our letters have come,” she says. “Errol just brought them. He’s recuperating now, so don’t expect to send any letters out for at least a week.”
The good-byes are short when they come, although Mrs. Weasley is still tearful; no one is fond of saying good-bye anymore. They dance around the word, replacing it with

Hermione visibly struggles for words. “I’m not saying they haven’t,” she finally says. “But I’ve been—I’ve been thinking this summer. When…when I was in Australia. And we were all so
Harry can’t help but agree, although he’s thankful it isn’t Malfoy or Zabini. Goyle, while still massively unpleasant, doesn’t have the acerbic wit or pointed hostility of the rest of his house. Still, the relief doesn’t outweigh the disappointment of being separated from Ron, or the worry about what will happen if—
Harry feels the familiar spike of anger rise in him. After months of careful numbness, rage swims up to the surface. After everything the Light had done for Malfoy—pardoned him of his role in the War, rebuilt Hogwarts after
Hermione never lets them go anywhere without the charmed coins, reminiscent of the DA’s messaging system. Harry would call her paranoid, but he also feels better when he can contact either one of them in seconds, regardless of where they are.
“Right,” Harry mutters. He can’t find it in himself to argue, no matter Hermione’s reproving expression, when he’s not sure he that he does disagree. Yes, Malfoy was young when he had made his mistakes, as Hermione said, but wasn’t Harry young then, too? And he had never become a Death Eater. Never caused so much pain and suffering and death. Never got to be so selfish.
“A bit?” Ron snorts.
He splashes his face with water from the tap, then looks at himself in the mirror, face dripping with the cold water. Hair jet black and unruly, face and body thinner somehow than at the beginning of the summer. He had assumed that not being on the run from a mass murderer would help him fill out his frame, but he remains as scrawny as ever. And his eyes—he is struck by how closely the look in his eyes resembles Malfoy’s earlier, when they had first seen each other again. The same bone-deep weariness in them both.
“The great Harry Potter, all alone. Pathetic. What a pity, everyone who died for you—what a waste. And now there’s no one left, is there?
“Merlin help us if Skeeter starts writing articles again. You think it’s a bloody mess now? Wait until those girls find out Harry’s single—” Ron cuts himself off abruptly as he catches Hermione’s sharp glance. A silence as thick as bubotuber pus settles over them.
“Well, it was still perfectly awful of me to assume,” Hermione insists weakly, but her face has mostly returned to its normal shade of brown. “I wonder why she’s chosen to take such a public position, now of all times.”
When Hermione and Harry squeeze through the front door of the Burrow, Ron and Ginny are still arguing.
“I’ll fetch him, Mrs. Weasley,” Hermione says. She rises from the table and gives Harry’s shoulder a brief squeeze on her way out.
“Blimey,” Ron mutters. “Can’t we turn her into a bug again?”
“Ever the hero, aren’t we, Potter?” Malfoy’s expression has twisted into one of bitter disdain. “Pity the War’s over and there’s no one left to sacrifice yourself for.”
“I still can’t believe they’re letting Death Eaters back into Hogwarts.” Ron’s brows crinkle in and his face begins to shift to an angry red. There’s a guardedness to his eyes that keeps Harry from disagreeing.
“Thanks,” Harry says. “I’ll keep that in mind.”
“What do you mean?” Hermione looks interested despite herself.
“A.L. Rai. He was supposed to be the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.”
“It’s alright, Hermione,” Neville says softly. “No one really knew she’s a woman—until now, I guess. She’s an infamous recluse, she is, always tries to be anonymous and all that. I only know because my Gran has connections to her family in Sudan. She even babysat her once, when she was younger.”
Ron’s face turns a worrying shade of red. His hands twitch towards his wand. “Don’t you
For now, he decides with grim determination, a good night’s sleep, without waking up in a panic, will do.

had led to its downfall, spared his mother despite her role in the deaths of nearly everyone Harry held dear—after all of that, Malfoy was throwing it back in his face.
McGonagall instructs all eighth years to remain at the front of the hall after the feast, and he, Ron, and Hermione have barely made it to the small circle of eighth years when Malfoy puts himself right into Harry’s line of sight. His thin frame, flanked by Blaise Zabini, steps in front of Harry, even as they face away from the trio.
“It’s no one’s fault, honestly.” She turns to Harry, brown eyes beseeching. “Really, Harry, these things happen in relationships. It’s all right if—if it’s not working out. Maybe…well, I was thinking…maybe some time for yourself isn’t such a bad thing?”
He pulls off his glasses and wipes a weary hand down his face. The brief comfort he had grasped during the Welcoming Feast is utterly gone. Perhaps it’s the lack of sleep or the lack of Ron waiting for him just outside the bathroom, but Harry suddenly feels lost. He can’t imagine the rest of the year playing out like this—coming back every day to Goyle, not Ron and Hermione, having to
“Lost, Malfoy?” Ron snaps.
, rather: Fred and Dumbledore and Lupin and so many others, cold and unmoving, never coming back. Harry wonders if there’s anyone who isn’t thinking about it.
He gasps awake, hands flying to his throat. His gasps rattle through the quiet of the dormitory and the feeling of breathlessness, of a heavy weight upon his chest, lingers. His heart races wildly in his chest.
Harry wakes in the gray of dawn each morning, twisted in sweaty bedsheets. Sometimes he wakes in darkness, more night than morning, whimpering. There is always a tight ball in his chest, as if someone has tied his lungs in a knot and pulled. It never loosens until his eyes find Ron’s snoring form in the darkness, and he reassures himself that the breath is moving steadily in and out of Ron’s lungs.
Malfoy is standing beside the door nearest the trio when they catch up; its mahogany frame shimmers with the carvings of minute owls, which fly and flit to and fro across the wood. Harry can tell at once that Malfoy has caught the end of their conversation. His eyes blaze with anger and something awful Harry can’t quite place; his jaw clenches, and he has drawn his shoulders up so high and tense that he looks like he would shatter on contact.
Through the curtained window, gray light trickles in. The sun has clearly risen, and Harry decides that sleep will not come again this morning. There’s no use staying in bed.
Minutes later, Ron and Hermione emerge. Ron yawns and frowns.
carved into her arm and instantly feels guilty for his earlier thought; for her, the threat of sleeping beside a Slytherin carries a heavier weight.
“We could always set Fang on him,” Ron mutters.
“Right.” Harry wishes he cared more. Like he used to. Wishes he could borrow some of Ron’s endless enthusiasm.
As the train trundles onward, rain begins to spatter at the windows. The skies coalesce dark and angry as water gathers on the glass. It reminds Harry of the train ride his third year, of the dementors and Lupin and his mother’s screams. He wonders what he would feel like now if Dementors were to swoop in. If those same screams would return, or if, like his nightmares, new screams would join the rotation. He hopes he’ll never have to find out.
“Thanks,” he mutters. He leaves quickly, before the mirror can make any more comments. He knows, unfortunately, what he looks like.
—Harry wakes loudly from a nightmare. Even Goyle, thick as he is, will find something disparaging to say if he catches Harry in the throes of a nightmare. At the very least, he’ll tell Malfoy, who will very much have something to say—in fact, he’ll probably never shut up about it.
-----
, weren’t we? When everything happened.” She speaks in a rush again. “But we weren’t the only ones who were young—they were, too.”
They settle into Gryffindor table with Ron on Harry’s right and Neville on his left. Hermione sits on Ron’s other side and Ginny, again, keeps her distance from Harry.
“What do you propose we do then? Ron has to find a way to live with him without doing anything stupid.”
. Because we’ll miss out on his expertise, of course. Not because—” Hermione cuts herself off.
“Good luck with Goyle,” Ron mutters before Harry can escape the bored gaze of Malfoy. “Wake me up if you need back-up.”
died, and Harry had only just—
“Well said, Hermione,” Neville interjects. “I know Luna would agree with you, if she were here.”
Hermione looks nauseous.
“Anything interesting?” Harry asks. He stands up from his crouch, body groaning, and steps toward the Burrow.
“That’d make anyone a recluse,” Ron mutters.
Almost.
And it was that thought, that aching
“Morning, Harry!” Mr. Weasley says upon seeing him. “Just got a copy of
Harry scans the head table as Ron complains about the delay in food (“We’ve seen six sortings already, do we really need to see another?”). Professor McGonagall—or Headmistress, rather—sits at the center of the table, her shrewd eyes watching the students file in. The rest of the faces are familiar: Slughorn, Trelawney, Flitwick, Merryweather, Hagrid. Hagrid is waving his huge palms animatedly as Flitwick attempts to keep his goblet out of range. Harry is filled with a sudden but staggering rush of warmth. Home. He’s
, as Malfoy said). And he definitely can’t do as he pleases when he has no clue what would please him.
“Hey! I make my bed! Sometimes—”
The crease between Hermione’s brows relaxes. “Oh, you won’t believe who they’ve hired as the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor this year. He’s incredibly distinguished—he wrote the book I was telling you about the other day…”
Harry has to agree. He shrugs when Hermione shoots him a beseeching look. “Malfoy hasn’t changed, Hermione. We’ve barely been here two seconds and he’s already picked a fight.”
“I’m not missing—what do you—Harry agrees with me! He said so last night! Come on, Hermione, he’s a
The room is carefully devoid of house colors, despite the Slytherin-esque snakes on the door. A stormy gray peaks out from behind dozens upon dozens of framed landscape images. Harry makes out a blue-toned painting of a coastal town and what looks like a black and white illustration of a lopsided mushroom. He doesn’t see any portraits, thankfully; at least the room can remain somewhat of a respite from watching eyes. Somehow, he doesn’t think Goyle will ask for an autograph any time soon. He’d probably rather snog the Giant Squid.
Before Harry could retort or drive a fist through Malfoy’s face (it was growing likelier by the moment), Professor McGonagall’s voice rings out.
he here? Where is he going on the first night of term if he isn’t in bed? Worth investigating, if you ask me.”
"Gentlemen!" Andromeda interrupted in a calm tone, and instantly the two bickering boys fell silent. Wrapping her child back into the blankets, she then left the bed and gestured towards the fireplace, where she expanded the two chairs into sofas. Claiming one, she invited Severus to sit beside her, before she demanded. "You will start your explanation at the beginning: the battle of Hogwarts."
"Oh, Master-Draco-Sir …"
"What?" It now was Harry and Neville's turn to gape, until Alexander and Charles pushed them forward.
"We are here to access my parents' vault." Harry's voice was barely above a whisper, yet the goblin seemed to understand him just fine, turning around. Studying the three, he then instructed, "In that case, follow me, Mr Potter. There is a lot we have to talk about."
"In that case, Mrs Granger, you are free to go. You will receive my report - including the estimated date when you get it back - by Monday morning the latest."
"Thank you."
George and Angelina were next, and the girls instantly challenged each other over the strangest combinations of food. It seemed that the dark-skinned woman had not reached the craving's stage, yet. However, she appeared concerningly interested in a few of Hermione's favourites.
"I want to see if I can wake the Gargoyles," Luna decided, wandering out and Neville joined her. "I'll start on the vegetable garden behind the kitchen."
Turning away with a shrug, the raven-haired auror bound their latest suspects with a flicker of his wand. But one of Neville’s most outstanding qualities was his patience. Had to be when his greatest joy was growing things. So, Harry knew this discussion was far from over.
When Severus did as told – by a Potter of all people – the young parselmage fastened a leather-cuff around his wrist, prompting, "Close it yourself. While it has a 'notice-me-not' woven into it, I used a modified slave-charm on the closure." At the former Death Eater's alarmed look, Harry appeased him, "It's really only just one component: only the person who closes the cuff can open it again. That should ensure that nobody can take this protection from you, without your consent. Hermione's and Ron's work the same way."
"And," the man emphasised, "you run around all day … cha … chasing … besting Dark Wizards. Appar … Obviously, you revel in your power!"
Taking a steeling breath, the two Gryffindors headed for their former professor's room. "Sir, may we come in?"
After a few minutes, Draco replied, "A family. But my child could hardly be considered 'his' family. It is not as if we are …" He sighed dejectedly.
"Tea?" Severus offered, now looking at the other wizard.
"At this time and in this place,
"Thank you." The Auror breathed out, sagging when a tension that had held him upright until this very moment vanished for a heartbeat. Draco did not mirror him. "Do you have an empty vial?"
Finishing her spell, smiling at the photographic evidence of her grandson's adoration for his godfather, the elderly witch replied unperturbed, "You can't afford to sue me, Harry Potter." She had become aware of the muggle technique of expressing someone's ire when Harry had uttered the empty threat the first time, a drooling Teddy chewing on his robe making an adorable picture for the child's photo album. In her opinion, nothing beat a swift hex to make one's displeasure known. Still, she had begun to enjoy their little game, so she always replied appropriately.
"But …" True, languages were powerful and Latin the most versatile to suit the European witches and wizards' needs. However, chances were good that Andromeda was right, so … "We'll try alone then."
Looking down, Harry paled, and his fingers started trembling. "No … NO! … I left this in the woods for a reason! I can't … no one should have this. It's too dangerous!"
"But human sacrifices?" Ron doubted, leaning over the back of her chair. "I'm not saying it's unlikely, just entirely unreasonable."
"What is it? I know that look!"
"What about you, Dragon?" the child, pulled the trousers of the blond wizard. "Will you come?"
Remembering Harry's take on that particular subject, Severus replied drily, "It was a group effort. But this is not about gratitude. Harry is so much more than Lily. You could never understand. But I will be damned before I let you or anybody else take advantage of him, ever again!" And with that, the man turned around and stormed back to his room.
"Well," the pureblood rose. "We might not be able to do much, but at least I can try to make his job easier by helping to outlaw these 'Children of Hecate'. If he has his colleagues at his back, and these fanatics off the streets, he will be a little better protected."
"I would not worry too much," Draco commented absent-mindedly. "I switched your Arabian blend to decaf."
"What can Gringotts do for you?" A nasty looking goblin glanced down at Harry and Severus as they stepped up to the teller's stand.
loving him …"
Narrowing his eyes at her, he refused to reply.
"And you shall have it!" Draco promised while they walked back to the Nashi Pear Tree, after an unsuccessful visit to the shop.
"I am."
--O-O--
She had to have faith. Harry would find her family, and everything would be fine. She had to believe that, otherwise she would go insane.
"That's great, little man. Why don't you go back so I can step through and you can tell me all about it in person?"
"Thus forcing me to meet her at the Ministry to get it back," Harry rolled his eyes with a tiny smile. "Incidentally convincing me to join her for a line-up of possible subjects, to identify possible cultists."
One who cared for virtually anything
"Would we …," the goblin drew out, looking around but nodded after a heartbeat. "Very well, let
I know this sets a dangerous precedent, three chapters in three weeks, but the chapter is ready and I'm on a writing flash. So enjoy :)
"New?" Harry asked.
Pondering that, Harry concluded, "So, someone had to see to her needs. Someone who has been able to pass through the Fidelius unimpeded."
"No, I …" looking around, at all the things they had not inspected yet, Harry had decided. "Maybe just a little longer."
"Sir?" As he was used to, Harry only gave a short knock before opening the door. Yet before he could barge in, he froze and closed it again. "May I come in?"
"Yes," the former Lord's son sneered viciously. "It 'was intended', but through … certain channels …"
Jenkins had paled when Harry had mentioned Tom’s chosen name and nodded compassionately before he noticed his colleagues glare once again. “Yes, … I mean, no, … I mean I’ll provide the supplies.”
"You are late."
Grinning, the young wizard wanted to know, "How is Alicia?"
"Well, we did have a successful break-in a few years back, where the thieves escaped with a priceless artefact."
Harry could actually hear a tiny chuckle from her when Draco growled at that. "You said 'had'."
"Come here, love." Narcissa held out her hand for him and pulled him down to the sofa. "You have to understand a few things, Harry. Ancient wards are almost always stronger than new ones, but the Fidelius Charm is the strongest protection there is. Your father did everything in his power to keep you and your mother safe. Peter Pettigrew was not an evil man; he was just weak. Our Lord … Tom," she corrected herself after a moment, "was terrifying and not many people were brave enough to stand up to him. Your parents were exceptional, as was your godfather. Peter Pettigrew was just … normal."
Contrite, Harry followed. He needed some time to shrug off his dark thoughts. Lucius had done horrible things, there was no denying that. But he was trying to make amends. That was more than Harry could say about 90% of the Death Eaters still out there. "What should we do now?"
−−O−O−−
Smiling, the former Gryffindor glanced at the 'Saviour', who seemed at times still surprised that people had his back and replied softly, "I'll be your partner for as long as you need one. Now finish your report. I shudder to think about what Minister Shacklebolt and Professor Snape can come up with if they are left alone for too long."
"Not before he's through."
Touching the blond's arm, Harry reminded him, "He's awake now and getting better. You don't have to work yourself to the bones, Draco."
One blink and what the older wizard hoped to be a death glare.

"Why are you here, Lovegood?"
Grinning, Neville and Harry traded a glance, before answering in one voice, "Because it's Luna!"
Teddy spent the afternoon chatting briefly with Neville over the floo, before retreating to the library to study - as he seriously told the boys - the old Herbology schoolbooks generations of Blacks have accumulated over the years. With help, he cut the old and shrivelled fruits they had gathered, washed out the seeds and laid them on a towel to dry. However, when Draco called him to dinner, the usually so active child was quiet and contemplative.
Nodding, the young Auror picked up the diagnostic scroll once again. "It says your collarbone is partially fractured. It could heal naturally, the fracture isn't deep. But if you're up for it, I could try to heal it."
Looking up uncertainly, the boy shook his head.
"Wards has being hurting you?" Emerald had inquired concerned, her small fingers brushing over the abrasions on Severus' wrists.
"If this works out the way we plan, it will make us even," she stated calmly, and Draco could only agree.
All his life, the patriarch of the Malfoy family had learned to only submit to power. Yet after choosing the wrong side, the former Lord was willing to bow to someone with less money, less social standing − apart from fame − and maybe even less magical power, because he finally understood. There were more important things in life than power. With but a little ambition, Harry Potter would be able to become the leader of their world, and though Lucius doubted that the young wizard had an accordant desire, their world would surely be better off with him as Minister of Magic.
"Oh, Arthur, look," Molly exclaimed excited, lifting the last and by far biggest present from under the tree. "This one is for us!"
"No, I am the son of James Potter, and in a way, I think that is even worse."
Now, Harry studied the product of an hour-long writing effort, where Severus had practised the same fifteen words over and over until he had not felt humiliated to share the outcome of his pathetically rusty writing skills. It was considerably better than at the beginning, but still nowhere near his old ability. Now he prepared himself for being mocked for his pathetic attempts.
Pressing his lips together, the young Auror nodded. "Alright, let us begin."
"No," the raven-haired admitted, "I am not entirely sure, so we still should get Ruby to talk. But if not, … I don't have a good feeling to put all of our eggs in one basket … you know … but …"
"No!" Harry protested forcefully, his face turning a flaming shade of red. "Please, don't," he begged weakly.
"What makes you say that? You know that my offer for you to stay here does not come with an expiration date. And you only have to say a word for me to release you from your vow."
(See the end of the chapter for
"No, 'for me', really. Thomson agreed on him having valuable insight but insisted on me being responsible for everything he does. We signed a non-disclosure agreement; a magically binding one! So, when the spell went off, Lucius became the target of two conflicting compulsions. You know how dangerous that is. Also, he was hurt under my care.
Reasonably, she stated, "I understand that you wish to pick up your trade again. Brewing has always been your passion. But I am telling you, your body is not ready to handle hours in the lab as of now. Yes, you are out of bed, and that is an amazing improvement. But you either sit here or in the garden. What would happen if you had a dizzy spell in front of a simmering cauldron?"
"Bastard!" Harry growled, barely resisting the urge to slam the office door shut.
Neville Longbottom had risen to the challenges Hogwarts had had in store for him and his classmates during the last year of the Dark Lord's reign. He had become a leader, a protector, more knowledgeable in the ways of magic than Harry Potter could ever hope to be - simply because the boy had grown up in their world. With his courage and his defiance, Snape could have seen him defying Voldemort, had the dice fallen differently that fateful night. Still, he had not expected the young wizard to find him in the back yard, and now he was more than a little apprehensive. After all, he
'That's not true!' Harry wanted to throw out, but he could not because … because it would be a lie. For years, … nearly an entire decade, he had been told that destroying Voldemort was
that happened, he would be ready!
"Don't worry," she smirked weakly. "Molly will be back any moment. She just stepped out to get Draco some food."
Laughing, because his little raven-haired brother could not be more wrong, the twin shook his head empathically. "I was ecstatic! You have to understand. Freddie and I were tricksters, pranking people left and right, bullshitting our way out of trouble. But when we were alone, we were always honest with each other. Fred said what I needed to hear because apart from you last night, nobody ever dared to call me out on the shit I have done. Not even Lee, and while he gave me massive pointers, he always makes sure not to come between my family and me.
Squeezing his fingers, Hermione then prompted, "Then let's get back to the others. These drinks are getting warm."
"Baby is not bonded yet!" The elf spat out with vicious defensiveness. "Kreacher was afraid Master would set her free!"
"And do what?" Harry asked drily. "I have had the darkest wizard of all time out for my blood pretty much since I was one. What exactly can anybody do that would live up to that?"
poison himself once a month if bad comes to worse?"
Biting his lips, Harry stared down at the uneven words.
With a tired sigh, the Lady Malfoy started, "We could go over it in detail, but what you really want to know is how long Astoria has before the damage becomes irreversible."
"No," Teddy admitted, prompting Draco to crouch down beside him.
"No," Neville shook his head. "I mean the ones that were woven into the building upon its construction. They are tied to the cornerstone."
Shrugging, the pureblood reached for a biscuit. "I'll take it. It's not as if I really had a choice anyway."
Softly, Harry chided, "The day Draco's house arrest is over, he will gain full access to the Malfoy Family Vaults, worth about a hundred times of yours if you include all financial assets. Can you imagine him taking this from you, no matter if it was meant for him or not?"
Docile, the blond did as told and tilted up his face. Harry had never done this before, had only ever watched Ginny, so he was not sure how much pressure to apply. Gently, too gently at first, he wiped over Draco's eye. He needed three tries to get it right when finally, the black liner started to come off. "Am I hurting you?"
"Actually," Christopher Pendragon explained, "My line descends from both. Merlin was the last Dragon-Lord, and the 'Pendragons' descended from an ancient clan of warriors-chieftains. Their magic was weak, I mean squib-level weak, but it was there. So together Arthur and Merlin were able to create a new bloodline. We are bound to this library, the guardians of these treasures and usually one member per generation feels the call of the sword. If he or she can pick it up, they become the new librarian."
"I have a … request, Harry."
"Great." Looking up at his friends, especially at Hermione who nodded encouragingly, Harry demanded, "Now I want you to tell me what the fuck is going on! Something happened the day of my accident, and I want to know what is wrong with you!"
When she did not offer any additional information, Harry could not help but ask, "What changed?"
"Well, 'fierce', of course," the raven−haired grinned, before turning towards his godson. "Isn't that right, Teddy? Hera's dragon was very fierce."
"I have given you free reign in my library. But now I need you to go through all of these and research any form of antivenom and antidote mentioned."
In his short life, Harry had learned to better be cautious. All of his cautions fled from his mind, when he entered his living room, realising that 'wetting' did not refer to tears, but the blood Astoria was spilling. The silky grey night-gown she was wearing was spotted with blood around her lower body-region. When he fell to his knees beside her, the young woman curled tighter into herself, whimpering quietly. Unsure if he was allowed to touch, Harry, whispered, "It's alright, Astoria. You are safe now. You are at Grimmauld Place. Rosier can't get to you as long as you are here."
Looking halfway decent, Harry repeated, "That's the only bag Kreacher gave me." Shaking his head, since it should have occurred to him that he was one overnight-bag short, he called out, "Kreacher!"
The injured man had drifted in and out of consciousness, with his owl perching at the edge of the backrest, like some silent guardian. Would Draco be sent away as well? He had not wanted to listen in on the quarrel, but when his father had left the office to return to the Manor, the man had looked pale and barely in control. It had uncomfortably reminded Draco of the last time the former Death Eater had been around the Dark Lord. Still, he had kissed Draco's forehead and imposed on him to 'be good' before he had left.
He lowered his wand, trembling slightly, before sinking into his chair. “You shouldn’t have done this,” he whispered. “I did not invite you into my home to have you take up house-elf duties. You too, deserve better than that.”
"Draco!"
"I … you …," the young man stammered, but the young witch simply steamrolled him. "Don't worry, I'll file my report tomorrow morning the latest. See you around eight." Then she simply slammed the door in his face.
"'Was' being the operative word in this sentence," the blond agreed, slipping onto the windowsill to savour his prize. "Have you shown him the picture, yet?"
Staggering out of the floo, stabilizing Harry, Draco turned around to reach for the raven haired's bag, but Ginny merely shook her head. "Don't bother. I'll bring them upstairs and dash out to get his potions. You wrestle him onto a couch somewhere and make sure he stays put."
Someone shaking him roused Harry from his sleep. Blinking awake, he noticed Kreacher standing a foot away from him, duvet already in hand. Looking at the sleeping man, Harry sighed. “I’m coming.”
"Isa cannot bring a shower, but me can clean Miss up." With a snap of her fingers, Hermione felt squeaky clean. Even her hair seemed to have been washed. "Isa is returning with tea soon."
"Ahm … okay? How do I do that?"
Again, the elves traded a glance but didn't say anything.
"There was a funeral!" Neville stated disbelieving.
"The … invisibility cloak."
Potter maybe?
"Because there is one thing librarians are better at than anybody else: conducting research! But to do so, you need to have the right sources at hand."
Once the pureblood had returned to the Manor, the raven-haired rubbed the bridge of his nose, repeating to himself, like a mantra, "He's trying. He's trying. He's trying."
--O-O--
−−O−O−−
Doubtful, Pince considered, "Hermione Granger has been abducted, is two thirds through her pregnancy, and you expect her to be able to do enough magic for you to locate her?"
"Same difference." His father struggled with a bunch of flowers that did not seem inclined to move. "I was curious, so here I am. But a bigger picture in this room would certainly be appreciated."
Not having slept as peacefully as had become the habit in Grimmauld Place, the Malfoy family sipped an early tea not long after dawn, when Harry stumbled through the front door. His hair was unruly, even more so than usual, and his robes appeared frayed at the edges. The toll this night had taken was visible on his face. His pale complexion made his blood-shot eyes stand out even more. Gaze gliding past his guests, Harry did not seem to be all there, but he wolfed down the sweet-smelling porridge Kreacher had placed in front of him before stumbling out of the kitchen.
Prepared for his shift of vision, Harry let the stone fall into his open palm. He met the loving gaze of his mother, mirroring her smile before some movement in the corner of his eyes drew his attention. A mousy haired teenager was cowering there. His nervous eyes darted from Sirius to James to Lily and then to Remus, who was standing at the bedside as well. Something in the boy's aborted movement felt familiar, but the young Auror could not place it. Then it hit him. Furiously, he drew his wand, "What the hell is Wormtail doing here? He has no right …!"
Gazing into his cup, the raven-haired pondered that suggestion. If it saved him money, it was worth looking into. But he had to find a way to ensure that all wards were up to standard. He needed to accommodate Astoria and a potential baby. He would not … could not take any risks with the Malfoy heir.
"Blimey," Ron paled, "The kids must have driven mum spare by now!"
"Maybe the son is more jealous than the wife?"
After a moment of hesitation, Lucius looked at his son, who chuckled at Teddy's antics, before decidedly turning towards Harry. "Thank you."
"Excuse me?"
"Harry?" He could hear the concern in Draco's tone when the blond was forced to watch his shadow sway, but Harry brushed off his companion's worry. "I'm fine. Astoria, how do you feel?"
"Rosier!" Daphne spat out. "Who else?"
The problem was, in front of him was nothing but stone.
"And lied to our Lord's face for nearly two decades before he was killed. Courage, cunning or cowardice are no exclusive traits for any house."
No gushing, no glee, barely any emotion from the boy, bar a determined efficiency.
Draco
"And every support you can give Hermione will increase your standing in the Department of Law."
"Sir?"
Reluctant, the young man heaved himself out of the chair. Since he felt ready to topple over, he merely offered a weak, "Good Night, Sir … I mean Severus and thank you."
"Sap," Zabini judged, throwing a pillow at the redhead.
"Heaven and Earth," Harry whipped around, wand ready. "Do you
Nodding reluctantly, because no matter how little Harry liked it, he thought Draco to be right, he assured the blond. "He won't get the chance. You know that Draco, don't you? You're mine, and I protect those under my care."
"Please tell me you are not serious." Draco looked around, judging the worn-down interior of the tent, Bill Weasley had pointed him, Harry, Ron and Hermione towards.
When the elf reluctantly trudged down the stairs, Narcissa went over her options for a moment, before resolutely opening the door. She vaguely remembered this room. It had been her aunt Walburga's salon, once upon a time. Now it resembled a pig−stall. Every available surface was littered with bottles. The whole room smelled of stale alcohol and magic. A lot of magic! To the pureblood it felt like the very air in the room was charged, making every hair on her body stand up. Once passing the threshold, she realised that the magic was concentrated on the carpet that covered an entire wall. Studying the family−tree, she found her own family, even her son and, of course, the main branch with the Lady Walburga Black, the family matriarch and her children. Except … one child was missing. The charred edges of the fabric, where Sirius' name ought to be, were ugly and repellent. When she touched them, a spark of the stored magic zapped her finger, making her hiss in surprise. Instantly a dark matron emerged in one of the paintings and screeched, "Take your hands away from my family tree, you insolent, little thing!"
"Tactical thinking. Hermione would be proud of you."
--O-O--
Abandoning the kitchen, Severus cast a disillusionment charm before approaching the room. What he heard made him feel cold all over.
The couple had not even needed to look at each other. "Yes." "Of course." It carried the Potter-crest, but neither cared.
"I won't!" Teddy squeaked excitedly, bouncing up and down, his hair turning from strawberry blond to an excited fire-red. With Harry's help, they conjured a second set of stirrups for the Nimbus and off Draco and Teddy were.
"No, but as I said, the herbal soothers I take help me to sleep through the night undisturbed."
Contrary to his usually self-assured behaviour, Kreacher cowered before his Master, wailing dejectedly, "Kreacher is sorry, Master. Kreacher knows this task is important. That Master Draco is important! But me couldn't … Kreacher couldn't …" He started to pull on his ears, violently.
Trading a look, Harry and Ron nodded with conviction, "Absolutely!"
The next moment, the door was opened again, after but one, timid knock. The assistant from before slipped in, sharing fearfully, "I'm sorry, Auror Longbottom, but I can't find Mrs Granger-Weasley. They told me that she left around two to get a snack, but never returned."
"By 'family portrait', you mean a painting of your parents. And by 'a house's wards' you are thinking about Grimmauld Place?"
" Harry and Neville hushed their colleague, despite their wards. "That's not public knowledge!"
"As I have already shared, my financial situation is quite stable. But I do not plan on imposing on my sister indefinitely. I need a place to stay, a new home, where …"
"Voldemort. Happy now?"
"Which books are missing?" Lucius inquired, sensing a pattern.
Five hellish days had passed, and things got worse instead of better. Severus still could not form words, exceeding one syllable abbreviations. The disgustingly persistent medi-witch, however, insisted persistently that he was doing great.
Draco's eyes flew up to meet intense black ones.
"But India?" The twin handed over the flute and the elaborate travelling plans to his wife, who shrieked, "A month! Ginny! This must have cost you an arm and a leg."
"I know," his mother smiled, getting the picture. "However, your Hemione is not the 'usual' girl."
And though that was comforting yet no guarantee for success, Molly very well knew that she could not stop her children. Ron had been willing to follow Harry, ever since their first year. And Hermione … well, she had always been the brain of their operations. Harry needed her; needed his best friends to save the one he loved. If she were entirely honest to herself, were Arthur in danger, she would do exactly the same.
"Alice?" Harry piped up.
"But he is hovering on the brink," the Bloody Baron concluded.
"Alexander Pince? Is he related to Mdm Pince?" Hermione wanted to know.
Opening the latch for the central heating, the young man grinned sheepishly, before taking to his own beverage.
Quietly, Lucius interrupted Harry’s train of thought. “Not for the lack of evidence. If you so wish, you could send me back to Azkaban in a heartbeat and lock me away for good.”
Harry did not like the approving look Narcissa gave her future daughter-in-law, nor the appreciative nod she offered Draco. "From what my son has told me, the price for your cooperation is your own vault and autonomy."
Slowly getting up, the Auror folded his napkin, Narcissa had trained him into using, taking a perverse pleasure in Draco paling, and backing up. However, as soon as Harry entered his office, seeing the mounting files about a smuggling ring that dealt in unicorn-blood, he screamed and shoved the entire stack off his desk. His pencil cup and tea-set followed. Harry was breathing hard, when Neville entered the office a minute later, kettle in hand.
Definitions:
Surprised, Harry wanted to know, "How do you know how old I was when I produced my first Patronus, Spinnet?" As far as he knew, nobody had ever shared that particular detail with the press.
A circle completed the symbol. But Lucius shook his head with emphasis, "The Resurrection Stone is a myth!
Nodding gravely, Neville continued, "Nobody has to tell you these things. You just know. And if you do them anyway, sooner or later, the whole world turns against you."
Worried, Harry wanted to know, "Why do you think you will be in danger?"
Unexpectedly, Harry looked earnestly into Alexander's eyes and admitted, "Yes." Then he returned his attention to the Head Auror. "But that is entirely beside the point. She can potentially help us, so I would like to bring her in."
"It was," the Ex-Death-Eater sighed. "It's not okay, … I still have nightmares, but … but it's better than before. So, I guess, what I want to say is, thank you … thank you, Harry."
"It does not have to be big to cover a great surface." Bill lectured. "Think a glass of water. Even one cup can soak an entire table."
Surprised, Narcissa asked, "How can you say that? I have seen you change your hair a dozen times today."
"It is not." Astoria acknowledged.
get better, for that to happen."
"I'm afraid the floo of the Manor is heavily restricted," Narcissa admitted, but the wizard merely pulled out his sword and grinned. Offering his hand, he guided her to a fireplace that was protected by huge metal doors. It opened at a mere gesture, revealing an impressive setup with a convenient pot of floo-powder just within reach.
Harry placed the first aid kit on the small table by the fire and started inspecting its content. "The small white jar?" He inquired.
back in time without him knowing. In front of him stood Daphne Greengrass and her colleague Mr Fairchild. The wizard was reciting from his seemingly ever-present scroll, "Today, at 1:32 p.m. the Department of Magical Law Enforcement has registered the use of magic at Malfoy Manor. Since …"
"Because you were in coma!"
"Because," Hermione lectured, sounding so much like her younger self, that Harry had to smile, despite the dire situation, "Whatever they are planning: it won't happen in a sealed room. One way or the other, they will have to get him out. As soon as Draco leaves the wards, we can either get him back or join him."
"Where can I …?" She inquired, red tinting her cheeks.
Handing over Rose, when she made grabby hands for her dad, Harry sank down on the couch beside his best friends and started to rub Hemione's shins. Blissfully, the witch closed her eyes. "If we want to get it into the heads of the people that even Death Eaters can be redeemed, we have to put the Malfoys on display. Share all the good they have done, …"
Chuckling wetly, Hermione shook her head, safe in the comfortable embrace of her two best friends. "Definitely not."
"Well, he is the last remaining heir of the Black family and therefore the head of my house, since Lucius has entered the Rite of Compulsory Surrender with him."
"We will take the library of Hogwarts," Neville decided. "I wanted to go there this afternoon anyway."
Chewing at her bottom lip, Hermione nodded.
When Harry knocked on Draco's bedroom a few minutes later, he received no reply. Opening the door just an inch, he noticed the room to be empty. Looking for his companion, Harry found the blond in the lab, staring at the blackboard. It was filled with equations and gibberish symbols the Auror had no hope to decipher. After a few moments, he spoke up, "Draco?"
"And you are really okay with that?"
"You want to," she stated easily, looking up at the man who, once upon a time had captured and tormented her.
"Definitely the black one."
"Make sure to adjust the heat." Harry looked to the boy, his voice was
"Young Georgie, why are you being so hostile?"
." Zabini elbowed him.
Rolling his eyes, Draco replied, "Oh don't get you're knickers in twist, Granger. He gives as good as he gets. Plus, I think he enjoys our little spats. Keeps him entertained."
Draco swallowed thickly before beginning again, “Sirens, Harry…”
Granger was quiet for a moment, looking at Draco thoughtfully. “Would it be possible for me to meet Léon?”
The hand traveled up to Harry's shoulder, "It's okay Harry. We are just going to the infirmary."
Beck spoke up first, "We cannot get the door open. We have tried everything we can think of magical and non."
“Doctor Way should be here soon, Harry.” Hampton whispered.
Draco turned to him, propping himself up, "Hell no? You lived with them for years before coming to the wizard world, didn't you?"
Draco quickly hide the small jar behind his back.
"He just said my name."
She put a hand on Harry's shoulder, giving it a light squeeze, "Just promise me I'll be your maid of honor."
Draco eyed the panther for a moment before stepping to the side, getting closer to the blue light. "You know, I used to work with dragons, years ago. They were very large and mighty beast. Extremely powerful in both physicality and magical ways, but you, kitty, seem to be one of the most powerful creatures I have ever had the pleasure of meeting if you were able to do all you have done tonight."
They both stood up and stretched out their limbs. They grabbed their things, and began walking towards the hotel, talking about the lighter, fun things that have happened over the years.
Draco placed his signature sneer on, "I believe you know why I am here?"
Harry stopped speaking the moment he realize what he said, looking at Malfoy with an
Once arriving to Draco's door, they both began flushing.
"Hermione, it's not suicide. I'm just going down to a little village, in a little island, just to get away."
He would ask down by the lake.
A loud stroke of lightening made everyone jump and stare out the window.
"You're an idiot. You do know that right?"
It started small: going to get groceries, eating lunch with friends at a restaurant. At first everything was going smoothly, he would go out to eat with friends, shop for a couple of hours and not be bothered too much by other witches or wizards. He of course would get a few stares but he had grown used to them over the years. After a few days however, the questions started to come. Reporters, publishers, random people on the streets wouldn't leave him alone. He tried talking to them nicely, then meanly, then so mean he thought they were going to give him a one-way ticket to Azkaban, but to no avail. They didn't care. They wouldn't let him just be. They didn't care how he felt or how uncomfortable he was, they wanted answers and would stop at nothing to get them. So, when he finally had enough, he sheltered himself again. He only left for quick trips to the grocers or to see friends at their homes. Anything else he needed, he ordered by owl or persuaded Hermione or Ron to get it for him.
So, like previously mentioned, Draco was at a complete and utter stand still.
"We aren't very certain why Mister Malfoy has these.. gifts," McGonagal spoke up, "But we know there isn't much we can do to stop them. Mister Malfoy has been lucky to have people in his life to help him through this time."
is here.
"Well!" A loud voice boomed. Harry spun around so fast he got dizzy and almost dropped the box. Standing behind the counter was a short old man wearing tan suspenders, a white button down shirt and had on a green poker hat. He grabbed something next to him and began to walking around the counter.
Parkinson leaned back against the tree, looking up at the leaves, "Normally that would be enough but seeing as you are a Gryffindor and, oh, I don't know, the bloody
They laughed quietly. After a few moments they decided to retire back to their rooms, planning to meet again after breakfast tomorrow.
"That and much, much worse." Draco took a deep sip of water, "There is a reason Slytherins keep to themselves. None of us want our deep, dark secretes getting out."
George raised an eyebrow, taking the sucker out of his mouth, "Yes?"
She let out another laugh, this one sounding a little more real. "Yeah, I guess they aren't, hm?" She crossed her arms over her chest before directing her attention to the stack of books on the coffee table. "I have been trying to look through a few more books, but things have been hectic around here so I haven't had much time to focus on it, I'm sorry."
Through the two and a half years he worked with the dragons, he slowly felt himself becoming addicted to the sensations of the adrenaline pumping through his body and mind every time he came close to the creatures. Addicted to the feel of their own magic flowing around Draco and his own. For the first time since the war began, he felt alive again. And he loved the feeling. Nearly five years since his first encounter with a dragon, Draco finds himself working for an un-official-official corporation, now some-what funded by the Ministry, known as
When Harry emerged back out the room, glasses placed on his face, he wasn't surprise to find Malfoy waiting for him. He was surprised, however, by the joy that seeing him still standing there gave Harry.
When Draco walked out the front door of the hotel clutching his guitar case, he felt his heart swell so big it felt like it was going to pop. Standing in the middle of the driveway, looking up towards the sky with his eyes closed, was the boy who has held Draco's heart for as long as he could remember. His eyes began to water, not because he was scared like before, but because the sheer
Malfoy backed away slowly, almost tripping over his bag, before stuttering out an apology and rushing out the room, leaving the potion and all of Draco's belonging for Harry to take care of.
After getting over the surprise of the question, Draco smiled softly at Harry, "Well, I have always had a love for music growing up." He sighed, wondering if he should go into detail. Figuring it wouldn't matter either way, he dove into his explanation, "At the balls my parents used to throw I remember always being so fascinated at the musicians they had, specifically the pianist. I remember one pianist my father hired was exceptionally talented. That man could play piano in his sleep. One day he arrived early and began to teach me a few things. He played for us a few times after that and often would teach me a little bit before the guest arrived.. but one day he just stopped arriving early, and then he stopped arriving at all." He paused for a moment with a far away look, "I asked my father about why he stopped coming and all he said was, '
Before he could, the door to the office flew open, a mess of bushy hair flying through it and slamming it as soon as she could.
Harry's mouth, which had dried completely from his nerves, began to water at the thought. "Yes, definitely. I need to stop and grab my glasses real quick."
Their uncle smiled sweetly at both of them, "Well, well, isn't this a sight to see both of you here. Tell me, George, how was the shop? Any guest?"
Pansy looked at the two dress shirts Draco held up to the computer. One was a plan grey with a darker grey zigzagging down the shirt and a small pocket, the other was a black button down that was made out of a mixture of cotton and silk.
"Hold up," Hampton butted in, "He went
Draco slowly placed the water by the food dish and lowered his wand. "Good morning." He said brightly.
When Harry looked back towards his table mate, there was a look of astonishment in his eyes, with a bit of confusion as well. Looking into Malfoy's steel colored eyes, Harry felt as if he was standing by a blazing fire, with heat lapping at his skin. He felt drawn to the boy, not able to see anything,
Harry nodded, not trusting this man with the knowledge that he had the necklace.
The foot steps that were heading towards the stalls froze for a second. "Hey, Potter. Are you okay?"
Harry turned towards the other women in the room, "So.. can I see him now?"
Thomas shrugged, "'The caged ones finally have caged the un-cage-able.'" Draco turned to look at the other man with a quirked eyebrow. "That's what they kept saying."
. I have you. You are mine, Draco. You are
With a shrug, Draco quickly responded, "No, but I am pretty good at holding my own, just ask Potter."
. What the
Draco stood at the front desk, looking over a few different pamphlets. Most were about the island layout and things you can do on it, a few about the wildlife that was found around the island, and one of the tiny cafe he and Harry visited.
His uncle raised his eyebrows before furling them together, "Both of them? Together?"
, his eyes.."
The man smirked up at him, "You know I wouldn't disturb you at this hour unless it was, boss."
Closing the door to his dressing room, Draco sighed. He loved the life he has made for himself. Sure, it isn't the level he wants it to be yet, but he loves it. Gigs every other night, little shows here and there. Writing new and exciting music and pieces. It's a dream life.
A deeply familiar voice sounded out.
Every student watched the exchange on the edge of their seats, waiting to see who would speak next.
"An eskimo kiss." Draco did it again, Harry scrunched up his nose, "Have you never had one before?"
Unlike in his youth, Draco Malfoy now hates being seen. Which looking at his career choice, seems very strange. Ever since graduation all Draco has wanted to do was disappear, but he knew that wasn't realistic. So, instead of disappearing entirely, he chose to travel the muggle world, writing music and learning of cultures he never knew existed. Over the past few years he has come to respect muggles and their crafty way. They were able to do some incredible things with only two hand and no magic. Draco still doesn't understand a lot of muggles and their strange ways, but he respects it all the same.
Draco nodded and lied back down, "What time do you think it is?"
Harry shrugged, "Maybe he left by accident and didn't realize it."
Zabini snorted, "Yeah, definitely no love there."
Harry sat throwing daggers at the man. His tone was way too flirty, his eyes were way too dreamy and Harry wanted them off of his boyfriend's form immediately.
As he grew closer to the park, he noticed the largest tree he has ever seen in his life. It was the height of a basic oak tree, but it's trunk was so large someone could build a tiny home in it. The green leaves at the top were so bright and so densely packed, not an empty hole was in sight, that it seemed like it was hand drawn. White and yellow flowers decorated the top of the tree, snuggling against the leaves tightly.
Draco continued to stare at him, "You.. did that on purpose?"
Draco went to grab it to get a closer look when Harry suddenly hissed, dropping it to the ground, "The fucker just burned the shit out of me."
Another voice whispered.
Draco ran a hand through Harry's messy hair, Harry closing his eyes with a soft sigh. With-in moments, the exhaustion of the day caught up to him and he fell asleep.
"Mr. Draco is that you?" A voice shouted out of the car.
He finally found it hiding between the bed frame and the wall.
Harry thought.
Instead of standing like all the others, Draco leaned further into Harry. "Let's stay for just a minute longer." He whispered.
Harry swallowed thickly, nodded a little too erratically.
Too tired to argue, Draco nodded.
Harry smiled softly, "We do have a lot of baggage don't we?"
"Léon.." Draco warned.
George's eyes drew closer, "Because you old diff-dimbo, after they left the store I nearly tore the place apart looking for the
They walked hand-in-hand down to the same bus stop as earlier, taunting and giggling the whole way.
Harry adjusted the heat and waited for the turquoise color to show. When it finally did, Harry added the doxy eggs.
Draco's eyes went wide as he stepped closer to the boy. Before he could get to the boy, Draco's vision faltered, then he was catapulted back into the dim corridor of the
Harry switched the water off and leaned against the sink, willing the cold, emptiness he felt in his chest to go away.
He looked towards Harry to tell him his concern, when he realized the shelves that lined the walls, each had many jars and vials of
"Aw, what is poor Stori doing now?" Pansy fiend interest.
anymore). Dean Thomas, Seamus Finnigan, Neville Longbottom, Lavender Brown, and Parvati Patil, just to name a few, had all returned. Another reminder of how things have changed was the notable absence of his ginger-haired best friend, Ron. Ron had decided to skip on the Eighth Year opportunity to instead help his older brother, George, run his joke shop,
Harry thought for a moment, "I think.. I think I should be the one to tell him. I'll Floo him tonight or tomorrow, depending on how this is about to go."
While Harry was having an epic breakdown on the floor of a bathroom stall, it seemed like the whole island had filled the bar.
Draco lounged on the couch, placing the laptop on his stomach, "No, I don't want him. I may have had a small crush on him in school but that's all it was. A teeny tiny crush. Why would anyone like him with his stupid face, stupid scar, stupid eyes, stupid-"
Draco gave him a look that clearly stated
Pansy rubbed his arm, "I know. I wish I had answers instead of questions, my love. Like, how where you there? You said he saw you and talked to you but how? Do you think.. do you think your gift grew? Maybe you have some form of Astral Projection now?"
his mate, I know we will be seeing a lot of each other. Draco is my best friend and has been for a long time. I would take a bullet for him, only that statement actually means something for someone like me. I don't trust you, not at all, but Draco seems to. If he wants you in his life, then I can live with you sometimes being in mine too."
Hermione's eyes seem to have glazed over slightly. "You know I love you, Harry. I love you no matter who you fancy or love or care for.. but how can- how did you get pass all the things he has done to us? To you?"
George's smiled widened, showing both sets of teeth, "Yes it is. Bravo, Mr. Malfoy. I heard you will be performing tonight at the meeting. Everyone is very excited to see you again."
"What is it?"
Harry shook his head, sitting down besides Draco on the bed, “I have no idea but I feel like I want to scream. Very loudly.”
Draco shrugged, "None of us that's for sure. What about you? Do you ever miss your family? From the muggle world?"
"Ah, yes, the necklace was formed in the creation of the island, some say the same seed that planted the tree birthed the stone as well. The necklace's magic is much stronger than the trees and therefore can protect who ever is wearing it from the trees magic. The boy will wear it until the storm has gone through, once the storm is gone, we will take the necklace and give him as a sacrifice to Ol' Hallow."
"Hm?" Harry replied, having no clue what she was asking about. Everyone in the group gave each other looks, like they knew a secret Harry didn't. "What?" He asked impatiently.
Harry couldn't take the concerning look Draco was giving him. So, when Slughorn asked if there was a problem at his and Draco's desk Harry nodded quickly and ran out the room, into the loo down the hall.
Harry shrugged, "I guess we will see if they win."
He stood, trying to peak through the door as they exited. "Is he okay?"
Draco gestured the to chair in front of his desk. "His name is Léon."
Draco sighed, looking towards the door, “There isn’t a way out without Splintching yourself or going through the front door which would be fairly obvious.”
now and no longer had to abide by school rivalry practices. Draco insisted that she send that idea on a portkey to Timbuktu for all he cared.
As Malfoy began his song, Harry’s attention was quickly captured by the soft, mellow voice.
Draco nodded and Harry dashed away.
as he walked towards the front of the class. Everyone turned back to their potions and drank.
"My uncle is a buffoon, he can barely walk to his mail box without getting lost."
Deciding that Malfoy was the best conversation he would probably get for the day, he sat back.
Harry fished out his money and handed it to the man, "Wow that's pretty cool being one of the first families. I bet this place is very special to have stayed so long."
Draco has also attempted to hunt down Marcus and the Goonie Boys, but to no avail. Like usual, once the trade was over they took their exchange and fell off the face of the earth. Even the people - aka the criminals - that ran around Marcus' turf had no clue about the whereabouts of Marcus nor any information involving a large cat.
He raised an eyebrow towards Draco, "If they are, what do you think they think of us?" He whispered back.
"Do you think he is the one?" Mrs. Mellow, the owner of the café whispered.
Thomas jumped back with a squeal when the cat pounced, but Draco stood stock still staring at the injured cat.
Draco placed the sheet of parchment on the small coffee table in front of him as he leaned back into the still leather couch. He looked around the room, surprised to see the mess that littered the small office. In the handful of times Draco has been to Granger's office, it has always been extremely clean. Almost unnaturally clean. Without the few picture frames placed around the room, the rows of clearly personal books and the cloak that seemed to have a permanent residency hanging off of the back of the office chair, no one would believe this office belong to anyone.
The rest of the evening was spent in soft laughs and smiles as the Harry told stories of Dobby and Malfoy told stories about the rest of his elves, the potions essay lay in the middle of the table, forgotten.
That shocked Draco out of his stupor and after gapping at her incredulously for a heartbeat, he fled the room. Once the door had closed behind him, Luna put her work aside and started to toy with her hair. "I'm sorry, Harry. Now he will have a much harder time to come to you."
"Try these," she demanded briskly, offering three wands.
Somehow it felt wrong to brood in front of the tapestry, as per usual. So, Harry took only a bottle of water from the fridge and retreated to the second bedroom on his floor. Taking care of the basics, like cleaning and nutritious potions first, the young man then changed the sheets and started the physical exercises the medi−witch had taught him. After an hour, where everything was − not unexpectedly − precisely like before, Harry curled up on the windowsill. In moments like this, he missed Hedwig so much it hurt. But now his only conversationalist was someone, who would in all likeliness, never again reply. Maybe it was better this way. It was not as if the two of them had traded anything but insults in the past.
"Or studied," Severus added. "How did you score?"
"Your own owl sleeps in the garden!"
"Two days, Neville! Draco has been missing for two days.
“Malfoy?”
"Forgive the question, Mr Weasley," Narcissa stepped up to him. "But how can my son choosing an unmanageable pet be a good thing?"
After reviewing their evidence, the Aurors parted ways to study all locations where Lady Blackwood and members of the Children of Hecate had been seen. While they found many clues about possible associates - walking in and out of homes after midnight inevitably led to suspicions - they were unable to pinpoint either Hermione's or Malfoy's magic on one of them. Dawn was not far by the time they reconvened at Grimmauld Place.
"The Weasel is right," Draco breathed out, his voice barely audible in the vast room. "It worked. We've got the venom."
“On the contrary, Sir.” The pureblood gave his opposite an icy smile. “With what I have learned, you will be able to lock him away for the rest of his life.” He was barely able to hide the satisfaction when he noticed his liege and the young Lord Longbottom sharing a high-five behind their superior’s back.
"You have the strangest relationship with your elf. You are aware that Kreacher calls you 'Sir' but purebloods like the Malfoys 'Master' and 'Mistress'? At the same time, he identifies Grimmauld Place as your home. There is no rhyme or reason to that."
"Tea?" Astoria offered.
When Harry looked sheepish, it was a rather elaborate question, the Lady Malfoy scrutinized the goblin. "Since you are Mr Potter's account manager, I sincerely hope the answer is 'Yes'. If not, I will advise him to change his account manager to someone who takes his duties more seriously."
Harry was already waiting for Kreacher with his duvet folded up on the bed. With a small gesture, he sent the elf back to his cupboard under the sink before he made himself at home in Draco's room. He pulled the trembling blond close and did not even bother with an alarm spell, confident that the rising sun would wake him. Draco did not seem particularly fond of the dark, so he never closed his curtains. Very much like Harry himself.
"Like diaries. Personal … nearly intimate." His opposite finished. "I don't feel particularly comfortable with the thought of us going over them more than is absolutely necessary."
George, however, was more perceptive. He had recognised the emotion in Draco's eyes, as well as the glares the blond had thrown his way when he and Harry had entered a few minutes prior. Since his little not-brother seemed oblivious - as always when things concerned his person - George was not sure if it was his place to say anything.
"Don't look at me," Leewood raised his hands. "I have no experience whatsoever with house-fires." Then, with a wink, he was gone as well.
Biting his lips, to keep himself from laughing, Harry needed a few moments to school his features, before he managed to ask with a straight face, "Draco needs his dress-robes and toiletries."
However, Hermione did not seem ready to support his case. Instead, she waited out her best friend, who wanted to know, after a few moments of contemplation, "But why not simply take her with us to Grimmauld Place?"
Fuming, Harry glared down at the pitiful creature, until Severus snapped, "Harry, you're making Emerald cry!"
Following the sound advice of my cherished betareader DarthKrande, I want to offer a disclaimer:
Draco had dozed on and off during the day, despite his uncomfortable position. The hunger had ceased. At least he thought so. He felt a little light-headed, though. As soon as he got up, it would pass, he was sure.
Trading a look, the two Auror's confirmed, "Agreed."
As soon as he had been freed from the chair, Lucius Malfoy trembled as he rose, before sinking to his knees in front of Harry and nearly tripped over his own words in his haste as he swore, “I, Lucius Abraxas Malfoy, accept you Harry, James Potter as my liege. I pledge my powers, my knowledge and my skill to you, to use, in any way you see fit. Your voice, your mind, your very intentions shall be mine until the day you release me from this bond.”
“I’m not Him!”
−−O−O−−
Severus frowned when he heard the young man thundering down the stairs and up again, a minute later. Barrelling into the room, Harry set a storage box down on his bed. On top lay a notebook with a pen stuck to the ring-binding and a strange white plastic-board with a thick pen snapped into a holder at the bottom. Excited, the young wizard explained, "This is a white-board. You can write extremely smoothly and then wipe it off so you can try and try and try without anybody being the wiser." Demonstrating, he scribbled down his name, before wiping it off again with the sleeve of his shirt.
"But that is the point, Harry, it did not. Not at the beginning. Lord Voldemort wanted to separate our societies, to keep us safe. World War I and II were eyeopeners! True, some spells can kill, but a single muggle bomb can eradicate an entire city block. Muggles are dangerous and have the tendency to destroy everything they do not understand or fear. If we separate us from them, preserve our rules and remember our traditions from an early age, we can keep our children and us safe.
"'By Merlin' would certainly be more appropriate. What did you think, Potter, that they would not track his wand, no matter how suspiciously absent?"
"Nearly there … is not good enouf." Snape forced out, angry at every sound that did not come out perfect.
"That is true."
"That was not you," Draco tried to comfort, but the redhead cut him off, "Yes, it was!"
"Because I made him one!" The raven-haired snarled. Yet before he could start a rant, Draco's hand on his arm calmed him.
"Yes, sorry, Neville, you're right, of course. How long do you need?"
"Thank you, my Lord. I'll make sure to tell them," Draco replied, trying his hardest to remain polite and detached from the elderly wizard, who had deftly manoeuvred him towards the darker, calmer part of the ballroom after he had claimed a minute for himself. His friends had all been very vocal in their compassion for his situation. Former housemates, with whom he had less of an immediate relationship, had offered their support, despite everybody knowing, that they would not even look at him, had he not entered at the arm of the 'saviour'. Used to months of isolation with only his mother, and now Potter as company, the chatter had become too much for the blond. Yet, now he called himself a fool for letting this Lord manoeuvre him into a corner.
Searching his mind for something to say that might placate his new master, make him lower the wand, the pureblood tried to swallow around the lump in his throat. Yet, before he could find the words, the young man asked in an even tone, “Now, Lucius, would you enlighten me, why you consider it even remotely acceptable to not only invade the privacy of my office but to carelessly go over confidential files from the Auror’s department of the Ministry of Magic? And please, do not bother lying to me, because I can promise you, you wouldn’t like me when I’m being lied to.”
"You are entirely correct."
Hugging her husband anew, Fleur reminded him, "'Arry chose this, Bill."
"I thought that was the point."
"Nothing," Draco confirmed, pulling Harry's hands on his chest, so the other could feel his calming breaths. "We just have to learn to trust you."
A swirl of magic gathered around the wood before it exploded into motion. Ducks, doves, rabbits and all other kinds of woodland creatures dashed out between them, making for the surrounding lands.
Whipping around, the blond clutched his chest, "Merlin and Morgana, Potter, learn to make some noise!" Then he paled, realising that he had snapped at his master. After a second, however, he raised his chin and looked challengingly. Harry would not take Inari. Would not dare to banish her from their home. He had to believe that, otherwise … otherwise, Potter would be just like Voldemort, and nothing could be further from the truth. Draco felt that in his heart.
Lighting up like a child on Christmas morning, the blond swallowed the last sip of his tea, before asking respectfully, "May I be excused from the table?"
"Did you get the impression that Astoria wanted that?"
Really, the answer was obvious.
Then he pulled out his wand, making both of his parents' gasp. With a few, well placed, cutting hexes, the lowest branches fell away. At a swift swish and flick, they hovered into a corner, and a levitation spell moved the cage into the greenery.
Nodding, Harry revealed, "It is a shot of espresso, with skimmed milk and two shots of hazelnut−syrup; not too sweet and low fat. The coffee I took from you had five shots of a spicy, overly−sweet syrup, whole milk and a generous serving of whipped cream your son enjoyed so readily."
Lunch was nearly finished, just a few more spices to add, when Teddy finally spoke. Harry and Draco had to stop their current tasks since the boy was talking barely above a whisper. "Don't you like me anymore, Uncle Harry?"
In a way, it never felt enough.
Once the door had closed, the raven turned towards Lady Malfoy and challenged, "And you? Do you share his beliefs?"
--O-O--
"Do you need more?"
The following week consisted mostly of Harry commuting between the Ministry, the Manor and either very early or very late, Grimmauld Place. As soon as the young Auror had returned to work, he and Neville had gotten tied up in a new case. Some crazy wizards were conducting blood−sacrifices of muggle virgins as if they were still in the dark ages. The Auror Department was stretched thin between securing the crime−scenes and obliviating the local population and muggle authorities. Harry chugged down a swift cup of coffee in the mornings, flooed to the Manor − thank god, the imbeciles of Magical Law Enforcement had finally connected the two houses − went over any new developments concerning Lostrife with Mr Malfoy before rushing to work.
"Of course. Could you please hand me the vaporiser?"
"Okay." The child replied easily, skipping over the stones of the pavement.
"Of course, I am. Otherwise, …" Draco began, but then interrupted himself. "Oh, … I didn't think of that."
After lunch, Severus had demanded some paper and pencils and had started practising his letters like a child. Emilia had not protested the exercise, knowing that it would make no difference, no matter what she said. The witch had only forced a half an hour break for tea and sandwiches on him, around five. After that, she had left him to his own devices.
When the blond opened his mouth to protest, Harry merely raised his eyebrows, watching him deflate. Some things were just true, no matter the angle you looked at them. "My point is when you finally had a choice you made the right one. That's why I helped you. However, I did not intend for Grimmauld Place to become yet another prison. You were incredibly smart at school, so I assumed you would enjoy working in the library. Sirius' family has collected some pretty impressive books over the years. At least a few should be of interest to you."
Putting down his own cup, he gestured towards the coffee he had chosen for Lucius. "Do you like it?"
He was promptly met with a lecherous grin from Ron, who wiggled his eyebrows suggestively.
"Curse you?" She inquired confused.
Pulling away, his festive mood vanishing, Draco was kept from returning to the kitchen, by his mother's delicate hand on his chest. Quietly she advised, "Watch, my love, and listen."
Laughing out loud, Harry shook his head, "You could not be more wrong. Their fights are epic! They are on their third set of dish wear already, since their wedding."
Since the day had been taxing, Harry was already asleep, when Kreacher popped in. Though he had pulled his wand on instinct, he did not have to bother asking what was wrong. He merely slipped on his dressing gown and gestured for Kreacher to lead the way. When the elf stopped in front of Draco's door once, Harry nodded before ordering, "Please, fetch me my duvet. I was cold yesterday."
"I'm our only expert because I'm the only parselmage around."
The day of the 21
When Teddy frowned, his uncle probed, "If something happened to me, would you want to know? Or do you think Aunt Andromeda would want to know?"
That was actually easy. After a shaky breath, Draco admitted. "Because it was either Astoria or Rosier. And she did not deserve to die. She was innocent in all this, and he was a sadistic bastard!"
--O-O--
"Severus," the older wizard corrected. "And I am now."
After lunch, leftover soup and fresh sandwiches, Draco came to the decision that he liked the part-Veela. Despite thinking that Beauxbatons was putting too much value on beauty and too little in power, he learned that, while the French-girl did everything with grace and gentleness, she had a core of steel and enough skill to back it up.
With a weak smile, the raven-haired shook his head in bemusement. "You know, had I known the advantages of having my own potioneer, I would have abducted you years ago."
"Because magic is all about intent," Harry continued, "Religion is but a means to an end. It's supposed to make people feel better, to give them strength and confidence. If these cultists are convinced that this ritual is going to work, it will provide them with power, because they will connect to each other and this 'place of power'; making them incredibly strong and capable of god knows what."
When Draco slowly unclenched his hands after a few minutes, the raven-haired pointedly ignored his pale, slightly wet face and inquired, "Would you help me with a prank?"
"Of course," the girl informed her. "There will be a lot of running and dodging during the fight."
Angrily, Harry whipped out his wand and weaved it over the shards of the broken cup. Since Roberts lost his temper at least once every few days – being Head Auror for the Ministry of Magic was a difficult job  – every Auror could cast the Reparo spell in his sleep after working here for a few weeks. Slamming the cup back on the desk, he snarled. “Bringing Death eaters to justice is my job, Sir. And since Malfoy had been sentenced to five years in Azkaban, as his entire family has aided me in the fight against Tom Riddle, I fail to see the justice in starving them, sentencing them to psychological torture and him receiving the Kiss for the simple reason that our prison is overflowing!”
So, the guardian of the old religion.
Funnily, that gesture brought a strand of hair into his line of vision and whatever the man had intended to say got stuck in his throat. After glancing down suspiciously, as if he expected the hair to rear up and bite him, he unfroze after a heartbeat and scrambled to reach for his tresses. Entirely baffled he then accused, "You have dyed my hair!"
