‘Maybe I did, maybe I didn’t. Maybe your thoughts are visible for some of us.’ His smile disappears. ‘Just be careful, lad. Don’t leave the path.’ The woodsman tips his hat as a greeting and briskly continues his walk.
‘I don’t want visible scarring in my face when we’ve got no time to heal it. I can’t take pain on my mark, believe me, I’ve tried. The skin doesn’t feel anything anymore.’ Just like Draco’s state of mind, before he joined the aurors. ‘Oh, and I don’t do threesomes.’
‘I know she does. I promise I will do something about it. But not tonight.’ He hugs Ron. He pats his back in return.
Harry slowly blinks, because he shouldn’t intrude. When he opens them again, he unexpectedly catches a glimpse of the count, dancing with a round breasted witch. His eyes lock onto Harry’s as he swirls by, a little lopsided grin tugging at the corner of his mouth.
‘You’re doing great, love. If you want me to stop, squeeze my hand.’ Draco doesn’t squeeze. ‘If you want me to go slow, you can squeeze my hand at anytime, okay?’ Harry strokes his hair, a gentle gesture that calms Draco. It makes him feel he’s in control of this.
He hears Draco cast a strong silencing spell. Something is wrong. He is awake, but the world is still dark. ‘Dray?’ He manages to whisper.
Harry looks at him, anger immediately replaced by empathy and genuine concern. ‘It will help to talk, love. But I respect you if you stop. It’s your call, you’re in control. No pressure. Okay?’ He gently tucks a stray piece of Draco’s hair behind his ear, his thumb stroking his chin. Draco swallows again. ‘The...’ his voice comes out thin and croaky, and he clears his throat. Harry puts his hand on his back. Finding his voice again, Draco resumes.
Our laughing starts at the same time. First it’s hesitant, small titters that turn into giggles and chuckles, developing into a full fledged fit of roaring laughter. Tears are steaming down our cheeks, but this time not from sadness. I clutch my belly and have to stop, because my abs are hurting too much. But every time I look at Harry’s broad smile, a new fit of giggles starts.
‘Thought so. But you can’t, can you? He’s all mine.’ Without further ado, she thrusts the fake cock in. Harry stifles a surprised yell that transitions into a sinful moan. Ginny pulls back and slams in at full force, making Harry cry my name.
People are watching him from behind their masks. Eyes follow him wherever he goes. He’s not sure why, but he senses he’s an exception here. He feels entirely too innocent, too blue. He makes it to the bar and orders a glass of water. Best not cloud his judgement with alcohol, he thinks. He receives a gorgeous crystal tumbler, filled with water and slices of peach.
Suddenly he starts seeing white spots. The white spots turn into contours, that turn into real objects. Colors are seeping in as he feels his vision returning.
‘Malfoy, this won’t do at all. A bit of frotting isn’t enough to get you food. Stop wasting time and take out your own cock.’
Just before his head enters too, he swears he hears Narcissa’s voice telling him: ‘be careful, Mr. Potter. Draco would never forgive me if I let anything happen to you.’
Harry rolls his eyes. ‘I’m ready.’ He hears Malfoy slicking his cock. He has never heard search an erotic thing.
He knows pork chops are Ron’s favorite, and Hermione loves asparagus. He hopes they’ll have some time for each other at Valentine’s Day, and likes to think the food will help.
The Count winks. ‘Don’t worry. Your secret is safe with me.’ He closes the distance between them again. His hands move down to the swell of Harry’s arse. ‘Although I might also tell everyone here just who you are’. He breathes into Harry’s ear.
‘Then let me help. I will show you just how perfect you are. I will tell you over and over again how gorgeous you are, how well you can follow orders. How I love it when your disobedience takes over. I will force you to do things, but you are the one in true control and can always, and I mean on every single occasion, tell me to stop. I will respect your limits without fail. I will take care of you, my precious thing, if you let me. Do you want that?’
I don’t know how long I’ve been sitting here. Nor do I know how long I will remain here. I seem to have lost track of time. My eyes are sore, my throat feels like I’ve swallowed a razor. I’m sure Gin will come looking for me at some point. I don’t what I’ll do then.
‘Do you want a calamari?’ Harry dips one perfect golden, crispy looking calamari in a blazing red sauce. Draco nods. ‘Come get it then’, Harry challenges, popping the calamari in his mouth. Draco looks horrified, the whole restaurant will see him eating out of another mans mouth. His finely bred manners revolt and he goes rigid. ‘No more food for you then’. Harry shrugs, while popping in another piece. ‘Shame, it tastes sinfully good’.
He sees the Count’s reflection in the mirrors, but when he swirls around, the Count is gone again. It’s madness. People are pointing at him, laughing or even jesting. Just as he’s about to give up in annoyance and walk away, he sees him in the middle of the dance floor. He beckons him, a small smile playing at his lips. His arrogant stance should infuriate Harry. He should turn around and leave. But he finds himself drawn to the Count like a moth to a flame. The Count holds out his hand. Harry takes it and finds himself spinning around the dance floor in the Count’s strong arms.
I put my cock back in my trousers. ‘I’m sure the Prophet will pay me an excellent fee for a transcript of your arrest then, ma’am.’
Gin and I discussed this. She proposed staying with her brother for a while, but it somehow feels wrong to have Draco over in our home. Someday, but not yet.
Harry looks like he wants to counter the question, but decides against it. ‘I’m the one that hurts you, Draco. Not some freaking rabbit hole. Because you can stop me at any time. A rabbit hole doesn’t listen to safe words.’ A small grin ghosts over Draco’s face. ‘I’m also the one that looks after you, cares for you. I’m not like all those fuckers who abused you.’ Draco looks at him defiantly. Harry knows how much he hates when he is considerate.
‘Wank yourself.’ Malfoy’s voice is sinful and posh. Harry grabs his cock and slowly starts tossing. It feels good. A film of perspiration has formed on Malfoy’s body. Harry’s legs slide down a bit, resting over the arms of Malfoy. Suddenly one of Malfoy’s deep thrusts reaches the spot. The spot that makes Harry see white dots. He remembers why he liked having sex. What irony. Feelings returning when his life will end soon. Because he’s sure, Malfoy will end things. He knows his perseverance, knows how he never does things by half. And... his thoughts get interrupted, because The Spot is hit again and again. Harry moans. He is close already, not wanting it to end yet. He circles the base of his cock and squeezes to prevent himself from coming.
‘Yes love, your mum can see that too. What I mean is, what is this dirt I’m reading?’ His green eyes are smoldering with suppressed anger, waiting to burst out.
Hungry for more, Draco follows the trail of small brown hairs down to Harry’s prick. He carefully licks the base of Harry’s cock, tasting eggs and Harry. Harry’s cock swells even further, the tip glistening in precome. Draco teases Harry’s cock, circling around the base, tongue lapping up and down his girth.
‘No, you don’t understand.’ Harry blushes and averts his eyes. ‘I’ve... I’ve never been with a man.’ He waits for the Count to laugh, deride him, anything. What he doesn’t expect is the short intake of breath. Warily he looks back at the Count. He watches Harry with a predatory grin, his eyes filled with lust. Harry swallows.
‘I pinky promise. Look at you. So gorgeous.’ Just Harry brushes the tip of his cock against Draco’s hole. It makes Draco shiver with anticipation.
‘I wanted you to be different. I wanted you to be unlike the string of others.’ His hand shakes. Malfoy lowers the gun and runs his hand through his hair.
‘Ouch! Deranged bitch.’ Drapunzel doesn’t know where it’s coming from. He would never be this disrespectful to his mother. Would he? It’s like there is another person inside of him, fighting to come out. Mother hits him, hard. Her other hand twists itself around his neck and presses the pressure points in his neck. Drapunzel feels like he’s choking. He claws at mother’s hands, but she seems to have superhuman power.
Harry crowds in and presses him flush against the tree. He bites his neck hard, using the moment Draco groans to force his tongue in. The kiss feels like a struggle. Harry grinds his hips against Draco’s. The friction is bloody fucktastic, Draco thinks as he tilts his head back, until it thumps the tree. He moans into Harry’s mouth.
Thinking of how alone he is, how scared he is, Drapunzel wraps his arms around his legs. His sobs turn into a flood of uncontrollable tears, staining his dress. He wishes there was someone to take him away. A noble prince. ‘Harry’, his head provides. The thought rattles him. Why would he want his prince’s name to be Harry? He doesn’t know anyone but Mother and the characters from the books he has read. There must be something wrong with him.
Harry looks at him. ‘I said stop. Move away.’ He pushes him away, hard. The wizard falls on the ground. The crowd around him applaud and laugh as they continue their swaying to the music. When he looks back where the Count was, only the witch is left. Her red lipstick is smooched. She’s wearing a harlequin patterned mask similar in color to his, but there is a scale pattern where his is solid green. Relieved he starts pushing his way through the crowd, searching for the Count.
Swallowing hard, Draco manages to nod. Losing no time, Harry unbuckles and swiftly pulls out his belt. He diverts his attention to the trousers itself. ‘You know, auror Malfoy, that those trousers almost made me come in my pants yesterday, like a randy teenager?’
Harry knows what’s coming, he feels Malfoy’s cock getting bigger as the blood is rushing to it. Malfoy is thrusting and panting, his breathing becoming erratic. He grunts and growls. ‘So tight. So fucking lovely. Fuck. Harry. I’m coming.’ Harry feels Malfoy spurting come in his hole with a sinful low groan. He is so hard himself, it hurts. Malfoy turns Harry around, pulling him onto his lap. His cock is still deeply buried in his arse. The bigness of it starts to hurt, but Harry knows he can’t get out yet. He feels panic rising, but Malfoy strokes his hair, tucking it behind his ears. His hands trail downward, stroking Harry’s chest and tweaking his nipple, pinching them. Harry gasps. Malfoy lubes his hands with a wandless, wordless spell.
‘I’ll just push it in a bit further. I promise if it hurts, I’ll pull it out.’ Just Harry’s coaxing is followed by a whisper ‘If you’re uncomfortable in any way, tap one of our hips twice, okay?’ Draco nods.
‘I agree with your lovely wife that we need to discuss our triad regularly, to avoid misconceptions. Our feelings should be a principal discussion point, to prevent any of us from having undesired thoughts.’ I hum.
As quiet as he can, Draco tiptoes to he next tree. If he could only reach the outskirts of the forest, he’ll be free. ‘Fuck’, he mutters under his breath, while walking through a thorny bush. It hurts. His arm is bleeding, crimson drops falling to the ground. Silently he keeps on walking, his feet padding the soft moss.
‘Fucking hell, don’t even start this. I see this all day.’ Frustrated, Harry runs his hand through his hair. ‘Oh no, auror Potter. I didn’t do this. It must be a mistake.’ He tells me in a high pitched mock voice. ‘And then the waterworks start.’ He adds bitterly.
‘Is that all you’ve got?’ Draco spits a bit of blood while shouting. ‘Restraining me with a spell? You’re too weak to hold back a poofter with your bare hands? Boy Wonder has lost his touch. Our savior nothing but a weak fucker.’ He glares provocatively.
She seems to sense what going on in my head, as her expression softens. ‘You thought you didn’t deserve to be happy?’
I tap upwards, reaching for the underside of her small but perfect tits. I stroke my hands over the bottom half of her bra, kneading them, before reaching into her cleavage. I feel her shudder. ‘Auror, what are you doing?’
At first he starts small. Wearing trousers that accentuate his assets, clinging at all the right places. Yep, reaction is imminent, as the ogling intensifies. Next step in the theory is wearing his pants of sex, as Pansy calls them, tailor made pantaloons in a darkish grey, that fit his firm arse like a second skin.
‘Now, eat.’ Harry picks up a bowl of noodle soup from under a stasis spell. Draco lifts his arms, but pain sears through. ‘Uh-uh’ Harry tuts, as he swats his hand away with the spoon. ‘I’m taking care of you.’ He strokes his hair, kisses his forehead and feeds him soup. Hot, spicy noodles slither down his throat. Spoon by spoon, Draco feels warmer and even more loved. He smiles a soft smile. Harry returns it, his eyes sparkling.
‘Fuck!’ I see her on the ground, face screwed up in pain, her hands grabbing her knee. I remember the Prophet writing about her injury. Took one too many bludgers to the kneecap. I walk back and help her up.
‘Well, what did you expect from someone creating a book with recipes that were close to perfection? And of course there were lots of other great cooks then. What, do you think, made her book the number one in the 1900’s?’ Draco grins. ‘That had to be magic, right? And a bit of good old Malfoy persuasion...’
‘I know’, Harry tightens his grip around Draco. His head nuzzles Draco’s neck. He breathes in his scent. He smells good. Safe. Feeling protected, he allows himself to doze off. Everything will be all right. He slips into a blissful sleep, his unconsciousness hearing Draco yelling at St. Mungo’s staff to get off their lazy arses and start saving the Saviour of the wizarding world. Yes, everything will be alright. He grins in his sleep.
‘I’ve been living as a wolf for such a long time, I had forgotten how it feels to be human.’ He puts down Harry and hands him his stuff and the basket.
Bottle in one hand, take out box in the other, Harry crosses his street. Strange, he could’ve sworn he had turned off the lights? Must’ve been in too much of a hurry this morning. Fumbling for his keys, he manages to open the door, bottle of wine clutched between his legs. As he enters his cozy living, he has to put down his food container, to prevent all that lovely sushi from toppling over. That’s when he notices. The moon reflecting on something in his living, something metallic, something shiny, something that normally isn’t in his house. Something a lot like a gun with a silencer screwed on. He hears the safety latch of the gun click.
‘Yessss.’ Malfoy tells him. ‘You’re not as stupid as I thought, are you now?’ Harry looks him in the eye.
He does that twisty thing with his tongue, that always makes me a bit dizzy when he blows me. I moan. And that’s my mistake. Because of the moan, I don’t hear his wandless spell. It’s an admiringly Slytherin thing to do.
‘I thought you had changed, Malfoy.’ He staggers up and makes his way over to the desk. He grabs it with one hand, as if he’s in need of support. He looks so vulnerable, so broken. I feel the urge wash over me to cradle him.
Harry’s laughter fills his hallway. ‘I was talking about your house, you dork.’ He enters and whispers in his ear ‘Don’t worry, I’ve never met a bloke that couldn’t take me. It just takes proper preparation’. His naughty wink morphs into a thousand butterflies that settle in Draco’s stomach. As if he wasn’t nervous enough...
‘When you’re done ogling my arse, Harry, would you mind telling me what I can do for you?’ Dean gives him a small wink. Flirtatious bastard, Harry thinks as his blush deepens.
To his surprise the Count laughs out loud. ‘Only you, Saviour. Only you. I’ll let you in on a little secret: this is just the place where I fuck.’ He emphasizes on the f, prolonging it. ‘Speaking of which.’ He captures Harry in his arms and kisses him. The Count takes off his jacket and opens his blouse, lips never leaving Harry. He takes of his boots and gestures Harry to do the same. Harry toes his shoes and socks off as quickly as he can. Harry whimpers when the Count deepens the kiss further and walks him backwards, to the bed. His hands slide over Harry’s arse and thighs.
‘Oh dear, lost your tongue? I’ll find it for you, because you’ll be needing it later on.’ Malfoy looks at him devilishly, while trailing the tip of his tongue over his upper lip, sending a shiver through Harry.
He sniggers. ‘How about being such a gorgeous wife? Who bears with me and takes all my irritating imperfections without too much complaining? Who burns my toast to absolute perfection and warms my heart and my cold tea?’
‘Get on the bed.’ She pushes Harry on all fours onto the bed. I can see his cock sliding against the bed sheets. He wriggles his arse up for Ginny. Desperately I look for friction myself, but my poor cock doesn’t find any.
He does as he is told, putting his hands up in the air. The stranger picks it up. The recliner is in the shadows. Harry can’t make out the strangers face. Silence follows. Harry’ll be damned if he’s the first to break it.
‘Saviour?’ The Count asks, ‘Stop thinking. What happens at the ball, stays at the ball.’ Harry gasps into his mouth as the Count pushes him closer, his hands returning to his arse. His tongue laps Harry’s mouth, and then he slithers down to his neck. Harry tilts it to give the Count better access. He suckles on his pressure points. Harry moans. The Count presses his crotch against Harry’s. He feels the outline of the Count’s hardening cock against his own erection. Harry moans again. The Count’s fingers slide up to Harry’s blouse. He looks inquiringly at Harry. ‘May I open these?’
‘Really?’ Count Flagler has a reputation of fucking everything in his way. After the war, he suddenly appeared, claiming that after the dire war times, wonderful parties were needed to restore people’s moods. And he’s thrown outrageous ones, filled with alcohol, music and sex.
They break the kiss, panting. Harry leans his forehead against Draco’s. Too tender, Draco thinks. Need more overpowering. He stomps his foot down on Harry’s. Harry swears and hits Draco again. A trickle of blood slides down his chin. Draco closes his eyes in pleasure.
‘Always.’ Harry grins and gives him a wink. ‘Get over here and eat, before I decide to call the office and call you in ill.’
‘Draco, look at me. You would like to re-enact the things that happened to you?’ Harry looks him in the eye. Draco gulps as he nods almost imperceptible. ‘You must think I’m crazy?’ A silent tear slides down his left check. Harry gently wipes it away with his thumb.
I have to slow down rubbing my nub, because I’m so close and I don’t want to come before Harry. I need to stay aroused to be able to take his cock this deep in my throat.
‘Fuck, Harry. That was so hot!’ He reaches under the table to pet Harry. When he doesn’t find him, he kneels under his desk and feels around. Harry’s musky and sensual scent is still lingering. But no Harry. He hears the telltale poof of apparation and bumps his head forcefully on the desk. ‘Fuck.’ He rubs the sore spot and gets up. He’d forgotten Harry is such a strong wizard, he can disapparate from anywhere. Even the ministry.
‘Very true, Saviour. But you tend to do things with such intensity, such passion, it’s staggering. Also: I’ve been waiting for a long time for y- to find someone who just feels right. And you do.’
Bellatrix. After the duel with Molly, they left her for dead. But when the aurors went to fetch the bodies, she was nowhere to be found. Until this day no one knows what happened to her. Thinking Draco might be somewhere near her, makes his stomach twist uncomfortably. ‘What happened?’
‘Shush. Down.’ The stranger gestures his gun downwards. Deliberately Harry puts his wand on the ground.
Harry looks disgusted. ‘Really? Yuk. Which brother, though? I hope it is Bill. He has some awesome scars.’ A small smile tugs on the corner of his mouth. I throw my pillow at him.
‘Auror Malfoy, will you talk some sense into him?’ Sybil sounds exasperated as she enters first. Sybil and Jaimy always bicker like a married couple. They would indeed make a lovely set, both equally feisty and arrogant, he thinks, as he feels Harry’s lips enclose him.
We both know it’s not true. Now he’s started this, he can’t stop it. I don’t want him to stop it. ‘We’ll figure it out, luv.’
‘I take it you’ve talked to Harry, Draco?’ She emphasizes on the Draco part. I grin. This is one piece of work. Not knowing exactly how honest Harry has been, I deflect her question.
‘I don’t know what came over me, mother. I’m so sorry.’ He sobs a bit. ‘Thank you, mother, for combing my hair.’
The waiter returns and collects the mostly empty dishes. Harry orders the chef’s dessert. Harry refills Draco’s wine, who sips it contently. There are pink spots on his cheeks. He enjoys his post-orgasm bliss, it felt so good to come. Shit, Harry. Without warning, he feels his happy mood slide away.
‘Ma’am, I’m just going to search you. No one is talking about any illegal potion just yet.’ She is already getting up from the seat. My mouth twitches slightly. So eager.
‘Fuck, yeah. You’re doing great.’ Draco sucks him in, his cheeks hollowing. He blows like a pro and Harry has to think of Bellatrix to keep from coming. Draco lets out his cock with a pop.
‘Try to stay in one piece until I split you open, would you?’ He growls as he presses me onto the bed. I shiver at the anticipation. Sex with a male is so different. Especially with one that is just as strong as I am.
Harry eyes him approvingly. ‘You did so well, love. I’m proud of you.’ He inclines his head and kisses Draco. The kiss is soft and tender. Harry strokes his hair. ‘Such a good pet.’ He murmurs in Draco’s mouth, deepening the kiss. Draco opens up, snogging back lazily. Reluctantly breaking apart, Harry reaches for the forks. ‘Dessert?’
Of course he knows that. I’d almost forgotten. We would get howlers, love letters, marriage proposals, propositions to dispose of me, love potions and loads of fics from writers, that left nothing to the imagination. Some even starring me. I would never admit it to my dear husband, but I secretly read several rather explicit adventures, feeling incredibly flustered.
‘God, so close.’ He moans. Harry stops. ‘Fuck you, Harry.’ Harry bares his teeth in a downright filthy grin. He keeps stroking and stopping, stroking and stopping, sometimes squeezing the head of Draco’s cock right before he comes. He keeps him on the brink of an orgasm. Draco thinks he’s never felt the urge to come this badly in his life. ‘Fuck, Har. I can’t take it anymore.’ He is a panting, shivering, sweaty mess, hair stuck to his forehead, arms sore from being tied above his head. He doesn’t give a shit. The need to come is all compassing, the adrenaline drowning out all discomfort.
Draco swallows and nods. Work can wait a little while longer. Harry gets up and starts rubbing Draco’s hair with the soft fabric of the towel, working his way down. His hands linger on his cheeks. ‘So elegant’.
Which one to choose? His mind wanders to a noble prince called Harry, who will climb his golden hair to save him. Wanting to look good for him, even if he’s just a figment of his imagination, he undresses. He fills his water basin and washes himself. Making sure to clean his lower region and buttocks, his mind thinks up the all the ways he could thanks Prince Harry for saving him. It makes his cock hard. He sprinkles some lavender scented talcum powder on his skin, making him smell lovely.
‘Harry?’ He doesn’t reply. ‘Har? You can talk to me, luv. What’s up? Did you find the stories a tad bit arousing? It’s nothing to be ashamed of. A lot of DrarryShipper1981’s readers  seem to think so.’ He gets up and starts pacing the room.
‘That won’t be necessary, auror. I’ll comply for now.’ She spreads even wider, pressing her soft bum flush against my groin.
When the first sounds of Labyrinth come from his telly, he finds himself unwinding. How many times has he watched this movie as a kid? Silently crawling from his cupboard when the whole house was asleep, putting the VHS in the recorder. The movie aunt Petunia thought of as sinful and tossed away. Harry rescued it and watched it over and over. He hasn’t watched in a while, but probably still knows it word by word.
‘Don’t worry, Har. He will be there and you will have a great fuck.’ Harry chokes on his tea and coughs, turning beet red. Luna just smiles her heavenly smile.
Sound of writer clapping hands excitedly. Tomorrow! Sleep wel Harry, sleep well Count. You’ll need your energy tomorrow  (;
He gets up and looks at Malfoy. ‘Thank you for making me feel, even if it was just for a little while’, he whispers as he wishes it would’ve been enough to let him live. He doesn’t feel anything as he picks up Malfoy’s wand and vanishes Malfoy’s body with a flick of his hand. Maybe next time, he thinks as he promises himself he will make an appointment with a mind healer tomorrow.
‘Touch yourself.’ He tells me. He doesn’t have to say it twice, I’m already slipping my hand into my panties, finding I’m even wetter than I thought. I moan when I touch my clit, rubbing circles around it. The moan is stifled by Harry’s cock.
‘Incarcerous’ I mutter, wand in hand lightly. He yelps, I caught him by surprise. Good. I’m the bad guy here. I take his wand.
He uses Harry’s shampoo. It’s rich smell of patchouli and musk cuddles around Draco, the scent of Harry making him feel warm and loved. He closes his eyes as he lathers himself in foamy soap, spreading it over his body and relishing it’s softness. With a sigh he turns off the water. Work. Must get ready.
Harry Accios the lube. He gets up and pushes down his trousers and pants, looking down at his almost fully erect cock. He sits back again, leaning into the couch. His hand finds his arse. He pulls apart his arsecheecks, his finger feeling for his hole. It feels puckered and inviting. Harry lathers his finger in lube and searches for the hole again. Gently he pushes in.
‘There’s nothing wrong, pet. I just don’t want... After all those years I don’t want us to fuck in a sodding shed over a desk.’
‘No- ah...’ he stomps his feet twice. He feels Harry stop immediately. ‘No, I’m fine. Nothing a pain potion can’t fix. Thank you for your concern, auror Smith.’ He looks reassuringly at her. She nods. Draco tentatively reaches one hand under the table, seeking out Harry. He finds his head. Or he thinks it’s his head. He pushes him back onto his cock. ‘I’ve gotten a GREEN potion that does just the job.’ Taking the hint, Harry resumes his ministrations. Draco can almost feel him smirking against his hard prick. It feels so hot and sinful.
Sure, he thinks, why not? Let’s fill up this basket and get some damn anemones. It’s not like he’s got something better to do. After resigning from the aurors, Harry is in between jobs. A status that has been lasting for a full year now. He has no idea what to do with his life, but auroring wasn’t agreeing with him anymore. He woke up every single night in agony, feeling like he was never doing a good enough job. There was always something that could’ve gone better, new cases to solve, new people to save. He was just so tired of it all. Tired of saving the world. Tired of being in control.
‘Look at him, Harry. You were so right. He really is gagging for this.’ Ginny has entered my vision, looking at my hard on, her eyes filled with a desire I haven’t seen before. She is wearing a black leather strap on. I knew it! I want to tell them I was right all along, but no sound gets out.
‘So strong. So resilient.’ He continues his trail over his collarbone, his throat, his chin, ending at his mouth. He kisses him again. This time it’s an open mouthed, sloppy kiss. ‘You are perfect. Don’t ever doubt that, Draco Malfoy.’ With that, he tosses the towel in the hamper and leaves a very flustered and very aroused Draco in the bathroom.
Focusing his hearing, he realizes something is wrong. It’s quiet. Too quiet. All the normal forest sounds seem to have disappeared. Harry’s hand flies to his wand. ‘Is anyone there?’ he yells, his voice coming out more hoarse than he intended. No sound returns.
‘So eager. On all fours. Now.’ I get up a bit, wondering if he’ll fight me again. I hope not, because as arousing as it was, I really want to fuck him. Thankfully, he complies and turns around. I yank his trousers and boxers down in one pull. I hear him stifle a moan as I part his arse cheeks.
Harry nods. Malfoy thrusts his cock back in, making Harry gag again. It feels so good. Harry relaxes his throat, tilting his head backwards, so Malfoy can fuck his mouth better. He hears Malfoy’s groans, his breathing becoming heavy. Suddenly, he retreats. ‘I always knew you had a mouth on you, Potter. I didn’t know it could suck cock like this. If only I had known earlier.’ He smirks a lopsided grin. ‘The war might have ended a lot sooner, ‘cause I would’ve been too busy fucking you to repair the fucking closet.’ Harry feels the corner of his mouth tug up.
‘Just relax. Let your throat adjust, feel the rhythm. Breath through your nose. If you can’t breathe, just let my prick slide out a bit.’ Harry’s fingertips circle Draco’s scalp, massaging him. Draco suppresses a moan.
‘Ever heard of a cover up? I’ll bet you the muggles chuck all their persona non gradas in here and leave them to die a quick yet painful death.’
‘That’s no way to talk to your mother, Drapunzel. You will thank me for combing your hair. Or I will throttle that lovely throat of yours until you’re turning blue.’
Her pubic hair is moist when I stroke it. She pushes against my hand, wanting me to move further down. Teasingly, I slide my fingers down, not touching her clit, until they reach her entrance. I push my finger in. And another. She shudders.
‘Don’t worry, pet. I’m sure I’ll be able to keep up with your Gryffindor haste.’ I feel his cock pressing against my leg and know he’s just as worked up as I am.
Harry starts fucking my face. He’s wild and sets a ferocious pace. He’s sweating and swearing. ‘By Merlin, woman, you are so gorgeous. I’m so fucking lucky to have you. Taking my cock so perfectly. Swallowing so fucking deep.’ Harry only swears when he’s incredible angry or incredible horny. This is the latter.
‘If you keep doing this, Bellatrix will find us fucking and kill us off instantly.’ Harry’s voice comes out rough. Draco winks at him and makes his way downstairs.
Pacing around in his living, glancing at his muggle watch makes him even more anxious. What if Potter stands him up? Maybe he is angry for him not returning the favor this afternoon? Images of the hot scene flood through his mind. The way Harry swallowed him whole, letting him fuck his face while staying in control the whole time. Draco shifts in his pants, his half hard cock strains against the fabric.
‘He fucked me, okay? He fucked me thrice after the war and I loved it. There. Then I met you again, and we broke up.’ Harry falls down on a chair and buries his head in his hands. Is he crying?
Jaimy throws his fist up in victory. Sybil gives him a death glare. ‘But with appropriate urgency.’ His own urgency becomes almost too much, he needs to have these two out of the office. ‘If that’s all? I have to finish this report for Senior auror Jones.’ They give him a sympathetic look. ‘Close the door on your way out, please.’ He looks sternly at them. Well, as sternly as he can, considering Harry’s relentless pace makes his face twist in anguish. He’s so close. He feels his balls tighten.
In which Draco, Ginny and Harry talk and Ginny and Draco discover they have more in common than they thought.
‘Careful, you’ll get spunk everywhere.’ Ginny had hated spunk. A moment of sadness washes over him. His misses her, even if he just had this mind blowing experience.
‘You’re right, love. We promised. No fucking. But after all this caressing I did, don’t you think I deserve a little reward? I don’t ask for much. Just the tip. Okay, love? Just the tip. I won’t push it in any further than you want.’ Just Harry presses the tip against Draco’s arsecheeks.
‘Shall we keep on standing there, or will you let me in sometime tonight?’ Harry asks, cheeky grin forming on his handsome face.
‘Shit, sorry...’, Draco tries to retract, but Harry’s hands firmly hold him in place. Draco’s eyes travel downwards and meet lustfilled, demanding eyes. Harry takes hold of Draco’s hands and places them in his hair. Not breaking eyecontact, Draco grabs Harry’s softer than expected mop.
‘Fuck.’ Malfoy stands and rubs his hands through his hair. ‘I never do this, Potter. I just kill and leave. It’s what I do. This... it’s just a fucking diversion.’ He walks back to the recliner and picks up the magazine.
Harry looks outside. His arms are starting to cramp. His eyes shoot back at Malfoy. ‘All this talk, and so little action? Or are you scared, ferret?’ The use of the old nickname stirs something in him. He notices he isn’t the only one.
‘Don’t be. Not your fault. Now, if the tea party is over, I’d like to fuck you. If, that is, you don’t mind. Or maybe you’d rather have me braid your hair?’
‘Hush handsome. You did so great. I’m so proud of you.’ Harry’s calloused thumb wipes the tear away and kisses it’s trail, while Ginny softly fondles with my hair. I murmur something, not sure what, before I feel the bliss of sleep wash over me.
Draco gulps. ‘If it gets too much or if I want to stop, will you?’ Draco looks at him nervously, his hand fidgeting with the hem of his sleeve.
‘No, you fucking idiot. I’m disappointed. I really like this scenario and want you to take me by force. I was ready for getting hurt, I have been aroused ever since you proposed this fucking role play, okay? When I stepped into that hole, all I could think about was you taking advantage of it. Pinning me down to the ground. Pressing your thumb on the sore spot and making me- aaaah’ Draco can’t finish his sentence.
‘Yes.’ My voice comes out shakily. I can only look at the gag. What would it feel like to have one in my mouth? What if I can’t breathe?
Harry looks away. He is silent for a moment. ‘Okay. After Voldemort I made certain never to let anyone rule me again. Him and Dumbledore, and also my obnoxious uncle and aunt before them, tried to control me. They tried to make me do what they wanted, turn me into someone I’m not, and it really pissed me off.’ Harry’s eyes are venomous as they fix on a faraway point in space, his jaw clenching hard.
Draco is silent for a while. I can see him considering if he wants to tell us more. Deciding he does, he complements: ‘You want honesty? I must say, I already have felt jealous of what you have on more than one occasion, and I await more of these moments. You two have more history and you already chose her once over me.’ He is right, even though my heart never really could make the choice.
I feel Draco shake besides me. ‘Har, I’m serious. I’m not going to do that. Those muggles with their contraptions of death. I’m content with my life as it is. I don’t want to die prematurely.’ He is whining now. I sigh and turn around to face him.
‘So I can suck on my prey better, dearest Potter. And boy, can I suck.’ An involuntary whimper escapes Harry’s mouth. His cheeks flush as Malfoy bares his teeth in a lustful gin.
‘Oh yes, if you keep doing this, I’ll come so hard, you’ll be choking on my sperm.’ Draco whimpers. ‘Do you want that? You dirty, gorgeous thing? Do you want me to spoof up that lovely, tight throat of yours?’ Harry’s rough-edged voice becomes uneven, his breathing erratic. Draco wants him to come. He murmurs something around Harry’s cock, which makes Harry groan even louder. ‘Gonna come, so good, so good...’
‘Draco, I...’ he looks at Draco to see he doesn’t need to tell him that his sight is coming back. Draco kisses him intensely.
He trails further up, avoiding his cock, kissing the sharp bone of his hip. ‘I wish you could see yourself as I see you.’ The kisses go up, over his abs, his scars, gently flicking over his nipple.
‘Maybe... Maybe if you go first, I’ll be more courageous?’ Draco’s words stumble out of his mouth. He curses himself for being such a bloody idiot.
Ginny grins. ‘I would be disappointed if you didn’t. Ready for a good show, hun?’ Harry pulls her closer and kisses her. I sit on the chair, not sure what to expect or how it will affect me.
‘These patatas are otherworldly delicious. Too bad you’re not allowed to taste them.’ Harry deliberately licks the salt of his immorally endearing lips. He lets out a delighted groan.
When the owl arrives, I all but run to the window. Compose yourself, Draco, I think. Only to rush forward and send back a reply. It’s my home, I can rush if I please. No one’s here to see me make a fool of myself anyway.
‘After the war, no one would hire me. Reformed or not, the fucking death eater label stuck. The ministry made me a offer. I became an official, ministry payed fucking hitwizard. I’ve done in countless of malicious witches and diabolical evil wizards over time. But when I read your name, I knew. Knew it wasn’t okay. The whole fucking ministry is so bloody corrupted. The fuckers must want you to be stopped before you topple them over.’ He puts his head into his hands, elbows still on his knees. He rubs his face.
‘How? Wait until he sees him in a dress. The little fucker thinks he looks so lovely. Hahaha. The idiot. As if Mr.-Straight-I-Singlehandedly-Ended-The-War-Macho-Man would ever have any interest in a bloody crossdressing deviant. No, he will reject him. He’ll reject him hard. And then the poor little thing will be devastated.’ More maniacal laughter.
‘Okay.’ He looks at Draco with a lopsided grin. Draco feels Harry’s hard on and knows he’s just as far gone as he is himself. ‘I won’t hold back then.’
Draco groans, until Harry shifts his angle. ‘Yeah, there’ Draco manages to grunt as he sees spots of pleasure with every time Harry reaches his prostate.
‘I’ve got an idea, pet.’ Boy Toy flips Draco over, until he is on all fours. He gets on his knees in front of Draco. ‘If you suck like this, you won’t choke as much. Try it, pet.’
He pales again, and quickly gets out, hooking his arm through Ginny’s outstretched one. ‘I’m proud of you, hun. You did great. Want to ride Space Mountain with me today? If you want, I can kiss you through it too.’ Gin makes kissy sounds with her lips. Draco laughs with his whole body as he swats her arm. She kisses his temple and rests her head on his shoulder. Draco leans into her. I watch them leave for breakfast fondly, a small smile lingering on my lips. Did I mention I’m the luckiest wizard alive? Well, I sure as hell am.
Harry feels the edge of the bed in his knee pits. The Count looks him in the eye, pupils wide with raw desire, as he pushes him on the bed with one hand. The bed is soft and enormous. Harry clambers to the middle, propped up on his elbows, legs pulled up and wide open. The Count takes off his blouse while he climbs on the bed.
I hear the pop of apparating. A part of me is relieved she’s here. Gin will know what to do. The other part isn’t ready to face her yet.
Harry leans in. ‘It hasn’t escaped our notice that you like watching us.’ Yes, true. But I wouldn’t mind pounding Potter myself now, not watching his gorgeous wife getting laid.
‘Bring it on, auror.’ She smirks. ‘Auror, If I suck your cock, will you please let me get off with a warning?’
It’s Harry whose voice returns first. ‘Fuck, that was amazing.’ He gives Ginny a languid kiss. ‘And you’, he gets up, ‘you were fucking amazing too,’
‘This.‘ He shows me the iWiz. It is open at the notes section. A very explicit scene is flashing up there. One that’s rather well written by DrarryShipper1981, if I may say so myself.
‘Draco, we’ve discussed our safe words. You can get out of every scenario you want with one word. The same goes for me. Safe wording out means an emergency brake. No questions asked. Just a full stop. We are clear about that, right?’ Draco nods.
I’m pacing through the room nervously, checking my robes for the umpteenth time. Ginny is barking mad. No, I’m barking mad, for letting her convince me this is a good idea. Maybe I should leave. Yeah, that would be the sensible thing to do. Leave and lie to Malfoy about one of the children being ill. Sounds like a plan.
I remove my thumbs and let my hands slide down, stroking her throat, her cleavage, her belly, her lower back, her arse. She shudders. I move them under her skirt and into the hem of her knickers. I pull them down.
Draco gets up and paces the room. ‘I couldn’t. Why would you, Savior of the whole wizard world, slayer of Dark Lords, ever be interested in me? Death eater junk? I figured you just wanted a quick fuck and would leave.’ He averts his eyes. ‘And I didn’t think my heart could take that.’
Draco tilts his chin up, his posh voice holding as much challenge as he can muster. ‘You would fuck me right here on the table between desserts’
I get up again and push myself flush against her, making sure she feels my strength. She likes it when I overpower her. I start searching her front section from behind. Her slender body that I know by heart, the soft pouch on her belly, the one that inevitably forms when you’ve had three kids. She hates it, but I love it as it holds the memory of her pregnancies. I take care to softly pet it, stroke it and knead it, fingers slipping in the hem of her skirt every now and then, touching bare skin. She leans into me, surrendering herself to me.
‘It’s not fair!’ He yells together with Sarah and laughs. If anyone could see him now. His tough Saviour image would crumble instantly.
Inside I die of sniggering. That bloody perfect wife of mine. Of course my outside doesn’t show. ‘I think I might’ve heard of him, ma’am’.
‘Auror Potter! Not at all. One moment.’ The floo goes black for a second, before showing him the smiling face of Dean.
Harry looks at him sternly, his emerald eyes hold a challenge in them, that makes Draco’s insides squirm with want. His insides also tell him he’s really freaking hungry. Slowly, Draco puts his palm back on Harry’s cock. He starts rubbing it through the sturdy fabric of his jeans. His cock is hard and gigantic. Harry keeps on eating.
‘You sure?’ Harry rolls his eyes, but Draco holds back until Harry gives him an almost imperceptible nod. Draco thrusts forward, moaning from the pleasure Harry’s hot, tight mouth gives him. He pulls out and thrusts in again, making Harry choke. Draco checks Harry’s watery eyes, and seeing nothing but pure arousal there, he starts thrusting. He tries not to go too deep, really, he does, but soon he’s unable to stop as raw, fierce need takes over. He thrusts even deeper, making Harry moan beneath him.
Harry nods, eyes shutting again. It hurts, but he’s thrumming with anticipation of finally knowing how it feels to be fucked. The adrenaline is taking over. The Counts removes his fingers. Harry’s eyes fly open. ‘Wha-?’
‘Shame. And here I thought the Saviour of the whole wizarding world would get a kick out of all this attention.’ Harry’s eyes flick to the Count’s, expecting a sneer. But the Count looks at him with his amused, arrogant grin.
‘Want some help finding it?’ Harry asks, as his fingers brush ever so lightly over Draco’s buttocks. The gentle, but rather arousing gesture makes Draco’s blood rush down south. Which is rather unfortunate. He is wearing his trousers of sex, after all. Trousers that aren’t only tight fitted on the backside.
‘Good. Me neither.’ Harry lets his hand fly over his cock again. The pleasure it brings is wonderful. Harry feels his cock tightening and swelling, knows he’s going to burst. Malfoy hits his prostate once again. He grunts as he releases his load and spoils it all over his own hand and the recliner. Malfoy follows suit and Harry watches his face contort with pleasure as he closes his eyes and comes with a rough grunt. He topples over, leaning into Harry, while his still half hard cock slides out.
‘They...’ Draco can’t get himself to form the words, so he gets up instead and unbuttons his shirt. After a moment of hesitation, he lets it glide off his shoulders. He sees Harry watching him, following the trail of scars.
‘Do not anger me, Drapunzel.’ She releases him. Coughing and wheezing, his shaking hands fly up to his sore throat.
Glancing down, he also registers something else. The tailored jeans Harry’s wearing give him a distinct view of his assets. Which are either completely hard, or just plain enormous in flaccid form. Harry’s eyes follow his glance. He smiles a wicked grin.
He nods as I sit up. ‘You know how I started that online writing course?’ He nods again. ‘The stories I have been writing were received rather okay. But they didn’t get a lot of feedback. So I switched to fan fiction.’ Harry looks questioningly.
Of course he has bloody fucking checked the dates. I sigh too. And roll my eyes. That will teach him.
‘Sounds good. I wish I could join you. ‘Mione has cooked dinner tonight.’ Seeing his best friends face contort with aversion, Harry laughs and slaps his shoulder. ‘It’s the greenish lasagna.’ Ron stage-whispers as he shudders with horror.
‘Please don’t. Let justice deal with her. I need you, Dray. I’m scared.’ It is scary. Being in the dark, while he hears everything around him. He feels Draco’s proximity as he kneels besides Harry.
Harry holds up his hand, immediately silencing Draco. ‘You wíll get yourself ready, or I’ll be fucking you unprepared. And I’m not small.’
Deciding he’s had enough, Harry grabs Draco’s hair and pushes his head down on his cock. ‘Naughty ones must be punished, don’t you agree? Now start sucking.’ Harry guides Draco’s head up and down, using a bit more force than necessary. It arouses Draco even more, he feels his own neglected cock bursting with want.
We settled on a muggle holiday park. One that has tiny cottages, with lots of privacy.  It’s neutral territory, with no press or nosy neighbors. I’m owling Draco the apparation point and the date. Restlessly I await the return of Jareth, our pet owl. It arrives within 10 minutes. Someone is eager.
They apparate in the alley next to the restaurant. Harry opens the door of the expensive Spanish restaurant for him. The waiter takes their coats. ‘Mr. Potter, it is good to see you again. We’ve prepared your favorite table. Will you two gentleman please follow me? Gracias.’
‘That is different. When I hurt you intentionally, I know what I’m doing and know when I’ve gone too far. This time you need medical aid, okay? Your ankle wound looks severe.’
Harry’s eyes darken. ‘What makes you think I safe worded for you? Draco, love, you still have a lot to learn. I’m not willing to finish our play when you’re hurting.’
Malfoy just smiles a crooked smile. ‘You did well, now let me help you get through this’. He touches Harry’s hard prick, stroking it softly, slicking it. Harry groans, discomfort forgotten. Malfoy sets a steady but agonizing slow pace. The forest is quiet except for the slopping sounds and Harry’s heavy breathing. He groans as Malfoy keeps stroking him, while he gently moves his cock inside Harry’s hole. ‘Please, don’t stop.’ Harry’s voice comes out lower than he ever thought possible. ‘You feel fucking incredible inside me’. He watches Malfoy’s eyes darken as he keeps on stroking his cock.
He steps into the dark green pants. They cling to his toned legs and fit his firm arse like a second skin. The trousers, he likes. The poet shirt he’s not so sure about, he thinks as he dons the off-white thing.
‘Sap’. Harry grins heavy-eyed. The last thing Harry sees is the Count laying down next to him, looking so intensely, as if he’s memorizing the image of Harry in his bed. Harry smiles as he drifts off to sleep.
Harry feels how soft his lips are. Just as soft as kissing a girl, he thinks. But then the Count parts his lips slightly, as to invite Harry. He slides his tongue in. The Count immediately chases it with his own, rough and needy. Nope, definitely not like kissing a girl, Harry thinks. The kiss turns sloppy and then downright filthy. He’s never been more glad of the mask, as he wouldn’t want these pics in the Prophet tomorrow. But maybe they will anyway, as the Count seems to know who he is. Maybe this is just an elaborate setup. He feels himself still.
‘Don’t think I’ve gotten sappy. I can’t fuck you if you’re hurting too much to move.’ He growls. But Harry doesn’t miss the soft fondness in his gold specked eyes. Suddenly he knows. Knows Malfoy will be careful. Won’t hurt him if he doesn’t want it. He feels himself relaxing as Malfoy’s hands caress his arsecheeks.
Harry looks at him. Malfoy’s glamour is dropping. His eyes turn into the color of the sun. Harry yelps.
Harry looks away. He feels tears welling up. ‘It’s my first time’. He blushes. He’s had sex with countless, sometimes nameless girls, but never with a man. With men, he’s only had quick encounters in dirty loos, on his knees on sticky floors. Sucking, but never fucking.
Harry lightly smacks his butt. ‘Chop-chop, get that lovely arse under the table. We’ve got some time before dessert.’ Harry opens his fly. Draco feels anger well up in him. How dare he be so presumptuous. He won’t do it!
Draco can’t stay into character anymore and grunts and moans as he is taken apart by both men. ‘Fuck, more. Harder. Yes!’ He mumbles between breaths as two Harries slam into him, forcefully.
She still is the most beautiful woman I know. But more gorgeous than her appearance is her kindness, straightforwardness, wit and her power to do anything for the ones she loves. I could never have wished for a better mother for our children. I love her so much, it sometimes hurts.
‘I don’t know, Harry. I’m a werewolf. It isn’t easy being with me. You know what happened to Professor Lupin. And Greyback. I would never want to hurt you of all people.’
Draco obediently opens his mouth, forming a perfect and soft looking ‘o’. Harry feeds his cock to him. Draco sucks him in, his tongue swirling around the head and ridge of his cock. Harry gasps. This isn’t the mouth of an inexperienced virgin.
‘That’s Auror Harry for you, ma’am’, I tell her and tweak her nipples. She moans that moan, the one that could get you off without touching yourself. Merlin, where did I find such a perfect woman? I lick a stripe in her neck. Suddenly I let go and fish a small vial of something out of my pocket. ‘Aha. And where, ma’am, did this potion come from?’
His hand speeds up a little. He wants to go slow, but he feels his body’s need. He’s sure he can’t hold back long. He imagines Jareth leaning in, kissing him. Out of the blue Malfoy enters his mind. Naked too, cock in hand. Well, Harry grins, might as well let the two fuck me. Imaginary Malfoy makes his way over and straddles Harry, pushing his cock in his mouth. He still feels imaginary Jareth push inside, as he moves his finger in a steady rhythm. His hand slides in the same rhythm as he imagines sucking Malfoy, while Jareth keeps fucking him. His hand flies over his slippery cock. Before he knows it he feels his hole contract around his finger, as he comes all over his hand and couch. Spurts of semen stream out as he grunts. He leans back into the couch, relishing the after orgasm bliss. He cleans and goes to bed early. Only to wank again, his body thrumming with anticipation for the next day.
‘You can eat now.’ Draco doesn’t hesitate and fills his plate with all the glorious food. He eats as if his life depends on it, scared of Harry revoking his privilege to eat again. Harry sends him a knowing, lopsided gin.
‘Have you seen yourself? You already are.’ He tweaks my nipple underlining his statement. I gasp and indeed, I writhe.
Yes. He did right. It’s out of his hands now, he just has to wait. A small grin forms at his lips. He’s waited so long, he’ll live through another day. Tomorrow. Tomorrow he’ll know how sweet his lips will taste and if he was worth the wait.
‘When the world falls dooooown / I’m waiting for you’ He hums as he brings his plate to the kitchen. Returning to the couch, he watches the ballroom scene. He imagines Jareth kissing him there, telling him ‘Look at what I’m offering you. Your dreams.’ What would he want from Jareth? He feels his cock stir to live. A small smile tugs at his lips. Little Harry knows what it wants from Big Jareth. He snorts. His hand reaches down, into his trousers. It’s been some time since he wanked. It might calm him further.
Malfoy grins as his finger breaches Harry’s hole. Harry gasps. Malfoy kisses him again while his long, slender fingers expertly work him open. ‘I’m ready.’ Harry tells him after the second finger enters.
Has it gotten warm in the room? Draco feels either room or he himself has heated up several degrees. He also feels something stirring in his pants. Something he didn’t expect after several rounds of mind blowing sex. Harry is great in bed and has an incredible experience. All of a sudden it makes Draco feel insecure. What is his sexual performances don’t satisfy Harry? What if he has had better? What if he’s so disappointed in what Draco wants, he can’t get it up anymore?
‘Don’t let it get to your head, Saviour. Your ego is already big enough.’ The sneer is without venom and Harry smirks. ‘Now, eat.’
I nod. ‘Owl me when you’re ready.’ Reluctantly I leave. My erection is pressing painfully in my trousers. I’m in desperate need of a long, hot wank under a long, hot shower. I take one look back and walk away, before I almost change my mind (I’m only human, after all) and the sight of Potter, disheveled, lips bruised from kissing, almost makes me come in my pants. I blow him a kiss and apparate home.
He spits out a bit of blood and grins that challenging smile again. ‘Is that all you’ve got, auror? And you dare call mé a ponce?’
Draco turns a deep shade of scarlet. This is worse than his initiation when joining the aurors. Why did he ever think this was a good idea? A sudden thud makes him jump. Harry has spelled the door shut and is casting a Muffliato and Imperturbable spell on it. Huh? Why?
‘I know, love.’ He holds out his hands for baby Rose. Hermione hands her over. The baby is quiet immediately.
‘Never mind, it’s a muggle thing. I would love to suck your cock to prevent a ticket for performing underage magic or whatever you’ll think of.’
‘Look up and check if I’m laughing.’ Reluctantly his eyes look up, searching out mine. I’m not sure what he finds there, but I feel compassion and protectiveness bubbling up. That’s unexpected. Also, standing so close to him, I feel something else. Something I can’t place yet.
‘We haven’t received a declination note, so your precious one will probably show up. NOW SIT. We have to go over the event one last time. We need you.’
Harry’s thumbs slide behind the waistband of Draco’s boxers as he deliberately and slowly pushes them down. His leaking cock springs out. In one swift movement, Harry’s on his knees. Draco feels the magic of a wandless protection spell crackling over his hard prick. Keeping eye contact Harry asks: ‘Do you want this?’
She looks at me with compassion as she continues. ‘Harry was devastated. I didn’t realize at the time. I thought is was the aftermath of the war. But he... I used to walk in and find him in our window sill, looking out over the big oak tree in our garden.’ I blush. That must’ve been the tree where we first kissed. The tree that Harry pushed me flush against when I came to apologize for my misconducts.
I finish my tea and stare out in our garden long after Ginny has left. Deciding, I get up and apparate back to the shed the Potters call their country residence. I hesitate at the threshold. Am I really doing this?
‘I didn’t expect you would be a freezer. You know, people fight, flight or freeze. I’ve seen it all. It gets so fucking tiring sometimes.’ Malfoy sighs. ‘No pleading? No last wishes?’
‘Doesn’t...’ I bounce up in excitement. ‘Draco, it turns me on beyond words. I would love to wriggle my way out of a parking ticket.’
‘He didn’t leave me. And he didn’t choose me then, not really, not with his whole heart. He just... He couldn’t choose both of us. He chose the easiest, most normal path, but don’t for a second think that made his choice easy. I think he kept on doubting until I was pregnant.’
She clears her throat. ‘I want to know when you’re with Draco. I don’t want to worry sick when you’re not arriving home. I don’t know how I feel about you living somewhere else, so I really hope you’ll continue living here. Of course I don’t mind it when you sleep elsewhere some nights, but your home is here. Draco, you are always welcome too. I want you to feel at home. But when Harry and I play, I expect you to respect our... my privacy.’ Draco nods.
‘Jesus, Potter. I’ll just split you open. See if I care. What the fuck is wrong with you? You don’t want to feel that fucking pain, trust me.’
‘I could try and tell you? If you want me to stop, I’ll stop.’ I nod. Harry starts telling me. I see the emotions in his face when he tells me he thought all was lost. I’m almost crying myself. His face lights up when he tells me how Draco came back. Then he comes to the last part. He hesitates.
It feels strange, but in an exhilarating way. I test the ball and realize I could push it out with my tongue if I really wanted to. That relaxes me. I try to speak, but it comes out muffled. This really is fascinating. Me, used to getting my way with eloquent speech, reduced to a mumbling mess, forced to watch and unable to participate.
‘Don’t for a minute think I find you mental or cracked up. I love your submissiveness, it’s a rare treat. But yours should come with a fierce sense of disobedience. It suits you better than the insecure, timid person that sometimes shines through.’ Harry looks at him intensely. Draco has to close his eyes to shield himself from it.
‘But it doesn’t. It’s just a job. You’re just a job. Like all the others.’ Malfoy points the gun at Harry. ‘On your knees, hands behind your head.’
‘So I tried out Sherlock. That was an improvement. People started reading my fics and commenting on them. It was great! I even got kudos. But Sherlock didn’t feel good to write. He is a rather... emotionally distant character. So I switched to the other fandom that has fangirls and fanboys of all ages.’ I’m silent.
Harry startles. ‘Did you just read my mind?’ he blurts out, feeling silly before he’s finished his sentence.
‘No... oh no. Auror, I will do exactly what you ask of me. Please, no cuffs.’ Her lip trembles. I’m not sure if it’s from anticipation or played fear.
Checking one last time to see if the monitoring charms are working properly, he steps into the floo. ‘Auror’s Office.’
Harry moves even further down. His tongue trailing a path to her dripping cunt. He opens her legs wider as he lies between them. His hands hold open her puss, while he licks her clit. She moans. Wow, she is just as vocal as Harry is.
He hides behind a tree. Trying to control his breathing, he feels the sturdy tree behind his back, grounding him. He realizes he doesn’t hear anything anymore. Suddenly the suspension gets too much and Draco peeks around the tree. He sees a glimpse of Harry, back towards him. Harry seems to have heard something and swirls around. As stung by a bee, Draco retreats. Fuck.
‘Bad example. Why not write about how Dean and Seamus shared their first kiss during that game of Truth or Dare?’ I shake my head. No real stories shall be written. It has to be fantasy. ‘Or... or... Snape and Parkinson in detention?’
The man waves his hand before disappearing in the mist. Harry shrugs of his uncomfortable, eerie feeling. It’s just a bloody forest and he’s a magical being himself, for fucks sake! He starts walking and immediately bumps his toe on a rather sturdy rock. ‘Damn!’ he mutters to himself, rubbing his sore foot. Looking down, he suddenly sees the cluster of stones and mushrooms he was looking for.
Funny how I think of the Potters house as home, I contemplate when I arrive there after a long day at work. I hope Gin and Har are still expecting me, because I normally don’t come here when it gets this late at the office. I just really missed the both of them.
Spent, they lie on the recliner for a little while, waiting for their breathing to even out. Malfoy gets up and casts a few cleaning charms. He dresses and tosses Harry his clothes too. ‘Mustn’t leave evidence.’ He half-jokes. The atmosphere changes. Malfoy looks at Harry from his standing position. Harry watches him as he picks up the gun. ‘I’m sorry, Harry. I really am.’
Harry startles and looks up quickly. There is a woodsman standing on the path. He’s wearing a green tunic, brown leather pants and a brown and green, pointed hat with a feather in it. He looks like he comes straight from a fairy tale. Harry shakes his head to clear it. It must be the surreal magical surroundings, Harry thinks.
He frees himself of the ropes as if they were made of licorice and pushes me backwards. The unexpectedness makes me stumble and fall. ‘Stop right there, fucking ponce.’ I run after him, quickly tugging my cock back in my pants. He is gone.
Draco’s cock tents up his trousers with immodest enthusiasm. He feels the familiar redness creep up his neck, as he drinks in the sight of a very naked Harry, clothed in only mushroom omelette. His mouth waters again, but this time the eggs are not the main reason.
I take him deeper in my mouth, hollowing my cheeks and sucking him off. My mouth produces sinful sloppy sounds as I lick, suck and swallow his prick. I love giving oral sex. And I know Harry loves receiving it. His hands are on my hair, he guides me. I pull back a bit. ‘Fuck my mouth?’ I ask him. He looks at me with pupils so dilated, I can barely see the beautiful emerald color. Not that I’m complaining. Everyone should have someone who looks at you that feral as he does at me now.
Warning: this part got a lot more intense than I intended. If rape and abuse triggers you, please don’t read. There’s no gore or too many details, but better be safe than sorry, okay?
Harry wakes from the smell of croissants. As he opens his eyes, he has trouble placing his surroundings. A blond, masked man is arranging breakfast on two trays. Harry pushes himself up, his body feeling sore. Especially his arse. Lovely memories of the previous night flood his mind and make him smile guiltily as he props himself up on a layer of cushions.
‘Do you need a mediwitch, auror Malfoy? You look like you’ve gotten a fever.’ Sybil looks at him in concern.
I pinch his nose with my other hand, until he has to gasp for air. I thrust my cock in at lightning speed, using his hair as leverage. He moans.
‘Nope, can’t do. You’re going to impress a count, lad. But okay, I’ll hold back on the feathers.’ Harry shares the details, shows him the mask and finished the call. He shakes his head. Glitters.
We are more alike than I ever knew. Ginny and I? We’re both selfish, we both know what we want. We won’t forget ourselves when making someone else happy. She just hides it better.
‘Nope. Not gloating.’ He’s searching my eyes for deceit. I feel a small smile tugging at my lips. ‘What do your auror senses tell you, Potter? What’s the verdict?’
‘Perhaps you would care to explore further in a less crowded area?’ The Count asks him as he licks his lips. Harry feels his whole body shiver with want. Not trusting his voice, he nods.
Draco decides he also wants another hole filled, so he lets go of both pricks, while he pushes Just Harry away, releasing his hard prick with a pop.
Ginny kisses me on my forehead. ‘I think he needs the bed now, luv.’  Harry swoops me up, like I’m a featherlight Disney princess, and gently carries me to the bed. The gag has left me sated but exhausted. Ginny flips open the covers and Harry lays me down so tenderly I feel I tear slide down my cheek.
‘I tried different fandoms, but I’m too old for all the new shows and bands the young girls and boys write about. So I tried a few others, but all the fandoms from our youth are almost dead and have practically no followers. So my fics still weren’t being read.’
Her brown eyes are blazing. This is one woman to keep on your side and into your sight. I wonder why she is really here. Did he cheat on her? Does she want to get back at him? I consider my answer for a while.
After a few silent moments, he asks me: ‘You know, we could have an entirely better conversation when you’re not attempting to eat our pillows?’
I close my eyes and I press my forehead against his. We’re standing in silence. Neither of us moving. I feel Harry’s breathing evening out. He isn’t making those small sounds that follow after crying ones eyes out anymore. Believe me, I know how they sound. I wailed after Harry left me, the sheer volume of it could’ve drowned out a howler. I flung all my china through the room and then broke down until I was reduced to a sore, raw bundle of sad despair.
Harry smiles, besides the dire situation he’s in. He reaches for Draco’s arm and squeezes it. ‘Not dead yet, only blind. I wouldn’t mind a kiss to take my mind off things?’ And yours, Harry thinks.
Harry feels he should protest. Anyone can see him. But he finds he doesn’t give a flying fuck. He nods. The Count’s deft fingers don’t waste time as he unbuttons his shirt slowly but deliberately, opening it to his navel. The Count takes a step back and lets his gaze slide over his body. Harry feels exposed, conscious about his scars. His body is slender and toned, but he doesn’t have the six pack some other wizards have here. What will the Count think? What was hé thinking, giving his permission to undress? He wants to cover himself up, but the Count grabs his arms.
Draco wakes up in Harry’s bed. Harry lies next to him, sound asleep. As he has no memory of getting in the bed himself, Harry must’ve carried him there. It makes Draco feel warm and fuzzy inside. The warm fuzziness starts to growl, drawing his attention to the fact that he hasn’t eaten since breakfast. And what a great breakfast it was, Draco thinks as flashes of Harry’s cock covered in omelette come to mind.
‘Take your time, love. Take your time. Let’s get to bed. We can shower in the morning. Separately, if you want. For now, we’ll just sleep. ‘Kay?’
‘That’s a great idea.’ Out of habit I grab my iWiz, wanting to jot the ideas down. His stern look makes me freeze in my movement, iWiz halfway in the air. I put it down. Plot bunnies can wait. Conversations with your real life husband are way more important.
‘So, as much as it pains me, you’re leaving me no choice but to practice what I preach.’ Harry’s hands slide down, holding still at his buckle. His darkened eyes seek out Draco’s as he waits for permission.
‘I know.’ Harry looks like he is fighting back a new fit of tears. We can’t have that. So I kiss him. Harry’s eyes do the comical quick-changing thing again before settling on the passion I didn’t realize I’d missed so much. He tilts his head and opens his mouth a bit, looking questioning. Harry! I can take a hint. No need to rub it in.
Narcissa is waiting for him. ‘She left a portal here, Mr. Potter.’ They enter one of the manor’s many parlors. Harry looks around. The parlor looks brighter in comparison to the rest of the manor. All the antique furniture is painted in a pale, blue color. The hardwood floor is sanded and finished with a light lacquer. The dark blue ceiling has rows of glinstering, dancing stars on it. ‘It’s Draco’s room.’ Narcissa tells him. And it would’ve been a lovely room, if it weren’t for the ugly, roaring portal of light in the middle of it.
Never one to back out of a challenge, Draco naturally wears his pants again the next day. Harry is already at their office, sitting at his desk. This time there is a large mug of steaming earl grey in his hands. Harry is sipping his tea, while reading the case files Draco and he are working on.
It’s a bit disappointing actually. Not nearly as kinky as I like it with him, and playing auror doesn’t really do it for me. But just as with Ginny, I would do it if it makes him happy. Maybe I can retrieve some old gear out of the attic for it. ‘Okay handsome. I’ll see if my old uniform still fits me.’
‘Will you distract me?’ He looks frightened but determined. Well, this is unexpected. I’m fumbling in my pockets, to see if I have anything useful there, when a very sinful thought forms. Who ever needed keys to distract? I nod and let him pull me into the elevator.
‘Why are you so... caring?’ Harry chooses his words careful, not wanting to break the moment they share as Malfoy walks him towards the path.
‘Fuck, Harry. Don’t safe word out on my account. I’m perfectly able to make my own fucking decisions, you sodding Saviour spoilsport.’ Draco bites at him. His eyes dart around, looking for a sturdy stick to use as a makeshift crutch. He finds one and reaches for it.
‘I... I’m sorry. I’m sorry for what I did to you all these years ago.’ Does he know what I’m talking about? It could’ve been anything.
‘What would you like, handsome? Want me to suck you off at the ministry? Want me to ready myself so you can use me as a plaything whenever you please? Want me to pretend I’m a teenage rent-boy? Let’s hear what you’ve got in store for me.’
‘We skipped this yesterday, but today we’re going to try it, okay? Want me to ride it first? So you can see what it’s like?’
The pounding intensifies. Harry’s close, he can tell. He feels Harry’s thrusts become slower, uneven, before he hears him groaning in his ear. ‘Bloody hell. So good.’ He almost stops moving, the thrusts slow and deep. Harry grunts as he pushes in one last time. Draco feels him shudder and pant. Harry removes his cock and lets go of Draco’s hair.
I’m waiting restlessly, fidgeting with the hem of my sleeve. Get a grip of yourself, Har! You’re a big, bad auror for Merlin’s sake. Not some blubbering nervous schoolgirl. A thousand ‘What if’s’ sear through my mind. I’ve hurt Draco all those years ago. Why on earth should he want me back?
I hear Ginny grin. ‘You’ll survive, hun.’ She tries to coax him to come with her, but he doesn’t budge. Ginny rolls her eyes. ‘I think I saw some stairs for scaredy cats, maybe you can take those.’ Draco glares at her.
‘Yeah. You might want to explain why you’ve kidnapped me and put me in a tower in a dress and made me perform fellatio on you?’
Draco nods, even though he doesn’t feel the same about himself. Harry presses a soft kiss to his lips and moves to get Draco a cup of flawlessly brewed tea. ‘Eat, please. Go shower. Go to work. And I might just have a surprise for you, to make you get through the long, boring day ahead.’ Draco’s eyes fly to Harry’s. Who just smirks and blows him a kiss.
Malfoy growls. ‘I know what you’re trying to do, but your distraction won’t work. You can’t rile me up to get me to fight with you, so you can escape. No, Potter. I plan to fuck you. Right here. And nothing you say can undo that.’
She thinks a bit. ‘Oh yeah, as I’m an utter idle housewife, I expect both of you to take turns to cook for our weekly meetings too. And that’s about it.’ She looks at Draco, expectantly.
Tears well up in Draco’s eyes. His voice comes out hoarse. ‘I want to... I want to get this off my chest. But I’m not sure if I’m ready.’
‘Oh, don’t hold back now, oh grand Savior Prince of mine.’ He feels Draco smiling against his cock. ‘I do like to swallow.’ Expertly, he greedily sucks Harry’s cock in again. That’s it. Harry’s vision turns blurry and he comes with a low grunt. He empties himself in Draco’s throat, spurting his semen deep down. Draco swallowing it to the last drop must be one of the sexiest things Harry has ever seen. Draco wipes a trickle of spunk away with his thumb, and sucks it clean. He looks at Harry with a lopsided grin. ‘Hello Harry.’
Waking up that morning is strange. He misses the warmth of all those bodies around him. Harry is nowhere to be seen, his doubles have vanished. He finds himself missing them already. He had enjoyed himself thoroughly last night. He felt so powerful, thinking up a scenario by himself. Just remembering it makes him blush. He gets up and feels the delicious soreness in his arse. Good. Today every move will remind him of Harry.
‘Distracting, what does it look like?’ I grin as I kiss him, my hands caressing his arse and lower back. He moans into my mouth as he is kissing back. Before we know it, the elevator stops and with a loud ‘ping’ the doors open. I see Ginny standing outside the elevator, grinning broadly. ‘That’s clever, luv.’
Draco notices Harry doesn’t watch Ron or Hermione’s tush, or that of the ludicrously hot new guy from the owl-care service who just started working at the ministry. It seems only Draco’s plush little behind does it for Boy Wonder. Slytherin to the bone, Draco decides to test his theory.
She gives me an intense stare that reminds me of my mother. ‘I’m here to ask you what I couldn’t find the courage for then. Because at that point I didn’t know of how much love Harry is capable. Or maybe I did, but maybe I wasn’t ready yet.’
Sexy Arse’s hard-on brushes against Draco’s butt when he starts licking stripes on Draco’s back. Boy Toy undresses himself first, then he starts taking off Just Harry’s clothes too. Just Harry releases Draco’s lips to remove his own boxers and tosses them in a far corner.
His owl arrives in the late afternoon, two days after our meeting. I was starting to get afraid he or Ginny changed their minds.
Not true at all, Draco feels his hands clench under the desk. James Jones is notorious for his bad decisions and awful planning. He tends to blame others for his own fuck ups. All the aurors dislike him. ‘You absolutely never asked me such a thing, sir. I would’ve remembered, being half your age.’ He tries to be respectful, but he can’t stand injustice. Jones pisses him off.
‘I’m not eating off the bloody floor, if that’s what you’re insinuating!’ Draco’s eyes are suddenly blazing.
Sniffling from laughter, I tell him ‘We have to talk about this, okay? But not right now. Let’s order some food.’
The Count is an excellent dancer, Harry thinks as they float around effortlessly. Harry has long ago learned how to dance properly. He turned out to be a more gifted dancer than he ever expected. He feels the Count’s hands on his body, sending shivers down his spine. It’s thrilling, being led instead of leading the dance. The Count guides Harry into a full body sway. He is surprised by the movement, but leans into it, trusting the Count to pull him up again. When he does, Harry’s face is very close to the Count’s. He feels his breath hitch in his throat. The Count smiles a lopsided grin.
I get off her back and pull her up. She looks so hot. Her blouse is partly open, revealing her tits, her hair ruffled and her skirt is askew. I open her lush mouth (she struggles, of course) and hold my thumb in front of it. ‘If you bite me, I’ll make sure to punish you, understood? And do I have to remind you that there is a word you can use to stop me?’
Cautious I take a small step into the greenery. Harry looks up. His beautiful face is swollen from tears, his breathing comes in small, ragged gasps. Wait, do I still think him beautiful? I’d do, don’t I? I’m so fucked. I close half the distance between me and him. Suddenly a bitter expression flickers over Harry’s face as he recognizes me.
‘DIDN’T I?’ Harry stomps both of his hands next to Draco’s head. Draco’s pulse races, he’s out of breath. This isn’t the easygoing Harry he knows. And it’s frightfully arousing.
Harry’s voice pulls him out off his spiraling thoughts. ‘Dray, you’re doing it again. Please, just listen to me.’ Harry grabs his chin and turns him to face him. ‘I really like you, love. I want to see as much of you as I can. I want to take care of you. Want to spoil you. Want you to feel at home here. Want to have kinky sex with you, but also make love to you and cuddle with you. You’re perfect. Am I understood?’
Harry wakens by the sound of an owl knocking on his window. Quickly he lets him in, giving him a small treat. The owl hoots in appreciation and drops his parcel, before flying out again.
‘Mr. Potter, it has come to my ears that you’ve double crossed me. Doing business with another auror too.’
‘You need to see a mindhealer, Potter. This isn’t okay. I’ve never seen anyone not flinching when there was a gun held at their head. And trust me, I’ve got some fucking experience in the matter.’ Malfoy seems to suddenly realize what he’s supposed to do to Harry and grimaces. He grabs Harry’s chin and forces him to look at him.
He looks at himself in the mirror. Wow. He looks royal with the mask on. The eye sockets leave just enough space to give a glimpse of his eyes, without giving away his identity immediately. His fingers trace the pattern of the mask. The mask makes him feel strangely sensual. He feels his prick twitch a bit. Harry appreciates the feeling as it’s been a while.
Harry shuts my thoughts with an equal languid kiss, his hands touching my half flaccid prick, smearing my come all over me, before cleaning all of us with a wandless charm. Show off.
‘Love, how can you know you don’t want it, if you’ve never tried it before? It’ll be so good if you let me. And you’ll let me, because you’re such a good boy and you’ve been so good to us. Now let me return the pleasure.’
After the arse-ogling incident on the stairs, Draco finds himself watching Harry. He catches him staring at his butt countless times, but Harry’s always confident in returning his gaze, leaving Draco flustered and wondering if maybe he’s seeing too much in this.
He makes his way over to his desk, stomach grumbling. Good sex always makes him hungry. Shit, he’s forgotten all about lunch! The canteen will be closed now. Fuck. His legs tangle in something and he all but falls on the ground. He’s glad Harry’s already left, because he would laugh his arse off over Draco’s clumsiness. Feeling his way, he makes out a rectangular shape. Carefully he lifts the fabric, uncovering a wicker basket. He looks at the fabric. It’s the invisibility cloak! Harry left it. Unguarded. With him, of all people. Wow. Suddenly a bit overwhelmed by his trust, he swallows.
Harry lets his prick fall out of his mouth. ‘Malfoy, I didn’t Muffliate without reason. You not making noise just won’t do. If you continue to hold back those lovely sounds that slip your mouth, I’ll be taking measures.’ He slides Draco’s cock between his lips, sucking him in deeper this time and releasing again. Draco lets out a content moan. ‘Damn, you’re good a this’.
Harry gets up. ‘I could use a nice after sex shower, couldn’t you?’ Stark naked, he walks to his bathroom, his cock lazily swaying from side to side. ‘Coming?’
I cancel the cock ring spell and push my prick in her mouth. Man, the look of a woman (or man) putting her mouth around your cock, seeing it disappear inch by inch between her wet, soft lips. It’s the most fucking gorgeous thing you’ll ever see.
Harry gets up. ‘The shower is all yours, if you want. Make it quick.’ His eyes shine mischievously ‘Come downstairs when you’re finished. If you’re a good boy, I’ll let you have that breakfast from a plate.’
The portkey transports him into a small booth. Mirrors surround him. He waits a moment to let the dizziness wear off and checks his outfit. Retying the ribbon in his hair and checking one last time to make sure the mask is securely in place, he exits. A long hallway with many booths like the one he just came out leads to an enormous, oaken double door. It’s plated with golden latticework and leads into what Harry suspects is the ballroom. He makes his way over to it, his stomach feeling jittery.
A pesky ray of sunlight is forcing itself obtrusively in Draco’s eyes. Draco finds himself waking from it, in the middle of the day. Disoriented for a minute, he looks around and sees Harry in his bed. Wait, not his bed. Harry’s. Harry is looking at him like he’s the most gorgeous thing he’s ever seen.
Malfoy’s eyes soften. ‘I am not a monster, Harry. I will use lube. But I also will fuck that arse of yours. If you don’t want me to, this is your change to walk away.’ Malfoy retreats a bit, giving Harry space to get away. Harry’s mind whirls. Is he really doing this? He feels his arousal and something else. Trust. Hmm, strange. Where did that come from? He looks up at Malfoy, eyes determined, jaw set firm.
Malfoy puts his hands next to Harry’s head, his leg in between Harry’s. Harry is trapped. He feels arousal rush through him.
‘Dare what, Precious?’ He hooks his finger into the ribbon in Harry’s hair and pulls it, letting his soft curls fall loose. A mocking laugh plays at his lips as he tucks the ribbon in his pocket. He looks back at Harry, eyes suddenly serious. ‘We both know what you want, Saviour. But the choice to give in to your desire is yours.’ He tucks Harry’s hair behind his ears. The gentle gesture throws him off balance.
Unable to stop himself, Draco lets out a loud moan. Shit, he didn’t mean to do that. Why is he always so loud? He bites his lip to prevent further embarrassing sounds.
He is running in the opposite direction of the forest border, because Harry surely won’t be expecting that. Only flaw in his logic? The edge of the forest is much farther away. Fuck. Draco’s feet screech to a halt.
I take off my shoes and fill up a kettle of water. I need some tea, or my brain’ll stop functioning. The electric kettle that Harry got us makes quite the noise. So much, that I miss the creaking noises coming from the bedroom.
He gets up and leans over, underarms flat on the table, propping himself up to allow Harry the best access. Harry unfastens Draco’s belt and with one swift movement lowers his pants and boxers. His finger enters his hole. ‘Oh my, such a lovely, tight arse. You don’t know what you do to me, Draco Malfoy.’
‘I knew it would work.’ Narcissa practically beams, for as far as her uptight nature allows it. Harry steps into the portal, only his head in view for Narcissa.
He wants to get up, but Harry grabs his wrist. ‘Don’t. I’m not done yet.’ Harry’s voice has darkened and has a raw edge to it. His eyes are blazing.
‘Are you always this bossy in bed?’ Harry smiles as he starts moving. Draco’s moans spur him on and he starts thrusting for real.
He nods. ‘Ginny and I already talked a lot about this. We both feel that, if you want it too, we should have a conversation together.’
‘See?’ He looks entirely too smug as he resumes lathering my arse in lube and adding a finger, his other hand stroking my cock.
‘Bellatrix showed up here, screaming and telling me what a traitor I was. How she wanted to punish me. And how an avada was too considerate. She wanted me to suffer, Mr. Potter. So she...’ Narcissa’s voice wavers. Taking a moment, she collects herself again. ‘She took him into another realm. I don’t know where, but she told me only true and requited love could set him free. And that his cold heart would never be able to love. I went after him, but the portal wouldn’t open for me. I think it has to be a lovers interest, not a mothers love. I know how he thinks of you, Mr. Potter. And I can only hope you feel the same way. Please, Mr. Potter. Help him.’
The impact his undergarments have on him, doesn’t escape Draco’s notice. He smiles and wiggles his hips seductively. ‘Maybe you should ask if Drapunzel minds if you fuck him.’
‘Didn’t anyone tell you wandering into a magical forest with werewolves was a bad idea, Saviour boy?’ Malfoy’s face is so close, Harry can smell him. He smells earthy and musky.
‘The bit where I still have my wand, and you, dear Mr. Potter, are wandless?’ I lunge at his stomach, head forward, and hit him so hard, I hear his air escaping him. He staggers, but manages to keep upright. He runs away. I quickly vanish the cord.
‘Do you like this?’ I twist the plug a bit, eliciting a moan from Harry. He sags through his arms and leans his head onto his underarm, stifling his moans. ‘Or do you want me to replace it with something larger?’ In one rapid movement I pull out the plug and line my cock up with his hole. He whimpers at the loss of fullness and wriggles his arse. I can see he finds it hard to stay in character. Well, that makes two of us.
He hears Harry’s footsteps nearing. Damn, he’s close! Draco presses himself closer to the bark of the tree.
When late afternoon arrives, he forces himself to eat some hot, buttered toast topped with strawberry jam. It’s all he manages to swallow, his throat tight, butterflies in his stomach. Harry showers, brushes his teeth and shaves. He tames his long and curly hair and rubs some coconut oil in it, making him smell like beach and summer. He ties his hair back in a loose ponytail. He uses the gorgeous golden elastic ribbon Hermione once gave him for special occasions. It sparkles in the light and forms a pretty contrast to his dark hair.
Sometimes he hates his blush. It shows up at inconvenient times, making him feel like a love struck teenager. But not wanting to blush only makes matters worse, so he’s long ago learned to just give in to it. Let it happen, there’s nothing that can change it anyway.
‘Harry! So good to see you!’ His warm, deep voice envelops around Harry, making him feel comfortable instantaneous. If only Dean wasn’t as straight as a pencil and one of his best friends, Harry wouldn’t have minded going out with him at all. Dean is calm, efficient and selfsure. And of course quite the sight to look at, his toned, broad body always clad in the best fitting trousers. Harry wonders how his firm arse would feel when he would stroke it through said fitting trousers. He smiles at his wicked thought and realizes Dean is waiting for an answer. He blushes a bit. Damn.
‘Draco, it’s hard for me...’ His look is serious. Darn, this is the moment he’s going to tell me it was all a mistake.
Harry starts unbuttoning Draco’s shirt. Draco pushes him off, casting a quick scourgify on himself. Seeing the disappointment in Harry’s eyes, het tells him ‘I already came thrice, you know. Now it’s time for me to repay the service.’ Draco pushes him on the bed, tugging his trousers down for better access and casting a protection spell for safety. He gives him a proper blowjob, Harry’s moans as he sucks him off tell him it’s received well. He swallows every drop.
His eyes focus on me, provocation clearly visible there. He smiles a little crooked smile and shakes his head slowly. The challenge it holds goes straight to my cock.
I shake my head. ‘Are you being oblivious for a reason, Draco? It’s not what I mean and you know it.’ I see anger flashing in his steely grey eyes.
Draco grins and drapes himself on the bed, legs spread widely, arms above his head. Harry kneels on the bed and starts massaging his smooth, stocking clad legs. He works his way up, sliding his hands over Draco’s thighs, carefully avoiding his hard-on, trailing the girdle up to his nipples. The little buds are peeking up just above the girdle, waiting to be tweaked. Harry casts a wandless lube spell and slicks Draco’s nipples before pinching them. Draco moans. Harry caresses the sore spots on his throat before making his way up. He covers Draco’s body with his own as he trails his arms with his hands. He weaves his fingers in Draco’s as he starts to grind against Draco’s erection. ‘Fuck, Harry.’
‘Don’t worry, Precious. As the world falls down, I’ll be there for you.’ The champagne is delicious. Harry finishes it far too quickly. He feels his head spin a bit.
Draco’s brought a posh looking jar of chocolate cookies and a bouquet of bright yellow daffodils for Gin. She takes them flustered. ‘Thanks, hun. That’s real gentlemanly of you. It almost makes me forget you’re screwing my husband.’ I startle at her jibe, but Draco lets out a bellow of laughter. She laughs too.
Harry gets on his knees and slicks his cock. ‘There now, that wasn’t so hard, was it?’ He takes Draco’s leg and puts it over his shoulder, while Draco wraps his other leg around Harry’s waist. He rubs his cock against Draco’s entrance. Slowly, Harry pushes in. ‘Fuuuuck.’ Draco’s posh voice swearing profanities does strange things to Harry’s prick. Harry keeps on pushing, until he’s fully buried inside. He takes a moment to enjoy the warm, tight confines of Draco’s perfect arse.
Harry moans. ‘I’m gonna come. So good. You’re so good. So... ah... good... ah...’ Harry’s semen spurts deep into my throat as I come. I swallow it, seeing stars as I gently keep stroking my clit to prolong my orgasm. Harry takes out his cock and lies next to me. ‘I love it when you do that’ He tells me, looking at me like I’m the filthiest, sexiest thing alive. It makes me feel wanted.
Just Harry starts pounding Draco’s arse in earnest. Every other thrust he reaches Draco’s pleasure point, which makes Draco see white spots. Just Harry’s prick makes sopping noises as he keeps on plunging balls deep into Draco. Sexy Arse sets a relentless pace in fucking his mouth. His hand is entangled in Draco’s hair, pulling him up with every thrust. The throbbing pain would’ve made him come if he hadn’t had the cock ring on.
‘Yes, but Harry won’t save you, will he? You should’ve been kinder to him.’ Drapunzel shakes his head vigorously. Something is very wrong indeed. He must collect himself. He wipes the tears from his face. No use in crying. It won’t solve anything. He feels his wet dress clinging to his chest. New clothes! Yes, that always cheers him up. He walks up the stairs to his bedroom in the top of the tower. It’s a dark place, with a large four poster bed with heavy, burgundy curtains. The only light seeps through a small, round window in the ceiling. Drapunzel has an enormous 18th century wardrobe. It’s heavy mahogany doors creak as he opens them. Inside are beautiful dresses and gorgeous undergarments. His luxury robes are hung on the side of the wardrobe.
It’s always strange, being in someone else’s kitchen, but Draco makes do. He finds some tagliatelle in a cupboard, and some eggs, Parmesan, bacon, onions, garlic and cream. And an unopened bottle of dry Martini. Perfect! Draco cooks the tagliatelle al dente, with just enough bite. He chops the onions, fries them until they are tender and translucent. He sets them apart and fries the bacon to a crispy perfection, then adds a splash of vermouth. He lets it bubble away, allowing it form a thick, salty and sweet syrup. He burns his tongue slightly while tasting the hot goo. Fuck!
We sit down in the muggle restaurant. Thank goodness he didn’t take us to a pub. I would’ve been ludicrously overdressed. He looks at me like I’m the most gorgeous human being on earth. It delights me, until I realize he looks at at least one other person like this. It brings me down to earth quicker than a dragon with wing cramps.
She trembles, her eyes rolling back, her nipples hardening. She moans both of our names as she shudders and comes. If I could get any harder, I would.
Draco hesitates. Maybe this wasn’t a good idea after all. Harry is his senior partner. Maybe he just meant it when he told him these pants were unfit for duty. Harry hasn’t spotted him yet. He still has time to go to the lockers and change into his auror pants. Yes, that’s a most wise decision. Draco withdraws.
‘I started writing about us, you know. But people don’t ship us. They think we’re too vanilla. Too domestic. They write me like I’m some direct gal who knows exactly what she wants in bed and knows no shame, and you as Mister Perfect, Forgiving Auror and Saviour of all Wizardkind, with rock solid abs that could crush a walnut when you’re doing crunches.’ He sniggers.
‘Potter, why isn’t anything ever easy with you?’ Malfoy looks at him in exasperation before he closes the distance and hauls Harry to his feet. Feet not working properly from the awkward sitting position, Harry stumbles. Malfoy throws the gun onto the sofa as he pushes Harry onto the recliner and straddles him. He captures Harry’s mouth in a rough kiss. Harry opens his lips to give Malfoy better access. Malfoy groans as he plunders his mouth.
Harry leans in and whispers: ‘Just so you know, you looked so fucking beautiful. I almost came untouched from the sight of your mesmerizing toss-session. You are such a good boy, aren’t you? I can’t wait to bend you over and fuck that precious arse of yours. Gorgeous man.’ Draco feels high on praise, discomfort forgotten.
‘Where are you, Draco dear?’ Harry’s voice sounds borderline insane. He knows it’s not real, but it’s frightening as fuck anyways. Draco feels his legs cramp up and his ankle is throbbing, both are burning from the effort running takes. He has to take a break.
‘I’ll teach you!’ Draco replies enthusiastically. ‘You know Mary Jewry’s* mom was a Malfoy? So we got the recipe first hand.’
‘Please, you.’ Before I loose my courage to go through with this, Draco thinks. Before you think I’m crazy for wanting terrible things.
I’m nervous as Draco knocks. Will they get along? It’ll only work if we’re all in this together. He enters, looking gorgeous. His long hair is shining, as are his eyes. I can see he’s nervous too. We both freeze at the doorstep, not knowing how to greet.
Harry has three fingers in his arse now and starts to scissor them a bit. His eyes roll back in pleasure. I see his cock filling even more, standing proud.
‘Let’s just say I have a thing for blond, haughty, posh, cocksure wankers. And yesterday you were two of my fantasies in one. Jareth wannabe.’
A car passes his street, lighting up the strangers face for a moment. Malfoy. Harry keeps his face schooled, even if his first instinct is to yell out in surprise. He sees Malfoy has noticed his recognition nevertheless. Harry stays silent. There’s no sound but the ticking of his clock.
‘Good morning, love’ Harry greets, as if no awkward conversation has happened yesterday. ‘Breakfast? I’ll whip up some omelettes, if you like?’
‘You take this ride then, and see if I care if you don’t come out in one piece.’ He makes a face at her.
‘Don’t prolong the inevitable, please.’ Harry‘s voice isn’t as steady as he would’ve liked it to be.
Harry is ranting on. ‘So don’t you fucking dare to start, Ginny Weasley. I can see right through your bloody deceit!’
Draco wakes up in Harry’s bed. He feels sore and bruised. Just as he likes it. His hair smells fresh and feels fluffy. As if it’s been washed. He blushes a bit. Did Harry wash his whole body? He does smell like Harry’s soap. He looks up and sees Harry sitting next to him on a chair, putting down the book he was reading. ‘Good, you’re awake. How are you feeling?’
‘Oh no. Oh no. You don’t get to do this to me, Potter. Not after all these years. I won’t be second best if you have lady troubles. No. The moment you’ve reconciled, you’ll go running to her, abandoning me. Again.’
To his surprise, Harry doesn’t give the normal reaction of pity or repulsion. He just watches him and nods, eyes transfixed on the scars. There’s something predatory about his gaze, something that makes Draco feel strangely wanted. Almost imperceptible, Harry licks his lips. Shit, they are both raving mad, aren’t they? Harry tears his gaze from his body as Draco continues.
Back at the table, he looks at Harry expectantly. The waiter returns with a large plate of delicious, gooey treacle tart, molten lava cakes, plain evil chocolate pudding, flawless strawberries and luscious orange mousse.
I push her away and get up, looking sternly at her. I’m using what Gin calls my ‘Head Auror Potter glare’. I notice her reaction to it. She shifts on the swing, eyes dark, small smirk on her lips. If I keep this stance up, she’ll be trembling with anticipation.
‘No thanks, lass. I would rather help you and gossip about Mister Potter, if it’s the same to you.’ Ginny laughs and holds out her arm.
Instead of being angry, she swats his arm and laughs. ‘Draco, you utter cunt. Harry’s trying to have his bloody important conversation here.’ He laughs too as they share a moment of eye contact. I feel a bit left out and realize that’s how they sometimes must feel too.
He smiles. ‘That would make me predictable. Where is the fun in that?’ His finger is already searching out my hole, as he gently presses the tip in.
Boy Toy starts groaning and comes in long, hot spurts over Draco’s hair and back, making him filthy and sticky. Sexy Arse stills. The thickening of his cock is a telltale sign for Draco. Sexy Arse tries to take his cock out, but Draco grabs his shaft and sucks out his orgasm. Sexy Arse screams his name as he comes. Draco feels his semen coating his throat as he swallows it down to the last drop.
‘I hate what you’ve been through.’ Shite, pity is even worse. Draco knows he is deranged, he had enjoyed the rape, the overpowering and even some of the torture. He doesn’t want someone feeling sorry for him. Doesn’t deserve it. He had thought Harry, of all people, would understand. Would know what to do, would save him, would give him what he needs.
The Count, Malfoy, lets out his wondrous laugh again. ‘Oh, Potter.’ He turns serious. ‘Aren’t you mad?’
Harry resumes his tender caress as he flicks his tongue over Draco’s lips, nibbling at his upper lip. Harry’s tongue grazes softly between his lips, as he deliberately starts darting it in and out. Draco stifles a little moan. It’s like Harry’s fucking his lips. It’s fucking sexy. He feels his cock getting incredibly interested. Again.
‘Would it be wrong to have a bit of fun?’ He can almost hear Ginny’s voice in his head. ‘Sweetheart, please. Go live a little. Have fun. Do it for me.’ He knows he’ll probably hate every second of it, but he has made up his mind. He’s going. At least he’s going to be incognito. Oh, that reminds him. He needs new clothes. His usual formal is attire too recognizable. He’ll floo Dean tomorrow.
‘No fucking way!’ Draco blushes. ‘I’m so sorry. I have no idea where that came from. I seem to behave badly. Mother was right to punish me.’ A tear wells up in Draco’s eyes.
He dries the front of his legs, leaving off at his feet. Harry gets back up, leaving a trail of slow butterfly kisses, worshipping his whole body. The kisses go up from his foot, his lower leg, knee, inside of his thighs. ‘So intelligent, hardworking, reliable.’
Harry shakes the envelope. A gorgeous, Italian handmade mask falls out. It’s painted a deep emerald green, off white and gold. It features a traditional diamond harlequin pattern. The golden lines on the mask are adorned in rhinestones and diamonds. Harry flips it over a few times. The precious stones gleam in the sunlight, creating stunning rainbows of lights. They give the mask a remarkable sort of life.
‘This turns you on, right? I haven’t forgotten.’ He releases my hands and lines up his cock with my hole. As he presses it in, I groan at the sensation. It has been so long anyone touched me there, I have trouble relaxing.
Harry stills. So Draco does too. ‘I will open up that arse of yours and stick my cock in. I will fuck you until you see stars.’ Suddenly Harry peeks around the tree. ‘Found you.’ A devilish grin forms on his lips.
‘Potter, always the Saviour of fluffy kittens and reformed hitwizards.’ Harry rolls his eyes. ‘You’re not asking. I’m offering.’
‘Excellent. You boys do that. I’ll just watch from behind.’ Sexy Arse gets on his knees next to Boy Toy. Draco doesn’t know where to look. Two swollen cocks, dangling in front of him. Alternately he takes them in his mouth, sucking them, licking them, fondling with them. They both grab his hair.
Suddenly the ground is being pulled from under him, as Harry tackles him in a move a professional muggle rugby player would be jealous of. He swirls around as Harry pins him to the ground.
She lies there, a panting mess of disarranged perfection. I cancel the spell and rub her slim wrists to get the circulation back, before lying next to her.
Malfoy’s tongue flicks down, between his cheeks, until it stops at his hole. He circles the puckered hole, before dipping in. Harry moans, wanting more. The wet warmness of Malfoy’s tongue makes him squirm. Malfoy pushes his tongue in again, fucking him with it. He whirls it around, exploring the ridges of his hole. Harry has to force himself to stay still, as he wants to move so badly to feel more. Just as he is as open as he thinks he can be, Malfoy removes his tongue.
I get on my back, top of my head just a bit outside the bed so I can tilt it more easily. Harry straddles me and presses his cock in my mouth, using his hand to guide it in. Careful at first, but he knows I like it rough. His mouth forms a predatory grin when he grabs my hair and pushes me onto his cock. I relax my mouth and swallow him. Deep.
Harry feels a cool, slippery substance on his entrance. Malfoy presses in his finger, nails retracted, gently pushing. The first finger is easy, as Harry is relaxed and needy from the rimming. Malfoy presses in his second finger. Harry moans. It hurts. He feels stretched to an uncomfortable level. Malfoy removes his fingers.
‘That is enough talking for now, ma’am.’ I’m switching to an even sterner voice. ‘Hands against the window pane, ma’am.’
Almost there! One small chapter left and after that three seperate installments of smut. They won’t be added as chapters to this fic, because the roleplay elements (non-con) result in a change of warnings and I don’t feel like that does justice to this fic.
Harry looks at me, waiting for more. When it doesn’t come, he tells me more than he asks: ‘So you started writing Harry Potter fics.’ Averting my eyes, I nod. I feel a flush creeping over my cheeks.
Sighing, Draco gets his quill and the requested report. He sits back at his desk and starts writing. Suddenly he feels something brush up his leg. He looks under the desk, but sees nothing. Shrugging it off, he starts to work. Suddenly he feels his legs being nudged apart.
Malfoy kneels behind him, opening his arse and lining up his cock. Careful, almost gentle, he pushes in. Bit by bit. Harry feels himself opening, his body trying to accommodate Malfoy’s hard prick. It’s overwhelming and it hurts. Malfoy’s strokes his hair and back.
‘Molly isn’t feeling well, ever since she caught the Dragon pox. I think we should do something for her, don’t you agree?’
Hesitantly, Draco steps out from behind the curtain. His long dress rustles as he goes. Harry lets out a surprised gasp. A rush of want seeps through him. Draco looks stunning is his apricot dress.
Draco sits at his desk. He’s out of his mind from boredom. All his files have been sorted alphabetically, his paperwork done. He’s almost happy when senior auror Jones barges in. ‘Draco, where the fuck is that report on the Fleetwoods case? I fucking told you to finish it last week!’ He mutters something about fucking incompetent young men being allowed to join the force.
‘I’m Drapunzel.’ He smiles tentatively. ‘Are you prince Harry?’ He blushes even further, crimson red spots showing. Fuck, Harry is screwed. He looks so deliciously innocent.
I nod and try to ignore the pang of jealousy that flares up. We finish our plates and go back to our... shed would be granting it more credit than it deserves. Cupboard? No, that would be unnecessary insensitive. Broom cabinet? Yes, that’s much better.
‘No shit.’ Malfoy grins as he halts to let Harry adjust to his cock. Harry looks at him. It’s difficult to grasp that this man, almost considerate and wanting to give Harry pleasure, is the same as his hotheaded, posh school bully and the cold blooded killer he saw earlier.
Suddenly Malfoy’s breathes in his ear, the words forming a warm trickle against his skin. ‘Touch yourself. It makes it easier.’ His tongue licks a stripe on Harry’s ear. Tentatively Harry touches his cock. If he isn’t careful, he’ll come right there, on the spot. Spreading his precome on his cock, he slowly moves his foreskin up and down. The pleasure makes him shudder. He doesn’t even notice Malfoy’s fingers returning to his hole. Doesn’t notice two fingers becoming three.
‘Come for me, pet. Scream for me.’ He pants. I feel his cock stiffening and know how close he is. My hand flies over my cock. Draco’s perfect prick hits my prostate once more and I come, spilling all over my hand, stomach and Draco’s stomach. I scream his name while I do it, eliciting a loud moan from him. His thrusting becomes erratic and suddenly he stills and shudders. He moans as he comes, buried deep in my arse.
Slowly he starts moving, pushing in deeper with every thrust. Draco groans in discomfort. ‘Don’t worry, love. It will get better soon’. Harry pulls Draco’s hair, tilting his head upward a bit. His other hand grips his hip fiercely. ‘Look at you, you are such a precious thing, taking my cock so beautifully.’ Harry starts setting a pace.
‘I’m going to caress your arse, worship it like it has never been worshipped before. I bet you’ve never been petted between your cheeks?’ Just Harry opens his arsecheeks and gently strokes between them.
‘He looked so fragile in those moments, his thoughts so far away. When I asked him about it, he told me that decisions weren’t fair. That you sometimes had to choose between two good things. Two perfect things. And neither choice would ever be right. I always thought he was talking about Fred and George, or about how the death of Tonks made sure her son, Teddy, grows up in a better world. But now... ‘ She is silent for a while. I let her gather her thoughts as I sip my Earl Grey.
So I kiss him. Gently, on his lips. I stroke his hair and tell him sweet words. How I feel for him. How he deserves happiness after all he’s been through. How much I want to see him content. He looks at me again, unable to grasp my reaction.
‘That feels so good, love. It would feel even better for me if I could put some more cock into your perfect mouth.’ Just Harry takes Draco’s hair and guides his mouth onto his prick. Draco opens up obediently and swallows him. Harry keeps pressing his cock deeper, making Draco choke.
Draco swallows and averts his eyes. His voice is strangely devoid of emotion when he starts talking. ‘The Dark Lord told me it was a test. A test if I was resilient enough to take my mark. At first it wasn’t so bad. It was pure physical violence. They used me to blow off steam. I didn’t mind. It made me feel important, to be the one to relieve their stress. I fought them all and I felt proud even if I lost. As a disturbing side effect it also turned me on. It made me think about all those duels you and I had and suddenly things clicked into place.’
He really is seriously pissed now. I can tell. Okay. Only one way to go now. I’ll just dust off the hysterics. I’m sorry dear, but you asked for it. I pout my lips, as I angrily seize the iWiz out of his hands.
‘Oh, Harry. Thanks for your confidence in me.’ The Count strokes his hair gently, pressing a few locks behind his ears. He presses a soft kiss on Harry’s forehead.
I nod. ‘I’ve reserved seats at the restaurant. We’ll talk there. Right now, I have more urgent needs.’ He returns my look with a desire that makes my spine turn into a liquid.
‘Want me to do all the hard work, Potter? I never knew you were this lazy. You’d better make it up to me later.’ He thrusts in. I moan. Again. I moan louder.
‘Count Flagler, would you please sit down?’ The small wizard sighs in exasperation. The Count is pacing up and down his dining room.
‘Don’t you dare!’ Harry eyes are blazing. Is this Count really going to reveal him to everyone if he doesn’t kiss him?
Harry’s hand moves to his cock. He starts tugging it. ‘I won’t last long, Count’. He’s been aroused ever since he stepped into the ballroom. He won’t make it for another five minutes.
The wetness subsides. ‘Don’t forget that report.’ Hastily, Draco returns to his job. He’ll be really proud of himself if it will come out making any sense.
Harry is swearing. He normally doesn’t, that’s why I know he’s serious. It’s time to send in the big guns, so I make my lip tremble and start crying.
‘So tight.’ The Counts voice turns into a loud groan as his thrusts become unsteady. With one last thrust the Count comes too, his face distorted in pleasure. After a moment of quiet, he tells Harry slightly out of breath: ‘That was bloody amazing.’ Harry grins, too dazed to reply. The Count pulls out his cock and leans in on Harry.
The towel makes its way to his back, sliding over his arse. ‘So round, so firm.’ Harry kneads his arse through the towel.
‘I know, she thinks you work too hard. And that you didn’t take enough time to recover from the threats in your last case.’ Harry had been run over by a car and was dragged by it halfway across town by two hitwizards that luckily hadn’t been in the business for long. Nor did they have their driving license. Hermione has been worried ever since. But Harry hasn’t felt a thing. No anger, no fear. Nothing. It’s been a while since he’s felt anything, really. Must be a professional deformation. Living with fear making him fearless or something.
Gradually, we both calm down. The crying subsides to tiny sobs. We’re both silent, save for the blubbering sounds we make every now and then. They sound awful. And somehow funny.
He lies next to me and strokes my hair. I’m still recovering from a mind blowing orgasm. I love it when we play and I particularly like our Badass auror scenes. Harry doesn’t always feel like it though, it’s too close to his everyday job, but he sometimes does it for me.
‘You are so good to them, love. Look at them. They can’t believe you’re doing this. They are so close because of your perfect slutty hands moving over their pricks. But it isn’t fair. You’ve only gotten two hands, am I right?’ Draco can see where this is going, and he nods vigorously.
‘Never!’ Draco stares back defiantly, slightly tilting his chin. Harry grabs Draco’s hair and pulls back. Draco moans as Harry licks a stripe in his neck, finishing with a bite. Draco’s cock is so fucking hard, it feels like its ready to burst right out of his boxers.
‘Really? Wouldlikezat’ Harry should feel silly or even uncomfortable, passing out after sex. But instead he feels strangely safe and protected. He tries to get up and wobbles. Yep, that champagne was a very bad idea. The Count is up in a jiffy, his strong arms catching Harry before he falls. He guides him to the bed. He gently lays Harry down on it, pulls of his trousers off again and tucks him in. The Count looks at Harry for confirmation when he moves his hand to the nape of Harry’s neck. Harry nods sleepily, and the Count removes his mask. Harry takes down his glamour, smiling feebly. The Count looks surprised at the sudden display of trust.
Compose yourself, Draco. You know what mother told you. If they have knowledge they will use it against you. I take on a neutral expression. ‘Why do you want to know?’ She must never know how betrayed I felt when Harry choose her over me. No one ever must.
He feels his hole opening some more. Malfoy’s prick slides over the sensitive receptors inside his arse, making it easier. Carefully, Malfoy starts to move. Harry moans. It’s not entirely from pleasure. Yet. Malfoy puts one leg up, the other still in kneeling position, and grabs the armrests for better grip as he pounds in Harry.
Malfoy just laughs and thrusts again and again, making Harry see white stars. Malfoy’s breathing quickens, as does his pace.
‘Oh sweetie, we can’t have you waking your mummy.’ He smiles and does a silly dance, distracting Rose. ‘You’re just as curious as your mom. You can’t wait to go and explore the world, can you?’ He spells the chair to wobble softly, hoping it’ll soothe her.
‘Searching.’ I simply reply as I touch her tits, knead them and push them together. I slip my hands in her bra and search out her nipples. I stroke them until they are hard like cherry pits under my fingers.
Malfoy blinks, before the meaning of Harry’s words dawn on him. His eyes turn feral. His teeth blink as he growls. ‘Let’s get you out of your cape, Little Red Riding Hood’.
Fuck, they’ve planned this. This will be brilliant, my mind supplies, as I feel my knee pits bump into the chair.
Draco’s prick swells dizzying quickly. Knowing Harry’s just as turned on as he is, he feels his confidence returning. His silvery eyes sparkle mischievously as he tells Harry: ‘you didn’t just notice them yesterday, did you? Oh no, I bet you thought about it every evening in bed.’
Harry looks back. Something in his eyes is off. Malfoy looks questioningly, as if he wonders what it is. Harry spells his clothing on. The spell is a useful one indeed. He watches as the gears in Malfoy’s head click in place. He sees his eyes widen and the horror showing on his face, as he whirls around and dashes for the gun. Harry waits until he’s got it.
As Harry enters the ballroom, his jaw drops slightly. A lush red carpet leads into an opulently decorated room. Glistening icelike chandeliers are hanging everywhere, their crystals tinkling and glittering. White candles are flickering in it, wax dripping down, forming beautiful creations. Shimmering crystal balls float everywhere, giving the room a dreamlike glow. Stunning marble pillars carry the roof. The walls are covered in black silk backdrops. Enormous mirrors hang where the windows probably are. In front of a wall is a tall, antique clock with 13 numbers on its dial. Harry smiles at the reference to the movie. The ebony parquet is shining, mirroring the lights. A hauntingly gorgeous tune fills the room. Harry recognizes the voice of David Bowie.
‘I’d forgotten how vocal you are.’ He pushes in deeper and deeper, and suddenly he’s at the right place. I see stars as his prick hits my prostate over and over again.
Well, looks like he’s wrong. Harry is just the same as all the others. Too kind, too compassionate now he knows he’s damaged goods to give him what he needs. Suddenly a strange, bitter feeling takes control of him.
‘Whatever.’ The crutch is rickety, but it’s holding up his weight. Carefully he starts stumbling out of the forest, but of course the crutch breaks. So much for fucking sturdy wood. He missteps and lands on his already swollen ankle. ‘Fuck’. Tears well up in his eyes, but he keeps on limping. He can do this without support.
This close to Harry, I can smell him. It’s a male smell, strong, musky and powerful. I hadn’t realized I missed it. After Harry I’ve never been with another man. It didn’t feel right. Then I met Astoria and all thoughts of Harry were shoved back. Oh, Astoria. If you could only see me now. Would you be proud I follow my heart, like you told me countless times?
‘We will resume our posts, sir.’ They walk away. Relieved, Draco slouches a bit, giving into the pleasure of Harry’s mouth. ‘And sir?’ Sybil looks back at him. ‘Please take that potion.’ He manages to nod. They exit his office, bickering about the case and closing the door. Just in time. Draco’s hands fly onder the table, grabbing Harry’s hair through the cloak. ‘Fuck...’ His eyes close with arousal, mouth open in a perfect ‘o’, jaw tight and a frown on his forehead. Harry intensifying the rhythm gets him off. Hard. He spurts a seemingly endless supply of come deep into Harry’s throat, letting out a low grunt as he does so.
I pass one particularly large tree, and I hear him breathing. I know he’s perfectly capable of controlling his breaths when on a job, so he must be doing this on purpose. Is it a trap? Carefully I look behind the tree. He’s waiting for me, just as I expected, his hands behind his back.
Harry rummages through the cabinets, finding ingredients everywhere. His names everything he finds and sings a song for them. ‘Pi-pa-penne will be muy bienne’. He feels silly, but Rose seems to enjoy it. ‘Pi-pa-peaches are so very sweetches.’ He starts cooking while Rose watches him. He hold some broccoli in front of his eyes and pulls them away. ‘Peekaboo!’
‘Good boy. All clean and quick about it. Let’s keep it that way. Want a chocolate bun?’ Draco picks one and eats it, his stomach growling from all the heavy labor his body has had to endure yesterday.
‘You keep surprising me, Saviour.’ The Count pulls out his cock again, looking at Harry with such lust, he feels himself go even redder. The Count lays down, leaning against the pillows. His hand moves over his cock slowly. He gestures Harry.
‘That is an excellent suggestion, love.’ Draco gently licks Just Harry’s hard-on. His eyes lock onto Just Harry’s. Falling out of character, Draco’s looks at him with a provocative glint in his eyes, while continuing to lick teasing stripes on Just Harry’s cock. He raises his eyebrow to challenge Harry. Who, of course, immediately takes the bait.
Bellatrix moves closer. ‘Something’s off this morning. I’d best alter your memories again.’ Bellatrix starts waving her wand. Harry jumps from behind the curtain, yelling a well aimed expelliarmus. Bella’s wand flies towards him, while Draco throws the curtain rod around her arms and waist and ties her up.
‘I think I’m getting scared, Lu. I’ve never done this. If I go out, it’s always with you guys. Never alone. Never trying to find... to find...’
‘Do you have doubts? Don’t worry, you’re in no way obliged to have intercourse with me. If my cock’s not to your liking, we’ll just head back to the party. Plenty more fish in the sea there.’ He tucks his cock back, his stance haughty and disinterested, but Harry’s trained auror eyes don’t miss the flicker of sadness and hurt in the Count’s eyes.
‘You can’t escape me, Mr. Potter. I’ll claim what’s mine.’ He hasn’t got much of a head start, so when I catch up, I tackle him down forcefully. We both topple to the ground, a tangle of limbs trying to hit overpower each other. I manage to get the upper hand and press him to the floor, his hands well above his head, my knee between his legs. His pupils are blown when I look at him. I kiss him, hard, and know I have to stop kissing him, or the whole play will be over in an instant with me apparating him into the bedroom to fuck him there. He seems to sense it too with his perceptive auror instincts, and bites my lip. Just hard enough to get back in the scene.
Carefully, he makes his way to the kitchen. Harry is standing at the stove, making toast and eggs. He turns around and lets his eyes roam over Draco. He feels his flush deepen. ‘Like what you see, Potter?’
‘Even more men die of gluttony, so with this food I’ll be long dead before the jealousy stands a change.’ Harry wiggles his eyebrows. Draco sniggers, as he starts grating the cheese. Harry makes his way over to Draco and tries to steal a strand of pasta from the bowl. Draco swats his hands away as he divides the pasta on two plates, grating extra cheese over it. He pours two Martini’s to go with it and floats the plates, over to the table. Both men dig in and eat silently for a while.
Dean shakes his head. ‘Well now, I’d best start tailoring the best suit ever. What’s the dresscode?’
As if Harry reads his thoughts, he asks: ‘Draco, you weren’t always this submissive. We used to have enormous power struggles. What happened? If, that is, you want to talk about it?’ The look of genuine interest and the lack of force makes Draco feel he can trust Harry. That, and the threat of plain sex, makes him decide.
Draco’s volume increases. ‘Do you freaking hear me, Harry? I got randy as a teenager by being fucking forced balls deep! Who in their right state of mind finds bloody pleasure in this deluded shite? I fucking hated myself for being this twisted, sick cunt. Who for fucks sake likes being fucking raped?!’ Draco realizes he’s shouting. He stills, shoulders slumping as he buries his face in his hands. Shame washes over him. He’s sure Harry doesn’t want anything to do with him, now he knows how sinful and fucked up he is.
‘You’re gorgeous.’ He hears Harry tell him. ‘Yes, he is, isn’t he? The most gorgeous thing I ever laid eyes on.’ What the?
‘I know, Draco, because if it would’ve been me, I would’ve created a scene that would shock the whole bloody Wizarding world. I definitely would’ve done some really fucked up things to get even with him, out of betrayal, anger and despair. Why didn’t you?’
He turns around and walks away. Not even looking over his shoulder. I break down. I’m crying like I’ve never cried before. Everything comes out all at once. Everything that was, all the could have been, all that’s lost. I pull my knees up and rest my head on my knees. I must let this uncontrollable grief out, or it’ll suffocate me.
If he looks deep inside his heart, he knows he isn’t. No, he must never tell him who he is. Let him remember their tension and the wonderful fuck they had. Even if that means he can never see him again. It’s for the best.
The table stays silent. Not knowing if he’s still there, he starts working again. His stomach flutters with anticipation. He feels his zip open and his cock being pulled out. He sucks in his breath and releases it shakily. What if someone enters?
‘You should’ve thought about calling me such a nasty name. I am not a liar. I think I should punish you for your foul mouth’.
Kudos and comments are much appreciated! Ideas are always welcome. Always wanted our boys to do somerhing? Now is your change!
I have to swallow a lump. I don’t want to lose him, but I don’t want him unhappy for the rest of his life. ‘Oh love, I guess it all just clicked into place. Your animosity against Malfoy. Your aversion to Scorp and Al’s friendship. The sadness after the war. I think deep down I’ve always known. Why do you think my fics came so easily? Question is, what are we going to do about this?’ I lower my hands. Tears are streaming down my cheeks too. I love this man. It’d break my heart if he should leave me.
He looks at me, his eyes a mixture of love, tenderness and merriness. But for the first time in years I also see the hurt. How could I have been so blind? Me, who has an emotion antenna that picks up all feelings around me, so much it sometimes leaves me depleted?
‘Fuck, I’m sorry.’ I promised Gin to let them play in private. I hope she’ll forgive me after breaking my vow. As I start walking out, Gin calls out.
Looking in the mirror, he kind of likes what he sees. He looks more confident than he feels. Glancing at the big, cherry wood clock in his living, he sees it’s almost time. Harry fastens his mask and waits for the pull of the portkey, his foot tapping nervously.
‘Fine, but you can keep calling me Mr. Malfoy.’ She is startled by my reply, but my eyes betray me. She smirks.
He presses in, slowly, his eyes never leaving mine. ‘You love this, don’t you?’ I bite my lip and nod.
Harry moans my name as he’s coming. I want to watch his semen soil the bed, but suddenly I feel my balls tighten and my cock stiffen. Am I...? I feel my release wash over me, as I come untouched. Ropes of white, hot mess spoof over my legs and stomach. I scream, but the ball muffles my sound. I’m panting and drooling when I hear Ginny walk over to me. She gently unclasps the gag and carefully removes it. ‘Your jaw will hurt for a few hours, maybe days.’ She tells me as she strokes it. ‘Don’t be worried about that.’
Draco starts thrusting his own cock, coming embarrassingly hard from the third stroke. Harry looks at him in appreciation. ‘You did so well, love. I’m proud of you.’ Harry cleans them both, windless and wordless.
I feel boneless. I love playing rough. With Ginny, I’m always careful not to hurt her too much. She is strong and can take pain too, but with Draco? We’re able hurt each other equally bad, overpower each other and hit each other without holding back.
He gently cups his cock through his underpants, feeling it swell at the prospect of a good wank. He pushes up his sweater, letting his other hand slide up to his nipple. He bites his lip. What would he like Jareth to do to him? He pinches his nipple as he pulls out his cock. Would he want Jareth to suck him off? Or... would Harry rather be fucked by him?
‘You were eyeing this piece, right? You can have it, if you’re a good boy. Open that devilish lush mouth of yours’ Harry orders. Draco feels his legs turn to jelly. Why do Harry’s confident orders arouse him this much?
Cautious to not wake Harry up, he slides out of bed and tiptoes to the door. The floorboards creak as he carefully distributes his weight on them. As silently as he can, he makes his way downstairs while buttoning his shirt.
When he wakes up, he hears Draco’s voice, screaming at the top of his lungs. ‘You fucking, murderous psychopath. Deranged maniac! I should kill you right here. Splatter your brain onto the floor.’
Harry rolls his eyes when she isn’t looking. ‘Of course, love. Now sit.’ When he returns with the tea, Hermione is vast asleep, snoring slightly. He gently covers her with one of Molly’s quilted plaids. Then he takes Rose back to the kitchen. ‘Let’s make ourselves useful while your mummy is being such a rude host, falling asleep on me.’ Rose giggles and reaches for his long curls. She is in a playful mood.
‘You’re not... not gloating?’ He says it like he expects me to burst into a fit of taunting laughter. Really, Potter. I thought after all these years we were way beyond that. Before I can get angry, I see I shimmer of hope fleet over his face. He quickly schools it, but his impulsive Gryffindor nature has already showed me what he feels.
Checking his reflection for the umpteenth time, Draco opens the third button of his snug fitting shirt. Deciding it is too much, to eager, he closes it again. He has been extra careful to keep his pants clean. Normally he feels over-confident in his slacks of sex, as Pansy named them. Going out in the tailored grey pantaloons meant an assured pull, a quick innuendo in the loo imminent. But now he wonders if they will be satisfactory enough.
‘For the first time it’s best to open your hole by spell. Is that okay?’ Harry tries to hide his disappointment and nods.
‘I’m open to almost every kinky, dirty, strange scenario you want to try, but I also like a good, vanilla snog every now and then. I draw the line at borderline verbal and physical humiliation, fisting, strangulation, Imperious, Cruciatus, using animals, piss and poop. I’m clean, got my yearly checkup last month and only had protected sex afterwards. My safeword is Umbridge. Questions?’
‘Oh love, so tight. I’m...’ I can hear from the desperate edge in Harry’s voice that he’s close. My hand flies over my cock, I’m so aroused it’s almost painful. Harry groans and moans as he fills her up, his back arching and his breathing coming in uneven pants. I shiver at the sight and come in long spurts over myself and the carpet. We’re all silent for a moment, trying to control our breathing.
Malfoy hits him hard with the grip of the gun. Harry feels his jaw crunching as a bolt of pain shoots through him. ‘Fuck you, Potter.’ Malfoy grabs his hair and pulls him towards his face. Malfoy breathes in his ear. ‘I could do anything to you right now. I’d better watch that mouth if I were you.’
‘So we thought up a little scene for you.’ Harry picks up the gag and ropes. My eyes widen. His eyes focus on mine. ‘Would you like to hear what it is?’
Draco grins. He will never think of dessert in the same way now. He spoons a copious amount of the ultimate chocolate pudding into his mouth. Sighing he enjoys the sinful rich chocolate flavor in his mouth. He licks his spoon clean. The next heap of the perfect pudding makes him moan loudly, just as a couple passes their table. He looks at them embarrassed. They look right at him, but there’s no reaction. It as if they can’t see him. What the?
The Count turns Harry around again and plays with Harry’s cock and balls. To Harry’s amazement it’s already half hard again. The Count grins. ‘Needy, are we?’
‘As an only child I’m not used to sharing much. I need you to help me when it gets difficult. To be short: I want to feel loved and needed and you’ll probably get some emotional crap and a raging dose of constant bickering from me, that I hope doesn’t scare you, Potters.’
‘Do you like this, dear prince?’ Draco looks up at him with that smug, challenging smile Harry knows only too well. Only to turn back into an innocently blushing Drapunzel the next moment.
Shaking his head with a soft smile, he sits on the recliner in his office and obediently eats his lunch. Not even Jones’ reprimand when he finds Draco sitting and eating instead of sweating on the report can touch his mood.
‘I’m sorry, I didn’t know it was yóur play night.’ I bitch, as I want to make a fuss, but then Slytherin nature kicks in and I realize Harry has to make it up to me big time. Besides, he looks like he’s having a blast with Gin. ‘I’ll leave soon, but I have to know. Which one of you was bound for the gag? So I can wank at that though, seeing as I am being deprived of my sexual encounter with Harry.’
‘Fuck’. Harry moans. It feels... not good, but better. Loads of better. Malfoy starts thrusting, deliberately, giving Harry time to adjust. Harry feels himself ease into the rhythm. Until all of a sudden his vision turns blurry. ‘Fuck, Malfoy, yes, oh gods, there, right there’.
Harry opens his eyes and raises an eyebrow at him. He points at his leaking cock. The Count laughs his wonderful laugh again. ‘Don’t get cheeky now.’ He pushes in a third finger unexpectedly, soliciting a loud moan from Harry.
Carefully he folds in the cream and eggs and some pasta cooking water, softly tossing as he creates a thick, creamy, sinful sauce that clings lightly to each strand of tagliatelle. He grinds some fresh pepper over it.
Downstairs, Harry is already sitting on a kitchen chair. Scrumptiously naked, confident and sexy. Draco wonders what he has in mind, as he sits at the table. Harry’s set it with a lovely mismatched set of porcelain, all colors of the rainbow. There are buns, chocolate and sticky ones, thick slices of crusty whole grain bread, juices, coffee and tea. The smell of a perfectly cooked mushroom omelette fills the kitchen.
Harry looks me in the eyes. His looks crestfallen. My heart breaks. ‘Harry, were you... are you in love with Malfoy?’ He averts his eyes. ‘You are, aren’t you?’ I ask in a soft voice. He gives the tiniest of nods. I don’t know what to say.
Well, this is the end! I woke up incredibly early (it’s now 6 in the morning as I’m posting) to write and post the last chapter. I really hope you liked it. Let me know if the ending was as you expected :).
He fills the basket with a bottle of red wine, a flask of homemade lemon-strawberry lemonade, ginger buns, a fruit cake, some more chocolate cookies and a few apples. Now only for the flowers. The fuckers only grow in the enchanted forest next to Molly’s cottage.
‘You do now? Trust me?’ Harry’s looks at him with a strangely conflicted expression. As if he doesn’t want to pressure him, but want nothing more than to hear he’s earned Draco’s trust.
‘I... I-‘ Draco stutters. Fuck. He hates this. He wants to tell Harry everything, but he lacks the courage. He is afraid Harry will think less of him. He feels tears welling up as he averts his head.
He looks at me predatory. ‘Oh, but that’s not what I had in mind at all.’ His eyes are glistening with darkness. Whatever he’s got in store? It’s going to be fucking amazing.
Boy Toy gets on his knees next to the still sitting Draco and takes Draco’s hand to guide it onto his cock. ‘I’ve never done this before’, Draco lets a tiny bit of panic seep through his voice.
Ron and Hermione are ever loyal at his side, even now. He knows they want to get a place of their own now ‘Mione is pregnant, but he also knows they don’t want to leave him alone. He feels guilty for being the reason they don’t start their family in a new home. But he doesn’t know how he would cope without them. They’re his purpose now.
‘Don’t ever think you can outrun me. You’re mine and I’m entitled to do with you as I please.’ Harry presses a violent kiss on his lips. Draco tries to kick him in the balls with his knee, but Harry deflects, looking furious. For a second Draco is scared. Harry notices instantaneously, his face softening.
‘Ever so easy to wind up, Draco’, he smirks as he swallows him whole. Draco lets out a rather undignified squeak. Withdrawing, Harry presses back his foreskin and starts licking the tip. His tongue teases the head, having special attention for the little slit in the center and the rough edges of the crown. His right hand is kneading Draco’s balls, while the other hand squeezes his buttock.
Harry looks at him surprised. ‘I believe you.’ And he does. He also feels drained. He should leave soon, or he’ll fall asleep sitting.
‘Well? Do you want to ride the elevator too? Or do you want to take the stairs? Disneyland is waiting for us, you know. And Ginny too. I bet she can’t wait to ride the real tower of terror.’ I’m already making my way to the stairs, when Draco pulls my arm.
Sighing, Harry puts on his long, crimson red velvet cloak. Harry loved it the moment he saw it in the shop window. It emits a sort of vintage gothic vibe, that makes Harry feel like he’s a 15th century mage. He buckles up the shiny, silver clasp on top. He steps into his dragon hide boots and grabs the basket. Not wanting to land in a tree, he apparates to the front of the forest where the wild anemones grow. Walking will do him some good, he thinks as he enters.
Draco sobs. ‘I was so afraid. I thought I lost you.’ Harry feels Draco’s arms wrap around him. ‘And I don’t want to loose you.’
Harry gets on his knees and closes his eyes, waiting for the inevitable. He puts his hands in his neck.
‘Let it go, love. Let me feel that tight, warm hole clench around my cock. You’re so good at this.’ Harry’s praise does it, and Draco comes and comes, his sperm creating long, hot spurts on the tablecloth. He feels Harry moaning with delight, before he passes out. When he recovers, he’s seated again, fully clothed. The desserts are in the middle of the table. No evidence left of their hot fuck.
‘Oh my. You want this, don’t you, stud? I can see it in your eyes.’ Sexy Arse tells him, as he pushes his cock further in Draco’s mouth.
‘Nope, I just offered them your services after I’m done with you.’ Harry looks earnest. So earnest, Draco feels a pang of doubt. He wouldn’t, would he?
Harry tries, and this time it works better. He loves the feeling of cock in his mouth. When he’s bobbed up and down a few times, he’s starting to feel more adventurous. He licks the edge of the crown. The Count groans. ‘Fuck, Po- Precious. You’re a natural.’ Harry resumes his exploring, licking and popping it in and out, smearing precome and spit all over his own face. He experiments with the rhythm, alternating between fast and agonizingly slow blows. He licks his balls, sucking them in, his hand coating the Count’s prick with his saliva. The Count’s sharp intake of breath emboldens him.
He opens the basket to uncover a luxurious lunch. A stasis-flask of perfect Orange Pekoe sits in the basket, next to a few thick slices of homemade bread, still slightly warm, a bowl of fresh strawberries and a bowl of Harry’s famous egg, humus and avocado salad. A package of assorted nuts and a small, rich, sinful dark chocolate bar are chucked in the side pockets. A note is on top.
‘But it isn’t fair if I’m not getting off, don’t you think? We’ll have to think of something else.’ Just Harry eyes him expectantly.
Harry gets up and casts a quick scourgify on the table, but not themselves. He whispers ‘Let’s get home, I’ll lick you clean.’
Sexy Arse takes Draco’s boxers and tugs them down. Draco breaks the kiss with Just Harry. ‘What are you doing? I don’t want- hmmm.’
I hear someone sobbing, hoarse from effort. It takes some time to realize it’s me. Somehow, the tears won’t stop flowing. Images of Draco and Ginny keep clouding my vision, war memories fusing with them. Sometimes my bloody cupboard seeps through too. I can’t control myself.
He feels the soft tingle of Harry’s magic wash over him, knowing he’s cleaned him. The heat has subsided, as Harry sends a cooling charm his way too. Damn, this man is just bloody flawless. When his panting subsides, he tucks his cock back in.
Harry moves the bowl and lies next to Draco on the bed. He snuggles against Draco and wraps his arms around him protectively. He sighs content, resting his head into the crook of Harry’s neck. ‘Sleep, love. You need it.’ He feels a soft kiss on his hair before he sinks into a deep, much needed sleep.
‘So I’ve been told on many occasions’ Harry tells him, as he takes him back in, inch by inch. ‘Fuck, Harry, are you...’. Harry grins around his cock, as he relaxes his mouth and lets him slide in even deeper. Adjusting for a moment, he swallows even further, until his nose is right up into Draco’s fine, blonde curls. Draco gasps at the way Harry’s tight throat feels. His cock twitches, making Harry choke.
‘Tell me, did you let him explain? Or did you fill in the bloody blanks and made up your own story?’
It feels like the floo calls we used to have the first year we were together, when Harry was studying and I played overseas. Both telling the other to disconnect, a game that could go on for half an hour. Ah, young love.
‘You are generous Draco, and wonderful, and Ginny, you are too. I want you to know I both love you. Each in a different way. I could never compare that love, so that’s my rule number one: no comparing. You’re both special to me, and I couldn’t choose, just as one can’t choose which child he likes best. I had to choose all those years ago, and see where that left us.’ I see them nodding.
The thought of Harry disciplining him does all things of things to his southern region. The opposite things senior auror Jones has in mind, he’s sure. He has to bite his lip to hold in a grin.
Draco sits up straighter, trying to focus on the aurors in front of him. ‘Please, tell me. I don’t know what it is, if you don’t tell me, I can’t help you.’ Harry licks the head of his cock and slides the tip of his tongue into his slit. Draco bites down a whimper.
Harry feels someone chucked a bucket of cold water over him, his heart freezing. What if something happened to Malfoy? After the war, they shared a long and tender kiss, just before Malfoy got taken to Azkaban. Thanks to the fair trials, he got free. But he never replied to Harry’s letters, leaving him wondering if Malfoy regretted what happened. If something has happened now, he’ll never know if he’s the only one that felt a spark.
‘Ouch! Careful, or I’ll spank you right where you’re still hurting from last night.’ The Count’s eyes cloud over with sudden desire.
We eat in silence. My margret de canarde is heavenly. I ordered for the both of us, as Harry almost ordered langue de boeuf. When I asked him if he always likes to eat beef tongue or if he’s feeling particularly adventurous tonight, he paled a bit. That’s why he’s eating a steaming bowl of Ratatouille now.
‘Look at you. Begging for it.’ Harry kneads Draco’s cock as he clashes his lips with Draco’s. The kiss is aggressive and forceful. Harry returns to pulling down Draco’s trousers. Too easy, Draco thinks, I have to resist. He spits at Harry’s face and looks at him with as much challenge he can muster.
He blushes. I’d forgotten how adorable it makes him look. I’d forgotten how he likes me to jibe at him. How it turned him on when I insulted him. I also remember how he craved the tenderness he was deprived of in his youth. How much love he needed and how much he has to give,
He resumes his ministrations, sliding his hand up and down around his cock. Unable to bite back, he starts moaning a little. He hears Harry’s breath hitch. He allows himself to look at Harry, who is eyeing him darkly, an appreciative smile tugging at his lips.
Harry closes his file and puts it on the desk, together with the tea. Effortless he pushes himself off the desk. Draco finds his attention drawn to Harry’s well built biceps. Slowly Harry closes the distance between them. ‘An incident, hmm? I don’t believe one word of it, auror Malfoy.’
He walks to the door and looks behind him one last time. ‘I might be naked in my house tonight, being a very naughty boy. Maybe someone needs to discipline me.’ His eyes flutter in false innocence.
As Harry bucks his hips up, Draco feels how far along he is. He shudders from the extra friction it causes. Harry grabs Draco’s arse and grinds his groin against Draco’s. Draco feels pleasure vibrate through his spine as he tilts his head back. Harry starts sucking his throat. ‘Oh gods, Draco. Gorgeous Draco, you’re going to be the death of me.’
‘Indian’, Gin and I tell him in unison, as we both know about the fluff in Harry’s ears. He walks down to order. I look at Gin.
‘Nothing, auror?’ She smiles seductively at me, as she gets on her knees. I lean down and tell her: ‘Love, I’m so aroused, if you suck me off now, I’ll come within seconds.’
Malfoy looks at him with a ferocious, but appreciative smile. His eyes rake over Harry’s body, drinking him in. Harry flushes even darker. He’s never felt this wanted in his life.
Harry circles him, hands behind his back. ‘What should I do with such insolence?’ He holds still in front of Draco and starts walking him backwards, until Draco is flush against the wall. Harry leans in. ‘I did disclose the consequences of wearing those trousers to work again, didn’t I?’
Harry’s jaw relaxes as he looks inquiring at Draco. Draco’s heart flops in his chest. Isn’t this what this is all about? His desire to be dominated? Draco knows his own submissive character. A treat that wasn’t always there.
‘I know you’re here.’ Harry’s voice has gotten closer. He can’t see him. The bloody bastard must’ve put on his invisibility cloak. Cheater.
He flings open his eyes, to see not one, but two Harry’s on the carpet as a third one enters through the door, wearing nothing but a lopsided grin.
I choke. ‘Please, tell me you don’t have plans to move?’ I selfishly hope it’s not overseas. He always was fond of fucking Paris.
‘My, my. If I didn’t know any better, I would think you’re scared.’ He grins a toothy grin. ‘Are you? Scared, that is, Potter?’
‘Maybe you’re just a little slut yourself? I see you getting off on chasing me. You filthy cocksucker. You should’ve called for backup when you had the change. Now it’s just you and me and my big cock, auror Malfoy.’ I have to keep from rolling my eyes at the cheesy line. He sniggers too.
I could still just make up an excuse. My mind is racing. Should I do this? I must’ve hurt him then. All of a sudden a much worse thought slips through my mind. What if it never was serious for him? What if he was glad I left him?
Harry stays deep in thought for a while. He knows she’s right. Ginny would hate to see him waste away. He crumples the letter and tosses it in the trash. He’s going.
‘The same as for you. I don’t like humiliation. Piss, poop. Unforgivables. Dungeons or being locked up in a cage. I want to when we re-enact, but not now. Not yet.’ Yes, that feels good. Harry knows what he wants and when both of them are ready, they’ll do it.
Draco fondles clumsily with Boy Toy’s prick. Boy Toy groans. Sexy Arse lubes Boy Toy’s cock and then his own, as he guides Draco’s other hand to his prick. Draco can’t hold back anymore and begins tossing them both off. The feeling of two velvety, smooth, swollen pricks in his hands makes him feel incredibly powerful. And incredibly aroused. So aroused, he’s on the brink of coming. Suddenly he feels something around his aching cock. Looking down he sees Just Harry has put a cock ring around his painfully swollen prick.
‘Draco. Dray. Draykins. Please show yourself. I’m not going to hurt you, love.’ Harry’s feigning a sweet voice. Next he will get threatening, Draco knows. But this time, he won’t get caught.
Once cleaned and dry, he picks out a pair of beautiful, soft dark chocolate colored stockings. He attaches them to a gorgeous, chocolate and pink lace girdle. Gently, he bunches one stocking down to the toe. He points his toe and slips his foot in. Carefully, he pulls the smooth fabric up to his thighs. He repeats it with the other leg, tracing the lustrous, glossy fabric with his hands. He fastens the girdle, admiring how tightly it fits. His cock is slightly trapped. He decides against wearing panties. Prince Harry must have swift access. The thought makes him grin.
