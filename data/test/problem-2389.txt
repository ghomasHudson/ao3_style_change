‘I don’t care what it is, as long as it gets off real soon. Or I’ll help you.’ Malfoy flexes his hands a bit. His nails extend and retract like a cat’s. Harry’s shaking fingers start to unbutton his robes and shirt. He toes off his shoes. He unbuttons his jeans and steps out of them, removing his socks on the go. He’s not wearing any undergarments. His cock is hard and standing tall. A bit of precome is glinstening at the top.
The Count winks. ‘Don’t worry. Your secret is safe with me.’ He closes the distance between them again. His hands move down to the swell of Harry’s arse. ‘Although I might also tell everyone here just who you are’. He breathes into Harry’s ear.
‘I just felt a slight push.’ He looks scrutinizingly at Draco.
‘No.’
‘It’s okay.’ His long, slender fingers strip me of my blouse. ‘Why, Harry, I didn’t know you had another round in you! You must be careful at your age!’
Draco nods, unable to produce sound. His lips tremble.
‘No.’
(See the end of the chapter for
What’s that? Fuck, he’s got a butt plug in. If my cock could get any harder, it would.
Harry gets up and sits next to him on the bed. ‘As much as I’m tempted by your offer, your body needs time to heal. I had a great time though. You were so strong, so in control. Telling me when to stop. I’m extremely proud of you.’ He presses a kiss on the corner of Draco’s lips.
Harry shuts my thoughts with an equal languid kiss, his hands touching my half flaccid prick, smearing my come all over me, before cleaning all of us with a wandless charm. Show off.
But no. They can’t do this. It will put Malfoy in jeopardy. He breaks out in sweat. He’s astonished to notice he feels something and that the feeling is strong. ‘Malfoy, I can’t ask this of you.’
I pack for the weekend. I’m not sure what I’ll be needing. The note said casual muggle attire, so I pack three suits, two pantaloons and even a tailormade jeans. When the packing is done, the waiting begins. I’m restless until Friday morning, needing more wanks than at Hogwarts.
I get up again and push myself flush against her, making sure she feels my strength. She likes it when I overpower her. I start searching her front section from behind. Her slender body that I know by heart, the soft pouch on her belly, the one that inevitably forms when you’ve had three kids. She hates it, but I love it as it holds the memory of her pregnancies. I take care to softly pet it, stroke it and knead it, fingers slipping in the hem of her skirt every now and then, touching bare skin. She leans into me, surrendering herself to me.
‘Yes, I believe you will.’ He strokes Harry’s cheek with the back of his hand before he turns around and walks away. ‘See you around, Harry!’
‘Will you go talk to him?’ Despite myself, I nod. I must be losing my mind.
‘Good morning. You startled me.’ Harry still feels his heart beating two times as fast in his chest. You would’ve thought years of auroring would’ve made him less of a scaredy cat.
‘I know. I picked you so that when my beauty diminishes, your eyesight is so bad you won’t notice it.’ He snorts, but then a serious look forms.
I look at him intensely. ‘If that’s what it takes, then yes.’ I tell him quietly.
It’s Harry whose voice returns first. ‘Fuck, that was amazing.’ He gives Ginny a languid kiss. ‘And you’, he gets up, ‘you were fucking amazing too,’
Harry snorts. ‘Yeah. Like that will go well. He’ll hex me into next week.’
Let down your hair,
‘Fuck, I’m sorry.’ I promised Gin to let them play in private. I hope she’ll forgive me after breaking my vow. As I start walking out, Gin calls out.
‘I would like that very much.’ I try not to sound too eager, but fail miserably. ‘Are you okay too, Harry?’
‘I think you should talk to Ginny first. Promise me. No secrets from her.’
Harry shakes his head. ‘Promise me you’ll think about it?’ His eyes search out mine again. ‘I will if you do too. Think about the consequences, love. Okay?’ I nod, but my decision has been made.
‘I feel for you, Ronniekins.’ They all know Hermione’s cooking. It’s... well, gruesome feels like a rather understated word for it. Her idea of healthy food is undercooking all things that should be tender, adding sea weed and algae powders and reducing any fats. It wouldn’t be a problem, if she didn’t burn half off the food she served. He smiles to himself as he imagines her in the kitchen, fighting the food, wanting to show it who’s boss. She’s his other best friend, but when he visits, he makes sure Ron is cooking or he offers to cook and brings his own food.
I freeze. I must’ve misheard. ‘I’m sorry?’
Harry smiles to himself. He’s really doing this. It makes him feel a bit giddy.
‘Nope. If you show me your bedroom now, I’ll have to cancel dinner reservations’ Harry tells him, as he hungrily eyes his butt. ‘Which would be a shame, as I’ve gotten us a spot at the Ramblas’.
Harry is already in their office, leaning on his desk with a paper cup of liquid golden coffee, whiffs of vanilla spreading from it. As he enters their workspace, he sees Harry’s emerald eyes travel down quickly. He hears Harry’s breath hitch in his throat. Confident, he steps it up a notch and drops his quill.
‘But, there’s wolfsbane!’
He knows pork chops are Ron’s favorite, and Hermione loves asparagus. He hopes they’ll have some time for each other at Valentine’s Day, and likes to think the food will help.
‘Then you also must understand I really cannot be found with anything on me.’
They break the kiss, panting. Harry leans his forehead against Draco’s. Too tender, Draco thinks. Need more overpowering. He stomps his foot down on Harry’s. Harry swears and hits Draco again. A trickle of blood slides down his chin. Draco closes his eyes in pleasure.
‘It’s not fair!’ He yells together with Sarah and laughs. If anyone could see him now. His tough Saviour image would crumble instantly.
‘Draco, I...’ he looks at Draco to see he doesn’t need to tell him that his sight is coming back. Draco kisses him intensely.
Draco obediently opens his mouth, forming a perfect and soft looking ‘o’. Harry feeds his cock to him. Draco sucks him in, his tongue swirling around the head and ridge of his cock. Harry gasps. This isn’t the mouth of an inexperienced virgin.
‘Fuck, Potter.’ Malfoy watches the door long after Harry has left, a goofy smile on his lips. He nods to himself. Yes. Definitely worth the wait.
Draco’s brain is unable to process what’s happening. Harrys weight is crushing him into the wall. He feels his cock stirring.
‘Don’t sound so hopeful, Draco dear.’ Draco laughs through his tears. He rests his head on top of Harry’s and tenderly strokes his hair. Harry feels Draco’s tears splutter on his face. It’s a strange feeling. They feel warm and sparkly.
‘Safe signals?’
‘Oh my, Potter.’ A chuckle sounds. ‘That won’t help you here’. The sounds comes from the other side of the clearing. Harry spins around again with dizzying speed. A hooded, cloaked figure is standing there, leaning against a tree. The hood and the angle of his head obscures Harry’s view of the strangers face.
Harry wakens by the sound of an owl knocking on his window. Quickly he lets him in, giving him a small treat. The owl hoots in appreciation and drops his parcel, before flying out again.
He watches himself in front of the mirror. Dean has done a great job. He looks sexier than he has in a long time, albeit the kind of sexiness from a nineties vampire movie. His hands slide over his thighs, loving the way the soft fabric feels. He lets his hand rest on the outline of his cock for a moment, feeling it twitch under his hand.
Funny how I think of the Potters house as home, I contemplate when I arrive there after a long day at work. I hope Gin and Har are still expecting me, because I normally don’t come here when it gets this late at the office. I just really missed the both of them.
‘Always the martyr, eh, Potter?’ He hears a soft chuckle and the sound of the safety latch returning in its place. Malfoy lowers the gun.
I moan. ‘You might want to slow a bit, or I’ll be coming all over you in a second.’ I look at him, seeing my own arousal mirrored.
‘It’s a cloak.’ Harry unclamps his cloak and shrugs it on the ground.
‘I’m sorry.’
‘Smug tosser!’ Draco yells. Harry pops his head back in. ‘You might want to watch that foul mouth of yours, auror Malfoy.’ Lowering his voice, he adds for Draco’s ears only: ‘Or I’ll be ripping those pants off to fuck you right through dessert, for the whole restaurant to see.’ Draco swallows hard. Tonight looks promising. He’d best start googling if treacle tart stains come off easily.
Yep. That does it. Harry’s cock is filling at dizzying speed. Harry pats the bed again. ‘Dearest Drapunzel, would you come over to the bed so I can fuck you into the mattress. Pretty please?’
Harry feels his own arousal building up. Wanting to feel Draco’s walls contract around his cock, his long, strong fingers bring Draco over the edge first. Draco wails sinful words as he comes, spurting all over Harry. His hole squeezes around Harry’s hardness, making him come hard and milking every last drop from him. Harry moans as he fills up Draco’s arse.
Harry nods. ‘Fuck. You have no idea what you do to me, Precious Saviour. Lay back.’ Harry does, quite nervously. The Count pulls off his trousers and pants, eyes roaming Harry’s now naked body hungrily. ‘Such a sight.’ He props Harry’s legs up, for better access.
He wants to get up, but Harry grabs his wrist. ‘Don’t. I’m not done yet.’ Harry’s voice has darkened and has a raw edge to it. His eyes are blazing.
‘Very well, sir.’ The waiter nods and retreats. Harry puts the plates on the sides. ‘Bend over.’ Harry’s order jolts through him with a rush of adrenaline. He’s really doing this.
Draco looks grateful at Harry. He thinks he can trust him, but he’s just not ready yet. His legs start swaying, but Harry’s strong arms catch him. Exhausted, Draco lets Harry lead him to bed. He feels Harry’s magic cleaning him up, transfiguring his shirt into a comfy tee as he covers him up in blissfully soft blankets, stroking his hair gently. ‘You did so well, love. Now sleep tight.’ Harry presses a soft kiss on his forehead. Draco feels more than he sees Harry give him a sweet smile as he drifts to sleep. The sleep is long, heavenly and for once the nightmares are absent.
‘It’s Bella.’
‘I’ve been living as a wolf for such a long time, I had forgotten how it feels to be human.’ He puts down Harry and hands him his stuff and the basket.
‘For fucks sake, just fuck me. Fucking please!’
‘Mad? You just gave me the fuck of a lifetime. And now I really have to go. Sorry.’
‘You’re right, love. We promised. No fucking. But after all this caressing I did, don’t you think I deserve a little reward? I don’t ask for much. Just the tip. Okay, love? Just the tip. I won’t push it in any further than you want.’ Just Harry presses the tip against Draco’s arsecheeks.
‘Want some help finding it?’ Harry asks, as his fingers brush ever so lightly over Draco’s buttocks. The gentle, but rather arousing gesture makes Draco’s blood rush down south. Which is rather unfortunate. He is wearing his trousers of sex, after all. Trousers that aren’t only tight fitted on the backside.
‘But what if he doesn’t show?’
Harry looks away. He is silent for a moment. ‘Okay. After Voldemort I made certain never to let anyone rule me again. Him and Dumbledore, and also my obnoxious uncle and aunt before them, tried to control me. They tried to make me do what they wanted, turn me into someone I’m not, and it really pissed me off.’ Harry’s eyes are venomous as they fix on a faraway point in space, his jaw clenching hard.
He shakes his head, realization dawning. ‘When?’ He asks breathless.
‘Ah, you’re British. We’re Canadian. It’s nice to speak some English. Is he afraid of elevators?’ The woman asks.
‘Come for me, pet. Scream for me.’ He pants. I feel his cock stiffening and know how close he is. My hand flies over my cock. Draco’s perfect prick hits my prostate once more and I come, spilling all over my hand, stomach and Draco’s stomach. I scream his name while I do it, eliciting a loud moan from him. His thrusting becomes erratic and suddenly he stills and shudders. He moans as he comes, buried deep in my arse.
Did Harry just call this place home? Or is he hearing things? Why would he want Draco in his house? He must want to fuck him. Just have him available as a plaything whenever he wants to get off. He wants to use him, he’s sure. Or...
‘Careful with the hot water and Rose.’
He closes his eyes. What is he going to do? If he kisses the Count, he’ll know. Know what kissing a wizard is like. But does he dare? It’s been so long since he kissed, especially a stranger. What if he’s disappointing to the experienced Count? He can hear Ginny’s voice again. ‘Only one way to find out. Go for it, Tiger!’
Malfoy summons his lube. It’s a big, half empty jar that’s seen better days. ‘Damn, they haven’t made this fucking brand in years. Nobody wanted to fuck the Saviour? Bent him over this lovely fucking sofa? And I used to think you had it all.’
Auror training kicking in directly, he pulls out his wand.
Harry looks at him, anger immediately replaced by empathy and genuine concern. ‘It will help to talk, love. But I respect you if you stop. It’s your call, you’re in control. No pressure. Okay?’ He gently tucks a stray piece of Draco’s hair behind his ear, his thumb stroking his chin. Draco swallows again. ‘The...’ his voice comes out thin and croaky, and he clears his throat. Harry puts his hand on his back. Finding his voice again, Draco resumes.
Draco finds it inexplicably comforting to realize he does trust Harry.
His mind races. What does she mean? That Draco feels something for him? ‘Give me fifteen minutes, Mr. Malfoy. I’ll come over.’
She looks at him with so much devotion, for a moment I’m taken aback. I know I once felt the same. It needs to resurface a bit more, but I know I’m almost there. I decide I mustn’t be jealous. He didn’t chose me then, but he does choose me now. And her. It’s funny how compatible we are. I start to develop a deep liking for this auburn haired, witty woman with her heart on her sleeve.
Harry’s thumbs slide behind the waistband of Draco’s boxers as he deliberately and slowly pushes them down. His leaking cock springs out. In one swift movement, Harry’s on his knees. Draco feels the magic of a wandless protection spell crackling over his hard prick. Keeping eye contact Harry asks: ‘Do you want this?’
‘Had a good rest?’
‘Ginny, why are you really here?’
Distraught, Draco all but runs outside. Only to be stopped dead in his tracks by Harry catching his wrist. Harry leans in and whispers in a low voice ‘if you ever wear these again to work, I’ll be taking them off. Just so you know’. His gaze fixates on Draco’s. Are his emerald eyes challenging him? He lets go of Draco and walks away, leaving a perplexed Draco behind.
‘We do have to set rules, though. I know you care deeply for Ginny too.’
He resumes his ministrations, sliding his hand up and down around his cock. Unable to bite back, he starts moaning a little. He hears Harry’s breath hitch. He allows himself to look at Harry, who is eyeing him darkly, an appreciative smile tugging at his lips.
Harry eyes open and a wicked grin forms at his lips. ‘Took you long enough.’
I see Gin rolling her eyes, as Draco tells me: ‘Saviour of the Wizarding World, but Daft when it comes to Domestics. What on earth will we do with him?’
Harry’s forces his way in Draco’s mouth, plundering it with his tongue. Their tongues are teasing, chasing after each other like it’s a bloody quidditch game. Draco starts moving in Harry’s lap, grinding their erections against each other. Harry moans. ‘I like that, love. You’re so hot’, he murmurs between kisses. Draco grabs his neck for more leverage.
Harry looks me in the eyes. His looks crestfallen. My heart breaks. ‘Harry, were you... are you in love with Malfoy?’ He averts his eyes. ‘You are, aren’t you?’ I ask in a soft voice. He gives the tiniest of nods. I don’t know what to say.
‘What will I do with you?’ Harry holds both his hands above his head, using only one of his own. Draco struggles to get free, but Harry is too strong. His other hand reaches down and pulls down Draco’s trousers. Deciding it’s too slow, he hauls Draco up and binds Draco’s hands to a nearby tree with a wordless spell. Unable to move his hands, Draco kicks at Harry. Harry glares at him as he catches his leg. His thumb lingers over the sore spot on his ankle. Looking Draco in the eye, he forcefully presses it. Draco groans, his eyes rolling backwards. Harry drops his leg.
When he gets out from the shower, he finds Harry sitting on the ridge of the bath, towel in hands. ‘You are so freaking gorgeous. Want me to rub you dry?’
She rolls her eyes. ‘Har, I know. Please get on with it.’
‘We need tot talk.’
‘When I broke up with Gin, I found I wasn’t only attracted to women. As I had my share of quick fucks, I discovered my own rather dominant nature. It felt good to be in control after so many years of following orders. I swore I never would put anyone in this dependent position I was in though, not without proper means of escape. So there it is. I like domineering, but I never, ever want to hurt anyone the way I was hurt. It’s why I find safe words and signals of the utmost importance.’
‘Don’t worry, love. You’re doing great. Giving us all such pleasure.’ Harry starts fucking Draco’s mouth in long, languid movements. He tosses his head backwards and moans.
‘I see you agree with me it isn’t fair my cock is being neglected. I think you should use another part to give me pleasure too.’
Tomorrow. The talk has to wait until tomorrow, he thinks as he feels himself slipping into a deep sleep.
‘We are going to tie you up to this chair, stark naked. If you want to, we’ll gag you too. Then Ginny is going to fuck me.’
“Good morning, precious boy.” She greeted him, her voice sickly sweet. “How did you sleep?”
He was trying to times that by 5 pounds in his head, and it was
“Are you kidding?” Ron spoke up, having swallowed enough of the food stuffed in his mouth to leave space for words. “It’s amazing! I’ll go with you.”
At any rate, Fred seemed to love the Lego. Mr Weasley certainly was showing a lot of interest, and when Hal said he and his cousin had loads of those, his eyes were positively sparkling with enthusiasm.
“I thought you’d reached that conclusion yourself already.” Draco said drily.
At least there would be something to look forward to.
“Did not, actually.” Hal smiled. “Well, a bit. But it looks like Draco got through to him, at least to some extent. I got off easy.”
everything had been coming nearer and nearer and the next moment, the troll emerged at the end of the hall. The three of them froze, eyes fixed on the beast blocking out almost the entire height and width of the corridor, a large club its hand.
of course but holding wizarding supremacy ideals strong and therefore considered more worthy of the honour than families like the Weasleys or Ollivanders.
“I guess that’s a fair assumption.” Hal nodded slowly. “But… I’m not sure it would be, sir.”
With that, Hal was dismissed, and the usher saw him out again. The lady from the witness suite had brought Draco up, they exchanged a smile as the two staff swapped them over, and he went back down with her as Draco went into the courtroom.
and lacking well, magic, in the Muggle world. But Hermione just shook her head and assured him it was perfect, and not everything needed fireworks. She’d seen her cousins, as well as her friends from primary school, and she’d had a great time.
, he knew, thank you) “…is still rooted within you, protecting you from the same evil it was intended against. That is why Quirrell, hosting Voldemort’s soul, could not touch you. That is why you will always be safe under your aunt’s roof.”
“It’s nice to meet you too, Mrs Weasley.” Hal beamed at her – her smile was warm and contagious.
leather satchel that had a permanent feather-light charm integrated to it, unlike Hal’s current book bag, which he had to charm every time he wanted to spare his back, sometimes with limited success. His shrinking spells were a tad more successful, but somehow did not remove the weight, which was a little inconvenient when going for unfettered. Ron complained that it was definitely out of the budget they had set, but Draco argued they hadn’t actually set a budget this year, they’d only agreed to not be outrageous.
“The whole school is talking about us. Well. Mostly you.”
actually writing the essay for them. It’s set me back.”
He was reminded of Colin. Did families like his, like this one in front of them, really only exist thanks to him? He hoped not. He hoped, if he hadn’t destroyed Voldemort in a fluke, that people like his parents and the resistance they were part of would have fought him back and won.
“No, nobody knows.” Hal insisted. “Which is exactly why we need the Map. The teachers out there might be looking for the wolf, but he’ll be
Hal’s aunt appeared smiling at the door, carrying a plate of chocolate biscuits and a cup of tea. Hal traded his empty bowl of chilli for them, eager to indulge.
“They’re just waffles.” Hal had replied distractedly, already looking at the rest. “So the trial starts at 11, but Draco and I will need to be there at 10-”
, but if you were… maybe somehow, when he tried to kill you, his magic recognised his kin and… refused?”
“Oh.” Hagrid looked at him like he’d never seen him before. “Okay.”
“Wow.” He shook his head. “Guess that went well.”
“Are you speaking to many students?” Hal asked.
“What are you doing?” Draco panicked.
“You as well?” He moaned.
After a week or so, they had all gotten past the excitement of knowing there was a massive three-headed dog on the third floor of their school, as every teacher seemed to be intent to pile on as much homework as possible before Halloween.
“A little sister.” He said quietly.
Pansy scoffed. “‘Cause we’re friends?”
“I don’t know what that means.”
“Would you like to know why Professor Quirrell couldn’t touch you?” He probed.
“Hm?”
Anthony stared at him for a second before he remembered, from Dumbledore’s start of year speech, what he was on about, and burst out laughing. Hal followed suit, and they spent a couple of minutes in hysterics, releasing the shock of what had just happened.
He straightened again, having made his point, and turned a cordial smile to the rest of the Slytherins around the table. Most of their mouths were hanging open in stunned silence, except maybe Blaise and Pan who were pursing their lips to contain their glee.
Draco had been doing his best to avoid groups of Slytherins around the school, whether these contained Flint and his mates or not, in the faint hope they would forget about him if they couldn’t see him. Unfortunately, they obviously didn’t, and rather seemed to be seeking him out.
“How’s your godfather?” She changed the subject, and he felt relief.
“Student missing!” He bellowed. “There is a student missing!”
“Yeah.” Hal said quickly, his voice a little airy. “Oh, we’re here.”
“Well.” Hermione flushed, but she looked pleased. “I do have a friend Emily. And actually, I think I raised a valid point. I do wonder...”
“Dropped your prejudices long enough to notice Draco’s worth even though he’s not in your House?”
Had the big oaf stopped to
“No siblings then?” He asked.
“I think we have lost our Seeker.” Fred astutely noted.
– but there was no proof Flint had ordered the hit, so to speak, and Bole had already lost his House fifty points and would be serving a month of detention. And they had, reluctantly on Draco’s part, mentioned the bullying, but there as well, apparently, revenge wasn’t the answer and Hal shouldn’t have taken it upon himself to go settle the score.
“She seems nice.” Hermione said defensively. “Don’t join the ranks of the ones that bully and make fun of her just because she’s a little odd.”
“Right.” Ron cleared his throat. “No. Of course. You’re right. Sorry, big family, I’m used to the squabbling.”
Heavens knew where Dudley got it from.
“I don’t like it, personally.” Draco sniffed.
“It really wasn’t that much of a leap.” Hal rolled his eyes.
“I’m sure he’s been raised to think a very specific way about it.” Hermione construed. “Maybe it’s weird for him to discuss it so casually.”
“I know.” He repeated.
Before Anthony could get a word out – the implied expectation from the other boys being that it would be his responsibility to lie to his cousin, since they’d decided together not to tell anyone else about the dog – Hermione started chattering.
“HARRY!” A shout called his attention. “GO FOR IT!”
Draco had wasted no time going back through the door with the broom as the others carried on forward. He found Neville still casting
When Hal didn’t say anything else, he tentatively started. “Hal, are you-”
“You gave me the wrong one!” One of the women cried.
“It’s getting dark, we should get going.” He concluded, apparently pleased with his handiwork. “Hagrid, think of what’s best for… Norbert.”
“Ah, Mister Potter! I knew this day would come.”
“Come, I’ll show you around.”
“What are you calling him?”
“Look at me when I speak to you, you filthy blood traitor.”
dangerous situations.” He amended.
“I’m a boy.” Pan said for a third time. “I hope you can accept that. I will be starting my transition this year under the supervision of Hogwarts’ Potions Master.”
“I guess not.” Hal mumbled.
“Hal.” Hal could hear Ron answer. “It’s his nickname.”
Hal came back and hopped casually on his bed, heaving himself up to sit cross-legged facing Draco.
“Really.” Hermione had kept talking. “Well, obviously it’s not always the case in everyone, some witches and wizards stay small, and the usual genetics still apply, but it seems like in the same way a lack of food, light and love can stunt a child’s growth, so can a lack of magic. Well, use of magic, if you have it. I’m guessing that is what is happening to Hal. He’s thriving now he’s started practicing. I wouldn’t be surprised if he grew into a very powerful wizard.”
“I agree.” Hal said, though he didn’t particularly rate the man. But he was the headmaster, and this could hardly get more important.
“No.” Draco sighed. “It’s always been just me and my mother. Well. And father, until he died.”
“Myrtle!” He spun around, facing the ghost, suspecting his face was just about the same hue as hers at this point. “Get someone – Dumbledore, anyone.”
While he’d have happily stayed there for a while longer, Hal solid and safe in his arms (he still saw him dead in his nightmares every other night, he would not apologise for seeking the reassurance), he collected himself and let him go so he could greet their other guests.
Hal talked about his aunt and Ley, about his friends at school, and to a mix of horror, delight and pride from Sirius, about facing off Voldemort in his various manifestations. Sirius talked about his own time at Hogwarts – Hermione was right, it was mostly mischief – and carefully did not talk about his time in Azkaban. They both skirted around the topic of whether or not Remus (with how much Sirius used his first name, Hal had started thinking of his professor as such, much inconveniently) was an Animagus or a werewolf or neither.
“Hey, what can I do.” Ley shrugged cheekily. “Girls want me.”
“Is that meant to be a compliment?” Draco asked coldly.
about it?”
“I have to go.” Sirius sounded sorry for that. “Kingsley came by to let me know and he’s given me a few minutes to call you, but he needs to bring me in.”
“He told me.” Pan said. “Well. I guessed, then he admitted it.”
Hal took her hand, because he didn’t have to say he felt the same, for her to know it. He did, and it pained him a little, too, that Ley and his aunt would always be slightly on the sidelines of this new world of his. He wouldn’t give up Hogwarts, his friends there, magic, the memory of his parents, for anything in the world – but a part of him resented to have to leave them behind for this.
“Yes, mother.”
“I don’t know.” Anthony shrugged. “I think I decided that years ago, and, I don’t know, I just stuck with it.”
“Okay.” He thought he heard, before he was asleep again.
before they each ran towards their respective parents.
“I am afraid poor Quirinus was always going to end up this way.” Dumbledore exposed. “Hosting Voldemort’s soul in such a manner was destroying him from the inside. Harry was merely the… catalyst, for his final combustion. It seems Lily’s protection is still holding strong in him.”
“It doesn’t mean-” Hermione started again.
“This is very advanced magic and it was made by teenagers.” George carried on. “We accepted that there might be a few errors.”
He had a determined look on his face, mirrored on Ley’s. Draco felt a pang of something almost like jealousy, or longing, for that closeness between them, the purity of that unwavering support between brothers. He was glad Hal had that – part of him just wished he had it too.
Draco noticed he’d paled considerably.
There were quite a few other Hogwarts students Draco recognised, and very few who weren’t Slytherins. In fact, Draco did not spot a single Ravenclaw – though maybe some of the young adults who had recently finished school had been in that House. There were a few of kids he thought he’d seen in yellow, and a scattering of Gryffindors, though the rest of their family had to otherwise be strongly vocal about Pureblood ideals for them to be welcome here.
Hal’s eyes snapped back up to his friend’s face. “Wait, they know about that too? I mean- I didn’t even-” He took a breath. “Do
“I had to learn it.” Pan answered. “My father was of the belief that politics for women was knowing all the connections and knowing when and how to play them. As opposed to a more power-driven approach for men. Sword versus poison and all that, figuratively.” He shrugged again. “But actually, I found that I quite like genealogy.”
“Sorry.” He told him when they reached each other. “That was a really boring game.”
“Don’t rise to it, darling.” She told him. “You know he’s only acting like this because he’s frustrated you can’t show him.”
“You are
Feeling cheerful for the first time since the holidays had started, he grabbed a quill.
Hal spotted the Snitch a first time, but quickly calculated that they were still down too many points to win if he caught it, so he promptly zoomed to the opposite side of the field, satisfied when the Ravenclaw Seeker – who either didn’t count points, or didn’t think Hal did – followed him.
“That hair.” Hal's aunt whispered with a little laugh, though it was one tainted with sadness. “It was always so beautiful. I was rather jealous of it.”
And finally getting a good look at Hal. He seemed a little taller again, already, and his skin had taken a soft caramel colour that did unspeakable things to Draco’s imagination. He turned away again, hoping they couldn’t see him blush, and gestured towards the Manor.
“No.” Hal tried to sound convincing. “Thank you, Sir.” He added, hoping he appeared polite and not like a hypocrite, because he rather felt like saying
“Hermione?”
“It’s going to kill!” He answered frantically as Hermione told him to slow down and what the hell had gotten into him. “It’s-”
his smile.
For a second, Draco almost wanted to cry at the fierce frown on his friend’s face. Nobody had ever felt vindicated on his behalf.
The Floo, Hal guessed, remembering having read or heard something about that.
“You just need the proper motivation.” Pan insisted.
“Good talk.” Hal interrupted with a grin. “Let’s have it again when I’m a professional Quidditch player and you’re a professional nutritionist.”
“Yeah, that’s what I thought.” Ron said. “Shall we go?”
“To be fair, it probably wouldn’t have been great to have that in the classroom either.” Hal gave him a tight smile.
“Telling us, trusting us.” He shrugged. “And it does put things into perspective, doesn’t it. Hal speaks to snakes. You’re a bloke in a girl’s body. Meh.” He made a balancing movement with his hands, as if these were comparable.
She looked at him for a minute, and then spoke carefully.
“Just like it’s impossible to break into Gringotts?” Hal pointed out drily.
Hal, meanwhile, had another idea. He saw how pale Draco had gotten as he fully realised that his godfather was currently roaming the corridors for a werewolf, and as much as the man wasn’t Hal's favourite person, as much as he risked getting one of his most prized possessions confiscated...
“Darling.” His mother smiled back. “It’ll be perfect for the garden party at Greengrass House.”
“This is so cool.” He admired.
“Care to explain?” Dumbledore added coldly.
The room was horrifying. It was covered, from floor to ceiling, with pictures of him, articles about him, scribbles of his name surrounded by hearts, drawings of his face (not very good ones either), and items associated to him: a Gryffindor scarf, pairs of glasses on the shelves, Quidditch memorabilia, books, newspapers and magazines in which Hal was pretty sure he or his parents would be mentioned.
He went on explaining they were less likely to be encountered in public places, though he had heard of Boggart interventions in train stations and even a Muggle night-club once, so he believed any person was as likely as the next of meeting one at some point in their life. After showing them the incantation and explaining the process of defeating the Boggart through laughter, they formed a line, ready to go one at a time.
(another spell he’d mastered like it wasn’t something you learnt in 6th year and that wizards only tended to really start using once they were overage and had to leave the nest) and the fire looked under control. A corner of the roof and connecting wall had caved in, but the house seemed to be otherwise standing, though significantly singed in a few places.
, the words disappeared into the page. A moment later, new ones appeared.
“Hey, it’s fine.” Hal offered. “I was looking too.”
Hal shrugged, unwilling to get into it, and used the excuse of being distracted by Lupin opening the wardrobe where the Boggart was held and the practical class starting in earnest.
“Oh my god.” He chuckled.
“Briefly. I will accompany you.”
“Bring him back.” Hal said fiercely.
Yes, I’m leaving this here! It’s not magic. Give Hal some time.
Hal knew it was something adults said, although he had noticed he’d grown a fair bit in the past few months – his jeans felt a bit short on the ankles. Hermione had also mentioned something about being connected to his magical core, but he’d stopped listening in favour of watching Ron try to teach his rat a trick, unsuccessfully for about the 10th time.
“We have to trust him to make his own mistakes.” Hermione told him supportively, visibly sharing his opinion though they both kept quiet about it.
“Ow.” He croaked.
“So I made it worse, yeah, thank you.” Draco interrupted, his voice cracking.
“Keep him away from Scabbers.” Ron eyed him suspiciously. “He’s lame enough without risking to die of a heart attack or something.”
“Both of them?” Draco finally managed to ask.
. Surely your Headmaster cannot believe this man to have actually tried to harm you, or anyone, in any way, and still let him carry on.”
With reluctance and a lot of complaints Ron pretended he couldn’t hear, Hal let himself be dragged into his Quidditch kit and out into the cold, but once there were up in the air, he had to admit it had been a great idea, and he felt the tension of the past few days lift off his shoulders as they flew around, passing a ball back and forth between them.
“Okay, so let’s go check.” Hal replied, undeterred. “Then we can decide who goes after him and who goes to get teachers.”
“I do commend Miss Granger’s and your reasoning.” The headmaster assented thoughtfully.
“We were right to have a bad feeling about that thing.” Anthony commented.
“Oh, they do.” Hal scoffed bitterly. “There’s that stupid prophecy, people have been thanking me for a decade for saving them, while all I did was have parents who died for me. So of course they expect something of me now I’m older – and before you say anything, I know, I’ve not made it any better by getting myself in a situation where I’ve faced Voldemort again twice, though I could argue that’s also not really my fault. And did you notice how Dumbledore was again conveniently away? Sends me a bird and a fucking sword? He’s
“Darling…”
When they ended up in the ice cream parlour, having collected everything they needed, Hal managed to hide himself in a corner, leaving Ley to chat and laugh with the twins. Draco sat next to him, and once they had fallen onto the first few mouthfuls of their sundaes as if they hadn’t seen food in a week, they paused to breathe and talk.
He’d also bought a nice leather pouch for his coins, a book about household magic to catch himself up on commonplace spells he thought wizard-born kids his age would know, another about wizarding history, a tin of Sleekeazy potion – because why not, if his grandfather had invented it then surely it would be good for their stubborn family hair, even though he felt a little weird thinking some of the money he paid could come back to him.
She sighed. “On a foot.” She gave him a considering look. “I always end up telling you things when you care like this. Maybe that’s why people think we are siblings sometimes.”
“Sadly.” Draco agreed. “I have absolutely no faith he’s not going to get into some sort of trouble again at some point.”
“Yeah, so, all good with me.” He said. “We were just heading back home, so… Nice seeing you.”
“Yes.” She said fervently. “I should speak to McGonagall.”
“Oh, I have a rule.” Anthony said casually. “I’m not dating till fourth year.”
Hal beamed, exhilarated at the thought of flying with Draco, albeit on opposite teams.
It was Hal who broke the silence.
“I didn’t go looking for trouble.” He felt the need to say. “I just… Draco was being so weird and clearly something was wrong and I wanted- I needed to make sure he was safe.”
“Unless you have the wrong culprit again, of course.” Hal noted, seemingly innocently.
“I don’t think she would have checked them out, she was only there, what, twenty minutes?” Draco pointed out. “And she didn’t have books on her after the game.”
He took the broom off Hal’s hands, who gave his arm a squeeze.
“You’re not in trouble right now, Miss Granger.” Severus told her to shut her up.
the stone could obtain it. Only someone who wanted it, not for their own selfish use, could.”
“I think I’m alright.” Hal shook his head.
stay rich and safe. Sometimes both. People just suck, Hal. Don’t worry about it.”
“Thank you.” He looked up to them. “This is… this is really kind of you.”
“Thank you.” He said solemnly. “I gratefully accept your invitation.”
“Fawn, I wanted to say…” Sirius started when they were alone.
“Admittedly, that would have been the most likely match when we were both younger.” Draco recognised when Pan only shrugged.
2.	They’re not obsessed with finding out about the stone. The circumstances and their group of friends being different, I felt like they’d be more oblivious about what could possibly be unfolding - threats and evil plots further from their minds than they are in the books originally.
Blaise was a bit more of a free spirit, on account on his family not being an old House – in fact, his family history seemed a bit hazy. They had come to Britain a few generations ago from the United States, another a few generations after immigrating there from Italy… something like that anyway.
“There you are! You missed the whole game, it’s over already, Hal caught the Snitch in under fifteen minutes! It’s not a record in professional Quidditch, but I think it may be in Hogwarts history. Even Anthony can’t manage to be mad at him for losing us the Cup.”
“Everyone move aside.” Mrs Pomfrey intervened before Hal could answer.
“That woman is a menace.” Blaise grunted.
“Are you serious?” Draco breathed out, his mind boggling.
“You’re
“What was yours?” He asked.
“Is he any good with hair-cutting spells?” Pan asked, fingers finding the tips of his straight black hair, somewhere just above his shoulder.
“I’m safe at school.” Hal argued.
“As good as, then.” The other woman laughed. “I have twin girls. I know it can be a handful.”
“Knacks like... music?” Hal tried (and probably failed) to sound like the example had just occurred to him.
Draco gave him a distressed, disbelieving look, and realised part of him had still been hanging to the hope that this whole thing was just a big misunderstanding.
. Everyone in the school was talking (making wild suppositions) about what had happened in the Chamber of Secrets, and the frenzy around the scandal with Lockhart did nothing to help. In spite of that and all the crazy versions of the recent events going around, in-between healing and sleeping off the exhaustion, Hal and Draco had a chance to gather the missing pieces of what had happened.
He put a placating hand on Ley’s arm, who was eyeing Draco suspiciously, and they both stepped away from the tables.
“Oh, darling.” Petunia sighed. “Magic doesn’t solve everything. I’m sure medical spells would be just as hard to learn as regular medicine.”
“Is that public knowledge, or…”
The word on the page startled Draco, and snapped him out of the bubbling anger that was starting to rise beneath his skin. Liar? No. Hal was anything but. Draco had actually always admired how he would just speak his mind, even when it was ill-advised. He didn’t conceal, he didn’t pretend. He was as honest as they came.
“You’re okay, though, right?”
“Harry Potter.” She continued sternly. “You realise you’re whining because you’re special?”
She waved a paper she held in her hand. “Lockhart’s trial made the front page of the
Draco gritted his teeth. That hit a spot, and Flint knew it.
“I’m counting on you.” Oliver pledged solemnly.
“What is- I can’t- Master!”
Underneath the acceptance letter addressed to him and the list of school supplies were a number of pages that, Hal guessed, were sent as standard to children who did not live among wizards.
Marge’s eyes went wide, but he added with determination. “Leave my brother alone. And just, like, leave.”
“You stalked me?” Hal raised an eyebrow, unimpressed.
“I’m really sorry.” Draco looked down.
After a couple of minutes of shuffling, brotherly bickering and moving luggage, the three of them were sitting across from each other and the twins had gone off to find their friends.
“Maybe he wasn’t one.” Ron suggested.
Blaise decided it was just exhausting to be friends with them, if they couldn’t go two months without one of them ending up in some dire straits, and please could Draco just add that he said ‘Take care’ at the end of his letter. Draco rolled his eyes, but disappeared into his room to write. Anthony though he’d probably want some privacy for that, and he headed out to the library with Pan.
“No, it could be a great big joke.” Hal shrugged. “It just seemed a bit of a coincidence. Oh, come on.”
“Who are they?” Hal asked.
He stayed like that for several seconds, as if keen to give the opportunity to someone to take a photo. Which was when Hal realised, the two wizards who had been sitting at a table behind him were, in fact, and journalist and his photographer, and sprung up to buzz around Lockhart, who waved at them like he was greeting old friends.
Draco caught a glimpse of himself in a mirror when they entered the bar, and he didn’t look anything noteworthy either. Only the body Pansy was in was striking, really, tall and muscular but lean, with sharp blue eyes and dark brown hair. She seemed to be loving it, too, as she directed them to sit down and act like they belonged there and weren’t twelve, ordering and being served like she owned the place.
place to be for a lot of kids , and Draco had no doubt it would only intensify as they got older and bolder and learnt more spells.
“It won't stop him from
Sirius gave him a look of disbelief, then barked another laugh – closer to actual mirth this time.
“What is he up to now?”
“One of us should use this.” He thought. “Get Neville, fly back to the hatch. Get the teachers.”
“I don’t want to impose on anyone.” Petunia hesitated.
.” Hal bent towards Flint, now frozen on the bench, and his voice dropped to a deceiving softness. “But if you ever get near Draco again, you won’t know
to tell her. He just had.
“But you were right.” Dumbledore added. “The same protection spell your mother unknowingly casted, with her whole core, when she died for you…” (Hal forced himself not to flinch, but he’d very much appreciate if the old man stopped mentioning how his parents
“I kicked his legs, he kicked me back.” He brought a hand to his shoulder to indicate where. “My head hit the wall, or, like, the sink, so I thought that was it, but that’s when Professor Snape arrived and stopped him.”
“I’m sorry.” Draco whispered.
“Alright, boys.” Madame Malkin swooped in before he could say anything else, plucking the tapes from the air and waving her wand so pins would slot into place on the fabric. “That’s it for school robes, they will be delivered at Hogwarts so they can put the finishing touches on them when you’re sorted. You’re all done, my dear.” She added to Harry with a smile.
“There are many forms of magic, Harry.” Dumbledore said. “Modern magic is channelled into wands and spells, but there are older energies that still exist. They are simply no longer known, no longer in use. The instinctive magic of children is one of them, rooted deep in our magical cores – we lose our access to it as we grow out of our innocence.” He gave Hal a gentle smile. “We could talk about different sources of magic and their history for hours.” He cut it short. “I will spare you for now – I have to agree with Mrs Pomfrey, you need your rest.”
There wasn’t a chance in Hell he was giving up Quidditch.
word.”
“It’s nothing. Just a bit restless. I’ll be right as rain tomorrow.”
“Hemy.” Pan interrupted, surprising everyone with the nickname. “This is us. Do you really have to ask?”
“It was him the first time.” Draco blurted out. “It was him…”
“No, I mean, we can talk about this later if you want.” Draco shook his arm, pointing across the grounds. “But I think Hagrid’s hut is on fire.”
“How.” Remus repeated weakly.
“Draco.” Hermione interrupted him gently. “It’s not like he made an Unbreakable Vow of it. Let’s go find him, and see if anything happened that upset him, or something, alright?”
Hal, Ron and Anthony exchanged another confused look, reflecting the one they could see on the other kids’ faces.
“Thank you, Irma.” McGonagall told the librarian as they walked past. “I am taking these three to my office first and I’ll escort them back.”
“Is he always that pompous?”
than the rest of the grand mansion, but then Draco had pushed open the double doors at the other end, and Hal’s jaw had dropped.
“I didn’t do anything.” Hal said defensively.
. It felt good.
Blaise mimed an imitation of her – one that was strangely good – and went off to sulk as well.
The way Ron and Draco were looking at him, Hal felt like they were asking him to pick a best friend, right now, for life, no take-backs, and the one who wasn’t chosen would be mortally offended and never speak to him again. There was only one way out of this.
It was broken off by Professor Flitwick when Oliver and Marcus Flint, somehow, came to physical blows, by which time Douglas had quit the team and announced he hoped they would all burn in hell. Both Snape and McGonagall swooped in, took off house points where deserved, and Snape shepherded the Slytherins away.
Draco didn’t bother pointing out this hadn’t been his fault. He knew perfectly well you didn’t reason with a bully, he’d seen enough of them, though usually not through being their victim. Beckoned by Flint, Bulstrode was suddenly all over him going through his pockets.
And Hal could swear, like several other people that day, that he’d looked straight at the corner of his forehead where, underneath his thick hair, the skin was marred by his scar.
Hands down, Hal thought, as weird as his day had been so far, the wand shop was taking things to a whole new level. First of all,
And with that, and one last unscrupulous grin, he walked away, leaving Draco with his heart beating in his throat.
“Slow down.” Severus reached him and grabbed his arm, both managing to check he was unharmed and to give him a grounding little shake. “What are you talking about?”
“It’s fine.” Hal didn’t quite snap, but his voice was dry. “I guess trying to find out about my parents’ friends was a stupid idea anyway.”
Draco couldn’t help but take a step back, because though Flint’s attitude had somewhat changed from the snarling brawny teen who was never wasting an occasion to shove and punch him the year before (and that certainly had something to do with the fact that, Flint himself having repeated a year, most of his mates had now left school, leaving him behind to finish seventh year a lot more on his own), there still was something predatory in his stance.
When he stopped for a breath, Hal took the chance to comment.
*             *
No thanks to Ley, but rather in spite of his best efforts, they had managed to get the kitten onto a warm makeshift bed made of a baking tray and old tea towels, and Hal was feeding him some milk using the tip of his finger, when Draco and his mom Apparated in the front room.
“Why are you being
“You are amazing.” Neville finally said.
“Oh stop trying to
broken his neck when tumbling down a flight of stone stairs. Even if bursts of accidental magic such as these were supposed to fade with age, Hal clearly had a powerful magical core.
He wondered if Hal was still with Quirrell, and decided to head that way to see if he could find him. He had crossed most of the first floor without meeting him on the way, and was getting near the staircase to the second floor when he heard a shout.
“I wouldn’t say this is simple.” Severus moderated in a warning tone. “The potions are one thing, which has to be done right, rigorously, for the next several years. But there are more aspects than the purely chemical to any transition.
Hal considered that for a moment. “No
Hal grunted at the call. They didn’t need to tell Hermione! She would probably try to talk them out of it – and fair enough, part of Hal did kind of want to be talked out of it, but it was the right thing to do.
“What was your plan here, throw him in and hope for the best? You cannot send an eleven year-old without a hint of a warning to face off… what even was that, by the way? There is nothing left of Quirrell down there. Potter couldn’t have done that.”
Her mouth dropped open, but she didn’t seem to be able to come up with another barb, and Draco was alarmed to see that her eyes started to shine.
“Going home tomorrow.” She sounded like she was looking forward to it, too. “You’ll get to rest during the holidays, right?”
“I’ll go.” Draco volunteered. “I’ll try to find Severus again, or get whoever’s around.”
Hal felt a bit stupid for not having thought of that before, considering how he’d wanted to find someone with a video camera the year before. But wizard photos were almost as good as film, in that they moved. If Colin agreed to document something a tad more interesting than him walking down the corridor, maybe Hal could show is aunt and Ley a game of Quidditch, a few spells, how the castle looked.
“That’s what he prefers to be called.” Draco informed him. “Because being
It seems to surprise Hal, and maybe softened his stance, just a bit, but enough to give Draco hope that he could accept his apology. Once again, Hal spoke before he could.
“You’ve not been yourself.” Hal completed for him. “And Ron says it’s because you’ve been hanging out with Slytherins, and I
“A lightning bolt?” Hal frowned.
“How?” He forced the panic down, though it was swelling up rapidly. “When?”
He hopped off the stool, grinning widely as the robes pulled themselves from him and went to slot tidily on a rack to the side. Madam Malkin waved her wand again and a little scroll of parchment followed - no doubt bearing Harry’s name. Draco’s robes followed the same route, but he stayed up there. He knew his mother wanted him fitted for dress robes too.
There were gasps and murmurs in the audience – as if the whole story hadn’t been public knowledge already; the rumours had been running wild all summer after they’d spilled out of the Hogwarts student, to the point where it had become so ridiculous Dumbledore had had to make a statement towards the end of July to set the record straight.
“Yeah, it clearly looks like it. Because, don’t think I’d not spotted the one on your jaw too. Harry said you told him you fell, but-”
“Unless they’ve lived under a rock.” He answered. “Or in the Muggle world, I suppose. They discussed putting you in chocolate frogs, but then thought you were too young.”
“Nothing, sorry.” Hal turned back to them. “I think Quirrell was eavesdropping or something.”
Draco attempted to sit up, but Flint pushed him back down with a foot to the chest.
Harry Potter was… not what he had expected. He was tiny, for one, he looked about seven years old, though Draco knew a lot of kids who hadn’t hit their growth spurt yet. It didn’t mean he’d stay small. But the stories about him were larger than life, and Draco had expected him to be taller. Not that he hadn’t been impressive – he looked like he packed more of a punch than a Pepper-Up potion.
and tried to get away (both of Hagrid’s arms clamped around it) and
“Saved both our lives down there.” Hal commented succinctly. “What do you want?” He addressed Fawkes.
“What direction?” He asked.
Things got a little unruly from there, as they went into Pansy’s ridiculous dressing, picked some clothes and enchanted them to be adult sizes – Pansy’s dad, of course, had a permanent permission spell cast around the house so she could pretty much do any magic she wanted during the holiday. And unlike the one Draco benefit from at the Manor, that one included any underage wizard walking into it. It was already making Parkinson Hall
Ravenclaws whooped and clapped, but the most calculating among them sagged in disappointment, well aware that although current points put them on top, two more Gryffindors in the celebrated group hadn’t received their rewards yet. And sure enough, the headmaster went on.
“Look, I don’t know.” Hermione huffed. “I’m just telling you what I observed, and
He swung it over his head, and it took him several tries to properly remember the spell Anthony had used the previous year (Aloha? Aloarma? Alohara? What
His scar was still hurting, but it was almost secondary at this point, as Hal used both hands to hold the shaft of his broomstick in a death grip and tried to will some control back into it. He seemed to work to some extent, at least insofar as it allowed him to not be flung through the air, a bit like riding a mechanical bull as it started going faster, and faster. Hal had done it a few times, at the summer fair near their house in Surrey. He’d been quite good at it. He’d also not been 60 feet above ground.
“It’s so cold!” Ley shouted like it was the best thing that had ever happened to him.
This last chapter is split into 3 parts, but I will post them in quicker succession and not with a week-long gap between each part!
Tom showed Draco how after a girl was killed, the Headmaster (not Dumbledore yet, at the time) decided he had no other choice but to close the school, and Tom simply could not let it happen. And he was clever, and resourceful, and it didn’t take him too long to find the offender – not the Heir of Slytherin, and Draco felt Tom’s contempt at the mere idea that his culprit could have anything to do with this noble lineage, but a boy with a dangerous history of becoming besotted with lethal magical beasts.
“She did, yeah. She likes doing things around the house.”
Hal gave him a meaningful look, and Draco finished his thought.
“Alright, how about this.” Pan grinned. “If Hal catches the Snitch, you have to tell him how you feel.”
“What Animagus was Professor Lupin?” He challenged.
He turned to give Ron a look of confusion, but he only shrugged.
“Music.” Draco dropped between two breaths. He could feel the stitch forming under his ribs.
“What do they think I’m going to do?” Hal muttered angrily. “Set a snake on them or something?”
“Rest sounds good.” Hal confessed.
“The Marauders?” Hal repeated, just to be sure.
But Mrs Norris wasn’t, and Hal needed to find a way to get out of there, fast, before she or her master returned. He glanced back at the fireplace, considering using it to Floo back where he was meant to be, but he didn’t really fancy going through that again. The door was locked, he tried it cautiously. It left the window.
Hal gave him a look.
“Police is on their way.” He told Hal. “Hang in there, alright. What’s your name, lad?”
“Can't be doing a Wronski feint in every game.” Sirius teased.
Draco had been worried about getting along with the boy, about the dynamic between him and Hal from years of growing up together and sharing everything, between Hal and himself from school and magic (and his unmentionable feelings), and between the three of them as a result. But Ley was easy-going as can be, if anything it was hard
Pan narrowed his eyes at him. “And what’s your sister’s name?”
“We should not have doubted our masters.” Fred said emphatically, slapping a hand to his chest.
“People died.” Ron muttered. “There’s nothing fascinating about that.”
Anthony nodded enthusiastically, but then gave him a considering look.
“Oh, stuff it.” Ron told him good-humouredly. “How was everyone’s Christmas anyway?”
thing to do, no offence…”
solution.”
As they stepped onto the carriage, Draco spotted the Weasleys – a small hurricane of noise, laughter, chaos and red hair. They always gave him a feeling of bewilderment, and maybe something like envy. The close-knit relationship between siblings was something Draco would never know or have. He day-dreamed about what it would be like to be a twin, sometimes, like Fred and George.
bakery and café.
.” Hal’s hoodie turned a burgundy red that wasn’t quite a statement either, but would appease Anthony. “It’s temporary.” He assured Hal, who looked crestfallen for a moment.
“It’s because he’s actually good, while you wouldn’t catch a Snitch if it came flying into your face! You are an utter disgrace of a Seeker!”
“Anyway, we thought this Peter was a kid who used to be in Hogwarts, we always saw him in your dorm, we thought his magical signature had gotten stuck on the map or something.”
Hal shrugged, just as Ron stomped on her foot, just as her mouth opened in realisation. Neville looked like he was only just refraining from facepalming.
As it turned out, not many people shared Ron’s opinion, which Hal could tell was getting on his nerves a bit as well. Even Fred and George had been unusually quiet – “I’d rather they were taking the piss, as usual”, Ron had admitted to Hal.
“Mister Potter’s incredible ability, indeed, would be more than valuable if you are right, and we are dealing with a Basilisk.”
“It’s due to start sometime in August, I think probably towards the end of the month, so…” He shrugged. He didn’t want to think about it now, if he was honest. “Holidays first. But we thought we could maybe combine that with our shopping in Diagon, meet you guys that day?”
I don’t think there was any way the group wouldn’t find out about Hermione’s peculiar timetable and ask how she does it. In the book it’s such a big plot device that Harry and Ron conveniently let Hermione change the subject and never question it again, but that doesn’t seem very realistic.
Both boys were looking at her like she had grown an extra head. She had always tried to encourage their imagination, but she was a very down-to-earth woman, and she could see that it seemed very out of character for her to be talking about magic like this. She would have been worried if they had taken this in stride with no amount of surprise, actually.
He’d known Sir Nicholas was well old, the clothes gave it away a bit, but to be haunting a castle (and a school, at that) for
Luna shrugged. “I’m used to people thinking I’m weird.”
“Wow.” Anthony was the first to speak. “She was… something.”
“Potions.” Hal sighed. “As if Snape did hate me enough.”
“Hey.” Nils said softly.
Hal was startled for a moment, as the implication crept in on him. He’d never asked himself (or Neville for that matter) how and why he’d been raised by his grandmother – he’d just accepted it as a fact about his classmate, never really questioning it. But now that he thought about it, it would mean that his parents were out of the picture, one way or another.
Hermione sighed. “Honestly, I have spent so long this week trying to help Ron and Hal
The old man smiled, and if he had been a lot younger, and maybe American, Hal felt sure he would have tapped his nose.
“I’ve just-” He started, but was interrupted as Ron and Anthony emerged from the trap door on the broom, and he simply pointed at them. “Yeah, that.”
Unfortunately, their last class was Potions.
“I don’t think my mother would disown me.” Draco said hopefully.
“We can’t go off on our own.” Hal reminded him. “Are you alright?”
“Yeah.” George nodded with a little frown, like he hadn’t thought he’d have to explain that. “Every person has one – that’s how they keep tabs on underage magic.”
.” Draco answered.
Pan shrugged nonchalantly. “I do it behind her back. No harm done. That’s what she’s never understood. Pureblood politics, gotta be born into it.”
Draco nodded, and his mother stepped into the fire, followed by Petunia, Hal and Ley together, then Draco himself as he took a final, deep breath before going through.
She still wanted to check what had happened to Draco in order to make the correct dosage decisions. Draco stiffened against Severus at the idea of telling the tale. He remembered Riddle taking over, his will and consciousness slipping and he all but watched himself walk Hal through the castle then into and below the bathroom, and his energy, his life slowly being leeched away from him, even though everything became darkness until he woke up again back in the Chamber, a bloodied Hal leaning over him and the enormous corpse of the snake behind them. It was terrifying if not humiliating.
Blaise, to his credit, immediately noticed the looks on their faces and dropped the attitude.
“Don’t worry.” Hal smiled. “I know I can call you for backup.”
Neither of the other three kids said anything.
“What? No.” Hal interrupted, giving her a stubborn look. “I am not going to school without seeing Ley.” He asserted.
In the end, Dumbledore would be taking Pettigrew to the Ministry where the Aurors would make an official arrest. Sirius had to surrender himself to them as well, awaiting a proper examination of the testimonies and evidence so his name could be clear, and he went with obvious reluctance but also Dumbledore’s assurance that he would not let anything happen to him. Lupin wanted to come with them, but the Headmaster kindly reminded him of his teaching duties. That seemed to echo with McGonagall, who started shepherding the students back out to their common rooms.
Although even Anthony, scatter-brained as he could be, couldn’t miss the bruises as he walked in on Draco getting ready for bed in their room that night.
The fact that he had escaped Azkaban was… a little disturbing. She imagined him on the run, pictured scenarios Alexandre Dumas would have been proud of. Maybe she read too much. She had suggested to her mom trying to reach out, to send him a message so they could help him, but-
They walked back the couple of carriage lengths to the compartment where Hermione and Ron were still sitting, discussing magical primary school, by the sounds of it.
and his cronies would be staying – he’d overheard as much when sitting with the Gryffindors, as Wood was complaining he’d booked the Quidditch pitch for practice almost every day, holidays included. Draco thought that would certainly mean hell for him, as the little gang had still been insulting him, tripping him up in the corridors and asking him for money any of the few times they could find him isolated.
“Them all being Slytherin gits would be a reason.” Ron mumbled at that.
Draco choked slightly on the sip of wine he’d just taken.
Hal looked almost annoyed at the intrusion, but his face softened as soon as he saw Ron, Hermione, Neville and Anthony approaching.
“You should really try not to get distracted so much, Hal.” Hermione chastised him. “You already have less time to study with your Quidditch practice, and…”
They fell backwards in a tangle, rushed to their feet as the door mercifully clicked shut, and ran – though there would have been no way the massive heads could come through the door, let alone the body – and only stopped when they reached the six-fingered suit of armour, and the edge of the staircase. The bannister was up, but they could see a flight of stairs lazily spinning towards them.
Draco felt the blood drain from his face, which Anthony again noticed immediately.
When Hal came to, it was to the sound of worried whispers, and unfortunately still to a punishing headache. As his eyes fluttered open, he also realised both his hands were being held, as whoever was holding them reacted to his waking up. The whispers went from worried to excited, relieved.
“Our room.” Anthony volunteered. “It’ll be more private.”
“You’re right, how can you choose.” Nils said. “It’s not like we’ve given you much to go by.”
“What’s that?” Draco prompted.
“Draco!” Pan greeted him with a smile, spotting him first. “A pleasure as always.”
After a moment of silence, Pan spoke again.
“You want us to a) gamble, and b) bet against our friend?” He asked, unimpressed.
“Oh, thank you.” Luna beamed, shaking her hand. “I’m Luna. Oh, Ginny already told you. You must be her brother.” She turned to Ron. “You have exactly the same aura.”
Draco couldn’t believe Hal had actually made the Quidditch team. Ron had warned them his brothers could be very persuasive, but there had not been a first-year student playing in a house team for over a hundred years, not since one apparently died (though Draco was pretty sure this was a school legend).
Hal followed him in, feeling stupidly relieved when the man did not close the door on them. He went to his desk and picked up a book, which he handed him.
“Hm?”
In some ways, though it felt a little cruel to the man to think it, Sirius had actually done him a favour.
Hal briefly had time to think
“I think it would be incredibly weird
“We can still go back up.” Hermione pointed out.
Book one of this rewrite is almost complete, so while I can’t promise I will get to the end of rewriting all 7 books (I have a full-time job, it’ll take years!), this one for certain will not be abandoned.
“Looking good in green, birdie.” He called out.
“Oh, it’s an old gentlemen club my father used to go to.” Draco explained. “Women aren’t allowed in but we always meet up in front. It’s in a quieter area so it’s easier to Disapparate.”
“You won’t tell anyone else?” He looked more uncertain than Draco had seen him in a long time.
Hal could tell the old man was just waiting for a question from him to go on rambling again, so he carefully did not ask what was so curious.
Unexpectedly, although Draco’s heart skipped a beat when he realised what he’d just said, and who to, Flint did not pounce to slam him against the wall with his arm across his throat, nor did he come to knee him in the stomach or anything like that. No, he
He shook his head, smiling to himself at the memory of that poor fish Ley had won at the funfair. It had turned out you could not replicate cryogenics on goldfish by putting them in the freezer. Who would have guessed? It hadn’t seemed obvious when they were seven, at any rate.
“I know what Halloween means to you.” He said. “I guess… ten years must feel like a milestone.”
“Did Colin never tell you why he was such a fan of yours?” The Hufflepuff girl asked.
“Are you seriously outing me right now?”
“As far as I can tell.” Dumbledore’s voice piped up. “The troll attacked and Mister Potter did a remarkable job with a shielding spell for him and Mister Malfoy, while Mister Goldstein – quite bravely I may say – fired a number of stinging hexes at its back. Then you arrived, Severus, and…”
The voice made him jump, and he looked up in a start. A few feet from him in the corridor leading back to the changing rooms, Flint was casually leaning against the wall. Tired, annoyed, entirely out of patience, and did he mention tired, Draco did not think, and he snapped.
“They wouldn’t let a werewolf teach in a school full of children.” Draco argued.
Because he wasn’t an idiot, and he could admit that it hadn’t been particularly sensible to start pouring his every thought into an artefact of unknown origin and dubious reliability. He’d known that from the beginning. He’d just gotten caught up in it.
“Your school sounds safe.”
“That’s your
“Oh, that will be a nice change.” Hal said sarcastically.
“I know.” Hal smiled again, soft and fond.
They both whirled around, a little startled, finding Anthony’s father standing in the doorway to the kitchen.
Anthony laughed. “In my family it certainly is.”
“Look where that got her.” Neville sniffed – he was crying again.
“I don’t know, but… Well. Oh, you know what I mean. Everyone talks about him, but he’s… he’s just a normal child, Arthur.”
“You can’t keep him.” He asserted.
Thankfully, that resulted in Draco snorting, then trying to pretend that he hadn’t made such an undignified noise, but still looking amused. Which was better than the frown and pout, as far as Hal was concerned. He hadn’t meant to upset him with his indelicate questions.
“T’es folle, j’ose trop pas.”
“I know that.” Hal sighed. “If nothing else, we’ve seen Peeves mess up with enough shit to know that.” He shook his head. “But I’ve never heard of any ghost going around petrifying cats.”
Severus had only seen it once in practice; it was a rune-based spell that needed at least three wizards to cast, in order to create a stable plane for transference. It was related to Apparition, but much less abrupt, and was used to transport patients in critical conditions with minimal movement. Severus couldn’t help a purse of his lips as one of the Healers started tracing runes on his classroom floor, but he supposed it was a small price to pay if Longbottom made it out alive, as much as he disregarded the boy. Very quickly, the team were ready – three placed in a triangle to hold the spell, and another two holding Longbottom steady.
This time his godfather raised an eyebrow more visibly, and Draco expanded. “You have to stop bullying him.”
“Elisa. She’s from Brazil.”
“Yes!” Hermione confirmed enthusiastically. “I have read that nowadays 34% of wizards are born to Muggle families, and 58% to at least one Muggleborn parent. Studies have shown that it is in no way related to individual magical strength or ability.”
He carried on making his way through the crowd.
“Well, that settles it anyway.” Ron sighed, and expanded when everyone else gave him a questioning look. “We definitely can’t ask him.”
“Single mother?” She smiled at her.
“Hey, who wants to come with me to Nick’s party?”
. At the moment, for Blaise, it seemed to mean less being chummy with Purebloods, and more getting close to the Boy-Who-Lived, even if that meant being friendly with a group of Gryffindors and Ravenclaws in the process. And that group still included Purebloods and the Malfoy heir, albeit wrongly sorted, so that was a bonus.
“It’s Harry Potter.” She whispered, though loud enough for them to hear from where they were. “It’s Harry Potter, it’s Harry Potter, it’s Harry Potter.”
“That could explain the voice.” Hal conceded. “But not the petrified cat or the writing on the wall.”
He half-consciously raised a hand to rub the scar underneath his hair.
“P-professor…” The man squeaked. He then turned to Hal, as if he thought he’d be the better ally. “Harry. You-”
“Hal, no, don’t go there.” He understood immediately. “There was nothing obvious about this. You couldn’t have known.”
“Draco.” She said reverently, joy still in her eyes, and so much love, more than she had shown in years, though Draco had always known it was there. “Mon trésor.”
instead of
As for the Gryffindors, he didn’t know which of spending the rest of the month with a million Weasleys, stuck between Longbottom and his grandmother, or in a Muggle home, appealed less. Not that he had any idea where they lived. While his friendship with that lot had grown steadily throughout the year, they’d not actually exchanged addresses.
“Yeah.” She scoffed. “An
“So you think it could happen again?” Neville worried his lip. “Someone… dying?”
Hal felt entirely unable to speak, but thankfully the trio weren’t quite done with their story.
“Oh, Harry.” Lupin breathed out softly. “Of course they would have been.”
Hal blinked at Draco, standing at his bedside, and briefly wondered confusedly where the rest of his family had gone.
“Oh, there you are. We were wondering where you’d gone off to.” He only then seemed to notice how pale and shaky Draco looked. “You alright?”
There was another beat, before the Hat’s “mouth” opened as he announced:
“People change.” Hal frowned.
“What?” Hal started.
Petunia’s lips parted, but she said nothing, and had that look Hal recognised from when she was on the phone to a friend, and told a lie explaining why they couldn’t meet up. Guilt.
“Yeah?” Hal frowned.
Hal laughed. “Fair enough.”
Anthony was startled into a laugh. “Well.” He said. “I’m sure he wouldn’t have minded helping, but he’s pretty rubbish at those. On the other hand.” He added with a grin. “My mom’s pretty good with hair-cutting scissors, if you don’t mind going at it the Muggle way.”
Everyone looked at him.
The girl turned to say her goodbyes, and Hal did the same, feeling a little awkward.
“Take this lot out of here.” Severus spoke over her again. “Miss Granger and Mister Potter are still down there. I will go.”
*             *
“I guess.” He mumbled.
A small arrangement they had made, so that Hal wouldn’t miss his cousin’s birthday for the sake of a few days of school term. Ley had been unsure about postponing the actual celebration, arguing that it wasn’t the same if it wasn’t on the day, until it had been agreed he’d get two cakes out of it. He was happy with that. Hal still didn’t feel good for almost making him miss out on that one, too.
“What if it’s here now?”
The boy startled slightly at being addressed directly, and he turned cautiously to Draco as if the measuring tape would attack him if he moved too suddenly.
“Millicent Bulstrode tripped me in the courtyard and I fell into a pillar.” Luna finally gave him the full account, with a resigned sigh. “I wasn’t looking where I was going.”
“So…” Hermione started cautiously. “Could he be going back to the castle?”
to happen to him and his wife, rather than thinking he was a paranoid lunatic, snatching the tin and shoving it into her bag in a huff before leaving him standing there.
“That’s about being gay.” She noted. “Not about who you’re gay for.”
The news had shocked Petunia enough that she’d let him carry on.
“No offence.” Lee wheezed at Luna when he managed to catch his breath from laughing. “But I don’t think this will happen.”
Whistles and cheers erupted around the room, mostly from the Ravenclaw and Gryffindor tables. Rolf looked slightly startled, and Neville turned a deep shade of pink. Dumbledore’s voice seemed to sound a little louder, no doubt magically enhanced, as the continued his enumeration to cover the sound of the bustling room.
“Like you weren’t looking.” Hal chuckled.
“What happened to you?” Draco blurted out in return.
“Hey little brother.” They greeted. “Hey friends of little brother. Hey Ravenclaw visitors.”
“What? That was a compliment.”
“Harry, darling, come in, come in! It’s so nice to meet you!”
There must have been something threatening enough in her eyes, because he didn’t need telling twice. Petunia kept hold of Hal, grabbed Ley with her free hand, smiled at the little girl who wasn’t crying anymore but looking at them with adoration, and dragged both her wayward children outside.
It was all Draco’s fault.
She handed it to him – Draco knew it would be from Pan, he was the only one he’d given their French address to, figuring any other post could wait till he was back at the Manor. Hal knew that too, and he almost looked relieved to be able to worry about someone else.
“What the hell was that?” Hal asked.
“Professor Snape is tracking it down and we will be
And it wasn’t like he was a
“I asked Rolf’s grandad if he had any ideas about what kind of creature could be in the school.” Anthony related. “I can’t honestly think of someone who would know more about magical beasts, but even he was stumped.”
“I thought it was a curse.” Pan countered.
“I think you all have to be pieces.” He surmised eventually.
“Use him.” She’d shrugged one time Hal had been complaining about getting ambushed for an autograph again.
He gestured with his fingers half an inch from each other, and it successfully defused the tension as they both laughed.
“Fawkes cried on it.”
He looked dazed, his eyes unfocused, which immediately had Hal worried as he slipped his phone into his pocket. Draco had been moody for a while, even his birthday and the treats he’d received from his mother and his friends (they’d pooled together to get him a box of luxury salted caramel-filled chocolate broomsticks from a renowned Belgian chocolatier) hadn’t cheered him up.
Not a tremendously long chapter and only two different scenes in this one, but I hope you like it!
“I don’t think aunt Andromeda and uncle Edward are expecting us much before dinner.” Draco said. “So we should have time.”
“Alright.” The headmaster finally got out of his chair, after a moment, and walked Hal to the door as Hal jumped to his feet. “Don’t hesitate to come and see me if you ever want to talk.” He offered.
“Pan Parkinson?” Pan repeated with a snort. “That sounds terrible.”
“I think that honesty charm is still active.” He said blankly.
Neville, who had been relaxed and having fun so far as he did more and more the longer he spent time with them (they’d all understood his grandmother had been quite strict bringing him up) started panicking immediately.
“See what hit you?” Hal raised his fist – and Draco couldn’t help but gasp as he saw his knuckles were already bruising. “I figured that was adequate payback for what you did to
“I know!” Draco squealed excitedly.
“We don’t know what’s in there.” Hermione continued. “And if he’s really trying to harm you?”
“Merlin protect us.” Hal deadpanned.
“Nearly-Headless Nick!” He blurted out, his heart beating like crazy. “You scared the sh- You scared me.”
Draco couldn’t quite bring himself to grin back with the same amusement, so he deflected.
If felt exactly as Draco would imagine being whipped with a belt on bare skin would feel like. He laid there, the breath knocked out of him, as Flint snarled on.
Last chapter! Although I had to split it in two because it was so long. I will post part 2 over the weekend. Then we're done :o
“Ew, no, shut up. It’s Fred and George’s birthday on the first, and they’re having a party at home at the start of the holiday. They wanted to invite the whole Quidditch team.”
“I’m fine.” Hal managed through gritted teeth.
Hal and Draco had taken full advantage of magic meaning they could come back from holidays with twice as much stuff as he’d left with to buy an unreasonable amount of gifts and treats to bring back to their friends, including a box of French Every Flavour Beans they had to buy again after they’d sampled them and ended up eating the whole thing (Ley had helped with that).
“Thanks, guys…” Neville said hesitantly, his smile a little fixed now.
And with that, he opened fire with a quick firework spell that whizzed past the troll’s head and popped behind it, causing it to turn his massive head long enough for Anthony to dash and disappear into the alcove – so much for no sudden movements.
“We’ve lost ourselves too, though.” Hal noted.
“The boy could have been killed.” He snarled.
“Oh, that’s cool.” Hal smiled, pleased at the thought. “I’ll ask my aunt next time I call her. I’m sure she’ll let me come.”
“I remember Lily and James being good looking, but wow.” She added with a whistle. “Their genes combined in all the right ways.”
“So someone in my family…” Hal started.
“I don’t want to eat, and I’m not staying here.” Hal insisted, and he tried to make for the door, but she interposed herself.
Well, that was the dilemma. He could stay. On his own, since all his friends would be going home to their loving families, while
It was tradition, among the Pureblood circles, to hold a grand Yule ball at the start of the holiday, when Hogwarts students returned to their family over the break. Historically, the Sacred Twenty-Eight would take turns hosting it. In recent decades, the list had lost some families – such as the Lestranges, of which all members were in prison – and gained others, such as the Zabinis,
Ron yawned again in agreement, dragging himself to his feet, and looking expectantly back at the others, like it was inconceivable to start climbing the stairs to their dorm rooms if they weren’t following. Hal smiled back at them, almost wondering suddenly what he was so strung up about a minute ago. It was something so casual, his friends looking out for each other for even the simple journey of going up to bed, but it warmed him all over. Hermione was right.
“Six.”
“Hang on.” Draco came to the rescue before she had a chance to speak – though judging by his puzzled frown, he hadn’t particularly meant to time it that well. “You were in Arithmancy with us this morning. When did you go to Divination?”
She glared at the books in question as if they had personally offended her. Ever since the events on Halloween night, she had been relentlessly going through every book she could think of that might refer to it.
“But we wouldn’t have had this if he hadn’t died.” Draco expressed quietly. “He just wouldn’t… We wouldn’t have had this.” He repeated, shaking his head.
money, to him it was just something for his aunt to manage, and something that would help when he was an adult, his family’s inheritance, like everyone else. But the mounds of gold in that vault, that was another story.
“Ah, Harry.” The old man said cheerfully, like there weren’t remaining flames and a pile of ash where his pet had just been.
“See?” She sighed. “Fancy.”
Draco gave him a troubled look.
“Yes, because you going off alone after a troll sounds much wiser to me.”
“You’ll be fine.” Ron told him the night before the game, stopping for a moment in the way he was stuffing his face with all the birthday sweets and cakes he’d received like it was a competition.
“No, you’d be right.” He sighed. “I’ve not been feeling confident.”
“How come you’re not already there?” Anthony was the one to ask, though only because he beat the rest of them to it.
“I know.” He looked down. “She was just being so… so…”
Hal still thought it was weird to hear Draco refer to the unpleasant Potions master as ‘Sev’, but he supposed he could only trust him that the man was more bearable in a private and godfatherly capacity than he was during his classes.
“Hey Fred.” They all smiled back – the twins’ good spirits were usually contagious like that. “Hey George.”
“How is my little Dudleykin, how is he?” Marge was already cooing as she barged past Petunia, bulldog on her heels, and made her way through the house to the door leading to the back garden.
“He’ll still be in the dungeons.” Hal said sharply. “Where a freaking
“Are you drunk?” Hermione narrowed her eyes at him.
“He didn’t quite go as far as diagrams.” He moderated. “But yeah, I know, it’s difficult magic, and I should be glad I can even conjure anything, blah, blah.”
“Do you still want to come in?” Anthony quipped.
Hal had a headache. Hermione would probably tell him it was from eating too much sugar, and it sure might not have helped, but really it was a combination of their busy day running around Hogsmead, the conversation he’d had with Draco – who had had an odd look on his face since, and Hal wanted to take it back, or tell him to stop already, or to come out with what he had to say about it, if it was bothering him – and the noisy Great Hall. Plus, well, Halloween. It always made him feel a little off, nothing had changed about that.
“What?” He probed her.
“Do you really have to?”
. Quirrell was standing in front of it –
He’d held out the tin, and spoken quickly, so she wouldn’t interrupt him.
“Right.” Hal nodded. “So maybe it’s guarding something. But what could be so important that it would be kept here, and guarded by a giant Cerberus?”
“Oh.” Hal reacted, embarrassed. “I’m not sure about that, I mean…”
Draco’s eyes widened. “For what?”
“I know.” Hal nodded. “We’ll be up bright and early to get everything tidy and help you in the kitchen.” He said teasingly, almost reciting.
Ron was saved from having to express an opinion as they reached Flourish and Blotts, and there seemed to be way too much commotion there for a bookshop.
“Draco, what the hell.” Hal breathed.
“That’s the gist.” Hal confirmed.
Hal had a little frown. “Yeah.” He confirmed like it was obvious. “We weren’t just down there having a cuppa.”
“Welcome to the mad house.”
“I- what?” Hal blinked at him. “How?”
you! I told you!”
Draco had felt his heart skipped a beat when Blaise had dropped the name
Hermione did not deny it, and she also couldn’t quite manage to stop looking vaguely pleased.
“Yeah.” He shrugged, turning back.
. But she did that, and he had learned to accept it as her own way of caring.
“You’re mental.” He told his friend, hoping he would hear how hollow his laugh sounded to his own ears.
I have feels for Neville okay he deserves more credit
“You take a seat, I’ll put the kettle back on.”
“It’s just a cruel prank.” Neville reasoned. “Even if Filch thinks you might have done it, it doesn’t mean he thinks you’re a killer.”
Hal wondered when the shift from
Hal wondered briefly how this whole thing had gone from
After they’d gone back to the dormitory, Hal isolated himself in the bathroom and phoned his aunt.
“My Aunt Walburga has this family tree tapestry, where she used to burn the ones she considered blood traitors. I wonder if I would have been one, too.”
“Take a seat, Harry.” The headmaster invited. “I wanted to speak to you in light of recent events.”
He shivered, suddenly feeling the cold – it was no longer grounding.
Draco was, frustratingly, only the third of their friends to visit Hal during the holiday, due to commitment his mother had already made for him – the Easter break was always prime time for reasserting one’s place in society, which in terms of Narcissa Malfoy’s events calendar meant shopping, politics and lots of parties. Draco was definitely too old now to get a pass, he was probably only a year shy of being officially seen as the head of the family, and not just its young heir.
“Draco.” His godfather smiled pleasantly when he opened the door and saw him. “And Miss Parkinson, hello.”
“And exams are coming up, I know, Hermione, I know.” Hal rolled his eyes with a smile – though whether he was smiling at her, or just couldn’t stop grinning as Silver pounced on the piece of string he was holding, was unclear.
They carried on playing until, eventually, Hal saw the Golden Snitch. He spotted it above their heads, but he could tell Draco was watching him just as much as he was scanning his surroundings – because he was doing the same thing – and he knew at a glance that if he went straight for it, the other boy would get there first; he was just that much closer that Hal’s speed wouldn’t make up for it.
“With that guy Nils.” Draco recalled.
“Agreed.” He nodded.
Given the decoration in the room, it didn’t surprise Hal that she knew his name, but it still unsettled him to hear it.
Hal forced himself to ignore the tightness in his own throat, and the stinging in his own eyes.
“Okay.” Hal lied the universal lie all kids lie when asked by their friend’s parents to call them by their first name.
“Hello, Harry.” The headmaster sat down. “I just wanted to see you were alright. And to say congratulations, for how you handled everything tonight.”
It was Draco who answered. “A Patronus charm.” He said. Everyone turned to him and a faint blush crept up his cheeks. “I’ve seen my mother use one. They are the best defence against Dementors, but they are also used to carry messages.”
He turned, and his cousin flipped two fingers at him with a grin. “I’ll miss you too.”
She frowned with sudden suspicion.
“Myrtle?” Anthony repeated, echoing the look of confusion on everyone else’s faces.
He explained how he’d left the feast to find his godfather, how Hal and Anthony had wanted to warn him about the troll, how they’d unfortunately ran into said troll, and how they’d done the best they could think of from there. He astutely pointed out that he had been in the path of the troll all along, oblivious, and that if Hal and Anthony had gone to a prefect or teacher instead of running after him, it probably would have been too late by the time they found him.
“Wasn't sure what your folks would like.” Sirius justified. “Oh, hello!”
He did understand where Sirius was coming from – it felt a bit like trying to convince a World War I soldier back from the trenches that he could be very good friends with the Germans if he tried.
“Yeah.” Draco breathed. “I can imagine.”
“Burnt off?” Hal repeated in confusion.
The crowd split again, everyone turning to look at Hal. Hal turned around, feigning ignorance.
“I’m tired.” He admitted. “Not just physically, that’ll pass, but… I just wanted this year to be normal, and it’s been anything but. Everyone has an
“No.” Hermione frowned, like she’d not realised they hadn’t actually figured that one out. “Myrtle.”
“Yeah.” Hal nodded. “I had to tell my aunt about the game.”
“He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, the dark wizard trying to take over the world at the time, tried to murder a whole family.” Ron put it simply indeed. “There’s this curse that kills, but somehow when he cast it on the baby it… bounced back. And killed him instead. And the war ended.”
“Darling.” She said softly, taking his hand and giving it a little squeeze. “He’s safe. You both are. You did so well.”
She leaned forward to kiss him on the forehead, and Hal knew she was more relieved than mad.
Until he saw Flint say something to one of the Beaters, and then, though Draco could have imagined it, he was sure for a moment that Flint looked straight at him. And a few minutes later, instead of a Bulger, that Beater smacked his bat into the back of Hal’s head, barely even trying to make it look like an accident.
Ley leaned forward to look at it, clearly having immediately sensed his cousin’s distress, going by the look of concern on his face and the way he probably unconsciously squared his shoulders a little as if to shield Hal.
“Congratulations?” He added hesitantly.
A knot in his stomach, Hal realised that in all the commotion, the ten-year anniversary of his parent’s death had gone right past him. As soon as the realisation hit, Hal knew he wouldn’t be able to go back to sleep, not as long as his heart was beating that hard in his chest. He sat up on the edge of his bed, trying to breathe deeply and ward off the beginning what was promising to be a cracking headache.
Ron frowned. “What do you mean, you don’t know?”
“I need to check something!” She said as she started running.
He wasn’t sure if the spell itself had worked – but it had been enough to throw Lockhart off balance, and for his spell to miss.
“What, so you could go and punch someone in the face for me again?” Draco sneered.
The happy task of managing the six of them had fallen onto Arthur Weasley, while his wife took the rest of Ron’s siblings (namely Ginny who had just gotten her letter) to get their things. As it was, the two groups ended up pretty much shopping together, in an unruly gaggle of excited children.
Anthony snorted, Hermione looked generally disapproving, and Neville shook his head, amused, though Draco suspected he secretly rather admired Blaise for his brashness and Dementor-may-care attitude.
Sirius, Hal was pleased to see, looked great. He had put on a bit of weight since Hal had last seen him (and certainly since he'd first met him), he was clean-shaven, his hair was cut just right above his shoulders and had a good shine to it. He finally looked healthy, and as young as his actual 35 years. Hal even spotted a few students, mostly girls, do a double take, and while he couldn’t look at his godfather with the same eyes he was looking at, say, Diggory, he could see that he was in fact rather a handsome man.
“Okay.” Hal shrugged. “Probably just a ghost passing through or something.”
Neville appeared, looking a little disheveled as well.
“What?” Hal turned, startled out of his thoughts.
Ley snorted behind him, but Lockhart ignored the sass – or it didn’t deter him – and marched right up to him.
“You must have many questions.” The old wizard said encouragingly.
He only had to wait about ten minutes till he could slip in alongside a group of fifth years, and he luckily found a large group of the younger students studying (chatting) together on one of the large tables, Millicent among them. Perfect, in his opinion. He hadn’t come here to
of introspection.
Ley huffed and puffed, but in the end he joined Hal on the sofa, who didn’t really mind, because he was playing with Little John Silver. He’d hold a little piece of parchment up, and the young cat would jump to try and catch it, as Hal lifted his hand at the last moment to pull it out of his reach. Three out of four times, Sil was quicker.
“Harry!” Oliver called from near the entrance to the changing rooms. “Butterbeer awaits!”
gone into the details of their death, and she had not mentioned the small fact that they were a witch and wizard. Until now.
Pan then greeted Anthony’s parents properly. “Pan Parkinson.” He said. “Thank you for having me.”
He caught up with Anthony and Draco, and they made their way out of the dungeons. Neither of them spoke until they were back out in the main hall, and started climbing up the stairs.
“Let me say this again.” Lupin continued. “The Patronus spell is very advanced magic. Many adults can only product an incorporeal one, and some none at all. So don’t expect too much.”
fall.”
Hal gave him a slightly outraged look. Low blow.
She gave them half a minute to absorb the news, before she explained that they were putting new measures in place, whereby students would be escorted by members of the faculty between classes, and a curfew would be imposed.
He looked amused at how Hermione almost sighed in relief.
“Wandless magic is extremely difficult, Mister Potter.” The man pointed out. “And for a wizard your age especially. Do you expect us to believe you achieved this?”
Draco personally thought it was ludicrous, and as the twins insisted it was so far the most likely scenario to happen out of all of the ones they’ve been given, he dissolved into helpless laughter.
“Well, yeah.” Ron said, looking at him like he didn’t see what the problem was.
“Hal, calm down.” She told him. “That was upsetting, we all understand that, but it’s not Ron’s fault.”
“Unbe…” Ron trailed off. “You didn’t realise you spoke another language?”
Moaning Myrtle ghosted through a cubicle door, looking incensed at the sight of them.
Which was what found him crying quietly by Hal’s bedside in the infirmary an hour later, distraught, guilty, and with no idea what to do, when Hal opened his eyes. Pomfrey had treated him as soon as she’d arrived on the pitch with a Wound-Cleaning Potion and a bandaging charm on his head, and had taken him back inside for a Blood-replenishing potion.
Professor Lupin had risen from the table and rushed to him, while McGonagall, following in his wake, was already trying to calm students down as well as get both men to move from the middle of the room to somewhere more private.
Draco chuckled. “Honestly, it wouldn’t surprise me. You’re welcome to come and have a look.”
Draco only responded with an amused look, so Pan tried again. “I'll share the profit with you.”
Severus actually smiled – rare were the ones ever blessed with the sight.
“Yes, but…” Draco hesitate, casting a glance towards the various Weasleys, but nobody was really paying attention to them. “Hal, they don’t have a lot of money.” He revealed. “Several course books like that, expensive as they are? It’ll make a big difference for them.”
“For what it’s worth.” He smiled. “Blue suits you.”
They spent the next two hours of their Sunday afternoon trying out the cloak in turn, and reached the conclusion it really worked, because nobody had been able to see them or even suspect they were there in their trips across the courtyard – apart from when Anthony collided with a group of Hufflepuff and Hal and Neville had to quickly create a diversion, in order to keep the cloak a secret. Draco had suggested that they did – he thought it was too good an asset to let the entire school know he had it.
They’re out of character for 12 year-old boys, I know, and I don’t care because the ability to have mature conversations makes it a tad more interesting.
“Nothing to worry about.” They caught the end of what the young witch was saying as they approached. “Oh, hello! Hogwarts?”
Hal’s brow furrowed even further. “I didn’t
“No, I know, I meant…” Hal stopped, biting his lip. “Where’s your elf?” He squeaked distressingly.
“Wouldn’t change them for the world.” Petunia said honestly.
behaved.” Ley said, looking at his mom pointedly, and Hal could guess they’d already have that conversation.
“He’ll be alright.” Hermione patted his hand. “It’s nothing you did.”
“I know.” Ley sighed dramatically. “You’ll just have to do something worthwhile in this world too so I can get some of the glory.”
“They won’t hold your sorting against you.” Severus stated.
She heard the tell-tale noises of one of her boys going to the bathroom, then soft footsteps down the stairs. She could safely bet on Hal – Ley tended to sleep until 12 unless forcefully removed from his bed. Putting the lid back on the tin, she took it with her as she went down to the kitchen.
Long chapter this one. Plot! Revelations! Angst!
Hal had heard about phoenixes, vaguely, though mostly as an expression. Like a phoenix from its ashes? He thought it meant something like coming back stronger? But there, he spotted it – from what he believed were just charred remains, a tiny baby bird head poke out and gave a healthy little pip.
“I do, but then I went to badger Sev until he told me everything.” Draco had a bashful smile. “The version that is going around is that the ghost of You-Know-Who infiltrated the castle, possessed Quirrell, and kidnapped you to steal a weapon that was hidden on the third floor, but you disintegrated him.”
“They’ll be too late.” Hal said.
“So you killed a giant snake with a sword from a hat.” Anthony summarised. “Another day in the life of Harry Potter.”
.” The nest of snakes disappeared and Snape sliced through the crowd, and glared viciously at Hal. “What do you think you’re doing, Potter?”
“Hal will be back for Christmas and Easter.” She said, trying to make that sound like something positive, and hoping he actually would.
“But don’t let that take anything away from what a feat that was.” Fred added. “You’re a natural, Harry, that was truly great.”
“I’m glad you’re okay, my darling.” She then narrowed her eyes. “But if you and Ley weren’t going to drive me up the walls if you stayed indoors, you would be grounded for the entire summer.”
“We need to give Snape, or someone, the Marauder’s Map.” Hal expanded. “So they can find Remus, and maybe no one gets hurt.”
clever, even as he refused to share the secret of how it was meant to keep the stone safe exactly. Personally, Severus hated that thing. He had only once caught a glimpse of what the mirror would show to him, and he was
“Of course she does.” Sirius commented. “Merlin help the DMLE.”
“How do you know he doesn’t feel the same way?”
“Well, it did.” Hal mumbled, uncomfortable. “And it’s ugly.”
“She’s still little.” Narcissa said fondly, stroking the owl’s – her – belly. “But she’s young, she’ll grow a bit. She’s a hawk owl.”
” Anthony breathed emphatically when Ron turned around after stuffing his winter coat into the overhead rack. “What are you
She walked them to the infirmary, and while Madam Pomfrey frowned at seeing the group of them, she let them in for “five minutes, no more”. McGonagall stood back to speak to the matron, or maybe give them some privacy as they huddled up around Hermione’s bed.
“Are we going to dinner or what?” Anthony called. “Oh, hey Rolf.”
He didn’t mean that to be addressed to the Hat specifically, but well, the thing was inside his mind.
“I’m sorry.” Hal blurted out. “I was following him, I think he’s under a spell or something-”
He knew Snape had tailored it to his specific needs to ensure the best possible efficacy.
“I suppose they did.” Petunia had never tried to find out.
3.	I picture Rolf as basically a crossover between Newt and a male Luna :)
He didn’t wait for an answer, other than Pan rolling his eyes. His family had walked up to the gate and he turned to them.
“Right.” Pansy looked at him thoughtfully. “So you’re in love with Harry Potter.”
Just another note as we are only a few chapters short of the end of this opus. Book 2 is under way, but I've struggled to get it started, because, well, it kind of doesn't happen without Lucius and Vernon. Harry's birthday forgotten and miserable? Doesn't happen. The whole mess with Dobby? Doesn't happen. Harry not getting his letters? Getting broken out by the Weasleys because he's locked in his room? Missing the train and flying there in the car? Lucius slipping Ginny the diary and therefore the ENTIRE PLOT? Well, as you can imagine, I've had to find other ways to make it happen, and it's taking me some time to write. I just hope I can start posting without too much of a gap between books. Don't hesitate to share some of your ideas!
“You’ve done this before.” She hazarded.
He didn’t care right now who the boy was or how he knew his name. He wanted Draco to be alright and he wanted to hell out of here – in any order.
He stopped as his foot made a splashing sound, and he looked down to see water all over the corridor.
“Hi.” Hal didn’t think she heard him, as she’d already ran away.
When he saw Arthur Weasley at the funeral, presenting his condolences to his mother alongside other colleagues, he wondered why he'd ever thought the Weasley children were unlucky losers. They still had a father. And if Arthur had been hit by that parcel-bomb instead of Lucius, they would have had each other - all staggering seven of them. Draco knew enough to realise that, with the loss of his father, he was losing the chance at a sibling. By the time he was seven years old, Draco had fully started thinking for himself. He could no longer base his beliefs and convictions on the sole fact that his father had said so. His father was dead. Who was to tell him who was worth his time, who to avoid or befriend?
“My first period.” Pan supplemented. “Yes, I’ve read that. I’ve not had that yet.”
Draco broke into a run, his blood turning cold at the fear he could hear in the voice of whoever had just called Hal’s name. As he skid around the corner, he saw Rolf Scamander, rushing to the foot of the stairs, and Draco thought his heart was going to stop when he spotted a small body curled at the bottom of the steps, the mess of dark hair unmistakable. It did stutter, and restart, as Hal rolled on his back, eyes shut tightly closed in a grimace of pain.
“Alright, stop moping.” He told him before Hal could say anything (presumably,
“No, thank you.” He replied – for all of them, going by their nods of approval.
“Your bird.” Hal said in a strangled voice. Was he going to pin that one on him, too?
“There is still no way you made it rain.” Ley argued.
Millie startled at the mention of her name, and tried to act like she hadn’t. She opened her mouth like she was trying to find a way to answer in the same fashion as Pan and Draco had just been speaking, but she didn’t have the pedigree, if Draco could allow himself that titbit of snobbery.
Hal gave him a disbelieving look. “With no exaggeration, of course.” He deadpanned.
“Well.” Rolf said carefully. “None of the victims may have met the creature’s eyes directly. Colin Creevey had his camera in front of his face. Justin would have seen it though the Gryffindor ghost, and he’s, well, already dead. Hermione and Penelope had a mirror.”
“I’d never leave you.” Draco said, maybe a little too intensely.
Well, no, he knew. He had taken it personally after Quirrell had pushed him down the stairs and he’d gone after him in anger. But he realised it had been reckless, and he could have gotten someone (besides himself) seriously hurt, and he wasn’t going to do that again, especially after what had just happened to Hermione.
"You can't just expect your boyfriend to help you with everything."
"Harry, I'm sorry bud but could you like shut up, please and thank you?" He says making Harry cry harder. "No? Ok then." He wasn't really awake enough to try and get the baby back to sleep so what should he do?
They walked into the classroom as the bell had rung. The teacher had just came in behind them. "Take a seat so I can do roll call."
After class, which was just them going over introductions and the syllabus, Harry packed up his stuff and waited for Hermione at the door. "Weird, I'd think Ron would meet us at the door," Harry said, confused.
"After school, I guess, and would your house work?" Malfoy asked quietly, quickly packing up his things.
After roll call the teacher announced that they were going to project. The class groaned. "Oh be quiet, I'm also picking the pairs." The students just rolled their eyes and sighed violently.
He still couldn't help but think Malfoy wasn't as ok as he said he was. He didn't want to push it any further because he didn't know everything. He still couldn't think about leaving him.
"I know we don't talk, like ever, but I wanted to see.. if maybe.. you'd wanna.... go out.. with me?" He was sweating nervously, maybe he should turn around.
"What's got her knickers in a twist?" Harry just shrugged.
I nod, forcing myself to keep the tears wanting to come out to not fall. I'm stronger than this.
He grabs the handcuffs that were located in Draco's bottom draw in his bedside table. He takes Draco's wrist and puts one handcuff on his left hand, slips the other handcuff around one of the bed frames' bars and then puts his right wrist in the handcuff. He's facing away from Harry and towards the bed frame.
"I guess I'm always gonna be the bad child, I guess I'm always gonna be the mad child, cause you will never understand my weird mind, my weird mind."
"Just trying to see what you see in him, and I do admit, he's got a rather fine arse," he punctuated the sentence by grabbing the blondes ass, in turn said blonde yelped and tried to push Nott's hand away.
"Can you just get it?" Harry chuckled but nodded. Harry leaned over to him and licked the chocolate off his chin.
"Ask you what?!?" Harry asks, now more confused than before.
I don't know...
"Ok, do you wanna go back to my dorm and take a nap?"
One new message from: Redheaded dumbass #7 "Hey mate, you dressed yet? we'll be there in five."
Harry rolled his eyes but got up nonetheless. He headed to his closet to put on that outfit. The eighth years have dorms that they share with a roommate but Dean was spending the night with Seamus.
"I do love newspaper but the teacher this year is Rita Skeeter," she huffed.
"I know, love but you need to bring it down a notch, at least until we get there." Draco just nods and sits still.
To: Scary ass bush
We were walking into the classroom, Hermione in front of me when I was yanked into the hallway. I didn't know what was happening until I was pulled into an abandoned classroom and pushed up against the wall.
"Snape just gave us like 6 assignments that are due in two days." Hermione rolled her eyes.
I look at his face and he has the biggest smile that I think he's trying to make into a smirk but failing miserably. I look at his friend's faces to see if I could find any form of a lie or joke. I found nothing but pure excitement.
He grabs his coat near the entrance of his own dorm before leaving.
"Well you're always playing games so what's the difference?" Draco gets confused.
"Of course I care, it's upsetting you so obviously I wanna know." Harry's eyes widened. He opened his mouth to say something, but nothing came out.
Draco just grabs Harry and pulls him in to hold him. "I'm sorry, baby. What I actually want to ask is, will you be my boyfriend?" Harry huffs and turns around, crossing his arms.
"Put me down!" Draco just laughs.
"I know, but I can't. I'm just so excited, I've never been on a picnic before," Draco sighs.
"Can't, I have that English project with Malfoy."
He just decided to go flying. He grabbed his broom and headed down to the quidditch pitch. On his way outside he ran into Draco. He saw Draco start to speed walk towards him.
Then they were off.
One new message from Scary ass bush: "HARRY JAMES POTTER, WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!"
Monday came around and Draco was getting really impatient. "She's five minutes late, is she even gonna show?"
"Ok."
Fuckin simp:
Sirius had awoken to Harry crying in his nursery and his husband, Remus, still fast asleep next to him, a half eaten chocolate bar beside his head.
Once they got out of the car, Ron was complaining about a headache, which everyone else ignored. Once they got into the school Ginny came running up to them and began to hang on Harry's arm.
"Yes, Scarface, I'll be fine," I smiled, poking him in the side. He laughed while pushing my hand away. He looks at me with a sad smile.
Draco sighs and throws Harry on the couch, causing him to let out a small yelp. "Now talk."
Once they were on their way back home, they were just listening to music and enjoying the others company. Draco soon fell asleep, tired out from all his excitement.
"Honey, I don't even know what I did wrong, could you please just tell me and I promise I'll fix it." Harry was so confused and his face showed it.
"Um, which one?" Padma asked.
Harry contemplated just blocking Draco and going back to sleep, but he decided against it, this really was the only time he can talk to him.
"What?" I ask. "Nothing, it's just your giggle is really cute," his eyes widened when he realized what he had said. I start to blush even more, if possible. "No, I didn't mean-" he started but I just say, "Draco, it's fine, I know what you meant." Honestly, I didn't know what he meant but that's not important right now.
"Computer science"
"Uh uh, this is so special, no one else is allowed to even see such a thing."
"All my life been putting on a fake smile, sitting on my own, feel like I'm exiled."
"So, Hermione, what happened at Pansy's?" Harry asked. Hermione blushed.
I walk away.
"You trying out for basketball this year?" Harry asked, changing the subject.
"Harry, I'm fine, you didn't need to tackle the bitch," Draco laughed slightly. Harry, seeing Draco laugh, started to smile at him, pulling him into another hug.
Daddy🥵:
Harry immediately lifts his arms up, wrapping them around Draco's waist and pulling him down. The position making it impossible for Draco to move but giving Harry the perfect angle to eat him out.
Draco turns to face Harry to glare at him. "The fact that you don't even know what you did wrong disgusts me to levels I didn't know existed!" He shouts.
"Yeah, me too, but I don't want my parents to know yet, but once we graduate we will let people know."
"IT IS SERIOUS, YOU BAFOON!" Draco yells, louder than before.
"I know, but I want to get him something perfect. He's the best thing that's ever happened to me and I'll be damned if he isn't spoiled with everything he deserves or I will die on this rock."
We made out for a while, taking small breaks here and there for air. After about 15 minutes we stopped because we did need to go to class.
After Draco got all the pictures he wanted, which was three 10 packs of film, much to Harry's displeasure, Harry found it adorable but wouldn't admit it, they sat back down on the blanket and just talked.
The rest of the day was the same, boring, beginning of school stuff.
"So, Potter, it looks like the spell worked," Malfoy smirked at me.
As Blaise was paying he felt his  back pocket vibrate.
The outfit that Draco was referring to was green lacy panties, black jean booty shorts, fishnets, a green crop top shirt that says "Master's pet" in black, black four inch heeled boots, and a black collar.
He realized he had zoned out, being brought back by Ron snapping in his face, "you alright there, mate?"
The blond smirks, "oh, so I need to start moaning out your name hm? Like, Harry~" he moans out into Harry's ear, earning a growl.
He just would ask Malfoy. He looked to see if he was still there, he was. Harry walks over to him, "so, when and where should we do this project?" Malfoy just shrugged and pushed his glasses further up his nose.
"Oh, he knows what he did." Hermione just rolled her eyes, got up, just said, "library," and left.
Malfoy just looked into his eyes and told him that nothing shattered and that maybe he had imagined it. He quietly thanked him for caring enough to "take time out of saving the world and go to a stranger and make sure they were ok"
Harry bursted out laughing. He sighs while going to his closet to pick out his outfit for the day.
Scarface👅💦
Around a month ago Harry had realized that he had come to like, maybe even love, Draco. He knew the feelings would never be returned but he sucked it up, at least he has this with him.
Harry was about to get down and start helping when Draco stopped him, flustered. "It's fine, just go to class," that's when he got everything situated and left.
"Because, Harry, I know you, you're obsessed with him."
Harry pinches the bridge of his nose, closes his eyes, and takes a deep breath, trying to figure out what he did to deserve this amount of his boyfriend's fury.
Harry and Draco are just fuck buddies, but is that all they want?
"Yeah, trying out for captain," Ron said with slight excitement in his eyes.
"Draco, you need to calm down, I'm coming," Harry called down the stairs, smiling while rolling his eyes.
He couldn't, this was his fault, for agreeing to this. Draco sat on the couch as Harry kneeled down in front of him. Harry reached out to unzip Draco's trousers but Draco stopped him, apparently seeing the boy's emotions clear on his face.
I looked towards my parents, my father clearly pissed off, wanting to leave but mom was crying, holding him back.
Draco bounces as he sees Harry walking towards him. "Finally, can we go now?" He whines.
James' laughing stopped immediately and Harry has to stop himself from laughing. "No, ma'am!"
"So you don't love me?" Neville asked, amused, which made Blaise's eyes widen because he didn't get that Neville was just messing with him.
"Oh," Harry didn't know what to say.
Harry hurriedly gets into the bathroom, shuts and locks the door. Once he's in the building up tears start to fall rapidly.
"Who?" Ron asked
"What was that, Potter?" His eyes widened.
Harry watches his boyfriend as he drives home. He looks out of the window to see ripples in the puddles to show that it's still raining but not as much as before. He continues to watch Draco until he ends up falling asleep.
It has been about 20 minutes since he left Harry's presence and he was walking around Hogsmeade with a slightly nervous Blaise.
"Huh? Oh, uh, yeah, I'm fine I just have to tell you something." He looks kind of concerned but I quickly reassure him, "It's nothing really, don't worry." He looks like he's trying to force a disgusted look on his face, "Worry? Malfoys don't worry, we have nothing to worry about!" I start giggling at that but immediately stop because Draco started to look at me like he was amused.
Please have gotten that last sentence reference🙏🏻
He goes into the bathroom, luckily it was one that was only one stall.
Wanna meet me in the ROR?
"UGHHH," came a sudden noise. Harry turns around to watch as a distressed Ron flops backwards onto the arm of the couch.
"Harry, you need to calm down, I love you too." Harry gasps and goes wide eyed.
"Oh it is, is it?"
"Ready to go?" Blaise asked as he came towards him, not looking up from what he was holding, a look of fondness clear on his face.
Once they were in they noticed Draco sitting in the back, head down, basically invisible. Harry and Ron sat in the back as well but a few seats away.
Draco gives him a confused look, "what rock?" He asks, looking down to see if he was standing on a rock or something.
"Yes, but-" but he was stopped when Ron spoke up.
I want my tongue inside of you so badly
Harry rips all of Draco's clothes off.
Harry smiles at his adorable boyfriend, admiring how he looks in his outfit. Draco is wearing a pastel pink cropped sweater, high waisted, white jean shorts with pastel pink fishnets underneath, his pastel pink converse, and to top it all off, a pastel yellow, pink, and purple flower crown sitting on his head.
It was a small little park in the front but as they walked down the trail behind the playground there was a huge flower patch.
"Sit," Harry commanded. Draco followed the simple order, sitting with his hole right above his dom's mouth.
"Of course you will, you're my ride home, duh," I looked at him sarcastically as he rolled his eyes.
"All good things I hope. I've heard a lot about you too, except for your name, for some odd reason," Draco said, sticking his hand out to shake Hermione's while side glancing at Pansy.
They walk along a little pathway through the flowers until they find a patch of dirt big enough for their picnic. It was around 12:30pm once they made it. Harry sets the basket down and gets out the blanket.
"I guess I'm always gonna be the bad child, I guess I'm always gonna be the mad child, cause you will never understand my weird mind, my weird mind. And to every single person here that doubts me, telling me that they could live without me, cause they will never understand my weird mind, my weird mind."
Daddy🥵:
"Man, he's got you whipped," he chuckled when he saw that Blaise started glaring at him, about to say something.
Draco bounces as he sees Harry walking towards him. "Finally, can we go now?" He whines.
Sirius silently tip-toed into the nursery cautious of waking Remus. He walks over to the baby's bed and pick him up.
"Blaise, you need to calm down, this boy is so in love with you, you could get him a dirty sock and he'd think it was the best gift he's ever gotten. You know this."
"YES, wait, what?" Harry asked, almost to tears again.
To his surprise Draco Malfoy had opened the door. He had bags under his eyes and he had tears drying on his cheeks. His eyes looked blood shot. He had a jacket on that was zipped up to his chin.
"StOp," Harry whines.
Harry had tackled Nott to the ground and just kept swinging, landing at least 5 solid punches before someone pulled him off.
"Not so loud," he hushed while looking around to see if anyone had heard, "and I don't do that-" but Harry had stopped him.
"I need to go to the b-bathroom real quick." Draco notices the crack in his voice and as Harry walks to the other door he can see a tear run down his face.
"No, no, please, daddy, I'm sorry. Please, please fuck me with your tongue like you said you wanted to~"
All I could hear was the thumping of my heart in my ears. I was so nervous. I'm going to ask him out today.
"Earth, Draco," he sighs.
Scarface👅💦
Green
Harry puts the basket in the trunk as Draco gets in the passenger seat of their car. Once Harry closes the trunk he gets into the car and starts it up.
James nods his head understandingly, "Well, do you need a ride?"
"Hell yeah, it is, and I also knew it was you who jinxed me, Hermione just told me I just thought that because I'm obsessed with you," god I really need to stop talking.
"I don't know why I'm saying those things out loud 'Mione. I think them and then say them, I don't mean to. What's happening? It's like I'm not in control of what I'm saying," I said, hoping that I didn't seem insane.
"Sorry, Daddy~" he fake pouts, both of them knowing he did that on purpose.
"Only because he was mean first!" Harry exclaimed, not wanting Neville to give him another talking to. Blaise's smirk quickly faded.
It was always obvious that I was just faking my pride, with that dumbass smirk I always had on. I had to pretend that all those children of powerful people were my friends. Still, even suffering with the wrong people never made father happy.
Harry yawned, tired because he only got a couple of hours of sleep the night before. There wasn't any specific reason why, just that he couldn't sleep.
"I was hungry 'Mione, I hadn't eaten since lunch," said a tall,  freckled face, ginger, getting out of the back seat.
"Ok, fine. Put your hands will be tied to the bed frame." Draco whines but nods.
"World History, second?"
"Potter, you ok in there?"
"Yes he can, because I will. Hey, baby," Blaise said, coming out of nowhere and kissing Ron's temple. Ron smirked.
"You, of course." Draco just looked baffled, never had anyone called him "cute" before.
"Not yet." He gets up from the bed and pulls out a 7in vibrator, it being 2 inches smaller than himself. He can't have Draco finding a toy that can do his job, can he?
Draco admires his silly boyfriend as he plays in the rain.
Harry was sitting up, looking down at Draco who was laying down with his head in Harrys lap. They were just talking about random little things, learning some little stories they didn't know about each other, which isn't much considering that they've been together for six years.
Based off of the song, "Bad Child," by Tones and I.
Scarface👅💦
He knew he shouldn't have said that but it was too late and he honestly didn't care, he just wanted some dick.
I look over in the far corner, seeing Harry with Hermione and Ron. It took a few years but they have finally come to terms with the fact that Harry and I really do love each other. They've come around and now accept me, wholeheartedly.
Draco had brought his polaroid camera to capture some cute pictures of their picnic and the flowers around them.
"Hah." Hermione just crossed her arms and went through the portrait.
They both start to take the food out of the basket and set the stuff out. They didn't pack much as it was just a small lunch. Harry had made them both a turkey sandwich with doritos on the side, Harry liked his in the sandwich, which Draco thought was disgusting but didn't say anything. They both brought a water bottle of tea, Harry's being sweet while Draco's was unsweetened. They had also packed some chocolate covered strawberries, one of Draco's favorites.
At that time a raven haired guy got out of the passenger side of the car. Draco hadn't even noticed him until that point.
and waves at her. He climbed into the back, sitting next to Hermione.
"Ah."
I punch him in the face, feeling and hearing something break under my fist.
"HARRY, HONEY, YOU'RE GOING TO BE LATE FOR SCHOOL!"'FUCK, why does my mom wake me up at the good part?' He asked himself, groaning. He hears a soft knock on his door. "Hey pup, you feeling ok?"
"It's a school day, Ronald, I can't, I have homework and so do you." Ron just rolled his eyes.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that, I didn't mean it." Is what I was trying to say but what came out was.
"That's easy for you to say, you've already found your soulmate. Speaking of which, when do I get to meet her?"
He pointed at the first table in the front, "Weasly and Patil."
Ron nudges Harry, "let's compare schedules while we can, we only have 5 minutes till class." Harry pulls his phone out of his pocket as Ron does the same.
"Blaise, is this true?" Neville questioned, letting go and walking in front of Blaise to be face-to-face.
"Draco, I really need to tell you something now," I say wanting to stay on task, I can't push this away anymore, it's beginning to eat me up inside. "Actually come to think of it, I do too," he said, making me raise an eyebrow at him. "Oh, then you can go first," I say wanting to stall a little longer. "No, no, it's fine, you can go first," he started to seem really timid which isn't like him. "Are you sure?" I ask. "Yeah, it's fine," Draco replied with a slight smile.
The day goes by quickly after and he was headed to practice. At practice they just went over drills and fully established their positions.
"Siriusly (sorry, I had to) did you really think I would have wanted PURPLE curtains in our bedroom? It's like you don't even know me at all!" He says looking hurt.
"EW, why didn't you just use a napkin?" Harry just shrugged.
Harry takes off his belt and shirt, keeping his pants on. Draco was currently on his knees so Harry laid down on his back, face directly under Draco's plump ass.
"Yeah, dad, I'm fine, just stayed up too late," he says reassuringly.
They walk along a little pathway through the flowers until they find a patch of dirt big enough for their picnic. It was around 12:30pm once they made it. Harry sets the basket down and gets out the blanket.
"Daddy~" Draco moans out.
I walk over to him with my hands behind my back so he can't see the gift I bought him. He looks up and quickly puts his hands behind his back and I could have sworn I saw a slight blush appear on his face, that's weird but it's whatever.
"Stay here for me, will you?" He asks, slipping his shirt back on and walking out of the room.
When they were getting ready to leave, it was around 2:00pm. They packed up all of their belongings and started heading back to the car. On the way back they were just holding hands while laughing, stealing little kisses here and there.
"And what the bloody hell do you think you're doing Nott?" Harry said, trying not to yell.
He just stares at his beautiful boyfriend in awe. But he would never admit to it. If anyone asked he would just say he was wondering why he was so stupid and weird for jumping in the puddles like a 5 year old.
Once you are born your nails are painted the color of your soulmates eyes. Once the two soulmates touch their nails turn clear. If a soulmate had died the one still alive's nails turn black with a white X printed on the nails of their thumbs.
"EW, why didn't you just use a napkin?" Harry just shrugged.
"Precalculus, you?"
"But you haven't even tried to talk to me in over a month."
"What's wrong now?" Asked an obviously annoyed Hermione.
Harry bites his lip, deciding on what to.
"I promise I'm not pranking you or anything. You're always welcome at my place, it's the one directly below yours. You can stay as long as you want, whenever you need a friend or just someone to talk to. We can talk about the sound when you're ready. But until then we can just say that it "must have been the wind."
Draco yelps from the sudden pleasure and slight pain. His moans only escalated from there, getting louder as Harry fastened his pace.
Harry let out an "oh, sorry." Then took the cloak off. He pointed the tip of his wand towards the map, "Mischief managed." Draco rolled his eyes and dragged Harry in by his wrist.
"Permanent fuck buddy?"
I start strumming to start the song after fixing the mic into the correct position.
"There's pancakes and bacon for you in the microwave, I have to go to work but I won't be home to around 6 because I'm going to visit Petunia later," she says while kissing the top of his head.
The bell rang and they waved, going to separate classes. Ron hugged Theo goodbye and started following Harry into the classroom.
"Be quiet, slut. You know you're being punished." Draco stays silent, quietly sulking to himself.
Based of the song, "Must Have Been The Wind," by Alec Benjamin.
"Fuck this, I'm way too fucking tired to get up right now. Maybe I can convince Hermione that I'm sick, yeah, that's what I'll do," I thought, smirking, congratulating myself on my flawless scheme.
I woke up, a little startled. I wasn't expecting my alarm to go off this early. I groan and fall back down onto my pillow.
"Mal- how did you know I was gonna say M-"
Harry closed his door, starting to get dressed. He grabbed his phone and it immediately buzzed.
At this point Draco had gotten the alcohol out of the cupboard and was pouring it into a glass. He downs it in one gulp, filling it full once again.
"Yes, love, of course," Harry says as he gives Draco a peck on the cheek, taking the basket from him, and opening the door for him. Draco happily skips out of the house.
"You got a little," Harry said while pointing to his chin, trying to tell Draco there was some remaining chocolate. Draco just rolled his eyes.
Pansy walks up to Hermione, "Hey baby, you still coming over after school?" Hermione sighed, "I told you, love, it's a school day, we'll have to do it Friday."
I guess this is what happens when you just say what you wanna say.
The door flew open as Ron walked through, "Why're you guys taking so looooonnngg, I'm hungry," he whined. Hermione rolled her eyes.
Harry tried so hard to keep any sobs from escaping his mouth. He couldn't let Draco hear him. Harry starts trying to make his face look like he wasn't just crying when he hears a knock.
Draco sighs and looks up. "You didn't even ask me!" He exclaimed.
Nothing interesting happened until Harry, Ron, and Hermione met up and went to chemistry. "It's great that we all have at least one class together," commented Ron. The other two just nodded in agreement.
Harry slightly chuckled, "You'd think they should've, but no, they graduate this year."
Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. "You know what, just forget it." But as he was turning around, a gentle hand grabs his wrist. "I'd love to!" He was turning back around-
"Precalculas, fourth and lunch?"
Harry was asleep when he heard something shatter on the wall in the apartment above his. He thought it must have been a dream.
“It’s just a bit of fun.” Nils replied. “We can go somewhere more private.” He suggested. “Toilet?”
She heard the rest of it, what he wasn’t saying. He wouldn’t have had his friends, either. He probably would have been sorted into Slytherin, so he likely wouldn’t have met Anthony in ways that mattered; and he certainly wouldn’t have been close to any Gryffindors, let alone Harry Potter himself, unless Lucius had seen some political advantage in securing an alliance (as he certainly would have put it) with the boy.
“I’m fine.” Hal answered.
“I hate crowds.” He cut her short again.
He was looking for Hal.
Hal thought he saw Draco flinch as she spoke, but he didn’t have time to look closely as she barrelled on.
“Say me.” Pan answered plainly. “Otherwise I will.”
“No, fair enough. I suspect we’ll be sizing each other up for a while.”
Hal’s life had gotten weirder, which was a spectacular feat in his opinion. Ever since the news about Colin Creevey, the atmosphere had been tense, and there were countless theories as to what was going on, was the Chamber of Secrets real, what monster was in it, and who the Heir could be.
“That was quick.” Hal laughed.
!” Draco threw back. “And I’m not about to let that happen again!”
“Magical beasts can live for a long time.” Hermione pointed out. “It could very well be the same monster.”
“There’s a three-headed dog on the third floor.” Draco started again.
“I was ill for the past few days.” Lupin answered easily. It could explain how worn out he looked. “I had to delay my arrival by a bit, but rest assured that this will not affect your education.”
Draco forced himself to walk – he wouldn’t give them the pleasure of seeing him run away like a scared child. Which he was, he thought bitterly to himself. He didn’t see how he could stand up to Flint without making things worse for himself, and potentially his friends.
“No, you can’t.” Hal laughed.
“Just be careful for me, okay?” She urged him fondly. “Magic can’t fix everything.”
“A girl from
“What was it doing here?” Anthony wondered.
They had an agreement for the Easter holiday: no magic, no owls, no talk of wizardry, nothing else but the three of them as a family, like the good old days. Ley was the one who had suggested that, because he was worried about The Divide (as he always called it dramatically) that could be growing between them, but Hal was more than happy to comply. He loved his new life, but he missed his old one too. He missed Ley.
are responsible for the safety and well-being of
“I thought the same.” Hal smiled. “I mean, the whole Chamber of Secrets thing…” He winced. “I think that’d bring anyone closer.”
“Yeah, alright, will you stop wallowing in self-pity now?”
“What?” Hal asked him.
Unfortunately, the element of surprise and Hal’s speed wasn’t enough for him to cover enough distance before Quirrell’s longer legs gave him back the advantage, and although he escaped his grasp the first time he tried to grab him, he tripped and fell on his face on the steps leading back up to the way out, and the older man was on him immediately.
Draco still didn’t understand how these things worked, though he had to admit they were convenient. Quite a few of the Muggleborn students had them, though not many in first year, and Hal let Hermione borrow his every now and again.
