-So these are children’s rooms,-Draco said, closing the door after himself and pointing at a few others,-There are 10 of them, 6 children in each room. That’s the kitchen and the canteen,-he pointed at the room Madam  Polkinghorne disappeared in,-And that’s the play room,-he nodded at the only door left. The orphanage was painfully small, obviously lacked the founding, but it was clean, and it seemed like the owner really loved these children.
-Seriously, guys, how did you get it?-Neville asked too, but gladly accepted the drink when Blaise poured him one.
-How come I never noticed how charming you are?-Harry joked and left to room to find Ron and Hermione. Draco breathed out once the door closed behind Potter. Very tips of his ears got slightly red and a small, silly smile appeared on his lips.
-That is true. I wasn’t Draco’s friend. We fought a lot. But I can tell a difference between a truly evil man and a child being pulled into their war,-Harry’s words caused a moment of silence. A witch in black definitely didn’t have anything to say to that.
-Soon,-he smiled and watched Harry walk away with calm heart. Harry turned back to him every 3 seconds, making sure it was all real. Something he wanted since his 4th (or third?) year in Hogwarts just happened. Obviously they will meet again.
-What are you going to do now?-he just asked. Like they were good friends and Harry cared and wanted to know about Malfoy's future. Like he wanted to stay in touch and maybe even meet up some day. Like there was no "unspoken" things between them that absolutely destroyed everything they both were. Like things were easier.
-I don’t like your tendencies of getting into trouble,-Potter replied,-You could tell them it was me.
-I came with Draco. To help,-Harry said, feeling exceptionally stupid and out-of-place,-And please call me Harry.
-That’s what friends do,-another risky move, even worse than the first one. Harry also let go of his hand, because now he was almost sure Malfoy wouldn’t run away.
-Piss off, Potter, I’m coming!-Malfoy opened the door, almost hitting Harry with it. In Potter’s humble opinion, there was absolutely nothing wrong with the way Draco looked, but Malfoy didn’t agree,-This uniform looks ridiculous,-he complained and, to be honest, had his reasons.
-I’m sorry. I can’t take you with me now. If I could, you’d already be here,-Narcissa Malfoy had a very thin, apologetic tone. It was hard to correspond the voice Harry was hearing with the actual woman it belonged to. Or at least her image in Harry’s head. He doubted he had ever heard a Malfoy, any of them, being this vulnerable.
-You are literally the most stubborn person I had ever had misfortune to meet. Ever,-Draco said. Harry smiled and they both got up. Neither of them talked until the reached the Quidditch field, but both felt way more comfortable to be in each other’s company now. Harry was glad he’d said what he said.
Harry was slowly losing the last drops of his patience as he waited outside the boys changing room for Malfoy, who had been in there for at least 15 minutes now. Harry couldn’t imagine a scenario where it would take him 15 minutes to put on his Quidditch uniform.
-Yes,-Draco blushed as McGonagall opened the binder and happily gasped. He knew his grades were good. Even better than good.
Lucy had about a billion questions to Potter. Everything concerning his current life, his friendship with Draco, all the rumors about him she had heard, and of course, war. Harry did believe that lying was wrong, even to children, but he didn’t even consider telling this little girl all the truths about everything she asked.
And of course, Ron and Harry were already expected in the Auror Academy. Weasley was very excited to spend another three years shoulder to shoulder with Harry, graduate to fight for peace, stop the evil and do the right thing. It was what they’d wanted for 4 years now. What they talked and daydreamed about. Except…
Malfoy himself was always good at acting as if bad stuff hadn’t happened at all, when he needed to. In the morning he didn’t even look at Harry, walked out of the common room, ignoring Potter’s “Good morning”. However, it did attract the attention of everyone else in the room, including Ron, who looked at Harry as if he had just blown a kiss to Voldemort himself.
-I look like a waiter!-Harry looked closer and couldn’t hold in a laugh. Now that Ron pointed it out…
Harry stopped in front of the pub and looked inside through the window. Yes, that’s what he thought. Malfoy was sitting all alone at the table in the corner of the room. He had a glass of butterbeer in front of him and was staring outside through the glass, thankfully not noticing Harry.
-I did it,-he whispered, not believing himself. Professor Hooch quickly approached them, looked at the snitch in Draco’s hand, nodded and wrote something down in her pad.
-Technically I’m not late and I had some business to attend to,-Draco replied to him,-Ready?-he asked, looking at Harry now and reaching out his hand. Harry just starred at it for a second, not sure if he was supposed to take it or just follow him.
-Hey!-he approached him, handing another glass that Draco wasn’t going to drink,-What are you doing here? Come on!-Harry offered Draco his hand, planning to get him to the couch in the middle of the room, where the whole “party” was.
-Because then it will be your win. Not his,-he nodded at unbothered laughing Ron. Harry rolled his eyes, got up and disappeared outside the Great Hall.
-Looks like there is no choice at all,-Harry said, doomedly. Malfoy made one pointless attempt to join Blaise in his room, but it wouldn’t let him in. He sighed helplessly and looked into Harry’s dorm.
-You too, Harry,-he squeezed Harry's hand a little tighter and let go. Harry was always the exact opposite of the life Draco Malfoy was supposed to have. His father believed that Draco was born to be a Death Eater, the great one. He wanted his son to serve the Dark Lord better than he ever could. He wanted so much from him, but he never asked what Draco's dreams were. Draco was raised to be someone he never wanted to be. He was a ray of light surrounded by complete darkness and expected to become one too.
Same thing happened again this weekend. Harry spent it wondering where Malfoy was and why did he leave, except this time, he wasn’t the only person missing in the Hogwarts. It could have been completely unrelated but Luna Lovegood also was nowhere to be found. She could have been visiting her father at home. Or a friend. Or anyone. But something told Harry it was more than just a coincidence they both quietly disappeared.
-Hey, it’s Pig!-Ron exclaimed as a small bird approached him. Weasley took a carefully folded letter from him and Hermione started stroking the bird, which made it purr happily.
First 40 minutes of the Ball passed in awkward attempts to start a conversation over loud music, absolutely no dancing and occasional weird stares. Still, Draco didn’t move from Harry’s side and looked pretty satisfied, which – as weird as it was – gave Harry some kind of hope. He really didn’t understand himself that night.
-I won't forget. Promise,-their forehead touched and Draco felt Harry's heavy breath on his skin. It sent thousands goosebumps down his body.
-What are you accusing me of, Smith?-Draco said. And Harry was glad to hear him standing up for himself.
-I thought I heard you,-she said and wrapped her small arms around his neck. Draco hugged her back and smiled,-You promised to come sooner.
-My name is Draco Malfoy, ma’am,-Draco said, bowing down. Woman on the portrait was rather satisfied with him.
Draco smiled, took a breath and made a step towards the Hogsmeade when Harry grabbed his hand. He looked into Potter’s amazingly green eyes for a very long second, until his hands covered his cheeks and the world stopped existing. Everything stopped existing. Except for Harry’s lips on his and his hands on his face.
-Listen, I don’t want to pressure you into anything you don’t want. I just want things to be clear between us, okay?-she asked, not a single sad note in her voice.
-Mister Potter!-Professor Hooch attacked them the minute Draco and Harry showed up on the field,-Do you think none of us have anything better to do than wait for you the whole day?
-Gryffindor-I mean, 8th year scores!-Slughorn yelled into the mic, gently pushing Lovegood away,- 40:10, Hufflepuff winning,-first 10 points gave some sense of relief, but not much. And definitely not enough.
They reached Hogsmeade almost without talking. A couple times Draco asked if Harry actually wanted to do it, warned him that not all kids are welcoming and that he really didn’t have to go with him. Harry listened and nodded at Draco, not even doubting his decision to go. Yes, he was nervous. Very nervous. But there was a number of reasons why Harry wanted to visit that orphanage and they outweighed his nerves and fear.
A loud gasp tore Harry away from sad thoughts. He looked up and saw Draco sitting on his bed, trying to catch a breath.
Names on the map didn’t move, only Harry’s was getting closer and closer to them. The door was shut closed, but Harry opened it. Just slightly, for now. None of the present noticed it and Harry started listening.
Draco was on the ground, his broomstick laying next to him. Team’s beater and Draco’s personal bully Michael Harris was standing upon him yelling something. Draco just starred up at him, visibly doing his absolute best not to respond. No one on the field was doing anything to stop Harris. Only after he pulled out his wand and pointed it at Malfoy, Ron got worried
-Oh,-Harry chuckled nervously and looked at Draco, terrified. He let down his defenses for a while and it didn’t pay off,-I would love to, really. But I already have a date,-his lie was so clear that Draco groaned.
-Yet you do have a date,-Ron said and sighed,-Find something black, I don’t like this one,-he asked.
The match promised to be at least not boring and Harry made sure of that when he saw that day’s commentator. Luna Lovegood, without the usual lion’s head hat, but in not any less interesting outfit took her place next to the microphone. Horace Slughorn was sitting next to her, ready to take over once Luna starts to drift away, which will inevitably happen.
Soon the male side of Weasley family (accompanied by Fleur Delacour-Weasley) showed up, the table was complete and the celebration started. The whole house flooded with chatter, laughter, fake insults and love. Molly made sure that George sat next to her and held his hand almost entire time. He didn’t pretend careless or overly happy, George Weasley as usually wore his heart on his sleeve, but that didn’t mean he didn’t make jokes or make fun of Ron. That was sacred.
Turns out, there is nothing quite as forgettable as one victory in the school sports game. Despite Harry’s and Ron’s high expectations, it took Hogwarts less than a week to erase that legendary catch Malfoy performed from their memories. Draco wasn’t really surprised though. He didn’t allow himself to get used to all the attention he suddenly started getting; in the end, it was just a first game, there were others in the future and no one guaranteed Draco would be able to pull off a move like that again.
-No, to Ron. I think he’s giving him a chance to decrease the margin first. Then he’ll catch the snitch.
-Fine,-for what seemed like a thousandth time in an hour, Pansy hugged Draco and together with Harry they left the Great Hall. Harry was more of a tag-along - he waked behind them and didn’t participate in any conversations. He wasn’t even sure why he went with them.
-Hogsmeade, obviously,-Zabini said and continued giving out the drinks. Hermione kept torturing him until he gave up and admitted that they bought the drinks in Hogsmeade and transfigurated them into books to get them into the school. Filch didn’t suspect a thing.
-Harry! Of course, Harry! What a kind soul! What a kind soul!-Madam Polkinghorne exclaimed again and again,-The children will wake up any minute now. I need to make sure the breakfast is ready,-she looked at the clock. Harry could tell the woman had a billion worries and responsibilities here,-Draco will show you around, right?-Malfoy nodded. Analise smiled to them, tears in her eyes and ran to the kitchen.
-Then I'll see you soon,-Harry kissed him once again and once he let go of him, he saw a familiar figure approaching them from behind. Draco saw her too.
Harry and Draco ran to the Quidditch field, and while Potter was a couple steps ahead and couldn’t see Draco’s face, he smiled. And wasn’t as assured in Hufflepuff’s victory as he was an hour ago.
-What would you do in it? What would you dedicate your life to?-McGonagall asked,-It doesn’t have to be a profession. Could be a hobby, or even some abstract concept,-an answer appeared in his head almost right away. Draco just desperately didn’t want to say it out loud.
-Well, yes, “straight” is not a word to use here,-Ron laughed at his own joke and even Hermione couldn’t hold in a chuckle. While Harry was bright red from anger now,-Mate, it’s fine, really. It happens,-Ron shrugged.
But still, Malfoy remained as untouchable as ever. Harry’s rare signs of attention were completely ignored and often glances during classes were never returned. Draco acted cold, colder than ever. And that just sharpened Harry’s interest.
-Why would you want that?-Draco said through a sigh. He didn’t believe him and Harry didn’t know how to change his mind.
-Well,-Kingsley sighed,-Have a nice summer then,-Draco heard steps disappearing in the air and once he walked out of his hideaway, Potter was standing on the same spot, watching Minister go. Draco carefully approached him, with absolutely no idea what to say.
-Doesn’t look like it,-Draco shrugged and Harry didn’t make other attempts to get him to talk. They just finished their coffee in silence; Harry washed the cups (muggle way, under Draco’s shocked glance) and they walked out into the cold of December.
-Or that you knew who did it!-Harry rushed to compensate the distance, but Draco was already looking away and the whole mood changed completely,-We were just trying to get to the truth! And you kept acting as if you knew something!- Draco nodded, but Harry did like that reaction,-It was 6 years ago, you can’t possibly be mad at me for that now. Right?
-Welcome to the first match of the season! And first match ever for 8th year team! Let’s see how they’ll get along today,-Luna started, absolutely ignoring all four balls that already flew in different directions,-I would like to mention the uniform of the team of the 8th year first,-Slughorn already looked pretty concerned, but didn’t dare to take a mic away from Luna yet,-In fact, I helped Ron design it.
-Since I found someone to impress?-Ron said, shyly. For a second Harry froze. It sounded so…not like him. But at the same time, very like him. Harry’s thoughts got messed up and irrational fear occupied half of them. Fear of Merlin knows what; of time that runs so fast that even his irresponsible friend Ron is ready to settle down, of still desperately unclear future, of the ball itself that is a week away and realization of who he was going there with still paralyzed him from time to time. And that “who” was actually the scariest part of all terrifying scenarios Harry had in his head.
-Nothing,-Draco fixed his hair and tried to walk past him, but Harry grabbed his elbow and dragged him away from the curious eyes of their schoolmates,-What the hell are you doing?-Draco pushed him away.
-Yes, see you,-Harry smiled and walked away. And that’s when Draco actually realized the words he’d just said,-Wait, Hogwarts?
Draco lead Harry to one of the rooms, in the very end of the hall. The hall itself was rather narrow and Harry had to walk behind Draco to fit there. Carefully and as quietly as possible Draco opened the door. There were six little girls, all sleeping, not one older than 6. Draco smiled slightly, but erased his smile as he saw Potter looking at him.
-Oh really? Maybe if you had done any work during the war, we’d win faster,-Harry approached Draco and grabbed his hand. No one dared to keep holding him back,-Say hello to McGonagall for me, you all will see her very soon,-without looking at anyone in the room, even Draco, he rushed out of the room, still hand in hand with him. Malfoy was still too shocked to react, but once they reached dormitories, he woke up and pushed Harry away.
-Yes, absolutely. Madam Polkinghorne is your new master, you’ll do whatever she orders,-Kreacher sighed. He wasn’t able not to comply, but he could have given them all an attitude about it,-And you will behave. And be nice to all the children.
-Draco…his mother picked him up…,-he mumbled, hiding his eyes. His head was still far away, back in the Hogsmeade where he did something that could potentially be one of his greatest mistakes and cost him a friend.
If this year truly was supposed to be about healing and moving on, Draco had no idea how he was supposed to do that, if people keep reminding him. He heard hateful “Death Eater” from every corner, every evil mouth. Saw people starring at him as if he personally was responsible for every horror wizarding world had to go through. Heard the whispers behind his back, that were nothing compared to loud insults right into his face. Saw people leaving the room when he walked in. Younger students, who were told by their parents to stay away from him, even some of his course-mates. Draco saw a share of sense in this. People needed someone to blame, someone to hate. A particular alive person; it made the pain from all the losses not so sharp. And there he is, an evil Death Eater, on a silver platter.
Malfoy himself didn’t lack attention too. And that attention seemed to have been very unwanted by him. Draco walked around the school mostly by himself, very rarely with Blaise. During breakfasts and dinners, he sat alone in the very end of a brand-new table, brought into the Great Hall specifically for the 8th year. There was no usual fire in his eyes, no sly smirk on his lips, all faded away. It looked like Draco himself was fading away, slowly getting smaller and even a little translucent. If Harry was to take the courage and assume what was going on with him, he’d say Draco just wanted everyone to leave him alone.
Harry sighed and looked at the very end of the table. It was a lot quieter and roomier there. Social hierarchy worked even on the dining tables and everyone who considered themselves someone, or wanted to be seen with someone, did their best to occupy the seat out in the front. People who either didn’t care or had no choice sat in the back.
-Hey,-it was probably the first and only time Draco showed up in the dorm before Harry was already asleep. Actually, Potter had no solid proof Malfoy had ever slept in his bed before. He laid down when Harry was already deep in his dreams, woke up before Potter finished watching them. But not today; 11pm on the clock and Draco falls into his bed, ignoring Harry’s greeting.
Harry and his friends saw it all too. Obviously, they didn’t take part in bullying, but no one rushed to defend and protect Malfoy either. Potter thought that something like this could happen in Hogwarts once they all come back. Many children lost their parents or other loved ones. In a way, hating on Malfoy was natural for them, though, of course, he didn’t deserve any of it. And though Harry managed to prove Draco’s innocence to the Ministry, he knew he didn’t stand a chance when it came to a bunch of angry sad teenagers, even if he tried.
-Draco, go! It’s okay!- Madam Polkinghorne said as she managed to drag her into the bedroom. Even when the door closed, Harry and Draco still heard her gut-wrenching cries. For a second Draco stood there and then stormed out of the building so quickly that Harry didn’t even get to react.
-RON!-Harry exclaimed way too loudly, when the idea struck him. He gasped and grabbed his arm, scaring Hermione and everyone who heard them
The game had already been on for almost an hour. The score, that changed for the last time about 20 minutes ago, now was 50 : 20. All players were tired, Ron looked beaten down.
-Okay, Okay!-he hugged her again,-I’ll always be your friend. Even if you have a thousand other friends, okay?
-On the next game,-Harry said when Luna finished. He already started stumbling on words and forgetting what he was saying, but this topic seemed to have been so important to him, that his voice was firm again,-We have to make sure everyone uses the same brooms.
-Yeah, but it’s a good thing we did,-Hermione said. Ron smiled, obviously misunderstanding why Granger was so glad to be back,-We need to graduate to find proper jobs.
-Because I think you could use this year to find out what you want. Truly want. Where your hearts is,-McGonagall made a pause,-You still have time to think, a plenty of it. But if you want my opinion…
-I’ve talked to many students who used to be members of Dumbledore’s Army,-McGonagall smiled. Warmly and motherly,-And to say the least, you exceed almost every Defense Against Dark Arts professor Hogwarts had seen in years,-Harry’s eyes sparkled. It was one of the best compliments he had heard in his life. And a couple seconds later, Harry finally understood what McGonagall was implying.
-Lucy, what happened?-Draco wiped her cheeks and tried to look into her eyes, but the girl just refused to react.
On the next morning the usual noise and chatter that flew over the great hall during the breakfast reached its peak. Graduates, who now made up a significant percent of the Hogwarts population, discussed their future plans with one another, preparing for their Career Orientation sessions. The trio wasn’t an exception, except Ron didn’t see much sense in discussions, since all three of them had already made their choices. Hermione would go to the Ministry and do her best to fix all the injustice and make the world a better place, which, in her occasion, weren’t just empty ambitions.
-If not now, then later,-Draco sat down again,-If she sells it, I won’t have anywhere to go. My home will be gone and I’ll have to go with her. No matter what I want,-Draco looked down and Harry sat next to him.
Maybe because of boredom (professors decided not to torture the Mister National Hero with homework that much), maybe because of Harry’s natural curiosity, but once again, he tried to keep a close eye to Malfoy and what he was doing. Now his motives weren’t as ominous as two years ago, but he still thought Draco wasn’t acting like himself. It could have been too much to expect, but Harry sort of thought (or even hoped) that some kind of relationship with Malfoy would inevitably start, now that the war is over. At least he had every right for it after he bailed him out of Azkaban. But Draco didn’t even honor him with a glance on their first day back in school or ever after. They shared a dorm and managed not to talk even once. Once Malfoy’s name appeared on that table on their wall, Harry imagined his endless complains about having to be in Potter’s presence all the time, thought that every day of his 8th year in Hogwarts would end in a fight with Malfoy. But he didn’t say a thing. Ever.
-But he is a hero who would have done anything for his family. For his son. Mine wouldn’t,-it felt like Draco’s words were supposed to be drenched in sarcasm, but they weren’t. At all,-Forget it. I don’t know why I just told all of this. Thanks for the eye,-Draco started getting up, but Harry made a risky move and grabbed his hand.
-Is this why we went down here? An old cigarette?-Draco asked, but he wasn’t mad. Not at her. Harry already started making up excuses and apologies for god knows what – he didn’t want the night to be ruined with a fight over nothing.
-How do you know he wasn’t forced into accepting it? How do you know it was his intention?-Harry asked. Draco had a thought that he had accidentally fallen asleep and this is all a dream. A weird embarrassing dream where Harry Potter chimes in and saves him, defends him in the court in front of 50 people who loathe him, makes everything right again.
Draco whispered a secret password into the door and it opened, revealing a long hall with many many doors by both sides of it. Following Malfoy in, Harry felt weird case of déjà vu. This place reminded him of an orphanage from Tom Riddle’s memories. It was much lighter and more welcoming, but still, it was a sad place. One that presumably pushed little Tom over the edge of madness. One Harry himself could have ended up in. He wondered if living there was better than with Dursleys.
He fell off the broom. Fortunately, the height wasn’t big enough for him to get hurt. By the time Harry landed next Draco, Malfoy was shockingly starring at the round object in his hand.
-It can’t be,-Draco stormed away. He pushed his way through the crowd and Harry had nothing better to do than follow him. Draco, being a little (not a little) taller, could at least see where he was going; Potter, meanwhile, just tried to keep his eyes on Malfoy’s back while it kept getting farther and farther. They crossed half of the hall until Draco stopped and knocked on a shoulder of some girl who wasn’t even facing him.
-Then what were you doing yesterday? And almost every weekend before that?-Draco hesitated to answer. Harry nodded and turned to his book. He still felt angry from being lied to, but now he was much sadder.
-I think he is afraid of her,-Draco did look very uncomfortable. And getting a password out of her really took a while. After two more minutes Astoria finally set him free and run to the stairs. Harry and Pansy hid in the corner when she passed them, but still heard her happy chuckles
Ron actually had his own issues to focus on. He saw this Ball as his chance to “redeem” himself in a few different spheres. First of all, fashion-vise. Ron still had nightmares concerning those robes he had to wear on Yule Ball in 4
-N-nothing,-Harry answered,-I just came here,-Draco sighed and went back to the common room. Harry followed him and closed the door after them. The fireplace was slowly going out, Draco sat down on the couch closest to the window.
Harry reached the common room faster than Draco did. The match was two hours away, the crowd started slowly gathering on the field as Hufflepuffs had their one last training. Tense atmosphere took over Hogwarts. Tense, but exciting.
-Because first of all, it’s not like there is much going on in your life. Or in mine,-Draco looked down for a second,-And second of all, I don’t believe you can just hand this position to me. Not when we both now you’re equally as good, if not better,-Harry offered Malfoy his hand,-So? Are you in?
-I’m not in a mood,-Harry didn’t know whether he should just drop it, or keep pushing Draco. Either way, he couldn’t just leave him alone.
-Are you okay?-Harry asked. Malfoy nodded, looking anything but okay. A nightmare, classic post war symptom. Harry gets them too,-Bad dream?
-Right…-Pansy was clearly entitled to her own opinion regrading the case,-Still a progress. Hey, Potter,-she nodded at him.
-Harry, dear, it’s been a pleasure to have you here,-Harry blushed slightly. She reminded him of Molly Weasley. Strict and demanding to her own children, and endlessly kind to Harry.
Seconds lasted like hours. Draco was physically shaking, yet just the presence of calm and tough Potter made him feel better. Made him feel protected. He looked at him and back at Kingsley.
-I look like a peacock,-Draco mumbled, looking at his own clothes with disgust. The brightness of yellow and blue pissed him off, and wearing a Gryffindor house color was almost insulting.
-Of course,-he bowed down again and went into the living room with Harry. Potter, who heard every bit of that conversation felt like he was about to explode.
-Why not?-Ron grabbed a fork and started stuffing his mouth with food, still talking and not even noticing that anything was wrong,-You were a good captain back then, you were just…distracted,-Hermione nodded, but decided not to add whatever was on her mind. When Ron and Harry talked about Quidditch, she tried not to interfere. She considered those conversation boring and pointless.
-My school won’t be over for a very long time, Lucy,-he said, knowing too well it wasn’t good enough of an excuse to her.
-It’s just 10 points,-Harry said, but started getting nervous too. Slughorn took the mic away from Luna, who kept talking about the uniform of the players, and announced the score.
-I wouldn’t be so sure. He was a Death Eater, he almost killed…Dumbledore,-even after more than a year, it was hard to talk about that loss. It will always be.
Almost 6 hours of dreamless sleep didn’t help Harry’s anger wear off. He woke up feeling just as annoyed as the previous night and got off the bed only after the dorm deserted.
Though the four of them now sat together in the Great Hall (and at most of the classes), it was still hard to say that the trio expanded into a quartet. Draco still had his…tendencies. Like disappearing after 9 pm and coming into the dorm well after the midnight. Or vanishing for a couple hours after the classes were over, sometimes missing the dinner too. Or even leaving Hogwarts for most of the weekends. Well, Harry could only assume he left Hogwarts, since he couldn’t be found on the Marauders’ map. Not that he was stalking him, no.
Just the fact that Harry had spent some time actually talking to Malfoy was enough to shock Ron to his core. Weasley kept asking what they were talking about and why, and how come the conversation ended with them shaking hands, cheering and smiling to each other, instead of turning the entire Three Broomsticks into a war zone. Harry just kept shrugging and making jokes. Something in him, something he wasn't yet ready to address, didn’t let him reveal their conversation to his friends, as innocent as it was. Hermione gave Potter her usual all-knowing, all-understanding glance and didn’t ask a thing. Harry didn’t even know whose reaction concerned him more.
-Of course I like you,-Harry said, which was god’s truth. Still, he felt very uncomfortable talking about his feelings. Especially with the third party present,-But…
-Okay,-Harry said. It’s not that he was afraid of this conversation (and he already knew what kind of conversation it was). He just wanted to postpone it as much as he could. Maybe if they don’t rush with it, Harry will figure out what was going on inside of him. Ginny had every right for clarity. Harry just…didn’t have it yet.
-Are you leaving?-he asked. Malfoy just froze for a second. He opened his mouth to say something and closed it again,-Are you? Letting her take you away?
-Could be cheating,-the whole room turned towards the voice. Zacharias Smith and Michael Harris stood side by side, both sober, both not very welcomed here.
-Why would I be mad? You saved someone, isn’t it just something that you do?-she smiled. Harry did too. He immediately felt lighter.
-How did it go?-Harry asked when Ron approached him. Weasley was rather surprised to find him in such weird company, but decided not to act on it.
-Yeah, I know. Did I say Ginny? I meant Luna,-Draco actively shook his head, but it was too late. Hazel knew he was lying.
-Sure, if you’re such a billionaire to buy clothes that won’t fit,-Ron said, searching through the same suits they just examined. Harry looked around in discomfort
-Right,-Draco agreed, but his face, his posture, his eyes, all contradicted his words,-Pans, are you done?-he raised his voice for Pansy to hear. Harry had never regretted not lying that much.
-I don’t even know,-Ron scoffed too, though he still had no idea what they were laughing about. There was still at least 40 minutes till the Ball, but surprisingly, Ron didn’t feel nervous at all. He was a little excited – as excited as you can be for lame school dances – but mostly calm. He wished he could say that about Harry though.
Molly had been cleaning and cooking for days and the guests were met with the familiar smell of delicious meals and deserts, mixed with usual, but unidentifiable smell that house always had. A smell of home, of sun, of love. Harry led as he walked into the house. Last summer had changed his life so much – it changed him – but The Burrow didn’t seem to change at all. It stood tall as a symbol of a home Harry thought he never had, but actually always did. The small rooms, low ceilings, narrow halls – all was so familiar and full of memories. The bittersweet feeling of nostalgia filled Harry completely.
-Of course it’s true,-Ron groaned but quickly calmed down once he saw Draco walking by,-I can’t even handle this stupid ferret!-he whispered once Draco was far enough. Harry smiled.
-I didn’t know about that…but I assure you, even Mister Potter wouldn’t have enough power to affect minister’s decision if you were truly guilty,-she said,-If Potter really helped you, it’s great. But it doesn’t mean that you “cheated” or that you don’t deserve your freedom. You do.
I think I'll update this series every other day, but more comments and kudos may make me reconsider and post every day!
Draco groaned, but quickly caught Astoria before she could reach the stairs. He smiled to her, but Harry couldn’t hear their conversation.
-Well, I wish I could say it was the first time I heard that,-the binder closed and Harry immediately felt more free and light,-Mister Potter, future profession is an extremely important decision. However, it doesn’t mean that you have to get it right on your first try.
Once the Hogwarts sank into the darkness and silence of the night, Harry finally laid down in his warm soft bed, hopeful to fall asleep right away. The night had other plans, and Potter stayed up for quite some time then. The day full of events flew in front of his eyes. He wondered how the hell he managed to miss that snitch. He had every opportunity to catch it, for years he considered himself a good Seeker - better than Malfoy – and a couple years ago even a thought of such scenario would’ve been insulting. But when his fancy broom was gone and the entire school wasn’t cheering for him, Potter lost. For 6 years Quidditch had been an integral part of his school life, now it was gone. It was a weird realization. But what surprised Harry more is that he wasn’t even that upset.
-What happened to your face?-Harry asked, resisting a strong urge to touch his cheek. Especially, the dark purplish-green spot right under his eye.
-It’s not exactly a secret,-Harry started, trying to speed up,-I mean, it’s not only my secret. That’s why I couldn’t tell anyone.
-Changed your mind on what?-Harry closed his eyes and sighed as he heard Ron’s voice. He threw one helpless look at Draco before turning to face Weasley.
-Oh, yes, absolutely. Very insulted,-Draco said, hiding a smile and hoping Walburga doesn’t sense his sarcasm.
-Why didn’t you come back then?-Pansy immediately looked at Harry. Just for a second, but it was noticeable. And Harry realized that the truth wasn’t for his ears.
-Yes?-his eyes were red, so was almost his whole face. Cold, or tears, Harry couldn’t tell. Probably both.
The excitement of the first Quidditch game of the season brought its fair share of stress and nerves too. Mostly to Ron Weasley. And with nerves, the realization of how much he needed Harry’s support came too. It was his first game as the captain, he had no right to mess this up. He had to win, to establish himself as a good captain, to make the team believe in themselves, to prove himself capable of doing this. Ron looked at his team, a group full of talented people who would rather die than miss an opportunity to start a fight with each other and just hoped that they would take that passion and bring it to the field.
-I mean here. Are you still not talking to Weasley?-Draco seemed genuinely surprised by that thought. In his mind, a conflict like that would be resolved in a minute, especially between two best friends.
-I have an idea!-Harry tried to think of a proper way to express his thoughts, and while he was doing that (which always took him a while), Draco jumped off his seat. Dozens of heads turned to him, but Malfoy was starring at the letter in his hands.
-Yeah and who’s fault is that?-Draco mumbled “whatever” and sat down on one of the chairs. Harry was standing beside the fridge. A still empty fridge.
Harry didn’t feel bad spending so much money on clothes. It was one of the first pieces of clothing he bought for himself, by himself because he wanted it. And he was glad that exactly that suit happened to be his (almost) first purchase.
-On the lips?-Harry groaned and Granger accepted it as a positive answer,-Well, it’s…,-she started saying something, but actually had no idea where she was going with that sentence. It was one of those rare cases where Hermione Granger didn’t know what to say. But Ron Weasley did.
With a quiet sigh he pointed his wand at it and whispered the sacred words. A very detailed map of Hogwarts opened up in front of him. He saw himself, saw Ron surrounded by Hermione, Dean and some Hufflepuff student in the common room. He kept looking until his eyes stumbled on Malfoy’s name. Draco was in boys’ bathroom, just like Harry expected. The problem is, he wasn’t alone. In concerning proximity to him there were 4 ex-Ravenclaw students, now their course-mates. And during those 10 seconds it took Harry to correlate their names with their faces, he remembered the fact that made him jump from his bed, throw on the invisibility cloak and run to the said bathroom.
-Still, this year is not going to be any fun for him,-Ron said, sighing. Yet, that thought didn’t seem to upset him much
Actually, Harry wondered if those people had changed and how. He imagined how Hogwarts would greet him just in couple hours and how people would look at him. He didn’t want any praise, he just hoped that the warm feeling of being home Harry had every time he had crossed Hogwarts doors wouldn’t disappear.
Headmistress McGonagall volunteered to host the sessions for most of the 8th graders, especially those she taught herself during their last years in Hogwarts. Every student had been given their own time to approach her office, each session was supposed to take less than half an hour and students were advised to at least try to prepare some ideas and plans for their future, just something to start with. Harry had no idea what he was going to talk about.
-Mister Potter,-McGonagall started and Harry thought that they had crossed the “last names” base a long ago,-How are you feeling? You seem tense.
Making his way to the Great Hall, Harry tried his best to avoid all morning people eager to have the most meaningless small talk with him, but the person he really didn’t want to run into was Ron. Weasley though, as if nothing happened, was talking to some younger Gryffindors over the breakfast, sitting on his usual place. Harry’s seat was empty, yet it didn’t look very welcoming. Potter froze in the very entrance of the Great Hall, looked over his table and if it wasn’t for his empty stomach making resisting sound, he would have turned around and went back to bed for his well-deserved extra 20 minutes of sleep.
-Leave me alone and find another charity case, okay?-before the meaning of his words could reach Harry, Malfoy knocked his shoulder with his and walked by. He grabbed an apple from the table and quickly rushed to the class. In a couple seconds, Harry went there too.
-Mate? You’re done?-Ron woke Harry up from his thoughts. He quickly got dressed and went out to let Weasley see the suit
-Mister Malfoy?-Draco was so deep in his thoughts that for a second he even forgot where he was. He looked up and his eyes met McGonagall’s careful glance, full of concern and a little bit of fear.
-Are you spying on me again, Potter? Hadn’t dropped your heroic tendencies yet?,-he said to Harry, and Potter knew it was the closest thing he’d get to a thank you,-I don’t like it when they’re directed at me.
-Ron, no! Just…no! Shut up!-Harry said way louder than he wanted to,-It was just…a heat of the moment! I wasn’t thinking straight.
-I can handle a no from you, you know? I’ve done it before,-Ginny said and a sad smile bloomed on her beautiful lips. Harry felt like an idiot. An idiot who was breaking the heart of the most perfect girl he had ever met, a girl he definitely didn’t deserve.
-What?-all three of them wanted to take this conversation inside, into the warmth of Hogwarts, but all three of them also knew that the chatter and stares of curious students would ruin the atmosphere and Harry wouldn’t say a word.
-Someone testified for him,-Hermione, who always knew more than everyone else, said,-But the trail was closed and that person requested to remain anonymous.
-Don’t you understand? I’m not actually free and probably will never be. I’ll always be one fight away from an Azkaban cell,-Draco got up too,-One conflict, one complain about me, and all your efforts will be a waste! That’s why I can’t fight back! That’s why I let Harris and his idiots do whatever they want to me! That’s why I want to leave this damn place more than anything!-by the time Draco finished, he already regretting saying so much. And Harry was starring at him in shock. He never even thought of it all this way.
-I don’t even know what that means,-Harry started approaching him. A slight smile started blooming on his face,-But I want to be your friend. And I can’t stand seeing my friends being treated like that.
-Malfoy?-Hermione asked finally. Harry couldn’t force himself to say anything, so he nodded instead.
-A direct order from Headmistress. I am sure she will be more than happy with the results,-knight answered gladly. He obviously took all the credit for the way things turned out; two known “enemies” sharing a dorm.
The conversation went slowly from that note and Harry already regretted asking about his family. Draco was deep in his thoughts, and judging by his face, they weren’t light and happy. But! He seemed to have liked the pizza. The coke remained untouched though and from time to time Draco looked at the glass of black sparkling liquid with doubt and suspect in his eyes.
-Mister Malfoy, Mister Potter, if you don’t pay attention to the class, at least don’t distract others,- professor Binns interrupted them.
-Are you okay, mate? You look…freaked out…,-Harry considered telling his friends about what just happened a very, very bad idea. Especially to Ron. Ron who didn’t talk to him for weeks because Malfoy was the first to find out about Harry’s plans for future. Ron who still didn’t know that Harry went out of his way to set Malfoy free that summer. Ron who still hated Draco and probably had a reason to. There was no way he would approve of what Harry had done. There was no way anyone would. What was he even thinking?
-At the orphanage! Okay? You heard me now?-Harry was, to say the least, shocked. Not just by Draco’s “secret”, but by the way he acted now. He looked embarrassed, shy. It was definitely a new look on Malfoy.
-But I can wait! You just have to promise you won’t leave me here,-she was getting more upset with every second. Analise’s eyes got teary too.
Draco and Harry didn’t talk anymore. They just stood beside each other and waited for Ron to come out. And once he did, holding a “Auror: the most important job in the Wizarding World” brochure, Draco smirked and threw a weird glance at Potter. Harry looked at him with a plea/threat in his eyes, hoping Draco would get it and not open his mouth.
-Oh, really? Were you expecting anyone? A date?-Harry gasped, but Draco just rolled his eyes. Potter called for a waitress and ordered two more glasses of butterbeer, ignoring Draco’s rejections.
-There,-Harry went with the safest option and gave Ron the most classic black tux with a black tie. Ron quickly tried it on and opened the curtain, piercing Harry with very unsatisfied glance.
-Granger...,-For a second Draco imagined blushing Harry swearing to Hermione that it wasn't what she thought it was and that he still hates Draco. That picture hurt even more than a fact that in couple minutes life will get them apart again.
-Draco, wait!-he lost. Malfoy turned around and saw Potter rushing to him and wrapping his arms around his neck. Draco was too shocked to do anything first, but soon he hugged Harry too. They both closed their eyes, pretending that this last little hug will be enough for them.
-Most likely,-they both knew it was the last time. The end of friendship that never started. The finale of the relationship that was never meant to be. But in the end, of course it was.
-Something? No,-Ron dragged him by his hand back into the store. The saleswoman smiled, but inside she was counting minutes until the end of her shift.
-Yes and no,-Pansy said,-I just miss this place. Can you believe that? I miss the school,- Draco smiled understandingly,-We hated it here! And now I miss it!
Harry stopped to catch a breath before entering the common room when he heard voices coming out from the closed door. There were two people talking, one of them was Malfoy, the other was some woman Harry couldn’t yet recognize.
-Hi, Harry,-Ron was adorably oblivious. He was writing his homework right at the breakfast table, which Hermione never approved of, but the deeper they got into the year, the harder it was to keep up with their studies. Right before the graduation all 8
-Good,-she said,-I always say, all people’s problems come from the loneliness. Everyone deserves a friend,-Molly smiled and Harry smiled even brighter.  He accepted another mug from her, gathering all his courage to finally say what he wanted to say.
Draco apologized about being late again and finally took Lucy to the other children, to canteen, leaving Madam Polkinghorne complaining. Lucy didn’t want to sit with them and or participate in any conversations. Instead, she chose to stay with Draco and Harry. With time her morning hysteria wore off and she was happy and talkative again, asking them about what they did yesterday and absolutely ignoring any other kids. Harry could assume that she was still a little upset and felt safer next to “adults”, but since the same situation happened yesterday, he started seeing a pattern there. And it concerned him.
-Court calls for witness on Mr. Malfoy’s side,-Draco looked up as he heard Kingsley. He didn’t have a witness, he didn’t have anyone to stand up for him.
The day ended surprisingly quickly, but was so bright and full of events that neither Harry nor Draco even noticed how children’s bed time approached. They played with kids all day, helped feed them, tried teaching them some basic skills like reading or elementary math, but that didn’t go well. (Draco also found out how ridiculously bad Harry was at math and definitely didn’t let that go unnoticed). Lucy hadn’t let go of Draco since the moment she woke up. The kids who weren’t as welcoming to Draco just ignored him and gave all their attention to Harry. He really was the star of the day. No one could believe The Harry Potter had come to their orphanage. Harry tried to answer to their questions, but they were truly endless. Some children didn’t ask anything though. They looked at Potter with something close to fear in their eyes. And it was absolutely heart-breaking for Harry to see it, the whole day was rather sad, but some of the parents of these kids died fighting, trying to help Harry. Which made him feel responsible for their deaths.
-Congratulations, Ron,-he said, stretching out his hand for a handshake. Ron looked at it and pulled him into a hug. Harry chuckled and felt like his heart could have exploded from the happiness he felt that day.
-I’m calm, Harry,-Ron said. He wasn’t,-I honestly don’t care that you decided not to be an auror. It’s your life, mate. I just don’t understand why you were lying to me. Why does Malfoy deserve to know and I don’t?
Lucy had asked that question before. Only once. Draco tried to distract her then and didn’t answer it. Of course, he didn’t want her to grow up in this place, but her chances for adoption were rather small – people tend to go for younger children – and Draco himself had so many problems to go through, not to mention his reputation. There was only so much he could do to help her and chances are, nothing wasn’t going to change. And now, she asked him again and he still didn’t have an answer she wanted.
-You don’t even know how they make it?-Draco asked. Harry nodded, not seeing any problem about it,-You are adorably trusting to muggles and what they…create.
-For your information,-Ron said,-Me and Harry were already offered to join Aurors Academy. Even without graduating,-Weasley was pretty pleased with himself and smiled at Harry. Potter quickly nodded and tried to smile back. He didn’t know how to tell Ron that the thought of becoming an auror didn’t attract him that much anymore.
-Harry, Ginny’s with Luna. She’s moved on. And I’m happy for her. All I want for you is to be happy too. Even if it’s with the ferret,-Hermione kicked him with her shoe and Ron sighed,-I don’t hate him, okay? I admit, he got better. Don’t count me as his fans though and I still can’t tell what you found in him, but…,-another kick from Hermione,-I wasn’t finished! But…if he makes you happy, I’m happy too.
-She has a better broom!-Harry exclaimed,-Hers is faster, it’s not fair! Luna!-Harry even got on his feet and started calling for the commentators,-Luna! Professor!
-Hermione is probably looking for you already,-he said awkwardly. Ron, still shocked, left. Harry sighed with relief mixed with a little bit of embarrassment. He had no idea what Ron must’ve been thinking. He didn’t even know what he was thinking when he decided to stay and wait for Draco. Just another stupid impulse he followed.
Harry silently prepared two cups of coffee and put one in front of Draco. The sound of cup touching the surface woke him up, along with the smell of it. Draco wiped his eyes, looked at Harry and wondered how he managed to look be this chipper.
I wasn't sure if it was appropriate for me to post anything now, when everyone's attention should be directed towards something way more important. This update in no way disrespects POC community.
Harry also started coming to his Quidditch training sessions. Thankfully, he had a solid cover through Ron. He could tell he was there to support his friend. Or to help him, he knew what it’s like to be a captain. His actual motives were a little more complicated. He came to steal a couple of minutes before they’d start to wish Malfoy luck, just to get a confused nod from him. Or to at least try to stop those endless fights and conflicts. He never jumped to defend Malfoy though, even if he wanted to. He knew how Draco would react, more importantly he knew how the rest of the team would react. It would only cause more problems.
The Saturday before Quidditch auditions that ex-Gryffindor trio decided to spend in Hogsmeade promised to be bright. There was a lot to discuss, even except for Ron’s favorite topic, Quidditch. Headmistress just announced that there would be a Ball right before Christmas break. A Ball. Again. Harry could have sworn that he heard the whole school groan once McGonagall told them about it. She said it would be useful for students to have a little fun, a little celebration after the war. Harry thought it was an unnecessary reminder of two things. First, the said war. Second, Harry has no one to invite.
-Yeah…Yes, yes, of course!-Harry sat up and said,-We are together…going together, I mean!-he corrected himself,-It’s true, yes.
Once Harry stepped into the class – 5 minutes late, but it’s the History of Magic, so who cares – he was facing the exact same problem as earlier this morning. Normally, he sat right behind Ron and Hermione during the classes. This way they were still technically sitting together, and also Hermione with her hair and Ron with his abnormal height could hide sleeping Harry from the professor.
-I know,-Harry took his hand. A bold move that Harry felt was necessary now,-But…It will get better for her, eventually. As an orphan myself, I can say that,-Potter smiled, hoping to get a smile from Draco. And he did. A small one with Malfoy’s eyes glued to the ground, but it was still a smile,-Also, she is very lucky to have a friend now. One friend can change more than you think.
-But how will Master Potter manage the house by himself? Should Kreacher remind Master Potter of a time he had tried to cook a meal?-he asked.
-You spent the whole dinner yesterday discussing the color of your bow tie,-Harry sighed. Now he was almost sure that Draco wouldn’t show up. And it upset him, but at the same time it was a relief. His nerves had been killing him for a week before the Ball, and maybe it would be for the best if he spends it with his friends. As a third wheel. Again.
-Yeah, right. Open up!-Draco mumbled the password and the door opened. Slytherin common room was completely empty, not a soul except for them. Harry carefully walked in. He hardly remembered it since the last and only time he had been there, but now he really saw beauty in it. Soft light, dark colors everywhere, many and many bookshelves, a fireplace and…windows! Windows looked at the lake! Harry gasped when a big colorful fish swam past the window.
Harry had to admit. Learning Potions with Draco was way easier, more effective and even pleasant than with Slughorn. He didn’t rush and yell as Harry thought he would, he explained everything Harry didn’t understand, which was…a lot and he wasn’t really surprised when Harry asked him questions about the most trivial things, yet didn’t show it. In a couple hours Draco got Harry all caught up on what they were studying and for the first time since he had gotten rid of the Half Blood Prince’s textbook, Potter was actually excited to step into the Potions class.
-Mister Malfoy, as I recall your favorite subject used to be potions?-she asked in a very casual tone. Draco finally looked at her and nodded,-What do you think about trying to become a healer?
All Draco’s advantage disappeared; Dora reached him surprisingly quickly. Now they flew shoulder to shoulder. Williams had her arm stretched out to grab the snitch as soon as she gets a chance to. Draco tried to overtake her, but his broom really was a lot older and slower.
The confession was met with complete silence. Harry still had his eyes closed and couldn’t see the faces of his friends, but was sure that they definitely looked straight at each other and Ron probably had to resist an urge to throw up.
-You’ve been together for two days somewhere else, what was I supposed to think?-Harry could only hope that Draco wouldn’t point out that it actually shouldn’t have bothered him at all.
-Parkinson!-the girl who turned out to be Pansy Parkinson looked at Draco with a gasp and immediately jumped into his arms. She chuckled as he hugged her, raising her from the ground. Draco too looked rather content. Way happier than with Harry.
-Oh,-the girl already calmed down, more or less, and now was lying in Draco’s arms as he stroked her back and whispered apologies.
She physically didn’t let go of Malfoy till the end of the day. Even when he had to go to the bathroom, she started crying and asking to take her with him. And what at first seemed cute, now was worrying. Harry had no idea how Madam Polkinghorne handles Lucy on the weekdays, when Draco is at Hogwarts. And how Draco just walks by his day, knowing that this girl here probably thinks that he had betrayed her.
-Not sure yet,-Draco finally looked at Harry just to see him staring at the lake,-I was thinking about becoming a healer. Maybe.
-There’s nothing to save, Draco,-Narcissa cut off her son. Him mentioning the Manor seemed to have woken her up. Draco’s mother now sounded firm and strict.
All Draco’s attempts to save himself were small and pathetic. He tried to make them understand why he did what he did, told them all about the threats and dangers that Voldemort promised, told them about tortures and everything that went down in Malfoy Manor over that summer. He really tried to make one himself heard, to make one thought realized by everyone present. He didn’t have a choice. Not really, not ever. But faces of people who were about to decide Draco’s entire life remained indifferent, with a splash of disgust.
-Please don’t make it long,-Hooch asked. The snitch flew up into the sky. Two pairs of eyes followed it. Draco already looked fresh, sober, ready to fight. It made Harry smile.
It’s unlikely that it was an accident, but according to their schedule, Hermione, Ron and Harry went one after another, and as soon as their actual classes ended (academic aspect of that year was so simple and primitive that Hermione considered going up to McGonagall specifically to talk about that, but Ron convinced her to enjoy the simple life), three of them headed to the Headmistress’s office. Harry was visibly nervous and did his best to avoid any conversation. He had an idea on what kind of questions he will be asked - they had similar sessions back in 5th year - but didn’t know any answers. Back then McGonagall made a very dramatic and heartfelt promise to do everything she could to make Harry an auror. Is he about to disappoint her too?
Together they stepped into the beautifully decorated hall. It was very crowded, but unlike all the scenarios Harry had imagined, no one looked at them. People were too busy dancing and talking to notice two boys who decided to come together. Even if one of them was the chosen one.
-Where’s your date?-Hermione asked Harry as they walked out of the common room and headed towards the Great Hall. Dozens of teenagers in robes and shiny dresses passed them.
-Nothing!-Draco looked around to make sure no one had heard the nonsense out of Potter’s lips,-I already told you!
-Hi, Harry,-Ginny smiled and nodded at a place next to her. Her voice sounded calm and friendly,-Are you free now?
-Oh, how I wish it was your family that inherited the house, dear Draco. I am sure you are as insulted as I am to see who is of possession of it now,-she said, looking at Harry.
-Is there a Quidditch training today?-Harry asked, ignoring Draco’s question completely. Malfoy didn’t pressure him and nodded at his question,-And when’s the game?
After a minute of waiting, a short woman walked out of one of the doors. She gasped and smiled as soon as she saw Draco.
-No, close your eyes!-he commanded, Draco complied,-Not with a bruise…So…broken? Defeated, in a way,-Harry expected a punch coming after his words, but Draco didn’t touch him. He didn’t even say anything for a while
Harry looked at Ron. Not hiding it, not even trying to make it subtle. Watched him laugh and smile, and frustrations grew inside of him. It was like a tradition of its kind, every year something just HAD TO happen to drive the trio apart. Any little thing could grow into a huge drama that would last for weeks. Weeks of complete avoidance, of angry glances, of heartache.
Harry could tell McGonagall already knew she was wrong. There was something about her smile that calmed Harry down. At least a little.
-I don’t like being lied to. And I don’t like being anyone’s second choice. Especially after Malfoy. You decided to switch sides now?,-for a second Harry just couldn’t believe what Ron just said.
-Potter, I don’t care, okay?! Leave me alone,-Draco spat out. Harry took a deep breath, got up and sat next to Malfoy.
-Because my parents are dead because of you and people like you. You all deserve to rot in Azkaban!,-he raised his fist for another punch, but before it could meet Draco’s face, Harry pushed the door open, throwing the cloak off beforehand.
I had a lot of plans for this fic and this chapter was not supposed to be final - and hopefully it won't be. Either way, thank you so much for reading, would be pretty cool if you left kudos or comments.
-Why can’t you just believe my words? I’m not doing anything “bad” and I’m not dating Luna,-he groaned.
Harry and Hermione watched Slughorn and Luna from time to time. Slytherin’s new Head of The House looked at the clock and at the score table. His intentions were clear.
-But you meant it. And you didn’t really lie,-Draco said. And Harry thought that his relationship with his father could have been way more complex than he ever thought.
-Well. Welcome back, I wish you a good year. Your first password is “Concordia”,-she said and walked away. Harry heard Hermione’s whispers to Ron that “Concordia, actually, means Harmony” and Ron’s pretty fake but pretty adorable gasp.
Harry watched as Draco put Lucy into her bed and checked other kids. To be honest, even after spending a day there with him, it still amazed Harry that Draco was actually doing this. Spending last bits of his free time with these children, not expecting anything in return. It went against everything Harry thought he knew about Malfoy, about Slytherins. And even if he was doing it just to calm his conscience down, it didn’t change anything. Draco was doing something significant, something that mattered, and didn’t tell a soul about it.
The door closed after Hermione and it was just Ron and Harry. There were a few other students, who decided that it’s better to be early than late. Harry wondered if Ron felt as awkward as he did. The second he was about to open his mouth and try to get rid of that awkwardness at least somehow, Draco Malfoy appeared out of nowhere. He saw Ron and Harry and stopped at considerable distance from them. Harry gave him a hardly noticeable smile. Draco returned even a less noticeable nod.
-Shrong will show him around,-Madam Polkinghorne said and two elves walked away, both mumbling something.
-I…I didn’t know you’d…,-Draco sighed and ordered his brain to start working on producing actual sentences, but it didn’t comply,-Thank you,-he breathed out.
-Of course I’ll be your friend, Potter,-Ginny smiled and her smile really seemed to be sincere. She reached to hug Harry, and that hug really set him free. It took off another pile of pressure off of his chest. Potter almost felt like he could fly.
-I truly don’t want you to give up on yourself, Draco. It would be such a loss,-with pouted lips, Draco was starring at his own hands,-You have been proven innocent, legally no one can use your past against you.
Draco isn't doing much better, as you can see, there's just some more hidden aggression + fear + insecurities and good old internalized homophobia <3
-It’s not. And I’m gonna prove you wrong,-Harry said, grabbing his jacket off of the couch. The very expansive, very old couch that stood there for years.
-Very observant, Potter,-Draco got up and walked out of the dorm, not looking back. Harry saw him out. Without realizing it, he waited for Draco to come back. A minute turned into 5. Then into 10 and 15. When 20 minutes had passed, Harry started getting not worried, but a little concerned. He decided to give Malfoy 5 more minutes to get back. But when they passed and his bed remained empty, Harry got up, opened his messed-up luggage and almost at the bottom of it found the Marauder’s Map.
-I…,-Harry felt like he didn’t recognize the person in front of him. But in a good way,-Draco, it’s amaz…
-Can you even imagine their faces if we actually show up on the ball together?-Harry didn’t specify who “they” were. In fact, he looked so carried away and excited by his own idea that Draco started feeling a little weird.
-Stop being so grumpy, you’ve missed this!-she said, raising her hands. Draco agreed, but didn’t plan to show it,-I’ll be right back,-Pansy disappeared in girls’ dorm, finally leaving Draco and Harry alone.
-Finally!-Molly hugged every single one of them before letting them in. Ginny held Luna’s hand and was quite nervous to introduce her to her mother – in a letter Ginny only mentioned she was bringing in a friend. But when Ginny said who Luna actually was (and Ron stood right beside her, ready to take her side if anything bad happen), Molly’s reaction to her was only a shock about how skinny Luna was and a promise to feed her at least 6 times a day as long as they were there. But after Ginny’s sight of relief, and Ron’s laughter, Molly hugged Luna and said how happy she was for them. Then she gave a bittersweet smile to Harry, who returned it, but without a shadow of sadness.
-Of course. Ask Mister Malfoy to come in next,-Harry nodded and rushed to the door, but once he almost reached it, he stopped.
-Okay. Good night,-Draco nodded and after another second full of doubts, Harry turned around and went upstairs.
-It was amazing, oh my God,-he kept laughing, already gaining strict glances from Madam Pince,-You just saved my life, Malfoy.
But was he disappointed? A little. Concerned? Yeah…He couldn’t help it. He saw that happiness and relief on Draco’s face once Kingsley told him he was free. Malfoy looked as if the world was laying in front of his feet and he didn’t even have to reach to grab whatever he wanted. Harry just wanted him to look like that again. He wanted everyone who fought through this horror, who sacrificed their childhood to feel this way. Harry Potter was ready to die just so other people would get their second chances, including those people who made terrible mistakes, but deep inside regretted them and wanted to be better. Especially those people.
Till the rest of the day Harry kept guessing and building theories on what could have taken up Malfoy’s weekends. He couldn’t focus during the classes, and hardly paid attention to Ron and Hermione during the lunch. But as soon as the last class finished, he grabbed all his things and ran to the library, determined to finally find out the truth.
Thankfully, everything went fine. When Draco opened his eyes, they were already standing in front of a rather small building, not far from the Diagon Alley. Only a few people, rushing to their work, were around, besides that – same silence.
-Don’t believe him, believe me. I know it wasn’t his intention,-Harry said and for a second put his hand on Draco’s shoulder.
-Why do you even need to ask her?-Harry wondered, going through endless shirts and trousers offered at the stores. They declined the help of the saleswoman and decided to find everything themselves,-If you’re already dating. She wouldn’t go with anyone else, would she?
-Harry, it’s okay,-his friends approached him. Hermione hugged him by the waist and Ron put his hand on his shoulder,-It’s okay if you like him. Really,-Ron said.
Two doors in the opposite sides of the common room led to girl’s and boy’s dorms. Ron made another joke saying that they could have them not separated, earning supporting chuckle from some boys and nothing but rolled eyes from girls, including Hermione.
-Sure,-he kept applying the paste, taking his time and feeling Draco’s pale, almost transparent skin under his very fingertips. Just a thought that Draco allowed it mesmerized him,-So someone slipped you a Boxing Telescope. Who?
-Potter!-in surprise Draco raised his head and revealed what Harry thought he saw a few seconds ago.
And while Ron was enthusiastically listing all the pros of being an auror, Harry tried to find a way to express all his feelings in words and deliver them to his best friend. He will understand, eventually, but Harry couldn’t - didn’t want to -  see that look of disappointment, even if it will only be there for a second. Instead, he kept nodding and agreeing, hating himself for his cowardice. Defeat Voldemort? Sure. Crash your friend’s dreams to study together again? Ugh…
-Shut up,-Harry smiled,-Write to your mother now. Tell her you’ll stay and you’ll figure everything out.
Draco walked around the halls, noticing little details about it that stayed in his memory through all these years. There wasn’t much, just blurry images in his head, fractions of real memories. But Draco did feel nostalgic being there. He missed the times when his happiness was obvious and real.
-You did it!-Harry fell on the grass next to Draco and chuckled. He was even happier than how he would have been If it was him holding a snitch right now.
-Good,-Harry said. He tried not to think about it, but he had to admit, it was kind of sad parting with Kreacher. Harry had grown used to him.
-Still, it is important,-Hermione said and started listing all the reasons why without Hogwarts diploma their lives would fall apart and in what ways. Harry wasn’t really listening, instead he studied his window view. Ron just liked hearing his girlfriend talk about something she was passionate about.
Once the smell of delicious dishes Hogwarts offered for breakfast reached Harry’s nose, he smiled even brighter and walked to his table. Hermione was discussing something with Draco, who already took his seat next to Harry’s empty one.
-What if we talk to her?-Blaise asked,-These two will kill each other if you put them in the same room together.
-The same thing happened to half of the other Death Eaters. Or so they claim. How do you expect me to believe him?-Kingsley asked.
Harry meanwhile, was very glad it was Ron wearing captain’s mantle, not him. Knowing the stress and the pressure that captaincy brought firsthand, Harry didn’t really miss it. And he did wish he could be there for Ron, comfort and support him. But as soon as Harry finally decided to act on these feelings and make amends with Weasley, he’d inevitably do something to make him change his mind. And that circle didn’t seem to have an ending yet.
-I actually wanted to talk to you about something,-he started. Molly looked at him,-A few weeks ago I went to a…to an orphanage with Draco,-Harry looked away and pretended to be very invested in his dish-wiping duty. He waited for Molly to react and overall did his best to make it look as a casual conversation and not let his pounding heart and panicking brain be clear to the woman next to him.
-Him, of course!-she said, nodding at Draco,-How many times have I asked you not to be late?-she asked and then turned to Harry,-Poor Lucy always takes it personally, she thinks he had abandoned her.
-Do you promise? Draco?-she asked again. And again. Draco looked at Harry and at Madam Polkinghorne, looking for help, but what could they say? Harry felt especially helpless.
-When has it been like that?-Justin Finch-Fletchley asked. Harry was still convinced Justin didn’t like him that much.
Their new common room looked like a mix of all the old ones. It didn’t have one color or a theme. Some walls were bright yellow, others red or green. The ceiling and the floor were deep blue, there were numerous paintings (one of a very nervous man guarding them outside, whose voice broke once he asked McGonagall for the password) on the walls. Overall the room looked as an attempt to please everyone at the same time, or as Ron called it, Hogwarts in a nutshell.
-They wouldn’t have. I told them the same things you did, but no one cared. Ministry just couldn’t say no to you,-Draco had a point and Harry hated it.
-Oh, here’s the brush,-Ron handed it to Harry. Hermione looked at him with disbelief and probably some doubts regrading the reason why she started dating him,-What?
-Yeah, so how did it go? What did she say?-Harry was so desperately trying to switch the subject that Draco played along. But knowing that someone, no, not just someone, that Harry actually waited for him was...nice.
-Yes! In a few seconds the whole school will think we are going together!-Harry repeated. Draco looked at him the way people look at an insane person,-What do you say we give them a show?
-A fridge,-Harry mumbled, thinking about where he was going to get food. But Draco’s confused face told him that a word “fridge” meant absolutely nothing to him,-It’s like a…an ice box! It’s cold there and muggles use it to keep their food fresh.
-Well, if you know so much about me, I’m sure you already know who that mysterious stranger is,-Malfoy smirked again,-And if I’m so pathetic and weak, how come you need three of your buddies just to hold me back?-Draco’s words were met with a harsh, strong punch right into his stomach. Ravenclaws didn’t let him fall down, but his face twisted in pain. Dave Griffin, one of Michael’s friends, threw an unsure glance at him, but Harris was losing his temper with every second and didn’t notice it.
-I heard they let him go,-Harry said carefully. He hadn’t told anyone about his visit to Ministry of Magic during Malfoy’s trial and didn’t plan to.
-That is not my point. Draco was given a task and told that unless he completes it, he will die. How is it not clear that Voldemort forced him to do what he did?
Moly and Arthur insisted that no matter what kind of plans any of them have for the holidays, Christmas they will spend together. Just like every year. All older Weasley also promised to be there and it actually felt like a normal Christmas at the Burrow that had already become a tradition. Except it wasn’t a normal Christmas at all.
-They already get along just fine! Look at them!-at that exact moment, Ron was giving Malfoy a pat on the shoulder for another well-caught snitch. Harry would rather have them fight.
-I had a lot to do. Still have,-she said with a sad smile,-You also wouldn’t come back if you didn’t have to,-Draco shrugged. Harry ordered himself to stop taking things that hardly concerned him so personally. For a few more minutes they just stood there. Completely different thoughts crossing their minds. From time to time Pansy would say something, remind Draco of their collective memory or an inside joke, and Draco would laugh, or smile, or just nod sadly. Harry felt very, very out of place and weirdly lonely. And he still couldn’t tell why he didn’t just leave.
-You'd be a great one,-another conversation killer from Harry Potter. Malfoy had to use all courage he had to even go and meet Potter and he was talking about their future professions. It made Draco mad.
-You actually didn’t say a word about your own profession,-Draco said, a sly smirk playing on his lips.
Harry couldn’t think of anything better than waking up earlier and going up to Ravenclaw’s common room. Trying to be as quiet as possible and not wake up his sleeping dormmates, Harry walked out of his common room and headed to Ravenclaw’s. He wasn’t worrying about sounding insane to Luna. Of all people, she’d understand.
-What are you doing here?-Malfoy asked as Harry approached him. He looked pretty surprised to see Potter in the same hallway while he was supposed to be off with his friends.
-See? Manners pay off sometimes,-Harry rolled his eyes and headed to the kitchen. With all the work that had to get done in the orphanage that day, both of them completely forgot about eating. Harry hadn’t eaten anything since yesterday’s dinner and his stomach started reminding him about it.
Harry dressed up and waited for Draco in the kitchen. They agreed to head out to the orphanage at 7 am, but it was already half past seven and Draco still was in the bathroom. Harry spent considerable amount of time thinking about the last night incident before falling asleep; he was afraid Draco would be mad at him, offended possibly. But, to be honest, it was almost impossible to say if Malfoy was being rude to him because of yesterday, or because that’s just the way it was. Harry liked the second option more. Still, some share of awkwardness existed, and he didn’t like it.
But seriously, why didn’t you tell us you didn’t want to be an auror anymore?-Hermione asked after a pause.
And secondly, his date. Looking back, Weasley couldn’t believe he used to be THAT blind and stupid not to invite Hermione right away and to later give her a hard time because of his own mistake. Ron decided to make up for that too.
-Well, that’s not really what happened. But you are unbelievably dumb. Do you not know any other girls?
Draco though still avoided him all day all week. Still ignored Potter’s attempts to start a conversation. Still was so unbelievably distant and even oblivious to everything around him, not just Harry. A new Quidditch position calmed his detractors down a bit, but it wasn’t enough. Just as Draco expected, no one really took pleasure in being his teammate. Ron was the only one who didn’t speak or act on it – captain’s duties didn’t let him – but the rest of the team never missed an opportunity to mention here and there how Draco “stole” that position and how much “like him” it was. From time to time Draco thought about quitting, giving people what they want. But the last remaining bits of his pride wouldn’t let him. He couldn’t just let them win and every other day came to the Quidditch field and did his absolute best. To prove people wrong, to prove himself worthy to himself. Not to give up.
-Starfish and Stick,-Hermione interrupted everyone with her strict loud words,-A move in professional Quidditch used both by Keepers, and sometimes by Seekers. That’s what Malfoy used. And he had his hand on the broom, if that matters to you, Smith,-she said, basically quoted the “Quidditch through the ages”. Ron looked at her with more love in his eyes than ever. No one said a word, but absolutely everyone looked impressed.
-What is this?-Draco asked pointing at pizza Harry brought. He seemed to have asked that question for a thousandth time that day.
-Forget it, really,-Draco grabbed his uniform and stormed out of the room. The match was getting closer with every minute.
After a thousand more thanks, a hundred hugs and a few tears, Harry and Draco finally walked out of the orphanage. The sun had already disappeared, but the stars lighted their way just as beautifully. Harry breathed the fresh air and didn’t really feel like going anywhere in particular. Just walking around, maybe till the very sunrise, would be great.
-Ginny?-the world in which Ginny Weasley shares the details of her love life with Draco Malfoy just couldn’t exist in Harry’s brain.
-It’s not attacking you!,-Harry honestly tried not to laugh. He did his best to, mostly because he knew how furious Draco would be if Harry laughed at him. But in the end, Potter doubted anyone would be able to hold in a laugh seeing what he saw, and he chuckled, even under Draco’s angry glance, he just couldn’t hep it.
-It was amazing!-Harry yelled at Draco, trying to make sure he could hear him through all the noise. Draco was in shock, but in a good one. And when Harry grabbed him by the shoulders and then pulled him into a hug, he didn’t object,-I knew you’d do it!
Even if Harry did plan to do that, he really wanted to eat first. Potter did his best to lay the table, but if Sirius’s mother saw what was brought to her old table, in her old kitchen, she would have a heart attack.
Harry’s and Ron’s conflict was completely forgotten. They talked through everything they didn’t have a chance to discuss during those couple weeks over a few drinks. Harry was a little more careful, while Ron really took the celebration seriously and didn’t limit himself at all.
-You’re welcome,-Harry said sincerely,-You’re okay? Have a place to go?-Draco nodded,-Okay. See you in Hogwarts, I guess.
10 points turned into 20, and then into 30. Terrence Glover, Hufflepuff’s Keeper seemed to have been on fire and knew it. He caught Quaffles with surprising ease, smiled a lot, flew towards the crowd and even “flirted” with it. It pissed Harry off. He saw how with every missed Quaffle Ron’s confidence shrunk, and it was the worst thing that could have happened to them. Ron, losing his spirit.
-How nice of you. Let’s go,-for a while they remained silent, Luna looking ahead of herself with her dreamy gaze and Harry wondering how to start that conversation.
-Okay, I did hear something from your conversation with your mom,-Draco looked as if he was ready to kill him,-I’m sorry! I just…I did come here to get you outside! Skipped Ron’s tryouts for you,-he mumbled,-What I wanted to say is that I don’t know anything about your mother as a person. But I know one thing. Your mother’s love to you was enough to stop a war. She wants only the best for you. Draco,-he added, and maybe that, or maybe Draco’s shocked eyes starring into his, gave him goosebumps. Harry felt his cheeks warming up.
-I guess I should go,-Harry said, mostly to himself. Draco nodded and stepped away. They already said their goodbyes. It was over. Something that never started was already over. Draco turned away, but Harry stood there, looking at his back, fighting a strong desire to call out his name.
Harry wasn’t really surprised to see Draco there, sitting alone with a letter in his hands. Not that Potter considered him a loser, he seemed more like a “people who don’t care” category. Or maybe Malfoy created his own category. “People who want to be left alone”
-Are you going to ask Ginny?-Ron asked Harry carefully, as they were walking to Gladrags Wizardwear, Ron needed a new pair of trousers . Harry was kicking falling leaves with his feet, deeply inhaling the most perfect smell of the autumn. It rained the day before and it felt like everything outside was reborn. Harry wished it was the same with people. Go through sad times, walk out more beautiful and new than ever.
In less the 10 minutes Hermione walked out of the room. She was holding at least 6 different brochures, each on everything slightly related to her field of interest. Reminding Ron about his turn, she went to the common room, eyes glued to one of the booklets.
Draco too felt as if the ground vanished from under his feet. He had seen Harry in rage before, but that was something absolutely different. Before Weasley could wake up, Draco sneaked into the dorm too. Harry was either pretending, or already asleep. Either way Draco had nothing to say to him. He knew he was an indirect reason why Harry and Ron just had that fight. And he knew that what Harry did was basically taking Draco’s side, which already felt weird enough. He didn’t want to be in a center of another conflict, or a reason of two best friends’ break up. But it was Harry’s choice. To defend him again, to be by his side, to stand up for him. Draco laid down sleepless, absolutely amazed by that thought.
-Yes,-Draco didn’t look away, didn’t stutter. And Harry immediately felt more sober. Malfoy offered him his hand and Harry took it. Together they paced into the center of the Hall, not even looking at other staring at him, not looking at anything but each other. And a slow song started. They danced carefully, still with considerable distance between each other, but as song progressed, both of them felt a little more relaxed.
-Okay, then. Have a nice night,-Hermione said, dragging Ron away. Once they were far away enough, Harry stood beside Draco and together they headed towards the Great Hall. He knew that normally he was supposed to compliment Draco (and there was a lot to compliment), take his hand and start a lovely conversation, but nothing was normal about that night, not in his head. Harry was still insanely nervous and mostly looked at his own feet as they walked. Draco remained silent too, but at least he still looked proud and confident.
-What is one thing that makes you happy? One thing you would agree to do for the rest of your life?-she asked. Harry felt like a fool. What was he supposed to say? All I ever did was fighting Voldemort and playing Quidditch. "Sorry I never really had any hobbies"?
-I don’t think so. It last for a second, I just…,-he sighed, trying to get a hold of his panic that started growing again,-What the hell is wrong with me? He’s a guy! He’s Malfoy! I’m not…I’m not…,-no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t get himself to say the end of that sentence.
-Of course,-she sighed. Professor Hooch blew a whistle, very soon this field will be way too loud for casual conversations.
Over that half an hour it took Harry to give up on his essay and put it away, Draco really fell asleep. Potter tried to be as quiet as he could not to wake him up. Still he knew that any minute know laughing Anthony and Ernie will storm in and ruin his sleep.
-When’s your turn?-he flinched a little once Potter appeared next to him. But instead of replying, silently handed him his piece of paper with a number on it,-Right after me,-Draco nodded,-Do you already know what you want to do?
The cold of the night woke Draco up and made the last bits of dreamy illusion he was in fade away. He wrapped his arms around himself trying to warm up and walked towards the Hogsmeade. Filch trusted Draco to go by himself and Malfoy did have an urge to run back into the castle, but there were only 10 minutes left and his mother was waiting. Draco sighed and walked.
-Of course. Not right after your graduation, you can’t possibly expect me to hire an 18-year-old. But once you’ve gained some experience, some maturity…it would be an honor for Hogwarts and its future students,-Harry desperately blushed. He couldn’t believe McGonagall thought so highly of him,-Mister Potter, you don’t have to settle on this now. If you find something you like more, it’s great. I just want to give you a back-up plan. It’s always easier if you have one, right?
-Cheating. Not so hard to understand, is it?-he smirked. A dozen of voices started chattering, trying to prove Zacharias wrong, or just insult him. It was hard to understand what most of them were saying.
year only. McGonagall made a decision to allow adult drinks on the ball after she found out that kids managed to sneak them in anyway) was too far to reach. Harry just smiled and tried to look relaxed though sudden need to do to say at least something was eating him alive.
The Ball. Of course. It was two weeks away and Harry spent last month literally running away from the girls of all houses and most courses. No, he didn’t have a date yet, even a potential one, but he also didn’t want to go with a stranger.
-Did you go to Ms. Pomfrey’s at least? She should be able to heal bruises,-Harry said, sitting on one of the beds.
-Harry…,-the look of concern appeared on Molly’s face. She wiped her hands with her apron and reached to take Harry’s.
Ron didn’t find any other comforting words and boys waited for Hermione in silence. The clock ticked and with pounding heart Harry looked at the door every time someone walked in and every time that someone wasn’t Draco. Sadness of possibly being stood up over-weighed the relief a thousand times.
-Yeah. Yeah, it was,-Harry smiled. And stood slightly closer to Draco,-I also wanted to ask something,-Harry wasn’t sure if that was the Gryffindor’s courage that finally woke up in him, or alcohol, but once again, he just had to ask.
-Yeah, they all know. Some even asked to see the Mark,-Draco said sighing,-Honestly, I was surprised Madam Polkinghorne even allowed me to be here, but she said that it was okay, that I was acquitted. But really she just needs all the help she can get.
-Orphanage?-Harry asked. Draco nodded quickly, still not meeting eyes with him,-That’s where you’ve been going every weekend?-another nod. Harry didn’t know how to react, but he had a thousand questions in his head.
-Expelliarmus!-Harry yelled as he and Hermione ran down to the field. The wand jumped out of Michael’s hands,-What the hell is going on?-Draco quickly got up, fixing his uniform. His hair was messed up and his clothes were dirty, yet somehow managed to keep more dignity than anyone present.
-Harry! What’s wrong?-the voices of Ron and Hermione pulled him back into reality. They stood right in front of the entrance, Ron’s jacket on Hermione’s shoulders, concerned looks on both of their faces,-Where were you?
Draco didn’t know what to say. He got pale, but at the same time an unexpected warm feeling flooded his heart.
-Hell yes! Or you have a better candidate to be your date?-Draco thought of the Greengrass sisters, whom he knew even before they started studying together and and one of whom had a long-lasting crush on him. She wouldn’t say no. Neither of them would, actually. And though Draco never really knew them, he could tell they both were very, very pretty.
-We’ll see,-before Draco could resist, Harry looked at his watch,-We better go to the field if you don’t want Ron to kill you.
-Good night!-Harry said to him before he could disappear behind the door. Draco looked at him with that stupid and adorable expression he had every time Potter said something nice to him. He smiled, nodded and closed the door behind himself.
-I did,-Draco closed the door and opened his closet, taking out his Quidditch uniform,-It’s not just a bruise and she said it would disappear in a few hours. Or days.
Harry got up and looked around. His eyes fell on Malfoy, who didn’t seem to move at all since Harry showed up.
-I’m not nervous!-he said and proceeded to mock Harry until Professor Hooch asked both teams to get on the field. And then Harry saw that Draco was, in fact, nervous.
-Oh, I bet you were having fun back then, weren’t you? You enjoyed it? Killing, torturing? Having your Lord right in your house?-Draco didn’t say anything to that, but his face had changed. Harry could see how much effort it took him not to punch the idiot in the face,-I know everything about you, Malfoy. You should be locked away.
-Has it been like this before? In Gryffindor?-Anthony Goldstein, a Ravenclaw student, who Harry knew back in DA days asked. Harry shook his head. Ron shrugged and tried to walk into the same dorm, but it seemed like some invisible obstacle didn’t let him do it.
year – in most of them the robes turned out to be living and very hungry creatures and ended up swallowing Ron whole.
-We never talked about the ball. I mean, except for that one time,-saying it out loud made Harry realize that maybe they should have talked. Or Harry should have just mentioned it once, just to make sure. But it was an awkward thing to talk about and with all the classes Harry never found time…
-To see that face, of course!-she said and touched Draco’s nose. Draco smiled, allowing it which shocked Harry to his core,-So where’s the lucky bitch? Who are you taking? Greengrass?-she asked and looked around Draco. Harry was still standing a little aside – close enough to hear everything they said, but far enough to give them some privacy
Potter starred right at Malfoy. He saw him in action and knew that technically, Draco could win. But so much could still go wrong.
-Draco volunteers there every weekend actually,-she nodded,-And there’s a little girl. She’s around 6, her name is Lucy and…,-Molly turned off the water as she realized where Harry was going with it. She looked at him and she read everything off of his face. Sadness, desperation, but also a ray of hope, hope that his own expectation of other people – of her – gave him. The most fragile kind of hope.
-Draco?-Harry carefully approached him and reached out to put his hand on his shoulders, but Draco quickly turned around and Harry’s hand just hanged in the air.
-It’s not even the worst one,-he said and wanted to add something, but the door behind them opened and a small curly girl walked out, wiping her eyes. Harry’s heart shrunk looking at her.
-It’s pizza and you know what it is,-Harry put a plate in front of Draco and poured him a glass of coke.
-When?-Draco shrugged,-Library, tonight. You’ll help me with the potions assignment,-Harry said, as if he had a right to demand anything from Draco. Malfoy sighed and mumbled “Fine”.
-It’s absolutely okay. You know, when I heard that you all were offered an opportunity to come back to Hogwarts and graduate, I particularly hoped that you would take this offer, Harry.
Two figures flew up with impressive speed. Old school broomsticks were annoying, but Harry quickly made his peace with it. He saw Draco on the opposite side of the field. Their eyes were hectically searching for a small golden dot in the sky, but it moved too fast. Harry heard someone screaming his name from the tribunes, but it only distracted him. He almost met eyes with Draco when Malfoy suddenly flew to his right. He was like a bullet, eyes concentrated on his goal. Harry immediately followed him. His instincts took over, instincts of a pretty damn good seeker. He saw a snitch. Draco was closer, but nothing was over yet. Harry could already feel a small sphere in his hand, his heart was beating out of his chest. And when Potter finally overtook Draco, snitch made a sharp turn to the left. And Draco was the first one to react.
-Because of this!-Harry’s tone almost matched Ron’s,-I didn’t want to have this conversation! I knew how you’d react!
Now that he was alone, Draco finally had a moment to think. He was in Harry’s house. Alone. Because he went to get them some food – some muggle food – because he wanted Draco to try it. And before that, they spent a whole day together, taking care of children. And a day before that, they decided to go to a ball together. And not a single fight, not one punch or an insult. It was endlessly, unbelievably weird, but at the same time so damn right that Draco wondered how come that had spent 7 years of their lives doing anything but that?
-It’s my time,-Hermione said as one of the Hufflepuff 7th year students walked out of the office. She was holding a brochure that said “Astronomy! A new way to look at life!” and had a few tears on her eyes that contrasted with a big bright smile on her lips. The girl threw a hopeful glance around herself and ran towards her common room.
-I also don’t think Draco was ever evil,-Hermione said confidently, earning a surprised look from Ron,-He was way too young to be an actual Death Eater. He was forced into it,-Harry silently thanked Hermione for being so understanding. And then he wondered why he actually cares about all that.
-I don’t mind. Really. You can tell me what you want,-he said. Draco starred down at him, eyes red and a huge purple spot that only started fading away.
-Since your program is slightly different from the 7th grade, there’s been made a decision to educate you separately from the rest of Hogwarts. But still, you are the part of it. Crucial part. You will participate in the House Cup Championship, have your own Quidditch team,-a couple people gladly exclaimed,-I knew it would make you happy. If you want to try and join the new team, you can approach…,-Harry saw how McGonagall looked it him and knew she was about to say his name. Well, it was fair, for the last time Hogwarts was safe enough to have Quidditch, Potter was the captain of Gryffindor’s team. But now, he didn’t want anything less than being a captain again. He slightly shook his head and looked at the Headmistress with plea in his eyes. She realized everything right away.
-It is such honor to meet you, Mister Potter,-she rushed towards him, grabbed his hand and started shaking it so fiercely that Harry worried it would fall of,- I’m Analise Polkinghorne, the head of this orphanage. What brings you here, Mister Potter?-her eyes sparkled with admiration and happiness. It reminded Harry of the first time Ron had met Victor Krum.
-Ron, can we all calm down and just talk about it?-Harry asked. There were still a few other students in the room and more than anything Harry wanted to just calmly and privately explain everything to Ron.
-It’s the one,-Ron didn’t add anything. But he looked so confident in his words that he didn’t have to.
-Huh,-Hazel looked at them skeptically. Harry had an idea to take Draco’s hand, but at the last moment thought it would be too much,-Alright…See you around,-she left and only after her figure walked out of the library and disappeared in the halls, Harry could relax. He started laughing, unable to believe what just happened.
-Y-yes,-Harry slowly walked towards the couch. By the time he reached it he noticed that the room was almost empty, only Malfoy was quietly writing something at the table next to the fireplace. Probably the only person Ginny didn’t manage to kick out.
-Okay, I’m bored,-Pansy said after at least 30 minutes of discussing everything she had missed about Hogwarts. Draco did omit some details, but still was particularly open with her,-Let’s go to the common room,-she asked Draco.
-Well, it was fine today,-Megan Jones, the chaser of the team chimed in,-Seriously, Malfoy, bold move,-she said. Draco smiled slightly.
All 8th year students were asked to follow Headmistress McGonagall once the Sorting ceremony was over. It was nice to be led by her, personally. Took them back to their first year. Minerva brought students to the tower they hadn’t seen before and stopped in front of the tall wooden doors. She smiled warmly at everyone. It looked like she was happy to see every single student who came back. She really was.
-You can approach Professor Hooch. She will form your team,-Harry gave McGonagall a warm, thanking smile, but she acted as if nothing happened,-If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask me,-everyone was so excited to see the new common room that even if they did have questions, they weren’t as important.
-Since when do you even care about clothes, and looking good, and…and impressing someone?-Harry asked.
And they didn’t. Harry constantly caught weird stares at him, frequently was a subject of discussions, some brave students even asked him questions. How was it, looking for the horcruxes? Were you scared? How did you come back? Why did Malfoy’s mother lie for you?
-I’m not calling you Harry,-Draco said after a pause. He wasn’t yet smiling, but the sad and suspicious shade started disappearing from his eyes.
year students were supposed to pass an exam, the difficulty of which Hogwarts had never seen before. It was created specifically for them, and compared to it, N.E.W.T. seemed like a walk in the park.
-Draco!-Harry kept knocking even after Draco ignored him,-We’re gonna be late!-Malfoy didn’t react. The world could end, for all her cared. He really wanted to stay asleep. But Harry didn’t approve of it and kept pounding and pounding, until the last bits of sleep left Malfoy.
-Luna, yesterday I saw you coming back to the castle with D…Malfoy. Were you together?-he asked. His question didn’t surprise Luna at all.
-You were amazing, really,-he repeated, now looking into Draco’s face. His hands were still on his shoulders, and Draco was looking at him with such happy and open smile, he had never seen Malfoy like that before. His hair was absolutely wild, Draco would probably have a heart attack if he had a mirror close, his cheeks were bright red and he was still out of breath. They both were. From seeing Malfoy like that, something pinched in Harry’s heart. He didn’t really know what he was doing when he leaned his face towards Draco.
-Testified for Malfoy in court?-Hermione expressed his thoughts and smirked seeing shock on Harry’s face.
Even from the tribunes Harry could see Ron blushing. He chuckled at his friend, but his happiness didn’t last as Kadi Bush scored first 10 points for Hufflepuff within the first 5 minutes of the match.
-Yes, but…,-Draco wasn’t sure how to finish that sentence. He just hoped that McGonagall would still understand, because Malfoys don’t whine and pout, even when they’re convinced that their life is over.
-You haven’t been here before, have you?-Draco asked, assured to get a negative answer,-The view is pretty fascinating, isn’t it?
He found Draco in the first place he had checked. Their dorm. Malfoy was standing by the window, squeezing a piece of paper in his hands. Harry carefully closed the door behind him, but it still made noise that Draco heard.
Harry nodded, but inside, he didn’t like it at all. Draco seemed pretty into the idea of challenging Harry yesterday, and despite everything that was still going on with him, Harry believed Malfoy wouldn’t miss that opportunity. But time passed, Chasers and Beaters were found. A couple people wanted to try out for a Keeper’s position, which would take approximately half an hour. Then it’s seeker’s turn.
-Yes,-Draco said. He wasn’t. And Harry didn’t know how to comfort him,-I…I’ll see you in school,-he said and disappeared – apparated. One second he was there, and another he wasn’t. Harry followed his example in a moment, but Draco was already on his way to Hogwarts when Harry appeared in Hogsmeade. They walked into the castle almost at the same time; Draco wasn’t crying anymore, but he didn’t look like he was eager to talk too.
Once Ron disappeared behind the doors, Harry threw a sight at Draco. Malfoy was standing there, patiently starring into a wall.
-I know, I’m sorry,-Draco mumbled, letting go of the girl,-Say Hi to your guest, Lucy,-Draco pointed at Harry, who was standing aside from them, feeling like an intruder,-This is Harry Potter.
-Malfoy!-his heart dropped when he heard a loud voice somewhere far behind himself,-Leaving without a goodbye?-Harry quickly reached Draco, still just in a shirt.
Yesterday i passed my *last* exam and now i'm free!!!! I'mma post more often now, especially if you give me some feedback hahaha.
-I…I don’t know…but it’s totally safe, everyone drinks it,-Harry said, drinking half of his glass to show how right he was.
-You read awfully slowly,-Draco said when Harry finally lowered the letter. He was speechless and at the same time had so much to say,-Can you believe it?-Harry couldn’t,-She is selling it. Selling the manor. My home!-Draco finally expressed some emotion. Mostly anger.
-Draco,- Madam Polkinghorne was standing at the doors to the children’s room while Draco and Harry were reading a bedtime story for Lucy,-It’s late,-she whispered. And it was, 10.30 pm, at least, and they still had homework due tomorrow morning. Draco looked at Lucy, who’s eyes started filling up with tears already,-Lucy, you can see our guests out if you promise not to cry afterwards,-Analise said, fully aware that she will cry anyway. But Lucy nodded and jumped off the bed. Holding her little hand, Draco walked down the hall towards the exit, Harry went right behind them.
The same thing happened with the name of the team. At first people say they don’t care, then they try to put all the responsibility to the captain’s shoulder, and in the end complain that he didn’t do a good job. But here Ron decided to be careful and left a simple “8th year” as the name of the team. The disappointed look on Professor Hooch’s face stayed with him for a while.
The ghosts of Sirius, Remus, Tonks, Dumbledore, Snape, Fred, even Cedrick wouldn’t stop haunting Harry. He couldn’t feel any satisfaction from the defeat, knowing that Teddy Lupin will never meet his parents. Knowing that Amos Diggory had to bury his own child. Knowing that George Weasley will never be able to look into his own reflection without a second thought.
That wasn’t even a lie, technically. Harry had already discovered that he couldn’t follow Malfoy to wherever he was going. Last Saturday, Draco left the castle at 6 am, walked to Hogsmeade and apparated. Harry stood there in his pajamas and invisibility cloak for about an hour and then went back to have breakfast.
-Wait…are you serious? Do the children recognize you?-Harry didn’t know why he decided to start with that question. But to be fair, there had been time when the faces of the whole Malfoy family  (Draco included) decorated the front page of numerous editions of the Daily Prophet.
-Knock on your head, Potter-Draco opened the door so quickly that Harry’s fist was left hanging in the air. At first Potter froze, but then put his fist down and smiled.
-It’s no bother,-Harry nodded awkwardly and stepped into Headmistress’ office. It hardly changed since the last moment Dumbledore had it. Maybe it felt a little more…strict. Minimalistic. Official. Minerva McGonagall drowned in Dumbledore’s huge old chair and once she saw Harry at the doors, she smiled and asked him to take a seat.
-Mister Potter, your generosity knows no limit!-she exclaimed, wrapping her arms around Harry’s neck. Her hugs were just like her hand-shakes. Tight, warm, loving,-Thank you, thank you so much!
And Harry saw nothing but a waste of time in this. But at the same time, he was too convinced in his own rightness to go up to Weasley and talk. Instead he just looked at him for a couple seconds, feeling even angrier and sadder than after waking up and noticed Hermione. She sat next to Ron, but didn’t share his positive mood. She nodded at Harry, as if acknowledging his presence and saying “Hey! I’m still here!”. But her eyes were sad and she didn’t rush to invite Harry to sit with them.
Draco had three solid hours of sleep that night. He didn’t have any dreams, just enjoyed the silence and peace of the night, and this rare opportunity to sleep all alone in the room; no snoring dormmates, no early birds who woke up at 6 am and made sure everyone was aware of that. Just harmony and bliss. That was cruelly interrupted by loud poundings on the door.
-It could be. Or not. Depends on what you choose to do,-Draco clenched his fists,-Every single trait a person has can be both good and bad. It can be used as a tool to create something wonderful, to help you on a journey to the happiest life, or it can absolutely destroy it. You make the difference. You draw the line,-as fascinating and inspiring the speech was, Draco’s doubts didn’t disappear. How could they? If he is the one to make the choice, to draw the line, what happens if he makes the wrong choice again? How can he trust himself now, when two years ago people had suffered, nearly died because of him? And is it really about whether it’s worth it or not to make an effort? Does Draco even deserve a second chance, a redemption of a kind? Maybe he actually is free now solely because of Potter’s efforts and if it wasn’t for him and his connections in the ministry, Draco would be where he truly belongs. In the Azkaban, where all the death eaters are, all those who hurt and tortured innocent people, those who started the war who took away so many lives.
-Harry!-turned out Lovegood was an early bird too and Harry met her half way to their tower,-What are you doing here?
-Ms. Lovegood, the game, please!-Slughorn did his best to help her focus,-Malfoy and Williams are both chasing the snitch.
-Wow!-together with the whole school Luna exclaimed,-Malfoy almost got hit off his broom! Seems like Beaters don’t like him very much,-Draco managed to stay afloat, but Luna was right. Michael Harris, the beater closest to Draco did the bare minimum to save him from bludger’s hit.
-I…,-Draco threw a quick glance at Harry,-I don’t want to bother you with this long, boring story, ma’am.
-Are you done, Mr. Malfoy?-Kingsley asked. Draco was standing up, all alone against at least 50 people. He was on verge of tears.
Feeling just a bit shy, Draco took Harry by his arm and closed his eyes. He had to learn to apparate in rather extreme conditions; Narcissa taught him herself during the summer a year ago. They had to use every opportunity and practice during those short moments when Voldemort was away and didn’t control every Malfoy’s step. That’s why Draco wasn’t very confident in his apparition skills. Especially if there was another person, he was responsible for.
-No. You didn’t ask me for anything. And it doesn’t really matter, even if I wasn’t there, they still would have let you go,-Harry said, really believing his words
Draco looked into the painting, not sure what to do. Ron’s and Zabini’s words didn’t bother him. Potter’s silence sort of did.
-I knew how he’d react. He was so excited about it, I just…I guess I didn’t want to disappoint him,-Harry sighed, looking up. Ron caught a quaffle and threw it back at the chaser, Terry Boot.
“How can I just keep living and hoping for the second chance, when so many people who actually deserved it, didn’t have it because I took it away from them?”
-They get angry, of course. They yell, cry, some try to beat me up,-Draco sighed,-But the administrator of the orphanage says it’s good for them to release anger that way.
-I’m not asking anything,-he repeated,-But Ron always says how lonely you are and he hates it. I do too,-he blushed, but didn’t allow himself to stop now,-Lucy needs a home and when I was thinking of who could accept someone else’s child, give them home and love them as her own, I could only think of you,-Harry saw tears on Molly’s eyes. He was on verge of crying too,-I am…I am so grateful for everything you gave me. And I’ll never be able to pay you back, but…,-a few tears fell down Harry’s eyes and Molly rushed to hug him.
-Sure. Thank you, Ginny. A lot,-Weasley winked and disappeared behind the door. Normally, people feel sadness and pain after such conversations. Harry felt hopefulness. And something told him Ginny felt the same. Or almost the same. He truly cared for Ginny, saw her as a family. Loved her. Just not in the way he was expected to.
-Mister Malfoy,-McGonagall closed the binder with a sigh. She knew that possible unemployment was only the tip of the iceberg,-I would love to tell you that your past won't ever affect you or your future in any way and that there is nothing but happiness coming your way. Unfortunately, there isn't a single person in this school I can say that to,-she made a pause, watching Draco’s reaction, but he remained unconvinced,- What had happened to all of us couldn't help to leave impact. On ones worse than on others. Yet, that doesn’t mean we should just give up on ourselves.
-Liar!-now Draco was actually mad. And it even surprised Harry, because he had seen Malfoy in rage. Mostly after or during their fights. But never when he was shown concern. Not that Harry had ever shown him any concern.
-I said it just so the ministry would let you go,-Harry said, not sure why he was looking for excuses for the truth
-No, no, you definitely should not,-Harry smiled nervously, seeing Draco chuckling,-I am perfectly capable of managing myself,-he said to Kreacher and to Madam Polkinghorne , as she started worrying about Harry not having the help again,-I’m in Hogwarts now and then I’ll be living alone. I’ll be fine.
Maybe Quidditch will become the thing that will make Draco want to stay. Harry knew Malfoys didn’t like being told what to do, and if it wasn’t for Ministry, Draco definitely wouldn’t be here. He feels like he’s wasting time. And since there’s really nothing better to do, Harry can at least try to prove him wrong.
So here's the new part, really hope you like it because i've been brainstorming it for months. probably.
-It’s breakfast,-Draco put a piece of an apple pie on his plate, ignoring Harry who still was standing right beside him, now gaining a lot of attention from other students.
-I know, Ron!-Harry raised his voice, though he didn’t plan to. He would rather talk about Quidditch again,-This stupid ball is more than 3 months away, do we have to talk about this now?-Ron mumbled something rude under his breath and the topic was changed. But the mood had changed completely too. Harry was looking for an opportunity to bail and leave the love-birds alone, which, according to Harry, was probably what they wanted anyway.
-I mean, be friends…with whoever you want...to be friends with ,-Hermione mumbled and awkwardly looked away as the match finally started. Harry decided to ignore what she said. Both of them tried to pay attention to the game, but really could only look at two figures up in the sky. The tribunes started cheering, supporting the teams and Harry was sad to notice that Hufflepuff got way more support this time.
-I don’t think he goes there. And Harry, whatever you do, just don’t follow him, okay? Try asking him first.
-Mr. Malfoy, I am pleased to inform you that the court of Ministry of Magic agrees with Mr. Potter and finds you innocent. You are acquitted of all charges.
-Is everything okay?-Draco nodded,-Are you sure?-another nod and he turned back to the window,-Who is that letter from?
Harry watched him from his seat, surprisingly all alone. Draco, who always found a way to show up in the Great Hall before Potter did, was now very, very late. Harry looked at the clock every 3 minutes and waited for Draco upon his now empty plate, and when by the end of the breakfast Malfoy still hadn’t showed up, Harry had no choice but to leave without him. Until…
-Of course no,-Harry said and another name added to the table. And another; Ernie McMillan, a Hufflepuff student joined them after a minute of thinking. Now they needed a Slytherin.
As the train had arrived and Harry set foot to Hogwarts, he smiled. For a second, all his doubts about coming back were gone. Harry was happy to be back. Happy to go through another year there, a whole year when he has every right to feel and act like a child. And maybe it was too soon to tell, but Harry sincerely hoped and believed that this year would give him enough positive memories to outweigh all sad ones. At least he wanted to believe in that. Months that it took to rebuild Hogwarts, only made the castle better. It still had its magical, warm, home-like atmosphere, but it also felt new, reborn.
-I didn’t see you at the Potions today,-Hermione sat down next to Harry. He smiled to her as seven figures flew into the sky.
-Well, you are lucky then,-Harry said as he got up and started digging his way through his still unorganized luggage.
-Everything,-knot in his stomach ached. He wanted to see Harry's face as he told him those words, but couldn't force himself to look up. His pale cheeks slowly turned light pink and then red,-Everything we could have been,-he whispered. Harry looked at him, trying to understand what Draco meant. His face didn't express anything but embarrassment and regret. Harry couldn't find the right words. Not now, not ever before.
-According to my information,-the same witch wouldn’t stop,-You and Mr. Malfoy had never been friends in school. Some even referred to you two as “enemies”. How would you know what he wanted?-Harry was silent for a moment. Witch’s usually evil face turned into a very happy and satisfied grin.
-We can,-Harry chimed in,-As long as it’s someone from another house,-Ron sighed and seeing Harry’s not really upset face couldn’t help but feel a little hurt.
I don't know what to say, here's a new part. Thank you for your kudos and comments, feedback means a lot to me!
-Yeah. Very active and very open one. I’m shocked you didn’t know. She just asked me if Granger was “available”.
-Mr. Potter,-Kingsley called, with an intention to finally end everything,-I want to ask you something. Do you truly, genuinely think that Draco Malfoy is innocent? That he had been pulled into the war involuntarily? That his and Voldemort’s views and intentions didn’t match?
-By the way,-Ron said once (or slightly before) Hermione was finished,-I saw Malfoy getting on the train. Can you believe he’s coming back?-Harry was torn away from his thoughts.
-It was…indescribable, she didn’t shut up for weeks,-Harry said,-Okay, how do you feel about muggle food?
-It's not fair, you know?-Draco looked down, not believing that he was actually about to say this. Something he had thought about for so long, something so secret and personal. He never thought he'd actually tell that to Potter. But everything had changed. The war had changed everything. It was really now or never.
-I remember you. Of course I remember you, my dear boy,-she smiled. Harry had never seen her do that,-Lucius is a very decent man. I remember how happy my brother was the day he asked to marry Narcissa. How are they doing?
-I don’t mean to scare you, Draco. But maybe it’s time we had a heart-to-heart, do you agree?-Draco sat back down, not responding to her question. He didn’t want that heart-to-heart. By that time he had already regretted asking anything from her. Could’ve just waited for McGonagall to analyze his marks, give him some recommendations and let him go. But then again, who else could he talk about that with?
-Who you are actually going with. You can tell her,-Harry’s brain had never been particularly fast, but in stressful situation like this one it turned off completely. So Potter just starred at Draco with the most idiotic, confused and horrified expression.
-Ginny?-Harry asked, shocked. Draco nodded,-As friends?-Draco shook his head. Harry needed a moment to process it,-How do you even know it?
But as he opened the fridge, he found nothing but an old apple, a box of spoiled milk and left-over pizza that already started growing other forms of life on itself.
-He’s still your father. Mine was a bully when he was a little younger than us,-Harry realized it was a shitty example just after he said it. And made sure of it after Draco scoffed sadly.
None of them talked about it throughout the whole holidays. On the next day after that conversation Harry, Ron and Hermione woke up a little earlier to hop on the train and leave the Hogwarts for the holidays for the last time ever and spend them at the Burrow. Harry was glad to see Ginny and Luna waiting for them on the train. Harry was even more glad when 5 of them managed to have fun during their trip with no awkward tension ex-lovers tend to have. Ginny didn’t let go of Luna’s hand till they arrived, despite weird stares they got from time to time. Harry admired and envied their bravery. And their love.
Apparently, Hogsmeade is even more beautiful in early morning. Calmness and indifference of empty bars and stores attracted, the birds singing for no one but them created intimate but not awkward atmosphere. Harry breathed in cold morning air and smiled. The view and this feeling were worth being a little sleep-deprived.
-You are the one to talk, Potter,-boys kept laughing, until Draco suddenly got serious again,-You are a cliché,-he repeated,-But…thank you.
-If that only meant anything,-Hermione said but Harry was already on his way to the dorm and didn’t hear her.
Harry’s days as an ex-war hero, now a simple Hogwarts student mostly looked exactly like previous ones. Harry would wake up a little later than he probably should, have a quick breakfast with Malfoy at the end of the table and run to the classes. With Malfoy. Again.
-She’s been crying the whole bloody morning!- Madam Polkinghorne was clearly disappointed in Lucy’s behavior and threw strict glances at her.
The tryouts were scheduled right after the breakfast, and Draco Malfoy seemed to have decided to skip both. He was nowhere to be seen at their table, and Harry would gladly go back to their common room to check on him, or even forcefully bring his skinny ass to the Quidditch field, but Ron dragged him out before Harry could even think of an excuse to go back. He hoped Malfoy would have enough decency to keep his yesterday’s promise.
-I’m sorry. I think I should just go,-he started getting up, but McGonagall whispered the spell that locked the door.
-Coffee, then?-Malfoy nodded and laid his head down. His hair covered the table like snow covers the lawn. He closed his eyes, but knew that no sleep would come now.
-Does she know about…well,-Harry asked, regretting it right away, but Draco knew what he wanted to know without even him having to say that.
-How sweet,-he took a deep breath and headed to the middle of the field where the rest of his teammates were already gathering. Harry watched him leave with a smile on his lips, until his eyes stumbled on Hermione kissing Ron for good luck. Weasley looked very pale and visibly nervous. Harry wanted to run up to him, but didn’t move. After a minute Hermione approached him and together, they got up to the tribunes.
The boys didn’t have any time to admire the beauty of the beginning of winter and with a clap, apparated to another side of London. Draco was visibly nervous being this late, but when they heard a loud, desperate cry coming from the orphanage, Harry shared his concern.
The classes ended unusually, for the history of magic, quickly. 8th year’s Quidditch team headed to the field for another training, and so did Harry, following his newly obtained habit. That day he sat down farther away from the field. He couldn’t hear the players talk anymore before and it made him feel more like an outcast. It was the first time Harry watched the training and actually missed being the one on the broomstick.
-Potter, I can’t believe you are so focused on the History of Magic,-Draco himself tore Harry away from his thoughts. Harry woke up and found himself in the class, sitting next to smirking Draco. And for the first time in a while, that smirk pissed him off.
-Oh, there we go again,-Ron sighed and took a step away from Harry. In a second, Potter felt all the heart-wrenching cold the end of December had to offer,-Just say it already
-Oh, shut up,-Harry grabbed his hand himself, but Draco wasn’t exactly fighting him. Together, they sat down on an already very crowded couch, so close to each other, their hips and shoulders touched. Luna was telling some story, and honestly, for a bunch of drunk teenagers there was nothing better than a semi-realistic story from Lovegood.
Lucy and Draco, with their perfect harmony, tried to distract Harry when they saw how his mood suddenly went down. And when it was time to go to sleep, Lucy demanded a personal bed-time story from both of them.
-If your desire to become an auror is still as strong as three years ago – or as strong as Mister Weasley’s – we won’t be here for long.
-Yes. Thank you. Thank you so much,-he thought about getting up and hugging her, but managed to hold himself back.
Discussing that with Ron and Hermione seemed surreal. Ridiculous, in a way. Harry and Draco weren’t even dating and judging by Malfoy’s reaction to Harry’s kiss (or complete absence of it), they weren’t going to start. Harry was very glad he wouldn’t have to see Malfoy for at least two more weeks, because if he did, after what happened, he would burn down alive, solely from embarrassment.
-It’s so different from ours. From all other common rooms,-Harry said using the opportunity to talk to Draco. Malfoy nodded, now looking very nostalgic and glad.
-I…I…,-he took a deep breath. Right. He was supposed to be the brave one,-Right here. Ready?-he asked, looking up at Malfoy.
-You are useless. i should have asked Malfoy,-Ron mumbled and went looking himself. Harry followed him. They spent another two hours searching, trying on, laughing and arguing. Harry approved of every option Ron tried, even the worst ones, and in an hour Ron stopped asking him. He settled on a velvet black tuxedo with a black bow-tie. Harry accidently mentioned that he looked like James Bond and had to explain that IT WAS A COMPLIMENT RON HE IS A VERY GOOD-LOOKING SPY RELAX.
-How are you doing?-she asked. And Harry realized that they hadn’t even talked properly since the beginning of the year. He definitely had been avoiding her,-I heard you didn’t make it to a Quidditch team.
Of course, he was too early. Draco showed up about an hour later, slowly walking into the library, saying hi to Madam Pince, as if no one was waiting for him, as if he hadn’t made any promises earlier.
-Not sure,-Harry mumbled. Ron and Hermione exchanged concerned looks and Ron raised his eyebrow, trying to make her understand what was going on.
Harry couldn’t tell if his face was sad or just peaceful. Still, he had an impossible urge to go up to him. Turns out he wasn’t the only one. Michael Harris and his little company slowly walked towards Draco, whispering something to one another. Once Harry saw those sly smirks and evil stares, he flew into the pub, pushing his way through the crowd full of bored teenagers and overtook the Ravenclaws. Potter basically fell into the seat opposite to Draco’s in the least graceful way possible, making Draco jump.
