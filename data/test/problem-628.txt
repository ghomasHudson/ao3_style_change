Then his eyes fell onto Neville's lap.
"Oh. Wasn't that already here, when we arrived?" Haley asked innocently, as she grabbed the book and put it on top of her pile.
I have to get out of here! I have to reach the door! Quickly. But there are about ten hippogriffs blocking my way. How am I supposed to get past them? Maybe I could try jumping. Who knows. It might work. I get myself ready for the jump of my life and soaaaaaar over the hippogriffs like a paper plane. It's a fun experience. Almost like a dream…
The girl stepped closer to him until she was only about three steps away from him. Then she reached up to her face and drew a wand from behind her left ear.
Sirius had said.
Potter blinked. Obviously she hadn't expected that. It looked rather cute.
"Er… not trying to burst your bubble, or anything," Lily spoke up. "But… if you really want to give it another try, we need to hurry. The potion draws most of its power from the full moon. Which will start receding around noon, so…"
"I can't stand her! She's driving me mad!" she declared, falling back onto Hermione's bed dramatically. "I'd much rather have Tonks in the family."
"You're coming to class, then?"
"You're a bit confusing, aren't you?"
"Neville said, him and Professor Lupin and Professor Dumbledore came to chase the Death Eaters away."
"I was… in someone's dream the other night… And then all of a sudden he disappeared and everything else vanished as well. Even the dream door. There was literally nothing there beside me." I end my tale with a shrug. It had been terrible. I had been feeling so lost and lonely. I don't ever want to repeat that experience again.
A tiny smile appeared on his lips just for a second. Then he said, "You should put in some effort. I have high expectations."
Somehow he wished she had read it. He didn't want to find out what was waiting inside.
Haley groaned, her head hitting the headboard with a thud. "I only remembered exactly how useless boys are."
Emily glanced over to the door quickly. Then she focused on the floor again. She seemed guilty almost.
In retrospect it hadn't been
"Um, right… I'll just…" She nodded toward the portrait door.
, Draco thought.
But what if he saw? What if he saw her memories of Malfoy? A cold panic was seeping into her bones –
Then, as if she was about to do something as unpleasant as collecting bubotuber pus, Hermione gave a deep sigh before looking into her eyes. "I'm worried about you, too." She admitted grudgingly. "And I'd appreciate it if you stopped snapping at me all the time."
"Professor Snape wants to see you."
"I didn't – I thought this was–" Draco stammered, gripping the covers as if he wanted to hide underneath them.
"What?"
"Well, I didn't tell you to eat that!" The girl burst out. What a lame excuse. Draco wanted to jump her. And not in a good way.
It's just me… and Malfoy. Who's fixing me with a weary look. I didn't think this through. What in Merlin's name am I supposed to do now?
"You're unbelievable," she said in annoyance, after having finally removed the last petal from her tongue.
Young Haley laughs loud and carefree and the sun catches in her hair, making it glow like an amber. "That's a stupid reason." She replies. "Come on, I'll show you how to play. It's fun."
. And she had said that she
? What use is a wand if it's not reachable? Honestly." Haley mumbled, fetching her own wand from the back pocket of her jeans. She looked at it for a moment before sticking it back in her pocket. "You're right. It
"You trust him, then?" She asked, her frown deepening.
"I'm not your ba– well anyway, when I told you what did you do?"
"Well done, you've captured my pawn." Baz sneered.
"Glumbumble," Malfoy scoffed derisively. "Yeah right." He rolled his eyes, sending Neville another venomous glance before strutting back to his fellow Slytherins.
And then she had heard a noise. But Justin had reassured her that it had probably just been a Bowtruckle or a Kneazle or something equally harmless.
"Maybe you could…" I stop myself, noticing how eager I'm sounding. "If you can't tell me… would you… tell my sister?"
"Sirius…" she breathed, regarding him out of wide surprised eyes. His beard looked like he hadn't shaved in the last couple of days and there were dark circles underneath his eyes.
But didn't everything that included him and the Gryffindor escalate quickly?
"No." Haley protested quietly.
Oh. Was he getting a little too excited? Haley snorted, her lips stretching into an amused smirk. She sat up properly and reached for one of the couch pillows, throwing it at the boy who caught it reflexively. Seeker instincts.
Haley gulped. She
"That sounds almost as convincing as your other excuse. When you said you wanted to send a letter early in the morning and lost track of time in the owlery." Hermione gave her a pointed look.
was the better word. "You almost sounded like my friend just now," he spat.
He snorted, tilting his head to the side. "A peace offering?" He scoffed disbelievingly. Haley nodded.
"The magic only works as long as we stay within the vicinity of the umbrella."
Haley nodded. "Come on." She raised her hand and knocked on the door.
book, could she?
said a voice in her mind. She knew that, of course. But she also knew that her dad would have been disappointed. If only a little. He would also be disappointed if he knew that she was letting a pathetic Slytherin boy mess with her. And that she wasn't brave enough to fight back.
She sighed. "Fine. I admit it. And no, I haven't answered yet. Not properly anyway."
Another voice made him halt in his steps once more. Was that… Umbridge?
But there was no time to linger on Weasley's strange behaviour. He'd spotted Haley, who'd helped Granger onto one of the thestrals. Now, she was looking at him in confusion. And she was covered in blood.
"Mum showed me how to attract them. It's not hard. You just need to set them on fire. A match works as well." There was a warm glow lighting up her face.
"I didn't poison it," he said, looking down at his hands, "anyway, your hand should definitely feel better now." He paused, frowning slightly, "It contains Murtlap tentacles. They are often used in healing potions. Not that
Haley looked at him as if he was a troll. Perhaps, not the best thing to say to your kinda-still girlfriend who you've been in a fight with and are trying to make up with.
could I like someone like
"What did you remember, sir?" Simon asked, picking up the napkin and wiping butter globs off his fingers. Haley grimaced. She would never get used to that.
In Hogsmeade. Last weekend. On Valentine's Day… But he'd been with Haley the whole–
"So… I'll talk to Ron if you want to. I mean, he's my brother and all but the constant brooding is really getting annoying. And the way he keeps glaring at everyone for no reason is starting to scare off all our potential customers and test subjects."
"Were you planning… on getting me something for Christmas?" She asked, straight to the point. She didn't have the patience tonight for beating around the bush.
The gentle clicking of the needles served as a comforting background noise. It was strange how little this bothered her. Even remembering the image of Ginny and Michael kissing wasn't enough to stir up the slightest feeling of sadness or envy or… hurt.
But she couldn't be sure. Maybe she was already dreaming.
"It's gone," he mumbled. "The fur. It's gone! I'm me again. I'm me!" He exclaimed happily. Haley nodded with a grin. And then he leaned down and rubbed his nose along the side of her neck. The gesture was strange and impossibly sweet at the same time. Well, at least the boy wasn't mad at her because of the toffee.
"You're here again," she tsks, "This is the fourth night in a row, isn't it?"
"Haley?"
Oh. He hadn't known about that.
"I – I… uh," she stuttered.
, she thought with a smirk.
I feel him watch me as I spread the colour expertly on the wooden boards. "What?" I ask after a while.
Looking like Christmas and her birthday had come at the same time, she pulled at Ron's arm, who was closest to her and ushered all of them to follow her. "I thought I could show you around first and then we can head down to the village. Is that okay?"
And there was something in the way she looked at him. Something new and different. A riddle, he'd been trying to solve for weeks. It absolutely drove him mad. What was the secret hiding behind her eyes?
"Do you get it now?"
"Go away then." He grumbles.
"I told you things about me as well, you know?" She said quietly. "Don't you remember?" His hand was right there, lying on the couch between them. Haley's fingers were itching to reach over and touch him. But she didn't know if she was allowed to. Was Draco still mad? Would he pull his hand away?
"Ah, Potter." He sounded bored but there was an underlying tension in his voice that Haley wasn't sure how to place. "If you," he cleared his throat. "If you have a moment." Hesitance. That was it… and… cautiousness?
Had she heard right? Painfully slowly, Haley turned back to Draco, scanning his face as if she expected him to laugh it off and tell her it was a bad joke.
. No… but
HALEY
Ginny, too, was watching the needles instead of Haley. Her eyebrows were knotted together as if she was thinking about something deeply.
"Lost in thought again?" Someone asked smugly, startling Draco so much, that he almost fell out of his chair. Damn. He didn't like the knowing grin on the blonde girl's face at all.
"It was a poem," Simon mumbles lowly, obviously embarrassed.
"But m– I mean –
"But if you liked kissing him–"
" Simon protested. Haley ruffled his hair fondly.
Monday morning and the Great Hall was still Draco-free.
Hermione snorted, sending Haley an amused look.
"He's lying," I tell him. "It's far too early for the letters. And you're not supposed to know spells before coming to school."
"Your eyes…" he continues. "They look… just like hers… even the glasses." He frowns.
It was magic. Maybe a different kind than waving wands and uttering incantations but definitely magic. She never wanted to let anything come between them again. Not even that pink elephant in the room that kept not-reminding her of all the things that made them different. That should divide them. The elephant could go look for its own room for all she cared. She hadn't invited it.
"Don't wanna talk," Haley mumbled, still facing away from her mum.
The girl grinned triumphantly. "So you
"So?" Hermione asked. "Are you going to go to the hospital wing to check on him?"
DRAGO
“Now you’re worried about me?” She fired back angrily.
"Excuse me?"
"Er… you really don't have to do that," she replied sceptically.
"Don't be mad," Malfoy calls after the girl, wearing my face. "Maybe you'll win next time." Is he talking about quidditch?
DRACO
"All right," Hedwig agrees. We fly through the night sky above the clouds for a bit longer in companionable silence. It would be nice if we could just keep flying like this forever. We could leave the disappointing reality behind and never look back. I wouldn't have to wake up and deal with everything that is waiting for me once I open my eyes. I don't want to wake up.
I pick up my brush from the ground and in less than a second I'm in front of my own picture again, drawing little devil's horns on cartoon Malfoy's head. Somehow, this escalates into a contest of 'Whose painting is the ugliest?' It's insane.
"It's fine." He responded cheerfully, walking on ahead up the stairs.
"Oh. Yes." She replied absently.
"Or has he? Anyway, I think the only thing you should be afraid of is him jumping you and snogging you to death."
Hermione wasn't sure what she had intended to say. And Haley didn't ask.
"I am not trying to tell you what to do. Or which choice to make. No one can take that from you." He stared into his teacup again. "But I want you to know that some things might be worth fighting for. And it may not always be easy to make the right choice but that does not mean there is none. There is always a choice. What you need to understand, however, is whatever you are is going to choose, you are the one who will have to live with it. So, you need to ask yourself, can you live with that choice? Or are you going to be that fool who regrets it for the rest of his life?"
"You can't seriously believe that."
"It wasn't meant as one!"
That couldn't happen.
"Hello Haley," Luna replied warmly. "Are you okay?"
"What you did in here in December a year ago?"
He got up, glancing away from her. “We should go back. You probably don’t want to miss another class.”
She was standing in front of the tables, wondering which spell was the best to get the work done in the quickest way.
HERMIONE
"You don't have to say that," she replied sheepishly.
," Haley continued, almost spitting the last word, "He's
Had it really been worth it? What if it hadn't been Sirius in her dreams? What if it was all just wishful thinking?
"What?" The boy's smirk froze at once.
The two girls glared at one another, the air around them electrified and loaded.
“I…” The question seemed to confuse him. Didn’t Slytherins have friends? He frowned. “Still… it seemed quite serious. Your fight.”
Haley sighed. "Still, let's talk to her first. All right?" She made a step closer and took his hand carefully.
"Here." He plucked up her hand and placed the charm in her palm.
She squeezed his hand one more time, causing the boy in front of her to grin even wider.
"I was losing myself, wallowing in my misery" he admitted. "I would have lost myself if it wasn't for you." His fingers drew invisible patterns onto the small of her back. It was oddly soothing. "You who kept bothering and irritating me."
She shook her head weakly, feeling her mind slip away.
The imposter seemed taken aback at that. Then he scoffed, crossing his arms. "That's the only thing you have to say to me?"
DRACO
"Bu-But he never… this isn't… it's unnatural. He must be plotting something. I'm sure of it!"
Ah. Now, I get it. Is this supposed to be some bro-bonding time thing, where he asks me how to get into my sisters – uh I mean –
Luckily the armchair was wide enough to fit two people comfortably, so when Haley sat down next to Ginny she didn't have to actually sit on her lap. From up close it was even more evident how guilty she felt.
"You want to play gobstones?" He asks me, gesturing toward the colourful stones that are strewn across his huge bed. "There's not much to do in here. And I'm not supposed to leave the room," he admits sheepishly.
"Actually, I should take even more points from you since you're out after curfew."
. He cleared his throat again.
To his amusement at least Malfoy was still wearing a pumpkin as a head.
Luckily, the door opened without creaking. That would have been too melodramatic.
"I'd never leave you because of a peculiar voice," Draco whispered, taking her face in his hands and leaning down. "There's much worse than that. A peculiar ear for example." He leaned in closer and pressed his lips to her earlobe. "Or a crooked nose." He nudged her nose with his own, before dropping a kiss onto it. He frowned, rubbing his thumb under her lower lip. "Or a weird froggy mouth." He kissed her lips softly, wondering if he would ever get used to the way his whole body started to tingle and his heart threatened to burst. It was the sweetest pleasure.
"You sure that's okay?" Ron asked. "You seemed a bit… I don't know… stressed at breakfast."
The moon.
The owl tilted her head to the side but didn't give her an answer. Haley sighed. She rested her chin on her arms and stared out into the night sky as if it held any answers. But the night was silent. And the stars didn't speak to her either.
Haley sighed in exasperation, resting her chin on her palms. "They'll have to." She narrowed her eyes dangerously. "And if not, well… I can't just
The crazy thing about this whole spectacle is that I can't see mum's wand anywhere. She did this without using her wand!
So instead, I push the broomstick into his arms and give him a good shove.
That made him chuckle. "What would be the point? You already know everything." He slung an arm around her waist. "Besides, I can hardly hide from someone who follows me into my dreams."
"There's a Hogsmeade trip planned for next weekend and I-"
"All right, all right," he conceded. He knew she was going to make him regret it if he took it too far. Also, he simply couldn't refuse her anything when she was pouting like this. Actually, it was an interesting combination of pouting and trying not to grin.
Just as he was putting the helmet on, he heard soft foot steps drawing nearer. They got louder and louder and Draco swore they passed him, but… there was no one to be seen! For a second Draco thought, he was hearing things. Then he remembered, how he had seen Potter's head floating in the air in Hogsmeade last year. It had to be an Invisibility Cloak of some kind. Father had told him once, that these cloaks were extremely rare. So of course the golden girl had to be owning one.
She scoffed.
"Huh?"
"Hedwig! I–" She jumped to her feet and glanced around the space but the owl was nowhere to be seen.
"You're awfully bold today," he drawled, lifting an eyebrow. "You're not planning on throwing me off the tower and getting rid of me, are you?" He stared into her eyes intensely, unconsciously leaning closer until he could even count the lashes that framed her green irises.
, Potter?"
"What…?" She whispered, feeling a hand on her arm, trying to steady her. She didn't understand. The words didn't make any sense at all. "That can't be… it doesn't make… he… what?"
He shook his head lightly. "Don't call me cute though. That's not an expression befitting a Malfoy."
A few metres in front of me two lanterns illuminate a bar stool that's placed in between them. And from the left Malfoy marches past me, heading toward the stool. In his hands he carries the acoustic guitar I've already seen, leaning outside his dream door. Is that what he meant by showing it to me? He wants to play the song for me? The boy takes a seat on the bar stool, slings the guitar strap across his shoulder and looks up at me with a shy grin.
instead. I'm sure it would have been fun."
"As convincing as that sounds, I'm afraid I-" She stopped herself. Was that the sound of footsteps?
"Good," Sirius breathed. A heavy sigh, emphasized his relief. "Oh right, before I forget," he said, taking a small box from the pocket of his sweater. "Here."
What was he saying? And why? Surely it was too cruel to taunt Potter after what she had just gone through? But what else was Draco supposed to do? He couldn't openly say something nice or comforting. Even if he wanted to.
That boy was too stupid. She was sure he knew exactly what she was hinting at. She pulled her hand back, shoving it into her pocket. "Forget it." She hissed.
"Hermione. Hermi-" Ron stopped himself, as he finally caught a glimpse of the person that had made Hermione halt in her steps. It was silent for a few seconds. Then Ron started to shout.
"Actually, my name is Dra–"
Hermione was quiet. Haley wasn't sure she wanted to know what her friend was thinking about so deeply.
. He's probably confusing me on purpose!
"Who says I forgave you?" She heard him ask into her hair. It made her stiffen slightly but really… after everything she put him through, why would he forgive her just like that?
Right. She had to keep a cool head. How did she turn him back? A spell, she needed a spell… and her wand! That was important, too! Why in Merlin's name couldn't she concentrate? Maybe it was because Malfoy, the cat, was immensely cute even though he looked as if he wanted to scratch out her eyes. This was stupid! Where was the wand? Right. In her coat pocket. Her pocket. There! She had it!
"Honestly, I don't think-" He kept arguing but Haley quietened him with a quick kiss.
–!" He breaks off before he can finish, looking at his hands in bewilderment. They're empty. His wand is gone. His gaze wanders up again until it lands on the wand that is lying there in Neville's open palm.
" She cried in horror, while another head appeared behind her, making it look as if she now had a different head. A boy's head.
Haley knew exactly what he was talking about. She let her head fall onto the table as well.
"Who's that from?" Hermione asked from the right.
“I thought you were my friend,” she whispered, breathing quickly. Everything she had been through since that Christmas. Neville could have prevented it all. “You should have told me.”
"That's just because people
When has this turned into a guessing game and why wasn't I informed?
As Hermione went through the people that had signed their list on Saturday, Haley noticed Ron staring at her from the side. Huh?
. I need to distract him.
"I'm sorry, I didn't know how, I – I–" Ginny half-sobbed, burying her face in Haley's shoulder.
"I see," he said, in a carefully neutral tone. Haley really didn't like that tone. It meant he was erecting a wall between them. She was glad there were still things she disliked about him.
Hermione chuckled. "If you want sugar-coating, you might want to go back to your own personal fan club. I'm sure the Creeveys already miss you."
"I know." Luna whispered gently, reaching over and squeezing his shoulder briefly. He felt incredibly young in that moment. Far, far away from home. With no one to show him the way or tell him what to do. Once, he'd thought his father was this all-knowing person who could solve anything. And now… he was about to be sent to prison. When had life become this hard?
" The sound of chirpy laughter fills my head. Is she speaking through her mind?
"Yes." Her lips formed the word without her consent. Why did she say that? What was happening? Was she possessed? Her heart was racing, reminding her of a frightened little bird. The rest of her was surprisingly calm, like she was somewhere else and someone else was navigating her body.
"Like me." Draco muttered darkly.
"Caught you!" Parkinson said gleefully. He'd totally forgotten about that annoying Slytherin.
"What the hell?" She exclaimed, staring at the grinning boy in astonishment. He had a strange hat with pink feathers in his hand.
He looked at her as if he already regretted his decision. Haley really hoped she wasn't setting him up for another crushed hope.
"Little Whinging… isn't that where your aunt and uncle live? It seems like someone caused real mayhem over there."
HALEY
"Well I…" she hesitated. "I figured, we'd skip?"
. And
(insert witty haiku)
Suddenly she felt like crying. "I…" She started to say but didn't know how to continue. Didn't know the words that would make everything right. Maybe those words didn't exist.
"What now?"
"You didn't have to be so petty, you know?" Hermione whispered.
The intensity seems too much for mere jealousy. I open my mouth to ask but Malfoy cuts me off before I can get out even one syllable.
"Coming!" George replied, winking at the two girls, before following Fred down the hall. Haley's eyes wandered from the two brothers who were already chuckling over something again to her friend. She was shaking her head disapprovingly but there was the hint of a smile, softening the expression on her face. George was right. It did suit her.
"How so?"
"Once or twice," Haley offered with a grin. Malfoy snorted but the corners of his mouth were definitely twitching. She wondered if he was disappointed that the noise had interrupted them earlier. If he was he didn't show it.
It's the one with the two big, black doors, that looks like the entrance to a castle. I stop to inspect it more carefully. On the right door there is a heavy knocker that looks like it's a snake made of silver. The snake's eyes seem to be glistening emeralds. Is this the door I've been looking for?
Everything looks brighter in the light of day. Haley assumed that was something Mrs Weasley would say. Funnily enough she found that it was true. Everything might not be magically okay but it didn't look as scary anymore. Of course life at 12 Grimmauld Place wasn't exactly rainbows and sunshine to begin with but it was better than being cut off from the magical world completely.
"I do," he replied quietly. "But I… would you mind if… just the two of us?" That wasn't even a complete sentence.
I lift an eyebrow. "So?"
It was the middle of the night, when Haley woke up. Stupid. Who brewed a potion in the dead of night? Apparently, Haley's mother. She sighed. Rubbing her eyes tiredly. It was way too early to get up. Maybe she could try and catch some more sleep…
As always leave me your thoughts if you feel like it and check out my new fic "Walking on Dreams" if you want to.
He gave a short chuckle. Then he looked up at her and met her curious eyes.
"Where's the guitar?" I wonder aloud.
"So… what do you think of all of this?" Luna asked.
When Haley raised one eyebrow at Michael in a challenging way, he seemed to awake from his stupor.
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy's fingers drew soothing circles across her back. It almost seemed like an answer to her thoughts.
Haley snorted. "You're so full of it!"
"Don't you like that guy?" He asks after a moment.
"Where am I? Where–?" She asked, fumbling for her glasses on the bedside table. They weren't there.
"Yes. And it's not a school book either. They don't look half as pretty."
"From Hogsmeade?" Neville reminded her.
Until there was no tomorrow left. There really was no avoiding it anymore. Haley would have to see him tomorrow. And before that she had to make up her mind about some things. What did she know?
"Because you – I–I – you're…" She stammered, unable to form a complete sentence.
"Oh, you were talking about my time machine," Draco chuckled condescendingly, "It may look like an umbrella but that doesn't mean it also works like that."
"But – this – this is
"Why can't you be this confident when it comes to staying by my side?" He asked quietly, more to himself.
She almost bounces over to the wardrobe, pulls something from it and walks back to me.
" Haley sobbed desperately. This had to be a nightmare! And there was nothing she wanted more than to wake up. That's when the laughing started. A cold high laugh reverberated over the graveyard turning Haley's blood to ice. She looked around and suddenly the graveyard was filled with people. Cloaked people in masks, who joined in with the laughing.
He scoffed. "You think I like you because of your looks?"
As much as he seemed to be trying, Draco couldn't stop grinning. "You sound like a house elf!" He snorted, trying not to laugh. "Are you okay?"
What? Why wouldn't she be okay? She wasn't the one whose family name had been tainted. It was
He picks an amber-coloured one. How strange. I could have sworn he'd take the-
But wait. What is happening? Malfoy wraps his arms around me and pulls me closer. In that moment it feels like my brain has temporarily shut down. Why is he hugging me? What did that look in his eyes mean? Why did he say my real name? Do I look like myself again? Why can't I even uphold a simple disguise? He tightens his hold around me and I just want him to let go. But for some reason my body feels like it's petrified. I can't move.
His wand aimed straight at her heart. He opened his mouth to speak but Haley couldn't hear a word he said. All she saw was cold, merciless eyes and a cruel smirk. And then… a flash of green light. That's when she found her voice again.
Honestly, he half expected her to push him away. Which she didn't do. But she didn't return the embrace either. For a few moments he held her like this, wanting to comfort her. And to be comforted as well. But something felt strange somehow. What was it?
My eyes are shut tightly as I'm waiting for the inevitable impact. But surprisingly it never comes. I continue to fall, wondering if I'm ever going to hit the ground, when something soft as a feather touches my cheek. Finally opening my eyes, I glance to the left. There's an owl beside me. Snow white feathers spread out to the sides. Is the owl smiling at me? I shake my head to clear it. The owl looks familiar… startlingly so.
"Get the hell away from my daughter, you bastard!" Somebody yelled.
Draco took a deep breath, as if he was getting ready for something. "Just tell me one thing," he whispered, eyes fixed on their joined hands. "If… if it had been me that night… instead of my father…" Slowly he looked up. "Would you have done the same? Would you have told them about me?"
Those words somehow got to him. Their genuine simplicity and the obvious intent behind them. The almost naive hope that was also mirrored in those impossibly emerald green eyes. It was her innocently pure and stubborn belief that there was a choice. That you didn't always have to do what was expected of you. That maybe there was something good in him, too. Potter did care about him. It hadn't seemed that way before but now… Why else would she be that invested in the matter? The realisation awakened a dangerous hope inside him and caused him to say something he wasn't sure he wouldn't regret later on.
She looked around.
Haley shook her head. "No," she whispered. "He didn't h-hurt me."
"So?" The singer asks moodily.
"Haley! Wait! What's wrong?" He questions, uncomprehendingly. He looks as if I betrayed him or something but I can't let that bother me now. I already regret coming here. Where is the stupid dream door? I look around frantically until I finally spot it at the back of the stage. I run toward the door without looking back.
What on earth was this girl talking about? Draco frowned.
"But you even went to the hospital wing!" She pressed. "And your hand?" She took a step closer to him, taking the glove off his previously injured hand and holding it up in front of her face as if she could see the traces of his injury.
"What?" The boy burst out in surprise.
After her shower, Haley quickly got dressed in a pair of tight-fitting jeans and a maroon sweater beneath her thick wine red winter coat. Her hair was piled up into an unruly bun that was still wet from the shower. With her hood in place over her head, her bag across her shoulder and her Firebolt in her hand, Haley finally left the changing rooms. The Slytherins were small green dots in the air. She sighed in relief.
"Snuffles?" Hermione asked, glancing over her shoulder. She nodded. Fortunately, Sirius had phrased everything vaguely enough so that no one who didn't know what he was referring to would actually get the true meaning.
There was a cheeky grin on her face. "I wonder
"Why are you doing this?" She didn't understand. Why was this affecting him so much?
"Dunno. He just said he wants to see you."
The silence that emerged then, seemed almost explosive.
Instead of answering, Snape only sighed and unlocked the door with a swish of his wand. "Goodnight, Draco." He said in a way, that made it clear, he was not going to answer the question. Well. That wasn't a problem. Surely, it wouldn't be too hard to find out on his own.
“Come. We have to celebrate,” he tells me, grabs my hand and pulls me toward the tall oak front doors. For a second I’m afraid the doors are going to lead out into the dream corridor but surprisingly we simply step into Diagon Alley.
After Binns ended the lesson, Hermione shot her another impatient glance but in the end rushed out of the class room without saying a word to her. Ron only sent her an apologetic look before following the brunette out. Haley sighed, finding the class room suddenly empty. It looked like she was going to have to sit with the Creeveys once more.
Maybe he even enjoyed doing something nice for a change. Or was that thought too optimistic?
The words made her halt after all. For a moment, it seemed like she was going to turn around and come back to him. Tell him, it was all a lie and kiss him until he forgot all of their problems.
She gaped at him.
reasons why she shouldn't have let Malfoy kiss her.
Then she pushes me out of the window. Her scratchy laughter follows me as I plummet into the darkness below.
seems like a fitting expression.
Haley bit her lips. "Well. He had some problems with his wand, I think. It would sometimes emit sparks or small bursts of fire. And there were instances in class where he would try a harmless charm and the object he was working on would go up in flames." Something else came to her mind. "And other times his spells seemed to go… overboard."
"Course." Haley almost pouted. He was so far away…
She sighed, gazing down at her lap, where her fingers were knotted together tightly. "You have to understand," she began quietly. "That what I'm about to tell you… I only did that because of the way you were treating me before. Because of the pranks and… and everything else you did to me." She looked up shortly but she couldn't read the expression on his face. She looked away again. "I… just wanted it all to stop. So… I figured out how to… " Shit. This was so hard. How was he going to react?
"Will.. you.. go to the ball… with me?"
Haley raised her eyebrows. "Are you kidding me? I remember
She shrugs. "The Resurgence Draught. That's the working title, anyway." She taps her pointer finger against her chin thoughtfully. "But you're welcome to suggest a better one."
The auburn-haired girl watched him for a moment. When had he become such a good friend? She doubted that he would be able to keep a secret from Hermione, though. He was far too smitten with her for that.
I sigh. This reminds me of something else. Another dream. Right. Hedwig did the same thing to me. Which makes me remember how scared
" She suggested, as they walked down the hall that lead toward the Defence Against the Dark Arts class room.
Sirius only snorted. "I don't need to look at that rubbish, I know it all."
"Surprise me," I reply with a shrug. He seems to think for a moment.
"She can't see me here," he whispered.
"How? I've never even tried a memory spell. Chances are I'll delete her whole memory or worse, my own."
"For you, too." It was a testament of how anxious he was about the exams that he didn't say anything on the lines of '
DRACO
," Haley said, drawing out the
"About what?" Haley repeated impatiently. He opened his eyes again.
"Just you wait," she whispered angrily. She was going to show him what she was capable of. It was time to fight back.
Haley frowned in annoyance. "But how am I supposed to do that?"
"Wait, that was you?" I remember how embarrassing the conversation with the Charms Professor had been.
"How do you know I'm allergic to strawberries?"
"I don't care if you're a wizard or not." She explained calmly.
"Shit." Simon cursed. Then he hurried out of his room with the face of someone who was about to die. Baz got up to follow him, amusement written all over his face.
A few announcements: So, I've decided to continue this in a seperate fic, meaning the next chapter will be the last (!) of the 5th year arch. But there will be a sequel (of this sequel xD). And I will tell you more about it in the next chapter.
"You're the best!" She exclaimed happily. "Thank you, thank you, thank you!" She could barely stop herself from squealing.
"I see. You must be eager to go on another date." She replied cheekily.
"Stop grinning. It doesn't mean anything." He drawled. Haley hadn't even realized she was grinning. But this was a good sign. It had to be.
Sirius nodded to the floor.
Perhaps… Had he been trying to say '
Haley snorted.
Draco shook his head and sighed tiredly. "I told you. There's no hope–"
Let me know what you think! And thank you so much for reading :)
"You can't go back on your word, now," he told her quietly.
He frowned. "What are they for?"
"I mean it!" Her blue eyes expressed nothing but sincerity. "I've never learned this much in any other Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson with any of our previous teachers."
If possible the boy's eyes widen even more. "I – It's – It's – Longbottom stole it," he bursts out and points one accusing finger toward something to his left. And interestingly enough, there in the right hand corner of the class room sits Neville. But as far as I can see there is only one wand in his possession.
"Voodoo Verses… Infernal Incantations… Singing like Sirens…" Luna read out the table of contents. All of this sounded really dark.
Those tricky trick steps!
" he drawled still with that indifferent voice, "should I believe
"Oh, is it? I didn't know." Draco answered innocently. He did know, obviously. Had even planned out in detail what he wanted to do and where he wanted to go with her. His heart was beating madly. She wasn't going to say no, was she?
"Don't worry about it," Luna said in her quiet and dreamy voice. "We're friends, are we not?"
He shook his head. That damn plush dragon was still hiding his face. Hesitantly, she pulled it aside to get a better look at him. Lying on her side, she tugged on one of his blond locks and gently tucked it behind his ear.
. All right. She could do that. It was the easiest thing in the world.
"Sorry, about earlier," Haley whispered, staring up at the canopy. "So… are the two of you dating now?"
Draco still didn't know what was best. For himself. Or his family. But it was about time he made that decision. And finally, now, he felt as if he had a real choice.
Of all the things I expected to walk into, it's definitely not the town I grew up in. Godric's Hollow. Or even more specific, the playground close to the woods where Simon and I used to play. Well, and all the other children from Godric's Hollow. And there in front of the climbing frame I see… myself. But I'm at least five years younger. The younger version of me is kneeling on the ground next to a collection of shiny gobstones. A younger version of Draco stands in front of her and glances down at her with crossed arms. I will myself into being small again like when I turned myself into a little fairy. I'm going to watch them for now.
Is he being serious? Or is he mocking me – my doppelgänger – like always?
"Oh! I know." She interrupted him, something was glinting in her eyes. Was that mirth?
"What about him? Did he ruffle your feathers again?" Hedwig asks and before I can think of an answer she starts to laugh. "That's a funny expression, really," She adds, once she has calmed down a bit. Who would have thought that Hedwig had a fondness for lame puns. But wait… what did she say just now?
HALEY
"Sometimes it's that easy." He shrugged.
"I guess, I'll go then?" He said it like it was a question.
. Just like… Damn it all!
"You dare?" She fired back. "You'd better promise not to pull this kind of shit again, or I'll
"Really?" She asked doubtfully.
"Excellent," Sirius said quietly. "Snivellus."
," the red-head hissed, while Draco pulled him down the hall, after Umbridge. He followed her extra slowly, so she was out of hearing distance.
She snorted. "Just… start with something basic? And don't blow up my room." She added with a frown.
Draco frowned slightly. "It's a magical vow… And technically, it
Now the Slytherin wasn't too sure whether he was indeed sleep-walking or not. And if he was… what kind of dream was this?
"Look," Lupin started. "I wouldn't like you to judge your father on what you saw there, Haley. He was only fifteen–"
That came as a surprise to Severus. "Certainly, you will tell Potter, though."
The boy grimaced. Her behaviour bothered him less than it should have. "Why do I even bother talking to you?"
"Look –" – "I –" They both said at the same time.
"I love that song," I exclaim, recognizing the notes at once.
. But judging from the shoes that had a strawberry print on them, it couldn't be him. Subconsciously, she reached for the necklace he'd given to her – it wasn't there. Right. She'd returned it to him. She clenched her eyes shut again. How foolish of her. She'd burned that bridge, hadn't she? He was never going to speak to her again. But she'd done it for Sirius. To get him back…
"Your dreams?" She asked breathlessly. "But you never… You dreamed of confessing your lo– your feelings to me?" She would have remembered that.
because of one missed class. She’d probably have to explain it to him, though, later on.
"Why'd you do that?" I ask, as soon as I've caught my breath.
"Caught him? What does he mean you caught him?" Ron asked.
With each word I say his face gets paler. Until finally he clenches his teeth and grits out, "Fine. I'll do it."
"Look Haley," Sirius began. "James and Snape hated each other from the moment they set eyes on each other, it was just one of those things, you can understand that, can't you? I think James was everything Snape wanted to be – he was popular, he was good at quidditch – good at pretty much everything. And Snape was just this little oddball who was up to his eyes in the dark arts, and James – whatever else he may have appeared to you, Haley – always hated the dark arts."
"Right. They don't seem like they get along well, do they?" Luna commented, leaning closer in order to inspect the picture. "Huh? I think I've seen that note book before."
done. Hours later, after the last questions had been sufficiently answered, they finally set down their quills and closed the last book.
." He growled.
She gazed into his eyes searchingly like she was trying to tell whether he was lying. "How do you know?" Haley asked sceptically. Her brows were forming a furrowed line. He wanted to run his fingers over them to smooth the skin. But she seemed so guarded. He doubted she would appreciate the gesture.
"What if it's just-" she bit her lips, wondering how to phrase it best. "You know, that thing you have… the saving-people thing."
The next ten minutes seemed to go by in the blink of an eye. In the lab downstairs, Neville and Professor Snape awaited them, the potion master urging them to hurry, lest the potion was rendered useless because of the fading full moon power.
"Enough with the flattery." I say, trying to will down the heat that's attempting to flow into my cheeks. I almost forgot how weirdly honest Draco tends to be in his dreams.
She rolled her eyes. "Soon."
"So?" Was this already her point?
"I got that. But… where do you want it? On the sides or…"
The Slytherin frowned. "But what if I get something I don't like?" He asked, sounding honestly confused. That boy really was ridiculous.
Till next time, Feather :)
Since last Christmas. He had known about Malfoy’s crush on her for more than a
And considering she isn't the only girl sitting at that table, how else would you know who I was talking about?"
"How do you know that?"
"Thank you, Haley. This really means a lot to me. I've been thinking about this so much, you know? I mean, clearly I was expecting Dumbledore to make
HERMIONE
There had to be a different explanation! Hadn't her mum told her that dreams didn't necessarily show the truth? But what had she seen then? Had it been no more than a strangely distorted coincidence? She wouldn't be able to find out unless she went back. Unless she visited his dreams again. But what if what she saw the next time was even more disturbing? No, she couldn't do it. She would stop this whole mess while she still could.
"Fine. I'll be nice," she relented.
"Don't worry so much." Mum says squeezing my arm. "I'm sure the little prince cares about you a lot as well. That's probably the reason he got so mad in the first place."
"Huh?"
"Definitely," Haley agreed, nodding her head enthusiastically.
kind of loony but she was also sort of his ally. She knew his biggest secret. So he'd make an exception. For now.
"Are you crying?" Haley asked her brother, quirking a brow.
"Then why…?" He asked, his hands falling to her waist automatically. "It's the finale… Won't they kick you off the team?"
Mum knocks at the lens of my glasses. "I know those glasses, poppet," she remarks with a grin.
His words worked like magic.
(See the end of the chapter for
"A tuning fork?" Ron questioned. "What's that?"
"So, what now?" He asked almost casually. "Was it fun? Digging around in my dreams? Playing with me?"
he wondered. Well, there was no use in asking another time. He was sure, she would tell him, when she was ready. It would be nice if she met someone who made her at least half as happy as Haley was making him.
. They were printed onto the front page of a copy of
Draco opened the envelope.
"Fine," she admitted. "Maybe I pushed you away a bit."
Noticing the wonder on Haley's face, Draco smirked. "Perks of the VIP lounge." He winked at her. "Also… they won't tell anyone they've seen us here together."
"Well, I guess it was just that
"You want to try?" He asks, holding his cone out to me. Is he delusional? I shake my head, not bothering with a verbal answer. He seems to wait for me to do something. Does he want me to return the offer? Well, in that case he will be disappointed.
He hooted softly, pressing his head against Draco's hand. He wanted treats. But Draco didn't have any here.
"Haley, look." Neville whispered insistently. She followed his gaze toward a small grey insect that was sitting between the tree roots and staring at them out of its big black eyes. "The glumbumble," he whispered excitedly.
Snape who was standing at the back of the room in front of a shelf, pointed toward the seat on the other side of his desk.
"You're not… still doing that, are you?" Hermione asked, ignoring her friend's outburst. "
' silently.
Watching the two children play feels like deja-vu somehow.
Malfoy was watching her with his silvery, grey eyes and all she could come up with was, "I don't know – it's – I just – I – I don't know what to say."
Haley wanted to block out the noise with her hands but she was too shocked to move.
"What do you mean you helped me through all the tasks…?" What was he on about? Had she missed something?
"We don't have time!" Haley exclaimed. There was a hint of panic in her voice, "Quick, we need to pack everything up! There's no time! Don't just sit there. Help me!"
was she doing?
. Like the world has turned upside-down.
He tried to pull his hand free but Haley held on tightly.
As always, thank you for reading and I'd love to hear your thoughts :)
He snorted. It seemed a little too forced. "Me? Jealous of that plant-crazy halfwit? Why would I-"
. The note didn't say more than that. But it was enough. Enough to make tingles of excitement run all over her body. Sneaking out proved to be easier than she had anticipated. Hermione had almost fallen asleep over knitting more of her elf hats and Ron had called it a night shortly after. Fred and George had started to test their products on students again and he had been reluctant to be the one to tell them to stop. Which was how Haley found herself slipping through the Fat Lady's portrait with a bag around her shoulder and two cloaks draped around herself. One kept her warm and the other invisible.
"Who could have sent it?"
This was it. Haley had no choice but to go back to the castle with her friends now.
"Have you started packing yet? You know you won't have much time tomorrow, before we're leaving." Lily said for the fifth time that day.
He scoffed. Was it that obvious? She looked at him as if she was waiting for him to explain. But what was there to explain? He couldn't bloody well tell her about the thing with Malfoy. Unless… she already knew. But no. That couldn't be right.
"Why don't you simply ask her?"
Malfoy chuckled darkly, "I brought this on myself," he whispered, "Of course you don't believe me. Why would you?" It was a question but he didn't give her a chance to answer.
"Oh," he said, seemingly surprised. "Well, you're probably right." Despite their words neither of them made a move to go.
"Uh… what?" Haley followed her quickly.
Sirius' eyes filled with worry. He jumped to his feet and knelt down in front of her. "What did that bastard do to you? Did he hurt you? I'm going to kill him," he growled. He seemed ready to jump out the window and hunt the boy down.
Have fun and keep reading, Feather :)
"Guess, we'll have to find out." He winked. His eyes twinkled mischievously. Haley wanted to kiss–
He closed his eyes and leant in ever so slowly, giving Potter plenty of time to stop him if she wanted to. Then he felt them. Soft lips touching his own, sending tingling sensations all over his skin. There were hands on his chest. Was she actually pulling him closer? He smiled against her lips. But no. She was pushing him away. What?
"You asked him out – that bastard. Right here. The same day,
(See the end of the chapter for
What even was this? If only she had known she had this kind of power before. Her life could have been a lot easier.
"I heard you the first time," Potter informed him.
, she was already halfway across the pitch. Running, because in her detached state of mind her instincts had told her to jump off the broom and just
Ravenclaws know best.
"I-" She looked at this desperate boy in front of her, who was staring at her as if the next thing she said was going to decide if he lived or died and wondered what it was that he wanted to hear from her. How was she supposed to fix this?
"Fine. Show me what that magic umbrella can do," she muttered, ignoring the triumphant grin on the boy's face.
They left the pub together and once they stood beneath the sign of the Hog's Head, Hermione gave her a brief hug.
Reluctantly Haley pulled away.
, she thought, as the sun was setting in front of her.
His eyes softened somewhat. "Okay. But then… Malfoy… you – you weren't serious, earlier, right?" He shook his head, a pleading look on his face. "You don't – him and you… you're not seriously…"
"Haley, I -" Ginny began, but she was interrupted by the two arms that were encircling her.
What the-? Who had said that? Draco turned around and found a girl standing there.
I shoot him a pointed look. "You've never looked into a mirror?"
" She snorted. "It was merely a
The words made him shudder. But…
"Was." Haley frowned.
“I’ll ask you a question and you have to answer it by writing the answer onto my hand.”
There he went again, that smug idiot. She was wasting her time. "Well, it's not like your answer is going to be a big surprise. You're a guy after all."
There was a pang somewhere in her chest but Haley ignored it. She had done nothing wrong. Or maybe she had done everything wrong but in her exhausted state of mind this was hardly the moment to question her latest life choices.
"Fine," she found herself saying with a sigh, although there were a thousand voices in her head screaming that she needed to take him to the hospital wing. But the vehemence with which he was putting up a fight moved her. She had the feeling it had really hurt his pride what had happened tonight and for once she didn't want to embarrass him further. She wanted to see him smile again. She also didn't want to deny him this little wish after what he had gone through tonight.
"Ask him what?"
"I've got my sources." He winked at her. "Besides, you're starting to look like yourself again. And I don't think anyone is going to find us in here."
Draco eyed her disdainfully. "I can see that. I
"What is it?" The Ravenclaw asked, having noticed the staring.
Neville looked at his hands that were hidden inside the long sleeves of his robes. He shook his head, as if to clear his mind.
Okay. She could do that. Think of nothing. Nothing. Nothing…
"On three," Neville agreed, sitting up a bit straighter.
Draco cleared his throat. "So… you're telling me I should-"
Draco took his time, reaching for the second cup of tea in the middle of the table and taking a few small sips. When he finally lowered the cup to the table again, he cleared his throat importantly. "I could. My
, he'd said,
"Love you, baby bro," she said, as she gave him a loud smack on the cheek.
"You're my
After a while, he had to pull away from her though, meaning she had to do her best returning his soft smile.
I gently take the quill from his hand and start to write two words on his skin. When I’m done I put the quill down.
"Be quiet!" He cried, getting to his feet. Away from her. "You had no right! How dare you sneak into someone's head – How – I – Not even father – I –" He buried his hands in his hair, tugging at it violently. He looked so utterly pained. It broke something inside her.
"Yes," Potter answered. She sounded confused about the question, "Why wouldn't we?"
"But… why?" Ron finally blurted incredulously. "I mean – I never understood what you saw in him in the first place… but… still…" He turned to Hermione. "Doesn't it seem pretty sudden?"
. The fact that she had found herself in a similar situation when she first woke up today wasn't lost on her. It was all so frustrating. First she had thought, she had finally everything under control and now… how had it all escalated that quickly? She didn't even understand what was going on any more.
"Why? What happened?" Hermione asked, who had obviously not been able to see her own head disappear.
Suddenly, he had an overpowering urge to storm out of the office. To flee. "Well, if that's all I'm going to-"
Draco still looked torn between running after the kid to lock her up in the dungeons and staying put. "What if she doesn't keep her word?" He mumbled gloomily. "What if she tells everyone? What if dad finds out? He'll kick me out for sure – what will I do then?"
It seemed so fragile… the moment. Like a storm was starting to brew around them and they were standing in the middle of it. It was always calm in the eye of a storm. But one wrong step could potentially send them into chaos and oblivion. But there was a different possibility as well. Another step might lead them to an entirely different place. A new world. Unknown but immeasurably beautiful. She wanted to see this world so badly. And she wanted to discover it together with Draco. Without having to hide her face underneath an Invisibility Cloak. Maybe there was hope yet. She could feel it. There was change in the air.
As they made their way over to the tree trunk the conversation between the two boys seemed to turn into an argument. They were standing close together and Malfoy had gripped the collar of Neville's robes.
"Why won't you take my side?" He whispered softly, his fingers sliding down to her arms.
She wondered which he was going to opt for today.
"But if I was." He insisted.
"What is that supposed to mean?" Malfoy asked, almost dangerously.
"And you are going to do what? Play the white knight in shining armour?" He snorted. "What would your father say?"
with her. Of course it was the truth. How could he not have known it all along? The realisation filled the boy with a feeling of elation that seemed completely out of place considering the situation he was currently in.
Pillow Talk with Hermione
Simon didn't look impressed, "I'm not your ba-"
Damn, when had he learned to resist her kitten eyes? She didn't want to see the triumphant look on her mum's face.
And Haley turned the other way to follow her own heart.
As she was lying inside her bed that night, she couldn't stop herself from worrying.
"No one! I mean, of course Ron… Hermione." Haley laughed awkwardly, desperately hoping no one had noticed her near-slip-up. For a moment everyone eyed her suspiciously. Then they looked away from her again but Haley could swear she'd seen the Luna girl grin in a knowing way and raise one eyebrow behind the magazine she'd been reading the whole time. What had that been about? Well, anyway, Haley had to try and calm down, if she wanted to survive the ride. She had no reason to feel this anxious, she
We sit down to eat our ice cream at one of the tables in front of the parlour. The sun is shining and it feels like late spring or early summer. I hear birds chirping and while I lick my ice cream I notice the boy, sitting opposite me, stare at me, an annoyingly smug grin on his face. It gives me the feeling that we're playing some kind of game that I don't know the rules of and he's the one winning.
"Um..." Haley was confused, to say the least. What did Luna have to do with all of this? Why had she covered for her? Did she know about her and Malfoy?
"Didn't Angelina tell you not to skip meals? You weren't in the Great Hall, so I thought… I wanted to make sure…" She twirled her thumbs fidgety.
"Oh. Well, you never said to relay it word-by-word. Where is the creativity in that?" Luna said innocently.
"Shit, shit, shit." She cursed under her breath. What was she supposed to do?
"All healed up. I told you it was nothing." He wished she would just let it go already.
Draco scoffed and glanced away. "You could at least make her forget what she heard."
, Haley thought, after she had finally completed the last evening of detention on Friday night. Would the wound on her right hand ever completely heal again? Her skin was burning like crazy. And as if that wasn't enough, she was practically asleep on her feet. Her nights with Umbridge had forced her to try and finish all of her homework until late into the night. She didn't remember the last night she'd slept more than four hours.
He pulled back his hand at once. As if her words had turned it into something foul and repugnant.
Ron, who sat on the windowsill to the left, rolled his eyes disdainfully. "Listen, no bloke in his right mind is going to fancy Tonks when Fleur's around."
From inside, the tree house was inviting as ever. The only thing that didn't quite fit into the picture was the broken guitar next to the couch. Someone had tried to fix it with spello-tape.
"So… you have to press this button," Malfoy explained, while pressing a round silver button above the handle of the umbrella, "And then it records the… essence of the people that sit underneath it."
She shook her head. "I was thinking a lot… in the beginning. Fighting all of this for a long time… I doubted him… doubted everything… even my
"You heard her," Luna continued. "She hasn't given up yet."
Then she turned to him, as if he was the one who was to blame for her disappointment. There was so much anguish in her eyes. A short painful ache went through his heart. It was almost unbearable to see her like this. He wanted to comfort her somehow. But how?
But she couldn't let him finish the joke. Not this time.
"We should really use that prank book you got from your dad, don't you think? Just to scare him a bit. I mean, we won't tell Hermione, of course. Let's do that, eh?"
Draco sighed impatiently and pulled the book over to his side. Perhaps, he'd find their potion master in there at least.
She took Haley's hand gently, stopping her friend from rubbing her skin raw.
Haley looked at Neville expectantly.
“Are you sure?” He asked. “I mean, would you like to talk about it? What were you fighting about?”
"Damn it!" Malfoy exclaimed as he let his hand fall to his side so forcefully that Haley almost flinched.
. She refused to call it a
"Ow, what the…" he complained, rubbing his shin irritably. When he looked up he quickly spotted the source of the sudden aggression.
Was that boy insane? Did he know what he was suggesting right now?
"It's not like we're in a war." Haley rolled her eyes. "Do people actually still care about this whole bloodline rubbish?" She clucked her tongue. "They don't mind as long as I'm happy, I guess."
. Earlier it had probably been a mere slip because she had been under stress. But now? He was sure she had used his first name deliberately. And she had
He stared at her, questioningly. Haley wondered if his eyes were going to be filled with hatred and disdain within the next seconds. She placed her hand on top of her godfather's and pulled it down into her lap, where she clutched it between her own two hands. His fingers were calloused and warm. The warmth gave her hope.
"Where are we-?" I protest weakly. A little girl shouldn't be this
"I know what a Christmas list is," she bit back with a glare. Malfoy simply raised his eyebrows at her mockingly and smirked in that way that used to make her blood boil. Now, she found it only mildly annoying.
. His legs were shaking. They wouldn't hold him much longer. Before his knees hit the ground, there was something underneath him. A chair. Huh? That hadn't been there a second earlier. He opened his eyes, noticing that Snape had taken a seat opposite him on the other side of his desk, his fingers interlaced on top of the table. It was impossible to guess what he was thinking.
Haley still wasn't completely sure Lucius Malfoy had not been there voluntarily. She refused to see him as the victim here. On the other hand though… Draco was right. If he hadn't followed Voldemort's call, the bastard would have made him and his family pay. The thought made her shudder.
"I'm not a house elf," he grumbled, but went into the house nonetheless.
After potions they made their way over to Hagrid's for a lesson of Care of Magical Creatures. With the Slytherins again. Malfoy was ignoring her as he tended to do lately. They were supposed to look for glumbumbles today, working in pairs.
"Maybe…" he mused, his fingers dancing over her wrist. "But I can still catch you."
Ginny rolled her eyes.
What the actual hell was going on?
He felt so incredibly torn. Every time he saw Haley he wanted to go talk to her and run away at the same time. It only made it harder how tired she looked. As if she hadn't slept in days. And he only caught glimpses from afar.
"Haley, love," mum starts to say and takes one of my hands gently, "I want you to remember that whatever it is you're going to find out, it's still a dream in the end. And dreams don't always show us the truth. Sometimes they show us our wishes or desires or even our fears. And no matter what you're going to see or whose dream you're visiting, you need to consider carefully what you're going to do with the information you acquired. You need to remember that dreams are a very private thing that sometimes represent us in our most vulnerable moments."
"Of course," Draco called, grabbing Weasley's arm once more and walking faster.
her. And the most terrifying thing was that… it didn't feel unpleasant. Not in the slightest. It felt… nice. And also really soft because his lips were as soft as a freaking feather. Did he use lip balm or something? She wouldn't be surprised about that. It was also soft because his lips were moving over hers so gently. Hesitantly almost, like he was afraid of something. But what could he be afraid of? Kissing wasn't dangerous, was it?
"Then why-?"
But the left door doesn't fit in with the image. There is a big poster of the
She knew it couldn't have been this easy. Holding her breath, the girl turned to her friend again.
, she thought dejectedly.
"S-sure," he said, taking a tentative step inside and then walking more confidently. After a little moment of looking around awkwardly, he sat down across from Haley and Neville, next to Luna.
"What is the meaning of this?" Snape asked, his voice a dangerous whisper.
Snorting, she walked over to the bathroom. Simon was going to be mad. But as long as Draco was distracted, all was well.
Haley rushed over to Draco. He had even cut his left hand on the shards of whatever had crashed to the floor.
