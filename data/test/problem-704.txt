Narcissa smiled, reached over and gave Draco’s other hand a squeeze and walked out flanked by the aurors assigned to her.
“I told you it wasn’t working out and that’s because...” Harry trailed off for a minute to take a breath, “I’m gay.”
Then they were lead on a tour of campus by an upperclassman named Jennifer, who said she was an architecture major. She skipped some of the history that had been standard on the tour Harry had gone on when he was college searching and instead told stories and traditions about some of the places they passed.
They decided to go to St. Mungos for dinner that night. Hermone spent the afternoon pouring over the lesson plans
The next two chapters will be up on Thursday! Please leave us kudos and some comments! Love you all!
“Thank you.” Harry took the paper and went to pick up his order where the employee called his name at the other end of the counter.
Draco decided that he wasn’t hungry and left the hall, with one final glance in Potter’s direction. Granger seemed to be worrying over something, per usual.
Harry had arranged a meeting with McGonagall a week after exam results were expected to come out to discuss him returning to be a full time teacher the next year. He was excited about the prospect of becoming a teacher, even more so than he had been about becoming an auror in previous years.
It was nearly a half hour later that Harry finally spotted the snitch. It was hovering just by Malfoy, almost exactly what the snitch at tryouts, why did the snitches like Draco so much?
All of the eighth years were in higher spirits after winning the house cup and the Quidditch Cup (yes they did that) and they seemed to have forgotten any animosity that they had held towards Draco. Though Draco suspected that their new found friendliness had something to do with all of the Daily Prophet’s articles regarding his relationship with Harry.
He read it through once more before deciding it was high time to construct a response. Then he remembered Harry’s gift to him. He had been so focused on the words themselves that he had forgotten about the gift entirely.
“Yeah. They were my older cousins, haven’t really talked to Narcissa since high school, I think she married her high school and college boyfriend. That door is the bathroom.” He pointed to a door that he passed, “Andie was disowned when I was younger so I’ve had no way to contact her. I think she and Narcissa kept in touch.”
She hugged him tightly and then he was walking up the steps of the train, walking down the corridor. Sitting, alone, in his old compartment.
Back and forth and back again. Draco could see that it was wearing on Harry’s nerves, but he could not get himself to stop.
Draco returned twenty minutes later with a bundle of food. He climbed into the bed next to Harry and laid the little picnic bundle on both their laps.
Twenty minutes later, he couldn’t help himself. He knew they were just about to reach the pinnacle of what was considered to be scary about this movie, so he took the opportunity provided to him and snatched up Harry’s hand. Worse come to worse, he could play it off as being so utterly terrified by the movie that it left him with no other option. He was glad though when Harry didn’t react to the gesture at all.
“You ready to go?” Hermione popped up behind him, she held a few books, a new box of colored pens and highlighters, and a day planner that she had already purchased.
Draco still hadn’t come down by the time breakfast duty was finished. Harry snagged some toast, an apple, and a bottle of pumpkin juice to take up to Draco.
Harry did not want to imply that he forgave her. Too many people had pried too far today. “Thank you for the apology.” He turned back to his food and ate in silence.
Draco kept his head down, but still, he could feel the eyes of those around him staring. His hand went to his forearm again. Draco forced himself to calm down, to breathe.
“I’m sorry. When I saw you kissing Malfoy, I freaked out. I guess I never thought you two would actually like each other. I suppose I needed a bit of time to process what I saw. I want you to know I really don’t care who you date so long as they treat you well. I can tell you’re really happy with Malfoy. I noticed you and him weren’t talking though, I hope everything’s all right and I didn’t mess things up between you.”
“Oh I see why you want to stay.” Pansy said, seemingly just noticing Harry, “We’ll stay and finish our date while Harry closes and you finish your paper.”
“Well, we have enough for a game with four sets of chasers and four keepers, including myself. I’ll rotate you every ten minutes. If you have done keeper, tie one of these,” He held out a bag of neon yellow ties “to the end of your broom. Once everyone has one we’ll move onto the next part.”
One of the members announced Amycus Carrow who came in and testified, though all he said was that he threatened Draco into using the cruciatus curse. Dolohov was then led in and he basically insulted Draco the whole time.
Draco had a hard time packing his trunk. After living with Harry for this long, it was hard to say goodbye, hard to know their time together was coming to an end. He knew that Harry would be able to visit him, they’d be able to have dates and write to each other, but it wouldn’t be the same. Draco wouldn’t wake up next to Harry every morning, wouldn’t fall asleep to Harry’s soft snores.
Harry kept his eyes open, looking for the snitch. Every once in a while he glanced around and looked not see if Draco had signaled a play or if the Gryffindor seeker, Layla Andrews he believed her name was, had spotted the snitch.
That night at dinner Harry was in much higher spirits. He still felt tired and worn out, but that could be due to not sleeping much lately. Both he and Hermione were eating dinner at the staff table. Most of the rest of the teachers had clocked out for the weekend, leaving the only other teacher being Professor Barlow. She and Hermione were talking animatedly about some Muggle TV show Harry had never heard of, leaving his mind to wander.
“What’s wrong Dragon?” Harry asked him the third time he had gotten up, walked around the study table and sat back down.
“Today’s class should be easy,” Hermione went on, “Since none of you have had an actual defense class in at least a year we are just doing a baseline assessment. You will be split into two groups based on room number, I will put you through a theory test.”
The next morning Draco’s alarm on his wand went off, shrieking and buzzing, but Draco didn’t feel like moving, Harry was so warm and soft pressed up against him. However, it seemed as though Harry had over ideas as he flung himself across the bed and smacked the wand onto the ground.
“Oh, I’m sorry, I thought you might have some interesting perspective, not many people grow up in the Muggle world and are aware of magic. I assume your relatives were though, since they had to know how your parents died.”
“Draco Malfoy, where do I start? Well I guess I should start with he can’t be all that bad if we can share a room for almost three months without irritating each other too much. I really do think that Draco Malfoy is not a bad person, and he is most certainly not a killer. Most of you do not realize I was on that tower the night Dumbledore died, he was killed by Severus Snape, a form of assisted and dramatic suicide. Even if Snape had not shown up that night, I do not think that Draco would have been able to kill Dumbledore. Draco just isn’t a killer.” Draco was surprised to realize that Harry didn’t seem to hate him after all.
“Oh, uh,” Neville stuttered, looking like a deer in the headlights. “Well I live with my Gran, and she liked this school for me, my parents went here, its where they met each other and fell in love, so there is a lot of sentimental value in this school. I think my parents would like to know that I was going here.” At the confusion evident in Draco and Blaise’s expressions, he added, “A serial killer got them when I was a baby.”
. And Draco intended to use it to its full extent. So, without another word, he stood and crossed the room, placed his hand against Potter’s chin, cupped his face, tilted it up and then they were kissing. And unless the alcohol was making him hallucinate, which could very well be the case, Potter was kissing him back.
Embarrassment filled Draco at his unruly mind, as he quickly shoved the thoughts away. He had always managed to hide that side of himself, he wouldn’t allow those thoughts to intrude now. No one could ever know... especially not Potter.
“Okay, I guess. That’s not what I was hoping for, but it’s better than nothing. Aside from that what should we do this afternoon?”
Harry draped the invisibility cloak over himself so he wouldn’t be detected on his way into town. One of the benefits of his junior teacher, and probably his war hero, status was that he could head into Hogsmeade whenever he wished.
He had been buried in books and slices of parchment, in the spot most similar to a corner, in the eighth year common room. This happened to be the little nook beneath the boy’s staircase. Granger had taken up the opposite spot on the girl’s side. Draco couldn’t help but notice that Potter was sitting off towards the side as well, with Longbottom and Weasley. Longbottom was working on something that seemingly came ease to him, Draco suspected Herbology since that was his best class by far. Potter was pouring over a long piece of parchment, with minuscule handwriting, likely lesson plans from Granger. Weasley was staring distantly out onto the grounds, a look of utter confusion plastered to his face, and his homework, long forgotten upon the table.
“How were your Christmases?” Draco asked them, more out of a need to pass the time than anything else.
So Draco told him, about being roommates with Harry, being Quidditch captain, top of the class in Defense, second in everything else, becoming friends with Harry, all of it. When he got to the bit about Harry being his boyfriend, he paused, scared and unsure, but his dad seemed so eager and proud, that he took the chance, went ahead and said it, damning the consequences. His dad’s face morphed to one of shock, surprise, but not disgust or horror or anger and he didn’t seem to be looking for a way to use the relationship to his advantage. That was as much as Draco could hope for.
“I’m double majoring in mathematics and anthropology.” Hermione smiled, “It’ll be a lot of work but I can’t just pick one.”
“Remember that we aren’t going easy on you. And that you actually have to know the theory Ronald.” Hermione reprimanded.
It was the next morning now, a Saturday, which meant he had the whole day off from classes. So did Harry, but he was at Rise and Grind until four.
“Harry.” He smiled as Mr. Orange wrote his name on the cup in sharpie and passed it to one of the other employees handling the food. Harry noticed the help wanted sign again, he did tell his mother and aunt that he’d get a job, “You’re accepting applications?”
Harry gave them an incredulous look. It wasn’t that the plan was stupid, it was that two of the biggest high school troublemakers had chosen professions with high responsibility that made Harry hesitate. The plan wasn’t actually bad. Pansy and Hermione had plans to have some alone time after their exams wrapped up this week, so he’d have the room to himself Friday. If he remembered correctly Draco’s last exam was on the same day. Their other friends still all had at least one exam left after Friday, so if Draco didn’t want it to be a date he had an excuse to fall back on for only asking him.
Pansy gathered up the group and led them to the ride area when the time came and they all climbed aboard the hay lined flatbed that was being pulled by a tractor.
Brittany laughed uncomfortably and ducked out from the girl’s grasp. She was very clearly drunk. The girl reached for another drink that was sitting at a nearby table, but Brittany intercepted her. “I think you’ve had enough for the night.” The girl stumbled, only further proving Brittany’s point. Brittany turned to Draco and Pansy and muttered, “I’m going to get her back to her room.” Before she quickly began to lead the girl through the crowd. Draco watched them until they’d disappeared within the midst of people entirely.
Finding a group was easy, since Harry was standing with the right amount of people anyway. They colored the ends of their brooms a Gryffindor red and took to the air, Neville was actually decent at flying, for being so nervous.
When he woke up the next morning, Harry was gone. It had been too much for him to hope that Harry would like him too. And what had he been imagining, some epic revelation on Harry’s part resulting in a long make out session? Of course not. But he had hoped for something, not this silence, this avoiding him.
He ended up at the park in the center of the campus, filled with little paths and benches shaded by gorgeous lilac and cherry trees, as well as the usual pines, maples and oaks. He settled himself in the grass beneath a particularly large cherry tree in full blossom. The pink petals littered the grass around him and he suddenly wishes he had brought his camera. The contrast between the light pink petals and the deep green of the grass would have made for magnificent photos.
Maybe it was the newfound truce or Harry’s tired state, but he went the truth. “Nearly everyone I know has had terrible nightmares this summer. It became normal to wake someone up from them.” He took a breath then added “I get them too.”
“You gawked at Bill the first time you met him, you’re barely affected by Veela, you stared at Cedric a little too much, and were extremely shaken after he died, though I don’t blame you for that, and then you were totally obsessed with Malfoy back in sixth year. Honestly I don’t really care who you date, never have, so long as it’s not him or someone in it for the attention. Though I trust you to be able to find the guys that don’t care about the boy-who-lived stuff.”
“Your drink will be right up.” Harry breathed a sigh of relief, at least he didn’t embarrass himself that much.
It had started with Draco’s response to Harry’s note from the first night of the new term. It had been a day or two later and Draco had talked about how his friends had had a bet on them. That had made Harry laugh for a good ten minutes. Draco had also asked for specifics about the date. Harry had told him that it would be after hours on Saturday, a week from when he had replied. They would head out at eleven thirty, since the area they were going to was checked first after the eighth year curfew. It seemed late, but it was a Saturday so they had Sunday to catch up on sleep.
At the end of their last class for the week, Pansy came up to Harry- who was at his desk- slapped a note down, and left the room.
Ginny and the other Gryffindors came over and congratulated them on their win and then they headed their separate ways to the changing rooms.
Draco wondered if he should awaken him. But he soon thought better of it. Potter may well slit his throat if he disturbed his sleep.
She slid onto the desk next to Ron and rested her head on his shoulder “You boys have your little talk?”
“I see, so you actually do know to try not to get in trouble.” There wasn’t any malice in the words.
Harry stood up and placed the wide eyed Teddy into Draco’s lap. Teddy twisted to look at who he was sitting with and then his hair turned from the neon orange it had been to a platinum blond.
Visibility was steadily shrinking, so much so that after another hour, Draco couldn’t see from one end of the pitch to the other. He doubted that the spectators were enjoying their time, drenched and unable to see what was happening.
Harry was pretty sure Draco wasn’t telling the truth, but he left it alone, “Ok, we’ll just chalk it up to the alcohol and forget it happened.”
“It’s the house partly, of course I’ll be glad to see my mum again, but I loathe that house. But majorly, I’ll miss this, you, us... being here together.” Draco mumbled, embarrassed with himself.
“Can anyone tell us what charm we were studying way back in March before Easter hols?” Asked Hermione, “Hannah?”
And Draco said the words aloud, partly because he knew his dad needed to hear them, and partly because he needed to say them, “I forgive you.”
“Kind of. I remember seeing that line, now that you mention it, I just never thought to ask about it.”
Draco let go of Harry’s hand the moment they had crossed over the threshold of the room he had been tried in. It was as though he was only just coming back to his senses, as the relief that had been clouding his judgment cleared away. It was like being doused in freezing cold water, leaving him numb and painfully aware, all at the same time.
“We all still have NEWTs this spring. Even Harry and I. Also our grade is based on how we correct student assignments. Professor McGonagall said she’d pull an essay from each year a month and base how we were doing on the mistakes we caught, she also will sit in on some of your practical exams.” Hermione continued.
The alarm he had set on his phone to remind him to go to lunch with Hermione went off scaring him out of his thoughts. He closed up his laptop and headed out towards the dining hall.
Okay so two changes in terms of updates, Tay and I are starting to have lives and stuff again so we are doing one chapter a week and switching off weeks. Also we’re switching the order in which we do our chapters.
He hated dancing around it like this, pretending everything was fine, when it very clearly was anything but. Molly took a long time saying goodbye, though from what she had told Draco, this was far from the first time she’d said goodbye to a child.
and he had been made quidditch captain because of that, even though he felt like one of the older girls should have had it. He never wanted his name to have been put in the goblet of fire. No one asked him if he wanted to be the one who had to kill Voldemort, though he wouldn’t have said no. And of course his teaching was based on stories McGonagall had heard from the members of the D.A.
Harry had left the bottle in the mini fridge in his room when he got back. He decided not to put it off any longer, he would study after asking Draco.
Sure he had yet to officially tell even his closets friends about that one. Hermione, Luna, and Ginny knew, but that was of their own devices. He and Draco seemed to have an unsaid agreement not to be obvious about their relationship, but also not overt. It seemed to be working well.
“It’s only been two month longer than normal ‘Mione. We both chose not to go to Camp Evergreen this year.”
“Right.” Draco said dully. “Have either of your parents said anything to you about it? Being so far away- and being here?”
The next morning Harry awoke to the alarm on his phone going off. It was six am, his battery life was just hanging on by a less than ten percent thread. He and Draco had been curled up together asleep on the couch. The TV had at least timed out at some point during the night, so at least the noise didn’t keep anyone up. Harry tried to get up but found his arm was trapped under Draco.
He had to get some sleep for his morning hall shift so he wrote a note to Draco so that he wouldn’t think Harry was blowing him off or avoiding him.
Harry couldn’t help but notice Draco hadn’t come down for breakfast. Of course Hermione noticed that he noticed and gave him a look.
He internally sighed as the Witch listed off his achievements. He stood up anyway and entered the witness area head held high. He chose to stand behind the chair, he had had enough of sitting to day and he needed to make an impact.
Draco sighed and collapsed onto his bed, staring up at the ceiling. If Ron wanted to be a child about this, then so be it. Either they’d become friends and put everything behind them, or they’d stay out of each other’s way. It didn’t matter all that much when Draco really thought about it.
Draco’s step faltered. He ducked his head and said, “Sorry, I’m just worried, is all. What with my mum’s trial coming up and... yeah.” He trailed off, his eyes on the floor. He looked up then, straight into Harry’s bright green eyes, unlike any he’d ever seen, and asked, “You’re testifying, right?”
“Well done Mr. Malfoy, I think that wraps it up for now. Hermione has a special homework assignment for you, so go take your seats.” Harry went over and picked up his wand. He knew he could have blocked the last spell if he really wanted to, but he also knew that Malfoy, needed a confidence boost, and probably would gain better control over his own wand from disarming Harry. He had sent the wand back via owl post without much to say, but figured that its loyalty needed to be won back from himself.
“They hated me, the dark skinned, magical, orphan, dropped on their doorstep in the middle of the night one November. To them I was everything not ‘normal’ and therefore not right with the world. Didn’t help that I’m not straight, like hell I’d ever tell them that though. Until my first Hogwarts letter arrived, they made me sleep under the stairs in a little cupboard.”
“Woah. Chill.” Neville said, grinning and putting his hands up in a placating gesture. “He was looking at you the same way you were looking at him, that’s all.”
They walked around Hogsmeade for about twenty minutes before Harry heard a familiar voice call his name.
He got lost in his work, so when Potter entered the room, he didn’t even notice. By the time he resurfaced from his ancient runes essay, he was at twenty seven inches and it was dark outside. He glanced at his watch and was shocked to find that it was nearly two in the morning.
Potter wheeled around to face the auror and said silkily, “I’ve got him from here.” Draco’s eyebrows disappeared into his hairline.
She smiled at him as tears pooled in the corners of her twinkling eyes, “You will always be welcome at Hogwarts, Draco.” Something in those words and in her face reminded Draco of Dumbledore. And he knew McGonagall would be just as good of a Headmistress as Dumbledore was Headmaster, if not better.
“Don’t worry, I was planning on heading to Hogsmeade to get some Christmas shopping out of the way before the crowds came in, otherwise too many people will want to give their loved ones autographs instead of thoughtful gifts.” Harry winked.
“Oh come on, the heart wrenching emotions will replace the fear you feel. It’s funny too, and it’s just started.” And it was so cute that even if Draco had been thinking about denying the offer, he was forced to accept and snuggle in closer to the couch and to Harry.
But he hated the dark mark that remained, faded into a scar, but there nonetheless. He had spent countless days trying to siphon off or conceal the mark to no avail. Perhaps Granger would come up with some way to remove them. Draco could only hope.
Harry grinned at him, and Draco did his best to return it. Apparently his attempt was passable because Harry stood once again and began hastily packing Draco’s things.
Since she was a halfblood, with a muggle father, she’d grown up with muggle things. Draco had to admit, some of the muggle’s inventions weren’t all that bad. She’d introduced him to some of her favorite movies, books with muggle authors and characters, football, and best of all, music. Of course the wizarding world had music, but it was no where near as advanced or diverse as what the muggles had.
“In the long run, seeing a mind healer, or at least talking through whatever your nightmares are about with friends. Right now? I usually get a cup of tea and go on a midnight walk, if it’s cloudy out I’ll spell a night sky above my bed. Seeing the stars clears my mind.” Harry actually didn’t mind sharing this if it would help Malfoy, though he didn’t think Malfoy would dare to remember this conversation later.
He was too scared to notice the hunger that threatened to turn his stomach inside out. He thought he was doing well, turning in all of his work, never missing a single class, even hosting Quidditch practices. But then he was summoned to the Headmistress’s office.
“A charm bracelet,” She paused to examine the charms, a dragon, a narcissus, a tree, and a charm of the andromeda constellation, “It’s beautiful, thank you.”
Draco knew there were several people who would be testifying, but he didn’t know who, aside from Potter, of course. Then one of the ministry members was speaking, “We will move forward with our first witness, Amycus Carrow.”
They had escaped and the Dark Lord had shown up. He was furious, in a rage, like nothing I had ever seen. He hadn’t even been that level of terrifying when Draco’s father had failed to apprehend the prophecy.
“Very good. Teaching the subject of how he returned has been banned up until now, but since we have witnessed first hand what evil they can create, McGonagall has cleared it for us to teach to this class only.”
In Defense Against the Dark Arts, Granger was going over an auror report and helping everyone through reading one. Harry was sitting at the desk, the last, and far more basic, auror report they’d just done. And Draco, kept glancing up at Harry as he worked. On a few occasions, Draco would look up to find that Harry was looking at him, and for the briefest moment, their eyes would meet. Then one of them would look away and the moment would end.
It was just as they were finishing eating that the argument erupted at the other end of the table. Hermione and Ron were arguing again, soon enough they were yelling. Harry had no idea what it was about, because Teddy started crying, his hair turning a sickly shade of red. Instead of trying to be peacemaker for his friends once again, he took the crying baby into the other room to try and calm him.
Harry sighed and ventured out to the club fair. Some of them looked interesting so he picked up flyers, but still had no clue how much time he’d have to spend on extracurriculars. After deciding he needed coffee before he could do anything else that morning, he went to the Rise and Grind coffee shop he and Hermione had found the previous night.
Eventually they opened presents, Mr. Weasley’s face lit up when he unwrapped the muggle wireless, and Hermione had put the new earrings on before lunch. Luna immediately had Ginny put the flower crown on her head and she had not taken it off since.
With shaking hands, Draco closed the envelope and passed it off to Harry’s owl, paired with an owl treat.
Draco shrugged, thinking back to their fifth year, “The two of them lead Dumbledore’s army in fifth year. They made Longbottom really good, so I reckon they’ve got a few tricks up their sleeves.”
“They’re going from death eaters with the biggest roles and the most dangerous to those who were likely just under the Imperius curse. Trials are set to run for the next two years. I’ll be going in November and mother will be in March. Potter is set to testify at both of our trials.”
As they ordered and ate, the mood slowly lightened. Petunia asked Harry about his classes, as did Dudley, who went to a more local college. Lily still didn’t say anything, but she grabbed Harry’s hand under the table and squeezed it. Harry knew she was doing her best, and while he wanted to see her on a good day again, he knew that today was not going to be the day. He would have to wait until the next time he saw her.
“Earlier tonight after the younger years went to bed. It’s not much, really.” Harry was blushing now.
Laughing, Draco knocked his shoulder into Pansy’s playfully. “So, have you met your roommate yet then?”
“Not today,” He sighed out, “I think I’ve had enough of this place for a while.” She nodded again, understanding that as well.
Mr. Orange pulled a sheet from under the counter, “Scan the code and fill out the form on the website. I can call you for an interview based on that.”
Harry lifted up the stool, that was situated off in a corner with the sorting hat. He carried it into the Great Hall and set it down. He turned to the students and pulled the list of names from his pocket as the hat began to
“You’ve been rather giddy all day.” Hermione commented out of the blue while she and Harry were laying out the mats.
He had always thought that we would immediately recognize Prince Lion, but of course, they didn’t live in a land of fairytales and magic. There was never going to be some perfectly beautiful reunion under the stars or in the pouring rain.
“This sounds serious, everything alright?” Ron came over and sat on a desk in the front row of the class, facing Harry who sat on his desk.
He got his wand checked and then made his way down to the courtrooms. He was running a bit behind that day because he had decided to dress up for the occasion. He had on a dark green button down, to show his support for the Slytherin and to make his eyes stand out, black trousers, and a matching dress robe. Even his hair had decided to behave that day.
“I love you too.” Draco whispered back, looking up to the ceiling. To the stars they’d painted there on a particularly hard day over the summer. The stars that had finally made this room feel like home again.
“Oh, right. Andie this is my boyfriend,” He paused tentatively to wait for any sort of reaction from either of them, “Draco. Draco this your Aunt Andromeda.”
Harry took the stroller as Andie walked away to where ever she was netting her friend. He reached in and cooed at Teddy, “Hey pup, you ready to spend a few hours with your Uncle Harry? I have a new friend for you too, your cousin Draco’s gonna join us.”
When it became clear that neither would give in, Draco climbed into his bed, waving his wand and plunging the room into darkness.
When he arrived he picked up a salad and payed for it, then found Hermione engrossed in a book. Her hair was a bit wet and her swim bag was seated on the chair next to her, she had probably just come from a morning practice.
Draco nodded, defeated and slipped back into the common room, only to have everyone inside staring at him. They didn’t quite seem angry, just in utter disbelief.
Draco had been worried about Harry all morning. Harry hadn’t gotten out of bed for breakfast, in fact, he hadn’t so much as moved since Draco had awoken. Draco knew what day it was, of course he did. He thought there couldn’t be a single soul in the castle who didn’t know what day it was. Even the muggleborn first years knew, the whole school had been muttering about it for the past week, but now, no one dared whisper, no dared say anything at all.
“I think they’re all strong individually, I just think it will take a lot of work for them to be one unit, a team.” Draco said contemplatively.
Harry was shocked, first off, Malfoy seemed not to be playing favorites, by giving one of his friends another chance. Secondly he had chosen Hermione, who hadn’t shown a lick of real interest in quidditch the whole time he had known her, aside from supporting Harry and Ron when they played.
When he left that night Harry snuck away to the liquor cabinet and found a bottle of champagne that conspicuously had his name written on it. Sometimes Moony and Padfoot missed their mischief days a bit too much.
There was a short line of people, mostly college students ordering breakfast and coffee. A tv that wasn’t on the previous night was now on and playing the local morning news, something about a break in and a murder, just like his dad, Harry did his best to block that out and focus on getting his coffee.
He supposed from an outsiders prospective it could seem like he was dating Pansy, but that was different. She was a lesbian and he was gay… they’d never be a thing. But those two, Draco had no idea. They didn’t have that couple look about them, but looks could be deceiving. His heart stuttered a little when he realized that the pair of them were drawing nearer to him. Quickly he fumbled around for a drink. Helpful as always, Pansy pushed one into his hand and he gulped it down quickly, nearly choking on it as it stung his throat. It tasted cheap and disgusting- exactly what Draco had been hoping for.
The rest of the day came and went and Harry admitted that he had loved Draco’s date idea. The next morning while Harry went around the room packing up their things, Draco made the trek down to collect their dinosaurs.
He’d gotten them and was on his way back when his phone started to ring. He stared at it and let it ring all the way through as his father’s contact photo peered up at him. Finally it finished ringing and the photo disappeared. Draco sighed and resumed walking down the street. A minute later he received a notification that a voicemail message had been left for him.
When Draco climbed out of the shower a half an hour later, Harry was brushing his teeth. “Morning.” Harry mumbled, not so much as glancing in Draco’s direction. Draco hastily dried off and pulled on some fresh robes before sidling up to his boyfriend and giving him a quick peck on the lips.
Harry put the pasta in the pot and pressed pause on the music as he sat down at the kitchen table. Sirius came down and vented about some of his coworkers for a while. Remus came home half an hour later and complained about the midterms he had to grade.
“How did he survive the second time?” Harry rolled his eyes, he and Hermione had talked about what people might ask and this had been on the top of their list.
Sorry for the cliffhanger! Hope you liked the chapter though and stay tuned to find out what happens to Narcissa. Comment what you think the verdict will be!
The car sat in silence for a while. Harry, Hermione, and Ron had helped with the repair efforts on the castle, but everyone seemed a little shocked that they were actually going back.
The Great Hall was silent. Harry smiled and started clapping. As the girl went to take her seat, the rest of the staff and the current Slytherins had joined in. By the time she was seated, the whole hall was applauding, like normal. Harry read the next name, “Anderson, Hale.”
“And finally, those who say Draco Malfoy is guilty of being a Death Eater. And those who believe he is innocent. Let the record show that Draco Malfoy is guilty of being a Death Eater.” That wasn’t a surprise, he had the mark after all, he had sat in all of the meetings, followed the Dark Lord’s orders.
“So, it’s not like I haven’t seen your bed head before, we have shared a living space for almost six months.”
Harry went over to the bed and sat down next to her. “Hermione Jean Granger, smartest witch in her year, key person in the defeat of Voldemort, a bad Defense teacher? That thought never crossed my mind.”
Draco was nervous to say the least, he didn’t say it, but the way he couldn’t sit still all day when usually he was the one helping Harry focus was a clear sign something was up.
“Blaise thought you fancied Weasley, Pans thought it was Granger and I thought it was Potter.” Daphne said.
“And now for the easiest part of this whole ordeal.” Malfoy started, holding a snitch “Who’s going to play seeker? I will watch three seekers games, you will all play at once. Though I will eliminate as we go. If some one catches it twice, they will be seeker, if not, I will make my choice off of what I see. I call your name you’re out.”
Why was this so hard? He had always been Potter, never Harry. Sure, Potter wasn’t driving him up the walls anymore. Sure, Potter was tolerable now, and not a terrible roommate. Sure, he was maybe just a little attractive. But he was still Potter, the chosen one, the boy who lived... twice now. And he would never pick Draco.
“Go on without me, I’ll catch up.” Draco said. Harry gave him a questioning look, but still made his way towards the Hogwarts Express. Draco stood there for a moment watching his boyfriend go before he turned and headed in the direction of McGonagall.
“I still am a death eater, ain’t no ‘was’ about it. And that little git wasn’t no real death eater. He never did nothing if he wasn’t told twice first.” Dolohov growled, voice raised and Draco flinched a little.
Ron, who appeared to have snoozed his alarm charm one time too many, finally came down. He gave Hermione a good morning kiss and sat down. “What’d you think our first class is?”
Hermione seemed to be leaning towards going into healing the next year, though she did have a bunch of social-justice-like offers from the Ministry that she liked as well.
Draco was glad to be home with his mother. He didn’t like having the auror there, tracking their every movement. He wished he could have gone somewhere else, he hated this manor. It wasn’t home, not anymore. He stared at a spot on the ground, here he had tortured countless death eaters on He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named’s orders. He moved into the dining room. Here, at this table, he had watched a Hogwarts teacher die. Draco moved into the back room. Here, he had been forced to feed Nagini the remains of some muggleborn child. And just there, he had been tortured for his father’s mistakes. Over there, he had learned Occlumency from
“Hermione, you’ll be fine. Shockingly enough I think that you and Parkinson are the most prepared people on the team.”
He was pleased to find that the few people occupying the tables inside the small cafe were seated far from the cash register and counter where Harry was stationed. He grinned when he spotted Draco making his way too him and didn’t even ask what Draco wanted, he just made it and passed it to him without a word.
Without giving Harry time to process what was happening next, Draco grabbed the collar of his shirt and made to pull Harry into the alcove.
“They’ve got freshman yoga on the lawn that I was planning to people watch for, and after that I’ve got my first tester class.”
“Talking about death, particularly my own all morning does not give me much of an appetite. Shouldn’t you be at lunch?”
“Draco,” Harry returned easily. He was sitting with his back to Draco, an essay in his lap, his gaze focused on some far off point in the Forbidden Forest.
“Yes I did. I believe in second chances. And if you were really one of the big bad killer Death Eaters, you likely would have killed me in my sleep by now.” Harry said kindly and Draco wanted to hug him. Harry had saved his life... again. What was this, the third time? “Let’s go back to Hogwarts, I believe we have something to celebrate.” Harry said, offering up his hand. Tentatively, Draco took it and stood.
Classes were actually going well, though Harry did find himself up to his neck in grading and doing his own classwork. He and Hermione had spent the past few weeks taking the time to work on where students had been lacking in the upper years. They also had to teach the students to read an Auror report because it was going to be on the NEWT exam. Because of this, they hadn’t really touched the eighth year research project quite yet.
“I’ll figure something out. But if I do decide to transfer… would you be okay with that? Trying long distance?”
He spent the next two weeks getting trained by Mr. Orange’s high school aged son, Maxwell, and Mr. Orange himself. The shifts were pretty manageable with his coursework and he was still able to find time to hang out with Hermione. They had started watching a show on her parents’ Netflix account together in the early evenings, since Harry had started working nights at the cafe.
Now that he thought about it, he remembered Ron saying something about going off to study with some friends at the largest library they had on campus. Good. That meant he would have a few more hours to himself.
Harry was set to testify at nearly every trial, though he refused to do all of them. There were most certainly Death Eaters he had not encountered. He only saw Voldemort’s inner circle since he was their main target. Plenty of the dangerous ones had already been put away for long sentences if not life. Harry really only had two trials left to attend, Draco’s and Narcissa’s.
He hastily ran over to the door and unlocked it for Pansy. She was midway through knocking again and nearly punched him in the face in the process. He had to duck to avoid her fist, but he couldn’t dodge her halfhearted punch to his arm. “Asshole.” She muttered as she shoved past him into the room.
“We all have hard days, and though I think everyone is feeling it today, you probably have the most reason to stay in bed today.”
Harry was so sad, and Draco inwardly kicked himself for forgetting what today was another anniversary of. Harry’s father had died on this day fourteen years ago. His friend had been ripped from his life fourteen years ago. The experience had been traumatic for him, so he could only image how much worse it had been for Harry.
So he sat himself down in the seat of the accused with his head held high. And it stayed that way, even as the chains wound themselves up and around him, even as his heart faltered. They wrapped themselves around his arms and legs, trapping him, pinning him to the chair. He knew he was shaking, but there was nothing to be done for it.
Harry texted his aunt that he was settled in. Petunia and Lily had had a rocky relationship since high school but had made up in the aftermath of Petunia’s divorce and James’ death. He was glad his aunt could look after Lily while he was at college, his neighbor Andie had helped last year mostly because she had been suffering from empty nester’s syndrome, but he figured that she shouldn’t have to help when he wasn’t there.
Harry and Hermione split off from the group and went to the chamber near the great hall. Professor McGonagall was there with the other new teachers.
Draco looked up in Harry’s eyes, trying to figure out if he was being genuine. “I’ve never been a chaser before, I have no idea if I’d be any good at it.”
“Oh, I ended up having nothing on my Monday schedule, though one of the teachers listed on the booklet that if there’s low interest in a class they’d move it to Mondays to free up how many Wednesday classes they teach since it’s an athletics class that meets in the gym.”
“Well, here we are, your last first day of Defense Against the Dark Arts. I honestly hope that, unless you plan on joining the Aurors next year, you will never have to use anything we teach  you outside of this room. We’ve all had enough defending ourselves for one lifetime.” Harry started, “First things first, we do not expect you to call us Professors, that will only be for years one through five for now. However, we do reserve the right to mete out punishments if you decide to be disrespectful during class.”
He paused, the Ministry witch prompted him with the question, “Didn’t his attempts to murder Dumbledore nearly kill two of your housemates, including your best friend?”
Another step. And this time, he forced himself to keep on walking. Before he could lose the little courage he had, he opened the door to their dorm and strode inside.
“I don’t think so,” Draco mused, “During the battle of Hogwarts, he saved my life twice, I don’t think he’ll try to kill us.”
He and Hermione apparated into Hogsmeade, it was odd not being on the train, but McGonagall wanted all staff there early to prep their classrooms and have a staff meeting.
In his more rational moments, he knew neither of those things would happen, but even so... she could be sentenced to life in Azkaban with no visitors allowed. He might never see her again. No, he knew that wouldn’t happen either... right?
“He is an incredibly bright student. He always turned in all of his work on time, if not early. He was always rivaling Miss. Granger for the top spot. That is until his sixth year, in which he became distant, distracted and neglectful of his work. He frequently missed classes and looked rather sick. He skipped many of his detentions too and many other teachers saw his grades plummeting. In his seventh year, everyone’s grades were poor, so that isn’t anything to judge by. He returned to school this year to redo the previous one and once again he is back to his previous standards, rivaling Miss Hermione Granger for top spot. He has been quiet and respectful is even the Quidditch captain. He has caused me no trouble and demonstrated none of the death eaters’ ideals.”
Sorry this is a bit late! I have not seen Tay face to face in a couple of weeks and we were on different pages (haha i made a pun) when we started writing the chapters for this week so if there are any inconsistencies that’s why. But please KINDLY bring them to our attention down in the comments.
Harry had looked up upon hearing Draco’s name and now he seemed to be silently laughing at Draco, who glared in response, only serving to make Harry’s shoulders shake, with the silent laughter, even harder.
“Well, let’s just say I owe Kingsley a big favor sometime in the future. And you still have to stay within ten feet of me the whole day, and they’re tracking you.”
There was a long bout of silence between the two of them, in which time the villain of this particular film appeared suddenly directly behind the protagonist and several of the girls watching screamed. Just as enough time had passed for Draco to think the conversation was over, Harry blurted out, “You can hold my hand if you need to.”
“I don’t know, we just sort of became friends and I told him that I liked him and he asked me out.” Draco shrugged.
“Hi.” Harry said, offering the bouquet of various colors of warm toned roses, nothing red though, it was a but early for that.
“Good for you. Take your time to figure it out. Don’t trap yourself in a box just yet, especially if you’re not sure.” He finished making the drinks and passed them over the counter, “That’ll be eight ninety five.”
And that was how they ended up in the local drugstore searching for chocolate to buy for Harry. When they finally found something suitable they went to checkout. The cashier was an older man with a wispy mustache and balding gray hair. “Aw, well aren’t you two a lovely couple?” He turned to Pansy and said, “You are quite lucky to have a young man like him buying you chocolates.”
“That sounds fun, and I think I’ll come people watch for the yoga class. And I’ll probably find something to do this afternoon. Maybe meet up with Sirius.”
“And you must be Brittany.” Draco replied, offering her a smile of his own. As soon as he’d seen her, he’d known that Pansy was right about the editing and filters. She didn’t need any of that. True to her most recent Instagram post, her hair was in box braids that fell all the way down to her hips, with some of the braids twisted up to form two buns on top of her head. “I’ve heard quite a bit about you too.”
Harry quickly headed down to Hogsmeade and dissapparated to the Ministry. Thankfully, with the end of the war came the ability for people to apparate into the Ministry once again.
“What I did see Draco do that night was disarm Dumbledore, a fact that helped me overtake Voldemort last May. You see, the elder wand was loyal to Dumbledore up until that time. Late last April, I ended up disarming Draco, leading to me being able to defeat Voldemort even though he had an ‘unbeatable’ wand in his possession.
“Well, not in those words. But I overheard her talking to Bellatrix. Bellatrix was trying to convince her, talking about what a great honor it was and mum said no. And saying no to the mark is the same as saying no to the job itself.”
He’d be able to get the rest of his boxes in one final trip. Draco wanted to go right back down, but he didn’t that girl to catch him out alone again. With the way she had acted, he doubted she would let him slip by without more questions and scrutiny. After twenty minutes he poked his head out in the hallway and peered back and forth. The coast was clear of the girl, the boy and anyone else, so he hurried back down to his car before he could be intercepted by anyone. He made it down alright, but on the way back up he was not so lucky.
Now he had to hope that those writers would feel the same way when his house arrest was lifted and he was out in the Wizarding World looking for work. And he was sure that should he and Harry break up, the prophet would have a field day bashing him.
Harry balanced the box he was holding on his chest and opened the door. He was met with a song from a local musical blasting while a dark skinned girl danced around singing into her hairbrush. She noticed him and grabbed her phone off the bed to turn the music down.
Draco didn’t know what to say, what to do with his limbs- which suddenly seemed bulky and awkward. Before he could figure anything out, Ron was stalking towards him, his wand pointed directly at Draco’s throat. “Oi! What in the bloody hell are you playing at? What’d you do, slip a love potion into his pumpkin juice so he’d save you from going to Azkaban?” Ron shouted, as he drew nearer. And now Draco could feel Ron’s breath on his face, just as real as the wand jabbed against his throat.
“I dare you to run to the late night bookstore and find a disgustingly trashy romance novel and buy it, when you get back open to a random page and give us a dramatic reading.”
“And finally for the crime of allowing a terrorist residence in her home and playing part in his schemes.”
They talked for several hours and then it was time for Draco to go. Just as he was about to close the door, his father spoke one final time. “Are you happy?”
“I can’t promise when I’ll visit next, but I’ll write, as often as I can.” Draco said and stepped across the threshold, closing the door softly behind him.
“For the beater tryouts, you will be playing a bit of ‘pass the bludger’ with three other people. I will only have one group at a time, because the bludgers, are essentially attempting to kill anyone in the air. The orange group is up first.”
Finally it was time for the verdict. The Ministry witch spoke to Draco directly for the first time that day. “Mr. Malfoy, the pending sentence for your crimes, should you be found guilty for all is five years in Azkaban. Should you be found guilty of minor crimes you will be allowed to return to Hogwarts, and will be placed on house arrest for the following six months. To review, you are being tried for murder of Albus Dumbledore, use of the Unforgivable curses, attempted murder of two of your peers and Professor, and the crime of being a death eater.
Harry had left the party in the common room early. Sure he was the one that won the game, but he had hall duty in the wee hours of the morning, so he was decidedly one of the only two sober ones at the party. The other one being Hermione who also was covering the early morning shift.
Hey everyone! Not sure if Appie updated y’all. We will be doing one chapter each week, alternating POVs. This week (obviously) is Draco’s week. I’m sorry that you won’t be getting as many chapters now, but I hope you like the content anyway!
“Go home for a weekend? Maybe? I’m sorry I can’t help you other than to just listen. I know you have a complicated relationship with your family.”
“Yeah, whatever you need. We can go visit you parents later if you want.” Hermione’s parents were in the slow process of recovering their memories, luckily it worked backwards so they remembered their daughter and that she was a witch, the downside it it would be another six months until they could leave St. Mungos.
Harry was starting to catch on to what Draco was getting at, at least he thought he was. Sirius was so deep in host mode he wasn’t really paying attention.
“I was the boy that lived next door to you. I remember when the police showed up at your house. I wanted to go see the cool cars and I wanted to know if you were okay. My parents said no. So I stayed inside, next thing I knew you had moved away and my parents had made it clear that I would never see Prince Lion again.”
“You feel up to continuing the afternoon of snogging?” Draco asked, motioning to the bed behind them.
It didn’t matter that Draco still sometimes woke from dreams in which he’d been back on the playground that was their castle, a makeshift crown on each of there heads and a sense of deep longing in Draco’s heart.
“Once you get it you can let it wander around the room, but if you get tired banish it. I will not be responsible for anyone collapsing from depleted magical energy in this class.” Harry called out.
“Thanks,” Draco muttered and sidestepped around him, only to be stopped by a girl with curls down to her shoulders.
Harry grabbed his broom off the wall and headed down to the quidditch pitch, he could have used one of the new brooms that Bill and Fleur had provided, but they were the same model, broom companies hadn’t really had a chance to craft a new model due to the war. Besides, the firebolt was a gift from Sirius and it felt lucky.
“I’m probably not going to join many clubs so I’ll be fine. And the website with the application said Mr. Orange is pretty flexible about hours.”
Draco desperately wanted to accept the offer, simply to spend time with Harry, no matter what they did, he liked being near him. “Sorry, I can’t. I’ve got to go. I have tennis practice.” He said hurriedly as he backed away and practically ran the whole way back to his dorm. He bolted inside and slammed the door shut, leaning his back against it and breathing hard.
The semester charged on as normal and Harry and Draco developed a routine of sorts. Draco would join Harry at the athletic center for a morning workout before class. They did things separately as Draco played tennis and that didn’t generally consist of the same skills a runner needed to hone. They went and met whichever friends weren’t in class for breakfast after, went to classes and mostly had separate days.
She took the box and neatly unwrapped it, in a way that didn’t rip the paper. She pulled out a simple silver chain with a few charms.
“Really? You’re pretty new, so wouldn’t they not put you on the big case?” Harry asked, he had been about to head back out to the car to get his next box.
Harry shrugged innocently. He knew that he and Hermione were teaching the eighth years first, as a way of easing them into teaching. McGonagall was making her way around the hall passing out the Eighth year schedules, by the time she got to their table most of the students had finished breakfast.
Somehow, Draco was able to master himself in a timely manner. “Idiot.” He mumbled, just barely refraining from rolling his eyes. Then louder, so Harry could actually hear him, he wildly invented, “I know it’s not real you idiot. I just have an overactive imagination.” And because his pride wouldn’t let him appear to be entirely helpless and vulnerable he added, “I’ll be fine.”
Hooray another chapter! Thank Tay for posting today, I have been in a fandom spiral due to a terrible movie that serves as the conclusion of a tv series.
“I need everyone’s attention, please.” She said and everyone stopped whispering to their friends, “We are in the process of rebuilding the school. With that rebuilding, comes change. During this time, we will be attempting to bridge the gap between the four houses. This begins with you. You all will have your own common room and tower. The dorms will be split by girls and boys. Each of you will have a roommate. Since there is an odd number of both girls and boys, one person of each gender will be on their own. This may change though, as our numbers might not be static throughout the year. The room assignments will be entirely random, though I can assure you, you will not be placed in the same room as someone from your same house.” There were several groans at this, “In addition to this, in the Great Hall, you may sit at whatever table you please. This will go for every student attending Hogwarts. You are all of age, so you do not need a head of house, however, any issues can be taken to me. The sorting hat will be pairing you up, so there will be no changes, just as you cannot switch houses. There will be further announcements at the start of term feast, then the sorting, then dinner, then I will take you to your dorms to be given rooms. Now, off you go.”
Rather than standing there uselessly until she returned, he decided to begin unpacking on his own. He opened up all of the boxes until he located every single one containing clothes and then began sorting them into the drawers of his dresser. He’d filled the dresser about halfway before Pansy returned with Blaise and another boy. They immediately began helping him to unpack and Draco soon learned that the other boy was Blaise’s roommate, Neville. He was quieter than Pansy and Blaise, but Draco supposed that was likely because he didn’t really know any of them all that well. Even so, he was nice and held conversation with them. He was incredibly efficient at unpacking and Draco could have sworn that he was responsible for over half of the boxes’ contents being emptied into the room.
“Sounds good. Moony pointed out a cafe within walking distance. I think there’s a bookstore along the way in case you want to stop in.”
When they reached the common room, all of the eighth years were waiting for them. Food and drinks littered the circular room, strewn across desks, tables and sofas. Everyone stared at them expectantly and Draco froze, unsure of what to do. His eyes darted across the faces and he soon realized that it wasn’t only eighth years filling the room. He saw Ginevra Weasley there, Lovegood too, Astoria, and many others from every house.
TW: alcohol consumption, intoxicated characters, intoxicated kissing, poor parental relationship/conversation
Harry spent the morning of Christmas Day at the Burrow, which was quite nice, then he apparated straight into the manor, the wards had been altered to allow him in months ago.
Tennis practices ramped up to doubles, each two hours long, in preparation for the upcoming tournament.
A bit shorter (and later) than normal for me, but I’m glad I got this much with the way my attention span has been lately.
The end of the year seemed to fly by. Before Harry knew it he was proctoring exams, and taking some of his own. Officials from whatever part of the Ministry was in charge of education came to have him and Hermione take some sort of advanced NEWT exam, it would be averaged with whatever percent better or worse students had done in his third year due to the fact that that was when they had deemed the most recent and still competent teacher. Competent meaning not on Voldemort’s side (Quirrel, Crouch), not an idiot (Lockhart), and not rotting in Azkaban (Umbridge), also they wanted it to be in a year before the pressures of Voldemort had set in on society (Snape). Harry was pretty sure they’d tie exam scores wise with Remus’s teaching so really no impact on them passing the pseudo-NEWTs.
“Oh how romantic, I have to stay close to you or I will get arrested. You could at least not bring it up ten minutes before we’re due to leave.”
“How about we just go get coffee or something. I don’t feel like a whole ‘night on the town’ type thing.”
“They are roommates Ronald! It makes sense that Harry would share his sexuality with someone he shares a living space with.”
Draco wondered if Harry would be testifying for her as he had done for him. He was just about to ask when breakfast ended and everyone began to file out of the Great Hall and into the corridor beyond. Reluctantly Draco split off from Harry, for while he had History of Magic, Harry had to go with Hermione and teach the third years.
Harry decided he’d take a run around campus while Hermione was swimming and went back to the dorm to change.
“Sure.” Malfoy held out his hand. For Harry to shake and Harry took it. “Goodnight then.” Draco pulled back his hand, crawled into bed, and drew the curtains shut.
With only mild protesting, he managed to drag Harry out the door and down the winding stairs to the ground floor. He plucked a city map from one of the pamphlet displays and flicked it open. After several wrong turns he got Harry to what had been coined the Infinite Garden. It was lined with various shops, vendors and food trucks and was surprisingly crowded for the middle of the day on a Wednesday. Draco supposed that all of these people could simply be on a lunch break, but none of them seemed to be in any kind of hurry.
Draco was determined to stay sober, however Harry seemed to have a differing idea of how to conduct himself. Throughout the night, Draco watched Harry down more alcohol than he could count. A little past one in the morning, Draco determined that Harry had had enough.
She came out of the locker room with a towel around her shoulders soaking up the excess water from her hair.
“Okay, now that everyone’s here I’m gonna start tryouts.” Draco said, “I- er, I’m gonna- Merlin, how do Potter and Granger do this everyday?”
Fortunately he found the answer to his troubles sitting on the edge of his bed and bobbing his head to some very loud music playing over his headphones.
Pansy smirked and said conspiratorially, “That isn’t what Mione said. She was quite excited that you two were finally making things official.” She flopped backwards so she was laying on the bed, looking directly upward. She squinted at the ceiling for a moment before she shot back to a sitting position, her eyes wide.
The morning of the trial dawned and Draco was already gone. Harry assumed Draco was accompanying his mother to the trial, so he wasn’t surprised.
“Sorry, she’s just immature.” Draco said with a sigh and a pointed glare in her direction as he grabbed back the bag and his receipt and pulled her out of the little store. As soon as they were out Draco rounded on Pansy. “Are you high right now?”
“I know you. So no. Especially because our going home for the break put us on the Monday morning hall shift.”
“I- no! He had been raised on pureblood ideals, he was arrogant and might have thought of himself as superior, but he was never a killer.”
“It’s not a problem, I’m sure I’ll do the same at some point throughout the year. You’ll have to throw a pillow at me when that happens, I get so wrapped up in whatever I’m doing.” Har- Potter rambled, then added, “Oh, er, congratulations on becoming the Quidditch captain by the way.”
“Oh, come on.” Neville said with a laugh, “Anyone could see the way you two kept looking at one another when you thought no one was watching.”
The two dueled splendidly as did the next group of Padma and Daphne. “Mr. Malfoy, you seem nervous. Would you prefer to duel Mr. Zabini?” Harry asked, he knew that Malfoy was probably, much like himself, unsettled at the idea of dueling his former rival.
“Hang on, what?” Asked Daphne, stopping in her tracks. Pansy and Blaise both looked shocked too. Draco continued walking and the others had to run to catch up. “How did that happen?”
Just as he had suspected, when he woke the next morning, Harry was already gone. Draco groaned and rolled out of bed. It took mere minutes for him to get ready for the day, once he was, he padded down to the common room. Blaise and Daphne were already there, but Pansy had not yet made an appearance.
Everything about college began to feel comfortable. Harry had more friends than he did in high school and liked his classes. He was able to see Sirius and Remus whenever he wanted and did video calls with his mom regularly.
“Damn.” Neville said, and that might have been awe in his voice. Blaise grinned. His mother’s reputation had always been a pride of his.
Less than a week later Harry walked out of his first midterm to get dive bombed by Pansy and Blaise who dragged Draco and Hermione along behind them.
Sorry that it’s a little late. My fault completely. Appie had her chapter ready on time, meanwhile I procrastinated and then had writer’s block when I actually sat down to write it. Sorry about that! Anyway, I hope you enjoy!
“You were having a nightmare. Do you want to talk about it? No, wait that was probably a stupid question, we’re not exactly friends.” Harry winced at his words internally, why did he have to say that?
Harry’s mood was growing more and more sour as the night wore on, and with it went Draco’s. Though rather than becoming sour, he became anxious to the point of constant pacing around their dorm room.
Harry planned to spend every Sunday at the manor until Draco was free to roam. Sure he’d probably make visits in between if and when he felt like it, but having the set plan of a full day to themselves felt good. It gave him some structure.
Harry fought an eye roll, “Yes, she is in fact the famous Hermione Granger,” He said with a smile as he gestured towards Hermione. “Harry Potter, nice to meet you.” He held out his hand for a shake and she took it.
The girls had put him in dark jeans and a green shirt that was a shade or two brighter than Slytherin green, it set off his eyes he supposed. Hermione had tamed his hair, well tamed being relative, it looked like it was messy on purpose rather than a rat’s nest. Luna had rolled up his sleeves to show his forearms, and made the buttons gold. She had put matching gold glitter in his hair. He thought it was a little excessive, but grinned and bore it. Ginny had spelled all the dings and scratches of the past year from his glasses, and added a gold spiral pattern to one of his back pockets. The top couple of buttons on his shirt were left undone.
“No, he never killed anyone.” It was true, Draco had never killed anyone, though Weasley and Bell had nearly died because of him.
Harry grabbed his books to study from and went to find Draco. His best bet was the coffee house, it was late enough that Draco would be wanting caffeine. He walked into the Rise and Grind, waving hello to Devin, Mr. Orange’s son who worked at the shop as well.
The newly minted Headmistress of Hogwarts was desperate for someone to fill the Defense Against the Dark Arts position. The other open positions had been filled in a heartbeat, but with Snape’s death, the curse on the position had, as far as the public was concerned, been confirmed as cursed. Harry had said yes in an instant when he was asked, as did Hermione. Their former Transfigurations professor had offered them pay, Harry had almost turned it down, until he saw the conflicted look on Hermione’s face. She didn’t have a Gringotts vault full of galleons like he did, yet he could tell she didn’t want the money. They had ultimately decided to get half pay and Hermione flooed right to Gringotts to set up an account.
He was a Death Eater. Even now he couldn’t believe it sometimes. That he had really let it happen. Why hadn’t be fled or asked for help? Draco knew the answer to that though. Because he had thought that the person whom he trusted most at Hogwarts had been the Dark Lord’s greatest supporter. He had desperately wanted Snape’s help, but his pride... and his fear, had gotten in the way. And now, finding out that Snape had been good after all, it hurt more than he had wanted to admit.
Harry gave him a sympathetic look and sat down beside him, snaking an arm around Draco’s waist and pulling him in close. Instinctively Draco leaned his head on Harry’s shoulder. “Is it the house? Or just that you’ll miss being here?”
He curled into his little spot in the common room and touched up his homework before heading off to his shared dorm room.
Excited murmuring burst out throughout the room. Harry grinned, but Draco was just confused. He didn’t think they had very many people who had played for their houses. There was him, Blaise, Potter and Weasley. He was unaware if any of the returning Hufflepuffs or Ravenclaws played for their houses. But there inlaid another problem. Potter and him played the same position, and Draco had to admit that Potter was better than he ever would be. He had never played another position in his life. It didn’t matter, he knew better than to join the team.
“Narcissa Malfoy, you are hereby charged with allowing a terrorist residence in your home and playing part in his schemes. You shall be sentenced to eighteen months on house arrest and three years probation with regular ministry check ins. Do you understand?”
Then she released him and was launching into the arms of a very tall and very pretty girl. When they separated she turned to Draco and smiled. “You must be Draco! Pansy has told me so much about you. It’s so nice to meet you!”
“Finally! The amount of staring and tension between you two these past few weeks was driving me insane, what’d he say?”
McGonagall finished her announcement and headed toward the portrait hole. Draco dashed after her, hoping to convince McGonagall to rethink this entire mess. “Professor!” He called and she paused, craning her neck around to look at him.
“But one of my education classes is on a Saturday so It’s really just a trade as to which days I consider weekends.”
Half an hour later the eighth years were up; 70-20, but it was still anyone’s game. Twice Harry had almost reached the snitch, only for Ginny to intercept his path and make them both lose it. Once Ginny had seen it and Harry hadn’t, it had been an arm’s length away when Hermione had sent a Bludger her way, knocking her from her broom. She had been fine, and flying again within a minute, but at that point, the snitch had once again disappeared from sight.
Jess’s shift had long since ended, but she had stayed anyways. “How did it go?” She asked, her eyes gentle.
“I know he was marked, and doesn’t have a perfect past, but I don’t think that Draco Malfoy deserves a sentence in Azkaban. He deserves to finish the school year. As his roommate I have never felt uncomfortable sharing a space with him, as one of his teachers this year, he seems to show remorse and is one of the best students I have.”
Just then, it began to rain. It didn’t come on slowly, but rather abruptly and all at once. One minute it was clear skies, the next, it was pouring harder than it had in a long while. And Draco knew they were in trouble, his team hadn’t been rained on during any practices, Ginny’s had. In fact, they’d practiced straight through a snowstorm on several occasions. They had the advantage now.
“Some sweet Christmas bread to go with breakfast. Here you go dear.” She said, setting the cup of tea down in front of him.
“You suppose? It is very simple Mr. Carrow, did you or did you not threaten him with pain if he did not inflict it upon the other children?”
Despite Draco’s promise to plan an enjoyable date, he had absolutely no idea what to do to surprise Harry. A week passed, then another and nothing had come to him. Every moment spent with Harry felt like it was building up to some grand adventure for them to share, but his head was empty.
While he worked he considered telling Moony and Padfoot that he planned to ask Draco out after his last midterm. Maybe. If he could find the courage to do it. He had avoided Draco after Halloween, trying to not think about nearly breaking down in his arms. Every time he thought about he just felt awkward, like he should have just kept moving to his room.
“That is true, but you have to be extra careful Harry. Like super careful, lock the windows and door, don’t go out at night alone.” Harry had never heard Sirius sound this, well, serious.
“No one, I- she’s never killed anyone.” It was the truth, while Draco’s father had no qualms with murder, his mum had always distanced herself from it.
That Saturday, Draco filed onto the Quidditch pitch with Harry, Ron, Hermione, Blaise, Pansy and Hannah. Across the way, there was the Gryffindor team, led by their captain and seeker, Ginny. A smirk played across Ginny’s face as she shook Draco’s hand. She considered her team to have already won.
He inhaled shakily, looking at the stars above him. The false, starry sky created by Potter. Potter, who maybe didn’t hate him after all. Potter, who had woken him from his nightmare.
Potter was there, in his house. And so were Potter’s friends, Granger and Weasley. But Potter didn’t quite look like himself, he had been hit with a stinging jinx. Perhaps Draco could lie, say it wasn’t Potter, nor his friends. They would be released, Potter would leave. And then there would be no reason for the Dark Lord to come. Draco hated it when the Dark Lord came.
As everyone filed in Harry went over to the teacher’s desk, fighting the natural urge to sit with the rest of the class. He sat back onto it, Hermione standing off to the side.
“There’s a whole litany of things stacked against me right now. Letting Death Eaters into the castle, the actual mark on my arm, a handful of Death Eaters who witnessed Him ordering me to kill Dumbledore, and then Dumbledore winding up dead, no one who was on that tower still alive to say that I didn’t kill Dumbledore, it was—”
“Oh come on, the heart wrenching emotions will replace the fear you feel. It’s funny too, and it’s just started.”
His team. The words felt so strange to him, even in his mind. Draco had never been in charge of anything, never earned anything on his own. This was the first thing he would ever be truly responsible for and he was terrified.
That was odd, Harry thought, continuing to his dorm. He pulled out his laptop, which was decked out with sci fi stickers, and finished filling out the online form for the classes he wanted to try out. There was two history courses, an athletics course, and an education course that he wanted to try. He also had the stray couple of required courses he had to complete. He knew he’d probably have to drop some of these, but just wanted to try them out.
“We should get going.” Harry said and stood up. The three headed back to the dorms to get their things. When Ron was ready first, that was shocking really, Harry told him to go ahead, saying that he and Hermione wanted to show up together.
A little embarrassed, he feigned ignorance as he said, “Really I don’t think, what is this, Big Hero 6? Why is this playing at nearly ten thirty at night? Anyways I don’t think it will help.”
Draco turned the rest of the way and saw Ron standing there, his ears as red as his hair, with embarrassment or rage, Draco couldn’t tell. He felt heat rise to his cheeks as Harry stuttered out something unintelligible.
“Room nine!” The sorting hat bellowed, and she hopped up and disappeared up the staircase that led to the girl’s dorms.
Something in his dad’s shoulders seemed to loosen, relax. “How have you been? Your mother has only told me the bare minimum. I know you went back to Hogwarts to redo your final year, but the rest, she said was up to you to tell me.”
It was likely best that Draco asked later anyway, when there weren’t so many people around. Unable to muster the courage to kiss Harry in front of everyone, he simply grasped his hand quickly and gave it a gentle squeeze before turning away and moving into the throng of people.
Harry sat down and finally started his letter for Draco. He attached his present for him to it as well. He had found a pair of hyena shaped cuff links, and a matching pin for Draco’s cloak. Harry wasn’t sure why they made him think of Draco, but he knew as soon as he saw them that they were perfect.
“You can take the bathroom first.” Harry said, knowing Draco needed to shower or else he couldn’t fall asleep properly.
He was glad that Potter had done it, the nightmare had been terrible. The worst of all his nightmares.
Draco wasn’t sure what he would do when he saw his father. Hug him, shout at him, say he hated him, tell him he loved him, give him the silent treatment... Draco had no idea. He hadn’t been able to work out what he felt towards his father. He knew he was a little angry at him for all the harm his actions had caused. But Draco also knew that he loved him. He wasn’t sure which emotion would win out when he was finally face to face with his father.
“She then went and told Voldemort that I was dead. I assume she was using some of the best occlumency in the world, as he would most certainly have used legilimency to check if she was lying on such an important matter.”
“Take a breath ‘Mione.” Ron said. “If anyone can handle that workload, it’s you, besides you really were one of the best beaters there.”
“Oh.” Harry smiled and blushed some more. “Well, I don’t know if I like Draco or not. Even if I do, I’m not sure that Draco would want to act on his feelings. We’ve shared a room for almost a whole term and he only said it after he was extremely drunk.”
Draco nudged Harry and nodded in Longbottom and Granger’s direction. “When did they become a thing?” He asked.
Harry’s last week of midterms had two exams. Then he was done until December. He spent the parts of the week when he wasn’t in class or at work or running holed up in the library, studying.
He decided one glass of beer was necessary for what he intended to do. What was it they called it? Liquid courage. He downed it in one gulp. He felt warmth spread through his body, and he breathed in, long and slow, gathering his nerve. He took a step, and paused. He couldn’t do this, how could he possibly do this? He needed to be brave. But he was so afraid. Wasn’t that what bravery was though, doing what was needed in spite of the fear?
While Harry checked out the track Hermione went to the pool for a practice with the swim team. They had already stated practicing for the season and the freshmen only had to go an hour that day because of orientation.
They sat down and looked through the course books they received at orientation while they ate. Hermione took a pen out of her purse and started circling classes she wanted to look into more.
Draco opened his mouth to tell them that he was going to do everything he could to protect his mum, but no words came out.
“The matter of his actions during sixth year, I’ll let you know that he wasn’t the only person that almost killed someone that year. If you were to convict him of attempted murder you’d do well to convict myself as well.” That was fair too, Potter had almost made him bleed out on the bathroom floor that year. “We were young and stupid, still are. He was coerced by Voldemort, his father was in prison, and Voldemort had taken up residence in his home. He hated that he was ordered to kill Dumbledore, the stress left him alone and unable to reach out for help.” More like his pride.
The auror had shown polite curiosity when she’d seen that Draco had received a letter from the one and only Harry Potter, but she hadn’t pried or forced him to hand it over as many of the other aurors he had encountered thus far would have done. And he was glad for it.
Harry stepped onto the mat and Neville followed. Despite his initial nervousness Neville seemed to step into his own once they actually started firing spells. Harry noticed few errors in Neville’s work, though that shouldn’t have surprised him, Neville was Head Boy for a reason.
Harry knew she understood what he said, at least on a basic level, but she needed to get to a stopping point before she could really talk.
Harry got back after a late dinner, he had had to take a first year to the hospital wing after they had gotten hurt on a trick staircase.
“And now we will hear from Mr. Harry Potter, Order of Merlin, First Class, Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and peer to Mr. Malfoy.”
Hannah, Susan, Parkinson, and Zabini went up in the air and started playing something that closely resembled a dangerous game of catch.
He had to remind himself that it was just one year. Perhaps less than that, if he was sentenced to time in Azkaban, come November.
Teddy smiled and his hair changed from its inconspicuous brown to a black tangled mess that matched Harry’s.
After lunch Harry suddenly had a nervous energy. He went upstairs and put on some of his practice quidditch robes, much lighter and conducive to a workout than the game robes.
“Well, Harry and I wanted to keep it a secret, until the opening feast. Though I guess I just spoiled that didn’t I? And well, Harry has already run the DA which is the same as the practical side of class. Professor McGonagall decided that I would help him since we both still have our courses to take and I did just as well on the theory.”
He was laying on a sofa in the common room, his head in Harry’s lap. Harry ran a hand through his hair and said, “Why don’t you play chaser?”
One day in mid august Draco had such a bad day he wasn’t responding to his mother. Narcissa had floo called Harry in a panic and Harry had been over before she could finish. That was the day they had finally added the stars to the underside of the canopy on Draco’s bed.
Once he got back to his dorm he spent an hour fretting over what to wear. Hermione eventually grew tired of his inability to make a decision and threw a nice looking t shirt, his high school letterman jacket from varsity track, and a pair of really blue jeans at him.
Draco couldn’t help his smile, “I think it went well.” He turned to Harry, silently asking what he thought.
Harry was up before the sun on Thursday morning. He left a note for Hermione saying he was headed to the interview and was out the door. He made it to the Rise and Grind with a few minutes to spare.
Draco’s favorite season was the fall. He loved the leaves, in all of their bright reds and oranges and golds, he loved the crisp chilled air. He loved the pumpkins and corn mazes and lattes. He loved that sweaters were once again acceptable. But best of all, he loved Halloween. He loved the movies and the music and the costumes, he loved it all. Halloween had always been his favorite holiday. He had seen every single horror movie ever made… twice, if not three times through.
and him getting his Hogwarts letter, had both taken place in the Manor, a place he could hardly bare to enter now. Slytherin house reminded him of He Who Must Not Be Named, making him wish he’d ended up in any other house. And he had only made the Quidditch team because his father had been pulling the strings, a father that he couldn’t stand to visit.
Harry sighed, rubbing his eyes beneath his glasses. “I’m not allowed, its all classified, you know that. I can’t tell you anything about how I’m going to testify, I can’t even tell you which way I’m going to go.”
“That isn’t what I saw. You were brilliant... both of you.” He said, gesturing to Granger, who sat at the table that used to be for the Hufflepuffs. She was with Weasley, Weasley’s little sister, Longbottom and Potter. Potter’s hair was damp and windswept and oddly attractive. Draco had the sudden urge to run his fingers through it, if only to see the contrast between Potter’s dark hair and his pale fingers.
“Shit. I’ve got hallway duty. I put up a sound barrier to block the thunder. Thanks for waking me, I gotta go.” Harry said, before darting off.
“Do you want to talk about it?” Harry asked. “I can try to help you figure out what’s up with them if you want.”
A look passed between them that Draco didn’t quite understand, but it was gone so fast that he wondered if he’d just imagined it. “So, Brittany what are you majoring in?”
“I saw Bones, Daphne, Macmillan and the Patil twins.” Blaise said, “So that’s how many people?   Three... seven... nine... fourteen. So if we didn’t miss anyone then there will be fourteen of us.”
Please remember to leave comments and kudos! And remember that the next chapter has also been posted with Harry’s POV. We will have two more chapters out for you next Friday!
It had only been just over a year since Padfoot and Moony had moved in, so they still didn’t quite have set places for everything. It took Harry a good two minutes of opening cupboards to find the one where the pans were now being kept.
The next week consisted of grading, and a lot of it. Once he finished the eighth year exams, he let Draco help. He could tell Draco was getting restless watching Harry work away at the exams. With a general answer key provided Draco’s help made the grading process fly by.
His wand alarm woke him up just in time to meet Hermione for hall duty. She had wrapped a heavy blanket around herself over her clothes to beat the chill of the castle in late November. Harry had simply cast a warming charm on himself. They met Flitwick in the entrance hall and the professor went up to bed.
He climbed out of bed and went over to Malfoy, “Malfoy. Malfoy. Draco. Draco wake up!” he said in a whisper-shout.
When Harry invited him to the movie night early in October, he had no intentions of going. With midterms upon them, he had planned on holing up in his dorm room and studying the night away. But Harry had been rather insistent, so Draco had agreed, despite the fact that he really should have been studying.
So, Draco was incredibly excited to have a Quidditch match coming up against the Gryffindor team. He was ready to destroy them. Since Harry had previously been their captain, the team had great insight to all of the Gryffindor players mindset and playing styles. Draco was confident that his team would win, they were flying better than ever before. That was until three days before the match when Padma spilled a boil inducing potion all over herself and had to be rushed to St. Mungo’s. McGonagall had assured all of the eighth years that she would be fine, but that still put them down a chaser for the match.
But when the morning came around, neither remembered what had happened when they woke. The only thing they had to show from the night was a pounding headache and a terrible hangover.
“We’re still working on it. Isn’t that right you cutie, a bababa.” Harry said, smiling, reaching over to tickle Teddy’s belly.
“Wait. An Andie Tonks moved into the house next door soon after you moved here. She’s an empty nester and sometimes helped me look after mom.” Harry said.
“Er, yeah, goodnight,” Draco replied awkwardly, before closing his eyes and falling into a restless sleep.
“Good, it’s been rather warm here, but the breeze is nice. How are you liking your classes, it feels like we haven’t talked in a while.” She replied. Her voice was a bit raspy and Draco wondered if she was coming down with a cold. Or perhaps it was just a poor connection distorting her voice a little to give that impression.
“Six am?” Harry supposed he could make that work, he was usually up for a morning runaround then, “I think Thursday would work.”
Draco made a brontosaurus and a triceratops while Harry worked on a Tyrannosaurus rex and a pterodactyl. Under the woman’s guidance the dinosaurs all turned out remarkably well and Draco bought them for him and Harry to take home. She fired up her miniature kiln and told them to return tomorrow morning to pick them up.
“Harry!” She smiled and attacked him with a hug as soon as he set down the box, “It has been too long.”
Harry was glad to be back in close proximity to them again. Senior year had been… hard to say the least. His godparents had moved away when Remus had gotten the job at the end of Harry’s junior year, and living alone with his mother without Padfoot and Moony two streets over hadn’t been the easiest.
“You ok ‘Mione? You seem down.” Harry asked his friend as they took off down one of the halls. They really weren’t supposed to be on the same route, but they had the Marauder’s Map to lead them to any misbehaving students, so they walked together.
Draco nodded, gulped and opened the door. The cell was a tad larger than Draco had expected. There was a small desk in the corner, a rickety bed and a toilet. A little window, lined with bars overlooked the sea crashing against the rocks below. His father was sitting on the bed, his back to him, peering out the window.
They clinked glasses and drank. The two moved to sit with their backs against the wall and their legs dangling off the other side of Harry’s bed. Harry’s laptop was between them and they were working on choosing a cooking show.
They ended up having three days to themselves at the end of term. Draco had been begging to know what his grade was on his defense exam. Harry refused to tell him, mostly because he had no idea what Draco had gotten. He and Hermione had made an agreement last summer that they weren’t allowed to grade essays of people they were dating. This was still when he and Ginny were trying to give it a go, just before they both realized they had completely different desires. Harry had wound up grading all of Ron’s essays that year, in the beginning because he was dating Hermione, then because they weren’t speaking and after that well, it just became habit. Neville’s essays had made their way into all of Harry’s grading stacks since March, and Draco’s had been in Hermione’s since they came back from Christmas.
Draco’s mother was here? He’d had no idea that she’d be testifying. But there she was, live and in the flesh. She was thinner than when he had last seen her, paler. He was glad to see that she wasn’t in chains.
Harry glared, but allowed him to lead him up the stairs none the less. Draco tucked Harry into bed, kissed his forehead then crossed the room and settled into his own bed.
“Or maybe he’s dropped out and is trying to get himself into another school. Maybe he hates you.” Pansy said, her tone mocking. “World doesn’t revolve around you, genius. He’s probably just the type that’s always running behind schedule.”
Harry climbed into the first carriage with his friends. It took off before the others, he and Hermione had to get there to settle in at the staff table for the night and he had a sorting hat to dust off.
The city of Timberland was beautiful at night. The streets had trees with twinkle lights in them at regular intervals and some of the bigger office buildings in the distance had colored lights. By city standards, Timberland was a quiet costal city with the lake reflecting the city lights off in the distance. There were a few people around, Harry and Hermione even passed a group of university students that were clearly out to party that night.
He settled himself onto his bed and stared up at the stars charmed across their ceiling. Potter had made them stay, permanently, after having to recast them several nights in a row of ceaseless nightmares. Draco didn’t mind them, he found comfort in them.
Draco shook his head, he didn’t want to think about this, not now. It wouldn’t do him any good. “Look, whatever happens, happens. No point dwelling on it. Do you know who else decided to come back?”
It was five in the morning. He showered and brushed his teeth, with haste. He dressed as silently as possible and tied his laces with nimble fingers. He took one last look at Ha- at Potter before closing the door softly behind him.
Granger’s eyes were wide, beginning him not to give her away. But hadn’t she realized by now, how weak I was? “I... maybe... yeah.”
By the time they finished Hermione had shown up and was sitting side by side with Neville on the front desk.
Harry told them about his week and how midterms had gone while he drained the pasta and set it out on the table Remus was setting. Sirius poured drinks.
Timber Coast University had won that tournament consecutively for the past three decades, to lose now would be tainting that entire legacy. It was a lot of pressure, especially on their coach. It was her first year coaching at TCU after the coach who had led the team to victory for all thirty years had retired.
“Yes I did. I believe in second chances. And if you were really one of the big bad killer Death Eaters, you likely would have killed me in my sleep by now.” Harry smirked.
Harry dropped his trunk into the compartment on the train. As usual the Weasley family was nearly late, mostly because Ron was dragging his feet. Hermione was already waiting for them with Neville and Luna. Ron went in and sat next to his girlfriend, Harry sat near Neville and Ginny went to sat by Luna. Harry and Ginny had long since decided that they were better as friends. They had tried a few dates between the trials and the funerals and the press, but there just wasn’t that same spark that had been there in his sixth year.
“I guess I should go now. Malfoy is probably done talking to his friends and looking for some alone time with you.”
And Draco knew, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that those three days were the very best days of his entire existence.
“We should try that.” Draco said. And immediately he knew that this was the special something he had been looking to do with Harry all this time. “Didn’t you say something about wanting to try pottery just has week?”
The only problem was that Harry had absolutely zero idea of what to get Draco. He shared a room with him for months, they had woken each other up from nightmares, and even successfully not killed each other. Yet, Harry’s mind drew a blank.
Draco was up to his ears in homework and it was only the second week of school. He groaned as he tried to get through his twenty inch essay for ancient runes. He was at a loss as to how anyone was able to write that much about runes. He had only reached seven inches and he had already exhausted all of the topics he could think of.
“Those who say not guilty.” She seemed to stare directly at Harry, knowing that he was the only reason so many thought Draco innocent. Yet all the other members stood. The witch frowned. “Let the record show that Draco Malfoy is not guilty of murder. Use of the Unforgivable curses, those who say guilty please stand.” A lot more stood, but from what Harry could tell they were still in the minority.
the game dwindled out close to midnight and Harry and Hermione returned to their room. Hermione passed out nearly immediately, but he noticed that she had shoved the paper with Pansy’s number into the back of her phone case. Harry laid down in his own bed and eventually was claimed by sleep.
The first week of real classes began and the semester was in full swing. Hermione had swim practices every day and had her first meet coming up soon, she had also started seeing Pansy Parkinson. Harry ended up getting the job at Rise and Grind.
“I was four or so. I didn’t really hear much of what was happening when it happened, but I’ve managed to piece the story together from what my uncles and the police have told me. I’ve tried to ask my mother about it, but she just shuts down part way into the story.
They danced for what, to Harry seemed like forever, then ended up on the blanket, picking at the chocolates. Harry did his best not to stare at Draco, but was failing quite a bit, that didn’t quite matter though, Draco was staring right back.
Draco smiled then stared down to where Teddy had gripped one of his fingers. “He’s squeezing a bit tight.”
Molly was very talkative, chattering consistently as they unpacked, telling Draco about how Ron had forgotten to load up three of his boxes, and they’d been an hour from home when he’d realized the error. Then they’d had to take several stops along the trip to purchase other things Ron had forgotten, hence the lateness. By the end of it Draco was sure he knew her entire life story, along with everything there was to know about Ron. He couldn’t wait for her to be gone, even if it meant facing Ron’s anger.
“Alright everyone. We haven’t been practicing for hours on end, just to lose to Gryffindor. So get out there and kick their asses.” Draco said.
“I’m not.” Draco replied hastily, anxious to get back to his room. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to socialize and get to know the other freshman, but these boxes were getting heavier by the second. “My father is just at the car, getting some of my other boxes right now.” The girl squinted at him for a moment- she clearly didn’t believe him. But then she gave a shrug and strode down the hall, pulling the green eyed boy along in her wake.
Draco lifted the corner of his mouth in a half smile and went back to packing. Five minutes later he had stopped again and found himself staring out their window.
Aside from the threat at the end, which Harry figured would have gone for anyone Draco dated, (he would have made similar threats to people dating Ron and Hermione, if they hadn’t dated each other) the note seemed to imply that Pansy was helping Draco get ready for the date, and it was rather sweet of her to help her friend like that.
Draco moved with the others as they joined Pansy and exited the common room to head down for breakfast.
“Well, for one, we are sharing a room, apparently, and I for one would not want to blow it up in a duel. I am also going to be a teacher this year, so I want to be fair. And three, we are adults, and it is high time to bury the hatchet on a childhood rivalry.”
“Yes. However, she was completely unarmed. When I saw her son during the battle, he was wielding her wand. She gave up her only protection in the middle of the battlefield so that her son could have a chance at surviving.” There seemed to be a pause, apparently the Mistry wasn’t prepared for him to say that.
He got dressed and strode into the kitchen, to find his mother making them dinner. He helped her and set the table. They had a nice, quiet meal, the only sounds were the clinking of utensils against the dishes.
Harry laughed, “I’ll do my best. But I have to say, Ginny’s really good, she used to beat me when I would play at the Burrow.”
After dinner Harry was feeling a bit brain dead form all Ron’s complaining, so he went up to his and Draco’s room and collapsed on his bed. He pulled out a cutesy Muggle novel he had bought over the break, a holiday themed mystery, and read for a while. It was nearly ten when he realized Draco wasn’t back yet.
He made his way down to the Great Hall. It was strange to him, going down from a tower, rather than up from the Slytherin common room in the dungeons.
And Harry had the same look on his face that he’d had when Ron shouted at him. Anger and hurt mingled into one look, but Draco didn’t care. He didn’t understand why Harry wouldn’t tell him anything.
But Potter had just saved his ass... again. And Potter didn’t seem to hate him after all. They had been roommates for months now and had never even fought. Maybe they weren’t enemies anymore. Something had certainly shifted between them, if not at the start of the year, then surely now, after the trial.
As the first week of February drew to a close, Harry realized that Valentine’s Day was only a week away. During a rare moment of free time on Saturday, Harry slipped out to Hogsmeade, a glamour hiding his face, and bought a single red rose. He returned and wrote a quick note tying it to the stem and then he placed it on Draco’s pillow.
Harry scanned the students to decide who was to go first, he noticed Malfoy looking as if he’d seen a ghost. Well, in the Muggle sense of the phrase, ghosts were quite normal at Hogwarts. “Miss Bones and Miss Patil you are up first.” He nodded to Susan and Parvati.
“I just don’t know why he would pick me I’ve never even been interested in quidditch before, I only went to the Gryffindor games because of you and Harry, oh hey Harry. And he put me with Parkinson! She and I have never gotten along, and now we each are going to be flying with weapons, that doesn’t sound smart. Also the only times outside of flying class first year I’ve flown were those tryouts and during the battle. I also have so much to do this year between studying for NEWTs, teaching, and attending my classes how am I supposed to make time for quidditch?”
They all settled in and got the movie going and Draco was a little jittery with excitement. He pulled up a blanket around himself since the room was a bit chilly and began munching on his popcorn as the movie started to play.
Harry was unprepared for Ron to spend the majority of dinner complaining about Hermione. He did spot Draco sitting at the old Slytherin table across the hall. Harry was seated at the Ravenclaw table, but on the far end compared to where Draco sat, so it was hard to see him much less talk to him.
“Something funny there, miss?” The old man asked, his voice getting rough with annoyance as he rang them up.
He watched as the chasers flew, shooting over and over, passing between themselves and he soon realized, he would have no difficulty finding chasers. He had no idea there was so much Quidditch talent within his year. He immediately knew that Pansy and Longbottom were not suited to the position. Both of their flying was good, the scoring part was the issue. Perhaps they could take up another position.
He managed to shake her off of his trail when he rounded a building and took an alley between two more. He came out on the other side and quickly retreated back towards the dorms. When he returned to his own, he found that Ron was still not back, so he elected to shower before his sort of date with Harry.
“That was one of the things they had the waiters do at the restaurant, actually. Along with the fountain drinks. They weren’t as fancy as what you offer here though.”
The week seemed to last forever. But at last Saturday morning arrived. Draco was taking forever to get ready.
Draco zoned out very quickly, plagued by thoughts of before Voldemort’s fall. His fingers began to twitch and he hastily stuffed his hands into his pockets to avoid drawing attention to himself.
“Of course.” Draco replied and some of the tension left his body. A part of him had been worried that Harry would think back on the events of last year’s war and recall the hatred he had felt towards Draco. Then we would remember that he was a death eater and decide it was best if they broke up. But Harry wanted to eat with him, Harry wanted his company!
“Hi Harry, it’s Mr. Orange, I wanted to call you in and offer you an interview for the job you applied for, it’d be before hours, we open at six thirty I’d say come in at six, any day this week works.”
“Right.” Draco drawled. “I doubt anyone here is going to remember enough of tonight to form any lasting friendships.”
Hermione was silent. Harry put a hand on her shoulder reassuringly, and then said, “I think I know what we’re going to discuss today, but first there is another question we need to answer. Can anyone think of it?”
Harry seemed to notice Draco’s worry because he strode over to him. “What am I doing wrong?” Draco asked, pleading Harry to have some answer.
The two started to go over their lesson plans for the day. Slowly, but surely the rest of the student body started pouring into the Great Hall. The teachers then went through the ritual of handing out schedules.
He entered the house and walked back towards the kitchen. Remus was teaching a class at the moment and Sirius was still at work so Harry had some time to himself to get started on the cooking. He turned on one of his favorite playlists and got to
It was the first time Ron had spoken to him since his mother’s departure. “Your mother seemed nice at least.” Draco offered, trying to build a bridge between them.
“No, Draco was anxious about his mother’s trial and we had a stupid fight. We’re all good now. There’s probably gonna be a story about us on the front page of
He first tried thinking of his seventh birthday, then when he had received his Hogwarts letter, when he’d been sorted into Slytherin, when he had made it onto the Quidditch team. But nothing worked. All were tainted with bad memories now. His seventh birthday, often regarded as his best one,
Draco was scrunched between Pansy and Blaise, the latter was asleep with his head on Draco’s shoulder, drool pooling in the corner of his mouth. After an indiscernible amount of time, Pansy hauled Blaise up and half dragged, half carried him to his dorm room, leaving Draco alone.
Harry then went on to explain what he had seen in the memory from Slughorn and then took guesses as to what the horcruxes were. Once they had finally circled back to Malfoy’s question, the class understood that there was a lot of strategy that went into how they had planned Voldemort’s demise and they were left with more questions for another time. Harry left feeling proud and he hoped Hermione did as well.
with Bellatrix, mind you, but still not ideal. Narcissa and I had a falling out around the time we both got married, I had fallen in love with my Ted who was a Muggleborn, Narcissa had fallen for Lucius. While we had been raised on the traditional pureblood ideals of thinking Muggleborns were lesser, Bella was really the only one who actually believed it. Narcissa couldn’t have cared less who I married, she even sent me photos when her son was born. She married for love and her love bought into the ideas of pureblood supremacy. She reached out to me around Christmas, sending a heartfelt letter of apology and we have been exchanging letters ever since.”
One by one people went up to the middle of the room and recast their animal to varying degrees of success. A few like Susan and Justin only managed mist where they had been fine earlier.
This meant very few people were out and about throughout the campus. As Draco ran through, music blasting through his headphones, the quad was nearly deserted, with three people walking in a small clump towards the dining hall and absolutely no one else to be seen. It was a little chilly outside and after three miles, Draco had had enough. His nose was red and his cheeks were chilled. The wind bit at his face as he hurried towards Rise and Grind for his daily cup of coffee and muffin.
Draco sighed. It was a Saturday, four in the morning, if the sky was any indication. Draco had not slept a wink the entire night, his nerves wrapped, like a vice, around his insides. Finally Draco had had enough and decided it was time for him to get up and have a shower.
He sent it in and quickly finished his breakfast. He headed back to his room, accidentally running into the cute blond guy he’d tried to help the previous day.
Harry took a look around the room. Hermione had hung up some twinkle lights and the mini fridge was off to one side. The two beds were set on opposite sides of the dorm and there was a window between the heads of both. Under the window stood two desks. By the foot of Hermione’s bed sat a squat dresser and above it hung her Black Lives Matter flag. A large calendar with photos of animals hung behind the door and the closet next to it was half filled with clothes.
“Oh, she’s positively ecstatic, she can finally move to someplace warmer, now that she doesn’t have to worry about staying with me.” Blaise replied wryly and Draco laughed. “I think she’s about to move on to husband number eight, it’ll be easier for her to find someone in a different place, you know, where no one knows her reputation.”
Draco was not stalking Harry, no matter how it seemed or what Harry thought. He just really liked that damned cafe. He was always in there, whether Harry was working or not. It just so happened that his free time seemed to align quite well with the times Harry was working. That was all. And Draco did not want to be Harry’s friend, despite everything he said to Harry and everything Harry said to him. Draco had absolutely no interest in being friends with that green haired boy. Those eyes that were so easy to get lost in.
It opened up into a break room that felt very much like the cafe itself, a few cushy chairs were around but there was also a table with a few more traditional dining chairs around it. There was a counter with a sink and a microwave and a coffee pot and a full size fridge stood next to it.
“Yeah.” Harry said and Draco had to hold back his sigh. But then Draco’s hopes lifted as Harry added, “You want me to walk you back to your dorm?”
He then returned to his trunk and lifted out his firebolt and hung it on the broom rack on the wall.
And with that Pansy lead the group out of the building. Harry followed along, unsure of what just happened.
They had breakfast, and then went outside and ended up having a giant snowball fight. Well everyone but Fleur, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Fleur had just announced that she was pregnant and didn’t want to participate in the snowball fight.
He strode into Rise and Grind and found Harry standing behind the counter, smiling at him. He’d known Harry would be there, and this time he had actually been looking for him, though he was in the mood for coffee as well. He paused directly before the register and grinned right back at Harry.
But after a few moments, what was happening hit him. They were both drunk, Potter seemed to realize it at the same time and they both pulled away.
There was something romantic about it too. But Harry chose to ignore that while Draco was leaned against his shoulder.
The team walked together down to the quidditch pitch. Blaise and Hannah were discussing something together and had been since breakfast. Padma was in her own little bubble of solitude. Hermione and Pansy were drilling each other on plays leaving Harry and Malfoy walking beside each other at the back of the group.
“Sorry, yeah, I’m good.” Draco said quickly, backing out of the touch before Harry could realize what was happening.
“Stop pacing,” The largest auror said, crossing his arms and giving Draco a pointed stare, “You’re going to make yourself sick if you keep that up.”
“Oh, well, I knew you liked the stars, but the astronomy tower was out. It’s too cold and there are too many bad memories there. I’m also a bit scared to check if the Room of Requirement still works. That left this or sneaking into the library, though Filch and Mrs. Norris guard that like hawks at night.”
Another member of the Ministry stood and declared the final verdict. “Draco Malfoy, as you have been found guilty of the crime of being a Death Eater, you are sentenced to six months of probationary house arrest upon your completion of Hogwarts. During your time at Hogwarts, should you choose to visit Hogsmeade you are to be accompanied by an auror, as you will be on the Hogwarts express to return you home for holidays. After your house arrest you will remain on probation for a year with regular check ins from the Ministry. Do you understand.”
“Sure.” She said, blushing, ever still the fan girl, “Hermione mentioned that you grew up with Muggles, I was just curious what were they like?”
Tired of waiting, he made his way down to the lot where he’d parked his car and stacked up a few of the larger boxes into his arms. It was a struggle to make it back to his dorm, but somehow he managed to do it without the boxes teetering out of his arms. He was on his second trip up- with even more boxes this time- when the top box began to slip. It slid to the right and he scrambled to keep the other boxes underneath it. He stumbled and the box tipped precariously. A hand shot out and steadied the box. Draco peered around the towering stack to find a dark haired boy with green eyes framed in circular glasses looking at him, his lips quirked upwards in the hint of a smile.
“Well I am not a part of the people who grew up knowing about magic. My relatives knew. I didn’t until Hagrid broke down our door an my eleventh birthday.” Harry said, trying his best to end the conversation.
So, Draco had his team, Potter, Weasley, Granger, Pansy, Blaise, Patil and Abbott. It wouldn’t hurt to have some substitutes though, in case someone was hurt. Neville could be the backup keeper, Draco could be the backup seeker and chaser, and the backup beater could be... Finch-Fletchley.
He grabbed up the remote and began flicking through the channels. Draco watched him, half amused and half exasperated confusion. He had no clue what Harry was planning, not that it really mattered. He would take whatever he could get when it came to Harry.
It was the middle of the night when Harry was awakened by sounds of distress coming from Malfoy’s bed. Something in him acted on instinct, it had become a general rule with pretty much anyone he stayed with that summer to wake someone up if they were having a nightmare and help them calm down.
The thoughts fled Harry’s mind as Hermione brought out the second year and escorted her to the hallway.
When Harry finally started to dig into the food it was nearly an hour later. He quickly realized how hungry he was from not eating all day and consumed it rather quickly. Draco sat next to him reading a book, glancing over at Harry whenever he turned the page.
“This is for you, on the house, I figured you’d need it since it’s so early. It’s the same order you wanted last time you were here.” Mr. Orange passed him the glass that was filled with iced coffee.
Draco desperately needed to clear his head, so he pulled on his tennis shoes and went out for a morning run. All of the students were either still asleep or avidly studying for there last few midterms of the semester in the libraries or in their dorms.
“Nothing, I think you’re just not feeling enough. You have a tendency to over analyze, when it’s your turn just feel, point your wand, and say the words. The rest will work itself out.” Harry said, wrapping his hand around Draco’s wrist to lower it.
“And how are your parents?” Blaise asked, turning Draco’s own question back on him. “My mother is fine with it, as always she just wants me happy. But I can tell my dad is pissed. He hasn’t outright said it, but he got so cold and distant after he found out where I was going. And he never brought it up, just left it as an elephant in the room.” Draco shook his head, brushing away his rising annoyance at his father’s inability to properly express his emotions. “It’s whatever. How about you, Neville, how are your parents?”
So, Draco leaned a little further into Harry’s warmth and said, “I’m not the biggest fan of horror.” He ought to take up a career in acting, for that slight tremble to his voice sounded almost genuine.
Draco had to admit, he was exceedingly nervous for the official start of term. He had to be careful, control himself. One false step could be his downfall. He knew everyone would keep one eye locked on him, waiting for him to do something to prove he was who they thought he was; a death eater.
Draco found himself pacing back and forth for hours on end, despite the fact that he knew it would be days before he received any sort of return letter from Harry. If Harry wrote back to him at all. With every small sound, he found himself craning his neck in the hope of seeing an owl at the window.
“Mr. Malfoy, the pending sentence for your crimes, should you be found guilty for all is five years in Azkaban. Should you be found guilty of minor crimes you will be allowed to return to Hogwarts, and will be placed on house arrest for the following six months. To review, you are being tried for murder of Albus Dumbledore, use of the Unforgivable curses, attempted murder of two of your peers and Professor, and the crime of being a death eater. For the first charge those who say guilty please stand.” Most of the Wizengamot stayed in their seats, still Draco refused to exhale. “Those who say not guilty.” Those who had been seated stood. “Let the record show that Draco Malfoy is not guilty of murder. Use of the Unforgivable curses, those who say guilty please stand.” A lot of people stood, but still there were more sitting. “Those who say he was under duress and should not be considered guilty. Draco Malfoy is not guilty of use of the Unforgivables.”
He arrived down at the pitch and joined Hermione, who appeared a bit nervous, Ron, holding one of the new firebolts his brother had gotten as if it was a prized possession, (which it probably was seeing as it was a high quality new broom), and Neville, who looked as afraid of his broom as he had back in first year.
Harry’s eyes opened and Draco sagged slightly from relief. Harry glanced out the window and Draco took that moment to mask his expression into cool indifference. He hoped that in Harry- Potter (How long had he been calling him Harry?), in that groovy state that came with having just woken, wouldn’t have taken note of the fear that had been present in his expression.
Forty-five minutes later, Harry and Draco headed down for Hogsmeade, their trunks levitating behind them. They had reached the border where the Hogwarts’s grounds bridged with Hogsmeade, when Draco saw Professor McGonagall seeing students off and saying their final goodbyes.
Then his father was speaking to him once more. “There’s something there, it could be the scar, stretched tight. Draco, come here, look properly! What do you think?”
Harry passed Teddy back to his grandmother and and said his goodbyes. Then he and Hermione flooed back to Grimmuald.
Draco swallowed hard as Ronald looked up and their eyes met, anger flaring through them as he looked at Draco.
Once they finally made it onto the train Draco and Harry went over their plans for the summer together.
“A bit. But mostly because I’ve got an interesting lesson planned for the eighth years this morning.”
Draco could understand that. Pansy’s parents- both very public government figures- had been involved in a very large scheme against the government. On top of that, while they were being investigated, it had become apparent that Pansy’s father was having a very extensive affair with a women fifteen years younger then him. Her family had been on the front page of the weekly news for the past twelve weeks straight. In fact, last week’s edition had headlined that Pansy’s mother was filing for divorce. Draco didn’t have the heart to ask her whether or not that bit was true.
“Mom we texted yesterday. We text everyday.” Draco reminded her gently as he stood, squeezing the phone between his shoulder and ear to free up his hands so he could pack his things more easily.
The way Sirius had been acting the past few times Harry had seen him was odd. At first he thought it was just the holiday season that was coming up, it had always been a rough time for him before he ditched his biological family. But that didn’t seem to be it, he was always more cautious when talking about his work and way more protective of Moony and Harry than usual.
Draco sighed, “I guess you’re right, I’ll give it a try, just catch the snitch fast so I don’t embarrass myself too much.”
He wondered if this auror knew that he had not been close to his cousin, never even met her really. At least not in living memory.
Then his dreadful aunt had strode into the room and hell had broken loose. And Draco was forced to listen to Granger’s screams, and Bellatrix’s hissed, “Mudblood” over and over. He had to duel Potter and Weasley, despite wanting, more than anything, to just let them go.
When he walked in, she offered him a hopeful smile. He knew that she, maybe more than himself, had hoped today would go well. “You were gone a long time,” She remarked, as the auror, who had switched out with Jess, stepped out of the room to offer them some privacy.
Harry sent the letter off with his new owl Leo. It had been hard getting a new owl last summer, but he found it hard to function in society without it. He had also had to put up filters on his mail keeping out fan and hate mail.
“Even you know that it’s no fun to drink alone.” Draco couldn’t disagree with that so he said nothing and allowed Pansy to weave him through the crowd.
“A women’s studies class I signed up for on a whim. I might actually end up keeping it if the teacher is any good.”
Draco sighed, long and slow. Even if his father did miss him, he’d never admit it. “That isn’t what I asked.” He snapped.
” Harry murmured as he waved his wand in a star pattern. A beautiful starry sky spread between the canopies of the two beds.
As he laid down and looked up at the stars he had charmed onto his ceiling. Draco’s letter sat on his bedside table, he had read it through about a million times, but he still had no idea how to respond.
Before they knew the train had reached the station in Hogsmeade and the students were piling into carriages. Some of the new sixth and seventh years stared at the Thestrals, which they were probably seeing for the first time. No one had taken the train home after the battle, it was parent pick up for everyone, which was made easier because no Muggleborn had been allowed to attend last year.
“No.” Draco said, a tad to harshly. He hastily added, “You aren’t allowed to come, you aren’t family and you aren’t testifying, so unless you’re on the council, you can’t come.”
All of the “eighth years” were gathered in a side corridor, sixteen of them in all. McGonagall’s eyes were scanning everyone, making sure everyone was there, and they spent longer than was strictly necessary, examining Draco. He couldn’t look her in the eyes, not after everything that had happened.
Draco packed up his stuff and Harry finished closing. They walked back to their dorms together sharing stories about their lives. Harry had never felt closer to anyone than Draco in a way. Once they found out they knew each other as kids Harry found himself telling Draco stories he’d never told anyone before. And Draco opened up to a whole new level than how he had been around other people.
Draco paused, and slowly turned back to face his father. “Yes, I am, for the first time in a while.”
Harry was the Godfather of Draco’s deceased cousin’s son, for one thing. Granger and Weasley had broken up and now she was staying with Harry, for another. Draco wasn’t sure how to feel about either of those things. He had always been wary of the relationship between Harry and Granger, and with them staying in the same house...
“The first part of this year is supposed to be dedicated to studying how defense works in the field. Now, the curriculum says that we should have you go over some unclassified Auror reports and such, but many if not all of you have field experience. Tonight’s assignment is easy: come up with three questions on defensive magic used during either war against Voldemort. We will study the more compelling questions during class.”
“You’re in here whenever I’m working, if you weren’t studying the whole time I’d assume you were stalking me. We spend plenty of time together so you’re stalking me or we’re friends, take your pick.”
He headed to the makeshift study, as the real one was still to eerie to get anything done in, and found Hermione staring at the lesson plans.
Harry then spotted the snitch hovering just beside Malfoy. He dived, and grabbed it, but not before nearly knocking Draco off his broom.
After dinner was finished, Harry waved his wand and set the dishes to washing themselves over the sink. Then the pair of them took their leave, curling up together in Draco’s bed. “I love you.” Harry whispered, his face buried in the crook of Draco’s neck.
The friends chattered for a while and got plenty of sweets from the trolley witch. They were all ignoring the fact that they were headed back to a place where they had seen friends and family die. Where Harry himself had died, though only for a few minutes. Harry was glad that he dropped Care of Magical Creatures because he wasn’t quite sure if he could go back into that forest.
Mr. Orange was inside and through the glass door he pointed Harry to the alley on the side of the building. There was a door there that said employee entrance and Harry assumed he was meant to use that door.
“You know those break ins and murders that’ve been happening in the wealthy districts?” Hermione asked.
“That’s fine. I’ll get back to you soon, do some other interviews, you can take the cup and return it when you inevitably come back again.” Mr. Orange stood up, that was apparently all he needed to hear.
The rest of the week went by fast. Harry ended up dropping his athletics class and one of the history courses that he decided to take the next semester, but kept the rest. Sunday he and Hermione attended the self defense class and Harry picked it up surprisingly fast.
Draco snorted and shook his head a fraction of an inch. He padded across his room and grabbed an ink bottle, a quill and some parchment. Then he returned to his desk and set to work writing his response to Harry.
But then he saw what Harry was looking for and he knew he needed to object, if only for the sake of his personal image. Yes, it was true, he loved horror movies. Like really, really, loved horror movies. Like, if he could only watch one genre of movie for the rest of his life, it would be horror movies- or psychological thrillers. But, his favorite movie- shockingly enough- was not a horror movie, not by a long shot. His favorite movie was Big Hero 6. But Harry couldn’t have possibly known that as he turned it on, somehow right at the beginning.
Draco looked back on that time fondly. He loved his aunt and cousin, and they had been with Draco’s family nearly every day for months and months while he had been in primary school. Andie had even come to live with them one summer when his mom had had a bad cold and been off of work.
Potter crossed his arms and raised his eyebrows, a smile danced across his lips. “Is that what you think I’m doing? Trying to beat you? I don’t care Draco, I don’t care if you win, life isn’t a competition, at least not for me.”
Draco snatched the Quaffle out of the air and wove past one of Gryffindor’s chasers, Robins was her name, he thought. But he was still unsure of himself and was quick to pass it to Hannah. She shot for the middle hoop after feigning the right hoop and scored, putting them up 10-0 as the announcer soon echoed.
“And you could do to announce your presence instead of going full boxer on someone’s door!” Draco snapped, turning his back on Pansy.
The contents of his stomach nearly emptied themselves when he stood, but he managed to keep them down as he staggered up to his room. Potter was there, sitting on his bed and massaging his temples.
The other new professors introduced themselves with very few nerves. Professor Delacroix spoke with a slight French accent and Professor Barlow surely seemed like a nicer professor than Snape had been.
Harry showed off his stag and Hermione, her otter and then they were off all trying to produce their own. Ron of course got his Jack Russel Terrier to make an appearance without issue, followed almost immediately by Ernie Macmillan’s boar.
“They’re a charmed set. You wear one and I wear one. They read your mood and transmit it as a color to the other’s necklace.”
“I don’t have a condensed list of all of the eighth year students quite yet. So we will be going alphabetically through the each of the houses. This means Gryffindor first, then Hufflepuff, followed by Ravenclaw and ending with Slytherin. Hermione Granger!” McGonagall called out.
A while later he and Draco were on a walk around the grounds Harry was admiring the way the light reflected off some icicles on a tree when Draco said abruptly, “I can’t wait to get out of this place.”
“I’ll have a chai latte with almond milk.” Hermione said, “And one of the turkey and provolone sandwiches.”
“Speaking of that day, the reason I even encountered Draco, was that my friends and I were captured by the snatchers. Draco was asked to identify us, I had been hit with a stinging hex that made me less recognizable. I was terrified that we had just been made, that I would have to fight Voldemort then and there. But then, he looked me in the eyes and said ‘It’s not him.’ I knew we were saved, at least long enough to make a plan.”
Whoever was on the other side of the door began banging their fist rapidly against it. Draco rose to his feet quickly and glanced around the room for anything he might be able to use as a weapon, should this be a case of breaking and entering. He was just about to cross the room in favor of grabbing up one of the desk chairs when Pansy said, “Honestly Draco? I know you’re in there! Just let me in!”
“Mr. Weasley and Mr. Macmillan.” As Harry payed attention to the duel he noticed that Ron was not good at non verbal spells, but knew more than Ernie. Of course he and Hermione had expected Ron to know more at this point.
“Yeah, since that girls night you two had a few weeks ago you’ve really been in sync. I know you probably feel like puking right now, but at least eat some toast and have some water, otherwise you won’t have any energy for he game.”
Hermione pulled her blanket a little tighter, it had gotten a bit cooler as they were nearing a hall with quite a few of the ghosts.
“Attention students!” McGonagall called out, drawing the room to an attentive silence. “Now I have noticed that the morale is rather low for all of you. Am I sure that much of this is due to the excessive amounts of homework you have all been subjected to. However, the homework is necessary, so I have come up with another way to remedy this problem. Your house will have a Quidditch team and you will play the other teams and compete for the House Cup!”
Draco hurried down to the kitchens and prepared a little picnic for the pair of them to share. The trip couldn’t have taken more than twenty minutes, but by the time he got back, Harry had pulled himself up into a sitting position. Draco slid into the bed beside Harry and pulled the comforter over top of him, snuggling in close to his boyfriend before laying out the carefully chosen meal.
Malfoy seriously didn’t still think that Harry could testify against him right? After they had shared a room for two months, and Harry being his teacher? Harry looked off to the table that used to be the Slytherin table, and saw Malfoy. At least he hadn’t skipped this meal. Malfoy still looked worried. Harry found himself wanting to hug Draco. Now that was a strange thought. And run his hands through Malfoy’s hair. Where did that come from?
Draco needn’t have worried about the girl being with the green eyed boy though, because as soon as they reached Draco and Pansy, Draco’s gaydar started going off like crazy. There was no way the girl- her name was Hermione- was even the slightest bit interested in men. The boy- Harry- was a little bit more tricky. He was like a book written in a different language, everything was right there with a simple translation, but Draco couldn’t read a word of it.
I hope you enjoyed it! I’ll admit, I got a little bit teary writing the end of it. I’m already missing it and I’ve only just finished. I really hope it has lived up to expectations! Leave your thoughts in the comments, as always, I love to read them! I’ll reply to everyone; so if you have any questions or requests, ask! Ask! Ask! If you haven’t left kudos and you’ve made it this far, please leave them for us. Thanks again for all of your support.
But then Harry spoke, his voice gravely and cracked. “Bring some for both of us? Eat up here with me?”
There was a lot of nodding, but Draco felt it he moved his head like that, he might pass out. What if his roommate despised him and tried to hex him in his sleep? Or worse? Draco’s insides churned at the prospect of being murdered by another one of these students.
Near the end of the lesson Hermione called out. “Ok the last thing you need to be able to do is do it under pressure of people watching. Vanish your patronuses, we’re gonna try it one by one.”
“That was when me and my friends were captured and taken to Malfoy manor. She didn’t say or do much there. She identified my friend Hermione to the others, but that was it.”
The summer flew past, Harry wasn’t sure where it went. He went to visit Draco at least once a week, usually more. His test results came in mid July and he had gotten an outstanding on the Defense test, which meant he qualified to return to teach.
“Well, she wasn’t there the night Voldemort returned. The only Malfoy in that cemetery was Lucius. The next time I saw her she was minding her own business in Madam Malkins the summer before my sixth year.” Harry said
Draco was a mess, an utter and complete mess. His mum’s trial was right around the corner and he had no idea how it would go. In the latest hours of the night, he often found himself fearing the worst; that she might be sentenced to death or that she might be tortured.
His mother left after a few moments, and Sirius and Remus stepped back. This gave him a moment of some semblance of privacy.
Pansy was the first to break the silence, “Draco, how have the trials been? I- we heard that your whole family was going to be on trial, but I couldn’t find any dates.”
Harry returned to his seat and then looked around. He realized that it should be Draco’s turn to speak, but Draco was nowhere to be seen.
Slowly people started to flood in, and roughly an hour later Harry was seated in the same chair he was in in November, Andromeda on his left.
But McGonagall had started speaking again, so he forced himself away from his thoughts, “Now tryouts will be held this Saturday, and they will be led by your team captain, Draco Malfoy.” It took Draco a moment to comprehend her words, but then it finally sunk in and everything made sense. Professor McGonagall wanted Draco to be murdered, there was no other explanation. He couldn’t lead a team full of people who would hate him! And he couldn’t hold trials and refuse people, he couldn’t choose. “And, everyone will be trying out... for every position. We do not have room in this house for hiding talent, so practice and try your best. The newest brooms have been donated by Bill and Fleur Weasley.”
Once it was the beaters turn, Draco faced a great shock. Granger was incredible. Who would have thought? So was Pansy, but she had always rather enjoyed hitting things. None of the other applicants were anything special, so Granger and Pansy, it was.
Draco sighed. How could he sum up years of denied friendship, rivalry, jealousy, unrequited love, resentment, annoyance, and even at some points, hatred, in a way that she would be able to understand. “We’re roommates.”
Then there was the matter of telling him about his relationship with Harry. Upon request, Draco’s mum had not mentioned Harry to his father on any of their visits, and Draco was determined to tell him today.
“Well, Draco?” His father was asking him and he could do it! He could lie and this would all be over. Potter could go back to trying to find a way to kill the Dark Lord and Draco could be free. “Is it? Is it Harry Potter?”
Word got around to Draco that a party was being held in his building, by way of Pansy’s enthusiastic text messages. Seventy three messages to be exact. Most of which contained many exclamation marks and entirely capitalized words. It was no surprise to Draco that she was forcing him to attend with her. Surely Blaise would be made to go too. It would be a good opportunity for Draco to meet some of the other freshmen and make friends, but he wasn’t entirely sure that he wanted to branch out and meet new people. He was perfectly content with his little trio, even if Pansy was already seeming to drift away from him and Blaise.
“Draco Malfoy!” Draco didn’t move, lost in his own thoughts, once again. “Draco Malfoy!” Pansy elbowed him in the ribs and he finally realized, he was supposed to be doing something. He hurried to Professor McGonagall. She smiled at him too, but it seemed a little more forced than it had with Daphne. Perhaps he was just being paranoid. Perhaps she wasn’t looking at him any differently than she had looked at the rest. Perhaps her gaze hadn’t lingered on him before the feast. Perhaps he was losing his mind, imagining things.
“Hard is a relative term for this lesson, but I’m pretty sure everyone will feel better by the end of it.”
I know it’s September but I listened to Christmas music in order to write this. Tay and I have officially started classes again and I’m wiped so that’s really all I have to say
Now, you couldn’t catch Draco without music playing, day or night, he always had the radio on. Harry found it incredibly amusing, especially when he’d walked into the sitting room to find Draco dancing around the room, lip syncing to Bon Jovi. Draco didn’t think Harry would ever let him live that moment down. Not that he really minded.
“Well I mostly worked as a waiter, I’d take orders and serve food. Occasionally I’d help the kitchen run smoothly, keep things from getting burned, finish plating something before it was served if we were short staffed in the kitchen, but I never did any of the cooking. I do know my way around a kitchen though. My uncles weren’t much good at cooking when I was growing up, and my mother isn’t really able to do much cooking on her own. My aunt started teaching me and my cousin when we showed an interest in food, but he took to baking more than cooking. I did most of the cooking at home the past few years.”
“Right. A room full of eighteen-year-olds can’t be any scarier than facing a three headed dog.” She stood up, “Thanks.”
Harry survived the test on Monday with little fanfare, it wasn’t an easy test, but Harry was sure he had done well enough to pass. He went over to Sirius and Remus’s house for dinner, he had made a sort of habit of seeing them at least once a week, whether it was for dinner, or weekly grocery shopping, or whatever else they could do together.
The next few weeks were rather strange for Harry. He and Malfoy, it seemed had agreed not to interact much on purpose. They shared a room and Harry was his teacher, so there were moments where they talked, but the date seemed like an elephant in the room that neither of them discussed, at least not face to face. Instead they had fallen into the habit of leaving notes for each other to find.
“I guess I’m- I’m fine.” Draco mumbled quickly, his eyes settled upon his knees, one of which was continuously bouncing up and down, an unconscious sign of his nerves.
He knew there had been plenty of people who had seen the Dark Lord order Draco to kill Dumbledore. And Potter had known, that whole year, Potter had known what Draco was trying to do. For a moment, he wished Snape had just let Potter kill him in that bathroom.
“You study too much.” Pansy said, “Besides midterms season is so spread out that if we did nothing together as a group during that time I wouldn’t see any of you for two months.”
He was visited by Macmillan’s jeering face in his dreams. Macmillan laughed at him incessantly and then hexed him so he couldn’t move. The rest of the dream was a blur, but whatever had happened was awful and had left him in a shaky, cold sweat.
Draco contemplated that. Would the others stay? They had stayed last year, but that had been to try and protect the students. But, what would happen, now that the danger had passed? How would he be treated by the other students? After everything that had happened, he knew he deserved whatever he got. Would they turn the other way when they saw him coming? Whisper behind his back? Or would they mock him? Try to kill him?
Draco tapped his fingers restlessly against the glass of the display as he waited for his coffee, while also trying to summon that courage again. But Harry set his coffee on the counter with a tight smile before turning to help the next customer and Draco had missed his chance. He grabbed up the coffee and hurried out of the coffee shop, inwardly cursing himself the whole way.
Draco sighed, long and slow. He watched Harry’s chest rise and fall and rise again, in that gentle rhythm. Draco began to match it and then finally, he drifted into a restless sleep.
“Thank you Mrs. Tonks.” The wizard paused, “Up next we will be hearing from Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, Order of Merlin First Class, Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.”
Harry remembered getting the summons from Professor McGonagall over the summer. He had been living in Grimmuald place with Andromeda and baby Teddy, they had decided that once Harry had gotten a full time job they would split custody of his godson. He was in the middle of cleaning out one of the spare rooms when he got the owl. He had flooed over to McGonagall’s office in Hogwarts soon after and was a bit surprised to find Hermione there, she and Ron had recently gotten back from Australia with her parents, and she had decided to make up for lost time and stay with them.
Harry got dressed in a dark gray shirt and put on a pair of gold snitch shaped cuff links Arthur had gotten him for Christmas. A pair of black pants and his nicest robes, dark red hemmed with gold completed the look.
Carefully, he removed Harry’s arm, which had been draped around him, and settled it onto the bed before sliding his feet onto the ground. He stood and stretched, padding over to the bathroom to wash.
“Now, Slytherin and Gryffindor are in need of new heads of house. So, Professor Barlow and Professor Delacroix have graciously volunteered to take up the positions. Professor Barlow will be the head of Gryffindor and Delacroix for Slytherin. Now, we are in the process of bringing the houses together. The houses and the sorting will remain for purposes of Quidditch, dorms and heads of house. However, class schedules will be different. All classes will be mixed with all four houses. Now, without further ado, onto the sorting!”
Harry didn’t feel like going to lunch that day. It was more facing people than a lack of hunger. The eighth years had somehow gotten to the discussion of the tactics at the battle of Hogwarts, particularly his own death-that-was-not-a-death. Hermione and Ron, the good friends they are tried to steer the conversation to something else in the battle, but it didn’t work.
Hermione looked relieved and Harry was off again. Just as Harry spotted the snitch for the second time about half an hour later, Malfoy called “Abbott and Patil, Padma Patil.”
But maybe he would be the boy who didn’t have to share with anyone. Maybe the sorting hat would realize that everyone hated him and grant him a reprieve by letting him be by himself. He doubted that too.
“He is an incredibly bright student. He always turned in all of his work on time, if not early. He was always rivaling Miss. Granger for the top spot. That is until his sixth year, in which he became distant, distracted and neglectful of his work. He frequently missed classes and looked rather sick. He skipped many of his detentions too and many other teachers saw his grades plummeting. In his seventh year, everyone’s grades were poor, so that isn’t anything to judge by. He returned to school this year to redo the previous one and once again he is back to his previous standards, rivaling Miss Hermione Granger for top spot. He has been quiet and respectful is even the Quidditch captain. He has caused me no trouble and demonstrated none of the Death Eaters’ ideals.”
“I’ve just thought of something rather brilliant!” She exclaimed. “You should bring Harry some chocolate!”
Next up were the keepers. Longbottom was actually rather good at this and Draco was considering him for the position. But he knew Longbottom would face the same stage fright troubles that Weasley often experienced. But Weasley beat out Longbottom fair and square, he managed to save every goal shot at him. Five down, only the beaters to go. Well, that and the seeker tryouts, but of course, Potter would win.
Pansy tried to catch up to him and he let her. But he did speed up his pace to make it difficult for her to stay in stride with him. It was a satisfying feeling, especially with her breathing too heavily to be able to form words. That was what she got for not playing a sport or doing anything remotely similar to exercising.
“Nah.” Draco responded with a shrug that Pansy couldn’t actually see since she was in front of him. “But it doesn’t really matter all that much. It’s not like he’s a bother or anything, he just sits on his side of the room and sulks.”
“Could you show me?” Malfoy asked. Harry assumed that this willingness to talk coming from the ex-Slytherin was probably due to sleep deprivation and decided to go along with it. Harry used his magic to position his bed nearer to Malfoy’s.
“It’s got to be awkward playing your girlfriend.” Malfoy said in an awkward attempt at conversation.
“As I am sure many of you have noticed,” She gestured to the empty seats, “There are some jobs that need filling. We have filled all vacant spots, so I might first introduce our new transfiguration teacher; Professor Delacroix.” Polite applause ensued across the hall, as a tall, muscled wizard strode into the hall and took his place. “Our new potions master, Professor Barlow!” An extremely skinny witch entered next, she had long ebony hair and dark skin. She wore a kind smile and the finest robes Draco had ever seen. “For muggle studies, Professor Vasven!” A young witch entered, smiling and waving at the students as she passed. “And finally, for defense against the dark arts, please welcome Professors Granger and Potter!” There were several gasps throughout the hall as Potter and Granger entered. They quickly turned to excited cheers.
Luckily that was right on his usual lap around the top of the playing area. He put on just a hair more speed than usual and as he passed by he reached out and plucked the unsuspecting snitch from the air. He made Ron nearly fall off his broom in the process, because Harry had had to get closer to the goals than usual.
They arrived at Moony and Padfoot’s house at seven o’clock sharp that night. Draco was dressed in a crisp blue bottom down and black pants and had styled his hair to perfection. Harry was dressed in a de wrinkled plain green t-shirt and khakis.
There were also teacher duties they had, like patrolling the halls late at night and into the early mornings once a week after the prefect’s shift, or sitting at the staff table to monitor meals in the great hall. Professor McGonagall had asked Harry to be in charge of the sorting hat this year since the first years would probably be less scared this year if their hero was one of the first faces they saw. He had been reluctant, as deputy headmaster Flitwick should have been in charge this year, but he had conceded. Not even Hermione knew about this duty though.
Slowly, his father turned around to face him. A soft smile broke across his face as his father saw him for the first time in over a year. “Draco.” The word was barely a whispered breath. “Oh, my son.” He stood and moved until he less than a foot away from Draco. “I thought I would never see you again!”
He had the list narrowed down to Abbott, Blaise, either of the Patil twins, but not both since they crowded together too much, or Michael Corner. Abbott and Blaise were better than the others, so they had definitely made it. Now the question was, Padma, Parvati or Michael? He watched them fly for a few more minutes and decided that Padma was superior to her sister. But, he had to admit, Michael did seem to be slightly better than Padma. Then he remembered the rumors he had heard about Michael, about what he had done to a couple of Ravenclaw girls, a couple years below him. Draco didn’t think he wanted someone like that poisoning his team. He wanted everyone to feel safe, so he decided Michael would not be a good fit for the team.
“We should get going Ron, sorry to ditch you here Har, but it’s date night.” Hermione said after a moment of silence.
“We should get somewhere warm soon. We can walk around for now, but this little guy is gonna get cold pretty quick, even with a warming charm.” Harry turned back to Teddy, “Isn’t that right?”
“You’ve played chaser with us at practices,” Harry countered, “And think, you’re probably the only eighth year who’s in shape to play with us.”
When classes restarted the last week of April a sort of cloud swept over the castle. Everyone could feel it. It was in the haunted looks in the eyes of the upper years, the jumpiness in the lower years, the Slytherins watching their backs for ‘vengeance seekers’ more than usual. The teachers assigned less work, despite exams being right around the corner. The first years, especially Muggle borns, became more of the fans they were back in September than the students Harry had come to know.
When Draco finally made it back to the manor, the sun had sunken behind the treetops, basking the sky in a golden-pink hue. Inside, his mum was waiting for him, dinner sitting untouched on the table.
Draco snorted and crossed his arms, leaning against the polished marble that made up this portion of the Ministry wall. He raised his eyebrows ever so slightly and a smile tugged at the edge of his mouth as he looked at Potter. “And how do you expect us to celebrate?” Draco asked, gesturing to the auror who had positioned himself a few meters behind him.
Harry and Hermione had met at Camp Evergreen just before middle school and had been the first people the other came out to back at summer camp. They had been good camp friends for a couple years and the other kids had pressured them into trying to date. One failed first kiss later they both realized they were extremely gay and better off as friends, and became email pen pals during the school years. They didn’t both intend to end up at the same college, it just happened. Once they found out they decided to apply to be roommates together, Timber Coast University was shockingly supportive of coed dorms.
Potter looked so peaceful, sitting there, his knees tucked up against his chest, his cheek rested against the window pane. His lips were parted ever so slightly and his hair, untamable as ever. He looked younger in sleep, without the weight of the world resting on his shoulders. Draco understood that, he was sure he looked like that too, that is, when his dreams weren’t plagued by nightmares.
Harry’s letter was sweet. But it gave Draco false hope that he didn’t want. Harry missed him! But that begged the question; did he miss Harry? If he was honest with himself, then yes, he did miss Harry. But could he tell Harry that? He didn’t think that he could.
“Same as usual?” Harry asked pleasantly as he pulled out a small hot coffee cup and scribbled Draco’s name on it. Draco knew there was no point in answering the question, as Harry clearly already knew what he would say, but he responded anyway.
“Mr. Potter has too much on his plate, already and Weasley, well, he’s more of a follower, I feel he would not make a good leader.” McGonagall explained evenly.
But that couldn’t be real, why would Harry be disappointed? It was more likely that Draco was projecting disappointment at his own cowardice on Harry.
A blonde girl with giant golden hoops in her ears slung an arm around Brittany’s shoulders and slurred, “This one here is a smarty pants.” She pointed at Draco and Pansy accusingly and said, “Did you know she was valedictorian of her class?”
Why the fuck had he gone and lied to Harry? This had been the perfect opportunity to tell him the truth and he had gone and messed it up again. Would he ever cease being a coward? Probably not.
One of the Hufflepuffs, Macmillan, was glaring at him, and in spite of himself, Draco’s heart sank a little. He figured it was a good time to retreat to his room. As he grabbed up his things, he heard Macmillan mutter, “What’s he going to do? If he’ll only take evil pure bloods, he’ll only have half a team.”
He wanted desperately to prove them wrong, to show them, he had not had the life he had envisioned for himself. He had never, truly, wanted to be a death eater, a murderer, despite the fronts he put up. He had even boasted about his task to his friends, on the Hogwarts Express before sixth year.
“Hi dad. I still miss you. I started college this year. I’m almost done with midterms too. You remember that boy who I used to play with next door? He lives in the dorm down the hall from me, we’re friends again. I think. Maybe there’s more there. I can’t tell yet. Sirius and Remus look ready for their moment alone with you. I’ll come back and talk to you next year.” He paused for a second and rested his head on the tombstone, letting his tears fall, “I love you.”
The rest of his spare time was spent hanging out with friends. He had met Ron, who was actually Draco’s roommate in the athletics class he had dropped, but they hit it off and became friends and joined the frisbee club together. He also hung out with Hermione and Pansy and Pansy’s friends, Blaise Neville, and Draco.
Of course Draco thought it had something to do with him, Harry hated himself for making Draco feel that way “It has nothing to do with you.”
He pushed the door to the courtroom open and stepped through. All eyes turned to him while he fought the urge to roll his own. He briskly walked to the place where the witnesses and character advocates sat. He quickly took his seat between McGonagall and Narcissa Malfoy, who had an auror seated on her other side.
Harry had his first free night in weeks due to classes, work, and activities. He had worked a bit ahead and didn’t need to do any homework that night. This was good because Pansy’s roommate had planned a movie night in the game room and the whole building had been invited.
Here’s my chapter! I had a lot of fun writing it, so I hope you like it! Unfortunately, Appie’s going through a bit of writer’s block, so her chapter likely won’t be out tonight. It should be out sometime this weekend though.
In other news, Tay and I used this week to plan through to the end, and it seems like we’re gonna finish and post the epilouge on Christmas Day! The end is (sadly) in sight, but my has this been fun.
The Order had held onto number four as a safe house, so Harry had been able to retrieve his things over the summer. All that stayed in the trunk was the marauder’s map and the invisibility cloak. Most of Harry’s things were still back at Grimmuald place because he didn’t have a use for them during the school year. He had just flopped over onto his bed when he heard the door open.
“We should get moving, I want to drop off my blanket before breakfast.” She smiled and the two made their way back to the dorms in silence.
We will be trying to update weekly. We will be adding two chapters (one for Draco and one for Harry) every Friday!
Draco nodded and slid out of bed, stretching his arms above his head and arching his back. When they reached the Great Hall, they arrived at a bit of a problem. Where to sit? Draco wasn’t sure if Harry would eat with him, they hadn’t really discussed going public. And if Harry did want to eat with Draco, where would they sit? With Harry’s friends or with Draco’s? Or entirely separate from everyone else?
He wondered what Potter would say at his trial. Would he tell the council about everything Draco had done during their time in school together? Or would he stick to the things that happened while Draco was a death eater? Either way, the list was pretty condemning.
Draco tried his best to smile. He wasn’t sure if he had pulled it off, but they entered anyway. Pansy immediately plopped herself down upon the opposite bench, lying comfortably, with her head propped on a hand.
“Since when have you cared about upholding the rules?” Draco asked and he couldn’t keep the bitterness from his voice.
Draco was glad that Harry was putting the past behind him, but he wasn’t too fond of the comparison Harry had drawn between him and Weasley.
All of breakfast was spent with the four of them huddled together at the corner of what had once been the Slytherin table. Draco recounted the entire story, with many interrupted questions from the other three.
“Yeah, my mom is a real charmer. She finds rich assholes, marries them for their money, then divorces them to get half of it.” Blaise explained fondly. “You know, the real dirt of society, the blokes who accumulate all of this wealth and then covet it, leaving the poor to starve in the streets while they watch from their penthouses. Everyone knows what she’s doing, but she donates most of the money, so no one stops her.”
Draco lurched forward slightly in surprise and spluttered out, “What?” He glanced quickly around the room to ensure no one else was listening in.
When the session restarted, Draco was escorted in to hear the verdict. The aurors had pinned his hands behind his back, but Draco didn’t seem to care, his eyes looking up intently at the people who were to decide his mother’s fate.
Draco had absolutely no idea what to say to that so he just said, “Parents are the worst.” Ron nodded agreeably and the two lapsed back into silence, albeit a far more comfortable one than they’d shared in weeks previous. Draco tried his best to focus on the eight page essay he was supposed to be writing for his photography class about what he viewed as the four most under utilized techniques, but he just couldn’t get his mind to really engage in the deep thinking necessary for writing it.
The two walked out the dorm and down the hall. Harry noticed a blond guy carrying a box into his dorm down the hall, he looked a bit dejected. Harry was going to say something to him in an attempt to get to know his new neighbors, but then Hermione pulled him in the opposite direction.
Harry was astounded that no one had interrupted her. She returned to her seat and then it was his turn.
They both turned their attention to Draco. “Do you want to add anyone in?” Maybe he’d be able to invite Harry…
He had gotten a couple books and things for Draco, but that wasn’t really the big present he had planned, he was planning to ask Draco to move in with him after his house arrest was lifted.
“Thank you, that will be all.” The witch said, evening out a stack of paper. “Now for our final witness, Mr. Harry Potter, Order of Merlin, First Class, Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and peer to Mr. Malfoy.” Draco gulped, this was what he was most nervous for, Potter had a lot on him. This could go very poorly.
Draco stepped forward once again and froze. Maybe that was just who Harry was. Maybe Harry just wanted to save everyone, it didn’t mean anything. But still, Harry had deemed him as something worth saving.
Nothing really stood out to him though. All of it were activities that he would certainly like to try at some point with Harry, but not now, not as this big date. He needed to wow Harry with some fantastical, over the top date.
“Did you have a reason for calling me?” Draco asked, anxious for the call to be over with. “It is rather late after all.”
“It was Harry’s idea.” Remus said, “He saw it when we were shopping and thought it’d be good for your dorm.”
“I asked, what was the fine for the offense on this auror report.” Hermione said and she strode over to his desk. “We’re on this page,” She flipped through to page seven and then returned to the front of the room. “Do try and pay attention.” She said, but her smile was knowing and as her eyes flitted over to Harry, she gave herself away.
After that he was pretty sure he had covered his bases. The eighth year Gryffindors had put together a gift for McGonagall, but Hermione was in charge of that. He would go closer to the actual holiday to get sweets for the rest of the eighth years.
“He came out to me about thirty seconds later, so I’d say he’s fine with it.” Shit. He really shouldn’t of said that. Draco didn’t trust Ron, and the jury was out on Hermione. “But do not let him know I told you. He will likely seek vengeance if he found out I told you without his permission.”
“Let’s go back to Hogwarts, I believe we have something to celebrate.” Harry smiled and reached out his hand.
Fear clouded out everything in Draco’s mind as thoughts of the Cruciatus Curse bubbled their way to the surface. He closed his eyes. “I didn’t.” Draco said and loathed how scared he sounded.
Once they were sure he was gone, Harry turned to Draco, rubbing the back of his neck and said, “That went well.”
Fifteen minutes later Draco reentered the room. He peered up into the hard faces of the Wizengamot and gulped. None of their expressions gave any indication of what the outcome would be.
“We moved into a smaller house as soon as the investigation was over. She wanted to be out of the place where her husband died. The killer didn’t take anything or destroy anything, either. We don’t know what they wanted. I think the worst part that came out of that was moving away from my best friend, I never saw him again. I lost my dad and my best friend in the span of two weeks, the one person my age who could have helped, too. I don’t even remember his name, he wanted to be called Prince Dragon whenever we played princes so that’s what I called him. He called me…”
“Black. Hated to go by it. I actually tried to get his grandparents to register me for school as Sirius Potter when I moved in with them.”
After his room number was assigned Harry went up to room seven and settled in. The new eighth year dorms were decked out in the year colors, purple and grey, but the students were allowed to change the colors if they wanted. Harry still hadn’t decided what to do for his colors. He knew for sure he wouldn’t be rooming with another Gryffindor, so his default colors of red and gold were off the table. Harry went over to his trunk and started to unpack. His clothes went into the wardrobe, and his books went to stack on his desk. Hermione insisted that if they were going to teach together Harry would have to be more organized this year.
Draco hadn’t yet moved to the coffee table so he was at the study nook in the corner. Harry went over and tapped him on the shoulder.
Harry woke up early, and noticed that Malfoy was already gone. He likely left early so as not to draw attention, Harry didn’t blame him for that.
“You were the best candidate by far, Mr. Malfoy, now this is no longer up for debate. You will be the captain and you will run the tryouts this Saturday. Am I understood?” She asked severely.
Draco followed the witch into the circular room and took the empty seat beside his mother. She was bound to the chair, just as he had been during his trial. When he sat, he expected the chains to entrap his as well, but they remained dormant. He sighed, a little relieved.
“Punish the Dark Lord’s supporters who had failed him, mostly. He was ordered to kill Dumbledore too.” Dolohov drawled, quieter now, less angry.
“That’s good I guess. My parents told me to hold off on a job until sophomore year. And I might just end up doing internships then so it might not be feasible to do that. Also I checked out the cultural clubs and there’s no Indian cultural club, there’s a multiethinc club that spends a few weeks on various cultures and gets a bunch of guest speakers to share though. You could head to the fair and ask them about it.”
His confidence in the team fluctuated constantly, resulting in him telling each person a different thing. If they all got together and discussed Draco’s responses, they’d find that he really had no idea how it was going to go.
Harry headed back to his room that night and fell asleep rather quickly, tired from flying all afternoon. Once he fell asleep he started seeing faces of those that were gone, hearing spells fire and rebound, screams of pain coming though the night. He was hot, the room was on fire. Flaming animals coming at him from every direction. He was flying trying to get out, but he couldn’t. The scene morphed into flash after flash of green light aimed at loved ones, and then at him. Just as it neared him he jolted awake in bed.
The whole team glared at him as the coach made them all run suicides as punishment for his tardiness.
Harry returned home to Grimmuald after dinner on Christmas Eve. He was a bit wiped after playing quidditch in the snow all day. He was ready to crash into bed and sleep for eternity.
“If by ‘let’ you mean she didn’t stop him, then yes, she let him set his base at our house. But do not be mistaken, she did not want him there. At that point, even my dad was sick of him. But there was no stopping him, not if you wanted to live.”
Harry, though technically not a prefect or a house quidditch team captain, the eighth years didn’t have a house team, was allowed to use the prefects bathroom as he was a ‘junior teacher,’ which was what the position had been officially named. He made his way down to the fifth floor, and by the time he returned to eighth year dorm seven, Malfoy was in the last stages of getting ready for bed.
The party was small, whoever organized it had limited it to the two floors of their building. Harry and Hermione ended up spending time with a group that consisted of cute blond guy, his name was Draco, and dark haired girl named Pansy that Hermione hit it off with immediately. Around ten a guy named Blaise came up to the group with another guy, intorducing him as Neville.
With each passing day, Draco’s father got worse and worse, angrier and angrier. “I like it here, father! I am not going back home and I am certainly not transferring!” He screamed into the phone before smashing his thumb against the red end call button.
She strode to the door, and threw it open. She was pulling it closed behind her when she paused and said over her shoulder, “Good luck with your roommate.”
“Aside from the look of utter boredom on your face? I was in the astronomy tower at the end of our sixth year and better yet I was spying on you for the entire thing. I know that you mastered both occlumency and legilimency.” He said, and was that a faint blush staining his cheeks? Perhaps it was just the lighting... or Draco’s imagination... or his mind playing tricks on him, making him see what he wanted to see. But was that what he wanted to see? Did he want Harry to be blushing at him? His mind and feelings towards the boy who lived were a jumbled mess that would take weeks, maybe even months to unravel. And even then, would he ever act on what he discovered?
