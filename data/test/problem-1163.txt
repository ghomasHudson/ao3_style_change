Draco didn’t cry anymore, he didn’t shiver nor did he whimper. He just wanted it to end. Harry couldn’t stop staring at this wonderful painting. He took a step closer and felt this perfection with his bare hands. Slowly he let his hands explore the body before him. The dark haired man licked his lips, tasting blood on them. He looked down on himself. Small drops of blood stained his clothes all over. Harry took in his rock hard member through his all too tight jeans. Slowly he dropped his clothes, never stopping to tenderly caress Dracos abused body. Draco didn’t see any of this. His teary eyes stared blankly down onto the blurred grey stone floor sprinkled with the remains of his clothes. Draco didn’t feel the tender touch on his burning skin. His whole body felt numb. But Draco suddenly did feel the big cock filling him up from inside and he did see the lust in those green eyes when Potter set for an almost tender pace, fucking him dry yet again.
“Crucio.” The curse hit Malfoy by surprise. “Don’t you dare ever do that again.” Harry spat at him. The dark haired man grabbed Malfoy by his collar and lifted him up after he had fallen to the ground when he got hit by the pain. He dragged the trembling mess with him downstairs to his dungeons. The ones he had Kreacher get updated for his purposes. He would put them to good use now. Potter chained Malfoy to the wall shaking a bit himself. He was furious. He was pained. He was afraid. He was confused. And someone would have to pay for that.
Draco Malfoy started to shiver slightly under Harry Potter when his licks became rougher and turned to bites of hate and lust. He wanted to make him hurt and it felt so good so right – Harry Potter was rock hard in his Pyjama pants. ”Good morning slut” Harry said still tracing the bruises and newly made bite marks with his tongue. He was almost painfully aroused when he took one Dracos slightly hard nipples into his mouth and bit the sensitive skin. He slightly sucked it in and when he let it out again it was a nice and shy shade of pink. Like a girls, almost cute, almost innocent and extremely sexy combined with Draco Malfoys soft almost unhearable moans. “ Did you sleep well” Harry almost asked softly, like he would ask his love in the morning after she woke up next to him smiling her soft and sleepy smile after a good nights sleep. He had not seen that in ages. Harry Potter was rock hard. No it wasn’t because of Malfoy. Dracos all too skinny body and whoreish moans did not torn him an. He was a good man, he was a hero. Slap.
Draco was confused he just stood their shivering unable to do anything. “Don’t make me repeat myself Malfoy or you will regret it!” Harry said in a much darker voice and Draco immediately moved and slipped under the blanket. And he drifted off to sleep so easily with a full stomach and finally a warm and cozy feeling.
Merlin has had it. For years he had been serving a spoiled little prince and his only to hope to shape Arthur into a great king made him kept going. Now that he had left Gwen and actually ruled after his fathers death nothing seemed to have changed. Merlin was so done with cowering at Arthurs feet never being appreciated always treated like shit, after all he did for his prince and now king who actually acted more like a childish princess than anything else. Arthur was never going to be a good king. All of Merlins efforts had changed anything about that and he was really tiered of keep trying it. In his dreams he took matters into his own hands and crownd himself the new King of Camelot, but what to do with Arthur. Merlin had dreamed about Arthur before over the years how could he not. Arthur with his sensual curves and exquisite butt, his plush lips that would look so lovely around Merlins hard cock. Merlin had dressed Arthur for years seen him naked a hundred times how could he not have noticed the almost feminine beautiful body of his prince and now king. In his mind a cruel plan formed. But Merlin had to be careful what he was going to do would take time, great power and a lot of planning. He had to get even stronger and he had to research a lot of dark magic in order to fulfill his desires. During that time it was almost unbearable for him to keep serving Arthur but his thoughts at night kept him going.
Harry sat down at the kitchen table and enjoyed the breakfast Kreacher made him like every other morning. Afterwards he answered some letters before he made himself presentable with the swing of his wand. He was almost running late for an interview on the radio. And without another thought about Draco he left.  After two more interviews with a magazine and the newspaper and a long shopping trip with Hermione Harry went home for a late lunch in the afternoon. Kreacher brought him everything he needed to the big table in the dining hall. Everything was set up but Draco was not there. “Malfoy” Harry was furious. He almost screamed the name. No response. Where was that stupid street hooker.
“Merlin I don’t understand… please… is this a dream… what” Merlin slapped Arthur in the face. “Stop that babbeling. I am your master now and you are going to be my beautiful bride. The sooner you except this the easier it will be for yourself. I am so done with you pushing me around, after all I did for you and you never ever apricated any of it. I am done with it Arthur and I won’t take it any longer. So I took matters into my own hands now.” Arthurs stunned face locked so delicious. Merlin smiled at him brightly and slowly started to touch Arthurs almost naked body. “No… how did you… who gave you this charm…what” Merlin laughed bright and loud. “ You don’t get it do you? Are you really this dumb Arthur? I am a sorcerer. How did  you think you came so far? You would be nothing without me Arthur. I saved your life a hundred times with my magic. You are not capable of being a king and ruling this country all this time I have done that for you and I don’t want to do it from the background any longer. I will take my rightful place at the throne and you are lucky that you are so pretty that I kept you alive to be my queen. You’re not good for anything else than getting fucked and looking pretty anyway so why not make a living of it.” Arthur couldn’t believe the words that came out of his servants mouth. Betrayal was all he could feel. How could his servant, his friend do this to him. His whole body trembled while he cried. “You won’t get through with this... you can’t … my people won’t except this they will..” Merlin kissed him again. “ Oh sweatheart… I already did. I changed everyone’s memory except for yours. They all think you were born a girl and your father forced you to dress and act like a prince because he couldn’t stand having a daughter except for a son. Your people pity you for this fate and hated your father for it and all they wish for is for you to become who you are and be their beautiful queen.” Arthur screamed. He cried and trashed in denial. “No… You are lying… Why? Why would you do that?” Merlin chuckled and got of the bed. “Because this is so much sweeter. I want you to become my queen willingly and I wanted you to remember what and who you used to be but of course I had to make sure that nothing would be in my way. All you have to do now is surrender and except who you really are. I have seen the woman in your for years Arthur. You are weak and fragile and I always had to protect you. Except who you really are my love, what you really are and we can be happy together.” Arthur screamed and trashed around wildly having a major anger attack like a little girl. “No! I will never do that! I will never be your Queen! Never ever never!!” Merlin just mumbled a spell and suddenly Arthur stood before him. The sorcerer petted his cheek and with another spell Arthur was dressed in the beautiful gown that Merlin had brought with him. It was the most beautiful  dress Merlin had ever seen and Arthur looked stunning. He turned him around so Arthur could see himself in the mirror. “Now tell me doll, aren’t you going to be the most beautiful queen of them all. Tell me you really think you were not made for this.” Arthur just kept crying. “No…please….no”
“Really Malfoy, it’s ok. I’m not mad, and I’m not here to pass judgement on anyone’s abilities, kneazle or otherwise. I just wanted to ask you if you knew where she came from, and since it seems like she’s yours, I suppose I’ll just leave her here, and you can…  get ready for your inspection? Which, again, I am not here for, I’m just here to return the kitten.” Harry tried to lift Chrysanthemum off the shoulder of his robes as a gesture of good faith, but she dug her claws in and refused to be moved.
“I know. It’s honestly not very fair. I didn’t give you a choice, and I should have. I just wanted to make my mark on the industry so badly, but it’s all just witches and wizards and magical people who’ve been doing it for thousands of years, and never want to see anything new, or anything different, and they hardly ever issue invites to their cat shows. Honestly, I got extremely lucky with this idea, and with the retirement of Brunhilda, who cared more about the health and safety of her kneazles than she did about tradition, for which I am forever thankful. I’d actually thought about sending you a card, but that would have meant admitting what I’d done, and I was pretty sure you didn’t know, or I thought you would have said something. And back in school, I told myself that I wasn’t like the rest of them, that I saw you just as a person, not as some big magical hero, but then the second it was convenient for me to do so, I capitalized on your big hero-ness. And I hate that, and it makes me doubt myself, which I also hate, and I don’t like hating. So, in conclusion, I’m sorry.” Malfoy looked rather cross, but the apology seemed sincere enough. His nose went pink, which Harry remembered from Hogwarts as a sure sign that Malfoy was embarrassed.
The gray kneazle let out a wail, which was matched by a squeaky meow from the kitten in his hand. After a moment more of squiggling, somehow Harry ended up with his arms full of large gray kneazle, who was frantically grooming the small kitten perched atop of it, purring loudly, and stopping only to growl occasionally at Harry whenever he shifted his arms.
The door to Magical Menagerie opened with a creak, and Harry was hit with the sounds and scents of a multitude of animals. Everyone seemed to be talking or hooting or wheezing at once, and Harry felt briefly overwhelmed, the way he did when he stepped into his office in the mornings and work. He almost turned around and left, but then the tiny warm body on his shoulder stretched and squeaked, and he realized he would be stuck at home with the kneazle, and no closer to finding a solution if he turned back now.
One of the kneazles must have felt Harry’s approach, because it yawned and stretched, revealing a delicate pink tongue and tiny, gleaming, pointed white teeth. It then blinked sleepily, and turned to look at Harry.
Harry felt all hot and uncomfortable. The desire to stand up and leave on any pretext was very strong. He ignored the roiling in his gut and stayed where he was, examining his nails as if they were the most fascinating thing in the world.
Harry barely had time to feel stressed about meeting his former childhood nemesis when he actually took a good look at the figure who entered the room. There was no doubt that it was Draco, but it was a Draco that Harry had never imagined he would one day see.
When he flipped the card over again, a floo address appeared where before there had only been a blank space. Harry stared harder, certain that he must be mistaken. There was no way that he was standing in a shop holding the floo address to Malfoy Manor.
“Er, not really a task, Kreacher, and thank you for soup, I’ll be sure to eat some, it really does smell good. I just thought maybe you had something you wanted to say to me? About, er, this? I mean, it’s fine if you have, uhm, relations, who want to stay, it’s just, I’ve never really interacted with a baby house elf before, and I don’t quite know what they need. Am I supposed to babysit? Should you really leave it alone while you’re in the kitchen?” Harry said, pointing at the small being still perched on the arm of his couch.
This startled the kitten, who woke up, ambled over to the corner of the couch, and promptly began chewing on the leather. Harry could see her sharp little teeth begin to make dents in the corner of his couch, and decided that Hermione had a point. Reaching out, he scooped up the kitten, and held her at eye level. She squirmed, and let out a plaintive meow. Harry attempted to soothe her.
“Harry, I’m sure you’re more than capable of handling this situation- you’re a fully qualified auror- one kneazle kitten is well within your capabilities! And besides, I can only stay for a moment- Ron and I have a date tonight, you know that. It’s Thursday! We always go out on Thursdays. Really, I only stopped in because you seemed like you were about to panic in the floo, and you seem much less frantic now, so I’m sure you can handle this,” Hermione said.
At this pronouncement, the noble beast in question decided it was done eating the tuna, and looked up again at Harry, who had not moved from his spot next to the couch since this whole debacle began. It had little flecks of tuna on its face, and was attempting to swipe them with a paw, and then eat them off the paw, all the while still purring in a low, soothing rumble.
Ahhhh you guys! This fic has fanart! I am definitely feeling #blessed. Check out the related works to see the absolutely INCREDIBLE drawings of Chrysanthemum and the Potteazles :D I am not sure what I did to deserve these gifts from such an amazingly talented and attractive human, but I gotta hope I keep doing them! Things I have learned from this pandemic: flirt with cute girls- it leads to fanart for your fic. Hope you all enjoy!
“A fine little beast indeed, who is eating to grow big and strong! What an example for others to follow, what an inspiration, yes. Kreacher does not mind that a kneazle kitten now lives in the house, oh no, of course he does not, but he does wish that perhaps he might have been informed before hand, so that he might make the necessary preparations- poor, good kitty, Kreacher does not even have a bed to offer in this trying time!”
“Yes, well, leaving my lack of kneazle knowledge aside, Hermione, you must have SOME idea of what to do. You always have an idea of what to do- it’s one of your finest qualities!” Harry said, giving her a winning smile. It hadn’t worked on Hermione since before they left Hogwarts, but Harry was feeling a little overwhelmed. His plans for the evening had definitely not included a surprise kitten.
At the sound of her name, the kitten in Harry’s arms perked up, and stopped snuggling with the older gray cat (Rowena, apparently) and gave a sweet, friendly meow, a quick lick to Harry’s arm, and then went back to Rowena.
Mrs Darsley chuckled, startling them both. “So salty! I like you, Harry. You remind me of my big love; she was such a brilliant girl, you know? But the temper. Wow, she was easily inflamed, let me tell you. But I loved her… and you two remind me of us.”
Potter seemed to snap out of the moment at the mention of the turtle and his cheeks quickly tinged a blotched red.
“You will.” A crazy glint lit Harry’s eyes, and for a moment, Draco’s spent cock gave a minuscule jolt.
“Like this?” He murmured into Harry’s ear, making him shiver, a moan escaping his mouth, his hips pushing back towards Malfoy’s touch.
spaghetti hanging from his plate. He loved how simple Sweet Prophecies felt, even though there were some weird and delicious dishes on the menu. “You agree this is the best restaurant in London, though.”
No, thanks. Draco preferred not to take such risks. He stood at the entrance to his flat, sending his coat, scarf, hat and gloves to dry next to the fireplace. He took off his shoes and soaked socks and deliberately looked at the sofa.
"What! Draco! It's the Muggle equivalent of porn Pensieves. I can't believe you still don't know a thing about Muggle culture."
“Wait a moment, you horrid beast. You have a problem, you lick everything! Since I’ve known you, even at Hogwarts, before eating— and strangely enough, you did it with weird random things like books or quills too. It’s your thing. How the fuck can you be a chef?”
Harry stared at him. “Malfoy, don’t… don’t apologise or say things like please. You’re creeping me out!”
“That’s not real! It’s not possible, c’mon!” Rose’s cheeks coloured a deep red, almost covering her freckles, her hands trying to cover her face.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow to her but a knowing smirk was playing on his lips. “Let’s go, then,” he drawled out.
But this was different. Harry somehow felt wrong for watching Draco during his sleep, like some kind of creepy stalker, but the thought never abandoned him. The thought that he could have maybe…
Harry looked at her and then at his friends, who were waving at him and mouthing some greetings. And then he looked at Malfoy.
At that moment, Harry's wand started vibrating against his thigh, and judging by Malfoy's startled move, his wand was too.
Harry’s hands tightened around the wrapping of Teddy’s present and his eyes snapped to Andromeda. She was apparently concentrated on knitting some sort of coloured scarf and wasn’t paying attention to the fact that a former Death Eater happened to be in her house.
“I don’t know what you’re trying to imply, Dean. He’s just helping me breaking this stupid bond.” He knew they wouldn’t let it go the moment Luna wiggled her eyebrows and scooted closer to Harry, careful not to touch him.
“It means that whatever we’re doing in this time-travel, our interactions with the Muggles we meet and work with, our wanderings through the city, everything we say and do without even realising it, we’re leaving an impact, we’re leaving something behind. Something our past selves already lived.”
“Bottom,” Potter said without hesitation. “Fuck, Malfoy, I want you to fuck me so hard I won’t even remember my own name when you’re finished.”
Right, this whole time travelling affair was making Harry forget about his bond, the ache from the trips distracting him from the ache of the bond. Muttering a 'thanks', he gulped his potion and Hermione hurried to open the Time Machine.
It's not like Harry had a problem with alcohol, if anything, he had a problem with people and often used alcohol as socialising fuel; and that usually meant he was fucking with strangers whose names got forgotten the moment after orgasm.
“Where have you been?” Draco snapped, getting out of bed and casting a perfect drying charm on Harry. Harry sighed, choking out, “I want to hug you.”
Harry finally turned to face him. His head was throbbing and he felt drained of every ounce of energy.
After that moment, they started talking more and grew more friendly. In hindsight, Harry should have recognised some Veela-like signs, even before
"I've got to go, an emergency call! I'll be right back to finish checking on you, Mr Potter, and fill you in on your conditions. In the meantime, I'm sure my colleague, Draco, can answer your questions."
“You think you can fool me?” Potter’s voice was half-amused, half-nervous, which had Draco opening his eyes to look at him. Potter’s head was resting against the wall, his gaze drawn somewhere towards the bed. He clicked his tongue again and continued. “You flirt with other guys to get me angry and possessive and out of control.”
“He has always been a big part of your life, Draco.” Pansy’s tone was warm, as it was every time she tried to make Draco rationalise.
Tori shook her head and winked. “Nah, you’re fine.” Ginevra was laughing next to her. Draco looked around the table, but everyone seemed just as baffled as Harry and him.
“Shut up! You’re just sour because you lost the bet. While I’m still in. So, Harry, the House?” Seamus grins and the situation is so abnormal that Harry finds himself mirroring his same grin.
Astoria laughed uncontrollably at that, keeping her hands on her belly. “Please! It’s in the freezer.”
Boring. Boring and annoying. And boring. Good lord, was it even normal that Draco couldn’t have any fun at the pub if he couldn’t encourage Potter’s jealousy by flirting with random blokes?
“She’s right, Draco. It’ll be splendid, okay? Now, hurry up or you’ll miss your Portkey,” Pansy said from her seat next to Hermione. She smiled and kissed her cheek softly, whispering in her ear, “We could go to Paris too, sometime.”
He felt like all of Harry’s dreams merged together, like bread given to a starving man. WIth a frustrated noise, Draco snatched Harry’s hand off his cock and grasped it himself, lining it up with his hole, and lowering himself on it until the head slipped in.
for breakfast. Then he pinched his arm in the strongest way possible to stop himself thinking such rubbish.
Draco bumped his shoulder against Potter’s, feeling his heartbeat race at impossible speed against his ribcage.
When Draco’s eyes reached Potter’s bare ankles, knobby but elegant, his cock was already hard and he felt more confused than ever.
“I—” Harry furrowed his brow as he watched Malfoy press himself against some faceless, sturdy-looking guy. “What do you mean,
Harry’s so confused he can feel his thoughts painfully crossing his mind, zig-zagging around. When Zabini sighs and turns to go out of the classroom, Harry snaps out of his stupor.
Malfoy looks up at Harry and he’s smiling— it’s open and unbridled, it makes Harry’s head spin. Then his lips shift, the smile turns into a smirk and he clamps hard around Harry’s knot until Harry cries out and starts coming again, feeling it start from the tip of his toes.
Malfoy stood up, knocking down the remaining liquor in his glass and putting it on the coffee table. He giggled as he started unbuttoning his shirt. “I knew it,” he said, still laughing softly. Harry’s cock leaked pre-cum as he watched him undress. Somehow he managed to be both sexy and funny and Harry found himself laughing on the couch, biting his lower lip with a hand on his cock the entire time.
Draco looked into Harry's eyes, a mix of pride and envy at how easy magic came to Harry in every situation. He smirked and pulled his fingers all the way out Harry's arse.
Harry snorted, shaking lightly his head. Malfoy’s fingers still on his lips. “Merlin, why Malfoy.” He laughed, lost in the memory. “Fifth year. How can I forget… you conjured a bed,” Harry turned to point somewhere in the middle of the room, “right there.”
As soon as Harry unlocked the wards and stepped foot in Grimmauld Place, confused shouting and yelling reached his ears.
His friends started giggling, Ron snorted next to him. Seamus looked at him with a big grin, the kind one uses with particularly daft kids. “Sure, buddy.
Draco cast an extremely strong wandless and wordless locking spell on the door of the room and a powerful
Harry nodded again, biting his lips. He wasn’t sure he could hold back the tears if he tried to talk.
“Ah, you’d like that,” he drawled, raising an eyebrow and jutting out his chin a bit, staring into Draco’s eyes.
Astoria suddenly started laughing, to Draco and Scorpius’ surprise. “I can’t believe this! We also hosted the campaign in favour of gay marriage. We participated actively in giving you this opportunity! Aren’t you lucky, Draco? It’s like I gave you my blessing.”
“I mean, I do need money to buy the ingredients. So… I’d need a job. And you, too. We’ll glamour and… but I’m sure they’ll fix this and we’ll be back in no time.”
Malfoy glowered at him, splashed orange juice into Harry’s glass with what Harry thought was more force than necessary, and sighed deeply. “
Cheeks softly rosed, tongue often slipping out to wet his lips, barely-there chuckles that made Harry’s heart skip beat after beat.
Six months in, and Harry was dying with frustration. Every time they watched a movie with Boo-boo or went out eating all together like a happy family, he’d think he wanted to hug Draco, hold his hand, kiss him, stroke his hair, anything, anything to have some contact. But the potion only helped his bond to be dormant, not to shield him from the pain he’d feel when touching someone else.
flirting. Interesting, I should reconsider your behavior during our years at Hogwarts.” He raised an eyebrow and brought a hand to Draco’s face, his fingers feather soft on his jaw. “So, you like my piercing.”
Harry was twenty-five the first time he discovered he was in love with his Sir. It happened by accident.
Draco had spent the last year dreaming of their first kiss. He'd usually imagined it as rushed, rough, all teeth and tongue, desperate and greedy, as their sexual encounters mostly were. Nothing prepared him for what kissing Harry Potter was actually like.
"Two teaspoons of cold milk and one of sugar. I remember it because I always thought it was kinda posh. Who takes his tea with a precise amount of milk and sugar, always the same?"
Potter only shrugged. “Maybe. What do you know, Malfoy.” He smiled and pointed to the turtle, now gently rocking with the water conjured by Draco.
The kiss was tender and soft, only lips brushing against lips at first. Then Harry moaned and licked along the seam of Draco’s mouth, begging for entry. Draco complied, parting his lips, finally letting Harry take possession of every fibre of his being.
“I know why you took it. Voldemort was evil, he probably put you in a threatening situation. You must have felt trapped. New question, then.”
Harry didn’t know what he expected to hear after this confession, but it surely wasn’t a sudden burst of laughter from every single person in the circle.
Okay, so he was still completely pissed. A shiver ran through Harry's body, reminding him he was naked in January. He could be so sick the next day, Hermione would probably have his throat.
“Of course he will!” His voice cracked a bit in the end. He glared at Ron and shrugged. “Why do you ask?”
Potter’s cheeks flushed crimson, his mouth opened and closed several times, until he just closed it and brought a hand to his hair, picking up a lily and staring at it awestruck.
When they’d finished —with Harry’s spunk splattered on the floor, Malfoy still balls-deep inside Harry— Malfoy gripped Harry’s hair, pulling
As soon as Ron finished muttering, however, Malfoy’s face gained back some colour and a faint red ring formed at the base of both Harry’s and Malfoy’s pinkies.
“Draco, I could never hate you. Please, just go to sleep in the living room. I can’t take anything more.”
When Harry finally finds Draco and Goyle at the shore of the Black Lake they look like they’re having a fight and Harry’s not sure how to approach them.
Malfoy’s eyes widened before speaking again. He smiled, turning to quickly press a kiss to Harry’s hand. “But then, Severus talked to me.”
He lapped at the furled skin with the flat of his tongue and Harry saw stars. He panted, “M-Malfoy, please, I beg you… s-suck—”
Malfoy’s cheeks went a delicious pink again and his eyes widened minutely, darting for one second to Harry and then returning to Pansy. He spluttered, “I-I don’t care about Potter’s
Draco’s voice was strained, nearly hysterical, and he wondered for a second if being surrounded by so many Gryffindors all the time was starting to affect him. Then he remembered that time when he was twelve years old, and his father asked him if he had finally beaten Potter at Quidditch. Draco had choked on air, grasped the edge of the table and blurted, “Yes! No! I don’t know, don’t kill me!”
“Potter, please, let me finish. And don’t jump to conclusions as usual. Severus, he told me he knew about us. He said it was dangerous, that Voldemort would have killed me the moment he’d seen in my mind I loved you. I didn’t know Snape was a spy at the time, but he scared me. It got me thinking… and I feared Voldemort would have used our relationship to get to you… I… Harry, I know now I didn’t make the wisest choices, but—”
Draco gasped, more amused than scandalised. It had been clear for a while that Harry’s passion for tasting and licking didn’t actually disgust Draco. “That would be so—”
Not an hour later, you’re bent over a desk in a forgotten classroom. Potter’s on his knees, licking your arsehole.
“What the actual fu — ” “Is this true?” “Mum, how are you?” Lily went running to hug Ginny, covering her face with kisses. She looked completely taken aback, but soon enough relaxed in her hug, whispering, “Oh Merlin, thanks, Lily.”
Once out of the building, as memories of the exact location of the building were abandoning Harry, Malfoy turned on his heels to glare at Hermione.
Potter chuckled, dropping his gaze to the floor. “Well, yes. I missed it a lot this week, you know?” He finally raised his eyes, bright and greener than ever. Draco wondered if it was possible to love a colour, and, if so, he was certain he loved green. Not all greens, but the exact shades of green he was looking at right at that moment.
Stupid freckled Gryffindork, how dare he! Ready to kill, Draco replied, “I’m his boyfriend! For six years this year! I—”
"You know I fell in love with you when I saw you dying your hair for the first time. It's become a regular thing now, but black doesn't suit you. Time for a change!"
Harry stopped, blinking. “Hey, I needed those!” He snorted and lowered his head, attacking Draco’s nipples with his tongue, licking them and gently taking them between his teeth. Draco gasped and pushed his hips up from the couch, searching some sort of relief against Harry’s body.
She softly laughed, shaking her head. “I only did it so now you’d owe me. You know, Slytherins, we’ve got no friends, only convenient arrangements, and all that… But don’t change the topic.” She moved her head so that they were now looking into each other’s eyes.
“Try the chicken.” He said and sat down next to Malfoy. “It is very tender. You would like it.” Draco frowned. “Excuse me, but what? Are you actually insane? That’s it ? That’s the situation right now? You are just going to pretend like nothing happened?” Harry tried to control the rage that started to build up inside of him. It was hard but he managed to steady himself a bit and just took one chicken leg and put it n Malfoys plate. “I didn’t mean you do not fit my personal beauty standards. You look unhealthy and not like yourself. That’s why I want you to put on some weight.” Malfoy laughed dryly but took a bite out of the chicken. “Right and that’s why you make me wear these clothes because they make me look more like myself.” The dark haired wizard smirked. “No that is to make you feel ridiculous after all you told me you dress like this because that is what people want you to wear so I thought I would keep that up for you. After all you are a hooker so maybe it would be easier for you to keep being dressed like one so you don’t loose yourself.” Draco helped himself with some chips and salad while watching Harry closely.  He seemed calm but tense. Draco wasn’t sure what he was up to. “ Ok cut the crap now and just tell me what it is you want. You are jumping from being friendly to being cruel and from being disgusted by me to being aroused. After all that happened you can’t tell me you are trying to help me out but if you want to get revenge you are doing a pretty lousy job too. So what exactly is this?” Harry just shrugged. “ I don’t know.” Draco frowned and stopped eating. “ What do you mean you don’t know? Are you fucking with me Potter?” Harry laughed. “Well I kind of did.” Draco growled. “Seriously Malfoy, I don’t know. Yesterday I felt bad for you and I actually wanted to help you. Then you made me so mad and I just wanted to get back at you for being such a brat all the time. It’s an up and down and I seriously lost track of myself most of the time. I don’t enjoy hurting you but I don’t enjoy not hurting you either. I just don’t know what I am doing right know. That’s why I am trying to keep everyone at distance. I don’t want to hurt anybody but that’s what happens to people that are close to me. They get killed or hurt and I can’t protect them I can’t protect anybody. But that’s what people want me to. They want me to be the hero. They want me to be always smiling full of hope talking about making the world a better place and looking forward to the future. But that is not who I am. I killed Voldemort. I am a murderer. I lost almost everybody. And I know it’s not your fault but it’s easier to blame it all on you than blame it on myself. Because I am the weak one. I couldn’t save anyone all I did was hurt and kill and somehow I survived even though I really just wanted to die. I am a pathetic mess that can barely put himself together.” Draco sat in silence listening to the great Harry Potter putting himself down until he couldn’t take it anymore. “ That is not true. You saved me. You could have left me for death in that fire but you didn’t. You could have let me rot in Azkaban for all my crimes but you didn’t. You could have killed me when you got captured in our mansion and you fled with your friends but you didn’t. You saved me for a hundred times and I am sure if you did that to a person you hate you saved the people you love a hundred times more than you did save me Potter.” Harry was stunned. It actually felt could talking to someone. Ginny had begged him to open up to someone but somehow he had been too afraid to open up to anybody about what was going through his mind. And Draco Malfoy actually told him that he was wrong. After all he did just hours ago. After he practically raped him just this morning and tortured him and everything that happened in Hogwarts. How could he not tell Harry that he was pathetic and  that he hated him. “ I almost killed you. I almost killed you yesterday and in 6th grade. Draco I raped you this morning. I cursed you, I threated you like a whore.” Draco laughed dryly. “Potter I am a whore. I am a hooker you found in the streets at 4 o’clock in the morning. You can’t really call that rape. You did pay me after all and didn’t I sign a contract for that? And well yeah you almost killed me but you didn’t. And trust me Potter I have been cursed before. And I did bad things too. I broke your nose, I bullied you and you know all the things I did during the war. If you really want to blame someone it shouldn’t be yourself or me or anyone. It was all of us. There isn’t good and bad people. Everyone is capable of doing everything.” Harry looked at Malfoy, stunned. “When did you become so wise? You sound like a Psychologist” The blonde wizard just shrugged. “I had a lot of time to think since you left this morning. It just felt good letting all these thoughts out loud for once. I didn’t really get the chance to talk to anyone in the past 2 years.” Harry wanted to say something but he was searching for the right words. This wasn’t so easy after all.
, they had said. To see if you were able to think quickly, discern what was true from what wasn’t. Draco had made it his own personal goal to be the best prankster in the entire Department.
Draco’s mouth dropped open, but he had no idea what to say in return. This entire conversation was bordering on something too intimate for a friends-with-benefits situation and the air around Draco started to feel too thick.
“Yeah, and the best one, as the newspapers seem to think.” The smirk appeared again on Potter’s face, and Draco felt his ears heating up. Thank Merlin for his now perpetual tanned skin since arriving in Bacalar the first time.
“Something’s wrong!” Draco hissed loudly, the people from the adjoining tables to his turning in surprise. Draco didn’t care. He was still in shock from his morning.
You don’t do these things, usually. Usually, you take your time, preparing your partner, but Potter’s words are hot in your mind.
. He should remember it. “You know Potter and I are only fuck-buddies. We’re not dating. There’s no eating together in a restaurant, no walks hand-in-hand down Diagon Alley, no breakfasts or brunches.
Something crossed Harry’s mind between one moan and the next. He wanted sex to be consensual, and when he’d expressed his concern to the Healers at St. Mungo’s that it might not be, they had told him that his Allure didn’t work like that. They told him that his Veela inheritance was weak, but that his Allure was triggered by sexual attraction. “It triggers it
“We know, we know, Harry. But everything is solved now, and you came out to the Wizarding World and it kinda seems like things are working out? We… are surely making the effort. Don’t push your luck too much, though?” Ginevra stuck her tongue out at them and downed her champagne in one-go.
Draco shifted his head, curling it even more into the crook of Harry’s neck, shutting his eyes closed so much Harry felt his eyelashes brushing his skin. His lips were dangerously close to Harry’s neck and his voice came out muffled. “I thought you didn’t want people to see you are friendly with me.”
Pansy smiled too, trying to hide it behind her bread. “It’s my job. I run a magazine and personally write the food critique section. I need to be sceptical when I set foot in a new place. I want to give objective information to my readers. And you have to agree with me, the first time we entered here, it looked like a giant Chinese dragon just vomited an ocean of confetti around it.”
"Why are you so red in the face? Are you sick?" Boo-boo asked, trying to put his little transparent hand on Harry's forehead and frowning when it passed through.
“Um, Draco, love? This isn’t mine.” But before Harry’s words could reach his ears, Draco saw stars in front of his eyes and passed out, vaguely aware of Harry hurrying towards him and catching him in his arms.
my mother’s death. Remus told me the Dementors make you relive the worst memories of your life, so that made sense, but I was so little… I always asked myself how could I remember so well the green light, my mother shouting my name.”
Snickering, Draco bought the magazine, spending the time it took him to get to his flat convincing himself he wasn’t gonna check the poll.
, then started kissing Harry again, whispering on his skin, “love, my love, so beautiful, so sweet, I love you, my love” over and over again.
"I know it too by now!" Boo-boo exclaimed, clapping his thin hands soundlessly, floating between the two of them.
“But no one was supposed to know where I was. It was a secret mission.” Malfoy’s expression was deeply perplexed until realisation dawned. “Fuck, you can— your Veela tells you where I am, doesn’t it? And the other day! After sex, you practically
Somehow, Draco managed to remove one of his hands from the table to pick up his glass and empty it in one gulp.
The temptation to reply and make Malfoy’s rant start all over again was suddenly so strong Harry had some difficulty masking his snort.
ed his mobile and took a photo of Malfoy's picture, sending it to his friends' Whatsapp group — The Mighty Lions.
"So what! Am I doomed to live in a curse once again?! Can't you… you're the fucking best, aren't you, Malfoy? Can't you just break this damned bond?"
Harry side-eyed Draco walking past him, breathed in the crisp autumn air, smiled to the cold sun. It was a good day.
"Potter’s chasing the Snitch like a horny Hippogriff who forgot how to fly. A Quaffle approaches but Jacob kicks it low into the opponent's area. Game’s back on for Harry Potter, he may do it this time, Jacob's smiling and Potter… Potter fails! He drops the sex bomb, stumbles over his drunken words, and faints on the counter—"
Shamelessly, in front of everyone, until Ron had spluttered an embarrassed, “Get a room! We want to play too!” And they’d parted.
Harry held his gaze, smirked. Malfoy could never resist him when he tantalised him, his Dom side singing at the possibility of showing exactly who was in control.
“I’m not one to judge, really,” Gary said, amused. He shrugged lightly as he approached the creation, scrutinising it up close. “Yes,” he declared. “It looks like a giant cock.”
Harry’s cheeks again turned a deeper colour, and he exhaled loudly before speaking. “Look, you’re right. It
“Nngh, honey, you’re so fucking hot and tight…” Harry whispered, holding onto him for dear life. Draco smiled hotly, his cheeks showing two perfect dimples, melting Harry’s already nonexistent bones. He lowered again, slowly, until he bottomed out and was fully seated on Harry’s cock.
Malfoy licked his lips. “Here’s what we’ll do.” He closed his eyes and spelled himself naked, wordlessly and wandlessly, his clothes disappearing into a neat pile on the chest at the foot of the bed. His hard cock jutted out, swollen, the tip reddened and shiny with pre-come. Harry’s mouth watered.
As soon as the Patronuses released their message, they disappeared. Draco turned to Harry. “Oh man, do you think it’s a good thing? The two of them, alone, there?”
Ron was laughing while murdering his steak. It was atrocious. Draco had no other words to describe it. Every time Ron was around food it looked like a blood bath was happening on his plate.
“That right now I’ve become your sex slave?” Malfoy supplied, chin held high. “More or less. The bond makes it so that I physically need you to order me around, more frequently the first weeks or so. And when you do it…”
“What… what do you mean?” Harry felt exhausted, but his cock seemed to think differently. It was still fully hard, and was throbbing at the image in front of his eyes.
“I honestly thought I’d have an anxiety crisis much sooner and would have had to leave before this time. So, no idea. Not disappointed with how the evening developed, though.” He tentatively started stroking his thumb on Potter’s back as well, rewarded with a light blush covering his cheeks.
The water made his movements rougher and Draco was looking for reasons to get out of the ocean to have what was sure to be more comfortable sex, when a couple of drops hit Draco’s head and he huffed, annoyed.
He bit on his lips, looking as he was pondering what to say next. “I never stopped loving you. Never, you have to believe me.”
“Yes, Nev, I love the surprise! Thanks, guys!” He finally felt light-hearted and tranquil, after days closed in at St. Mungo’s. A reunion with his closest friends was exactly what he needed.
Harry regretted with a passion that he couldn't touch anyone because he would have loved to shove the git, and his damned gorgeous smile, away right now.
He turned his gaze on Granger again and tried to smile. “Sure, I am very intrigued. Can’t wait to discover more about your project.”
Malfoy clicked his tongue. “Right,” he said. With a deep sigh, Malfoy picked three pieces of roots up and tipped them in the potion. His eyes were glued to his wand when he waved it three times clockwise. “I don’t hate you.” Malfoy looked into Harry’s eyes again. “Never have.”
Malfoy settled himself behind Harry and pulled him into his lap, just enough to align Malfoy’s cock to Harry’s hole.
“With reason! I know, Potter, I know! That’s why I took it. But I can be honest without it too. I’m afraid you’ll have to trust my word then, though.”
Without replying, Potter picked a second cherry, and his tongue darted out a milli-second to lick it before eating it, “Why are you so interested in what I am into, Draco?”, making Draco’s heart jump in his throat.
Harry placed a pillow under Draco’s groin, lifting him up, watching amusedly as he muttered, “Mother? Father?” So, Harry had no idea what was going on in Draco’s dream right now, but whatever it was, he wanted nothing to do with it if his parents were there. But after a few minutes, Draco smiled, looking infinitely cute with his face resting on the pillow, his hair laying on it like a golden halo. He smiled and murmured, “Harry,” and again, “Harry.”
Still. His hands were always just at the right place, at the right time— around Harry’s waist when he thought he couldn’t take the brutal pace anymore, rubbing at the small of his back when he needed soothing, tugging at his hair when he craved dominance.
and that's Geremia, my co-worker. Everything that happens here is strictly private. Our Boss wanted me to make you swear an Unbreakable Vow but I managed to convince her not to. Behave yourself and don't make me regret it!"
"I love the smell of the forest at dawn. It reminds me of the treehouse I had when I was a little kid."
“No!” Draco almost begged, “Not again! Please, let’s just go inside to dance!” He took Potter by the hand and dragged him inside, both of them bursting into a fit of giggling.
Almost, because the hunger and the pain if Harry forgot to order Malfoy around were always there. Almost, because they started sleeping together every night.
Harry’s eyes widened before his entire face flushed redder than Weasley’s hair. He cleared his throat. “Draco! That...you! I was being serious! I discovered my passion for cooking and decided to open my own restaurant. Man, your mind, I swear. Anyway… I never expected to become so famous from it.
“Not always. I had no idea, for example, because my Muggle relatives didn’t want to acknowledge that magic exists.”
Harry felt embarrassment take over his body; he wasn’t the good one with stories, Draco always invented them and used the right words. He was clumsy and banal, but… an idea crossed his mind. He didn’t know how that would go, but it was worth a try.
Malfoy made an incredulous face when Boo-boo called their attention, exclaiming, "Look, he's going away with someone!"
Blinking hard, Harry tried to refocus and calm himself down. The air had started to crack again around them. “You
Draco crossed his arms at his chest, faking offence at his best friends mocking him. His blush intensified, extending to the tips of his ears, his neck and collarbone. “Will you shut up???”
“Right. What you must know is that I love you, Gin. You are my family, but… at some point, something clicked with Draco. We just, I don’t know. The time we spent together felt perfect, the feelings I had for him started growing with the years passing, and I knew… I thought… it wasn’t right to be that happy with him when I had all of you at home — you… Molly, Arthur… our kids… I tried to bury everything deep down, I convinced myself it was only a stupid childish infatuation...” Harry was chewing on his bottom lip — he wasn’t good with words.
Harry was baking cookies with Teddy when Draco finally arrived. He showed a big grin to the two of them, covered with flour and chocolate, and joined them without a second thought.
“You, me,” Harry said, nuzzling Draco’s jaw, the spot behind his ear, “takeaway pizza, my hands roaming under this beautiful jumper of yours…” Draco rolled his eyes at him, but Harry just smiled and finished, “and to open your gift. I know you’ve bought me something physical. You always do.”
He was annoying, really. And his voice absurdly irritating. Not at all one of the reasons why Harry’s cock was throbbing in his pants. He cleared his throat, hoping his voice wouldn’t show just how much he was already affected by Malfoy’s presence.
. People, friends, even animals, can’t touch you without you feeling excruciating pain. The potion takes away the constant pain, but can’t do anything to shield you from the touch of others. It would be an infernal life."
Potter took it with raised eyebrows and a light snort. “Sure… Merlin, Malfoy, you’ve got a mobile? That’s new.” With careful movements, he took Lady Luck in his arms and moved to go out.
“Well, I asked you if you wanted to go out for a walk, you said yes and… I thought… you needed company, maybe.”
The anger was dangerously coming to the surface again, Harry could feel it in the magic now tingling on his skin. “Tell me why, dear Merlin, why you stepped on my face on the Hogwarts Express, instead of reaching out for help.”
Draco sucked in a breath. Released it. “The… you know. Between the guests… there’s also… Potter. And Granger and Weasley.
With a deep sigh, Astoria sat up on the couch and looked intently at Draco. “So, it’s true. It really happened.”
“What the fuck…” he murmured as he displayed them on top of the desk. “These are… Draco! Are these clues you’ve collected on the possible identity of the chef of Sweet Prophecies?”
“But they target muggles, don’t they?” Harry looked up at Malfoy whose eyebrows were drawn together. His words passed quickly in Harry’s mind:
close, master, I—” he was an incoherent babbling mess. When Malfoy’s hole finally gave way, Harry plunged his tongue in, mercilessly pounding into Malfoy.
Harry stalled, blinking. “What… ?” His grip on Malfoy’s waist so tight it was impossible he wasn’t hurting him. He took a deep breath. He felt calmer, in control— the only thing that refused to disappear was Harry’s aching erection.
He put a hand on Harry’s, soothing him. “Do you have a vague idea of how hard it was to change my Patronus? I read billions of books on the topic to see how the fuck to do it and in the end, it wasn’t even worth it! My Patronus became… that fucking beast… Jarvey, you called it?”
Draco nodded, his eyelashes fluttering closed again. Delicate fingers brushed his cheek and he didn't dare open his eyes again — if this was a dream, he wanted it to last some more.
Trying to ignore the embarrassment for how much he was liking it, Draco searched Harry’s gaze, holding it. Harry was panting, and he looked as aroused as Draco. He leaned toward Draco’s face, licking his bottom lip, breathing on it with a weak voice, “I love seeing you like this… you really like big fat cocks in your arse, eh? Who would have known…”
Malfoy shook his head. “It doesn’t work like that, Potter. I’m only a quarter-Veela. It’s something I’ve always lived with and my father taught me how to control my…
“Mrs Darsley.” Draco reached her portrait, amused to see three cats in ballet skirts playing on the background of it. “Don’t call me Mr Malfoy, please. Just Draco.”
Draco schooled his tone to be the sweetest and clearest possible when he said, “Oh, honey, didn’t I tell you Ron and I have a secret romance?”
“I’m sorry, love, but I want to see you come undone with this.” Harry’s eyes darkened with lust while hovering over Draco’s body, stopping on his cock.
Draco leaned a bit closer to Harry, clutching his hand so hard he knew he was hurting him. His voice was barely audible when he whispered, “I want to kiss you so hard right now.”
“Thank you,” he said as he sniffed the liquid swirling in his glass. White wine was Harry’s weakness. He took a swig, hummed appreciatively and cast a quick tempus: in about half an hour his friends, family, colleagues from work, literally anyone who meant anything to Harry would arrive and he couldn’t be more excited.
Harry's eyes widened — was Malfoy sharing personal information about his private life, his childhood? He held his breath and then released it, falling back into known dynamics.
checking — as Tori would teasingly say — articles about Potter, about his marriage with Ginevra, his three kids and then his divorce. His promotion to Britain’s First Magical Representative of International Cooperation.
He offered his hand to her to seal the deal. She narrowed her eyes at it and slowly smiled. Shook it. “Deal.”
“Ah,” he said, swallowing an elegant amount of liquor himself, licking his lips slowly afterwards. “Wouldn’t you like to know.”
He said it as if it was nothing, a clinical condition. But Harry knew better. This situation was a gigantic fuck up.
“Malfoy, be reasonable. We had nothing to help Harry! This could be it. If we manage to go back in time to the night of the party—"
Every word they spoke lingered in the air between their faces, their lips impossibly close, almost brushing. Their breaths ghosting over each other’s chins.
Trying to distract himself, Harry took a sip of his wine too and shoved another raspberry muffin in his mouth, talking around it.
Potter smirked, putting away the abused strawberry to dig his fingers in the chocolate. Draco watched, helpless.
They went over the edge together, murmuring sweet and dirty words to each other the whole time — for a long time their moans, their broken ‘yes, fuck, yes’ and the indecent sounds of their bodies sliding together were the only sounds audible in the room.
“What?! Who’s here?” Potter’s voice sounded completely taken-aback, almost as if he actually had been alone in the cubicle…
Taking Draco’s silence the wrong way, Potter snapped, “Aren’t you going to say anything?” and without waiting for a reply, he shook his head and returned his wand to the inside pocket of his suit. “I thought we were past our childish bickering.”
One of Malfoy’s feet slowly slid down Harry’s chest, until it reached Harry’s hard cock and found its place there again, rubbing and pressing and Harry had to mentally conjure a brief image of Dudley eating his birthday cake to avoid coming on the spot.
Right. Malfoy had been sentenced to a year of exile in Muggle London after the war; Harry had never given it too much thought. With a sigh, he dropped his head on the table. “Malfoy, I’m sorry. It wasn’t fair of me to order you to reply, you shouldn’t… I’m sorry. I don’t realise it.”
But Malfoy just licked the pre-come away and came back to Harry’s balls, slowly licking them, and then lower again on Harry’s perineum.
He glanced one last time in the mirror: he didn’t really love wearing clothes that were quite so casual, but Harry always looked
A chilling breeze made the hairs at his nape stand up on end. Draco hated winter, he always got a cold and never felt warm enough when going out. He probably should head home.
“Oh, yes, Harry, yes, fuck, those pads… aah…” Draco started moving around the dildo to feel it against his walls, scraping his nerves. He brought a hand to his cock and meowled when his fingers finally wrapped around it.
As dessert was being served at the buffet, Blaise leaned in, lightly whispering in Draco’s ear. “So, Draco, how are you?”
“No, I… wait.” Potter gestured to move from the dessert tables, and they made their way to the end of the room, near the big cherry wood doors.
Harry sticks his tongue out to Draco, feels his face heat up. “Well excuse me if the memories of last night distracted me.”
While walking toward the buffet, all the worst scenarios replayed in Draco’s head — from Potter refusing to shake his hand
And Harry looked up at him, trembling like a leaf, cock leaking incessantly, mind scattering with thoughts, trying to grasp
“Are you still with me?” Harry was looking at him, his thumb stroking endless circles on Draco’s neck.
"Y-yes, I think so…" Harry's vision had blurred for a moment but was already clearing again, when a glass of water floated in front of him.
“So, um...” When Hermione cleared her throat, Draco raised his head to look at her. She continued. “Right. So, Ronald… he fancies Pansy, doesn’t he?”
Glancing one last time at the iron gates at the far end of the garden, Draco sighed and walked to the room where the guests were milling about, glasses of champagne in hand, brilliantly entertained by Blaise, Pansy and the waiters.
It was true. Now that he was relaxed, Draco could feel his legs wiggling uncontrollably under the table, his feet tapping out some sort of a weird rhythm, and his vision starting to blur more often than not.
Surely, it wasn’t like Draco had been too distracted by Potter to understand what happened. He hadn’t been thinking about the way Potter’s back felt against his chest, hot and slick as Draco fucked him into the sofa. Draco’s cock stretched in his uniform and he narrowed his eyes at the door as if daring it to contradict him.
"Wait, 'Mione," Harry said, reaching a hand to her shoulder and snatching it away as if he had touched fire.
When he walked into the kitchen, Ginny was cooking waffles and cutting fresh fruits. Harry stared at her figure, always graceful and elegant despite the years passing. He probably owed her a ‘straight’ brunch. He cleared his throat and she turned, her eyes bloodshot. Guilt again crept into Harry’s throat, but he swallowed it down, opting for a stretched smile instead.
Tori hid her head in Ginny’s neck. “Yeah, I can understand. I was jealous of Harry too.” She shifted to make space for Ginny. She sat and clutched her hands.
“No! See, I was right! I didn’t wanna know! Why did you do that to me, Draco?” He shook his head and Harry laughed despite having just lived one of the weirdest moments of his life.
“Ah, do tell me more, Harry. This sex, how do you have it? Is it very dirty? Rough? Angry?” Hermione looked seriously interested, and for a moment, Harry worried that she’d been caught up in his Allure, too.
Draco grabbed a fistful of Potter’s hair, pulled his head back, making him groan. “Shut up,” he all but hissed. In one smooth thrust, he was fully seated in Potter’s arse, its warmth engulfing him as his grip on Potter’s hair tightened. Draco fucked him hard with sharp snaps of his hips, mumbling, “so tight”, and “fuck, hot”, over and over, as Potter started moving his arse in time with him.
Harry turned to find him once again blushing in that weird ghostly way and casting curious looks right and left.
“Eloquent as always. Potter, does it seem to you as an honest spell, this one?” He asked with a raised eyebrow.
Draco wrinkled his brow, confusion fluttering through his brain. The first thing Draco thought was that Harry could cook Sweet Prophecies’ dishes because he was the actual chef, but that was ridiculous. And yet, the more he thought about it, the more…
Being able to see Potter again, smell his new ocean skin, see the new grey strands of hair on his old familiar messy head, his everlasting emerald eyes with a few wrinkles at the sides.
Draco snorted, the sound turning into a whine. He roved his hands up from where they were resting on Harry’s chest, buried them in Harry’s hair, and pressed their foreheads together, sighing through his nose in frustration. “Do you at least like what I’d planned? Please lie to me even if you don’t. I don’t think I can take a defeat against the Weasel right now.”
He didn't mean to sound genuine, but the mixed feelings towards Malfoy and his office and his damned uniform were starting to confuse Harry.
"C'mon, Draco, it could be fun. You're always so uptight. Loosen yourself a bit." Harry winked and something tickled his stomach, so different from what the bond does to him, more similar to… to tiny butterflies fluttering in it. Oh Circe, was he getting the butterflies for Malfoy?!
“Again? What’s with your fascination for my feet?” Malfoy said even as he proceeded to do as told. Harry felt his throat dry up as he watched Malfoy’s feet, the perfect knob of his ankles bathed in the sunlight.
They laughed together, until Malfoy's eyelids started closing again and he whispered, “So, roommates… sure, so brilliant, Harry Pottah… just, we... see... the bond, one bed. Cast a no-touching spell for the night and… we should disguise ourselves.”
They descended the stairs as quickly as possible, and when Harry and Malfoy arrived at the reception area it was to see Jacob sitting on a sofa, a hand still clenched on his stomach, white as a sheet.
Harry followed him just seconds later, pumping hard and fast with his hand on his cock, smearing their stomachs with come.
Draco opened his eyes, finding Harry lying next to him, eyes sparkling in the night. He was grinning, delicately rubbing circles on Draco’s arm.
Draco liked his life. It wasn’t what his father had envisioned for him, but Draco was perfectly fine with it.
Draco stepped back, taking deep breaths. Harry opened his eyes: Draco’s smile mismatched the tears streaming down his face.
It was painfully obvious to Harry that he was shaking with jealousy, because no one else should dare to make Malfoy look so damn kissable.
Harry blinked two, three, four times. Either Malfoy had succeeded to fuck him into silliness, or the overwhelming pleasure was intoxicating him, because in front of him Harry could distinctly see another Malfoy, dressed in shirt and trousers, a smirk on his face.
Through the waves of pleasure that were still running through him, Draco could only comply. He kissed Harry again and it felt like coming back home, like fireworks. He could actually hear them, roaring up in the sky, flashes of lights like bolts of lightning breaking the dark of the night…
"Mh, it's also absolutely perfect. I do take my hot tea like that." Malfoy ignored him, wiggling his eyebrows, a shit-eating grin breaking free on his face.
Draco pulled off the Cloak, smiling at Harry. “My mother and I were the only ones coming to this part of the garden. It was our thing. She wouldn’t let any house-elf near her precious trees, so I grew up learning how to prune, trim and take care of plants with her. I used to love to get my hands dirty doing work like that, the scent of soil and flowers used to make me serene.”
Harry was listening carefully, nodding along with Geremia’s words, waiting for him to continue, when Malfoy gasped next to him, exclaiming, “Us! We are your guinea pigs!”
“Call the Aurors, Hermione.” Draco talked for Harry, probably fearing he’d hurt Geremia without a second thought. Hermione looked once more toward them and then sent an emergency Patronus to the Aurors, Harry pointed his wand at Geremia.
They agreed to meet up again the next day, and as soon as they were set up, Malfoy sprinted towards the exit, Hermione in tow, and Harry rushing to keep up.
“What!? We have to tell them the truth, Gin!” He got up from the bed, following her. “Wait, come back!”
The first object was sold and, not counting Potter’s accident, everything was proceeding as planned. The second and third objects went quickly enough — a painting called ‘Salvator Mundi’ that the Muggles thought was long lost, but had actually been in the possession of the original artist, one of the most famous wizard painters, Oliver Cartwright. He’d died before the War, leaving the painting to the Malfoy family, after years of close friendship.
It’s over too soon, but you take what you can and taste every single drop he spills down your throat as he growls like an animal. “Take it, you stupid, stupid idiot, just fucking take it.”
Harry’s eyes widened and for a second, his cock started to wilt. Surely, he didn’t mean to double penetrate him, right?
“What—what face?” Draco’s eyes snap to his pumpkin juice. He can already feel his face heat up and he knows his skin doesn’t exactly go unnoticed when he blushes.
“Yeah, maybe so.” Malfoy’s eyebrows knitted together and he looked pensieve for a moment. “I mean not that— I wouldn’t have used it yesterday, I was just…
Potter’s arms encircled Draco’s shoulders from behind, his voice now low and purring into Draco’s ears.
Ten minutes later, Hermione, Ron and Harry were sitting in a bar close to the hotel, ordering breakfast together.
Harry let his eyes drift towards Malfoy, who was watching Teddy on his new toy, clapping his hands and laughing. Without taking his eyes off Teddy, Malfoy said, “He’s lucky to have you as a godfather, you know.”
“The flowers are perfect.” His voice was still shaking and Draco struggled to understand him amongst his sobbing. “Everything with you is perfect.
As soon as they entered the ballroom, Draco took his place in front of the people already there with his best fake-smile in place, the one his father taught him since he was a little child. Potter was already amongst the guests, next to Weasley and Granger, exchanging hushed conversation with them. A lily was still stuck in his bun and the image of a coy Potter full of flowers in his hair came back to Draco, eliciting a real smile from him.
. Bantering, bickering and being playful during such an intimate moment was something Draco had missed his entire adult life, something he knew he could have only with Harry.
Potter temporarily ignored Draco’s cock, to Draco’s utter regret. Potter reached around his back, his fingers disappearing in the space between the crease of his arse cheeks.
In a quick move, Potter’s chocolate-covered fingers were on Draco’s cheeks, tracing chocolate lines on his cheekbones, jaw, nose, and lips. Draco held his breath. His mind screaming
"I know… I know it. We can't…" Harry sniffed, remembering another time, twenty years ago, before everything changed, before everything happened.
He needed to hold on to that thought to be able to keep living like this and, thankfully, a little smile appeared on Draco's face, as usual, he understood Harry's feelings.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake, Draco, I have no time for your memories, right now. I can feel your hard cock twisting against mine… I know you’ve been like this for most of the luncheon.” Harry licked along his ear shell, making Draco shiver.
“No, you git, I’m merely meditating right now.” Draco cracked one eye open and huffed. “Where’s Boo-boo?”
They smiled at each other, and Harry felt the room getting warmer all of a sudden. He would have never imagined talking like this with Draco Malfoy, his school rival, former Death Eater, and possibly the most gorgeous man he'd ever met.
The crowd fell silent as Draco entered, anticipation in their eyes. He smiled, looking around while he made his way toward the podium at the end of the room and people started to take their seats in front of it. Draco recognised some familiar faces: Longbottom, Lovegood, the Patils, Nott, the Greengrass sisters, even some professors, Trelawney, Sprout, McGonagall… really, why the fuck wasn’t Potter here?
. It was only eight in the morning and he was already tired from all the thoughts and images of Potter that kept sweeping through his mind.
He tucked the blankets around them and enjoyed the view of Draco’s face morphing into small frowns and smiles, waiting for the potion to wear off.
Draco blinked, feeling the tip of his ears go so hot he was sure he could have boiled eggs on them. Panic seized him, and he wasn’t very good at reacting to it.
Okay, so Harry was a bit confused about Malfoy and his breathtaking appearance, so opposite to his annoying personality, but he had no intention of letting him get away with it.
“Yeah, okay. It only happens when there’s a full moon, but I get this kind of werewolf feature and when I have sex, I… form a knot with my partner.”
"It works in a completely different way. When you open it, with the right spell, you decide the exact era you need to go to, and then the magical gears in it transport your body to the destination. When you set up the travel, you also decide how long you need to stay away, depending on what's your purpose."
sold it to me. He told me lavender would compliment my tanned skin. I agree.” Potter made a half pirouette, making the skirt turn and lift, showing his muscled thighs just enough to make Draco salivate.
He then approached Harry, whispering to his ear, "We’re gonna uncover two truths today, are you with me?"
He smirked and sucked the tip of Draco’s cock back into his mouth, groaning around it as he reached his hands around Draco’s legs to cup Draco’s arse.
In a second, Boo-boo was once again next to them, his lips finally stretched in a big grin. "So you're travelling through time! They finally fixed it!"
After a while, Draco’s head slid on Harry’s shoulder and he couldn’t be silent anymore. He needed to ask, to know… “Do you ever – Are you…”
Malfoy hummed, mumbled a, “night, Harry,” and then opened his eyes wide, jumping on the bed. “Harry, I want pink hair!”
“Something went wrong yesterday, though.” Ron picked it up from Malfoy, as Harry kept staring into the void, thinking
How could someone possibly like licking salt like that? But Potter looked entirely unfazed. Once he finished, he picked up the slice of lime and... Draco’s insides jolted, his face suddenly on fire. He could feel droplets of perspiration at his nape. Had someone just turned up the thermostat?
“Well, anyway, I… I have things about Voldemort that I can’t reveal. What if— if someone takes advantage of the situation. I can’t, no.”
"Wow, Draco," Harry said, not tearing his eyes off the scene, "my hair really was horrible back then!"
?" The hot man in a tight blue swimwear asked Draco, flashing him a bright smile. "I could show you the
Draco’s entire body was thrumming with the excitement of having Harry for himself, finally, of being free to tell him these kinds of things, of being free to think he’s handsome when he smiles, speaks or even only breathes. But they still had to be careful in public. “Do you want to grab something at the pub? I want to know everything.”
Malfoy looked around and shrugged. "He said he was gonna do a tour of the house. Looked pretty excited… we'll find him."
That day, though, something went pear-shaped they said. The entire Ministry was blocked as they tried to fix it. Perhaps it was a weather charm problem? The lifts? Or maybe it was a leak from the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes— they had all sorts of weird artefacts and people up there.
A few hours later, you’re completely wasted, sitting on a filthy chair —you can still see the stains of someone else’s dry cum on the armrest— thinking about how fucking much life sucks.
“I want you—” he rasped, lifting Harry’s shirt, brushing his fingers to his ribs, feeling them expand with Harry’s ragged breathing, his chest, nipples. “I want you right now, Harry.”
Not alone? Did it mean that…. Did Potter have anything to do with it? What kind of information, what kind of project?
Potter chuckled, shaking his head. “Then do it. I’m not gonna stop you.” He bit again his bottom lip. For a moment, Draco thought Potter was gonna say something, but then he sipped his tea and the frown that had formed between his eyebrows cleared.
“You’ve chosen him as your mate for life. Harry, have you read even one of the books about Veelas I’ve given you?”
“He’s sorry!” Draco shrieked again, and if ghosts could cry, Boo-boo would have tears of laughter streaming down his face.
Draco turned to Harry and smirked, like he’d read his mind, the git. “See, that’s how you should talk to me.”
trusted non-conventional solutions. He was about to start fully panicking when the only other door in the room opened and Malfoy's pale face appeared, his scowl in place.
Malfoy snorted and Harry glared at him. “I’m serious. I don’t want to risk anything. First of all, we need to understand what is an order and what is not and how much you can or can’t resist it.”
Draco nodded, his eyes fluttering closed and his smile hollowing his cheeks in the dimples Harry loved so much. Damn, but he wanted to brush his fingers over them, kiss them, worship them with his lips.
“But, my Allure, er, isn’t…” Harry’s heart tripped violently against his ribcage. It all felt so unreal.
“This is getting ridiculous, Potter. I didn’t think you’d sink this low. Are you so ashamed of Draco? Is that really it?”
After an hour, every nerve of Draco’s body was on fire, and he was ready to jump at the slightest contact or question. Pansy shot him a perplexed glance, which Draco tried to brush away with a shake of his head.
Harry trailed off as Malfoy shifted on the couch and lounged comfortably on it, stretching his legs towards Harry until his feet were resting on Harry’s lap. He grazed one delicately on the swell on the front of Harry’s trousers, as his lips touched the rim of his glass.
Still. Malfoy’s kisses were always just right, with the perfect amount of tongue, the perfect angle.
A breeze passed again, cooling Draco’s nerves, shifting the hair at the nape of his neck. He closed his eyes, shivering slightly. Inhaled once, twice. “Okay, okay. I know I can do this.”
Draco tried a smile, that probably looked more like the face of someone with a stomach ache. “Depends on what you are referring to.”
Draco broke away a moment, took off Harry’s glasses, ‘they are distracting, fuck, Harry come back here’, again connecting with those delicious lips and sunk his hands into Harry’s hair, untying it.
“Err, yey? So, um, did you see Harry around? I thought he was with you.” He tried to ignore the way his voice cracked on the word ‘Harry’ and how his three interlocutors didn’t miss it, all turning a smug face to him.
From the audience, someone started clapping and in a jiffy, everyone joined in. The air felt hot all of a sudden, perspiration gathered at the small of Draco’s back.
Pansy snickered, cocking her head to the side. “Ah, to be young and have secrets… and being in love!”
What he hadn’t expected to see when he stepped through the door of his flat was Harry Potter perched on his sofa with a blanket draped over him and a book on his lap. Potter lifted his head and beamed— actually beamed at Draco. Fuck, it did things to Draco. Things he didn’t want to think about.
. Not only because of how extremely unhygienic it all looked but because of the look on Potter’s face.
Harry felt his fingers itching to reach out and stroke his hair, his cheeks, brushing them on his skin, discovering if it felt as silky as it looked.
“Draco, darling, we know you are gay!” Mrs Darsley’s voice came from her portrait and Draco’s head whipped to it, a horrified look on his face.
Draco stared hard into Potter's face, searching for his eyes that were trained on Lady Luck. "Are you kidding me, Potter? Lady Luck
He had spent all of his life at the mercy of others' decisions, and now that he was finally starting to taste freedom he found himself owned by someone else. Again.
Still, Draco couldn’t help but wonder. Did Potter spend his time with someone else this week? Was he offended? Angry? Did he not want to see Draco anymore?
Hermione’s voice was exasperated, but fond, and Harry snorted a bit, feeling his head throbbing again at his own voice, his body shaking with a new wave of nausea.
"Remind me, why do we keep him?" Draco laughed, the melodious tone of his voice making Harry's stomach flutter.
Harry saw Malfoy taking in a breath and then his fingers pushed in deeply, his lips parting on a loud moan. Harry closed his eyes, overwhelmed by the feeling of having Malfoy again.
And Harry saw the exact moment Malfoy, his Sir, let a layer of his hard mask fall down and gave Harry one of his favourite orders.
Three months in, and every time Harry looked at Draco he felt his heartbeat quicken. While at work — selling flowers to all kind of souls — he thought about Draco, was he fine? what was he doing now? Every time Draco spoke, Harry’s gaze was fixed on his lips, every moment they spent together Harry tried hard to make him laugh to see his dimples, to hear his joy. Sometimes he’d try to speak some Parseltongue too, which made Malfoy more flushed than amused, much to Harry’s pleasure.
Harry sat on the couch, blaming Malfoy only for the lack of things to do during the wait. Didn't he have any newspapers? Photos to sneak at? And where was Hermione?
“That’s not true,” he whispered. His hands fell lower, massaging Draco’s chest and Draco allowed himself to lean back against Potter’s body, revelling in his warmth, his musky scent.
,” Harry gasped as he convulsed violently with the force of his orgasm. As he shot hot and sticky in his pants, he felt Malfoy stilling against him, his ragged breathing resounding into Harry’s ears.
The knot is fully formed now. Harry feels his balls tightening as he starts coming, filling Malfoy’s hole with shot after shot. They both know it’s just the beginning.
“Charity Auction. I’m giving away the Manor along with other minor magical objects for beneficence.”
“No one could ever make you fall apart like this, right love? Only me. You’re so hot, Harry, so hot. What else did we do, then?” His voice was starting to break, his movements incoherent and messy against Harry’s arse. He murmured the lube spell again and Harry heard him grasping his cock, the sound of his wet hand sliding up and down its length mixing with Malfoy’s gasps, making Harry crazy with want.
Harry motioned towards the box, unsure if he could touch it. When he saw Hermione and Geremia nodding, he picked it up, examining it, turning it in his hands, trying to open it and failing.
Harry snickered, awkwardly climbing off the bed and stretching, finally feeling good about standing, eating and talking with people.
Munching on the most perfect, delicious, heavenly pancakes he had ever eaten, Draco’s mind reeled. What were they doing? Why did Potter cook breakfast for him? Why weren’t they fucking?
As soon as he stepped foot into his flat, a voice dangerously similar to Potter’s rang in his head, ‘Honestly, Malfoy, why do you always forget to cast Weather Charms?’ It was something Potter liked to tease him about. Potter was right — Draco was a pureblood, someone who grew up with magic as the most natural thing in the world; it should have been second nature.
“Just how many portraits do you have, Malfoy?” Potter was wiping the few tears stuck in his lashes, a hand on his belly. “This night is weird, perhaps the weirdest of my life, and believe me, I’ve had some very peculiar days.”
Potter stopped briefly, raising his head and giving a firm nod. Draco took the opportunity to inhale deeply, his hands cupping Potter’s arse cheeks. Dear lord, they were so round and squishy and perfect.
Harvey raised a thick eyebrow, an action that looked extremely hard for him. “Well, today’s Friday, kid. You know what that means? Potions day. I need you to go retrieve some potions for the Ministry. Be back here in an hour. That’s all, shoo.”
He nodded frantically, tilting his head to give Malfoy better access to his neck and a second after he felt Malfoy’s tongue trailing a long stripe along his throat, his Adam’s apple, biting gently at his flesh, the contact once again making Harry’s world spin around him.
Harry ran to the living room, not even minding where the hell he left the glass of wine, his ivory linen shirt already starting to dampen with sweat.
“We’ll be quick. You were sexy before, all worried, with your Adam’s apple bobbing like that… you know I love your throat.” Draco licked a long stripe up Harry’s throat, focussing on his Adam’s apple, moaning all the way through, eliciting delicious gasps from Harry.
"Good, like that. I'm sorry we didn't tell you sooner, but there really isn't a good way to say this. You've been in and out for three days, mainly because we needed time to find a potion for you."
Harry woke to the rays of sunshine warming his face and a distinct feeling of discomfort in the pit of his stomach. His mouth tasted like a troll had pissed in it and he winced at his own breath.
Draco had leaned back, looking into Harry’s eyes, the tip of his ears reddened. “That potion… it makes me sleep but it also makes me
Potter arrived to pick him up at 10 pm. They met in front of Draco's lab because it was closer to the cafe they chose.
Their friends looked like frozen statues, their lips open in astonishment or covered by their hands, their eyes wide, trained on them or looking away in embarrassment.
They came together, in a synced chant of “god, Malfoy,” and “oh! P-Potter, fuck!” Draco almost forgot but in a swift motion, he dropped his hand to Potter’s cock, clamping down hard around its head, collecting the spunk in his fist as Potter fucked into it.
Hermione giggled, and lifted the sleeping kitten’s tail. Harry blushed and looked away- that was rather more of a cat’s genitalia than he’d ever seen before, and more than he’d really needed.
“Er, Malfoy, I have no idea what you’re talking about. I’m not here for any inspection, and I didn’t, uhm, kidnap the kitten, I promise. She just showed up at my house this evening, and I didn’t know what to do with her, and the lady at Magical Menagerie gave me your card, and er, that’s pretty much the extent of it, right there,” Harry said, speaking softly so as not to jostle the two kneazles still cuddling in his arms.
And finally- Draco! Still not earning that explicit rating, but I promise, we'll get there :) Also my chapters seem to be growing in length? I can't promise that this trend will continue, but I do plan to keep writing every day, and we'll see where that gets me!
“Oh, for the hairless ones, there’s only one breeder who really knows what he’s doing, and if the little one is magically powerful enough to be apparating into your home already, then I’d say it’s certainly one of his. Let me see, I’ve got his card somewhere, let me just pop back and get it for you, won’t be but a moment!” Raz swept out of the room, which felt deeply empty in her absence, only to sweep back in a moment later, holding a small business card that seemed to glow softly in the dim light of the shop. She handed it to Harry and then stepped back, beaming.
“Potter, your ceaseless interruptions begin to irk me, and they reflect badly on the aurors as a whole, on Gryffindor house, and on your family, and I’m getting there. There I was, breeding my first litter, and of course, I dare say you wouldn’t know this about breeding kneazles, but unusual patterns are quite the done thing, and since we can use magic, we don’t need to do awful things like inbreeding, and it’s all quite safe, doesn’t harm the mother or the kittens, so we can achieve results much more quickly than a cat breeder could, for example, since our magic is interacting with the core of magic within the animal, and we know all about which charms are safe to apply when.
