"Just saw you checkin' out a bloke's ass last week," Ron agreed. "To be fair, he was well fit, even if he wasn't really type."
"Where Daddy's happy go?"
Not that he was thinking about
A violent silence settled over the room once Malfoy and his parents were on the other side of the closed door. Harry ducked in closer to his plate, a growing feeling of unease crawling up his spine. He was in a room with literal strangers who, purportedly, had a reputation for being untrustworthy. After his experience earlier that afternoon, he found those allegations to be entirely believable. Which didn't make him eager to open his mouth and perform the job he'd been hired for.
Leaving him alone with his whirling thoughts for a moment — "Draco, come see the fire!"— which certainly wasn't long enough to begin to process them all. Draco looked up from tracing the vein of a tulip, smiling in Teddy's direction despite the weight of his emotions.
The man smiled patiently like he heard this all the time. "Café by day, club by night. We don't start serving alcohol until eight if that's what you came for."
The longer this conversation progressed, the harder Theo was finding it to pay attention to the words coming out of Potter's mouth. He had certainly become a distracting man. When had that happened? Probably around the time he grew that close-cut beard. Or when he finally bought some well-fitting casual clothes. Or maybe he had always been this attractive. Maybe he had just never noticed when they were surrounded by clouds of their own expectations.
Harry was glad to be facing away from Draco, and everyone else for that matter, in that instant. His face had never felt hotter in his life and would give anything to be literally anywhere else. For a long moment, he remained where he was. The wall felt grounding and solid beneath his hand, stabilizing him while his head spun with all of his options.
." Malfoy grinned like a cat who'd caught a mouse. "I'm flattered you care so much about my personal life to go snooping on my investments. I'm just a bit hurt that you never came by for a visit…."
"Wait!" Ron interrupted followed by more sounds of movement on his end. "Wait, give me the message. I'll get it to her, God's honest. The instant she's back, I'll tell her."
"I love you, Sug'. And even though you've never said it, I'm ninety-nine point nine percent certain you love me, too. It may not be as intense as your feelings for him…for
"Then what could it be?" Harry's voice had dropped again, sounding just slightly more rational. But still looking frazzled and anxious.
It took everything Harry had not to reply with a snarky comment. And he was hankering for a cigarette like it was no one's business. His nerves were itching and he felt restless in his own skin. This drug out uncertainty felt like it was killing him. Which was probably why he snapped at the healer when he saw her coming out of Teddy's room.
a certain way? Should I be out there mad shagging right now? I mean, I should have fucked a man by this point in my life, shouldn't I've? Or do I really need to wait for that Prince Charming to come around? What's the right way to do it all? How'd
Teddy steadily shook his head, refusing to take his eyes off his cousin. "…was jus' thirsty," was all he managed to squeak out before being taken over by dry coughs.
can at least marry now in Britain."
"Maybe I'm gay and require your help?" Harry spat before he could curtail it, flushing white-hot with humiliation.
Feeling worse than when he started (if that were possible), Harry finished his task and sat back on his haunches. He was surrounded by the discarded catastrophe of his thought process and his head felt slick with sweat. With a heavy sigh, he slid off his gloves and removed the hat, fluffing the moisture from his hair with his fingers.
to you, Draco. And I've never asked for
"At any rate," Harry continued, "Luna wants this thing all-inclusive. Because how dare she deter fate's whims for something so ridiculous as the construct of gender? Her words," he added fondly.
So slowly it was almost painful, Harry raised his eyes to meet Charlie's sea of calming blue. He couldn't help the smile pulling at his lips in response. He couldn't help but to feel safe and content. All of the warring fears and desires inside his head washing away like a receding tide.
"Five…ten, maybe? She only just left before you rang."
just shouted it from your little celebrity hilltop and everyone loves you all the same. Must be something to be said for privilege, hm?"
"You're early."
The tension, a dangerous line keeping them at a distance, snapped like a rubber band.
There was the hint of a tell in Draco's eyes. He was holding Harry's gaze, but not quite meeting it. There was an unmistakable shadow over his vision. Like he was trying too hard to keep in a secret. It was a look Harry knew well. It was the face he had memorized right before the man had left him for good. And the same one he wore every single time he had left since. "You just don't want to see it," Harry said softly, carrying the notes of a revelation. "This is why you brought me in. Your past won't allow you to see this. It's too close to
He certainly looked ready. Harry had adopted the MACUSA dress code, opting for a simple suit instead of the garishness of dress robes. He looked down at himself, straightening the burgundy tie that made his green eyes pop with temptation. "I think I am."
wants, right?"
In response, he felt a gentle hand fall over his own. He visibly startled, eyes going wide as he looked up into Malfoy's. Into those deep, endless pools of glittering grey. In them, he finally found a moment of stability, realizing he hadn't been breathing as often as needed to clear the fog from his thoughts. He took a long breath in and nodded as he exhaled through his nose. "That was a joke," he quickly added, in case Malfoy decided to take offense to the implication that what he had offered to pay him wasn't enough. Even though it was starting to feel like nothing would be….
. So that's why I didn't go. Not because I don't listen to you, Harry, but because I was trying to be…nice. Or considerate.
Shea's answer was only a stiff nod as he emptied the rest of the wine bottle. He didn't speak or even come close to looking at Harry. His feelings were clear on the man's presence without having to say anything at all.
Following that dish was an equally perplexing appetizer. Harry had never particularly understood the idea of eating mushrooms. Therefore, he simply could not get on board with one large cap filled with blistered tomatoes; balls of, he assumed, cheese; and topped with an off-smelling coal-black sauce of sorts. Harry didn't touch it and even rather forcefully pushed it away so he didn't have to smell it as strongly.
The boy had always been docile. Harry was always silently grateful for that. He didn't yell back. He didn't hardly ever pitch a fit. He was a good kid. Right in that moment, he was no different. He settled back into the bench and meekly did as he was told.
Charlie's response was just as typical as it ever was. "Right now…I just want to lie here with you." A blatant try at steering them in the opposite direction.
business," Harry said after a contented stretch of silence, his voice husky and dry.
"Yeah, yeah," James said quickly. He pulled back with a smile, coursing his fingers through Harry's similar mess of hair. "Your mum's just having a kip and I…. Well, I must have dozed off in the armchair, myself. You just startled me a bit is all."
With a heavy sigh, Harry nodded. "I understand that, Mr. Manelo. I only have a few extra questions. I've already read those other interviews, so we can just consider this a follow-up."
Which didn't appear to be very deep at all. "Fine. You're forgiven," she huffed with a soft smile, exhaling heavily in what sounded like relief. "Just don't do it again, okay? You have too many friends to turn to with your troubles, so you've no excuse really." Her gaze flitted momentarily towards the bedroom before she leaned in and whispered, "Just don't shut us out for that prat, okay? I don't care how fit he looks in just his pants…," Hermione trailed off with an odd look, then shook her head and continued, "Are you sure there's nothing more intimate going on between you two?"
Luna rose from her chair, coming around behind Harry to wrap her arms securely around his neck. He sat there stiffly, trying not to shirk away from her crushing hold or the sloppy kiss she pressed into his cheek. "I don't know that any of us realized how deep your feelings ran, Harry, that's all. So, we'll work on it some more. We'll make it more you. By the time we're all finished, we'll have Draco bawling in your lap over Christmas pudding. Okay?"
Malfoy nodded once, twice, and a resolute third time. He was the epitome of a man psyching himself up for something unsavoury. Now, more than any minute of the previous hour, Harry was regretting choosing to stay. He turned his attention back to the idling car down below, refusing to look at anything else.
"I think we're entirely too clothed," Potter whispered into Draco's ear and like he was a pied piper, Draco responded with urgency to remedy this problem. He scrambled over Potter to reach the edge of the mattress, feet hitting the floor just long enough to shimmy out of his loafers, his trousers, his open shirt. And yes, finally, his pants. Potter was beside him doing the same thing, peeling every garment off with urgency and abandon. Gone was the time to worship every inch of one another's skin. They were too far in and too far gone to slow down.
His fingers had just begun to wrap around the base of Draco's cock, freeing him from the constraint of his pants, when he felt Draco's hand mimicking the motion on Harry's body. It was on a plane of euphoria so far beyond anything Harry had ever imagined that he had to stop and blink away stars before he could even think about continuing. "You'll come for me, won't you?" Draco whispered and Harry felt like he could very easily do as he asked right then without so much as a proper touch. He nodded feebly, slamming his forehead into Draco's shoulder, shivering at his sight below.
"No!" Harry shouted, fists clenched and ready to throw again.
Like it didn't even bother him any longer.
The shape of his lips, set in shock.
Across the table, Draco made a soft noise which sounded somewhere between a gasp and a lament. Though he nearly lost his resolve altogether, Harry took a deep breath and soldiered through — Draco deserved this explanation more than possibly anyone else. "We were having a fight. I can't even remember what it was about, honestly. It was one of those things where…all the little things build up into one big explosion. And, er, the explosion was a little more literal than I had intended." Harry's face grew hot as embarrassment wholly consumed him. "He's quick on his feet, Neville, so there didn't end up being any damage to the structure of the greenhouse. But he did lose most of the plant life which the investigative team deemed 'Excessive Property Damage'."
He slowly lifted off of Charlie, almost to the point of losing him completely, before sinking just as agonizingly slow back down onto his length. "Oh, gods…."
Harry.
And that was when Theo made up his mind. Draco had threatened to go to the Ministry. And that seemed like a fine plan to steal. Especially since not a single soul hesitated to believe that Draco would undeniably be the sort. Besides, in their absence Theo came to realize he could easily live without his father's belongings. He felt freer with them gone.
It felt like a cut. But instead of blood rushing out, the chaos of the world was rushing right back in. Slowly at first. A trickle. Like little bees buzzing in his ears. Closing his eyes, Harry forced himself to push Draco back. Just enough to dislodge their lips. "I didn't mean to tell him. It just slipped out. I was wrong, Dray. Graham told me that he was a wizard. He was the boy's biological father. I just…lost it after that. I was wrong…and that leaves us back at square one."
"Well…I'm afraid I don't know much about potions, Draco…."
boy?" Delphini snarked, looking up at Harry as if he were something gross upon her perfectly shined shoe.
Behind him, James made more sputtered protests, but Harry ignored them. He wasn't going to argue and he certainly wasn't going to take the money back. He had his own little nest egg squirreled away. Just enough to last him until he found a new job after this…
Without time for warning, Harry turned and just managed to get sick over the railing instead of at their feet. "I'm so sorry," he whined, those tears finally breaking through.
— before finally turning and looking up.
"I-I think I'm good," Draco finally muttered, the shake in his spine pooling into his voice. He was buzzing and didn't think he could handle another second without Potter truly and fully inside of him. "I think I'm ready."
The plea was so soft, Draco wasn't sure it was meant for him. He watched Harry closely, waiting for a change in his composure. Waiting for him to crumble.
Disturbingly, he didn't say anything for the rest of the night. Not even when Harry attempted to bribe him with an extra helping of dessert. Not even when Ron tried to cheer him up by charming the dishes to dance to the sink – something he was usually rather fond of. He only gave a hollow smile before going back to staring at his knotted hands in his lap.
"Did something happen since we met last week?" Cheryl asked gently, seemingly taking literal notes of how he jiggled his leg to keep awake.
means meant to deflower this man. That wasn't the correct word choice for what he wanted. It was too poetic and romantic to represent the violence rushing through Harry's veins.
"Teddy's always been more yours than he was Charlie's. Especially now. And he needs you.
"Draco…make Mummy a Cosmo, would you?" Narcissa raised a brow towards Harry, gesturing to the sofa across from her. Like she wanted him to sit down as close to her as possible…which just didn't track. "Draco's quite the skilled bartender."
Draco's words were soft and sleepy, moving in and out of full consciousness. But they were powerful enough to get Harry's heart beating unnervingly. Draco squirmed beside him, just as unsettled by his own question. He wasn't just asking aloud – it was a thought directed inward, as well.
Ron shrugged, turning back to watching a group of pre-teens surveying a display of trick sweets.
"Bambi…get the children and stay upstairs," Bill said solemnly, only raising his eyes to look at his wife for the briefest of seconds. "No matter what you hear, just stay there. After I'm gone…send a letter to Percy. Tell him to meet me at the Ministry. I think I'll need his representation."
"Draco…please share with me your last dream in as much or as little detail as you would like. It's uncomfortable, I know, but I do believe tricks like writing them down and sharing them aloud can help to alleviate the obsession even just a small amount."
Even if when it all ended, he was sure to be shattered just like the technicolor dragon mug, only to be repaired over and over again.
He focused his eyes on the ceiling, tracing the crown moulding while he focused his breathing. Blindly and eagerly anticipating that first touch. He heard the click of the lubricant cap, the exhaustive blast of the bottle hitting a pocket of air, and Potter's nervous titter at the intrusive sound. He felt the cold gel before the pressure, his muscles unintentionally causing him to recoil. Potter waited a moment before trying again, spreading the lube over Draco's rim and warming it beneath his touch. Draco berated himself to relax, pulling his knees up to allow Potter easier access.
"Actually, I'm sober now."
Compared to what they had just discussed, this other matter now seemed completely trivial. It was almost enough to make Harry laugh. If it weren't completely inappropriate, he may have even dared a small smile. "I've been asked to take a case."
Draco couldn't think of a more pathetic way to be spending Valentine's Day than suffering through a blind date. Okay, perhaps there were worse ways — spending it alone, fist-deep in a box of discount chocolates, for one — but for Draco, this was an all-time low. Especially after coming so close to having something real and permanent the year before.
It was impossible not to blush. Harry Potter had noticed his cheekbones. He noticed him enough to describe his features as "delicate". And he just had no idea what to do with that. "Not all of us can be built like a work Thestral," he squeaked, cursing the way it made him sound so affected.
Harry nodded, giving in to his need for comfort. He stepped into Draco's space, wrapping his arms around the man's neck. Tears streaming down his face and into the folds of Draco's collar. Gentle, comforting fingers caressed his back while soft coos filled his ears. Outside of the current situation, it would have all felt so perfect and like an ideal future. But in that present moment, it just felt like the culmination of a thousand bad decisions. "I need you to do your job, okay?" Harry sobbed, squeezing Draco tighter before pushing away from the safety of his embrace. "I need you to go be the good guy. And when you're done…I need you to come back to me. No more running. You come back to me and you come back to our boy."
"Can you describe for me the last one you had? Perhaps you wrote it down this time, as I suggested?"
In the end, he had decided it was something like fate, finding their café in such close proximity. And who was he to ignore the call of the future when it was placed so temptingly at his fingertips?
In his wide silver eyes lay one question above all the others — Why?
A dazzling flicker of what Harry hoped was relief lit up Draco's face as he rolled his eyes. "Good, then I'll count on you Saturday morning for set-up." When Harry guffawed, he merely shrugged. "You said you wanted to help. We need aide in more areas than just monetary around here and I intend to take full advantage of your offer."
Every word out of his husband's mouth unburied Harry's hidden feelings. They were so close to being completely out in the open. To try and keep some sort of handle on himself, he haphazardly settled a few fingers over Charlie's lips. "Shh," he hissed just as a well-timed, wayward thrust hit that sweet spot and wrung a strangled shout straight from his lungs. If he were more coherent, he would have questioned whether Charlie had remembered to cast a
He would start with Potter's hips. They had a soft curve, just enough to give cushion to the palms pressing against his hipbones. He pulled in a sharp breath the first time Draco's thumbs caressed the skin just below his pants. Draco savoured the way his eyes glazed over in just that one second. For that brief moment, he had looked like a man who had never been touched before. He looked like every sensation Draco was providing for him was new and exciting. He looked soft and pliable and Draco found he'd never wanted Potter more. Which, truly, should have been impossible given the number of times his subconscious had forced him to think about it.
"Daddy!" the toddler exclaimed, following him down to the ground. Like it was some sort of game. He giggled, snuggling into Draco's side.
"I'll bet you do," Draco choked out through a clog of emotion, determined not to go from laughing lunatic to crying lunatic in two seconds flat. "Well, uh…." He stood up on the step, forcing him to look down at Potter even more than usual. "Again, it's been an interesting night, and thank you for walking me home…." He was all set to force himself to say goodbye, but something stopped him. Something no longer deeply buried. Something desperate. "You know, if you wanted to catch up a bit more, you could come up for a nightcap?" He frowned. "Or just some tea, since you're doing the whole…not drinking thing. I'm flexible to…to whatever."
Even when alone with Draco in one of their homes or in a private momentary corner carved into the world, Harry found it difficult to express exactly what it was Draco made him feel. Draco would speak such poetic words, likening the shade of Harry's eyes to an emerald green mire from his childhood. And Harry…well, it wasn't like he didn't compliment Draco at all. He just couldn't find the creativity to put his thoughts into anything deeper than what one might say to their gran at Christmas.
Making breakfast was probably the last thing Astoria should be doing in her current state. Knives, fire, breakable dishware…. It all spelt disaster. "Tor, I think we've discussed why cocaine is a no-go for you now." She waved Draco off, digging through the fridge. "Your heart is already delicate. Something like that could kill you."
Potter nodded slowly. "Draco, uh…. Draco likes to be taken. He likes…to be filled and fucked. He likes it sweet and slow at first. He likes it to last until he can hardly stand it. And then…when he just can't hold out much longer, he likes it hard and fast and messy."
Looking very much the scolded child, Harry watched the woman walk away. She reminded him a bit of Hermione…. And that led him to remember that he hadn't told anyone in the family yet about their current situation. Which led to a soft swear and a flicker of a look back to the seat his husband had occupied a moment ago. They'd sat in awkward silence too long between unanswered questions to have a proper conversation. But he assumed if Charlie had informed anyone, they would be here. Every single Weasley would have filled the waiting room of the Emergency wing, had they known.
"A lady never fucks and tells, Potter."
Although he would be hard-pressed to admit it, Draco did actually end up enjoying himself (at least more than expected considering his let down at the beginning). Between himself and Teddy, they managed to effectively char three of their sausages. They were inedible, which left Harry tasked with fixing them something edible. A task he actually seemed slightly proud to take on, steadily holding his roasting stick at the perfect height above the flames.
Damn his love...
"Which one?"
All thoughts of sneaking off flew straight out the window. Harry blinked at Draco, like maybe he didn't hear him right. That statement could mean a thousand things. And he was just supposed to pick one out of thin air? "What does that even mean, Dray?" he asked. "They found
Yes, even when Hermione spoke to him like this. At least she kept him grounded.
But Harry merely reached down to grab the discarded flowers. Coming right back to where he was a moment ago, only now with his eyes downcast to where he caressed the petals of Draco's bouquet with a single fingertip, Luna's for the moment tucked under his arm. "Thank you for the flowers, even if I was too daft earlier to understand that they were for me. They mean something, don't they? Flowers? What do these ones say?"
But not all that happy.
"Charlie?"
, he thought, but shook that notion away on a shiver. He had no doubt, having met that ice-cold woman, that if she'd truly had her way there would have been no 'nearly'.
"Potter?"
"Answer it!" he declared.
". Harry's cheeks pinked at what it implied, but reached in to take a few. Just in case.
"Yeah, I wanted a second shot."
"I figured as much," Harry sighed as he sat down on the edge of the stage. "Ron's advice was to ignore that you even said anything."
"Which is?"
Downright fuckable.
"What do you call this, then?"
"So, ignore it?" Harry mused that over for a second. Despite the uneasy feeling filling his stomach, he ended up nodding. "Maybe that would be better. You're probably right."
It seemed the universe had been storing the pain for later. They had been given the illusion of a happy life. A short-lived illusion and now they had to deal with reality.
"Yeah, yeah…but I did a little bit of cocaine. Just a little bit. So I'm okay! I'm fully awake!" Looking like she'd just had a brilliant idea, she practically ran off towards the kitchen. "We should make breakfast!"
"Do you even care what I have to say about any of this?" Charlie snapped, fishing a cigar from the pocket of his cardigan and shoving it between his teeth.
Very well by magic, Draco managed to produce a handful of slick, clear liquid. He gently spread a modicum over Harry's shaft, wrenching a moan from him, before gliding the rest over his own. "Just do what I do," he guided, his free hand so gently caressing the back of Harry's neck while the other gripped him with sinful surety.
He just wanted to move on already.
"I should've chosen someone who wasn't so defensive…."
Draco smirked, stopping Harry's heart for a couple beats; he would never be used to that. "I don't know how that would be possible when I have so many things to do." Draco waved his hand as if to call attention to a pile of waiting chores. "There's the cooking and the cleaning and...and I simply cannot afford to fall behind. The master of the house likes things a certain way, you know."
Draco shook his head vigorously again. All he wanted was to be alone with his thoughts. But that wasn't healthy. That would solve none of his problems. That was the old Draco who cowered in fear and ran away from his problems. He was trying very hard not to be that boy any longer. "I'll come down, too. I've had my moment. I'm fine. I'll be fine." It wasn't a statement he wholeheartedly believed, but he was going to stand by what he said.
"Fuck," Harry finally sighed, finding that no other words appropriately summed up the way he'd wasted five and half years of his life. "Well, I'll take that slice of cake now, if it's all the same." If he couldn't relish in his moment of personal bravery, at the very least he could indulge himself on chocolate ganache.
Draco gathered himself soonest, managing to rake his hair back into place and hop down to the floor like all was normal. "My
After what felt like an eternity of that precarious atmosphere, the double-doored entrance to the dining hall finally and resolutely flew back open. Malfoy strode in like a man on a mission, only pausing to grasp Harry's wrist before turning and leaving in the same fashion. Harry stumbled along behind him, upending at least one glass in his attempt to follow quickly.
Shea's response was shocked, at first. Like he was surprised Draco would trust him with such a task. But he quickly recovered and pulled a demure frown. "You want me to find out what's wrong with the boy?"
Harry didn't feel like celebrating what was merely the start to a life of recurring problems.
It was a fascination obviously not shared by many people. Especially not by many men, he was sure, if Ron's comment was any indication. "Not always," Harry muttered, unfolding that day's newspaper. He felt incredibly vulnerable putting this interest out so vividly on display for someone he hardly knew, but also felt the pull to justify it. "Like, here…this one –
"Can you remember who you were…? Before the world told you who you
"I like you just as you are, Harry Potter."
"Oh, Mother…," Malfoy started, waiting for Narcissa's attention before continuing. "As we were discussing the next week, Harry and I found we have something in common. It seems he knows Nymphadora. Rather well, actually."
Just a fair warning, this might be the last chapter for a couple weeks. Might. We will see. I start IUI as soon as this weekend and I think I might end up being too nervous/anxious/excited about the outcome to get anything productive done. We will see. Wish us luck, though! And, as always, I do appreciate any comments on what you guys are thinking while reading. Enjoy!
With mild confidence and a bitten back smirk, Draco pulled in the familiar stench of Canadian whisky. "As are you…." With just the inkling of an upturned lip, Draco chanced a glance upward. Harry wasn't smiling and a second later neither was he. "Why'd you come back?"
"What do you mean it's stuck?" Shea looked up from this laptop, tilting his head at the boy. "I have bleach upstairs. We can fix it, if you wanted. For the record, though, I like it. It's bold."
Harry had been testing Malfoy's name, his
Officer DeWitt was gone by the time anything began sinking in for Harry again. He looked around to confirm that fact, ignoring Ron's apology, before sighing heavily and heading resolutely down the hall and into the house. If there was any time he could use a drink, it was at that moment.
Harry Potter felt like something Theo was going to lose himself in. He didn't even care about being careful or calculating any longer. He just wanted
Flopping down on the skewed mattress, half of his body tilting towards the floor, Harry slammed his eyes shut. He tried for just a moment to pretend that nothing was wrong. That he was just about to wake up from a weird dream and they could both laugh it off. Together. That Draco was slumbering by his side and The King was curled at their feet.
yet. They had been intimately close for just under a month and neither of them had uttered their feelings in such profound words. It was simply too early. But in his head, Harry did often find himself swept up in a moment where he could quite easily believe love was something on the horizon. It felt weirdly inevitable they end up there. After all, intense emotions of some kind had always run between them, and what was more intense than being in love?
"I'm not going to resist," Bill muttered as Harry stepped closer. "If you want to curse me or…simply arrest me. I won't resist. I deserve it all. I'm…I'm
"A lot," Teddy said with a frown and laboriously shifted to face Draco.
When his leaving at the end of all of this was too late to stop.
"Yeah?" Harry asked as he stabilized himself upon the counter behind him. It was haunting, really, to witness the way Draco could force himself to disappear like that.
Draco was nearly an exact clone of his father Lucius, the unforgiving man draped in a plush armchair. They had the same platinum shade of blond hair and both wore it long and tied back. Their faces were equally angled and equally set in a hybrid expression of smugness and the nose wrinkle of someone who might have stepped in dog shit. Most of all, however, they were both extremely attractive. In comparison, Narcissa looked almost bland, which should have been impossible.
"You're doing it again."
Harry snorted and mused it over. "Eh…."
Before they'd even made it to the door, a man was out on the porch, shouting at them. They could just barely see his torso above the tall grass, but there was no mistaking the anger in his features. Harry looked around the neighborhood cautiously, thankful he was still armed with his wand. The fact that not a single person out in their own lawn was looking their way spoke to how often this man must yell at strangers.
Deacon narrowed his eyes with obviously restrained venom. "You see, I was under the impression that was why we brought in Mr. Potter here. To help you with that."
Draco swallowed back the ill feeling this thought gave him and took just a single step forward. "St. Mungo's," he snapped. "
As much as Draco wanted to be upset, he just couldn't manage it. The boy missed him; that was for certain. But Draco had missed him, as well. Every time he was away, he came back desperately starved of this child's shining face. The face that was currently in the midst of a full, rashy breakout. "Oh, Scorpius, my sensitive prince…. Who's left you all on your own to play in the grass?"
"Our boy?" Draco whispered, holding back his own tears with little success.
What had Draco ever done in his life to deserve something so
"I'm on it."
The better question was probably –
It wasn't until he registered the slamming of the front door that Draco fully realized he'd lost the fight. And, potentially, more. With that door closed so resolutely between them, he'd lost the chance to plead his case. To defend himself and swear up and down that he
The only thing stopping him was the still-lingering tingle of Draco's lips upon his own within the last hour.
Draco's breath caught in his throat.
Their eyes met and both men knew in that instant what they were getting themselves into. This was more than a few intimate weekends. They would be seeing one another every day for an undetermined amount of time. This crossed boundaries they hadn't even known to set. It opened up doors of possibilities that hadn't even existed until this morning.
It didn't take much weighing for Harry to make his decision. Too self-aware of his shortcomings at the moment, he found his feet carrying him to the edge of the bed almost without a second thought. He pulled off his socks, using the few seconds it took to think over what he was about to do. What it could mean for his future or the future of the relationship he had built with Draco. It could mean nothing, after all they were just sleeping beside one another. Or it could mean everything, especially if Harry woke in the bright and sober morning with a desire for more — and most especially if he actually decided to finally take that more from Draco.
Harry itched to reach for his wand. The only thing stopping him was his lack of skill in this specific area of magic. He'd never wiped someone's mind before. That's why they had the Obliviators. "Mr. Manelo…," he muttered, desperately raking his fingers through his hair. "
Draco raised his lost gaze from the papers strewn in a strategic mess over his temporary desk. Harry's desk. Harry's desk that was covered in pictures of his friends and his family and his filthy husband. And his Teddy. Happy, grinning moving photographs of his godson who were so oblivious to the pain the real child was in. Bitter reminders of what exactly it was that he was striving to fix here. "Yeah?" he asked, his voice gruff and dark from fatigue and the weight of responsibility he was harboring inside.
The problem was, Draco didn't want to talk about it. He didn't even want to
The…"arrangement" with Draco kept Harry satisfied. It kept him sated and on the edge of happiness. Maybe just slightly over it. But that night with Charlie had almost been enough to make him forget his first love. If he ever had any hope for moving on, he was going to keep trying with his husband. He was going to keep hoping to feel that way just one more time in his life.
Once again, Draco interrupted, his foot falling back to the floor as he leaned in closer to Harry. "Call me anything, absolutely anything else at all, but Malfoy.
The more Harry spoke, the louder the rushing in Draco's ears became. The panic and humiliation drowned out his voice. He raised the bouquet — variegated red tulips and golden yellow jonquils — resenting the care he'd put into their selection. He'd spent an hour with the florist, debating what he wanted their delicate petals to convey. All for nothing. After all, he was too proud of a man to correct a concrete assumption. Especially when he was the one to have devastatingly misread the intent of the invitation in the first place.
As much as it obviously pained Malfoy to see it, Harry had a point. Knowing he'd won even before he'd been told as much, Harry grinned and put a much more comfortable amount of space between them. "I'm not going anywhere, Draco," he stated just loud enough for any Peeping Toms to hear clearly. "So, you may as well sit down and start explaining what it is I'm even being accused of!"
Malfoy snorted just as Harry's fingers curled around the transparent receiver. "I was actually going to tell you not to be too long." Harry felt his cheeks go flame red. "You'll want a good night's sleep before we start this all over again in the morning."
"I think…." Harry exhaled heavily, following it with a long and steady breath in. Ron continued to watch him with that same, gentle look. "I think he spouted off, er, that big L-word."
"No…no, I quit the coffee shop," Harry mumbled. "I never was good in chemistry. Being a barista was too much like mixing chemicals. If you do one thing wrong...the whole drink is ruined. So, yeah…it just wasn't working out…."
"Teddy?!"
sausage, instead?" He looked so damn proud of himself, brandishing that uncooked sausage with that pathetic wink. (Seriously, how had he ever grown to be an actual adult without learning to properly wink with only
Harry was sure by now that he didn't want to hear. And he certainly didn't want to see the words come out of this man's mouth. Giving in to the most primal of his urges, he closed the distance between them and pressed his forehead into Draco's shoulder. "Just be out with it."
Coming here to this house, even under the circumstances as they were, had been so thrilling for Teddy. Spending time with Draco had sounded so welcoming, even if most of his days were to be spent with strangers. And the idea of being here, away from everything else, was refreshing.
Harry fists balled at his sides, but he didn't move otherwise. "How much longer is this going to take?" he seethed through his teeth. Trying very hard to keep some sort of cool. Some control and calm when all he wanted was to slap the smugness out of this man.
" only contained a single office. And inside of that office was a gaunt-looking man who underneath the eye bags and sallow skin could have been very attractive. The office was dimly lit, containing only an L-shaped desk absolutely over-laden with papers on the right and several quills furiously scratching on various papers to the left. The man sat in the middle of it all, seemingly unharried and at home in the chaotic environment that had Harry's teeth on edge. The man eyed the two of them, obvious curiosity barely bridled.
thought about him. He was in Harry's dreams and in everything he saw or did during a day. He'd even managed to mess up a simple protection charm while teaching a class because the silvery effect of the casting had reminded him of Draco's emotion-slick irises. He hadn't thought about the man this much since he was sixteen and that made everything just shift right into fucking perspective.
Harry found himself addicted to the serenity that came in the moments after an orgasm. After Draco's fingers turned soft instead of insistent, as the tingles wracked his body, with his limbs feeling like jelly and his heart so fucking full it could explode. To think he'd gone this long without such an all-encompassing emotion absolutely blew his mind.
say. Where did he even start when he wasn't sure what the beginning was?
?" Harry snorted when the man flinched. When all three of them flinched. "Or a combination of all three maybe? If I had milky white tits and a trust fund, would I be welcomed to stay?"
"Draco, I need you to let me talk to Charlie alone."
Deacon Bates had said the words "you see" thirty-seven times in the span of an hour. For this alone, Harry was certain he hated the man.
"And I'm not ashamed to admit I care enough about our friendship to see you get laid tonight."
Draco faltered, the beginning of a question still heavy on his tongue. It seemed to take him a moment to correct course while Harry warred with the urge to encourage him to finish what he had been about to ask. Eventually, Draco cleared the words from his throat and slowly nodded. "Fine. I recently secured a position with Madam Primpernelle. It's temporary — she's looking to expand the variety of her stock and just needed an extra hand mixing the test batches. But I'm hopeful she'll offer me something more permanent in the future."
The denial swiftly pulled Draco from his own head, the effect of his carelessness sending him reeling in a different direction. "Oh…wow, good on you. Cheers." He quickly saluted with his drink before desperately raising his glass to his mouth and chugging the remainder of his beer. He signalled the bartender for a refill, gratefully using any excuse he could find not to look back up at Potter.
For months, Theo avoided these thoughts. All he wanted was to be safe. The Ministry came and raided his family home – what was left of it – and found nothing. The objects he gave Draco to hold onto were all he had left of his broken family. He was left with the home, but not much else after it and the family vaults had been raided for war reparations. There was literally nothing else to find.
to pull himself together.
"Not even Dad? Why not?"
Harry wasn't convinced he even
Across the room on the table sat a stunning flower arrangement. Harry's lip quirked briefly into a smile. "How long was I out?"
His hands circled around to Potter's back where his spine bubbled up just barely against his skin. Draco traced the ring of every vertebra, two at a time, pressing deftly into the divots between each one until he reached the nape of Potter's neck.
But this was the part that Harry needed to be truthful with himself about. As euphoric as this meeting had left him, being around Draco had
"Mum?" he whispered as he pushed the door open. He could see her familiar shape nestled up under the blankets. It felt more right to see her lying there than baking away in the kitchen like most mothers. This room and that bed were the homiest places he could think of. Gently, he settled down onto that mattress, set his own cup aside, and placed his free hand on Lily's shoulder. "I've brought you tea…."
Pushing the arm off, Harry angled so he was facing his husband as head-on as possibly. "Shell Cottage," he stated and then just waited. Waited for some sort of flicker in Charlie's demeanor. Waited for any hint of remorse or shame.
dinner, he wouldn't be nearly so worked up. But if he could eventually get himself to normalize what he was working up to do, well, then everything from there on would be a piece of cake, wouldn't it?
me, Draco?" He ended with an over the top, too-obvious wink.
"Scheme? I don't
"Yes, yes, exactly. Would you please just get naked already?" Harry laughed to combat the nerves laced through his words.
Clearly, Hermione felt much the same. She leveled a look at her friend that questioned his parenting skills (of which he still had rather few, in his defense) before a flick of her wand had completed the task for the boy. "Rose is down for a nap up in her room. If you're quiet, you may play with Ron's chess set in the library."
go to America," Harry snapped, standing abruptly. Pulling away from the angry energy radiating off of his husband. "Look…. I'm going to find the Head Healer again. See if there's any change. If you could, uh…. If you could get me a coffee or a really strong black tea or…or something, I would really appreciate that."
"I'm trying to," Draco reassured her, himself, and Harry who was watching him with those big, green eyes.
He wasn't in control anymore.
His face screwing up in distaste, Teddy only clung closer to his godfather. "I don't want to go play with a baby. I'd rather stay here."
"Oh, get out of the
"Please…don't do that, Uncle Dray," Teddy said sternly, knowing where Draco's mind had gone. Knowing the stories and the gossip and
To give him more.
Draco audibly swallowed even while his hand snuck back to once again find Harry's. The contact felt so warm, so unexpected. So
"That's really no excuse, Edward. I expect a sincere apology after you've thought about it awhile."
, Draco, I really want to unpack all of this. The settings of these dreams
And he could always trust her to be unguardedly real with him.
He was moving on, and it was about damn time. He'd discovered Potter had already done so over five months ago, which had only set Draco backwards in his own recovery. However, the time for wallowing and moping about was over. It was time to try again.
"Isn't the point to branch out and make friends with others of similar experience, anyway?"
The question was barely out of Draco's mouth before Harry stepped forward, erasing all ideas of space between them. Draco's breath stalled in his throat as every cell within him trained on Harry. Watching him. Waiting. Wondering what he was about to do and fearing for the worst, his anxiety feeling like it was working overtime.
Hermione might not be mad, but she was definitely hurt. Emotion clogged her throat, twisting her implications like a knife in Harry's heart. "It's honestly not what it looks like. Not even close!"
soup.
Except the song eventually ended. The string of dancers dispersed and Draco was left, reeling, almost exactly in the place he took off from. He found himself dizzy from the abruptness of it, his head beginning to spin. "I think I need to sit down," he huffed to himself, stumbling backwards a couple of steps before gently collapsing back onto the grass.
"Gina."
. And Draco had his own little family to keep himself content. They had separate lives.
Harry watched as Draco's Adam's apple bobbed up and down. Watched him hold back the emotion beginning to shake his voice. He shifted in his own seat, suddenly uncomfortable at the raw confessions pouring from Draco's lips. They might not be enemies any longer, but they certainly weren't friends, were they? Uncertain as to how to answer his own question, he found himself leaning forward in his seat, resting a steady hand upon Draco's knee in what he hoped was a reassuring gesture.
Biting back a grin, Harry took the same hint and swallowed the rest of his words. Storing them for finish later. "He does talk too much, doesn't he?"
In stark contrast to the bedroom, James Potter with his face full of freckles was a real and vivid stain poised just so on the back of Teddy's sofa. Aware, as always, of the way his body screamed confidence. But Teddy knew the tension in that boy's - for he was no more than a boy at barely seventeen – shoulders. He knew the tension well now. And he knew how aggressively those shoulders could shake at the promise of being able to let go of it all.
"Jonquils." Draco winced, cowering at even the idea of sharing the more raw and real things Harry made him feel. "They, uh…. They convey the rest of my heart. All of the desire within me for every broken and perfect piece of you. They tell a story of every second I have spent falling for you. Of every time I ached to be at your side. Of every touch I wished would have lingered. Of every time I wanted to…to hold you. To kiss you." Of course, Draco had wished for much more than what he spoke of, but he could hardly endure the embarrassment of even the innocent desires he'd expressed. It would have been impossible to describe to Harry all of the nights he'd spent dreaming of things more carnal and headier in nature.
How could he not listen when passion laced every breath Harry Potter ever spoke? How could he not want to train his eyes on those lips, memorizing every syllable that passed through them? Even when the words were nothing but drunken babble, they were still laced with everything Amortentia smelled like.
It didn't last long enough. What they had never did. They were always chasing after new moments like this before the old ones had even begun. Always chasing….
But he was desperate, and desperate people are known to make terrible decisions.
As soon as Sharif had so much as turned around, Draco was on his feet and making a beeline for the bar. He ordered the darkest beer they had on tap in the largest size they offered, tipping the bartender generously out of sheer gratitude.
to you. And I know…that if I had gone to that ceremony, everything would have become about
Maybe Potter knew, maybe he didn't. He wasn't letting on either way. Who knew he had it in him to be mysterious or coy? He merely took the stool beside Draco, relaying his usual order to the bartender while settling the palm of his left hand against the inner flesh of Draco's thigh.
"Oh, please don't ask that question." Startled, Draco barely managed a raised eyebrow in response. "You're going to ask me why I chose to work in childcare. And if you do, I'll have to pretend I have a passion for children when, in reality, I just needed a job and they happened to be hiring."
There was the barest hint of a smile – or maybe a smirk? – at the corner of Draco's lip. To his left was a porcelain cup, seemingly untouched. He pushed it just barely towards Harry, tapping at the rim with a shiny, manicured nail. "Dry cappuccinos should have no milk – only foam. A dry foam. Large, airy bubbles as opposed to the velvety ones you might find in a latte. They should be light as the only weight in the cup should come from the espresso. What you made me seven times that day was an extremely frothy latte. Honestly, do you even drink coffee?"
Malfoy merely blinked back at him.
The word was stark black again. And then clinically white. Vividly bright. Harry blinked, lip curling at the offense. For a brief moment, there was a pale blue haze surrounding him but it disappeared like thin smoke a moment later. The world had a blurry texture to it and there was the obvious missing pressure of his glasses upon the bridge of his nose. Everything around him seemed wrong. Just slightly off. He didn't recognize the tiled ceiling above him nor the scratch of the sheets beneath his hands.
"Right, all squared away!" Hermione exclaimed, running back into the room wearing a better-fitting shirt and joggers. She fluffed her still-wet hair with her hands as she settled into the sofa beside Harry, appearing to force a smile. "Ron took the later shift at the shop — figured he'd give George a night of reprieve — so it'll just be the two of us if you'd like to stay. We could order something to eat, or I could probably manage to whip up some sandwiches?"
Those children were all still very much dead. There was no bringing them back, not even if their killer had been caught. Their parents would still grieve them for the rest of their lives and the world would never know the magic they might have produced. McClain had left an irreparable hole in magic. Who knew what those children could have become.
Trying not to breathe it in too deeply, Harry took a half-step away. "You're in early. Did you have a breakthrough?"
Draco, who had followed closely behind, sat on the corner of his desk and watched Harry with measured calculation. It was strange having to think so hard about the right way to
. It went against every ounce of better judgment he had, and yet….
…all of you, Charlie. I need you…."
Theo had, of course, been the supposed whistleblower he had threatened. And apparently that had been the nail in his coffin.
him?"
He delivered orders.
The question slipped out before Draco could hope to quell it, effectively bombing any attempt at keeping the topic light.
Harry followed along, the impending stress of the morning melting off with each second spent in the place he also still considered home. London was great and he loved his life and apartment with Hermione, but nothing compared to a place where everything felt familiar. Nothing compared to the smell of his mother's perfume permeating everything or the remnants of his father's hearty laugh filling every room.
"Oh, you really are just a little baby gay, aren't you?" Harry blushed. "It's okay, we've all been there," Astoria reassured him. "No, not yet. But if you're really desperate, you can marry through the Muggle legal system. The Ministry just won't recognize that union as valid when it comes to wills and such. For now. I have hope things will change soon. After all, our world is supposed to be healing itself now since we're rid of our plague of evil — thank you for that, by the way."
The moon was finally waning. With it, Remus was finally returning to himself. For now. It never lasted long and he was always left exhausted. To be honest, he never truly felt like himself. It was like he was always chasing after the attacks for half of the month and desperately running away from it for the other.
"I know."
"I thought…that something bad was going to come from the way you were looking at me." They weren't the words Teddy wanted to speak. They felt like a lie. Like a half-truth.
and not for Draco. Things which clearly stated "This didn't happen for you, Malfoy. It wasn't yours."
The door labeled "
see, Mr. Bates! You asked me to come on to this team. And if you want me here, you're going to have to trust me. You're going to have to let me do. My. Job." He straightened back up, combing fingers through his hair in a feat to regain composure. "Relinquish a bit of your control, Mr. Bates, and you may get some results finally. Maybe even before this killer takes another innocent life."
you and Uncle Draco back together?" Teddy asked, peeking over Harry's shoulder at the bold headline of the Evening Prophet from the night previous.
"Potter?"
"I'm so sorry, darling, I was only just now able to get away."
"Draco, don't you d-"
own. "Mum's not doing well…."
A carelessly wanton noise wrenched itself from Harry's throat and he shifted closer into Draco's body. If ever there were a more perfect time for Harry to be ready, he couldn't possibly dream of it. Astoria was on a date of her own, so they had been alone all night. Draco made a beautiful salmon dinner and served them both with an acceptable amount of sweet wine. There was soft, beautiful music on the wireless as they played cribbage and Harry felt light and easy all evening. At one point, Draco pulled him to his feet and danced him across the sitting room. He'd rested his head upon Draco's chest and allowed himself to be gently swayed wherever Draco wanted to go. In that tender moment, it had felt like they were one person with one softly beating heart.
"Pretty sure? How sure?"
When he eventually gathered the wherewithal to focus on something other than Draco's kiss-bruised mouth, Astoria was standing in front of them with her arms crossed and a smug expression on her face. "Look, darlings, I'm all for this," she gestured vaguely between Harry and Draco, "but can it not happen during function hours?"
While pulling in long and slow breaths, Harry took in his surroundings as best he could. It was all still blurry and unrecognizable but he did know he was on something akin to a gurney and that this woman was dressed like a nurse. Like a Healer, maybe. "Am I in a hospital?" he asked softly, his throat sore and dry. It felt like he had been screaming himself raw.
The entire situation felt insanely surreal.
He shook his head even harder, focusing on digging a bite out of the carton. "No…. I don't think that I'm…
he thought of Potter was bound to change eventually. It was inevitable.
"So you do have a heart," Harry whispered.
With a shrug, Harry leant back against the wall. "Of course not. He's my kid. Maybe I haven't been the perfect father…. I was only seventeen when his parents died. What seventeen-year-old knows fuck all about changing diapers and…and teaching the alphabet? Let alone navigating through all this other shit. And then you add in the fact that I'm Harry Fucking Potter and bad things just follow me around…. I'm fucking that kid up before he even has a chance. He'd be better off somewhere…quieter. Without me."
Hermione smiled and reached back to set her wine glass down almost too cautiously. "You know there's no rush, right? This may not technically be your house anymore, but it can still be your home when you need it to be." Her arm snaked around his waist to give him an awkward squeeze. "Why don't you stay just a bit longer? A few months? A year…? We could use the extra help." She clasped her hands over her stomach and smiled softly, looking far too serene for the current atmosphere.
But maybe…if he let it all out, his heavy heart would feel just a bit lighter.
"We do."
Andrew McClain didn't look guilty. Or, more appropriately, he didn't look like he
Which wasn't a terrible place to be with a view so breathtaking. A wistful lightness filled his chest, harkening him back to another time. The sky was never this bright back in Chelsea. He raised one hand, tracing the constellations and naming them off in his head. Finding his family in the stars had always set him at ease as a child, either in Wiltshire or here at Hogwarts.
If convincing Charlie that working this case was a good idea was going to be difficult, convincing him that Harry working with his ex wasn't a terrible idea was going to be damn near impossible. "Yes, I will be working rather close with him. I'm not about to hide that from you. Does that worry you? Or make you jealous…?"
"No one," Harry ground out between his teeth. "I just like to read them…."
Eyes wide, Harry looked up quickly from his tangled and twisting hands. "Hm?" he intonated while gathering himself. Putting all thoughts of Malfoy being a human fucking being out of his head before flashing a shaky smile at the man's mother.
It had been months since Draco agreed to hold the items for Theo. And for months, Draco had waited on bated breath for another knock on his door to take the pressure away. The knock he had been expecting, however, did not come. Exactly twelve hours after he had confronted Theo, the Patrol was at their door. Tearing through their home. He had threatened to do just this to his friend, just trying to scare him. Because Draco was scared…. He hadn't liked lying to Harry.
"Sir, no disrespect…but we've already given our statements to at
This man sat right before Harry had a complex of some kind. He was sure of it. Narrowing his eyes, he just barely uttered, "Also currently unemployed…."
This victim was nothing like the rest. It shattered every theory they had come up with thus far. The only factor that fit the pattern was the weapon. The potion. A potion that hadn't been seen in years due to the difficulty of obtaining its ingredients – blood of a dead man, a whole and crushed dragon's heart, elf skin. Murder begat murder. It would be all too coincidental if there were two killers using it at the same time for different purposes. It was enough to have Draco pulling his hair out.
. Last and most importantly, he settled himself into a barstool at the pub Macmillan frequented with his friends when Potter was unavailable for one reason or another.
There was an unspoken code amongst Purebloods. It only existed because of heavy Pureblood involvement with dark wizards and dark magic. It was a code of protection with unspeakable consequences. These consequences could range from shunning to cursing on unimaginable levels. But it wasn't the risk that held them in place. It was expectation.
"Time heals all wounds, Potter," Astoria continued before Harry could weigh in on that heavy statement. "That's what they say, isn't it? But not all wounds can be healed. Time can't heal the fact that my son almost died because of something
Sighing wistfully, Harry grabbed the ends of the rich purple scarf Reginald had dutifully wrapped around Draco's neck before leaving. "It just seems so unfair to go through something like that at their age. Especially considering the difficultly of their younger days. I mean, that story Eliza just so casually threw out about being forced into a marriage and into having children with a woman before her transition? I just couldn't imagine…." He trailed off as Draco's face darkened, knowing he hadn't chosen the right example to lock on to. Maybe May was right about his privilege. "Draco, I didn't mean—"
Even when he was almost literally flying out of bed in fear-laced panic.
It was so easy to depict the sadness in his eyes now that Draco knew to look for it. It was so much easier to pinpoint when exactly he had been broken between these perfectly framed pictures. There was a certain happiness missing in the small age gap. "If I had just stayed around…."
"Come here." The too-loud sound of a hand hitting the mattress filled the room.
A point he made quite loudly to Malfoy the instant they were behind a closed door. A point which was ignored as he was muttering his own grievances against his family. "Quit my ass…. Greta didn't quit. They're losing it…."
Harry stood. His time was up. His time had been up before he'd even stepped foot in the door. "Thank you for telling me," he muttered to his shoes. "I know it's not my place considering what you've told me…. But if you're still thinking about your decision, please know that Draco is indeed a different man. He loves that boy more than anything in the world. I don't want to see what he'd become if you took even the small time he has with Scorpius away from him." He didn't wait to see if Astoria acknowledged his words. He simply made for the door and quietly let himself out, head spinning too much to even manage disapparition.
Giggling so hard he nearly fell over, Scorpius exclaimed, "Fin'ers 'n' toes!"
Just Charlie.
The label of Harry's beer bottle began to blur and he had to hide his cheesy grin behind a quick swig. The words 'beautiful' and 'miracle' were on the tip of his tongue, but the sudden stillness and ghostly quiet of the kitchen waylaid his attention. He followed the Weasleys' fixed (and possibly surprised?) gaze, his smile slowly slipping. From his position on the countertop, he couldn't quite see what so obviously caught them until the man stepped out from the doorway. "Draco," he stated and wasted no time in jumping down.
"It's a place to live," Potter replied with a shrug and pulled him upwards. "I don't use most of the rooms and have no idea how to even go about replacing the decorations with my own. But I have a bed and I have a kitchen, so it works."
This man beneath his hands loved him. He had loved him for so long, despite absolutely everything, and that could be okay. It
"She's popped down to the off-license. Don't worry, I'll stay on the line with you 'til she's back, though."
"So…I take it you're not being charged as a co-conspirator," Draco finally said. He had been waiting for Harry to take the first word. He so desperately wanted the yelling and blaming to just be over and done with. But they had been warned that visits were shortly timed and the silence had taken enough of their allotted minutes.
Perhaps he was doomed to lose this, too.
With how badly he'd messed up, Draco wasn't really expecting it to be that easy. But the crass way in which Harry spoke still stung. Sighing softly, he reached out and popped another bubble. "Treacle tart."
me. Don't you? Because I've been trying to pin that down on my own and—"
"So it lived."
"I was just helping out a friend," Draco said in a voice so quiet, it might have just been the wind.
As if the atmosphere wasn't already awkward….
change if you try to deceive me from the moment you step back into my life."
"It's no rumor. That would be a fact. While my godson still lives with me, I have promised to keep off of cases. It puts my family at better ease." A small smile cracked Harry's lips. "I have a bit of a penchant for…walking into danger. As I'm sure most of our world already knows."
"Lesbians?" Ron's snort effectively cut through the tension filling the air and Harry had never in his life felt more grateful for the friends he'd made.
Draco growled as he jumped to his feet, pushing Harry up against the wall. His kiss in comparison, however, was butterfly gentle and dripping with sweet affection. "Stay for dinner?" he whispered so earnestly it had Harry internally squealing beneath his cool and collected nod.
Harry watched her step through the emerald green of the fire, leaving him alone all too fast. But considering he had a mostly naked Draco Malfoy waiting for him on his bed, he had to say he couldn't blame her. The morning had been awkward for them all, but it was ultimately his mess to clean up. With a steeling breath, he made his way back to the bedroom, watching Draco fumble with the buttons of his dress shirt. "Did you take the potion I gave you?"
Smiling gently, Harry pulled himself out of the bed that still smelt like his lover. Pulling himself back into the real world again. "Hey, Dad!" Teddy greeted him, just barely looking up from his sketch pad. "Nan and I picked out some new pencils. They're really smooth. Really nice."
Deep down, Harry harbored a dark hatred for this. He resented his husband for leaving him on his own.
"I—" Harry began, but quickly found he didn't know what he was going to say. He didn't know what
It all eventually became far too much to handle and Harry needed to get out. He'd cooped himself up in this flat for far too long, anyway, and it would do him some good to get out.
The look on Shea's face from across the room said he saw right through it.
"I, uh…I'm probably going to be held for a couple days at the Ministry until I'm fully sober. I'll have to meet with my counsellor and have her clear me for release. And, if the court clears me, I guess. It's not the first time I've violated my conditions…. So, er, as much as I appreciate what you're saying to me, I guess…I just have a hard time seeing myself like that right now with everything going on. But I want to. I want to be…everything you think I am. Everything you think I could be. I want to be that, and I want to be more." Harry bit his lip and looked up, just long enough to catch the fleeting shadow of a look crossing Draco's face. "I need to be better, Draco, and it feels like…like maybe you're the missing piece that can help motivate me to do that."
. Harry paled, "Minister, I wasn't…." He cleared his throat and stood straighter, knocking his head back towards the hall. "Sorry to interrupt. I-I should've knocked." He took a step back, slamming into the doorframe and hindering his progress towards leaving entirely.
By the time he and Draco had both put in their orders and the waitress was walking away, the air felt less electric between them. There was even a hint of a smile hidden in the corner of Draco's mouth again, waiting for Harry to tease it forth. "How have you been?" Harry asked softly, just as Draco began to speak.
The thought wouldn't leave his head. The words just kept echoing over and over again, always in Harry's soft and pleading voice.
"I do love you," Charlie whispered, sounding heartbroken. "I love you and I love Teddy. All I want is for us to be a family."
"You should go," Draco echoed, pushing Harry back just a bit. Ripping him off and feeling very much like he was losing a vital part of himself. "I'll be by…as soon as I can. If Teddy…." He found his words faltering as his thoughts drifted back to the darkness. Back to the guilt. "Tell him I love him," he quickly finished and a little less than roughly shoved Harry away.
He'd shut the door before he even stood a chance to leave quietly. (And maybe Draco was right when he said Harry always stomped into the house like a rogue rhino.) Steeling his nerves and slapping a smile on his face, Harry waded through the spiced air and down to the kitchen. He didn't say a word until he was on the last step, peeking around the corner. "Hey…. What's on the menu?"
Rita Skeeter developed her instant updates mere weeks later. Draco was sitting at the breakfast table, buttering toast and fully immersed in the particularly vivid dream he'd only just awoken from. He'd denied himself the release his body had desperately craved that morning, too shaken by what he wanted to be comfortable enough to allow even a fraction of the pleasure it would bring him. His fingers trembled and his body ached with longing and then, suddenly, there Potter's face was
The jingle of nametags were the only alert before the attack. The dog – a petite Staffordshire bull terrier – came barreling back in from the front yard, all wagging tail and dripping tongue. "Oh, shit!" Harry exclaimed, taking his full force right in the chest. Not a moment later, a fluffy Australian shepherd rushed in as well, vying for full attention.
That bell tinkled again on her way out, almost ominously calling attention to her absence. With her gone, Harry found interest once more in the hardwood floor, his brain suddenly devoid of anything useful to say. He was nervous, but couldn't gauge in that moment if it was because he was left alone with Draco Malfoy, or because he was left alone with Draco Malfoy…who was incidentally hot.
He nodded, his head falling into his hands. "On a Death Eater. Nott was never a Death Eater."
It was easier not to dream.
Theo had been used. Of course it had all been too easy and he had noticed that from the beginning. Potter had been all too willing. It should have tipped him off. Of course Potter knew. He knew from the beginning that Theo had been the supposed whistleblower. He had friends at the Ministry. Of course this was a setup. Theo had been so
As much as the idea appealed to him, Harry just couldn't continue staring at the floor all day. Again, he contemplated the idea of just leaving without another word, but that could only raise more suspicion. His best bet was to stick it out, so he lifted his gaze and dutifully extended his hand toward Malfoy. "Happy birthday, then," he managed to choke, almost losing the words halfway through because he simply hadn't prepared himself for
"All that's left," he quickly recovered, guiding Harry to the single door at the end of the hallway, "is the office." He opened a door marked "PRIVATE", revealing a much tidier desk than the one out front, a conversational corner with a grouping of comfortable chairs, and a staircase against the far wall. "For the moment, Astoria and I occupy the space above," Draco said, gesturing to the stairs. "We have it charmed on the outside to blend in with the rest of the buildings, but there's really only one other floor."
Once Harry managed to (rather awkwardly) pull the shorts off completely, all that remained between them was that last barrier. "We can stop here if you need to," Draco reassured, sensing the hesitance in the way Harry traced that deep V at Draco's abdomen.
It all played out like a bad movie in Harry's unconscious. Black and white and fuzzy. The strangled bliss of their life together. The simpler times before all of this. The weightless in-between when they were both still adjusting. Figuring out who they were supposed to be. Figuring out who they
"Theodore Nott?" Potter asked in a stilted whisper. He was staring at Theo with extreme intensity. Like he was just now seeing who had decided to bother him. Like he had thought he was just brushing off a stranger. "You…. You're the whistleblower?"
"Come
to love this insufferable arse? But, unfortunately, he had indeed signed a binding contract. If he didn't follow through, then he'd have to find a way to return the advance. A way that didn't involve taking money out of his parents' hands. "I can play stupid for you if that's what you what. I can play 'peasant' while you play 'pauper'. But you know you can't treat people like that in normal life, right?" Harry stepped closer into the kitchen, feeling weirdly awkward and unconfident in his stockinged feet. "Even if you are paying them…."
this disgusting revelation was it for a lifetime. He was also hoping to have his husband by his side to handle this ordeal. He was hoping to have his family even after all of this. And now…. "Charlie knew?" he managed to gasp out between short, almost-panicked breaths. "What the
"I like too many things about you to name, honestly," Draco continued, either even softer than before or simply seeming that way because Harry was just on the edge of consciousness. "Your ridiculous glasses, your bargain-bin cologne, the way your hair always looks like you've just been ravished in a broom closet. And,
They followed Narcissa down the main hall, passing the only two rooms Harry knew aside from Malfoy's bedroom — the parlour and the dining room where they had eaten lunch. Where he apparently wrongfully assumed they would also be havingdinner. They kept walking until they came upon the last door in the hall. Narcissa delicately rolled the double doors aside and stepped back. Watching Harry very carefully as he took in the sight of a grandiose dining hall. He tried to maintain a neutral expression and not to appear impressed.
Narcissa's lips curled into that sickly smile, taking a step closer to her son. His perfume drenched hair was pulled back into a ribbon, the silken strands contained just so at the nape of his neck. Somehow, one lock had managed to stay loose to frame his sharp cheekbone. Harry wasn't certain if this was left on purpose or by true accident. Regardless, Narcissa wasn't likely to let it remain unchecked. Her fingers, sharp and bony like claws, easily tucked the silken strands back where they belonged. "What would you do without me?" she whispered, patting Malfoy's cheek twice before turning on her heel. "Come along, boys. Lucius would prefer you were punctual."
"So when I come home, all I want is a little of the stability I've built for myself. But…these days that seems a little out of reach. Astoria doesn't care if she lives anymore. Scorpius is a blessing but also a mess. It seems every day there's something new trying to kill him. I couldn't bear to lose either of them. But if I lost them both? It's a silly thing to worry about. Neither of them are in danger of keeling over tomorrow…. Well, Astoria might if she keeps doing coke at crazy hours in the morning. Which I'm sure you already knew about. She tells you everything.
To his credit, Harry— No,
"It's getting to you, isn't it? The case?"
She waved off his affronted tone. "The lady doth protest too much, methinks." It was her one eyebrow raised in suggestion that did it. She wasn't joking and Harry found that weirdly consoling. If someone on the outside of this mess thought them good together…well, why not, then?
"I brought coffee." Harry set two cups down on the desk. He knew before it was even said where they were from. The tempting scent of the perfect brew and fresh-baked pastries filled Draco with instant, irreplaceable comfort. "It's from that Muggle place Greengrass works at. Shea suggested it. He was…very helpful this morning. Call me crazy, but I don't think he's all that mad at you, anymore. How about Deacon? Did he say anything to you yet?"
Harry wanted to punch him. He wanted to punch Malfoy in that smug little face of his. If he did, he would likely lose out on that extra five thousand pounds…but it just might be worth it. It was hard to believe someone of his supposed stature had actually ever been clocked for real. When Daddy had money, grievances could be purchased instead of settled. But he just knew, after having known Malfoy for only a few days, that he had likely deserved it all his life. And it felt only fitting that Harry, this dark-skinned nobody from Bristol, be the one to deflower that fresh virgin-white mouth.
The great Harry Potter was a mere bartender.
…. He has my genes. And he inherited my gift. He had a way with flowers and trees and grass. Things
And that was that.

Even with that one solid
Earlier on, Harry had seen the phone on the nightstand at the left side of the bed.
"Does instant coffee count?"
Leaving home meant he now had to deal with the mess he'd walked himself into. But staying there any longer felt like a good way to erode his soul. With that trauma and dramatic backstory at the forefront of his mind, it was time to get back to his irrational romantic endeavor. Although it was really anything but romantic. The man he was paired with was a complete ass with far too much money to throw around. There was no way any sort of romance was going to be budding there.
And feeling still so undeniably in love with Draco Malfoy? Not only did it feel like a sin, it simply felt like a bad idea. It felt
"We're talking about this." It was Harry's last attempt.
The girl continued on as if she hadn't heard him, angling her body so he could no longer see the little screen. Keeping in mind he was supposed to be as obnoxious as possible in this coming week, he leaned in closer. "I meant your little pet thing. Did you name it?"
Harry blinked from his weary daze and turned to look out the window. "Must be…," he muttered, matching the address to the one he'd written down the day before. After thanking and paying the taxicab driver, Harry hauled his overnight bag from the boot. As he heard the car pull away behind him, he stood behind the automated gate and stared up at the house before him.
. No sex involved. Sounds like he just wants to piss off his parents or something. I suppose it's a bit insulting that I'm right for that job…but honestly, I thought we could really use the money."
With a heavy sigh, Draco lifted his empty tumbler and shook the ice in order to catch the bartender's attention. The man nodded back to him, smiling gently. Draco wore kind eyes today. Kind blue eyes and simple medium-length chestnut hair. He looked approachable and hated himself for it. When he chose his likenesses, he tried to go for men (and sometimes women) who could blend. Who were plain and who could be easily passed over. He didn't like to draw attention to himself because that wasn't what he was there for
Perhaps if he couldn't, or rather
As always, please let me know what you're thinking. I'm always curious to hear any and all comments! Thank you.
Another inside joke…. Harry hadn't been so aware of these little things before. But now in Draco's absence, it was all he could see. The little things that made them fall in love. The little things that now felt like a betrayal. Just more layers on the lies he had believed.
Draco didn't have the luxury of ruminating and remembering. It wasn't as if he could pretend he had forgotten his own name. So he bit his lip, hoping he appeared just as coy and just as cunning, and threw out a name he hoped he remembered correctly. It was the one he used most often as it was similar to his own and therefore easier to remember.
Harry stayed silent, allowing Astoria to gather her thoughts. It took him a moment to realize she may have been holding back tears, her jaw clenched even tighter than a few minutes previous. What had he just walked himself into...?
Floundering for words and feeling like he was suffocating on the stale, hostile air in the room, Harry staggered into a chair. "We really had it wrong," he managed between short gasps. "
"Sure, I'd like that."
of a daughter to. Honestly, I'm just…so comforted to know Draco and I are in this together. I can't imagine a life with someone else who might have been in line with my parents' way of thinking. I can't imagine how miserable a life like that might be.
Harry had very little experience with children. He wasn't even sure if he wanted kids of his own. (That was one of those future problems he'd yet to dwell on.) He was one-hundred-percent certain, however, this was the perfect example of how not to raise them. Which only further brought him to thinking…what was Malfoy like as a child? Was he just as petulant and obstinate? Was he bred from a young age to expect everything handed to him on a silver platter?
Once he acknowledged the conversation they were having, the world only became louder. Nearly in slow motion, Teddy set his spoon down as well. Knowing the mistake he was making just a little too late. Knowing where this would eventually lead. And he wasn't ready for that yet. Especially not with Draco. Not after that
Pretty much as expected, Charlie went silent a moment. He rested his forehead on their clasped hands and conjured up some tears to help aide his case. Not that there was any grace left for him now. "It was an accident, darling. Only an accident…." Harry's lip curled, finding it hard to believe something like that could be an accident. He pulled his hands away roughly and forced Charlie to look him in the eye.
. I suppose it all makes sense then, doesn't it?" She hastily made for the bedroom door, covering her peripherals with a stiff hand even though it was already much too late.
Looking back, Harry had been the one to initiate the
The anxious pit deep in Teddy's stomach sunk somehow even further when he obeyed. Anticipating the worst. Always anticipating the worst.
Really, Harry could simply have all the answers he wanted if he were to just go talk to Draco. Get his side of the story. Allow him to explain, if he did indeed have an explanation.
See, I knew I just wasn't finished.... Here's the other voice that just NEEDED to be heard in this tale.
Frowning, Draco took a step closer to the man. "What caused the bus crash?"
No longer afforded her blissful ignorance, Narcissa huffed a disgruntled breath and lay down her own cutlery. "This is hardly appropriate dinner conversation, Draco. I am absolutely disappointed in you."
"Can you just get to the point, Deacon?" Draco eventually snapped, just before Harry was ready to do the same. "Are you kicking Potter off the case or not?"
They had finally come to the absolute worst part of all of the bad news. The part Harry had been dreading, especially considering Charlie's reaction thus far. He gritted his teeth, hands fists at his sides on the other side of the fire. "Yes…. The best option for us will be to stay in America for a bit. And Malfoy has offered a spare room in his home. He, his roommate, and their boyfriend have a good system worked out for the care of their son. He offered for Teddy to be able to share in that system since I'm helping him out. And it's looking like my best option at this point considering what just happened tonight with Ron and Hermione."
Harry had a feeling Draco's words were well thought out and probably rehearsed. They sounded like a bad break-up speech. And maybe that's what they were. Maybe Draco was ending their affair as well as sending him back to England. Maybe he just couldn't bring himself to say so. Not just yet.
Which was just fine with Draco. The less he saw of their partner, the less guilt ate away at him. Especially right after one of these stolen weekends.
Harry's guilt felt comfortable that morning. The puffiness around his eyes and the ache in his tired bones felt quite right. And he was rather determined to stay tucked between the covers for the duration of the day, lost in the memory of the insults he'd thrown.
"Well, yes," Hermione breathed, "but you've cancelled on us two weeks in a row. We didn't think you'd show tonight." She tugged at the front hem of the shirt, biting her lip. "Look, Harry, I was just getting out of the bath and I didn't even have a chance to throw on any knickers. Can you give me just a minute?"
Potter's grin was reminiscent of the Cheshire Cat — slow and knowing with maybe a glimpse of malice. "Derek…. That's right. How could I ever have forgotten?"
After an hour's wait and several pressing memos, they were walking out with a name. It wasn't much, but it was something to go off of. It was much more than Harry had expected to get. And it was something they could definitely launch from.
"Hermione
"I just thought your godfather let you dye your hair," Shea whispered, slightly shocked. These revelations always shocked him. And Draco wished every single time that he would just be used to it all by now.
He felt Draco nod and turn, just barely, to look at him. He must have been satisfied enough in what he saw because he settled back into the exact same spot, even pressing his head back a bit against Harry's fingers. "Don't get used to it. I'll gladly leave the saviour role to you from now on."
The name that fell from Teddy's wobbling lips a mere second later. The name that put almost every unsolvable puzzle piece back together. The name that was likely to throw the world of the person he loved most into complete and total chaos.
Draco finished rearranging the tarts for the third time and stood up, moving to crouch in front of Harry's recliner. His hands were so gentle and so steady as he took Harry's own, momentarily easing the tremors. "She's already here," he pressed. "She's already aware of what type of organization this is. If you don't do the interview now…she'll use her assumptions to make things worse."
right. He bounced back and forth from foot to foot, contemplating his options.
What Harry wanted deep down in a part of himself he rarely acknowledged was to run away. He wanted to do what Draco did – run and never look back. He wanted to start over and remake himself away from expectant eyes. He wanted to live in a happy little blissful world surround by nothing but love. Doing a job he loved and living a life he could be satisfied in.
"Put some mustard on it, it'll be almost as good as the real thing. Right?"
It was unmistakably Andrew McClain's voice. Soft and cool. Unshaken. Unfazed.
Frowning at the way Draco phrased it, Ricardo softened. Just a touch. "Together?"
With a frown, Harry pulled himself up out of bed. His back ached from lying prone for so long and he could feel the mistake of skipping dinner last night. He was starving. "He's already left?" When Teddy nodded again, Harry sighed heavily and pulled off his night shirt. If Draco had already left, he was late. He could only imagine what that could mean as far as the case was concerned. Draco was already probably telling Deacon Harry's theory. Probably taking credit for it, too. "Is somebody going to be home to watch you today?"
Harry laughed abruptly in response.
The worst thing about having a complexion as fair and smooth as alabaster was this right here. He blushed a deep, splotchy red, and there was no hiding his humiliation behind a protest, especially not with that monster of a bonfire roaring to life merely a few feet away. If his outfit wasn't ruined earlier, it certainly would be before the night was over by the lingering smoke and flying ash.
"Fuck me. Harry Potter!"
Sudden recognition lit up the flecks of silver in Draco's eyes. "What kind of barista doesn't know how to make a dry cappuccino?" he uttered, soaked in the same vehemence as that particular day.
"Maybe we could work on it now…." Harry's suggestion was far less than subtle. He was all but throwing himself at his husband. But subtly with Charlie would get him nowhere. It was almost humiliating how upfront he had to be with his husband when making advances.
Victim number fifteen."
"This is weird, right?"
Either way, Harry found himself sympathizing with a man who had been nothing but crass to him. That sounded like a mental illness in itself.
," Harry snapped without intending to. He repeated, softer, "I'm not scared, Hermione. I just feel like maybe I should be?" He sighed, scrubbing a hand over his face, and also fell into a chair near the door. "Long story short, Draco may have some domestic abuse issues in his past."
But a larger part of him was screaming inside that Sharif was the one who seemed wholly uninterested himself. So…fuck him.
Boy was he
Lucky for Harry (but certainly not for Draco), he was desperate to make that important impression whenever they were out in the wizarding community. It didn't matter the occasion or the destination, he was always perfectly civil. He was perfectly opposite of himself. Normally this was something Harry hated to see, but on that night? He was quite happy to take advantage of the serene façade.
"Except, he's going to know that I didn't write any of it," Harry parried. He had been so sure this was what he wanted when he asked his friends for help earlier in the day. But after the warm comradery of the wine faded away, he was left feeling slightly slimy.
For the first couple minutes, they walked in silence. There were about a hundred questions Draco
"Are they listening in? Is our conversation being transcribed?" McClain leaned in and just barely uttered, "Are you still trying to convince Potter and all his followers that you're reformed? You can be honest with me…I won't tell…."
Rolling his eyes, Harry waved half-heartedly towards the door. "Always a pleasure having you around, Ronald."
"I am very proud of you, though," Luna carefully reiterated. His turmoil must have been plainly visible on his face. Was he really as transparent as Hermione said? "If you feel the term 'gay' fits you, then use it. I just want you to know that you don't have to settle for something just because everyone else tells you it's correct. Does any of that make sense?"
"Honestly, it's hardly that scandalous of a topic anymore." Malfoy rolled his eyes and Harry swore he could feel the cheekiness rolling off of him in waves. "Did you know she's married now, cousin Dora?"
Luna, making her dutiful rounds amongst her guests while her new husband was busy building the bonfire, stood beside Draco's table. Well, it wasn't just his, but Harry was already off making conversation with absolutely everyone else, Teddy riding on his shoulders. Since they'd laid claim upon it, Draco had been predictably all alone. He had just emptied the remainder of their table's bottle of elderberry wine into his glass when she showed up. He could only imagine how pathetic he looked from an outsider's point of view.
Harry turned, as well, feeling very much the fly on the proverbial wall. But there was no one behind him. And this woman's eyes were strictly focused right. On. Him. And this wasn't something they had prepared for. And he was most definitely freezing.
Harry was levity and light in a pretty, bearded package. He was perfect.
. Lust for the reassurance of a consistently warm bed. Lust for somewhere to call home. Lust for stability and wholeness.
That being said, I really hope you all enjoy. Please be sure to leave a comment with your thoughts, whatever they may be! Love you all.
"Everything is falling apart around me," Draco whispered. Every single vibration of his voice shook in a way that caused him to blush. He so desperately wanted to be stronger than this. It's all he had ever wanted. "Every
He didn't even know how nervous he should be. He was just lying there in his bed, unmoving. Lifeless and without caution. If anything, he looked relaxed. At ease. Comfortable and safe.
Draco frowned. "All right, but aren't you staying in the opposite direction?" He pointed one way, thought about it a moment, and ended up pointing the other way with a nervous chuckle. "In Diagon?"
Astoria was going to be granted full custody because Draco had a criminal record.
Harry heard the furious clacking of heels long before the rapping on the bedroom door. He heard the fury in every move Narcissa made and every word she breathed. Every foul thing she called them. Every demand and every threat.
"And because you love me," Astoria stated smugly as she turned back to face him. "You would forgive me of murder without even a second thought. Now, come on, you don't have any more time for dramatics; you're going to be late."
magic.
and that was more than he had ever thought would happen.
This was exactly the sort of thing that accentuated Harry being an inexperienced dad. But he supposed every parent felt like that. They all had to learn somehow. Nobody was born just knowing what to do. He sighed heavily, pulling the boy into his arms. The words weren't coming. He had no idea what to say. It was wrong. It was scary. It was…probably a sign of something. He pushed the magenta hair out of the boy's eyes, giving him a stern but sympathetic look. "I want you to sit down at the table. I'll get you some dinner and you can think about what you did. Before we leave, I expect you to apologize to both Rose and your aunt. Do you understand?"
When Harry closed his eyes, all he could see was liquid silver boring into every part of him. Draco's eyes and the way they glazed when he was vulnerable. The small things that made him fall in love in the first place. The velvet of his voice when it was just them and they could be real with one another. The instant feeling of protection he had in the middle of who-knows-where just from the body securely wrapped around him.
"Could you close the computer and help me, then?" Draco said through almost gritted teeth. "Scor needs in his chair and I have to grab the rest of the food."
Harry laughed, short and disbelieving, but nodded.
They had prepared in the last day probably too extensively. Harry knew Malfoy's football stats from his time at that prestigious boarding school in the middle of nowhere Scotland. He knew the names of every single nanny the man had from age two. Hell, he even knew what side of the bed they were both supposed to prefer. What Harry realized they hadn't practiced, however, came when he was least expecting it. Which nearly cost them this entire 'operation'.
Only once he'd closed his eyes did Harry finally feel ready to be out with it. He logged that away for the future, sure the coping mechanism would come in handy when he did this with real people and not just the idea of them. His hands shaking and breathing ragged, he finally whispered, "I like…," his voice dying out when he realized the words didn't feel right. They didn't feel blunt or real enough, even if they were true. They felt evasive.
"You should have invited him for dinner."
He was waiting for this man, Drew, to shift. To change. He was waiting for his demeanor to become violent and less carefree. But he kept a too calm expression and merely stepped back from the door, waving them in. "I've just brewed a pot of coffee, would any of you like some?"
Draco was hesitant to nod, only because he wished he could stay so full for the rest of his life. As cliché as it sounded, they were two puzzle pieces perfectly fitting together. Draco had an emptiness within him. It'd been there so long, he wasn't even sure if he knew what was missing or how to properly fill it now. This here, though? This fullness of Potter inside of him so deep? This was close. This was a substitution for whatever that missing piece might be and he could learn to live with it if given the chance.
With a resigned sigh, he grabbed a sloppy handful of powder and threw it into the waning flames. It took a few long moments to work up the courage, but eventually he worked up the courage to thrust his face into the sparking green and called out Charlie's address in Romania. A head-spinning second later, he was looking into the familiar warmth of his husband's home. His real home.
Harry found he couldn't meet Draco's eyes as they climbed the stairs. All of this felt too real and yet so much like a dream. "It's okay; they'll get over it. I had kind of hoped you would come eventually. Although, I had thought you might use the front door instead…. And maybe a bit sooner, too?"
managed to finish. And I'm super happy with it. So, if you could please please please leave a comment with your thoughts, I would love it! Any small ounce of happiness in these weird times keeps me afloat.
Harry had been instructed to let Draco do the talking. To let him try and smooth things over. After all, Draco knew Deacon best. He knew what angle to play, if there was one needed. But he was itching to say something to defend himself. He was itching to tell Deacon off and let him know just where he could shove his 'mercy'.
"Derek?"
Harry had been to this club once before. Just once. Hermione was trying to show she was supportive when she took him here on their first night in the city. Although, he'd never doubted that she was…. The night hadn't ended well. It was more of an awakening than Harry had really been ready for. Too many slick bodies grinding and grappling. The smell of sex pungent in the air. And, of course, the literal sex itself. Dark corners filled with men on their knees and writhing couples with their hands down one another's trousers.
allowed to still leave the house, you know. I didn't mean to come back so late. Like I said, I ran into someone."
Draco followed, ignoring the jab. "We have records of you accessing Underage Magic Reports at MACUSA Headquarters. Would you like to explain why you're pulling these reports?"
"You?" he finally ground out, thrusting the entwined bouquets forward.
Chuckling, Draco captured Harry in a real kiss. He stole Harry's very breath and stopped his heart with a mere flick of his tongue against teeth. He couldn't stop this even if he wanted to. It was fate and divine circumstance all rolled up with an ounce of luck. It was love and they had been dancing around it for far too long. It was high time they gave that up and finally took what they wanted. Expectations be damned. "We could reconfigure our system," Draco hummed while nipping at Harry's spit-slicked lips. "The more hands the better. It takes a village and all that…."
To further the magic of the evening, the only other light in the room came from candlelight. Candles in filigreed sconces on the walls. Tapers elegantly dripping from the finest crystal candelabras likely ever crafted. Tealights somehow flickering with life beneath the domed foot of every drinking glass set at the table. Even the chandeliers above had been painstakingly lit.
But even that was troubling.
"Why did you do it?"
Another loud bought of laughter brought Harry out of his own head. He looked up from the grass and found Draco watching him from the porch. Harry found a smile for him – he could always find a smile for Draco – and mouthed the words '
"I don't know how it could be both crispy and soggy at the same time?"
With a hollow smile, Potter barely looked up. His head was obviously lost in thought. He was pining and could have possibly been crying. His eyes were furiously red and shining. "I'm good, thanks."
The door opened and closed behind him and Harry breathed heavily, pulling the cigarette from his lips with a sigh. "You're being too harsh, Dray."
Harry panicked. His eyes widened and his cheeks pinked. He couldn't hide it - he'd been caught. (How had Malfoy read his mind?) But as soon as he remembered himself and the actual, out-loud conversation they were having, he quickly looked away while burbling a suspicious laugh. "Is that what the plan is, then? To get me kicked out? Because if that's we want, I could have said something earlier that would have done the trick."
"Got it!"
Harry straightened with violent swiftness, an unreadable expression etched into the wrinkles at his brow. "I-I wasn't talking about…about
"Just tell her I called. Like I promised her I would." Harry paused, then added, "And tell her I'm not off dead in a ditch. Thanks." He hung up before Ron could question further and sunk back into the chair cushions, disappointment weighing at his heart. The only thing that had comforted him for most of the day was knowing he'd be able to off-load everything on Hermione. But now he was going to have to carry all of this into sleep with him.
"What exactly are we trying to make work here?"
The boy cleared his throat and very pointedly kept his gaze in the carton. "Staring at me…." The too-familiar slimy feeling crept into that pit in Teddy's belly. He knew it by heart now. He knew he
No, he
It didn't take long for James to come running. That's what the bell was for, after all. His hair, graying at the sides, was in predictable disarray. His eyes were bugged and full of fleeting fear. Every bit of him looked wild and caught off guard. But Harry only had but a second to take this all in before he was being enveloped in a bone-crushing hug. "Harry," his father sighed in relief.
Draco closed his eyes to both the echo of Harry's voice in his head and the pangs of doubt needling through his thoughts. "There will be a transcription, yes, but I doubt anyone will need to review it. We have enough evidence that we won't need proof of your confession. My job today is really just to get you to give yourself up for the murder charges. Both the Ministry and MACUSA would like to see this wrapped up as cleanly as possible. They want you behind bars, but don't think we should have to waste time in the courts. Either way, you're caught, Mr. McClain. I'm merely here as a courteous formality."
to Shea, he got the same sick feeling in the pit of his stomach. A sick feeling that crept a tinge of bile up his throat. He hated having to explain every little thing to the man. He hated bringing his world into his Muggle escape.
Astoria met his sarcasm with a blank, serious expression. "Yeah, but not just anyone actually managed to make that shit happen, Harry.
The worst part was that Draco knew Potter was being sincere.
house, in particular. He was not expecting to be dropped off in the middle of a Chigwell gated community, right in front of the most classy brick-faced house he'd ever seen. Not a thing was out of place. The garden out front was blooming with superbly maintained rose bushes. The front lawn was well-kempt and the windows were washed and streakless. The privacy shrubbery was expertly sculped and pleasing to look at. In the drive sat what Harry assumed to be a very expensive sports car. He knew nothing about them, but he still knew what he was looking at was a beauty. Not to mention it was detailed to the absolute nines. This was the type of car that exuded class and wealth. It was a clear advertisement to gold-diggers in front of a picturesque dream home. And it was definitely left out on purpose since it was parked right in front of the garage instead of inside.
With a frown, Draco licked his spoon clean before setting it on the counter. He leaned forward, hands braced against the laminate and regarded the uncomfortable way Teddy shrunk into himself. "Doing what again?"
Now, he wouldn't necessarily say his anxiety stemmed from was shame. That wasn't the right word, and for the moment he seemed to be past that confliction. But he was scared. He was nervous. It felt like he had swallowed a bowl full of creepy crawlies.
in whatever way he had you."
Luna giggled from not far off. Harry had been mildly aware of her moving about the garden, giving pep talks to all of her wilting plants, but hadn't realised how close she had drawn since he began. "Want to talk about it?" she offered after he gave her a tight and unconvincing smile.
"Out with it, then," Hermione sighed. She already had that look. She was already judging him. She was already sure that she was going to be right in the end and he would be wrong.
chatty
It was clear Draco didn't think so either. The way he looked at him in that second of consideration showed exactly what he was thinking. The boy was soft. He was gentle. He
They used to joke that we were chained together. We were inseparable. Sometimes it felt like a life sentence.
"That's not what you want to ask," Draco stated plainly, raising one manicured brow and folding his hands over his propped ankle. "This centre is my home and my passion; I have nothing to hide here. Don't hold back on my account."
Draco crossed his arms over his chest, breathing in and out so slowly he might have stopped altogether. "You
"Besides, Harry's waiting on the personals column to find the love of his life for him."
In an awkward, overwhelmed fit, Harry struggled to pull away from Charlie. "Sorry, one moment," he muttered and worked at the knot tying his joggers. The infernal knot that his fingers – trembling with anticipation – just couldn't seem to manage.
"I would like to interview the parents of one of the victims," Harry said quietly when he reentered Deacon's office, a full minute behind Draco. It had taken an additional cigarette to fully gather himself back together. "I have a few questions that weren't in your transcripts."
The sun was just starting to peek in through the windows when Draco gave up on trying to figure anything out. Sleep, problem solving,
Draco Malfoy truly was more beautiful than Harry had ever taken the time to notice before these last few weeks. But it wasn't just because he was flawless and absolutely carved from a slab of perfect marble. There was a lasting beauty in every one of his minor mistakes, too. His wrinkles and freckles and even that one little mole beneath his left eye. Up close, Draco was just as human as Harry felt, which wasn't really a fact he'd ever thought to dispute. But as he found himself comforted by that reassurance, he couldn't deny how he'd been holding Draco on a sort of pedestal.
At least that explained the endless lecture. Draco rolled his eyes, pushing up from his chair like he'd had enough. "Then we'll give you the rest of the night to mull it over," he said coolly back.
"Oh, sweet pea…." Luna frowned, holding the bouquet for a moment before pressing it back into his arms. "I couldn't possibly accept a gift meant for someone else."
This time, the laugh was sharp and grating. Definitely meant as an insult. Feeling the tension come back tenfold, Draco shrunk away from the pressure. "Sorry, I just didn't know that's what I was." The apology was a bit stale. Forced. But true. They had never said what this was, let alone give it such an intense label.
Scrambling up off the sofa, Hermione practically stomped over to the kitchen counter where Harry had left said note the night before. "'
Moral of the story: Don't get caught out in spring on a bank holiday without proper weather protection.
The loud clattering of glass hitting the floor preceded Draco's retaliation as he cleared a spot for himself on the armchair. He settled into it, just perched on the edge, and levelled Harry with a look dripping in thinning patience. "Honestly, Harry, I was expecting more than just those few letters to the editor. It's not worth this much moping."
With only one last fretful half-thought, Harry pushed the door to the office open. He breathed a literal sigh of relief at seeing Draco sitting there behind that desk, a mere few steps away. Before he could hope to contain them, words tumbled off his tongue. "Okay, so, I know you needed my help earlier, but it was entirely unfair of you to leave like that. It's really your fault you were left shorthanded. But none of that matters because I just need to know…did you say 'if' or 'when'? I'm sure I heard 'if', but—"
He was starting to wonder if this wasn't going to be as simple as he had hoped. He was starting to wonder if what he had heard wasn't perhaps the whole truth. If Astoria was this adamant against Draco seeing his own son, what had he done? Was there a more painful reason for the divorce than just that they were unmatched?
date. He was free to leave with anyone he chose. After all, he'd said it himself —
interfere in this quiet sanctum?
This was a dark understatement. There wasn't enough coffee or scones in the world to make their job any easier.
Eyes going round, Harry averted them back to the table. Studying the masterpiece in a cup that he had been unable to produce. "I'm not. I'm part of the unemployed at the moment."
"You like men?" the voice demanded.
This wasn't how Harry wanted to be seen throughout MACUSA Headquarters. Brittle, eyes rounded, and Draco Malfoy's hand in a potentially compromising position. But Draco wasn't actually leaving him much of a choice. And neither was the unsteady exhaustion hanging in every single one of his muscles. "You're fueling the wrong kind of attention," Harry warned, tempted by but not fully committed to pulling away. "I can manage. I'm not fragile. I won't break. You could let me go. I promise not to faint."
He talked himself out of the idea as soon as it crossed his mind. For one, the chair was very comfortable, likely from lack of use, but it simply wouldn't do for sleeping due to the partition between the cushions. Besides, the bed in Malfoy's room was plenty big enough to accommodate two strangers and still leave space between them. He could manage for a simple week, especially on that heavenly mattress.
"Y'alright, Moony?"

Harry's throat clenched, floored for a moment by the earnest tone to Draco's words. "I mean…you guys do a weekly brunch, so what choice do I have but to stick around?"
, Harry."
him, for one more second. "You'll get there," Harry tried to reassure, but his heart wasn't in it. "Look, Hermione, I just need to tell someone about this so I...," he trailed off, not exactly knowing what it was he wanted here. He just needed to say it out loud so he could gauge someone else's reaction. So he could see if he should be more worried about it all than he truly felt deep down.
With an impatient sigh, Rudy trained his dark gaze on Harry. Attempting to burn a hole right through him. "No."
Over the next few hours, the three of them workshopped the hell out of Harry's love note. By the time Ron arrived home, haggard from a long day of battling holiday shoppers, the words Harry had initially written were practically non-existent beneath all of the revisions. But even he couldn't deny what they'd come up with as a collective was much more beautiful than anything he could have dreamt of on his own.
It was probably coming any moment now.
Delphini sighed heavily and literally rolled her eyes back in his direction. "Why?"
It felt like too much pressure and Draco was certain he couldn't ever live up to its standard. No matter what he did.
Harry had a toothbrush by the bathroom sink, as well. It was green – an intentional choice made by Draco. The green of the man's eyes was ingrained behind his own closed lids like a permanent background to his everyday thoughts. The bristles of the brush were fanning out, flattening from vigilant use. At first Draco had found it insulting that Harry would always go for the toothbrush after they'd been intimate. It felt like he was trying to scrub clean some sort of dirty feeling Draco left within him. But the longer time stretched on and the more he saw the ritual, the more comfort it instilled within him personally. He would lie back in his bed, fresh with their mingled musk, watching it unfold through the open door while his mouth watered for the minty kiss that would soon follow when Harry climbed back in beside him. Nuzzling into him like there was nowhere else he would rather be.
He loved everything about the life they had built together.
For a brief instance, Harry felt Draco's hands nearly pull away from his. "What does that mean?" he snapped, that patience wearing thin enough to show his former self beneath it. Which satisfied Harry much more than he would ever admit to.
could have you…."
Although he felt like he could make no promises, Draco nodded encouragingly. He could make amends later if necessary. All that mattered right now was the name.
Straightening, Harry walked closer to Draco. Examined him because he
The life plan was officially amended the day Ronald Weasley literally crashed into their life. Ron lived up just one floor above them – literally right above. And he was loud. His footsteps were heavy, his television was always five notches too high, and when they first met him he had a girlfriend who could scream down a house. Three points Hermione wasted no time in yelling in his face after she banged down his door a mere week after they'd moved in. By that point, the girlfriend had finally screamed herself into being an ex and a just a few, short months later, she and
safe at home in his bed or….
With yet another sigh, she rested her head on Harry's shoulder. "The whole thing…Bill and Charlie…. I don't think he knows how to handle it. I don't think any of them do. Arthur and Molly are shell-shocked. Percy won't return letters. Ginny…Ginny's just as angry as Ron is. But those two?" Hermione cocked her head towards Ron and George who were caught up in a fit of hysterical laughter. "They're trying to find solace in the bottom of a bottle. And I don't know how to fix him…."
someone to help you with this case. Someone who does field work. But I don't do that, myself. I sit here. I go to meetings. And, occasionally, I do an interview or two. For that, I just have to go down the hall a few doors. That's it."
With a sigh to cover his doubts, Harry stood and pulled Hermione from her daze. Literally. He grabbed ahold of her hands, jerking her towards him and into a crushing, swaying hug. "It's just acting," he said gently in her ear, her frantic breaths filling his own. "It's just one week of free reign to annoy the smug, well-to-dos on their own dime."
"I've built a lot of my life around you and Astoria," Shea whispered, his voice cracking and betraying the sobs he was trying to hold back. "And I've never
. He was so good at concealing his emotions and it simply wasn't fair.
"Where do you keep going?"
Astoria tilted her head to the side and finally relinquished Harry's hand. It fell limp and heavy to his side. "We own it all. The building, the organization, every bit of it. We even live just above." She paused, frowning. "For now. Is that why you're here, then? I must admit, I can't imagine who could've told you about our situation, but I won't question the help."
Harry matched Draco's motions stroke-for-stroke as best he could while his head was filled with so much haze. It felt like he was working Draco over in a dream, his encouraging noises sounding so far off through the rush of blood in his ears. For all the waiting and anxiety over what might be expected of him and what it would feel like, Harry felt almost silly. If Draco's moans and the little bucks of his hips were any indication at all, he wasn't even doing a half-bad job. It was like getting himself off, still half-immersed in a pleasant dream, except the smooth glide of Draco's hand felt far better than anything he could have ever imagined and it just…
Something between venom and plea laced Draco's words. "A lot of innocent lives depend on this. I know that means something to you." The words 'Saint Potter' were miraculously left off the end. Harry chocked that up to an immense use of restraint. Draco loved to throw those words around.
"We go on foot from here."
As if reading Teddy's mind, James smiled back while squaring said shoulders. “It's eating you up inside, isn’t it?”
He was sure he at least knew it began two years ago. The war had just ended and since fighting was all Harry knew, he found himself lost in a world which suddenly wanted him to finally be happy and normal. He was still with Ginny back then, mostly because she was all he knew. She felt safe and comfortable. But she wasn't the one and he was glad she had been the one to realise it for him. He never would have let her go otherwise.
Through the pain and the labour, he was able to finally put his thoughts into a semblance of order by way of a list.
as Draco's partner to
"Actually…." Underneath his practiced composure, Draco looked guilty. A look Harry had trained himself to recognize back when the man was always on the cusp of leaving. "He was here for a bit. But your brother-in-law - uh, the one Greyback mauled…Bill? – came for him not long ago." Harry opened his mouth, face contorted with confused anger to question but was gently cut off. "I had sent an owl to your husband. Apparently he's busy with work and sent Bill in his stead. So he's at home - your home – waiting for you.
To keep that mask in place, Harry sat in Deacon's office with his arms crossed and his expression unmoving. Every bit that perfect picture. Draco was at his side, also wearing a convincing façade. They had both decided that it would be best to present a united front. An unrepentant united front.
"Or have you been fucking him? I never did get the logistics of your relationship."
Draco. Or, more realistically, Luna loved trying to solve him like a puzzle.)In that moment, though, he needed a harsh dose of reality. He needed her to bring out that 'I told you so' and smack him in the face with it.
Patient as a waiting leopard, Draco slowly leaned in and whispered, "The way you react to the question helps me to determine if I'm going to end up getting attacked after leaving here today. You're not doing much to put me at ease, you know…."
But that outside façade did nothing to quell his churning stomach as Draco made his way down the hall. His hands shook, so he shoved them in his pockets. His heart pounded faster than was healthy and his breathing was rough and ragged. He was a mess. He was falling apart.
He hadn't ever told anyone.
Swallowing the rejection like a bitter pill, Theo allowed himself one more shot. If Potter turned him down again, he would walk away and try to put this mess he'd created behind him. "I'm the one who put your boyfriend in prison. Buying you a beer to drown your sorrows in is the least I could do."
Slowly, like the doubts might sink their grip in tighter if he was more violent, Draco shook the idea from his head. Even if Harry was still interested in her, it was his business alone. He'd made it very clear they weren't on a
"It's nothing. Harry's just being a bit stubborn…."
Harry shook his head. "Hasn't even looked my way. And he's avoiding Teddy's room, too. Were you able to talk to him about it?"
But not just any human being. The one human being who was almost the antithesis of Draco in that he had saved just as many lives as Draco had likely tried to destroy.
The air went quiet and still Harry couldn't meet Hermione's eyes. He could just
pastry…."
Raising his brow, Draco glanced up from his papers. "I find that hard to believe," he sneered, making a show of looking Harry over head to toe.
A nearly-hysterical laugh burbled unchecked out of Harry's throat and he willingly slumped into the offered seat. "Is there really a positive way to take that?"
"Did someone Obliviate you?" Draco started carefully, no longer capable of looking the boy in the eye. "Do you know? Do you remember?"
Sharif was on his feet in a heartbeat, forcing a smile through his hurt and anger. "At least nobody can say we didn't give it a shot."
With a dramatic sigh, she waved him inside. "'e can be
The moment to follow felt inevitable. It felt like Harry was finally able to grasp a full breath of air. It felt perfect and like a fairy tale and all of those cliché's, even with Draco muttering something about Harry being a disgrace to all Gryffindors against his lips. Which, really, just didn't matter because Draco was
Slight bemusement gracing his features, Draco caught back up with him. It was far too easy for them to fall into old habits. So easy that Draco found it took every ounce of strength he had not to reach out and link their fingers. "Our office is on the twelfth floor," he explained. It was better to stick with the old habits that didn't leave him broken a second later. "If you want a tour, some secretary can give you one later. I don't have the time nor the desire to walk you around entire building. And Merlin knows many of them really could use something productive to do with their time."
This was what it felt like to be Draco Malfoy. It felt powerful. It felt life-changing. It felt like everything he had done before didn't matter. Nothing up until this point right here mattered. The only thing that mattered was that Harry Bloody Potter, Saint of Saints, thought he was worthy of kissing. Everything he had done and thought was redeemed in that instant, as ridiculous as that seemed.
Hermione sighed for likely the hundredth time, stuck in a permanent wincing position. "Has he said anything to you yet?"
Somewhere along the way, Harry had become an expert at recognising these signs of the man's fissuring psyche while two, five, ten drinks deep. In his current state, it was almost too easy to note Draco's hesitation. Were he sober, it was entirely possible he might not have even known how to. The drink in his belly felt like a blessed curse.
In the end, nothing was amiss except for the stunning sight of a man battling with his own emotions over in the corner.
Not when he didn't know anything himself. Not with the reporters buzzing around like vultures every chance they could slip past a nurse. Not with the nerves and anger dancing between Charlie and himself.
way."
"Come dance with me," was all Harry had to whisper to get Draco off his stool.
Harry, not knowing how to respond, sat back in his chair and bobbed his head up and down like it was on a spring. A mechanical action, something to do while he processed all of that confliction and confusion within.
it. Especially not with that smug bastard sitting so perfectly still across the room from him, soaking up sage bits of wisdom from his small group of senior citizens — otherwise known as Embers.
"It looks just like the one by your place," Draco remarked as they sat, looking around in soft awe.
"Came into some money?" Hermione shifted beside him. She was clearly struggling between concern and her need to
Harry was just coming out of his temporary room when Draco rounded the stairs. Their eyes met in that moment, but only for that brief second. They both pointedly looked away, an awkwardness keeping them a good distance apart. "We should get going," Draco said gently. "If you're ready, that is."
"Honestly, you're just lucky our contract didn't have dangerous repercussions. Most of them do, you see. Most of them are drafted with a death and dismemberment clause. I asked that to be left out of your contract. You see, I thought I wouldn't need it. I thought you might actually live up to your name."
Draco never wanted to blend in.
And then the Patrol showed up at their door. The sun had just begun to rise, while they had not. One of them, Harry forgot which, had declared it to be a day of rest. A day where neither of them left the bed but for food and to relieve themselves. It had likely been Draco's suggestion. He had to have known they were coming.
"Anything…," Draco said, knowing he meant it with every fiber of his being.
It was too much.
"Ready?"
. Threatening whistleblowers with dark magic while Harry was pulling a long shift at St. Mungo's.
And here it is! The final chapter. Maybe. I think. There might be one in the future, I don't know yet. But for now I'm considering this story wrapped, even if it is a bit of a shattered ending. Thanks so much for reading and please leave a comment with your thoughts!
There Draco Malfoy stood in all of his real and physical glory, mocking Harry's beginner of a boner with that annoyed little look of his. It took every ounce of restraint in Harry's body not to groan and slam the door shut on his gorgeous fucking face.
"Can I buy you a fresh drink? Or did you want to stare at that one a bit longer?"
But if he never left home again, he could continue to live in ignorant bliss. He wouldn't have to know how many people had written him off. He wouldn't have to see the Equality Centre targeted with an increase of hate. He wouldn't have to know he had let Draco and Astoria down if their plan backfired. If he just stayed shut away forever, everything could continue to be as it was because nothing would change.
One thing at a time.
flat, mate."
From the instant he took the outstretched envelope, James' eyes were wide and full of alarm. If he was jokingly concerned before, it was real now. "Harry…," he whispered after barely peeking inside. "Where did you get this?" His breath was shaking, but not nearly as badly as his hands. Harry had only seen him this scared just once before.
Before he could process how to hold it back, a sharp noise of amusement blasted out from Harry's own throat. His eyes flicked back and forth between both of them like he was watching a tennis match. Waiting to see who broke first — calm, cool, collected Draco or Rita whose paled complexion now rivalled that of any alabaster Malfoy.
Harry paused a moment, eyes slightly narrowed, before nodding resolutely and continuing through the house. "Well, I think we were ready to leave." He stopped at the end of the hall, turning the knob to the backdoor. "I told Teddy to wait outside with Tater."
With a harsh wand wave and a sharp squeak, Draco found his mouth moving without being able to say a word. He clutched his throat before looking at Deacon incredulously. He managed a nonverbal spell of his own, causing every single paper to fly right out of the man's briefcase. "That is incredibly professional, Mr. Malfoy!" he shouted as the other stalked out of the office in a huff.
For a moment, Draco could almost believe things were back to how they used to be. He could almost pretend that being in this bar with this man was a purposeful act. It was a deluded thought, but once it was nestled into his alcohol-softened brain, he found himself smiling and succumbing to the fantasy. "Why don't you have a seat?" he said gently, scooting the barstool beside him out with his foot. "I'll buy you a drink and maybe we can test those out together. Just like old times?"
The boy nodded. "Yeah, Uncle Draco made me oatmeal before he left for work."
For Harry, their friendship was starting to mean something more, and he held out hope that Draco felt the same way. Hence the reason for the stupid mistletoe and his stalking Draco on the Map with much the same level of obsession as in their sixth year. He wanted to make a grand gesture because he couldn't fathom just being out with it like a flippant revelation. The potential of this meant far too much.
The worst he could say was no….
Rita nodded, looking a bit taken aback at his restraint. "Perfect. Should we get started, then?"
"Two," Harry said quickly and practically slammed himself back into his seat. "Only two. Are you going to tell me how many you've slept with? To quiet
That night had been reminiscent of a dream. No, that wasn't the correct word choice. It
In no position to argue, Harry nodded obediently. He stopped for only a moment in the doorway on his way out to say clearly and plainly, "I still love you." It was important for Draco to know that nothing had changed between them.
, his abs — and turned his attention back to the safety of the stars.
"It's orange," Sharif supplied, just barely looking up through those thick lashes. "If that was, in fact, you asking."
"For your information, the dancers at my clubs are required to at least wear briefs. We do have
A flare of panic crippled Draco just as he felt the passion within him begin to crest, effectively wiping it away for the moment. He'd had plenty of orgasms, chasing them like they might be the answer to whatever his parents and the war had fucked up within him. He knew what it was like to reach a peak and then crash over the edge. This didn't feel like that. It didn't feel like anything he had ever experienced. It hit him like a freight train, square in the chest, knocking all thought of breath from his mind. He could have subsisted on this feeling alone for the rest of his life.
"So…," Harry started when Malfoy stood to start another pot of coffee. They'd already run through the previous one and were still growing weary. "Why are you doing this?"
Oof, this is a rather short chapter.... Sorry, but I do like where it ended. Please enjoy and be sure to leave a review with what you're thinking!!
"I'm just trying to understand your mindset," Draco countered, not sure anymore if he wanted this conversation to end. Not yet. He didn't have all his answers. "You tried to kill my cousin. That makes me a bit reticent towards your cause."
No situation Harry turned over in his head could explain why this pair was standing in his office. He opened and closed his mouth several times, like a fish out of water. In the meantime, Draco shuffled his feet and tried not to meet his gaze. He didn't appear to like the idea of being here, either.
The tension around them shifted again. It seemed to always be shifting these days. Roaming between heavy and hot to prickly and uncomfortable in a chaotic loop. "I know," Draco mumbled, stepping away quickly. Like he had finally come to his senses again. Harry couldn't help but to feel just a bit lighter when Draco settled into his seat across from him. The solid wood between them. Boundaries set just as they should be. Their roles just as they should be. Draco feeling sorry for himself, a deep self-hatred written in every single restrained limb. Harry trying to be the more put-together party, putting on the brave face of a well-trained poster boy.
He would have been dead. Out of their lives forever.
The living room looked like a war zone. But their bedroom definitely had it worse. The mattress was completely askew and most of the clothing they owned was now on the floor. Harry stepped on a tossed book in the doorway and winced when he heard the spine crack. He lifted his foot to peek at the title before slamming it down again with more force. He couldn't exhibit his anger on Draco so he would have to settle for taking it out on his things for now. Starting with the flowery book of poetry he cherished more than any human he'd ever known. Harry included.
Shaking off the little bit of blue inside the eyes of Draco Fucking Malfoy. Shaking off the way that made him feel.
"And I looked
Of course, no one was going to let it go that easily. Daphne abandoned her studies, throwing her books onto the floor with a loud
"I suppose not, just—"
A less-than-kind remark about Ron's level of interest in the guy very nearly flew past Harry's lips. Right before he opened his mouth, though, Hermione placed a hand on both their arms and said gently, "This man's not worth fighting over, boys. Harry's already said he's not interested. Let's leave it at that."
Teddy had no way of telling what time it was when the door to their room creaked open. Fearing the worst, he slammed his eyes shut and tried to even out his breathing. Pretending he was asleep. Hoping that could be the end of it. Foolish enough to believe that would stop the man engrossed in shadow in the doorway. On nothing more than a whisper, Draco called out to Teddy several times. He was considerate and quiet, but it was sure to eventually wake Harry. And it was out of protection for his godfather that he finally gave in. He blinked blearily in the dark, watching Draco beckon for him with a crook of his finger.
Unable to stop himself, a sharp laugh burbled up from Harry's throat. "Jesus, fuck, Hermione! I really was visiting my parents." He sank into the spot on the couch she had recently vacated. It was a different kind of home than the one he'd grown up in. Their apartment smelt like Hermione's hair gel and had the kind of comforting warmth his parents' house never did these days. He loved both places, but sometimes it did feel good to escape to a place he could call his own.
The black behind Harry's lids darkened further, if that were possible. Like all connection to the world was suddenly and violently severed. He had no idea what he stumbled back into, but it felt solid and he embraced that. Everything else was spinning and the reassurance of it was grounding.
Harry frowned, glancing up at Rosetta for a moment, before whispering back, "When did she pass?"
"Everything," Harry muttered before clearing his throat and continuing with more confidence. "That's all I wanted from you seven years ago and all I still want today. But I have a lot to think about now. I'm not sure anymore who I can trust. I couldn't even…. I couldn't trust my own husband, so what am I to do with the guy who broke my heart before he did? How do I trust someone who I know cheated on his boyfriend on a consistent basis?"
By putting Teddy into direct harm's way.
But he didn't look horrified (not yet) and Draco was taking that as a good sign (for now).
But he wasn't performing his
It was safe to say dinner with Hermione had shaken Harry a bit. He'd been so confident walking in, but when he left…. Well, he just didn't feel like the same person. Her foreboding statement lingered heavy in his head, clouding and drowning out literally anything else.
Hermione, on the other hand, had a solid and immovable plan for her life and her future before they were even out of nappies. She never once wavered from it – top of their class all throughout school, internships with the right people at the right places, full immersion into adulthood just after graduation (skipping university - don't get her started on that waste of time). The culmination was something big, but she was going to allow time to work out the specifics on that one.
And panicked. Very, very panicked.
"Ron, not now," Hermione scolded, grabbing the soup pot and setting it heavily upon the table. "Dinner is ready; I'll go grab the children."
To fill him in the way he so desperately craved.
Harry walked himself down to Charing Cross Road fully sure he was capable of handling the Sparks meeting alone. But the closer he came, the more dread started to weigh down his footsteps. He'd never considered himself to be a particularly brave person, even though he'd held the unofficial title as the Gryffindor Golden Boy. The way he saw it, that came down to reputation more than skill and was hardly something he had earned. Sure, he'd done some very bold things for the right side of the war. But he'd only been a child and, looking back at it all, he really hadn't been given much of a choice in most of his decisions. Recklessness and a sense of duty weren't exactly the same thing as unabashed courage.
Harry was the absolute rock under pressure. He had saved their entire world time and time again all before even the thought of adulthood had crested. Harry was brave and didn't overthink. He did what needed to be done. Like in that moment when Draco was failing and frozen with fear. Harry didn't falter or hesitate. He was at the boy's side, cradling his head in his lap. Brushing the shocking pink locks from his face. Wiping a new sheen of sweat from his forehead and biting back tears. He was shouting for answers. He was trying to shake Draco out of his reverie, demanding answers. Holding his boy close.
to do and asked that we stay up here until the time comes. God forbid his colleagues…." He trailed off. "It would just be better if we stayed up here and planned for tonight."
Right?
"I should say - it's his tradition for the ones he's trying to fuck."
"No," Draco stated, surveying the contents of the kitchen cabinets. "Murder would be a violent way of putting it."
"But the two of you seem…at least companionable," Harry said, trying to parse out just what Draco was insinuating.
Finally, Harry sighed and planted himself squarely in front of Draco. With no idea what he was about to say, he opened his mouth and decided to let it just happen because he truly couldn't stall any longer under that pregnant expectancy. "You do want to, er…. You do want that, right? To…to
As soon as the location registered, Harry fumbled out, "Oh, but I don't go to the gay clubs," but he was only speaking to dead air.
"But you're not interested." Sharif actually looked crestfallen, and a slimy feeling slid into Draco's belly. He readily blamed it on the gin.
"Guess you'll have to sack me, as well," Harry joked, coming across far tenser than he had desired. There was no ease to his presence here. There was no ease in showing up on this man's doorstep at an unthinkable hour. There was no ease to leaving Teddy in a stranger's house while he was off investigating deaths of boys his age. There was no ease to standing across a room from Draco Malfoy, only able to daydream about the things he wanted to do to him.
He was happy. He was alive. He was holding the hand of the man he loved and nothing could go wrong.
"I dabbled with the idea of poison, but without the antidote it seemed ridiculous."
Rolling his eyes, Draco made short work of redressing. "It's not like you were good at keeping that a secret."
He would have strayed eventually whether Draco intervened or not. It was inevitable. Draco merely sped up the process to get him out of the way. As a courtesy just as much as for selfish gain.
Draco raised a brow, most likely in shock as his lips parted for just an unguarded second. He didn't respond, but simply scribbled a note on his legal pad with a platinum green fountain pen. "You say you quit? Where are you working now?"
Harry cleared his throat and averted his eyes. "Sorry to hear that," he muttered awkwardly to the floor.
Cutting through this tension with a simple clear of his throat, Malfoy sat himself down right beside Harry. Closer than uncomfortably close. He fielded out the drinks in his hands. The most perfect Cosmopolitan Harry had ever seen, of course, went to Narcissa. And she downed nearly the entire glass in one gulp. Watching this, Harry accepted his own drink – a simple bottle of beer – while he watched Draco drink from what appeared to be a gin and tonic. "Thank you, love," he dutifully muttered and hoped he wasn't betrayed by a blush.
Even after nearly a year, Ron still had yet to master the art of referring to Harry's sexuality without sounding completely nervous. He acted like if he were to say the word 'gay', the world might just burst into flames around him. Harry had actually yet to hear him use that particular word, thus far. Which meant Harry just had to try and use it as often as he possibly could. "Gay men? Do you mean to ask if the gays write lonely hearts ads? Yeah, mate. Yeah, we do. We're normal and human just like you straight guys. We get lonely just like you. Shocker, yeah?"
For a long, tense moment, all Harry could hear was a muffled voice talking through too many walls. He froze, his hand on the door handle, hoping that whoever had chosen to visit him would be satisfied in his still being asleep and leave. That they wouldn't take a peek in the bedroom first. That they would allow him his peace and simply go.
because Draco was giving him everything he needed just by existing within the same space as him.
Harry turned to Luna beside him, questioning look on his face. She literally chewed over her input for a moment before gently saying, "If what we wrote together isn't in your heart, Harry, then he might know it didn't come solely from you."
No matter what happened, that guilt would surely eat him alive. Teddy had already been through so much in his little life. And here Draco was…piling more strife right on top of his still unsolved problems.
"That's alright," Draco whispered, following Astoria into the house. She disappeared up the stairs and he settled Scorpius in his high chair. "We don't need Mumma. We don't need Papa, neither. We're fine on our own, aren't we?" The boy grinned, his grey eyes shining with mischief. "Exactly. We got this. We're going to get you some lunch and then we'll grab a nap."
Harry stopped in front of the bonfire, far enough away from his friends to keep their conversation between them for a moment longer. "Nothing wrong with delicate or feminine for anyone. Nothing at all." As if to prove a point, he reached up to gently trace the jut of Draco's cheek. His features had filled out as an adult, guided by more consistent eating habits and general contentment, and he suddenly felt self-conscious. He tilted his head away and wondered inwardly just how inebriated Harry might be himself.
He swallowed, his throat thick with fear even despite his relaxed inhibitions. He could have easily answered with just one word. And, according to Luna, all it would have taken for Harry to understand were real, tangible words. If he could manage the conviction, his feelings would finally be obvious enough for Harry to either embrace or reject. It was so simple. It was so easy.
ed his forehead down on the counter with his arms curled around his head and groaned.
Harry knew he shouldn't ask, but he couldn't help it. The question was eating its way up his throat before he could try and stop it — "What did they do?"
"I hope so. I'm ready for this to be over and done with," Draco grumbled. He threw the paper across his desk, relaxing back in his chair. "I'm ready for things to return to normal."
DeWitt drew his wand with a sigh and motioned Harry closer. "We'll let the test decide that, won't we?"
Leaving him to the wolves, who descended the instant they could no longer hear his footsteps.
Like he was sure that was going to be the answer, Malfoy flipped open the folder. "There's really no good place to start...," he mused as he dragged a fingertip down a detailed checklist. "Middle name?"
"Morning, Mr. Malfoy!"
relationship."
It took every ounce of concentration Draco had at that point not to sneer back at him. He calmly reached for his glass, sipped the last bit of liquid, and stood. Calm as those dangerous moments before a storm.
"Daddy stays outside," Scorpius stated, matter-of-fact. Not only did he look the spitting image of Draco – except for his hair, which hung around his face in adorable curls Draco could never pull off – but it seemed he had also inherited that plain way of speaking Harry went starking mad for.
Potter followed Draco with a grin too wide to conceal, throwing down more than enough Galleons to cover both of their drinks for the night. He was excited, his hands settling on Draco's hips before they were even out the door. "Yours or mine?" he whispered once they were outside. His breath tickled the back of Draco's neck, a reaction which seemed to excite him evident by the way he chuckled and pressed kisses along Draco's hairline.
Harry frowned and pushed the door open further, putting the chairs on the other side of the desk in perfect view. And sitting right there in one of them was none other than Kingsley Shacklebolt, the fucking Minister for Magic himself. Because, of
Just outside the door, dogs were barking and clawing at wood. Draco refused to take his eyes off the scared look burned into his retinas. Or the vial of poison held like a looming threat, inching closer and closer to Teddy's lips. His wand danced between his fingers, ready to strike. But he couldn't act rashly without putting Teddy into further danger. They were stuck in this uncomfortable limbo until McClain chose to act.
"Draco?" Harry waited for the other man's nod before continuing. "Draco, I didn't mean to suggest anything by it, I'm just…." What was he, exactly? Shocked to find Draco Malfoy (yes, of all people) in a place he thought he would feel alone? Confused why a seemingly straight man would be so wholly passionate about such a place? Afraid, disbelieving, relieved? "Look," he finally said, giving up on putting his mixed emotions into words, "can we just start over?"
Three men of different ages had been cut completely out of their families' lives after coming out. One had barely lived through a suicide attempt, one painfully admitted he needed to stay at the centre another night because he had nowhere else to go, and one has been barred from seeing his daughter who he described as a literal piece of his heart.
, Potter, what do you
Most especially not the girl, Ginevra.
But all Harry did was look at him for a long moment before turning on his heel. He didn't even look at Draco when he spat, "I
But that was easier said than done. The words weighed heavy on his tongue, a burden he wished to offload, but it just wasn't that simple. As much as it honestly should have been.
and I," he paused, winking over at Harry and effectively stalling his progress of recovery, "were simply having a discussion, my dear wife. But I think we're settled for now, right?"
The result was far less than sweet or graceful. In his haste, Harry tripped over his own feet and stumbled head first into the wall just inside the entrance.
"So some kids just don't…make the cut?"
"Oi, Draco!" Q yelled, turned to the backside of the café. Harry peered around the stand to the corner. A man with the blondest hair Harry had ever seen looked up, tucking a pen behind his ear. "Ready for another one?" The blond nodded and made a beckoning motion, hardly even glancing at Harry. "Go on over," Q said gently, chuckling under his breath. "And good luck."
"I took him there. To our place. To our little forest. I don't know why. He was freaking out over our case and…I didn't know what else to do. I didn't know where else to go. I needed him to calm down and I couldn't think of any place more peaceful. And I…." Draco sighed. "I fucked up. Once he was there…he tainted it. He tainted that place."
He was unmatched against this entire family and suddenly filled with a deep desire to be with his own parents. He certainly didn't tell them enough how much he appreciated the kind of people they were.
"Well, what is it that I can help with, then? And what does that have to do with the famous Harry Potter?"
They wanted the boy they knew before the war to suddenly wake up in his bed, whole and unscarred.
That was the biggest frustration of all.
"Auror Potter and I have a few things to discuss. Could you keep Rose busy for a bit?" Hermione asked. Her voice was strained – she wasn't shy about how difficult it was for her to allow anyone else to take care of her children. Allowing Molly to watch the infant, Hugo, during the day was degrading enough for her.
"Oh, you brought them flowers." Draco felt his heart skip a beat— "That's really thoughtful of you. Neville will love them." —and then stop. Harry turned away from him and beckoned, walking down the hallway just as Draco opened his mouth to protest, deflating his confidence further with every step. "Thanks, by the way, for agreeing to be my 'date'—" he actually, physically used air quotes "—to their wedding. I had every intention of going out there to find someone to bring, but by the time I remembered…. Well, it was too late. I didn't want to just take anyone. And Luna would never let me live it down if I showed up alone. She's convinced I don't spend enough time these days with 'other adults'. And, well, Teddy was excited by the idea of you coming with us."
Outside Harry's window, draped likely from the flat above his own, was a flag. A rainbow flag, to be precise. Its six colours perfectly covered the glass, broadcasting them across every inch of his bedroom like a filter had been placed directly over the sun. He ran his fingers over his usually white sheets, thick red and orange stripes coating his skin as he processed the slow formation of his full understanding. A frown steadily replaced the smile on his lips, accompanied by a long-suffering sigh.
"I just want Draco home, Hermione," Harry whispered. Finally, he raised his eyes and met her probing look. "He's innocent. This proves that, doesn't it?"
With a wink, Harry threw a hand up over his heart like he'd been scared again. "Go on," he whispered.
Hermione nodded, just once, but remained otherwise closed off.
is falling apart around me." There wasn't a single stable person in his life. Not really. Shea was probably the most put-together of them all. But even he was teetering after last night. His presence at Draco's side in that moment didn't change this. It didn't change the strain between them.
Not that he didn't already feel that way, anyway.
'," she completed before snorting a laugh. "See, Harry thinks they're romantic. And, sometimes, I will agree there can be a couple. But mostly…I think you've really got to be at your end to submit an ad."
Harry nodded slowly and found where his luggage had been placed in a corner of the bedroom. He was nearly ashamed of the relief which lightened his footsteps. "Can I at least know what I've done wrong?"
It was easier not to fall prey to the hope which flourishes in that moment between asleep and awake. When everything seems so vivid and so real. When Draco could still feel the kindest lips upon his own. When the words clogging his mind were only his own pathetic fantasy.
"Until today. Why the
Harry wasn't even aware of his white-knuckled grip on the chair until Draco gently touched his hands. He was kneeling on the seat of the chair, looking so gentle and soft as he gazed up at Harry's panicked expression. He looked like something Harry could easily cave into — patient and inviting, even despite fearing the words which might fall from his lips.
in their smug faces. But that was likely to get him thrown out on his ass – surely that crossed a line – so he swallowed it and made himself more comfortable by bringing his feet up under him. Smearing whatever was on his diary trainers into that likely priceless sofa while only registering mild thrill in it. "I can't be bought," he lied, making sure he met Abraxas' yellowing eyes when he said it. "And how would Draco feel to know you tried to buy me?"
"Shouldn't it be?" Harry countered, blowing a heavy breath of smoke out into the smog-riddled New York air.
"…'arry?"
Frowning, Lily finished sitting up and leaned in closer. Her fingers, cold as ice, traced over the rest of his face. Caressing the skin, only the barest hint of recognition crossing over her. They lingered in the end upon his round-frame glasses. James hadn't ever needed to wear glasses – another small detail that set them apart. "Harry…." The name sounded foreign on her tongue and it was then that Harry had to admit defeat.
"You're a wizard," Harry whispered, his brow furrowed.
"Ah, Mr. Potter! Such a pleasure to meet you, at last!"
Their wedding night, a random rainy Tuesday two years ago, and the day that Teddy nearly died.
." Her voice steadily rose in pitch, eventually ending in a bit of a shriek. To accompany it, she was once again on her feet. Pacing. Fretting.
It wasn't a smooth way to start, but that was pretty much the goal. Theo wanted to be everything Draco wasn't. And Draco was undoubtedly a smooth-talker.
Shrugging, Harry made to stand, slapping the dirt from the knees of his jeans. "I'm just trying to puzzle through…something," he said vaguely.
"I love you, Harry. For now just think about that."
. But that was as far as they went. As much as he felt them and wanted to see this man dead, he couldn't force them past his teeth. That curse didn't bring closure. It brought swift and irreversible revenge. All of the grieving parents deserved much more than that.
Draco smiled sadly leaned in just a bit closer. "Teddy, when I left…. Merlin, you were so young. I hate that I left you when you were that young. I hate what that must have done to you. My decision to leave did not just affect me or your godfather, I know that. And for that I'm sorry. So…I'm sorry if I was making you uncomfortable…but I feel like I've missed a lot. I feel like whenever I get to see you, it's never enough. So…I'm sorry, again, but I was just taking advantage of a stolen moment. I was merely recounting all of the time I lost with you. Seeing how much you've grown and changed. Thinking about how much I've missed."
He looked like an absolute mess by the time Harry rolled into the office. His door was open so he saw him the instant he walked in. He was oblivious. There was no way he could have known what it was he was walking into. It was pointless to warn him ahead of time. So he waltzed through that door looking like an absolute ray of sunshine and it was so frustrating. Like they were back in school and Harry Bloody Potter was walking around the grounds with a smile even though his life was constantly falling apart.
Wearing a grin as big as ever, Deacon strolled in and made a show of clapping his hands together. "Alright, boys, a new assistant has been hired. Her name is Lexi. Be nice to her. And don't fucking fire her." He gave Draco a pointed look to which he received the most dramatic eye roll.
"Daph's not entirely wrong," Blaise agreed without looking up. "Draco's wound tighter than a goblin's purse strings. A little surprise snog could probably do him some good."
their well-bred and perfect son. A thought that only managed to spin Harry even closer to a breaking point. Especially since once he'd thought it, it was all he could imagine as well. Malfoy – naked and pale and spread out over the armrest of that life-changing chaise lounge. Begging in a way he'd never had to before.
A final chance to settle down into the arms of the one he was truly meant for.
?" Harry frowned as she interrupted him. Harry was in the middle of pulling the proof copy of his article from his pocket, but froze at her incredulous tone. He looked up at her and she almost seemed…angry? "I know, you mentioned spending time with Malfoy at that equality place, but are you really calling him 'Draco' now?" Hermione continued as she held her hand out for the slip of parchment.
"Potter, I have you down for half-ten. The Bender. Don't be late."
But, down in that place where his feelings truly lived, there was apprehension. There was fear. As his counsellor would put it, there was something "unresolved" — something he couldn't
We try again with IUI in about a week, if I could get some good vibes or prayers or whatever it is you believe in I would certainly appreciate it. Warnings again for possible slowness with updates and such. As always, love you all and can't wait to hear what you're thinking!
Frowning, Harry pulled his eyes up from their dazed spot on the floor. Bill's hands were up in complete contrition. His wand was gingerly sat at the bottom of the staircase. He was giving up and denying Harry his right to hurt him. An officer was already detaining him with a binding charm and all Harry had managed were some harsh words and one good punch. Draco was at Harry's side, his hand gentle upon his arm. Asking questions Harry wasn't ready to answer. Telling him everything would okay even though they both knew nothing from here out would be normal again.
Draco didn't need telling twice. His shirt was on the floor in no time, quickly followed by his belt and (finally,
The guard knocked twice on the door before re-entering the holding area. "Time's up. You gotta leave now, Mr. Potter."
"You really should be nicer to them, Potter. Wouldn't want your pristine reputation sullied in the papers…."
It wasn't an overall untrue statement. Harry had mentioned when asking Draco to be his "date" that the guest list was small. Intimate. Which was very true. If he had to guess, most of those in attendance were the couple's close friends and family. And neither appeared to have many people they could place in either category. Which, inevitably, left slim pickings.
"And now we have to fix it," Draco finished for him. He took a slow drink from one of the coffee cups, his mind calming from the comforting taste and his heart racing from the surge of caffeine. "Fuel up. We have a long day ahead of us…."
"Oh, it's no problem, Harry," Kingsley reassured him with a smile, even as Draco's head dropped into his hands in second-hand embarrassment. The Minister rose from his chair, straightening his woven indigo robes without a single hint towards feeling disturbed. "I do have to be going, anyway. I must admit I didn't notice the lateness of the hour." He smiled gently and reached across the desk to shake Draco's hand when he stood as well. "I'll have my assistant in touch next week about the policy proposal."
There was a better time and place to garner relationship advice. But Harry hadn't slept the night before and he didn't think he could fake things another day with Draco. He didn't think he could look at that man and lie to him, let alone be lied to
Harry didn't deserve to wake under the glow of Pride. He didn't deserve its blanket of hope and history. He had done nothing to deserve it.
of Dobby shaking as he set down their bowls one-by-one.
Only he wasn't loud or commanding enough because not a single person acted as if they heard him speak. "A boy who has zero shame when it comes to dancing in front of strangers while wearing no clothing." Bellatrix supplied her daughter with the raw and uncensored truth. There was no mystery as to why the girl was the way she was. She was the product of every vile thing which had ever left her mother's mouth. She was the festering ooze on a never-healing sore, exposed to the world as a gruesome badge of honour.
you were doing by hiring me. It meant something to you or you wouldn't have done it. You wouldn't be paying me this well if you weren't trying to achieve something real here. Am I wrong?"
"Oh, everyone knows that. Harry Potter, greatest wizard of our time, the great Gryffindor poster boy."
"I think Rosie took a shine to you."
"So…you're off to Hogwarts soon. Right?" The boy nodded just barely. "Excited?" A small shrug. "Thought about what house you might like?" Another shrug. "Slytherin, right? Follow in my footsteps?"
"It's obviously important, Harry, if you're interrupting me while we should both be working." Very rarely did Hermione being the boss get thrown in Harry's face, so when it did he fully felt the weight of his mistakes. "I didn't mean that to sound harsh," she quickly remedied, sighing as she fell back into her chair. "I'm just still struggling to catch up after my maternity leave."
," Theo moaned, his spine arching at the touch. "From you and from Draco and from this mess."
A futile effort.
"That was the wrong wor—"
Draco scoffed and took a step away from him. "Salazar help me, if you're just using my organization as a charity case to further your image, Potter, I…." As quick as the anger came, it seemed to melt away as he raked his fingers through his hair. "That's not what you're doing, right?"
And how did Malfoy find this tavern in the first place?
"I know who it is,
Or…maybe it wasn't and Draco just kept repeating this over and over in his mind (and under his breath) to make himself feel better. That was more likely.
Harry
Truth be told, Harry wasn't feeling much like celebrating. Teddy was home. Teddy was safe. After all, the house still had some of its wards up from its time as an Order safe house. But…was he really all that safe? He was alive, but at what cost? He was still in pain. Breathing was loud and laborious. Every inhale was pulled in through gritted teeth while most exhales came out on whimpers and groans. For the rest of his life, he would have to take special potions just to keep his organs from fully shutting down. The Healers warned he would likely be behind those his age in development and learning due to the trauma. All of the trauma….
The more Harry thought about it, the more nervous he was really becoming. Especially after what Hermione had told him about the family. He wasn't the type to be irrationally afraid, really. He considered himself a pretty brave person. But he couldn't deny the gnawing at his conscience. He couldn't silence the torrential waterfall of what-if's now flashing through his mind at breakneck speeds. "Everything will be fine. I'm sure it'll all just be a laugh," Harry restressed, more probably for his sake now than Hermione's. "Look, I have to get packed and be back at Malfoy's house early tomorrow morning. Want to help me pick out my most 'peasanty' clothes for my week with the supposed leaders of the intolerance movement?"
A scuffle of quick footsteps preceded a quick exchange of words. It was like Harry was watching a verbal tennis match.
you want me to read them to you so I can think about them some more?"
Draco nodded, swallowing his retort as well as a heartbreaking goodbye. He'd learned long ago that soft kisses and whispered 'next time's only served to leave them in pieces.
Harry cracked a smile and shrugged. "I can tell. You're acting a bit…not you. Just, er, wanted to make sure you're okay?"
He'd run the coulda, shoulda, wouldas through his head a million times over already. They all ended with the same conclusion – Draco never should have left seven years previous. A fact he couldn't change. And, honestly, a fact he wasn't sure he wanted to change. Changing that meant he lost Scorpius and Shea and his little home away from the pressures of his family name. Losing all of that wasn't worth the easy fix for everything else, as selfish as that made him.
Shaky and unsure, Harry shook his head back and forth and finally looked back up at Draco. "No…no, what?"
"It was sort of a last-minute trip," Harry said to his hands. The truth was right there, ready to come pouring out. After the events of that day, he was honestly ready to let it out and find some sort of comfort. "I, uh…. I came into some money yesterday and thought they could use some of it…."
Bill frowned, flexing his jaw. "I knew he would break eventually…. He's not the strongest. Not when it comes to you." Harry opened his mouth to yell again, but Bill's next words froze the words in his throat. "I think the only thing that kept him quiet this long was family loyalty."
"If you need to rest a bit more, please feel free," Harry offered.
He could lie. He could simply say he was on his way out the door and tripped. It would be more of a half-true, really, and would certainly save him a modicum of face.
The guilty man currently being sentenced to rot for the rest of his life behind bars.
But even while he was still with Ginny and seemingly happy, something was off. He never would have cheated on her; she deserved so much better than to be betrayed. But he did dream, which was wildly out of his control but still felt like something wrong.
"Daddy f'cking craaaazyyyy," Scorpius cooed and threw a few pieces of cereal on the ground.
Except when he saw how sweetly Ron held Hermione and felt a fire rising in his belly. Trying to only peek at them from the barest corner of his eye, Harry pushed up off the couch and headed for the kitchen, as well. Hermione was busy laying out the boxes of Indian food Ron had brought with him. His hands were on her hips, fingers just barely caressing the skin beneath her shirt hem. The movement was mesmerizing and the relaxed smile afixed to her lips was entrancing. She truly looked happy. And if Harry had to admit it, the two of them did remind him a bit of his own parents.
The strange strangulation that had only just subsided filled the air in a heated instant. Harry found himself unable to hold eye contact with either of his friends, their gazes each carrying an uncomfortable weight. More than likely, what was about to be shared had something to do with the fight he had walked into.
"You know, I've been thinking," Charlie continued. "I, uh…. I think I'm going to quit the sanctuary. Come home.
"We talked about her."
Without having used any terms specifically, Draco had all but come out to Harry. And he did it so casually, speaking openly of an active sex life and living proudly even despite knowing he was disappointing his parents. Harry found himself envious of the courage Draco possessed, as well as humiliated at his own hesitation. He hadn't even been able to say the word "gay" without a blush.
"I like your scar and all it symbolizes. And that you still like to help people, even though it was initially something you didn't have a say in…."
The boy's voice was thin.

hated
"I am sure the two of you can at least grant us that much respect in this situation," Lucius continued.
As he often had to with Luna's sudden streams of consciousness, Harry took a literal step back and attempted to process. His first thought was how blind he had been about his dear friend all these years. Here Luna was, admitting to deep involvement in this community, having involved herself with organizations and attending special functions. All along, there had been someone so similar to what he'd thought made him so different right by his side and yet he'd had no idea. Was he truly so oblivious that he just wouldn't notice?
"Like…like am I doing it right?"
Harry sighed heavily, carding his fingers through his messy locks in an attempt to wake himself up. He lifted the receiver, tucked it between his ear and shoulder, and punched in the number to his and Hermione's flat.
Once Harry was sure Draco's breathing turned more shallow, he looked up at Astoria with a champagne-softened grin. "Did he fall asleep?" he whispered as she met his eyes.
It was official. Harry had done yet another stupid thing. Now it was just a matter of going through with the rest of it. He had no idea who he'd spoken to on the phone. No name. No information on age. Nothing to still his worries on this being a dodgy situation. Not a thing. Just a time and an address. A queer bar in the middle of the morning. And nearly a hundred questions he desperately wanted answers to.
"Sounds romantic," Draco sighed, admonishing himself inwardly. This was her wedding day, and she deserved to be so wistful. She did
And, perhaps, a pep talk.
"You knew?"
Draco followed the direction but turned back with a perplexed look once he reached the pavement. "Which way, then?" he asked with a raised brow and just the barest hint of a jab lacing his words.
Grinning, Draco leaned forward with a conspiratorial look and crooked his finger for Harry to come closer. Once Harry obeyed, his heart beating a mile a minute, Draco moved so his lips were a mere centimeter from his ear. The warm puffs of his breath sset small tremors down his spine, almost distracting him enough to miss what Draco whispered before resuming his seat with a teasing smirk.
The instant everything finished processing in his mind, Harry flung his sheets aside and practically stomped out of the room. He made certain to slam the door behind him, as if the violence of shutting the colours away could do anything to change the slimy tendrils of shame coiling in his belly. As if it could do anything to change the celebration kicking off around the world, once again leaving him behind.
Something was keeping him from leaving. That something was likely the cold bed waiting for him at home. He couldn't go back there. Not right now. Not before just a taste of human contact.
Even so, there was a certain level of comfort in watching Malfoy sleep. It was the only time he could admit he'd ever seen the man look relaxed in any measure of the word. His white-blond hair was longer than Harry had ever seen it, framing his face and nicely juxtaposing the dark brown of the sheets. If Harry were a man trained with a creative eye, he might have had the frame of mind to compare him to a work of art. Malfoy was beautiful enough to deserve to be described as such.
"What are you doing?" Harry asked, sounding like he might very well faint any moment. Especially since all of the blood in his body seemed to have rushed right back towards his prick. There was no way Draco wasn't going to notice how affected he was with his tenting shorts and gaping mouth.
And just like that, the fragile bubble surrounding their secret place shattered. The mood and glamor were gone completely. Sighing heavily, Draco pulled away and gave up all hope of pretending his problems ended at the door. "I was joking. Obviously."
Stopping at the lift, Draco shrugged and scrubbed fingers through his hair. He'd run them through so often by now that it was riddled with static. Obnoxious flyaways tickled at his forehead and every time he tried to tame them it only made them worse. In a fit of annoyance, he waved his wand to procure a tie around the blond strands. "I still think we should pay a visit to the Misuse of Magic Department. It's still our best lead, even if the targets aren't specifically Muggleborn children. We should go there next…."
