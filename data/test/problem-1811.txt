“Harry, is it… your first time?”
When the room stopped spinning around him, he made tentative steps towards the bathroom and let his clothes fall on the floor then stepped under the water, fighting his nausea.
A wicked smile stretched Harry’s lips, his seething anger turning into a bubbly and ominous purr inside him.
“What? Really?”
“th’t was ‘mazing” he mumbles, his hot breath brushing against Draco’s skin.
“Oh, that” said Harry stupidly “Dunno. Didn’t feel right to leave you there to die, I guess”
“Are you wearing a muggle suit?” said finally Draco whose bewilderment reached heights he never suspected existed.
After a moment, Harry seemed to cave in; he hugged her back tightly enough to hurt, burying his face in the fragrant mane of blond hair desperately, never wanting to let go.
“Aren’t you a little picky?”
“Let’s hope my future offspring doesn’t suffer from similar shortcomings. I cannot wait to see what glorious progeny the Báthory blood will bring me. Yes, that’s right, now that your mother is dead, you’re bride will actually become mine”
“Yeah, I bet.” Draco said in a breath, his insides tied in knots at the memory of their last conversation.
“Yesss” hisses the pale blond “fuck me now, please”
Harry slid his fingers through the pale mane and angled the blond’s head to kiss him deeper, licking sensually in his mouth. Malfoy moaned and the sound sent heat pooling around his spine like lava. He kissed him harder and asked for passage.
Draco slowly reached the hand Harry was holding in the air and took the glass filled with the pale-gold bubbly liquid. He took a sip, still not believing the scene.
“What?” asked Harry innocently.
Once again, Harry mused on the succession of events that led the pale blond here in his own house. It was one thing to text, another to have a drink with you former sworn enemy with your wand in the kitchen. But he enjoyed the simple pleasure of having company. And had realized talking to him was surprisingly easy, like it had been through the phone.
“Please, tell me you’ve got something ‘Mione!” said Ron hopefully.
“And you were planning on patching it up like this?”
“What did you do to him, you twisted bastard…” growled Harry.
Malfoy didn’t answer but licked his lips in an unconscious gesture. Harry’s heart rate picked up again erratically. What was Malfoy playing at? And what was happening to him???
“Yes, that’s a way to put it”
“How dare you, Potter??? I’m your Supervising Officer and as such, you’ll show deference and respect like the meaningless and ridiculous obedient lackey you are” Catesby fulminated with a face so full of disdain that it took Harry everything he had not to punch him. His magic crackled around them, unstable and electric, filling the room with the smell of ozone.
The bushy brunette knocked and let herself in the room, throwing expectant glances at the two Aurors. Harry kept his head down and pretended acute interest in his report. Ron rose to his feet and put on his coat and scarf. Hermione hesitated for a moment then approached Harry’s desk warily, as if the tiniest movement could make him explode.
Harry couldn’t hear Hermione’s response but seconds later, the redhead bellowed:
“Good old Snape” he chuckled darkly and took another generous swig.
“It was in second year… We brewed Polyjuice potion and… turned into Crabbe and Goyle after the Halloween Feast.”
The dark-haired wizard was getting worked up too and his green eyes flashed with anger. He shot up.
“I don’t think so.”
like a walking corpse” whined Harry, rubbing his eyes and falling on a chair dispiritedly.
“Don’t mind Al, he’s just obsessed with cuddles. I haven’t been home much these past months and I think he likes you” Harry said with a crooked smile.
“Yes, he’s just over here” she said and moved aside to reveal the white-haired man -two feet behind her- whose wounds were being tended to by another Auror, the one Harry had almost scared to death back at St Mungo’s. “Joey here is tending to his wounds. Impressive and nasty but non-magic, he should be all right”.
Malfoy removes his complicated-looking goggles equipped with some kind of magnifying contraption that made his look like the mad scientists on the telly from when Harry was a child, tousling his sleek white strands doing so. The tall blond run his hands through it to try and tame it back and Harry catches a glimpse of scar tissue on his forearm, tracing the outline of the Dark Mark. It has faded but it’s still there and it’s a sobering thought.
“Draco… Oh” he sobs and his back arches as if he’s being electrocuted when a surge of white-hot pleasure explodes in his skull and rakes every inch of his body. A short while later, Draco buries his head in his neck and comes silently, all his muscles contracting at once. He inhales deeply then rolls on the side so as not to crush Harry beneath his weight.
“No, no, not Smith, I promise”
“What do you want?” the Auror said through clenched teeth, his voice a rough low growl.
Draco covered his face with his hands. This what not happening, it couldn’t be.
… you would learn to remember what was befitted to a Malfoy. I was obviously sorely mistaken. Oh well, I’ve always been an incurable idealist!”
fine, ok? Stop worrying over me.”
Hell, Draco was so hot. Gloriously, conclusively, insanely hot.
Then he remembered the Auror besieged by nightmares and instructed the wolf to soothe him with its presence. The apparition walked slowly and paused in front of the dark-haired young man, then it lightly jumped on the couch, turned around on itself like a dog would and lied down on Harry’s feet. The Auror’s features relaxed almost instantly and his body loosened the tight knot it had become. His breathing eased.
“You’re hopeless” Harry grumbles crossly, felling his blush blooming on his face hotly “You’re just bored and taking the piss at me as a distraction”
It was good to forget a moment about his gloomy thoughts, his empty, cold house that didn’t feel the same anymore and the hollow feeling growing bigger everyday inside him. Harry pushed the thought at the back of his head. Tonight was about Ron and celebration, he told himself firmly.
Malfoy threw him an odd look then turned his eyes away.
” he said affectionately in Parseltongue “
“I’m sorry, I should have told you before but it didn’t really come up and I didn’t know if…”
“Don’t provoke me” Harry said in a warning tone.
A loud crack frightened a number of wild birds, which took off on the grey, ominous Scottish sky. The four wizards had apparated in an old and forgotten patch of woods. The air was saturated with humidity and the overpowering smell of damp earth reached their nostrils.
They both ruthlessly devoured their sandwiches in a few bites then remained contentedly silent for a while, savouring their full bellies and the nice weather in the pitch emblazoned with the Puddlemere team’s colours and emblem: navy-blue and crossed golden bulrushes.
“Why didn’t you go to St Mungo’s anyway?” said Draco to keep him awake.
“Right. I shouldn’t have doubted you, sorry mate” said Harry uncomfortably.
Sándor nodded respectfully and raised his wand.
The green stare snapped at him and his irises widened and darkened when he understood what Draco was doing with his right hand.
“Is she now?” answered politely Harry. Draco could tell by the sound of his voice that he was smiling.
“I put her in a stasis state but she doesn’t have long. We need to get her proper care and quick” the brunette witch said resolutely.
“Thank you Hermione.” He smiled shyly “I’m sorry I kept it from you… It’s just, it all sort of happened and then I didn’t know how to say it.”
“Are you sure? It’s perfectly alright if we stay on safer grounds, you know”
The Auror heard a violent rustling of sheets and tore from the door, his heart racing. Disturbed, Harry quickly hid in the bathroom. He undressed himself absently and stepped into the tub. As hot water flowed over his constricted muscles, he closed his eyes and was invaded by visions of a pale body clutching the sheets, his torso arched up in ecstasy. He was painfully hard and slammed his hands on the hard tiles in front of him, desperately trying to resist the urge to let go and grasp his sensitive flesh to quench the fire coiled around the base of his spine. But no matter how hard he tried to ignore it, he was way too aroused to resist any longer. Harry finally caved in and wrapped his rough hands around the throbbing length. With long and swift back and forth motions he brought himself closer and closer to his release, the tension building up, stifling his moans by biting his lips forcefully. He recalled the softness of Draco’s skin when he had traced his scar in this very bathroom. How would it feel like to touch him, caress him all over? To kiss those lips and lick his ivory flesh? At the idea of his tongue on the opalescent flesh, Harry climaxed. He came over and over with a strangled cry, his brains raked by waves of sharp pleasure.
“I figured as much, since you look around her age” he pauses and reflects for a moment.
“Well, I did say I would be up for another round soon enough. And let’s say you made a compelling case” he says innocently, watching Harry from under his long lashes.
Draco caught the bag and looked inside. Bottle green Quidditch robes were neatly folded inside with leather protections.
This time, Draco’s certain of it, he’s getting hard again. It’s a wonder what the realization of a lifetime fantasy can do to one’s stamina.
“Do what you must” she switched back to English and said unflinchingly, her voice unwavering.
But Draco ignored him and kept going, sucking and swirling and caressing with that expert tongue of his, pulling Harry on the edge in no time. Harry threaded his right hand in this silky white mane and held the flat surface with the other, clinging desperately for support.
Malfoy shot him an amused look.
“I’m really sorry, it won’t happen again” with a sharp intake of breath he added “Goodnight, Draco”. Then Harry was gone, leaving a confused and unbelievably turned on Draco, touching his swollen lips with shaking fingers.
Potter traces it with shaking fingers, looking wretched. Draco presses his hand on his chest to make him feel his heart beating underneath and Potter closes his eyes.
“I’m not staying here listening to you apologize again with your sad puppy face” he says sternly. “First that’s a turn-off (a blatant lie) and second, it’s okay. I forgive you. Obviously, I wouldn’t be here if I hadn’t.”
“What made you change your mind?” Harry cannot help but ask.
“Oh and how so, do tell, Auror Weasley, I can’t wait to hear it” sneered Catesby.
"So why aren't you trying to forget all this nonsense in the loving arms of the Weaslette, ô Chosen One?” slurred Malfoy with an impish smile.
“Oh, yes it is. I am a coward and a murderer and a FUCKING DEATH EATER, DON’T YOU FORGET THAT!!!”
The glowing purple light reflected lazily on marmoreal skin and the white body arched when the spell hit him, grey-pupils stretching impossibly wide.
“You’re kidding, it looks fantastic! What is it?”
The kitchen had been cleaned and was shining everywhere and smelling the familiar and comforting scent of beeswax. The roaring fire and clean chandelier cast festive lights on the gleaming cutlery, china and glasses that had been carefully laid on the oak table. It looked like Christmas.
“Y-you did?” asked Draco in disbelief to Harry’s back that had went slightly rigid.
“And how do you intend on doing that, may I ask? There are dozens of wizards around us who are waiting for the smallest excuse to tear you to shreds after what you did to the Dark Lord, you must know that. Showing up here is already suicidal.”
“Okay, okay, don’t get your knickers in a twist, geez…”
“I got news from work” Ron said in a low voice.
“What?”
The raven-haired young man delicately put the snake on a sunny stone and strode inside the garden, barefoot and careless. He apparently decided seven a.m. was a good time to tidy the garden and started lifting junk from all over the overgrown and chaotic patch of greenery then piling them in a corner without the help of his wand that stood out of his back pocket. Mesmerized, Draco watched the nonchalant and easy grace of his movements, the harmonious muscles rippling under his tanned skin, the unruly black mane and the metal frame of his glasses catching the sun and glinting periodically.
“Yeah well, the guests are supposed to be here in half an hour and you know bloody well that Granger and Longbottom are always early” he said in a warning tone.
Draco then conjured a blanket and covered the Gryffindor. He sat in a nearby armchair and watched Harry’s relaxed features, a deep swirl of emotions storming inside of him. He had produced a Patronus! Draco couldn’t believe it. He admired the beautiful creature he had created and felt immensely proud and amazed. The Slytherin would have never imagined a wolf. Finding out he was able to conjure a Patronus was like a balm on festered wounds. He was human too. He was.
Draco sighed and took the pencil but Harry didn’t let go. At first nothing happened then came the familiar sensation of a hook connecting to his navel and lifting him up.
An impressed murmur rippled through the group.
“Oh Draco, you’ll never cease to amuse me, I have to give it to you” another bark of laughter seized him then his features morphed in seething anger. He caught Draco by his hair and threw him on the ground, twisting his neck at an odd angle so his face was inches from him.
Harry didn’t answer and try to spell his wand out of his hand but the piece of wood didn’t budge. Creasing his brows, he cast an
“Thanks, Southwell”
Then he heard a discreet knock on the door. He didn’t answer, white-hot anger rising again in his chest.
“Yeah, well… I suppose it’d be only polite of me to return the favour” he manages feebly despite Potter’s distracting ministrations.
“Don’t worry” Draco murmurs “I’ll make it good for you, so good…”
Draco crept silently through the sleepy house, the last thing he wanted was to wake up the Auror. Harry had had a hellish week, coming home every three or four days and sleeping only a couple hours at a time.
He takes a fortifying breath and knocks then waits, heart hammering his ribs.
After a moment –or several millennia– of shocked silence, Draco finally gets his mouth to work again and form words. Anger starts to creep inside his belly and the embers that were still alight flare to life again.
“Hmm, things did get a tad hectic in my last years so it’s entirely possible” he says lightly but his fake nonchalant tone doesn’t fool Harry. They have diligently avoided the War up until now and he knows they thread in dangerous waters right now. “I do have a familiar feeling about you…”
Ron looks as if he has been struck by lightning; he’s even gaping and apparently cannot stop staring at Harry, which riles him up even more.
Light footsteps indicated to Draco that he didn’t wait for his answer. His curiosity piqued, the pale blond dressed quickly and walked down the stairs wondering what Harry was up to.
“Fair point” Harry heard, far, far away from him, he smiled and his features relaxed.
“Huh… no”
“Merlin, you’re such a Slytherin…” sighs Harry after he has been manoeuvred once too many by the foxy blond.
“Can I touch you?” Draco asks softly.
“I knew I didn’t stand a chance fighting you… I’m sorry…” said Draco miserably.
He slips out and collapses besides Harry, his muscles shaking from exhaustion. The darker-skinned wizard stretches and curls around him like a sated and lazy panther. When the thumbing in his temples subsides, Draco wraps his arms against the hot, sticky body, slipping his leg between Harry’s and smearing the mixture of sweat and semen even further but Harry looks totally indifferent at the discomfort.
“Draco, fuck, you’re so bloody tight” Potter says in a strained voice.
“Nothing… It’s just-”
Draco sighed. The pale-blond’s destination was the living room to get a new book. He wasn’t sleeping much these days and relied heavily on the distraction. He pushed the door and entered the room. The lambent remnants of the fire shed a reddish and shimmering glow in the room. Draco stepped in and approached the wooden shelves near the door, looking for a book that would likely contain something about reconstructive spells. He found an interesting one that he grabbed victoriously.
“I…” started Harry confusedly, his brain already fuzzy with alcohol and that weird sensation that made him unable to look away from the heated grey eyes that bore into him like silver blades.
, thought Harry bleakly.
“Where’s Hermione?” asked Harry, not even slowing down when the tall redhead showed up at his side.
“Oh F-fuck, oh Merlin-fuck…” says Harry in a strangled cry.
Before he knew what had happened, he found himself kissing the soft lips tasting like Firewhisky ardently, desperately. Malfoy made a strangled sound and Harry drew back from the kiss. They were both panting hard and Malfoy’s lips were shining with saliva. His eyes were heavily lidded and the sheer hunger he could read in them made him shiver.
Malfoy drank again and passed the bottle to Harry.
“NO!!!” shouted Draco desperately. “Please, don’t do that, please…”
“Stop this. Now.” He said out loud firmly. “Get your shit together, you’re a bloody Auror for Fuck’s sake”
“I know… I’m sorry… I… just didn’t know what to do. When the day arrived, I just couldn’t let them do this to him.” He said sheepishly, the whisky starting to make his head buzz pleasantly.
Naturally, he hadn’t taken Harry and Ron’s influence from the War inside the Bureau very well and had tried by any means necessary to break them. The problem was, they had contested his strategies in meetings regarding the recent surge in Dark Arts activity, suggesting to tackle the problem at his source before it was too late instead of merely observing.
When Draco looked up at Harry, his stomach churned unpleasantly, reminding him of what the Slytherin had done.
He forced what he intended as a reassuring smile that felt foreign on his lips and held Hermione’s eyes resolutely.
“What the fuck are you doing here, Potter?”
Harry finally snaps out of it and gasps audibly in the heavy silence. Draco spins round and his hard eyes fall on Harry, standing in the doorway. Dozens of emotions flash on his pale face, too fast for Harry to grasp it, he finally remembers how his throat works.
“Though if this is your way to apologise, I may rile you up on purpose just like old times” Harry laughed.
Draco chuckled at Harry’s artlessness.
“Thanks, Luna.”
“Yes?”
Draco looked stiff but healthy, his aristocratic features as sharp as always.
” answered Harry absently.
“Are you crazy??? Ron, you bloody well deserve this and you’re way more qualified for the job than I will ever be! I would be rubbish at this but I know you’re going to be brilliant”
“Let’s sit, we don’t have much time.”
“Great, let us know when you’re free and we’ll arrange something” she hesitated “We love you, you know.”
“Fucking hell, what am I going to do now?” Whispered Draco, drained from all energy, as he let himself fall on the nearby wall and slide down the floor with a defeated expression.
“NOOOOO!!!!!!”
*       *       *
“Yes! Oh God, Harry, yes!” the pale blond exclaims, clutching the headboard desperately.
“Well, you know me, when I’m not doing something stupid, I get bored.” Harry smiled viciously. “And my work doesn’t exactly live up to my expectations on that front these days”
“Sándor” answered Narcissa haughtily and Draco flinched. Sándor. Belladonna’s older brother. And Briccius’ elder son.
When he pushes inside him, Harry bites his lower lip but smiles, his forehead is creased with the mixture of pain and pleasure. His breath is short and shallow, the muscles of his abdomen taut. He arches against Draco, opening his legs wider still.
“Then, sit, Potter” ordered Draco in a commanding voice, his posh accent sharper than usual.
Draco growled.
That night, Draco slept badly, invaded by nightmares filled with glowing red eyes, green flashes, choking black smoke, fire and death. He woke up with a throat constricted by anxiety and raw. He must have screamed in his sleep. Covered with an icy sweat, the pale blond kicked his blanket away and stood in the cold room with his pale blue pyjama pants clinging to his skin with perspiration. Draco let the drum of the water over his shoulders wash away the last remnants of his dream and soothe him. Then, with his towel around the hips, he resumed his favourite past time: staring out the window. He was in no state to read and he liked to watch the morning unfold, coating everything in golden glimmers of orange in the backyard full of weeds and early birds.
“Okay, thanks for letting me know, I’ll probably read and try not to get assaulted by that sneaky reptile of yours”
“Well aren’t you a bucket of sunshine, Potter?” said Malfoy absently, passing him the bottle. Their fingers brushed momentarily and Malfoy raised surprised grey eyes to his then looked away. Something fuzzy ached inside Harry.
“Of course you did, you dirty little rascals” said Ron admiringly.
A slight tremor ran along the firm weight pressed against Harry’s front and a little whimpering noise escaped the blond. Already hard and breathless, the Gryffindor tightened his possessive arm around the narrow hips, his cock pressing against the fine pale arse. He stifled a groan, the over sensitive skin sending delightful electrical shocks in his whole body. Harry kissed the pale neck lazily and messily, grazing the warm skin. In a surge of rash boldness, Harry caressed the flat stomach, angular hipbones, traced the round form of Draco’s arse and slipped his trembling fingers between his cheeks, brushing the tender flesh, his heart beating hard.
“But you don’t care.”
“NO!” he cried out desperately with a rough voice.
“Hell, yeah”
The day before, Harry had muttered something about “new Dark Arts activity in Britain” and collapsed on his bed without even closing the door. The bugger looked thin enough to be swept away by the wind and his skin had a greyish tinge that wasn’t auguring well. Draco was starting to worry about him, it wasn’t good to be this exhausted on a job that was this dangerous. If there was indeed Dark Wizards active again in the streets, Harry needed to be in his top form, not constantly on a verge of passing out.
He was on the pavement outside...was this Angelo’s? He saw himself and Draco waiting for a table. Draco looked sweet. A bit frightened, but pleased. He followed them to the table. He watched himself look like a lovestruck idiot. How could he look that goofy?
Harry was silent for a moment. Then he said in a low voice, “I’m sorry.  I really didn’t know.”
“I’m sorry,” she said as she sat, dropping some of her cheerful pretence and pouring her own tea. “This isn’t easy.”
“Ok, well that’s one down.” B.J. said, “I had a bit of medical training in the Navy. I don’t think you have a serious head injury, although you’ll have a nasty lump and a powerful headache in the morning. Now let’s get you home.”
“You know why.”
“Yes.” Harry thrust his hips up. ”I want you to be very exclusive about what you put in your mouth.”
Harry froze.
“I’ll be fine, love.” He smiled at her reassuringly.
him and YOU took him from me. That was the happiest night of my goddamn life and then you showed up and put your fucking dick in him. He was MINE!” Harry began to cry, he couldn’t believe he was letting this man see him this way, but he couldn’t hold back anymore. “He was everything to me, goddammit! I was over the moon to have the attention of that brilliant, incredible man and then you took him away!” Harry collapsed into the chair behind him and put his head in his hands, sobbing in earnest.
In stepped a gorgeous, tall, man with slender features, dark hair, and the most piercing blue eyes Draco had ever seen.
“At least I’ll get some sleep.” Draco mumbled as he tried to tuck back into his book.
Harry looked thoughtful. “I dunno, I guess the same as what I want as a wizard, what I’ve always wanted: get married, buy a house, raise a family, maybe do outings and be a club leader for the kids’ groups, Sunday family supper at the Weasleys’, get a dog, the whole suburban family thing.” Harry sighed and kissed the top of Draco’s hair.
“Did he?”
They relaxed into each other, sighing pleasantly in the wake of their newly rediscovered bond.
“Ugh, I’m starving! Thank you.”
“Fuck, Harry. You too?” Draco says, pulling away, gasping.
Draco nodded and B.J. pushed himself in slowly with a low groan. He put his hands on Draco’s hips and stilled when he bottomed out, breathing heavily into his ear.
“I hate you,” Patrick said, leaning back in his chair and finishing his drink. “This was one of our better bowling nights. Next time, you’re on my team.”
Draco arrived to meet Harry on Saturday in a pair of his best dark blue denims and a soft, thin, sapphire blue v-neck jumper. When Harry opened the door, he smiled, pulled him in, and kissed him. God, Draco thought he would never get tired of the taste of Harry’s mouth. It was tea and biscuits and those little mints he always liked to suck on. He was hungry for the little noises Harry made when he grabbed Draco’s waist to pull him closer. Draco could die here. He wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck and began to devour him, pressing himself against Potter as tightly as he could, until he felt hands slide to the front of his hips and push him back gently.
Her face softened. “I know Harry. I’m sorry. I honestly thought if you saw him it would be good for you. It’s been a month and you won’t even tell me what happened. You just seem so miserable. Why won’t you just talk to me about it?”
“I hope that’s ok.”
, given him the slightest inkling that he was interested...
don’t want my past brought up in courses. I don’t need or want that sort of attention or pressure. I just want to get through the program. So how about we call a truce?”
Draco turned to lie on his back staring up at the ceiling, he closed his eyes and sighed. “I wanted to be the first Wizard to invent a way to go into the stars.”
Harry closed his eyes and drifted off back to sleep, warm and content
Not anymore, he thought, remembering the smile on Draco’s face as he laughed at Hudson’s, how sparkling and alive he’d looked in the photos with his friends.
Cy turned away from the match, smirking. “Do you think we should tell them we could theoretically do both?”
“This is all your fault,” he said turning to Cy. “I swear to god, you’re the only person I’ve ever met that gets better at bowling the drunker he gets.”
“BECAUSE I DIDN’T THINK OF THAT!” Patrick bellowed, as the room erupted in laughter.
“HARRY! It’s a dog! We are looking at an adorable blond dog sitting in his living room. Doing nothing but staring at us. Unless you think he is dangerous…”
“Likewise.” Laurie took his hand and met his eye. Something cautious and predatory passed between them, but Draco turned away, unwilling to meet the penetrating gaze.
“That’s what you want, too, isn’t it? I won’t tell if you don’t.”
Well that was right out, he could never do it. Not without constantly being reminded of the one man who—
Draco’s perked up. “I’m sorry, I didn’t catch your name?”
me! I fucking loved him! I fucking
“I’ll try to find him for you, Pans.” He kissed her forehead again.
“Can I help you Mr. Potter?”
B.J. appeared behind him as if from nowhere and leaned an arm on Harry’s shoulder, “Really? Do tell,” he said, wiggling his eyebrows conspiratorially.
“Hermione, please.”
-----------

“Yes love?”
He shifted slightly; nuzzling into the hand caressing him, he opened his eyes and smiled at Draco, fully dressed and crouching beside the bed. He began to reach for his glasses, but Draco stopped him.
“Love you too.”
Suddenly the fingers in his hair tightened and pulled him back. “Do you want me?”
“Ok, two,” B.J. smiled indulgently “But, from what I gathered during your barely coherent rambling last night, you lived in constant fear that all that was going to fall apart. Well I hate to tell you this, but it was. It always was.”
As they were finishing up their tiramisu, Harry grinned and excused himself to go to the men’s. When he stood, suddenly there was a shout from behind Draco.
Harry visibly bristled, but the other man didn’t seem to notice. “Goldstein,” he said with a curt nod.
STUPID
“Yeah, yeah,” Draco laughed as he shouted down the street after the last of the departing bunch. “See you at game night, idiots!” He turned back, laughter fading to a gentle smile as he approached Harry and cleared his throat. He reached out a hand. “Thanks for coming. It was really nice to see you again.”
Harry grabbed the front of Goldstein’s shirt, ready to strike— but Draco put a hand on his arm.
“Ah ah ah! NO!” she said as Draco opened his mouth to speak.  “You can whinge all you want Draco Malfoy, but I’ve been watching you self destruct for 7 fucking years. I have had it. I thought I’d give you time to figure it out. I thought that Harry would be able to help you. For a while, you seemed to be getting better even, but now you’ve gone and chucked it. So I don’t care what you do to fix it, but we are going to fix it. I will not answer my door in the middle of the night to find you bleeding and sobbing in the arms of a stranger ever again. You scared the crap out of me last night. Thank goodness you picked a good one to screw up with, because it could have been a lot worse, do you realize that? Anybody else might have left you there, you could have been injured far more severely than you were, and you were so out of it you could have been taken advantage of. The way you showed up last night, you didn’t even look like you cared much either way.” Her eyes hardened, “Well I do, and this is going to stop. Do I make myself clear?”
“I should also mention that he seems to also have gained some very dog like features. Mr. Canis, please calm down it is just the owl post.”
“Will you be able to join us, love?”
“I pick Blaise. He’s tall. I feel like the long arms are an advantage.”
“Alright.” A hand reached out from under the sink. “Help me up?”
Harry nodded and headed off to find the loo. No sooner was he out of earshot than Goldstein rounded on Draco, poking a finger in his chest hard enough to bruise. “Now you listen to me, you murderous piece of shit.” Draco blanched. “I don’t know what your game is, or what you’re after chasing a man who is obviously too good for you. We all know you don’t give a fuck about anyone but yourself. Do you think I forgot what it was like living in the Room of Requirement like a refugee while you and your cronies swanned around the castle helping your twisted master? Because I don’t. Potter may buy your brainwashed, terrified, abused child act, but frankly the rest of us don’t give a shit if it’s true or not. You belong in Azkaban. Or better yet an empty fucking shell. I hear that’s how your mummy got old Lucius back. Nothing more than a blank, lifeless zombie she has to feed twice a day. Heard it broke dear ol’ mum’s heart and she hasn’t been seen or heard outside since. Harry’ll figure out what you are soon enough, once he’s had his fill of that pretty arse of yours. Glad you’re good for
“Yes yes I heard the D.O.L.T got a report about a lost dinner from a… let me check… Victor Canis? It seems they recovered the dinner in a rather disgusting fashion...now the dog is here and I am too. Feed him Harry. I am done with you trying to get in touch with me. Goodbye.”
“No. From what I understand, he and Harry got into a big row and Harry made Neville swear never to say anything. I don’t know what Harry told him, but if you ask Neville about it he gets really angry and refuses to talk about it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He should stop this.
Draco looked up at him, confused.
“True, but this way I can enjoy it knowing my grandmother isn’t rolling over in her grave with the copy of
“Promise me you’ll tell me when something’s wrong so I can try to fix it.”
He nodded. “Yes. Merlin, yes Draco, I’m sure. I want you back if you’ll have me. I’ve fucking missed you. I wanted you every day when you were gone. I tried to make it go away. I was so angry. And what you did hurt me. God, I was gutted. You were everything to me. And when I saw…”—he swallowed—“I thought you didn’t care. But I swear to you Draco, if I’d known what was wrong...I was an idiot. I think we can get it right this time. I want to get it right this time. Please. Can we try?”
Blaise looked wary. “I don’t bowl…”
Hermione didn’t even bat an eyelash. “Don’t flatter yourself, you aren’t slick enough to be the devil. Just tell me the truth.”
Harry’s head shot up. “He TOLD you?” he asked incredulously.
“On my desk!”
They were standing close together, forehead to forehead, eyes closed and Draco whispered. “Are you sure Harry? I don’t want to do this if you aren’t sure. Please don’t do this to me and not mean it.”
“You should wait for your father, dear.”
He downs it, his back still to Harry, and Harry can see his body begin to shift. Once his transformation has ended he pulls out a pair of glasses and turns around. “So what’ll it be today? School boy rivals? I brought the tie… but oh no, I see, you’re dressed rather handsomely - are we playing husbands back from a romantic night out again?”
who was a great help when I was stressed and trying to get this ready for ya'll on time. And as always to the best beta and punctuation wrangler I know,
He turned and began wiping down his station and making sure everything was clean and stocked enough for him to take a quick break during the brief lull they were having.
“Good boy. Now, first of all, you and I both know that Harry bloody Potter isn’t ‘all you’ve ever known of love in this world’, you drama queen.” She leaned across the table and smacked him hard across the back of the head. “There’s me you jackass, and I don’t take kindly to being told I don’t love you when I have never given you any indication to the contrary. I’ve been on your team since we were 7 years old, finding clever ways to hide from boring parties together. It’s always been you and me against the world, even if you did try to pretend otherwise for parts of your moody teen years. Vince and Greg loved you in their own monosyllabic way. There’s your parents. Your father may not have known the right way to show it, but he loved you. Oh! And your mother loved you so much she defied

“Up top!” Patrick exclaimed, as she high-fived him while winking at Garrett.
Draco let out a cry, gripping Harry and pushing back against him with every thrust.
“Goodnight… Harry.”
"I didn't know that involved wearing some sort of stupid hat with ears and my name on it, Potter!"
“Why’s that?”
“Yes, fucking B.J., the man with his arm around you in Diagon the day you quit? A few fucking weeks after…that night. Merlin, you didn’t waste any time did you? The man I saw doting on you at brunch? The man I caught you fucking? THAT B.J., your boyfriend, ring a bell? God I should have fucking known…” He paced away, nearly growling.
“Too many people.” Harry yawned.
Draco felt shock and relief flood his body as his cock stiffened. He moaned against Harry’s neck as he felt something firm and thick press against his thigh. “Top or Bottom?” he choked as he pulled Harry backward into the cellar.
This will not be abandoned!  I am one chapter away from the ending and I promise a new chapter will be published every Sunday until the story is complete :)
Harry looked up and rubbed the back of his neck with his hand and sighed. “I wanted to wish you a happy birthday. And I wanted to say I’m sorry about taking off like that the other day, I was a coward and I’m sorry. And I’m sorry about what happened between us...before. I didn’t know how you felt, and I wish I had, and I’m such an idiot for not seeing it or asking when I felt something was off and I…I just wanted to see you. I miss you Draco.”
Harry wiped the tears away and kissed him gently. Draco smiled into the kiss and began to shift his hips, a clear invitation for Harry to move.
“I won’t, love.”
“Yes sir.” B.J. winked and took the plate over to the table Hermione, Ron and Neville were seated at.
“Oh, thank god,” Harry crushes their mouths together in a fierce, hungry kiss. Desperate hands grasping as they begin to explore every inch of each other.
“Draco, I broke up with Laurie. I only agreed to go out with him in the first place because I was spending so much time with you and I thought... well I thought there was no way you could ever feel for me what I was feeling for you. I mean Merlin Draco! Have you met you? You are so unbelievably intelligent, and clever, and so surprisingly funny.” Harry smiled nervously. “When I was assigned to be your bunkmate I thought it would be the worst hell imaginable, but it turned out it was easy. You are the only person besides Ron and Hermione and my immediate Weasley family to see me for me. You aren’t in awe of me. You’re just… you. And as it turns out, what you are is still very frequently an areshole. But I honestly don’t care, because I’ve found that you make my days brighter, you make me better at training, you keep me level when I’m being ridiculous. Draco, I thought you saw that.”
Harry had just moved in last week. They’d had a few squabbles over some of Harry’s tackier items. Harry had gotten frustrated and exclaimed, “What’s so awful about it?!”
“How?!” Cy shouted.
“Ughhhhhhhhhh! You are Draco Malfoy, for god’s sake!” Pansy was exasperated. “First of all, have you seen you? You are stunningly gorgeous. When you are confident, people stop and stare when you walk down the street. You are ridiculously intelligent. You were the second smartest student in our year; you outstripped even the Ravenclaws on marks. You are hilarious and playful. I don’t think Potter appreciated it much at the time since all your jokes were aimed at him, but you used to have the common room in stitches. Draco, when we were young, before this war stole everything from you, all of Slytherin wanted to either be you or fuck you. I would give anything to have that Draco back.”
” I’ve never seen that door before,” Draco blurted.
A massive thank you to
“Well you weren’t wrong, it was
Cy launched a cracker at Draco, sticking his tongue out.
Make him forget what? Merlin, no.
Harry hadn’t been able to do that for him.
It was a drowsy Thursday morning and B.J. was winning at Mario Kart.They were supposed to be adults, but here they were, yelling at each other because B.J. used Donkey Kong to shove Toad into the water while making a turn on the Royal Raceway and it had cost Draco the Star Cup.
“Pretty sure luv, why?
“Padma’s in charge of Parvati and I tonight. Night boys. Thanks for taking care of me. I’m lucky to have such wonderful friends.”
“Yes you are.”
“Suck it, Crap Bag! I win!” Cy shouted as he and Garrett jumped up and down screaming.
“So you come here often?” B.J. grinned.
“I’ll uh...I’ll be right back,” Draco said, standing to go. ”Don’t leave or anything.”
“PATRICK! What is the butt for!?” B.J. called out.
“Ow!” Cy exclaimed as he withdrew his hand, shaking the sting away.
Harry’s eyes hardened, his jaw tightened and he clenched his fists. He looked as if he was ready to snap. “Do you know what I thought at the club when I turned around and found you gone? I lost my fucking mind. I thought you must have been kidnapped. Everyone told me to just forget it, that you’d probably just gone home or wandered off. But all I could think was, no, not my Draco, not after tonight, not after that kiss, not after he finally gave himself to me. I blamed myself for making you go on a date in public, worried someone had retaliated and I had been selfish when it was my job to protect you. I had just gotten everything I wanted and I was terrified I’d find you dead or in hospital.” Harry’s eyes flashed and he spat. “Well, I wish I had, because it turns out I was right the first time. You are a cold, selfish, manipulative bastard, Draco Malfoy.”
He looked as beautiful as ever, both hands in the pockets of his rich black trousers, and Merlin, he was wearing that green button-up...
❥ Kristinabird
worn a pair of trousers in his life and he becomes acutely aware of the way they hug his bum.
Harry chuckled. “Are you sure you wouldn’t rather go out for breakfast? It’d be much easier.”
“I got off a bit early and I wanted to see where you live.” Laurie smiled as he tucked his hands behind his back and surveyed their quarters. “So… this is your room huh? It’s very… quaint.” His eyes examined their shared space, before focusing on Draco. “And you must be Draco. I’ve heard a lot about you from Harry.” He stepped forward and extended a hand.
“Yeah, he put out a keep-away order and used my Death Eater status to—” Hermione looked stricken “This was a mistake. I should go.” Draco got up and all but bolted out the door in an almost perfect imitation of Harry from the other day.
“Mistress Narcissa, Mastor Malfoy is here for his tea!”
“Bacon sir?”
“Ah! Something we have in common! Good man. This one drives me nuts, do you have any idea how many times I’ve tried to explain the concept of off sides to him? I swear, I’ve left little napkins with diagrams in half the pubs in Britain and this one still just shrugs his shoulders and picks a team to support at random based on which one he thinks has the fittest blokes. It’s embarrassing to be seen with him! ”
“You had a visitor.”
he wanted to screech as he watched himself flit from friend to friend, dragging Draco along like terrified prey in the lion's den. Draco smiled and nodded, and people eyed him warily. He held out a hand occasionally and was greeted cordially. Draco looked relieved when Harry finally left him to sit on his own.
“Draco used to have it too. He was impossible. You wouldn’t believe the lungs on him.” She cradled ‘Rion on his tummy, soothing his back.
“I sleep here,” he pointed to his meager cot, “you sleep there,” he pointed at Draco on his equally shabby bed only 3 feet away, “and neither of us kills the other while they’re sleeping. Sound fair?”
“Oh please! I think you just peaked early. I hear that’s a problem of yours.” Cy stuck out his tongue.
“Me too.”
Harry flinched, a flurry of emotions rolling in the pit of his stomach. He ran a hand through his hair – he wanted to say something, anything to Draco to let him know that he understood now.
and he looked at me like I was deranged, explaining that he thought I knew. That YOU had put in a request to switch rooms last week, as well as a request for a NEW FUCKING PARTNER, and that you had been informed that it was approved TWO DAYS AGO! None of this, by the way, did you think was information you should discuss or share with
“Let me rephrase,” Draco continued. “Neither one of us was pleased with our rooming assignment when we received it. When Aris flunked out, Crief had an empty bunk. So I seized the opportunity. As to switching partners, I thought I mentioned the other week, I am already viewed with suspicion both here and in the community at large, I can’t afford to be seen to pass simply because Harry Potter is my partner.”
Draco uncoiled himself from his position and stood, taking the offered hand, acutely aware that he was at least 4 inches shorter than the strange Greek God standing before him and trying desperately to appear the posh aristocrat his father trained him to be. “Pleasure to meet you.”
Harry’s smile was infectious, and Draco almost started to feel better as he was led out of the restaurant, till he turned and saw Goldstein’s narrowed eyes following them. He mustn’t forget. He was trash. He had no right to this.
“Shut up and come here.” Harry unbuckled his belt and pulled out his cock. He had that possessive gleam in his eye Draco loved.
“I wanted to be an airline pilot,” Potter said as he rolled onto his back, staring at the ceiling.
He looked around. His flat was fine, functional...sofa here, telly there, a fridge full of cold takeaway. True he had jumpers, trainers, napkins, and abandoned glasses  strewn about the place but it’s not like there was anyone to impress.
“In a file sir!”
“But Draco,” Harry said quietly. “Why not? Just now... You clearly want me too. It makes sense, you and I. Surely you see that.”
Amani and Dave began to clear the coffee table, while B.J. grabbed Blaise and got him to help pull some chairs into the main room.
Time passed, and he felt rather than saw a blur of laughter, friends, a career, pride….
“I don’t know mother. Perhaps.”
“Sorry Cy.” Draco sprang up, decision made. He had to find out what Harry was doing here. “I’ll just go fetch you a new one.” Draco called over his shoulder, already heading towards the bar. He was stopped by a hand gripping his arm and he turned to see Pansy.
Harry sat on his bed, leaning in and looking desperate to get Draco to talk.
“Isn’t there a coffee shop or something down the street?”
“Oh, laugh all you want, but notice how I never have to get up to get snacks?”
Neville crouched down next to him.
Draco was dumbstruck.
“I dunno.”
Harry paused and looked away.
“I don’t want you to leave me again.”
helps keep me right and keeps me motivated. Not to mention her influence on the story as it's being created.  Also to one of the best beta's I know, I am unworthy of her talent,
Oh god…He’d missed it. He’d been so busy listening to the hatred in his own head, he couldn’t see the love in front of him and now it was too late. He’d become everything they’d thought he was. He was a selfish bastard:he was a piece of shit, and Harry
“I would,” said Harry as he sat.
“This looks lovely,” Potter said, as he cast the standard spells to detect flaws in the homes magical framework.
Draco took him by the wrist.
“If I knew where to start, maybe.” Draco looked thoughtful. “I don’t know, maybe not. It’s like potions in a way, but I’d be lost in that world.” He smiled. ”What would you do if you lived as a muggle?”
Draco looked around, he wasn’t sure where he should go. He spent most nights at Harry’s, only going to the Manor grab fresh clothes and say hello to Mother.
“Yeah, just let me wrap a few things up and make sure Lila’s got things covered, I can probably join you for a little bit. Where’s everyone else?”
Then Harry heard words that were eerily familiar, “One good thing, just for right now.”
“Wait, are you a…”
He took a deep breath and took one long last look in the mirror. This was it. This was his chance. He was going to put it all on the line and hoped he could get back the man he loved. This man that had driven him insane when they were boys and, now that they were men, made him mad with desire, and frustration, and love. If he played his cards right, maybe tonight he’d get to touch him again, hold him, feel him laugh into Harry’s kisses and sigh against his neck when he was content. He wanted to look into those grey eyes and see what he felt reflected back at him, to be wanted again, he wanted... FUCK—he looked over at the clock. It was 7:15. He had to go. God, he hoped he wasn’t too late.
FUCK. Draco’s back hit the wall and his hand flew to his mouth.
“Yeah, just a sec,” said Amani, digging through her purse. “Cy, I think you still have my lighter.”
Draco stared at him with raised eyebrows waiting for the boy to catch up.
Harry looked crestfallen as he turned away, running his hands through his already disheveled hair. “But we agreed… we
“Whoa...Hey there tiger, this shirt cost more than your entire flat.” Blaise said good naturedly.
Harry finally exploded. “HOW DARE YOU! Look, I may not have been perfect goddamnit, but you have NO right to barge into my home and cast judgment on me or what I had with Draco! I tried to make him happy, I thought he
“You made Narcissa Malfoy a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?” Pansy looked incredulous.
“Stop whining Potter! I thought you’d be happy having a room to yourself. Now you can do whatever you like in it without anyone in your way. Much more private. One good thing about Martin, he may be an imbecile but he doesn’t—”
Draco did, and the touch of Potter’s hand was electric.
“Nope. I’m simply trying to study so I can pass this bloody year.”
He had to get out of here. He looked over at Harry, who was in the midst of what appeared to be a wildly entertaining conversation with Lee and Neville. Draco couldn’t take him away from all these people while he was so happy.
“Piss off.” He turned on the faucet, ran some water through his hair and washed his face. He reached past her just as she was hooking her bra and grabbed a towel. He patted his face dry, set the towel down, and turned, leaning against the counter with his arms crossed. She slipped her arms into a swishy black and white floral wrap dress. As she tied it at the waist Draco asked, ”Wasn’t I with you when you bought that? At that street fair?”
“Well I’m glad he did!” she shouted. “Someone had to! And honestly, the fact that he was so honest about it made me think that just
“Aaaanyway...,” B.J. said, “What Pansy was trying to say is, Draco, you aren’t complete right now. You don’t have a life of your own to be proud of. You don’t love yourself. How is anybody supposed to be in relationship with half of a person? Yes, your partner is there for you when you stumble or feel broken. But Draco, you haven’t even been trying to be someone strong enough to be there for him as an equal partner. You need to cleanse yourself of all these lies that society has taught you to believe about yourself.”
“Good morning, love!”
“Oh...How nice.” Goldstein said with measured courtesy. He schooled his features into something akin to a charming smile, “Well, I suppose I’ll leave you gentlemen to your evening.” He reached into his pocket and pulled out a card. “Here’s all my information, Harry. I’d love for you to get in touch some time soon when you’re—” he gave a little cough and a wink”—free.”
“Shhh baby… Merlin you’re gorgeous. Why don’t we leave and go back to mine? I want you…”
“Well what?”
Molly smiled, “He’s my third.”
“Poor baby,” she said in a mocking tone as she gently patted his face, “Maybe next time don’t be a gigantic idiot and get the crap beaten out of you.”
and he was gone.
“Yes, you do.”
He reached up and pushed in a finger beside his tongue and gently began to work Draco open. He moaned as Draco began pushing himself back impaling himself on Harry's tongue and finger. Harry slipped in a second and Draco screamed.
“I don’t want to get into it, okay? It was painful enough back then. I should never have gone poking around and opened up that wound again...for either of us.”
He dropped his cigarette, snuffed it out and smiled. “Maybe another time yeah?”
As Harry plopped himself onto the couch BJ had just occupied, he thought about his impending meeting with Draco. He needed to make an impression...Fuck what was he going to wear? Stricken with panic, he shot up from his seat and all but ran to the kitchen, tapping the floo lantern.
“Yup, still a posh bastard” Draco smirked. “Guys, I’d like you to meet my good friend Blaise.”
There was an awkward pause.
Harry stopped, looked him in the eye and said, “Because in the end we won, we are surrounded by love and we live in the world we fought for. If I crumbled, I would dishonour the people that died to get us here.”
“Mmmm, you want this bad, don’t you baby?” Draco closed his eyes and nodded, reveling in the sensations washing over him. “Say it.” B.J. swooped in and kissed him fiercely, claiming his mouth and taking what he wanted. He pulled back abruptly, and Draco, suddenly bereft of touch, moved to follow. “I need you to say it. I need you to tell me what you want to do here. I don’t want to push you too hard or take advantage of you, but I do want to make you feel good, and God, do I want to get off with you. I’m aching right now, but I need you to tell me what you want.”
“Actually. No.”
Draco was begging. He didn’t look happy, but he wanted it.
Molly smiled.
He turned back to Draco, “Call me if you need me.” And then, he was gone.
“How did he contact the D.O.L.T?”
Harry let go and pulled away as if Draco was a live wire and he’d been shocked. He put his hands in the air in a gesture of submission. “I’m off! I’m off! Waffles please!”
“Oh you think that’s bad do you? My middle name is Jackson, my last name is Allman. My parents named me B.J. All Man, and then they had the gall to be surprised when I told them I was gay,” he smiled.
Draco watched him position himself on his back under a sink to check for “water-born undesirables” and all Draco would think was
Harry laughed, “You’d better not be toying with me, Malfoy.” He whipped him down an alley, pulled him close and Apparated them home.
“OH. MY. GOD.” Harry looked at him as if seeing him truly for the first time in weeks. “This is about Laurie. How did I not see it? I’m such an idiot. When you feel afraid you tuck your knees up on your bed.”
“He’s just got a touch of colic I think.” She offered the baby to Narcissa.
“Exactly, it’s still morning for fifteen minutes. Cut me some slack, I had a very
“BACK TO THE FUTURE!” Patrick roared, launching the pen towards the couch.
“I’m here, I’m here!” said Molly as she grabbed the cloth off of Draco’s shoulder and scooped the baby out of Harry’s arms.
“Ughh...I’m exhausted. I’m glad to be in my own shoes again though.”
to fight that Death Eater scum, but you always looked so sexy when—”
“Are you ok?”
“Yeah,” Harry stiffened and turned bright red. “But I think maybe this was a mistake. Sorry.”
mum buried her with.”
It was Anthony Goldstein.
“What are you on about, Potter, I do not.”
“That’s my name. Benjamin Jackson. But my friends call me B.J.”
The thought that Draco had wanted this to happen, that he had anticipated this moment, drove Harry mad and he dived forward, pulling Draco against him, claiming Draco’s mouth. “Fuck,” he said breathlessly, “I forgot how good you taste.”
Harry grinned from ear to ear and kissed him.
“It was a slow day.”  Potter smirked as he stepped inside and looked at his stack of parchment. “It looks like you hired Georgiou to do the remodel, very nice. It says ‘No major alterations,” very good. Well, then this is just a walkthrough to ensure that everything in your home is safe and that the integrity of the wards and muggle repelling charms remain intact.”
“I’m just picking up some things for my mother,” Draco murmured as he tried to pass.
“Really? Me too…” He put hand on Harry’s arm and said, “I’m surprised I haven’t seen you around before. We should get together sometime. When are you free? We could do tomorrow for brunch if you like. I also know a really great Thai place, we could go out to dinner next Friday. Do you like Thai?” He began to brush his thumb back and forth on Harry’s bicep.
“Do you think he’s devolving? Draco, as a potions master I need your opinion on what she used.”
to know. All this time what had hurt was that he couldn’t believe that what he’d felt for Draco was a lie, that someone could create such a callously convincing mockery of open, easy vulnerability and safety, of tender, gentle, easy intimacy, of love and home. He couldn’t believe he’d been wrong all those months. But then, that night, it seemed one moment Draco was on him, passionate and wanting, and then Harry had turned his back for what felt like a second and then found him getting fucked by a stranger in an alley by a skip. He could never reconcile those two things with the same man, and if he’d been that wrong once, how could he ever trust his feelings and instincts again?
He Apparated to a safe point near the bowling alley and all but ran for the front doors. He was immediately struck by the murmurs of conversation throughout the building, the deep thrum of balls rolling down the lanes and the loud clatter of pins tumbling over. The place was crowded and his heart was pounding as he thrust himself deeper into the room, searching for that distinctive white-blond hair. Then he saw it, down near the end. He began to head towards it when he froze. Draco was sitting in some guy’s lap, one arm draped around his shoulder laughing as he leaned in to kiss him. He was too late.
“Wonderful,” B.J. said, standing up quickly and extending a hand to help Draco up.
They walked outside and headed in the direction of Harry’s flat. Harry leaned in to kiss him and abruptly pulled away “Ugh...You know I hate it when you smoke!”
“Draco! I don’t hear you getting ready! Seven minutes, god damnit, or I'm going to come in there, Petrificus you, and dress you myself. You decide.”
Then he looked down and realised he was still in his pants and a vest. At least they were boxer briefs, he thought.
“Fuck yes, Draco please…”
Draco arched off the bed screaming, “You Harry! It’s...ah…yours,” he panted. “FUCK! Yours Harry.”
“Don’t play dumb with me. You know what I’m asking.”
“Another time Laurie.” Draco heard fumbling at the door handle, and suddenly light from the hallway flooded the room as Harry and Laurie spilled through the door disheveled and thoroughly debauched. “Fuck!”
Draco stilled. “You first.”
So for those of you playing spot the Sherlock references, there are two more in this chapter! I hope that I am successful in trying to convey the responsibility they each had in the failure of the relationship the first time around, without excusing their individual mistakes and problems. Considering the dark place this beast started in and that I cannot abide unhappy endings, I was worried it might be difficult to get to this place. Also, can I just say, I really want a B.J.? ( The person, not the activity, get your minds out of the gutter! Actually on second thought, don't, mine needs company down there ;) )  One more week!
He let Harry’s cock go.
Pansy held up her hand wiggling her fingers, “Oh, it’s bowling night, love. I trimmed my nails this morning.” Her fingernails were short but still a deep shimmery red. She reached under her seat and pulled out a cherry red bag that had the words ‘Ball Buster’ embroidered on the front and pulled out her ruby red glittered bowling ball. “Be warned, I don’t like to lose.” She turned, “Cy? Will your team be needing a Queen?”
------------
“Hey, everything okay?” Draco asked.
“HARRY! Are you even listening to me!”
Harry, the idiot, looked delighted. “Great! I’ll make us some reservations! I’m stuffed, do you want any more of this?”
“Great, just great. And this is the person you think I need to go to for guidance, Pansy?” Draco was starting to get frustrated now.
“After everything I did to keep him safe, he just TOLD you? He had no idea what you’d do or who you’d tell! That fucking idiot!”
B.J. sighed exasperatedly. “I
Draco was an adult, and somehow he was spending his off mornings playing a 10 year old video game with his best friend.
“Oh!” Harry exclaimed, looking between them. “Uh… yeah. Let’s go. Sounds good.”
“Harry?”
“Oooh, I like him…” Pansy said.
“God that’s so embarrassing.” Draco flushed. “You were asking about things you could really do, not things from childish stories.”
His arms were pinned above his head as B.J. began licking and sucking on the side of Draco’s neck. He heard himself moan as he heard B.J. murmur, “God I was hoping you’d be here tonight.” Teeth came up to nip his earlobe while one hand went down to cup at his crotch through his denims. “I’ve been thinking about you all week, you gorgeous bastard.”
Draco felt a thrill as he turned to Harry, “Harry, what is this?” This was not what he expected this place to be, it seemed wonderful, and well...fun.
“Draco, are you sure this is a good idea?”
to keep you safe. So shut it with this nobody's ever loved me crap. Now, I won’t deny that the boy wonder loved you in a way nobody ever has before, and I will admit that despite all my reservations, he was good for you. I want you to get him back Draco, if we can manage it, I really do. But the sun does not rise and set out of Harry Potter’s chosen arsehole!”
B.J. understood and kissed Draco’s cheek. He pulled out and began thrusting into him in earnest.
Kristinabird
“I didn’t think you wanted people to know about us. I said that for you. I realized the moment that it came out of my mouth that I was wrong. But then you left and you wouldn't respond. I’m sorry, I didn’t call you here just to talk to you, but maybe it was a happy accident. I still need your work on the potion that turned Victor Canis, but… if you want, could you maybe do it at home? If not it’s ok. But it's New Year's Eve and I thought maybe you could spend it with me. If you want…”
Harry put the ears on Dracos perfectly coiffed blond hair, ensuring that in a few hours in this heat if he took it off, he would look thoroughly ridiculous.
Narcissa threw it over her shoulder and shifted Orion so she was massaging and patting his back.
Harry ducks, “Wha--”
Then he saw it. Anthony Goldstein had clearly been hitting on him. Of course this stuck out in Draco’s mind.
to help complete this life I have and make it ours. I’m not a frightened, depressed kid anymore. I’m a strong, independent man, and that’s better, because it means I can be a partner. I’m still far from perfect, I’m still impatient and particular and sulky and a whole host of other things. But if you want to try with me, I’m all in, Harry.”
But had he spent too long feeling justified in his hatred towards Draco? Had he really ignored the pain and worry Draco carried on his shoulders for the length of their relationship? Harry fisted his fingers through hair and threw himself onto the nearest armchair.
“There, I guess that’ll have to do,” Malfoy says, stepping back. “ Avery should be here soon.”
He watched himself speed up as Draco clawed desperately at his back, grasping his arse and helping slam Harry’s hips against his. He saw himself come, pushing himself in to the hilt with a groan and shuddering as he filled Draco with everything he had.  Draco kissed his cheek, his jaw, his shoulder and nuzzled into his neck again as Harry grew soft inside him and fell asleep.
Draco smiled, “Look, I was just about to grab a drink and then go back to my friends. Would you care to join me?”
he said. We wanted to like you, Malfoy. We really did, because for a year we saw the smile Harry had slowly lost in the war come back to him. So we tried Malfoy. But you, are fucking DONE NOW.”
, if I’d known just how fucking hurt and miserable he was. If only I’d seen it or if he would have just
“Draco, I suggest you follow me, I think today is going to be an amazing day.” He smiled as he linked Draco’s arm in his. He walked them down the cobblestone street and suddenly Draco saw a castle in the distance.
B.J. finally succeeded in pulling Neville free, just as Neville spat directly in his face.
Tilly bowed low as two house-elves levitated Lucius Malfoy into the room and deposited him into the chair opposite Narcissa.
“What?” Harry asked.
“Don’t you?” Draco laughed. “Honestly, this is so ridiculous. To think, I thought when I was accepted into the training academy, that I might actually be taken seriously, but NO apparently I still need looking after—”
Draco groaned. He knew it was too good to be true. “Really?”
“Look, I’m a great friend. I brought you to your favorite place, got you champagne, let you finish it so you could take the edge off, and ordered you a second so you’d have something to comfort you as I dragged out all the awful details. Now, here’s what we’re going to do.” She took a sip of her champagne and held out a finger ticking them off as she spoke. “We are going to figure out: A, what happened; B, why it happened; and C, what we’re going to do about it.”
“Hey.” Harry looked uncertain. “Happy Birthday, Draco. 28. That’s a big year.”
He saw
of all things, and to top it all off, your boyfriend saved the world and you have to be afraid of being seen with him. Do you
“Well, this mostly seems in order. But you haven’t shown me everything, have you?”
But with the weight of that admission at the forefront of his mind, panic overcame him, and he took a step back from both Draco and the Pensieve. He instead turned on his heel and Apparated.
“Don’t flatter yourself. I wasn’t planning on it.”
“Sorry I’m a little late, love,” the stranger says setting his bag down, rummaging through it and pulling out a vial. “Just be a tick.”
“Potter? What are you doing here?”
“Case last month with the cursed tea kettles.”
It isn’t long before the bell rings and Harry answers to…not Avery. ‘Shit,’ he thinks, as the stranger walks into the flat like he owns the place.
“How did you even figure out where I live, let alone how to get through my wards?” Harry asked, desperately stomping down the flare of jealousy that surged through him at B.J.’s admission.
“Patrick! Stop pointing at your butt-clock and draw SOMETHING ELSE!” screamed Amani.
“Harry, stop.”
Dave, and we took a vote. You’re mental,” Draco said. “Oh, and you better take whatever Fosters you don’t drink with you. Last time I had about 15 cans clogging up my fridge for weeks till it occurred Patrick to hand them out to the homeless.”
Draco whipped off his apron and rushed after him. Once outside, he saw Harry walking briskly toward what Draco knew was the nearest safe Apparition point. He didn’t even know what he was doing or what he expected to happen. He only knew that this man pulled at him like gravity and now that he’d seen him, he couldn’t just let him walk off.
“Is it? How?”
“I was afraid to go outside. I didn't have a life. All I had was you, a basement full of goblins, and shame. But you never noticed. B.J. has never made me feel that way. He made me realise I needed to be me and be proud of it.He encouraged me to make something more of myself. You were content to just ignore what didn’t fit into your fantasy of a perfect life, and I was dying, Harry!”
Harry looked confused. “She? Draco wha—”
“No it doesn’t!”
Draco looked down embarrassed and tucked himself away. He couldn’t look up.
Draco stilled.
“NO! I said I want to be Princess Consuela Banana Hammock!” Cy shouted as he batted at Patrick, who was entering names into the computer.
She held out her hand.
“You lifted your elbow off the table! Pansy! You saw him!”
“Hi, Draco Malfoy. I’m the chef here. Nice to see you again, Goldstein.”
Draco gathered up people’s empty dishes and walked them to the kitchen. As he rinsed them and set them in the dishwasher, he thought it really was amazing the things these muggles came up with. Growing up he was surrounded by people that made it seem like Muggles lived like barbarians with no means of maintaining a civilised culture without magic. He’d come to discover quite the opposite. This machine in itself was practically magic. Not only that, they had some inventions that far outstripped Wizarding methods. What the hell were wizards still doing faffing about with giant stacks of books when there was Google? Yes, granted, you still needed books for deeper research, but you could find the answer to all manner of simple questions with just a few keystrokes. And now that he’d seen a football match on telly, listening to Quidditch on the WWN would never be the same. Cell phones were amazing, you could communicate with a person from a distance without needing access to a fireplace, and why were they still using fire for heat and light anyway? It was insane. He was starting to think that Hogwarts ought to make Muggle Studies a mandatory course. He laughed to himself as he poured the powder detergent into the dishwasher and set it. What would the Wizarding world think of him now? ‘Draco Malfoy: advocate for Muggle technology, better education and the repeal of outdated Wizarding ideas.’
“Alright, then.” B.J.looked at him seriously. “Don’t make me regret this.”
“I was hungry, I’d been hearing great things about this place’s brunch so I thought I’d check it out. Trust me, if I had any idea you worked here I’d have eaten cold takeaway.” Harry started walking again.
“Draco, would you just stop whining!” Harry stopped walking abruptly and turned as Draco slammed into him from the residual momentum of being pulled. It made his ear hat thing slip off to the side. He righted it swiftly. If he had to wear the damn thing, it should at least sit properly.
Draco felt a rush of emotion. As he looked into Harry’s hopeful green eyes, his breath caught and he stuttered, “I...I missed you too. I never got to apologise for what I did to you. I tried but back then you didn’t want...Look, there’s no excuse for what I did, and I hurt you so badly. I never meant to do that, I wasn’t thinking…or maybe I was...but I never meant to hurt you. I’m sorry.”
Draco pulled his hand back as if he’d been burned. “I’m sorry, I… why are you here?”
“Darling! Why didn’t you meet me in the hall?” she smiled, ever the gracious hostess.
It's Sunday again! Time to find out what happens when Draco see Harry again!
“Morning gents!”
Cy flinched. “Ughh how are you so chipper...it’s disgusting. Draco, will you please punch them? I would, but my head hurts.”
“Sure,” he said, and smiled that little smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “Whatever you’d like, Harry.”
“Just pick them off!”
“No I don’t!” Draco tossed the book onto stupid Martin’s bed and stood up, brushing his hair out of his eyes and pointing a finger at Harry, slowly backing him against the wall. “Let’s get one thing straight: you don’t know shit about me, Potter. I am not your roommate, I am not your trainee partner, and I am certainly not your fucking friend!” Draco paused, out of breath from his tirade, and suddenly aware of how close he was to Potter.
He looked up now to see B.J. on the couch, engaged in what looked to be a fascinating conversation with Blaise on god only knows what. Pansy was sitting on the floor perched between his knees as he rubbed her shoulders. Those two got on like a house on fire. He had thought Pansy was bad when she wanted to invade some aspect of his life, but when the two of them got together, he was doomed every time.
“What?” Harry shifted to look at Draco, confused.
, Harry. I thought if you two just talked that maybe…”
This man must be a muggle then. How nice, he thought, blowing smoke into the crisp night air. Oh the irony that now, only among muggles, was he truly free.
“Oh, ok If you need help practicing sparring, I think the training room is open, maybe we could—”
“Oh! Busy! I see! Busy with what pray tell? Because you haven’t been working overtime, you haven’t been out with Ron and I for lunch in ages, you haven’t been to the Weasley’s, you missed Lee’s birthday…”
Harry was nervous as they walked back to the lanes. People gave Draco curious looks, unsure of who this new person was, but B.J. hopped up immediately, and reached a hand out for Harry’s, shaking it warmly. “Harry! Glad you could join us. You’re a bit late, I was beginning to think you weren’t coming.”
“Oh.” The silver continued to rattle.
“You can’t? Why, because you’re afraid to lose? Fine. I say we play—”
“What the hell, Potter! I was talking-” he takes in Harry’s expression and pauses, “What’s wrong?”
Harry held his hand firmly, refusing to let him slip away. “What did you say, Draco?”
“It’s with Laurie from the administration office, I don’t know if you’ve met. But—”
“Be nice to me or I’ll tell the wait staff to 86 the mimosas.”
“Because you aren’t cleared for field work.”
Harry looks at himself in the mirror, running fingers through fine blond hair he never in a million years thought he’d get to touch. He gazes into silver-grey eyes and can’t help but smile as he gets to look his fill for once. For the first time in his life he sees a warm, wanting affectionate smile on this gorgeous face and it makes his heart ache.
"I know." Harry smiled. "Come on love, this is so exciting!" Harry took Draco’s hand and proceeded to pull him down a cobblestone street lined with quaint, bustling shops. It wasn’t unlike Diagon Alley, with all of the colourful shoppers and families hurrying about.
“In just my pyjama bottoms?”
Hey all!  Hope you liked it! A bit short this week ;) but it was a natural ending place for this segment. See you next Sunday!  Feel free to give me your thoughts! Or Not! Just grateful you are here. <3
As they made their way down Diagon amongst the glares of the Wizarding shoppers, B.J. turned to him and said, “Fuck this. No wonder you’re mental. We’ll show these fuckers.” Draco looked at him and was awed by the look of vicarious anger on B.J.’s face. He really was lucky he’d found him.
“Draco,” Pansy warned, “you haven’t let him finish.”
“Yes,” Draco said, detaching his mouth from Harry’s neck and whimpering into it. “You Harry, only you. Fuck, only you Harry.”
Draco made the tea just the way Harry liked it and gestured for them to take a seat.
Draco stilled.
Draco Malfoy is worth trusting! You didn’t see his
“Um, okay...Look, Hermione you have to understand, back then I...I was in a bad place. I had a terrible job, no real home, the Wizarding  world hated me and I thought I was worthless. I didn’t think I mattered to him... not really, and I was just so scared of the day he’d leave me with nothing. Then there was this guy, a muggle, and he made me feel just like any other bloke not dirty or evil...and I cheated. I had sex with him Hermione, and Harry...he saw.”
that you might actually figure out how to communicate and try to do something about it!”
Hermione had also purchased a tube of product whose price made his eyeballs pop out of his head, but she had shushed him, running it through his hair with her fingers and taming it into something she called “sexy and windswept”. He mimicked her actions now and had to admit, the effect was quite appealing.
A grin spread across her face. “I knew you’d say that. That’s why I enlisted some help. Hey!” She waved at someone behind Draco. “You can come over now.” Draco turned around and saw a man he hadn’t noticed before sitting alone with his back to them. He stood up, grabbed his drink, and turned to walk over to their table. It was B.J.
“NO! I am done listening to you. You made it clear on Christmas when you told the Weasleys you invited me as a “work colleague”. I took my things, and I left. I am tired of being a secret! I am tired of you hiding our relationship. It’s done. I’m done. I responded to this call because I thought it was a work emergency. But this… Calling me in just to talk to me? I’m sorry.”
Harry was confused. “What do you mean, what am I going to do about it?”
At that moment, Harry looked up and caught Draco’s eye. He smiled, turned to Lee and gestured for him to take his place. He walked over to Draco and said, “Hey, you ‘bout ready to go?”
“Anybody want one?”
see how
A few days after that however, he was sitting on Pansy’s couch having a panic attack about finding work. He had no idea what he was good at, or where he should look, or where to even begin. Pansy’s answer, as it was to most things, was brunch and mimosas.
and they all huddled up in the living room. Blaise was curled up in Draco’s favourite armchair, B.J. and Draco were seated at opposite ends of the couch, and Pansy laid across it, her feet in B.J.’s lap, her head in Draco’s.
Harry awoke to a hand delicately brushing through his hair and a tender kiss placed sweetly to his temple. In all his life he’d never been awoken so gently and with such warmth and affection. Growing up, it had been a banging on his cupboard door; in school, it was either on his own or Ron chucking a pillow at him and telling him they were late as they frantically tried to find trousers and books in time for classes; and recently, it was to the harsh, echoing blare of the alarm spells he set.
Draco had gone to leave, and Harry had asked, “Why are you even here?”
. And now I find you hiding out, sharing a room with fucking Crief! The class incompetent who I
Just because he was beginning to like Draco didn’t mean he had to share everything with him. If he could make this arrest on his own he’d have that promotion in the bag. He could think of plenty of fun ways to try to make it up to Draco later, right now he had to focus on Oz, and he had a plan…
“Okay, I love you.”
B.J. raised an eyebrow and slowly took a sip of tea, meeting Harry’s eyes in a challenge.
,” Draco said, grabbing another book at random, pulling his legs up and pretending to flip through it for a reference he didn’t need.
“Thank you Harry, I really appreciate it. But I think it’s best that I study and train on my own, so that when I graduate training nobody thinks it was because I had the help of the ‘Golden Boy’.”
So this chapter began by frustrating me to no end, but then quickly began to fall into a place I really love. For a while there I was afraid I wouldn't get this finished on time, but all your love made me determined not to let you guys down. :) I hope you enjoy it.
“Oi Malfoy! You look hot! Why don’t you roll up your sleeves?” shouted Finnigan from across the table smiling. “Oh...that’s right. Nevermind!” and quickly turned back to Hannah.
Harry was in Diagon Alley. It looked to be early evening. Harry was never in Diagon anymore, not if he could avoid it. He tried to get his bearings. He could see Gringotts, The Magical Menagerie, Flourish and Blott’s...Then he heard a woman shriek in the direction of Mulpepper’s. He turned to see Draco walking out of the shop with his purchases, clearly just running an errand after work.
“Is that a movie title?” Amani asked.
Draco chuckled and turned his gaze back to Harry, who was now visibly fidgeting, one hand in his pocket, the other running through his hair.
“You’re getting better at that,” said Garrett as he and Amani walked in from the living room. “Have you been practising?”
“Not today. I’m sorry.” He added sugar, stirring vigorously with one hand as he grabbed and bit into a scone with the other.
"Draco, you promised you’d play along and behave when we got here."
Wasn’t this this the night Draco had fucked that arsehole?
“Draco, stop.” Draco stilled at the calm, steady tone in Harry’s voice.
“I suppose it is.”
Draco deflated. He looked away and said simply, “I love him. I’m in love with him. I think I always will be.” He refused to meet her gaze. “Can I go now?”
“You wanted to be an astronaut!”
She smiled back, “Of course you do. I love you too.”
It was Draco’s turn to fidget, but she continued, “He never really said much, I didn’t know why, but he was just different, content in a way he’d never had the luxury to be before. So, I’m sorry and you’re right; it isn’t my place, and I wouldn’t even ask if you’d seemed at all the way Ron and Neville seem to think you are. But you’re different too now, aren’t you?”
As he kissed Harry, Laurie opened his eyes and looked directly at Draco with an intense gaze that clearly said, ‘
A sudden eruption of cheering and wailing pulled Harry back into the moment.
“Draco, I’m sorry.”
need you to leave.”
“Maybe your paperwork is wrong. Are you even sure those plans are up to date? When I bought this house it was a mess!”
“WHAT? NO! Why would you pick that? Nobody even LIKES Monopoly! Monopoly is where friendships go to die!” Patrick exclaimed, clearly dismayed.
Harry pulled out of the Pensieve with a gasp.
The bell rang at 1701 Burnham Way, and Draco scrambled to answer it. He had never bought his own home before, much less a fixer-upper. The Manor was his property, but it wasn’t his home, not anymore. He would maintain and care for it until the day he died, but Draco wanted a fresh start.
Harry closed his eyes.
“What do you want me to say Hermione? I’m not like you! You’ve always been so good, so perfect! You’ve always known what to say, so tell me, what would an angel say? The devil wants to know.” His voice was dripping with contempt and sarcasm. It was petty and he was lashing out to protect himself like he had as a child, but some habits die hard.
a horrifying crapfest. Along the wall directly behind the host stand were stoves and cooktops at which a team of people rushed about scrambling, frying, chopping, mixing, and grilling. A flustered man he presumed to be the brunch chef, was flailing about this way and that, people were bumping into each other; it looked like utter chaos. The blond TV chef would be appalled but it felt like the perfect metaphor for his life. Pansy grabbed his hand and dragged him along as the waitress led them to their table.
Harry obediently lifted his hands in a gesture of submission. “I’m sorry, I got carried away. I shouldn’t have done that.”
“Jesus Christ! Pansy said you were thick, but I always thought she was exaggerating!” B.J. threw his hands in the air, clearly frustrated. “I
“Nah,” B.J. said as he leaned back in his chair and took a swig of his beer, “This is more fun, looks like Garrett’s gonna burst a blood vessel.”
“Get your hand out of there Cy, or I will cut it off!” He whipped around and whapped him on the hand with a mixing spoon just as Cy was about to pick some bacon off of his bacon, truffle, and 5 cheese macaroni and cheese.
Narcissa quirked an eyebrow. Harry would know that eyebrow quirk anywhere and he smiled.
Draco felt a little ill again, and was more than a little wary, “You mean Neville didn’t tell you all about it?”
He turned back to B.J. who had an eyebrow quirked at him. Draco smiled and gestured with his head toward the door. B.J.’s smile grew and he nodded. He turned to excuse himself from his friends and Draco set down his glass and walked out the front door.
“Draco isn’t yours,” Harry said calmly, his eyes hard as he glared at the man in his kitchen.
“He...He asked me to leave,” Harry croaked.
So without further ado, it's SUNDAY AGAIN!!!
Draco groaned, “Ahhh, I want you to make me come and I...hmmm…FUCK...I want you...want you to fuck me...make me feel good...make me forget…”
The look on Draco’s face was sheer relief as they made their rounds to say goodnight.
“I love you. You’re an idiot. But I love you. No more secrets. And if you want me to come home you need to tell people it's our home.”
“That’s what I was trying to tell you. It seems Mr. Canis here was given a rare potion that turned him into a dog, but he maintains some of his human mind and magical abilities.”
Cy snorted as if the idea of Draco having servants was amusing, “Yeah, but why don’t you just do them later? Come sit with us.”
This is a song fic based on Criminal by Fiona Apple. I'd like to thank my brilliant Alpha/Beta/friend
care about Draco. I’m not sure you even deserve him if you’re going to sit here and give up. But I’m here because that daft bastard is so in love with you that he can’t see straight, and as big of an arse I may seem to you, I just want my best mate to be happy. Draco is incredible. And make no mistake, if you don’t do something about your “feelings” someday soon someone is going to figure out how to make him forget all about you. And mark my words, when it happens I’m going to be right there cheering them on. So this is your shot, Potter. Take my advice or don’t. But if you do, you’d better be prepared to work at that relationship.
What had he expected? Damnit. There was a reason he had shoved this all down and hidden it away. He had been so proud of himself, of his life, and now he felt waves of shame and self-hatred rolling over him and threatening to drag him back out to sea. No, he thought, he couldn’t go back there.  Fuck, he wanted a cigarette. Stupid Pansy had made both he and B.J. quit. He pushed himself off the wall and walked back toward Hudson’s. With each step, he tried to shove Harry back into that box in his soul he hid him in. With each step, he tried to re-amputate all of his longing to be loved by a partner, his yearning to have someone who would always be by his side, on his team. Well, he just didn’t and he wouldn’t. That’s all there was to it. Time to move forward. He opened the door and stepped into Hudson’s.
“Goldstein.” Draco stood and held out his hand politely, but Goldstein didn’t move to take it.
Harry ached to be a part of that. To come home to that flat and to belong there. Maybe some nights he’d shower, dress and pop down the road to Hudson’s for dinner. He imagined what it would be like watching Draco’s face light up and wink as Harry took a seat where he could watch him work, confident and in his element. He’d meet Draco’s friends and listen to them rave about Draco’s culinary skills. Harry would listen to them gush while trying to keep his eyes off that radiant blond hair, and that graceful body as he wove through his kitchen with ease. Then maybe he’d go home and wait for Draco to stumble in at the end of a long night. Harry would have a glass of wine ready for Draco and their favorite show queued up on the telly. They’d sit and Harry would rub Draco’s feet while Draco listened to him talk about his day.
“Damn right, you shouldn’t. Nothing has changed with you, has it? God, I’m such a fucking idiot.”
Harry closes his eyes and focuses on his breathing as Draco runs his fingers gently through his hair, then down his shoulders smoothing his shirt and then, fuck, grabbing his waistband and adjusting his trousers. If this man had ever,
“I brought you left over pizza!” Potter said as he erupted into the office.
Draco looked up at him. He looked tired, resigned, nothing like the laughing Draco he’d heard through the door earlier. Harry was about to take back his request. He had no right. Then Draco finished his drink and silently took the Pensieve from Harry. He set it on the table, took a seat, leaning forward with his head in his hands. His hair fell down past his eyes as he took a soft breath. He stared thoughtfully into the empty basin, presumably selecting which memories to include.
Draco swallowed, “Okay, I uh, thanks.” He couldn’t look him in the eye.
-------------
“Yeah.” Harry beamed. “That sounds nice.”
Cy caught it deftly and said, “Why didn’t you just draw a Delorean?”
“Oh you’re one to judge!” B.J. laughed, “ Draco huh? That’s a new one. Besides, your initials spell DAM.”
A massive thank you to
“I won’t.”
“Harry! Is that you?”
“No! Jesus Christ, Nev! Let me go! I have to find him!”
“You’re kidding! How did you even notice!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Can you tell her to please hurry? I’m sorry Tilly, but she always does this.”
Harry got up to leave, but Draco put an arm out to stop him.
“Is it?” Draco protested as he let himself be dragged through the crowd. “When you said you won a free trip, I didn’t know it was a Muggle contest!”
Draco heard another thunk and several wet noises along with the rustling of fabric. There was a deep moan and... Dear Morgana, he'd rather suffer the Dementor’s kiss. He pulled his blankets over his head and prayed that they
Draco handed him a glass as Dave made space for his beer and soda and prepared to make his signature shandy. If you could call Fosters and Sprite a shandy.
“Well can I at least—”
He liked this. Here in Potter’s flat he felt safe. It was more of a home than anywhere else had been in a long time. He didn’t know what he was going to do when the day inevitably came that he no longer had it to come home to. But for now, there was curry, and telly, and the scent of Potter’s stupid jumpers as he snuggled against him on the sofa.
“I love you.”
He was crying. He wasn’t protesting, but he was crying, At the time, Harry had thought those pants and sobs were from desperate excitement. But this was different. Draco sounded pained and heartbroken. He had been wrong.
“I think this lot have just about had it for the evening.” Harry turned and looked at Luna. “Is someone getting you home tonight?”
This will not be abandoned!  I am one chapter away from the ending and I promise a new chapter will be published every Sunday until the story is complete :)
“I’m heading out for a smoke before we take off, anyone with me?” B.J. announced.
Draco looked down at him, thunderstruck. “I bought you a ring the day after that.”
“Hey Dave! Come on in! Just in time, dinner is almost ready. Here, you can chuck that in the fridge if you like.”
“With the new influx of erisedicine on the streets, it is imperative that we catch this wizard that calls himself “Oz”.
“NO!…” he shouted quickly, and a bit louder than necessary. “ I have a date… type... thing.”
“I know,” said Harry also seeming to take in their proximity, eyes sparkling and suddenly dangerous. He reached out and grabbed Draco by the shirt, pulling him close. “You’re something better.”
This is a song fic based on Criminal by Fiona Apple. I'd like to thank my brilliant Alpha/Beta/friend
“I meant what I said. I won’t tell.” Draco reassured him.
“Harry, thank god you’re home. He won’t stop crying. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong!”
Everything was still and silent as he looked into those cool blue eyes, and then the kettle began shrieking behind him
“Well, your Floo connection isn’t compromised,” Potter said as he stood and shook the soot out of his hair and made a check on his list. “ Let’s see the upstairs.”
“Merlin, Potter! What is taking you so long!” comes the real Draco’s irritated shout from the other side of the door. “I know you didn’t sick up. First, because I didn’t hear you, and second, because I am positive a taste delicious.”
Oh fuck, he had been wrong.
“Great,” Draco said. “I guess I’ll show you around.”
------------
Something about those words made him shiver and feel uncertain, but he brushed that aside and turned around. “Your alley or mine?”
“I want us to work, no matter how hard it will be sometimes. I want this.”
“Hmm?”
Harry reached over and pulled Draco into a sloppy, languid kiss. “You spoil me, Draco Malfoy.”
“Boys, behave yourselves!” Pansy laughed as she sipped her beer. “We are here to celebrate.”
It's the night of Draco's birthday. Will Harry be there? How will Draco react? Can our boys get it together long enough to maybe make this work?
Draco couldn’t help it; B.J. was right. He was one lucky son of a bitch. He wished he wasn’t gay. He could marry her and be happy forever. But he knew she was hoping to marry for love one day and he would never get in the way of that. He smiled at her. “I’m sorry, Pans. I love you.”
Cy and Patrick turned when B.J. waved them over to their table and Lee mouthed behind his hand “
Draco raised an eyebrow and turned to look back at B.J. who was pretending to watch their friends bowl, but who, Draco could sense, was also observing them from the corner of his eye.
They ordered their meals and discussed
. But if he doesn’t, don’t worry, he has friends that care about him who will be more than happy to show him what you really are. You’re a criminal and you deserve to suffer for your sins.” Goldstein spat at Dracos feet, and with that he was gone.
The rest of the evening went on like that. Draco introduced Harry to each of his friends and sat beside him, pointing out their common areas of interest. They bantered and teased, they invented bizarre games on the spot that left Harry breathless with laughter; they discussed films and music, they made plans amongst each other for the week, and as the evening drew to a close, Harry realised Draco wasn’t beside him. He was off chatting with Garrett. Harry hadn’t even noticed him drift off he was enjoying himself so thoroughly with Amani and Cy. Draco seemed to sense the moment when Harry began to notice, because he turned his head and winked at Harry, giving him a knowing grin. Harry stared at him, bewitched by the confident man gazing at him.
Alone with Harry were the only times he actually believed he was allowed to be happy. The rest of the world was certainly quick to remind him that the happiness won by the war didn’t belong to people like him. But they were right, weren’t they? And yet here he was, dragged along and sweating in the middle of a hot, overpacked muggle club with Harry’s friends. They of course knew and only the knowledge that they would never do anything to hurt Harry made him feel relatively safe when he was forced to accompany Harry on these outings.
There was a loud
“That’s what I thought,” he heard her whisper behind him.
“Avery’s so thick he actually thinks I’m going to help him, he’s hardly a threat. I still don’t understand why-”
“He said he loved me.”
“Oh Harry, do shut up and get ready for your date. Just don’t wake me when you come in, please.”
“Tell me about it.” Draco exhaled, watching the white tendrils curl up toward the street lamp. He took another soothing lungful and closed his eyes.
Harry felt rooted to the spot. He kept his eyes fixed on Draco, terrified that once he let him out of his sight, he’d disappear again. Harry couldn’t bear the thought of Draco being so close and slipping through his fingers again. He looked into Draco’s eyes and—
Narcissa laughed. “What’s his name? Does he love you?”
“Yeah, I hope it’s those strawberries I asked for, because dessert won’t be the same without them.”
“Anthony. You remember Draco,” Harry blurted out.
“Are you going to do better this time?” Harry was startled by Pansy who had just slithered up next to him.
And then Harry laughed and said, “Besides some things are just funny”. He flung some mud into Draco’s white blond hair and before he could even register his shock, Potter was back on his broom, flying towards the trees.
Harry slid off the bed and fell to his knees, taking that dusky pink cock between his lips. He gripped Draco’s arse and held on, desperate and greedy to taste and take as much of the most intimate part of Draco that he could.
What a beautiful fool.
I saw him inside of you.”
“Knock, knock!” came a cheery voice as the door to their little room was cautiously opened.
“How do you even know where I live?”
Draco took a seat and poured himself a cup of tea, manners be damned.
“Is this because you’re a wizard?”
But Harry
“11:45 is hardly morning, Harry.” Draco smirked at him as he spooned some fruit and granola onto a cup of yogurt.
He was supposed to be putting his emotions back in a box. But somehow his brain failed to tell that to his hands, as one reached up and into Harry’s hair and the other snaked down, to his arse, pulling their hips together and grinding against him. Harry made a low moan, deepening the kiss and squeezing Draco’s arse as he pushed his hard length against Draco’s. Draco’s brain finally caught up and sent off the warning signal, he pushed back, holding an arm out and separating them by at least 3 feet.
Harry had gone to hell and back and somehow had come out the other end able to laugh. One afternoon they had been out flying together, there was a light drizzle, and when Harry attempted a Wronski Feint, he slid off his broom and into a mud puddle. Draco rushed over to help only to find Potter laughing. He had asked him then how he did it, how he could still laugh so easily.
Garret leapt up, sweeping his hair into a short ponytail. “I’ll be on Cy’s team, and if we win, I get to pick the game next 5 game nights.”
“Well…?” He twisted to look at Draco.
Harry looked over to B.J. and said, “I have to go.” And with that, he turned and fled out the front door.
“Nope.”
Narcissa suddenly looked more human than Harry had ever seen her, her shoulders relaxed, her expression softened, and the pretense she always wore around her like a cloak was suddenly gone. She took a sip and crossed her ankles.
“Because I’m not an idiot, Potter.”
“A mystery better left unsolved.”
She fidgeted in her seat. “But then, well with Ron and I, and don’t get me wrong, he was happy for us, but he sort of lost the only thing he could ever count on to just be his. But then you…”
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose, “And where is the file Creevey?”
B.J. seemed to read what Draco was thinking because he smiled sadly and said, “Ahhh… you lived with him, did you? Well it looks like you made a right cock-up of things.”
“Ahh! A man after my own heart. Welcome to the club mate, we have t-shirts!” B.J. laughed. “Okay, well, first things first. Do you have a friend you can stay with?”
“Yeah, said you might like it if I stopped by,” Harry said tentatively.
“HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! I HAD CHICKEN! I WANT IT!”
Narcissa froze, clearly caught off guard in the face of Molly Weasley.
“Well that does...complicate things, but—”
Harry felt moisture on his cheeks and pulled back. “Hey, shhh. Why are you crying, love?”
“Harry...please. This isn’t necessary.”
“GAH! What?” Draco flailed suddenly, a flood of sound, color, and motion rushing back into his brain, as he looked toward the person speaking to him.
Harry wanted to pick up the tiny lantern and launch it against the wall.
Potter frowned, “Yes well, you were flagged as a risk. It is within the Ministries rights to make a full inspection when a wizarding property changes ownership, Section 5 Article 7 of the International Statute of Secrecy.”
“What are YOU doing here! Out in public with us decent folk!”
Draco stared motionless at Harry.
Cy took it and quickly pulled Draco down into his lap laughing.
“Deal.”
Draco tried to curl deeper into the cocoon of blankets and pillows he was swaddled in. They smelled like orange blossom and amber incense; it was comforting. Or it
Draco nodded and rolled onto his back, lifting his arms over his head, planting his feet on the bed and spreading his legs wide, offering himself in total submission.
Fuck no. He knew where he was and he didn’t want to see this. Draco was looking for a lighter and that arsehole showed up. This must be that day.  Harry could see it from the instant he walked outside. Draco took the light and smiled. He had to see how much this man wanted him, and he just stood there chatting away. Harry was fucking livid. He didn’t want to see the next part; he was about to pull out of the Pensieve, when Draco put out his cigarette and walked back inside.
Harry complied quickly. He sat on the edge of the bed and took in the sight before him. He remembered every curve, every line, the mole just above Draco’s left hip, the way the nest of curls at the base of his rosy pink cock was a more dirty blonde than the fine platinum hair that dusted the rest of his body, the scar he had just above his knee from a loose nail he’d snagged it on while exploring as a child. It was all just as he’d remembered it, and brand new at the same time.
“Fuck!” Draco gasped as a hand opened his flies, snaked its way into his trousers, and wrapped itself around his already hard cock.
Harry, completely at a loss for words, simply nodded.
So he had bought this house. It was nothing special, in fact, it had been a wreck. But with the help of Georgiou, a wizarding design and remodeling firm he hired, he had finally created a space of his own. He looked around, but his reverie was interrupted by a loud knock at the door.
Draco curled away and began to sob in earnest, pulling himself into a tighter ball. He needed to stay down. Just stay here till everything went away.
“Harry! What the…” Then Neville rounded the corner. He quickly assessed the situation, and his eyes hardened, his face turning red. Draco no longer saw the easygoing, huggable botanist. Neville transformed before his eyes into the general that stood up to Voldemort in the final battle.
Draco laughed and held out his hand. “Draco Abraxas Malfoy”
“No…” Harry looked a bit panicked and wouldn’t meet Draco’s eye. “I can’t because I won’t be here. I’m headed out for a bit.”
“No love, you look perfect just as you are.”
“I couldn’t get you out of my head.” He unzipped Harry’s flies and kissed his way back down his neck and up to the other ear.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco had to hand it to the muggles. There was something deeply satisfying at the end of the day to just turn your brain off and watch other peoples’ lives fly past. He especially liked that blond man who shouted at people and called them morons for not being able to accomplish the basic task of chopping, measuring and heating ingredients to the proper temperature.
There’s a whoosh and Draco steps through the Floo. “We caught him. Idiot got nabbed before he even made it down the street. I told you I could’ve-”
groceries. The least you could do is learn to do a decent fry-up”
The fire flared behind him and out bustled a flushed Molly Weasley.
It had been a bit awkward at first when Hermione and Ron had figured out exactly how Draco had met B.J., but as was her nature she swiftly put the issue to rest when she realised just what B.J. had done for Harry and Draco. Neville had been a bit harder to convince, particularly since the first time B.J. had shown up to meet them, Harry had neglected to prepare him as Draco had asked. Draco honestly couldn’t blame him after what he’d seen. But B.J. was B.J.; he was nearly impossible to hate and Neville eventually found himself rather fond of his no-nonsense charm. It didn’t hurt that B.J.’s sister Caroline had moved to the states to study Native American plant magic and that he put them in touch. From what Draco understood, they were slowly becoming rather smitten with each other, taking several international portkeys a month to visit one another.
“Hey...come on now…” He recognized B.J.’s voice and looked up.
“I’m not gonna eat that.”
“I’m sorry sir, I’m afraid I must have misheard you.” Draco said, staring aghast at Head Auror Robards.
“I want you, Harry Potter.” Draco reached down and swiftly yanked trousers and pants to Harry’s knees in one quick tug, settling himself between Harry’s legs. He looked down at his stiff, leaking cock and back up into Harry’s eyes. He kissed the insides of Harry’s thighs, and licked the sensitive junction between leg and groin. Placing his hands on Harry’s knees, he spread his legs wider, exposing and opening Harry as he slowly nosed up his cock.
“Why are you here?”
“I see how it is. How ‘bout, I  just enter your name in over here...” Cy switched to the second lanes console and typed in ‘Crap Bag’.
“Alright then, I expect you to
She looked up at him and smiled. “Good, now go back to your side of the bed, you’re a bloody furnace.” She laughed and pushed him away.
“Actually, I do.”  Draco grinned adding spinach, tomato and Swiss cheese to the pan and folding it in two. He grabbed a plate and deftly slid the omelette onto it, placing the cup of yogurt to the side. “Now take that to Hermione on your way over to your table.”
at ease in a world like this either, but she thrived here. She was still catty and domineering, but here she was more open. As he looked at his year, he thought that despite its shit start, 27 had turned out to be one of the best years of his life. He couldn’t imagine needing anything else.
Harry smiled back and took Draco’s hand. “Yeah, well, it’s just we never really do anything like this so I wanted it to be nice.”
“Draco baby, I’m sorry. Please, let me make it up to you.”
“Harry, you do realize you are an adult, and a wizard? You can literally go anywhere you want.” Draco quirked an eyebrow.
Harry took it, feeling awkward about the tentative formality. “Yeah, Of course.”
Draco chuckled, “Of course you are, Harry.”
Draco continued to watch as Harry was swarmed and welcomed by the entire assembly, and noticed, not for the first time, that he didn’t even seem to miss Draco’s absence when he was among these people. Bloody tosser could have anyone he wanted. What the fuck did he need Draco for? In the end, he’d go back to his life and pick someone new to watch telly and eat takeaway with and the only person who would have paid for it would be Draco. Because Harry had given him a taste of something he was never entitled to. If he’d never known what those sweet moments of being held and cared for felt like, he’d never feel the aching, shattering withdrawal that would come from them being ripped away.
He closed his eyes, he could see it like it was yesterday -- Draco in the early mornings, his wide, gorgeous grey eyes just rousing from sleep, his soft smile, his perfect pale skin slightly flushed pink. He remembered how the sheets would rustle against his tall, slim body, the feel of his legs tangled in Harry’s as he nuzzled gently into Harry’s neck. He wanted that man in his arms again. He could no longer push aside just how badly he wanted --
Well here we are! Hope it was worth the wait! We've reached end of the road! (except for the epilogue)  I hope you enjoyed this journey as much as I did! When I first found my self listening to Criminal by Fiona Apple, I had an idea for an interesting infidelity 5k one shot. I had no idea it would become this multi-chapter adventure to hell and back. It was meant to be 3 characters, Harry, Draco and the random faceless guy that fucked Draco and left, (B.J. wouldn't leave, and I'm glad he didn't!) I've been reading fanfic for 17 years but only wrote my first fic last September and this is my first multi-chapter. Thank you all for your love and support! So how'd you like the ending? Did it go how you'd hoped? Thoughts are always welcome, but not required. Your presence is enough. See you next week for a VERY short epilogue to catch up with our boys.
“NO!” Harry yelps, “This isn’t part of this...whatever right now. I
Harry altered course and headed for the bar. He ordered a scotch.
Draco’s mouth went dry. He stared at the man and exhaled. He was fit, tall, slender but well-muscled. He had a stubbled chin that gave the air of a man who was carefree and didn’t make plans. His eyes were bright and his mouth was curved in a mischievous smile. He looked at Draco and he didn’t see the liar, the arrogant racist child he had been, the attempted murderer, the prison sentence he had narrowly avoided. He saw a cute 20-something blond with a nice arse. Something he could never be to those people inside.
“Nothing, I said nothing
“Yes.” She released his arm. “Take care of yourself, Draco.”
Draco’s heart was pounding and he nodded, “You can go now. C’mon B.J.. Do it. Please. Give me right now. Fuck everything else. I want one good thing just for right now.”
“Yeah, I’m fine. I’m a big boy, Potter,” Draco smiled. “I just don’t like it when people try to get between me and the man I plan to marry.”
Harry looked up sharply. “What?”
It was yet another way he’d been blessed in such a short amount of time.
Without warning, Draco punched him square in the jaw, feeling the bones of his knuckles crunch against Goldstein’s smug face. Anthony hit the floor and Draco shook his hand out as he grinned at Harry. “I don’t need saving. I can take out my own trash.”
, I know you both have your eye on the position opening up as Head of Homicide, this assignment could have a big impact on my decision.”
“Hi,” Draco heard a familiar voice and stiffened.
Draco looked around surprised and then resigned when he caught sight of the witch.
“Look at that,” Goldstein said, “taking orders from Death Eater scum.”
Harry heard himself murmur something about breakfast.
Draco sank down and kissed the tip of Harry’s cock. “Apologize.”
“What is so awful about mushrooms!”
“No, love, don’t get up. I just wanted to let you know I’m heading to the restaurant.” He leaned over and kissed Harry softly. “I’ll see you and the guys a little later, okay?” he said, petting Harry’s hair lovingly. “I’m making a special just for you, ‘Gingerbread Waffles with Treacle Butter and a Pumpkin Latte’.”
“Excellent.” Draco said holding out his hand expectantly. Dennis just stared. “Well? Where are they?”
“I love you too you arrogant bastard.” Harry’s face lit up as he dove back in to claim Draco’s mouth.
That’s when he saw him, laughing with a man and two women at the other end of the bar, that impish grin and those puckish eyes were unmistakable.
“I know.”
“Don’t mind if I do!”
-----------
“Good. It was fine.” Draco wiggled away and brought them to a stop, facing Harry. “Look, are you sure this is a good idea? Did you tell them who you were bringing?”
“Because I don’t need you.”
“Draco, it’s not about that. Didn’t you have anything you wanted to do when you were a kid? Something fun?”
-----------
“No, I’m good,” Garrett said, leaning against the kitchen island. “I’ll let you know when I’m in the mood for sparkly pisswater though.”
------------
didn’t…” Harry shoved his hand into his hair, gripping the strands hard. He wanted so desperately to scream right now.
Potter stuffed his mouth and Draco rolled down a window.
“No.”
“What?”
Now to business. I have good news and I have bad news. And I suppose that all depends on what you interpret as good and bad. The bad news is that this story isn't complete this week. The good news is that there will be a bit more to love. I swear, I'm not one of those authors that plans on continuing to write and hold you hostage forever as I expand plot points for comments and attention. I just realized this wasn't at its natural end yet. There will be one more chapter and an epilogue.
“To punish you, and to remind you to never, ever, fuck with me.” Garret smirked.
“Yes, If he’ll have me.”
“I said, I love you. I should have said it a thousand times before but—”
Draco remembered the day he’d told the goblins where to stick their job, walked out the front doors of Gringotts, whipped around, and gave the building a proud two fingered salute. B.J. and Pansy had applauded and Draco gave them each a gracious bow in turn. He laughed, feeling lighter than he had in possibly his entire life. B.J. threw an arm around his shoulder and mussed his hair as Draco swatted at him and Pansy laughed.
Draco examined him, trying to understand what the other man was thinking. “That doesn’t really answer my question…What are you doing here?”
This is a song fic based on Criminal by Fiona Apple. I'd like to thank my brilliant Alpha/Beta/friend
It's Sunday again!  Hope you all enjoy this chapter!
“What are you doing here?”
“Harry…” Draco dropped the pan he was holding with a loud clatter, caramel sauce splattering onto his shoes. They stared at each other for what felt like ages, the tension vibrating between them, each caught in this interminable something.
“Thank you. You didn’t have to. But if you hadn’t… I don’t think I would have had this chance.” Draco bit his lip and looked into those deep, sincere eyes. “ I wouldn’t be here today. Not many people would have done that for me.”
“Yeah, good, okay. I’ll do that now. Can you do me a favour and fill a plate with bacon and send it out to them?”
Draco, looked away, biting his lip and willing his erection to go away. He needed to get himself back under control. “No, you shouldn’t have.”
. “I’m sorry,” he whispered as he leaned against the wall.
“I didn’t mean… and besides… Laurie…”
“I… Love you too. But Harry… Lets never get a dog.”
“No.” His voice cut with the sharp finality of a guillotine. “You lost the right to speak to me the moment I saw his hands on you. The
Harry relaxed.
“Certainly.”
“STRIKE! First fucking go! I’m so gonna kick your arse, Cy!”
FUCK.
There was another whoosh and Narcissa Malfoy stumbled out of the fireplace, wearing a muggle t-shirt and pajama bottoms of all things, her elegant blonde hair stuffed into a messy bun.
“Whatcha doin’?” she sighed contentedly as she rolled her head over to look at him.
“Right indeed,” Draco mumbled. He looked at the clock.10:30. Fuck Pansy’s gran’s rules; he went to the cupboard and poured himself a double scotch. He leaned against the counter and closed his eyes. He’d lost so much and he’d paid and paid and paid. When would this just be over?
“Fascinating…”
Draco couldn’t believe he had him. He was back. He wanted this. He wanted them. For the first time since that night a year ago, he had a warm, moaning, pliant Harry Potter pressed against him. His fingers were running through that gorgeous raven hair, his hand was gripping that firm arse, and his lips were pulling those sounds out of the man he’d thought he’d lost. He pulled back and Harry’s lips blindly moved to follow him. Draco put up a finger to stop him as he leaned in to whisper, “Would you like to come back to my place?”
“Besides, aren’t you supposed to meet Laurie soon? You’d better get cleaned up or she probably won’t let you take her to bed tonight.”
“You wouldn’t dare!”
, the best support system/Alpha/beta/friend ever. And as always to the best beta and punctuation wrangler I know, she makes my words shine
Draco led him into the drawing room.
He heard frantic steps. Then green eyes and a shock of raven hair rounded the corner and froze. Harry looked like he’d been physically struck. He looked down to where B.J.’s cock disappeared inside Draco, and then trailed up to meet Draco’s eyes. For just a moment, Draco could see disbelief, horror, anger, betrayal, and anguish all warring in those green depths. Then Harry suddenly disappeared back around the corner. Draco could hear retching and Neville shouting, “Harry! Harry! Are you okay, mate?”
“No, but I couldn’t let her wait around all morning for you layabouts to turn up. You know she gets hangry now that she’s pregnant. Tell her to eat up, there’s lots of protein and iron in that. It’ll do her good.”
Harry gasped as he crawled on top of Draco. He looked into those trusting, soft grey eyes and stroked his cheek with the back of his knuckles. “God, you are so beautiful Draco.’
“Hey! Stop gossiping  and get your arses over here!”
“Best two out of three!” Best two out of three!” he heard Garrett shout from the living room.
“What, rich people don’t bowl?”
He stripped off his shirt and ran a hand through his ruffled hair. As he stepped out of his pants and trousers, he noticed something fall from his back pocket. Bending over to retrieve the slip of paper. He saw it was the note Seema had handed him. He read it once, and then twice.
Draco paled as Potter walked out of the room and finished his forms.
“Blaise, what do you want your name to be?”
He walked to the door and Harry followed.
“No Draco, I don’t think I can fix you. I think Pansy and I would like to help you fix yourself. To redeem yourself in your own eyes,” B.J. said.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know if you disappeared tomorrow, I could stand on my own and be just fine. But I WANT you Harry. I have a flat, I want
“Yes.”
Cy returned with the white board and began setting it up. “Why do you always clean up
“If you’re satisfied, can you go now, please?” Draco asked quietly, never drawing his gaze away from the window.
They stared at each other, till finally Ron broke the silence. “Well then, kiss him and let’s be done with it, you idiots! I’m hungry!”
Draco looked up from his pan and over to the clock.
He turned to Harry feeling a bit puzzled. “We’ll go there later Draco, right now we’re going this way.” Harry turned them to the left through what looked like a tropical bazaar and straight through to a river with a large 18th-century sailing ship, Draco’s eyes grew wide as Harry steered them away and toward a walkway under a bridge with a sign above it that said ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’.
“Pretty sure,” Potter said as he pushed aside several crates of wine to reveal a hidden door. ”Ah!”
“Come inside me baby, make me yours.” Harry gave one final thrust as Draco bit his shoulder and clenched around his prick.
“Yeah. I uhh… Draco… I—”
“What?” Harry whipped around, “What the fuck did you just say to me?”
“Go to bed. I don’t want you to use being tired as an excuse for why I trounce you tomorrow in hand to hand combat.”
“Potter! Table for two! Right this way please.” They were led to an intimate little table and handed their menus and a wine list.
Harry was beginning to find himself drawn to the man, particularly when they were leaning close together examining documents, or laughing over lunch. Sometimes he thought he could feel Draco watching him out of the corner of his eye and he definitely felt it when occasionally their fingers lingered over each other when they passed a file or quill back and forth.
Merlin, he thought as he tuned her out. He peered into the bottom of a plain white mug. It only had a little brown tint from the dregs of this mornings (maybe yesterday’s?) tea. He blew in it to make sure there wasn’t any dust just in case and squinted. It looked okay so he put his teabag in the cup and waited for the water to boil.
Harry breathed in, and put his hand on the back of Draco’s neck.
It wasn’t his fault that Harry had walked into his restaurant. Sure, he knew he shouldn’t have pursued him, but in that moment he hardly knew what he was doing. He was so overwhelmed by emotion that his body had seemed to move on its own. Despite his desperate attempts to purge himself of all his feelings of want for the man, there still remained a single thread, a vine rooted in his heart constantly reaching and searching for the nourishment Draco denied it. But when he saw Harry, that vine latched onto him as if he were the sun, blossoming and growing, sending pulses of emotion directly to Draco’s very core. When Harry walked away, he took with him the light and that neglected bit of Draco’s soul pulled him as surely and swiftly as a fish on a line.
Draco’s heart stopped. He hadn’t seen Harry in over a year. He was suddenly flooded with all the emotion he’d worked so hard to lock away: tenderness, yearning, passion, shame, grief, pain.
Okay. This is starting to get weird. He’s beginning to become aroused by staring - for all intents and purposes - at himself. He looks down hoping it isn’t too obvious, but fuck. He’s almost a little tempted to reach between his legs and…
We've finally made it friends! The end of the road! I hope you enjoy the epilogue!
Harry burst into laughter as he leaned in to kiss Draco. “Whatever you say, dear.”
Anthony turned, having obviously not noticed or cared who Harry’s companion was and his expression soured. “Malfoy.” He nodded curtly.
Draco was being a perfectly miserable arsehole.
Harry was across the room in seconds pulling Draco to him in a deep, hungry kiss.
“Don’t fucking lie to me! He’s all over your flat!” Harry gestured to B.J.’s discarded pyjama bottoms and at the photos on the wall. “You were both sitting around half-naked on a Thursday morning. I’m not fucking stupid! Look, Hermione told me you were different and that I should come over and get to know you again.Turns out you're still the same lying piece of shit. You cheated on me, now you’re just as happy to cheat on him. Have a nice life, arsehole.”
. ” B.J. crosses his arms against his chest, fixing Harry with a cold stare. “What I find most troublesome though Harry, is that you thought it appropriate to ask him to show you his most painful memories, even after he admitted to you just how hurt he had been.”
“Oh, don’t be like that you fucking arsehole. You’ve barely looked or spoken to me in weeks, and then I woke up this morning and you were fucking gone.” Harry began to pace as he launched into a rapid tirade. “Your books, your clothes, everything! Did you not consider what that would do to me? I thought something had happened! I thought you’d had an emergency, or that you’d been taken! Because surely you wouldn’t just sneak out and leave in the middle of the night. I stormed into Gregson’s office and demanded to know where you were and what was wrong because I was fucking
“There are so many things I didn’t know as a child.”
“I’m here from the Ministry to inspect your new home.” Potter held up a badge.
Hope you all enjoyed this weeks chapter! Chapter four will be up March 17th! Comments and Kudos welcome and adored! Thanks for reading!  Also bonus points to people who
“Fuck it, I’m not having a conversation standing in my flat in my pants. Have a seat and shut the door behind you.”
“I asked him Harry, I needed to know.”
“Pansy, that’s cute, but we both know you think every hour is a perfectly respectable hour for champagne.”
“What, for extra spell practice? I told you if you were going to set up that group that I would join you—”
“Your obsession with making me eat them is insane, Harry. I am not a picky person, but I hate mushrooms. You can’t trick me into liking them.”
“Blaise!” Draco shouted, all thoughts of his chopping forgotten and leaping on him.
Harry caught him by the wrist. “You misunderstand me.”
“I wouldn’t put it past them. What do you think the brown stuff was?”
“It’s part of my charm. Now OUT!” Draco said as he whipped him on the arse with a kitchen towel and turned to peel and press some garlic, smiling to himself.
? Nothing interesting happened here.
Potter began sniggering to himself.
Draco raised a cool eyebrow, even though inside his stomach was in knots. “Yes, that’s what I said, Potter. Did I stutter, or did something happen to your hearing during today's obstacle course? Did you not protect yourself when you saw the mandrakes?”
“What I don’t understand,”Draco continued, “is
Draco could hardly believe this was his life. He thought back to the man he was a year ago and he hardly recognised him; that man never would have imagined any of this was possible.
“Now I am here as a private citizen.”
Neville took three swift steps toward him and decked him.
“How do you know Portuguese?”
Luckily, even after almost 8 months nobody had yet caught wind that Draco was in a relationship of sorts with Harry Potter. They weren’t exactly hiding it per se, just being highly discreet. After 5 years, most of the Pottermania had died down,partly due to the fact that Harry rarely did anything interesting these days. But if they caught wind that Harry Potter was seeing Draco Malfoy, he wondered if the world would ever get over it. He suspected there’d be lynch mobs forming in the street. Imagine, their precious Chosen One degrading himself by choosing to be with the likes of him.
“I got a couple mates in from out of town for the next couple weeks. Should be here next week if you change your mind.” B.J. winked, took another drag and leaned back.
“...AND you certainly haven’t been tidying! Merlin Harry! It looks like a bomb went off in there! Look, I’m not trying to nag you, it’s just...”
Focus, Harry.
“Why? Jealous, B.J.?”
him, had the life Harry wanted with him, lazy mornings at home and playful breakfasts at Hudson’s, and now this man was rubbing it all in his face! How dare he barge into his home and challenge him! Why in the hell was he even here?! Then it dawned on him.
“CAN I HELP YOU?” Harry shouted, hair a mess, evidently having been aggressively abused in some sort of fit. “CAN I FUCKING HELP YOU!?”
“What?”
“What?” Draco pulled his blanket up above his head and tried to disappear into a fortress of bedding.
Draco and Harry meet again.
winking at Draco. He felt the despair. Merlin, this was too much. His head was pounding, but he followed as Draco walked outside.
“You wish.”
Draco re-entered the club, rolling down his sleeves as he walked back towards the rest of the group. Harry was now occupied holding up what seemed to be a heavily intoxicated, rambling Parvati Patil and looking rather amused and sheepish. Great. Draco sank back down and stared at his drink. He tossed it back and wished just for a moment that he could belong here. Greg never went anywhere anymore, not since...he shook his head. Blaise was always flitting in and out of the country, not a care in the world. He still saw Pans regularly but two people in a club does not a party make.
Draco looked quickly back to his book, feigning disinterest while something hot and snarling took up residence in his chest.
That night, as he crawled into bed next to Pansy, he reached out and pulled her close. He kissed her forehead and rested his chin on top of her head. “I’m sorry I’ve been such a shitty friend, and I’m sorry I scared you. What would I do without you, Pans?”
“Well, if you want a hand, I’m actually quite good at cooking. My aunt taught me.”
“Ah... delighted my princess,” Draco gave a lordly nod and held out his hand. “I’ll do my best to bring you a victory.”
Draco batted it out of the air with his spoon before it made contact. “Keep it up and you won’t get to see what I made you for dessert,” he said, tossing a grape at Cy, who deftly leaned to his left and caught it with his mouth.
Draco leaned over to sign and Potter tore off the top sheet.
“Okay Okay, mate, that’s enough.” B.J. had stepped in and was trying to pull Neville off of Draco, but Neville held onto his throat like a terrier with a bone screaming, “We trusted him with you. He fucking
“Sorry, it’s funny. Muggle thing...nevermind…” He said attempting to compose himself.
“Nope, haven’t had the pleasure. Well, I hope your date with Laurie from the administration office goes well.”
“How could you not know?”
This is a song fic based on Criminal by Fiona Apple. I'd like to thank my brilliant Alpha/Beta/friend
“It’s not that hard!” he’d shout at the bloody thing, and Potter would smirk and dig into his curry.
B.J. smirked. “Cy and Patrick took forever coming up with that while hammered at our last pub night. It made them far too happy. That’s how our crowd is-- goofy, a little wild, and a whole lot odd. If it isn’t your scene, don’t bother coming. I haven’t told him I’m inviting you so it’s fine if you decide not to show. He won’t be disappointed. You can think about it if you want.”
“Yeah, yeah ‘Mi. Got it. I’ll try and be around soon. I just haven’t really been in the mood, okay?”
and to one of the best beta's I know
Harry’s up and in Draco’s bedroom downing the polyjuice antidote in a flash as he Finite’s the charms on his clothes.
“Thought you and I needed to have a bit of a chat, actually.” He looked about at the mess, but spotted the mug, already prepared on the counter, and poured in some water. He began searching through the cupboards till he found the sugar bowl and prepared the tea to his liking.
------------
Draco’s heart broke a little. God, how he wanted to keep this. He wanted to reach out and grab Potter and shout, “I’m keeping you! This is mine! This is the one thing I can have! I want it and I’m not letting go no matter what anyone says!” But he’d never do that. He’d never saddle Harry permanently to him and drag him down for the rest of his life. So he just smiled and said, “I love italian. Thank you.”
“Besides, I’m not complaining. The food’s surprisingly good here and I never say no to an extra hour and a half at the bar.” He took a sip of his drink and winked. “It always makes the game more fun.”
“I hate you”
Draco looked around. He was content. He had everything he needed.
“Time,” Blaise said cooly, looking up from the clock.
------------
“Yep. Okay, let’s get the rest of these people fed.” With that, Draco got back to work. He could feel his friends’ eyes on him. He looked up and saw that they obviously didn’t know if they should disturb him or not. He shook his head and gave a small smile. Cy arrived with their giant pile of bacon and Draco gave them a little salute and a wink before grabbing a new pan and beginning a fresh batch of bananas.
“Good,” Cy said. “Come over here, you can be my ‘Prince Charming’. “Okay, ‘I Can’t Believe It’s Not Gutter' your turn to pick someone.”
Draco nodded, taking a moment to look Harry over. Gone were the days of ratty, oversized hand-me-downs and general unkemptness. This Harry looked stunning in denims that fit like they were made for him and an emerald green button-down that made his eyes practically glow. It was unbuttoned a bit at the top, the sleeves rolled up, showing off his tanned muscular forearms. His hair was still a bit wild, but with a windswept roguish charm that practically begged Draco to pin him up against the nearest surface and run his fingers through it.
Merlin, he’d always thought he’d tried to do more? Hadn’t he?
Harry kissed him, cutting off his sentence. “Don’t overthink it, just say it quick!”
Harry froze. Without turning he said, “Take your hands off me Malfoy or I’ll call the aurors.”
“Interesting,” said Potter as he inspected the room and cast his charms. “Well, everything seems to be in order here.”
“Thank you, Tilly,” Narcissa said warmly as the empty shell of Draco’s father stared at them blankly from across the table.
Draco tapped it with his own, “To me.”
He’d only done this maybe twice before. How was that possible? How had he not been compelled to wake up every morning and put his mouth on this cock He hummed as he wrung moans and desperate cries from Draco. He felt fingers firmly gripping his head and he shuddered.
“Yes well, thank you for stopping by. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to use the men’s room and then Draco and I have plans.”
Cy walked up with a round of mimosas on a tray. “I thought punching was against restaurant policy?”
“You’re telling me.” Draco smiled. “Now bowl, and don’t fuck it up or I’ll have you beheaded.”
“How? I’m alone in the world, Pans. You’re all I have. I used to have him. Even his friends were forced to tolerate me, but now it’s all gone. It’s just you and me. Muggles are the only people that don’t despise me and I can’t even fit in with them! I mean, can you imagine?! I would be so lost in their world. So now I’m stuck here in the middle. And as much as I love you, that’s just not enough.”
“But how can I ever be good enough for him? I mean look at me. Look at my life. What do I even have to offer?”
Without her encouragement and ear to bounce my thoughts off of none of this would be here. :)
Draco wakes up to a Pansy determined to help Draco get his life in order and she's enlisted help...
The doorbell rang. “Can you get that please? I'm fucking exhausted.”
He swung the door open to reveal a plush silk four poster bed with restraints built into every post, a wall of neatly hung whips, dildos, ball gags, butt plugs, vibrators, cockrings, nipple clamps, and various other toys.  Beside the bed there was a nightstand with a jar of lube and a bowl of condoms, and suspended from the ceiling in the corner was a multiposition sex swing with a spreader bar.
in my mouth anymore.”
“Harry, is that you? Last time I saw you was what...March? We have to stop running into each other like this.”
“Muggles don’t have brooms, Draco. Planes are a Muggle invention, they’re big metal vehicles that can fly in the air and carry people and cargo and stuff. You’ve never heard of planes?”
“I made an exception.”
Harry hated it when Draco smoked. Not only was it bad for him, but afterwards he tasted like an ashtray and his hair lost that soft citrusy scent he loved. He especially loved it when he was on top of the other man, his nose buried in Draco’s neck as he—Harry stopped that train of thought. He mustn't get ahead of himself. Draco still wasn’t his yet. For all he knew this was as far as he was going to get, and he needed to be okay with that.
“Be ready in 15 minutes or there’ll be no mimosas for you.”
Harry began to buck up into his mouth, his eyes focusing on Draco as he watched in awe as he fingered himself open.
He worked his way up through the ranks and was now the sous chef at Hudson’s. He loved every minute of it. Not to mention once his talent had been recognised, he was put in charge of brunch. Every Saturday and Sunday morning, the kitchen was his. He ran a clean, organised, efficient service, and every week people flocked to Hudson’s for its tantalising, creative and exquisitely prepared specials. B.J. used to joke that he should go on one of those competitive cooking shows he was so obsessed with. It was funny at first, but now he was actually considering it. It could be fun, not to mention it played to Draco’s highly competitive nature.
He pushed Harry against a shop window and kissed him. He wasn’t timid or submissive like he usually was with Harry. He didn’t follow Harry’s lead. He simply took. He could feel Harry begin to melt beneath him, his knees growing weak, so he wrapped an arm around his waist, pulling their hips together and holding him up at the same time. He remembered earlier how badly he had wanted to run his fingers through that wild mop of luxurious hair, so he did, tousling the raven locks with his long pale fingers till they finally came to rest on the back of Harry’s neck. Draco’s thumb caressed Harry’s cheek and he could feel Harry fall apart beneath him, gasping and moaning into the kiss as his prick frantically rubbed against Draco’s thigh.
Draco stared, a little uncomfortable seeing B.J. in broad daylight at his favourite restaurant with his best friend the morning after they’d...well after he’d seen...It didn’t matter: there was no way this could work. “Well, that’s very nice of you,” he said, not quite able to meet B.J’s eyes. “But my life is really complicated and…”
, she is the encouragement and focus my brain needs when I get stuck and frustrated. Another thanks this week to
Draco pressed a gentle kiss to the tip, looking up through his lashes as Harry stared down at him, mouth open and eyes wide.
“Why didn’t the papers know, Harry? I always wondered. Everyday... Why weren’t there howlers and curses everywhere I went? Why didn’t the press hound my mother? You filed paperwork with the Ministry, how did that never get out? Why doesn’t even Hermione know?”
The wine came and Harry began to relax as they discussed the upcoming match between the Harpies and the Tornadoes and bickered amiably about the new recruits. When their appetiser arrived, a pan seared scallop with crispy pancetta and a green pea purée, Harry looked down and smiled, “Hey, these are those things your favorite chef guy is always yelling about cooking properly!”
“Exactly.” Harry put his hands on either side of Draco’s waist. “When you were a kid, what did you think would be fun?”
This time Harry knew where he was. He was in his flat. It was morning; he looked around and saw them asleep in bed. Draco was half-asleep, reaching a hand into Harry’s hair. Harry stirred, and he could see Draco wake with a start. He looked around, seemingly afraid for a moment, then looking over to Harry and relaxing. He ran a finger over Harry’s temple and down the side of his cheek, studying him. Harry realised this must have been the first night he’d brought Draco home.
“You have got to be fucking kidding me,” Neville said. His usually genial voice pitched low and deadly. “I told him. We all fucking told him to cut you loose. But he refused. Do you have any idea how worried he’s been looking for you? Practically tore the fucking place apart! He swore he needed to keep you safe. He was about to call the fucking Aurors, swore there was no way you’d leave without him voluntarily and that there were people out there that wanted to hurt you. Well I don’t know about then, but there are fucking now!”
He walked to the bar, ordered a double scotch, and threw it back in one gulp. Then he ordered another and leaned back against the bar. Hell if he was going to go over there and feel like an outcast. He’d rather stay right here and just be an anonymous bloke at the bar.
Draco went down without a fight shaking quietly.
“Oh please, Draco,” Pansy rolled her eyes “When are you going to learn? I think of everything.”
“Draco’s a big boy.” There weren’t enough blankets in the world to block out the sounds Draco was hearing. “Forget about him, he’ll be fine.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Okay guys! Come and get it! Dave, do you mind taking that to the table while I grab some plates?” The room scrambled to gather round the table and fill their plates as Draco set the cooking dishes in the sink.
“But they taste so good!”
“What?! An hour’s not up! I can’t walk outside looking like this!”
------------
“Hmm?” He looked up, then over to the entrance and back.
He leaned down and kissed Draco gently, pressing soft warm kisses to his lips and gently licking into his mouth. Draco wrapped his arms and legs around Harry’s body and keened as their erections pressed together. They kissed lovingly as Draco began to rut up against Harry’s leaking prick with increasing speed and pressure. He squeezed him tight and whined, “Please Harry, I need you inside me. I need this. I want you. Make me yours again. Please.”
“Fine! Then I’ll be the other one.” Patrick said as he got up and switched consoles with Cy. “I’ll show you who’s the crap bag,
“You’re keeping me awake for this?” Draco flipped his head out of the covers. “Go to bed Potter,” he said as he resettled himself amongst his blankets.
It will probably be a couple of months because I want to get the bulk of it done so I can release on a timely schedule :) Plus I am going to be writing a collab Drarry based on Indiana Jones. If any of that appeals to you subscribe and check it out :) Comments and Kudos are cherished and appreciated, but just your presence reading this is an honor in and of itself.
Draco squawked as he nearly tumbled to the ground. “Some Prince Charming you turned out to be!” Draco laughed as he took the seat Cy had just vacated.
“Giving up that easily? What are you, scared Potter?””
“So the kids want to go round to the club again on Saturday. Guess Lee’s finally landed himself that WWN Quidditch-casting gig and they all want to celebrate.” Draco cringed internally. “And I was thinking it might be nice for us to go out and grab a bite together before we meet up with them. I thought I could take you someplace nice.”
“Not, like this,” he said. “I want to look at you when I take you.”
“Fine, just take the Floo and stay hidden ‘til you’re back to normal.”
“It’s nothing—it’s silly—it’s too early—just a thought I had, you know, a bit of fun.” Draco blushed and tried to pull away.
************
Harry burst out laughing as he looked back to the arrest records for erisedicine addicts. Slowly, he began to cross-reference the locations of arrests and something clicked! There was a pattern here. It could possibly lead to the locations Oz used as points for exchanging the potions. Brilliant! If he could get enough surveillance in those areas maybe he could identify the suspect and lead him into a trap.
that is?”
This was all too much. He paced back and forth before finally deciding to sit on the couch. Draco had looked happy and content both times Harry had walked back into his life recently, and as soon as he had seen Harry, that happiness had been replaced with sadness, regret, and pain. It didn’t matter what Harry wanted anymore.
He glared at her. Truth be told, he didn’t remember much of last night after B.J. scooped him up off the alley floor. He remembered a very embarrassing cab ride where he leaned against him and cried alot. He remembered a tired, confused Pansy opening the door, alarmed to find her best friend being delivered to her looking like he’d just gone ten rounds with a hippogriff. He remembered B.J. and Pans bundling him up into her bed; he remembered falling asleep to the sounds of their low murmuring outside the door. He had no idea what they had talked about or what Pansy knew. He only knew he didn’t want to talk about it now, and he certainly didn’t feel like volunteering information she didn’t already have.
“Goodbye, Malfoy.” With that, he turned down the alley.
He gasped as he began to push slowly in. Draco’s mouth was open and he was staring down at the place where Harry disappeared inside of him, looking awed. “Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, fuck Harry, yes, god, you’re inside me, fuck.”
“Harry! Wait!” He broke into a jog. He caught up and grabbed Harry’s arm to stop him. “Harry! I—“
Draco sat in the car watching their subject, who seemed to be doing nothing more nefarious that buying a sweater for his stupid dog. He was starving and Potter had left 40 minutes ago to grab them a “quick bite.”
They were back in Harry’s flat again. He looked over and saw the wreckage of tikki masala, butter chicken, samosas, and garlic naan on the coffee table. Draco snuggled against his chest as they watched Gordon Ramsay’s Hell’s Kitchen.
“Ow! Stop it! It won’t fit! It’s too many letters! Besides I was there the night we went skinny dipping, Princess,” Patrick began typing ‘Princess Puny’ into the console, “and a banana, it is not my friend. OW!
“YES Dennis, I got that part!” Draco snapped at the clumsy junior auror. Dennis Creevey meant well, but honestly Draco had no idea how he had made it through auror training. Clearly, nobody else did either, hence his current position as Robards’ assistant. An assignment that irritated Robards and amused Draco endlessly.
Still...
He’d loved Draco, and it made him sick to his stomach to finally realise just how hurt Draco had been back then.
“We call it
he said, so when he kept bringing you along we tried to be nice to you. But you just sat there. Stiff and cold as ice. Immovable, staring off into the distance.
See you next Sunday friends.
“Great. Well, let’s get you a seat and get you introduced,” B.J. said, and the rest of the group took their lead from B.J., greeting him warmly and introducing themselves one by one.
“I was making breakfast anyway arsehole, you can’t cook.” Draco said, running his fingers through his hair as he stood to fish through the fridge.
Well that's all folks! I hope you enjoyed this fic and much as I do. It's been a wild ride and I created something here I never thought I'd be able to. Thanks for coming on this journey with me. For my next long fic I'll be writing Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert's
“Yeah, see you another time hopefully.”
“ARSE O’CLOCK!” Draco heard shouts from the living room.
Harry’s eyes hardened and he stood. “I think you’d best be on your way, Anthony.”
“And this is my copy,” he said as he shrunk his clipboard and put it in his robe pocket. “So that completes my work here.”
“Apparently he used his house elf to transcribe a letter.”
Harry began to look a bit flushed and overwhelmed, “Draco, I thought you left because you didn’t want me around anymore. I came here because I couldn’t bear the idea that you were leaving and even if I could have you I wanted you back in any capacity. But then… I find out that all this time… all this time you… and with Laurie… I was hurting you… and I didn’t know. I didn’t know and… I’m sorry… and now… I’m such an idiot. If you don’t want this anymore, I understand. I should just go.”
“Hey!” Cy shouted from his seat at the dining room table, “How come B.J. gets to be in the kitchen!”
“No excuses. It’s been far too long. I always wanted to get to know you better back in school but the timing wasn’t right, what with the war and having to train
“Why are you still here?” Draco said as B.J. slowly pulled him up into a sitting position.
for people to judge. Was Potter mad? Why couldn’t he leave well enough alone. The more they went out, the sooner Potter would realise he couldn’t possibly keep Draco, and that would be the end of it. Draco sighed; there was no use fighting it.
A few hours and several drinks later Draco, Blaise, Pansy and B.J. were the only ones left. Pansy put on
After Harry's sudden appearance at Hudson's Draco can't help but try to speak to him.
“Oh yes,” said Draco, “Last time, Patrick was losing and Cy started paying him in Monopoly money to do real-life tasks, and when that didn’t help enough, Patrick petitioned that he and Amani should be allowed to get married and thus combine their marital assets.” Draco chuckled. “You never know with this bunch.”
“I’m not the chivalrous type.” He winked and grabbed his bowling ball. “What can I say, us heroes are nothing but trouble.”
Harry began to back up slowly into his room. For a second it seemed like Michael might turn and leave without noticing him, but a floorboard creaked and Michael’s gaze swung from Harry to Malfoy and back again. He looked confused, then a little disappointed.
“That’s good then. I’ll stay over! And I get to see Potter,” Pansy smiled sweetly. “Draco said you’ve been getting on so well recently! I think it’s nice that you came for a visit.”
“Alright, Luna?” he asked, taking a seat next to her and stretching his legs.
When Jason, the Muggle barista, had asked Harry out, Ginny had just shrugged and told him to go for it, she’d been spending more time with Dean anyway. Clearly though, knowing Harry wanted to date nice coffee shop employees named Jason was one thing, knowing he had spent the last few days desperately rubbing up against Draco Malfoy was another entirely.
“The big part of you is alone and it’s a wolf. Voldemort, your father, the Death Eaters, they were a trap for you. They caught you and you couldn’t get away.” Harry had a kind of manic look in his eye. He reached across the table and grabbed Draco’s hand, sweaty and too tight. “So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.” He dropped Draco’s hand. “You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I’m right.”
“Shouldn’t you just be glad I’m not trying to win back your girlfriend?” Harry said, only half joking, backing out of the room.
“In the kitchen!” Harry called back, “We’re eating, if you’d like some.”
“Do we just go in then?” Harry nodded towards the massive estate. Hermione approached the gate, and he held his breath, waiting for some terrible repelling jinx or curse. Instead, it just swung open, creaking loudly, startling the peacocks on the great sloping lawn. They crunched up the pea gravel drive and met with Dedalus at the entrance to the house.
Malfoy drew a sharp breath and tilted his head. “Charming.”
Cato was an ancient house elf who wore an impeccable tuxedo. Somehow the weirdness of this combination did not rate in Harry’s mind when compared to Malfoy’s shoulders and thighs, as he followed behind to the drawing room. The breeches were practically indecent, and yet no one else in their party seemed disturbed by them.
, Harry jolted a little, remembering what a snob Malfoy was. The whole outfit was ridiculous, as was the horse for that matter.
Harry lay alone in a massive guest suite and tried not to think about whether Malfoy and Ernie had gone together down the hall. When that didn’t work, he tried picturing each of them alone in their own beds, which would have helped, only he got stuck imagining Malfoy’s pajamas. Harry slept in boxers, and while he supposed Malfoy might do the same, it occurred to him that there really wasn’t room for boxers under those breeches. So then he was just laying in bed picturing Malfoy sleeping in the nude. It wasn’t conducive to rest.
“Dedalus, I’m sorry if this is rude to ask, but er, wasn’t your home destroyed?”
“Not since we started? Even back in the beginning of July?” Harry hooked his ankle over Draco’s and nudged him to lay back down as well.
“I’ve been helping him finance some joke shop expansion business on the continent,” Ernie said, as though that explained why they would have been discussing Harry’s love life. Harry glanced over to Malfoy who was clearly listening in. This was not a conversation he wanted to have with Ernie MacMillan and Draco Malfoy of all people.
“He’s mine,” Greyback rasped from the ground. He jerked his head towards Draco, leering. “They both are. The Dark Lord intended them for me. Different purposes though.”
It was a clear night when they finally made their move. Hermione stayed back at Grimmauld Place, monitoring Harry’s movements through surveillance spells.
