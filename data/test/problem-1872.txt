Harry felt his stomach flip and a goofy grin spread across his face. He sent a short reply letting Draco know he would be more than greatful for any help he could get, and sent it off.
"What's that?" Draco asked, pointing to the television in the corner.
"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have laughed before explaining, love. Theo and Blaise would sleep with me and Theo did sleep with me last night but that's all we did all we have ever done. Sleep. I would have a hard time being alone after a nightmare and they would lay with me until I fell back asleep. Which is what Theo did last night. Theo and Blaise are probably the two most straight people I have ever met. Blaise has been with a Ravenclaw girl in our year since sixth year and Theo has been with Daphne since third year. There has been nothing but brotherly love between us ever, and definitely nothing romantic. That's why I laughed, I understand how it looked and sounded with my previous explanation. I would never intentionally hurt you. I love you Harry and I only want you, I'm yours."
Harry stared at the letter for a full five minutes and had to read it three times before the words made sense. He was gobsmacked, whatever he may have expected, an apology and a thank you, was not it. A few minutes later he walked over to the desk and took out a quill, ink, and parchment. His quill hovered over the page, his heart hammering before he finally started writing.
"Harry. Harry look at me please" Draco said gently as he put a finger under Harry's chin and guided it up.
"Do you mean been with a man or sex?" Draco asked.
Harry ladled two bowls with stew, grabbed a fresh loaf of bread, and butter then placed it all on the open end of the table. He grabbed a bottle of wine that Ron and Hermione had gotten him as a house warming gift, and two glasses.
"See you soon." Harry said, and his smile was only slightly forced.
"Harry!"
Harry laughed out loud at the post script. He could imagine the smirk the blonde wore as he wrote that, and for the first time that image didn't bring him anger. It was nice to have Draco teasing him, it was familiar and comforting. He was surprised by the request to get to know each other, though he had to agree that no matter how much time he has spent watching Draco over the years he really didn't know him. His reply was short saying that his favorite color was green and of course Draco's was something as posh as
Draco let out a loud bark-like laugh when he stepped in to look in the room.
"Draco, I love you too," Harry said around the lump in his throat, brushing a strand of hair behind Draco's ear.
Harry could feel something changing between them, with each passing day they were becoming more comfortable living together the last of their guards tumbling down. By the morning of the fourth day Harry knew that Draco was not a morning person, he took cream and sugar in his tea, and he wouldn't speak until his first cup was finished.
In the days following the trial Harry couldn't get the image of shock and raw emotion that flitted across Draco's face when he was freed, out of his head. The owl squaked and brought him back to the present with a jump. He reached forward with a trembling hand and took the letter. He opened the envelope and started reading:
"I know, I trust you," Harry said just as seriously.
"Happy Birthday Harry." Draco whispered in his ear and he tried not to shiver.
"Hey Harry, alright if I come through?" Draco asked.
Harry invited Draco to stay for dinner and they moved their things to the kitchen so Draco could continue planning while Harry made stew. Draco chatted continuously as Harry worked and he couldn't help the smile that played on his lips as he listened to him babble.
Draco stepped gracefully out of the fireplace. He was holding a quill and parchment in one hand and some magazines in the other.
After sending the letter, he trudged upstairs and fell into bed. For the first time in a long time he fell asleep with a smile on his face.
"Who have you seen there?" He asked just as quietly as Harry.
Harry reached down and gave a few experimental strokes to Draco's cock, which was a little longer than his but not as thick, making Draco moan and close his eyes. When he opened them they had that hungry look in them again, and Harry reveled in the fact that he made Draco look like that. Draco picked up his wand and muttered a lubrication charm on his hand, then he leaned forward and kissed Harry again while his hand moved down and began messaging his entrance with a finger. He pushed the first finger passed the ring of muscle. Harry had never felt anything like it, before he knew it he was thrusting down to meet Draco's finger, "More, Draco, more."
The End.
Before he could start panicking, Draco pulled him to his feet and kissed him again. It was just a chaste press of lips, then he pulled away smiling and went back to painting. Harry couldn't help the goofy grin that spread across his face as they finished up.
There were a couple new things like how their feet would bump into each other every couple minutes, how their hands were linked through the whole meal, and a couple stolen kisses in between bites.
Draco muttered the lubrication charm again slicking up his cock, he leaned over Harry and lined himself up. He pressed the head past the ring of muscle and Harry gasped at the stretch, Draco kissed him and began stroking Harry's cock as he inched forward. Once he was fully seated Harry was panting, "I'm fine, you can move."
For the next three days the house elves cleaned, Harry and Draco worked their way through each room of the house painting and arranging furniture (some of which had been owl ordered from one of the magazines Draco brought), they ate every meal together and watched television every night before going to bed.
"Gods yes please anything," Harry breathed before bringing Draco's lips back to his.
Two hours later Harry got Draco's response. He was nervous to read it, he didn't want pity or for it to become weird between them, not now that they had come so far. He took a deep breath and opened the letter.
"I've wanted to do that for a long time." Draco breathed.
Harry smiled and squeezed Draco just a little tighter.
"I'm sorry Draco, I shouldn't have asked." Harry mumbled.
"Just relax, I won't hurt you and if you ever need to stop just tell me and I will," Draco looked down at him with a serious expression.
"I'm sorry I jumped to conclusions, I love you too." He reached out and pulled Draco into a crushing hug.
Draco groaned and pulled out slowly,"Fuck Harry you're so tight, so perfect."
"Are you okay?" Draco asked his hand stilling.
Then they were gone, he said his goodbyes to everyone else, and apparated home.
Harry hesitantly reached over and pulled Draco's shirt off too. He took a moment to place soft kisses down Draco's chest where a very faint silver scar ran, "I'm sorry," Harry whispered against his skin. Draco pulled him up by the chin, kissing him, letting him know he was forgiven, before letting Harry continue his exploration.
On the third floor Harry opened the door to the room in question and stepped back.
A week into their correspondence found Harry in Diagonal Alley (under heavy glamours) to purchase an owl of his own. He knew Zeus (Draco's eagle owl) was exhausting himself and decided it was time. He chose a male barn owl that reminded him nothing of Hedwig, and only felt a little guilty when he placed him in her cage that night.
Once they left Draco looked over at Harry with a smile, "Ready?"
That's brilliant." He exclaimed.
Harry bolted behind the side of the bed. Draco sent the brush at him again, Harry rolled towards his brush that was still in the bucket of paint. By now Harry was laughing so hard he couldn't breathe. He could hear Draco laughing too but couldn't turn around and see because he was picking up his brush and flinging paint in the direction he thought Draco was in. Then he suddenly found himself tackled to the floor. Draco flipped him over, holding his wrist with the brush above his head. Draco was smiling then he put his hand in the bucket next to them and held it above Harry's face.
"Why are you laughing, nothing about this is funny!" Harry shouted.
It was getting to be too much for Harry to keep his feelings bottled up, he would stare at Draco when he thought the blonde wasn't looking, scared of getting caught but unable to help himself. Draco's hair was like spun gold, he loved what it looked like when the sun would hit it turning it almost white. It was shorter than it had been in school, shorter on the sides than on top with a fringe that swept to the right side of his face framing his silver-grey eyes with perfectly sculpted eyebrows. His eyelashes were long and a few shades darker than his hair. He had high cheek bones, but they weren't as sharp as they used to be, and he had a perfectly straight nose. Then there were those full luscious lips, the bottom a little fuller than the top, so he had a natural pout that made Harry want to push him against the nearest wall and snog him senseless.
As they were about to say goodbye and go their separate ways, Harry blurted out before he could stop himself, "Wanna come have a drink at my place?"
"Why didn't you say anything, Harry? I've wanted you since Fourth year." Draco said indignantly.
Harry heard a quiet knock at the door and his heart took off again. 'Get it together' he told himself. He heard a muttered conversation out by the door, then Narcissa and Draco walked into the room.
"I love you, Harry," Draco whispered.
"Merlin, Draco, I'm ready please fuck me, please!" Harry plead practically screaming.
"Is everything alright?" Draco asked as he set down his empty cup.
"Why aren't you with Hermione?"
Draco pressed in a second finger, slowly scissoring and stretching Harry, then he curled his fingers up and made Harry's back arch and feel like his entire body was on fire, "What. Was. That?" Harry panted.
"I will," he promised.
"Of course, powders on the mantle." Harry said, a little disappointed the evening was over, but in a contented calm sort of way.
Harry heard Teddy crying in the other room and lept at the excuse to leave Narcissa in the entryway. He walked into the living room, gave Andromeda a quick hug, then took Teddy so she could go finish up dinner. Harry walked a fussy Teddy around the living room a couple times before he fell asleep with his face buried in Harry's neck, his hair rotating in a rainbow of colors as he dreamed.
He was startled from his thoughts by a tapping on the window. He got up and pulled back the curtain, blinded momentarily by the bright afternoon sunlight, and opened the window to let in the handsome eagle owl that was perched on the window sill. He would recognize the bird anywhere, as he had seen it countless times from across the Great Hall, and was immediately wary of the letter held in its beak.
Draco was beaming, "Really you wouldn't mind?"
"Harry, look at me." Draco breathed.
Draco fucked him with his fingers for a couple more minutes. When he hit Harry's prostate again Harry couldn't take any more.
"Football," Harry said simply.
"Sure that would be great." Draco said with a smile, surprising Harry.
he then asked what Draco's favorite dessert was and adding that his was treacle tart.
"Draco, please, I want to feel you inside of me." Harry blushed at his bold statement.
'Sorry, but you were wearing too many clothes,' the voice was a mix of amusement and awe. To hide his embarrassment Draco asked. 'What happened to that patience you talked about so much?'
The needles in his head where replaced by a fuzzy feeling.
Draco slipped one hand into the soft hair of the boy as the other started exploring his body, with his tongue. When he felt the boy slither down his body, Draco dropped his hand. His bellybutton was being tongue and there seemed to be a direct connection to his cock, which twitched in anticipation.
That was something Harry could understand. He remained silent as Malfoy collected his thoughts.
Harry cursed softly. Damn George and his blasted candy!
Once again Draco was left standing in the sudden light when the darkness was lifted. This time however he felt a spark of hope that the other would find him again. Leaning back against the books, he gently touched his throat and smiled.
'Do you take one a day, or more?'
He tried to back away only to find a desk blocking his way. Of course that was the perfect opportunity for Malfoy to step up and inquire: 'So maybe you enjoyed the distraction last night?'
There were two more doors, one on his left side, suggesting another room, and one right in front of him, which stood open and gave him a glimpse of the outdoors.
The idea made his skin crawl. The thought of losing those wonderful moments he'd replayed over and over in his head. The moments in which he had felt cherished, loved, even worshipped. From the very start he'd instinctively trusted the boy. Even when the potential candidates had been brought down to only Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors, he hadn't backed out.
Harry tightened his jaw but ignored the comment. It wasn’t the first time his friend had brought up the issue of Malfoy’s wand. Of course deep down Harry knew he should have given Malfoy his wand back a long time ago, but …

'Soon, love, soon,' the boy gently told him, 'if you'll have me.'
'Do you know what each of them does?'
He frowned. No Slytherin and no Ravenclaw either? Dear Morgana!
He pushed Harry onto one of the leather covered cushions the device seemed to be made of and pressed gently between Harry’s shoulder blades, until Harry was half laying with his face downwards, staring at the floor through a cushioned ring. He didn’t know what was more disturbing; the way Malfoy talked or his hands touching Harry’s naked skin.
Draco wandered down the empty corridors. He'd been avoiding the common room, afraid Pansy might drag him with her to the Great Hall. Draco knew she'd only stayed at Hogwarts for his sake, though neither of them would acknowledge that.
Now, almost a week later, he was still looking – staring actually – at Malfoy's chin. In every class they now shared as eighth years and during meals when it was impossible to see something all the way across the Great Hall.
The boy chuckled softly and told him: 'It's a five-petaled rose!'
In this part I'd used Jae's Monthly Drabble Challenge #54 - "I'm not moving".
Even though he'd considered him as an option, he hadn't really believed it could be a possibility. The discovery was overwhelming. He had so many thoughts, so many questions, but instead of expressing them, he did just what he was told and let go.
'Oh gods, I missed you so much!'

Instead he asked lazily: ‘Why don’t you want your wand back?’
Draco moaned and apparently that was all Potter needed to hear. The Gryffindor ran his hands down his back and Draco shivered in anticipation, when he reached the waistband of his trousers. Instead of dipping below or touching his ass, Potter grabbed him by the waist and manoeuvred him in one quick fluid motion on his back.
'Warming up yet?' he asked as he handed over the glass of red wine. Potter only shook his head and took it with shaky hands. Of course, half the wine spilled over and Draco cursed inside. He joined the Gryffindor on the sofa and covered the tanned hand with his own. Potter looked at him with those damned eyes – impossibly green at such close quarters – but Draco only lifted the glass to Potter's lips and made him drink.
Draco couldn't have anticipated what the twelve days of Christmas would bring him.
The end
I hope you've enjoyed it :)
He supposed he should start calling him 'Harry'. At least in his head. Unless … he bit the inside of his lip … unless he decided to stop this madness, this thing with Po – Harry right now. That was what most of his friends would say. His parents … well, no use in thinking what his father would advise.
Startled, Harry jumped up again. Green eyes shot wildly through the room. ‘What?’
Looking at the big mansion in front of him, Harry wondered what the hell he was doing here. Apparently somewhere between breakfast and just before he’d Apparated he’d decided to go visit Draco Malfoy, of all people. When he really should avoid him like the dragon pox, at least until every last drop of liquor was out of his system.
‘Did you bump your head?’ Malfoy asked.
He decided to wait and see what would happen. He was certain the boy wouldn't force him to do something he didn't like, and to be honest he enjoyed their encounters immensely and was already looking forwards to the next day.
Thanks for reading, and especially for leaving kudos and comments! <3
'Fuck, Potter!' Draco breathed. He pulled the glass from Potter's fingers, gulped it down and tossed it behind him. The glass hadn't even hit the floor yet, before Draco was already straddling Potter's lap and burying his hands in the dark hair to keep his head still. Potter's lips parted, probably to stutter some more but the motion only seemed to deepen Draco's desire. Teeth grazed his lower lip – maybe due to the tremors but who cared – and then their tongues met. Potter whimpered and the sound sent shivers over Draco's skin. He wondered absently if that candy was contagious. He wanted to explore Potter's mouth, wanted to discover every sensitive place, but he was a little afraid that he might be bitten by Potter's shattering teeth. So he let the Gryffindor do the exploring and found out he was well-equipped for the job.
"The Twelve Days of Christmas" is an English Christmas carol. The song, published in England in 1780 without music as a chant or rhyme, is thought to be French in origin.
'Weird? Me? There's nothing weird!' Harry said defensively. 'What do you want from me, Malfoy?'
When he opened his eyes, Malfoy was staring at him, searchingly. Harry had no idea what he was looking for, so he just returned the look.
He swallowed with difficulty while he ordered his arms to push the wizard away, but they remained limply at his sides while his face was being cradled. Dry lips brushed his as light and sweet as a Sugar Quill. Careful as if the other was expecting Draco to jerk away or hex him. As he should.
Potter blanched and he shook his head in panic.
Draco wants answers. Harry could lie but will he?
'There's only one,' he said apologetically and just to be safe, he put the wing in his mouth only to realise that he had no idea what the effect would be this time.

He was met with silence. Anxiously he wondered if he'd just ruined his chance with this boy.
And yet, old mechanisms screamed not to trust the Gryffindor. Told him it shouldn't be happening, that it could never work. The Golden Boy & the Death Eater? The Daily Prophet would have a field day as soon as they found out.
'Please,' he said softly. Apparently his mother had been right; it really was the magic word. The boy kissed him, not franticly, but sweet and tenderly. It felt wonderful. Draco parted his lips and touched the other's tongue with his own. The boy whimpered. He wrapped his arms around Draco's waist to lift him up and carry him to the bed, probably. Absent-mindedly Draco realized he must have used that spell again, instead of the powder.

Dean told everyone that he’d seen Malfoy leave in the lavender uniform the masseurs of the salon wore when he had been waiting to pick up his cousin.
'Draco! Wait!' Pansy's high-pitched voice cried after him. 'Were are you going?'
When he eventually fell asleep, the monster in his chest purred softly.
'That's four questions. Want me to answer them all?' the boy teased.
'Patience has left the building,' the boy murmured against his throat. His hands began to roam and explore his chest.
She rolled her eyes. 'Of course not! Go somewhere and read it. We have a free period after the first class, right? We'll talk about it in the common room then.'
Draco couldn't have anticipated what the twelve days of Christmas would bring him.
'Oh – gods!' The heat of his breath through the damp fabric was driving him crazy. 'Please, oh please,' he hardly knew what he was begging for until he got it.

Harry’s hands trembled as he tried to part Malfoy from his clothing. It wasn’t an easy task in his half laying position. He proceeded to unbutton Malfoy's shirt while Malfoy kissed his way down Harry’s chest.
– light brown candles, surrounding the sofa. At least, that explained the smell of cinnamon.
'Hey, careful with the Walnut roots!' Malfoy's voice sounded warningly. 'We want to keep her from escaping, not changing the way she views the world.'
'Oh no, you're not leaving me behind again, all hot and bothered!'
'Weasley sends one each day?' Nod.
'Who?' she insisted to know.
‘Seems I was right, wasn’t I?’ Malfoy sounded smug, but, to his surprise, Harry detected a little insecurity underneath it.
'Just as soft as I imagined,' Harry said and he gave a little smile.
Draco swallowed; he didn't know what to say. The boy was quiet, obviously waiting for a reaction. Draco made a decision. He turned slightly towards the other and said, 'I believe I have one more question left.'
It has undergone some modification (not the plot, just editing).
‘Draco bloody Malfoy?’
The boy paused and urged him on. 'Let go, Draco. I'll catch you!'
The Slytherin's eyes widened noticeably. He stepped forward and a wicked smile appeared around his lips. 'You want a distraction?'
Draco nearly panicked until the boy leaned in and whispered against the curve of his throat, 'Trust me.'
This version of it is mine!
Originally beta'd by the lovely spicykittins and Myriam. Any remaining mistakes - from the post-beta fiddling – are mine :)
Finally the boy was coming to rest between his legs. And then he kissed Draco's inner thigh. Licked along his hipbone. Trailed his tongue along the waistband of his pants, until at last, he pressed his mouth to the bulge straining against the thin, black fabric.
He was contemplating telling her the truth. Despite what anyone might think, she would never betray such a secret about him, although she might nag him persistently.
was his moody thought. Well, however it would turn out to be, it had at least started wonderful, if only somewhat frustrating. He hadn't wanked as much in the entire last year as he had the last week.
Suddenly he was startled by a tapping noise at the window. Recognizing the Weasley's Wizard Wheezes' owl, he hurried out of bed before the other boys would wake up. After all, it was a Saturday.
Surprisingly enough, the Golden Trio hadn't said anything to humiliate him.
The voices surrounding him vanished as though they were a great distance away. Ron’s freckles faded, and the faces of Neville and Seamus blurred together with other ones until his friends where nothing more than a group of faceless people.

'The only thing I'll tell you for free, is that I'm a boy and not a Slytherin, but you knew that already, didn't you?'
Although the voice sounded soft and gentle, Draco scowled for terrorizing him like this. He startled when cool fingers carefully touched his cheek. The stranger waited a moment. Draco however was far too surprised to move and for some reason his voice refused to make a sound. The other started moving their thumb softly over his cheekbone and made a soft noise that sounded like content humming. Based on the feeling of the calloused fingers against his skin, he guessed it wasn't a girl.
And why was Harry playing along? As Ron would say: ‘Well, you did your best, mate. You offered him his wand and he refused. Nothing more to it, right?’ And even Hermione wouldn’t understand why he hadn’t left already. But they didn’t have that bloody chest monster, did they? There was also that embarrassing event last night, and even though he totally blamed the Firewhiskey, he doubted that Ron had done the same thing. Or Hermione. He shuddered and felt something claw on the inside. It was clearly a mistake to have headed down that train of thought.
Dean tried to silence Ginny, so they could take a guess, but his girlfriend blurted the answer anyway.
'You're acting weird again, Potter.' Malfoy didn't move, though, and Harry didn't seem to be able to take his eyes off the fine, blond hairs he saw up close. Just in time he managed to keep his hand from reaching out and touching.
'How can you say that? You don't even know who he is!'
‘Oh, yes,’ Harry moaned. ‘Fuck, Draco!’
Draco was draped across a dark green sofa in the common room. Vincent and Blaise were playing Exploding Snap across the room and Patty and Daphne were doing some incomprehensible girlish stuff in their dormitory.
"Sorry", he said tearfully, "but have you seen a toad?" Both Harry and Ron shook their heads and then the boy wailed.
"She followed me, Malfoy. I don't need help with hexes for you.", growled Ron.
Draco looked at Harry, “We haven’t spoken practically all week, Harry”.
"What is it?", Draco asked.
Harry shrugged, "I know. Still had to help. She wouldn't be in that situation if we didn't make fun of her."
Harry just rolled his eyes and ate. He then asked, "What do we have next?"
"Starving."
"Has anyone seen a toad? Neville's lost him", she said, with a bossy sort of voice.
First meetings
"Welcome to Hogwarts," Began McGonagall. "The start-of-term banquet, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin".
Ron sighed and said, "Oh alright. But we better not be caught."
"Ah music! A magic beyond all we do here! Now off to bed!"
Harry was confused, as the Slytherin common room was in the dungeon, but he thought maybe there was a secret passage way for the students to use. Harry then suddenly remembered, and grabbed Draco and Ron and snuck away from the groups.
"But I don't feel like I belong-"
He bent down to pull his wand out of the troll's nose.
"Yes", said Harry with a bit more nervousness than he wanted.
Harry really didn't have any counter argument. The silence is what he needed. So far Slytherin DID seem like the worst house and the other houses seem better, but what if it wasn't? What if he gets into Slytherin? He did say to Draco that no matter what house he's in, he would try to fit in no matter what. Harry looked out the window, wondering where his place is in this world.
Draco sighed, "Harry, what's wrong?"
Harry couldn't be more grateful to Ron if he had tried. As he told Ron how lost he was trying to find his next class which was Transfiguation, Ron told Harry that was his next class as well and he was lost as well. They spent a rather long time tying to find this bloody class before they ended up finding the right direction, however they were very late. They ran to Transfiguation class, hoping that McGonagall wasn't there. When they entered the class, the rest of the class was already hard at work writing down whatever the assignment is. Harry and Ron hurriedly walked in, relived that the professor wasn't there, but some cat on her desk.
This was a big mistake.
"You wanna put that to the test?", said Ron coldy. "wizard's duel."
"So..." He began, "it's nice you got into Gryffindor.. With your brothers.."
Hermione replied with a bossy edge, “It WAS locked.”
"Malfoy's got my Remembrall, professor."
The hat seemed to chuckle, "ahh, it does not matter to you, does it? But which house to put you in... You seem to have traits of two rival houses..."
"Hmmm, difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent... Oh my. And a nice thirst to prove yourself. Now.. Where to put you...", The hat spoke to him, each word making Harry's heart go by faster.
"Think my name is funny, do you? Potter doesn't need to tell me your name. Red hair, and hand-me-down clothes? You must be a Weasley. More children than they can afford."
Harry looked out the windows and watched as the houses flash by, excitement rising in him, as he wondered what he would do, but it would be better than what he had. It was then his compartment door slid open that pulled him from his thoughts. Harry turned to see the youngest red haired boy from the family peak his head in.
"She doesn't know about the troll."
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco looked at Hermione as if she was mad, “We weren’t looking at its feet! It’s heads took up more of our attention, or maybe you didn’t notice THREE of it?”
A pink faced girl with blonde put on the hat and after a moments pause, she was sorted into Hufflepuff. As each student was sorted into their respected houses, earning cheers from the houses they were placed in, McGonagall then reached Hermione who was placed in Gryffindor, to which Ron groaned. After more sorts, Draco was called and the hat barley touched his head before it called, "SLYTHERIN!" Draco joined his friends at the table, but not before smirking at Harry, who for all intents and purposes, was happy than Draco did get his wish. When Ron got called, he was also sorted in Gryffindor and joined his brothers.
Harry said, "To Hagrid's. Wanna come?"
Like, comment, and subscribe... You filthly little mudbloods! Also, I'm sorry Disney. Please don't take away my Disney+. Also someone made a good point to me about Harry acting more shy and introverted due to the abuse he suffered so now I’m thinking should I incorporate that more as well? Let me know what you guys think
Harry's mouth fell open, the dishes in front of the students with many food that Harry would like to eat on one table. Harry got a bit of everything and began eating. As they were eating, ghost appeared and introduced themselves to their houses. The Slytherin got The Bloody Baron. As the feast went on, the students began to talk about their families and Harry heard about how their families are "All pureblood".
Harry led them down a deserted corridor and hurried off toward the girls' bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps.
Snape continued, "Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to NOT PAY ATTENTION."
To say Harry was stunned by what Draco said would be an understatement.
Draco dropped the ball back on the Gryffindor table and said while scowling, "Just looking, professor." He then joined the rest of the Slytherin table. Harry pinched the bridge of his nose and quietly said sorry to both Ron and Neville. As he joined the Slytherins, he started to grow concern about the fact that Ron ans Draco might push each other to the point and get into an actual physical fight and they might force him to choose who to side with. He made a mental note to talk to Draco and try to have him easy up on him picking on other people.
Harry tried to call the boy down, "He'll turn up. Things have a way to come back to us at random times".
Harry smiled as well, "I'm Harry-"
Snape lips curled into a sneer, "Pity. Clearly.. Fame isn't everything.. Is it, Mr Potter?"
With a slight sneer, the boy responded, "Do you now? How come he's with you? Where's your parents?
No sooner than Hooch left, Draco then laughed, "Did you see his face? Maybe if the fat lard given this a squeeze" Draco had Neville's Remembrall in his hand as he continued, "He would remembered to land on his fat ass."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Draco, why are we doing this duel and what's a 'second'?", Harry said.
"Welcome to your first flying lesson. Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick."
The boy nodded, "Yeah, but I still can't believe why first years can't have their own. Perhaps I'll bully father into getting me one and smuggle it in somehow".
"What...", said Harry still half asleep.
The pain had come and gone quickly, but the feeling that look he gotten from the teacher didn't shake off. He gotten the impression that the teacher didn't like him, for some odd reason.
Hermione glared at Ron and simply rolled up her sleeves and spoke the incantation. She made her feather float every easily. Ron was in a very fowl mood after the class was over.
Harry would've assumed this was because the fact that he was head of Slytherin, but McGonagall was the head of griffindors and she didn't do any favors. Mail was then dropped off. To Harry's surprise, Hedwig dropped off a note in front of Harry. He opened the letter and saw it was Hagrid, who invited him to tea at 3. Harry wrote a response and sent Hedwig off. With a promised class that should be easy and a afternoon to see Hagrid, Friday should be a nice and simple day.
He finally slowed so Harry could keep up, “Why would I be? You seem to enjoy to be talking to your Griffindor friend, so why should I be”?
What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?" said Ron finally.
"Guys wait, just calm dow-"
He then sank to the floor in a dead faint. No sooner than he did, thunder and lightning erupted and the students screamed.
"He won't get up! He's sleeping like he's dead."

After charms, defense against the dark Arts came, and at first everyone was looking forward to this class, however it turned out to be a bit of a joke. For one, the class smelled like garlic and when asked how he got rid of a zombie, all Quirrell did was go pink and talk about the weather.
Dumbledore, however, just simply bellowed, "SILENCE"! The students went silent and looked at Dumbledore. He then said, "Prefects, lead your houses back to the dormitories immediately."
While a little annoyed at this, Harry just shrugged, "Oh.. Yeah, I am."
While the Slytherins ((besides Harry)) laughed, the Gryffindors definitely weren't happy.
He spoke, "Welcome! To a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! Thank you"!
"I've lost him! He keeps getting away from me!"
"Unless you leave right now, you prick"
Harry panicked, "DO SOMETHING!" The troll then swung its club at Harry, who dodged it.
Harry finally found his voice, "I don't know sir.."
Ron just looked at Harry with look of "get a load of her" to which Harry had to choke back a laugh.
Harry quickly looked again to see McGonagall placing a four legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool, was a pointed wizard's hat that was very frayed, patched, and dirty. Harry thought they would have to try and pull a rabbit out of it. Then a rip near the brim opened while like a mouth and began to sing:
Draco then spoke, "it's true then? Harry Potter in this compartment?
Draco shrugged, "Maybe. Never really cared in the first place. Potatoes, Potter?"
"Hey, what was that?", said one of the twins, who was looking at Harry's exposed scar.
The Slytherin first years followed their Prefect through the crowd and out of the great hall and down a flight of stairs. The Slytherins were led down to what looked like a dark dungeon.
"Becuse I said it first." Ron looked smug as he said this.
A cat from a fourth year's  boy was playing with some tinsel. Silver and green Christmas decorations still adorned the room. It reminded Draco of the beautiful antique ornaments his mother used to decorate the living room of the Manor. He tried to swallow the lump in his throat. The Manor,
The other boy stiffened immediately and nearly choked as Draco's body shuddered through his climax.
Green eyes, filled with defeat, looked up. 'It was supposed to make me feel honourable.' The only part still shaking were his hands that lay on the jeans covered knees.
His heart was drumming so loud he wouldn't be surprised if Potter casted a
(See the end of the chapter for
Hands pulled the black fabric away and his cock sprang free. Fingers gripped it lightly and it felt so amazing to have someone else touch him there.
'You're so beautiful,' he heard whisper. The boy leaned in and kissed him passionately.
Draco considered the eight year boys from Ravenclaw. Michael Corner: had taken up with the Weasley girl again, after she and Potter apparently had broken up. Terry Boot: too skinny to fit the description. Anthony Goldstein: was muscular enough, but his hair was too short. Stephen Cornfoot: he could fit, Draco guessed, but they've always gotten along well, and this boy thought Draco would hexed him if he knew who he was.
Silence fell over the room and stretched for what seemed like minutes until the other boys started laughing.
Draco inhaled sharply, caught by surprise. He wanted to ask a thousand questions. And how could he trust the boy, especially given the identities he'd considered for the other? But the fact was, he did trust him. Which was a strange thing, if you'd thought about it. With him being a Slytherin and an ex-Death Eater.
Author's Notes: Transferring another FF story. This one was written in 2010, and it broke all my personal records at that time; longest, fastest written and smuttiest. It had the most chapters, most reviews and alerts and it's still my favourite story. Never anticipated that I'd be able to write more than a drabble in English.
'I – yeah,' Harry breathed.
The words kept echoing through Draco's head all morning. After lunch he escaped his fellow Slytherins and went to same class room as yesterday, expecting to be alone for a few hours. To his surprise his vision disappeared the moment he entered. He staggered but was caught by two strong arms.
‘What’s wrong, Potter?’
It has undergone some modification (not the plot, just editing).
By the time he reached their room he desperately hoped that he wouldn't be the first. When he opened the door however, his eyes fell on the bed; the sheets were still rumpled from last night. Disappointment coursed through him. He stepped inside and then darkness hit him again. An sob escaped him, but it was drowned by the words of the boy behind him.
The gentle massaging of his scalp reminded him of Malfoy’s work and his eyes strayed over to the area that was hidden behind the curtain.
‘Don’t be daft, Malfoy!’ Harry second-guessed his decision to come here for the umpteenth time in as many minutes. ‘It’s your wand! You shouldn’t have to live without one, just because Ollivander won’t sell to you.’ He hesitated a moment. ‘Although, can you really blame him?’
When the boy offered him the seventh cherry, Draco groaned. He raised his hands to hold the solid shoulders and kissed him desperately. The boy groaned, meeting Draco's eagerness with his own.
‘I presume you don’t want to explain why you’d found yourself to be in that predicament?’ Malfoy smirked before he got serious.
'Till tomorrow!' he laughed softly.
'I knew you'd figure it out soon,' the boy said. 'Alright, six questions on the sixth day. But I'll reserve the right to decline an answer when it gives too much away about who I am.'
'Potter!' he prompted. 'Tell me what's wrong?' For a brief moment Draco worried that Potter hadn't been a willing participant until he recalled Potter kissing him and moaning and trusting against him. 'Tell me! I'm not moving. Not until you explain.'
Shocked, Harry's head snapped up and startled green eyes met grey ones.
While white stars still burst behind his eyes, the boy fled. A 'Finite' echoed through the room, the scent of sex heavy in the air.
He wanted to ask what the hell was happening and who the fuck this person thought he was, thinking they could touch Draco like that. Because, even though it wasn't the attack he'd been expecting ever since he came back to Hogwarts as an eight year student, it was still very unsettling. He hadn't experienced a lot of gentle touches over the last few years. He shuddered unintentionally when he remembered the times he almost hadn't been able to escape the greedy claws of Greyback.
His expression immediately became indignant. However, before he could tell her that Malfoy's did not snicker,
'My intentions aren't to hurt you, Draco,' he'd said. But what were they? He remembered the whispered words: 'Missed you.'
Not in the least because that sight had made him wonder if those patches of hair would be as soft as they looked. The thought had been like a Bludger to the head. Literally!
'Potter,' a familiar voice drawled. Malfoy had stepped out of the shadows and stood right before him. Harry tried not to look at the Slytherin's chin or mouth, but the alternative were those silver-grey eyes that watched him intensely. But Harry noticed there was a lack of the usual malice.
For a moment Draco wished he could do the same; call out the other's name. But then he pushed that thought to the back of his mind. The fact that the boy gave him a soft kiss made that quite easy.
'You seem to trust him, which is rare, so it can't be a Slytherin. He blinded you before kissing you, and left you in the dark about his identity for more than a week, so he is obviously afraid you might not like him, or would even hex him,' she pondered out loud. 'Seeing as you keep it a secret from me, it must be either something embarrassing like a Hufflepuff or something revolutionary like a …' Before she finished her sentence his eyes betrayed him as they glanced over to the Gryffindor table. Potter wasn't seated at his usual spot between Granger and Weasel.
'What?' Draco exclaimed, 'Everyone? In all of Hogwarts? Where did you get it? Did you have it all these years while you went to school?' He didn't know if he felt jealous or a little nervous at the thought of being … well, stalked was the right word, wasn't it?
No new prompts or other Wings form George. Just more warming up in this last part of the story :)
A tongue swiped roughly over his nipple and a wave of energy surged through him, prickling his skin until it felt like he was on fire. After he had treated the other nipple the same way, the other leaned back, clearly searching for something behind him in the dark. The smell of the roses became stronger and Draco was startled when something velvety touched the skin near his bellybutton. A rose! The boy was caressing him with rose petals. It was weird and erotic and yet sweet all at the same time. He was glad that the darkness hid his flushed face, although he wished he could see the boy who was caressing him like this.
Just when her stomach rumbled, the other eight year Gryffindors entered the common room. She rose up from the couch and joined the others for Sunday's breakfast. Just like last night Harry made sure he was surrounded by his fellow roommates. The fact that he was still avoiding her, told her more than anything that she was right; there was definitely something strange going on!
He was an eight year, but not a Slytherin. He was bold, yet gentle and romantic. He was honourable, he hadn't taken advantage of him or the situations, and he laughed easily. He ignored the fact that those traits sounded suspiciously Gryffindorish.
At the end of a long corridor Malfoy opened a door and gestured for Harry to enter. Since he was already in the proverbial snake pit Harry thought ‘why not?’ and stepped inside. Whatever he’d been expecting, this wasn’t it. The room was divided by a wall to wall curtain, which hid the right side of the room. On the left side was a nice sitting area with a fireplace. Instead of lavender, the room was decorated in different shades of creams and ivory. It looked elegant, yet cosy.
If he'd thought Potter, being a virgin, would be hesitant, he'd thought wrong. Well, the man
Draco couldn't have anticipated what the twelve days of Christmas would bring him.
"The Twelve Days of Christmas" is an English Christmas carol. The song, published in England in 1780 without music as a chant or rhyme, is thought to be French in origin.
'He nibbled on my ears,' he repeated with a low voice.
The Slytherin smirked before he leaned in and whispered seductively in Harry's ear: 'Imagine how it must feel on the rest of your body.'
When he kissed him again he felt moisture on his cheek. It seemed that the uncertainty about how Draco would react, was getting to the boy after all those days.
His tone of voice was slightly inquiring as if he wasn't sure about Draco's reaction. Nonetheless his hands started roaming.
Wayne Hopkins dated one of the Patil twins. He didn't know about Justin Finch-Fletchley, but Ernie Macmillan could fit the bill. And Draco had often wanted to hex him. He groaned; Potter, Macmillan, or Finch-Fletchley? He'd rather throw himself off of the Astronomy Tower!
Surrounded by all kinds of exotic plants, in the middle of a small wood-panelled terrace, was a hot tub. Made from cedar, it surely was a thing of beauty. The rich colours and grains in the wood were simply stunning.
"Just one during the summer before our Sixth year. He was a muggle boy from the village near the Manor and it was right before I got the Mark and I just wanted to forget. He ended up being killed shortly after when the Death Eaters raided the village." Draco said with a haunted expression.
Much to Harry's disappointment Draco was always dressed when he came down for breakfast so he never got to see him in pajamas. He couldn't complain too much however because Draco always had on a pair of muggle jeans that fit him like a second skin with a Polo t-shirt, the sleeves snug on his arms so Harry could admire his toned biceps. Yes all of it was driving Harry mad, and he didn't know what to do. Draco hadn't hinted at or said anything to make Harry think he felt anything more than friendship towards him.
The wedding went off without a hitch Hermione was beautiful, and Ron was beaming. Harry saw Ron quickly rub his eyes a couple of times and he couldn't help the joy that bubbled up in him at his best friend's happiness. The food was delicious, of course, and the music played in the background while a few people danced. All too quickly it was time for Ron and Hermione to take their portkey to the first stop on their trip Athens, Greece.
"Sure," Harry said as he walked over, turned on the TV, and waited to see Draco's reaction. There was a football game on and as the picture appeared Draco gasped.
Lots of fluff and finally smut alert you've been warned.
He spent the whole afternoon in his garden, he'd found that it was one of the only things that could distract him from everything else. He supposed it was one good thing he had learned from his time at the Dursley's. At half four he went down, took a quick shower, got dressed in his best jeans and a dark green jumper, then tried to tame his hair (not that it really helped).
"I'm yours too." He whispered in Draco's ear.
"Okay so it's not completely livable yet it's only been me and my one very old, house elf fixing it up and as I don't really enjoy remodeling it's taking longer than I hoped." Harry said defensively.
A couple hours later and they were almost finished. Harry miscalculated the speed his brush was hurtling back towards the bucket of paint, which was coincidentally right next to Draco. By the time he realized what was about to happen there was nothing he could say or do to stop it. The brush flew into the bucket which splattered all over the floor and of course Draco. Slowly Draco turned around and had paint from his bare feet to his hair.
"Really?" Draco asked frowning in confusion.
"What are they playing?" He asked, as he walked over to one of the armchairs and took the glass Harry held out to him.
Harry didn't have time to move before a brush full of paint was flying towards his face, he turned just in time for it to skim his ear and little bit of hair.
"I needed a break, Mum and Mrs. Granger are trying to tame her hair, and it got kind of tense."
Just as Teddy was waking up from his nap Andromeda called them into the dining room for dinner. Harry put a sleepy Teddy in his highchair. Harry had to laugh a little as the high chair was placed at the head of the table (which must go against at least one pureblood rule) with Harry and Andromeda on one side and Draco and Narcissa on the other.
They talked and laughed through dinner. Harry and Draco recounted some memories from school and it was funny to hear their different perspectives on each situation. By the end of the meal the four adults had tears rolling down their cheeks.
"As long as you don't mind Regalus' old room it is the only other one Kreature kept up. I'm sure you'll appreciate the decor." Harry chuckled.
Everything was green, from the thick carpet to the silk duvet and hangings around the dark mahogany four-poster in the middle of the room. There were a few posters of wizard bands and a canvas with the crest of Slytherin painted on it. There was a desk a wardrobe and nightstand all in the same dark mahogany as the bed.
Harry had never seen Draco so open and unguarded. His smile transformed his face, with no trace of a sneer or smirk he could only be described as beautiful. Harry didn't think about what it meant to think of another man as beautiful. At the moment he really didn't care, it was true.
It only took them an hour to finish up the library, Harry couldn't help but wish he knew about magic growing up, everything was so much easier and faster, his chores would have taken him no time at all.
"Absolutely," Draco said, pulling Harry into another kiss.
Harry woke up on the day of the wedding with a mixture of trepidation and relief. He really didn't want to be around all those people with his fake smile and forced small talk, when all he really wanted was to be at home in his garden. This was it though after tonight he could hole himself up in his house until September 1st. He could work on his house and in his garden as much as he wanted and he could close out the rest of the world.
Draco stepped away and into the flames before Harry could take a breath. But not before he saw Draco smile at him as he swirled away.
"It's a television, a muggle device to watch programs on, like a wireless, but with a picture to go along with the voices.
Draco sat back a look of shock on his face. "What are you talking about?" Then his face cleared and he let out a huff of laughter before doubling over as he shook with mirth.
"I should get going, can I use your floo, I think I've drank too much to apparate." Draco asked.
"Merlin Harry, you're perfect." Draco whispered in awe.
Draco walked over to the coffee table and started setting out the magazines and notes from the day before.
Draco pulled almost all the way out before moving back in with a third finger, Harry hissed and arched his back again. The fullness was incredible and he never wanted this to end.
"Me too." Harry whispered back.
"I have it under the Fidelius charm so no one can bother me." Harry explained.
"So you slept together?" He asked brokenly.
This weekend was bitter sweet, on top of everything else it was Ron and Hermione's wedding. They had gotten engaged a month after the Battle and decided they wanted to be married before they all went back for their final year at Hogwarts. They were leaving from the wedding to go on a two month honeymoon that their parents insisted they take just for themselves now that the war was over and they could enjoy some peace and relaxation. They were hesitant, both worried about leaving Harry, but he waived off their concern and even gave them a small fortune as a wedding gift to spend on their trip.
Harry was restless all day, like there was an itch under his skin he couldn't scratch. He wanted to see Draco again, but he didn't want to seem desperate, hell he didn't even know if Draco was gay. He just figured out he was so how was he supposed to know if someone else was, let alone if they liked him like that.
"How many have you been with?" Harry asked quietly, afraid of the answer.
"I mean, I not only find out today that you return my feelings, you also have a body like
He hadn't heard from Malfoy since he sent his response and he couldn't help but feel a little disappointed. He wondered again if he had said too much but just shook his head, there was no taking it back now. Besides if Malfoy didn't return to Hogwarts he wouldn't have to see him again anyway. That last thought bothered him, Hogwarts without Malfoy seemed wrong, though he didn't examine the feeling too closely.
"Hmm?" Harry was distracted by the sounds Draco was making and the way his Adam's apple bobbed when he swallowed. It took a second for Draco's words to sink in. "Oh, thank you. I cooked a lot growing up."
Two days before his birthday Andromeda wrote inviting him to dinner at her house, she also said that she had invited Draco and she hoped he didn't mind as Narcissa had told her about their new friendship. As he would be having brunch at the Burrow and be free that night he wrote back thanking her and letting her know he would be there. He felt a bit guilty for how long it had been since he had gone over to see Teddy and was looking forward to seeing his godson. He couldn't help the nerves that came when he thought about seeing Draco after all this time, so much had changed and he hoped talking to him in person would be as easy as it was to write to him. He also received a letter from Ron and Hermione that morning with pictures of them at the summit of Mt. Everest, wind chapped but smiling, and for the first time he read the letter without a hint of resentment.
Harry smiled and walked down to the kitchen to grab two glasses and a bottle of firewhiskey, then walked back up to the drawing room. Harry let out a laugh when he saw Draco about an inch away from the screen trying to understand how it worked.
"Harry what's wrong why are you crying?" Draco asked an edge of panic in his voice now.
When dinner was over they laid down cuddled up to each other watching some bad sitcom Draco had come to like. Harry couldn't pay attention as Draco kept carding his fingers through Harry's hair. He couldn't remember anyone touching him like this, sure he would get the occasional hug from Molly or Hermione, but not this type of intimate affection he never knew he'd been missing.
Harry felt his heart clench 'No he couldn't leave yet' Harry thought. "You could just stay here until school starts, it's only three weeks away. That way neither of us have to be alone the rest of break." Harry said looking up hesitantly.
Harry got up to say goodbye and found himself caught up in a quick hug.
"Er...Thanks." Harry mumbled.
Harry woke the next morning a ball of excited and nervous energy, so he decided to go work up in the garden for a while. At around noon he decided to go down and take a shower before grabbing lunch. He was just finishing up the dishes when the floo chimed in the drawing room. He raced upstairs and stopped before entering to take a deep breath. When he walked in he saw Draco's head in the fireplace.
‘Just kidding, Potter. Relax, I know what I’m doing,’ Malfoy said, and then he put his hands on Harry for real. They were warm against his cool skin and started treating his neck muscles. It didn’t take long before he did , indeed, relax. He tried to forget that it was Malfoy who gave him a massage, but didn’t succeed, so instead he just put up with it.
'Potter!' he exclaimed. 'What are you doing here on the floor?' The Gryffindor was quivering severely. 'You fool, why didn't you cast a warming spell?'
Harry was wide-eyed in astonishment. Although there where certain muscles that felt a little uncomfortable, the ones in his neck were not amongst them.
Draco's breath hitched from the erotic gesture. His hands came up and buried themselves in that shock of wild dark hair, which felt so much softer than he'd have thought.
When Harry didn’t move immediately, Malfoy rolled his eyes and said: ‘Come, I can’t look to see whether you’ve hurt yourself if you won’t sit down.’
This version of it is mine!
'No, that wasn't exactly what we did, as far as I recall, but right now I'm very interested what that second candy was supposed to do.' Draco observed Potter carefully. The Gryffindor tensed and looked everywhere but at him. 'Did it make you horny? Was it a lust potion or something, Potter?' he demanded. Potter shook his head while he flushed with embarrassment.
thought about it since it happened. Leaning back against a stone wall he closed his eyes for a moment. Although it could've been a girl – he shuddered at the thought of Millicent Bulstrode kissing him – he was sure it was a boy.
Oh no, not going there again!
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Harry, oh gods, Harry!’
Harry almost did the same when Malfoy leaned in and whispered against his ear: ‘Hush, Harry, just let me do my job.’
Malfoy arched an eyebrow and that reminded Harry about his fantasy last night again and … Fuck! He felt his cheeks heat up and wanted nothing more than to get the hell out of this place.
"The Twelve Days of Christmas" is an English Christmas carol. The song, published in England in 1780 without music as a chant or rhyme, is thought to be French in origin.
Harry really didn’t want to have tea with Malfoy, but he also didn’t want to wrestle with someone who was smaller than him, and had only one wand against his two. And Hermione would certainly give him a scolding if he let that house-elf serve tea for nothing, wouldn’t she?
The boy swallowed audibly and squeezed his hand. Then he casted a spell Draco'd never heard of, and a blindfold fastened itself around his head. Automatically he reached up and pulled at the fabric that covered his eyes, but found out that he couldn't move it one inch. He heard the other say, 'Finite', but noticed nothing out of the ordinary until he realized that it must have been a spell that had blinded him this time. Just long enough for the other to ask his permission to blindfold him.
While the pressure was building, those words triggered a memory and he remembered strong fingers grabbing him, holding on to him, while the fire roared around them. And suddenly it all came together and made sense; the daring moves of someone who kept his identity a secret, the familiar voice telling him, 'I'm amazed with all the possibilities that magic gives' and the certainty of the boy that Draco would hex him.
"You are going to pay for that Potter." Draco whispered through his teeth.
Harry had a sinking feeling in his stomach as Draco didn't start with a denial.
but that I also get to be the first to
Draco sighed. "I told myself during the war that if you won, and I made it through alive, I was going to do what I wanted. I would put my wants and needs above what my father wanted and expected. If I made it I would allow myself to be happy, and after the Final Battle all I could think about in my cell was how I could gain your forgiveness and actually be worthy of it. That letter was the first thing I did completely for me, and the rewards from it have surpassed even my highest expectations." He was smiling and Harry wanted to kiss him, so he did.
They talked throughout the meal drinking their wine slowly and then a second glass after that. It was almost eleven o'clock before Draco stood up and said he should be getting back.
"Yes, let's." He smiled back.
Kreature had just popped away after bringing him soup and a sandwich into the drawing room where he was watching a bad soap opera and having an existential crisis, when he heard tapping on the window. He raced across the room to let Zeus in and get to the letter tied to his leg.
"Will this do?" Harry asked with a smirk.
Draco leaned back and looked Harry in the eye, "Are you sure?"
Harry ran his thumbs over Draco's nipples, he leaned his head back with a groan deep in his chest. Harry nibbled and kissed Draco's collarbone, while his hands undid Draco's jeans. He lifted his hips so Harry could push both his jeans and pants down his long porcelain legs. Once they were both naked Draco pushed Harry back on one of the pillows.
"Back in sixth year I was a mess, I would wake up screaming and crying, it happened almost every night. Blaise and Theo were there every time to calm me down and comfort me. Yes they shared my bed and made me forget how shit my life was back then. Last night was the first time in a long time, but I had a nightmare and Theo was there to help me through." Draco frowned when Harry dropped his head and let his tears fall. Unable to hold back the pain anymore he let out a short sob.
Draco nodded his frown deepening.
"Yeah, fine, just thinking about what we have to do today." He lied, shaking off his thoughts.
Draco took his cock all the way down to the hilt and Harry had to grit his teeth to try not to lose the last if his restraint.
"I haven't laughed like that in years, I needed that." Harry said as they walked down the steps.
These were the thoughts plaguing Harry while he sipped his tea and waited for Draco to finish his first cup on that fourth morning.
Draco unbuttoned his jeans and pulled down the zip. He sat up and pulled down Harry's jeans then his pants. He looked down at Harry with a hungry expression, while Harry fidgeted insecurely under is gaze.
"Of course not," Harry said returning the smile.
"Umm, can we talk about something? Uh. You know about my uh… my map?" Harry stuttered out.
His heart was racing as he apparated just outside Andromeda's wards. He walked up to her front door, took a deep breath and knocked. He tried to hide his surprise when Narcissa opened the door instead of Andromeda.
"Yes Master Draco," Mim bowed and popped away. She popped back a moment later with four more elves behind her. Draco told them to unpack the painting supplies and bring them to the entrance hall (he wanted them to work their way up) and when they were done with that they could start cleaning every inch of the house.
Harry opened the door, led Draco into the entrance hall, and shut the door quietly behind him. He put a finger to his lips so Draco would be quiet and led him up the stairs. Draco looked around himself with a mixture of curiosity and barely concealed disgust. He relaxed a little as they entered the drawing room as it was at least clean and furnished.
Harry's heart sank, was Draco going to regret the kiss and act like it never happened? What of he didn't want to stay anymore or...
Harry pulled away from the kiss gulping for air, "Draco please." Harry plead, desperate for some relief.
Three weeks after that first letter their questions became a little more personal and a little less guarded as they got to know each other. Draco asked Harry what it was like growing up with muggles and what were his relatives like. It took Harry a full day to respond, he decided he could tell Draco the truth he just didn't want to put it all in writing.
Ron just mumbled, "righttt".
Draco then said, "Potter, what are you doing?"
"UP!", everyone shouted. Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but he was one of th few that did. Hermione's broom just rolled over, and Neville's hadn't moved at all. And Ron's? His just hit him in the face, which caused Harry to laugh and get told to Shut up by Ron. Once all the class got their broomsticks in their hands, Hooch showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off and walked up and down the road correcting their grips. Ron seemed delighted that Draco had been doing it wrong for years.
Harry then said, "What if the house made a mistake? You saw the looks the rest of the school gave me."
Ron then said, "I don't care what house I'm in, as long she's not in it"
Harry just nodded. And Draco continued, "Purebloods are families with no muggles or muggle-born in their families."
"Hey... Maybe we got off on the wrong foot. I'm just.. Nervous about all of this. I really don't fancy making a bad impression of myself, y'know?"
As Snape marched into the class, he spoke in a very edged and no nonsense tone, "There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incatations in this class." He then turned to the class, "As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few... Who possess the predisposition... I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even put a stopper in death."
Draco sneered, "Fine then. Tonight. Wands only, No contact."
Harry was shocked at this. He looked at Ron and Draco who both looked like they were about ready to fight. Before Harry could do anything to try to calm the situation down, Ron got up.
Ron then said, "Made it! Can you imagine the look on old McGonagall's face if she knew we were late?"
"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here."
But Neville started to float before the whistle came.
The feeling of annoyance slowly turned into embarrassment as the twins gawked at him. Harry began turning red when the call of their mother came to his rescue. The twins looked at Harry one last time and hopped off the train. With a sigh of relief, he sat down next to the window, half hiding himself. He then eavesdroped, sort of, on a conversation with the red haired family, mostly about how Fred and George not causing trouble, sending the sister a toilet seat, messing with the oldest brother Percy and something about being a prefect, and of course, meeting Harry Potter. The mother, however, came to his defense by saying he not something to be goggled at. After that, the boys then climbed on thr train and waved their goodbyes as the train began to depart.
Harry was interrupted by Madam Malkin, who told Draco he was all done.
"It's
They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor, and Harry could hear the drones of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right. The rest of the school must be here already. McGonagall then showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. The children crowded in, standing rather closer than they would've done.
"well.. No", said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.
Harry then just pushed back his bangs, showing his scar, "Yup".
The four held their breath for a while, Ron still having his wand still raised high. It was Hermione that spoke first.
Harry thought, "Oh, how welcoming."
"It's the same every year! Packed with muggles!
"Cheer up Harry.", Said Ron. "Snape's always taking off points for students.
"It's a Remembrall! Gran knows I forget things..". Neville's face fell when the Remembrall then was filled with red smoke. Neville seemed to have forgotten something. As he tried to remember what it was, Draco then snatched the ball out of his hand. Ron jumped to his feet, half hoping for a reason to fight Draco and Harry was more than prepared to jump between them. Professor McGonagall, however was able to spot trouble faster than any other teacher, was there in a flash.
Harry turned to see a family of 6 red hair people, the boys all with the same luggage as Harry. Harry then followed them as they stopped at a wall between 10 and 9.
Ron whispered to Harry, "So we've just got to try that on! I'll kill Fred! He was going on about wrestling a troll."
“I... AM AN EOD AGENT. EPP IT UP.” I found my old Xbox that still works and I’ve been playing true crime streets of LA xD
Thank you for reading my crappy little story! Unless Voldemort made you read it >_>
Harry and Ron were quickly becoming best friends. Even some of the Gryffindors had to admit that Harry didn’t seem that bad. Still, there was more than half of them convinced that he was playing an act and will strike, but Harry ignored them. Ron even tried to introduce Harry to Fred and George, to which Harry wasn’t sure he was ready for. To his surprise, the twins were welcoming to Harry and made him laugh with their stories and jokes. While they were friendly, to say his Slytherin roommates weren’t exactly pleased with his choice of Gryffindor friends, especially Draco. Harry did feel bad as he thought Draco felt abandoned by him. Harry saw Draco walking towards the Great Hall and sped up to catch him.
Harry then said, “Well, maybe if the two of you didn’t challenge each other to a wizard’s duel, we wouldn’t be in this mess!”
"Sorry", said Harry, not wanting to make an enemy before he got to school.
The Gryffindor students were trying to tell Neville that they weren't supposed to take off yet and Hooch was trying to calm Neville down before he could get any higher. This didn't work as he rose twelve feet-- twenty feet. Neville was begging his broom to go back down as the broom then was spinning him around. It then was able to to spin him off and make him fall off with a nasty thud and crack as he laid facedown on the grass. Hooch ran to Neville, and her face is as white as Neville's was.
"N-nothing. I'm fine"
Harry asked Ron, "How do they sort us into the houses?"
Ron then said, "why is he so bothered? If I had a toad, I'd lose it as soon as possible".
"And what is the difference between Monkshood and Wolfbane?"
He was about to say something, when he heard someone else. "Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner."
"Oi, Ron". Harry and Ron looked and saw the twins where there.
"Hello, Hogwarts dear?" She said, before Harry even had a chance to speak. "Get the lot here, another young man being fitted up just now".
Hagrid said, "The firs years, professor McGonagall."
Once everyone was ready, she then said, "When I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground hard. Keep your broom steady, rise a few feet, then come back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle-- three-- two".
Then Hagrid called, "No more'n four to a boat!" He pointed to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron got into a boat, followed by Neville and Hermione, to Ron's hidden displeasure.
Ron nodded, "Alright."
Hagrid just simply pointed, "Well there's your money, Harry. Gringotts, the Wizard bank. Ain't no safer place besides Hogwarts."
"Shut up, Malfoy!", snapped Parvsti Patil.
Harry asked, "What house are your brothers in?"
Ron quickly said, "Harry's my second. Who's yours?"
Harry noticed the teachers smiles had become fixed while the who school sang the school song, each with varying tones and times they sang. The song finally ended, as Dumbledore clapped the loudest.
Harry whined slightly. He wanted to try get Draco and Ron to get along, not to get into a duel. Harry had a lot to ponder until midnight.
Harry thought, "I was just taking notes..."
Ron was having enough of her and snarled, "You do it then, if you're so clever. Go on."
As grateful as Harry was that Ron tried to calm him down, it was next to impossible with his nerves in overdrive. His eyes have been fixed on the door, waiting for McGonagall to come back and lead him to his doom.
Ron shouted, visibly getting more and more frustrated as he shook his wand.
"Some hero. What if he got rid of You-Know-Who just to take his place?"
Now it was Harry's turn to give the boy a bit of a pointed look, "he's the gamekeeper."
Harry wanted to ask what a Mudblood was, but he decided against it, seeing how angry Draco was getting. As their desserts came, Harry looked up at the high table to see Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, hooked nose, and shallow skin. When the hooked nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban and straight into Harry's eyes, a sharp hot pain shot across the scar on his forehead.
Already on edge and getting annoyed with Peeves, Ron snapped at Peeves, “Get out of the way!” He swiped at Peeves, which was a big mistake.
Ron agreed to this and went off to join the other Gryffindors. Harry really couldn't believe his "Luck" sometimes. He tries to defuse a situation and another one comes up.
Harry then asked, "So you and Ron are purebloods?" Harry really didn't like that term.
After cleaning off all the paint, they ate dinner picnic style in the drawing room. Harry laid a blanket on the floor and put pillows in front of the couch so they could lean on them. Harry knew everything had changed, but it didn't feel any different. It was still easy they talked and laughed while they ate, there were no akward silences, just a content quiet of being in each other's company.
For the next three hours they looked through the magazines marking the pages they liked and writing down any ideas they got along the way.
"Sure, sounds good." He said, a bit breathless himself.
"Take care of yourself Harry." Hermione said as she hugged him.
With the twins help, the trunk was tucked away in a corner.
GRINGOTTS BREAK IN LATEST
Harry shrugged, "Maybe it was given to him from a family and has value to him"
"Good morning Madame Hooch", replied the class.
The boy was about to comment, but then his attention was directed to the front window, "I say, look at that man!"
"Urgh..." Harry then wiped the wand on the troll's trousers. No sooner than he did, a sudden slam and loud footsteps made the four look up. It was Professor McGonagall, Snape, and Quirrell. Quirrell took one look at the troll and let out a faint whimper and sat down on a toilet, Snape bent over the troll, while McGonagall looked at Harry, Draco, and Ron. Harry had never seen her so angry, and he wasn't so sure that just being in Slytherin would protect him from her wrath.
"What was that about you hexing me? You couldn't hit the side of a barn, Weasley."
Harry sighed and slumped back in his seat, "Ron, I'm really.. Really sorry about that. I didn't know he would..." Actually, Harry had some idea Draco would say something nasty. He just hopped Draco didn't.
correctly. The class tried to make their feathers float, but nobody was making theirs float. Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck.
There was a loud "Ooooohh" as the path opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrents and towers.
One of the Gryffindor boys sneered at Harry and said, "What do you want, Potter?"
"Don't the three of you care about your hoises?", said Hermione. She then looked at Harry, who still would rather be in bed, and said, "I thought you would be the one who would talk Malfoy out of this."
McGonagall then said, "The sorting ceremony will begin momentary." She then left the chamber.
After a while, Harry and Ron had to leave before dinner began, and said their goodbyes to Hagrid, who offered them some rock cakes, to which they politely declined to. As they walked back to the castle, Harry couldn't help but think. What was that package that Hagrid collected? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn't want to tell Harry?
"And now" Dumbledore continued, "Let us sing the school song!"
Draco just looked at Harry, "You don't know? Potter, how could you not??"
Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face and was started to see she was in tears.
The girl then piped up, "Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good is it?"
Harry's heart did somersaults, as he heard murmurs and whispers at first, but then the Slytherin table did the loudest cheer as Harry walked down to the table, avoiding the gaze of stunted and shocked students from the other tables, most notably Gryffindor. Some of the other Slytherin students began chanting, "WE GOT POTTER, WE GOT POTTER" as Harry sat near Draco, who looked more than happy to have Harry join him. As the sorting resumed and finished, Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He beamed at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more to see them.
Who said making friends was hard when you have to save each other from a troll?
"What on earth were you thinking?" She began, her voice cold with fury. Harry wished he could come up with something to keep them out of trouble, but couldn't find the words. He also wished Ron would put his wand down. McGonagall then continued, "You're lucky you weren't killed. Why weren't the four of you in your dormitories?"
Draco took a bite of the stew and groaned. "I didn't know you could cook, this is delicious."
"I invited Teddy and Andromeda as well but she said you were going over there for dinner." Molly said.
"What?" Harry asked.
Forgetting all about his tea, Harry summoned quill, ink, and parchment to write his response.
"Can I ask you a question?" Harry asked.
"Yes, this will suffice thank you." Draco said still chuckling.
"That's your prostate," Draco said breathing heavily.
"No Harry you saved Draco from the fire, and you spoke at both of our trials, let's call it even shall we?" She gave him another warm smile.
Harry was standing as Ron's best man so he had to be there an hour early with the rings, and to make sure Ron was ready on time. He stepped through the floo into the Burrow's living room.
Ginny jumped off the couch and ran over to give him a hug. He smiled a little as he hugged her back. They had decided at the beginning of the summer that they were happier as friends. She had gotten close to Neville during the previous year and they started dating shortly after the Battle. Harry was happy for them, they deserved to be happy.
This started somewhat of a routine, they began writing each other three or four times a day. They decided that it was best to get the 'hard stuff' over with first, so they talked about the war and Draco's father and their regrets and how things could have been different. Harry learned that after their trial Narcissa had reconciled with Andromeda and they decided she would do her house arrest at her sister's. Harry told Draco that Ron and Hermione had gotten married and that they would be coming home just before school started.
"Well before this summer I was a bit busy, and after we started talking I was afraid of ruining our new friendship if you didn't feel the same. You really liked me back in Fourth year?" Harry asked shyly.
Draco held his mother's chair our for her and walked aound his own chair and sat down. Harry hadn't noticed before, after being caught up in conversation, but Draco also had on muggle clothes. He was wearing a pair of muggle jeans that screamed designer, and a light grey buttondown shirt that he had untucked with the sleeves rolled up. Harry was glad Draco didn't try to hide the Mark, it was one of the 'hard' topics that came up when they first started writing. The fact that Draco was comfortable enough to show it made Harry, for some reason, inexplicably happy.
"It was always Zabini or Nott." He choked out.
Harry opened his eyes looking straight into grey pools full of emotion.
After Draco went through the floo Harry went up to bed. He couldn't believe he actually asked Draco Malloy to move in with him, sure it was temporary until they finished remodeling the house, but still. He couldn't help but wonder what Draco was like in the morning or what he looked like in pajamas. Then his mind started wandering thinking about the fact that he would be showering in his house and fuck he would be naked covered in water and soap with only a door between him and Harry. He was going to regret this, Draco was going to find out how Harry felt and their friendship would be ruined. He couldn't take it back now though, so he would just have to figure out a way to keep his feelings to himself, he could do that much, right?
"Yeah, come on through." Harry was pleased to find his voice was steady.
"How can you ask me that, you just told me the man that I love fucked another man and I'm just supposed to be ok with that!?" Harry said voice shrill at the end.
Draco raised a suspicious eyebrow, "What do you mean?"
"Can I see how it works?" Draco asked looking skeptical.
Harry let the breath out he was holding and smiled a little. Already sitting down to write his response.
"Yeah, I've got to be there by five so I have plenty of time for everyone" Harry replied.
Harry had moved into Grimmauld Place the day after the Final Battle, he couldn't stand to be around everyone at the Burrow. The grief over losing Fred was like a physical presence, and they were all trying to act normal and happy whenever Harry was around which made him feel guilty. So he packed up his trunk, grabbed his rucksack, and empty owl cage then moved into his Godfather's house for good. Kreature had been splitting his time between there and Hogwarts so the cleanup was slow, but Harry didn't mind, he was just glad he didn't have to pretend here.
Harry laid down his quill and reread the letter a few times contemplating whether or not to send it. He opened the drawer and pulled out the Hawthorn wand and placed it and the letter in an envelope. He handed it to the eagle owl and watched as it flew back out the window. He watched it until it had disappeared behind the clouds, and with it a weight he hadn't realized he had been carrying.
