“Unbelievable.”
Hello! Keeping my intro notes short and sweet this time :) Hope everybody's doing well and that y'all enjoy this chapter. Leave a comment if you feel like it too <3
Harry bites at his lip, because there isn’t much of a plan. First, he catches Bill up with all the information he’d given Molly, which is received with shocked nods and a low whistle when Harry reaches the end. “As of now, we’re waiting to hear how Kingsley is planning to proceed with this. Minerva wrote to him with minimal detail about the situation and assured him that Draco is innocent and somewhere safe, but there may be some issues due to his avoiding arrest and all. There are already Aurors out looking for him.”
“What do you want?” Draco asks. He tries to fight the shake in his voice, but fails.
“Do you mind if I…run something by you quickly?”
It all happens in two seconds.
Harry looks down, sees that he’s wearing powder blue pajamas. “I don’t know.”
This earns him a withering look. “What, just because I destroyed Voldemort it means I’m supposed to have some life path planned out for me? The Auror Corps makes sense, I suppose, but I don’t think I want to sign up for a life filled with more danger.”
She looks up and sighs, then looks back down at her book. “Hello, Draco. Something I can help you with?”
“These days it’s very much frowned upon, but only in the last century or so has that really changed, as far as I know,” Draco says. “Not exactly something I’m proud of. But I’m fairly certain there’s no inbreeding in the Malfoy line. I mean, look at me.” He waves a hand up and down his body, which earns him an overblown eye roll from Harry.
“I’ll bet he did. Thanks again, Draco.”
“Is everybody okay? What happened?”
Harry’s fingers twitch. “Fine.” It’s not like they’ve never been alone together; they dated for a significant enough period of time that the prospect of a one-on-one talk shouldn’t vex him at all. Her tone is dangerous though, a knife balancing on its blade.
“I don’t understand,” Harry says and collapses into a chair. Ron and Hermione follow suit as McGonagall sweeps around her desk and takes her own seat.
Ron glares at him now, too. “Oh, shut up. Don’t act like you’re not the best damn Seeker Hogwarts has seen in years. If we’re not on the same team, I might as well just drop out of the whole league.”
His pain has already subsided a good amount, luckily, but he can tell it’s largely in part to painkilling magic and not because of actual healing. Draco eyes the still smoking glass of Skele-Gro next to him, taking a deep breath. He doesn’t know when it was poured or how long it’s been sitting there, but it has to be done. He thinks about all that he’s missing already in the first week of classes, and that’s enough to guide his good hand toward the glass. He throws it back as quickly as he can, nearly gagging at the taste. Still, he has to be grateful that his bones are just horribly broken and not gone entirely. He’s heard regrowing bones is painful business.
Hermione gasps again. “Those Ministry officials I saw the other day. They were headed toward the dungeons!”
“Harry…”
Anyway, I don't have a lot of places to share info like this which is why I'm dumping it at the end of a fanfic update lol. Fellow writing nerds will probably understand my excitement though.
kinds of days.
Ron’s face suddenly goes dark, worried, and at first Harry thinks it’s something he’s said, but he turns and follows Ron’s eyes over his shoulder. Ginny and Luna have come back into the common room but something is wrong; Ginny’s eyes are bloodshot and her makeup is smudged, her cheeks a violent red. Luna pats her arm and tries to guide her discreetly through the crowd, but heads rotate toward them anyway.
here! Have you gone mental? If they discover you’re harboring me—”
Sure, there’s the issue of his father. Plenty of people are furious about that situation, but to resort to ancient, evil magic to punish
“Well, she has a whole week,” Hermione says.
“Oh,” he breathes, his chest tightening. He nods once and tries to play off the shock. “You’re saying that all of the Slytherins who are coming back fit in one compartment.”
“I won’t.”
and you’re just going to Apparate us somewhere?” Harry asks, holding the cloth in his hands.
Harry bites his lip and looks at the ground. Something warm swells in Draco’s chest as he watches Harry think.
“Harry, are you all right?”
“Look! Owls! Four of them!” Harry, Ron, and Ginny join her. Sure enough, there are four sets of flapping wings heading in their direction. Unable to wait, they sprint outside to the backyard, the dew of the grass soaking through Harry’s socks as he catches a letter addressed to him. They all tear them open with fumbling hands, the world moving in slow motion as they each read.
“The one in the Room of Requirement?”
Harry is grateful to wake up the following morning knowing it’s just another day, though reflecting on his birthday gives him an even deeper appreciation for the Weasleys and Hermione. Dinner had been just as momentous as breakfast, the table loaded with all of Harry’s favorite foods. Though Hermione said they hadn’t any presents for him, Harry was almost moved to tears when presented with a small box containing a golden Snitch.
“How could you, though?”
She laughs then, too, a high sound like tinkling bells, like fancy silverware being lain on a plate. “Of course I do. We just saw each other two days ago.”
Harry glares at Ron and Ginny. “Now you’ve gone and scared him off, really great stuff.” He looks after Leon’s retreating figure as Ginny makes some remark about the new kid not mattering, anyway, and huffs in frustration. He’s not usually one to intrude, but it feels to him like something serious might be going on with Leon.
“It’s…fine,” Leon says, looking down at his lap.
“Shit. I’m sorry,” Leon says, and what does
There’s a singular moment of pause where the world freezes, save for wails of pain. Then Madam Pomfrey shakes her head, swears under her breath, and rips the cork out of the vial.
She clicks her beak at him but is apparently satisfied as she takes off, gliding out the window and out of sight.
“I wanted to be able to see your face. You’re cute.”
question. Are you sure you’re okay? I hadn’t meant to draw attention to us like that, and then with your Patronus…”
The stag. Harry’s Patronus. Draco has a fuzzy memory of the night he was almost swallowed by stone, of his inability to do anything more than send a frantic ball of light for help. Right before Harry had arrived, his stag had stood at the other end of the corridor. The memory is hazy and frayed around the edges, but talking about Patronuses brings it back to him.
But wait. Who’s this? Another person has just come into Draco’s view, as if following after Harry as well.
Draco talks. He talks, and he talks, and it’s the most he’s ever spoken with his mother. Harry occasionally chimes in to fill in little details or correct mistakes or misinterpretations, but for the most part, Draco speaks. He tells her about the last few months at Hogwarts, and he tells her about the budding friendship with Harry. He finally comes clean about his stay in the Hospital Wing during which she’d visited him—his brush with death and the resulting blood magic—which earns him a severe look; a brief detour is made during which Narcissa lectures both of them about how dangerous blood magic is. Once this is done and she’s forced some biscuits on both of them, Draco tells her about Leon Laurent (Harry seems particularly nervous during this bit and Draco feels about the same) and Rowan Dorsey’s plan to rebuild Hogwarts as a Slytherin-only institution, and he tells her again that when the Aurors came, he panicked and Disapparated and ended up at the Potters’ home in Godric’s Hollow. All the while, nothing of the romance between himself and Harry comes up, and Harry gives him some questioning looks along the way, but for the most part he allows Draco to take the lead.
In silence, the two climb the stairs, feeling not like themselves but in this breath like one self, a singular body, a singular mind, a singular moment of shared trauma that will go unspoken of until a singular decision has been reached.
Blaise Zabini is the only other familiar face. There’s a blonde girl—a fourth year, he thinks— who gives him a bland look when he enters then goes back to staring out the window at the station wall. A very nervous looking younger boy who can’t be any older than a second year, sitting with a girl equal in anxiety but greater in age. They must be siblings; they have the same complexion, as well as the same eyes and hair color.
“Here, I’ll go first,” Harry says. He lays a hand on Draco’s elbow and smiles and Draco wants to leave his body but he’s also never wanted to be in it more. Draco takes Harry’s cue and steps aside. Harry utters the incantation, his voice calm, stable. Jut as Draco expects, his stag erupts from the tip of his wand and starts to prance around in the air.
is an off-limits topic?”
Harry nods, unsure how to respond but brimming with emotion, bursts of gratitude and warmth. “You’re okay with it, right?” he asks, already knowing the answer but needing to hear it explicitly. “With me being…gay?”
that, not even Ron. It was just speculation anyway.”
I uncharted territory here. I don’t even know what I’m feeling quite yet, which makes it hard to decide what to say to you.
“You can be honest with me,” Draco murmurs. “Something is wrong.”
“McGonagall said something about after effects,” Draco says, taking the glass from Potter.
“Ah, bollocks,” Harry mutters. They’re not directly outside the Room of Requirement as they’d hoped; instead, they’ve ended up just outside the Great Hall.
Draco clears his throat, his cheeks burning. “Harry.” He turns back to McGonagall. “Thank you for everything,” he says as he stands up. “I’ll leave you two to your meeting.”
“And yet, something about it seems to make sense.”
“It must have worked,” Harry says as Draco leads him. “Otherwise we’d have run into some Aurors or something on our way up.”
“It’s not so much the falling asleep as the waking up.”
, Draco thinks.
Draco nods, his chest still heaving. Suddenly, he doesn’t want to say the words, already knows exactly how Harry will react. But people might be in danger. He grabs Harry’s forearm, as if maybe physical contact will help Harry feel that Draco is telling him the truth “I just saw Leon in the dungeons again—
Harry bites at the inside of his cheek, noting that Eva and Bella are both in possession of the newest Firebolt model.
in?” Draco guesses.
Hello everyone!! The last chapter had some mixed reviews (especially everything regarding Leon) so for those of you who aren't much fans of him, I can tell you that he is absent entirely from this chapter! Nothing but Drarry friendship (?) goodness here. This is also essentially the last chapter from Draco's perspective in the first act of this fic; we'll get one more from Harry before moving into more meaty plot stuff!! Very excited that I've been so motivated to write this and hoping you're all enjoying it :)
Mari smiles. “We can use the desks instead if you’d like. I just know that for me, it’s easier to be emotionally open if you're physically comfortable. Whatever works best for you is what we’ll do.”
“You seem so much more collected about everything,” Harry says and reaches up to run a hand over Draco’s hair.
“That’s not what I’m saying at all! This
“Let’s go,” she says, turning him around. “I’ve got snacks in my office, and it sounds like we have a lot to talk about.”
assistance—is unheard of in Pure-blood society.
She lays back on the couch, covering her face with her hands. Luna pats her shoulder.
. I couldn’t tell what was happening. Does he not like me back? Did I fuck things up completely? Has he lost all respect for me because I’m gay? I know. In this moment, those thoughts all sound ridiculous. But imagine my state of mind when you cut me off. I have friends from Beauxbatons, but you were my only real tie to Hogwarts. You still are.
He frowns. “Not very hopeful.”
Draco grins. “I try to make a habit of it.”
, had seemed so hot and cold. Draco does suppose he’d given him the wrong impression and sounded ungrateful for his saving him, but in his defense the circumstances overall were absolutely bizarre. There’s something else, too, something Draco can’t place but also something he can’t shake. It feels something like a seed of a larger realization, but there are too many things going on in his head to really nourish it.
, that might bring him joy, but comes up empty. No. He is
“Can I ask what this is about?”
He finds himself smiling as Draco Malfoy strolls onto the field with Blaise Zabini. They’ll both get through, for sure. It’ll be good to have some Slytherin representation in the league.
Just leftover things from the war that he hasn’t dealt with yet, he supposes. With teaching, taking classes, and Quidditch tryouts coming up in the afternoon, his mind hasn’t been in one place for much time these days.
There’s a pause, but then she says, “Positive. My father used to cut hair to pay his way through dental school, and he taught me when I was younger. I always practiced on him, so I know how to cut a boy’s hair, if that’s what you’re worried about.”
I would just like to let you know that I’m smiling like an idiot writing this. I know what you mean about things seeming so bleak. It’s overdramatic, but there were so many days when I thought I wouldn’t smile again, and now I can’t stop.
He steps toward her and kisses her on the cheek. “And you,” he says. “Well, more beautiful than dapper, I suppose.”
“No, nothing like that,” Draco says.
,” he says, hoping Harry will trust him at least this much.
Draco stammers over his response. “I—I don’t know, she, I just heard a scream and she was trapped.”
“You’ve gone mental.”
It feels a bad time to ask if her own responsibility in the matter has anything to do with that, so Harry keeps his mouth shut. He’s not as emotionally ignorant as he once was. He can see that Hermione is projecting, and even despite being in the middle of the monarch of all shitty days, he accepts the brunt of her anger. If only to make her feel better.
Her question gets lost as Ron approaches and sticks out a hand for Bill to shake; he ignores this and pulls Ron into a hug that cracks his back. “Ow, get off,” Ron grumbles. Bill just tightens the grip with one arm and munches the apple with his other.
Any awkwardness about the rumors is broken with this one statement and most of the others laugh. Harry smiles and shakes his head slightly. Draco is shocked that he’s taking it in stride like this.
Draco realizes his heart is beating like crazy and he takes a deep breath.
His name is written on the front in handwriting he doesn’t recognize; he narrows his eyes at the text, unsure of who would be writing him. He tears it open, his hands shaking slightly.
“But it does, Harry. We just want you to be happy,” Hermione says gently.
Harry counts off and a symphony of incantations fill the room. Only two wands sail through the air, which either means the shield charms are good or the disarming charms are not. Harry chooses to believe the former having seen the progress made in the previous class.
, he thinks, over and over, pounding the thought until it feels like he’s said it out loud.
Draco sits forward, his stomach sinking. “I can’t let you risk it. What if that’s not true? They’ll immediately know we’re together and you’ll be in serious trouble. Not even your reputation would save you if people found out you were harboring me.”
“No. Absolutely not, Hermione, you can’t just—.”
She nods. “Fair point. You’re lucky you caught me in the library or I might’ve hexed you into next week.”
“He won’t be in any trouble for the death of the Dorseys, no. I’ve already spoken to the Minister, and he agrees that—while tragic that Pamela got caught up in all of it—ultimately, it was an act of self preservation committed under extremely pressing circumstances.”
“Since recently. Some things have happened that sort of opened my eyes. I haven’t given it a lot of thought, honestly. But right now it’s the only idea for my future that has a semblance of weight.”
“Well, yes, it’s serious, but it’s not
“You never do.”
“We were so excited, I suppose. And, well, it’s something I try not to think about too often…”
“What—”
“Just yesterday.”
Draco has his wand out in front of him and his breath held. Now that everybody is safe—
He laughs out loud. It’s Mari.
“When the Death Eaters broke into the school, my best friend and I hid right away. It just seemed like the thing to do initially, you know? Your instincts kick in and you fight or you flee. We almost managed to make it out of the school, but… I wasn’t sure where my sister was, I couldn’t find Ariana—” The name strikes something inside Harry. “...and I just couldn’t bring myself to leave not knowing... I asked whoever I could find if they had seen her, but everybody was so panicked that they weren’t really paying attention to what was going on around them or who they saw.”
Draco shrugs. “Perhaps he wants to take a more casual approach to our final year.” Highly unlikely; Blaise simply isn’t fond of Slughorn and has been avoiding him.
“I didn’t say that. Maybe if you’re explicit in your desire to be his date, he’ll choose you over him. I know I would.”
Draco’s soul almost separates from his body when Blaise clears his throat next to him. As he clutches his chest and turns to his roommate, he’s almost equally as shocked to see that Blaise is smirking.
“Sorry about that whole partner deal. I’ll try to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”
“No,” Harry says and places a hand on Leon’s knee. He wishes he could just make this simple gesture without doubt, but finds himself glancing around to see if anybody is watching. When he’s sure they’re not, he continues. “I really like you, Leon.
She nods. “That’s just life, Harry. If you think you truly know what’s going on at any given moment, you might be a bit delusional.” She gives him a moony smile. “I’m glad you told me, even if I already knew. That’s what friends do, after all.”
“Harry, we finally have a chance for a life that’s halfway normal. You can’t keep throwing your life around the way you used to. It’s very heroic of you, but it’s also stupid and arrogant and if you die—if you die
Something is still nagging at Draco, and he realizes there’s a question he’d meant to ask that got lost in all of the emotion. “Harry, why are you so sure that nobody will be able to find me here? If they’re searching and exhaust their options, what’s to stop the Ministry from sending a team of Aurors? I’m sure they’ll realize our connection sooner or later.”
“Th-that’s what the hat said.”
It felt like the whole world had come to a stop. Potter had
“Well of course she didn’t want to open up to you! Fucking Savior of the Wizarding World. How was she supposed to open up to that? What do you know of abuse? Some bullshit story of living in a cupboard—
“Potter you can’t just
“Perhaps.”
“Sure.” Harry said, slipping off his shoes as he settled on the covers next to her, “Which one do you want to hear?”
“I say just put it on the grill!” Ron hollered.
“You should take care of yourself if only to keep your daughter from worrying about you. She’s had enough to worry about as a child already.” Malfoy said, his nose turned in the air.
“Want to open the box of toys?” Draco asked, pushing Harry into the room.
“I was wondering if it would work with protection charms as well?”
like he used to. Draco seemed to know what he was thinking because he winked at Harry as they climbed up the last steps.
“But you still only fuck me even though you could probably fuck him too.” Draco said happily, then frowned, “I’m worse than a thirteen year old Hufflepuff. Blubbering on with feelings ‘n such. It’s ridiculous. Tell me never to do this again Harry.”
“Yeah—maybe food first. I’m actually feeling hungry.” Harry rolled onto his back.
“You opinion means a great deal to me.” Draco said.
“I think I learned a lot when I was young.” Draco looked a bit awkward, “My family was obsessed with me becoming an alpha. Being well endowed is an early sign, but it’s not absolute. I read every book I could find to see if I was showing early signs of being an Alpha. Of course I second guessed everything because I knew I wanted it so much. My father would have written me out of the will if I presented as Omega.” He frowned, “It’s an old way of thinking. Omega females are coveted in pureblood families. Omega males are put down.”
“They’re both young—your entire team needs more experience to get better.” Harry said.

“Well, how do you know I like you if I don’t buy you things?” Draco asked.
“Do you think you are well enough to be fully bonded?” Draco asked, setting down his mug of tea.
“It’s not that.” Potter cut him off, biting his lip.
“Wormtail was a Gryffindor, and I think he is an excellent example of how Gryffindors can betray people for gain as well.” Harry said, “And Snape, even though he was an absolute bastard, protected me in some ways most of my life. The muggles who raised me were not kind to me, but I still believe muggles deserve a chance.”
“And it’s
“We just de-gnomed the garden two weeks ago.” Harry said.
“My place after this?”
“Just give me a minute.”
“Yeah, I dropped it by the floo because I need to go home to get clothes—I mean, I think I still have to stay until Blaise checks me out tomorrow.” Harry wished he hadn’t made a huge breakfast
She was quiet for a moment, “We can go together tomorrow if you’d like. If anyone gives you grief, I’ll punch them.” She grinned. Draco couldn’t help but laugh. And to be honest, he would bet on Lindsey over many of the witches and wizards there.
“Yeah.”
“I know that!” Winston yelled, “I saw her chart. It’s only an optimistic hope she’ll keep her legs, let alone her life.”
“Right—so you just lie in bed and tell me what to do.”
“You go to school to learn how to run a business?”
“Did it take you forever to do the Arithmancy?”
“You will be alright too Bug.” Harry squeezed her a bit tighter, “It’s a magical place, I promise. And you write me tonight—Malfoy and I have a bet.”
“Take you?” Harry asked.
Harry let out a sigh, “Hermione said I’m getting too many too fast.”
“You’ll get more?” Draco asked.
“Draco.” He told her.
That got Draco thinking about the hordes of jewelry back at the Manor that collected dust. He was thinking about making a list as he plopped down his bag in DADA. He pulled out a roll of parchment and a quill.
“Can you take your shirt off?”
“Hermione was receptive. Said it was good to see me look happy—apparently I haven’t in a long time—and rested.” His blush deepened as he wrapped his arms around his legs, “She said she was glad I was going to be a curse breaker, said I’m good at figuring out puzzles.” He obviously looked chuffed at Hermione’s compliment, “She has concerns but—like I said, she’s receptive.”
Draco ached from holding himself open, so he moved his legs to wrap around Harry. Harry collapsed on top of Draco, his softening cock still inside Draco as he kissed down his collarbone and licked clean the semen.
“Luna Lovegood.” Draco answered, and Isaac grinned.
“Because you’ll say to yourself—I thought I loved him then. Love grows.”
Draco was trying very
“Taste of this poison is paradise?” Potter asked as Britany sang it.
“Let me know when you send out invites.” Sammy insisted and Draco nodded before glancing at the clock—it was nearly time, “You alright Draco? You know if you need anything that I can help.”
“I do.” Potter replied, “But I don’t want to leave you alone.” It was honest, straight forward—something Draco wasn’t really used to.
Draco sighed, running his fingers through his damp hair, “I didn’t know if it was going to be a one off. And if it was—I saw no point of telling you. Potter and I would both be a bit awkward around each other, but that’s nothing new. But then—” Draco allowed himself to smile, “I dunno. We had fun, I owled him about Rachel’s case and we saw each other again. We went out to dinner and we had a great time. We
“He’s making the rattling sound?”
It was two days after Zabini had started trying to care for Harry too that the pain started. It hurt in his arse which made him extremely reluctant to tell anyone. If he would just keep his eyes closed long enough, it would go away. Hermione and Ron had gone out briefly for lunch, Harry had insisted they get real food somewhere else and he would be
“Potter! You fucking
Slytherins to turn out that way, I think you’ll find we will surprise you.”
“My last relationship was with Joseph Lawrence—he works at Gringotts. That was about six months ago? About? We dated for about the same amount of time.” Draco said.
“I still think you’re a prat—you stick up your nose at things, and sometimes you’re condescending. But you’re not all bad.”
yes.” Potter gasped as Draco moved. He sat back on his legs, tossing one of Potter’s legs over his shoulder. The deeper angle made Potter groan, his hands went back to brace himself on the headboard, “I won’t break.” Potter told him.
Harry snorted, “I don’t even get away with trying to boss you around.” James grinned, “Our plan is to write our side of the story in the Quibbler, once we decide it’s time. I’ll let you know before it happens.”
Draco couldn’t quite believe it as Potter kissed the knob above his arse, then moved slightly lower.
“I promise I won’t hold your past against you—unless you invoke it.” Harry gave a hard look, “And same goes for you too—if you need anything, let me know.”
“You can always chop off your nose and try.” Draco teased, and Harry’s shoulders relaxed even more. He put his legs down on the ground as he laughed, opening himself back up.
“I’m confident—just realistic. I’m a former Death Eater. I don’t exactly have lines of people wanting date me—plenty wanting a bad boy for the evening.”
“Technically you were late first.” Harry pointed out as he flopped down on the chair across from her desk.
“Yes enough!” She said, a tear falling down her face. She wrapped her arms around herself, “You paid for your crimes.”
“What are you guys looking at?” James asked.
“I know.”
Hermione bit her lip, “I deserved that.” She let out a breath, “Harry seems really happy.” Draco nodded, staying silent. She shuffled around a bit, “I’m sorry. I guess I always thought Ginny and Harry would get back together after they dated around a bit. She’s one of my best friends too.”
“Worry about what?” Harry asked.
“Hornbeam is said to gravitate towards those with lifelong obsessions—at least this one has served you well.” Draco carefully handed it back to Viktor.
“I love Pinot Noir.” Draco hummed excitedly, pouring glasses for each of them.
Harry actually smiled, “I’m only taking coffee orders—or tea, or maybe a scone?”
“Not to go again without my permission because he is twelve years old.” Harry said, “I couldn’t get mad at him—I don’t want him to hide from me. I didn’t realize he was scared to talk to me about being a Slytherin.”
“No—not even the first one murdered. But—youngest one murdered.” Draco acquiesced.
There had been some flops and some areas that had been a little difficult to work through. They found out the hard way that if Draco was too emotionally drained or if Harry was too tired, they should just fuck. There became this weird pressure to do something new and creative every time, but they worked through that bit too.
He rolled over and saw Harry sitting on the edge of the bed, staring at the beautiful city below. The sun was shining bright with blue skies. Harry had a cup of tea in his hand, blowing into it carefully to cool it off. Draco saw a few scratch marks on his back from the night before and couldn’t help his possessive grin. Harry had removed the bandage, the dragon curled around his bicep. Draco sat up, crawling over to Harry. He slid one leg on either side, wrapping his arms around his waist and kissing his shoulder.
“Last night while I was walking.” Draco hissed as his skin stuck to the sock. He managed to pull the one all the way off, but glared at the other sock. He huffed before starting to peal the sock off. Harry came back with the paste just as he managed to pull it off, “
Harry snorted, “You’d fit right in—I remind aurors that all the time.”
starting to get used to it.
“Is that why you became a mind healer? To force people to talk to you?”
“Andy is making breakfast if you want anything.” Draco said, he didn’t need Blaise to apologize. Blaise nodded and walked out of the bedroom, squeezing his shoulder for a moment before walking down the steps.
“Is that it?”
“Have you considered tattoos?” She asked, pivoting away slightly.
“Was my boyfriend here last night?” Draco asked, performing a teeth cleaning charm as soon as he grabbed his wand.
“I have that and schnapps, something with low alcohol content.”
“Of course he does, Harry!” Draco argued, “But that doesn’t mean you haven’t
“Stinging hex.” Draco managed to mumble, his throat closing with emotion. It was like now that he could relax, all the tears he hadn’t shed crept up.
“Do you mind making sure no one else comes in here Myrtle?” Draco asked.
“You could floo back home.” Potter said, closing his bedroom door just as the lock was rattling.
“Y-you did?” Harry asked, looking at him.
Draco made a choked sob sound, “
“Did the Prophet find out?” Harry asked.
“The principle still applies. You have lost sight of the fact that your friend is human. Just like the rest of us.” Hermione bit her lip, clearly trying to digest what Draco had said. It was still quiet when there was a knock on the door. Hermione got up and walked over to it.
“Hugo misses Rose too, not that he would admit to that either.” Hermione said with a laugh, “We’ll see you on Sunday at the Burrow?”
“Potter.” Draco warned, glaring at him.
“Holy fuck.” Ron sat down on the floor, “Who do you think it was?”
, I thought after the Dark Lord fell all this
The first floo call he made was to Hermione and Ron.
“Oh.” Peter sounded disappointed, “I thought it was because you had special powers or something because you’re the Chosen One.”
“How did Hermione forgive him?”
Harry couldn’t contain his shock, “I—I didn’t know.”
“I can do that.” Draco said strongly.
“Do you have plans for tonight then?” Draco asked.
“No, this is.” Potter produced a tile, “It’s made with a Protean Charm. It’s how he calls me back into the office. He must have found out I finished this case.”
Georgia, she had lost her brother a few months ago, squeezed Harry’s arm as he sat down. Her eyes were lit with concern; she had probably kept up with the articles. It was all over the Prophet. On top of everything else, the auror department’s efficiency was being called into question because of these three women. Harry was beginning to agree with the articles, but not for the reasons they had been suggesting. Fucking Rita. Harry drank some more water, ignoring his food as he listened to Rivka talk about losing her father.
“Can you tell me a story?”
“Not recently.” Ron argued.
“No it wasn’t.” Harry agreed, “I’m very glad Greyback is in Azkaban.”
“Out of the two of us, I think you have name that doesn’t sound real
“Draco.” Harry called to him, an edge of desperation in his voice. Draco rubbed Harry’s leg, moving closer to him. He grabbed the lube on the side table, running it over Harry’s hole. His finger slips in easily. The rim job obviously opened Harry up. Draco slid two fingers in with ease, and Harry bucked back on them. Draco didn’t spend much time with his fingers lubed inside Harry, wanting him to feel the burn. Opening Harry’s legs a bit, Draco held his cock and concentrated on pushing inside.
He looked over at the clock and it was a little past three a.m. before he took another bite of lasagna.
“Is that a good or bad thing?” Potter asked with a laugh.
“No work!” Luna said
“I’m not above knocking out a patient for his or her wellbeing.” Draco told him, “Give me my napkin back.”
“I think it’s perfect.” She said as she sat in one of the chairs opposite his desk. He had done some hunting to find the chairs. One of them had been in the attic of Grimmauld place and the other in an unused room in St. Mungo’s. They went together and were comfortable enough, “When’s the big move?”
“You don’t have to Draco.” Isaac said strongly, “If you’re not ready.”
“What are you going to get?” Draco asked as they walked up to Guinevere’s tattoo shop.
He pulled off his robe, sending it to the wash. It was nearly eight at night, so he ordered take out rather than make food. Hermione wasn’t home—she and Ronald were having a couple’s weekend far away from Draco. He had been excited to have the apartment to himself, but now he wanted her company if only he wouldn’t be alone. There was a knock on the door, signaling his food was here. He opened it up to give the man his money. He was soaked from the rain.
“Yup. Going to my room. Got it.” Harry scooped Draco up.
“Should I shave my beard?” Harry asked.
with someone to get revenge.”
“How long have I been out?”
“You would have had to mean it.” Harry said softly.
“I’d like to have a bit more.” Harry said with a grin.
?” Albus grumbled as he walked up, “You think they’d be used to seeing you at the train station by now.”
“You don’t need to look Draco.” Harry had him pinned to the ground as Draco sobbed but tried to get up.
“Shoes?”
Hermione do anything.” Draco snapped, “She wanted to live with me, so now we do.”
After she put on the stencil and pulled out the equipment, Draco tugged his hand, “Last chance to back out.”
“We never even said it out loud.” Malfoy said with a wave of his free hand.
last time.” Ron argued with a sigh.
“Master Draco.” She appeared, “Master Harry!” She looked distressed, “Yous don’t look good at all, should Winky get Madam Pumfrey?”
“He was just interrogated by my entire family. I’m surprised he’s still alive.” The Weasel said, looking a bit sheepish, “George was upset. My mother was—very upset. Hermione’s indifference didn’t help.”
“I’ll admit it’s nice to watch him get mad at someone else.” He was startled by McGonagall’s loud laughter.
“But you’re moving on!” Albus declared.
“Well—the only person that could have changed the wards so seamlessly is your mother.”
Draco had never sipped on coffee and gotten a blowjob before, but it was pretty fucking excellent.
“Yeah.”
“I like nice shampoo! It doesn’t hurt anyone to bring my own stuff!” Draco argued, “Plus you seem to like running your hands through my hair—not so much!” He cried out as Harry dumped too much product in his hand. Harry managed to put some back in the bottle and it was a reasonable amount, “Move.”
“I—yes—I’m sure.” Harry was grateful Draco went slow as he moved his fingers into Harry. His fingers gripped Malfoy’s arms so tightly he was sure to have marks. Harry made a choked groan.
“Thank you Mr. Potter.”
“Master Isaac sir.” He appeared quickly.
Harry snorted, “Never.”
“How were they?” Harry asked.
It was more comfortable conversation for the rest of the night. They stuck to Diagon business and quidditch, because it seemed Draco and George could agree on most things in those topics. Draco had stretched his arm around Harry’s shoulder since they had moved to the couch. It was comforting to have his scent closer. George and Draco were talking some particulars about a board meeting with the Diagon Business Bureau. Harry usually would want to participate, but he wanted the two of them to bond. He also was a bit tired. He loved the smell of George being content combined with his alpha’s. George smelled like mischief—like at any moment something could happen. Like camp fires and cinnamon. Draco didn’t smell like that at all. He was a warm blanket and a cool spring morning that promised a sunny day.
“Where is Harry?”
“You said to get you when it was six.” She tucked her hair behind her ear.
feelings, which Harry was very relieved to see written down. He had been told it was true, but seeing another omega write it made him believe it more. It went both ways too—which meant Malfoy was being a bit kinder to him. Which explained is stark transition when they were alone rather than in the hospital.
“Yes?”
“Did you want me to leave?” Harry asked, feeling like his heart was on the line.
It turned out weaving protective charms into copper, leather and other bits needed actual weaving, and the patience of Job. Draco had that. The first piece he created was small, a bracelet. It was a simple shield charm that would activate if someone shot an unfriendly hex. It wouldn’t protect against something too dark, but it would anything mild.
“Yes.” Draco nodded, “She had a femoral fracture in her right leg as well as a radius and ulna fracture on her left arm.” The ME confirmed that the body in front of her had both of those injuries, “She has several healed over broken ribs. Muggle pins were also put in her left humerus.” He rattled off where they would be, and the ME confirmed each of them. Draco knew it was Rachel.
“I’m going to—fuck.” Harry groaned, kissing Draco’s lips as his hips twitched and his cock jumped in Draco’s hand. Draco could feel him come rather than see it, kissing Potter’s jaw. The slickness only made Draco like it more, the one finger in his arse growing more bold and deeper, “Don’t come.” Potter said, holding off his hand.
“Yes.” Harry answered, nodding a bit too aggressively, “Why aren’t you? You took a
“Swap stories on our sad lives?”
Draco blushed and Harry put his head on the table, covering his head with his hands.
“He’s here?” He sounded concerned for a man who was angry with his best friend.
“I know.” Harry said, “And I’m not necessarily comfortable pimping myself out either.” He meant it as a joke, but it fell a little flat. He didn’t really want to have sex in order to live. It wasn’t fair that his body wouldn’t let him survive without it.
“Harry.” Draco managed to say again. But consciousness was too difficult to hold on to, so he passed out again.
. He supposed he could drink that much when he was young, but anymore the headaches the next day got worse and worse. He was glad Lily had stopped being vegan, it made it so much easier to have things for her to eat while she stayed. She stepped down to a pescatarian diet. Harry tried not to be too enthusiastic about it so she didn’t go back to being vegan.
“All?” Draco asked with his eyebrow raised.
“I’m sorry.” Draco felt empty, he wasn’t really sure what was happening as Harry started to take off his wet clothes. They fell with wet slaps on the ground, and Draco just stared at his robe. Harry had pulled out his mobile as he continued to undress Draco.
Harry dropped the bread into the frying pan, “I’m glad you aren’t.” He frowned at the French toast cooking. What would he do without Lily next year? He was surprised when strong arms gripped his waist tightly, Lily buried her face into his side. He leaned down and picked her up, and she wrapped her legs around his waist and put her head on his shoulder, “Soon you’ll be too big for this.”
“Alright, I have to go back to work anyway. See you on Monday.”
“You think having them over to dinner is a good idea?” Greg asked, he looked around nervously like he was waiting for Hermione to hex him.
“Should I throw rocks at it?”
“Winky would
“I was not an angsty teen.” Draco sniffed.
“I agree with Potter.” Draco then held his hand to his chest, “I can’t believe I just said that.”
“No.” Blaise said, “Just when I know I’m going to win.”
“Yes.” Aiden said instantly.
“I would never give Rita the satisfaction.” Draco said with a scrunched nose as he poured more wine into his glass, “Not after what she said about Astoria.”
“You nearly killed me, you insulted Hermione, you’re the reason Bill has scars. Your family has
“Y-you did?”
Harry bit his lip, but Draco turned away from him and continued to cook. He was shaking a bit as he fixed up the ingredients. He could hear them chatting behind him, but he didn’t really pay attention. He could nearly smell Greyback. It took a few seconds, letting out slow and steady breaths to regain composure.
“You can be the big spoon another time.” Draco told him as he stepped into the water. He slid his legs outside of Harry’s, sighing as the water sloshed around his chest. Harry eased back, his head on Draco’s chest.
“How come you can touch him?” One first year asked as he pointed at Harry.
Draco turned around without waiting for another word and marched out of the room. His heals echoed down the halls, and he purposefully made them as loud as possible. He headed to a completely different wing—the guest wing of the house—in order to get away. It was a habit he had when he was a kid too. He climbed up the marble steps, and eventually made his way to one of his favorite spots. It was an outdoor balcony, overlooking the side lawns. There was a bottle of his favorite cognac under a slight chilling spell. He grabbed a free glass and eagerly poured it into the cup. The burn hit his lips as he washed down his anger. Though part of him still wanted to hurl the glass and hear it shatter.
“Five years.” Harry whispered softly, he thought Ginny’s year long decline had been awful.
Draco frowned, “That too.” That was actually true of some of the people he brought home—not that he would ever tell Hermione that.
“Yes I am.” Draco answered, not caring. Draco sat in silence, refusing to apologize for it. She opened her mouth to speak again right as the floo went off, Harry tumbled out of it because he was bloody awful at taking the floo.
got to serve detention together.”
“Yes. We’re doing this.”
Then Draco took Harry in his mouth again. This time with his fingers gently rolling his balls, Draco rolled his tongue a bit. Harry yanked on the cuffs again, a light gasp escaping his lips. He got Harry as close as he dared before pulling away, continuing to fondle his balls a bit. Draco looked at Harry’s face, his brow was furrowed and his eyes pinched shut.
“The Weaselette had great things to say about me—I’m sure. I nearly killed one brother, let a werewolf into the castle that permanently marred her other brother. I made her life and her brothers’ lives miserable every chance I got!”
“Is he there?”
“Be there in a moment!” Malfoy’s voice called from the back.
Draco made an exasperated sound, “This is why I don’t like couple showers. There is nowhere to put my foot up with any sort of traction. You can’t fuck me in here.”
“You’re welcome—”
Flitwick insisted on wearing it to test it out. Draco was nervous when he shot the hex, but was relieved when it bounced off harmlessly.
“She doesn’t like to tell other people’s secrets.”
“Neville, Luna, Ron and I—Blaise might come too, and probably Hannah.”
“Everything alright?” Hermione asked, looking bleary eyed and well rusted the fucker.
One of the worst moments in his life. But he was forgiven, just like that—in a moment. Draco kept his eyes open, not wanting to close them and see Dumbledore’s staring back at him. He wasn’t quite sure if he was upset or not, but it helped to just stand there for a few moments. When he felt like he was ready, he pushed up off the wall and walked to Slytherin House.
Potter let out a shaky breath, nodding.
“Oh fine—but because people are arses. I have a reputation to uphold—I’m not letting you leave here like this.” Draco told him. The man grinned despite his obvious fatigue.
“About being an auror?” Hermione asked.
“Ok.” Harry frowned, but his eyes were fluttering shut on their own accord, “Gunna take a nap.” He didn’t hear the answer before he passed out.
Draco slid into the booth, “Sorry I’m late.”
.” Draco groaned, “I’m going to die before you fuck me.”
“Our beaters need work.” Albus said.
“Is this one of your creatures that isn’t real?” Draco asked with a sigh. Granger tensed, but Luna just laughed.
“I’ve heard about the infamous Truth Rum.” Draco said.
“Guilt mostly.” Draco wasn’t expecting that honest of an answer, and it didn’t look like Potter had expected it either, “Always more people in danger.”
“I have no idea who that is, but sure.” Potter said with a shrug.
“You look stressed too my dear.” His mother said not too kindly.
“That would require you to suck a cock long enough to get a husband.”
“Why?” Hermione asked and Harry turned to her.
“Well hurry up in there, that man looked eager to have you join him.” Sherry smiled at Draco.
apply.” Hagrid’s eyes were twinkling and he looked
to come home and not hurt myself on shoes, but then I feel guilty for being happy that I don’t miss her shoes.” Harry confessed, scrunching up his nose as he said it.
“He’s been through a lot.”
to see if this was a good fucking idea first?”
Viktor rolled his eyes, “I am very glad you are recovering—what of your injuries?”
“They speculated—you know.” James looked uncomfortable.
“I was a Horcrux. I didn’t know until that night. But I had a piece of Riddle’s soul in me since the day he tried to kill me the first time. It’s why I felt connected to him my whole life—why I knew what he was up to sometimes.” Potter rubbed his scar then realized he was doing it and abruptly dropped his hand. “I went to this like—dream place? I dunno if it was real. But I saw the Horcrux die and got to decide whether I wanted to come back or not.” Draco stared at Potter, not quite believing it. But Potter’s face was so serious and drawn, that Draco knew that Potter was telling the truth, “I didn’t immediately say yes. I-I-I was just so t-tired.” Potter was shaking again, “Then I c-came back-back here w-where friends d-died and-and I-I-I-I didn’t. And-and I feel-feel–feel aw-aw-awful. I f-f-feel like I’m be-be-being dis-dis-dis-dis-dis-respect-disrespectful of th-their lives. W-why me?” Potter cleared his throat, “I-I d-don’t be-belong h-here.”
“Covers it up and helps if I am bleeding.” Draco answered. Saying it out loud made Draco realize even
Antonio nodded but Harry said, “We’ll be out of here soon.”
Potter of course laughed, because he’s a Gryffindor, “Please fuck me—you fingered me until I nearly came like three times—I’m going to get off quick.” Harry promised.
“Do I get to see the sacred Golden Trio Rituals now?”
Potter laughed, “No—I’ve seen bigger.”
“Well that’s just disappointing.” Draco said, “I’ve been telling everyone you wrestled bears.” The closer they got to the Three Broomsticks, the more Draco wanted to run in the other direction. But he couldn’t bail out with Potter watching. What was left of his pride wouldn’t allow it. Potter walked in first, followed by Draco and then Lindsey—who was probably making sure he didn’t run for the hills. He couldn’t breathe as he walked inside.
“It’s commonly used to help erectile dysfunction.” Malfoy stated with a frown, “I sell it in my shop—it’s perfectly legal. If you use too much it can cause irritation and paranoia, but in proper doses it helps get an erection.” Harry looked to his daughter who still looked asleep, thank Merlin.
“Did Hermoine stop by? Her shift started two hours ago.”
The pub was full of people who were just off work, so they fit in. Potter left him at a high top table to get drinks. Most people alone were looking at small muggle things in their hand, so Draco just looked around. Potter looked at ease around the muggles, coming back with Draco’s order and a beer for himself.
“P-please.” Draco shivered, not really realizing truly how cold he was until Potter said it. Harry grabbed his clothes from the ground, walking into the house. They stripped in the entryway and put all their clothes in the laundry, walking in their boxers upstairs. Draco turned the shower up as hot as he could before stripping. The window was starting to steam up and the numbness in his fingers and toes were slowly dissipating. The door swung open and Potter walked in.
“Hold it.” Draco demanded into the pillow.
They walked around the corner and Lindsey squeezed his arm, “It’s beautiful.” It had been awhile since he looked at Hogsmeade with new eyes, but he found Lindsey’s assessment accurate. It was a beautiful, cute little town.
“Grammy sent me to come get you.” He walked closer. Draco smiled a bit so Teddy gave him a hug, “My Daddy died too.”
“I’m going home.” He told Hermione.
“Can I set up an appointment?” Draco asked, his voice squeaking a bit so he stared down at the carpet. He shouldn’t have listened to Flitwick, this was a fucking
“Did you ever figure out who cursed her?” Sammy asked.
to be kind.”
Draco sighed, “So you take a few high profile cases a year to balance your budget for those that can’t—people do this all the time.”
“Never.” He swore.
“And I smell nice to you?” Harry asked, still not looking up at him.
“Very good Harry!” Lutz beamed, though her blonde hair was a little out of place. Potter nodded, sitting down in his chair. The class wasn’t really paying attention, because no one really did. Potter sat down so heavy in his chair it slid a bit, but he didn’t seem to notice. Draco kept his eyes on him. He kept rubbing his legs, but the movement didn’t disguise how bad he was shaking.
“I got laid last weekend.” Harry said with a waggle of his eyebrows.
“You rearranged everything—you only get four more times now!” Hermione said, walking around the kitchen.
“Sherry?” Sherry was in his office with John and Aiden, who was holding Estella.
“You never said that to Mum.” James said with a laugh.
“You still have most of your drink.” Weasel said.
“Sorry Potty.” Draco let go of his hand and sprinted for shell cottage.
“I’ll go call her.” Draco assured him, moving to stand up. He did so slowly, still trying not to scare Harry as he moved to the bed. Her floo information was written in chicken scratch handwriting. He was sort of nervous to leave Harry, but he did to go back out to the floo.
Potter grinned a bit triumphantly, “McGonagall s-s-said th-this sp-spring t-test made made me n-number one.”
“You’re a Malfoy—right?” A woman came up and asked. Draco tensed, there was only two ways this could go. They could know his father and love the family, or they could hate everything about them.
“You sure?” Draco looked concerned.
the fight.” He emphasized, and Draco noticed the not so subtle glare at one of his officers. Harry motioned for the man he was fighting to stand back up.
“Let me guess—he went off on you?” Hermione said, sitting down.
“I have been trying to think of something, then I remembered I bought these.”
“A weekend in Paris is what I needed.” Draco told him.
“Follow me.” Draco tugged his hand.
“That’s why I’m ang—umf!” Potter kissed him back. He kissed like he did everything else. It made Draco’s toes curl at the intensity. Draco took the chance to drag his fingers through Potter’s hair, he had wanted to so many times he wouldn’t let the opportunity pass by. Potter made a small sound of pleasure, moving closer to Draco. The movement made their lips break contact, “This is a terrible idea.”
“Best part of being a seventh year is the view. The steps below are all under the lake. They have murky views, and you can sometimes see a mermaid—but this is definitely the best. First year is the worst because you only ever see seaweed.”
Draco laughed, his shoulders relaxing, “One step at a time.” He took a sip of his water, “Your story helps Omegas too. Defeating the most powerful Alpha and wizard in the world? I think it proves Omegas are not weak.”
“What if I wake up and I’m like that again?”
“It’s a stag.” Draco and Harry said at the same time, Draco got pink.
“Yes—I like their muffins.” Potter had a smile, “do you accept my apology?”
Harry chuckled, “You’re right—but this shower is small so at least it will be warm.” It was a small shower, with just room to stand in. So Draco just rolled his eyes before getting in. The water was hot and perfect, he closed his eyes and ran his fingers through his hair. He heard Potter close the glass shower door and could feel his body heat.
“Good point. Gryffindor it is.” Draco let out a breath as they walked toward the Great Hall.
Draco sobbed into Harry’s shoulder as Harry hauled him close, “That’s different, you were having a nightmare.”
Zabini popped his head into the room, “I’m going to owl Madam Pumfrey for your medical records at Hogwarts, do you mind signing this so she has permission to share?”
“I thought you might.” Ron said with a sigh, “We love you though, you know—no matter what.”
“Want to order some Thai food?” Harry asked, kissing his jaw.
“It is difficult to pry her away from a book.” Draco agreed.
Harry smiled, briefly kissing Draco’s lips, “No. I wouldn’t change a moment. You?”
“Draco, look at me.” John ordered, moving him in a gurney.
“Well, that’s because I had a bath.” Draco laughed. Harry felt heat beneath his skin, watching Draco’s head tip back and revealing his collar bones.
“I have to go back to the office.” Harry said, shaking his head, “I might catch a couple of hours on my couch. Thank you for taking Lily.”
“I want to go see Harry.” Draco said.
“That was one of the disasters. Water damage isn’t easy to clean.” Harry turned pink, “But I figured it out.”
“And the Weasel is a knight?” Draco couldn’t help but sound exasperated.
“Draco!” Harry grabbed his arm.
“Yes please!” He said, running up to the counter.
“You two are close?”
Potter scoffed, “Absolutely not.”
“We adopted Jack two years ago.” Kali explained, “And Estella four years ago.”
“Not somewhere so posh I can’t walk in.”
“Merlin, you’re going to do something romantic aren’t you.”
“Merci.” Draco responded.
“Mr. Potter! Of—of course!” He stuttered. Potter laid down a few galleons and paid for everything. The three left in silence, the tension strong in Draco’s shoulders as he pushed through the door first.
“Uh—yeah.” Malfoy looked a bit awkward as he walked up to the island.
“A bit scary?”
Harry snorted, “And pretty.”
and my own fucking Quidditch pitch.” Draco turned back to the cupboard, “I can’t—I can’t imagine this.”
had. But he was drunk, Draco just rolled his eyes.
The tea was made to perfection, as per usual, and the snacks were exactly what Draco needed after a long day. Because they weren’t in the library, no one kicked them out at the end of the night either. In fact, bedtime came and went and not one of them moved. It was nearly midnight when Draco heard some rustling. Potter was standing up.
Malfoy shook his head, “My portkey arrives early Monday.”
Draco was so excited he thought he was going to split in two. He couldn’t wait to see Harry’s face. There had been a lot of disappointment over the past year, but it was
“Hm.” Potter groaned, “What?”
Harry didn’t know how he was going to survive an entire summer with all three children in his house, but he found himself adjusting to the loud noise before too long. Every day was just one day closer to when Lily would leave him—and he really wasn’t looking forward to that.
us?” Malfoy asked. Harry grabbed his arm without thinking too much. They popped out in muggle London, “I’m surprised you trusted me.”
that were true. And so Draco did some research and found a smart looking shoe that was
“Who are you rooting for today Harry?” Slughorn asked.
“No. I even like Astoria—nice girl. But—I’m making decisions for myself now. I’m sure I could be happy with her—but I want to choose someone for me.”
Madam Pumfrey went over his wounds. They were still healing, but he wouldn’t be confined to the infirmary. She gave strict instructions to be back every few hours for medication and if anything even so much as twinged, he needed to come back. It was a quiet walk back to the Slytherin dungeons, as everyone had gone to first period class.
. Who do you think you are? Fucking Saint Potter can just break all the rules. They don’t apply to him.”
“Yes.” Harry answered with a laugh, kissing his lips strongly, “We are.”
“I’m sure you did.” Winston let out a small sigh, “She isn’t the first patient you lost?”
“Polyjuice! Really! That’s your defense?” An auror scoffed, “If I had a knut every time I heard that excuse.” There was all around laughter.
“I make everything look good.” Draco said, rolling his eyes. Hermione and Sammy both laughed.
“You should have made more!” The Weasel yelled.
“And I think you both will have to talk about your past—but give yourself some time Draco. And give Harry time. Not too much time, of course. You don’t deserve to be treated poorly by Harry in a relationship. And ignoring an elephant in the room for too long can do more harm than good—but get to know each other more and face the elephant together.”
“I think you have a surprisingly steady head on your shoulders considering your reputation for blowing up in anger. I like how you recognized how important I was in Harry’s life from an early start. And despite the fact that our family names mean we are supposed to hate each other—I quite like you.”
“Draco?” Isaac called to him, “You seem out of it today.” He had been seeing Isaac for three weeks now. They had spoken mostly about how Draco wasn’t prejudice, but still had to work on it not being his first reaction. He realized it was wrong, so he tried to correct it constantly. He purposefully would stop, wait, and then respond. Draco liked Isaac’s easy demeanor. He wasn’t quick to judge, but he was to ask questions and poke holes in Draco’s logic. Isaac often reminded Draco to feel as well as use logic, that he couldn’t
“Did they play with you?”
“Don’t throw it on the floor!” Draco yelled before Potter did, “Do you have a hanger?”
“I’m leaving.” Draco said with a scowl. Potter had his book. How the hell was he supposed to finish his homework now? He usually came back in early when the library opened and finished his work, since Madam Pince couldn’t face him without a cup of coffee. He threw his bag over his shoulder and tried not to storm out of the library.
“Wait! I bought you a chocolate muffin.” Potter said right as Draco opened the door to his bedroom. Draco scrunched his nose. He really wanted to slam the door to be dramatic, but he really wanted the chocolate muffin. Draco turned around and narrowed his eyes.
Draco had no clue what Potter was going to talk to him about, but this would have never made the top ten list. He furrowed his brow, trying to think of all the possible reasons Potter could have for apologizing now, “And you’re coming to me three weeks later about this because?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow. Potter flushed angrily, gritting his teeth.
Harry watched Draco’s eyes flutter shut, and his own were quick to follow.
If Flitwick noticed how close they were, he didn’t say anything as he pulled up his own stool to help. All three of them together started bouncing off ideas, and soon Draco had ink all over his fingers as he furiously wrote down things to try. Trying different things was a tedious process, especially since it took precise detail.
charm just to be sure. Grimmauld was tricky with its multiple floors, someone could be on another floor and Draco wouldn’t know it until too late.
“We will.” Luna rocked on her toes as Draco nodded. He was excited for this section of the textbook.
“No—just us.” Potter said.
“Which ones?” Neville asked.
Draco
“Long day.” Draco answered, looking back down at the chart, trying to read it.
Draco flushed, “I-I don’t go to Hogsmeade.”
That idea had merit.
“You should.” She whispered into his ear, kissing his head three times. Draco wrapped his arms around her.
“New studies have shown to have your magic—Draco?” Harry had looked out past the group of trainees and saw Draco creeping in the back, “Is everything alright?”
“I—thank you.” Draco grasped the edges of the book, pulling it to his chest.
“I’m so sorry.” Potter said as soon as he was gone.
“Come on, we have to get a portkey.”
Draco snorted, “Same. I would have never taken Blaise up on his offer. I think Astoria would be a much better mate.” Harry turned from his desk to glare at him. Draco’s face was carefully blank for only a moment before it broke into a massive grin, “I could have laid back and thought of Slytherin every time.”
“Not really.”
Aiden laughed weakly, looking exhausted and not as healed as Draco wanted him to be. He would have to use potions to keep the wounds from infecting. Just as soon as he got to the room he could do that.
“Good afternoon Professor.” He was safe. Potter was still seething, but he stayed away. Draco sat down in his chair with a deep breath, slowing down his heart rate.
“Don’t.” Draco tried to pull his arm away.
Draco nodded, “It’s not what I want to do long term. I realize why it’s beneficial, but I want to specialize eventually.”
“Lena.” She answered.
“I’ve kept worse secrets.” Draco informed him, which made Harry laugh but it sounded more like a sob.
Harry furrowed his brow, “What—what am I looking at?” His voice sounded hopeful, but also like he didn’t want to jump to conclusions.
“I have a blue one you’d enjoy.” Draco said, looking up at him.
“Let’s do your trousers too, because for Merlin’s sake they don’t even look wrinkled now.”
.” His father whispered, holding the rope a bit tighter. His hands were visibly shaking as he looked over the edge, “I can’t—I won’t survive it again.”
Draco let out a huff of breath, “Ok.” He nodded, sliding out of bed and grabbing his jeans. He slipped them on and then grabbed his shirt. The iron charm helped, but it wasn’t as pristine as it should have been. He still pulled it on as well. Potter was still in his pants and undershirt.
“Me too.” Potter said, “But beyond hookups I like both.”
“Was it good?”
“No—maybe Friday though? I like playing with you.” Draco said.
“Hermione has been published.” Weasley said proudly, kissing her cheek. Hermione blushed.
“Do you go see Isaac?” Luna asked.
“Fuck.” Neville pinched the bridge of his nose.
“Yeah but—I always was in a bit of a helpless situation. My options came down to marry Astoria out of familial pressure and duty or bond with Potter and have to fuck him occasionally.”
“It’s my fault. When you were resting on my shoulder last night, I got tired. I kept my arm around you when I lied down; I thought it would be helpful. I didn’t think about you waking up and panicking.”
Draco nodded, “Blaise made me go when I got back to school. Leah was my mind healer at Hogwarts, McGonagall had her on staff to help anyone who wanted to go talk to him. I sort of told her half-truths about my family, glossed over how bad it was at home. But she knew my father had kicked me out, she didn’t know I was thrown out of the will. She helped me write the letter to apologize to my parents for how I acted, but not apologize for my choice. To ask to be brought back into the fold. I think she thought my parents were just playing the tough love act.”
“No one is as big as Neville.” Harry said.
“Shit.” Draco jumped away from the glass, casting a quick charm to repair it, “I don’t think I’ve done that since I was—well, back in school.” Draco hung the picture back up.
. That was Harry’s job. He was the hopeful one. Draco was supposed to be cynical and remind him to keep his feet planted on the ground.
“Please!” The patient cried out, and ice went through Draco’s veins—what the fuck was going on? Draco walked around the desk and jogged up to the group of healers and nurses that were just standing around. Three long slashes went across the patient’s torso.
Draco hoped he could look like Harry during sex. The way he exposed himself, how relaxed he looked. Draco worried he’d never be able to spread his legs out like Harry had. He wasn’t even sure if Harry wanted that, but he figured that he liked it so much that Harry was bound to like it too. Draco pushed another finger inside of Harry. Harry seemed to like slower strokes rather than short fast ones. Working him open slowly, Draco listened for every little moan and gasp.
“Out in the waiting room with your children—I’ll bring them back immediately.” Sherry promised.
It was quiet for a moment, “Guess Luna was right—we do have a lot more in common than we thought.”
“That did not affect anything other than his thigh.” Winston agreed, “He’ll be here a few days as we regrow his skin, but that’s it. He’s loopy now, but will be in pain when he wakes up tomorrow.”
“You’re Mum?” Mathews raised an eyebrow.
“I know—I have an appointment tomorrow.” Draco said with a huff, “But Harry—this is permanent.”
“One glass.” Draco said, his grey eyes sparkling a bit as they walked outside into Diagon Alley.
“Thank you Professor.” Draco whispered.
Malfoy pressed his lips together, blonde hair falling into his face as he looked down at his cup. He pushed it back with his fingers, “Shall we say next Wednesday?”
“A lot of work for a maybe—are those ripped pages?”
“I was wrong.” His mother said plainly, which Draco didn’t think he had ever heard before, “I have been seeing a therapist as well.” She grinned into her cup a bit mischievously.
“Angelina and I have fucking horrible sex.” George’s eyes got large, “Fuck.”
“You won’t fuck it up.” Harry said.
“I look like an inferi.” Harry stated.
“Blaise is already out in the waiting room, do you want me to send him back?” John asked.
“Professor—
“But despite all that—I really believe them leaving me was the best thing that ever happened to me.” Draco choked out.
woman and have that person leave you?” Harry felt like he had been punched in the gut, to use that against him was horrible. His anger rose as his entire body went cold. Harry told him that in confidence, trusting Draco not to use it against him. And here Malfoy was, rubbing Harry’s nose in it. The anger started at his chest and slowly burst through his fingertips, there was a sound of glass shattering.
“I don’t care.” Harry said with a small smile, he leaned in and pressed a kiss to Draco’s jaw. His lips enjoyed the stubble, and he breathed deeply. His cologne was perfect, but Draco’s own scent was even better, “Any other objections?”
“Magical consumption.” Malfoy answered, “Happens in pureblood families—too much inbreeding leads to unstable genetics.”
“That was it?” Potter scrunched up his nose, “Honestly I’m—you seem different than you did in school. And Hermione asked for me to give you a chance. I fought her but” Potter shrugged, “She won—she usually does.”
“I put extras in the fridge.” Draco grinned brightly, kissing his cheek. Harry had his arm wrapped around Draco’s chair, eating slowly with his left. Draco looked to the wine.
“I—I haven’t been in a courtroom since my trial. I hadn’t been to the ministry until the ME’s office.”
“You?”
“Yes. Color coded.” Draco answered.
“Yeah—he and Malfoy fixed me up.”
“Hold still Mr. Potter.” Winston ordered, waving his wand for monitoring spells.
“Want to fuck my thighs?” Harry asked. Draco couldn’t think, “Finally rendered you speechless?”
“Our working theory is because of the business-like arrangement of the mating—they sit across from each other like they are still negotiating.” Blaise added.
Potter snorted, “That is true.” He ran his fingers through his mop of a head, “Well, after a conversation like that I could use a drink—want to join me?”
When the clock chimed one in the morning, Isaac yawned.
“That is ridiculous.” Draco said.
“This is my colleague, Maia.” Blaise introduced.
“How on earth is it different?” Draco asked with a scowl.
“And you’re recovering.” Isaac pushed the floating tray toward him, “I expect you to eat all of it.”
“You’ll have to teach some of our aurors how to do that—it was nearly impossible to break.” Robards joked, Draco was disinclined to tell them he learned from his insane aunt, “But it seems the second faction of people coming through the door were sent to take Rudger out.”
“Yeah.” Draco whispered, “Now shush! Be a good pillow.” He got comfortable on Harry’s thigh. Draco fell back asleep nearly instantly. He was still exhausted.
“What you told me before?”
“You’ll definitely scar on the back of your thigh and your calf. Whatever hit you must have gotten you from behind. You’re lucky your arse wasn’t blown off.”
“I was there after.” Draco frowned. He didn’t have the words to explain the gore, but he didn’t have to. Potter grabbed his free hand and kissed his knuckles, holding his hand.
Draco looked down at the sleeping boy. This is so perfect. A little to perfect. But he didn't care if it was a fluke. He is going to take an advantage. He was going to show Harry how much he meant to him. But how??
In half disappointment he didn't use my nickname but I understand why he didn't. I  close the door and sit on my bed of the two in the room. I lay back and close my eyes listening to Harry breathe when suddenly I could feel him laying next to me.
He walks over to me and kisses me deeply. The kiss was full of passion and love. His hair dropped down on to our lips making the kiss wetter than before. His hands let go of the towel and it falls as his hands go through my hair. I pull away catching my breath taking him in. I look into his eyes, they twinkle.
She speaks not too long after her voice is soft as silk and smooth like velvet.
She’s really quite expressive. This is the third unique face she’s shown him in minutes. It’s surprise again, sure, but it feels like a different brand. Less calculated, more caught off guard.
A minor uproar emerges from the crowd as people start to complain about Houses being too split up. Madam Hooch raises her hands, her expression pointed.
“Harry,” she says, taking a step back, “is there something I need to know?”
When silence follows, Draco realizes that the entire group has stopped to listen in on the conversation.
Again, he finds himself struggling to knock on the door, afraid of feeling like an idiot for being there in the first place. But he remembers the way the door had swung outward and caught him off guard the last time, so he finally forces his knuckles against wood, holding his breath. A second passes and he exhales, shaking his head. Stupid idea. No sounds of movement from inside.
“Hello, Draco.”
” Harry hisses in Draco’s ear, his face pale.
of things—to apologize for, the sooner I can stop avoiding you for being utterly daft and ignorant.”
There’s a scraping noise and Narcissa gasps. “I can’t believe I’ve spilled that,” she mutters.
Draco looks to Harry, who flinches, then turns over.
see something?”
“Sometimes you’re smarmy when you don’t know it. Even accidentally.”
“So your question is…”
“Oh, yeah. I think he’s a little scared about life after Hogwarts, so he’s really giving his all this year. For Quidditch, at least,” Harry says back to Leon, trying to make eye contact while he speaks (like a normal person) but failing. The sound of Ron and Ginny arguing about new Quidditch logistics seems distant as Leon puts down his basically untouched piece of toast. Harry can’t help but feel worried that he’s eaten so little, but decides to keep his mouth shut.
Harry sighs through his nose. “Technically, yes. But you were the one who realized something was amiss, and I was too blinded by a juvenile crush to see it.”
There’s a crystalline moment, a split second of absolutely clarity, when Draco accepts that this is exactly how he will die. Before meeting any of his goals, before righting any of his myriad wrongs. Silent, alone, in the dark.
He smiles, flashes his teeth. “Splendid. Luna, will you help gather the troops?”
If it weren’t for Leon, Harry would say yes. “Draco, I’m so sorry.”
Harry steps forward and lays a hand on McGonagall’s shoulder. “What’s going on?” he asks, his voice heavy in his own mouth.
“I must say…even though what you did is dastardly, it also took a lot of powerful magic on your part. I would be lying if I said I wasn’t impressed.”
“So, what now?” Harry asks, suddenly full of energy and ready for another surprise.
my basic understanding is that I more or less stole your magical core.”
. About us.”
“Well, I don’t trust you, and I think it’s stupid for him to trust you.”
the right thing to say. Pansy somehow goes even redder as she grinds her teeth, and Draco can tell she’s contemplating risking expulsion as her fingers curl around her wand in her robes.
Blaise is sitting up in his bed, head in a book. He peers around it, gives a sort of hum to acknowledge Draco’s presence, then goes back to his reading. Fine by Draco; he’s done just about as much conversing as he can for the day. It’s still early, probably too early to think about sleeping, but a full stomach and relatively clear mind seem to be calling his head to his pillow. He at least changes into clothes that are more comfortable—a pair of grey joggers and a simple green shirt.
Draco’s eyes sting. The aroma of smoke hangs heady in the air, the room warm and cozy. “Do you really think I’ll make it out of this?”
The door swings open and a distressed Minerva McGonagall sweeps into the room, waving her hand to shut the door behind her.
“Where’ve you gone?” Harry murmurs and strokes a thumb across Draco’s cheek.
“Biscuit, Harry?”
“Go to hell.”
Draco hums and sticks the knuckle of his pointer finger between his teeth. “Good point,” he mumbles around his finger. “What are the odds the castle is completely vacant? I imagine that Filch and that bloody cat of his might still be around.”
It isn’t Leon’s.
Draco has to remind himself that doing this was his own idea and Harry is just trying to help. “Yes, something has gone wrong. I’m clearly not meant to ever cast a Patronus.” His hair is still up in something of a bun; he hasn’t been able to replicate the style like Hermione had, but it keeps the locks out of his face. Now, the tie is hurting his scalp, so he drags it out of silky hair and places it on the nearest desk.
of his naked body is enough to set him off. “What if I told you that, underneath my clothes, I’m naked
The words sting, especially from her, but he knows she doesn’t mean them. There’s already a soft regret growing behind her eyes, but he brushes it aside.
causes neighboring tables to look round.
When all is said and done, Draco feels content. His most recent session with Mari had been illuminating,
“Right. Let’s go.”
Harry sighs. “Hermione, I’m not looking for a solution.”
. You should be groveling at his fucking feet and thanking him for saving your life. You’re a complete imbecile if you still think we would’ve been safe had our side won that battle. That...that
She drops her wooden spoon and points her wand at the breakfast, which freezes. The sizzling of sausage is cut off, silence ringing.
“Did you do
“Because he’s technically been dead.”
“THERE IS NO SITUATION,” Harry roars. Draco takes a step back, still quietly crying. Harry immediately regrets raising his voice; Draco can tell by the way his shoulders slump and his eyes soften and he takes a tentative step forward.
“Why not go down there and see if you take care of it yourself?”
“How do you feel?” he asks, not rising to Draco’s sarcasm.
“Hello, Draco,” she says. She returns to her book. “Did you need something?” Her tone is guarded. Angry, even. He supposes he can’t blame her.
“You’ve already been excused. I took care of it while you were…Where did you say you were?”
, but the door wouldn’t open for us!” Hermione cries, following him out the gate. “There are some seriously powerful enchantments around this house, Harry, some I couldn’t even begin to figure out.”
. Because I have so many things that I want to say, but I don’t want to overwhelm you. I know how new this is and like you said in one of your letters, running into it headfirst might just hurt both of us.”
is still missing, but obviously, Draco had Disapparated away.
“No, I’m not,” she admits, sitting back in her seat.
Harry almost stumbles. His stance is wide, a finger pointing at Draco. “You’re lying. Why would you even say that?”
“If you tickle me, I will hex you into last week,” Leon says, and it breaks the tension significantly.
“Hey, it’s not a problem or anything! Would you mind just waiting out in the hallway until everybody’s finished?”
He looks at her in the eye and realizes that he doesn’t even have to tell her the truth. Somehow, she already knows, it’s clear in the sympathy, in the softness that it so rare from McGonagall.
The world stops around them. Harry has solved some great mystery inside himself and the answer is Leon’s lips and his breath and the tears that steal the honey color of his irises and graze his cheeks the same way Harry’s fingers do.
Harry’s cheeks redden; Draco takes a step closer and wraps his arms around his shoulders.
Ron nods. “Where is he, anyway?”
“What if it goes south?”
“I can’t hide away in the Hospital Wing forever,” he says. He’d considered it. The castle that had once felt more or less like a safe space now makes him anxious. He doesn’t know what’s happening, but the frequency of these incidents makes him worry that something is very wrong with Hogwarts.
,” the band is singing. In his mind Luna transforms in Harry’s arms, morphs into Leon, his compact body pressed against Harry’s chest, his head on Harry’s shoulder, swaying to the beat, their heartbeats syncing. And when Leon looks up, and his eyes are a piercing gray, like sunlight on the edge of a storm cloud, and his face is carved, pointed, and he grows taller until Harry is looking up at Draco, smiling at him like Harry’s never seen before. And yet he can picture it so clearly.
“What about…”
And with that, she whisks herself away. Draco sympathizes; she must be completely burnt out.
His chest tightens instantly and he slashes his wand through the air, dissipating the snake before he can get a good look at it. Fuck. Fuck fuck
“I can make anything work,” he says.
him? It feels wrong.
“I’m sorry.” He nearly chokes on the words. “I wish I could tell you, I really do, and maybe I should, but—”
“Do you even
Leon is still. For a moment, and another, he doesn’t speak. Then, he sighs. “I don’t want to push you, like I said,” though it sounds like he’s pushing to Harry. “It just makes me sad to think that you could be missing out on something so important.”
Luna’s joined the group in the meantime and, oddly enough, her and Ron have paired off while Hermione dances with her arms around Leon’s neck.
Draco’s chest swells; Harry’s hair is soft in his hands, his lips are plush against Draco’s. His clothes smell freshly laundered and his skin feels freshly washed, and for a moment Draco forgets where they are, why they’re here, what they’re about to attempt. He just gives into the intrusion of joy, a burning, expanding joy, a kind of joy he hasn’t felt since he was small, since before he knew what it was to be hurt, to cause hurt.
“Because you’re Harry Potter? No. I’ve seen your flying improve year after year, boy. The whole savior business has nothing to do with it. But while we’re on the topic, good stuff, there.”
smart, Draco. Smart enough to know when you’re blatantly lying to me.”
Draco finally forces his feet to move and he presses his fingertips to his temples, rubbing gently. Where had it
“Sounds dreadful.”
“Just let me know at any time if you change your mind,” she says and sinks down into her own chair. “So, Draco, what brings you here today?”
“Right.”
. Some people they took and...we still don’t know where they are.”
He shrugs. “Like I said, I think I’ve just gone off. It was only a matter of time. That’s what Hermione keeps saying, anyway.”
“He’s got three minutes,” says Ginny, who has materialized next to Harry and is looking up with her hand shielding her eyes. “Then we boot him.”
About halfway in, Draco realizes he still needs to change into his robes, so he gathers what he needs and leaves the compartment quietly. He’s only just exited when someone barrels into him, nearly knocking him over and sending the items in his hands flying.
“According to Ron, you are. Can we just get started already? George and I have been dying to kick your asses since last time.”
And then he’s gone, his adorably compact body bouncing out of the classroom. Harry sits and tries to catch his breath, a near impossible task considering Leon had taken most of it with him when he left.
“Oh. Hello, Harry,” Draco says when he turns around.
Harry grins, his lips still hovering just above Leon’s. “
thoughts. So easy. Draco lifts his wand and hopes Harry doesn’t notice that he’s trembling. He wracks his brain, filing through the relatively small stack of happy memories he has to choose from. It makes him nauseous that he has so much reorganization to do; so many of his fond recollections from Hogwarts involve fun at the expense of others. Friendship based on mutual hatred and nothing more. Pain for the sake of reinforcing power dynamics.
“Well, yes, there’s that…” Harry says. He looks like he’s about to say something else, but the words don’t come.
(See the end of the chapter for
, he thinks, over and over,
Whatever crack had formed in the wall between them feels like it’s giving way, all of the things that were unsaid flowing through with abandon. Draco’s pulse hammers in his throat, in his wrists, and his fingers tremble. Is he forgiven? Has Harry realized the truth of who Leon is, what he’s doing?
“Hey, how did you get that?”
. Dammit. If there’s any hope for
“Yeah, it is.”
“Is manual labor important for casting a Patronus?”
Leon shakes his head. “Nothing important.” Harry isn’t sure he believes him. “I think I’m going to go make sure all of my books and things are in order. I’ll see you later, all right?” Leon refuses to meet Harry’s eye as he stands, not waiting for a response before leaving the Hall.
“Normal isn’t really in your wheelhouse, is it?”
Draco grimaces. “I was afraid you were going to say that.”
keep Disapparating from the Burrow and then not showing up anywhere they can detect?”
His heart has been ripped from his chest, it, too, severed into two halves, and thrown to the floor.
“Right side of the room will be casting first, and then the left. Don’t try to do any kind of defending when it’s not your turn, either. The whole point of this exercise is to give everybody a fair shot at it. So, right side, on my mark…” He watches with pleasure as everybody readies themselves, anticipating his go ahead.
“Hermione,” he replies jovially as she pulls away.
McGonagall is there, and Harry Potter brings up the rear and closes the door behind them. The three of them are shouting suggestions at each other, panicked.
“It’s all right,” Draco says.
Harry smiles, giving Leon’s shoulder an awkward but hopefully affirming pat before removing his hand.
He thinks back to the ethereal belief he’d woken to, how it had felt external and yet so pervasive. Not ready to admit anything, Harry raises another question. “What does this mean here at the end?”
A pause. Then, “…Me, too.”
“Harry, people have been telling you your entire career at Hogwarts that that spell is too basic, but you used it to defeat the Dark Lord
At that moment, Malfoy walks in. His eyes are down, so he doesn’t realize that Harry notices his presence. He picks a seat at the very back of the room; anticipating him looking up, Harry directs his attention back to the second row where Hermione and Leon are having what seems to be a very friendly conversation. At one point, Leon leans in close to say something, and she laughs and nods, glancing briefly at Harry. He can feel himself turning red, so he clears his throat and looks at the clock on the wall.
“Here are the clothes you arrived in,” she says and points to a basket. “Minerva had them laundered. Gone soft, she has.”
Now, hold this letter up to your face. Are you doing it? I’m serious, pick it up. Now, imagine me flicking you between the eyes. You are anything but self-centered! I mean, our situation was complicated, and you were going through some significant self discoveries, so I’m sympathetic. It’s not a pass, but I understand. I was there once, too. And besides, I suppose I’m not completely innocent in everything either. Regardless, aside from that incident, you’ve only shown me that you’re selfless and caring. Talking about yourself does
“Er, I’m a bit curious,” Harry says as they start to walk again. “Why exactly are you here? Not that we're not thrilled to have you here! We’ve just been left a bit in the dark about the
“Harry, this is fantastic news!” Mrs. Weasley suddenly exclaims, a little incredulously. “Why don’t you seem more excited?”
“Oh, fuck,” comes Harry Potter’s voice through the darkness.
asked.” Draco feels like he might actually perish when Harry smiles, a slightly crooked but pure smile that shows a flash of white teeth.
Draco nods. He remembers the odd sense of righteousness that had taken him over, had caused him to take Harry’s side over hers. It was the right thing to do. He’s even more sure of that now. He prepares himself to hear some bollocks excuse from her in an attempt to win him back.
“Oh. Well. There’s a sort of…situation,” Draco says. “They’re still investigating exactly what’s going on, but apparently some kind of ancient magic was set loose during the battle, and now it’s wreaking havoc. Something doesn’t want us to be here.”
“First of all, if it turns out that you
“He’s innocent,” he says, wishing his assertion of this fact would placate her skepticism, knowing that it won’t.
. If you just act normally and allow things to develop the way they will, it might give you a better idea about what’s happening on his end. The other choice is…You could talk to him about it.”
“Who gave this to you?”
, I mean.”
“Well, I’m not going to be our
In an attempt to get his mind on anything else, Draco watches as students gradually file out of the castle, basking in the warmth of the afternoon.
Harry says nothing, merely turns to walk away from Draco for good.
Hermione stops what she’s doing for a moment. “It’s a haircut. Nothing strange here at all.”
“I just checked. There was one, but I sent him back up to Ravenclaw Tower. A first year, basically afraid of his own shadow.”
“What is it?” Madam Pomfrey calls as Harry brings it to her.
“Well, you know…that night? When you found me?”
want to be furious with you. Part of me wants to hold onto that grudge forever, because I liked you so much, and I still do, and you shutting me out felt like being thrown into the middle of the sea.”
at the Burrow, even temporarily, is an insane thought. But Harry had seemed so hopeful, a child asking their parents if a friend can stay over. If it means spending more time with him, really giving it a shot…He supposes it will take some explaining to his mother, but with everything that’s changed, he can’t imagine she’ll be so opposed as to not let him go. Besides, he’s right on the verge of adulthood. Could she really stop him?
“That’s…interesting news. But surely the Wizengamot will take that information into account in all of this. Harry Potter is rather good company these days, is he not?”
Pansy scoffs again, louder this time. “Do you have
“Right, I followed the ball of light you sent out.”
Draco sighs, then pulls a chair out anyway. “I’m not exactly here of my own volition.”
His optimism is admirable. Draco is only further stressed. He’s only going to let Harry down.
She blinks at him. “No, I’m your therapist.”
“I don’t really want to talk about the rest,” he says. There. That’s close enough to the truth. She knows that more occurred, but she doesn’t have to know
“Yeah, fine. I’m just nervous is all,” Harry says as Hermione slips her arm through Leon’s and whisks him somewhere else in the common room. Leon gives Harry a fond smile over his shoulder as he goes.
“Right. Of course. I’ll be there.”
“Good. Looking forward to a very interesting season,” she says, giving him a little push toward the small group of Seekers.
don’t need to know that it’s a personal choice. Nobody else has access to the requirements from the Ministry, so it would just be us.”
“Well, for one, I’ve only been to this house a handful of times since I actively lived here as a literal infant, so I’m not sure they’ll even consider this a viable hiding place. But even if they do somehow make that logical leap…” he pauses and licks his lips. “There are some really insane wards and charms around this house. One of them has made it so that the only people who can enter are those in the Potter bloodline.”
“Do you remember that vanishing cabinet that was used to…you know…”
either. It’s just one friend asking another friend a favor. The way I see it, if Leon and I show up with the two of you, there’s enough familiarity for people to not really question things. Luna and I are Head Boy and Girl, and Ron and Hermione obviously have each other. Because Leon and Luna have also been working together, it makes sense that he could hypothetically also have met
I really hope this is a satisfying enough ending to the first 2/3s of the story ;-; I've really been putting off writing it because I was scared of not doing it justice!! It probably could have come together a bit better but oh well, it's still more or less the effect I was aiming for. The next 11 chapters will be very Drarry focused and will hopefully pull together some other major plot points that haven't been resolved (stuff from back in the first couple of chapters, even!) Let me know what y'all think!! <3
“That’s perhaps the most immediate issue. There’s no way to know, unless he contacts somebody.”
“Oh,” he breathes. The tension in his body releases some.
“But it’s our first practice.”
“No, listen to me!” She must have lost her bearings completely if her voice is raised in the library. “Promise me you won’t do anything like this again. No more blood magic, no more dungeons. No more being the Chosen One. Just—please. Promise.” The last word comes out a sob.
“I don’t need an answer right away. If you want to—”
Luna clears her throat. “While he’s usually very humble about it, I don’t think we can deny that Harry is incredibly selfless, and has been toward the two of us personally on many occasions. It doesn’t feel like such a big ask to me.”
Ginny’s teeth press down on her bottom lip and she sits back, sinking into the couch, probably hoping she can just sink away from the conversation.
“No,” Harry says and starts to pace, scrubbing a heel down his face. “I’ll vouch for him. If this stupid Savior thing is ever going to get me anything, it should be this.”
through the haze in his head, Harry continues to pull students out of the disaster, one by one. The pit has almost covered the entirety of the hall, only the staff’s table still intact at the far end of the room. Harry’s stomach drops out when he sees someone lying just behind the table, unconscious, red hair spilled like a corona of ginger wine around her head.
“There’s one person who
“You’re saying you think somebody went down into the dungeons anyway?” Harry asks. He scoots to the edge of his seat, his eyebrows knit together.
But among all of the usual Draco hate, he hears another topic that makes him perk up.
Both Potter’s and Granger’s eyebrows shoot upward, and Weasley makes a noise between gagging and coughing.
As he enters, Harry looks in the way of the Slytherin table and happens to lock eyes with Draco. He surrenders a tiny smile, something weary and soft in his expression. Draco is almost too stunned to respond, as a strange feeling of dread and regret has nearly knocked him backward. He manages to turn the corners of his mouth upward and takes a deep breath, returning to his food to get his mind back in the right place.
He shakes his head, a pit forming in his stomach. “They have a right to hate me. I’ve done some things that…” he says, unable to finish, angry that his eyes are stinging wet. “But I don’t want them to.” He swears internally, feeling childish.
Waking up with Harry in his arms is like stepping between dreams.
Harry wipes away another tear. “I don’t deserve you. Nobody does.”
It wasn’t happiness. Like Harry had told him, all of the lessons that taught Patronuses were summoned through joy were pointless. Draco hadn’t thought of a moment, he’d thought of a
Draco stares at the notice and an oddly nostalgic feeling of contempt traverses his spine. He gives an involuntary shiver and remembers that he’s inserted himself into the middle of a mildly rabid crowd, so he turns on his heel and pushes his way into the Great Hall, head down.
Draco makes to turn again, but this time his feet refuse to leave the ground beneath him. He huffs, thinking he’s lost his mind. He yanks his right leg upward with no success, and when he sets the light against his feet again, he’s shocked to find that the very floor of the castle has grown over his feet.
“Can you just get it together?” she says, her voice a bit tight. “Everybody else is arriving.”
She waves a hand at him. “You know me, I’ll be on to somebody else soon enough.”
All the while, Rowan is shouting at him, not just internally but with his physical voice, telling him that Draco is just the beginning, that every non-pureblood will fall by Harry’s hand, that Harry himself will tear down the Ministry brick by enchanted brick.
Hermione’s hand is the first in the air, though it hadn’t shot up with her usual vigor. Harry figures this is what saves her from the typical collective eye roll. His throat tightens as he sees another hand cautiously raise in the back of the room. Leon looks rather proud of himself despite seeming reluctant to admit it.
Fighting the urge to pout, Harry nods and gently taps Leon’s hat. “Very cute.”
He shrugs. “We didn’t get there until things had escalated in both cases, so we didn’t get much backstory. It was less about words being exchanged than jinxes, but I think at least the first one was about Quidditch. During the second one a window broke and someone stunned someone else’s owl accidentally...” He trails off, giving Draco a strange look. It’s as if Potter’s suddenly realizing exactly who it is he’s babbling to. “Well, er, I better be off, then.” He say this almost like a question.
“Which after this incident should be on a steep incline,” Harry interrupts.
SO. Hello everyone! It's been a couple months since I worked on this. I was finishing up my senior thesis for undergrad (which I successfully defended about a week ago!!) and have been trying to adjust to/cope with my last semester being completely uprooted and moved to online. It's definitely been strange, and for a while I wasn't feeling much motivation to write, which is totally ok and something that was unfortunate but navigable. Most importantly, I'm back in the swing of things with this particular story! It had been so long that I felt a little bit out of the loop with my own fic so I had to go back and reread everything to remember where I was going with it, lol.
She shakes her head. “Nobody else has come forward with any interest. We think that the community sees the subject as a bit irrelevant now that Voldemort is gone, but neither of us should be naive enough to believe that there aren’t any other dark wizards out there. As much as I would love things to be peaceful for a time, I would much rather prepare my students for every possibility.”
gone—”
your reasons—they do nothing for either of us now. But I think we should just put it all behind us and start over.”
“Please be nice to each other,” Molly calls distractedly from the stove.
“Listen, Ron,” Harry starts, also avoiding eye contact. “I know that a while back that’s what we talked about but...I’m not so sure about the whole Auror thing anymore.”
