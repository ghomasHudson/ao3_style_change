“What?!” Draco was stunned. “I will
Harry suddenly realised the reason for his pensiveness in the car.
Namely, Potter.
Zabini looked murderous, but he stayed where he was, throwing a glance at Potter. It infuriated Draco, whatever this secret thing was between them, and he swallowed hard, chewing on solid, writhing jealousy.
It took him a minute for his vision to focus, and as it did, freckles, red hair and a long, pale nose swam into view alarmingly close to his own face. Harry slid back with a yell, away from Ron’s startled countenance.
He was completely taken by surprise, so much so that he actually rocked back on his heels a fraction, jaw locking up in disbelief. He could feel his eyes lock onto the thin white loops of cloth wrapped around Potter’s wrists and his breaths were suddenly ragged.
The second- year in Draco wanted to hide in a cranny behind a suit of armour and jump out at the other boy.
Potter lifted a shoulder, as if to say ‘sure’, advancing slightly in the study to where two cushy armchairs were sitting before a fire. On the second level was the enormous Headmistress’ desk, which was currently vacant.
Draco grinned. “Yes, Professor.”
Not you?
“Too right,” Draco sniffed. “Just you take note of that. You don’t want to cross me.”
Was he?
“Clear vial, thick pink- tinged liquid within, lid red to signify mild toxicity,” Draco reeled off slowly, gaze pinned on the ginger boy squirming in front of him.
Ron grinned. “How’s that oatmeal going down, Gin?”
And- his eyes skimmed the lines, he processed-
Blaise exploded. “HOLY SHIT, PANS, YOU’RE A COINCIDENTAL STALKER!”
Draco racked his brain, searching for the sound of his hoarse voice, and, oh.
Potter squinted at him, jaw clenching almost imperceptibly. “That’s really the best you can do?”
“It can’t be good for the baby, can it, not eating? You should have some of mine,” he said nobly. “Here.” And he pushed his bowl away from him, still brimming with lumpy viscousness.
Draco nodded, impatient. “So you met up…?” he asked, desperately attempting to disguise the hungry tone of his voice.
Malfoy stared at him, lips parted, and Harry had to ask him.
“So…” Harry began tentatively. “That would be a yes.”
Harry’s best mate paused for a moment, and then shrugged. “Not that I know what that last bit means, particularly, but you know ‘Mione.”
Blaise snorted indistinctly.
Harry dipped his tongue out so it flickered over the head of Malfoy’s cock, slipping into the slit and licking lightly over the pre-come that had collected there.
Potter.
His bladder twinged, and Harry’s nails bit further into the skin of his palms, which was used to it by now. He took a deep breath, releasing the clenching of his fists with some effort, and looked up, assuming a thin veneer of confidence and likeability.
“They were,” Pansy furrowed her brow, looking as though she were searching for the right way to explain it. Suddenly, she shook her head angrily, speaking as though she were just voicing her stream of consciousness. “Salazar, maybe it’s fucking stupid for me to be so sentimental about this. It’s just, when we were younger, you know, I’d look at both of your parents, and Crabbe’s parents, and Goyle’s parent’s, and even bloody Nott’s parents, and I’d think…
Smooth, golden skin, planes of it, like so much unmarred silk. Potter’s shirt was buttoned almost obscenely low, toeing the line between inappropriate and just really goddamn hot, and  aforementioned skin was just… everywhere, dipping and pooling in shadows and there was the tiniest freckle that Draco really should not be able to see, Jesus…but Christ was he happy that he could. And now he was wondering if anyone else had seen that freckle. A red mist seeped in at the corners of his mind, making him grit his teeth. That freckle belonged to him. And so did the hollow of Potter’s throat, and the curls that just grazed his shirt collar, and the rest of his luscious skin, slipping out of reach under that accursed joke of a shirt. Part of Draco wanted to grab it and tear it off, maybe give it a shake for daring to obstruct his delicious view. But part of him was ferociously, terrifyingly glad that it was there, however half- heartedly, for that meant that nobody else-
The woman turned to Draco, face downturned as she scribbled Pansy’s order onto the pad of creamy paper she was holding.
That was really what it boiled down to, wasn’t it?
The woman looked up, eyes bright and birdlike. “I believe the bar stocks Hayman’s, Bombay Sapphire, Plymouth, Tanqueray Dry, Hendricks—”
He sighed. “Yes, Mrs Finchman.”
Draco backed out of the broom cupboard, smiling thinly at Potter’s feral expression as he hurled himself towards Draco again and again, held back only by Finnigan, who was remarkably broader than he had been before the summer.
Draco stepped closer.
Malfoy shuddered visibly, head tipping further back and the muscles in his arms straining as his hands cushioned the back of his head. He looked… desperate for it.
underfoot as layers of sugary alcohol clung to the leathery heels.  Harry grimaced, needing the toilet more desperately than ever. A chilly stream of air conditioning slipped under the gaping collar of his shirt, and goosebumps prickled to life on the skin of his chest, a smattering of tiny bumps spreading steadily downwards until his stomach was tingling and cold. Harry increased his pace, striding down the dimly lit passageway until he came to a fork in the corridor. He peered to the right; a faint silver ‘Wizards’ sign glinted on a dark- painted door.
doing this entirely for the sake of inter- house unity?” Potter asked, completely straight faced.
“Harry! I mean Harry, fuck, please.”
“Muggle thing,” Harry said frustratedly. “Hermione! Concentrate, Christ!”
With a bang that made Draco start, a newspaper, sepia pictures flashing and moving, was slammed down onto his desk by a brown hand. Theo grimaced.
“Right, well, since we have an even number, I think groups of three…” Flitwick tapped his quill absently against his chin, leaving a tiny smudge of ink on the cleft.
he thought.
he assumed it would say haughtily.
“Yeah, alright,” he said, gathering himself. “So, maybe mention something about inter- house unity, you know, to get her on board, and—”
It was Potter. Undoubtedly, unquestionably Potter.
the stupid bird, it doesn’t open.”
peasants.” Pansy sat forward, the neckline of her dark red dress glimmering silkily in the warm light. “And I’m… what? Your beautiful benefactor?”
It was relief.
Date.
He’d hoped Hermione would drop the whole oatmeal thing, but she was clearly convinced that they were both such fans of it they never wanted to eat anything different for breakfast ever again.
“Fuck, these clothes are uncomfortable.”
. Because my parents were in love! They were in love, and everyone could see it. Maybe if they’d been like everyone else from the start I would have been okay when they split a few months back.”
The leaden weight dulling his heart grew still heavier, and the slow syrup of self- hatred started to ooze through him.
Pansy pouted, cocking her hip playfully in her seat. “Shame we’re among other people, then. It’s been a while since I’ve mashed someone in a duel.”
“That was…” he bit his lip. “The best head anyone's ever given me. Seriously.”
Ginny shifted, looking uncomfortable. “You—we, sort of know her? From, like. School.”
“I know how much you… how you care about him,” Zabini said carefully. “But he told me this in confidence, and even if he wouldn’t mind you knowing I can’t risk that. It’s… personal.”
“Excuse me?” He beckoned a young waiter, steadfastly ignoring the rabbiting of his heart.
“That’ll teach you and Hermione to make bets about where I keep my lube.”
His hands were sure on the waistband of Malfoy’s boxers, dragging them down until they pooled around Malfoy’s ankles, his cock springing free to hang heavily between his legs, stiff and flushed.
He looked between the other two boys, completely failing at nonchalance when he drawled, “So… you two been getting cosy over the summer? Don’t want to upset your boyfriend, Zabini?”
The cab screeched as it paused at a traffic light, and Malfoy turned to look at him. Harry caught his breath at the sight. They stared at each other wildly, hands still on each other’s legs, and Malfoy’s brow furrowed lightly, as though he were in pain, as his gaze travelled over Harry’s lips, his jaw, his hair, and then over his shirt and legs that were pressed together in the seat.
Pansy sniggered. “Why would he be? Blaise here has always been a sucker for a pretty face.” She flicked her hair and preened, fluttering her-- Draco had to admit, fairly lush-- eyelashes.
Weasley’s jaw worked, and he picked his textbook up defiantly, eyes skimming the page to find the instructions he’d misread. Draco knew which bit it was, too, but stood silently as the other boy fumed and tried to re- find the passage. He watched wearily as Weasley’s eyes finally widened in humiliation, and then looked up at Draco, narrowing in embarrassed anger.
Draco had half been expecting it to be in slow- motion, like one of those old Muggle films, but it wasn’t, and it was far too quick for him to adjust, and all of a sudden he was staring at the twenty- year old face of his schoolboy crush.
. Honestly.” She massaged his arm gently. “The Muggles won’t come downstairs, Draco. Promise.”
Ron’s very freckles seemed suddenly to radiate concerned tenderness. He went over to Hermione and stood behind her, looping his lanky arms around her so his long- fingered hands were splayed gently over her belly. Hermione melted, and Ron nosed lovingly at the pale, exposed column of her neck, curls pulled back messily in a soft bun.
The sheer- shirted guy had flicked his hair about eight times by the time Pansy was midway through ordering their meals, and Blaise’s tall bottle of Ogden’s was running extremely low.
McGonagall watched them mount the gargoyle’s staircase, and as she nodded from behind her desk, the stone rumbled and began to turn slowly again, rotating until it deposited them on the corridor below where they had begun, and McGonagall had vanished from sight.
Potter was gay.
By the way, I'm working on a oneshot at the moment so the next update might take quite a bit longer than usual
‘Go home.’
“To be fair,” Hermione said reasonably, settling herself in the large armchair in the corner of Harry’s room, “The Burrow didn’t even have ensuites before Ron added them. So it’s not as if you would have had it if we hadn’t renovated a bit.”
he thought hysterically,
“You can’t seriously be denying how… we were that year,” Potter said, gesturing between them. Draco panicked, as he always did when it came to a case of gay accusation.
wet dream, one that he’d struggled in vain to stop having since the age of sixteen-
go first, and really I should have gone last.”
He was being ridiculous.
“Draco, sit up! You can’t sleep in Transfiguration.
From behind their napkins and hands, under the pretence of smoothing back hair or checking lapels, sipping water, dropping cutlery or dabbing at their mouths with the linen cloths, they found countless ways to watch the couple, who were undoubtedly on a date.
Hermione nodded encouragingly. Ron took a deep breath.
Malfoy inhaled sharply, the muscles of his lower stomach defining themselves suddenly.
“I know.” Potter's voice was heavy, and coloured with something that Draco wanted to curl into.
He didn’t look the slightest bit affected by Harry all of a sudden, and there Harry was, sweating and blushing and yearning, practically canting his hips up he was so desperate for it.
“What’s that look?” Draco asked, too sharp to be fooled.
Draco looked taken aback, “I know I’m not.” He was quiet for a moment, then started again tentatively, “I know all this is a lot, Potter. I know it is. That’s why I’m trying to help. It’s so much more er. Avalanchey if you don’t get on top of it in advance. This isn’t me trying to show you up. This isn’t about me at all or about you. It’s about Theodore.”
“Perhaps it’s subconscious.”
“Not my fault’s not good enough. It shouldn’t have happened. I shouldn’t have let-”
Harry’s ears were going hot, and he dug in his money bag for the gold to pay for Theo’s wand so that he could avert his face.
Ron laughed, then added, “And it’s like a generational thing, isn’t it? People her age think it’s not nice to talk about werewolves, you know?”
Harry thought it might be bad form to laugh, “Yes, I actually knew that already. Thanks,” he added. “Apology accepted.” Then he continued rather stiffly, “Sorry for that time in the bathroom. I’d no idea what that curse did, or I never would have cast it on you.”
Draco bounced his eyebrows at Harry, “Except you asked me the same question.”
“That’s good.”
“Except for the nights you were following him,” Ron allowed.
“But it was dodgy of us to keep it from you, Harry. I’m sorry,” Hermione blinked hard.
Harry caught Draco’s hand and kissed it, “Oh is it for my benefit?" He received a little more shoving, but he quite enjoyed it.
Theo smiled, “Thanks, I like yours. Nice to meet you, too. I might not be back that soon, because I’m starting at Hogwarts in a bit.”
Harry showed him to the room that’d been fixed up for him.
“Put your right hand on the door and face toward me,” Malfoy instructed. “Palm down, that’s right. Plant it solidly and make sure your stance is strong as well. Good.” Malfoy placed his own hand on the door and extended the other, “Now take my hand.”
“You called him a nasty little prick, though,” said Dudley.
Draco’s gaze flicked between Harry’s eyes and mouth, “Mmm, well you chose to grow that beard, and it takes up a considerable amount of your face, Potter. I suspect you’re trying to hide behind it and avoid recognition in public, but luckily it suits you. And you haven’t let it grow over your mouth. Some men will let their moustaches overgrow, and then their lips look like a dog trying to break through a hedge. Terribly inconvenient.”
“He used to be.” Hermione smiled, “Sometimes people change for the better. It’s been eleven years.”
“Did you?”
Harry grinned, “Gosh, that sounds dreadful. Being cuddled by this little cat.”
And Draco drew him close, lifted his chin, and kissed him. A warm little query of a kiss. And Harry tried to answer, yes, yes, yes. Yes!
Dudley frowned, “I’m a bit confused. This bloke sent you a valentine and then turned up at your house?”
“We have a process that lifts the charm that makes them move and speak, and then we destroy them,” Draco said, coming to a stop beside the fireplace.
The first room door in the corridor was his library, and the door was shut. Harry opened it very gently, and with a hastily whispered lumos, glanced around the room under the beam of his wandlight. There wasn’t any sign of Draco, but Harry hadn’t expected there to be. Harry quickly checked each room on the way, til he reached Sirius’ room, where he’d installed Draco for the weekend.
Harry could have kicked himself. He had flubbed this before with Ginny and now he was flubbing it again with Theodore, and it was mortifying. But not the moment to get flustered or obsess about what an ass he was being, “No, no of course it’s not bad, darling. That isn’t what I meant. It’s just personal, and it isn’t polite to ask such personal questions. If people want to tell you things like that, you just leave it to them about when and how, okay?”
Theo’s expression shadowed, “Are they alive? And you have to wait for them to die before you can destroy the picture?”
“So you’re still saving the world, then?”
Theodore was already sitting with a cluster of first years on the Hufflepuff side when they found him, so they waved hello and went to sit a few rows back, near the teachers. It was not a very exciting match. Slytherin’s strategy looked rather sloppy in comparison with Hufflepuff’s more methodical approach to the match. But Harry chatted to Draco cheerfully about each team’s performance, and Draco eventually warmed up enough to be chatty as well.
“Obviously I’ve read them, Potter. I pre-ordered them! If I wrote a book, you’d read it.”
“And think of the people in your book that you told me about,” Draco said. “The one your aunt Hermione sent you. Accomplished Lycanthropes Through History. We’ve always been here, and some of us have been very gifted.”
Draco snorted, “You’re fortunate to have such a supportive family.”
“A really good man,” Harry corrected him.
“That’s wonderful, Luna.” Harry looked at Ginny, “What about you? How are things?”
It was Harry’s turn to be embarrassed. “Well,” he offered. “Stay for tea?”
“I think we have time to come back once or twice before you leave,” Harry murmured unobtrusively.
“And you want to make sure I don’t fly off the handle or obsess over Draco Malfoy like I’m sixteen. And you laugh about it right to my face, and it makes me feel like an absolute fool.”
Theodore glanced at Harry, and Harry nodded encouragingly.
“Here I am,” said Harry.
So he was less than delighted when the Floo hummed, and he remembered his appointment with the cursebreaker and was obliged to stop typing. Harry scribbled a hasty note on his pad before jumping up to go and answer the Floo.
Draco returned a few moments later with the hot chocolates in hand, “What’ve you done with my cousin, Potter?”
“Don’t you cheek me, Harry Potter. I’m extremely vicious, and I could easily rend you to bits with my fangs.” He spat lightly on Harry’s erection and gave it one long, hot lave with his tongue before going back to Harry’s chest, kissing, sucking, nibbling bluntly.
Draco answered with his mouth full, holding one hand daintily in front of his mouth, “Would I do that?”
“Oh Potter, if you want to go incognito, I recommend not allowing yourself to be plastered on the cover of a magazine. How could I ignore that face?” he pulled a moue that shifted between a broody scowl and a sullen pout.
“Not at all. At least not intentionally. Belle isn’t me beyond being a product of my imagination. I’m not secretly sneaking Harry Potter’s incendiary opinions into your home through my books.”
“You said you weren’t very nice to Harry. Was he. He was one of the people you hated?”
“Well,” Draco’s hand slid up Harry’s chest and around to the back of his head, where he began to play sproingy games in Harry’s coils.
Dudley laughed, “Well I can’t say that’s not true!”
“From the er. The YLHC,” Harry explained. “He’s the welcome wizard.”
“Absolutely,” Draco popped them into another of his rubbish sacks, then knotted it tightly.
Draco tossed his hair, “I’ve long since given up expecting you to restrain all your revelatory impulses, Harry.”
“Oh yes,” Draco sounded a little wobbly. “Just savouring.” He Vanished the handkerchief, but his eyes continued to stream so that he was forced to Conjure another.
When Harry came out to meet him, Draco was standing on the hearthrug with an overnight bag slung over his shoulder and a wicker hamper in his arms.
“Good to be here. I’m grateful for you, and I know Daisy is as well. It’s nice to have a big family, isn’t it?”
To Harry’s relief, Molly Weasley was still up, sat at the kitchen table with a steaming cup of tea and the copy of
Draco tilted his head toward the door Theo had vanished through, “That dad thing. Tidy your room and do your homework and all that. So responsible.”
“I thought you would probably want to go somewhere in the muggle world so that people don’t gawp at you,” Draco explained as he stepped back to let Harry out of the house. “And I live in Islington, so I just walked.”
“Well. The possibility of an us-ness. It’s a good place to fit into, and I don’t want to fuck things up either. For you or for Theodore. Or for myself. Obviously. Measured and responsible is good. Let’s keep getting to know each other.”
Harry looked in the same direction Draco was looking, and there was something rippling toward them, just submerged in the water. When it reached the shore, it broke the surface, and for a moment, it was a plump, glossy, brown seal. Then all at once, it was a stout, handsome, dark eyed man, in the same black and white uniform the hostess had worn.
Draco rocked against Harry as if he were begging, as if Harry would ever make him beg, “Would you please fuck me? That’s what I want.”
“Right, well you can eat a sandwich and watch a tape simultaneously, can’t you?”
“A Gryffindor,” Draco looked round at the faded crimson and gold hangings, dingy with dust and age.
“Of course,” Draco told him. “A familiar is invaluable. My rabbit Scorpius was the only thing that got me through my sixth year.”
“How dreadful,” Malfoy murmured, still scribbling furiously.
“Why shouldn’t I?” asked Theodore quickly, evidently a little offended.
Andromeda was extremely taken aback, but she found her voice when asked a direct question, “T-er Theodore, it isn’t nice to say that word.”
Draco shook his head, “I shall be too warm soon enough.” He stroked his cat absently, with a sort of air as if he’d rather be pacing the room, “It’s definitely going to startle you. You can’t think what it’s like before you’ve seen it. You’ll be a bit shocked. And it does hurt. A lot. At the beginning. But the instant it’s over, it feels wonderful. So try not to be too alarmed.”
Harry woke suddenly, his heart pounding and pushed himself to sitting, reaching automatically for his glasses and his wand. Mrs Black’s portrait was shrieking about half dog brats, and he thought for a moment that she was the source of the disturbance, til he heard again the sound that had woken him. The wordless, terrified scream of a child. Harry kicked aside his blanket, sprang out of bed and made for Theodore’s room at a run, his wand at the ready.
Harry turned around to find Ron Weasley beaming and waving and striding toward him, his magenta robes even more garish in the mundane green and brown of the road and the field behind him.
“People have strangled,” Draco said seriously. “I should get ready. Be right back.”
“Nasty little prick we went to school with,” Hermione wiped away tears of laughter.
“Yeah, I think we might be a lot better off. I think we have a lot to offer each other.”
Draco laughed, and Harry bent to give Theo a hug.
Harry found Draco’s free hand in the blankets and kissed it, but stayed silent.
“Have you got yourself a dear little familiar now, Malfoy?” Harry asked.
“That’s all right,” Theodore said politely.
Harry had sent her open on the table in front of her.
“The apprenticeship is going well,” Luna said dreamily. “I’m meant to take a class of third years for Care of Magical Creatures this year.”
“If you hang around with someone who’s violent with other people, they’ll get to you eventually,” Harry said.
He decides to push it just a little bit further. 'I mean you no harm, Malfoy. We're grown men now, and anything that was in the past between us is dead and gone. Look, fresh start.'
—then yes, I set it free.' He grit his teeth, fingers itching for his wand. That same mix of guilt and uncertainty over what he'd done came flooding back through him.
'Yeah,' he said. 'We've identified curse remnants on the latest Muggle attacker. Possible Imperio.'
He stood, facing Harry's direction, and then closed his eyes, becoming still.
Harry moved to the center of the room and knelt down on the plush carpet. He closed his eyes and focused on his breathing, trying to center himself. But he couldn't seem to relax, couldn't seem to find the sense of peace, of calm and release that came so naturally to him under Ladon's hands. Despite knowing that Draco had seen him this way before, there was a part of him that wanted to cover his arousal - his nakedness - that was afraid to be so vulnerable.
Harry felt a stirring of something inside him at the thought that he was going to bring Malfoy in for questioning. He wanted to see it as triumph, but he couldn't help the insidious whisper that sounded more like doubt.
'People are being murdered in the Park,' Harry said loudly. A number of heads turned to him, before turning back almost immediately to their work.
talks about can't be the real story. Childhood sweetheart. Dashing Auror. Ministry Darling. Is that why you did it all - to give the rest of the wizarding world a fairy tale? The happy ending that everyone wanted after the war - if Harry Potter could have it, so could they? Is that what it was?'
Ginny nodded, looking at the half-empty bottle of fire-whiskey on the table beside him, but not  commenting.
Rose nodded and looked at Harry. 'Butterbeer makes me feel happy, Uncle Harry. Do you want me to go home and get her?'
He spent the next two nights free of nightmares as well, wrapped up in his cloak. He still didn't believe he was hiding from Death in it. He
'It's so frustrating, Harry. It's like they're deliberately walling me off because I don't specialise in the same field as they do. It's the exact same thing I had with the French, Malaysian, and Chinese Ministries. It's like there's some worldwide conspiracy to keep knowledge and control of magical creatures in the hands of the few.' She huffs in frustration, and puts an arm around Rose, pulling her in close. 'I have half a mind to re-train and change fields.'
He wanted to leave the room. Surely he'd seen what he needed to. He couldn't leave the suite, not until the wards parted to let Andrews back through, but that didn't mean he had to stay and watch this, did it?
Malfoy whirled to face him, the fear on his face morphing into rage the moment he sighted Harry. Parkinson moved forward, putting a restraining hand on Malfoy's arm.
Draco raises an eyebrow in question.
'We've both made a mess of things, haven't we?' Harry said, tracing the scars with his fingertips. He could feel guilt running through him, shame following it, mixing up inside him. The mist thickened around them until it began to fall as droplets of rain. Draco shook his head and leaned in to kiss Harry again.
, Harry said again, not missing the way Malfoy's eyes flickered to his lips as he spoke to Pheo. Malfoy couldn't have a problem with it, not with how comfortable he was around Pheo. Did he ... like it? Harry told himself he was being ridiculous. But he couldn't help the hint of interest the thought stirred in him.
Draco rolled his eyes and scowled at Harry's back.
Rick narrowed his eyes. 'How did you get near the prick? He has three rings of rotating guards. Bastard's the most well-protected No-Maj I've ever seen.'
. He knew there was only one option.
It's a clear invitation for Malfoy to lie down beside him and, to Harry's surprise, he does. Harry hears the sound of Malfoy's shoes hitting the ground, then he says '
Something unreadable passed across Ladon's face at Harry's response and his eyes narrowed, as though it hadn't been what he expected.
Harry goes back into his room and pulls a pair of joggers and an oversized shirt from the cupboard. He puts both on, wincing as the movement pulls at his shoulder, and heads back downstairs, bare feet padding silently on the stairs. He can see the gouge marks from the wolf's claws, and he shudders to think of Draco being trapped in the house with it last night.
, and the panic that had filled him as he realised what he'd said.
It hits him suddenly that if Malfoy is doing nothing wrong—if Malfoy is
The look on Ladon's face was hungry. His gaze was like a caress, taking in every inch of his body. Blue eyes lingered on Harry's cock and he felt himself twitch under the close attention. He reddened in embarrassment at his reaction, but Ladon merely licked his lips, gaze not leaving Harry's hard shaft.
Harry nodded again. Draco's hands clenched into fists. 'Were they ever brought to account for what they did to you?'
If all goes to plan, he'll be getting his job back in about an hour. He wants Draco there, he realises, certainty running through him at that thought. None of this would be possible without Draco. He should be there.
'We're going to miss the drop,' he says instead, forcing himself to focus on his underlying anxiety. He thinks about whatever poor child is probably being carried through the caves right now, headed for a ship that will take them far from home.
'Take your glamour off,' he snarls, and he knows his voice is still filled with disgust over what he saw in that room.
'So what do you need me to do?' he said, wanting to get back to the job at hand, to get paid and to leave this strangely unsettling place.
Marchbanks scanned down the list and Harry saw her eyes narrow as they reached the bottom.
His mum shook her head and went back to tempting Lucy into eating by whooshing the pumpkin-laden 'broomstick' past her nose.
Harry opens the door to see Malfoy serving up a breakfast of eggs on toast. Malfoy's pulled himself back together, Harry realises immediately. His scent has no trace of the arousal he'd woken up with. The layers of concern are gone too. Malfoy smells like they're sharing breakfast on any other day and he has nothing more to do than work on his story for the morning.
Draco nipped lightly at his lip, seeking entry, and Harry opened his mouth, groaning again at the feeling of Draco's tongue twining with his. It was sweet and slow and full of promise. Harry dropped his hands to Draco's shirt, pulling at the waistline, wanting his hands on skin.
Just anything really. I love everything. Every single thing I get as a comment <3
'What was that?' Ginny asked.
But then Draco's gaze dropped to Harry's mouth and his eyes went dark with need and the last of Harry's inhibitions disappeared. He reached out to cup the back of Draco's head, pulling him gently forward until their lips met.
Draco laughed out loud. 'So graceful, Potter. Such an intelligent duck.'
Harry looked back at the shot of Malfoy, turning his anger on the photo as he watched the way Malfoy lifted his chin, as though daring them all to have a go at him. Still a fucking arrogant twat then. He looked like he thought he was cleverer than all of them. Harry grit his teeth, remembering every single time he'd bested Malfoy and made him eat his words. He - if he was doing that - if he was
But whatever, he'd moved on from that a long time ago. Sometimes he thought he should have moved jobs too. Only what would he have done?
, Harry wants to spit at him as Malfoy reaches out to clasp hands with Davies again.
'It's simple,' he said, looking around at the assembled faces with a grin. 'You spin, and kiss whoever the bottle points to. Each round we'll up the stakes. Kisses must be at least five seconds in round one, or you're out. Round two will have tongue. Round three will be full body alignment. Round four - well, let's just see who makes it that far,' he grinned.
'Green,' he said, forcing his voice to be steady. He'd felt far worse pain than this before.
It was only a few minutes before Draco was back, handing him a plate with a golden toasted sandwich sitting on it.
world?' he sneered. He took a step forward until he was chest to chest with Harry, his eyes cold as he glared down at him. 'In the real world, Potter, I'm a Death Eater. I'm Marked. I'm an outcast. In the
-----
Harry looks away as the Polyjuice takes hold. He's never liked watching it. When he looks back, Malfoy is a man in his fifties, with rugged features and silver streaked hair. His clothes are tight until he spells them into shape.
But Malfoy seemed ignore his words, continuing to speak. 'The Boy-Who-Lived would continue to be the boy who lived for everyone else. You've always been a bit like that, haven't you, Potter? Ever since the beginning.'
Potter had given him two flying memories and Draco had studied them obsessively. Charlie relied a lot on strength and he used short, sharp movements, shoving other people out of the way as he played. Draco hadn't brought any of the gear for Quidditch, but he pushed Potter around anyway, chasing him through the sky and trying not to pout too much as Potter outstripped him time and again, circling back with a grin.
Draco stepped forward to cut him off, to make the hateful words stop, but Harry's touch at his back stopped him and Draco realised abruptly that Harry was recording the whole thing. He could see the glow of the charm in the corner of the room, out of his father's line of sight.
'Let's see what you've been up to, shall we, Potter?'
The man in front of Malfoy was silent, but Harry could see the interest in the lines of his body, in the way he leant forward and his knuckles whitened slightly as he gripped at the table. It seemed Malfoy could see the same signs, as he leaned back in his seat and took another sip of wine, the hint of a smile at the edges of his mouth.
Sue wasn't phased by his lack of response.
Harry grit his teeth, glaring at the bird, which was still sitting on his windowsill, an affronted look on its face.
He gripped his own cock as he imagined Draco's hand moving higher, those long fingers wrapping around his shaft, Draco leaning over him, bracing a hand beside his head as he began to wank Harry with long, slow strokes. Harry forced his movements to stay slow, as he fucked himself back onto the makeshift dildo and then up into his hand. He imagined looking up into Draco's grey eyes, imagined Draco leaning closer, his lips almost, but not quite, touching Harry's.
Harry hummed, a broken, raw sound, a sound that told of screaming and raging and smashing for hours on end. But now, as he stood over his son's empty cot, it was a twisted parody of comfort as he tried to remember.
He let out a laugh. Just a small one. Then he heard Hermione giggle beside him. Then Ron laughed again, and then he lost it. The laughter pulled itself out of him in a loud stream. Hermione and Ron both looked at him in surprise and then they laughed harder as well. Harry couldn't help himself. He held his sides and let the laughter come free. He couldn't remember the last time he'd laughed. The last time anything had cut through the fog of misery and despair.
'—have a lot to lose,' Andrews said, reaching for his own glass of wine and taking a deep gulp.
. He frowned, looking around, and glanced back down at the Magical Protection paper he'd only managed to get a third of the way through. What he'd read didn't seem to warrant this level of political cooperation. He wracked his brain, trying to think whether he'd heard any talk around the office recently about big changes. Kingsley's words caught his attention and he narrowed his eyes as he listened.
'He knows, 'Mione,' Ron said, walking into the lounge, hovering three cups of tea and a wet flannel in front of him. 'He's just stirring you up.'
Draco nods back, but remains silent. Harry has an abrupt realisation that they've done it, the case is over. He feels an overwhelming sense of relief flow through him at this thought and he realises he hasn't stopped—hasn't taken a second to think about what all this means. He lets out a breath, feeling something tightly wound inside himself relax.
Malfoy spoke again, jolting Harry from his thoughts. He was looking directly into Andrews' eyes and the look on his face was calculating.
Harry ignored the niggling feeling of guilt in the back of his mind that said that Malfoy wasn't even on his list, and that what he was doing right now—chasing him down, instead of following the other five leads—was the exact opposite of doing his job.
Malfoy tutted at him scoldingly, his voice somehow coming from nowhere and everywhere. 'Now, now, Potter. None of that. You're in my world now, and I make the rules here.'
'You have tattoos,' Potter says, and his voice is surprised.
He walked to Draco's desk and handed him the sandwich and a coffee. Draco looked up at him, grey eyes holding a depth of feeling.
Now the thought that Draco is up there in their room speeds his footsteps. It's still a few hours until the moon. He remembers Draco that morning, riding him slowly, teasing him as he took his pleasure from Harry's cock. He feels himself thicken at the memory. He doesn't think he'll ever get enough of Draco. They won't have time to go out for dinner tonight, but maybe they can tomorrow, once the moon has passed and Harry has a bit of his energy back. Harry knows Draco hates watching him in pain during the moon, so maybe they can do something nice to help him forget it.
'Thank you, Mr Markwell,' Kingsley says. 'Senior Auror Weasley has told us all about your involvement. We appreciate your service, more than you know.'
'She changes it for you, Harry. You remember that, don't you? She changes the date of her birthday celebration -
The bed was the same. Harry found his eyes lingering at the mahogany headboard for just a moment. Felt the phantom grip of restraints around his wrists as he curled his hands around the wood. He heard the murmur of Malfoy's voice in his ear.
He knows Draco is the reason it's different, and it scares him how strong his feelings are.
Harry hesitated for a moment, glancing around the room. His eyes landed on the closed door to the bedroom, which, thanks to Draco's spellwork, now had something behind it. But he flicked his gaze away again, just as quickly.
Harry bent quickly, picking up the sheet and throwing it back over the bike before moving out of the shed, drawing the doors shut behind himself and re-locking them. Then he moved back into the house.
He takes a step forward, watching as the man's eyes travel up his powerful form. His claws clench into fists, pricking at him as he thinks about grasping what is before him. Wolf knows he is big, towering far above the human, barrel-chested with a strength that could tear him to pieces. But still, there is no fear.
'Hey,' he said, and the look on his face was one of discomfort and resolve. 'You know we're always here for you, right? Me and Hermione.'
'Nothing,' Harry says, as he pushes himself upright and steps away. 'I'm fine.'
'Harry,' Malfoy says and Harry's fingers twitch at the use of his first name. What right does Malfoy have? 'I'm not like that—not one of them.'
'I thought we might do something different, tonight,' he murmured, and Harry couldn't help the faint shiver that crossed his skin at the sound of the husky voice in his ear.
When he looked back up, Ladon was watching him, amusement lingering around his mouth. He crooked his finger, beckoning. Harry stepped closer and Ladon leaned in to meet him. He pitched his voice low.
When he's finished, he turns back to the table to see Malfoy, his papers now a neat pile in front of him. The look on his face is difficult to read, but there's an intensity about his eyes and his heartbeat is slightly faster than normal.
He paused again and Harry realised a response was expected.
The camera panned back, showing an array of formally dressed people standing to either side of the President. Harry's eyes flicked over them as he listened. His gaze caught on General Andrews and Harry felt his fear spike higher at the resolution on the man's face. What had he advised in his testimony?
His eyes darted desperately around the room, the room he'd spent days painting by hand, to get every detail perfect. He'd painted symbols for protection, strength, peace and love all through the room, images and talismans from a dozen different countries. He glared at them now, at the ridiculous fucking notion that he could have done something to protect his son, that he could have done anything to protect what was his.
When they get back to the carpark, Malfoy parks the car and climbs out. He returns the keys to their box and then without a word to Harry, Apparates away. Harry stares in shock for a moment before he performs the same spell, hoping Malfoy's returned to their apartment.
Malfoy breaks his gaze as he pulls his phone out and checks something. His cheeks have darkened slightly and Harry can hear his heartbeat. It's slightly faster than normal. Harry would attribute it to the short climb but Malfoy had been fine when he jumped.
Harry spots Malfoy as soon as he walks in. He's glamoured as Markwell again, his dark hair slicked back. He's dressed in well-cut trousers and a deep blue shirt which is open at the neck. He strides into the place like he owns it, and Harry sees a few eyes follow his path. He can't help the spike of irritation that Malfoy's confident stride gives him. He walks like he owns the world. It makes Harry sick to think of the things he's done; things that shouldn't let him live this confident, powerful life.
Hermione looked at him sideways, but didn't ask for an explanation. They were both used to Harry's sometimes-rambling conversations with the snake.
His eye caught on a photo beside the bed and he stepped slowly into the room, feeling all the while like an unwelcome visitor, like at any moment the boy would barrel back into the space.
Harry pulled his wand from his pocket and sent the pot of soup smashing into the fireplace after his departing form.
'It's Harry,' he said, as he always did. A part of him thought maybe Jakub was a bit senile, another part of him wondered if maybe Jakub had lost someone, once. A son. And maybe that was why he always seemed so happy to see Harry. He tried not to dwell on that thought. It made him want to vomit.
'Welcome, all. Today I'll be presenting on a reform package for Auror training, patrols and casework. I'll demonstrate to you the cost and resource savings we can make, while still providing the level of street presence our community is used to seeing from us. In a day and age where we are seeing less -'
Draco nods, handing Harry one of the files. 'Look here: receipts for a gala event at an estate. There's something big like this a week after every flower drop. This has to be where they secure the buyer.'
'Will you be back?' she asked.
'Sorry,' Harry said. 'I was thinking about something else.'
Ginny shook her head, eyes hardening. 'That's not what I'm saying at all - I'm just - I wanted someone I could talk to. Someone who was interested in me. Someone who could tell me about themselves, what they were thinking and feeling. I - I was just sick of being alone in my own relationship. In
Harry follows behind him, trying to push his mind into gear so he can do his job. The bouncer puts his arm out as Harry approaches, looking him up and down.
Harry's mind races for the answer to that. He can tell the Veritaserum is weakening from the fact that it gives him a second to gather his thoughts before the words come.
The golden-skinned woman beside her smiled shyly. 'I was saying I was sorry to have missed it. I was out of the country most of last year.'
'They had no magical signatures,' Harry murmurs, remembering, and opposite him, Malfoy nods.
Malfoy makes a small sound in the darkness as Harry twines their fingers together. Harry doesn't stop to think about the feeling of Malfoy's slim, cool fingers in his. He can't. This is just a necessity so that they can move more quickly. That's all it is. For either of them. If he thinks about it he's going to pull Malfoy against him and bury his face in Malfoy's neck. He forces himself not to think of that as the wolf rumbles its approval.
'Is this your room?' he asked, looking over at Malfoy.
'I kept the bracelet on,' Harry says, casting about for anything to say, to take Malfoy's attention away from what's in front of him.
Harry was taken aback for a moment at the familiarity of the comment, but then, looking at Zabini, he thought maybe that was just the way he was now - one of those people that dripped thoughtless compliments like they were currency, buying their way into any conversation.
'Mr Ladon will be here momentarily.'
find out about it.'
change.' Bullshit, bullshit,
Finally, as the sun rose on the horizon, Harry clutched the bear close to his chest and stood stiffly, heedless of the drop at his feet as he made his way back up to his bike.
Harry nodded and went back to his office to get out of his robes. But when he went downstairs to Floo, it wasn't to Grimmauld Place. He pulled out the piece of paper with Malfoy's address on it and stumbled out of his fireplace a moment later. The room he found himself in was … different than he'd expected. Then he shook his head at himself. He didn't know what he'd expected, except maybe a replica of the Manor. From the little digging he'd done, he'd learned Malfoy didn't live there anymore.
hands, he reminded himself fiercely.
Pansy dropped the red dress to the floor and Draco averted his gaze from her bare chest. Sometimes he thought she did these things just to mess with him.
'I'm serious,' Malfoy says, face set in disapproval for his flippancy. 'That looks bad.'
Harry felt the words hit him like blows as he imagined the life Malfoy's words described. He opened his mouth - to say what, he didn't know, but before he could speak, Malfoy had levelled his wand and Harry found himself standing outside of the bar, the only noise around him the harsh buzzing of the neon sign over his head. He didn't bother trying the door. He knew it would be locked.
It was thick and clotted, and Harry felt his own bile rise at the sight of it. He felt a flash of terror at the thought that this was not supposed to be happening.
He hears a soft groan which is bitten off, followed by a swift shove of movement. Harry opens his eyes to see Malfoy's face only a few centimetres away from him.
None of the people he'd hunted down had given him a connection to the magical signature he'd found at the site of the two deaths, but with each person he interrogated, he found out a bit more. He knew their leader was a woman they referred to as The First. He knew every single, tiny miserable reason they all believed in the Preservation movement and the nauseating supremacy their symbol stood for. And he knew far too many of them had killed. Though none were connected directly to Daniela and Jakub's deaths. And none had even heard of his son.
-----
He's about to turn on the telly, just to give himself something that's louder and more immediate to focus on, when Malfoy moans. It's a breathy, broken off sound, as though he's trying to be quiet. And he is quiet. The sound is barely louder than the splash of water. But something about it sends a flare of heat running through Harry, followed by a feeling of disgust.
Harry rolled his eyes slightly as he nodded yes. She scrunched her nose up at him, but said, 'You know I worry. Especially since you're alone now. These current cases, I can't imagine you're sleeping much?'
Draco nodded. 'He started last year, in their pre-school program.'
'Weasley, I take back every bad thing I've ever said about you,' he said, rising from his chair. 'You're brilliant.'
Harry shook his head, shaking himself back to life. He refused to give up that easily. If they could have something in the dream, something so good, surely it was worth fighting for.
'Just an interesting name to call a child, I suppose. Talking to him is helping you?'
Potter's hair smelled unwashed. Draco frowned and pulled back slightly; he clearly hadn't been taking care of himself. Draco stroked a hand slowly down Potter's back as he considered this information. Potter held him tighter, rubbing his snotty nose against Draco's t-shirt. He stroked Potter's back again and wondered if Charlie would
to help Draco salvage a scrap of his reputation and a chance at a new life. Instead, he sealed Draco's fate with a fist to his face in front of a crowd of hundreds.
Harry could feel his nerves simmering as he approached the nondescript brick building. His glamour was in place - the way his magic had been surging inside him lately, he doubted he'd ever cast a stronger one - and he knew it was unlikely anyone would expect him to be visiting this type of establishment in Kidlington, of all places.
Draco ignored the look of surprise on Harry's face and shoved the door open, wand held out before him.
Fate indeed. He had been watching the Fawley widow for months now, working his way through her social circle one by one. Through a careful word in a certain ear, a helpful suggestion in another, and the sense that everyone around her was a part of it, she'd finally fallen.
Harry shook his head emphatically. 'No. Not Ginny. Besides, that's not really where I bat, nowadays.'
He stepped forward. 'What's wrong?' he demanded. 'Have you and Ginny broken -' he cut himself off at the look of shocked confusion on his mother's face, and instead looked between the two of them again, gaze lingering on Harry's face and the emotion still written across it.
Draco reached over to the bedside table and touched his wand for a moment as he whispered spells to quickly for Harry to catch. Harry braced himself, expecting to feel the charms rush over him, instead he saw Draco close his eyes briefly, hissing in a breath.
He felt an ache at the thought of them. Seeing them again, out of nowhere like that, had shaken him up more than he'd realised. For a moment, he had a mad desire to check on them—to owl them or try and Floo them or something, but he pushed it down. He was better off without them. They didn't believe him, either of them, and he couldn't do what he needed to if they were chasing him down.
Harry sees Davies' fingers flex and he bares his own teeth for an instant before he turns his attention back to Malfoy and takes up a position at the edge of the room.
Later came in bed that night, Draco's mortification dulled by the bottle of wine he'd consumed at Pansy's party. He was on his side, eyes heavy with sleep, when Harry slipped into bed behind him, immediately wrapping an arm around him and snuggling into his warmth.
Harry feels the truth of those words cut through him, realisation and grief, fresh like they were new, flooding in the wake of Malfoy's statement. He whimpers at the pain of it and Malfoy's thumb strokes soothingly across his skin.
'There were, but we didn’t find any pictures of your son,' he said quickly, wanting to reassure Malfoy. He noted the way Malfoy's eyes closed briefly and his shoulders slumped in relief. He couldn’t imagine how it would feel to have that sort of threat against your child hanging over your head.
Draco hesitated, a naked longing flashing across his face so quickly that Harry almost missed it. It was just enough to let him calm his spiraling thoughts and watch as Draco gathered Scorpius in his arms and stood. Harry could see the exact moment Draco put on his cloak of pride and training and made the right choice, instead of the one he wanted.
'We need to bring the meeting of Congress forward,' the thing inside Malfoy said, urgency in its voice. 'It needs to be today.'
Harry waits until they're out of the garage and in the midst of traffic, no sign of anyone he recognises around them, before he asks where they're going.
He feels Malfoy's hands at his boots, unlacing them and pulled them from his feet. They clunk to the ground as Malfoy drops them.
miserable, and I don't know why I came. It was clearly a mistake. I won't make the same one again.'
Malfoy's return smile didn't quite reach his eyes. 'Good news,' he said as he turned to leave. 'Good to hear. I'll send the list through this afternoon, Potter.'
Hermione slid in beside him with a smile, leaning over to kiss his cheek. She was dressed in a black skirt and a green blouse that looked great against her darker skin.
Harry frowned and lit his wand before he began the long walk down the driveway. His boots crunched in the gravel underfoot, but everything else around him was silent. He could see the Manor in the distance and a number of lights were on, the dull hint of them peeking around the edges of curtains and shutters. Harry frowned, wondering why the place was lit up so late at night and quickened his footsteps.
Draco reached down to palm his own cock, hard and straining against his trousers from the look of bliss on Harry's face. He was gorgeous, Draco thought. He'd always known, somehow, that Harry would be like this during sex. Seeing it was like seeing every fantasy, every dirty, shame-filled wank he'd ever had over Potter, come to life.
'Myrdin's Law is the fundamental law of conservation of magical energy in a time continuum. It's -' she groped for words. 'It's basically the law that magic can only work in a forward-moving time field, unless governed by an object that is fixed in time, like a Time-Turner. So I was thinking - how could you possibly have done what you did? It's not just the power that is unheard of - it's the physical inability for a human being to be able to channel a temporal field and to … reverse it.'
Pheo asked in response to his abrupt movements.
The fact that 'James Evans' was written on the file was the only reason Rosa had sent it down to him. The old bitch would have jumped at the chance to get Harry Potter in her claws. Anyone would have.
, a voice whispered dryly in his mind. Harry ignored it. That was different. He wasn't like them. He let his thoughts skitter away from that without focussing on it.
Harry raised his knee to slam it into Malfoy's body, when he was pulled roughly back. He didn't bother to see who had grabbed him, just wrenched his body against their hold.
He continued to read for a minute longer, though Harry could tell he was faking it. His eyes were barely moving.
Lucius cocked his head to one side. 'A target? No, Draco, never a target. He was photographed, yes, but he was on a safe list. As were you.
He was weak the next day, weaker than he'd been in a long time, but it didn't stop him from coming into work. Now, more than ever, he needed to be there to support his team. It was mid-morning when the evidence boxes arrived. They'd set up the conference room as a HQ for all Ministry staff dedicated to the case and Harry was there with Jones and Johnson when the boxes arrived. They all headed over for a look as soon as they realised they'd been sourced from the bomber's house.
So he focused on the fact that the clinic was a brilliant opportunity for her and tried to push away the guilty whisper that it also meant she'd be away the entire weekend and that no matter what state he came home in that night, no one else would need to know where he'd been.
'Not in the mood,' Harry said.
'Good,' Draco says. 'Contact me on the number we spoke on before when you've made it happen.'
Harry passed a newspaper stand as he walked and he paused for just a moment, scanning the headlines. He vanished the butt of his cigarette and leaned closer.
'Pansy told you?' Draco asked dully, unable to summon the energy to be upset about it.
, I remind myself.
He watched Sirius drive towards the camera again and again, grinning each time. Harry let out a slow breath and felt his eyes drift closed. Fucking Malfoy. What did he know.
A thought comes into his mind, and it's filthy. He almost pushes it away before he remembers Draco's response to his request not to shower. He pulls back from the new marks he's sucking into Draco's neck to look at the desperation on his face and grinds hard into him, stilling there as he puts his mouth to Draco's ear.
The next night Ginny had headed out for a team Christmas celebration - he hadn’t wanted to ask her to change plans she'd been looking forward to … but when they'd woken up on Wednesday morning, Harry hard and aching from a confusing dream full of ropes and firm hands and gentle words, he'd caught Ginny in the kitchen before she headed out for the day.
'French heritage,' Malfoy says, 'though I've been living in France for the past five years.'
Ginny just looked at him, tilting her head to one side. 'No. Are you?'
'Come on, Harry,' Malfoy says, leading him away from the door. 'Let's get you back to the bed. That's it. Follow me. I've got you.'
At the bar Malfoy orders himself a scotch, neat, and nothing for Harry, passing the barkeeper payment and slipping him another note as he leans in and says something in Malfoy's ear. Harry just catches the words over the thump of the music.
'Whatever you were doing with him - as Ladon and as yourself, I think - it was helping him. That day we spent at the aquarium … I haven't seen Harry in public without that wary edge to him since we were in fifth year.'
They were having breakfast together the next morning when the Floo flared to life and Hermione stepped through. She stopped at seeing Draco sitting at Harry's kitchen table, a knee drawn up on the chair, clearly dressed in a pair of Harry's old Auror Force joggers and Harpies t-shirt. Harry glanced across at him to see his response and took in Draco's appearance properly. His hair was mussed and he looked as though he'd just been shagged. Harry wondered what he looked like and shifted slightly, wincing at the ache up the backs of his legs as he did so.
'You look like shit,' Ron says in greeting as he hands Harry a cup of tea. 'Put some clothes on and come downstairs. You have an appointment with the Minister in an hour.'
'No one else,' Harry groaned, pushing back. 'Only you.'
. He could do that. He could become that. He could let every single other thing go and just do that. He had no sight and he willingly gave up his hearing as he turned his focus inwards. Touch was all there was.
He spent the first half of his day up on the roof, in the ASS - the name he was
He is home.
Mac's face hardened. 'We do not make direct change against the forces of the dark and the light. We watch and we shape Catalysts, such as yourself, to act as needed.'
Jones grimaced. 'Vultures are already printing the incident. But there's no Muggle connection … yet.'
Ron and Hermione would be having dinner at the Burrow. He thought for a moment about going there, about letting himself be wrapped up in family, in warmth and laughter and welcoming. But he felt too raw - too exposed - for a large group. He just wanted to sit with someone and to be distracted. To listen to them talk so he didn't have to listen to the voice inside his head that said that he would never be anything worth having.
Harry stifles a growl and begins to pace. He can't help it now. The wolf needs to run, to stretch its legs. It wants to hunt in the caves and the forest above.
He picks up the brochure Harry's put on the small kitchen bench and flips it open, frowning. 'We're going to miss the last tour,' he says. 'So we'll have to break in. The drop is tomorrow. We need to know if that's the site.'
She tucked her face into his neck as he moved his hand lower, stroking lightly. They stayed that way for a while, moving together slowly in the dark until Ginny's sleepy murmurs turned into moans and they were both sliding out of their clothes and reaching for each other.
Draco thought about his gut reaction to Potter's presence - to turf him out - to tell him to get fucked, with his judgement and his laws and his self-righteousness … but there had been this fascination in his eyes. His look had lingered on the images spread around the blue room that day and Draco had recognised the yearning for what it was - had recognised what it felt to be a moth before a flame, drawn without understanding that what you sought could consume you.
The Auror office was buzzing the next day, as it had been since the bus crash on Monday. What they were now calling a deliberate attack on the members of the Pureblood Reparations Society was top priority for the entire DMLE. The Society members had been on their fortnightly Magical-Muggle Education bus trip, and no one had had a
Kingsley gestured and a sheet of paper appeared in front of each of them. 'As you will see from today's agenda, we will be visiting a number of ideas to achieve the aims of peacetime de-escalation.' He smiled and clapped his hands together. 'And now I will hand over to our very capable Department of Magical Law Enforcement Head, Robert Javier, who will facilitate proceedings today.'
'Yes,' Baggins said, waving at him in a distracted manner. 'I'm aware. It's all in hand, I assure you.' He finished with the sheaf of papers in front of him and picked the whole stack up, dumping them in a box on the floor before pulling another bundle towards himself.
Malfoy's eyes widened and he stepped forward, grabbing Harry's arm and pulling him through the green door. When it had closed behind him and they were standing in the kitchen, Malfoy let go of him, shaking his head.
have a rather large vault filled with Galleons, by all accounts. Perhaps it's time to put your money where your mouth is.'
He bit his lip, thrusting faster, grinding back harder. His rhythm steadied and he could feel his pleasure building.
Harry threw the memo onto the table, glaring at it as he felt his anger rise, mixing with a sick sense of betrayal. That fucking arse. How could he? Harry had thought that after yesterday, maybe something was happening between them. But Draco had been lying to him this entire time. Had probably been laughing at him as he ran rings around him, deliberately leading Harry in the wrong direction. Had the kiss been a part of that? Another ploy to throw him off the scent? The idea that it had sent pain stabbing through his chest and Harry felt nausea rise. He'd spent the whole night tossing and turning, thinking about Draco and what might be happening between them - what he wanted to happen.
. The thought of being away, cut off, for five weeks makes the anxiety rise higher. His heart beats harder in his chest and he feels something shrink inside him, whimpering faintly. He needs to ground himself more frequently than that. Needs to be around his… people.
Then Ladon's fingers twisted in his hair, pulling his head back sharply. Harry couldn't contain the moan of pleasure as the pain spiked through him.
Decided, Draco took a deep breath and put his wand to his temple, focusing on the memory he wanted to draw out. He concentrated on bringing the emotion with it - on letting Harry inside his mind when he watched these memories play out.
Harry looked down at her, not quite sure what to say - how could he explain twelve years of built-up pain that had fractured apart inside him?
doing
'What do you mean 'Draco'?' Ron asked. 'That was just part of your cover, wasn't it? Those notes you made about him?'
He wouldn't have needed to be more than passable to pick up the man's thoughts. His mind screamed with his need. There was just one thought in it - the image of the peeling door Harry had seen Malfoy enter from.
The meeting had already started when he opened the large doors to the Minister's Chambers. Kingsley wore a faint frown as he glanced across at Harry, but he didn't break his speech to acknowledge him further. Harry cast the
He looked over and his eyes widened with surprise.
He throws his bag into the backseat of the jeep and climbs in, re-setting his glamour so that he looks like a young guy, out for a bit of fun. He pushes back into the seat, trying to put pressure on the wound, and has to bite back a gasp at the increase in the pain.
With that, Rothwell leaves the stage and a sombrely clad man steps up, a pedestal floating behind him. It settles beside him and he gestures at it. A thick, leather-bound book appears on it, and Harry can feel the evil emanating from it from where they stand in the middle of the room. The thing smells of death and the bidding begins almost immediately.
Malfoy snorts. 'Sick fucks doesn't cover the half of this operation. As bad as Davies is, I'm pretty sure whoever is running the thing is far, far worse.'
He put them on the table and unshrunk them, smoothing them out.
'And what do you do with them?' Harry asked. He knew his subtext was clear. What sort of dark rituals are run from a site like this?
invited you? How interesting,' he murmured. 'Well I'm sure there are others in the room you wish to converse with far more than me,' he said, tipping his glass towards Harry's slightly.
. 'What happened?'
Harry Potter's things,' he says, as he turns to look again at Malfoy, holding out his hand to catch his bag and beginning to shove items into it as they fly to him. Malfoy is kneeling over the unconscious man on the floor and Harry can't tell what he's doing. He has his hand to the man's temple.
Draco tensed slightly as she looked around the room. The woman had watched not just him, but his mother grow up, and every now and again she saw fit to make the sort of comment he feared she would now.
'Hullo, sir— er, Harry,' she says, and her smile wavers as she gives the greeting. 'I'm keeping well enough. Thank you.'
Harry forced a smile in return, and Ron's frown deepened to see it. 'What's happened? Is it Ginny? Work? What's wrong?'
A bolt of lightning struck the roof near them, a blinding light that left a scorch mark on the concrete. Harry stepped back a pace.
Harry inclined his head again and then made his request. He'd learned it was best to cut straight to the chase with the creature - unlike Hermione, who loved to while away hours discussing obscure law with it.
'You're... too... late... Catalyst,' it said, forcing every word through Harry's spell with gloating satisfaction.
He looked at the stones, at the cold stillness of them, and he felt his pain well that little bit closer to the surface. He took a deep breath and wasn't surprised to feel it shake.
'I'm going out,' he said to Mrs. Norris as he passed her.
Draco is indeed downstairs when Harry heads down and there's a plate from the communal cook-up sitting next to him on the bench. Harry glances around to see most of the food is gone. Draco makes no acknowledgement that he saved it for Harry, instead sniffing disdainfully at the mound of food, but Harry makes sure to brush against him lightly as he reaches for the plate. Draco stiffens but doesn't pull away.
'Take me home and hold me?'
'My name is Harry,' he said, stepping away and reaching into his pocket for his smokes. He tapped one out and lit it up.
Lucius cocked his head to one side, hair spilling down over his shoulders - reminding Draco of why he wore his own shaved short at the sides. Anything to distance himself from the man in front of him. The look on his father's face was politely curious, but his eyes were full of judgement.
'It's okay,' Draco whispers into his hair. 'It's okay. I've got you.'
'Fuck,' Malfoy mutters and Harry knows it's agreement. He stays there a moment longer, breathing in the warmth of Malfoy's skin, so different from the cool, musky earth smell all around them. Malfoy is still in his grip, but his heartbeat is rising again and his breathing is beginning to come quicker. Harry breathes him in again, his grip tightening slightly as he tries to stop himself from pulling Malfoy against him.
Harry shook the memory off with a  shudder, wondering why now - why after all this time - these thoughts were coming back. He thought he'd left them behind long ago, when he'd left the Dursleys behind.
As it approached the glass, it slowed, cruising by, one huge eye considering them. Draco watched it, knowing that this was the point of no return. If he did this, there was no going back.
'Darius Markwell,' he says, his voice smooth and clipped. Something about it tugs at Harry's memory, burrowing inside him.
He sits at the table, looking down, so it's only from the corner of his eye that he can see the way Draco's smile turns into a frown. It's for the best. Even if Draco has some crazy idea that he might be attracted to Harry, Harry is far too dangerous for him to be around.
'This young man,' Harry said. 'Do you have any idea what he looked like? Apart from skinny?'
. The room reeks of it. He can smell sweat as well, and semen, both fresh with a sharp, bitter tang, and old, crusted and dead. There's anger in the room. Sadness. Disgust. It hits him at once, all of it, and it's all he can do to keep standing.
Draco felt frozen in place, embarrassment flooding through him.
Harry laughed. 'That's magic use in a Muggle area,' he said, affecting a serious tone. 'And in front of the Head Auror, no less.'
Harry wracks his brain for a moment. Bonding magic isn't something he's ever paid much attention to, aside from knowing there are a thousand romance books out there sighing about it. Hermione's had one or two lying around the place, though she loudly decries bonding as one step up from assault.
Harry's eyes snap to his face and he watches Malfoy's reflection as he enters the dressing room. Malfoy's eyes basically rake their way down Harry's body before stopping very clearly on his arse. It's a long moment before he looks away, and when he does, it's to meet Harry's eyes in the mirror.
He's buckling up the belt on his trousers when the door opens and Draco walks in. Harry spins to face him, cursing himself. He'd been so lost in his head, he hadn't been paying attention to the sounds of the house.
'Good,' Harry responded. 'Get the report as a priority. If he shows
Harry feels his annoyance flare into the anger that's always so close to the surface now.
'I achieved what I needed to. Fared better than I expected, actually, and decided I'd head back here to see my favourite people in all the world,' he said, squeezing Scorpius and making him giggle.
'You're not going to try and deny it?' he asked at last.
He thought about what would happen if others knew Harry had been involved with him at the club and the idea sent a cold chill through him. He'd be sent to Azkaban. It wouldn't even require a trial. They'd only need a glimpse into Harry's memories to see the so-called depravities a former Death Eater was subjecting him to … and from there, accusations of Unforgivable curses, illegal potions, who knew what else.
'Tomorrow?' he asked instead. 'I'll come into the Ministry first thing? I should get home now though. Ginny won't want to find me gone when she wakes.'
Harry slumped onto his stool and poured himself a generous splash. He tossed it back, the burn barely registering before he poured again. Then he sat, resting his head on one hand as he scratched aimless patterns into the tabletop with his fingernail.
'We need somewhere completely unconnected to this case and to Markwell,' Harry says. Malfoy nods immediately and reaches for Harry's arm.
Harry pushes himself into a standing position and takes a shaky step forward. His leg knocks into something warm and he stumbles, reaching out. He doesn't manage to catch himself and he falls forward as arms reach up to grab at him. He lands badly, twisting so that his back smacks into something hard. Harry cries out at the new flare of pain and feels a hot wetness as blood begins to run down his back again.
Draco cleared his throat and pointed to the letter again. 'Over a two year period, my father received a large amount of correspondence that is signed off by someone called
, he reminded himself.
'Fuck, Charlie,' Harry moaned, biting his lip. 'Harder. I'm close.'
in quick succession, before he siphoned the spill from the carpet.
He didn't know how long it was before the door opened and he heard Ron's curse as he took in the room, and Harry standing in the middle of it. He couldn't stop staring at the carpet, it was sodden now, thick and heavy with the booze, darkened to the colour of blood. It had soaked across the room to him. Harry could feel the wetness of it under his bare feet.
right -
He ignored it. He could track down the next person on his list after he was finished with Malfoy tonight. But he had to see him first. The idea of not doing so made him feel like something was prickling under his skin, just this side of painful.
He feels the wolf's savage glee at his failure. It won't be denied. Not anymore. It knows what it wants and it's so close to freedom. Harry can taste its rage and its burning need to shift. To run. To tear and rip and kill.
Then he caught sight of Malfoy a few metres away, drink in hand, talking to a couple at a table near the door and he sucked in his breath. The costume Malfoy had worn at the Solstice Ball had been one thing,
Harry bristled, 'I got into the dream room, didn't I?'
He looped the ropes around her upper arms and forearms in turn, tying beautiful, symmetrical, intricate knots - linking them back into the loop he'd begun with, in the center of her back. He twisted the last of it around her wrists, fastening them together and then drew the whole thing in tight. Harry gasped as her body drew taught and she let out a soft moan that echoed around the silent room. The ropes tying her upper body were a work of art and Harry couldn't stop tracing their path, wondering at the hours - years - it might take to reach the level of effortless skill Ladon displayed.
'What are you doing?' Malfoy asks, his voice hard.
Harry rubs his thumb gently across Draco's cheek again and waits. He'll wait forever, to get this right.
Malfoy flashes him a small smile, but it's tinged with sadness. 'It made me think of Pansy,' he says quietly, then he revs the engine and reverses them out and up onto the road in a squeal of tyres. Harry doesn't ask. Every attempt he's made over the past few weeks to question Malfoy about his former friends or former life has been met with misdirection or flat out silence. The fact that Malfoy has even mentioned Parkinson's name is a miracle and Harry doesn't want to push his luck.
Draco flushed slightly, despite himself. 'It's worked up until now,' he said. Granger opened her mouth to reply, but Weasley interrupted them.
. Something inside him yearned to step into the building. To seek what it was offering. He felt the gentle tug again, softly, almost insistently, as though it was promising him comfort, succour, if he just stepped inside. It was late and he was tired - so tired - and there was just enough alcohol flowing through his system still that he listened to it. He stepped forward, pushing at the large, hardwood door.
. Harry needed this. Draco had wanted this for a long time, too. Fast was fine.
Harry laughed at the boy's babble of questions, feeling his chest lighten for the first time in days. He remembered another blond boy who was so proud of his very big name, so many years before. But there was nothing of Malfoy's pride and arrogance in Scorpius' eager, open face. He opened his mouth to answer but Malfoy shook his head gently at the boy.
'Alright then, you snob,' Harry said. 'Come and show me how it's done.'
Ron shook his head, 'Nah, Hermione's got the next couple of days off. She's taken the kids to the market. Just thought I'd come to check up on you.'
The kitchen was empty when he entered it. There was gentle movement at the sink as dishes washed and stacked themselves on the rack, and over by the fire a pot of soup bubbled, the ladle stirring slowly. Harry smiled faintly, feeling an echo of the wonder that he'd felt at his first visit to the Burrow seventeen years earlier.
Then, under Elders' prompting, he described the night of Scorpius' abduction, his terror at realising his son was gone. He recounted Avery's words that night, about how they would remove Draco to make way for Scorpius.
Harry nodded, thinking - hoping - he'd be in good enough shape by then to hold up a conversation. The thought sent a tingle of excitement through him. He didn't know what the night would bring - and somehow the anticipation was heightening his need to be there already.
'I haven't been inside that room since …'
It's two days before the next full moon when Harry takes Draco to visit the Burrow. The weeks in between solving the case and getting to this point have been frantic. Both of them have been bombarded with media and letters and speeches and commendations. It's been overwhelming, and that, combined with the upcoming moon, is putting both Harry and his wolf into overdrive.
Malfoy looked after him for second and then shook himself, turning to Harry with a scowl. 'You almost died last night, Potter. You drained your magical core - even if it is bloody more impressive than anyone else's. What are you doing creating a bloody nonverbal Patronus so soon after -' He cut himself off abruptly, cheeks reddening, as though realising he'd been scolding Harry like an angry mother.
If anything, Potter's frown deepens. It sets the burn of the injustice stirring inside me, the one I'd thought long buried.
'Git,' he said, before he leaned in to kiss Draco again. If he couldn't tell him he was sorry, he could show him.
He focused back on Ron, and then Hermione ran into the room, rushing to his bedside and throwing her arms around him.
, Potter,' Malfoy growled, the expression on his face raw and full of pain. Harry felt the words hit him like blows. 'Pansy has been dead for almost two years because your precious fucking Ministry wouldn't let us bring a specialist in to treat her blood disease.' His voice broke on the last word and the sky flashed as lightning split it apart.
He barely looked to see whether Luna was following them.
He picked them up and lay back, squinting and blinking as he tried to wake up. One was from the Ministry and Harry considered an Incendio, sight unseen. Instead he flipped it open.
The dreamscape had been scary at times - it had felt so real - but he didn't think it had been dangerous.
Harry stepped closer to the railing and reached across it, pulling Draco to his feet. He put his arms around Draco's slim form, the railing digging into his thighs, pulling him close for just long enough that Draco returned the gesture, breathing a quick
The mood in the room is shifting again as bidders drop off one by one until it's only the portly old man who'd purchased the spell book in the beginning and Rothwell who are still bidding. Rothwell stands down at seven hundred and ninety thousand and the auctioneer looks around the room for a moment before declaring the old white beard the winner. He steps forward, and suddenly Harry can't do it anymore. He can't see that man touch the boy standing up there, so alone and vulnerable.
'What do
'We start there,' Harry said firmly. 'If we don't find him, we shake your father for the answers we need.'
Draco had heard her, loud and clear, and then he had reached with both hands for the chance to escape his damaged prison of a body. Even a few hours in someone else's form was a relief so complete he thought he could die from it.
'You had a cancellation this morning,' Mrs. Norris said, pursing her lips. 'The monthly Improper Use of Magic Office Departmental Heads Update Meeting has been postponed. George Banks is in St Mungos, apparently. As we'd rescheduled the Reparation Society meeting on Monday, I took the liberty of accepting the request and I let Mr. Malfoy know he could -'
He frowned, hesitating for a moment, then reached for his wand. He needed the money. His vaults had taken a hit in the last year. He wasn't poor, not yet, but he couldn't keep spending money the way he was at the moment without some way of replenishing it. And he'd be damned if he asked anyone back home for help. He tapped the job and it disappeared from the page. Jonas would know he was in Czechia, but that couldn't be helped. And Jonas knew far better than to share that information with anyone else.
He picked up lamb shanks on his way home, putting them straight under the pressure spell and getting the rest of the ingredients in with them in record time. Then he went upstairs to shower and change. He came back down, nervous, moving around, tidying things up. Ginny walked in close to seven and sniffed appreciatively.
No, Malfoy being in proximity to Harry is ludicrous, unless, of course, Malfoy is an investigative journalist. Unless the story of just why Harry Potter had suddenly quit the Aurors to live the life of a reclusive bodyguard operating under a glamour was one that any paper in Britain would kill to publish.
Harry nods and feels himself flush. He feels so out of it, like every part of him has been taken and rearranged, made new under Draco's hands.
Harry got her mug off the shelf and they watched each other without saying much while the kettle boiled.
'Seriously P— Hunter,' Malfoy says, grabbing his arm and pulling him away from the window. 'What part of "we're going out for dinner" did you not understand? How you can eat as much as you do and still be hungry is beyond me. Now, hurry up. Even with magical tailoring, we're going to be hard pressed to get you dressed in time.'
Malfoy ignored Harry's clear hostility and pulled out a chair. He sank gracefully into it, looking around Harry's office with an air of faint curiosity. Harry prickled at the judgement he just knew was sitting under the polite façade. His office was a mess. He wasn't paid to keep things tidy. He was paid to get things done. What right did
he could start to heal.
'Anyway, did you still want to help, or-?'
'How are you holding up, today?' she asked as she kissed his hair softly.
'Bathroom is there,' Draco said brusquely, waving his hand off to one side. 'Room is warded. You should be able to sleep here without nightmares. When you wake, let yourself out the front door.'
The moan at his ear was loud enough that he could hear it over the music. Harry focussed on it. He wanted the freedom of a hook-up with a stranger - just for tonight. He wanted to feel the man's mouth on his, press against him and get some relief for himself. He wanted to lose himself in feeling and to not feel, all at once.
“It looks nice in here,” Theodore remarked, wiping Floo ash off of his glasses with his shirt tail. “Granny said it was probably still a bit horrible, but it seems all right.”
Something seemed to occur to Draco, “Do you want me to be nice to you?”
Ron cut in, “And we only didn’t tell you because we didn’t want you to get all worked up.”
Theo stopped looking around at the shining eyes all about them to turn his attention to Draco, “Really?”
Harry nodded, “I think you’re probably right about that.”
“That’s all right,” Harry patted Hagrid’s elbow as his boots reconnected with the ground. “I wouldn’t want to interrupt your visit.”
“Okay.”
“Yeah, exactly,” Harry willed himself not to titter awkwardly and was mostly successful. “It just seems a bit. Trivial. Selfish. Know what I mean? Shouldn’t I be focusing on Theodore?”
Luna answered the door, smiling serenely, “Hello Harry. You’re looking very wet and muddy.”
“Theodore,” Harry began when they were waiting at a zebra crossing outside of Diagon Alley. “I’m sorry about earlier.”
“That’s the gist of it, I think,” Harry said. “Why do you ask?”
“No more boggarts in here,” announced Malfoy finally.
“Sorry, I suppose that’s not very nice.” Harry tried to explain what an astronaut is.
'Warming charm works just as well,' he said, indicating the machine.
'You're home early,' she said over the sound of the music.
Harry's eyes held a depth of emotion as he reached out to clasp Draco's hand in his.
'Just a bit of pre-match sledging,' he said, grinning.
'We fight together, now, the world over, for the survival of humanity,' the President continued, his voice commanding. 'Magic, and those who wield it, will be exterminated.'
'Have you seen today's rubbish?' he demanded, throwing it down on Harry's desk. Harry took in Malfoy's appearance - his brows were drawn down in a scowl and his face was slightly flushed. His hair looked tousled, as though he'd been running his hands through it. Harry suddenly wondered if that was the appearance Malfoy had meant to reveal.
Harry sat down at the desk, putting his feet up on the edge of it as he watched Malfoy's slow circuit.
'How do you know?' Malfoy asks, looking sceptical.
'Trust me,' was all Harry said in response.
'What's your Pa-tro-nus, Harry?' Scorpius asked, turning to him after a moment of watching the bird soar with rapt attention.
Malfoy lets out that faint huff of amusement again, though it doesn't show on his face.
The first thing he laid eyes on when he entered his workroom was a new case of memories, packed away into little green vials. None of them were labelled, but his name—the made-up one he worked under—was scrawled on the note attached to the top.
'This is more than a big night, Harry. You look wrecked. You look -' His voice trailed off, but Harry could hear the unspoken words. He'd thought them himself when he accidentally caught a look in the mirror.
'Everything …' He let his breath out. 'Everything is wrong.'
It's two days before the full moon when Davies finally agrees to meet. Harry spends the time watching; asking innocent questions that Malfoy always manages to twist back on him; working small, friendly gestures into their interactions with each other. Harry doesn't feel like it's making much of a difference yet. Malfoy is still acting like the same rude, arrogant twat, but it's something to do while they wait.
He flew for another twenty minutes before he gave up on his westerly direction and cut to the south. He leaned harder and harder into the flight, forcing it to push him through the air faster and faster. The further he travelled, the more the clouds started to boil and swirl. Harry felt anticipation rise in him. He was headed the right way. He knew it. He tried to ignore the way the storm was growing even stronger the closer he got to its centre. Draco would be alright. He had to be. He distracted himself by trying to figure out where he was and what he would find when he dropped back through the clouds. He thought about how long and how fast he'd been flying for and the rough directions he'd travelled.
Harry catches the skip in both their heartbeats at the reference to Mother, and from the sandy-haired man, he gets the acrid scent of fear. He thinks, for a moment, Draco has gone too far, but then the man nods and mutters agreement under his breath.
Harry bangs his shoulder against the door again, whimpering at the pain that jolts through him.
, a voice whispered in his mind.
He was sick of it. Sick of feeling like he had to protect himself from everyone around him, had to put himself and what he wanted last.
,' Draco said, a look of sadness crossing his face. '
'Scorpius is a wonderful boy,' Hermione said, watching him and Rose comparing chip sizes.
'He gets sick if he doesn't do this?' Draco clarified, eyes fixed on the creature.
'Sure,' Harry said, nodding, and then twisting so that he was sitting on the couch, facing Draco, one arm along the back, one leg bent up underneath himself. He racked his brain trying to think back. And then he began to describe how the grounds and Manor had looked and felt, the strangeness of the difference.
“I’ll have you know, Potter, that many people would pay good money for a decent picture of my lovely arse perched over the lavatory.”
Draco widened his eyes, playing for time to think. “I know very little, Potter. Haven’t you learned that?”
Draco looked down at them, shaking his head. But he couldn’t tamp down on the fond smirk tugging his lips wide.
Draco held his breath for a second, terrified of what she might have seen, brain running crazily over how he must have looked just then, earwigging shamelessly. Worse still- had he looked obviously invested in the conversation? In what Potter had to say about Finnigan?
“What the fuck, Malfoy?” He said abrasively, pushing at Malfoy’s arms that were caging him in.
’ and the door swung open with a squeal of rusty hinges.
“Bullshit,” Zabini cut in. “I told you the other week.”
It was time to put the plan into action.
Pansy hadn’t come back for eighth- year. Her parents had sent her off to a finishing school in Switzerland, and she wasn’t allowed an owl. Draco had sent her letters, of course, but there was no way to know she’d read them. It had been lonely living in London alone, but somehow being surrounded by hundreds of students all day was even lonelier. It had struck him sometime in the middle of his second week trailing miserably to classes how he had really made enemies of most of his year during his first six years at school, and how the few who hadn’t hated him now hated him anyway because of what he’d done in his seventh. He even got nasty looks from a few Slytherins, which in his opinion was a bit rich, but what could you do? Who was going to listen to him complain about the hypocritical bastards when everybody despised him?
Draco spluttered. “Of course not, that’s crazy, that’s, that’s-- Pansy?”
When laid out like that, the answer seemed obvious.
Draco’ throat was dry, suddenly. “What does that mean?” He was terribly conscious of Pansy and Blaise a few metres behind him, undoubtedly straining to listen.
Draco thought. He felt stuck, unable to move forward or think around the maelstrom in his head. It expanded with every breath, taking up every single brain cell until he couldn’t imagine thinking of anything different.
Predictably, the first adjective that came to mind was ‘endearing.’
Blaise nodded frantically, chocolate eyes dazed.
Harry stepped inside, feet ginger, and the carpet exhaled a puff of dust. He sincerely hoped the house was not in as bad a state as it had been the summer before their fifth year. He suppressed a shudder. Now Kreacher had died… he didn’t like to think what kinds of ruin the house had fallen into.
“It would have been a problem if we’d progressed to this stage in the conversation. As it was, you didn’t even get the colour right.”
“No there aren’t!” Ginny fought, and all of a sudden she was standing up, hair tangled over her shoulders, fists clenched by her sides. Her nails looked as though they were biting into the Quidditch- roughened skin of her palms, and her colour was high, eyes glittering from alcohol and, Harry realised with a dull shock, tears.
Draco’s gaze swung up to Potter, who was watching him with something unreadable in the set of his mouth and chin. His eyes, though—well, Draco had always been able to read his eyes. He knew softness when he saw it, and his stomach exploded when he met Potter’s stare, traced the swipe of his tongue over his lips as he flushed and opened his mouth again.
**********************************************************************************
Mere metres away from where Potter was sitting, his pulse picked up again. Draco started going over what he was planning to say, words running together in his head in a glistening river.
“Yes. No, I—No. I don’t know.”
Draco ducked his head, hands busy over his Potions kit, putting everything back and send the rubbish flying over to the bin with a flick of his wand. Weasley was making a right racket, grumpily tossing things into his bag with a foul expression on his face.
Ron choked.
—the team, I mean to say. We were just thinking a practice match would be good, get us all back in the swing of things, and to be honest, they’re getting a bit restless. You know, waiting for match season to come up.”
The trees set in the centre of the square warded them in with sheaves of pale green leaves, fading light sifting through each paper- thin surface until the air was flawless and pure as the heart of a jewel. Blaise and Draco slowed their pace as they strode across the square, admiring the beauty of the gleaming pavement and diluted colours. Pansy was waiting for them at the entrance to the restaurant; a Muggle establishment that had a large wizarding clientele due to just how good the food was.
wants to get into his pants.”
Draco picked his toast back up and took a healthy bite. “She called your wand classy.”
With a groan, he collapsed against the brick wall and leant into it, gasping for breath. His hair was sopping, darkened by rain and dripping into his eyes, gel completely dissolved. His robes- he looked down and grimaced- were soaked at the shoulders, weighing heavy and wrinkling uncomfortably so he had to keep shifting and rolling his shoulders.
Which opened up a whole egotistical can of worms.
“Christ,” Draco said, smiling despite himself. “What do you look so concentrated for?”
he thought.
Finnigan made a small sound that Draco couldn’t be bothered to decipher.
He was interrupted by a soft shifting on the bed before them, and a creaking sound from the mattress. They looked down to see Potter sleepily turning over, throwing an arm half- over his eyes to block out the warm rays haloing him.
Christ. That had come out... harsher than he wanted.
Ginny trailed off, and looked at Ron pointedly. “If you think you can handle this, fine. But on your head may it rest. Consider this a warning. I will be talking about my teenage self fancying someone.”
“Noted,” Hermione said. “But- did you say something about being hungry?”
The taxi was silent; ruminative on Malfoy’s side and frustrated on Harry’s. He was incredibly close to tearing his own hair out. The hunger in his stomach had not abated, but now his mind was racing familiarly, and he missed the slick blur of arousal, where his thoughts had run together like a rainbow river of diesel. Madly, the urge to curl into Malfoy- lick up his throat and grind on him, was rising steadily, a churning wall of desire. Christ, he just felt so fucking needy, like he wanted to be petted and warm and just…
The Lucius Voice goaded.
Harry felt drugged, kind of, swimming in this haze. His breath kept catching and he was faintly aware that he was mewling, little wounded whines muffled in the black fabric he was pressing his face into. The only clear, real thing was the person attached to that shirt, the person who was filling his nose with pines and smoke and cold, clean cologne.
Instead, he scowled. “Mind—” he broke off to choke a little, and it completely ruined his mojo. He swallowed. “Mind releasing me, Potter?”
“’Mione…” Ron said hesitantly, “Have you eaten?”
Draco exhaled, blood thumping unsteadily through his veins. For a brief moment, he was breathless with something, an emotion it took a second for him to place, and when he did, he snorted with laughter.
he added- amount of meekness.
The owl looked disgusted.
“…is something wrong?”
But he was left with his mouth gaping open-
********************************************************************************************************************************************************
“You didn’t like that?” Malfoy asked, tone insouciant.
hasn’t noticed that Potter’s been gone all week?”
Yeah, the Animation charm was, like, really old and difficult, and yeah, he’d spent ages looking it up in the library, but who said that meant he gave a toss?
Finnigan’s trousers were loose around his hips, evidently hastily pulled up, and his hair was a mess, as though there had been hands carded through it quite roughly, running against the direction of the gel that had been stroked into it. His greyish- blue eyes were sheepish, and there was a firm glint in them that was… a little challenging. Or were they even-
“What’re we going to do?” he said, voice rising to embarrassing heights.
It seemed both a very short and terribly long time until Draco heard the sound of feet on the stone of the dormitory steps, and the first gaggle of Slytherin girls padded sleepily through the common room, still tightening their green- striped ties and pulling emerald ribbons through their hair. Soon after, a trio of small boys burst down the stairs, jittering excitedly across the room, hair mussed as they slipped hastily through the dungeon door and fled, unable to contain themselves at the delicious aromas from the kitchen that had somehow begun to permeate even the common room way below the lake. From there, droves of students emerged from the dormitories, in various states of dress and fatigue. But it was not until the last sleep- deprived, weary fifth- year had slumped from the room, trailing Charms notes, that Draco unfurled himself on the cushy window seat and went up the stairs to dress. After all, he had plenty of time; Hufflepuff finished practice twenty minutes before first period, and that was ages away. Draco wasn’t hungry, either- his stomach felt oddly queasy from sleeping so little, and he wanted water more than anything.
that!”
“Number 12, Grimmauld Place.”
His breath was coming quickly, and when he hummed Harry’s legs shook a tiny, embarrassing bit, because his voice was rough and deep, like he had a whole new range for arousal that only Harry had heard.
His brain supplied.
“Well,” he gritted out, “what do you think of my
, Draco thought.
Draco stared at her from across the table. He looked towards Blaise for help, but Blaise was seemingly engrossed in the Quibbler, dark chocolate eyes fixed on a chunky block of text, doubtless some propaganda about an invented magical creature. However, his gaze did not seem to be moving, and now that Draco was looking, that crooked dimple in his right cheek was deepening steadily as the seconds went by.
“So I thought… well, you lot seem the most ready for competition. The best prepared, that is.”
“No!” Draco said, glaring at the offending creature. “I won’t reward obstinacy. He wouldn’t go round the house. It’s a simple service, and he was below par.”
“That’s why I thought he’d be on my side,” Draco said emphatically, and Blaise grinned.
Blaise cleared his throat, eyes never moving from the page he was staring fixedly at. “Well, whenever you put a lot of research into something so you can talk about it, it generally means you’re actually obsessed with a person doing that something. It’s an excuse to talk about them as much as possible.”
Yeah, that was concerning.
“You’re not looking for a
Fucking… oh, god.”
“Yep, yeah, mm-hmmn. That’s, ah. That’s me,” Draco stammered, and wanted to Avada himself.
Draco pressed a hand to his heart, softening. “
Draco remembered helplessly- whispering over his ear.  Days had gone by, and Draco had been normal. Steadfastly normal. Nothing had changed, not that he knew of, anyway, and if he resolutely didn’t look when a certain scruffy dark head ducked into the hallways, well- who’d noticed?
The light-headedness was leeched out of his bones, leaving him tired and blue, veritably navy blue. He inclined his head towards Zabini.
Zabini sighed. “Well, he’s in the hospital wing. I was checking because...” he gnawed on his thumbnail, and Draco was taken aback by the endearing look of it. “I thought he’d be back by now. He’s just… I mean, normally… I mean…”
“Wha time s’it?” he asked the room, squinting in a way that was desperately cute. Draco’s stomach tightened.
And then Blaise Zabini slammed himself down opposite Draco, excessively groomed quiff slickly gleaming in the soft breakfasting light. Draco groaned internally, resting the sausage down on his plate. He looked at it wistfully for a moment, and then turned his attention to the seething boy sitting before him.
The dark- haired man interrupted, voice considerably quieter and more reasonable. Draco could just about make out his words anyway; the restaurant had quieted, people staring shamelessly at the spectacle.
“I see you let yourselves in, then,” Professor McGonagall said from behind Potter.
He felt something wet on his cheeks and Draco realised he was crying, eyes streaming with the strength of the mist their Draught was giving off. Through a haze of tears, he saw Granger helping Weasley up from the floor, and the other students standing around, shocked- looking and frozen. Draco heaved suddenly, stomach convulsing on itself, and his airways felt tight, as though they were closing in. The thick dew of tears blurring his eyesight worsened, and he hacked, arms kept firmly behind his back by whoever was holding him. He had just started to gasp for air as a voice said,
“I don’t want to say,” Pansy said mulishly.
“Should we go inside, Potter?” His grin widened. “Or do you want to ravish me out here?”
“Except that whatever that thing was might’ve cursed you instead of just burning you, and then every funny twinge or queer feeling you had for the next week, you’d be wondering if it might be your doom,” Harry said patiently, brushing the soot off his robes and aiming a Silencing Charm in the direction of the portrait corridor to muffle Mrs Black.
“Yeah!” exclaimed Theo, then looked at Malfoy. “Are you coming with us?”
Draco nodded and dug in his bag, withdrawing a blue sheet of parchment, “We’re a very legitimate group; we work with St. Mungo’s and the Ministry. It isn’t just a load of crackpots meeting in someone’s extension once a month.”
Draco conjured a sort of settee and gestured to it, then sank onto it after Harry, “He was my cousin as well, wasn’t he? Your godfather.”
“I could eat you,” Draco said fondly.
“Here you are,” Draco echoed. He kissed Harry again, then reached for his wand, “Nox maxima.” The lamps were extinguished immediately, but there was a glimmer of orange light coming in from the street lamp outside the window. Draco replaced his wand on his night table and cuddled closer to Harry, disturbing Shadowfax who jumped off the bed.
Harry got the giggles again.
Harry’s middle felt sort of warm and wobbly like a melting jelly, “You’ve read them?”
“I’m just coming!” Theo yelled back, looking considerably perked up at the invitation. He gave Draco a quick hug, hoisted Twinkle’s basket in one hand, then grabbed his trunk from Harry and jumped onto the train.
Harry laughed again, “So you think I’m fibbing about not being Belle Brewer?”
Malfoy’s lip twitched, “I’m a cursebreaker. I’ve been engaged to inspect the house and help make it more safe.”
“There’s nothing to be embarrassed about! We’re nearly thirty! Isn’t that too old to be embarrassed about things that happened when we were twelve?!”
On their way out, they stopped at the welcome desk, and the welcome wizard gave them some leaflets on the counseling and potioneering sessions, as well as some informational pamphlets. Harry took every one he suggested and came away with a thick stack with titles like
“I was,” said Draco simply. “A long time ago, when he was still alive.”
“And now you’re off to Hogwarts yourself, I suppose?”
Ron took his arm, “Go on, then.”
Mingled surprise at Malfoy’s composure and irritation at being defused by him rolled over Harry. He took a deep breath as well, “Okay.”
Draco was lying on his side, petting Shadowfax, when Harry peeked in, but he sat up with a smile when Harry came in with the dish, “What’ve we here?”
Harry burst out laughing, “I hope you feel complimented by that, Luna.”
“I don’t have any rosettes anymore,” Draco said a little stiffly. He looked a bit pink under his cap, and Harry had thought it was with cold, but now he wasn’t sure.
“I killed it!” Harry protested.
Malfoy tilted his head, “Sort of, but you don’t need to do much. I’ll cast the spell myself.”
Draco was obliged to return the next day in order to finish his work, but the rest of the decontamination went much more smoothly. Harry was not permitted to assist any further, but there wasn’t call for it anyway. He followed Draco from room to room, and Draco chatted to him casually about the work.
“Oh no, don’t mention it,” Draco smirked, but it was that new smirk, and Harry quite liked it. “Tell me more about how funny and clever and handsome you find me. I’m rather enjoying it.”
that she had received for Christmas earlier that day and then sit still while she read it back to him and Rose, who had been attracted by the first recitation. Ron got tipsy and announced that it was all right with him if Harry wanted to go out with a toff, ignoring Hermione’s giggly shushing. And when Molly put on her Celestina Warbeck record, Andromeda had Draco out of his chair again to dance with her.
Draco shook his head, “Not much. I used to be really anxious to get out and run about when I first started transforming, but my Healer told me it was to do with feeling ashamed to be at my parents’ house because I was uncomfortable with my condition. These days I just hang around the flat and get bullied by Shadowfax, and then spend the next couple of days snacking and sleeping and sometimes reading a bit. Oh, I do tend to be a bit packish while I’m transformed, so don’t mind me if I’m. Unusually. Affectionate.”
Something about the sound of his name in Draco’s mouth sent a little zing of excitement straight to Harry’s groin. He shifted in his seat to press his knee more firmly against Draco’s, “This is going to sound very Victorian of me, but you’ve somehow made it really hot to hear my name from you.”
