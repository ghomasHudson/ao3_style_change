— I mean, no offense,” she added quickly, realizing she was talking to two other queens who had chosen the same world wonder.
“Ladies, I’ve made my decision,” RuPaul declared, pausing for dramatic effect. “Draco—! Chanté, you stay.”
“Well, um, as a choreographer, I have directed teams of drag dancers to learn their moves, and that’s like herding cats. So if I can do that, I can work with Capitol Hill. I will get Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer to bop, mop, and shablam until we have our country all moving in sync.” Venus shimmied at the podium.
“Oh, I’m sure it’s nothing. Probably just escaped a zoo or a film set or something. I mean, this is Hollywood — anything can happen,” Kali said.
“Well, what else am I going to do with my time?” Draco shrugged, then gestured around at the sheets of parchment strewn all over the desk and floor, covered in copious notes. “I’m a professional drag queen now. Or, at least, I will be, as soon as I get the right supplies.”
“Get ready, America! Draco—” she paused dramatically, taking off her sunglasses to reveal stunning silver eyes, “—has crossed the pond.”
Potter just shrugged. “Maybe I’ve missed having you in my life? You made up such a big part of it when we were in Hogwarts.” He looked Draco up and down. “And I’d be lying if I said I didn’t find you just as attractive as I did back then.”
After they left, Draco turned back to the passage in the book and found a statement that would cause an unfortunate complication in the plan:
As luck would have it, a spectral silver stag suddenly jumped through the hotel room window and stopped in front of Draco’s bed.
Todric demonstrated a series of moves to each queen and then had them run through the choreography altogether.
The Bent Unicorn was eerily quiet. Draco had completely forgotten about that moment in the interview, and cringed to see it on screen, especially now that she was in a large room surrounded by people who knew exactly what those masks had been about. The wig of snakes weighed heavily on her head despite the lightening charm.
“Yaaaaasss!” This announcement garnered even more excitement. Draco cheered along with the other queens, even though he had no idea what that meant.
“She hexed off Paris’ left buttcheek,” Goldie said. Paris rubbed her derriere and made a sad face. The audience laughed.
“Hello, hello, hello!” RuPaul entered the workroom and descended the stairs, this week wearing a white suit that looked like someone had spilled blue ink all over.
“Is that really the camera?” Draco gasped at the all-too-familiar voice. “Oh! How novel!” Draco clasped both hands over her mouth as she stared at the screen in shock.
Draco delicately pretended to take a dainty bite from a chicken breast, then moaned and put it back on the platter. She rubbed her hand up and down her torso and batted her eyelids coquettishly. “Mmm, this breast is the
This week: The queens create ads for RuPaul products! Watch Draco sell fried chicken. Really, this is quality entertaintment.
The queens chitchatted amongst themselves for a few minutes before they were interrupted suddenly by the large television screen hanging on one wall. RuPaul’s voice was heard calling out an odd phrase that made no sense to Draco’s ears as they all turned to the screen for the message.
Draco snorted. “Right. I’ll have you know that I learned a lot in those months. I’m sure you’ll never be able to catch up with my level of wisdom.” He could hold his own in this conversation.
Venus, however, proved to be a very experienced performer, and literally danced circles around Carmelita, who stood in one place and gesticulated wildly in several directions. Carmelita went home.
“Pretty soon Venus and Draco are the last ones left, and they’re spinning around, bouncing through the air and it’s like some fierce lip sync gymnastics without the music....or the lip syncing,” Steve added.
“I did,” Draco confessed, “But I’m the only one serving ‘Red Carpet Realness’ on this runway. I don’t know
She shook her head. “This book covers a broad range of topics, but none of them in much depth. I don’t see anything in here that would help troubleshoot the ritual. The ritual itself is all the troubleshooting the author can offer for dealing with a ghost in the first place.”
“Oh, right!” Blaise held up the newspaper he had brought with him. “I thought you might want to see this.
“The one with the bird. Blue and white.” Draco got up and paced the living room floor. Mispronunciation aside, Harry grew up around muggles. He had a phone
“So then Draco says, ‘What were you expecting, rose petals for the Bloody Savior?’” Harry addressed their audience again, this time doing an impression of a patented Draco Malfoy sneer. Draco snorted.
Draco blinked. Millicent had been in Draco's year in Slytherin when they were at Hogwarts. She had never quite blended in with the other Slytherin girls, who sometimes bullied her for being more "butch" than the rest. But she had always got on well enough with Draco, and the two of them had even dated briefly during second year, before either of them had fully sorted out their respective orientations.
Courtney stood up and positioned herself as requested. “Go on and give a good mug while I position myself next to you,” Draco continued. “Whatever you do, keep your eyes on the camera.”
“Now, since Steve and Intoxia won the mini challenge, you will serve as team leaders and pick the teammates for your cooking shows.”
Draco’s Doric chiton concept isn’t entirely bullshit. The historical version would have been a much bigger rectangle that wrapped around the body and was held together at the shoulder and with a belt. This site helpfully gives a little history and a picture of how it would have looked: http://fashionteach.blogspot.com/2014/06/chiton-dress16.html Of course, Draco’s version has a halter top, only covers the front, and is a LOT shorter! That’s “couture,” right? ;-) (Her hair is similar, too -- but much bigger, of course!)
“Well, that was unexpected,” Mike said. “Draco certainly knows how to use her body to play to the camera, and how to get a model to react a certain way,” he explained tactfully. “Although I’m not sure Courtney Act appreciated it.”
“Paris and Goldie, definitely,” Venus decided. “Did you see Goldie’s Anime Statue of Liberty? That was
!” Draco as Cher cried with her hands on her hips, just as she had practiced with Venus. She continued to lip sync as she sauntered over to the pole for her solo. “She is like a total Monet. She looks fine from a distance, but up close she’s a real mess,” Draco curled her lip as she mouthed the words.
“Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!” Draco jumped up and down and waved her arm in the air harder than Hermione Granger. “Let me use the wand!”
“Yeah,” Lady Cakes agreed. “I'm not gonna tell you what to do, but I think there’s a lot you can do to make him funny. Venus, who are you playing?”
Harry scrolled through the messages anyway. “Lots of photos of blokes holding up twenty-pound notes,” he said, making a face, then looked appraisingly at a dick pic.
“If I get sent home for being too nice, I’ll be like, ‘Curse you bitches!’” He shook his fist in the air.
magic in front of a muggle audience. And I’ve been allowed to use magic in my hotel room or in the case of a
Stays are what most people think of when they think of historical corsets. Aunt Aura’s been around since the late 1500s...though please don’t ask about the logistics of a ghost feeling like her corset’s too tight. Um...maybe ghosts have phantom feelings? That’s a lot more world-building than I planned for this fic, but I’m curious to know what you think. Let me know in the comments!
Harry looked thoughtfully at his husband. “What would you have done, if it hadn’t worked out between us?”
“Holy shit, Draco,” Intoxia breathed after a few moments of silence. He had apparently sobered quickly during the encounter. “You get points in intimidation for that.”
“Ivana Mann, Kali Sister, and Goldie Hanako, you will create an ad for ShadyRu, my new line of designer sunglasses.” He pointed to a tray of sunglasses on the third tray.
Previously on DDR: Draco plays Umbridge at the Viewing Party, Mary Berry in the Snatch Game, and a broken antique doll named Aethelwynne in the cosplay runway challenge. He wins the mini challenge because playing seeker on a quidditch team is apparently great training for dodgeball. Kali Sister learns that accents are hard.
Draco sipped her cocktail. Maybe Kali had been desperate for help. That still didn’t give her the right to ask for a favor the way she had.
“Okay, okay, we’re going to go now,” the bystanding friend interjected, looking between Draco and the nine other queens in their party and apparently deciding the fight wasn’t worth it. He grabbed his friend by the shoulders and swiveling him around. “Sorry, folks. He’s drunk and gonna sleep this off. Enjoy the rest of your evening!” And with that, the two men turned and walked away, leaving the queens alone.
to even go to his own hearing. He’d probably have to accept defeat and sashay away in the next challenge.
The Quartet of Sorceresses, as they called themselves, made for passable entertainment. Lady Cakes and Venus stood out, working the crowd and getting as many laughs as they could with their shtick in between tricks. Lorena and Kali struggled somewhat, their nerves showing. There were a few awkward pauses as they fumbled to get Lorena to appear from behind a large curtain.
“You are all safe,” RuPaul told them. Paris sighed in relief. “You may leave the stage.” Paris, Goldie, and Steve left the stage.
With that, Scorpius was off. Draco snuck into the Charms section and pushed past a woman who was trying to look at first-year books while managing three squirrelly toddlers.
“All right, just between us squirrel friends, what do you think of Draco’s performance?" RuPaul asked the other judges.
“All muggle tricks.” Draco didn’t have to look at Harry to know he had a smug look on his face. Draco watched the rest of the show with rapt attention. Two of the queens were told to “lip sync” — which he soon learned meant that they pretended to sing a song performed by a woman — or apparently face certain death. Well, not death so much as one of them was kicked off the show at the end of the episode, as it turned out.
Lady Cakes laughed again. “Ooh, this gives me an idea,” she looked thoughtful and tapped her pen again. “Hold on, Lorena, what were you about to say?”
“I believe, we got to keep it sexy! I’m here to say, we can bring America to a beautiful love if we come and share peace and work to make it happen. Vote for Lorena Gucci!” She flashed a wobbly smile. The judges looked unimpressed.
“Welcome back to Smells Like Fish!” Acacia said. “I’m here with Draco, who’s going to show us how to get rid of a pesky hangover.” Draco smiled at the camera and waved. “Now, what have you got for us?”
“I was apprehensive at first, because we hadn’t gotten along at all when we were in school,” Draco added. He looked down at their joined hands. “But I understood some of what you were going through. And I was just as lonely, all by myself in this giant manor.” he gestured with his free hand at the walls around them.
I’m adding a tag for chicken fellatio because I never expected to write such a phrase, and now that it’s out there, I have a chaotic-neutral urge to tag it just to see what happens, LOL. If you clicked on this fic because of chicken fellatio, was it everything you hoped it would be?
Crabbe, for his part, gave her a considering look, then smiled. It was the most genuine smile Draco had ever seen on his face. “Really?”
Back in the werkroom, the queens sat in their teams and brainstormed ideas for selling their products.
Venus shook his head in resignation. “Just when I thought it couldn’t get worse,” he said, “we go and get
“Well, if you can’t be relatable, you can always embrace the weirdness,” Bianca advised. “People love a weirdo. That’s how Tammie Brown still gets work.”
“Ladies, I have made my decision,” RuPaul said. “Lady Cakes, chanté, you stay. You may join the other girls.” Lady Cakes held up her hands in prayer and nodded. She hugged Steve, then walked to the back of the stage and grabbed Goldie’s extended hand.
“What does the chicken do?” Moaning Myrtle asked in Draco’s ear. He jumped, not having realized she had joined them in the room.
Basil made a very subtle movement with his wand barely poking out of his sleeve, and Draco’s mic shorted out, giving them an excuse to talk without being recorded.
Goldie appeared shaken by the way Venus was cut off. Her hands shook slightly as she said, “G-good evening, America, I am Goldie Hanako, and I’m here representing — I mean, I’m running for president, a-and my slogan is, ‘Give Our Country a Makeover.’”
“I don’t know why you feel like you have to go with me,” Scorpius complained, huffing his too-long, too-purple fringe out of his eyes. “I’m of age now. I can pick up all my stuff on my own.”
“Two queens stand before me,” RuPaul said to Lorena and Kali. “Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me and save yourself from elimination. The time has come for you to lip sync for your life! Now, good luck, and don’t fuck it up!”
Potter appeared thoughtful. “He wasn’t my favorite person, but if you want, I’m in. Who knows, it could be fun, right? Hermione, Ron, what do you think?”
“Great. Enjoy your stay,” she finished in her bored voice, then looked back to the line. “I can help who’s next!”
“It doesn’t have to be a bunch of knock-knock jokes,” Bianca said. “You could get up there and tell a story. Talk about something we all can relate to.”
He took it back. Muggle culture was every bit as horrifying as he’d been taught. As Dave helped him take his luggage up to the hotel doors, Draco reminded himself that he had made a commitment to this adventure. Harry had warned him it wouldn’t be easy. But Draco was determined. He could
After watching the losing queen write something on a mirror with lipstick and cry at the camera while clutching a figurine in a long-clawed hand, Draco turned back to Harry. “Are there any more episodes of this?”
Now, however, nothing seemed to matter. Draco was no longer a Malfoy. It was impossible to think past that.
I know, and I’m still relatively an unknown around these queens,” he admitted. “And I still have some work to do before they get to know me and just what I’m capable of.”
“Draco, you’re getting the choreography, but you look a little stiff,” Todric told him. “Just be sure to put some stank on it.”
“Very well,” Draco said, taking out the supply list to plan his strategy for the quickest possible gathering of books. “Meet me at the register in five minutes.”
Of all the people to lurk behind a book, Potter was the last person Draco wanted to find. He harrumphed and rubbed at the bump forming on his head as he put the puberty book back on the shelf.
— or at least, we would have if his punches didn’t pass through…” he looked up at a corner of the ceiling as if it could finish his sentence for him.
with no intentions of actually trying to win. His primary objective had been to get enough public attention to shame his father for disowning him. His presence on the muggle show alone was enough to accomplish that.
Draco’s eyes then searched the room. A few pub patrons shot her dirty looks, but more people kept their focus on the screen or away from her. She looked to see if the hooded figure from the previous week had come back. There they were, sitting in an otherwise empty corner, looking down.
Harry must have navigated to the right screen for that, because his frown deepened. Draco’s panic increased.
She flipped to another page. “Under ‘Social Issues,’ you have ‘Woke (Adjective),’ ‘Talk-Sick Masculinity,’ ‘Cultural Approposition,’ and, um, what? ‘White Noise / White Privilege: are they related? How do they see sound?’”
“Hello, hello, hello!” RuPaul called as he entered the workroom wearing a neon green suit with neon pink polka dots and neon pink fedora.
Previously on DDR (if you haven’t been here in [gulp] a year): Draco starts as an inexperienced queen with a rocky relationship with her muggle colleagues and a social media noob and gradually learns as she goes, about drag, muggle culture, and finding family. She came to the show using her full name as revenge for being disowned, but Lucius took him to the Wizengamot and Draco lost all rights to the name Malfoy. Draco’s magical drag family expands to include 8-year-old Teddy and Harry Gryffindor (Millicent Bulstrode), as well as her original drag daughters, Araneus the Spider and Ursa Minor, the stuffed koala.
Draco hurried Goldie over to his own station and began applying makeup, trying not to take too much time. It was awkward; he had spent plenty of time practicing putting makeup on his own face, but had never put it on someone else’s. The angle was different and he struggled with the brushes.
“Oh, you’ll want Dunlap, there’s no one better,” Pendleton told him. “Except he died about a month ago. Terribly tragic, really.”
“Paris Davenport,” a short, Black queen with big honey-blonde hair and sequined gold gown held out her hand and gave Draco an assessing look. She gave Draco’s hand a firm pump. “So, where do you perform in the UK? I had a chance to see a show at The Glory in London a couple years ago and it was amazing.”
. Most of the book was utterly worthless, but there was a small section in the back on troubleshooting things that could go wrong with creating horcruxes — like when the person who had been killed in the process of creating a horcrux came back to haunt the creator. Apparently, there was a way to make the ghost go away without too much effort.
“We’ve already had Sahara Davenport and Brook Lynn Heights in toe shoes, and you not gonna wear toe shoes
All too soon, it was time for their performance on the main stage in front of the judges. Team Venus began their group choreography, dancing around each other in a circle and lip syncing to a song that made no sense to Draco. She only remembered her own lines and other queens’ lines when they served as her cues.
Draco and Harry had been sharing a table at the Bent Unicorn with the unlikely combination of Hermione Granger, Pansy Parkinson, Millicent Bulstrode, Blaise Zabini, and Ron Weasley. The girls all cracked up into uncontrollable giggles. Harry’s jaw had hit the floor and he looked at Draco with surprise.
Harry puffed out his chest in pride. “Thanks, Bulstrode! I admit I was a bit nervous at first about making pâte à choux, but it was a lot easier than I’d expected.”
Moving out of the splits, she crawled toward the front of the stage on her hands and knees, fixing the judges a heated gaze. She reached one hand out in front of her, undulating her rib cage until her entire body appeared to writhe sensually.
Draco watched as one by one, drag queens strutted down a runway and showed off elaborate outfits. “So, it’s a fashion show, then?”
“‘Sorry Carrie!’” Steve Donovan read from Intoxia’s lipstick message on the mirror. “‘Best luck to all of you, xoxo Intoxia. PS Kim Cardassian 4evah!’”
“What is this about, anyway?” He asked apprehensively as they walked down the hall. He already suspected it had to do with his hearing.
If Lady Cakes couldn’t use either of her wrists in the next challenge, she’d definitely be sent home.
“Right,” Draco began uneasily. He knew he would have to face the issue of his blunder in the last challenge eventually. He just wished it didn’t have to be before six in the morning. The sun was barely over the horizon of the smoggy Los Angeles sky. He hadn’t even had his first cup of tea of the day.
“Michelle, I disagree!” Ross argued. “Draco, you’re looking the most confident I’ve ever seen you on the runway.”
“The library is permanently closed!” RuPaul concluded. “All right ladies, good job — but I think we have a winner...Draco!”
Draco eyed the device apprehensively. After some hesitation, he very carefully placed his finger on the lock screen as if he might get burned in the process.
What was the most striking about her look, however, was her makeup. She had painted her face an almost white shade with pink circles on her cheeks and tiny lips. Her left eye was transfigured entirely black. A large black gash was painted across her face, from her left temple, down through the black eye, across her nose — which was largely missing, painted as a larger black hole —  and across the other cheek, ending at the back of her jaw.
“But rectangles are so important to our society,” Draco said in her defense. “People spend so much of their days looking at rectangles — on their phones, on their computers, on their tellys. And now they’re going to watch
“We’re going to play...Dodgeball!” A few queens looked horrified. “Now, the object of the game is to avoid getting hit by flying balls. The last queen left standing wins!” With that, he threw the ball up in the air and got out of the way.
Draco waved his hands and stood up, walking away from the vanity. He paced back and forth, his kimono swishing rapidly as he tried to calm down.
Well, let’s be honest. The Malfoy name hadn’t garnered that much respect since before the war. And there was the other matter that Draco preferred not to think about too often; he couldn’t claim to be part of that family anymore. But he still hadn’t been prepared for a muggle who barely knew her to make her feel so inconsequential.
Harry huffed and went back to patrolling the pub. Draco couldn’t worry about what people might think at the moment. The episode was already recorded and the wizarding world was going to find out how far the magic would go, as stoppable as a train.
Lorena narrowed her eyes and opened her mouth as if she were about to say something, but she was cut off.
For the purpose of this fic, we’re just going to pretend that Drag Race UK doesn’t exist and the timeline of the Harry Potter series is more recent than the ‘90s.
“Carmelita,” RuPaul addressed her, “I’m sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination.” Carmelita nodded stiffly, fighting a grimace.
“Okay, then. Now, it’s time to meet the Queen of the Air herself, Amelia Earhart!” Venus-as-Amelia-Earhart waved.
“Rude!” Professor Burbage cried, wagging her finger. “Ten points from Slytherin.” The spectral pair flew right through him and flounced out of the room (as much as ghosts could flounce, anyway), leaving Draco shuddering and alone again.
Of course, since it was dark, there wasn’t much to see. Draco sighed. “What is it, Potter? You look like you want to ask something; might as well get on with it.”
“Steve Donovan, I’m sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination.” Steve’s lower lip wobbled as she nodded.
Draco stopped and blinked, mouth open. “Er — well,” she floundered. Once again, it seemed Draco’s mouth had run off without letting her brain catch up first. Would RuPaul send her home for talking back to Michelle Visage?
As the instrumental of the song’s opening bars played through, Draco pulled a folded-up piece of parchment from her bra. She unfolded it and raised it to her lips, kissing it near the bottom, before lowering it and gazing reverently at it. She sighed. She looked up to the judges in time to lip sync the first few words.
The next morning, Harry returned to Malfoy’s office and handed him a stack of forms. Malfoy frowned.
Draco looked back and forth as the other queens joined arms. These popularity contests were starting to wear thin on her.
Draco pursed her lips and nodded, mentally reviewing the lyrics for the lip sync number while RuPaul explained to both Queenie and Carmelita why their outfits were both horrible. Both queens held their breath while RuPaul milked the moment for as much dramatic tension as possible.
“I confess I’ve never really spent time around smokers before,” Draco admitted. “Though I’ve heard all about how it’s supposed to be bad for one’s health. If I’m not too bold, may I ask, why start in the first place?”
“Now, our Rusical will be divided into two acts,” RuPaul told them. “Team Paris will portray iconic sheroes of films from the 1980s. Team Venus, you will portray iconic sheroes from the ‘90s.” Several queens snapped excitedly. Draco went along with it.
“Never mind, you’ve at least got the right forms today,” Malfoy continued, he eyes focused on the papers in front of him. “Well, well,” he said, holding up the Gringotts form. “Three million, two hundred eighty-seven thousand, five hundred and twenty-three galleons to your name.
Potter laughed and sat down on one end of the potato. “Hmm, it’s at least soft. It must be baked,” he said, then patted the other end like a sofa cushion. “Well, sit down.”
“I just wanted to apologize for yesterday,” Kali said quietly. “I was thinking about it last night. My aunt always tells us that we can’t talk about her being a witch because it has to be a secret. I guess there are laws about not doing magic where people can see, huh?” He ran a hand through his long hair and nervously wrapped it into a sloppy bun.
“I’ll do what I gotta do to get in the Top Four,” Acacia said. “Keep ‘em comin’ — I’ll lip sync against anyone!”
Draco, meanwhile, was staring intently at his wardrobe rack. Cosplay was not a look he felt very confident about, even though he had known about the challenge before coming on the show and had had time to prepare in advance.
Once the microphone lesson was squared away, Draco ran through his entire routine and got some pointers on content and delivery before the time was up. Draco thanked him and went back to the workroom.
“BAM! These bitches are killin’ it!” Venus exclaimed. “They both look like they jumped out of some World War II dance party, but with, like, five hundred percent more shablams and swiffering the stage with their taints. And I’m thinking, I don’t know who’s gonna win this lip sync. This is really close!”
Draco and the aggressive man stared at each other, neither backing down. Draco raised an eyebrow at him questioningly. He had his wand in the holster up his sleeve, and he had practiced using it with his other hand through the fabric of his shirt. He wouldn’t even need to get it out to make the idiot regret it. He could plant his hand on the man’s chest and fire a stinging hex without anyone seeing a visible trail of magic. He braced himself to do just that as the bigot started to raise his fist.
“Crabbe,” Draco answered, then stopped and gathered his resolve. “He’s a ghost now, but he wants to move on.”
a life debt after this,” he muttered so faintly Harry wasn’t entirely sure if he had heard it or just imagined it.
, he saw that it was time to get out of bed. He stumbled over to his wardrobe, slipped into his favorite dressing gown, and stumbled down the stairs to the kitchen to fix a cup of tea and toast.
“No time,” Venus replied. “Come on, ladies, let’s all do one last run-through before we go on stage!”
Then there was his understanding of muggle culture, which had undergone a similar metamorphosis. He was realizing now that he had entered the competition without any real awareness, diving headfirst into a deep ocean of drag culture that was incredibly referential. Queens didn’t just make passing references to queens and goings-on from previous seasons of
Draco tossed and turned in bed that night. His mind kept reminding him of the countless times Lucius had disapproved of him.
“Taxes?” Pendleton scratched his head after handing Harry a cuppa. He had thinning grey hair and looked to be in his eighties. He at least seemed kinder and more patient than Woodletter, Harry thought.
“Paris Davenport, condragulations! You are the winner of this week’s challenge,” RuPaul told her. Paris cried into her Sphinx paws in her joy. “You have won an all-expenses-paid Caribbean cruise through Gayze Abroad Travel Company.”
“I haven’t won any challenges since Week One!” Goldie lamented. “I feel like I’m giving the judges everything I can, and yet it’s still not enough, you know?”
“Yes, silly!” Mariah laughed again. “Anyway, I can help you get those set up, but it will be best if you can learn to manage your own presence online. And a royalty check came in for you this morning. Dean converted it to galleons before leaving for his lunch break. He was going to send an owl this afternoon, but as long as you’re here—” She opened a drawer and pulled out two pieces of muggle paper and a bag of coins.
“I look across the room at the other team because they’re all very quiet, and I see they have all the queens with no talent,” Lorena smirked. “They got a look queen, a fashion queen, and...whatever the hell Draco is supposed to be. I don’t even know why that bitch is still here. I mean, what can they bring to this challenge?”
“Everyone else here has a real concept for their cosplay look,” Intoxia said. She pointed at each of the queens in the room. “Lady Cakes is Wonder Woman, Venus is Carmen Sandiego, Lorena is Sofia Vergara’s character from
“I think I remember hearing about something like that,” Draco told Millicent. “RuPaul used to have a programme where they brought in
“I wanna be the hostess.” The team looked at Acacia in surprise. “You know, like on TV when they bring in a guest chef who shows the TV host how to cook something? That way, we can play off each other and not be on our own in front of the camera.”
“Ms. Flygirl, what experiences from your past make you qualified to be America’s first drag president?”
Draco nodded. She knew all too well what Lucius was like. He didn’t need legal counsel to make his wife’s home life unbearable if he didn’t approve of her behaviour.
Lady Cakes looked heavenward. “Come for me, Jesus!” He laughed. “Everyone knows the big girls just gonna struggle through these physical challenges. I’m worried enough about this pole crashing down on me that it’s hard to process the moves they’re telling me to do.”
Other queens’ looks were a little more varied. Lorena had constructed a dress that looked like the Eiffel Tower. Venus took a risk on the Christ the Redeemer statue, genderbending the otherwise masculine look with over-the-top makeup, hair, nails, and a sequined white robe. Ivana had attempted to portray a wonder of the natural world by creating a dress inspired by the Aurora Borealis, but the execution left something to be desired. The result was a dark blue tube-shaped dress upon which she had painted swirls of green and purple, paired with an emerald green wig.
When they reached the seventh-floor corridor with the painting of Sir Cadogan, they found Moaning Myrtle hovering in front of them with her arms folded over her chest.
comics. Karen had always fascinated him because she worked in something called “Finance” and kept a tiny dog in a purse. But he knew he couldn’t explain that away on muggle television.
Potter actually laughed. “Yeah, keep telling yourself that, Malfoy.” Merlin, was it Draco’s imagination, or were they actually
Out of the corner of her eye, Draco could see Herb Kong standing on the side of the set and raising a warning eyebrow, but she didn’t care. The challenge was to give the judges a witch, and Draco was going to deliver the look. She wasn’t stupid enough to actually fly on her broom or use her wand as anything other than a prop.
When it was her turn, Draco gracefully glided down the runway. Her ball gown was strapless in a shade of sky-blue satin patterned with white crystals and a full-circle skirt in grass-green crepe. Her wig was fashioned into rosebud-braid buns at the back of her head accented with small crystals, but what really stood out on her head was the large golden headband with beams radiating outward in a halo like a sunburst. It, too, was decorated with crystals to give it extra shine.
Lady Cakes groaned and flopped onto Draco’s bed. The mattress quaked underneath him. “Ugh, I really wish they’d let us keep our phones so we could just Uber instead!”
That was a partial truth. Draco was also suspecting that he may have to adjust his attitude in order to form a working relationship with the other queens, but he was far from ready to admit that yet.
Draco looked up. Sure enough, Crabbe was floating in place above the center of the circle. “Oh, bugger.”
Crabbe gestured over towards Moaning Myrtle, who was watching the scene as if she only needed a bucket of popcorn to be fully entertained by this sudden argument.
“Paint me like one of your French girls!” Intoxia lip synced, and launched into her pole dancing solo. It looked like a struggle, as she was wearing a tight ankle-length dress and a large, floppy hat.

“The Ministry owls the L-539 forms to all employees with exact figures for gross annual wages,” Malfoy explained, slowly and carefully as if Harry were the dumbest creature he’d ever met. “Gringotts owls the 4187-DFW forms with information on interest earned on your vault, and the 4817-WFD forms to indicate interest on landholdings. All of these forms would have been sent on lavender-colored parchment in February.”
Draco remembered being in Sixth Year and privately wondering if the prophecy meant he was destined to fall in love with Moaning Myrtle.
find those when I was searching for the ink,” he confessed. “But I tend to think better with a quill anyway, so I thought this might help.”
“W-what betting pool?” Draco asked, thrown off balance by Nott’s heavy arm slung over his shoulder. That, and the fact that all the hair on Nott’s head had mysteriously migrated from his scalp to his chin since Draco had last seen him.
Getting through another year of school after his Death Eater trial had been gruelling enough. The idea of reuniting with everyone who had made that experience gruelling was as enticing as dancing barefoot on broken glass.
“Condragulations, girls,” RuPaul told the remaining queens. “You are all one step closer to becoming America’s next drag superstar. And remember — if you can’t love yourself, how in the hell are you gonna love someone else? Can I get an Amen!”
Reactions to Draco’s magic performance were mixed. Several people in the audience cheered; a few even catcalled.
The worst comment, by far, suggested that Draco’s attempt at Grecian couture made her look like the world’s worst-dressed house elf.
" captures the idea of the spell as it should have happened rather than what actually happened, so we can blame the failure on the room not working or other external factors. I did like the idea of reigniting/extinguishing as it seems to fit with the metaphor of lighting a candle and blowing it out again. ;-)
“And we did share a certain amount of...enmity back in our day,” Potter added. His face was awfully close.
“She’s the least experienced, and has no fucking clue about anything,” Carmelita explained, sending Draco a disgusted look. “She needs to just go back to Planet Draco or wherever—”
to do is focus on giving the judges what they ask for rather instead of thinking so hard about someone else.”
“Right,” Malfoy said, schooling his features into professional indifference. “Show me your L-539, 4187-DFW, and 4817-WFD forms. Maybe I can make heads or tails of them.”
Draco returned the hug, a little unsure how to react to the amount of emotion the other queen was showing. He had never been very accustomed to shows of affection in general.
Draco watched as the others hurried to comfort the forlorn queen. He had never been a part of any group that would have shown that kind of support, and he wasn’t sure what to do with it.
“Really?!” she scoffed, cutting him off. “You thought you were going to, what, just magically pull four suitcases worth of stuff out of just one piece, and hope the no-mags wouldn’t notice?” She clucked her tongue and shook her head. “NMCS doesn’t cover that. You’re gonna have to transfigure three more suitcases and repack your baggage before I can stamp you through.”
“Next, add a gram of powdered nutmeg, three diced asphodel leaves, one egg, twelve medium-length dog hairs, and seven millilitres of dittany extract.”
Harry didn’t share that problem. He leaned forward and kissed her, lips expressing the passion more than words. Draco responded eagerly.
Later on, Draco walked onto the recording set with Lorena and Lady Cakes. They were each dressed in matching black corsets and knickers, fishnet stockings, heels, and blonde wigs in chin-length starlet curls.
“Rise and shine, bitches!” Lorena, Venus, Kali, and Paris skipped into the workroom the next morning. Draco led a giggling Goldie in a waltz. Lady Cakes trailed behind them and shook her head.
“Oooh! Everybody, shush! We’re getting a message!” Ivana exclaimed suddenly as filming assistants wheeled a large screen into the lounge. All conversation was forgotten as Carmelita received a recorded video message from her parents. Draco tuned it out, knowing she would never get such a message herself.
“Damn, we’re only into the second week and already, the bitches are coming for each other!” Carmelita made a face. “I’m not so sure Kali didn’t step on my toes on purpose. If she does it again, I think my foot’s gonna accidentally come in contact with her shin.”
“Okay, don’t take this personally,” Venus began diplomatically, “But just based on the critiques, I think it’s gonna be Kali, and either Intoxia or Lorena.”
Draco was able to finish this proclamation just as the yellow light dimmed and the red light flashed.
Draco raised a painted eyebrow. “Be glad I didn’t lip sync,” she replied. “I would have danced circles around you, literally.”
From this perspective, it was possible to see both looks simultaneously. The high collars on either side met in a diamond clasp at the center of the neck. The hair was parted down the middle, the chignon wig only covering the right side. Down the center of the chest was a heart, as a cut-out half-heart showing skin on the gown side and a half-heart-shaped lapel on the left side that revealed a white tuxedo shirt underneath. The rest of the outfit met in a smooth seam down the middle of the torso before dividing between the trouser leg and the skirt.
anymore, so she has a bit more time to indulge in a favourite hobby,” Draco replied, lifting his hand up to his mouth to pantomime taking a drink. Kali muttered again.
Draco shrugged and wrote it down, though she kept in in quotes. Muggles, thinking they were magical! Draco imagined Batty Auntie Bella rolling over in her grave at the notion. Her smirk widened into a broad grin.
“Where I come from, you don’t mix drag and politics,” Goldie said, applying a glittery blue eyeliner. “People go to drag shows ‘cuz they want to have a good time and forget everything else.”
. He had been helping his competitors more than he would have expected. It forced him to wonder if he was losing his strategic, Slytherin edge.
Suddenly overcome by a feeling of kinship, Draco lifted the spider closer to his face and smirked. “I shall make you my drag daughter,” he told it, “And I shall call you Araneus.”
What ensued could only be described as pure chaos. The Pit Crew threw large, soft balls that bounced off queens with a dull “
Draco darted his eyes around the living room, as if expecting the drapes to suddenly catch fire, and whipped out his wand in preparation to cast
Acacia led Draco back to the kitchen set and turned off the burner. “Good god, get it together, girl.”
“‘Be strong,’” Kali Sister read on the mirror, “‘I love you. Don’t give up!’” Aww. Isn’t she the sweetest? I can’t wait to see her again.”
Draco lifted his box lid with a sense of dread. Inside was maybe half a yard of gauzy white fabric, a small spool of gold cord, a stuffed koala, and a small Australian flag the size of Draco’s palm. There was also a small note at the bottom:
“Ha, ha,” Draco said. “It’s a prop. I just haven’t decided if I’m using it in a challenge yet. Well, I’m ready. Are we going, or are we just going to sit around and talk about sticks?”
Cries of frustration filled the room at the Bent Unicorn. Draco looked around the pub, surprised to see it so full. She recognized several faces from Hogwarts, most of whom she never would have guessed would come out to support her. It must have been due to the hype created by
“Paris, you have won a two-thousand-dollar cash prize, and the right to display one of your favorite drag looks in ‘The Art of Drag,’ a new exhibit on drag culture in the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C.,” RuPaul continued. Paris squealed.
Goyle had joined their little table at the viewing party and flashed Draco a wicked grin. Draco grinned back and they exchanged the secret Slytherin handshake. It felt good to be reminded of old times, back when they owned Hogwarts.
“The sisters of Alpha Beta Gamma Omega Zeta Jones!” they chimed in unison. The audience clapped appreciatively as they each struck a pose.
“Draco,” one of the production assistants called while Draco was applying makeup in preparation for filming the cooking challenge. He looked up. “Can you come with me, please?”
“Sorry, that’s not a match,” RuPaul continued. Draco-as-Mary-Berry shrugged and drained the last of her wine.
In truth, they hadn’t missed much. Steve went on after Draco and struggled horribly. She had attempted a song-and-dance gimmick, tap-dancing around the stage with silly facial expressions that didn’t read as funny so much as it was bizarrely avant-garde. Sadly, the funniest part of her performance was when she accidentally slipped on Lorena’s banana peel and fell on her arse.
Eventually, it was time for the queens to arrive on the set for Snatch Game. Draco mentally compartmentalized her nerves as she set up her prop and made final adjustments to her appearance. Finally, the real celebrities entered the set and took their places, and the show began. A trumpet fanfare started playing as the queens were instructed to wave at the camera.
Draco tried a few positions with Courtney sitting together on the fainting couch, then standing pressed against each other. Draco started to get the impression that the other queen was getting restless with Draco’s ideas.
“Acacia Davenport, you are a queen who knows how to serve a heated look, but this week, your performance was...undercooked. I’m sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination.” Acacia nodded and sniffled into her glove.
“I’m gonna choose my Davenport sister, Acacia,” Paris announced. Acacia shimmied in delight and sauntered over to Paris.
Goyle snorted. Draco shot him a quelling look. Well. Maybe if Potter could pretend that Draco hasn’t just made an arse of himself, Draco could pretend, too.
As a woman, Millicent Bulstrode was tall and had a very sturdy-looking build. As a drag king, he resembled an eighteen-year-old boy. He unclasped his cloak to reveal a flattened chest covered by a white button-down shirt with a red and gold tie. He added a pair of round glasses, then turned back to the mirror and transfigured a lighting-bolt scar on his forehead.
When she got to the end of the runway, Draco removed the cords from her belt and lifted the henge up to waist height. She began to spin, moving faster and faster until the skirt rose up into a rippling field of green perpendicular to her body. Underneath was now visible a pair of nude pumps and a flawless tuck.
Draco went to the end of the line and pulled the tiny, shrunken suitcase out of his pocket. He set it on the floor next to him and pulled out his wand, then cast the spell to bring it back to its full size. He then pulled out his passport and waited in line as two more wizards filed in line behind him.
Draco sputtered, then laughed. “All right, bring it on!” She picked up another handful of cake, this time flinging it more specifically into Courtney’s blonde wig.
“This week, you will all be serving us your best jokes in a stand-up routine before a live audience!”
Draco’s been able to stay on just the right side of the Statute of Secrecy so far, though his performance has rankled a lot of wixen, including one who threatened to retaliate if he slips in a future episode. Harry and Ron have started monitoring the viewing parties for signs of trouble. Harry is also training for an audition for The Great British Bakeoff with help from Draco and Millicent. Heather Villareal, the LA auror assigned to watch him on the set, has mysteriously left the auror force and was replaced by Herb Kong.
in exchange for keeping their secrets. It was blackmail, pure and simple, and it threatened everything.
Paris had chosen the Sphinx and made a glittering gold dress with paw-shaped mittens, a tail, and a lavish headdress. She had even styled her makeup to look like a chunk had been taken out of her nose. Lady Cakes had similarly gone for an Egyptian look, but designed a pyramid-shaped dress that flared out from her neck.
“Is that really the camera?” Draco gasped at the all-too-familiar voice. “Oh! How novel!” Draco clasped both hands over her mouth as she stared at the screen in shock.
“Look at my eyes, Harry,” Draco said. The girls giggled. Such was the side effect of wearing snakes around a Parselmouth boyfriend.
had apparently figured out how to watch the episode online. The next morning’s edition of the paper subsequently had a write-up about Draco’s role in the episode on Page 2, featuring an animated photo of her now-infamous airborne double flip in the lip sync.
After a commercial break, it was time for the judges’ critiques. One by one, the judges picked apart each queen’s performance and red carpet look. As the team leader, Venus was judged harshly for some of the other queens’ lackluster performances, supposedly due to her casting decisions, which Draco thought was a bit much. Her dancing had been on point, but her lip sync had failed.
“I wanted to ask you a drag-related question,” Millicent said as she claimed one of the stools next to the vanity. Granger leaned against the wall by the door. “And you were busy dolling yourself up, so I saw Granger and thought maybe she would know, since it’s a muggle thing.”
“Do you remember when you first started to think you might be falling in love with me?” Draco asked.
“Hello, hello, hello!” RuPaul stepped into the workroom, dressed in a three-piece suit patterned with muggle street signs.
Draco’s read of Paris: “A Davenport is meant to be sat on, but if your lady bits are burning, I’m afraid of catching a disease.” [The lady bits are a reference to Notre Dame, which burned recently, haha? It's too soon, right? Yes, this one was a bit of a reach, and probably in poor taste. ;-) My French is terrible, so please excuse any weirdness Google Translate might have brought to this mix.]
; he had slipped it into her suitcase before leaving London. Draco’s lipstick was now printed at the bottom next to Harry’s signature.
I’m sure the wizarding world has its own unique measuring system, but really, I think the metric system is just as mystical to a lot of Americans. ;-)
“Being in the bottom really is a mindfuck,” Kali Sister said. “I didn’t realize how much it would mess with me the way it did.”
Harry, who had stopped by Draco’s table for a moment as Ron Weasley watched over the room, suddenly let out a loud guffaw. “That’s the second time you’ve mentioned Ramsbottom on this show,” he whispered in Draco’s ear. “Should we plan a trip there?”
Seven-year-old Teddy Lupin twirled around Draco’s “drag room” at Number Twelve Grimmauld Place while Draco transfigured longer, thicker eyelashes at the vanity.
“I was actually quite capable of dressing up,” Harry sniffed, addressing the kids rather than his husband. “But as I was saying, I’d never seen Draco without shoes on, ever, even when we were sitting around the house. And I realized that I liked it.” He grinned.
“You know you gotta be thirty-five to run for president, right?” Lady Cakes rebuffed. “That’s, like, fifty-seven in gay years.”
“This week, for your main challenge, you will be putting on a cooking show!” RuPaul informed them. “This is one of the classic formats of daytime television. Some of the great TV chefs like Julia Child, Paula Deen, and Rachel Ray have been teaching multiple generations of home cooks how to make delicious dishes.
Even then, he wasn’t sure he was in love, however. He wasn’t even sure he could be capable of love. What
“‘Goodbye and good luck,’” Goldie Hanako read aloud, “‘And stop resting on bitch face!’ –Ha ha, that must be her catchphrase,” she laughed.
“Well,” he said, finally, “I might have said something rude to her once or twice when we were younger.”
Malfoy shot him an irritated look that had no business being sexy. Harry cast that thought aside as quickly as he could. He really needed to put a damper on his libido if he was going to make it through this ordeal.
“Why Potter, what have we here?” Millicent paused in the act of changing into Harry Gryffindor’s Hogwarts uniform, looking at the food with hungry interest.
“As you can probably tell from my accent, I’m not from here,” she confided. “I’m from a bit further east. East Hollywood,” she clarified. A few people chuckled politely in the audience.
Goldie Hanako laughed. “Girl, she really did wanna get her money’s worth out of that prosthetic, didn’t she?”
“Gougères,” Harry answered, holding the tray out toward the drag king. “Savory choux pastries mixed with cheese. I added a dash of smoked paprika to make these a little more interesting.”
Draco stopped outside the door to the dining room and turned to face him. “I haven’t found a spell that will help you yet.”
After a moment, he finally sighed, collected himself, and cast a quick healing spell at his forehead before going back down to the Great Hall to rejoin the party.
“You haven’t been talking to Pansy, have you?” Zabini asked. He put one hand behind Draco’s back and steered him toward the bar, surreptitiously pulling a galleon out of his pocket and handing it to Nott, who walked away to where Goyle was talking with Daphne Greengrass and Millicent Bulstrode. They each gave Nott a coin, too, including Goyle, that traitor.
Potter attempted to school his features into seriousness. “You really thought you were destined to fall in love with Moaning Myrtle?” He said, trying to appear sympathetic only to dissolve into laughter again.
“Can you take me shopping in Soho tomorrow? There are some stores that sell makeup and pads and such that I’ll need. Also, I’ll need a muggle sewing machine. I need to know how to sew the muggle way. Do you suppose Granger knows how to use one?”
The queens clapped politely as the camera flashed to a still image of Lorena posing on the same set as Draco, but standing in front of the back wall, back-to-back with Season One queen Nina Flowers. In the workroom, Lorena put her hands up to her face and gave a joyful little curtsy.
Lady Cakes looked surprised, but then winked and pantomimed pulling a zipper across his lips. He didn’t ask about the owl, either, for which Draco was grateful.
“Baby Boomers have ruled our country for too damn long!” she bellowed, slamming her fist on the podium. Goldie and Kali jumped in surprise on either side of her. “So if you want a gerontocracy, why stop with the Boomers? Vote for Ol’ Lady Cakes McMansion and let the Greatest Generation take our country back.” She finished just as the light turned red.
Kali shed a few tears and nodded in gratitude before heading back. Lorena pursed her lips and blinked furiously. Draco breathed a sigh of relief.
She fixed the judges with an intense gaze and patented Malfoy sneer. This song called up memories of all those years at Hogwarts, years of want and hate mixed so deeply together it made her lip curl just to think about them. Could she identify with this song? Maybe.
“When I call your name, please step forward,” RuPaul instructed. “Intoxia Madison,” Intoxia stepped forward. “Paris Davenport,” Paris stepped forward. One by one, the others followed: Ivana Mann, Acacia Davenport, Kali Sister, Steve Donovan, Cindy Sanchez, Lorena Gucci.
“Any time someone gives me any problem on social media, I just RELEASE THE BEES!” She swept her arms dramatically. RuPaul laughed.
“No, I don’t think so. Anyway, that’s beside the point. How long have you known and you haven’t bloody told me?”
“Why, it’s one of my very own drag daughters from Season Seven and All Stars Season Two, Katya Zamolodchikova!”
“Oh my goodness, the stars are telling me that y’all are gifted with the second sight!” RuPaul announced after each queen had had her turn at the phone hotline. “I just hope our mystery caller kept the receipts. Do you wanna know who she is?”
“I was spending so much energy worrying about what would happen with this court case,” Draco said. “Losing the right to my name still hurts, but now that I’ve lived through it, I feel like I should have more focus on this competition. From now on, I’m looking forward and upward.”
Draco hesitated. He had only really included Teddy in his show because the boy had been so enthusiastic about it. And once he included the other performers he was lining up, it would turn into a long enough show without adding Millicent.
After a few more minutes of discussing the judges’ critiques, Steve left the group, her bottom lip quivering, and went over to a vanity and tore off her liberty crown. Draco didn’t feel like being a part of the larger discussion anymore, so she got up to talk to her instead.
Several queens ooh’ed and clapped their hands. Draco furrowed his brows, jaw dropped. Magic had never been a performance art in his understanding of the universe. Kali, the one queen who knew Draco was a wizard, shot him a look that implied that he wanted to be on Draco’s team for this challenge.
“Ay, dios mio, this is not how I wanted this to go!” Lorena lamented. “I’m not ready to be in the bottom two again. But Goldie is no match for me! I am going to turn. This. out.” He snapped his fingers.
“That’s not what the prophecy was about, and you know it,” Draco retorted. “Listen, Goyle, thanks for the talk, but I really should be going. I’ve been spending too much time in the Floo and it’s getting awfully warm now.”
Janet Jackson oohed and applauded. “I see, Stonehenge really does keep track of the time! When Draco’s on her knees, it must be solstice,” she said.
“I think we’re given this amazing platform on this show to speak up for what we believe in,” Paris responded. She rubbed contouring lines onto her cheek.
“Anyway, they seemed to buy the idea of a hangover remedy. And they weren’t surprised by the idea of potions and cauldrons, either — they just didn’t understand why I was talking about them when I didn’t dress to fit their idea of a witch.”
He had been loved by one or two women, Astoria and possibly Myrtle. It was true that he had since come to feel that he hadn’t really loved Myrtle back, but she had cared about him, at least, and Trelawney hadn’t specified that the love had to be reciprocated. That was it, then.
“You know, we have a box of pens over in the corner there,” RuPaul answered, pointing toward a shelf with office supplies.
The audience cheered. “Well done,” Harry wrapped his arms around her waist and whispered into her ear, “Now, I really want to take you home and get some
Sorry for the cliffhanger! That’s been part of my outline for this fic since the very beginning, so I’m not doing this as a way to end the fic early. I promise not to make you wait another year for the next chapter!
Draco smiled sheepishly. “You should still go easy on your wrists tonight,” he warned, still unsure whether the potion would completely heal muggle joints.
The choreographer pointed at Draco. “Ballroom, ballet, and English Set,” he responded. Venus said she knew ballet and hip-hop, which lit up Todric’s eyes.
“Welcome, ladies!” RuPaul addressed them. “The judges and I watched your cooking shows, and I’ve made some decisions. This week, you worked in teams, but tonight on the runway you will each be judged individually.
“I had to think about this for a while to figure out what that could be, and then I remembered how much Harry likes flying. And apparently there’s this thing that muggles came up with called the ‘Mile-High Club’ for when they get in their airplanes and have a bit of fun up in the air,” he explained.
Draco sighed and sat. “Maybe we’re starting a new trend in interior design. Do you suppose we could persuade every wizarding family in the country to want their very own vegetable-based furniture?”
Kali’s performance, on the other hand, was a hit. She worked the crowd, addressing individual people and reading them for filth to raucous laughter. She even roasted RuPaul and the other judges, which Draco thought took a lot of bollocks.
She found Ivana and Steve smoking just outside the back door. Ivana had a large jug balanced at a precarious angle on her head to mark her as an Aquarius. Steve, apparently a Libra, simply held a set of scales in the hand not holding a cigarette. They both casually waved at Draco in greeting.
“The Aurors were okay with it,” Draco rolled her eyes. Honestly, did anyone think they would all still be there to watch the episode if Draco had violated the Statute of Secrecy and been arrested in the US?
Potter grinned. “Hey, Hermione!” he yelled across the hall like an utter barbarian, waving his arm high over his head.
sometime after I got the tattoo,” Draco explained, “They were asking people to submit unusual sex stories.”
“You can do what you want,” Draco told him. He threw away the towel and crossed his arms. “I don’t need you to cover for me. You’ve had your memory modified once before, and it could happen again if you tell other people about it.”
Draco’s eyebrows raised and her jaw dropped. Lady Cakes clapped her hands together and Lorena jumped up and down, squealing with delight.
“Do you want to be?” Paprikah glared at him as she unzipped Draco’s dress and began to remove the mic that had been taped to her back.
“Keep telling yourself that, if you like.” Draco smirked and sat at his vanity. “Now, what were you meaning to show me when you came in?”
had mostly been favorable and brought in more witches and wizards to the viewing parties, which afforded Draco more bookings.
Later that day, Draco stood at a worktable, puzzling over the largesse of Courtney Act’s vengeance spread before him.
Draco later got swept up in the war and all thoughts of Myrtle were abandoned. He forgot all about the prophecy for many years afterwards.
“I tried wandering around for a while,” Crabbe continued. “There wasn’t much to do at Hogwarts, so I went to London for a bit. You know, to see the sights.”
The reads aimed at Draco turned out to be a mixed bag of false kindness and shots aimed at his looks.
“Just put it in the center of the circle, Goyle,” he said. Once Goyle had done so, Draco used his wand to light it.
“Let’s get the rest of your books,” Draco said to his son. “Nice chat, Potter.” He nodded briefly in acknowledgment and dashed out of the Charms aisle.
The ride to the studio and the werkroom chatter that day was uneventful as the rest of the queens quietly recovered from the previous night’s adventures.
Lorena turned to face the back of the set and wiggled her well padded derriere. She looked over her shoulder and said in a sexy voice, “Chicken butt!”
She threw her hands up over her head and launched herself forward, landing on her hands and pushing back up into a forward flip. What happened next may have to be chalked up to a combination of stress, determination, lack of sleep, and accidental magic.
“You’ll have to decide how and where you pose,” RuPaul explained. “Let’s do it! Choose your first position.”
“I was groomed for it,” Draco admitted, pausing with a lip liner pencil in her hand. “My father expected me to enter the Ministry someday, so I was trained in diplomacy, economics, and twelve other languages…” he drifted off, taken back to a simpler time in his childhood when he felt like he knew what life had in store for him. The conversation moved on to other topics as Draco reflected on that road not taken.
“Hello, hello, hello!” They turned and faced RuPaul as he descended the stairs into the workroom, this time wearing a two-piece suit in a lobster-print fabric.
“Draco, Draco, Draco,” Michelle shook her head. “Are you going to give us the same silhouette every week?”
The man — whom Draco now identified as “Dave” according to a little identification card with his face on it by the front window — frowned at him. “Don’t they have seatbelts in the UK?”
Acacia nodded once more before turning around and sashaying, stopping to get a giant hug from Paris before she left.
“That’s a shame. Doesn’t explain why you got so flustered just now.” Crabbe scrunched his face in thought, then pounded his fist into his other hand. “Wait! is this about the prophecy?”
Draco leaned forwards. He felt Potter’s breath intermingle with his own, a heady sensation. His eyes closed as their lips slowly met. It had been so long since he had last kissed someone that he felt incredibly awkward at first, but Potter sighed and kissed back, his arms reaching for Draco’s waist. Draco’s hands found their way into Potter’s ridiculously soft, messy hair.
“Thank you all,” she concluded, “You have been a superb audience. Do enjoy the rest of your evening!” With that, she sheathed the mic back into its stand and walked offstage, feeling confident about her performance.
“Maybe you should take up the pottery wheel,” Professor Burbage suggested one day when he was feeling particularly morose.
,” RuPaul repeated, making sure to emphasize the product placement for a makeup company Draco had never heard of before. The queens ooh’ed and ahh’ed appreciatively for Lorena’s good fortune.
Draco entered the runway wearing a tight khaki button-down shirt, matching shorts, high-heeled hiking boots, and a pith helmet. She held up a pair of binoculars and looked through them at the judges as she walked forward.
“Venus Flygirl, I’m sorry, but you are up for elimination.” Venus had a look of pained resignation on her face.
By the time RuPaul called them back to the other end of the room, Draco was dressed in a low-cut white dress and pumps with a short, curly blonde wig.
“This situation is far worse than I feared! Now you all need to settle down and respect my authority. I am a respectable witch from an ancient family. I’ll have you know that my third cousin is a pureblood!” The purebloods in the room laughed. Merlin, she even caught Granger chuckling at that one.
And then Potter almost killed him, and he thought he was going to become a ghost right there in Myrtle’s bathroom after all.
“Can you maybe play up the idea of cooking?” Michelle suggested. “We don’t need to see a step-by-step recipe if you can make us laugh.”
“There’s more, I’m afraid,” Simmons continued. “The prosecution argued that further confusion between the Malfoy name and your drag career necessitates a more...legal separation.”
“Well,” she continued. “Let’s get on with it, then. At least in this space, we won’t have much clutter getting in our way.”
“It’s been swell, but the swelling’s gone down,” Kali lip synced as Tank Girl. She wore combat boots and denim overalls over a red bra with a derby hat over blonde braids.
Draco grinned. She had survived the first episode. She could only wonder what reactions she would get from future episodes.
A sudden wind blew through the room. The candle blew out, along with all the candles in the chandeliers that had lit the room. Everyone was quiet.
who won or was in the bottom in this challenge, as long as he was safe. He had no agenda to send someone home — at least, not in the specific sense. Someone else would have to sashay away for Draco to stay in the race, simple as that.
“Is that all?” Draco rolled his eyes. “If we were still in school, you would be kicked out of Slytherin for that.”
“Welcome, ladies!” RuPaul began, after the queens lined up at the front of the stage. “We’ve all watched your debate. Now, it’s time for some political analysis from our judges. Let’s start with Goldie Hanako.”
. His designs had been so popular that the original Death Eaters wanted him to make them new masks, too.
“Condragulations, my queens! Now remember—if you can’t love yourself, how in the hell are you gonna love someone else? Can I get an Amen up in here?!”
of the universe to bring Crabbe back as a ghost and not Astoria, especially since the fool didn’t even want to be a bloody ghost anymore. “And I can’t help feeling slighted that you would come to me
“And to think you had it all this time,” Potter sighed, still frowning. “Malfoy, this book is dangerous. It needs to be destroyed.”
Last week specifically: The queens staged a presidential debate! Draco campaigned on a platform of returning the United States to the British monarchy, then later underwhelmed the judges with a ballet look in the Pinup Runway challenge. Paris won the mini and maxi challenge. Goldie and Lorena lip synced and chantéed in a double save.
Crabbe’s ghost looked much as he had during Seventh Year. Thankfully, he didn’t bear any scorch marks or other indications that he’d died in fiendfyre; instead, he was the same tall, muscular-yet-slightly-doughy teen Draco remembered. His worst misfortune appeared to be that he was still stuck in the same Hogwarts uniform. Well, aside from being dead and doomed to haunt the earth for all eternity.
an arsehole!” Goyle shouted, his voice filling the giant room. “He blamed himself for Ophelia’s suicide!”
“Heather Villareal doesn’t work for the aurors anymore,” the man said absently as he pulled a small stack of letters out of a leather satchel and handed them to Draco. “I’m Herb Kong, LA Auror Department.” He held out his hand.
Teddy jumped up and approached Draco, looking in the mirror. Now that Draco could get herself into drag away from a muggle audience, she had more charms and transfigurations at her disposal. What took a muggle queen hours to achieve with makeup, she could now accomplish in roughly half an hour, face beat for the gods.
“There’s still seven of us.” Paris Davenport commented. There was a faint edge of bitterness to her tone. “I really thought I would have sent another one of you bitches home this week.”
And with that, it was time for Draco to enter the muggle world in a foreign country. It was a struggle to figure out how to maneuver four suitcases simultaneously. He thanked Merlin for giving him the foresight to pick out a suitcase with four wheels on the bottom, and found a way to grip two suitcases in each hand and swivel them out the door.
So, he had asked Granger for advice. After some discussion and a trip to a muggle vintage clothing store, Draco was equipped with a halter top, leather trousers, chunky-heeled boots, and a wooden stake, ready to portray Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
“Good evening, and welcome to Frock the Vote 20__,” RuPaul addressed the camera from the moderators’ desk. “Tonight, we have seven queens on the debate stage, ready to win your vote. Give us your time, and we’ll give you an erection for the election. I am your moderator, RuPaul, and I’m here with my esteemed colleagues, Michelle Visage and Rachel Maddow.”
“We almost died,” he continued. “But then, this is Harry Bloody Potter we’re talking about, and almost dying just reminds him of the good old days when he was young and almost died on a regular basis. So while I’m still in shock from the ordeal, he whips out his wand and rattles off spell after spell. Next thing I know, I’m levitating above his lap while he’s on his broom, both our trousers down, and I’m hanging on to my own broom with my hands above my head. And then he’s hissing in my ear and all I can think is, ‘Thank Salazar for Stefan,’ because I’m not sure I would have survived Gryffindor Sex Night otherwise.”
“By the way, I have some mail for you.” She pulled a stack of envelopes from her pocket, which Draco gladly took. “I’ll be watching you on set!” With that, she flew away.
Kali scoffed. “Why would I want to out you? I’m here if you need someone to talk to who knows your secret.”
Draco felt exhilarated, finally having a direction he could feel passionately about. He spent the rest of the evening showing Harry what he had learned so far and demonstrating some of the lip syncs he had been practicing before Harry had come home.
The wizarding world was small. Draco was still struggling to believe there were more than 500,000 people in the world, let alone muggles on Instagram who cared about drag queens. Draco had more followers paying attention to her than she had ever dreamt possible. This was
“No. You, he kept staring at and stalking. But he held a special hate for me and Vince. It’s like...well, you know how you can sometimes look at someone and hear a little voice like an author narrating their thoughts?”
“Look, Dad, I see my friend Albus over there,” he pointed to the Potions section. “I’ll pick up my textbooks for Potions and Arithmancy if you get the rest? I haven’t seen him all summer.”
A knock on the door preceded Harry’s entrance, followed by Hermione Granger and Millicent Bulstrode. They waved in greeting as Harry smiled at Draco and hissed.
“I want to see your best beach-ready drag. For your second look, you will be serving us Sexy Vacation Realness. Show us what you plan to wear when you go on that casual little trip around the world.
“I should be on the fish team,” Lorena complained. “Everyone knows I’m the fishiest of any of these bitches!”
?” Kali asked. Draco’s nostrils flared slightly in warning. Kali held up both hands in surrender. “No. I mean, not intentionally? I’m playing a British celebrity, too, so I thought repeating what you say might help me get the accent down.”
Before any of them could make any guesses what this message might mean, RuPaul entered the werkroom in person.
Draco switched the phone to her other ear. Her accent went even coarser as she said, “‘ere now, luvvie, I’m takin’ off me stockin’s fer ya! Ooh, me ankles are bare!”
Eventually, it was time for the queens to get into drag and present their three runway looks for the Ball.
political debate,” Draco told the camera in bemusement. “I’m British. I can’t be expected to solve British
Drag Queen Draco Malfoy now had the opportunity to completely shed those former identities like layers of a snake's skin and reinvent himself (or herself) for a new audience who knew nothing about Former Death Eater Draco Malfoy. Drag Queen Draco Malfoy was lovely and refined and elegant (albeit not above a cake fight, apparently). He wasn’t about to fuck that up by doing anything that might be construed as violent — even to a stupid stuffed animal.
Draco looked at Paris and Goldie. How were they going to pull this off without landing in the bottom?
What with the sudden surge of attention in the press, a viewing party for the second episode was soon advertised at The Bent Unicorn, wizarding London’s hottest (and only) gay pub. The owner had procured a way to stream muggle video onto a large viewscreen without the tendency for muggle technology to short out from too much exposure to magic. Naturally, Draco had been hired to appear as the guest of honor and perform a lip sync after the viewing of the episode.
Paris nodded. “The struggle is real,” she said. “I’m used to winning pageants. This gig is a lot harder!”
“This is a high-stakes game,” Kali told the camera. “A lot of queens go into Snatch Game thinking they’re funny, only to land in the bottom two. If you’re not shitting yourself in terror, you’re probably delusional.”
here in the States?” Draco continued. “For me, this was a journey of discovery, learning how to work with a new material, though luckily the pile on this wool rug was thin enough that it wasn’t much heavier than your average cloaking wool. And now, I feel absolutely divine in my red carpet look tonight!”
Queenie Q was a queen famous for her online videos, but proved herself to be paralyzed with stage fright on Drag Race. Her runway look was mostly a giant silicone breastplate with corset and panties, topped with a cape sloppily constructed from the fabric she had been given. It did not bode well for her. Not that Draco really cared. Draco had a song to memorize.
He headed back up to his bedroom, levitating the tray behind him. Inside, Harry Potter groggily opened his eyes. He fumbled to put on his glasses and grinned at the tea.
“Splendid,” Draco managed to utter after he’d cleaned up tea for the second time that morning. “What’s next in your busy afterlife?”
Goldie picked up the toy and examined it. “Hmm,” he said, “I don’t know, maybe you could take it apart and try to use the stuffing for something?”
“I think he means Jacob Marley,” Granger-Weasley muttered into the book. Draco shook his head. At least she knew better than to stick her nose in their fight.
“We’ll start with Venus,” he began, pointing at each queen in turn, “followed by Paris, then Lorena, followed by yours truly, then Steve, Kali, Goldie, and closing with Lady Cakes,” he finished.
“Honey, you padded!” Michelle exclaimed. “I’m so proud of you!” Draco smiled. She had opted to use the pads she’d bought when she first started working on her drag, with the result that she had an uncharacteristically curvaceous silhouette.
land in the bottom,” Lorena Gucci shot back, giving Acacia a bored look. “Do you think RuPaul wants to crown a winner who can’t win a challenge?”
As always, I appreciate all of your comments and kudos because they help inspire me to keep this thing rolling!
“Right, Astoria,” Harry continued, “So my kids, and Scorpius, thought we could keep each other company.”
The Auror laughed, tilting her head back. “Oh, sorry, don’t take offense! I usually prefer chasing criminals, solving cases that save lives – you know, the stuff most people join the Aurors to do. Watching out to make sure you don’t violate the statute of secrecy isn’t exactly on the same par, you know?” The wind whipped a long lock of dark hair from her ponytail over her shoulder. She shook her head, sending it backwards and swishing in the other direction.
Unfortunately, it turned out that Harry Potter, the Official Saviour of the Wizarding World and Boy Who Lived For Dick Pics, was no match for Twitter. Draco started to wonder if Harry had only reconnected with muggle technology in the first place so he could text and play games with his godson, Teddy. At this point, Draco was probably more knowledgeable about social media. Of all the things Draco had ever expected to beat Harry in, he never would have expected it to be anything muggle.
Draco walked onto the stage for his one-on-one comedy workshop with Bruce Vilanch. After saying hello and a few short words of small talk, Draco launched into his stand-up routine.
The pair shared a private smile as they looked into each other’s eyes, before turning back to the others again. “Besides,” Draco added, “that tattoo is a work of art. You’re not going to see it in Madame Inkwell’s shop anymore since she retired and sold the business, but if you really want to see it--”
to find other friends to share these with,” Harry said, affecting a put-upon sigh. “Can I get a kiss before you finish your makeup?”
“What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, girl,” Acacia Davenport sang, and struck a pose. Apparently she was still living her gold bikini fantasy.
Draco spun around in a circle and skipped lightly across the stage, waving the parchment to the judges as she beamed happily. The judges squinted, trying to tell whether she was holding the song lyrics or not.
“I know I shouldn’t laugh,” she chuckled. “I promised I wouldn’t laugh. But dear lord, I think Carmelita might have been right about Draco being from another planet.”
“Hi,” Draco replied just as eloquently. It was uncomfortably warm for a bookshop, Draco thought as he felt his face heat up. It must have had to do with the large number of customers in the bookstore in early August.
After Draco had taken a minute to collect himself and clean tea off the ceiling, he frowned at his former companion.
He flipped through his costumes on the rack, wracking his brain for ideas. His fingers landed on an antique doll’s costume which he had found in the Black family attic at Number Twelve Grimmauld Place and engorged to his size. He hadn’t had a plan for the dress, but added it to his wardrobe because it was simply exquisite: ice-blue silk embroidered in tiny silver flowers, with pale sapphire buttons and a silver silk sash and collar. The dress had to have been at least a hundred years old, but remained in remarkable condition — owing to the curse on the doll which made it attempt to strangle anyone who picked it up.
“It’s not enough just to look fishy and flash your ass on the runway,” Michelle lectured, wagging her finger at Draco. “You’ve got a great body, but this is Season __! We expect more from you.”
“Listen, Goyle,” he began, as they stood next to the buffet table. Goyle was busy piling hors d'oeuvres onto a little plate. “I need a cunning plan to get Granger’s attention. What do you think? Maybe I could fake food poisoning? No, I can’t assume she would try to help. What about a dungbomb? Too juvenile?”
After a minute, Draco looked back at Harry, who was still frowning at the phone. He must have at least opened the app, because he appeared to be scrolling.
“Ooh!” Teddy squealed. He grabbed Draco’s elbow. “Please say yes! Please say yes!!” His hair changed to match Millicent’s short, dark locks.
“Once I came to and realized I was dead, Hogwarts didn’t look like a battleground anymore,” Crabbe explained. “I didn’t even recognize half the students or teachers.” He casually drifted around Draco’s kitchen and examined a potted plant by the window.
Draco-as-Mary’s hands wobbled a bit as she held up her answer card. “Bum bandit stole my show, he did!"
“That’s right, honey! A minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips!” RuPaul called out encouragingly as Courtney smeared cake across Draco’s barely padded hip. Draco gave as good as she got. All the while, Mike kept taking shot after shot as the two queens each tried to get as much cake onto the other as possible until the cake ran out.
tried one, Malfoy?” Potter asked. “I never thought I’d live to see that either. What do you want to talk to Hermione about? If you eat a weenie, maybe I’ll help.”
Draco let out a long sigh of relief. RuPaul turned to address Queenie Q, who sashayed away with a bitter huff.
“This week’s challenge is to come up with a telly commercial,” Draco explained. “Our team is going to advertise RuPaul’s Thick-n-Juicy Chicken. I’ve never sold anything before, but I’m confident in my powers of persuasion. I know we can turn this out.”
The three looked at each other. “We think we’re going to be sorority sisters who like to turn some tricks on the side,” Goldie said coquettishly.
“Oh indeed.” Draco loved his son, but absolutely hated the purple. Blond hair was the only redeeming quality of the Malfoy family.
Draco extended both arms in front and clasped hands, then gracefully stepped forward down the runway in a makeshift tango. With his face split down the middle between male on the left and drag makeup on the right, it looked almost like two people dancing together whose bodies had merged halfway.
“You have to understand, I’d never seen him in anything less than formal attire before,” he explained. Draco scoffed. “No, really--”
As long as he was going to tell this story, he might as well get comfortable, he thought, and hoped the room would grant him something at least close to a sofa.
Draco felt her cheeks heat up and closed her eyes, trying to remind herself why she shouldn’t hex the muggles. She didn’t think that a tag made any more sense in this context.
“Did she really just say ‘Lady Goggle’?” Steve asked. More laughter ensued before they switched to asking Queenie Q about the critiques she had received for her outfit.
” he cried. “Oh my Lord, it feels good as new!” He tried flexing his other wrist. “I can’t believe it!”
The queens cheered. A member of the Pit Crew walked in with a tray that held a single pair of sunglasses that looked like two bright pink stars. One by one, each queen stood next to RuPaul and donned the sunglasses for their reads.
“I see Goldie nailing every single one of those words and serving armography, jazz hands, and every move under the kitchen sink,” Kali commented, “And then I see Lorena is keeping up with her word for word, move for move.”
“Rude,” he sniffed, “But possible. Anyway, you have my word that I will be more careful in the future.”
After a few minutes of scuffling around the set, the trio was ready to film their commercial. They stood together and faced the camera, Lorena and Draco draped on either side of Lady Cakes. Draco held the platter of chicken in front of the three of them.
Basil pulled out a new mic and helped Paprikah tape it onto Draco. “It helps that you technically didn’t do any actual magic,” he added. “At least we don’t have to obliviate anyone and destroy the tapes.”
“I started after I started doing drag,” Steve told him. “I was having a bad day and my drag mama gave me a ‘mokey treat to take the edge off.” She shrugged. “One led to another, and when other people light up, I light up, too.”
Courtney’s face twitched. “Before your time,” she repeated quietly. “And just how long have you been doing drag, dear?” she asked with a tone of false sweetness.
There is a fixed number of chapters, but it’s a surprise for now lest it give away Draco’s placement in the competition.
“Now,” RuPaul continued, “Each group will have ten minutes for your screen test, and because Acacia won the mini challenge, your group will have fifteen minutes. Gentlemen, start your engines – and may the best woman win!”
“Hey Draco,” Crabbe said, lounging halfway through the library table while Draco was trying to read the horcrux book.
Draco held the slashed-looking, lower half of her face with her right hand while her left arm dangled limply. She limped down the runway, her left leg dragging behind her. The overall look resembled a possessed and broken antique doll.
Harry got up with a determined look on his face and reached for Draco. He heroically apparated them to Best of Both Worlds.
Mounting his broom, Draco sighed in relief as he soared high up above the palm trees and raced a lap around the pitch. He slowed down and admired the view, taking in a big gulp of misty Pacific wind as he gazed down at the ocean vista. After being in the confined, smog-filled heat of Hollywood in summer, the coastal air was refreshing.
“Malfoy!” Potter called again through the bookshelf. “Al said he saw Scorpius, so I wondered if I’d bump into you. Hang on a sec.” With that, he disappeared.
“Do you have any idea how much money you have in your vaults? Even in the vaguest sense?” Malfoy asked.
Goyle rolled his eyes. “Yes, Draco. You can call them muggles. You know I went to a muggle school after the war, and it was the best decision of my life. And if you’d read my Christmas newsletters, you’d know I’ve been teaching English since I finished my PhD.”
“Well, long story short, I was halfway over the Pacific Ocean when my aeroplane got a bad case of the gremlins and everything went all whimsy-whamsy in the gubbins.” RuPaul laughed. “I had just enough time to grab Mae West and jump out with a parachute made from a stick of Beech-Nut chewing gum.”
