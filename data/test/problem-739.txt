Pain blistered into Draco's cheeks, his jaw. The snap of his neck sent Draco's center of balance buzzing. Blood slipped into Draco's mouth as he gasped deeply.
"I'll see you later," Pansy fare welled as she left the classroom.
"Of course I do," was Potter's response, which Draco only responded with a bored look, Potter wasn't going to get any more information than Draco wasn't ready to give.
"I'll see you at lunch Pansy," he dismissed over his shoulder as he shrugged off her grip.
"Why would you think that?" Draco mumbled, rubbing his eyes from the late hour.
Vulnerability is a terrifying idea.
Potter blushed, "You heard?"
Parkinson goes silent at random times of the day, closing off and just staring at nothing at all. Draco couldn't burden her with anything, not with the tragedy that happened over the summer. Goyle and Crabb were not to be trusted, even if they were loyal to Draco, they have their own families. Even then, neither of them could understand the pressure Draco was under, both from families with different status than him. Nott could relate, but Draco wouldn't trust him, he was too hard to read. Flint was too boisterous, he and his family were eager to get ahead. Paranoia clawed at Draco constantly.
He gripped the warming handle of the penknife, it’s weight heavy in the inner pocket of his robes. Draco stared out onto the bright empty ballroom. How many times had he walked though this hall? The place was the same, same walls, same furnishings, but his home had been gutted of any warmth. A warm hand rested on his shoulder, and his looked over to his mother's cool gaze. He was almost taller than her now. Her eyes were wide in concern, her lips in a tight line. Draco met her stare as she touched his face, forcing himself to endure the affection he knew he didn’t deserve. Her eyes narrowed; she had never seen her son look so cold.
"Potter, what wonderous wit will you grace us with today?" Severus rolled his eyes.
Draco watched as his godfather left. Heat boiled in his chest. How dare he? After everything, all of the work and the fear and the pain he put himself through nothing was enough.
And another.
Amends? Amends for what? "You see right through me, my Lord," Draco played along as he scrambled to put the pieces together.
"No," Draco stated immediately.
"This is your house, Malfoy," Severus sneered.
"Draco," Potter gripped Draco's wrist gently, Draco's heart slammed in his chest, "I'm glad you're here."
Now that Draco knew he was allowed, he took Potter's hand whenever he could. Sometimes, if they had a more quiet night where they would just sit and talk about almost nothing at all, Draco would feel Potter draw circles with his thumb on the back of his hand. On those nights, he would go to bed copying the movement with his finger, like it wasn't the touch he was trying to savor.
Draco turned to Potter, rolling his eyes at Potter to make sure he knew of the trouble he caused. Potter grinned in response to Draco's suffering at Ron's hand.
He turned to her. He towered over her small frame. "I have no idea what you are talking about," he growled in a shaking calmness that was forced.
Draco lifted his hands to his face. Someone screamed. His hands were dipped in crimson blood.
“Hey,” a hand on his back brought him out of this thoughts. “Where did you go?” Potter asked.
"Because you would look ghastly in green," Draco commented.
"Oh, did you?"
After he had toweled off and dressed, he opened the window in his room. The widow that overlooked rows of flowerbeds from the gardens. A giving breeze cooled Draco's too scrubbed skin as he sat on the cushioned window seat. Draco played with the cigarette in his fingers, a zippo lighter in his other hand. A tray with a tea set was laid on the desk in the corner of the room. Draco supposed one of the House Elves left the snack. The tea had long since grew cold with lack of attention.
"Yes, actually," Draco lied. Crabbe wasn't in any of his classes, due to being held back a grade to catch up, so Draco was certain Crabbe wouldn't fact check him.
Theo watched as Blaise left, biting his cheek. Theo didn't need a reminder of his situation, he lived through the pain every day. This shown in his wise, pale blue eyes. "You won't-" he stared.
Draco just had to prepare himself for when this wasn't his reality, but only a lovely memory that he had to lock away.
Potter’s hand dropped, “Sorry, we can just walk.” Potter’s face was one of such kind understanding, but his cheeks darkened in color.
But how? How could she not return to her own home without labeling herself as a Blood Traitor? Her mother would try her best to shield Pansy from any whispers, but whispers would continue.
"No," Potter blurted.
He continued forward, because he never stopped moving. He was wearing all white robes, formal ones, similar to the robes he wore for his betrothal ceremony. That's right, he had a dinner to attend.
"Malfoy, you're my friend. Just let me what’s going on," Potter pestered.
Granger and Weasley walked in, not even noticing Draco as they argued about something or another. Potter followed in after them, but instead of following his friends to the front of the class, Potter took the seat next to Draco instead of his usual one. Draco's stomach dropped to the floor.
"I'm…I'm sorry about your dad."
What if Potter didn’t want to do that again? What if Draco was such a horrid kisser, that Potter had realized that he wasn't into men?
"Hold the bottle tightly," he ordered.
Potter hummed, "Sometimes I wonder what would have changed if I were to have been sorted into Slytherin." Potter rested his chin on his knees.
Longbottom and Granger were next. All hitting the floor, stiff as wood.
Severus tried to bait him by telling him about Potter's dip in his Pensieve. Potter and Severus were no longer continuing Occlumency lessons.
Potter's eye are so green, Draco noted before nodding, his heart loud in his ears.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Fuck off," Draco dismissed, sitting between the two. Pansy sat across from him, sitting in between Crabbe and Goyle.
Fred had actually punched Draco before Potter could 'fight' him. This caused Goyle, the loyal bastard, to tackle Fred with all of his might. Ronald had attempted to pull Goyle of off his brother, only to be met with Montague's shove. George shoved Montague for shoving Ronald. Crabbe took this to be his cue to punch someone, that someone being Potter, but Draco shooed him away to go punch someone else. He then punched Angela Jones, who kicked him in between the legs. Really, at this point, Draco wouldn't be surprised to see Professor McGonagall and Severus having a fist fight.
The muscle in Lucius's jaw tensed, he had noted the aggressive calm Daphne was portraying.
He didn't dry his tears as he laid on his bed, alone in the world.
Maybe he was finally getting the attention his parents tried to buy. Maybe he was glad to have power over people when he had none for so long.
"Then use a different toilet Malfoy," Severus shook off.
Umbridge instantly started to shake her head, "That Potter, speaking so horribly, as if our Ministry was just plain incompetent."
The footsteps hurried without fault, someone was late for something.
Warning: Graphic Violence
"I should find my family," Draco choked.
Wouldn't it be nice to have a parent's guidance now?
"I don't care," Draco cut off coolly, his temper coiling in his stomach.
Draco sat in his chair, turning his body towards Potter, his legs crossed, but his upper body relaxed, leaning against the arm of the chair with his elbow. Draco waited for Potter to start the conversation, but he didn’t seem to be in any hurry. Potter sat on the edge of the chair with his hands in his lap, his cloak bunched behind him.
"I suppose it would be hard for you to get close," she noted.
"There's a reason why no one has bothered Draco since he won the fight, let's keep that in mind," Theo reminded.
"Harry says you're a Seeker," Sirius mentioned.
By the third lesson, Severus had suggested that Draco's presence wasn't need. He was about to agree whenever he had caught Potter's eye, silently begging him not to leave. Of course, Draco then refused to leave. He was grateful to be there, to sooth the tension between them, to buffer whatever fights almost broke out.
"I'm scared of what she'll want me to do," Pansy sobbed, her hands still covering her face. "What if one of my suitor's wants to try out the goods? Would she have me-" she couldn't finish through her crying.
Daphne gave him a look, "Come on, we're going to miss lunch."
Theo leaned into Draco's space, "Did you fall in?" he asked with a grin.
"Potter, the decadence!" he mocked surprise, he received an honest smile in return.
"Potter, Slughorn wouldn't ask me to be a member of his club of slugs," Draco said.
"Wait, please, not again-"
Potter looked down at him, Draco's heart rose to his throat. Draco looked up at Potter, the fire behind him provided an warm glow between them. "What isn't going to work?" Potter whispered, so quietly that Draco wasn't quite sure if he heard him correctly.
Potter was probably disgusted with him, being kind to Draco out of pity. Potter would smile politely before leaving, then he would avoid Draco, before pulling away completely.
He would kill him. Kill Draco's family first, make him watch, before slowly killing Draco. He wouldn't use the Killing Curse, too quick. The Dark Lord likes to play with his victims, enjoys the cruelty. Draco knew this from experience.
"You're not seeing reason," Severus stated, "Let me-"
"Sorry, I'm sorry," he croaked, he felt a soreness in his throat that wasn't there when he went to bed. The arms around him loosened, Draco  sank to the cold floor, his back  against a bed. Goyle moved in front of him, though  he was careful to keep his distance, "You okay, mate?" he asked.
Draco's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of a body walking towards him. The shape of a girl illuminated by a small blue light, Daphne, of all people. Her hand was outstretched to trace the castle walls with delicate fingers. She walked as if gliding, with the grace of a woman, not simply a girl. Her long blond hair trailed behind her, her eyes bright with a seriousness that Draco couldn't remember ever seeing in her despite knowing the girl for years now.
They stepped out into the potion's classroom. Quietly making their way to the large wooden doorway. Draco poked his head out, he doubted anyone would be on petrol at this hour, but he needed to be sure. When he knew the coast was clear he nodded to Potter. He stepped out of the classroom, the Slytherin common room wasn't too far from here and Potter would use his Invisibility Cloak to return to his common room.
She didn't hand the letter to Draco directly, but placed the letter on the table, sliding the parchment over to Draco. She pulled away completely after, curling into the chair. Draco took the letter gently, opening the folded paper and reading the containments.
Draco said nothing as Daphne sat down next to him, not minding if her pale blue cloak got dirty. The blue light above them disappeared into smoke, they were left in the privacy of darkness. Draco could feel her leaning against the castle next to him, her legs out in front of her. She seemed relaxed here, despite the recent tragedy. Draco watched as his eyes adjusted to the darkness as she pulled a packet of muggle smokes out of her pocket.
"I thought you had your ways, Malfoy," Potter articulated, a surprising playful smile on his lips.
Why was Potter so nervous? "Of course I can, I'll get it to you as soon as possible," Draco shrugged. The potion was easy enough, getting the supplies was a simple task for Draco, he would see Severus tomorrow.
“Been there, done that,” Potter giggled.
"Oh, so many things. I am very concerned for the education here at Hogwarts. I only wished that I had less obstacles so that I could properly modify what I see fit," Umbridge told him.
Repeat.
"Well, obviously you don't," Draco snapped.
"We have homework for History?" Draco answered.
The look on his father's face was worth whatever punishment he would receive. Draco further ignored Lucius, speaking directly to Mr. Weasley as his father opened his mouth to reprimand him. "How's work, Mr. Weasley?" Draco had probably spoken four words to Mr. Weasley in the past.
Draco puffed around his smoke. He took the moment to think about his next words. "Three people know about me and Potter. You," He leaned against the tree behind him. "Snape, and Dumbledore." Sirius ran a hand over his unshaved chin. "I just need to know if he can be trusted."
"Pansy, what's going on?" Draco reached for her shoulder, needing to know.
"Are you willing to risk your safety by keeping me alive?"
"Merlin, Malfoy, what did you do?" Pansy tusked, her eyebrows knitted together.
"I wish I could keep you safe too."
"Excused me, Professor," Potter braved through the tension in the room.
Lucius pinched his lips tightly. He was coiled in on himself with the constant pressure that comes with being a Death Eater. The pressure of attending the funeral of a child that your own child had killed. The pressure of reaching for an attainable goal. He was about to break.
"I'm sorry," Potter whispered.
"Aren't you tired of all the secrets?"
"Is their someone you have your eye on?" Pansy stroked his shoulder.
Draco could feel his face turn red up to his forehead. His ears, cheeks and neck turned hot in flattery, Draco cursed his pale skin which only made his blush more obvious. He heard Potter snort next to him. Merlin, Draco was going to crawl under a rock and die.
Draco couldn't find his mother's halo of white blond hair. He walked, passing by families of grinning faces. The cold seeped into his bones. He let the cold numb him.
"Pansy-" Draco sighed.
The girl stayed silent, wide eyes looked up at him, he waited.
The wood of the door hit the back of his head as Draco slammed himself into the hard door.
“Leaving, or at least I was trying to leave,” Draco interrupted, cupping his bleeding nose.
"Oh, oh yeah. Fred and George pushed him into a cabinet, and he disappeared," Potter explained.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I certainly hope not," a small smile formed across Professor Lupin's lips as he teased. "It's water."
"He'll meet you in the Owlery just before dinner, now go. Tell no one," he supplied, hoping this was enough to make Blaise leave. Blaise jerked away, shooting Draco a glare, but Draco had guessed correctly. He left without complaint, followed by Bulstrode.
Draco broke into a sweat, his stomach turned as he looked to Daphne. She didn't have this information, Draco hadn't intended on sharing this. "Potter, let's go somewhere private to talk ab-"
"You're going to take that mudblood's side over mine?!" Pansy barked, tears hot on her face .
His toes blistering in pain, he shuffled with his back to Potter's table. Potter was silent behind him, but Draco could tell his date wasn't going spectacularly.
"I'm sorry," Cho admitted.
So, he drank in the students chattering, the laughter, the new excitement from the first years. The only way he was going to get through this was by giving little pieces of quiet enjoyment to himself.
"By- oh, never mind. Let's start from somewhere else," Draco compromised.
"I would really like a partner in crime, I can't possibly piss off everyone in the castle all my lonesome," he explained.
Draco took this as his cue to go to bed. He changed in his dorm quietly, Crabbe and Goyle already  asleep. The two were thick as thieves; so were Blaise and Bulstrode, apparently.
He was sure his Lord would be more forgiving of his failed attempts at killing if he had a portal into Hogwarts.
"Did anyone follow you?" Potter asked.
Standing in the doorway was a woman with bright pink hair and narrowing eyes. “Tonks, we were just-“ Potter stammered over an explication.
Draco sobbed against the memory, trying to push the thought away. Needing to breathe.
"Didn't lose."
Bellatrix had released the spell. She was battling a figure Draco couldn't focus on.
Draco laughed, he probably shouldn’t, but he couldn’t help himself. “Potter, who would I tell?”
"Don't," Draco ordered, "I know you're under pressure, but don't. Your family has a solid hold on their standing and you know it. No one is trying to strip your family of their power, while mine is having to claw back into his good graces like whimpering dogs!" he lectured.
"…I thought you knew," Draco sighed. Potter didn't need more reason to feel guilty.
"About Daphne, I'm sorry," Cho continued.
"Nothing," supplied Draco with a smile. He rose, "Try not to call anyone a frog-faced bitch," he called over his shoulder continuing to hurry away.
"Yeah," Draco answered quietly.
Ding.
He motioned to his food, still mostly untouched, "But Professor-"
"Potter, I know this is difficult, but-"
Draco laughed painfully, "Potter, everyone knows of your existence."
"Remus, please," Professor Lupin corrected in a gentle voice. His jaw was unshaven, his hair disheveled, but his eyes still had a deep kindness in them that was learned from cruelty inflicted onto him. His suit was in a muggle fashion - no amount of magic could cast away the obvious wear. "Drink?" he probed again.
Ice wrapped around Draco. Fear froze his heart. Water in his lungs. Claws down his back. He couldn't breathe.
Daphne followed Draco to the far back table without being asked. She wanted to talk. The table was tucked in the corner next to the staircase towards the girl's dorms. The table was small, only enough room for two people with a squeeze, there were no other tables or bookshelves around the table, easily making the area private for gossiping.
He nodded his thanks to Blaise, who just shook his head with a sigh. Theo handed him back his bookbag, his eyes on the ground.
Draco stared down at the page in front of him. His eyes were sore not from reading, but from trying not to cry. He shifted uncomfortably in his seat. He decided to pass the couch for the privacy of the table underneath the stairs. The torches were dimmed for the late hour. Most students were in bed.
"Always the polite one, aren't you?" Mr. Weasley challenged.
Warning: Brief mentions of death and some violence.
The bubbles stopped.
"Yes, because they are so concerned about mine," Draco argued.
"You're emotions are so close to the surface," Draco observed, "instead of clearing your mind of them, like I've been telling you to, try to use them as a tool."
Shit. "We've always been on first name biases," he supplied.
Sure, finding out that Snape was the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor was probably a punch to the gut. And, Potter was probably a little jaded at Draco's rejection last night. Also, Potter was being hunted by the Dark Lord, was criminalized by the media and so on so on… Potter had a lot to make him angry, Draco knew this, Draco accepted this.
Draco easily shoved past the group of Death Eater's, all confused. Draco ran as quickly as his body would allow towards a rushing Potter. Potter and his friends were hurrying to an open door way.
"Merlin, Potter, you really are an old lady," Draco teased as he was the first to reach the top of the tower. Draco walked around the large planetary system built between the two levels. Potter walked around the large moving system on the opposite side. They observe the moving planets and moons dancing around each other in silence.
"Daphne please," Draco pleaded quietly, "you know what he's like, you know what he's capable of." He wrapped an arm around her shoulders, taking her hand in his, a silent plea.
Draco founded Potter's hand. He shoved Potter into the room, throwing up spells in any direction to hit something, anything.
How could he help? They couldn't keep regressing at this rate. Potter's mind needed protection.
Draco laid on his bed looking up at the canopy. His room was warm, but only barely. His bedside lamp was the only source of light.
The hills of the country side lulled Draco into a gentle rhythmic trance. He was so tired of the crushing weight of the Manor.
Draco's shame was wet in his chest as his chin continued quivering. He was prepared for the terror that would follow him after he had killed Daphne, as ready as he could be for taking a life, but he hadn't thought of damning Daphne's soul to rest on this world forever. "Could someone cling to their body?" the question was out of his mouth before he could stop. He didn't want to know the answer.
"Alfie!" Draco snapped.
Daphne huffed, "No, I wouldn't expect you to get your hands dirty."
"Fantastic," Draco noted, his eyes never leaving Dumbledore, "and what's the reasoning for keeping this information from Potter?"
His mother wouldn't even look at him after the betrothal ceremony. His father kept his gaze steadily cool as if daring Draco to challenge his authority further. Severus was there that day, standing next to Father. Severus wore dark navy robes instead of his usual black, Draco had never seen him wear color before. Severus offered no comfort, not even a nod in Draco's direction.
Theo huffed, but didn't say anything, putting his hand in his hair as he focused on the text. If he started to pull his hair out, Draco wouldn't have been surprised. They had been at this for hours. Draco had been falling behind on his studies because of the late nights spent in Occlumency lessons. He needed help.
"Where's your other half, Draco?" Blaise asked.
They went over the almost rehearsed safe topics of conversation. Draco was only paying half attention has he twistedly enjoyed the cluster fuck that was Potter's date, with Daphne obviously eavesdropping as well. He winced at Cho attempt to make Potter jealous, which Daphne pointedly looked at Draco for.
"It's nothing, what were you saying?" Draco looked down at Potter.
"Oh look, your crush is here," Theo pointed to the entry way as Daphne walked in. She took a seat at the large table with her sister, taking out her homework. "I think she's taking out those notes you've been fantasying about."
"I have some things on my mind that need my focus, that's all," he explained.
Draco followed Potter in as he smiled. "I don’t mind at…all…" His words trailed off as he entered the main room of the house.
“Who do you talk to about this sort of stuff?” investigated Potter.
The library was quiet. He ran his hand along the spines of the leather books, just has he had done has a child.
A familiar laugh drew Draco's attention. Potter, laughing at something Weasley had said, Granger next to them with a sly smile on her lips. Potter had taken off his school robe, showing the muggle jeans he wore underneath. The top button of his button shirt was undone, his tie loose against the heat. His sleeves rolled up to his elbows.
She allowed herself to be courted across the crowed street to Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop. Draco could almost smell the sickly sweet perfume of Umbridge's office. His eyes popped with the bright tacky pink that was celebrating Valentine's. Floating baby cherubs shot tiny arrows that turned into gold dust at couples. Draco itched to hex them. "We have a reservation," Daphne reminded the hoists sweetly.
Draco's heart pounded in his chest. Warmth pooled in his heart. Potter's hand was warm, sure, on the small of his back as Draco was pulled closer to Potter.
Draco should look down, try to seem meek, make the fight seem like a snap reaction of hot temper, not the careful decision that it was. He couldn't. He couldn't look down. He held Dumbledore's gaze, daring him to see Draco for what he was.
Daphne would be there, that's a fact.
"She tripped," Draco answered, between puffs of smoke. "She tripped and fell onto a container of doxy venom."
Draco mingled half-heartedly. No one wanted to talk to him. He just nursed his water as he made nice with anyone who would meet his eyes.
Eventually, he couldn't help the smile that appeared on his face. "Hey," he whispered, his eyes were still shut.
"You mean your only living daughter," Draco stepped closer. "Let's not forget why we are all here." Mr. Greengrass tightened his hold on his wife. "If you think you have any say, then Astoria is already dead." He held both their gazes, a warning laced into a threat. The weight of their daughter's death already pressed down upon them. The thought of losing their only living child made the pair deflate. Neither one of them could catch his eye.
"What did Potter say about letting in Slytherin students?" she asked Draco.
The two allowed their giggles to continue as they drifted back into silence. Draco leaned against the brick wall, looking up at the ceiling.
A large wooden wardrobe appeared in the middle of the room.
Draco pulled away, shock rushed through his body. "What do you mean?" he asked.
A knock interrupted their thoughts. The door slid open slowly. A short girl with light brown hair stood there. Astoria's knuckles tightened until they were white on the door. Her lips were tight when her eyes fell on Daphne. Daphne, sitting quiet cozily next to Draco, with her feet in his lap.
Draco allowed laughter to escape from him, letting his guard down with- ”no, definitely not.”
"How's that reading going? Good? Better get back to it then," Draco continued writing his essay. His essay that he had no one to proof read because Theo was only good at one subject.
A sly smile found placement on Dumbledore's lips, "I've just come from speaking with Mr. Finnigan, the attack on him seemed almost entirely unprompted."
Potter was nowhere to be seen throughout the day. Where could he have gone? Draco had searched everywhere, Potter wasn't in the infirmary, he wasn't quick enough to avoid Draco the entire day. Where could he be? Draco also noticed that only one of his shadows remained in the halls. Granger, but she seemed tired and wrecked with…worry? Why was she worried? What happened? Was Potter alright? Was he wrecked with an illness so worrisome that St. Mungo's was the only option? Where were the Weasleys? A family matter surely, Potter was a Weasley by proxy. What? What happened?
Potter broke into a loud laughter at that comment before he opened the door. He lead against the doorframe casually as he stifled his giggling. "Oh, Malfoy, what a surprise," Potter noted.
"Go fuck yourself," the words came out before Draco could stop them.
Tonks studied the two boys, “Let’s get you two to the castle.”
Blaise moved towards Draco, before catching his glare and following Bulstrode out. "Milly, wait," he called after her.
Draco let the offense roll off of him, not really giving a shit what people thought of his father right now. "I'm just a shithead," he joked to Greyback's huff of laughter.
"Have you ever asked out a girl before?" Potter investigated.
"Oh, I think you were," Draco grinned.
His mother was never one to be subtle.
He walked past the grieving parents, his own following behind him as he walked down the grand entrance of the home. The hall was bright from the large windows.  He knew his way into the reception hall. The atmosphere the house gave was a light hearted one. The image of a family laughing, of a dinner party with tipsy smiles, of children running throughout the halls, was not far from one's imagination. The weight of death was heavy in the airy home.
"It's not like you can just find someone who is trained in the dark arts and be like, 'Oh, hi! Can you attack me, please?' Where would you even find someone that was trained? The only people I can think of are actual Death Eaters, and I don't see any here," Draco lectured.
"Hurry up, asshole. You're running late for breakfast, or would you rather think about someone's broomstick?" Blaise continued to teased.
"Are you sure? Because you took a while," Theo teased.
"Did I see you make Montague, the Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch Team, cry? Yes, yes I did," Potter confirmed, but he didn't seem angry with Draco. Why? Potter grinned, "The guy is a dick, and he started it, he had it coming," Potter shrugged. Draco smiled. Potter continued with, "I'm just worried that he will give you a hard time during Quidditch meets."
Theo shrugged, rubbing his arms. "I guess it's the holidays," he theorized.
He had to stop doing that. Weeks had passed, yet all he could think of was what would Daphne do. What advice she would give. What she would say. What she would laugh at.
Potter's nose was against his cheek, his breath over Draco's jaw. Their noses touched, lips so close.
He was too shocked to be angry. His face hurt too much to yell. Draco watched as Potter turned away from him to follow Weasley down the hall, Granger not far behind. Draco cupped the blood coming out of his nose, his head still buzzing.
Draco studied Potter, his eyes were bright with a steady vulnerability. Potter was prepared to be hurt. Potter swallowed, Draco's hesitancy to answer was an answer within itself. Draco would have to be honest if he wanted to keep his friendship with Potter, even if that means showing is cards to Daphne.
"What he usually does, he was an asshole to Weasley," Pansy supplied.
"Merlin, shut up," Draco leaned over to take one of the mirrors. "They're two way mirrors, idiot, so that we can talk to each other without raising suspicion," he explained.
and (?) Harry Potter
Potter glared at him. "If what? If we got caught? Why was it that she was murdered while the rest of us had to write lines?"
"Harry…" How to tell someone what they are worth? "You're worth the worry." Draco settled on.
"She has the privilege," Daphne had said factually.
His only friend was going to turn him away.
"She wouldn't do that, she's your mother," Draco comforted, tasting his lies on his tongue.
Draco rolled his eyes, Potter really was an asshole. Potter tilted his head in thought, giving Draco a warm look.
Potter didn’t say anything for a long time. Occasionally sniffling, but never pulling away from the comforting arms around him.
"Professor Snape!" the strain on his lungs made his breathing harsh.
"I'm just going to assume you meant to say something clever."
The crowd hushed as a chill slipped down their spines. Draco's heart pounded in his chest. His rips burned with the force of swallowing his panic. He watched as a crowd parted for their Lord who was glowingly pale in his night black robes. His blood red eyes were proud as they glided over his followers, a human show of his pure power. Draco was sure that he was Death itself.
Finnigan hit the ground after another punch to his jaw.
Pansy sighed. "I don't know, Draco, she's mad at everyone these days," she explained.
His father hadn't known of the warning Draco was given by his mother? What else didn't Lucius know? How many secrets were kept between Draco and his mother without Draco even knowing? Some part of him just assumed that his mother was acting under her husband's agency.
Potter sighed with a classic roll of his eyes, "Why? Why protect the DA?"
"You're so romantic," Potter joked. "…I just…I don't know, I just wish you could join slug club."
Daphne nodded, but she remained silent.
"You're weak," Severus spat out, "weak and pathetic." Potter slumped forward in his chair, sweat plastering his shirt to his chest that was gasping for air. His hands were shaking on the armrest. When Potter didn't respond, Severus snapped, "Is this how you are going to face the Dark Lord? Trembling and weak?"
He was half expecting the slap across his face. He just didn't know if Cho had it in her.
Draco held onto Potter until he stopped shaking, until his breath soothed. He pulled out of Draco's grasped, his face wet. "This sucks," Potter noted.
"Malfoy-"
The Malfoy family, as their reward for hosting their Lord, had the privilege of standing next to his throne. Their backs were to the farthest wall of the hall, candelabras on either side of their family. Lucius stood on the other side of grand wooden throne,  leaning heavily on his cane. His robes were loose on his body, and he had lost a noticeable amount of weight.
"Don't you dare! After you gutted me in the hallway, what else was I supposed to do?" she yelled, tears streaming down her face.
"What do you mean? Yeah that's it," Potter shrugged.
"Shut the door!" Theo hissed.
Where would he, in theory, hide the present? There was no easy hiding spots within the room, no furniture or wardrobe-
Draco watched as his mother circled him. Her green dress dirtying from the floor, but she didn't seem to care.
"Not anymore," she commanded.
Would Potter still want him?
Potter swallowed. He looked down at his hands. "He's in my head," Potter repeated.
"The globe Potter." His father was always cold.
"They won't let me see my dad," Crabbe explained, "I just want to know if he's ok." Crabbe gave Draco a humbled look, his eyes cast downward and his hands folded gently in front of him. Crabbe new he was addressing someone above his standing, he knew he was giving Draco a chance to call in a favor.
Draco heard them before he saw them. A snap of twig behind him, he turned only to be met with a giant, horse-like creature. His gasp quieted the class, everyone turned to him, but he only looked at the creature.
"Why do you care?" Potter's voice was cold.
A gentle hand on his check brought Draco out of those thoughts.
A momentary truce was between them.
"We should start," Draco interrupted him.
Draco doesn’t believe in miracles, but he was grateful to see Crabbe and Goyle when they arrived for breakfast.
"A free meal with pleasant company," Draco reminded.
Draco allowed himself to be enclosed into comfortable silence as Daphne continued to defy Draco's expectations of her.. He had known Daphne since they were children, never exactly friends, but they had enough forced engagements that they could be called acquaintances outside of also being peers.
"I had to do that, before… whatever happens next." Draco could feel Potter's words on his lips. "Draco I-" Potter looked surprised at what he was about to say, as if just realizing his words now. "I lo-"
Draco started to list all of the steps for making Garroting Gas in his head. When he was finished with that, he moved on to Angle's Trumpet Drought then onto Moonseed Poison. He was in the middle of listing the ingredients for Jawbind Potion when he decided that the night was late enough to go the Room of Hidden Things.
Draco knew Potter's anger, he wouldn't be surprised if this avoidance lasted a week. His chin quivered, he laid his arm over his eyes, needing the pressure. He should've handled Potter better, he just needed reassurance in their relationship, a simple explanation would have sufficed. But what was he supposed to say? After all, Potter's accusations were true. Draco couldn't be seen with Potter, and it was because of his name, but there was so much more at risk for Draco. Why couldn't Potter see the risks Draco was in? Why was he so utterly stupid?
With another glance around the classroom for prying eyes, Draco pulled his bookbag onto his lap. He rummaged silently for the salve he had made yesterday. Pulling the round container out, he wrote a note on the parchment.
"Gentlemen," Daphne stood with grace Draco didn't think she possessed, "I will be on my way."
"Yes, and unless you want to watch, you'll leave," Blaise gave one more shove and Draco was out the door.
"I don't know what you want me to do," stated Draco simply, "I'm in the same situation as you."
"Why the attitude?"
Draco had to wake up from this.
They had been studying for hours now in the Common Room, most of the other students having gone to bed hours ago. A couple of groups of students were around the common room. Blaise and Bulstrode were sitting together on the opposite side of the large, well-lit, room. Blaise looked just as tired as the rest of them - he probably wasn't getting much sleep. Draco didn't know Bulstrode enough to make any observations on the girl.
"Are you saying you'll let me kill you?" Draco questioned back. He was so tired of these expectations.
Draco stumbled backwards from the force of the spell that slammed into his shield. His head hit the brick floor as he tripped over the Death Eater he put in a body bind. His feet tangled together over the frozen body. The whip of purple flame flew towards Draco. He rolled to the side. The flames licked Draco's ear. The smell of burning skin in the air.
Potter chuckled dryly, "I can't count all the ways in which I am very much not lucky."
"Yet here I am," she replied, she walked over, handing him a smoke.
Sorry for the late update. With my new job/schedule, I'm going to have to change how much I update to once a month instead of every other week. Hopefully, this will lead to longer chapters.
Draco didn't have anyone to wait for anymore when class ended. He was the first one out the door, ignoring Professor's calls out to him. He ignored Potter's concerned looked. He ignored the sneers of other students. He was still trying to ignore his grief twisting a stab into his heart.
Severus's grip on him only tightened, but he didn't say anything. Draco's jaw tightened until it blistered pain into his temples.
"For some of us," Pansy added, leaning against Draco's side.
"What the Minister doesn't know won't hurt him," Umbridge ignored the students.
"Acquaintances? Come off it Draco, we're friends," Daphne insisted naivety.
Draco was between them in an instant.
He surprised Draco with questions unrelated to the potion they were discussing. He snapped at Draco for the most trivial actions; breathing too loudly, writing too messy, having his textbooks stacked on his desk.
"Speak up, dear," their Lord spoke sweetly.
"Now I know you're lying," Draco charmed. What information could he get from Black?
"Let's see what you've manage to pull out of your ass." He handed her his essay draft. They worked with practiced ease that comes with experience. Draco realized how much he missed this, missed her. Missed laughing with her over homework. Missed talking with her about subjects he wouldn't ever think about.
His footsteps pounded on the hard bricks. His heart thumped in his ears. His lungs complained from the sudden activity.
Her silence cause a twist of fear in his stomach.
Draco leaned away from his father's attempted reach for his shoulder. Lucius dropped his hand. He made his way to the door.
"This is a two person conversation, idiot," Blaise hissed at the intruder.
He had killed Daphne in his home, sliced her throat with a cold sureness that made his mother stop looking at him. The reason why he could be sure, was because he had already killed the Daphne he had known. He sliced into her memories to remove information that would give him away has a traitor, but by doing so cut a piece of her soul out.
Draco did his best to push down his fear as the train gently stopped. The movements around him slowed, he was watching his movements from somewhere deep inside himself. He wished Potter was here, seeing him would make Draco feel better. Potter had only been away for two days and already Draco felt his absence.
"Walk with me Malfoy," his Lord ordered, looking up at the full moon. He was almost as pale as the moon. Draco took pace with his Lord, walking slightly behind him, as manners commanded. They continued through the smooth path. His Lord slowed his step, Draco was careful not to walk alongside him. They left the light from the chandeliers of the ballroom, now completely bathed in moonlight. "Malfoy-" his Lord motioned for Draco to walk in pace with him "-no need for such formalities."
"We're not going to spill blood on gossip so. Keep. Your. Mouth. Shut." Draco ordered.
Draco turned. His father had Potter by the hair. He was growling into his face, threatening him, his gaze deadly.
"Yes, Severus taught me. Why are we here?" he inclined.
“I don’t know, fucking Umbridge? Your friends? Crabbe, Goyle, I know you walk with Blaise in the halls sometimes?” he questioned.
Weasley proceeded to punch Draco in the nose, hard.
He was bored, so he decided to get into trouble.
Warmth covered Draco's side as Potter sat closer to him, his arm around his shoulder. "Draco," Potter was so close that his breath brushed against his neck. A hand found its way around Draco's bicep.
Potter relaxed, but he still had a tension in his shoulders, had a tiredness in his eyes. Draco tried to lighten the mood with, "Besides, I'm not exactly popular with the girls."
"What-"
Daphne's eyes showed the fire within her as she glared at Draco. Daring him to speak against her, daring him to lecture her on the dangers for the both of them. Not aware that this was exactly what Draco wanted.
What struggles would Pansy go through? Was the Dark Lord going to punish her for her father's wrongdoings? Hasn't she suffered enough?
Draco bit his lip. The light from the lamp above Potter's head made his eyes bright even from this distance. He wondered how they would look up close. How Potter's eyes would look if Draco was right above him, their bodies touching as he crawled on top of Potter. Their lips touching as Draco leaned down for a kiss.
"What happened?" Potter whispered as he took his place next to Draco. Their bodies were pressed next to each other on one side. Potter was warm, as always, and his heart lightened a bit.
Draco tilted his head, "I've what? Sorry, I can't hear you. You'll have to speak up," he baited.
An accident then.
"Professor!" Draco gasped.
Pansy walked by his side as he strode off. Everyone kept their heads down as he pasted the other students, afraid they would be next for Draco's verbal lashing. "That was gutting in the down square," Draco clarified to Pansy as the two walked away from a silent Montague. Students continued to avoid him, he didn't blame them, he was out for blood.
"Worried? Why? What happened?" Draco questioned, putting his hands in his pockets.
"I've missed you," Potter whispered into his ear.
The two of them were the last to walk up the pathway and through the large double doors that lead into the main hallway and further into the Great Hall. They heard her before they saw her. A small girl, curled at the foot of the large stairs that branch off from the main hallway, weeping in pain. She was nursing a bloody hand wrapped sloppily in a rag.
He continued to dinner, his back to the classroom.
Draco gave him his arm with ease. Potter was focused when he unbuttoned Draco's sleeve to expose skin. Draco turned his head to look out the window, smoke filed out into the moonlight. He had stared at the dark mark enough. The gentle night was quiet.
Potter moved closer to Draco, wrapping the cloak tighter around themselves, "Daphne has kept them in line so far."
Draco mumbled as he collected his notes. He walked across the common room to the large table where Daphne was working on the same essay. Daphne just raised her eyebrows at him, he hoped his smile was pathetic enough for her to grace him with her mind. She rolled her eyes, pushing out the empty chair next to her in silent permission.
"Draco," the grip on his shoulder tightened as he was pulled away. Rising up from under icy water Draco allows himself to be malleable to the gentle hand on his shoulder, leading him through the sea of bodies and tears and shaken children, out of the great hall.
This was for the best. Potter would move on, forget Draco and the darkness within him. The distance would only help Potter, Draco would be selfish to try and mend the relationship that was between them. "We don't have to meet anymore if you don’t want," his voice didn’t shake, but he couldn't meet Potter's eyes. Draco couldn’t make himself see the relief that he would find there. "I understand if this changes things, if you're uncomfortable, I could make other arrangements for someone else to teach you Occlumency."
"It was necessary," he excused.
"Don’t leave me," was the quiet prayer Harry whispered into Draco's neck.
"You'll end up walking, Potter. As I don’t think you'll be able to fit your big head through the carriage door," Severus snapped back.
Draco was facing Potter while he was acting an ass around him and his friends, so didn't see Weasley shove Draco in the back with strength Draco wouldn't expect from the thin boy. Draco stumbled several steps forward, almost falling down but managing to steady himself. He turned, "What the ever loving shit are you thinking, Weasley?"
Draco looked down when Potter snapped that words towards him.
He spit out the blood in his mouth from when he had bit his tongue earlier. How long had they been at this? Hours, days, weeks? Sunlight shined in from the window high above them. Was it morning or late afternoon? Pain was pain and more pain. He didn't beg anymore. He couldn't. He knew begging was useless, when he earned his freedom he would be released. Whenever he met this impossible standard.
Investigate their loyalty. Torture. Astoria. Astoria knew Draco had protected her from the same fate as her sister. He couldn't let her be under scrutiny. He doubt Astoria would protect the man who had just sliced her sister's throat.
Draco continued to eat his breakfast. Daphne sat quietly beside him, reading the paper. His impending engagement didn't send any particular emotion through him. What did worry him was these expectations they have of him. What his Lord expected of him.
"It's nice to see a wizard finally get his hands dirty, usually they leave that part of the job to me," Greyback admitted.
"Why is Dumbledore willing to risk the very fabric of a student's mind on me?" Draco elaborated. "For all he knows, I have no clue what I'm teaching Potter, or perhaps I'm trying to lower his defenses to be in much needed good graces with the Dark Lord. Why take the risk?"
"Tell me what's bothering you," Draco avoided the question.
"Never mind then, that's punishment enough."
The slap blistered his cheek. His mother's wedding ring leaving a scratch where she had hit him with the back of her hand. "You may sleep in his bed," she snarled as she stepped into Draco's space. "You may wear his clothes, have his face, his voice, but you are not my son. You are a stranger in my home, and to me." With that, his mother turned her back on her son.
Stabbing shame snaked into his stomach.
"I…um…think so," Myrtle answered.
Draco rolled his eyes while giving Potter a shrug, crossing his arms.
"I got you something," Draco let go off Potter, handing him the small box.
I hoped you liked it! This is a bit different than my usual style. I would love to hear from y'all! Just a heads up, the next chapter is the last one for this story, but not the last in the series.
"Mind your manners, Weasley.  We're at a bloody funeral," Draco cooled, making Weasley blush in shame. "Now, if you'll excuse me, I must find my respectable family," he excused himself. "I'll see you at school," he called over his shoulder to Alfie.
"You really think so? We've discussed how I am excellent at breaking the rules."
Draco stopped talking, his eyes widening, his heart thumping.
Draco investigated the stack of books on the large table in the center of the room.
He hadn't gotten so much as a glance at the guest list, but he guessed.
He didn't hesitate to step onto the ninth floor of the Ministry.
Draco stood from where he had been kneeling.
“Have you been able to properly conjure the charm?” Professor Flitwick gently prodded with patience that made Draco envious.
Draco’s stomach lurched as the door to the cart started to raddled.
He tried to trust his instincts, pushing his panic down. Pansy and Crabbe were out for blood, but Bulstrode didn't want this fight, she was here for Blaise. Blaise had simple motivations; Theo. Draco could take control here.
A gentle laugh left Dumbledore. "Isn’t there a bravery to meeting Death like an old friend?" Dumbledore asked himself, gazing into the fire.
Potter's panicked voice echoed against the small lavatory. He was failing against Severus's attack. Draco turned his attention to something else. The dark room was lit by blue torches. Severus's potions and supplies littered the tables closest to the walls. Draco focused on the large bookshelf behind Potter, struggling to read the spines of the books, but needing the distraction. He had taken the seat on one of the stools.
What was he supposed to do?
Potter rolled his eyes beside him. "No, Malfoy, I don't," he supplied.
Draco bit his lip, he would have to compromise. "Severus can join us for our lessons at my digression, but if he makes Potter regress in his progress he will leave."
"Draco…pssst…Draco…Malfoy, Draco, Draco Malfoy. For fucks sake, Malfoy!" Theo yelled at him.
"Malfoy, if you're saying what I think you're saying…" she warned.
Silence was Draco's answer, terror settled in his stomach as the pieces fell together.
"Not very well if a student could assault you with such ease."
"And how do you suppose we do this?" Draco smiled back. The crowd of students milled around them, laughing and talking. Couples smiling at each other. Blushes on cheeks. Valentine's in hand. Draco and Daphne truly blended in, no one would be able to pick them out of this crowd. No one could tell that they had war in their hearts and they were ready to burn the world down.
"For Merlin, we even had a werewolf teach us one year. Dumbledore allowed a werewolf near children," Draco continued.
"I am very jealous. Especially because you cheated," Draco teased.
"Oh, who was Draco thinking of to have his head so far in the clouds?" Daphne stood next to Theo.
"And what would you do if I answered yes?"
"Not a word."
A gentle elbow caught his attention, he looked over at Pansy, who was now seeping the roots. "What did you do to piss off Snape? You're his golden boy, after all," she hissed.
Potter laughed, the lesson had tired them both out. The pair laid in front of the fireplace, the warmth basking both of them. Draco watched as Potter laughed, Potter had done well tonight. Draco could only hope that it was enough. The lesson had ended by Potter rolling to the floor and staying there until Draco joined him, which is the only way he would ever lay on the floor.
Class continued. Their potion was perfect, much to Severus's distain.
He should have known Potter would have been made a target by Umbridge, she hated him. He should have known. He should have thought of a better plan that didn't include getting Potter banned from Quidditch for life. Stupid. He should have thought ahead. Stupid. He was better than this, he had to be better than this.
"Really? I couldn't tell."
"He has gotten close to Theodore, hasn't he?" she theorized.
"Let us get you back to the manor. I'm sure it's past your bedtime," the Dark Lord turned down a path that led directly to the manor. Draco stumbled after him. Their conversation had felt so fast, yet Draco's feet ached with the long walk. Should he mention the Greengrass family? Was he in a place to sway his Lord's mind? He owned Daphne, he would protect Astoria, but how? "You're suddenly quiet," his Lord called out.
Daphne's delicate hands shook as she took another inhale from her cigarette and blew the smoke directly into Lucius's face.
Draco's family? Or Draco himself? A strange man who was about to own their daughter?
Draco had ended up with a broken leg, three fractured ribs, a concussion and third degree burns on his back. Not bad for a day's work.
He should go back to Hogwarts, enjoy the rest of the day in the library, but there was a pulling for him to stay. Wrap himself in other's laughter that he couldn't partake in. Observe couples expressing their feeling for each other, feelings that could get him killed. Enjoy the innocence of his classmates, before they grow up just as quickly as he has. Draco walk around, taking in all of this and more. Not dedicated to any direction in particular, until his eye was caught on an item in the widow of a candy store.
"Twice doesn't make a pattern, Potter," Draco replied gently.
Students started to mill around them as the pair walked through the brick halls. Their peers that seemed so young to Draco now.
A picture of Potter, one from fourth year, Draco instantly recognized, was placed in front of Draco and the book he wasn't reading. Daphne had reached over Draco to enclose him in her arms while holding the paper so he could read. The article was some propaganda against Potter, unsurprisingly.
Draco couldn't stop smiling, "Ah, yes, well. I sometimes have my moments," he blushed.
"Why is Montague picking on you? After you made him cry in the hallway, why wouldn't he stay clear of you?" Potter investigated.
The weight in Draco's chest deepened. Daphne was his friend. She would hate him soon enough.
"Malfoy." Draco's head jerked up at the sound of his name. Mr. Weasley wasn't paying him any mind.
"Draco."
Tell him. Tell him of Dumbledore's true nature. He never offered Draco salvation. No, but they had made a deal. A deal with the devil.
"Don't tell me what to do," she snapped.
"Like I would take my bo- ah, my acquaintance-"
"You can't smoke in here," he hated how his voice sounded, as if he had been screaming for hours.
"Don't let Potter hear you say that," Draco prompted. This was the first time someone has ever spoken badly about beloved Dumbledore. Through his will alone, he made himself investigate over the splitting headache that was bright behind his eyes.
"Dobby!" Draco jumped backed in his chair, instantly grabbing for his wand in fear.
"You should take this matter very seriously," Draco wasn't successful in leaving the mockery out of his tone, "I should hope a full investigation would take place."
Draco laid his head on the table, ignoring Theo's snort at him. They sat across from each other on a small table along the wall of the common room. A table specifically for two. Books and loose notes piled between them. Their usual table, the best table, was taken by Astoria and her friends, who had the audacity to be enjoying themselves.
"Unfortunately," Daphne agreed.
Draco nodded, his stomach twisting, claws ran down his back, "Have you told anyone else? Granger? Perhaps McGonagall?" he randomly guessed. He was grasping at straws.
Panic settled deeper into his chest when Potter stayed silent. "Look, I don't know what I did wrong," Draco babbled, "but I didn't mean to." Potter didn't move, still looking down at the bag. Draco's breath quicken, "I can't apologize if you won't tell me what I did wrong," he begged, his voice cracking.
"Crucio."
“I need to see them. Will you be okay with that?” Draco gently asked.
Draco supposed he went wrong when he brought the Weasley's mother into this, and the song might have too much, but Potter said no to all other forms of mocking. Plus, Draco had spent too much time writing the song to not have every Slytherin student sing along during their match.
She didn’t love him.
Potter released his knees to stand up fully, sweating as if just finished with Quidditch practice. His eyes burning with determination that Draco admired before nodding.
Draco stared straight ahead, willing to let Potter have the last word in his embarrassment, his face still hot. Potter elbowed him in the arm, motioning to the parchment.
A warmth spread from Draco’s chest to his cheeks. He had missed Potter in a way that made him ache. He had missed being able to think about Potter without the dangers of someone hearing his thoughts. And now he was here. Draco could touch and talk to and think all he wanted, because Potter was safe. In this moment, they were safe. Draco had missed being safe, but he wanted Potter most of all.
Dumbledore steadied him with an even look, "How are we going to address your mission, young Malfoy?"
"No, not this summer," Potter explained before going into his recent adventures with Dumbledore. How Dumbledore used Potter as a carrot on a stick to talk Slughorn into teaching at Hogwarts again. Draco's thoughts, not Potters. "Were you invited to his private dinner?" Potter asked.
"I don't know why Dumbledore wants me to bother teaching Occlumency, you're nothing against the Dark Lord-"
Draco didn't know what Severus was going to do, he couldn't read the still face of his mentor in the dim light as he turned to face Draco.
"Oh my- Potter- she was trying to make you jealous," Draco spelled out for him.
Her father, too stocked to move, eyes already glassy-
"Where's everyone else?" Longbottom's voice was panicked.
What could he do? Nothing. He was good for nothing. He was unless.
"As they should be," Draco lied. His head already swarming with the new information.
"No Professor, of course not. I just cannot bare to listen to Potter talk badly about our Ministry," he baited.
Daphne started to shuffle in between the damn tables. "Cho! I didn't see you there-" she broke into conversation with Potter's date as if they were old friends.
Not that he should have to tell Potter that, Potter was a very knowledgeable person. Perfectly aware of the consequences of the situation Draco was in if he was found out. In fact, Potter was one of the only people fully aware of how much danger Draco was in. How important secrecy was. How exact Draco had to be in his situation.
He was frozen. He was frozen as she came to the bank of the tiny creek. He was frozen as Astoria picked up a rock and threw the stone at his head.
"You didn't have to get me anything."
"…that's it?" Draco asked.
Draco squeezed Potter's hand, "Don't be, I'm the one that broke his leg."
If they were going to work together, if Draco was going to keep his promise to Daphne, he had to earn Astoria's trust. She watched as Draco pulled a lighter from his pocket. He help the zippo lighter in front of him. Astoria steadied her gaze on her sister's lighter. She stepped forward, snatching the lighter out of his hand. He let her, he blinked as blood leaked into his eyes. He focused on her instead of the swaying ground.
"I didn't mean-"
Draco tried to step away, only to be pushed back into the wall by Pansy. "Some of us have to gravel. Some of us have to leech and claw our way into his good graces, not all of us have a birthright. Not all of us have a breathing father who can protected us from his cruelty," she lectured.
Would Pansy die? Would she drown in the darkness that she repealed?
Potter was blushing, he tips of his ears turning an embarrassing shade of red. Draco had to fix this… somehow.
Daphne, so strong yet scared. She had been right, Draco had been manipulating her this entire time. He now had enough power over her to ensure his own safety, but she had also gained a dangerous amount of insight into his life. They had their wands raised, both ready to strike if the other steps out of line, a deadly game to play. Trust could get you killed.
"Why not?" Draco prodded. Pansy looked down at her notes, opening her book, she was looking anywhere but at Draco. "Pansy, what's going on?" he questioned her.
"The Ministry is the highest order, he should be honored that the Ministry as finally decided to step in at Hogwarts," Draco gossiped.
Other students filed into the classroom, each walking by the double desk Draco sat in. Word had already gotten around of the fight between the usually united Slytherins, and how Draco was the one who broke it up. Gossip about the event filled the air around Draco.
Seen together.
Draco had never seen his mother so fiery in her anger.
Draco knew how dangerous he was, what he would do. He had to take precautions, Daphne knew too much, about him, about how he feels. What exactly is he capable of.
He hurried into the storage closet, pushing by the other students trying to do the same. Severus hadn't reached out to Draco since the night of Potter's outburst, but Draco new his godfather well enough to know when he was getting ready to strike. He quickly collected the ingredients necessary, milling around the other students. The small storage closet seemed extra crowded as Severus was standing in the doorway, observing from over his nose his eyes never leaving Draco.
"Daphne, I don't need you to judge me," Pansy pulled away.
The young girl took a long, deep drag from her smoke, seeming to enjoy the practice, before offering Draco one from her pack. Draco numbly took one of the cigarettes, holding as he had seen Daphne do as she lit it for him, cupping the tip against the nonexistent wind.
"A boy?" Potter asked, his eyes wide.
He arrived to the span of wall which turned into the door, he rushed through the door. The room looked as it always did when he and Potter were alone, ugly orange couch in front of a warm fireplace with two purple chairs on opposite sides of the couch adjacent to the fireplace. The fire had dim sum, but Draco could still make out a figure laying on the couch. Draco walked over to the sleeping person, not surprised to find Potter there, sleeping soundly.
He could feel eyes on him, eyes that have been studying him since he returned from break. Chuckles filled the Gryffindor  table as Draco walked by. The trio were already sitting at their table, Weasley was being pat on the back by one of the twins, but he only tightened his jaw as he glared at Draco.
"I have to set up, Potter, so I have a reason, at least," Draco teased, trying to calm Potter down.
Severus was next to her instantly, barking orders at terrified children. He was yelling. He was yelling at Draco, Draco realized.
"Potter, you're early," Draco greeted.
"Yes, Theo?" Draco played along.
“Yeah...yeah, okay.” Potter grabbed his cloak from the bench by the window. “It’s getting late, let’s get back to the castle.”
"Shh," Draco hushed gently whenever he was sure he could talk without sobbing. He kissed Potter's temple, "Hush, just breath Harry, just breath."
"If you think that I will let my daughters into your clutches-" Mrs. Greengrass hissed.
Draco held the smoke against his lips, breathing in the heat into his chest before coughing harshly.
Potter turned to the exit, but coming to the door, also came upon the Imperturbable Charm. The awkwardness lessen only slightly as Draco walked across the tiles of the room to remove the charm. Potter acknowledge his thanks with an inclination of his head, before leaving the lavatory.
Mrs. Zabini's smile enclosed her entire face. She rushed to her son, wrapping him in a warm hug. Blaise held his mother just as tightly, his face in her shoulder. They laughed and talked warmly as if they had just been a part for a day. They linked arms as they left to their home.
With a sigh he explained, "I wanted to win in a way that I wouldn't have to fight again."
Draco watched as she left, there was a strength in her shoulders that proved to Draco that he would feel the wrath of her later. Bile rose to Draco's throat, why wouldn't he be better? He continued his way to breakfast, claws at his back.
"Apparently, Dumbledore had him visiting the giant settlements," Umbridge happily shared her information.
The curtains were suddenly pulled back. "Wet dream?" Blaise grinned, leaning against the bedpost. Draco propped himself up on his elbows.
He shoved past the large wooden double doors of the library, ignoring the yells of Mrs. Pince.
Draco ignored her, "Thank you Professor." He knelt down, taking a handful of ash.
"That's generally the point of reading,"
"Get the fuck away from my cousin, Malfoy," a voice growled behind him.
"Yeah, no problem," Draco managed to choke out.
The next story for this series will be out in January.
Potter wrapped his arms tightly around Draco, bringing them somehow closer. Draco tightened his hold on Potter, who had stopped chatting the sting of apologies but was still crying into Draco's neck.
"My father was arrested for being a Death Eater."
"Did I make things worse?" Potter whispered.
"Oh, but Weasleys, twenty points because I don't like you," he mocked back.
Lupin barked in laughter, "She ran out, if I'm remembering correctly."
Draco's blood ran cold as Pansy went painfully ridged beside him. Her face paled to an almost grey as her eyes rolled into the back of her head, the orbs bulging from her face. Her mouth opened in a scream that turned into a gurgle as black foam bubbled from her mouth.
The heavy scent of Umbridge's perfume had seeped into Draco's skin, he had a stench about him now. Pansy sat as far away from he as possible. Daphne just turned around and walked away from him. Theo pretended to gag anytime Draco stood too close to him. This went on all day, even though he was sure the smell had left.
"Don't," was all he could say.
"I just thought that perhaps, if you were raised as a muggle-" Draco stepped into the wand at his throat, using one pointed figure to gently push the wand over his shoulder instead of at his throat "-that we should handle this the way you filthy muggles do."
Daphne shifted slightly, "How does Potter's Army help our people?" she whispered.
This was a horrible idea, he was being too obvious, he needed to stop.
Follow me @CarpeBellum on tumblr.
No one was talking to him anymore.
"I know," he acknowledged.
Draco thought of Daphne. Alone. Scared. Standing before death himself before Draco sliced the life out of her. He had taken away her memories of what she was standing there for. Would she have stayed without those memories? Did Draco steal her life only to also chain her to this world?
"Bentley?"
"Three days' time."
He looked up, an easy smile on his face at the sound of Potter's voice. "Hey," he greeted.
"I'm surprised you took that as a compliment," Potter noted.
Whenever Potter had told Draco about Dobby's new residency at Hogwarts, relief had enveloped Draco. His father never had told him why Dobby was suddenly not a part of their family anymore. He had assumed the worst, as Dobby's family had been a part of the Malfoy's for generations.
Merlin, Potter's eyes were so green. Draco swallowed, "Well, who else would bandage you up? Really, Potter, you must be Madam Pomphrey's least favorite student."
"How did you find out?"
Draco could feel his ears warm and his stomach turn at the casualness of Potter's accusation, anyone, student or professor, could overhear and ruin what advantage Draco has gained with ease. His temper snapped in fear with- “Actually, I have known the entire time, and if I wanted to, I could have all of your little army carving lines into their bodies until there’s not a single inch of them unscarred!” Draco snapped.
The pair walked up to him, he was involved, there was no way around it now. "Draco," Theo pleaded, "Draco, please-"
The room was silent for a long time after. Eventually, voices could be heard in the crowded room, gentle and quiet at first, but they gradually grew to their normal, slightly loud, volume. Pansy returned to her notes, making comments to Theo about. Daphne stayed quiet in her anger, Astoria didn't say anything. Something touched Draco's arm, he blinked, tilting his head up to see who it was.
"Nothing against his powers-"
"You know why, Potter," his voice was quiet. He looked down at his hands, his shame cool on his neck.
Draco rolled on his back, his arm touching Potter's. He pillowed his head with the arm not touching Potter, he didn't want to lose contact. "We're friendly," Draco explained.
The room was the same as always, comforting familiar. The fire was lit, the couch was a deep shade of yellow tonight, but the chairs that usually sat on either side where nowhere to be seen.
With that, Draco was pulled by the shoulder to a corner of the room. Lucius kept his grip bruising as he whispered a warning threat into his ear. Draco was shoved away, as if his own father was disgusted with him. He turned, but his parents had their backs to him. They were making their way to mingle appropriately.
"I'm sure the headmaster will hold off dinner for the entire castle for the only Harry Potter," Severus sneered.
Potter was facing this war with enemies at all sides.
Potter didn't seem to blame Draco for getting him banned from Quidditch for life. Which is nice, Draco wasn't sure if he could handle Potter being mad at him again. Potter's anger was unfortunately awful.
"Of course, sir, you could always discuss my detention with Umbridge," Potter challenged.
"Why are you like this?" she whispered. "I was offering to help you."
"…bleh."
"And what?" he snapped. He wanted to be cruel. "What should I do? What you have done?" He raised his hands out to his sides, "what exactly have you done Cho?" She didn't answer him. "You've done nothing. Nothing but mope around for you poor dead boyfriend while self-flogging yourself for having dared liked another boy." Her jaw clenched. He didn't stop. This was the first time he felt something in weeks. "All you do is punish everyone for moving on while you stay behind. Luckily for you, Cedric died before he could leave behind his girlfriend still in school-"
"Where are you going?" Daphne asked.
More bubbles answered him. He could swear he heard a voice. He leaned in more closely, the voice sound familiar. The bubbles gained intensity.
"What the fuck are you talking about?" he snapped.
Draco looked up from his textbook. Pansy was sliding into her seat.
"I'll consider it," was all he could offer.
"I'm still thinking it over," Draco turned back to his breakfast.
"You-" Lucius fumed, "-best remember your place."
"Really?" Pansy overheard, as she always does, "Draco, scary? Please, only if you're a Hufflepuff fist year girl."
"Daphne-"
"Stop it."
Pansy turned to him, furious. Draco stayed silent, letting her decide. Pansy sighed, pinching the bridge of her noise.
A hand shot out of the toilet, grabbing Draco's shoulder and pulling. Draco thrashed against the arm, the bubbles erupted in intensity. The entire toilet seemed to shake with the force of the arm. The pipes swelled under the pressure. Draco yanked himself free of the hand, stepping back out of reach.
Dobby grabbed the front of his robes, his large green eyes glossy. "Mr. Malfoy must help Harry Potter!"
Down the hall. To the lower floors.
Draco swallowed, "No, I suppose he doesn't," he agreed. "Who else knows?" he investigated.
How clueless is his father?
Other students had stilled, too scared to draw attention to themselves. Snape was on the warpath, they were trying to avoid his wrath.
The sight of Daphne's death, her body after, twisting and coiling unnaturally in death from his hand, was laced behind his eyelids.
"Aren't you in charge of choosing who else will be in the Inquisitor Squad?" Theo asked Draco after he had drifted farther into his thoughts.
Draco didn't want his Lord to win this war, and Dumbledore was the only man with the abilities to beat the Dark Lord. Of course, that left Draco balancing on a nail. He had to appear to try to kill Dumbledore, but he had to be clumsy enough to ensure the man survived. Which meant, he had to have several failed assassination attempts to report to his Lord.
"Dumbledore, of course, but he has always had his hands bloody in politics. He actually has the games keeper, the giant one that lives in the hut, teaching this year. How is a games keeper, one with no formal education, qualified to teach?"
"Legilimens," Severus continued.
"Sorry, sorry. Nothing to worry about," Black raised his hands to show just how harmless he was.
"What the fuck?" Draco hurried backwards, taking out his wand. What was happening? How hard did Astoria hit his head?
Professor Firenze gently touched his shoulder before kneeling down in front of him. He held a bowl of water and a towel. He ordered for students to back away, allowing Draco room to breathe. Firenze took Draco's hands gently, dripping them into the warm water. The blood disappeared, turning back into ash in the water. Graying the bowl. Draco wiped his face with the towel, ignoring how his hands were shaking as Professor Firenze stood up. He addressed the class in a steady tone, "Omen Fire shows us our fates, but rarely does the ash give a direct form." There was a thick silence that tickled Draco's spine. "What could be some meanings behind the ash for Mr. Malfoy?" Professor Firenze asked the frozen class.
Draco made his way down the steps, thankfully not meeting any pissed of Weasleys on the way. He snapped at a few students, taking House Points for his reputation. If he remembered correctly, this was McGonagall's study hour, she should be available. Draco finally arrived to the stairs, he silently begged for none of them to move. Some students passed him, but gave him room, study hall was almost over so students were starting to crowed the hallway.
The group drifted into silence. Draco looked out the window, they still had a way until they arrived to the train station. Draco's stomach tightened into a painful coil as the train travelled on and on. Sweat started to prick the back of his neck. He felt sick, there was something wrong. Painfully wrong. Draco was offset by the simple wrongness he knew, he could sense with an instinct that was settled deep into his heart.
"That's it?" Potter snapped.
"Oh…" Potter looked down.
Potter, where was Potter?
"It's me, it's just me," Potter whispered into his ear, his breath on Draco's neck.
No mail came for Daphne, but her sister Astoria received a message from the family owl. Pansy hadn't gotten an owl for weeks now, not that you could tell if you didn't pay close attention, but Draco was constantly observant.
Usually, every book was in their place along the bookshelves. Dobby had always put away the books that had been taken out unless specifically instructed otherwise.
Potter shoved him in the shoulder, "Don't give yourself all the credit, Draco, I'm just as argumentative."
"Bring your cloak, I know a perfect place for us to meet," Potter ordered.
“And I am sure to someone like you, anything seems to be worth your time, but, unfortunately for you, my time is not worth this conversation,” Draco said smoothly, enjoying the effect his remarks had on the boy in front of him, who clenched his jaw in aggravation.
The plan had gone to shit.
Love? How could he? How trivial. Unnecessary in his future marriage. At least he and Daphne understood each other on that. They would never love each other, care for each other, respect each other, maybe. Could he love her?
"Seeing as Professor Slughorn won't allow me to use any of his facilities outside of class, I tend to use Snape's classroom often."
"Yeah? Who else would I like?" Potter retorted.
A rock hit the side of his head, he snapped onto his back from the force. He looked up at the pale blue sky. Blood stained his pale blond hair. He couldn't make himself care over the sudden pressure in his skull.
Draco sighed. This was a very fucked situation, he shouldn't get involved. He had more than enough to handle, they knew what they were getting into, they could handle they own situation. "I won't say anything," was all Draco offered, making his way back to breakfast.
Comments are seen and are deeply appreciated!!!
Draco stood, he was done with this line of questioning. "You wouldn't be meeting Death, you would be meeting me."
"Malfoy, let me see you. Are you okay?" Potter's voice was gentle.
He rested his head in his hand, his elbow on the back of the couch. Potter was cute with his brow knitted together in thought, but he only did that whenever there was a problem he really didn't understand. Rarely would you see Potter furrow his brow during class or lessons, or even during a test. No, only when there was a problem Potter had no clue how to go about.
Potter released a breath that told Draco he had heard him, before leaning slightly to him and whispering out of the corner of his mouth, "We haven't even ordered yet, this is a fucking disaster."
No, that didn't make any sense, the Dark Lord would see this as a blessing. The family he would pick for this would be an honorable family, one he would want to make an example of for other families. The Greengrass family was free of scandal, they would make an excellent candidate. But they didn't have any connections to the Dark Lord, except by their social circle.
He blinked. A gasp slicing into him.
"I don't need your help," Weaslet snapped.
"Fuck, Draco. She needs your help," Daphne swore at Draco's hesitancy.
"Hmmm," Draco flipped through a large book, noting Severus's personal writings in the margin. He tucked the book under his arm, making his way back to the hard seat he had been sitting in for the last four hours.
Draco tried not to physically tense whenever Potter entered Slughorn's class late. Draco sat at the back of the class. He didn’t like the way Slughorn looked at him, like a Death Eater.
A particularly interesting footnote caught his eye. He frowned over the word, he doubted this was ever mention in his Defense Against the Dark Art classes. He sighed, realizing the chapter didn't mention his only promising lead again. He wrote
Draco landed on his ass yet again, his mouth open in surprised. Potter looked down at his, his eyes wide, his face red. Draco tilted his head in question. Potter ran away and jumped on Montague's back in response.
Draco had quite the predicament on his hands. Potter was aware of his knowledge about his little army. Not only that, but Potter was confident enough not only to confront Draco about it, but also to tell Draco the location of these training sessions, something Potter would only do if he was absolutely sure Draco knew all of the information beforehand. This could only mean that Potter knew Draco had been sitting on the information and had not used this information for his own gain. There was no point in Draco even trying to deny Potter’s accusations.
"Mr. Malfoy, why didn't you use your wand?"
"How…" Draco paused, not sure how to ask, "how are you?"
His hand was around her jaw. Daphne's back tensed as her jaw was gripped by Lucius, he brought her face to his, forcing her to balance on her toes.
"Yeah, just ugly," Potter laughed.
"Did you knock?" Severus supplied unhelpfully.
Ding.
"Excuse me?" Theo asked, not following.
Only to fall over someone.
The girl stopped her weeping, Draco could feel her eyes on the back of his neck, the silence stops being a comfort in this moment as everyone stopped breathing.
"Really? He would risk the game to piss you off?" Potter ask.
Draco wasn't keeping track of the weeks as they passed. He was busy with studying for O.W.Ls. He was busy with the Inquisitorial Squad. He was busy with ignoring Potter. If he kept himself busy, he wouldn't have to think about his grief. If he kept himself busy he wouldn't have to think about what Dumbledore told him the night of Daphne's funeral. If he kept himself busy, he wouldn't have to think about what happen to Daphne after she died.
Why wasn't Potter responding to Severus's lessons? Draco himself had been taught by his Godfather, his response had been much quicker than the process Potter was making. Draco's eyes dropped in the weight of sleep. Potter was not only not making any progress, but he had been regressing lately. Why? Was Potter not responding because of the teaching style? He could keep up with Draco just weeks ago. Draco's head nestled in his elbow.
"Can you believe Stan Stunpike was arrested for being a Death Eater?" Draco overheard a couple of students whispering in the halls.
"Betrothed," Draco corrected.
"Yes, we've been over this," she rolled her eyes.
Draco hurried out of the library, his stomach twisting. His face hot with worry. What did this mean? Who were S.P.T and A.P.W.B.D? Why was his father researching this? Was he being ordered to by their Lord?
Draco stayed a moment, enjoying d the feeling of calm that Daphne had given  before going back to bed.
The weight of Potter's constant stare weighed heavy on his shoulders. Wherever Draco went, if Potter was there, he was watching Draco. For what? Was he aware of how obvious he was being? One glance at the wrong time, and Draco was bleeding on the Manor floor.
"She asked me to protect you before… that night."
"Like my way is already decided without me," she ranted.
"What's this?" Draco inspected the object.
"Someone good if you decided to wait until now to tell me," he snapped, a twist off worry settled in his spine.
"Well no, but if you read the author's first two books, you should be able to understand this one," she explained.
"Let him go!" Draco had never heard Potter so angry.
"You probably didn't hear while you were infatuating over Potter," Pansy chided.
"I was his snake," Potter shared, "His snake attacked Mr. Weasley, and I saw the attack happen through his snake."
They still weren't making enough progress. Potter was still having dreams.
"Professor, I am sure I will," Weasley whipped a tear from his eye, still giggling.
“No, Merlin no, they can’t be trusted. Not with- not now,” Draco confided. He bit his lip at the almost slip, Potter was unusually easy to talk to, he would have to be more careful.
"I was so scared I wasn't going to see you again," Potter explained. "I was terrified all summer that I would come back to school, and you wouldn't be there. And that would be it. That’s where we ended. I would never know what happened to you. And no one would know how you stood for what was right. And… you deserve better than that."
Draco slid the book over to investigate, recognizing the book instantly as the Potions Theory book he had been reading. He must have left the textbook in the Room of Hidden Things. There was a piece of parchment sticking out of the top, one that he didn't put it there. He pulled out the parchment, reading the note.
"Stating the obvious isn't helping," Theo argued.
"Where are you going?" he called Potter backed to him.
"She'll be okay, right?" he asked, as no one had told him any news on Pansy.
"Not haunted, just ugly?" Draco inquired.
Pansy took the hint and backed off.
"What happened?" Blaise asked.
Potter shrugged, "Kinda boring until Dumbledore showed up."
"I don't want to do that again," Potter interrupted.
He took Potter's hand.
He lift his knife and fork that had appeared suddenly in his hands. He reached into her ribcage, the blood pooled around her open body, warm liquid spilled onto his lap. He cut off a piece of her still beating heart as she wept.
Draco would have to push his mother out of the way.
"Have you told anyone else?" Draco asked, turning back to Potter.
"Really? I couldn't tell, my apologies Professor," Potter lied innocently.
Theo stood awkwardly, unsure if he should follow Draco's example or not. "No one's going to notice, not with Astoria kicking Crabbe in the balls," Draco explained over a mouth full of food. Everyone's attention was on the fight. Students standing on tables, gathering in a tight crowd around the entertainment. Professors failing to investigate. Theo sat next to Blaise, a blush on his cheeks. Draco rolled his eyes as Bulstrode tsked. They shared an unexpected moment of comradery.
He had rushed to find an empty train cart.
How could they raise innocents into this world as it is?
But perhaps his parents were wrong.
Shrills of Bellatrix's laughter clawed at Draco's ears.
Draco walked towards Potter, interrupting his stammered apology as he wrapped his arms around shaking shoulders.
Potter's laugh made him smile, "I'll keep that in mind for next time."
"No, you don't. You have no idea," Potter shook his head.
"Why? What do I have to gain from keeping my attackers a secret?" Draco asked.
Trees lined the wide path up to the Greengrass manor, providing shade for the many people walking up to the large estate. All dressed in black.
"If you're mad at me, you have to tell me, I'm shit at this sort of stuff," Draco broke the silence.
--------------------
"You look like shit, you know that right?"
"It's complicated? So we can be friends here but not in public? Why? Why is it complicated?" Potter stood, standing in front of Draco, his breathing heavy and his brow serious.
"Put your sister on a leash," Pansy warned Daphne.
Dumbledore avoided the question, "I will not have my students attacked on school grounds."
He watched over his breakfast as Potter entered the Great Hall with Mafalda. Potter scanned the Slytherin table before finding him with his eyes, he met his eyes with a nod. At least something is going the way Draco wanted.
"Potter," he didn't know how to tell him this. "You know I care about you right?"
"Shit at what? Relationships?" Potter snapped.
"Shit, Lucius, did you know that your son has bigger balls than you?" Bellatrix mocked.
Draco raised the globe in both hands above his head. Potter's eyes widen at him as Draco stood behind Dolohov.
"Betrothed? Married, betrothed? That hasn't happened since… oh my god," realization twisted his stomach painfully. He thought he was going to puke. The Dark Lord was always one for traditions, even those that had been long rejected.
Severus was in the back of the class, probably making one of the other students cry. He was out of earshot.
"You mean the situation in which I'm a girl?"
Theo looked up at him, his blue eyes bright. "Thanks," Theo whispered. Draco shrugged.
The sentence fully clicked in his mind. "Shit. That's not what I meant," Draco corrected, his face warming. "I wasn't going to play this year."
"Um…" Draco hurried after his Lord, "no, it's not that…"
“But-”
Draco smiled, "I thought I would walk you to breakfast."
Severus didn't mutter a word to Draco has they walked through the thick walls of the castle. Severus didn't lead him to his classroom, or the dungeons, but to Dumbledore's office for detention.
That day may never come for them.
"Well, Draco," she teased, her voice playful as her leaned in to whisper into his ear, "some of our Daddy's are dead."
Let them.
"Draco…there are certain…" Lucius paused to find the correct phrasing. Draco has never seen his father at a loss for words. Lucius swallowed. "There are certain duties that come with being a Malfoy."
"What? Can't be seen with me because I'll hurt your name? Why? Did your father forbid it?" Potter taunted. Draco was frozen. This was too much. Potter knew him too well; he knew exactly where to hit. "Can't be seen with me because it'll hurt your father's job at the Ministry?"
"What? Do you agree that you've been wasting this opportunity to learn? Do you not need an education? Or are you simply too wise to be bothered with my class?" Severus challenged.
"And he won't have to," Daphne reached across the table to take Draco's hand in hers. "He as us, all of us." She held Draco's gaze in hers as she held his hand. Her voice lowered, "They, we, would fight for him, we just need to know how."
Crabbe and Goyle talked across the table about a topic that Draco didn't bother to follow. Nott was frowning over a complicated Potions Theory book that Draco had read last month and didn't understand, so he naturally recommended the series.
"That's exactly why she would. She's scared, Draco. I'm scared," Pansy explained, the weight of her reality crushing her.
Draco shrugged, "About as well as can be expected."
Draco excused, "Let's take a break."
"Don't worry, there's some for you too, Crabbe," Theo teased. His smile plastic and tense.
"No one! No one knew! I didn't even know, why didn't I know?" Theo complained to Draco's glee. The pair continued down the hall towards Transfiguration.
Draco gasped. He gripped Pansy's wrist, his knuckles white. His heart beating loudly in his chest. Everything seemed distant, he couldn't hear the professor, all he could hear was his own thundering heartbeat.
"I can still hear you, I'm right here," Severus muttered, his head still in his hands.
Bentley decided that he had enough, hurrying up the stairs without so much as a good bye. "Wait," Draco outstretched his hand, "come back."
He didn't deserve warmth. He was twisted. Whatever was gnarled in the Dark Lord's soul was also in Draco's.
"We can't turn on each other if it's already every man for himself," spoke Pansy.
Draco didn't say anything. Disappointing Potter carved him out. Potter kept looking at him, Draco couldn't meet his eyes, he felt so small.
"And that statement classifies as, 'concerning: but I'm too scared to ask," Draco responded.
A large rock hit his shoulder, he instinctually brought his arms up to cover his chest.
"Really, I never been an acquaintance before, I'm a little nervous-"
"Your guess is as good as mine," Daphne rose from her seat, her plate not even touched. She turned her back, leaving them in their shame that they all carried, but for different reasons.
Severus sighed, breaking the silence, "Very well-"
He was about to step into a war field. He was about to fight his parents. His father, at least. Why else would his father have studies over prophecies? There was so much Draco didn't know. Yet he was walking into a trap. He knew this was a trap. What if someone recognized him?
"He doesn't have to explain himself to the likes of you," Crabbe supplied, striding over and using his size for intimidation. This forced both Draco and Theo to take a step back to allow room for Crabbe.
"No yelling, Parkinson!" Severus yelled.
No one said anything.
----------------------
Draco mirrored Severus's motion, laying his hands on the desk, not dropping his glare. "So is he," Draco whispered.
Potter.
That silenced both boys, but the tension between them could be sliced with a knife. They continued walking down the stony path. Theo was right, with Potter dancing and yelling 'Voldemort' the students of the Death Eaters were only reminded of what exactly their situation was. The invisible pressure of their parents was pressing them into the floor.
"Just keep an eye on her, I think she's about to snap," Daphne warned.
The property was one of the least luxurious that was in the Malfoy name, but his mother had grown fond of the simple house, so in the Malfoy name the land remained.
He woke when the sun was setting a soft orange glow around the infirmary. Supper time was probably soon. The smell of a deep stew caused Draco's stomach to growl. He had missed lunch.
"Don't encourage her," he deadpanned to Daphne, who was sobbing through her laughter.
"Redeem myself? Why would you assume I need redeeming?" Draco's voice was dangerously low. He made clear that Severus needed to pick his next few words carefully. "And do you mean redeem myself for violence against another student or redeem myself for happening to have a relationship with Potter? Because both are not subjects that I actually need redemption from, so why don't you just save your breath?"
"It was funny!" Draco defended.
Potter smacked him on the arm. "Draco! Gross!"
Draco glared at Potter with as much intensity as he could. How dare Potter talk to him in public? Was he stupid? Potter rose, leaning over the seat to grab his bag, thankfully leaving Draco alone.
They walked in silence closely together. Draco gave the password for the Common Room, his voice gravely. They entered in heavy silence.
With a hand raised, their Lord silenced Daphne. "So…" he started, "you state that you made a simple mistake."
"I don't know gives you the impression that you can talk to me that way-"
"Montague, do fuck off," he dismissed with ease. Montague didn't move, "or do you want to make a remark about my mouth?" Draco taunted, baiting the older boy who stood against him.
"Would you mind if I ask why?"
He wished he could honestly give Daphne's parents his sympathy without splitting at the seams with his own grief. He wished he could give them the mercy of not forcing them to face their daughter's executioner, her murder, at her own funeral.
Her death was a sudden to everyone, including her, after he had taken her memories under her command. Her death was sudden to everyone, except him. To a murder, death was never sudden. To him, her death wasn't a surprise, but he still bled from clawing his heart out.
Potter smiled a gentle smile, one that was kind his pain. Potter was so strong. He was made of iron and steel without shielding his heart. Draco couldn't make himself into iron, but he could twist himself into something dangerous.
Draco expected sobs, or tears, but none came, only the feeling of a chill. Draco could only stare at the grass and dirt as he waited for the shock to leave him as it had before in the presence of Daphne. He sat up, leaning against the castle as he looked out at nothing.
Unless she betrayed him.
"Bitch," Daphne called him before walking away. Hopefully, to charm Montague into telling her what happened to him. Draco chuckled as he watch her leave, slipping into the crowed with ease.
"Isn't she dating Ron?" Crabb asked, "They seem to have something between them."
"No, it's okay."
"I what?"
Ding.
Potter grabbed Draco, "Table!" he whispered hurriedly. The Room supplied a bare wooden table in the center of the room. Potter shoved Draco underneath. "Table cloth!" Draco said, sliding under the table, he quickly Accio'd his book bag to him from across the room. Potter hurried to the door, opening it to let someone in.
"He's not going to last much longer. Give. Us. The globe."
He should stop talking to her. He was risking the identity that he had laced himself into to keep his life. He couldn't stop. "I suppose that is reasonable."
"Malfoy," a hand steadied Draco by his shoulder.
"You are such a dick!" Potter shouted over his shoulder. Draco had to jog to keep up with him.
A task that would buy him more time. Time which he was desperate for.
"To betray your family-"
"My apologies, Professor," she continued to seep the root as if she hadn't just cause literal hell for the rest of Draco's life.
Comments are loved and cherished forever.
"People are watching me too, ass," chided Daphne.
Dumbledore was standing with his back to them as they entered. His hands were clasped behind his back. He was wearing a pair of dark blue robes, simple for his usual style. He met Draco's glare with a gentle smile, "Draco, I'm so glad you could meet me. Would you care for some tea?" He didn’t wait for Draco's answer as he poured two cups from a small floating tray. "That will be all Severus," Dumbledore dismissed.
The Hall of Prophecy.
She smiled, "This is all pretty fucked up, right?"
"Don't you think you've cause enough trouble, Malfoy?" Ron harshly whispered behind him.
"I know, but…" Potter smiled. He was wearing cologne again.
'I made it,' Draco answered. Potter looked surprised.
Draco hid his smile as his stomach fluttered. This was a bad idea, but he risked a quiet conversation in the loud shop. "You haven't even gotten your tea yet and Cho looks like she's about to run, step up your game, mate," he teased.
"I'm about to stick a broomstick up your ass," Draco grumbled, getting out of bed to start dressing.
“The Fire-Making Charm? We are reviewing it for our O.W.Ls?” the man further included.
He looked down at his hands dipped in crimson. Dipped in the blood of his friend he had killed.
"I think you're underestimating your Godson, Severus. He has just proven to us that that is a deadly mistake," Dumbledore complemented Draco.
"Weasley wouldn't stop taking about it," she grinned, "but don't worry about your reputation, everyone knows it was a joke."
Draco didn't give him a chance to speak, turning back to Finnigan, but also glancing around quickly for any Professors. They were alone. "Excuse me?" Draco called out to Finnigan, who had begun to walk away. "What did you just call me?"
"I don't need to explain your situation," he argued.
"Over there," Potter motioned to a small table next to the fireplace on the far side of the room. Draco walked over from behind the couch, which was pink tonight. The smell of dinner met him. The table was set for one with his favorite dish, beef stew and scones. He started to drool immediately. He helped himself to fulling his bowl. "You looked like you were about to cry whenever Daphne took your plate at dinner, so I figured…" Potter trailed of, taking the seat across the small table without a bowl in front of him. Potter nibbled on a scone.
"See you tonight," Potter mumbled, all but running up the stairs.
Draco winced at the stern tone, "it's not like there's a lot of options. What else is he supposed to do?"
"We just have to get into a fight, that won't be hard. We fight all the time," Potter schemed.
Draco nodded, he felt a coil wrap around his lungs and stomach. His head spun, he pressed his hands against the bricks of the floor, focusing on the cool texture as he tried to breath against the claws raking his back in panic. When he trusted himself to speak, "Blaise? Is he okay? Did I-"
"Draco, I-"
His arm was on fire. It hurt down to his teeth. He couldn't remember his dream, only that the blistering pain was enough to shock him awake. Heart pounding. Gasping for breath. Tears in his eyes at the sudden jolt of his skin peeling away.
"Draco."
He was useless if he couldn't enter any of the rooms. Worse, he was so open to attack. What would he do. He laid his hand on the smooth wood of the door closest to him. Pushing it, but nothing happened.
His heart pounded in his ears. He pushed aside the nervousness that was building in his spine to focus on his surroundings. The footsteps were closer, but they didn’t seem to know that he was prepared with his wand in his hand. Draco was suddenly very thankful for every grueling moment spent with Aunt Bellatrix and Greyback.
Everyone got what they wanted. The Greengrass's were allowed to live, and Draco got to keep a closer eye on Astoria. She had already told her father of his involvement in saving her life, but who else did she tell? Perhaps a well place spell on her memory would help the situation.
Draco was given a worried look by his friend, but she didn't say anything as she  left.
Mr. Weasley's eye widened at Draco's forwardness. He glanced at Lucius before answering in a nervous tone, " Fine, thank you."
"This is no way a WE situation," Draco giggled. The classroom had erupted into laughter after Daphne's snark.
"You won't have to deal with me anymore. I won't try to kiss you. We can just-" a sob wracked through Potter's body. Draco's chin quivered. "We can just do the lessons, I'll try harder. Practice more," Potter cried. Gasping for air. "I'm sorry," Potter begged.
Potter was there, standing with Granger and Weasley. Draco tried not to think about what they were going to do, the dangers of their plan. Hagrid led his class into the woods, lecturing on the mysterious creatures. When the class arrived to a clearing surrounded by forest, he pulled out large pieces of meat from his bag.
Mafalda touched her cheek.
"Just tell me what's wrong? What is it? Nightmares? Your problems aren't that unique, I can help you," Draco proclaimed.
Daphne bit her lip, "I'm scared, Draco."
Daphne just stared at him, sending chills down his spine. She was pissed.
Draco sighed, he hadn't thought he would be asked all of the hard questions by a twelve year old. "Yes."
He deserved this. If Astoria stoned him to death he would be grateful.
Pansy then impersonated the only person at the table who, was in fact, infatuated with Harry Potter. "Oh Potter! Sit next to me! Sit next to me with your stupid, wonderful hair and your stupid green eyes-"
"You'll figure it out eventually," Draco said playfully. He had put out his cigarette and was rinsing out the sink.
His Mother gripped the memory, she was going to see. There was nothing Draco could do now.
“You’re bleeding,” Potter rushed over to him. His eyes were so green.
"Unstable," Draco repeated.
"Professor," Draco's eyes widen at the sight of his old professor.
Everyone left him alone. No one wanted his company. He didn't even want his own.
Draco's heart pounded in warning. They were too exposed here. Potter was the only one who could use his wand fully. They had to get out. Now.
Draco wanted to die. He heard Potter choking back a laugh. Draco could just leave, just walk out.
------------------------
"What? Are you going to banned me from teaching him? We'll just continue to meet in secret, you two didn't know we were meeting until Potter told you anyway," Draco shrugged, "might as well compromise so that you two can keep an eye on us."
Last night was the third night in a row Draco had woken to the sounds of screaming.
"Mrs. Zabini," Draco greeted.
Draco re-read the notes, he sat on a purple couch that had partially been buried under a mound of random objects. The smell of bubblegum emanated from something behind the couch, but Draco could find no reason to investigate. He wondered how many students in the many years at Hogwarts had found themselves hiding a secret in this room. Part of him was curious, so many stories could be find in the mountains of objects that towered around him. A stack of tossed away loved letters had almost manage to catch his eye. Long forgotten moments in the lives of teenagers. Had the Dark Lord ever hidden something in this room?
Draco's knees snapped out from underneath him. His screams ripped themselves from his throat. He writhed in white hot pain.
Daphne sighed, "There's no need to pretend with me." She already knew her situation.
“I would be more discreet about any and all matters having to with this certain subject, I would also take a gift when I am given one without question or needless scramble,” Draco growled, making their conversation seem like a heated argument to the outside eye. To see the two of them fighting in the halls was a regular occurrence, and would not be too largely noticed by the passing students. To see Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy simply having a conversation in between classes would be...shocking to the rest of the student body. The last thing Draco needed was to be seem as out of ordinary by anyone at this time.
He pulled away from his mother's concern when they heard the echo of hurried step on the marble.. He swallowed past the buzzing in his stomach as he recognized their guests. The Death Eaters and their families entered the ballroom  through a pair of  double doors facing the main hallway. Aunt Bellatrix lead the way, her black dress trailing behind her, a look of absolute glee on her face. She couldn’t wait to spill blood.
"Of course," Dumbledore thankfully dropped the subject of Draco's 'romantic chases.'
How would his father handle this? His father would have wormed his way into having whatever information he needed. That was out of the question for Draco.
"You know you shouldn't need a wand if you are blocking your mind correctly," she waved her wand harshly in Draco's direction. He blocked her attacks with the strength of his mind, no wand needed.
Hopefully this plan goes better than the last one.
"Let the man have a break, he did just beat the shit out of Finnigan. He should be rewarded," Crabbe piped up.
"Will you do me a favor?" Potter asked.
Potter smiled, "That shouldn't be a problem for you."
Draco didn't know what to do, and with a shared look from Daphne, he saw that neither did she. The alliance with the Zabini's was unclear. Draco could suppose that Mrs. Zabini would be wise to stay away from connections with Death Eaters, but this had thrown her and her son out of their social circle. Everyone was giving Blaise the cold shoulder in response, waiting to see how this played out.
"I know, that's what I'm telling you, I know all of this!" Potter let go of Draco's hand then. "I know that you didn’t have a choice to become a Death Eater, I know you couldn't talk to me over the summer, I know you are in a dangerous place right now… but…" Potter struggled for words.
"Nott," Lucius greeted.
"Such language from a lady," Montague tasked, Daphne bristled, Pansy sank deeper into the couch. Montague wasn't alone, two older students standing on either side of him. Draco adjusted, pillowing his head with his arm, resting his other hand on his chest. Right next to his wand in his cloak chest pocket.
A knock on the door stopped whatever was going to happened. Draco froze. Potter froze.
Sirius laughed. He had the laugh of someone who hadn't laughed enough in his lifetime. "Almost all good things."
"Do you want something?" Draco snapped.
"Well, isn't Draco an omen of death and despair himself? I think it’s fitting," Blaise joked.
"I hate you!" Daphne screeched at their Lord. Draco took out his knife. He laced his hand into her long hair, pulling her head back so that she was looking to the sky.
"Now, if I may, I must be going," Draco excused himself. Keeping his shoulders proud as he walked to the door. Severus held his gaze before he stepped away from the door, letting Draco by.
"You know what I heard?" she further baited. Draco remained silent, she never needed any prompting.
A cold sweat took over him as he swallowed, fear settling deep in his gut.
Draco stared at the man in front of him. Black sent him a nervous smile. "And you thought introducing yourself was a good idea?" Merlin, he was more impulsive than Potter. Merlin, his head was in a fog. How the fuck was he supposed to handle this?
"You're a fucking idiot for telling me," she snapped after a long pause.
"Severus mention you used his laboratory recently."
Potter turned back to Draco, "I'll see you later, yeah? Same time, same place?" he didn't bother to wait for an answer before he turned around, making his way back to the Great Hall.
Draco held up his wand. Severus dropped his tea onto the carpet as he jumped out of his chair.
When Draco didn't say anything, his father stood. Draco noted how heavily his father rested on his cane, his knee was being troublesome.
Someone slipped into the only other seat at the table, Draco didn't look up. He simply slumped deeper into his seat.
She accepted the apology he didn’t give. Why couldn’t he apologize to her?
Severus just stared at Draco, his eyes squinting as if trying to look into Draco's thoughts.
"You are putting yourself at risk for Potter's stupidity."
Send my regards to Ms. Parkinson for her lost, my thoughts are with her during this struggle and the ones upcoming.
"Theo," Blaise began.
Ding.
"Potter, poor, orphaned Potter. Don't you want answers?" his father spun his lies.
"My bag," Draco answered, "now piss off."
He tossed the watch on his side table before laying down on his bed. He would sleep for a bit then slip into the Room of Hidden Things during lunch. There was no use on working if his work was sloppy and unfocused. He was struggling to focus already. His back ached, the salved helped, but broken bones were easier to heal than burns. He turned to his side. The phantom pain of heat making him shiver.
He couldn't do anything.
Pansy was tapping her fingers on the table by the time Draco returned with his arms full of bottles.
"What? Why-" Cho tried to speak as she rosed to stand. Bones helped her up before the pair hurried down a hall away from him.
He hummed in agreement, not answering her original question. He scanned the students walking, looking for no one in particular.
"Why?" Draco was losing his patience.
She walked briskly by him, her eye catching on something. Draco took her hand as she made a sharp turn. He dragged her out of the dusty store. "Pick a place to eat," he ordered.
"Are you gracing me with your presence for dinner Father?" Draco's voice was laced with sharp innocence.
"Ah, yes, ah," Draco started, staying seated, "Snape needs us to… help tutor some of his less successful students."
Daphne took his arm, clasping her hand delicately around his inner elbow, the pair were the perfect sight of a respectable couple. Draco's stomach turned at the thought.
The nothingness of the night reflected the void growing inside of the small boy. He started to shake, he curled into himself, wrapping his arms around his knees. He didn't know what to do. How could he be expected to follow the man who killed his friend, a person he had admired? Cedric is…was, was kind, charming, smart, he could make anyone laugh and everyone liked him because he was always genuinely himself. He didn't deserve to die. Serving the Dark Lord is what Draco was meant to do, what he has been polished to do, following the Dark Lord is what would bring his family respect beyond all glory.
"You look absolutely stunning, as always," Draco flattered.
"Now," Dumbledore had stopped with the pleasantries over the summer. They both knew Draco was only here for Potter. He had no loyalty for Dumbledore. "Let's see how useful you can prove yourself. Let me see what you found out over the summer."
Whenever someone did sit in the seat across from Draco some hours later, Crabbe had to clear his throat to get his attention. Bentley discreetly jumped off Draco's lap without a sound.
The two remained in silent for a beat, Draco’s heart was pounding for an indescribable reason, his blood running in his ears. He was nervous, but the conversation was going better than expected. Potter was being reasonable, almost predictable, why was Draco practically shaking with access energy? Draco was suddenly painfully aware that this was the first private moment the two boys have had since Draco can recall, even if the scenery was that of a lavatory, the lighting was what one could, possibly, maybe, call romantic.
"Ever the fantastic conversationalist," Blaise snapped.
"Draco, wait, I'm sorry!" Potter called out to him.
Draco allowed himself to fold the paper before putting the note in his chest pocket. He rose, leaving the classroom after everyone else. Draco's stomach rumbled in hunger, he was ready for lunch. He walked down the now silent hallway.
Draco nodded, feeling a sick twist. Draco transfigured a bandage out of parchment to cover the sensitive skin. She gasped through the pain as Draco wrapped her hand with practice.  He reached into his front pocket, pulling out a handkerchief for her. She accepted the offering, wiping her tear-stained face.
Draco pulled out the bag which held the salves out of his cloak. Potter had to step forward to accept them when Draco held them out for him to take.
Pansy's eyes searched Draco's, trust was a rare, fragile thing during war. Draco waited, holding Pansy's gaze. Pansy pulled out of Draco's reaching, pulling out a letter from her uniform robes.
"What chapter summaries?" mumbled Daphne, her eyes  unseeing has she stared down at the same page of the same book as she had been for the last half hour.
If only that was the only thing he had done to her.
Draco didn't pull away from the nails on his cheek, "I'm alright, but thank you for the suggestion."
Draco licked his teeth, "Am I fair to assume that the event will not be a pleasant one?" A heavy hand was laid on his shoulder. A dry laugh escaped his lips for he could stop, "Of course this would hap-" He snapped his mouth shut so hard his teeth clacked. He swallowed, looking down. Firenze only squeezed his shoulder. "May I be excused?" he croaked.
His thoughts were pulled from him as he felt a gentle squeeze on his hand, "You're so quiet, what are you thinking about?"
"Do we have to do that?" Astoria's voice was quiet.
Potter didn't let go of his hand as they ran. Their footsteps impossibly loud on the stones.
Draco turned to face him, “Nowhere, I’m right here with you.” Potter smiled out him, a smile that didn’t meet his eyes.
He was almost completed with his meal when Severus spoke, "Draco, who did this to you?"
They hadn't talked since. Not as themselves.
Potter sighed, "Daphne did great today, I wasn't expecting humility from a Slytherin."
"Class is over," Theo stated with a roll of his eyes. Draco looked around, all of the students had risen, gathering their bags to continue to their next class.
"Yes, um, Professor?" Potter's voice called from behind Draco in the back of the class.
Draco didn't listen to the ghostly professor, but he didn't sleep either. His thoughts were too loud. The Dark Lord wanted to ensure the future lineage of pure blood. Arrange marriages were the best way to promise pure blood. Early pregnancies also promised many children. The amount of pure blood in England had been declining with the recent decades. More children from pure families were needed in order to preserve the culture.
He dug into his pocket, trying to find one of the objects he had bought with his mother. "I thought I should get you something you would actually like," he gave the present to Daphne.
"I would notice if you were a genius at anything."
Draco didn't have those answers. He didn't have any answers.
"Don't be so dramatic, Pansy, I didn't gut you in the town square," he was shouting now, he couldn't blame himself for this.
"Jealous?"
But the whispers were everywhere. They were swimming in tiny voices, just barely too quiet make out words.
"Didn't you lose your virginity?" Theo implored.
“Do I really need a reason?” asked the girl.
"But why?" Draco furthered investigated, "so Montague said some stupid shit, she never gets this pissed about it. She usually makes a comment about the cheap robes he's wearing and moves on."
As Professor Firenze continued, Draco searched for Potter. He was standing next to Weasley, as Granger had the good sense not to take this course. Potter's eyes were unseeing with deep bags underneath. His head was drooping towards his chin, Draco had no doubt that if he wasn't standing he would fall asleep.
Their hearts belong somewhere else, outside this house with the constricting walls.
The sound of hurried feet through the underbrush over the ringing in his ears. Astoria stood before him. She wanted to make him feel half the pain she felt. Astoria shook as she dropped the stone she held in her hand. Her eyes wide at the sight of blood dripping from blond hair.
There was a cross way ahead in the hall, he could break into a run down a random side. He was faster than he looked.
Severus objected, "I'm not sure what that has to do with anything."
Draco made sure to keep his face calm, "I read about it in the papers, he's going to make a full recovery, correct?"
"Stop."
"I know," Draco pulled him into a half embrace. His injuries complaining but he ignored the pain. "I know."
"I am walking you to breakfast," he stated.
Theo was looking lost, he motioned to Draco, a signal for help. Draco moved to step in, wanting to deescalate the situation before a Professor came.
"Does it hurt?" Potter whispered, he was so close Draco felt the breath of his words on his lips.
He was not that man today.
"Like what?"
'Should I be worried?' Potter wrote, drawing a stick figure with X's for eyes.
"You're just at the age where romantic attractions are one of the few joys of being so young," Dumbledore shrugged. "I hope I'm not embarrassing you, but-" Dumbledore leaned in, lowering his voice to an almost whisper- "I would suspect that Severus would not be the most tactful at discussing these matters."
"My life is ruined," he heard through the sobs.
Laughter that could be descried as an cough exploded from Draco's lips. He fake coughed into his fist to sell it. Daphne raised her eyebrows at him, her eyes wide as she glanced between the two of them. He shrugged easily, nodded at the chair. Daphne made her way to the chair, sitting with grace before digging her heels into the floor and pushing back, shoving Draco against the window with a thud. "Sorry darling, but I'm afraid I'm not that thin," she tsked.
Draco didn't stay to stop whatever Daphne was going to do to Theo. Instead, he continued his way to Professor Umbridge's classroom. The pair of them had a continuous early morning tea arrangement, an arrangement in the sense that whenever she asks for Draco's presence he showed. He did have her ear, though, which was imperative to staying updated in the news of both the Ministry and Hogwarts. No one else was going to tell him, despite his mother's insistent attitude on making sure he is well prepared.
"As if you could teach him better than I can," Draco defended, crossing him arms over his chest.
"Why are you even here?"
"Well… I mean, yeah?" Goyal offered awkwardly.
"Malfoy," Cho whispered despite the empty library.
Both Theo and Blaise were tensely silent as the three boys walked down the path. "So…" Blaise broke the silence. Draco ignored the way Theo flinched. "I'm going to assume we've all seen it?" Blaise continued.
