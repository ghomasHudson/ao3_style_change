Or at least, he was supposed to be. He’s supposed to be sneering, congratulating himself for a victory in the name of the Dark Lord.
‘Oh god,’ whispers Hermione. She presses her shaking hands against her chest. ‘This can’t be happening. This can’t be happening again.’
‘This love for drama comes from your side of the family, you know,’ Harry informs Draco, while Victoire films Teddy’s meltdown on her smartphone, giggling helplessly.
Even though the apartment is quiet and empty, this place feels so very Draco, from the eggshell blue of the walls to the pale, polished wood of the floorboards and the sprawling rugs underfoot. Botanical drawings hang in simple frames from the walls. The bookshelves are crammed with a collection of Muggle and magical books, some old and leather-bound, others cheap paperbacks with cracked spines. A generous-sized desk is placed next to the curtainless windows -
‘It’s not like it’s against Auror policy,’ Harry frowns. ‘I’ve checked. They can just have George partner with a Cursebreaker. But apparently it rubs them the wrong way that George never finished at Hogwarts -
Harry doesn’t kiss Draco, not once. He’s afraid of that dam breaking and of the flood of his love and desire and the decade of
Harry thinks. Some days he could drink half a bottle of firewhiskey and still taste the mix of duelling spells and Dark Magic. Some days he stands under the showers and wishes that he could wash all the blood off his hands, but he can’t save everyone, he’s not a Healer, he doesn’t know how to fucking sow people up again after they’ve been split open by hexes and curses, he just knows how to hurt. Today is worse than all those days put together.
This isn’t an attack against Draco. Not really. Draco just happens to be the easiest target - the only person who won’t fight back. And Harry - well, Harry’s got a leash so tight around his neck he can’t do anything but watch the torture and destruction of the man he loves.
Harry stumbles across the Room of Hidden Things during one of his late-night shifts walking round the castle.
Draco’s lips lift into a strange, sad little smile. Harry thinks he’s beginning to understand the meaning of that smile, and the unfathomable depths of the place it rises from.
The stranger’s gaze sweeps over Harry, and a deep groove appears beside his mouth. He shifts his weight from one foot to the other, a dancer preparing to leap into motion, and suddenly Harry recognizes him through the film of cosmetic spells.
He shucks off his jacket and drops it over the back of a chair at the dining table, before heading towards the kitchen. Draco stands by the sink, filling up a tall pot with water. His sleeves are rolled up to his elbows, exposing the dulling scar of his Mark. He still keeps it covered up in front of everyone else, and maybe he would still keep it hidden from Harry if it wasn’t for the fact that they’d both witnessed the worst of each other.
From where he has been standing for the past several minutes, staring deeply into the fire, Blaise snorts with acerbic laughter. ‘I wish I could say I was surprised,’ he says. He knocks his fist lightly on the ornate mantle. ‘I really wish I could.’
She flashes him a bright smile. ‘Of course.’ She tilts her head slightly, tapping her fingertip against her lips. ‘You have been to Mrs. Malfoy’s?
Malfoy smiles a strange, sad little smile. ‘You know I can’t,’ he replies quietly. ‘But for you, Potter, just for you, I’ll stay alive.’
A week later, with the help of a pensieve and a magical dictionary, Harry does figure it out. He storms in on Malfoy and Andromeda having their lunch, waving a box of truffles threateningly at Malfoy’s smug head.
They get married on a brisk, Scottish summer’s day roughly one year after their engagement, in the spacious gardens of their home.
Sometimes he feels like that part of him is a completely different person - a stranger standing on the opposite platform, waiting for a train to pick them up and hurtle them a hundred miles away. Other times (like now) it feels like he’ll never escape that wizard with curse-stains on his hands.
Harry presses his lips into a thin line. He’d expected as much when he sat down to talk to the Senior Auror.
Lopez & Lopez Secure Solutions is located in an old brick house that looks to have been someone’s home once, up a flight of narrow stairs winding up the side of the building. A menagerie of owls perch on the metal railing. Yellow, amber, and blue eyes watch Harry as he climbs the stairs and pushes open the door to the office.
Harry accepts this with a nod. ‘I wish I could make this all go away,’ he sighs. ‘Or at least make it better somehow.’
Harry arches an eyebrow. ‘I teach Defence,’ he replies blandly. ‘It would be remiss of me not to provide the children with any practical experience. And I would hardly rate a childish hex as
‘I am afraid this is a Slytherin’s work,’ Draco replies, offering one last smile over his shoulder. He gestures at Blaise - a subtle flick of his fingers - and nods towards the hallway outside the dining room.  ‘Come, Blaise. Let’s talk.’
She paces back and forth on the hot pavement, her fingers pushing her bangs away from her forehead. She makes a short, gasping noise in the back of her throat, and whirls around at Harry.
A ringing has started in his ears, and the corners of his vision are going grey and grainy, like television static. He’s so tired. If he just closed his eyes for a minute, wouldn’t that be alright?
Everyone heads home at around ten, and Kreacher chases them out of the dining room before Harry and Draco can make an attempt at cleaning up. They end up sitting together on the sofa in front of the fire, leaning against each other as the night deepens.
There is a study with large bay windows to let in plenty of natural light, and a living room stuffed full of books, and a bathroom with plenty of shelf space for fancy hair potions and a clawed bathtub that is charmed to produce lavender-scented bubbles, and a table in the conservatory where Harry and Draco can have breakfast on the weekends with the French windows open (if it’s warm enough), and so very many roses and violets and perennials in the garden, and a lemon tree with leaves that whisper in the wind - a space created in Harry’s world, just for Draco.
Draco’s fingertips trace in soothing circles at the nape of Harry’s neck, over the rough lines of old scars. ‘
Harry turns in time to catch the sight of Ginny flying in over the treetops, backlit by the low sun. She tucks her body down flat against her broomstick and dives down, brushing her toes briefly over the surface of the stream, before banking up sharply. She does a barrel roll over the geraniums, laughing triumphantly, and then practically flings herself off her broom. She hits the ground running, and Neville lifts himself up out of his chair, arms open wide just as she charges straight at him.
Acquafredda rises from his seat, buttoning his suit jacket as he does. ‘I will make the coffee,’ he offers. He gestures at the empty chair at the table. ‘Please, sit. You are both exhausted.’
Harry sleeps for two days after his release. He dreams of flowers and stars, and a circle of trees and a platform painted all in white, and then, towards the end, tall wildflowers swaying in the breeze and the smell of damp soil. When he finally wakes, it is to Draco smiling fondly at him, backlit by a halo of afternoon sunlight.
‘You’ve never asked me whose magical signature I used for my Anchors,’ he says. ‘And I never… I never knew how to tell you.’
He recognizes the man at the head of the flock - Smythe, the young Auror who came to Hogwarts the day this all started. He remembers tying the Auror’s shoelaces together, tripping him over as a joke. Despite the ugly sneer on the man’s face as he approaches, Harry can’t quite bring himself to regret it.
‘Diagnostic spell,’ Daphne explains. ‘Luna, love, do you mind holding this for a moment?’ She hands Luna her champagne flute and pushes up the narrow sleeves of her robes to her elbows. Her forearms are covered in tattoos - dark, intertwined runes shifting alongside each other over her pale skin. ‘I use these to read someone’s magical signature based on touch by passing a tiny amount of my magic into the other person and reading the vibrations, similar to how a wand measures its compatibility with a young witch or wizard.’
Maybe he’s a coward, but it’s not the right time - it’s not, not here in this hospital room, with its bleached blankets and the monitoring spells hovering over Draco. The words sit beneath his tongue like thorns, but behind his ribs, his love is a rose garden choking his lungs, blooming over his heart.
There’s a hollowness to the way Draco says those last few sentences, and his right hand clenches slightly as though fighting off a phantom pain. He’s as good as cured, but the curse damage was only half the trauma inflicted upon Draco by his piece-of-shit father.
‘You can’t be saying what I think you’re saying,’ Proudfoot growls. He stands up in a flurry of movement, the legs of the chair skittering back against the bare floorboards. ‘Robards wouldn’t do something like this.’
There is still half a cabinet’s worth of files to root through. Harry knows they will be just as unhelpful as the first half, but he has to try.
Proudfoot sighs again, heavily, and turns on his heels, facing Harry properly for the first time since he walked into the Great Hall. ‘I’ll give it to you straight, Potter,’ the senior Auror says. ‘Malfoy’s gone missing, and we’re pretty sure he’s up to something.’
as he arrives, the rustling and clinking as he navigates the kitchen with familiar ease. It’s irritating how quickly he became accustomed to invading Draco’s space.
As with every time they order takeout, he plates each carton of food with great care. He likes the ritual of eating together at the table with proper cutlery and plates and bowls. Draco once asked him why he likes it so much, and the answer made his heart hurt.
Draco hums softly and brushes his knuckles over Harry’s cheekbone. ‘Shall I ask it again?’ he murmurs.
Pansy looks up from her list and levels a scathing look at Harry. ‘Really, Potter,’ she says dryly. ‘Your eyebags could have their own postcode.’ She returns to the list. ‘Have you been taking any time off from work?’
Harry squeezes his eyes shut. He’s got no excuse, talking to Neville like that, but he’s brittle from the dry rot inside of him. It takes almost nothing to make him turn into something ugly and angry and resentful.
(He asks his therapist if it is unhealthy to put everything bad in a room, close the door, and leave for a bit until he is ready to face it again.
Updates might be a little hectic as we enter the holiday season - please bear with me, thank you, love you.
‘Y’know,’ Ron says thoughtfully, ‘George is more an expert on this level of complicated spellwork than I am. I’ll give it my best shot though.’
‘She’s a Healer,’ Luna explains. ‘Specializes in blood curses and illnesses of the magical core. She got into it after Astoria started falling ill.’
Draco cups Harry’s face with his palm, brushing the tears away from Harry’s cheek with the pad of his thumb. ‘
Draco appears at Harry’s elbow as suddenly as though he’d Apparated there. ‘Are you alright?’ he asks softly, pressing his palm into Harry’s back.
Yes. He visits his mother in Paris during the weekend - he gives me the forwarding address for urgent matters.’ She scribbles it down on a card and hands it over to Harry. ‘I have not tried contacting Mrs. Malfoy yet. Perhaps the Bureau has?’
(He hands the blueprints for the International Floo over to the Unspeakables and warns them that the Department of Mysteries will have precisely one year of exclusive use before he releases it to the public.)
Harry stands outside the shuttered house and stares at the chimney, the letterbox, the small stone path that curves up to the door, and he tries not to listen to the sound of his heart breaking for the
‘It’s always a little dark before the dawn,’ she whispers to him, her palm pressed firmly against the centre of his back.
It’s a little later on in the afternoon, so thankfully the shop is nearly empty. Harry’s a good sport about the whole Saviour nonsense - he shows up to benefits and kisses babies and signs autographs and gives speeches - but he does get a bit prickly after the tenth person tries to talk to him while he’s getting his groceries. Thankfully, nobody stops him as he makes his way through the colourful shelves towards the counter.
Hermione is the first of their friends to arrive. She drops by at seven in the morning on her way into work, bringing a coffee and pastry for Harry. He touches neither, transfixed by Draco’s quietness, his absolute stillness. He can feel the monitoring spells hovering above Draco, clicking away like the tiny gears of a hundred clocks.
Harry tries not to balk visibly at the sight of them. He’ll never get through them in this lifetime.
Malfoy’s hand is shaking as he takes the chocolate bar from Harry. He can barely rip the foil packet open. He drops it a few times, cursing under his breath, blotches of red appearing at his pale cheeks. Locks of limp, wet hair fall into his face. He looks ghastly.
As soon as the last person is out the door, Draco’s knees give out. He slumps against the counter, his eyes full of unshed tears.
Harry presses his heels into the soil. It is soft, still, from the summer rains and the warm, humid months. The earth here wraps around deep wells of old, quiet power. All the restlessness that lives in Harry grows quiet.
; Hermione’s face as white as the sheets tucked around Harry’s motionless body, Ron’s shock and disbelief morphing quickly into fury;
‘Really,’ Harry laughs. ‘I spoke to Michelle, I even met Acquafredda to look through your ledgers. That’s how I found the Lopez brothers and figured out that you’d installed the panic room in Narcissa’s apartment.’
Draco doesn’t quite smile - at least, not with his mouth - but his features lose some of their sharpness. He twists his hand around and encircles Harry’s wrist with his own. The gesture feels like coming home.
all of this, and what it all means, but he can’t run anymore, so now all his monsters have finally caught up with him.
He’s a little upset, though, that everyone seems to have received a lovely letter from lovely Malfoy, and he’s still wandering around like an idiot trying to find that posh little git.
heart is being ripped asunder. Draco feels as though he is made of ice - but they made a promise to each other and Draco can’t break it -
He lowers his snake carefully onto the desk, and the familiar rolls itself into a ball of maroon-and-white coils, tongue flicking out to scent the air as it regards Harry with tiny, beady eyes.
There really isn’t anything dangerous in his classroom at all. The walls are covered in large, colourful diagrams that shift and change according to the lesson, and most of the items he uses to teach his practical lessons are locked away in warded cabinets behind his desk. There is an enormous terrarium of grindylows at the back of the room, placed behind the last row of desks. His fourth-years take turns feeding them. Next year they’ll be released into the Great Lake and Harry will find a new classroom pet to study and take care of - usually chosen by a vote across his year groups. Despite his reputation, Harry is hardly the sort of reckless idiot who’d put children in needless danger.
Harry thanks Acquafredda again, and offers another apology for overstaying his welcome, to which the man gives him a long look, and says something like,
Kingsley runs a weary hand over his face and takes a deep breath. ‘You’d better sit, Ellis,’ he advises, gesturing towards the free seat opposite his desk.
They all look over in time to see Pansy downing half a bottle of vodka. She screws the lid shut, hands the bottle over to Draco, and stands up. ‘Pansy,
A pillar of roaring fire and rubble crashes into the air as the next explosion erupts from the street beneath them, consuming Prentis whole.
Harry whirls around and backs down the road, away from Malfoy. ‘Don’t come near me,’ he says again, feeling nearly hysterical.
‘Then we’ll draw a chalk silhouette around their shadow,’ Draco says. ‘If you’ll forgive the metaphor.’
‘We started out with charms that would alert the wearer if there was a hex or curse,’ Guy says. ‘Nothing fancy.’
The memories of the War, of Voldemort - those are dim when Harry is awake. But in sleep, they are vivid, embellished with details Harry wishes he could forget.
He pockets Malfoy’s wand and kneels carefully in front of the other boy. Malfoy’s wrists are deathly thin and his hands shake with a strange, unnatural tremor. There are bruises blooming on the inside of his collar. His lips are cracked and bleeding, and each breath he takes sounds ragged.
Harry closes his eyes, too, and the world with all its colossal weight disappears until there is nothing, nothing but him and Draco, Draco and him.
Draco lies in bed and does not, in fact, listen to his programs. Instead, he watches through the open door as the man he loves (unrequitedly) moves through his kitchen with careless familiarity. He listens to the kettle boiling on the hob, to the tiny curses that Harry utters as he burns his fingertips on something hot. He clutches the blankets tighter around himself and imagines walking up behind Harry, imagines burying his face in the nape of that neck, of letting himself soak up all that hot-water-bottle warmth from Harry’s cologne-scented skin. He imagines settling his hands on Harry’s stomach, and lets himself think of the way they would sway together in gentle tandem.
(Hermione’s face appearing in Draco’s fireplace in the middle of the night, tears sizzling as they fall onto the coals beneath
He leaves Andromeda’s home feeling as though the ground’s been torn away beneath his feet, and he’s freefalling with no idea of where he’s going to land.
Pansy sets the paper tray of food down on the table and pulls her sunglasses off, tucking them into the vee of her t-shirt. She scans the mess of scattered papers and the mugs of cold tea.
A few couples are making their way onto the floor, falling into the first steps of what seems to be an incredibly difficult dance. Harry hasn’t even mastered the waltz, let alone whatever
Harry extends a cup and saucer to Pansy. She snatches it from his hands and tucks it to her chest possessively, glowering at him as though he’s personally offended her somehow.
(What had actually happened was that Harry found an exploded Time-Turner on a raid with Ron, and though Ron could find no trace of the magic that made the device work, Harry could feel the imprint of the explosion in the air around it. They handed it over to the Unspeakables right away, but it triggered a deep curiosity within Harry that filled his many sleepless nights with research.)
He knows every last awful thing Lucius did to Draco during the war. He knows what Lucius did before the war, too, the subtler methods of breaking a child apart, ways that are easy to hide if you have enough money and power. Harry’s seen the other scars on Draco’s body, and it makes him so angry sometimes he thinks there isn’t enough space in his body for that kind of rage. He’s listened as Draco listed all the things his father has called him. Draco's voice was so quiet as he recited them, his eyes glassy, and Harry yearned to reach through time to gather that small, frightened child up in his arms and promise him,
Harry looks down at where Draco is gripping his hands tightly, and thinks about chocolate, and the strange kindness of simple gifts, and the heavy fog of his mind clears. ‘Remus,’ he says. ‘Remus was good. Remus was the best of them.’
‘We can’t recreate the complex magic that most school founders used to protect their buildings,’ Angel adds wryly. ‘I mean, we’re not that powerful. But we figured out a way to scramble the magical trace of the Lopez Panic Room, as well as the magical signature of anyone inside the room. Basically, even if you do figure out that someone’s got a Panic Room, you’re not going to be able to figure out where it’s physically located in their home.’
When Harry returns from the shower, Draco is sitting cross-legged in bed, staring at the hanging constellation with a curious, wistful look on his face. He opens his mouth, as if to ask something, but then seems to think better of it.
Pansy’s smile is a knife-wound across her face. ‘They said that it was weird I hadn’t noticed,’ she replies. ‘They said I had to either be a complete idiot, or else I was involved with it, somehow. I told them that was stupid, and they told me that I had nothing to worry about if my hands were clean.’
Hermione is curled up on the sofa, still in last night’s dress. She scrambles to her feet as Draco steps through the fireplace. Her mascara is a messy streak beneath her right eye. Draco isn’t sure if she’s been crying.
Draco’s smile spreads and reaches his eyes, etching deep grooves at the corners. He shifts his grip and so that he can follow the spheres of the Anchors to the soft, delicate place just on the inside of Harry’s elbows.
Stephen nods distractedly, bringing his phone up to his ear as he ducks out of the study and into the hallway outside. As the door swings closed behind him, Draco can see the man’s shoulders draw into a tight line, as though bracing for impact. The yelling is audible even from the phone’s tiny speakers.
There are more people around them now, drawn by the commotion. Astoria pushes her way to the front, dragging both Daphne and her newly-minted husband with her. She looks perfectly ready to commit multiple counts of homicide at her own wedding.
‘He’s in Brussels,’ Harry replies bluntly. ‘Where he’s been for the past year. It’s on his business card and everything. He does monthly ads in the Quibbler - Malfoy isn’t exactly in hiding, you know.’
‘Fine!’ Harry replies. ‘Perfectly fine.’ He kicks Neville’s shin under the table and makes the Herbology professor spill the almond-free salad down the front of his robes.
Harry turns to his ex-professor and scratches awkwardly at the base of his skull. ‘Spells don’t really take, sir,’ he explains. ‘But thanks for the offer.’
Harry used to come on holidays here with Draco, back when they were still reckless and young and eager to experience as much of the world as possible. Harry had never really been anywhere before, and Draco - well. Draco had never been to Muggle France, and he wanted to see all of it.
Harry runs his gaze along Draco’s handwriting. He’s read so many letters from Draco that he knows the phrases Draco favours, the metaphors he overuses. ‘It doesn’t really matter,’ he murmurs. ‘It’s better this way.’
‘It was an extensive investigation,’ the middle-aged man says dryly. ‘Ate up seven years of my life before we got told the project was being pulled and defunded. I work at a desk now, Mr. Potter,’ Marsters continues. ‘It was marketed to me as a promotion to match my seniority, but really it’s them tucking me away in a little corner until I either die or retire. I think we came too close to finding out the truth - or perhaps we’d started to uncover the depth of the rot in the Ministry. But I’m afraid that’s all I can say on the matter of Lucius Malfoy.’
‘I got a letter too,’ Ginny confesses, and then blushes when Harry stares at her. ‘Sorry, Harry. I just know, well, how you are about Malfoy.’
‘What feats are there left for you to achieve, Harry, that would make you finally worthy of love?’ Draco runs his thumbs over Harry’s scarred knuckles, over the stark white lettering -
They yank Harry unceremoniously forwards, forcing his arms behind him as they slap cuffs on him that climb up his body and pin his fingers tight, twist his hands behind his back and force him forwards, subservient.
Harry takes a deep breath and tries again. ‘I wanted something to remind myself of how it felt to be with you,’ he says. He chooses the words carefully, plucking them from among the garden of his thorny, complex feelings. ‘To be near you. Because I am happier when I am with you. I am more myself when I’m around you. But I also know that I should have asked you before I got the Anchors done. And I shouldn’t use you - us - as a crutch. I’m sorry,’ he adds, quietly.
‘Yeah,’ Harry says. He gets up, brushing off his jeans carefully. ‘Draco’s got a Slytherin reunion at some vegan restaurant in Soho.’
‘Yes,’ Harry replies, thinking of the letters on their way across the Channel, and of Blaise’s grumpy eagle-owl. ‘I’m coordinating. Delegating. Letting you bully me into eating chips and curry,’ he adds, pointing at the offending tray. ‘This is blasphemy. You know that, right? I can feel my ancestors turning in their graves.’
The double doors of the Great Hall swing open with a bang and Harry is out of his seat, his wand in his hand. Three figures stride through the long tables of gathered students, tracking in mud and rainwater. The Great Hall falls into awful, shocked silence as the men make their way down past the long tables of students.
If this is a love story, then it is at least in part one about the love that our friends and found family give us. Thank you so much for coming along this ride with me. I hope this new year is kinder to you than the last.
Smith was terrified of Harry once, when he was prone to magical explosions, but now he’s convinced the Anchors have diminished Harry’s power - just like everyone else thinks it has. They have no idea that Harry could reach out and rip Smith’s magical core out of his chest, if he wanted to - and god,
It’s become a comfort, a phantom hand pressed on the small of his back, an invisible embrace that shields him from the onslaught of the world’s pinprick-sharp magic. He learned, over time, how to adjust the intensity of the magical signature and make it a filter instead of a shield. It allowed him to pick up on spells and curses than the average Auror wouldn’t even notice - and it made him one of the best trackers on the force.
‘If you die before my qualification, Harry,’ Draco says, his voice forcibly light, ‘I will go into the Forbidden Forest, find the Resurrection Stone, bring you back, and hex you right down to hell.’
His stomach is a painful knot that clenches and unclenches. His head swims every time he gets up too fast, and if he drinks water that isn’t room temperature, he ends up throwing it all up again.
From the living room, Blaise’s voice begins to rise in timbre and volume, clearly rising to the bait.
‘Yeah, sure,’ Harry says. ‘Kingsley wanted to root out blood-purists hiding in the Ministry. There was a whole team of people assigned to that.’
He makes a wheezing sound as he stares at the floor and wonders if this is what it’s like to have a panic attack.
He’s developed a bit of a taste for martinis, now that he’s allowed to drink again. It suits him ridiculously well, of course. He’s started wearing clothing with buttons again, and now it’s all crisp shirts with the top two buttons undone, and pressed trousers and sometimes he’ll throw on a shirt-cardigan combo that nearly knocks Harry right the fuck over because,
From the Headmistress’s seat at the middle of the High Table, McGonagall looks like she’s plotting their slow and painful murder. Flitwick retrieves the salad and Neville spoons more potatoes into Harry’s plate. They have treacle tart for dessert, which means Neville gives Harry his share. McGonagall and Trelawney get into a debate about large cats, and Singh weighs in from her end of the table, much to McGonagall’s abject horror. The only booms that shake the castle foundations are those of the vicious thunderstorm wrecking its way through Scotland - but Hogwarts’s defensive spells hold fast.
‘Alright, alright,’ Draco says, holding his hands up in defeat. ‘But really, what did you do this time?’
Harry throws his hands up. ‘And what, Pansy?’ he snaps. ‘Are you trying to tell me that I’m going to find Draco because we’re magical soulmates or something?’
, Harry wants it. He’s always wanted it. This desire planted its seeds in him that Christmas after their first kiss, and he has a superbloom of stars in his lungs to prove it. He is
Draco drops his gaze to the tattoos beneath his palm, before he looks up at Harry, his expression unreadable. ‘What, precisely, does that mean?’
it. It’s a glorious thing to wake up to the smell of warm chocolate drifting up through the floorboards. Harry squeezes through the packed shop, shouting a hurried
, you will not,’ Astoria says, deadly as black ice. She strides forward, her eyes burning with a sort of fury that would make lesser men quake in their boots.
Ginny drops down beside him, her feet bare in the grass, the backs of her heels turned an angry red from the tight straps of her shoes. She’s exchanged her ripped wedding dress for a dream of flowing, silver silk that comes down to her knees and exposes her shoulders to the cool night air.
Neville reaches out slowly, as though approaching a frightened animal, and places his palm flat on Harry’s shoulder. He has strong hands, but his grip is gentle.
Harry thinks of his fifth years - of Reynolds, skinny, freckled and asthmatic, of the Smithson sisters, Hufflepuff Beaters, and Beckinsdale, who’s only just managed to beat his first Boggart - and he tries to imagine them going to war, but they’re so young, so small.
‘I know where you’re going with that, you sneaky little shit,’ Harry grins. Draco’s been trying to get him to quit the Aurors and go work at Hogwarts for years now.
PS. I read all your comments, they make me so very happy, I promise I’ll try to reply to them going forward.
‘I give up,’ he says, barely above a whisper. ‘I can’t do this anymore. If they want me gone, then I’m gone.’
you, Draco,’ Harry says, low and fervent, desperate for Draco to believe him. ‘With all my heart. In each waking moment.’
Harry feels a rush of love for his wonderful, kind godson. He’s not usually this emotional, but he’s sleep-deprived and a little giddy on whatever the fuck is going on between him and Draco (he isn’t eager to look at it too closely, terrified of it dissolving in daylight), and he doesn’t know how he and Draco and Andromeda raised Teddy to be so
never finished at Hogwarts, those classist pricks. And what does any of it even matter if we can save people?’ Harry throws his hands in the air. ‘I don’t know why I became an Auror. They’re all a bunch of dusty old farts with a taste for misdirected violence.’
‘Hm,’ says Daphne. She clasps her hands in her lap, leaning back into her chair. ‘I do understand you, Harry. When Astoria first got sick, I felt the same way. Helpless. Useless. Like I could do nothing but watch her die.’
Eventually, Hermione and Draco wander over to them once they’ve tired of dancing. Hermione is tucked beneath Draco’s arm, her cheeks pinked, her hair fallen free of its sensible knot.  Hermione spills into Ron, laughing delightedly as she kicks off her heels and stretches out her legs in the grass. Draco follows suit, sitting behind Harry with his shins bracketing Harry’s thighs. He pulls Harry back to lean against his chest, and Harry tucks his head beneath Draco’s chin.
Harry lets Smythe get about three steps past him, before he wiggles his fingers, wandlessly tying Smythe’s shoelaces. The Auror goes down like a sack of bricks.
Blaise ceases his pacing, turning around on his heel as he barks out a harsh laugh. ‘Oh, of course not,’ he scoffs. ‘Why did Robards order a sweep of Diagon Alley, Proudfoot? Why not just evacuate the area? And why assign Potter to patrol the epicentre of the explosion?’
‘What the hell, Harry?’ Ron frowns. He prods at the glowing orb with his wand and watches the golden runes shift and slide out of the way. ‘This looks complex.’
Paris is magnificent, as always. Every glittering part of the city demands attention - although this was what Draco didn’t like about it. It felt too reminiscent of his childhood, and to Draco, those memories are tainted by Lucius’s long shadow.
He knows the young man who penned the letter that he still keeps in his pocket, the man who stacked books in a Muggle shop and watched crap telly on Sundays and named his cat after the goddess of the hunt, because she couldn’t catch a mouse even if it climbed into her mouth.
Daphne tucks a curling wisp of her blonde hair behind her ear and takes a nonchalant sip of her champagne. ‘It’s a force of habit,’ she says, unrepentant.
Healer Thompson’s eyebrows climb her face. ‘I see,’ she says, nodding slowly. ‘So you believe a twice-convicted Death Eater is a good enforcer of justice.’
‘D’you want another butterbeer?’ Neville calls, fishing another bottle from the cooler. Above him, a plant that vaguely resembles an indigo-leafed weeping willow drapes its long strands over his broad shoulders. Neville bats the overly affectionate plant away with his free hand, grinning with boyish joy.
Harry hears Ron’s yelling before he sees him come charging in through the doorway of his hotel room.
‘I didn’t say I wasn’t free, Potter,’ Malfoy says with a small smile. Harry knows Malfoy’s laughing at him, but it doesn’t get his blood boiling the way it used to. ‘Come by at six-thirty.’
Draco growls and shoves ineffectively at Harry’s chest. ‘I’m going to hex you a new nose,’ he threatens, but Harry only pulls him close, and he laughs and laughs and laughs and laughs.
Harry thinks about Sirius, that night in the Shrieking Shack. Sirius had been the perfect picture of a wild, Dark Wizard - covered in tattoos, barking out every word through gritted teeth, his eyes were just a little too dark, too wide, his laughter off-pitch and manic. And Harry - Harry had
Because that’s what he does. He watches people die, and he does nothing to stop it. He watches as Dumbledore tumbles off the Astronomy Tower. He watches through Voldemort’s eyes as countless people - innocent or otherwise - are slaughtered. His days and nights are haunted by flashes of green and the sound of Nagini’s jaws snapping shut.
She sprints towards the front of the alley. Harry draws his wand, conjuring up a Patronus to alert the others.
‘A deal,’ repeats Ron. He folds his arms and leans against the wall. For a moment, Draco can see the echo of the Auror he once was - tall, broad-shouldered, grim-jawed and absolutely terrifying in his ability to stare someone down.  ‘What deal?’
It feels strange to be tracing these steps again, to fall into this familiar dance, but life is cyclical that way, isn’t it?
Harry wonders, faintly, if the hotel reception even understands the concept of privacy. First Pansy, now Ron - apparently anyone can waltz right into his room whenever they want.
‘Haven’t heard,’ Daphne says grimly, cutting Harry off before he can finish his question. She must be coming off a long shift. There are dark circles under her eyes, and he can sense the faint buzz of Pepper-Up in her veins.
‘It was a lot of previous partners,’ Harry says at last, quietly. He isn’t ashamed of it, but he isn’t proud of it either. ‘Hermione disapproved. It wasn’t - it wasn’t exactly healthy. Not that promiscuity is bad in and of itself - it’s just that I was using it as a way to self-destruct. But, well.’ Harry shrugs. ‘I experimented a lot.’
Malfoy scowls at the chocolate bar like it’s about to sprout three heads and hiss at him. ‘What is this?’
Harry isn’t brave when it comes to Draco. But he can be foolish, and stupid, and heartsick, and reckless, and tonight he can find enough of all of that within him to at least pretend to be brave.
‘Have you reached out for backup or support?’ Pansy asks, tapping the list twice more with her wand.
Coming up next: more mutual pining, and detective Potter continues his investigation, discoveries are made, and a LOT of pain.
Harry steps away from the window and sits, cross-legged, at the centre of his cell. The air is damp and cold, and everything smells like salt and mildew. The stones beneath him are hard and unforgiving, and there is a stain upon this island from the now-removed colony of Dementors. The chill threatens to sink into Harry’s bones, but he pushes it away with the furnace of his magical core.
Eventually Neville stumbles across him on a late autumn night, just before the cusp of winter. He moves to stand next to Harry, about a foot away, and he squints as he peers up at the night sky and its plethora of planets and stars.
And then he finally sees it - the thread woven through the tapestry - the pattern in the chaos. It is so well hidden, so artfully tucked away, that it is a wonder that Harry found it at all. But, then again, Harry saw things that nobody ever knew to look for.
Draco lifts his hand and brushes it over his chest, feeling for the wand holster strapped there beneath his clothes. The holly wand burns against his skin, agitated at being separated from its master. Draco knows that, although its counterpart lies entombed with Dumbledore’s body, he carries that weight too. He does not know how Harry shouldered its burden for so many years - how it never warped him into something monstrous, the way it had done so many of its previous masters.
Harry’s anger begins to boil, sending sparks of magic running through his veins down to his fingertips. An Auror should know better than anyone else how heavy the weight of survivor’s guilt can feel, and that the relatives and friends of victims feel it most. It’s part of the bloody training.
Harry’s not exactly sure how he’s managed to become friends with Pansy fucking Parkinson, but if you can insult someone like that, the way Draco likes to insult Harry, then you’re definitely friends. And Harry quite likes being friends. It sure beats the other stuff that went on in seventh year, because that seems a little too big and complicated for such a very small bar. It also beats whatever the fuck happened at Draco’s parole party.
There are no dark colours here. Everything is made of pale wood, and the walls are all painted a pastel teal, decorated with bright, colourful paintings of lush, tropical jungles. Narcissa shows Harry all the clever things her kitchen is capable of, the cooling-box hidden in her pantry, the extension charms that allow her to store a cellar’s worth of wines next to her spices, and the cockerel-shaped egg boiler that Draco custom-ordered from George.
‘Don’t let her fool you, Harry,’ Draco sighs. He links his arm through Harry’s elbow and leans over to tap his wand on the rim of the goldfish bowl, returning it back to its original form. ‘Just be grateful she uses her Slytherin powers for good.’
Narcissa isn’t quite as adventurous as Draco when it comes to Muggle Paris. She rents out a beautiful flat in the wizarding quarter, further outside of the city. Harry’s been there a total of three times. He’s grateful that Narcissa saved his life, but he’s not exactly on friendly terms with her.
(It’s not invading, not really. Draco wants him here all the time. Harry is loud and boisterous and hilariously snarky, and he has amazing taste in music and is sinfully good at cooking. He is the lighthouse in the storm, the raft to which Draco clings desperately, but the last thing Draco wishes to be is a burden. He has burdened enough people in his lifetime.)
,’ she says, and strides into the centre of the room, her stilettos clicking loudly against the floorboards. ‘Weasley!’
‘Alright,’ Harry agrees easily. He props himself up with one arm, fighting against the treacle-sweet pull of post-coital sleepiness. ‘Let’s hear it, then.’
Draco lives because a boy with eyes like spellfire grabbed him by the wrist and mistakenly thought him worth saving.
‘No,’ she frowns at him, seeming a little offended. ‘Of course not. I’m not in the habit of torturing my patients.’
‘Of course we are,’ says the Unspeakable, flashing Harry a conspiratorial smile. ‘Seven o’clock, Professor. We’ll be waiting.’
Draco breathes a soft sigh, and he leans further back into the grass, tilting his face skyward. ‘Before that point,’ he says, ‘I was doing rather well at ignoring feelings, you see, but then I saw you standing by that field, and you were hurting, and because you were hurting, I was hurting too, and I forgot the things I had sworn I would never do. Do you understand what I’m saying?’ he asks, glancing at Harry.
and shoves energy bars into Harry’s pockets because he forgets to eat sometimes when he’s overstimulated.
‘I hope you’re feeling as miserable as I am, Potter,’ she announces, slamming the door closed behind her. ‘But fear not - I bring sustenance to ease your discomfort and suffering.’
As the light grows, his grief shifts within him, growing teeth. He stands, his knees groaning in protest. It is cold in this room, and he has been kneeling here all night. He pushes his hair out of his face and runs his hand over the multitude of wrinkles worn into his suit. He glances at the softly glowing constellation of stars hanging on Harry’s wall, and his heart aches for the quiet, unassuming way Harry loves him.
timing.’ He drags his hands through his hair, inhaling deeply through his nose. ‘Right, fuck it, let’s go save Seamus.’
- Lucius is here, hiding in the walls of Narcissa’s lovely apartment, probably listening to their every word. Harry can’t keep coming back here without arousing suspicion, and probably putting Narcissa in danger. He might even be putting Draco in danger. He just needs a minute, just sixty seconds, and he’ll have the information he needs.
Harry’s gut roils. He wipes his mouth, tears stinging at his eyes. ‘I can’t… I can’t tell you, Pansy.’
Draco leans back against the kitchen counter. ‘Circe,’ he gasps, wiping a tear from his eye with his thumb. ‘Hermione can be so… so…’
,’ Harry retorts good-naturedly. ‘You’d want to get sloshed too if you were forced to work with Robards.’
Harry gets a tip about the raid as soon as he gets back into the Ministry. He’s had a long, horrible day of counting corpses at yet another bombing -
which sets Molly off. She slams the carving knife onto the table, hilt-first, and bellows, ‘NO WINTER WEDDINGS!’
Harry slides them on to find Teddy smiling lopsidedly at him, a bouquet of baby’s breath and roses in one hand, his duffel bag slung over his shoulders. Harry’s heart feels tender, like skinned knees and fresh bruises, as he looks at his godson. Teddy’s skin is heavily tanned, likely from the long hours working outdoors with Charlie and his dragons, and he’s grown taller, broader -
‘Minister,’ Draco says crisply. ‘I believe we had an agreement?’ He dips his head pointedly towards Harry.
‘I haven’t really had much practice,’ Harry shrugs. ‘There was always stuff going on that was more important.’
‘So, anyhow,’ Harry sighs, pushing on regardless, ‘I’ve been placed on cold case review while they find me a new partner, and I’ve been following a trail of Snatcher funding through five levels of shell corporations.’
Pansy’s eyes narrow almost imperceptibly. ‘Yes,’ she says. ‘I’m sure Potter thinks Draco is just the picture of saintly virtue.’
Healer Thompson nods and taps her wand on the clipboard. A fine line appears between her eyebrows. ‘Will you have somewhere to stay while you’re in London?’ she asks, glancing up.
‘I’ll find him,’ Harry says, because that’s how they are, him and Draco, Draco and him. ‘I always do.’
A sliver of ice slides down Harry’s spine. He knows all too well what a Time-Turner can do. Harry and Hermione had managed to save Sirius and Buckbeak with a Time-Turner that only went back hours - and they were just children with barely enough time to organize or plan anything. If the neo-Death Eaters got their hands on a Time-Turner that could turn back years - they could go back and change the war, save the Horcruxes. They could make sure that Harry never died in the Forbidden Forest. That he never defeated Riddle at the Battle of Hogwarts.
From his seat, Harry watches him, beautiful and untouchable as a fallen angel. Draco’s pale fingers draw a stark contrast against the dark wood as he braces his palms against the edge of Kingsley’s desk and leans back against it, without a care for the fact that it belongs to the Minister of Magic himself, and stretches his long legs out before him, crossing them delicately at the ankles. His boots are polished to a shine. He looks like a weapon, and Harry suddenly remembers the quicksilver way Draco used to move when he duelled, and wonders if perhaps in another universe Draco would have made a rather intimidating Auror.
‘Oh, for fuck’s sake-’ Blaise growls, and wanders out of view before reappearing in a very nice-looking dressing gown. He’s not wearing his cosmetic charms today, and there’s a thin line of stubble ghosting over his chin. ‘What if I’d had someone over?’
He places his hand on his desk, palm flat against the dark wood. The milk snake slithers across the desk and up onto his wrist, disappearing beneath his sleeve. Harry stares at the whole ritual in morbid fascination.
‘On what grounds?’ Hermione demands, more incredulous than angry. ‘Do you even have a warrant for this?’
‘Circe,’ Draco snaps, his eyes flashing with frustration. ‘What unattainable standard of martyrdom are you holding yourself to?’
Harry watches Draco’s face, thin and pale against the pillows, his body an array of motionless ridges and bumps beneath the hospital sheets. He hasn’t slept, hasn’t eaten, hasn’t managed to move an inch from Draco’s side. He clings to the meagre comfort of tracking the rise and fall of Draco’s chest.
Not included in this chapter: Daphne personally hunting down the Aurors responsible for performing the core-draining curse on Harry and unleashing all her fury on them.
Coming up next: Daphne-f**ng-Greengrass; playing fast and loose with Potterverse rules of magic; fluff; angst; Auror-bashing.
The grate on the door slides open with a loud clatter of steel against fortified iron. Dark eyes appear through the narrow slit.
P.S. I thought I was going to do full-on explicit smut but then I started reading these chapters out loud to my sister and I just… I cannot. -_- I can’t.
with how much Teddy is like Harry, from the way he’s put his chin on Draco’s shoulder, down to the way his voice trips over certain syllables and slows on others. It hurts in the most beautiful of ways to know that there is a descendant of the House of Black who is loved so well that he has become an amalgamation of so many different people - good people, people who are brave and kind and compassionate and true.
Harry’s about halfway through his patrol down Diagon Alley when he realises he’s out of Dittany. Ever since the Dartmouth incident, when Ron got hit on the arm with a severing curse mid-duel and nearly bled to death, Harry’s made it a point to keep some on his person at all times. He spots Goldren’s Potions ahead of him on his route, so he decides to drop in and restock.
‘Bloody hell,’ squawks Ron, and for a moment Harry thinks he’s spotted Blaise and Charlie as well, but when he turns around to face his friend, he finds Ron pointing at the opposite corner of the garden.
Harry huffs with quiet laughter. He eases his hand down to brace Draco’s lower back, feeling the muscles spasming slightly beneath his touch. He digs his thumb in slightly in an attempt to ease out the knots.
This time when Harry drops by Narcissa’s apartment, he brings lilies and a bottle of pastis. Narcissa frowns at the lilies, but visibly brightens as she catches sight of the liquor.
‘It could have been a lot worse, I suppose,’ Draco says faintly. ‘He could have discovered us in a far more compromising position.’
‘I’m starting to see a Mind Healer, y’know,’ Harry says, glancing at Neville. ‘We Floo every Wednesday night. I’ve started to work through some stuff, like-’ he huffs out a breath and pauses. ‘Like how maybe I was groomed to hate myself and that I was exposed to a lot of danger and death really young, and that was all engineered to make me willing to martyr myself. Like how I’ve been taught that love conquers all, which is why I’ve been using love as a crutch when it shouldn’t be like that.’
The Unspeakable smiles a little wider. ‘Oh, but we can,’ he says, and winks at Harry, like they’re both involved in this hare-brained scheme. He pulls a small envelope out of the pocket of his robes and sends it flying over to Proudfoot with an elegant flick of his wand.
Pansy lays the food out on the now-cleared table and waves her wand over it, lifting the Stasis charm. She has the worst taste in junk food. The absolute worst. Curry should not be insulted in this manner. Harry’s fairly sure his grandmother is about to rise up from the grave and box his ears for letting anyone feed him this. He’s read enough of her extremely colourful cookbooks to know her opinions on
There are tiny, scabbed-over scratches lining his wrists and forearms, likely from having baby dragons crawl all over him. Harry’s seen the same marks on Charlie’s arms and wonders if Teddy will also collect his own archive of scars, and if perhaps there’s no real way to keep your most precious loved ones from harm, only ways to worry after them.
‘Because of who you’ve become,’ he says firmly. ‘Because they tried to put you in the dark, and yet here you are, in full bloom.’
Harry’s head snaps up. He recognises that name from long, mind-numbing nights chasing paper trails through endless records and receipts.
Draco tries very hard not to look, but then Potter calls his name and makes a terrible joke, and Draco can’t
On a good day, Draco would probably feel exasperated with Harry’s characteristic stubbornness, but instead he just feels a wave of overwhelming emotion - a tangled, slippery thing that he cannot quite decipher. He sighs softly and tangles his hands in his lap, beneath the sheets.
to want Draco anymore.  Harry sighs heavily and pulls further away from Draco, trying to ignore the magnetic drag of his desire.
Draco doesn’t want to be in love with Potter, but you can’t outrun a storm - not by broom, not by train, not even by turning on your heel and Disapparating.
‘Don’t be a sore loser,’ Prentis laughs, folding her arms over her chest. ‘You lost the coin toss, fair and square.’
It’s funny how selective the Ministry’s memory is - but they’ve always been a bit biased when it comes to Harry. For every year that he saved the wizarding world as a child, he’d been dragged through hearings and reprimands as though he was some sort of miniature Dark Wizard in the making. Then, after the War, they’d slapped a medal on him and made him an Auror before he could even think about what he wanted. He was damned good at it, too. There was talk of making him Head Auror, before he left.
‘Shut up, Malfoy,’ Harry grits out. ‘I’m going to be right back. Stay here, or I’m not giving your wand back.’
‘Because Wicked Weasley’s not a qualified Cursebreaker?’ Draco asks. He’s listened to enough of Harry’s long-winded rants about Ministry bureaucracy to know where this conversation is going.
Blaise rubs his hand over his face tiredly. It looks like he hasn’t slept either, but there’s a lack of bruises and lipstick-marks on his body that suggests it’s not a lover that’s been keeping him up.
Harry takes a swig of the champagne. The bottle is charmed to keep the alcohol as ice-cold as when it was first opened. He sets the bottle down beside him on the wet grass. The aftertaste of the champagne is a little sour, but the air around them is sweet with the smell of rainwater and the green and mud that stretches on all around them.
Harry lies in the dark, staring up at the ceiling of his hotel room, and tries not to get sucked into the spiral of his thoughts.
‘I thought you were just being precocious,’ Potter retorts. He slaps Draco on the calf gently with the book.  ‘Making fun of my stupidity or whatever.’
- and he has blood and human parts all over his boots. But then Percy runs into him, red-faced and sweating, and babbles out that someone’s filed a report about Draco’s apothecary -
Harry looks at Malfoy and thinks about a cupboard under the stairs, about bars on bedroom windows, and comes to the realization that perhaps they might have more in common than he’d ever known.
Draco shivers. His mind supplies unkind words in the silence that follows, and as always, they resonate within his skull in his father’s icy baritone.
Draco lifts his head, and with practiced fluidity, Harry slots his arm beneath. Draco’s breath ghosts Harry’s collarbone.
Harry pushes his unruly hair out of his face and tips his head skyward. ‘Ah, it’s a long story,’ he sighs, ‘and technically I can’t even tell you half of it.’
He dismisses the cards to their place on the shelf with a wave of his hand. Draco looks just as lost as Blaise, but he’s hiding a smile behind his hand as he shakes his head at Harry, as if to say,
This is a happy ending fic, I promise, but we're about to leave the gentle fluffy hints and get into the gritty stuff. I might have to change my tags. We'll see.
Draco flattens his lips into something too angry to be a smile. ‘Blackmail the Minister of Magic into freeing my fiancé and putting away the people responsible,’ he replies, not bothering to hide the icy rage from his voice. ‘And then tip off every independent newspaper I can find before the DMLE can bury this.’
Astoria is a resplendent figure in crimson, a sliver of magnificent sunset next to her tall, quiet groom. She is so full of life and so different from the haunted, sickly girl of her youth. Harry can never quite get used to how different she is from Daphne - small-boned, dark-haired, with a face that belongs in angelic murals and dark, wide eyes. She welcomes each of her guests at the door with a hug and a kiss, handing them oranges and pressing flowers into their lapels.
They are as alike as they are different. The family resemblance is an echo of a refrain, hidden in the razor’s edge of their beauty and the uncanny grace with which they move. Andromeda’s hair is all grey now, and she wears it short, cut to her ears. Her clothes mostly Muggle apart from the outer robe she wears draped over her shoulders in a vague attempt at formality. But it isn’t Andromeda’s similarity to Narcissa that makes everyone stare at her in stunned silence. It is her disconcerting resemblance to her other sister - the one whose shrieking laughter still haunts Harry’s dreams.
She smiles at him, grooves setting into the corners of her eyes as she strains against her tears. She might not love him the way Harry does, but she loves him - deeply, unequivocally, in that fierce way that only she can.
Pansy rolls her eyes and grabs him by the wrist. ‘Potter, don’t start,’ she says, and Apparates them to her apartment.
It’s darling, it’s domestic, it makes Harry want to break down and cry and curl up in the safe embrace of Draco’s arms. He’s so in love it feels like a fucking Blasting Curse to his chest, but in a good way.
However terrible you think that racy drawing of Draco is, amp it up by a hundred. Now impose that on interviews of celebrities being forced to look at thirsty fanart.
‘Alright,’ the Healer says, after a beat. ‘It looks like we’ll be able to release you tomorrow - but we’d like you to come back for a check-up every week to monitor your recovery, if that’s alright. I understand your place of residence is in Belgium, is that correct?’
Harry isn’t sure which part of all of this Malfoy is apologizing for. ‘It’s not your fault,’ he says, because it feels like the truth.
‘Oh,’ says Hermione, struggling to her feet. ‘Oh, Daphne, your sister, is she alright? Her wedding, oh god, her wedding, it-’
Harry eyes her suspiciously. Pansy expresses her affection in many forms, mostly through the forced consumption of strong liquor, but she doesn’t do house visits and she doesn’t
Harry can’t feel his feet. Every breath is agony. His lungs feel as though they have been pressed in a hundred places with a hot brand. His ribs are broken - his spine too, perhaps, or maybe it’s the blood loss that’s made him lose feeling in his legs. He knows there is a wound in his side - but this has long since grown numb. It has been days - or perhaps years - since the world collapsed on top of him and trapped him here in this hell of dust and crumbling mortar.
Harry laughs, despite the heavy weight of rejection. ‘Right,’ he says, smiling self-deprecatingly. ‘I’m sorry. I should have asked if you want - of course you don’t.’
Harry feels a sickening lurch in his stomach. He sits up and braces his palms on his knees, breathing deeply until his ribs creak with the effort.
‘I’m vague, usually,’ Malfoy explains, ‘and she connects the dots herself. As far as she’s concerned, my parents were part of a racist cult. She knows I was tortured, and that I was forced to participate in cult activities. She doesn’t know about the magic, obviously.’
‘And you’re a fucking idiot,’ Pansy retorts, but there’s a horrible, tired sadness in her voice that makes Harry’s stomach lurch.
To call it a manual is an understatement. The booklet contains all the information on how the Panic Room works - its functions, the amount of days it can sustain people inside based on the number of people, the types of spells it can defend against. It’s not a key, but it might be enough for Harry to reverse-engineer one.
Proudfoot makes to get up out of his chair, his mouth already open to protest, but he is swiftly silenced by a single look from Kingsley.
, Draco mouths, and rolls his eyes in fond exasperation. He places his palm on Harry’s chest, pushing him gently (but very firmly) back into his seat.
Draco’s fingertips trace in soothing circles at the nape of Harry’s neck, over the rough lines of old scars. ‘Harry,’ he whispers. ‘I’ve got you. You’re safe. I have you. I have you.’
, dressed in a sleek black dress and stockings, her bob so sharp it looks like it might actually cut someone, in a pair of heels that look painful to walk in, but somehow it works next to Luna’s buttercup-yellow pantsuit.
because Blaise doesn’t have emotions, he just sweeps around looking handsome and being better than everyone else. He pulls off his outer robes, folding them over the back of an armchair, unbuttons his waistcoat, and drops into the chair with the same unnerving grace that every member of the Slytherin club seems to exude.
‘You’re scaring the other visitors,’ Daphne states flatly. She flicks her gaze pointedly at the crusting blood caking Harry’s clothes, the stains on the polished floor beneath his boots.
See, you’d think that defeating Lord-bloody-Voldemort twice as a child would be quite enough heroism for most people.
He pries open his heart and picks out all the pieces that have grown cobwebbed and neglected under his father’s rule. He writes letters, makes amends, takes all the gifts he has and pushes them towards making other people happy. He finds that he has rather a talent for it. He tilts towards it, a sunflower following the sun, and within him, something begins to bloom.
‘Excuse me?’ Harry frowns. He’s unsure if he hallucinated it - the Unspeakable hasn’t uttered a word since he stepped into Harry’s classroom.
Harry laughs. ‘Christ, no.’ He runs his thumb over the band on his finger. He’s not quite accustomed to the weight of it yet, nor the way it startles him the morning with how cold it is. He’s yet to find a suitable ring for Draco, but Draco says there’s plenty of time for that. ‘We haven’t even settled on a country for the wedding yet,’ Harry admits, shaking his head.
Harry’s fingers drift over Draco’s cheek. They are so warm they burn against his skin, and Draco shivers helplessly.
Neville nods thoughtfully. ‘That sounds like a treat,’ he says. He takes another drink from his bottle and sets it on the ground next to his chair. He leans back fully, folding his arms loosely over his chest. ‘So, have you set a date for the wedding yet? I’ve got to calendar it into our schedule and make sure that Gin has the week off.’
Daphne glances sideways at Luna, and a silent conversation passes between them formed of looks and raised eyebrows. They have always moved together in perfect synchronicity, but to see it now makes a bitter taste spread in Draco’s mouth. Harry has been gone not even ten hours, and he already sees his absence in everything - like dark spots of mould growing on a bedroom wall - and he
So Neville is the only who knows, really, why Harry left the Aurors four years ago. Neville knows who Harry sends those owls to every week, the same person who sends back chocolates and home-brewed potions and first-edition books. Neville knows why Harry is always nicer to the Slytherins than the other professors, why Harry tends to spend more time with the prickly, difficult students that nobody else wants to deal with. Neville doesn’t judge. He just listens, and he smiles, and makes shitty jokes at Harry’s expense and makes Harry feel normal.
Thompson smiles with blatant animosity. ‘Oh, I’m not joking,’ she says lightly. ‘Though apparently you are.’
, Harry wants to say. He’s not obsessed. He doesn’t think Malfoy’s up to something. He just wants to give Malfoy’s wand back.
‘Are you always going to be this insufferable?’ Harry asks his boyfriend, as the teenage park attendant climbs up onto the barrier and starts ringing the bell with all the strength he can muster with his chopstick-thin arms.
Teddy huffs a disgruntled sigh and nods. He trudges through the kitchen and drapes himself over Draco, groaning miserably as he leans with his whole weight.
Draco looks like he’s going to cry. ‘Who are you comparing yourself to? I’m hardly a saint, Harry. I’ve got a tacky tattoo to prove it.’
Harry scrunches up his face in an exaggerated performance of confusion. ‘I mean, you did?’ he says. ‘Who keeps their lube in the same box as their emergency sewing kit anyways?’
Harry recalls the chalky smell of crumbling brick and the overlapping stench of his own coagulating blood. He remembers the dark, and the horrible thought that he might never see his loved ones again, that he would die the same way he did in the Forbidden Forest - alone, and scared.
Ron is hot at her heels, looming behind her at his full height. Even as a retired shop-owner, he is still terrifying enough for some of the younger Aurors in the group to take a few steps back.
Draco has some ice cream in the freezer, saved precisely for days like this, because he knows that Potter loves dunking a scoop of vanilla into his chai like an absolute
‘We’re conducting an investigation, see,’ Proudfoot sighs. He glances at Harry, then looks quickly away, but not before Harry recognizes the look in the grizzled old Auror’s face.
They haven’t really managed to make it off the rug in front of his fireplace. Harry’s been drinking since he managed to stop crying. He Summoned the bottle over earlier with a wordless, wandless spell that made Draco’s eyebrows climb his face. Harry doesn’t like to do wandless magic in front of people, but saying the words, waving the wand - it stings, like a rubber band being snapped against his knuckles, and he’s feeling a little rawer than most days.
The momentum of being released sends Harry tipping forward towards the hard floorboards, and for a moment he thinks he’s probably going to break his nose again, but he finds himself colliding with Draco’s solid, warm chest. Harry’s Anchors chime pleasantly as Draco’s familiar, deepwater magic washes over him in a soothing tide. The roaring magic of the world and its ley lines and its storms recedes. His magic withdraws into the narrow frame of his flesh, blood and bone.
Draco climbs down off the stepladder and repositions it to the other side of the bookshelf. He laughs when he catches sight of Potter’s disgusted expression. ‘What part of the book are you on?’
She gives him an incredulous look, opening her mouth to tear into him, but she’s cut off suddenly by an earth-shuddering boom.
He finishes the countercurse, sealing up that awful wound at last, but the blood won’t return to Draco’s body. Instead it spreads outwards, reaching dark tendrils over Narcissa’s rug, out across the tiled floors of the Panic Room.
‘No,’ Pansy snaps. She drops into a chair and folds her arms tightly over her chest. ‘Just give me the bloody tea.’
Draco widens his eyes in a show of extremely false innocence. ‘And here I thought I was merely complimenting you. I was going to elaborate about how handsome and strong you are too - or perhaps I should stop while I’m ahead.’
‘I thought perhaps you might be hungry,’ Blaise says, sitting back down. ‘International portkeys can be a bit draining.’
‘You’re not rubbish at dancing,’ Draco corrects, taking another step back. Their arms are outstretched now, linked by their intertwined hands, and it will only take one more step for Harry to be pulled forwards. ‘You’re bad at leading.’
,’ Draco finishes for him. He leans into Harry, his hand sliding gently from Harry’s waist to the small of his back. ‘I remember. We watched it at the Odeon. I was horribly in love with you, even then. I tried to convince myself I could wait it out, like a bad cold, if I kept my distance. But instead I only fell deeper in love with you.’
‘Why didn’t you tell me about your disability?’ Mr. Blake asks worriedly. ‘I was never going to fire you for something like that. You
that’s grown between them. Harry’s spent years learning how to pine, he does it so well - he doesn’t know what to do now that Draco’s started looking at him like this, like he wants to reach across the table and taste the garlic and tomato and basil on Harry’s tongue. Like he wants more than a
‘I didn’t drink a bottle of Ogden's, Pansy,’ Harry says, glancing up at her, ‘unlike some people.’ He looks down at the work spread out over the table. ‘I have to get back to work.’
‘Don’t be disgusting,’ Blaise says, rolling his eyes. ‘And congratulations, I guess. Well then. Let’s get this business over with.’ He produces a small, glass vial from within his robes, pulls out the stopper, and holds it out expectantly.
‘Are there almonds in there, Filius?’ calls Professor Singh from further along the table. She’s been teaching Ancient Runes since the beginning of the year. Harry thinks he’d like her, if only she weren’t so damn American. She refers to everyone by their first name, except Harry, who she insists on calling
‘You can marry into a new family,’ Draco offers Blaise, a smirk creeping onto his face. ‘The Weasleys are a rather progressive bunch.’
Harry turns toward Draco, reaching out, trying to run towards him, but it’s like he’s moving through water and Draco is a hundred miles away. Draco’s shirt falls apart in strips. Beneath, his skin, his flesh, his bone split like butter beneath a hot knife as the severing curse rips his chest open. His mouth opens as he stares down at the blood spilling from his body, dark and impossibly red. It runs in rivulets over his fingers as he presses his hand to the gaping wound.
’ he growls. ‘Bloody fucking hell, Malfoy. I told you to stay alive.’ Harry glances up the stairs. ‘Come with us,’ he says.
‘Is that a snake coiled around your thigh?’ Harry asks. He can feel a faint sizzling between his ears, like a steak pressed into a pan of butter.
While the Weasley-Longbottom wedding was pure, delightful chaos, the Greengrass-Liu wedding is a hazy, midsummer night’s dream.
‘Keep this for me,’ he mutters urgently. ‘Don’t let anyone else have it. Don’t let them know you have it.’
‘We can also provide you with leaflets explaining our products to you in detail,’ Angel adds, just as Guy slides open a drawer beneath the desk and pulls out a small booklet with the words
‘Yeah, and school in general,’ Harry laughs. ‘I was a bit distracted, I guess. Basilisks, dementors, werewolves, Barty Crouch Jr’s dastardly plans.’ He puts his wand back in its holster. ‘That kind of stuff screws with your grades a little.’
‘Easy there, Uncle Draco,’ Teddy says. He drops his duffle bag onto the floor with an audible thump and walks over to Draco’s side of the hospital bed, placing the flowers down at the foot of the bed. As he bends down to give Draco a hug, his hair shifts from its deep auburn to the same shocking shade of blond as his uncle’s. ‘I’m glad you’re alright.’
Harry can see Ron and Hermione on the other side of the ballroom, running, running towards him. Hermione’s dress flaps at her ankles as she crosses the vast expanse between them, faster than he’s ever seen her move in their entire lives.
‘Get off me!’ Harry growls. He takes a few hurried steps backwards, yanking out of Neville’s grip. ‘Please just-’ he breaks off, panting, his lungs burning like they’ve been sandpapered on this inside. ‘Please just leave me alone.’
Harry uncrosses his legs and lowers his feet to the ground. He presses his palms against the arms of the deckchair, drumming his fingers against the painted wood. ‘I’m not abandoning my students, Nev,’ he says seriously. ‘And I’m not moving away from all my family and friends. I won’t give anything up. Not anymore.’
In classic Pansy fashion, she makes them both a coffee-liquor latte, sits down at the kitchen table, toes off her stilettos, and props her stockinged feet on Harry’s lap.
, something sympathetic and worried - and he pushes the tray to the side, peels Draco’s hands off the mocha and sets it down. He gathers Draco up into his grasp with one smooth, effortless show of strength. They slot together like puzzle pieces.
‘We both know that’s a lie,’ Draco says with surprising calm. ‘You were a bully and you were cruel to those who deserved kindness, but you were never one of us. You do not bear the Mark. You never swore allegiance. Your wand will never hold traces of the spells that mine did.’
Draco rolls his eyes and takes the other drink out of Harry’s hand. ‘You can ask for help, you know,’ he reprimands.
‘Oh, wonderful,’ says Acquafredda. The coffee pot makes a chirping noise as it finishes brewing. He gestures toward the desk with his left hand as he begins to pour the coffee with his right hand. ‘Put them on the table there so we can have a look.’
He turns the volume around and slides it across the desk towards his lawyer. ‘Tell me if that’s what I think it is,’ he says.
Harry swears he already told reception he doesn’t want to be disturbed today - but this is Pansy-fucking-Parkinson, who is second only to Hermione with her ability to bulldoze her way to what she wants. She probably bullied the front desk until someone gave her the password to his hotel suite. Or maybe she just broke in. The Slytherins have always been irritatingly good at lock-picking.
She’s silent as she cries into Harry’s shoulder, her fingers digging into his shoulder. Harry looks up at the impassive white paint that covers Pansy’s bedroom ceiling and tries not to think about the leviathans lurking between Pansy’s words.
Acquafredda tilts his head. ‘Not at all,’ he says, smiling pleasantly. ‘It is a good metaphor. They cast a long shadow - let us, hm, let us see if we can shine a very bright light on them. For now, we may start with Mr. Liu’s documents.’
But Narcissa keeps asking him polite questions about his work at Hogwarts and how Teddy is doing, and if he must talk, he can’t zone in on the background magical traces. He clenches his left hand into a tight fist and wraps his other hand around it. It feels as though there’s an invisible band tightening around his torso, squashing his lungs until he can’t breathe.
Harry releases the last bit of the spell, and the Lopez Panic Room gives an angry little shudder as it unlocks.
‘Remus was kind to me,’ Harry continues. His eyes feel hot and his body feels heavy. ‘Remus gave me chocolate when I felt down. He… he listened to me. He gave me somewhere safe to go to. He was so good, Draco, you’ll never understand - he made me feel like I still had family in this world, even when I didn’t know that he was friends with my parents.’
Astoria makes a beeline for Draco as he gets up to greet her. Though she is barely tall enough to reach his shoulders, she is still strong enough to squeeze the air out of his lungs as she wraps her arms around him. She smells like a childhood home ought to, like old wool and butter and flowers, and for a moment Draco feels an unnamed emotion catch him by the throat.
‘I apologize if we made you uncomfortable this morning,’ Draco says, breaking the silence. ‘I understand that this - our relationship - might come as a shock to you.’
He doesn’t look like the sneering boy who broke Harry’s nose on the train. He looks like a spectre, or a reflection caught on a frosted window - all pale and warped out of shape.
So Harry drops his awareness down, beneath the concrete and brick and steel and steady magic of the apartment building, beneath the foundations, into the soil and earth and rock below, until he hits the coursing, thrumming river of magic that runs there. The ley line calls to him, yanking on the threads of his magic temptingly. It would take one small leap, just one small, inconsequential leap.
Harry bristles at the insult. ‘Christ. Merlin.’ He stands up and shoves Malfoy’s wand back at him. ‘I’m just trying to be nice,’ he snaps.
Harry frowns briefly. He can’t imagine sitting down and actually talking about any of it to someone. He’s always just hunkered down and powered through the worst of it. Maybe that’s not the wisest approach. Maybe he still wakes up in the middle of the night with horrible nightmares. Maybe sometimes Ginny makes him sleep in their guest bedroom when he’s having a difficult week because she can’t sleep for his screaming - but they’ve gotten through so much worse, during the war. They’ll get through it.
Draco elbows Harry in the ribs. ‘It’s going to be fun,’ he says in Harry’s ear, low enough not to be overheard over the
Harry spots Draco’s assistant, Michelle, sitting behind the counter at the back of the shop. She looks up from her work, her eyes widening as she sees Harry approach.
In that world, he uses a curse instead of a disarming spell, and Draco wears an extra scar beneath his robes.
,’ he whistles. He hands the parchment over to his brother for inspection. ‘Never thought we’d meet you in person, Professor.’
to pick me as your best man. I don’t care how close you are to Uncle Ron or Professor Longbottom or if Aunt Pansy threatens to skin you with a knife. I call dibs.’
‘Are we alright, Harry?’ she asks, in that brutally sudden way she does when she’s attacking something difficult. Her forehead is wrinkled, all her freckles bunching up together beneath the sweeping fall of her red hair.
So he rolls up his sleeves, one by one, leans forward close enough to smell the detergent on Draco’s hospital gown, picks up Draco’s hand and sets it against the overlapping black curves of Harry’s Anchors.
Harry tries not to breathe a sigh of relief. It won’t do to have her knock an Auror out cold, no matter how deserving of it he might be.
She speaks in a calm, steady tone, but her eyes flash with cold fury. The unspoken statement is there, hidden in her words as she narrates the long weeks of being trapped at the end of her husband’s wand.
Daphne might be a horrible, manipulative bully, but she is undoubtedly the best Healer that Harry knows. She came up with a solution for his condition that wouldn’t only accommodate his magical sensitivity, but could also sharpen it into a tool. It’s pretty simple, really - give Harry something to focus on that is loud enough so that it drowns the background noise out. A shield. An anchor.
He wants to weep, but he already shed all his tears on the glossy ballroom floor. His mouth is bitter from the ruin left after the Aurors left. He wants to scream himself hoarse, but Teddy is sleeping somewhere downstairs, and Teddy’s suffered enough for one night.
Draco turns to look at him, his eyes wide, and this is perhaps the first time they’ve said it aloud, this secret, silent beast that floats between them, this hidden message wrapped away in confectionary and colourful foil wrapping. He smiles, and it is a bittersweet thing of both sadness and unbearable fondness.
Or maybe Draco does hear him, because suddenly Draco’s hands are on his face and Draco’s lips are pressed against Harry’s and they are kissing. It should be hurried, hungry, clumsy - but Draco kisses the way he does everything else, tenderly, carefully,
Harry turns to look at Narcissa. She’s watching them both with a keen eye - they haven’t gone unnoticed. Her lips drawn into a tight, bloodless line. She arches her eyebrows questioningly. Harry holds a finger up to his lips. With his other hand, he slides his wand from its holster at his thigh. Narcissa’s face turns ashen, but inclines her chin in understanding.
Draco is still staring bemusedly at the middle-aged witch as she exits the hospital room in a hurried stride that Harry’s come to recognize as a Healer’s polite method of getting their ass to the next patient bleeding their guts out.
,’ Draco says firmly. ‘And protecting. And you take care of people who need it, no matter what. And you’re good with Teddy and Rose and Victoire.’
‘You can’t flirt your way out of every argument,’ Harry laughs, pulling Draco close. He slings his arms around the other man’s hips, interlacing his fingers and resting his hands against the small of Draco’s back.
‘You could never be a burden,’ says Harry, as though it is a universal fact. ‘Not to me. Never to me.’
‘Why does your hair look like that?’ Daphne asks. She squints at the drawing, as though it might change shape if she stares at it long enough. ‘Do they think you’re part Veela?
He tries not to look at Neville as he hurries away, but he catches sight of the look of worry and pity on Neville’s face as he flees. He can’t stand to see it - he knows how pathetic he’s become.
Harry presses his hand into the damp stone as he looks down through the narrow rectangle of his prison cell window.  There is a storm approaching on the grey horizon - a behemoth of dark, rolling clouds and purple thunder. The ocean throbs with the force of its fury. Showers of briny spray cascade into the air as the dark water crashes against the sharp rocks of the island.
That, while disappointing, is hardly unexpected. The Lopezes would never be able to retain clients if they went around handing backdoors and skeleton keys to every Auror and Unspeakable who came knocking at their door.
Draco’s lips twist in furtive, aborted motions, like he’s trying to figure out what to say next. ‘I know you need time,’ he forces out. ‘I know that. But you don’t know. You have no concept of the depth of my feelings when it comes to you, Harry, nor their intensity.’
Draco shakes his head. ‘Nobody is untouchable,’ he says, forcing himself to keep his tone gentle. It isn’t Hermione’s fault things have unfolded this way.
It really is a lovely letter. Every sentence is poetry, every statement is heartrendingly genuine. Malfoy asks after Teddy, offers a few methods to deal with Teddy’s colic, and encloses a recipe for a potion to alleviate Andromeda’s arthritis.
Harry clenches his jaw. He pulls out of Draco’s reach and steps back into the light, back into the chaos of the ballroom.
‘Watching your valiant struggle with the most mundane of tasks never ceases to entertain me,’ Malfoy replies, reaching out for the box of chocolates. His hand spasms and he winces, but soon his expression melts into something lighter, more playful. ‘And the correct translation is life is
‘But,’ Teddy says, raising a finger, ‘I’d appreciate it if you started locking your doors if you’re going to get up to any of that business again. I have managed to avoid walking in on my dads shagging my whole life and I don’t wish to start now.’
Draco smiles - if you could call such a bitter gesture a smile - and cocks an eyebrow. ‘I should have expected nothing less,’ he remarks lightly.
‘What the hell is going on, Blaise?’ Harry demands. ‘Why am I really here? Why do we have jurisdiction on Draco’s disappearance? I’ve seen nothing hinting at wandless magic or spell modification in any of Draco’s work.’
‘It’s called gallows humour,’ Malfoy sighed, passing Harry a napkin. ‘My therapist says it’s a coping mechanism.’
Harry teased, and Draco laughed, and then swore, because his lip was bunged up pretty bad, actually.
‘Therapist,’ Malfoy repeats, giving him a long-suffering look that is disturbingly reminiscent of Hermione. ‘That’s Muggle for Mind Healer. She’s really quite good.’
Neville is still laughing when they dash towards the safety of the castle and make it through the front doors, just as the rain grows torrential and lightning crashes down just beyond the dark wall of the Forbidden Forest. The air is sticky even inside the castle halls, regulation spells be damned, and Harry’s hair sticks uncomfortably to the back of his neck. He runs his fingers through his hair in irritation, wishing it was just an inch shorter.
‘Not exactly,’ Harry says. He withdraws his hand from Draco’s grasp and leans forwards in his seat. ‘They could certainly make the time turner move back in time,’ he explains, ‘but it would be incredibly difficult to fit all the possibilities within that time into a normal Time-Turner. Like fitting an ocean in a thimble - you can dip the thimble in the ocean, but you’re only going to get the specific portion of the ocean that is sitting in that thimble.’
you aren’t that oblivious,’ says Stephen. His smile spreads until his cheeks dimple. ‘Ah. I see. You are. Well then,’ he says, slipping his hands into his trouser pockets. ‘Let me try and frame this in a way that your barbaric little colonizer mind will understand. You’ve already managed to piss off one of the most powerful British families, along with a truly impressive collection of war heroes - do you really want to make an enemy out of the Hong Kong Lius as well?’
Happiness is a fickle thing. It has a way of packing its bags and leaving in the middle of the night.
He closes his eyes, fastening a portion of his consciousness to the soothing hum of Anchors and lets the rest of him unfold. He can feel the storm’s power grow stronger as it approaches - angry, sharp-toothed, sparking with wild, untamed magic, and so vastly different from deep, steady hum of ley lines. He tilts his head back as thunder booms, close enough to make the walls shake.
They talk for a little while. Harry finds out that Malfoy’s still got one year left without magic, but that he’d rather get a new wand than take back the one Harry won from him. Apparently his therapist thinks he shouldn’t keep any personal effects that were given to him by the ‘religious cult’ - which is why Malfoy is dressed so very Muggle.
Harry glances at Blaise as he rolls into his second story. The Unspeakable’s expression turns grim as he receives the silent message -
The lawyer’s name is Anton Acquafredda, and he reminds Harry of Snape - if Snape had better personal hygiene, a better haircut, and a rather impressive goatee. He’s dressed in a smart grey three-piece suit, gold cufflinks gleaming at his wrists. A small milk snake winds its way around the high collar of his shirt. For the first time in years, Harry wishes he’d been able to keep his ability to talk to snakes.
‘I’m sorry I’ve been such a twat,’ Harry says. ‘I get so stuck in my head sometimes. It’s not an excuse, but.’ He sighs, leaning his elbows against the railing. ‘I’m sorry.’
‘What?’ snaps Smythe, on his feet and free of the tripping hex. ‘Do you think you could do our job better than us?’
They’ve never really talked about it, not properly. Neither of them is very good at sitting down and talking about their emotions with each other, Mind-Healer or no, but they are rather excellent at understanding each other on some bizarre, subliminal level. Ron probably knew about Draco even before Harry did.
‘He’s been looking for you,’ Luna says, when they take a leisurely stroll through the National Portrait Gallery and marvel at how full of life these paintings can be, even though they never move an inch.
Stephen frowns slightly. ‘Passed the national exam first try, fresh out of school,’ he says. ‘A qualification in alchemy is a prerequisite to join the Singaporean Apothecary Association.’
‘Yes,’ Draco laughs, pressing a kiss against Harry’s cheek. ‘I refuse to be out-boyfriended by you, Harry. It’s a matter of honour. Dignity.
and then informs them of her disturbingly detailed plan of how she’d like to murder the two of them.
Blaise rises from his seat and offers a wide, too-perfect smile. ‘Lovely to meet you again, Mrs Granger-Weasley.’ He nods at Draco. ‘I should be going,’ he says, tilting his head towards the fireplace.
Something changes subtly in Stephen’s pleasant, handsome face. Harry feels a chill chase down his spine at that glimpse of steel.
‘Of course you wouldn’t, Harry.’ Her eyes shine in the starlight and Harry feels a horrible lurching in his gut because he doesn’t want her to cry on her wedding night over him. ‘But Draco didn’t need you to ask. He’s always been there. He’s there each and every time the rest of us couldn’t be, and you never had to ask him.’
Acquafredda waves his wand in a lazy semicircle above his head. Many black volumes fly from the floor-to-ceiling shelves behind him, and hover around him in a wide arc. Numbers are printed onto the front of each ledger in an indecipherable code, probably known only to the lawyer.
‘Merlin’s saggy tits,’ Pansy curses, whipping around to glare at her extractor fan. ‘A listening spell? Are you taking the piss?’
‘We got a good laugh out of your outburst,’ Ron grins. ‘I liked the bit where you made the witness stand explode. Very theatrical.’
Malfoy tilts his head slightly as he studies Harry carefully. His eyes are so pale they might have no colour at all.  ‘You are?’
‘Oh, if you must,’ Malfoy sighs, rolling his eyes dramatically. He sets his wrist in Harry’s grip, turning his palm skyward. ‘I don’t know why you insist on this ritual every time we meet. It’s really quite tedious.’
(Harry’s laughter, brilliant and golden as it echoes through Draco’s living room over the tinny Christmas music from the wireless -
‘Yeah,’ Harry sighs. ‘Hence, that monstrosity.’ He waves a hand at the magical sphere floating in his hotel room.
Draco turns his gaze upon Daphne, annoyance flitting over his face. ‘I thought I told you not to do that shit.’
There is a moment that Draco clings onto, one that perhaps even Harry has forgotten about, and it is this:
Draco’s grip is vice-like around Harry’s hand as the Healer pulls out her records and reads out Draco’s medical report, and then describes the emergency procedures she had to take during the long, gruelling hours of saving Draco’s life.
From her seat beside the bench, Hermione sniffs and brushes an invisible speck of dust off her pristine robes. Sometimes her mastery of the courtroom frightens Harry - she plays people like Ron plays chess, only with greater ruthlessness.
‘Prat,’ Harry says without venom. He drops into the chair next to Malfoy and holds out his hand. ‘Let me see.’
In a way, Harry’s not different from the Room of Hidden Things. If there was ever anything great about Harry, it’s long since been lost in the fire.
Malfoy stares at him for a while, mouth open, eyes bloodshot, his left hand still clenched at the rim of the sink. Then, like a puppet with all its strings cut, he collapses in a heap on the cold floor. He’s so small, suddenly. So thin. His skin is so paper-translucent that Harry can count all the veins at his wrists and neck.
Harry lifts his head from the safe oblivion of his hands, pulls off his glasses and rubs the bridge of his nose. ‘I bet she’s happy about that,’ he sighs.
Draco allows himself to watch Astoria and Acquafredda for a bit, as the latter launches into the beginnings of the explanation of what they have uncovered. He nods to himself and turns away, walking towards the bay windows on the other end of the study. The curtains are half-drawn, revealing the distant, glittering view of the Shard as it catches the last shimmering rays of the sunset. Time seems to have travelled in strange hops and skips - though that might just be the sleep deprivation finally getting to Draco. He feels untethered, as though in any moment he might start drifting up into the vastness of the sky.
Draco studies his friend’s face for a beat, and it seems like he’s spotted something there that is undetectable to Harry.
‘Hello, Longbottom,’ Draco says, awarding Neville a small but genuine smile. He tires easily, even with the various energy-bolstering potions he’s been given. ‘How is the summer term going?’
‘They were rather rude, weren’t they?’ Luna pipes up. She takes a spoonful of Harry’s blood orange sorbet and dumps it into her butter-popcorn parfait. ‘I wonder what inspired them to behave that way. It’s very odd.’
Harry presses a kiss against Draco’s shoulder. There is a freckle there, at the rise where his clavicle meets his arm. ‘Yes?’ he replies.
Daphne seems to sense it too, her dark eyes narrowing in displeasure as she surveys him. ‘Hm.’ She digs around in the pockets of her lime-green robes and shoves a small bronze coin at him. ‘Here’s the pass for the showers. Go get cleaned up.’
’ Draco laughs, sounding just as breathless as Harry. He steps away, slightly, and tugs on Harry’s hand, still clasped tightly in his own. ‘Would you like to get some air?’
This time, they get to celebrate their engagement properly, with all their friends and a bottle of champagne. It’s rather tame in comparison to the jaunts of their youth. Pansy doesn’t yell at anyone, and Ginny doesn’t tackle Harry even once.
Their first trip mostly involved standing in queues. They queued to go up the Eiffel Tower, passing the time by chatting about Draco’s bizarre obsession with the mechanics of the Starship Enterprise. They queued in the snow to visit the Louvre, and for Notre Dame, and for the Musée d’Orsay. They stood in line for a whole hour in the muggy heat, waiting to get into the Palace of Versailles, before the heavens opened. Nobody else around them understood why two young men would find torrential rain quite so funny, but then they probably never lived in a world where getting rained on is a choice.
The stars that hang in the sky above them are vast in number, incomprehensibly so, and each time Harry glances up at them in search of some kind of answer, some kind of direction, they just spin out above him in kaleidoscopic fashion until he is nauseous from the momentum.
The first floor is only the waiting room - Draco makes all his potions to-order after his clients discuss their requirements with him. The stairs are round the back and can only be accessed with a password. There are a few comfortable-looking benches and a number of plain, understated armchairs resting around the room. There are flowers everywhere, and the air smells like spring.
‘Ronald!’ shouts George from the other side of the room. He waves his tea around, causing some of it to spill over onto the polished floorboards. ‘I’ve got a fantastic idea. It’s genius, really.’
‘Alright,’ Harry nods. That gives him ample time to Apparate to Grimmauld Place, change out of his robes, and pop back here. ‘Fancy a pint?’
Blaise, from his nonplussed expression, clearly never had to endure the banality of having to colour in a poorly-photocopied flow chart of cartoon droplets falling from clouds into a cartoon ocean.
‘Just try and stay alive, Malfoy,’ he growls, whirling on his heel and making for the exit. ‘I’m sick of watching people die.’
“Well yes, but how about we start with dinner at my house tomorrow? I’ll cook and we can just talk. Catch up if you will. Let’s start with that before we decide to take weekend international getaways,” chuckled Harry.
Suddenly as Harry was turning around, he found himself knocked backwards by the force of a six-year-old Teddy Lupin crashing into him and grabbing him around the middle. “Hey, Teddy how are you little man?”
“Well, it is good for Scorp to have a playmate around his age, who knows maybe he will be introduced to the other Weasley children, the oldest has children around that age as well as does Ronald.”
Looking at his watch Draco said, “well we have been sitting here for almost an hour and a half. The boys probably got bored waiting for us to finish, and Andy and my mother didn’t want to interrupt us, since they have been scheming to get us to talk for weeks.”
“All of those are very good points, Draco,” said Harry. “Fine, tell Scorpius and Teddy that I will see all of you guys tomorrow. It’s not as if I have anything better to do. What time are you guys going to be heading out to London?”
Proudfoot’s irritation is tangible by the time Harry finishes lacing up his shoes. The Auror impatiently pushes open the door and waves in two of the prison guards, giving them instructions in sharp, quick commands. They lock his arms behind his back with the same magical cuffs, pinning his fingers in place with metal braces. Harry can guess that it is to prevent him from gesturing and performing wandless magic - and maybe also to serve as a petty method of psychological warfare. To make him feel helpless. Small. Powerless. A butterfly pinned within a display case.
‘Thank you,’ Malfoy replies, setting the jar of eyes down on the counter. ‘I’ve been helping out here in exchange for curse damage treatment. I can’t do any brewing yet, on account of the tremors, but it’s as good as an apprenticeship.’ He frowns as he studies Harry. ‘You look tired.’
‘Pretty good,’ Stephen replies, frowning slightly. He tucks his hands in his trouser pockets, tilting his head slightly as he glances between Draco, Blaise, and Acquafredda. ‘Has to be, with my family’s line of work.’
The clouds roll off the moon and silver light spills down over them, kissing the tips of Draco’s lashes as he looks at Harry - looks
There is a hollowness that lives inside of him - a crevice formed by the force of his self-hatred, deepened by pain and exhaustion. It makes him feel cold even in the warmest hours of the day, even when his hands are hovering above the licking flames in the fireplace (close enough to singe his palms, but that’s what potions and salves are for, to heal the marks, hide the evidence). He wanders through this empty manor and feels that hollowness expand until it consumes every last bit of him. He wants to fall into the long shadows of this place and never re-emerge.
My hc is that Astoria and Draco are probably the same kind of friends as Luna and Harry. Also, IQ84 is just so very weird and not in a fun way.
There are plenty of other marks on his body - on his hands, where his knife slipped when potion-making, burns on his palms and calluses, too, and a bunch of old, faded scars on his thighs from where Artemis decided to express her displeasure at being made to have a bath. And, of course, Buckbeak’s handiwork on his arm. And then there’s the tattoo he decided to get when he was absolutely plastered and Pansy was having
‘Harry Potter, performing actual investigative work?’ Draco drawls, leaning back into his chair. A lock of white-blonde hair falls charmingly into his eyes. ‘Will wonders never cease?’
“Well, I don’t know if you really can label Blaise, he probably wouldn’t appreciate it. The thing with Blaise is that he loves the finer things in life. He also is attracted to those who he thinks are beautiful, and that doesn’t exclude those who he sees as beautiful on the inside too. He’s kind of a romantic like that. He has ideals that people should follow. Probably from his sketchy upbringing. His mother was someone who looked at her husbands as a means as an end. They were someone to raise her status in society through station and wealth. Which is probably why she never sought to follow Voldemort and Death Eaters, she saw them as just lowly thugs, and didn’t really involve herself with the politics of it all, thus keeping Blaise out of it. She knew the realities that there were muggles out there that had even more money and power than even the most influential of wizarding families, why should the fact that they can’t preform magic effect the way that they make their wealth or control and run a country? I mean looking back on it, she had a point. Alas, hindsight is 20/20 isn’t it?” explained Draco.
A young female house elf dressed in a frilly pink dress with a white apron with lace border appeared in front of him. “Yes, Master Draco! How can I serve you?”
“Of course, he has a bedroom here and he can just spend the night here,” replied Narcissa before looking over at Andromeda. “Would you and Teddy like to spend the night? Scorpius could probably use a playmate. And we can get up to mischief and drink the expensive wine and gossip like we used to as girls.”
“Draco my Dragon, I know there wasn’t beyond a loving friendship between you and Astoria, and I will forever be grateful for her sacrifice to give us Scorpius, but you cannot live with this guilt for the rest of your life. You deserve to love and be loved. And so, does Scorpius. He loves you so much but he needs more. What is going to happen when he starts at Hogwarts?” argued his mother.
As Harry passed Florish and Blotts, Harry decided to take care of his business at Gringotts first before going and retrieving his book that he had ordered the week before. Maybe after he would go to Florean Fortescue’s and get a sundae and sit out on the terrace and spend some time reading his book. It was a beautiful early May morning and he knew he would enjoy the nice weather while it was available. He had spent so much time in the past few months in the bitter cold of Northern China that the change in climate had been most welcome.
“Kreacher be thinking that you should go take a walk after dinner, being a little more active may bring some clarity to whatever is on your mind.”
“Oh, Harry it’s so good to see you, we heard that you were back in the country. What have you brought with you?” asked Andy.
“Okay,” said Draco defeatedly. He got up off the steps and made his way to pass Harry. “Owl me if you would like to get coffee or something. Athena will be able to find me.”
After finishing his rather filling dinner, Draco decided that it would be a good idea to head out and take an evening stroll, if nothing else than to help digest the large dinner he had partaken. Reaching for his blazer and wand he got up and left his flat disapparating into the abandoned streets of London.
