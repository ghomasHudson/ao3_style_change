“The same Robards who kept insisting that there was no room in the budget for any overtime?” Draco asked drily. “Yes, I’m sure he’ll be very responsive to that request.”
“Any sign of intoxicants?”
Malfoy hummed encouragingly from behind him, acknowledging that he was listening. Harry continued pulling the clay steadily higher; he found it helped to focus on it as he kept talking.
Harry noticed the look he shared with Hermione, because he was a good Auror and picked up on things like that. He was pretty sure it meant “Don’t get him started again” in that secret shared code that people who had been close partners for a long time developed. Some of the other Aurors in the office who had been together for ages did it too. Harry thought they looked ridiculous and took a swig from his glass bitterly.
“Mmm,” Draco said. “Listen, do you want to take a break? We should talk about something.”
“It’s… probably not all from that one case,” Harry said desperately.
Potter let out a long breath. “I can’t believe you,” he said, but he opened the book anyway and began to read it. He was remarkably pliant now that Draco wasn’t trying to win a battle of wills against his dream brain. As positive reinforcement, Draco ran his hands down Potter’s chest again, stopping to cup and squeeze the man’s swelling cock through his jeans when he reached the bottom.
utilitarian exchange from Potter’s perspective either.
“Dunno.” Harry shrugged, bewildered. “Like… clay? I’m pressing my fingers into the clay. What else would it feel like?”
“Something like this pottery class could be helpful,” she said. “I think you could benefit from an outlet, because it doesn’t sound like you have anything besides your work right now."
“What, a small bowl or a big bowl?” Malfoy asked, smirking. “Don’t want to rush that decision.”
He allowed the reading to wash over him, listening to the rise and fall of the priest’s voice and the cadence of her sentences, content to simply exist for a few moments without other cares. He found himself wondering what Draco thought of all this, whether visiting this church was only a Christmas tradition for him, or if he regularly attended on Sundays as well. Given how tightly Draco hewed to structure and order in his work life, it didn’t seem particularly likely that Draco would just turn up to any old church for the religious equivalent of a one night stand. Then again, Harry no longer felt confident that he knew his partner as well as he had believed he did. Draco continued to surprise him.
“Good morning,” he said. It didn’t even come out harshly, but Harry still suspected that he was being judged for his tardiness.
be considered an emergency. It would certainly give Harry the ability to deliver the wand to him quickly and not look like a creeper, just a helpful Auror looking out for his partner’s well-being. That was fine, wasn’t it?
“And anyways, Pansy Parkinson’s there, so they can, you know, have some Slytherin time or something—”
Looking at the proto-wand on the lathe, he abruptly realizes that he has forgotten to sand it down. He silently berates himself for a moment; Malfoy had made him so flustered that he had been about to rush through the next steps, and that was a very risky path. He won't allow it to happen again.
Harry decided to lead with the least incriminating fact. “You left your—” he began, then looked around quickly. He didn’t
Draco shrugs. “I try not to get my hopes up,” he says. The way Harry’s face closes off, he thinks it might have been too honest. Harry abruptly turns and walks down the hallway before Draco can say anything to soften it, and he sighs and picks Harry’s robes off the floor. He can explain what he meant in the morning, when they’re both better rested.
Andromeda and Hermione had interrupted their conversation to watch them, and they now made their way towards Harry and Draco.
The man paused as he grasped a flask. “Oh good lord,” he said, unexpectedly sounding exasperated. “You’re an Auror?”
Malfoy stepped backwards to let Harry pass. “I’m often here early,” he said. “When I don’t sleep well… anyways, I find the space to be a good distraction.”
on the box so it would stop trying to burst past his legs.
“Ok, so you were reading wixmail, and… what? You just suddenly passed out?”
Draco leaned back in his chair, stretching out his back muscles, and looked over at Harry. “I see nothing to toast here,” he said testily. “Merely a slow death by papercuts.”
The room itself wasn’t particularly large. Various shelves situated against the walls held rows of bowls and cups and other creations, and there was a sink at one end of the room that had seen better days. There were eight students including Harry, and along with their desks, they took up the rest of the studio space.
Strangely, Harry found that the reminder only made him more determined to continue. It would be easy enough to stop, but he didn’t want to. He looked down at his clay—it was surprisingly well-centred, nice and wet, and ready to be pulled upwards to deepen the bowl shape. He took a breath to steady himself, then set about gently, slowly extending the rim as he spoke.
“Like I said earlier, I don’t actually know how to do that,” Draco says drily. He looks conflicted. “Are you sure this is a good idea?”
Harry laughed. “In any case, that theft one was wrapped up, wasn’t it?”
“I do not,” Harry objected, feeling his face heat. Draco made a sound that could have been a snort.
“I’m sorry, I’ve got to go,” he said quickly. “I’ve got a—there’s a thing.” He shifted from one foot to the other uncomfortably, trying not to look at his shoes.
Harry had also heard from his friends about personal letters that Draco had sent to them, which contained similar sentiments. Mostly these were received with wariness and some bafflement, but as time went on people in Harry’s life seemed to accept that Draco’s name would occasionally come up in conversations and it was no longer an object of scorn.
“I like the Leaky,” Harry said defensively.
“Yes,” Harry said. “I’m, er… Harry Potter.”
Harry gaped. “What?”
“Lord Fauntleroy!” Harry suddenly exclaimed.
“First of all, you can go fuck yourself,” he gasps. “Second, you’re a Veela, and you need to stop whatever it is you’re doing to me right now.”
“And now what?” Draco asks from just over his shoulder, and Harry shudders. Maybe Draco is just leaning forward to get a better look at the wand, he thinks.
Harry chose a bench down the street from the front door where he could unobtrusively watch for Malfoy’s arrival. It was a standard Auror observation tactic, as was the copy of the Muggle newspaper that he raised to obscure his face from anybody else passing nearby.
“Wow,” Harry deadpanned. It didn’t stop a curl of warmth from appearing in his chest.
Reminding himself not to look down, even though he had no idea why it felt important to do this Malfoy’s way, Harry realized that Malfoy was right—his hands were starting to compress the outer edges of the clay. He flexed them, raising his fingers away from the wheel and stretching them out one by one before lowering them back down and giving himself time to become familiar with the shape of the clay again.
He hands the wand back to Malfoy. “Go ahead and cast,” he says, as if he doesn’t much care what happens next.
Harry waved him off. “Don’t be ridiculous,” he said. “You’ve done your part. You’re free now; go enjoy an actual holiday for the next couple days.”
“Yes?”
“More reading, less chit-chat,” Malfoy said. It may have come out a bit gleefully. Tormenting Potter turned out to be
It wasn’t that Draco couldn’t, or even wouldn’t, apologize. Early on in training, he had come to Harry and issued an uncomfortably thorough and blunt apology for his many transgressions during their time at school and the war. Draco had been weirdly formal about the whole thing, and he’d almost seemed annoyed when Harry had accepted the apology at face value rather than hashing out each time he’d hurt Harry.
“You should go, Potter,” Malfoy said abruptly. “I’m sure I’ll be fine without you.”
“Huh,” Harry says. His curiosity is definitely piqued now; he runs a hand through his hair absentmindedly, fiddles with his bun as he reevaluates what could be causing Malfoy’s problem. “You can let the spell go,” he tells Malfoy, and walks over to his collection of wands and picks a few out. A beech wand with a hair from a centaur’s forelock, oak surrounding a bit of kneazle whisker; those are well-rounded wand cores that should be broadly compatible with many different magical cores. He rummages through the box, looking for some others with similar characteristics, then reconsiders and decides to bring the whole thing over to the workshop bench instead.
“Harry?” Hermoine's voice came from the living room.
He wondered if Potter would laugh at him, if he saw the way his own home frightened him most days.

. She had her hand clutching around Potter's shoulder, speaking in low tones to him. Potter was nodding, and to Draco's shock, he laid his hand briefly over Narcissa Malfoy's hand, before bobbing his head and stepping back. He looked, then, and spotted Draco. He gestured towards him to Narcissa, and when she saw Draco, she
“Er, your wand, Malfoy. I'm sorry I took it, I, ah, kind of had to. But here it is. It's a good wand,” he said in a rush. Draco was left wondering who had just spoken in front of the Wizengamot. Surly not this stuttering git standing here.
He turned to his Mother, needing to get as far away from Harry Potter and the day as he could. She seemed to understand, murmuring her thanks to Potter, and sweeping Draco off and out of the Ministry.
So it went. Draco was on house arrest, as such he confined himself mostly to his rooms.
“Mr. Potter! Oh, it IS him!”
Potter could not have appalled Draco more if he had thrown a hex, if he had slapped him. What was happening? What HAD happened? He felt like he was picking up sand trying to understand all that had gone on. All he could do was stare openly at Potter, trying to discern exactly what was happening in his head.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oi, Gin, leave off a second, let us get a word in. We have good reason.” The tips of Ron's ears were turning read, he threw a floundering look at Harry. Ginny turned once again to glare at Harry.
“If you asked me today, what I am most tired of...” With this, Potter again turns on Draco. Alarm spreads through him again. What could he have done now?
“Gin, we know all that, we do. There were just some things the counsel needed to know before they make their decision, that's all. He doesn't deserve the kiss Gin, he doesn't.” Harry didn't know what Malfoy deserved, didn't want to even think about it, really, but he knew more death connected to this war was too much, too heavy. Everything felt heavy and cold to Harry now. He just knew that much, Malfoy was 17, same as them. He didn't deserve to die after going through so much trouble to keep himself and his family alive. Harry would think about everything else deeper, in the future, if he had to.
“After?” Draco forced the word out. After? After what? What was next?
Third chapter won't follow as quickly, should be soon though.
As Potter says the Dark Lord's name out loud, another wave of noise comes from Draco's side. He wishes he was looking at them now, almost. He would have hated to see the look of hero worship he's sure Savior Boy is getting, but it would be almost worth it to be able to look at the people while they damn him to lose his mind.
Harry cast a quick tempus, he shivered. Groaning aloud when the lovely time of 4:53 am appeared. With a glance back at his abandoned bed, he made the decision to start his day. Hermoine and Ron wouldn't be coming until 7, but he knew if he tried to go back to sleep now it would be for nothing.
Potter has been talking. Draco thinks he missed most of it.
It was all said and done, Draco was free to go. He had probation, and some number of Galleons to repay in restitution. He had missed the number. He was sure someone would send an owl letting him know how much. He had a brief moment, wondering if they knew he, himself, actually didn't have a knut to his name, not really. Not to his first name, anyway. He figured it didn't really matter.
Life, amiright? Good news, I've got 3 more chapters written. Bad news, I need to write 1, probs 2, chapter to get to the point where I can post those.
“How, what?! How could you three even do that! Who could you even want to give a good word for?”
It wasn't that he didn't want to testify for them, he did. He would. It was just, how much exactly was he going to have to say? How much, exactly, was it going to suck? The three of them had spent the last few nights talking it through. They had gone back and forth deciding if they even should. Did Malfoy even deserve their small testimony? Ron thought not. Hermione had talked about forgiveness. Harry had pointed out what had happened at the Manor. The trio had decided that, yes, that part did deserve to be read into evidence to the Wizengamot. They didn't know what it would really accomplish, but all sides of the story deserved to be known. Mrs. Malfoy deserved her part to be read into testimony, that was something all three had agreed on and dismissed quickly. That was easy. The trio hadn't told anyone that they were going to submit a testimoy. They weren't sure how Ron's family would react. Ron had thought it was something they could find out later, when all was said and done. When everything hurt maybe just a tiny tick less. Harry winced, the Prophet would absolutely get wind of it, hopefully after all was said and done. Way after. Harry's thoughts were racing, getting away from him. If he really let himself think about what would happen to Malfoy, even with their bit of help-
Draco, if he could have moved, would have flinched.  A character witness?  Who would have wanted to come to this trial and speak for him?  As soon as he thinks it, he dismisses it.  He knows whoever is here to talk about his character isn't here to sing any praises.  He is suddenly so, so tired.  His eyes are dry, painfully so.  Glancing down at the enchanted metal shackles that bind him to the chair, he wishes in vain he could bring his hands to his face.  He wants to hide, he wants to press his fingers into his temple, the headache he's had consistently, is growing again.  He tries, already knowing he can't, to shift an arm, a leg.  He tries to quiet the soft, but getting louder, panic that is zipping through him.  Eyes ahead, lift the jaw, settle that famous, well, infamous really, now, Malfoy mask.  He wills himself to bear this.
Draco decided this would be a good time to see if he could light the carpet on fire with just his mind and some very heavy eye contact. Wandless Incendio? Children's play, surely. He had absolutely nothing to say to Potter, sure he was here just so he could, what? Force Draco to swear fealty at his feet? Lord over him with his defeat of the Dark Lord, with his divine forgiveness, his-
“Yea yea, I know” He said into the empty room.
“So you did ruin it. Well, get out of my way, I'm going.” Draco pushed off the wall, meaning to shove past him and march himself into Ollivander's that instant.
Looking at Potter, who had removed his dress robes, dumping them unceremoniously on the floor where he was sitting, Draco wondered briefly if he was the mystery interior decorator. They let him do whatever else he wanted to do these days, so it probably had been him. His jeans, with holes in one knee, his ill-fitting shirt, was that a hole in the arm? At least it was on the opposite side of his body from the holey knee. Symmetry and all that.
If he had to stop and catch his breath before taking the final jump, that was fine. No one there to see him, after all.
“Malfoy, good to see you,” Potter said, the corner of his mouth turning up, because they both knew it decidedly was not good to see Draco, and it really never had been.
Draco nodded once in Potter's direction, and shifted to look out at Ollivander's again.
Briefly wonders if they'll allow whomever is stepping down from the stairs, he could hear the shift of robes, wonders how close they'll be allowed to be.  Are hexes allowed in the courtroom?  For a Death Eater (former his increasingly unhelpful brain supplies) Draco grimly decides, oh definitely.  To his right comes the uproar again, gasps of shock.  Draco tips his head back, resting his eyes for a brief moment.  Bring whoever wants to come, and let this be done.  He is resigned to his fate, if they need a little more theater before throwing him into an even deeper hole in Azkaban, let them.  It's no less than he deserves.
“Malfoy, hold on a minute. There's something we can try, if you want your wand, that wand, to work for you.”
“Well good for you, Harry.” Ginny chocked out. Harry wilted, dropped his eyes to the ground. Taking a breath, one, two. Pulling the cold and calm back. He glanced up, Ron and Hermione had gone to stand at his right, looking at something.
“Listen, Gin, we were going to tell everyone. It just had to be done today, get it submitted correctly before next week.” Taking a deep breath, Harry decided he might as well get it over with. As soon as Ginny knew, the rest would know. “We put a few words in for the Malfoy's”
Let me know if this sucks, yea??
Draco who was left staring at Potter's back, watches as he turns towards him once again. Walking to him, Potter's wand is suddenly in his hand. Whatever Potter has been saying about forgiveness, Draco cannot believe his ears. He assumes this is all a ruse, a game. He wishes he wasn't so tired, so hungry. Feels like he's constantly spinning to catch up. Still so sure Potter will throw a spell his way, just for fun. He'd deserve it, wouldn't he? Draco struggles for, and finds his mask. He will act unaffected if it kills him, even if his insides have turned to ice.
Potter turns to face him.  Draco tries again to force a breath, keep his head above water.  He pulls again at his arms, just wanting to be able to dash a hand across his eyes.  Potter watches him, his eyes zeroing in on Draco's.  He watches those green eyes, widening for one brief second, and hopes he makes it quick.  In the second it takes Draco to try to pull another breath, Potter has crossed over to him.  His mind, circulating between shutting down and hyper awareness, delivers the next few seconds to him in slow motion.
Just in time for Draco to turn, seeing the flashbulbs going off. He stiffened, knowing his Mother would have something to say about this, cast one more glance at Ollivander's, turned on his heal, and followed Potter's example.
“I had more, but another one broke this morning. I'm not sure, maybe those bowls are old or something? This one split right down the middle.” Shrugging, Harry bent to open cabinets closer to the floor, coming up with some sort of plastic bowl and handing it to Ron.
Potter turned towards Draco, turning the full weight of his gaze on him. Draco tried to remember he was taking up breathing calmly as an exercise and dropped his arms. Waited.
Waiting for his friends, Harry shifted from foot to foot. Deciding that they would be awhile, he dropped into a kitchen chair again. Resting on his elbows, Harry stared down at the pitted table, running a finger over it. Being with them again in this kitchen, in this house, was such a mix of different things. He knew his friends were worrying about him. He was worrying about them too. Hermoine had tried to talk about something when they had been here two nights before, but Harry had had to shut it down. He knew he needed to talk about it, but he wasn't ready. He knew they needed to know what had happened in the forest. Harry supposed he was being selfish. If he told them, HE would have to talk about it. Talk about walking into the forest, talk about it all. Talk about the after. Talk about how he was feeling right now.
For his part, Potter just looked undisturbed by Draco's questions. Holding his arms up in surrender, Potter picked himself up off the wall, snapping his fingers again. The noise from the street came in on a rush, and Draco wished for it back immediately.
As he walked up to Draco, he looked nervous again. Draco wondered if he needed to do a huge, drawn out show of gratitude right then and there. Maybe that's what Potter had wanted, why he waited around.
Coming into the room, Ginny sat and turned on Harry. “Are the rumors Dad heard true? Did you three just go and submit a testimony for someone from the other side?”
As the world resumes it's normal flow, Potter tilts his head, ever so slightly, something like shock but softer flitting across his face. Before Draco can decide what in the hell just happened, Potter is turning from him, pulling himself up straight and sure.  He faces the gallery, and begins.
Gripping his arms around his middle, Draco closed his eyes, tucked his chin into his chest and tried to breath through the sudden dizziness he was experiencing. Tried to block out the shouts from people bustling around him.
“Yes.” There's no pause from Shacklebolt.
Draco wondered if sometimes Potter thought of something so horrific he would forget how to breath until he was light headed. He wondered if he woke up screaming into the darkness at night.
Potter shook his head, “I haven't got any Auror mates, and I really was just curious. Haven't seen you out in ages.”
After a moment, Mother loosened her hold on him, rotating so Draco could see Potter once more. He was waiting, talking with the other two, giving the Malfoy's some privacy. Mother cleared her throat, and Potter's shaggy head swiveled to them.
Which was just as well. It was very hard to find a spot in the Manor that didn't immediately bring up thoughts of the Dark Lord.
Turning his head fully now, watching Potter as he speaks to the room at large, Draco's head is fog again.
"-quiet in the room, if you please.  We will not, even in times like these, especially in times like these, forgo the rights of the accused." Another uproar began, Draco desperately wondered what he had missed.  "QUIET!" Kingsley stood and faced the room at large.  "We have asked Mr. Malfoy at length,  and he has answered every question.  As acting Minister of Magic, I will not bar due process.  If someone wishes to be a character witness for Mr. Malfoy, that is the next step we have before us today."
Harry threw himself down on the couch, running a hand over his face.
“This! This is what's left, what is trying to heal, from a hex Draco Malfoy received while in Auror custody. This is what is already taking place in the wake of all the darkness. Cruelty. We discovered late last night that some have already taken it into their own hands to punish. ” Potter seems to be getting agitated. He looks away from Draco, seeming to catch the eye of someone. Taking a deep breath, Potter turns to Draco again, reaching out to put a feather light touch on Draco's slashed and tight skin. The cool feeling washes over Draco's throat, behind his ear, up into his scalp, burning out the lingering pain and stiffness left from the hex. Here, Potter's eyes go a bit wide, a bit wild. Potter drops Draco's hair, pulls his robes back in place, yanking his had away, worrying his bottom lip. There's a crackle of energy around Potter, Draco can't pin down what's going on with him, can't fully follow the twists of the last minute. Are Potter's hands shaking? How-?
He wondered even more often, why Potter had done any of it at all.
“Not sure how that's any of your fucking business, Potter,” he spat.
“It's absolutely not, but I noticed you here and was curious.” Shrugging again, he brought his back to the stone again, their shoulders almost touching.
Feigning boredom, looking totally put upon, Draco looked up, “Why am I here, Potter?”
Normally, he assumes, the seats that lift up and up would be filed with people. There are people here, if he could tilt his head a little more to the right he could see them. The pain is better, but he knows from this morning he needs to keep his neck and head as straight-on as possible. When the Auror had come to his cell and startled him out of his nightmare, he had turned his head towards him too fast and- Well, better to try to focus on what the Minister is saying. Draco thinks he's most likely answered all the questions they will have for him, wonders if they will decide how many years in Azkaban he'll get, right now in front of him. He wonders if they'll even bother to let him know. At this point he almost doesn't want to know. Add it in with the other things he doesn't know.
“How did you even notice me here?” Draco had to ask, taking one half step to the right.
The second time it happened, Draco Malfoy was having a very bad, not good, perfectly awful day.
“I know 'Mione, you know it's just a lot after today. D'ya think we're doing enough?”
It wasn't until the third time it happened that Draco realized it was even something to be noticed.
Draco sniffed, feeling his cheeks heat.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You always thought I was up to something!”
He wondered at the little prick of excitement that thought brought him, but let it go.
There was a loud crack, and for a second Harry thought Kreacher had finally come to torment him. One second later, however, he realized his cereal bowl had sprung a large crack in the center, milk spilling down his leg. Cursing, Harry got up and vanished the offending breakfast.
“Malfoy, er, this will just...” Potter trailed off uncertainly.
His mother owl ordered everything he would need, the elf that was left at the Manor packed his trunk.
Draco had gotten off of house arrest with little fanfare and even less hope for his future.
He keeps his eyes shut, blocking out whoever it is who has stepped down to stand near him.  The murmurs and whispers have gone down, he thinks everyone is holding their breath, same as he does.
Unfortunately, as soon as Draco had come round the corner all his courage, all the steel in his spine had deserted him. He leaned into the shadows across from Ollivnder's and tried to breath deeply, tried to find the resolve he had decided he had this morning. It really wasn't anywhere to be found.
“Mmm, yea, actually, I might know why that is.”
Shaking the thoughts away, Harry picked his wand up, casting another tempus. Finally, it was 7:20. Standing, he shook his fingers, his hand had gone cold. Nerves. Looking at Ron, who was finishing off the milk in the bowl like it was his last meal, to Hermione who was gathering her files, making sure everything was in it's place for their meeting. Harry spelled the bowls and spoons into the sink, the trio stood and made their way to the Floo. Harry blew on his hands, trying to work back some warmth into them, and followed Ron through to the Ministry.
I know this chapter is short, but I wanted it that way. Draco isn't really thinking clearly. Hope it kind of feels that way, disjointed. It's meant to.
So it went, he read the papers, he drank weak tea to calm his nerves and his stomach, and he confined himself to his rooms.
Draco's wand?
May 10th, 1998
Thinking back, he knew exactly when the first two times had been. So what if they were significant. Sure, possibly they marked 'pivotal events' in his life. Further still, these pivotal moments had gone, misty and quiet, right under his defenses and into, well, places, Draco supposed.
When the owl arrived from Hogwarts, informing him he was invited to return to sit and 'Eighth Year” with everyone who had had their studies interrupted last term, he almost laughed.
“What do you mean, enough?” Came someone from behind Harry. Hermione's eyes widened just a fraction, Harry turned.
Potter hasn't said anything yet, and Draco isn't sure if it's been 5 seconds or 5 hours he's had his eyes closed.  A fully forming panic attack will do that to you, a soft part of his mind supplies.  Steeling himself for the final blow of this fate he knows he deserves, Draco opens his eyes.
“Indeed.” Draco smoothed down his robes absently. None of the prior tests had shown any acute magical changes taking place inside of Potter’s body, but he worried about the curse traces. “Well, all of our tests suggest that Potter is enjoying a particularly deep slumber, probably even dreaming while doing so. With your consent, I’d like to go in and wake him up.”
“Do I have a choice?” Harry said, realizing too late that he sounded defensive again.
“It was a whim, really,” Potter said, making his way over to a chest of drawers against the wall. The towel slipped a little bit as he bent down to open a drawer, but Potter just reached back and adjusted it, seemingly unconcerned. “I heard you’re a full Healer at St. Mungo’s now. I thought it might be nice to catch up.”
“Melanie said to start by making the bowl’s indentation,” Harry felt compelled to point out. “Pressing down to get the clay out of the way.”
“I don’t actually know if I can control this,” Draco says against his neck, and Harry tries to concentrate on the words rather than the sensation of Draco’s lips on his skin. “I’ll go. We can find some other way.”
“As you should,” Draco said primly. He felt a smile pulling at the corners of his mouth. “The wizarding world deserves a higher class of saviour than you, honestly.”
Harry knew Draco’s moods well by now, and he could practically see the other man biting his tongue. “Hypothetically,” Draco said, far too calmly. “Use your imagination. Say there was a desperate need for someone with a lot of experience with this department and they’re not here. What then?”
Malfoy frowns. “Do what?” he asks, but he looks closer at Harry and must notice the tension that he’s carrying. “Oh,” he says, meeting Harry’s gaze once more. “I… don’t really know what I’m doing.”
Harry found himself blushing, inexplicably. “Fine,” he said. “But I still don’t see how you expect me to do anything with this clay if I can’t even look at it.”
In what Draco takes to be an encouraging sign, Harry nods and reaches out to turn off the shower faucet. They both stand there dripping for a moment before Draco says, “So, did you happen to grab a fresh towel before getting in here? Because I put yours in the wash earlier.”
“Oh, that’s all, is it?” Harry asked. He felt ridiculous for how readily he gave in, but the challenge appealed to him. His mind felt alive like it hadn’t in days, his body thrumming with potential. “I think I should get to ask you some questions too,” he said. “It’s only fair.”
“I’ll take whatever I can get,” Harry said, and Draco laughed.
“Because I really can’t have you staring at me right now,” Harry snaps. “Not if this wand is actually going to turn out decent.” He tries to slow his breathing, willing himself to calm down. There’s still lots to do, and he’s got to remain clear-headed.
“Well, if it’s things that wake me up,” Harry continued, and then trailed off with an inexplicable blush. “Er,” he said. “It’s… never mind.”
“No, that can’t be right,” Harry argued. “I don’t even have my NEWTs yet. There’s no way I could be a full professor.”
you’re trying to be a gentleman about this, now of all times. I promise I’ve enjoyed myself; just come on my fucking face already!”
“But we work so well together!” Harry blurted. “It just feels right, you know? We complement each other.”
, Harry mouthed mockingly at Malfoy as soon as he wasn’t looking at him any longer. There was nothing keeping him at the studio; he could leave any time he wanted. But Harry decided that he
“As the victor of our race—” Draco began.
“A bed,” he said decisively. “We need something more comfortable.” He pointed behind Draco. “I think that one should do, don’t you?” he asked, sounding smug.
Hermione picked at her drink mat before she tried again. “I just meant that you’ve got this time to just… try other things. Obviously, you can’t
“Bump uglies?” Draco offered. “Have a little rub and tug? Engage in some heavy petting?”
“Indeed,” Draco said, but he was smirking a tiny bit. “Perhaps I should try again.”
As his eyes adjusted to the well-lit interior, they were drawn to a large colourful sign across from the doorway that declared: “Welcome to St. Michael’s! All are welcome (especially you)!” A grey-haired woman was standing nearby the door holding what looked like programs, and she quickly spotted him and ushered him inside with a smile. He reluctantly stepped into the building; it felt like it would be rude to refuse the invitation.
He hadn’t actually seen her since they had decided to go their separate ways. It had been awkward, but it hadn’t hurt like he feared it might. It had felt more like a relief, really. Ginny was the one who brought up the idea of splitting up; they’d actually barely seen each other in the previous year between Harry’s training and Ginny getting signed by a minor league Quidditch team. They each had their own place to live and their own lives, more or less, and when Ginny asked him point-blank “Is this what you actually want?”, Harry had to admit that it felt like he was settling for what was easy.
“Merlin, Potter,” Malfoy said, breaking into his crisis of confidence. “I’ve seen you use your pedal before. I didn’t think I had to provide you step by step instructions.”
Ginny slid into the booth opposite him, placing her glass on the table in front of her. “He could,” she admitted. “But that doesn’t really explain the other five empties.”
“I’m just helping the experiment,” Harry says innocently, appreciating the sight of Malfoy’s lips drawing together into a thin line. They’re nicer lips when they’re fuller and pressed against Harry’s of course, but he’ll take whatever pleasure he can get from this afternoon.
Draco turned a scathing look on Harry. “Merlin, no,” he said. “We just have to redo it properly this time.”
“Listen, it’s kind of difficult to explain everything in these surroundings if you catch my meaning,” Harry said defensively.
Harry leans his forehead against the shelf supports. He will get through this. Somehow. “Crass, but essentially yes.”
Harry shook himself. For all his talk about professionalism, it clearly didn’t take much to push him past the boundary in his head. He had to focus. Ginny had made assumptions, but she was wrong. He and Draco were a very effective Auror team, and it would be foolish to jeopardise that. Beyond foolish.
“Jesus, Malfoy,” Potter said. He was staring at Malfoy again, his pupils blown.
“Let me come down first—”
“I don’t care,” Harry says quickly. “Just ask me questions or something.” He bites his lip as he pushes the chisel along the length of the wood again.
Draco smoothed his hair absentmindedly, seemingly lost in thought. “I think I would like to meet her, even if only so I can stop wondering.”
Taking a moment to compose himself, Harry turns back around to face Malfoy. “Even if you’re not a Veela, you're still doing whatever it is that Veelas do, so it amounts to the same thing,” he says, more calmly than he feels. It’s like being in the eye of the storm, knowing that whatever he was just experiencing could reappear at any moment.
“Harry!” Arthur exclaimed, breaking off in the middle of their conversation. “Didn’t think we’d be seeing you today.” He stood up from his chair to shake Harry’s hand and genially clap him on the back.
Harry spluttered as he took a sip from his glass. “What, like, on a date?” he asked, trying to turn it into a joke. “Are you trying to get the inside scoop to sell to the Daily Prophet?”
Draco threw up his hands. “Wonderful!” he said. “I guess it’s time to pull out my Ancient Runes textbook and see if it can provide any help here.”
Three days later, Harry is on edge as he waits for Malfoy to arrive. He has spent the intervening time looking through the Hogwarts library after receiving special permission from Headmistress McGonagall, but he hasn’t found much that’s useful. The collection is light on wand lore, and Flourish and Blotts strictly sells what Ollivander used to derisively call “light reading” on the subject.
There’s a pause. Harry resists the urge to turn and look at Malfoy, see what his reaction is. He tries to focus on the woods in front of him—is Malfoy a birch? No, that’s far too common for his dramatic personality.
“I’m not seeing it,” Harry said. “Did he really do calligraphy for all of the paperwork, though?”
“Merlin, yes,” Malfoy replied, meeting his gaze. “I’ve been dying for a smoke.”
The box in front of Harry’s feet attempted to fly through his legs, the weight of its contents, giving it enough mass to start pushing him and his chair out of the way. Harry grabbed on to the edges of his desk and attempted to keep himself in place. “Oh, how strange,” Harry said lightly. “I wonder how that got there!”
“It’s—” Potter ground out. “I’m going to—”
Draco’s mug met his in the middle with a soft clink. They watched each other as they both took small drinks from their cups, and the moment suddenly felt charged. Draco wasn’t smiling any more as he brought his mug away from his mouth.
"Would you believe I’m here for assistance with my wand?” Malfoy replies, still refusing to meet his eyes, and Harry snorts.
remember that they were explicitly instructed not to use the spells except in cases of emergency. However, Draco forgetting his wand
Harry is tired of rationalizing, tired of thinking analytically about these matters. He brings his other hand up to cup Draco’s face, slides his palm tantalizingly through the hair hanging down the side of his scalp, and Draco gasps, closes his eyes. Harry brings his lips to Draco’s ear and whispers: “Stick around this time and we can find out.”
Molly finally released him and beamed at Draco. “Well, it’s nice to see that Harry’s happy and he’s being looked after. Happy Christmas to both of you.” Draco blinked, unused to Molly’s way with hangers-on at Weasley affairs, but Harry just laughed indulgently.
Draco scoffed; what a reassuring vote of confidence that was. “Yes, I have successfully woken up other patients with this method. It’s often quite straightforward.” He took his wand in hand and pointed it at Potter’s head. “At the very least, I should be back soon with more information,” he said. He gave Weasley a professional nod, then turned his attention back to Potter. “
“Really, Potter?” Draco asked. “Everyone knows you evaluate a Thai restaurant by its Pad Thai the first time you eat there.”
Draco interest was piqued by that detail. “Your wife?” he asked innocently. “I’m sorry, I didn’t realize that you were married. Who’s your wife?”
Draco was confident that his plan wouldn’t work if Potter wasn’t involved in choosing the book. As the non-dreamer, Draco had very little ability to influence the dream’s actual content except through his suggestions to Potter. Potter’s mind was the source of the environment and the objects within it, so he needed to be the one to conjure up the book that he would then be able to find. Draco just needed to nudge him in the right direction.
“Guess I’m getting takeaway, in that case,” Harry said. “Would you like anything?”
Wordlessly, Harry cast a
“Let’s make it three,” Harry says, thinking about all the books on wand lore and magical creatures that he needs to dig through.
Ginny took a drink, then wiped a bit of beer off her top lip. “Sounds like therapy. Are you seeing a therapist, then?”
“Ok, here’s what’s going to happen,” Harry says, desperate to regain control over the situation. “You’re going to ignore what I’m doing and read one of my books on wandlore. You were a swot in school, I’m sure you’ll enjoy it.”
“Right,” Harry said, suddenly feeling awkward. “Well. Have a good night, then.” Face warm, he gave a little wave over his shoulder as he made his way into the alley without waiting for a response.
“Then we’ll have learned something else,” Harry replies, and he leans back against the workbench to watch what he expects will be a long and boring process.
“I wouldn’t have said anything even if he did ask,” Pansy pointed out. Harry flipped two fingers towards her; she responded by raising her glass and giving him a Cheshire grin.
“You started hunching your shoulders,” Malfoy said. “That sort of tension usually bleeds over.”
Draco’s heart sank. Trust Potter to make the connection immediately. “Oh?” he asked, feigning nonchalance. “Really?”
Sometimes, Harry’s therapy sessions felt like being on a stakeout. He would sit back, constantly watchful of his surroundings, waiting for Healer Tran to make the next move. Meanwhile, she would watch him right back, her fingers steepled in front of her chin.
“That’s what I like to hear!” Robards said jovially. “It’s important to get away. Clears the mind, freshens the wits. Well, don’t let me keep you two!” He strode away, humming cheerfully to himself.
Potter grinned at him, and Draco abruptly couldn’t think of what he was supposed to say next. The silence went on slightly too long, and Potter’s smile dimmed for a moment.
It was Harry’s turn to roll his eyes as he went to fetch a block for himself. He still wasn’t sure what to make of this situation, with Malfoy being a bit anal about the whole thing but also apparently prepared to just.. let him be? Harry felt a bit adrift when he thought about what the next few hours looked like. He brought his clay back to his wheel and sat down, but for some reason, he hesitated to turn it on. Perhaps he hadn’t thought through the implications of sitting right in front of Malfoy, he thought morosely. It just meant more opportunities for Malfoy to watch him and judge his non-existent pottery skills. On the other hand, moving his table at this point would practically be an admission of weakness.
“Well then,” Harry says, and attempts to head off whatever is passing between them by walking over to his blocks of rough wood and considering them. “You should be happy to learn that all you need is a new wand that won’t get tangled up in your new Veela powers.”
Harry laughed. “Jesus, Malfoy,” he said. “Is that what this is about? You could have just had me fill out a survey or something.”
“Er,” he said, stalling. “Yes. I just saw the lights and wondered…”
“She seemed very reserved,” Draco said, before taking another pull from his mug. “I’m more worried about whether she’ll like me.”
Draco hummed before falling silent once again, while Harry picked up the original report and stared at the word in question. If it didn’t stand for ‘buying,’ then what could it be instead? Not ‘being.’
Tran was eyeing him again, and Harry realized that his polite smile had faded as soon as he’d stopped thinking about it. He sighed. This was going about as well as most of his appointments so far. He reached out for the paper on her desk, just for something to do with his hands.
“If I need anything,” Potter said slowly, looking from the card back to Draco. “Like… more legilimency help? I’ve been given a clean bill of health, you know. I should be fine now.”
“Thanks,” Harry replied nervously, wondering what he was getting himself into. He walked quietly towards the space where the service was taking place, feeling like he was intruding merely by being in the building. When he reached the doorway, he glanced inside - the main sanctuary was a high, arched room, and  pews lined both sides of the long aisle. They were well packed with attendees, and at the end of each row there was a wreath and a lit candle, the flames dancing merrily in the warm air.
Harry only missed two and a half hours of last year’s; he came home grumbling about how the on-call healer would have handled it fine. They had only called him in because it was the wife of a big donor who was giving birth and the St. Mungo’s administrators got cold feet. He and Harry had ended up ordering take-away from the Indian place at the bottom of the street, since it had been late enough that Draco didn’t really feel like starting to make dinner at that point.
“And you’re one of the most obstinate, stubborn men I’ve ever met!” Draco retorted. “You barely even listen to me as it is, even though I’m the only one of us who knows what’s going on.”
“Go on, then,” Harry said, gamely. This whole…
“Your way with words never fails to astound me, Potter,” Malfoy said drily. “‘That’s nice,’ when I’ve just bared all my secrets to you.”
“Fuck off,” Malfoy growls, and something at the base of Harry’s spine thrills to hear him say it. It reminds him of that night they spent together, the way Malfoy had made his way over to Harry at the club. He brushes the memory aside as the stool suddenly drops almost a foot before its fall is arrested once more, and he quickly looks at Malfoy.
“Harry Potter decided that the rules don’t apply to him,” Draco said, smirking. “Imagine that.”
“I hear you have a racing broom,” Draco said. “Would you show it to me?”
“Down!” Teddy said, laughing even harder. “Down!”
“No,” Jenkins said. “We’ve got him in the ward up ahead. All the diagnostic tests have come up inconclusive, though. He just registers as having a really good sleep.”
Potter flipped two fingers at him. “So… I guess I should read the rest of this book?” he asked. “And you’ll think of some way to get us out of here?”
“Thirty two year old male, found asleep and unresponsive to external stimuli.” Jenkins unconsciously wrung his hands as he spoke; it was a habit that made Draco want to grind his teeth. The Healer trainee tended to look even more worried when Draco did that, however, so he refrained. Barely. “Arrived via Floo, it’s unknown how long the patient has been in this state.”
“This is really slow going,” he said morosely. “What do you think? Lunch break?”
“Just testing your powers of recall,” Draco said. “It certainly appears as if we were able to avert any lasting damage to your memories.”
“My palate is just fine without your silly chocolate porters,” Ginny said, taking a sip of her beer.
“We’re
“How did you start smoking, anyways?” Harry asked him several minutes later. They were outside, taking in some sunlight and leaning against the studio wall in what Harry now thought of as their customary positions. “No offence, but it’s just not something I ever imagined you getting into.”
“Thank you,” Draco said, performing a stiff but respectful bow with his head. “It is gracious of you to include me.”
Malfoy took another inhale of his cigarette, then blew it out without saying anything. The silence quickly grew uncomfortable, and Harry started to have second thoughts. If this really was Malfoy’s life that he was intruding upon, he didn’t have to make a big fuss about it. Merlin knew Harry could relate to a desire to keep a low profile, sometimes.
“This is the same Ginevra that broke things off with you.. a week before Valentine’s Day?” Draco asked. “And you’re worried it would be awkward at Christmas?”
“Oh!” Harry exclaimed. “That’s really great! I think you’ll like Andromeda.”
This time, Draco breathed lightly on the skin on the side of Potter’s neck as he moved his hand across Potter’s jeans, just brushing his crotch. He could feel a bulge forming, and Potter hissed at the sensation, thrusting a bit to force more contact with Draco’s hand.
Draco didn’t even turn to look at him, which was unusual. He was systematically pulling out drawers in his desk and searching through them, carefully shuffling through case files, looking at the headers, then discarding them.
“We’re cool, right?” she asked, sounding uncertain. “This doesn’t need to be weird. We can still be friends.”
“What is it?” the other man asked, leaning forward to get a closer look at the changing wisps. Draco resisted the urge to pull him back away from the patient. “What did you find?”
Potter scoffed. “Why do I need to scale that monster? You go.”
Harry swallowed. “Then I choose you,” he said, reaching out to take hold of Draco’s hand and interweaving their fingers. “Now take your stupid box and stop distracting me from finishing this awful paperwork so we can go to dinner.”
“Oi,” Harry said petulantly as he pulled himself into a sitting position. “What’s got into you?”
Harry supposed he should actually reply. It was an invitation, even if Malfoy hadn’t even made eye contact or looked in his general direction while issuing it. “Why?” he asked bluntly. “I’m crap at this. You want me to give you a private show?”
“Busted,” Tran said. “Are you going to go?”
“Git,” Harry muttered, but he found himself smiling. He chucked a ball of paper at Draco just for the spirit of the thing.

Harry rolled his eyes. He’d come to enjoy Blaise’s presence over the past two years, once he learned not to take his comments to heart. Blaise was free with his opinions and positions, but rarely put much actual weight behind them. Sometimes Harry wished he had someone like Blaise in his life; something about the way he and Pansy would verbally spar, just for fun, while he would say outlandish things to Ginny just to make her laugh. Harry occasionally watched their interactions at pub nights like this one and felt a quiet absence in his heart.
Is this how Potter saw him, Draco wondered? Or at least, imagined him? Did Potter actually spend time imagining him? The idea was ridiculous, of course. It was foolish to read too deeply into dreams, which were simply the product of an overactive unconscious mind. And yet…
“—and then she had the nerve to say that she didn’t think I wanted to go back to work!”
Malfoy seemed to consider this for a moment. It was the weirdest thing to witness as they both stared at each other. “I accept,” he said finally. “But I get to go first.”
“No, of course not,” Malfoy said. “Just another case of those in power pointing you in a particular direction and setting you loose, I suppose.”
“That’s fine,” Harry reassured him. “Teddy loves talking about Quidditch if you get him going, and if you run out of ideas, you can just ask him to show you his training broom.”
“Yes, and it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance,” Draco said. He held out his hand; after a moment, Teddy reached out and shook it, at first mirroring Draco’s solemn attitude but quickly getting excited about pumping their hands up and down repeatedly. Once Draco was able to disengage, he knelt down to Teddy’s level, who by this point had come out from behind Harry’s legs.
“Draco Malfoy is going on!” Harry exclaimed. “And these two have been keeping him a secret!”
“Draco,” Harry interrupted, “the suspense is making me one hundred times more uncomfortable right now, I promise.”
Harry smiled. “To new opportunities,” he said, lifting his mug. It was a sentiment that he truly meant, but it was also tinged with sadness. He really would miss Draco’s cantankerous, prickly presence every day in the office.
“I specialize in mind-related healing,” Draco said. “Legilimency is a large part of my practice. In fact, a modified form of legilimency has recently emerged as one of the best treatments for magically-induced sleep—we enter the sleeper’s dreams and deliver a shock of some kind. Something that pushes their mind out of the comfort of the dream and into wakefulness.”
“Oh,” Harry said, rubbing his eyes as he adjusted to the solidity and brightness of the non-memory world. “Yeah, this was all Draco. It makes today kind of bearable.”
They’re lying in bed, silently, and Draco’s the big spoon pressed up against Harry’s back. There’s a sliver of moonlight coming in through the window which paints a line across Harry’s dark shoulder and Draco’s right arm, which is wrapped around Harry. Draco’s starting to doze off again, he can feel it; it’s almost gone four in the morning at this point and he’s only human. When Harry starts to shake a little bit, though, it startles Draco out of his stupor. Then Draco hears a sniffle, and a little hiccough, and he instinctively squeezes Harry tighter.
“Potter,” Draco said, very calmly. “Is our missing paperwork sitting right in front of you?”
“Such confidence,” Draco said sarcastically. “I’m touched by your faith in me, Potter.”
That had been one of their first big spats, when Draco had stood his ground, when he’d refused to excise everything in his life that had ever been touched by his family or the events of the war. Harry had eventually come around, but it had been a tense, drawn-out affair, one that had eventually resolved into their first big compromises. Draco had agreed to incorporate more Muggle activities as a gesture of good faith. They’d taken part in cooking classes together, and Harry had been absolute pants at it. It wasn’t really a surprise; cooking turned out to be a lot like potions, and Draco found it all rather satisfying. When Harry’s Healer training finished two years ago and his schedule only intensified, it simply made sense for Draco to assume all the cooking duties between them.
Malfoy tossed him a casual middle finger as he pushed off the wall. “See you inside,” was all he said, though, before he pulled open the studio door and went back in without another look.
“Ah well,” Draco mused. “You get to hide from your former beau and receive the pleasure of my company at the same time. A true Christmas miracle!”
“So the book is a… representation of my missing memories?” Potter asked uncertainly. “This is extremely weird.”
, he added silently.
The day was a slog. Despite his unusual efforts to reach an empty inbox over the past few weeks, Harry was not actually used to spending hours at a time doing paperwork, let alone proofreading, translating, deciphering, and other activities that required sustained mental focus. Harry regularly found his attention wandering, or realised that he had reached the bottom of a page without paying any attention to it and had to start from the beginning again.
“Yes, Albus is not doing as well in my class as I had hoped, to be honest,” Potter said, pulling another piece of parchment out of his disaster of a desk and glancing it over. “He had a very promising start this term, but he has not handed in any of the three most recent assignments. I suspect it’s the company he’s keeping, but he won’t explain why he’s not turning anything in.”
Potter continued to watch the cloud as it wound its way towards them. Draco ran his hands up Potter’s chest, tweaking his hard nipples along the way, to remind him of what he could be focusing on instead.
“Those rites that you definitely do not engage in?” Harry said, trying to mask his disappointment by playing along.
Harry shifted uncomfortably, hearing an echo of his own thoughts while talking with Malfoy outside the studio the previous evening. “No, you’re right,” he said with a sigh. “That wasn’t fair of me.” He drained his glass. “You know, I should probably go. It’s getting late.”
“It was the clean up that was taking a while,” Draco murmured, and it didn’t sound like he was paying much attention to Harry any more. “Lots of witness testimony and memories to sift through in Pensieves. Evidence to compile. There were… lots of little items stolen, right?”
Harry wishes he’d taken time to learn about the effect of Veelas’ powers on people who actually know them, or interact with them in meaningful ways. He’s sure Hermione would have thought to look that up if she were in his shoes.
“You go for a swim in the Channel as the moon rises,” Harry said, getting into his little game now. He leaned back in his chair, carefully placing his feet on his desk without touching any of the assorted paper chaos that covered it. “Then you perform ancient druidic rites on the beach in the nude by the light of the moon.”
Draco looked where Harry was pointing and sighed in exasperation. “Merlin, tell me we’re not going to drink a passable Firewhiskey out of mugs, and dirty ones at that. I should have known better.”
Giving it his best attempt at looking like a regular, every-day person out for a walk in the neighbourhood at 8:00 in the morning on a Saturday, he sauntered past the front door, pausing at the studio window to press his face to the glass and look inside. To his surprise, he saw Malfoy sitting at a wheel, working away at a piece that was tall and narrow, and made of sinuous curves.
Potter hesitated at the library’s threshold, peering in through the doorway. “Where’s Madam Pince?” he asked quietly. “I don’t see her anywhere.”
“So what’s the first step, then?” Potter asked, smiling broadly.
“There’s no need to take that tone with me, young man,” the woman said, returning to her crossword. “Somebody hasn’t found his holiday cheer yet.”
To Harry’s surprise, Malfoy looked briefly embarrassed. “Well, it’s the kind of thing that
“Jesus Christ,” Harry mutters to himself, but he looks over his shoulder even though he should know better. Draco is standing just behind him, looking through the book on wandlore that he was reading earlier, and Harry suddenly remembers that there is actually a chapter called that and it covers exactly what he’s about to do. “Do you have to do that?” he snaps. “Isn’t it enough that you’re, you know, projecting your sexy aura all over the place?”
“It didn’t take you very long to make new Christmas plans with me this year, rather than the Weasley brood,” Draco pointed out smugly.
Harry slowly released the pedal and watched his creation come to a halt. It was an ungainly, slightly wobbly, weirdly-shaped pitcher-like thing, and he felt a surge of affection towards it. His hands had drawn it forth from a ball of clay, even if Malfoy’s process for helping him do it had been unlike anything he’d ever experienced before.
“Hello, everyone,” Malfoy said, carefully avoiding looking at Harry. “Just raise your hand if you're having some difficulties, and I’ll try and help you out.”
Draco blinked and found himself back in the familiar surroundings of St. Mungo’s, sitting next to Potter’s bed. He was also obscenely hard, if discreetly so, under his Healer robes. That was probably better than actually coming in his pants, he rationalized, but it certainly wasn’t a comfortable sensation. He stood up, startling an oath from Jenkins as he did so, and looked down at Potter’s body, searching for signs of wakefulness.
“Of course not,” Harry says as he reattaches the wand to the lathe. “None of this is a good idea.” He has an idea how to coax more of Draco’s power out, and it’s probably the worst idea he’s had so far. “What’s the matter?” he asks, giving the other man his full attention and raising an eyebrow. “Scared, Malfoy?”
“How?” Weasley asked. “He didn’t even stir when we pushed him through the Floo, and he usually hates the feeling of going through it.”
. What do we do now?”
“Mmmhmm,” Malfoy says, and Harry shivers. This is insane. He has no idea how he’s going to complete an entire wand under these conditions.
you would find it easier in a different environment,” he finally continued as if Harry hadn’t said anything. “Maybe you might even start to enjoy yourself! I’d be willing to settle for something more achievable, though, like not constantly having a stick up your arse.”
Robards looked meaningfully at the chaos that reigned on Harry’s desk. “Didn’t you have some kind of New Year’s resolution about reaching inbox zero this year?”
“What?” Harry said, nonplussed. “What do you mean?”
, and watched as the man’s features shifted into-
Malfoy’s cheeks flared inwards as he took a final drag on the stub of his cigarette, highlighting the sharp ridges of his cheekbones for a moment. “Look, it doesn’t matter to me either way,” Malfoy said. He tossed the stub on the sidewalk and ground it under his shoe. “I’ll be in the studio tomorrow morning. You can show up, or you can fuck off. Makes no difference to me.” He glanced at Harry once again, as if checking for some kind of reaction.
Harry arrived at the second pottery class intent on not being weird about Malfoy. He was there to work on his pottery technique, poor as it was. The fact that Malfoy (Malfoy!) was assisting with the class was immaterial. Yes, maybe if they had another chance to talk privately then Harry might ask him some pointed questions. Not pointed, he amended; polite ones. Polite, non-weird sorts of questions. It was a good plan.
Malfoy tsked impatiently. “When you’re just starting to make an impression on the clay. What does the process feel like to you?”
Harry sighed. “Fine,” he said. “Pottery it is.”
Potter stilled above him on the bed. The sudden absence of motion caused Draco to groan, and he pressed their crotches together a few more times to convey his disappointment.
“Aha,” Draco said, sounding viciously pleased. “Yes, that would fit quite nicely. Excellent deduction, Potter.”
“I appreciate what you’re doing for me, Harry,” Draco says. “I want you to know that.” He presses his face against the back of Harry’s head, and Harry leans into it, revelling in the closeness. “I know this is difficult for you.”
Draco shifted his weight, staring at the bed. This was actually nothing like picking up someone in a club, he decided. This was like picking up someone in an office in the cold, harsh light of day. This was a terrible idea.
The stool immediately clatters to the ground, and a thrill runs through Harry.
Once the priest had delivered what Harry’s program referred to as the benediction, the organist began to play again as the congregation filed out of the sanctuary. Harry realised that he needed to make a choice—he could try to get out of the church without Draco noticing and pretend he hadn’t stalked his private Christmas Eve plans, or he could prepare himself to confess when Draco eventually noticed him sitting right by the exit. Given the press of bodies making their way out of the doorway next to him, he briefly entertained the idea of crouching down and crawling under the pews instead, but at that moment Draco turned around in the midst of putting on his coat and made eye contact with Harry.
“Do you have any experience reading the shorthand used in reports by this department?”
Harry was distracted by Blaise’s reaction, however. The other man’s eyes had darted to Harry’s left to look at Pansy, then he had schooled his features with something like polite interest. Harry’s Auror senses tingled.
Through another yawn, Potter looked up at him quizzically. “Malfoy?” he said. “I had a… it was the weirdest dream.” His cheeks suddenly flooded with colour, which Draco took to be a good sign in this particular case.
“Look past the brush strokes, Potter,” Draco said scathingly. “Focus on the words themselves.”
“You have to admit, it’s very suspicious,” Harry said, taking a step closer.”Five years since the trials and there’s no sign of you, and then you just
“But it sounds like you did all the right things,” Draco says, and he’s unable to prevent a yawn as he does so. “Sorry. It sounds like you noticed a problem and made sure she was treated appropriately. Why aren’t we throwing a party?”
“Actually, I want to try something different,” Harry says. He walks over to his bench and pulls out what he calls his test wand—instead of a permanent core, it’s got a removable panel he can use to insert different materials into it if he wants to quickly check the efficacy of a particular one with a spell caster. “I’ll need one of your hairs.”
“You know what I do for Christmas,” Harry said, rather than dwelling on that thought. “Why is this such a secret?”
Harry is tempted to mess with him, but he suppresses the urge. He can be the bigger person in this interaction; he is a consummate professional. “It feels like any other wand to me,” he says. “That suggests the problem lies in your connection with it. Go ahead and cast a
Several knocks on his workshop door interrupt his thoughts. He frowns; he’s not expecting anybody today, and his previous special commissions have been arranged by mail. Harry peers out the window, trying to make out the figure standing outside, but the angle’s not quite right. He gets up and wipes his hands on his apron, trying to brush away the worst of the wood shavings and sawdust, and pulls open the door.
in school,” Potter said, looking puzzled, and Draco silently cursed his own inattention. Potter’s exterior dream self was still his thirty two year old body, despite the memories that had apparently been taken from him, and Draco kept forgetting to keep up the charade that this was eighth year for both of them.
“Fuck off,” Malfoy said easily. “Are you going to keep coming to the classes, then?”
“Yeah,” Harry sighed. Yet another reminder that he couldn’t do his job at the moment. “Great. I might just do that.”
“Jealousy,” Malfoy muses, and his fucking hand is just sitting possessively at the base of Harry’s neck and it’s all Harry can do to refrain from rubbing himself against it like a kneazle in heat. “Do you think your theory was correct?”
“You haven’t won yet!” Harry objected.
“Interesting,” she said, which Harry thought was a very weird reply. She was being very therapist-like right then, which he supposed meant she was good at her job, too. “It’s just that most people I talk to who want to go back to work try to follow my instructions. ‘Jump through the hoops,’ as you put it so eloquently in our first session. You just glare at me and barely even go through the motions. Why do you think that is?”
Potter barked a laugh. “Yes, that’s what I turn into over the school hols,” he said. “Just lying in wait to trip unwary members of the public.”
“Would you like some advice?” Malfoy eventually asked. They were the first words that either of them had exchanged for the past forty minutes; he sounded surprisingly hesitant, despite having just watched Harry pummel his latest attempt at a bowl into unformed clay in a fit of artistic rage.
Pushing open the door, Draco peeks inside. The bathroom light is on, and he can see Harry through the glass walls of the shower cubicle, standing with his head tilted back so the water from the showerhead hits his face before running down the rest of his body. He’s not moving at all, just… standing, and Draco feels the hairs on his neck rise on end. He moves closer, until he’s right outside the shower with Harry’s discarded healer robes pooled around his feet.
Harry snorted. “Funny you should mention that. She wants me to go to a pottery class tomorrow evening.”
“Is that so?” Harry asks. He shuts the workshop door and leans against it, crossing his arms against his chest. “Did you learn anything useful about your ‘situation,’ then?” He exaggerates the word, knowing he’s being petty about it. Malfoy’s demeanour is setting him on edge.
, when he could be reaching out instead—
Draco waited until Potter was level with the highest shelf. Given the way the dream had gone so far, it seemed the likeliest place to find Potter’s missing memories, tucked away somewhere difficult to reach. “Ok, now read off some titles that you see,” Draco called up to him.
He’d sharpened his knives earlier in the afternoon, so the blade slices through the meat with barely a hint of resistance. He makes short work of the remaining breasts, lays the knife down and washes the meat juices off of his hands with soap and water, then he pours himself a glass of red wine and sits on the kitchen stool that rests by the sink, considering the contents of the island.
“And who’s this, ‘Arry?” Fleur asked. “Your partner?”
Harry had been prepared for mocking, or maybe even something like “don’t be bad at it”. He wasn’t expecting metaphysical questions. “What?”
“Not everyone does,” Draco said quietly into his cup.
“Hello?” Potter called, which was odd. Draco craned his neck to see what the other man was doing, but the doorway just appeared to lead to a deep darkness, as if Potter hadn’t bothered to dream up an actual corridor outside his office.
“Ugh,” Harry said, turning away from his failure and standing up from the wheel. “Not really.”
“Harry, please,” Malfoy says, and there’s something in his face, a rawness, that makes Harry hesitate for a moment. He hates himself for it. “I am truly sorry for the way I treated you. I shouldn’t have done that. But my magic is… broken, and I don’t know who else can help me.”
Tran looked at him over her hands for a long moment. “Do you have something else you would like to do instead?”
, he wanted to say, but he kept it to himself.
“Ask your question,” Malfoy said intently.
“In that case, shall we?” Draco asked, motioning with his head towards the exit. The crowd had thinned out; there were still some congregation members milling about and exchanging Christmas greetings, but there was now a clear path out of the church.
It was Draco who pulled back first, to Harry’s disappointment. He released Harry’s robes, and Harry avoided the risk of his knees collapsing under him by resting his weight against the desk behind him. They really were the perfect height for these kinds of activities. They were both silent for a moment, breathing a bit harder than usual as they gazed at each other. Harry wasn’t quite sure what his face was doing; it didn’t feel like he had full control over it yet.
“My office?” Harry asked, sounding uncertain. “Is that another change for eighth years? Why can’t McGonagall just give us a normal school year?”
Harry let out a surprised laugh. “Shut up,” he said. “I was just… deciding what to make first.”
Malfoy’s hand instinctively goes to the top of his head, running his fingers through the thicker hair there as if reassuring himself. “Why?” he asks suspiciously.
“Oh, yes,” Draco grumbled. “I remember that.”
“You’re lucky it’s an interesting problem,” Harry grumbles, but he’s opening the door wider as he says it and ushering Malfoy inside. He doesn’t offer to take Malfoy’s coat, and it’s a small and petty act that makes him feel slightly better. “Come on into the workshop and let me see your wand.”
Potter gaped. Whatever he had been expecting, it clearly wasn’t that. “Ok,” he said slowly. “Let’s say that what you’re saying is true. What’s this book doing to me when I read it?”
“Five minute break!” Melanie announced, interrupting Harry’s reverie. “It’s always a good idea to stretch your legs and move around a bit to keep the blood flowing!”
of his cantankerous partner, and wasn’t that a horrifying thought? His school-aged self would have looked on in betrayal; Harry found himself going out of his way to bring Draco tea throughout the day, just to hear him say things like “Potter, you marvel, this is perfectly steeped,” while giving him that small tight smile that made Harry’s insides bloom with warmth.
“Need to?” Malfoy asked. “Who says you need to be in this particular class?”
The cigarette flared as Malfoy took a deep breath. “But
Draco waited until Potter’s gaze returned to the book, then abruptly ducked his head forward and engulfed Potter’s cock in his mouth. He heard a strangled “Oh, fuck,” from above him as he bottomed out, straining to keep his gag reflex in check, then he dragged a stripe along the underside with his tongue as he retreated. He pulled off and began wanking Potter again, wrapping a loose fist around the spit-wet, dark skin.
“Fuck,” Potter said breathily. “Why does that feel so good?”
“So the strokes can be quite rough right now,” Harry says. He’s aware that his distraction is slowly growing the longer the process takes. He’s desperate to break the silence between them; despite the sound of the lathe and the scrapes of his chisel against the block, it feels like there’s something dangerous in allowing it to continue indefinitely. “The lathe turns the wood so quickly that I can just slide the chisel along the length of the wood without a lot of care and it still comes out rounded afterwards.” He scrapes a series of lines along the block to demonstrate, peeling long strips of excess wood away from it.
was there, taught by Professor Potter, along with
Malfoy cocked his head slightly. “And what of being an Auror? Do you see yourself doing that forever?”
Harry rolled his eyes and started to read. After a few moments of struggle, he looked up and met Draco’s eyes.
“Very well,” Draco said, closing his eyes and stretching in a way that caused an indecent amount of neck to be exposed. Harry looked away. “Good work today.”
“Well, that’s just great,” Potter groused. “Fantastic. Did you come up with any ideas for escaping this dream?”
“This is the warm up,” Malfoy said with a slight smile. “I’m just trying to ease you in.”
Harry had continued pulling the rim of his bowl the whole time, and somewhere along the way it had begun losing its bowl-ness. The tall sides that he had created meant it now resembled something closer to a squat pitcher. He’d never made it this far in the throwing process before, though. He kept his foot on the pedal, allowing the wheel to continue revolving while his thoughts ran in circles. Was this what Healer Tran had attempted to help him realize as well?
“Am I interfering with the work?” Malfoy asks mockingly, and his voice caresses something deep inside of Harry.
His hands were suddenly clammy as he picked up the paper from Tran’s desk. “Well, it’s like we talked about. I was working pretty hard before all this—it was pretty intense. This has been a good break. It’s helped me reset.” He focused his attention on the paper’s contents, determined to read it all.
Potter appeared to consider this for a moment, then nodded. “Yeah, that makes sense,” he said. “But what do we do now?”
want to break the statute of secrecy. “You left your, er, special stick in the office, and I was worried you wouldn’t be able to get into your flat and might think you’d lost it.” He patted his coat pocket and raised his eyebrows meaningfully.
Draco looked him in the eye, then opened his mouth and slammed Potter’s cock forward until Draco’s nose was tickled by the dark hairs at the base. Potter moaned as he was deepthroated, a breathy, urgent sound that lit Draco up, and the fist in Draco’s hair tightened deliciously. Draco held Potter’s dick at the back of his throat for a long moment, then pulled back just before he could feel tears starting to form in the corners of his eyes. He kept watching Potter’s face as he began to jack him off again, with quick, urgent motions.
Surprised but pleased, Harry stood quickly and fumbled to put his coat on. They walked through the entry hall of the church, where the grey-haired greeter waved at Draco in a familiar way. Draco pushed the heavy wooden door open and called “Happy Christmas Rosie!” as they stepped outside into the brisk night air.
“That’s worse!” Draco erupted. “That means we have to sift through months of accumulated detritus in order to find it!”
“I want to taste you,” he says. His mouth is watering at the thought. “I'm going to press you up against that wall and run my tongue along every inch of you. You’ll be shaking by the end, desperate for me to bring you off. Is that what you want?”
“Will do,” Harry promised. Turning to Draco, he asked, “Shall we?” The words died on his lips as he saw the unnerved expression on Draco’s face.
They ambled out of the entryway and into the living room, where they found Bill and Fleur chatting with Arthur.
“Listen,” he said, and Draco started to panic a tiny bit.
“I’ll need payment up front,” the man warned. “50 galleons.” He strode over to the brewing equipment as they reached the bottom of the stairs.
,” Harry repeated under his breath. The woman sitting on his left gave him a weird look, so he wasn't being quiet enough, apparently. He tried to give her a reassuring smile, but he was pretty sure it came out a bit manic. Harry noticed Malfoy's gaze briefly dart over to him; he looked a little nervous, which Harry found surprisingly reassuring. A nervous Malfoy probably meant he was hiding something, and dealing with
“I want to bend you over this table,” he says, panting now. “I want you under me, here in my workshop. You’ll leave here and every time you smell wood shavings you’ll think of me.”
. Draco stifled a sigh and handed the paper back.
Draco was tapping rhythmically on his desk with his free hand while he read an evidence report intently, occasionally making marks with a quill with his other hand. Harry found himself getting lost in the sound of Draco’s fingers; it felt like rain on an attic roof, with no discernible pattern but nonetheless soothing. He fondly noted the way Draco stilled for a moment when he found what he was looking for; then the tapping would accelerate when it resumed.
“What is this?” Malfoy asked. He sounded tired. “An official visit of some kind?”
actually want to see the notes I took for that Potions class that you missed,” Draco said smugly.
“Ask it!” Malfoy insisted.
Harry's palms were sweating. He surreptitiously wiped them on his nondescript trousers, and grimaced at the feel of the rough material. He enjoyed the thrill of going undercover as an Auror, glamoured up, but he couldn't stand the outfits they made him wear.
“In every piece that’s ever worked out for me, there’s a moment when I’m coaxing some form out of it and it just… connects,” Malfoy continued. “For me, it’s like brewing a potion—when you add a particular ingredient, or you stir it just the right number of times, in the right way, and it reacts exactly as you expect. There’s a harmony when I’m working with clay, and I feel it from my fingers all the way up my arms and into my chest. When I know precisely what will happen when I touch a particular spot.
Draco’s answering grin is positively feral. “You wish,” he says, and just like that the room is too small, they are too close, and it’s all Harry can do not to throw himself at the pale blonde git. He wants to rip open Draco’s robes and run his tongue along the sharp collarbones he knows are lurking beneath them. He wants to kiss a trail down the length of Draco’s left arm, press his mouth against the remnants of the magical tattoo that’s still there, an unrepentant symbol of Draco’s past that he’s left behind but refuses to hide. He wants to get on his knees and—
Harry turned back to Ron. “Sorry, mate,” he said apologetically. “You know I’d love to, but I can’t bring myself to leave Draco here. It’s too depressing to work here alone over Christmas.”
“Well then, let’s get started!” the teacher announced. “Welcome to Beginning Pottery night at Diaz Fine Art Studio! Those of us who spend a lot of time here just tend to call it Diaz, though. We run these nights to show members of the community what our space can offer; I’m a member of the studio, so I get to use the equipment here whenever I like. That means the painting supplies, sculpting tools and modelling clay, the drafting board in the corner… anything you see, really. If you find that you’re enjoying this class and you want more opportunities to practice on your own, there’s information about becoming a member in the pamphlets by the entrance. I’m also happy to answer any questions you might have during the break." She smiled invitingly at all of them, then clapped her hands. “Enough boring stuff, though! Let’s talk about pottery!” A few students dutifully chuckled.
“How generous of you,” Harry said, rolling his eyes, but he could feel himself grinning foolishly. “I suppose I have no other choice.”
“We never established rules,” Harry retorted, and cast a
“You’re being very cagey about this, Potter,” Malfoy said. “It’s making me nervous.”
Continuing his ministrations to Potter’s dick, Draco took the opportunity to sneak a glance around them. The outlook was... not good, he decided. He couldn’t see what was happening behind him, but the cloud of darkness appeared to have cut off any potential exit behind Potter’s back. The bed they were using would eventually be isolated from everything, one small point of light in a sea of darkness; tendrils were already sneaking along the floor towards the legs of the bed.
What they needed to do was give Potter a chance to read that book. Draco wasn’t sure what that experience would be like, but he didn’t have high hopes for Potter getting through it in their current situation.
Harry baulked. “What? But that will take ages.”
“I don’t. I won’t,” Harry says, almost incoherent with pleasure. “Please.” He’s not even sure what he’s asking for anymore, but the thought of Draco leaving him behind again is too much to bear.
Potter’s breath caught. “Are you going to—” he started, then he hissed as Draco freed his cock from its confines. “Yes,” he said breathily. “Yes, please.”
“I’m going to start guessing,” Harry threatened. “I can read your face and figure out if I’m right. I have all the latest interrogation methods at my disposal.”
It was a straightforward plan. Well, about as straightforward as any plan that involved delving through Potter’s unconscious mind could be. Draco was depressingly confident that Potter would continue to find ways to make his life difficult.
Potter nodded back at him, then conjured himself a chair and sat down in it. Draco marvelled for a moment at how effortlessly Potter seemed to adapt to the situation; his first act upon learning that he was actually dreaming was to take advantage of that fact by shaping the world to his liking. Shaking his head, Draco began to pace the room, wracking his brain for a way home.
One of the advantages of dreams, in Draco’s opinion, was that the mind would attempt to incorporate any kind of new idea or stimulus into the dream, regardless of how unexpected or unrealistic it was. It certainly made it easier to find justifications for surprises, because when prompted appropriately the dreamer would generally go along with anything.
The longer the conversation dragged on, the more Draco felt he was losing the plot. Potter was showing an even more uncertain grasp of life events than he had previously; Draco couldn’t remember any other patient who had demonstrated such a flexible understanding of the linear passage of time.
“I like to use the studio on weekend mornings,” Malfoy said, causing Harry to guiltily look elsewhere. It came out casual, like he was just relating a mildly interesting fact. “I get there at 8. None of the other members bother to come in before noon.” Another drag. Exhale. “If you wanted to join me, you could.”
“You’ve stumbled into an MLE operation,” he said dismissively. “I’m trying to make contact with an international potion smuggling ring.”
“As sure as I can be,” Harry allows. “Ron’s sister-in-law is part Veela and described the wand-making process to me.” He runs his fingers along the unformed blocks of wood sitting on the shelf in front of him. He always enjoys this part, when he has to choose an appropriate base wood for the wand while considering the nature of the wizard.
“See?” Malfoy said, looking amused. “It’s not that difficult. Now, I’m going to ask you some questions, and you’re going to answer them, and while you’re doing that, if the urge strikes you I want you to reach out gently and shape your clay. That’s all.”
“I’ve just got a good feeling,” Harry had said, refusing to be drawn into an argument. “We’re on a streak. If this continues, we can wrap everything up and have a nice, relaxed Christmas for once.”
“Eyes up here, Potter,” Malfoy said. He didn’t bother to turn on his own, just motioned to his face. He was smirking for some unfathomable reason.
Harry flipped Draco off out of habit as he got up from his desk. It felt good to have a plan again.
“Yes, I remember that one,” Draco murmured. “You lost your eyebrows in that raid.”
This wand will do, he decides. It lacks some of the finer detailing touches he’s done in the past, but now is not the time for subtlety. He tosses the chisel carelessly to the side— it’s worthless to him now that it has accomplished its goal. He’s done with making wands; he has Draco and he needs nothing else. He stops the lathe, extracts the wand and tosses it at Draco, who catches it with his seeker’s reflexes.
“What was all that about?” Hermione asked as Harry continued to pull her further along the quidditch pitch. “And why’s Malfoy here?”
Potter’s breath caught at that. “Oh,” he said. “Yes. I think that will work.” He got onto the bed, kneeling down and facing away from Draco submissively. “Like this?” he asked. The only sign of tension in his body was how tightly he was gripping the book of memories.
. “And I found Pansy along the way and had a chance to make my displeasure with her clear. Have you successfully reassured your family that I’m not holding you hostage at the Ministry?”
“Wherever you would go, just… picture it,” Draco said impatiently. “Think about it really hard. Like when you’re about to Apparate.”
“Hmm,” Malfoy said. It was just one syllable, but Harry knew he was looking at the remnants of the perfect bowl that he’d started and that Harry had ruined. Harry felt a surge of embarrassment; why had he ever thought that this was a good plan?
Draco merely raised an eyebrow at Harry, before returning to studying the parchment in front of him.
“Sorry,” he hears Harry mumble.
“What?” Harry asked. “Let me see.”
Twenty-five minutes later, Harry was bored. He’d never actually been good at the waiting and observing parts of being an Auror; those in charge had quickly realized that he was most useful for the bits when resistance was expected, or a chase might be necessary. He had never really got the hang of reading newspapers, either, so he couldn’t even distract himself effectively. Malfoy still hadn’t appeared; trust him to be late to his own… whatever this was. Harry decided to wander past the studio just to make sure everything looked in order.
Harry considered the dilemma for a moment and was suddenly struck by another option. All Aurors were taught a locator spell that keyed to their partners. It couldn’t be used to track anybody else; it was something about attuning magical cores that Harry forgot as soon as it was explained to him. Draco would probably remember the details because he was a swot like that. Of course, Harry
“Not to rush you, or anything,” Draco began, trying to sound casual and unconcerned. “But how much more would you say you have to go?”
He took another drink, rather than dwell on it. Harry did like the Leaky. Sure, it was often too loud, and the quality of the food seemed to be getting worse, and the booths were actually rather uncomfortable, but he always ordered the same beer and it tasted familiar, and that was fine with him. It was almost always exactly what he was looking for, and it could be counted on to settle an argument about where to go drinking with his friends. Nobody could ever seriously object to the Leaky Cauldron.
“With an invitation like that, how could I refuse?” Harry said. “Look at all those years of pureblood etiquette lessons paying off.”
“I refuse to allow the fact that you’re so easily distractible to affect my grades, Potter,” Draco said haughtily. He braced himself for a battle of wills; he didn’t know what he would do if Harry refused to interact with his missing memories. His whole plan depended on it. “We’re not going anywhere unless you finish that book.”
“And clearly that someone has to be you,” Malfoy said drily. “A very… cogent argument, as always.”
“Huh,” Potter said. “Ok. I’m inclined to believe you. That explanation was far too complicated to be some kind of secret plot.”
Potter knew how to consciously manipulate dreams. It figured; it was just one more thing in his life that came naturally to him.
As soon as Draco’s chest was freed, Potter leaned forward and placed his hands on Draco’s pecs, then allowed himself to slide backwards and forwards where they were joined at the crotch. They both moaned at the sensation, a delicious, sinful sound from Potter and something that sounded like a dying animal coming from Draco.
What does he actually want? He remembers the feeling of attending the Quidditch World Cup when he was younger, and the effect that the Veelas on the field had on him. Draco isn’t a full Veela, so his influence over Harry should be lessened, but this afternoon has been exhausting. Harry had thought he had moved on from Draco after that night they spent together; he had believed he could do this work relatively dispassionately. Clearly he’s been wildly over-optimistic about the whole thing.
Draco sighed. “Dreams aren’t real, Potter. They don’t mean anything. All of this—” He gestured around them, trying to encompass the whole ordeal they’d been through together. “It’s just your brain trying to make sense of your experiences, the same as any other night of your life. So go ahead and tell me whatever’s got you all twisted up, and I promise to be professional about it.”
Malfoy gave him a narrow look, but there was a small smile pulling at the corners of his lips. “You’re doing very well, Potter,” he said, still holding Harry’s gaze. “You should try making an impression next. Nice and gentle.”
“I do appreciate your saviour tendencies tonight, Potter,” he said. “Thank you for bringing me this.” He tucked his wand into his pocket and gave Harry a small smile.
He rang the bell and waited. This was a private residence, nothing remarkable about it, but also the result of three months of work to track down a black market brewer. Weeks of chasing down hints and rumours, and finally the sting.
Draco cracked a smile. “If you insist,” he said. “What are we toasting with?” Harry held up the unopened bottle of Ogden’s, and Draco whistled. “You have surprisingly decent taste. I was expecting some kind of alcohol that comes in a box; this is almost respectable of you.”
Harry studies the stool, searching for any sign of inconsistency or weakness as it sits in mid-air in front of them. “Feel anything unusual?” he finally asks.
“Oh,” Harry said, and he looked vaguely disappointed for some reason. “I guess that makes sense. You must deal with all kinds of weird stuff as a Mind Healer.”
Draco turned and looked. In what had previously been an empty space in the room of hidden things, there was now a four-poster sitting there instead. It was exactly the right size for two people to fit snugly together, complete with perfectly fitted sheets, and fluffy, plump pillows. Of
“Where in Merlin’s name did this come from?” Draco asked in irritation. He had reached over the side of his desk to drum his fingers on it, the way he did was he was trying to remember something, only to discover that it was draped in tinsel.
“Fine,” he said reluctantly. “I’ll tell the Weasleys not to wait for me this year.”
“It requires a very complex web of blackmail and mind control magic,” Harry said. “Honestly, it’s exhausting keeping it up. I’m thinking of turning myself in.”
Draco threw his hands up in the air. “I don’t know!” he hissed. “And I am extremely concerned that we’re supposedly prosecuting someone for this crime for which we apparently have no records!”
“What’s this?” he asked. “Is this your doing, Malfoy?”
“What is this?” he hissed. “Is this some kind of code? Who writes reports in code?”
“I think cousin will do,” Draco said smoothly, and he smirked at Harry as if he could tell that he was trying to remember the difference between a second-cousin and a first cousin twice-removed.
Uncharacteristically, Draco seemed hesitant. “It’s about us,” he finally said, and Harry suddenly found it hard to breathe, as if all the oxygen were being sucked out of the room.
“But today was… honestly, really nice. Surprisingly nice,” Harry said. “Could we do this again?”
“That’s a challenge for you to overcome,” Malfoy said lightly. “Before we go on, I just want to make clear—if at any point you don’t feel like answering my questions, like you’ve had enough of my… unusual methods, all you need to do is turn off your wheel.”
“When you put it like that, I guess I do,” Harry admitted ruefully. “And she’s… treating you well? You’re happy?” He wasn’t actually sure where he was going with his line of questioning. Maybe he just wanted to see if Ginny had any regrets.
“Oh,” Harry said again. “Ok?” He thought for a moment and led with the obvious question that he was most curious about. “So you’re, you know, religious?”
“So we just… give up?” Harry asked, aghast. “Let the criminal walk free?”
“You have a visitor,” Draco said. He stepped aside to reveal Ron, who was looking approvingly at the office decorations.
Malfoy looked back at him, a small smile appearing on his face. “If you'd like,” he said, and it seemed almost bashful.
“The service has already started, but there’s some room in the back for you,” she said, extracting one of the programs and holding it out towards him. “It’s just through there.” She motioned encouragingly with the program towards the doorway where most of the light was coming from. Harry could hear what sounded like a scripture recitation, and he reluctantly accepted the paper from the cheerful woman. “Happy Christmas!” she said. “Lovely to see a new young face around here.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Do you want me to guess how that sentence ends, Potter?” he asked wryly. “Because I can imagine a lot of different ways that could go.”
It was a quiet day; even lunch was subdued despite their new tradition of swapping portions. Harry came back from the outside world carrying Chinese takeaway, and Draco already had a sandwich half set aside for him without even putting up a token argument about the incompatible palates. He accepted a helping of Harry’s Mushu pork with a grateful nod of his head but otherwise acted distant towards him.
“You’re right,” Harry said, feeling his face heat. “I’m sorry. You don’t actually need to tell me anything about it.”
“So Malfoy is… in a pottery class?” Ginny hazarded. “With you?”
“Since you cheated so terribly and blatantly,” Draco amended, “I will allow you to take me out for dinner once we’re done here to make up for it.”
Draco waits to see if there’s more. “Are you finished?” he finally asks, and Harry nods in response. “Harry, it’s been actual, literal years since I paid any attention to your estimates of when you’ll be home,” he says, propping his head up on his right arm. “You are wildly optimistic about how long it takes you to do things, so I make sure that our plans are flexible.” Harry snorts, shakily, but doesn’t interrupt. “None of this is news to me. I made my peace with our situation a while ago, and I. Am. Fine with it. I know how important it is that you continue saving every member of the wizarding world-”
“What the fuck was that?” Potter asked. Draco supposed it was a proportional response to what Draco had just put him through. Potter released his grip on Draco’s hand to run his own through his mess of unruly hair. “Are you actually trying to kill me?”
After the wand is sanded appropriately, Harry sneaks a glance over his shoulder. He briefly catches Malfoy’s gaze before the other man looks down at the book in his lap again, and Harry exhales. Even though he knows he told Malfoy not to look at him, he can’t deny the satisfaction from knowing that Malfoy apparently can’t keep his eyes off of him.
“The course listing disagrees,” Harry said eventually. He looked up and met Malfoy’s eyes, looking relieved. “I only teach Defence Against the Dark Arts.”
like a perfectly serviceable wand—made from aspen, with some of his best surface etchings to date, and a core built on strands from the tail of a Hogwarts Thestral, but when he holds it it just feels inert. Lifeless. Like a block of wood with some hair trapped inside of it. It’s the latest in a series of wands he’s made while attempting to broaden his repertoire of techniques and materials, but it doesn’t feel like he’s making much progress.
“You’re going to hate me afterwards,” Draco says. “You will never want to see me again.”
Harry ground his teeth. “It’s not a work thing,” he said. It technically wasn’t, he rationalized. Unfortunately, his traitorous brain wouldn’t allow him to leave it at that. “Well, not quite. It’s related to work. But it’s mostly a personal thing.”
“I nearly hurt someone with accidental magic,” he said. “My latest partner. She was just out of training, and I was having a shittier day than usual, and all the windows in the room just imploded with no warning, and, well. She was standing right next to one.”
Harry snorted. “Mmm, that’s a compliment I’ll treasure,” he said drily. “Real high praise from Draco Malfoy.”
It was worse than Harry feared. After the first morning of staring at beautiful but inscrutable words on parchment, Draco had tried to find someone from Evidence to help them decipher the contents of the paperwork. Unfortunately, the department two floors below theirs appeared to be a ghost town; all the employees had cleaned out their inboxes and taken off for early holidays.
“Fuck you too,” Harry said mulishly.
Ginny was giving them all a bemused look. “What is going on?” she asked. “Has Harry gone mad?”
“That could work,” Harry said after thinking about it for a moment. “But I should probably be the person to go and convince Evidence to let us look at their records. You may have already burned that bridge.”
Ginny raised her eyebrows. “Lord,” she said. “You’re not dating him, but you clearly want to. This is so much worse than I feared.”
“What the fuck,” Potter muttered to himself. “What the actual…”
Harry eyed him, but no further explanation appeared to be forthcoming. They both stood in the entryway to the studio, looking at each other. “Well?” he said after an interminable moment of silence. “I’m here. What now?”
Potter turned back to the bookshelf, muttering something that Draco was pretty sure was not complimentary. Draco stared up at him, willing himself not to look at the encroaching darkness. It wouldn’t help, and it might even make things worse, if it truly did feed on attention. He focused instead on observing the lines of Potter’s backside, which was several rungs higher than his head and therefore unavoidable, really. It truly was unfair that Potter remained in top physical condition even as a school professor.
“Malfoy,” Potter said from beside him. “Look at me.”
“Sorry,” Harry whispers, sounding miserable. “I thought you were asleep.”
The tips of Malfoy’s ears turn pink, but he brings his gaze up to meet Harry’s once more. “It turns out the other wand makers aren’t interested in my custom,” he says.
Draco wasn’t sure what to make of that. Was Potter’s brain incorporating information he had heard while asleep on the bed under Malfoy’s care? This wasn’t a memory of an actual conversation that he and Potter had ever had. Oh, they had occasionally bumped into each other in social settings—galas and the like—but while Draco would privately admit that he liked to keep tabs on what Potter was up to, and sometimes daydreamed about approaching him and striking up a conversation, he had no reason to believe that Potter ever gave him a passing thought.
be explained away as the product of a flighty dreamer, moving on to a new scenario when the previous one no longer held their attention, Draco wasn’t sure that explanation made sense. Not with the weight of Potter’s attention and convictions in their conversation so far.
“I could…” Harry begins, but Draco hushes him.
“Merlin,” Draco muttered. “Ok, look. I’ll make you a deal, Potter. If you read… Oh, I don’t know, the first few pages of that book, after that I’ll explain everything.”
“Ok, you really need to calm down,” Harry said. “Talk it through with me.”
like you,” Harry said boldly, then he quickly took a long drink before he could see how Draco received that. He ended up spluttering as too much firewhiskey hit his throat at once, but the subsequent coughing fit helpfully gave him more time to avoid looking at Draco.
“Cheers to that,” Harry said gratefully, raising his cup. He couldn’t help feeling slightly disappointed, though—Draco hadn’t even acknowledged Harry’s words. At least he didn’t appear to have ruined anything with his spontaneous declaration of feelings; he had never been great at thinking before speaking. The last thing he wanted to do was make things awkward between them before Draco left him forever.
Draco abruptly decided that their current position was insufficient for the purposes of tormenting Potter. “Straddle me,” he ordered, laying down on the bed. “If you can talk coherently, I’m not doing my job correctly.”
“Oh, Potter,” Draco said, and he had such a fond look on his face that Harry thought he might actually melt. “I have wanted this for… well, much longer than I should have, really.”
“Suit yourself!” Ginny said. “Hey, chin up. These things have a way of resolving themselves, one way or another.” She jostled their shoulders together again, then wandered off in the direction of the house without waiting for a reply.
Harry wasn’t sure why it galled him so much. He carried his wheel across the studio space and placed it so it was directly opposite Malfoy’s with only a few feet separating their two desks. Malfoy actually looked up at this and rolled his eyes, which Harry found remarkably satisfying.
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy chuckles. “What a… loose definition of ‘a couple’ you have,” he says, and when his eyes meet Harry’s again Harry feels himself swallow. It’s a look that promises many things. “Three days it is.” He strides to the doorway, pulls open the door, then stands on the threshold. Without looking back at Harry, and in what Harry is coming to think of as his normal voice, he says, “Thank you. For… you know.” He apparates away before Harry can think of a response.
“Nobody likes a smartarse,” Draco muttered as he began to undo the buttons on his robes.
“Give me details, Jenkins,” Draco said, striding briskly through the halls of St. Mungo’s. “Today, if you please.”
“Harry,” Draco says, and it sounds like a warning. It sounds like a promise.
As Malfoy accepts the wand, his eyes widen. “It did it again,” he breathes. “It was almost tingly for a moment.” He peers at the wand, as if trying to see what’s different about this one. “What did you do to it?”
“I do appreciate the thought, Potter,” Draco said. “I actually intended to leave my wand behind, however. I’m not sure why, but it feels strange to me to have it in there.”
“I’m not off the Aurors!” Harry protested. “I’m on leave, that’s all.”
Harry points at the wand. “There’s nothing inside that except one of your hairs,” he says. “They used to make wands with Veela hair cores; I don’t really know why they stopped, but there are still lots of older ones in use. There’s no reason that wand should work for you unless that’s a Veela’s hair that I put in it.”
Sirius grinned, “Sounds like a dream. A nice clean bright place to take care of chickens! You deserve something nice after all the shit you’ve been through.”
“It’s fine.” Harry said, “Is he talking about the Vanity in the yard out front?”
The snake hissed and slithered back onto Harry draping herself around his neck. He leaned back against the nearby tree.
Hello everyone! This chapter is a little shorter, but it works better with the flow of how I want everything to go.
Harry was so glad that Dobby decided to stick around and help because in order to garden Harry needed a good chunk of these weeds gone, and Dobby was
He waited in silence, but a more peaceful silence with the Dursley’s out of the house and he relished these scant moments. It would be so nice to live in a house and cook whatever you want without the worry of being yelled at or locked in his room without access to the toilet.
“Dark, falling apart, and smells of death? Yeah.” Sirius stopped in front of a door, it looked no different from any other door, minus the worn keyhole on the door handle. Sirius grinned at Harry, “This room, thankfully in good condition, is my room.”
He greeted her and he reached into the pocket that Malfoy had slipped the piece of paper in and Harry gently pulled it out and unfolded it.
“Going sight seeing then? I hear it’s beautiful this time of year.” It was stale small talk and Harry wasn’t sure if Stanley actually mean it but he finally pulled up the ticket.
“Trevor didn’t know what he was doing!”
Sidra perked a little at that,
Harry nodded he listened and felt her heartbeat and he pet her to soothe himself.
anything inside or even if everything was going to be in good shape when it opened.
Hermione puffed up and adjusted her badge.
He was idly holding a razor he had knicked from Duddley’s multi-pack, unscrewing the plastic and getting out 3 more razors for his collection.
Harry took it from her and pet her head, grateful. There were two sheets of parchment in the envelope.
Sirius came over and wrapped Harry in a hug, “You’re just happy I’m not harping about- ‘the importance of blood family’, right? I couldn’t help you before, and I am so proud of you for taking control and finding a place away from those muggles. And now? Now I’m going to help you stay safe. From muggles and dark lords alike.”
“Good.” Hendret said, “Now, take the Potter ring and press it into the parchment next to your name and the dispelling will be complete.”
The snake hissed, pleased.
“I’m not cursed.”
Harry laid on his back and Sidra coiled onto his chest, it was pretty easy to fall into sleep, and even better he wasn’t plagued with nightmares for the first time in weeks.
Ron shook his head, “Being magically emancipated just allows you access to bank stuff like property or money in the bank. It allows orphans of magical families to support themselves and get
to Sidra. It wouldn’t be right just to leaving this place as it is.”
“Come, my pet.” Voldemort hissed reaching down to pick him up, “We have much to do today. Perhaps you’ll get a meal today if anyone displeases me.”
“Thanks, dobby. Did.. you at least get the other things on my list, like the bread?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Adafrid, who had been looking at Harry, looked at Sidra and she had almost half her body off of Harry to get closer to the painting.
“Too bad.”
Was it a trap? Was he hexed? His breathing was short and he couldn’t get his bearings.
Hello all! I hope you enjoy the newest installment!
Sidra hissed in agreement and Harry stroked down her back and he stood up. It turned out there was some baked lemon pepper fish and a bowl of wilted salad in the back that he remembered from about two weeks ago. He threw away the salad and looked for more leftovers and found a small helping of mashed potatoes. Alright, that would do it. He put them on a plate put the cover over it and placed it in the microwave and set the time too cook.
Harry hummed again and closed his eyes. Thinking about the warmth on his skin and the coolness of the dirt below him.
Sirius nodded again and they sat in silence, allowing the company of each other to solidify.
“I mean, as long as you don’t start saluting the ceiling with your nose, I think you’ll be okay.”
“Say that again. Say that again after all my godson has done and been through I dare you-“ Harry shoved his way in between the two of them.
Sidra observed.
“Thank you so much dobby. I’ll see you later.” Harry leaned down to hug Dobby, and he hugged back with a vigor.
“Careful, Sidra’s ego is being fueled,” Harry responded with a shaky chuckle and Jortook smiled, exposing sharp teeth.
Harry, who had been absorbed by the complications of his dill seed question, looked up and saw Adafrid with a knitted brow and standing up.
The ring itself was made from some kind of black metal, and Harry honestly was having difficulty trying to make out what the family coat of arms looked like, but he definitely could make out a skull and… birds?
“Are you sure it’s okay?”
He looked around at the various produces meats and
“Your job is done. Go out and weed the garden.”
“You look excited, Harry.” Was Adafrid greeting and Harry nodded, lacing up his shoes.
The bias was strong in the mansion tonight.
“And all I have to do is show them this ring and…what, exactly?”
Sidra coughed and hissed and Harry choked on his laugh with cough and there was a knock on the door.
Adafrid’s eyebrows quirked and he looked harry in the eye, “What do you mean?”
Harry snorted and Sidra pressed her snout again his face.
But before she could finish there was a shout of a spell and the curtains were closed, muffling her screeching, and wailing.
” Harry turns to Sirius, “She wants to ensure my safety as well as the safety of her previous companion. If you give away the location of where I’m saying, you’ll forget before you even finish saying it.”
Harry collapsed to his knee’s and his shoulders shook and his hands trembled and he wasn’t even sure if Sidra was still on him
of having living family, in one form or another, was a dream he had given up in his first year. He looked at the ring with its engraving on it. It was a family shield of some sort. Wings, and the image… of a little cherub holding a snake. Of course, with all the statues lining the walkway here.
in front of Harry. Like taking off a cloak it was just there! The snake was black, blending in with the ground but in the moonlight, the black scales glimmered like stones. Pink or green as it slithered with its body coming closer to harry. The eyes of this snake, however, were a bright familiar green.
This was nothing like the cutting burning agony of the magic he had felt from Voldemort in the graveyard.
"Maybe I left a granola bar or two in my trunk." He said an exited the room again.
“Fine, Familiar. This is Sidra, my familiar. A powerful, magical, snake.”
Ginny frowned and walked up next to Harry, “It looks like you’re holding your hand up in the air.” But she raised her hand up and gently reached out placing it next to Harry’s. She looked surprised but interested.
Harry walked up to them and they didn’t turn their heads to look at him. He waited but they seemed to only have eyes for one another.
Harry and Sirius passed through the floo and it was as crazy as every parents shouting at their kids and kids shouting with their friends, owls on carts and cats weaving their way through people’s feet.
“Yes. I need you to get me as close to Arundel Castle as you can, please.”
Harry’s heart spiked in speed and he managed to fling himself out of bed and backed up against the window. The door slammed open with Vernon’s purple face.
Sirius frowned, “That’s awful, have some food. That usually helps.”
Harry shook his head.
They approached the property and Harry felt a mental change in the back of his mind where the wards had connected with him. It was like a tensing muscle in the back of his head, and in the distance he could see the wards, awake and barring any stranger from. He felt on edge from this new situation. What could he expect from the wards? He certainly didn’t know what to do if the wards
“Just remember: stay out of my way and there won’t be any trouble.”
“I’m not entirely sure what creature would want to eat that.”
“My familiar is wrapped around there.” Not that Hermione could see Sidra with her using her invisibility magic.
Sidra had mused as Dobby hugged Harry at the end of the second week.
Snakes didn’t have the capacity to smile like humans, but she managed to tilt herself in such a way that made her look very pleased with herself.
“Right. Right, into the car- except you boy you’re staying
“I’ve never seen wandless magic like that in my lifetime," Harry jumped and he turned around to see who it was, and saw a very familiary lace shawl across a short woman's shoulder and she was holding her old crocodile skin hand bag, "Quite a feat that was. You best be getting him home Harry.” He knew that voice. His childhood babysitter.
socks for Dobby this Christmas for all the help.
“What’s an unbreakable vow?” Harry asked drawing on his quickly emptying well of patience.
The snake nodded and looked at Harry,
Harry nodded and started walking.
Sidra shouted. Harry turned and reached out for Sidra and she wrapped around his hand. With his outstretched hand and adrenaline, he could feel his fingers tingling and itching with magic. The moon wasn’t full, but he didn’t need it to be. Sidra was on his side, all he needed was a happy memory. Any memory He closed his eyes and searched his thoughts.
“I take it Sidra convinced you to come here?”
“Yes, Aunt Petunia. Morning Uncle Vernon.”
“It is good to see friends. You’re headed to Diagon Alley?”
“Pronsglet!” Sirius greeted and he released Harry with a hair ruffle, “How’s been my MIA godson?”
“The oath is complete,” Sirius said with a smile, but the bags under his eyes looked a little deeper.
She hissed wistfully.
Harry took a deep breath, closing his eyes a little, thinking back to the kiss just after their Dance at the Yule Ball. How their kiss had tasted like hickory smoke and burnt rose petals.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sidra moved in Harry’s lap.
Harry looks at Sidra and she bobs her head,
Harry shook his head.
“It’s bigger on the inside.” Harry said aloud.
“Alright, this might take the wind out of me without a wand, but here goes nothing.” Sirius took a breath and recited a spell, it was in Latin and it wasn’t very long, but he made a circle with his pointer finger and created a ring of light just below his chest.
Harry nodded, “Yeah, I’ll, uh, try not to disappoint.”
“Not a demon- a
“I’ll tell you about my day tomorrow, oh, and we’ll be having a guest.” He said and Adafrid nodded in his chair.
him. Or worse. He shivered. Being stuck in his room with the cat flap as his only means of getting food was not a life he wanted to go back to.
She twittered and flew up onto the bird mount that he had pulled out from the closet. (which was bigger on the inside to his astonishment and delight!) Sidra was curled up on a rock in one of the windows.
Chapter Seven:
“Alright Dobby, that was quick what did you….”
Oh damn, Harry hadn’t thought of that!
“Sorry, think I’ve got uh, sap in an improper area. I’m just going to uh-“
Harry nodded, “You’ve helped me a lot. I have faith this is something you can handle, but I would like you to make a wizard's oath to not divulge the location without my permission.”
“TRAITORS!” A woman screamed with vitriol, “MUDBLOODS AND BLOODTRAITORS IN MY OWN HOME. AS THE MATRIARCH OF THE BLACK FAMILY I WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS DISGRACEFUL- DIGUSTING- CURSE YOU ALL FOR DESICRATING-“
“Welcome.” It murmured softly and resumed it’s stationary position. The wards pooled around both of them and Sirius looked around at the view of the property and gave a low whistle.
Agreed and closed his eyes.
But there was something different about the carriages. They had something in front of them. The creatures looked like horses, but they had no fur and they were
“No more than five minutes. Don’t make me come back and get you.” She didn’t wait for an affirmative before leaving again.
He asked her and she bobbed her head.
“That is…I wonder what these creatures are! Invisible to me but not to you? Maybe they’re only visibly to pretty boys on the most wanted list of evil dark lords.” She says and bumps his shoulder and he laughs.
Sidra praised raising her head to take a closer look at Luna,
Sirius walked over to the fireplace and grabbed a small handful of the powder and threw asking for the leaky cauldron. The powder ignited and then puffed out almost immediately and Sirius nodded satisfied.
Harry chuckled,
Sidra thinks for a moment.
” Petunia wailed, “We have to think about Dudley!”
“Yeah. I really didn’t have anywhere else to go. I hope you don’t mind.”
Sidra was hissing to herself, it almost sounded like a song.
Jortook spoke of a light air of curiosity as they walked and Harry just listened, unsure of how to provide more information to the conversation. He grew up in a household that condemned magic but wasn’t the most religious of places to be.
He looked around for something else to cast on. He went to the kitchen for something less breakable to test another spell on, and he cleaned along the way. He wasn’t having any trouble at all! It was like his magic was listening to him
The floors were made of wood, but there were rugs under the furniture. Harry walked in and all a chandelier, which seemed small to harry lit up and the glass around its candles refracted the light just so that allowed the room to be lit to a desirable level.
“Yes Sir.” The goblin responded, the voice higher than the other goblins he had heard, “I can take him to Chamber 2 in the west wing.”
And just like she had appeared before him her form disappeared despite the fact that he could still feel her weight on his shoulders.
Chapter Six
Playful, affectionate. It was almost too similar to how Draco had been in fourth year. He sighed leaning back against his bed, staring at the ceiling and counting the cracks.
him on the business and get it done proper quickly.”
Hermione and Ron were going to be there, especially since Hermione had made it a point that ‘since Harry had play Hermit the whole summer he must socialize before the train’ which was her own strange way of saying she missed Harry and wanted to see him before school stress got to her.
“Alright, follow me. Blend in and try to look native.” She said and Harry had to bite back a bit of a laugh. With her blazing orange hand knitted cardigan blending in wasn’t something could possibly be done.  However… the sun was burning pretty hot, and there was a slight breeze. Maybe he could make them a magical ‘cloud’ of sorts to hide them from the muggle. A…walking confundus bubble! There, he had an actual spell to work from. Now he just had to work with ‘sky’ and ‘sun’.
Sidra was amused by the whole situation.
“Dobby is glad to assist with anything Mister Harry Potter needs!”
Harry smiled, “He welcomed you.” They both walked down the path.
Sidra hissed in thought,
“The traitor son should not even be
Sidra hissed with pleasure and postured her head so her scales glittered better in the light.
“We weren’t anywhere near Azkaban. At least, I hope not. Surrey is a pretty odd place for a wizards prison to be.”
.” He mumbled to Sidra who was invisible around his neck and she made a mumbling sound.
His trunk had a couple of granola bars in it, and an old chocolate frog. But there was no other food or water there.
Harry nodded, “It’s hard not to notice.”
Like with the moon he tried to imagine the magic of this wand like a pool he wanted to touch to get a feel for the ‘water’. It was cool, the magic. Like rain on a hot day, and it felt welcoming. Occasionally pulsing, like a heartbeat. The magic certainly felt pleased.

Dudley smiled, “First your parents and now your boyfriend? I’d keep away you lot. He’s got a death curse on ‘im. Freakish potter with a curse that makes everyone who loves him die. That’s why my Mum and Dad keep him arms-length.”
“Then I suggest you use my fireplace to go to a market. I would suggest going to Pavia And Semer’s tavern in Cardiff.”
Molly made a choking sound and Sirius nodded crossing his arms pointing his chin up “You see? Now let me get him what he’s come for and we can
It hissed and returned to its stationary position.
Harry grabbed his spare wand,
Harry frowned, “Really?”
Sure enough, Sirius was waiting by the first gate of the entrance. He wasn’t in his snuffles form but the long coat he was wearing didn’t look too strange. Aside from looking the statue up and down far too seriously.
volumes one through twenty,” Harry answered. “They’re all massive, too. I don’t know what you’re expecting to find here.”
Potter’s gaze travelled up and down Draco’s body in an open appraisal that made Draco’s mouth go dry.
They made their way over to the base of the ladder and stared up its towering length. When Draco looked over at Potter, he found the other man gazing back at him. “Well, what are you waiting for?” he asked. “Up you go.”
The man replaced the flask gingerly. “Of all the… I know this is going to sound-” he began, then seemed to reconsider. “Christ. Just cast a
“Ok, first of all, we
“I can be professional!” Harry objected. “Sometimes rules are there for good reasons!”
“Fuck,” Potter gasped, rutting into Draco’s fist. “Yeah. I reckon it would.”
“All the better for us,” Draco said, chivvying Potter ahead of him into the main room. “That way there are fewer suspicious glances as we try to find the book we need.”
“You read that book that we risked our lives to retrieve,” Draco said. “I’ll think of a plan while you do.”
“Yes, of course your suspicions would fall on his Slytherin friends,” Draco retorted. “How typical.” This probably wasn’t a productive line of conversation, but trust Potter to get under Draco’s skin even in a dream.
“Fine,” he said, getting up. “I’m going to the canteen.”
Draco fiddled with the sleeve of his coat. “I’ve never met my aunt. My parents never spoke of her when I was growing up, and I thought about contacting her after… you know. Everything.” He exhaled, sending a puff of breath out into the cold air. “It seemed too presumptuous. She cut off all ties with my family; I figured that if she wanted to reconnect, it would have to be her choice.”
Harry is not actually surprised that the Manor portraits are enormous gossips. That just seems fitting, for some reason. He refrains from pointing this out, though, since Malfoy sounds like he’s building to some kind of point.
Blaise sighed. “It’s not keeping it a secret if you never asked.”
"I’m not going anywhere until we’re done with this ridiculous paperwork,” Draco scoffed, but Harry was pretty sure he could see the tips of his ears turning pink. “Let’s not make this unseemly.” Still, he reached out and shook Harry’s hand.
“It worked,” Harry says. He licks his lips, slowly, just to see what happens, and is pleased to see Draco swallow in response. “You’re not causing this. Do you understand? I want you.
with it, but he doesn’t notice any resonances or interruptions as he maintains the charm; the wand produces a faint but steady light from its tip. That’s an unsurprising result, given its supposed allegiance, but Harry always makes sure to follow the basic diagnostic methods he learned under Ollivander’s guidance. He hands the wand back to Malfoy, who seems surprised that he’s done with it so quickly.
“I guarantee you that you’re wrong,” Draco said, putting steel into his voice. “The last time that The Prophet wrote about your marriage, it was about how the divorce proceedings were going.”
Harry felt the clay mould and stretch around his fingers as the wheel forced it round and round. He spread them in the shallow depression that had formed while they had been talking, feeling it slowly deepen as he pressed downwards.
Harry snorts. “No, you’re right,” he says. “Look at us. So responsible.” He lays back on his pillow as well, and they’re both quiet for a moment. Then Harry shifts a few times, as if something about the position is bothering him. “What did you do to my pillow?” he finally asks suspiciously.
“I have another idea, if you’re willing to indulge me,” Malfoy said, and Harry looked up in surprise. Malfoy was looking at him, not the clay disaster, and he was tapping one of his long fingers against his lip thoughtfully. “I think I might be putting too much pressure on you. Let’s try again, but we’ll have a proper conversation this time.”
Draco suppressed a groan. “Merlin,” he said. “You know it’s not real, and you’re devoting your full attention to it, so your brain isn’t treating it like anything other than a normal book now.”
Harry abandoned Draco’s desk and righted his spinning chair from its spot on the ground. “Dunno. The archives, I guess?”
“I’ve been tracking your little operation for months,” Harry said triumphantly. “Ah, ah, ah!” he warned as the man started to turn around to face him. “Put that flask down and get those hands up.”
“Yes, the enormous shelf with the fuck-off ladder,” Potter said. “I’d say that it caught my eye. Did it catch your eye as well? I find it quite eye-catching.”
“We were just talking in your office,” Draco said. He still wasn’t sure what had just happened, but it seemed wise to try and maintain some kind of continuity. “We decided to visit some old haunts in the castle, for history’s sake.”
There’s a look of surprise on Draco’s face as he touches the wand for the first time; Harry notices it but pays it no mind. He’s closing the space between them, repeating the words “Draco, please,” over and over. Just as he reaches Draco, overwhelmed by the possibilities of what they can finally do together, Draco’s face hardens and something changes.
“Ah, ah,” Draco said lightly. “None of that now. You’re supposed to be reading, if I remember correctly.”
“Well, you’re lucky that I took notes today, in that case,” Draco said. He liked the direction this was heading. Potter was actually responding to the power of dream suggestion for once. “Maybe I’ll let you see them if you actually do what I say.”
Harry regarded his partner, worrying his lower lip. “So you don’t get together with your mother or anything? Not even for a meal?”
“Oh,” Harry said. He felt vaguely embarrassed for assuming… he didn’t know exactly what it was he’d thought. Malfoy’s reactions kept surprising him.
Malfoy’s voice was different when he began speaking again—it was gentler, dreamier than before. It was disturbingly reminiscent of listening to Luna when her focus was elsewhere, which, in fairness, was most of the time. “When I’m working on a piece,” Malfoy began, “I look for ways to influence the clay. It will respond to any touch, big or small, but in the beginning, I find that slow and steady pressure helps me determine what shape it wants to be.”
Malfoy chuckles. “Well, how do we start?” he asks, and it comes out like a purr that Harry feels all the way to the base of his spine.
“Exactly. His trial’s happening in the new year.”
“What?” Harry asked, baffled. “But… what do I do?” He followed Malfoy, who seemed to show no inclination in providing any further guidance.
“Guess whoever needed them would be out of luck,” the woman said. “Anything I can help you with?”
“Now you take over,” Malfoy said, breaking the spell. He let go of the pedal, allowing the wheel to spin down, before standing up and wiping his hands on a nearby cloth as he made room for Harry to take the seat again.
Tonight’s meal is another compromise. Every year Draco suggests they go someplace nice for their anniversary, and every year Harry says he would feel bad if he were called in to St. Mungo’s when they had a reservation. Particularly for the kinds of places that Draco has in mind, which are on the cutting-edge of the wix culinary experience and tend to require down-payments.
“Uncle Harry!” Teddy cried, launching himself at Harry’s legs. Harry grabbed him under the armpits and swung him into the air, startling a shriek out of the young boy.
to be assisting in a pottery class that I need to take?”
It’s actually helping a bit, he thinks. A few more minutes pass as he allows himself to be lulled by the rhythmic, repetitive nature of the task. It’s soothing, allowing him to concentrate on the work of revealing the wand’s shape. It’s like slowly undressing someone, peeling back layer after layer until—Harry curses his traitorous mind and refocuses on what his hands are doing. It’s just a chisel and a wood block, there’s nothing weird about it. It’s just the repetition of long, careful strokes against the hard, firm wood and—
“Now, if you’ll excuse me,” Potter says, “My wife should be here momentarily, so I really must finish getting ready to leave. It’s our date night, you know.”
“But if there
“Well, Potter,” Malfoy said gravely, interrupting his reverie. “Congratulations. I think we can definitely say that you have made.. something. Well done.”
“Box thief!” Draco scowled. “None of your trickery, now, Potter.”
Casting the partner locator spell once more, he felt a strong pull down the street in the direction of the church. “Huh,” Harry said, taken aback. He made his way slowly towards the church, checking the spell every so often, but there was no change. He tried continuing past it, but the locator bond abruptly changed directions as he began to move farther away from the building, tugging insistently to his rear.
It didn’t help that he was attempting to keep an eye on Malfoy the whole time, either. Not that it was particularly difficult—he mostly sat at the spare wheel and played with a small piece of clay, his eyes constantly scanning the class to look for anyone who seemed to be having difficulties. He would wait until they raised a hand before going over to them, however. Harry never bothered to raise his hand, and Malfoy conspicuously never offered him any assistance. Occasionally, Harry would look up from his latest disaster of a bowl to find Malfoy’s eyes on him, but Malfoy quickly looked away every time.
Harry grinds his teeth and breaks eye contact, turning back to the wand. Somehow when Draco is being a prat it actually makes the desire to go to him stronger, and he can’t really spare any concentration to unpack that right now. Placing one of the hairs he took from Draco in the centre of the two wand segments, he grabs a bottle of wood glue and spreads it carefully along both lengths of wood.
Harry desperately refocuses on his chiseling—there’s now a sinuous groove starting at the head of the grip and extending all the way to the wand’s tip. It’s serpentine, and Harry hopes that Draco will appreciate the Slytherin touch he’s added.
“You’re sitting in front of a pottery wheel. There’s a pedal by your feet to control whether it’s turning or not, and you have some water next to you to dip your hands in to ensure your clay remains nice and wet. Apart from that, all you have to think about is what you do with your hands and how it affects the clay on your wheel as it’s spinning!” She started her wheel to demonstrate; after wetting it with a bit of water, she placed a round ball of clay in the centre. “Everyone, come gather round so you can see.”
He hears Malfoy moving closer behind him, and Harry grabs the dogwood block and spins around, holding it in front of him like a protective charm. Malfoy’s close enough that he’s practically shoving the block into the other man’s chest. “See?” Harry asks, and it comes out slightly breathy. “I start with this block, then I use the lathe to turn it and carve a wand from it.” He’s pretty sure he’s babbling, but he desperately needs to keep his mind off of the predatory look in Malfoy’s eye.
“Malfoy?” he asked. “Why are you here? Do you need help with the assignment?”
Harry felt himself flush at the praise, and he buried his head back in the paperwork. This forced closeness as they spent hour after hour together was a change from their usual routine, where they would usually work on cases together but split up responsibilities, and they would be in and out of the office at different times as a result. Whether it was the proximity, or the pressure to wrap up this case as soon as possible, he was finding it more and more difficult to hide how Draco made him feel.
“I think we can afford a short break,” Draco said, and Harry felt a big smile break out on his face. “Shall we?”
Opening his eyes again, Harry continues: “There was one family with an 8 year old girl. They said she’d been… unusually tired, for several days, and she kept throwing up. I took one look at her and got… there's a vibe, when someone’s sick. It’s just… wrong. You can sense it.” He takes another breath, a bit shuddery this time. “I made sure she was admitted. We were short on beds, so I had to argue with the Chief Healer about it. I ordered some diagnostics, but there were no real warning signs in the results when they came back. Dehydration, and she was still tired. Obviously. There were no tumours or masses that showed up.”
Draco turned to stare at him. “I’m afraid you’ve lost me.”
“Did you lose track of it?” Harry asked. “That’s a shame.”
Harry let out a breath. “Yeah,” he agreed. “I’d like that.”
. “I didn’t follow you or anything,” he said nervously. “Not like, properly. I made use of our bonded locator spell even though technically I’m not supposed to do that except in emergencies.” Harry realised he had crossed his arms, which according to Auror interrogation training indicated that the subject felt defensive, so he consciously willed himself into a less closed-off posture, allowing his arms to dangle by his sides instead. He regretted it almost instantly; his whole body suddenly felt awkward, and he was far too conscious of how his limbs were positioned.
. He waved his hand, hoping to move past it. “You know. Other people.”
“There is something I need to share that has been weighing on me,” Draco said. Harry decided that his soul was going to separate from his body if this dragged on any longer. “I meant to tell you sooner, before the winter holidays, actually, but then there was this case, and I didn’t want to make you feel uncomfortable—”
Harry startled guiltily out of his chair. “Of course, sir!” he said. “Just wrapping up this last case as we speak.”
“It looks like it’s all here,” he said as he glanced cursorily at each page. “There are victim interviews, summaries of key Pensieve records, the list of trainees involved in the surveillance, the list of all items stolen and later recovered successfully. Oof, that one goes on for several pages.”
“Maybe I don’t want to ruin a good thing!” Harry said hotly. “We work well together!”
Harry grimaced. “Sorry,” he said. “I don’t want to rant at you all night. We can talk about something else.”
Uncertain how to reply to that, Harry busied himself arranging the wheel. He looked around for the clay; nothing in the studio was located where it lived during the night classes. He supposed that Melanie rearranged things every time beforehand.
The darkness spread more rapidly the further into the room it penetrated, as if spurred on by Potter’s agitation. Draco held himself very still as it approached him, coating the floor and chair, and then what was left of the room
“I can’t believe we’ve learned nothing from Muggles,” Granger said angrily. “Magical attachments to wixmail! Honestly!”
make something, just out of spite, since Malfoy clearly wasn’t going to be of any help. He wandered over to the wheels that were clustered in one corner of the studio, out of the way, and picked one up.
hand, though, if Draco had not expected Harry to remember the address after the drinks night, Harry ran the risk of looking even creepier.
“The root problem was as I predicted,” Draco said, turning away from Potter to face the others. “Mr. Potter was trapped inside a dreaming state, and I was able to assist him in exiting it by creating a sufficient shock from inside the dream.” He resolutely didn’t look back at Potter’s face, nor elaborate about the nature of that shock. Some things were best never discussed again. “However, there was a foreign element present that I haven’t encountered before, which appeared to be seeking out Potter’s memories and… hiding them, somehow. My theory is that Potter was deliberately placed in an enchanted sleep to reduce his mind’s natural defences against this assault on his memories. Perhaps if we knew what had triggered his involuntary nap, we may better understand how these pieces fit together?”
If this was his normal life, Draco would ask just who the hell Potter thinks he is, using his given name.  As it is not, he just stares at the side of Potter's face as he looks out at those gathered to decide Draco's fate.
Malfoy. Fuck.
Harry cracked one eye, then risked another. It was still dark out. He wondered just how long he had been asleep. Wiggled a toe, then the other one. Reasonably alive then, might as well get up.
After the Golden Trio left, there had been more talking. More debates. Draco had wanted to listen, felt he should. He just couldn't. He was tired in a way he hadn't ever been before. More drained than when the Dark Lord resided under the same roof as he. More tired than the entire year after he'd taken the Dark Mark, while he ran himself into the ground trying to do the Dark Lord's bidding.
