Harry stops to look at Ron for a second, look at the man he’s grown into, and he laughs a little. Light. How could Harry hold that against them when he's done worse and been forgiven? When Ron can still look at him despite being the cause of Fred’s death, the loss of George’s ear?
His lungs are burning and his eyes ache and his chest is on fire. He drops Draco’s letter to the ground, crumpled into a tight ball, to wipe at his eyes, embarrassed that he’d cared so much for someone he used to despise so thoroughly. He should’ve trusted his instincts, should’ve listened to his gut feeling the day he met Malfoy. Untrustable. Cowardly. Disgusting.
He’s on the tower again, has been for a very long time, and he’s smoked his lungs to ash. He’s gone through all his weed and his cigarettes and is sitting there, contemplating if the fall will kill him or if he should just go get some more cigs.
Harry is shaking now, just a little. Maybe it’s from the weed or the panic or the anxiety, but he can’t stop the trembling in his hands. Ron's cheeks are red with impatience and fury.
“You’re an idiot, Potter,” is all Draco says, looking up at Harry, who is half on top of him in concern, and blinks. Then he surges up, wraps one hand around Harry’s neck, and pulls him down into a hot kiss.
Harry has to laugh at the appalled look on Draco’s face. As if he’s ever minded what was illegal before! As if Harry has!
The sun rises high and the monsters in the forest don’t quiet. They see a herd of dog-like creatures with ram's horns and wings, they see apparently non-extinct blast-ended skrewts setting fire to plants with their fiery arses, and a diricawl who disappears and reappears at will. Once, during fall down the side of a steep hill, they spot the glittering tail of a unicorn and Harry’s reminded of the time he and Draco found the dead one in this very forest all that time ago.
After dessert, Harry helps Draco clean up the dishes and wash them magically, which feels somehow wasteful. There’s a dishwasher for a reason and it’s not like the Malfoys can’t afford to use it, you know?
Harry looks up at her with wide, panicked eyes. Trapped inside these aching halls, being crushed by all the deaths. No escape. No escape. No escape.
He’s sitting in the dining hall with Draco, Luna, and Pansy at the end of the eighth year table. There’s a plate of uneaten food in front of him that he’s trying to find the stomach to eat, but he just. Can’t. Also there’s a newspaper in Susan Bones’ hands in the seat diagonal to him that’s he’s trying to avoid reading, but he can’t escape the large bold headline.
He ate too much at Narcissa’s and it’s made him sleepy. That plus all the stress and anxiety and worry and sleepless nights adds up to a mess of exhaustion. He’s practically dozing off whilst a cute boy is trying to make out with him on his bed and it’s so embarrassing. Well, it would be if he wasn’t too tired to feel embarrassed.
He thinks he’s doing Harry a favour, but he’s actually committing a crime worse than the treason he’d committed during the war. He’s leaving a friend when they’re most in need.
Harry has nothing else to say, so they keep going. They spot magical plants, too, including the so elusive Alihotsy, but they’re less exciting than the magical wildlife. Harry can’t help but stop to collect some Alihotsy for later, though, because it usually is so rare. Just in case.
His brain is overloaded and he’s crumbling under the pressure to make it function again. His voice is loud, though. A little angry, mostly upset.
White smoke pours out from the tip of his wand like fog. It’s so bright it burns his eyes and he winces. Maybe his patronus is noncorporeal now, because it seems to fill the tent with light and smoke for a moment, so bright it’s impossible to see any darkness whatsoever.
Once he’s good again, he kisses Harry so passionately he inadvertently moans against Draco's mouth. He’s going to come so fast. Hopefully, Draco won’t take the piss out of him for it later.
He can still hear the tree’s desperate cries, its grief at knowing its children will be eaten mercilessly. He feels sick, like if he had anything besides a bezoar and the remnants of the poison
After a while, she seems to calm down, to be deeply in thought. And then she shushes everyone with the spell
Harry smiles, looks down at Draco’s bare chest, at the deep scars from the spell that he cast. If only he’d known what that spell did before he’d used it. If only Snape hadn’t put it in that damned book to begin with. Harry presses his hands against Draco’s shoulders, laying him down, and leans in to kiss Draco’s chest, kiss the raised scars that his anger had so rashly caused. He kisses them like it can undo all the harm, all the pain, all the scarring. Like he can erase the bad parts and keep the good.
He gets lost in the words for a moment, spinning in one spot to try and regain his footing, but he can’t. Not with those awful words being said around him at an impossible volume. Louder and louder and louder until he can’t breathe, can’t think, can’t do anything but fall to his knees and clap his hands over his ears to try and block out the sounds as the children surround him. He wants to scream to drown out the noise of hateful words, but how could any sound he makes be as loud as these? As the accusations?
Hermione’s hand flies into the air immediately, causing a low groan from the Slytherins. Parkinson’s the only one left, so it’s really just her, half hearted.
Harry agrees wholeheartedly, squeezing Draco's fingers. She finishes singing and playing, but starts up another song. Something Harry doesn’t recognize.
appearance. He’d vanished from the Burrow sometime after the war and had been missing, presumed dead, for many months. Then, one day, Hermione says he showed up at the foot of her bed, purring his little heart out as he burrowed into her scarf and batted at the tassels.
And then Harry shows Draco Malfoy how to pack a bowl in a castle at half two in the bloody morning. And then he shows him how to smoke it from the balcony of an expensive room in the bitter cold with only the tip of his wand to light it.
McGonagall calls out for everyone’s attention, looking as regal as ever at the teacher’s table in her winter robes and a dark blue wide brimmed hat.
Sterling gets lost in the crowd as the song continues and people pat him on the back in congratulations.
But because he’s a Malfoy and he has too much pride to die falling off an icy roof like Father Christmas after one too many glasses of spiked milk, he summons his broom and saves his own arse. When he manages to return to his room, he’s in a proper state and frenzied.
Besides the Gryffindors, there’s Luna, Hannah Abbot, Michael Corner, Pansy Parkinson, Susan Bones, and Draco Malfoy.
“It’s different, for Draco,” Hermione interprets, sort of stroking his hair in a way no one has ever done before. “He was raised to believe in having a good reputation. Most pureblood kids were, because it's a trueblood value, something they passed down to every generation.”
He can see the sparks from Draco’s spells through the exterior of the tent and he watches, silent and afraid, until Draco rejoins him inside the tent.
Draco opens his mouth and kisses Harry even harder, grasping his hands in the back of Harry’s shirt so tight it’s pulled taught around his shoulders.
He also wonders if normal wizards have the capability of producing magical patronuses. Are there wizards out there who can make nundos and griffins? Dumbledore could produce a phoenix, but could he be considered normal?
over his lifeless body. He barely eats or drinks. Just lives on smoke and frigid air and on the snowflakes that fall and gather on the crown of his head.
So, no, Harry supposes normal people don’t have magical creatures as patronuses. This is just another thing to further separate him from the rest of the world.
The pain of the tragedy that is his life chokes him even more than the kiss itself. He is dying, for real this time, and he is unable to stop it.
His eyes start to shut as tears slip down his dampened cheeks. He feels so cold, so empty. So lonely. As his eyes slide shut, he can see the bright light of death and can feel the warm light of the afterlife on his cheek.
“There will be magical healers in the vicinity at all times. If you are seriously injured or in need of help, shoot red sparks into the sky. We are watching, though, so if you somehow are unable to do so, know we’re on our way. Anything that you are unable to heal yourselves will be healed by one of the healers and, for anything that possibly can’t be immediately remedied, you will be removed from the test.”
Or not dealing with it. Harry’d just sort of ignored it and hoped it would go away. Doesn't make up for the fact that Ron didn't tell him afterwards and neither did Hermione.
He hasn’t been keeping up his Quidditch figure since McGonagall announced 8th years weren’t allowed to participate, hadn’t felt the need to.
He hopes Luna’s his partner. After all, she’s the one he’s closest to from a different house. Plus, he enjoys her bable of weird, obscure creatures and places. It might even come in handy in the Forbidden Forest which will surely be well stocked with strange beings and plants.
Then Hermione shows up, looking so full of life that it actually hurts to look at her. Like the sun, she burns too bright, is too full of life for someone as dead as Harry.
Draco wants her to be in as much of a state as he is, but she never gets like that. Has never, really, except for the many times he's almost died. Perhaps, with how close Draco’s inevitable end seems to be, she should be in a constant state of frenzy, but maybe that’s too much for her all at once.
like a petulant child, but he can never return, never do that much damage to an already damaged boy who obviously deserves much better.
Draco is at Harry’s side, also staring at Susan Bones’ dumb newspaper with a look of resigned horror on his face. Harry wants to say something, wants to make Rita Skeeter shut the fuck up about stuff she doesn’t know about, but what could he really do? Try and lock her in a jar like Hermione had? Tell Draco it’s all a lie?
to die. He just wants the pain, the memories, the ache of his losses, to stop. He doesn’t want it to hurt anymore.
Draco takes a moment to recover, breathing so heavily Harry’s momentarily afraid he’s had a heart attack. Merlin, would that be a story. Rita Skeeter would have fun with that one:
Harry uses the new angle to touch Draco’s cheek, lets his hand trail down his pale neck to his shoulder and arm. Then he reaches back up and touches his delicate white hair, curls a long lock around his fingers and pulls a little. So soft. How is his hair so soft?
A shadow crosses in front of the tent, passing over Harry’s stoic face quickly before it’s gone again. His heart pounds in his chest, but he’s prepared. He can do this.
Harry reaches for Draco’s hand and together they step forward and cross the magical barrier that seals them in. Behind it, the woods come alive with noises of wildlife. The sun is high in the sky, but the forest is dark and cold despite the April weather.
“What do they do?” Harry’s not sure if it’s the drama of the whole thing, but his stomach begins to turn.
Harry has avoided looking at him since returning to meals two days ago, but he does now. Ron’s grown up a lot over the past few months, looks tougher and older, scarred by time and history. He doesn’t look like the boy Harry once knew at all.
The song pervades his nightmares as the memories flash up, back from the place he’d locked them away. He sees Voldemort’s hand wrapped tight around the hilt of Lucius’ wand as it pressed Dark Magic into the skin of Draco’s forearm, dark-marking him as tainted forever more. The moment he was Marked will haunt him like nothing else. The pain, the disconnect, the smell, all trivial in comparison to the real truth. The knowledge and implications of what it meant to wear this tattoo burned him as much as the
It’s done so quickly that Draco doesn’t even have time to react, no time to evade. He freezes up, frozen totally, and all the fruits fall from his arms.
all that time ago. It is small, not quite as small as the miniature dragons from the Triwizard Tournament, but still formidable.
“I’ll set up some wards, alright?” Draco says softly, looking a little worried. “You should go inside. Have a drink of water, yeah?”
The rocks shatter and then scatter against the ground, too far for Harry to see, and he sighs. He sighs for a long time, turns around, and then walks all the way back downstairs before he does something he might regret.
No one interferes with either of their downward spirals. No one asks, no one tells. Harry and Draco are just two more casualties in the war that, apparently, will never end. Not for them.
So Harry follows Draco up the tall, winding staircase and wonders what he’s about to witness. They keep climbing until they’re at the top of the stairs and Harry’s more than a little winded.
Harry doesn’t have to explain to the Weasleys what happened, because Hermione lies for him. Covers for him beautifully nuanced in a way he never could have managed himself by saying there was a miscommunication, a lost letter that said Harry was going on a trip. She lies so smoothly, so easily, that Harry wonders what other lies she’s told.
Harry turns quickly to look at Malfoy from across the room. Whatever fight they’d had before the war had been squashed when he testified on his behalf during the Malfoy trials and managed to get him and his mother out of Azkaban. His father, who maintained his loyalty to Voldemort up until his cowardly last minutes, was sentenced to a quick and efficient Kiss to end his life.
“Because McGonagall asked you to,” Hermione says gently, “and because you didn’t want You-Know-Who to ruin one more thing in your life.”
Harry looks down at it, at the surprisingly gentle hold he has on it, and shrugs. Couldn’t give less of a shit about having Draco’s wand, about winning it, about keeping it.
Harry and Draco climb back into bed after their bath and letter sending, feeling warm and clean for the first time in days. Harry climbs into his side of their tiny shared twin bed and Draco crawls into the opposite side. The sheets are cool against Harry's skin.
She washes her hands at the sink, smiling down at the drain, and then she walks out into the next room. Harry’s still pressing out little men in gingerbread and piling them messily on metal sheets, but he’s curious. And then the music starts.
“Harry,” Hermione says softly, “she called on all the old Gryffindors. Everyone from last year who she could get a hold of. Andromeda and Teddy. The Dursleys, even. Narcissa Malfoy offered to help conduct a formal search.”
Harry doesn’t know where the music is coming from or who is picking the songs, but the next one that plays is a Weird Sisters song. One he’s particularly fond of that starts off slow and a little eerie and picks up the pace just enough for it to be almost entrancing.
“As far as the Ministry are concerned, you should have had all the knowledge to brew your necessary potions by yourself. If, say, time was an issue, potions can be brought in or purchased. What potion would you be unable to brew?”
He thinks of a small apartment in a city far from here, Quebec maybe, or maybe somewhere warm like Barcelona. He thinks of the small, one-bedroom flat he’d share with his boyfriend. Of the odd jobs he’d do to supplement his income, magical and muggle alike. Maybe he’d come back here in a couple decades when he can bear the memories of the place and teach. Maybe he’ll get married. He’ll wear a dark coloured suit, fitted to his body, and Draco will wear emerald green. When they kiss, Harry will say something snarky like “Can’t call me Potter now, can you?” or vise-versa. They’ll both get the help they need. Everything will turn out alright.
He doesn’t even have the energy to be upset about it today. McGonagall clears her throat and draws Harry back in.
Draco doesn’t ask what Harry can’t do, because he probably gets it. Is probably in the same set of mind.
Harry turns to look at Draco, sleeping so peacefully he decides they’ll have to talk in the hall. He slips on Draco’s robes, so he’s not naked, and then gently shuts the door behind them.
Harry may be crumbling under the stress of living, but he still has pull at this school. No one fucks with him and now that protection extends to Draco, as it should’ve long ago.
McGonagall shows up before Harry tries to drag Draco upstairs. It’s getting quite late, but what does it matter? School isn’t important anymore. Harry’s not even sure what day of the week it is.
There’s a silence to it that hadn’t existed before, an unnerving feeling like eyes on the back of your neck, that Harry can’t seem to shake. Like the building itself, built up from near destruction, absorbed some of the malevolence and the violence it had endured.
After the war, they both received a stipend from the Department of Magic, as did Harry and every other child who played a part in the final War. It’s enough money to build a life on and it seems Hermione and Ron are doing just that.
“Hermione’s been showing me around Muggle London and she explained it to me. Now go pack up your trunk and let’s go.”
Ron nods, smiles, and disappears around the corner. Harry heads down the opposite hall to the bathroom where he takes a piss and brushes his teeth. He stares at the sharpness of all the bones in his face, almost unrecognizable besides the twisted scar, with distrust in the mirror as he brushes.
Draco slips into the water slowly with his back turned, so Harry feels comfortable enough to take off his jacket and filthy clothes and slip under the water on his opposite side. The water is smooth and heavenly after almost 3 days of running, crying, dirt, rain, strange fruit, and sweat. Warm and smelling like Draco.
Anyway, Harry and Draco are headed to their Unusual Potions class when someone, apparently not seeing Harry at all, shoves Draco hard enough that his momentum causes them both to skitter into the wall. Pain blooms bright on Harry’s shoulder as he slams it into the concrete and he groans. Looks down to see Draco on the floor with blood on his face and tears in his beautiful grey eyes.
Harry grins and nudges Draco’s shoulder a little. Of course they’ll share the bath. Harry wouldn’t have it any other way.
Draco summons all the courage he can find in his weak body and then shakily rises to his feet in the pitch darkness. He removes his wand from his pocket and tries to think of something. Something that makes him happy. Makes him whole. Makes the world keep on going.
“In some ways, you’ve paid too much,” Draco admits softly, “and in others, you haven’t even started. So pay up, Potter.”
Draco’s mouth is warm and soft, nothing like it had been before, but it’s new and fantastic and inviting. Draco tugs at the hair on Harry’s neck, uncut and unusually long from neglect, and it feels so impossibly good that Harry can’t help himself.
That’s all he has to say before the flaming dragon flies its small, lithe body out of the cramped space of the tent and disappears. Its bright glow fades slowly and then all at once as it roams the woods.
Harry stops fiddling with the dough to just listen to her. Listen to the building of the song, of the piano, of her voice. It’s so beautiful and peaceful.
his broom and fly away with explaining himself to anyone ever again. Live a quiet life as a muggle, work a menial job.
Harry is so sad at the thought that they both had to suffer so terribly to get here. So sad and so relieved that they're both still here.
They only have half a day or so left in the forest, so Harry takes out some of the emergency food and lays it out. He also lays out their sleeping bags and lights a fire, because Draco sits some distance away and does nothing to move or help in any way.
Surprisingly, Harry’s relieved. Ron is growing up, changing, evolving right in front of everyone’s eyes. The changes look good on him, like he’s recovering in all the ways Harry isn’t.
Harry feels his fear like a bezoar at the back of his throat, gagging him, suffocating him, killing him.  “Of course.”
Perhaps they’ve given him the O simply on principal. After all, he did eat poisonous apples and was completely unaware of the effects. Then again, he did use multiple spells, so perhaps that made up for it.
“So, what should we do first?” Harry asks lightly, staring into the writhing darkness of the forest. “Make camp, I suppose. You’ve got the bag?”
The lullaby continues, eerie and nauseating, until Draco is incomprehensibly lost. He shakes and rocks himself on the forest floor, whimpering in instinctual fear.
They’re both in no shape to run, so they’re easily winded by the time they reach their room, which isn’t truly that far away from the common room. Harry leans against the door frame after shutting the door and pants, absolutely exhausted. He really can’t wait to fucking sleep.
When he surfaces, he finds Draco’s clean and grinning face just inches from his own. He doesn’t startle, but instead leans in to kiss him very gently on his mouth. Just because he can.
Draco eats a plangentine in the quiet of the forest as they trek their way back to their camp. Harry has nothing to say that Draco will be willing to hear, so it’s better he keeps quiet. Perhaps they’ll stumble back upon the weeping branches of the plangentine tree and Harry can return at least one of the tree's fruits. Maybe then his stomach will relent its tumultuous tumbles.
“I’m completely fucking your life up,” is what he says, breath shaking so badly that Harry can barely understand him. “They’re right. I’m shit. I’m destroying your reputation and...and you keep putting your bloody neck out for me when all it’ll get you is grief!”
He’s fully dressed in a dark coloured suit that fits him like a glove. Shiny black shoes are tied up on his feet and his hair is tousled from the harsh winter wind. He looks impeccable and untouchable, like he doesn’t really exist, like he’s a projection in the wind, bound to disappear when the sun rises.
He’s a little pissed off at Ron still for not even having a viable excuse. Not even thinking of how Harry might have seen a proposal he hadn’t even known about. Ron and Hermione had so easily forgotten he was their friend that it burns.
full of songs that inspired this fic, in case you were curious. I'll link the songs in the fic, too, in case you don't use Spotify!
“That is all I have, love. I’m so sorry for your loss. I hope...I hope you can forgive us this mistake, but I know how a guilt like that can eat you up inside. I know because I feel it, too. I have done my best to return your children to their homes and I...I…” He fails to find the words. “I’m so terribly sorry.”
petrified, let alone now, and gathers the fruit and the surviving supplies in his backpack. Thankfully it has survived the attack and, with it, their potions and ingredients.
(p.s i finished editing this just now, so if u find any flaws, let me know! i don't have a beta, so any mistakes are my own)
It’s a Christmas song Harry recognizes from his time with his aunt and uncle. They’d hated its presence in stores and things because it’s slower, softer. Not as on the nose as others. Harry's always had a soft spot for any and all Christmas music, so he loves it.
Hermione’s hand is on his arm and Ron’s got this look in his eyes like he can hear Harry’s plans to run the fuck away, back to Muggle London where he should’ve stayed in the first place. He could do it.
Harry isn’t sure it’s helping either of them, really, but he feels calmer in Draco’s presence, like he’s the Astronomy Tower, only just barely stopped from crumbling to pieces by a couple of enchantments that Draco somehow always remembers to cast.
“There’s something you should know,” Harry says awkwardly. “I...I sort of have these godawful night terrors now...and...and I can’t really help it, so if I’m loud or whatever...just toss a pillow at me or something. Wake me up.”
“Fuck I can’t remember the exact details, but they’re poison!” Draco rummages through the backpack frantically as Harry’s head starts to spin.
Harry grins up at him and bites his lip. He wants Draco in any way he’ll have him. Wants him for decades and days and forever. Wants his bitchy replies and somehow perfectly messy bedhead. Wants to be his mother’s favourite son and Patches’ favourite brother. Wants Pansy to like him, just so Draco knows how deeply he feels. He wants it all and more and has no possible rational way to say it.
He leans in to kiss him, hand creeping up to the back of Draco’s neck. Draco meets him halfway, already waiting.
He takes another drink of water from his thermos and prepares himself. Readies his wand as the forest comes alive. He hears the thump of paws and hooves in the distance like he had before, but he’s more aware now. Exhausted, but awake.
shopping.” He stands regardless and rolls his eyes, linking his hand with Hermione’s. “Leave it to Malfoy to make us all miserable as we attempt to make his life better.”
He has to check to make sure she’s joking—she is—and then he fakes a smile. Draco’s doing the same thing, looking uncomfortable, but she doesn’t notice.
“Let’s go,” Ron says again, helping Harry to his feet. “McGonagall wants proof we’ve found you. Probably wants to give you a good talking to.”
Harry wonders if his still embodies his father, still stands tall and proud even when Harry is small and weak.
Harry leans up to give Draco another kiss, unable to resist, and strokes him while their mouths clash together. Draco can barely kiss he’s such a wreck, but Harry persists. He twists his wrist a little, getting a slightly better angle for the both of them, and then Draco moans fully. Loudly.
“Fucking hell,” Harry says in exhaustion when the door finally shuts between him and the others. “Why did I come back?”
Harry’s head feels as light as air and his tongue is a cement paperweight. When he slips from the log he’s been sitting on and crashes to the ground, he finds he can’t pick himself back up. His eyes are open and he stares up at the relentless sun through a gap in the trees. It’s beautiful like this, even when it’s burning holes in his corneas, but the moment is ruined by Draco’s shadow. He blinks once, amazed at the amount of effort the usually effortless motion takes, and Draco pries open his mouth. His cement tongue is heavy and useless as he shoves something small and tasteless into his mouth and slams it shut. The rock-like object tumbles down his throat and he, with all the strength he has left, swallows it.
By midday, Harry’s tracking spell says there’s not much distance left to go before the Portkey, so they stop to rest. They’re both feeling alright, despite the general lack of sleep and food between them, and are excited to get the fuck out of this hellhole.
“You know what?” She smiles. “I’ll handle it. You go get dressed, okay, love? Let Patches know we’ll be having guests so he can prepare himself. You know how bad his anxiety can get.”
“Mother, do you remember that Muggle song you used to sing to me? For Christmas?” Draco has this look in his eyes that makes Harry want to want to smile.
Draco is incredibly beautiful, of course, but he’s so thin. So frail. If Harry’s that bad (or, most likely, he's worse) it’s no small wonder they didn’t die out there. If they don't get Os for surviving alone, Harry's going to throw a fucking fit.
Harry eats as much as he can bear, which is not a lot honestly, but compared to his recent meals, it’s like he’s bingeing.
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
Draco’s face is shocked and strangely worried. Like he’s afraid Harry’s going to go back to them or something, but he would never do that. He’d rather sleep in a gutter than go back to that tiny box of a room, to the hours spent cleaning, to never being good enough.
He feels faint, like he might tip over if the wind blows a little too hard. Like his vision might go black if he sits down too quickly. Maybe he should eat something, except he isn’t hungry. He never is anymore.
He cries himself to sleep that night, clutching Draco’s cold, thin hands like lifelines. And when he wakes a couple hours later from a chaotic, entropic nightmare, Draco’s fallen asleep with his head on Harry’s boney shoulder with Harry’s hand still gripped tightly between his own.
His mum, his dad, Sirius, Remus, Tonks, Fred, Hermione. He can smell burnt flesh, can feel the heat and finality of the killing curse that he endured twice, Bellatrix's knife in the skin of his forearm, of claws digging into the skin of his face, of his ear being sliced from his head, and drowns under the weight of it all. It’s just too much. Too much death, too much pain, too much malignancy.
He returns to his spot on his sleeping bag, staring up the thick overhang of tree branches as the screams stop all together. His ears are ringing from the wails, so it takes him a moment to notice, but by the time he does, he can hear a new sound.
Light white smoke pours from his wand like a cotton ball or candy floss. He’s never felt so brave, thinking of Harry’s face and of all their friends’ cheers when they survive this hell, and it shows when he manages to successfully cast a patronus for the first time ever.
He can still hear the Pplangentine’s cries, even from this distance, and knows he will not sleep much tonight.
“I'm fine.” Harry can survive this pain, because physical pain is the easiest to bear, but the other? He’s not sure that won’t be the death of him yet.
Harry’s friends don’t really know what to do with him, so instead of talking about his dark circles or the way his shirts, which had once fit, now hang off his shoulders, or the gauntness of his cheeks, they ignore it. Talk about the new Weird Sisters album or that Muggle football player who is getting international recognition or whatever.
"But, uh, anyway I took your rejection so personally that it infiltrated my thoughts. My actions. My words. Even my dreams were full of you, though at that point I wanted to turn you into a chipmunk.”
Harry has only a moment to wonder if the professors are flying to save him before he knows they won’t make it. How could they? Harry is dying in real time and they are so far away.
He doesn’t remove his hands from his ears, but he tries to focus on something to calm down. He has to focus on anything except the life he’s been given.
Harry and Draco have a sort of undefined relationship where they’re in love with each other and kiss a lot and sometimes have to take cold showers to hide the fact that they’re both turned on because neither of them are ready to talk about the implications there. Which is fine.
Harry’s anxiety lessens more, but still he doesn’t sleep. Draco dozes off after a while, wrapped up in his sleeping bag, and tosses frequently, obviously not entirely calmed by the hotsy.
Harry yawns, too, and nods. Perhaps he’ll try one of Malfoy’s potions tonight in order to blackout completely. Dreamless sleep or Draught of Peace or maybe he’ll press his wand against his chest and say those two unforgivable words and get lots of rest for eternity.
I keep extending the book, because my life is chaos and I can't stop writing lmao. Here's this, the second to last chapter, I promise!
Harry’s still sick to his stomach that Draco could take the fruit while the tree wailed so incredibly, but he has to eat, so he does. He eats a strip of beef that’s way too salty for him and then a pack of water biscuits that he spreads with cheese. He saves Draco half of his meager meal and drinks an entire container of water.
“If we’re going to start apologizing, we’d honestly never stop.” Draco’s voice is still tense as he pulls back.
Draco’s return to the 8th year common room is one of relief. Pansy pretends she hadn’t missed him and refuses to meet his eyes at first. Ignores him almost completely until Draco calls her name once. Then she cracks and says, “Well, it’s about damn time.”
Suddenly, as if struck by the truth, Harry remembers he probably still reeks of weed. He should probably use a spell or something to get rid of it before either of them notices that he’s still high as fuck. Maybe when they have their backs turned he can use a
Draco sobs as Harry’s limp body slinks down on the cold ground and he sends up red signal sparks into the sky. Why haven’t any fucking professors come to their aid? What the fuck is going through their minds? Do they seriously think this situation is under fucking control?
a time-telling spell with a clockwise circular motion like a clock arm ticking, when he begins to feel like the night will never end, and realizes it’s almost 3. The witching hour, as the stories go. He imagines it will be the worst time in the forest. The most brutal. The darkest.
“Every second of pain was worth it just to have this. Have you.” Draco’s voice shakes and Harry just has to kiss him again.
Harry must nod or say yes or something, because he finds himself inside, seated on the ground with a bottle of water in his hand. Strange.
He can’t do this alone. He can’t keep going like this, knowing he’s alone in the world, waking himself up from nightmares with blood in his mouth, on his hands, cold and shaking and alone. Can’t handle smoking off the tower with no one to cast a
“Because you’re miserable and so is he, so why not be miserable together? Plus, The Prophet published another article that may fuck things up a little more.”
Harry embraces Draco, laughing and smiling, because he fucking did it. He succeeded! Draco hugs him back, tears in his eyes, and says how he can’t believe it. It was well-deserved. He did save Harry’s life multiple times. The students cheer for him, so loud is deafening.
hurting me,” Draco whispers . “The way you look at me...the way I feel around you...people are noticing, Harry. They’re going to figure it out.”
“You mean ding dong ditch?” Malfoy’s grinning. “The wizards have a rule like that, too. Expect a summons from the Ministry for using the spell to ring the doorbell and a suspension for a week against foolish magic.”
Draco bobs his head, still stroking the base of Harry’s dick, tongue running circles on the head, and Harry warns him. He’s so so so so so so close.
He gets up and digs through his trunk, looking for something he hasn’t touched all year, out of sheer desperation. Something he’d avoided looking at or thinking about, because it reminds him so deeply of tragedy. Even the texture of it makes his skin crawl and bile rise in the back of his throat. His head feels light, dizzy, strange when he unfolds the paper and he pauses so he doesn’t faint.
Underneath the headline is a moving picture of Draco and Harry walking the halls together quietly, both looking somber and exhausted. If that is truly what Harry looks like—a skeleton with skin and hair, more dead than alive—then maybe he should eat. Maybe he should get it together. Because no living person looks like that.
What feels like moments later, he wakes. Draco’s calling his name softly, almost singing it. It’s a nice thing to wake up to, so Harry smiles, rolls over to look at him. The sun has risen a bit, but the forest is still almost entirely dark. Perhaps with the thick vegetation and trees, it will always be this dark, this damp.
They scramble out of the tent and Harry quickly collapses the tent with the counterspell to the one that opens it up. It takes a few seconds, though, for Draco to shove the unpitched tent into the endless knapsack and that’s when Harry seems to see it.
me?” Harry narrows his eyes, suddenly remembering he has a reason to be mad. “You stopped hanging out with me, the both of you, and then you go to
Finally, they reach a clearing. Mostly, the spot is free of toppled over trees and the magical grass Harry’s sure produces poison pollen or something equally as malevolent, so they decided to settle down there. Draco pitches the tent with a spell—
“You’re so lucky you didn’t die on me!” He says into his ear, tears in his eyes. “You’d have fucking
Harry just looks up at her, all the emotion in his eyes, as he realizes he should’ve just died in that goddamn forest. Would’ve been easier. He wouldn’t feel like this anymore at least. He’d be at peace. Heaven or hell or neither at all, at least it couldn’t get any worse than this.
Malfoy pushes open the door and inside is simple and efficient. Their trunks are already placed at the ends of two new beds with knitted blankets on top, woven with all the house colours, and there are windows at the head of each bed. There’s a carpet in the center of the room, embroidered with a new motto: on est tous unis sous Hogwarts .
He has to put on his pants to open the door, so he does, and then when he makes it to the door, it’s Ron.
“And then we’ll eat,” Narcissa adds. “Let me tell you two about what Patches and I have come up for dinner tonight…”
The trees weeping has diminished somewhat, enough that Harry can think again, but grief fills them both. At another loss, with more blood on Harry’s already blood soaked hands.
Harry’s relieved that he’s not the only one with pieces of the war trapped in his chest like shards of glass. His friends all seem okay for the most part, grieving yes, but not stuck in the loop of war like Harry is. Losing Fred was awful and terrible and so tragic, but Ron is outwardly okay. He doesn’t have dark circles under his eyes or hollows in his cheeks or shake in fear. The only one who’s not okay on the outside is George, but that’s to be expected.
Harry bolts upright, tossing all of their shit into the bottomless knapsack as Draco does the same, and decides he can wait to brush his teeth. Whatever creature that has the ability to so successfully mimic Draco’s voice is obviously a hunter and
, with a rolled R sound like used when speaking Spanish—and it springs up. It’s a simple thing, just big enough for the two of them, but it’s better than nothing.
Harry’s heart is pounding loud in his tired ears as he sees all of the Weasleys gathered in the corridor, looking around worriedly and talking rapidly as they search hiding holes and empty classrooms.
He sees Hermione and Ron on the map before he sees them in person, sitting on the chairs in the 8th year common room, and sighs. As he passes them, he listens to what they’re saying, because, why not? They haven’t spoken to him since before Christmas anyway.
When Harry and his friends show up to the Malfoys, it’s quiet. The house flickers with candlelight and soft, delicate
Lunch the next morning is a quiet and subdued affair in comparison to the previous night. Everyone is hung over or anxious and even Sterling Bones’ seemingly uncrushable optimism has been subdued by this dark night.
“It’s good to see you, Harry,” she says, looking like she really means it. “Have you and Draco been on the same diet? You’re both scarily thin.”
He winds his hand down and grasps Harry’s dick in his hand firmly, mouthing down his neck and chest as he strokes him softly, slowly. Barely there at all. Teasing bastard.
He has to! He didn’t come this far to die on the verge of graduating, on moving on with his wretchedly tortured existence, and Draco will be damned if he plays another part in the death of Harry Potter.
Draco is looking a little green, perhaps worried or anxious, and declines a shot when a bottle makes its way around to them, taking a mildly alcoholic butterbeer instead. Harry takes the shot and then another before he passes it on to Ron who drinks and passes it on and on and on. Hermione wants no part in drinking and huffs at even the thought of firewhisky, too busy preparing for her weekend next Saturday. Susan, her partner, is not of the same mind, drinking so much whiskey Harry doesn’t even try to keep track. She stumbles around, dancing on her own, babbling nonsense to anyone who will listen, mostly to Harry and Draco who stand by the fireplace. It’s the funniest thing Harry’s ever seen and she inexplicably makes Harry happy. Her lightness, her joy. It fills up the hole in his chest that usually feels so empty it hurts.
He searches the old parchment for names, seeing many of his younger classmates in their respective beds, and then spots Draco’s footprints floating around the Quidditch Pitch.
Harry flinches, thinking of the Floo in Umbridge’s old office, of Aberdeen in the glass mirror, of Sirius.
He’s never been this terrified before either, which he supposes really says something about his state of mind in here. This forest has a way of warping reality when there aren’t extra magical creatures hunting you down to slaughter and eat you, so it’s especially malevolent now. Especially with that goddamn music playing.
He’s winded almost immediately, gasping as he tries to stay upright, but he laughs despite himself. Free. He feels fucking free.
McGonagall calls attention to the front of the room, so they break apart, turn to watch her. She wears golden robes today, the colour and texture of dark lion’s fur, with a red velvet lining. Regal as always.
He shuts his eyes slowly, sniffles. Draws a pillow close to him in his arms like he’s in pain, like he’s waiting for it to stop but it won’t.
With the new unity wards, Harry was under the impression that no bullying could occur between students, but apparently that isn’t true, or it doesn’t apply to former Death Eaters. Harry’s been so out of it he hadn’t noticed the way Draco waited until class had started to walk the halls, left extra late for meals. He was avoiding the crowds and their taunting.
“Sometimes I sit and I draw or write or read. I do a lot of reading, actually, and most of it I do here. In the summer, we have these flowers called
He spends his time studying with Draco, Luna, and Pansy, because they’re the only people who don’t seem to give a shit if Harry’s a person right now.
Harry only wishes he had a home to return to to do that for him, but he hasn’t had a home ever. Why would the universe suddenly grant him one now after everything he’s done? After all the people he’s gotten killed?
There’s a letter on his bed in scratchy, uneven handwriting on wrinkled, thin parchment. He doesn’t immediately recognize it.
He sits up, shocked by how real his nightmares still are. It’s been almost a year since the war and he’s still fucking haunted. Still stuck on deaths he’ll never get over. Still trapped in that fucking train station with Dumbledore and no chance of escape.
Luna just wants to show Harry photographs of her Narkskulls or whatever and Pansy wants to master making antidotes from scratch for the venomous beings out in the Forbidden Forest. That’s all Harry has to do and be when he’s around them and he can do that most days.
a patronus anymore, so he’s pretty sure he’ll just die. Draco’s never even done one before and so he’s probably in the same boat, so they’re fucked. Oh, well.
“I brought you something. Maybe it’ll help?” Draco reaches into the bag and pulls out a small glass jar.
Harry sits back up, willing to give it one more chance, and focuses with all his energy on what his life will be like after he graduates.
Harry and Draco share a look and then look toward their friends. They’re all smiling and giving them thumbs up and don’t seem to be embarrassed that they almost got defeated by a boggart dressed in black robes singing a weird lullaby. So they turn and head upstairs, only stopping to grab a change of clothes from their room before heading down to the prefect’s bath to bathe.
The song is about someone lurking in the window, watching through the glass. It’s about slaughtering animals to feast upon, about the perils of surviving a lonely and frozen Icelandic winter.
He lugs his trunk up and onto the train as Ginny asks Ron about what he’s heard of the new 8th year changes.
“They didn’t like how messy my hair was, so they shaved it off in patches. Thankfully, magic grew it back overnight, but that only pissed them off more. Locked me up for days for that one.”
Also in case it's not clear: fuck terfs, fuck jkr for being one, and also fuck the cops for being racist af
Eventually, Harry is too tired to go on. His stomach, which is usually easily ignored, grumbles ferociously and he needs to rest.
This is the same Ministry that considers werewolves half-breeds, that forced muggleborns to sign a registry, that fostered the elitism that killed 15% of the wizarding world and housed corrupt leaders for generations and then allowed them to get away with it. Then Hermione shrugs, giving in because what can it hurt?, and they open the book to XXXX and XXXXX.
“I thought...I thought you’d changed, but I guess I was wrong. You’re just as selfish now as you were then. Have a good life,
It feels so good just to laugh! He can’t imagine why people don’t laugh all the time. Hermione would say it releases endorphins or dopamine or something scientific like that if she were here and still speaking to Harry.
“Also, a bezoar is good in a pinch, but the knowledge to avoid the poison altogether is better. So be sure to study. Practice your spell casting. Get a good night’s rest and eat a full meal.”
A Patronus may work against the lethifold, but it hunts while its prey is sleeping, so it’s pretty impossible to use. A runespoor? Who fucking knows.
“I’m going to Draco’s. It’s okay, okay? I just. I needed some time to myself. I’m taking Apparating in the morning.”
He doesn’t even have anything left to hope that he ends up in heaven and not hell, like he knows he truly deserves.
Draco leans in close, mouth so close to Harry’s, and pauses. Waits for something and then gets it when Harry leans up to close the space, to fit their mouths together. Then Draco steps away and saunters out of the kitchen, grinning wickedly as he goes, leaving Harry breathless and wanting for more.
He leans back against the counter and holds his hands, clasped together, to his chest as he feels nothing and everything all at once.
Harry can see the dark circles under his eyes, the hollows of his cheeks. Can almost feel the exhaustion seeping off of him.
Then Pig is gone, doing a triple axle mid-air and disappearing through an open window with an immense amount of elegance. Harry’s smile fades, but he feels it in his chest like the waves of a warm summer breeze: here one moment and then he's gone the next.
“What?” He turns in the rubble. “No, no. It’s not about that. It’s got to be that leucrotta that finally hunted us down, looking for scraps and whatnot.”
All he wants is to make sure Draco’s safe, that he’s out of harm’s way, that he’s at Harry’s side. Somehow, he’ll have to figure out how to make sure everyone gets the message that Draco’s not like that anymore, that he’s working on himself and succeeding.
Somehow, Ron lets him go. He gives him a hug, tries to tease him about the slight beard he’s got going on from not shaving, and says he’ll send the gifts over to Malfoy’s this time. Says he loves him and then sends him on his way.
The 7th years are abuzz with excitement, because they aren’t the ones being trapped in the forest. But, again, Harry’s not worried. He’s fine. Is just glad he brought his coat to breakfast.
Just under a day left and Harry’s already poisoned himself with his own stupidity. Maybe he’s the arsehole.
He hadn’t realized it in the moment, but the argument took a lot out of him. Poor Draco had been dealing with this for months, all alone as he was abused every single day, because Harry rarely went to class or meals with him. That ends now.
He places his lips on Harry’s nipple, enveloping it in the heat of his mouth, which causes him to moan again. Draco grins and circles his tongue as he strokes Harry, which is too much and not enough at the same time.
Draco’s body lays on the ground a few feet away, useless, as Harry stands underneath the tree’s branches, mobile but also entirely useless as well.
(i prefer open endings in case you didn't notice! epilogues like the one in hp are a little too set in stone for me. obvi though hermione got an O in case you were curious)
“I don’t know...but I don’t really want to talk about it anymore, okay? It kinda ruins the Christmas spirit.”
are you doing?” Harry asks pointedly, hand already reaching for his wand to defend Draco at any cost. “Bullying isn't allowed here. Violence has no place in Hogwarts anymore.”
Thankfully, after the dementor’s Kiss, Narcissa sold the old Malfoy manor and now they live in a smaller, equally as grandiose castle rather close to Hogsmeade, making Apparating easier. There are no awful, traumatic memories melted into the floorboards here. There is no blood, no death, no tears. There is no Voldemort. Not here.
Harry might’ve been, in another time, on a different day. Yesterday, perhaps, he’d have been excited, but not today. Not after this dark, haunted day.
The sun, which Harry can see somewhat now in the sparsity of the trees in this part of the forest, is high in the sky. Almost noon, perhaps. He checks the time to be sure, though, with
He hasn’t been doing so well mentally, has truly been falling apart, and he can’t even imagine Hogwarts of all places will make him feel better, so he doesn’t even respond to the Letter in the mail. Leaves it sitting on the counter of the muggle hotel room he’s been renting, opened and only half read.
over himself and then Draco, who barely notices, and they sit upon the edge. Harry takes a while to gather the courage to speak as he light a cigarette, struggling to figure out what he really wants to say.
Harry can’t believe this. The tree is still crying off in the distance, still in pain while Draco eats her children right in front of Harry. Harry gags and wretches, bringing up only bile. The bezoar must have digested already and with it, the poison apples, so this is all he has in his stomach. He feels like weeping for the tree, for its loss, but does something else. He stands on shaky feet and casts
It’s the eeriest thing Harry’s ever heard. It’s certainly not English, so he can’t understand the words, but he gets the feeling. The intention. Something is watching them.
His body is exhausted, but he knows Draco’s done this for him, so he has to wake him up. There’s no way around it.
“Attention students,” McGonagall announces, “all 8th year students must proceed out to the forest’s edge at this time. All other students are to head to their next class as scheduled.”
“I’m kind of in love with you,” Harry says whilst staring at him, “but I don’t want to scare you by telling you yet.”
“Harry,” Narcissa says warmly, standing from the piano bench mid-song, dressed in an elegant gown made of delicately spun gold silk. “I’m so happy you’ve returned.”
to free Draco from his prison. The look on his face says it all and Harry cannot possibly bear this conversation, so he turns and uses his wand to find the correct direction before heading off. Draco follows behind him, as quiet as a church mouse, as the plangentine tree weeps over the senseless murder of her child, over the kidnapping of her children.
When he arrives, Draco is waiting for him in a maroon arm chair reading a book with his legs crossed. He looks better, has more colour to his face. This is what a happy home can do for some people— it can bring them back to life.
Harry nods, continues following Draco through a door and out onto a patio. There are rows and rows of magical plants out here, growing despite the cold because of charms placed on them, glowing under the brilliant winter moon.
“Who’s left to call other than you guys?” He laughs, miserable, thinking of his dead family and of Draco. “Everyone else is dead or gone.”
“They have potions like that?” Harry’s so afraid to hope that he doesn’t, can’t because hope takes too much energy and he has none left.
It’s reality shattering. Harry watches him, watches his back arch, watches his hands become fists in the blanket. Watches him cry out Harry’s name as he comes, looking so handsome and regal and beautiful it’s probably illegal. Harry is so lucky.
Draco looks godly. He looks angelic and evil and snarky and beautiful. His suit is all black, from the tie to the socks and the cufflinks, and fitted around to fill in the absence of all of his curves so he looks impeccable.
The fruit hangs back where it belongs. Harry’s so relieved he could cry. He quickly does the rest of the fruit that he has left and looks forlornly at the open space next to the trunk. The final fruit, the last to stop the wails, is in Draco’s stomach. Unretreivable.
Harry rather enjoys the lighter course load, if he’s being honest. He has so much free time now to not sleep and to wake up screaming from nightmares when he does and to go days without dinner because he’s repulsed by the thought of eating when so many people are dead and their bodies were laid upon the stone in the Great Hall where he sits. He has so many hours to fill with empty stares and meaningless words and the feeling that nothing really matters anyway, so why keep trying? He loves enjoying time by himself and time spent silently tiptoeing around Malfoy because they’re both apparently so fucked up that they scream bloody murder in the middle of the night.
“I asked her after Crookshanks came back. She was happy crying and sobbing and squeezing the life out of that ugly fuckin’ cat and she was so beautiful and so...so lovely. I didn’t have a ring yet, hadn’t even really thought about doing it before, but I sat beside her and I just. I asked her. As we held that ugly cat. We didn’t mention it to you because you were obviously dealing with your own shit and we didn’t want to add to it.”
Draco blacks out. He comes to with a wand poking his cheek and a calming hand on his arm. When he opens his eyes, he can see the dark, thin fingers are familiar. In fact, he’s held that hand more times than he could count.
So he goes about the motions of this new existence he calls his. Thankfully, his mother is more understanding than ever and allows him to grieve his loss from the darkness of his bedroom. He doesn’t leave except to use the bathroom and to sneak out into the halls to listen to his mother and Patches play eerie songs on the piano that echo throughout the manor like an elegy for Draco’s broken heart.
The puff solidifies into a creature, which is something he hadn’t expected, and the animal rears back with pointed wings, charging head on into the darkness. As it nears Harry and the dementor, its light brightens the scene. Skeleton fingers press in Harry’s gaunt cheeks as the dark creature sucks the life out of the boy Draco so desperately loves and he cries out as his brave little Patronus, a sparrow of all things, flies straight into the heart of the dementor. The goodness and purity of the tiny little bird burns bright inside the dementor’s chest, blinding Draco as Harry drops to the ground, and the soul-sucking being and the patronus burst into a blinding flash of light and disappear. Evaporate.
He glanced at his watch and replied “I can be.  If you give me 30 minutes to clean up and put my things away, I can meet you in your office after?”
I'm fucking hard as a rock. I know Harry is too; he's aching for release, urgently thrusting against my tongue, trying to impale himself on what obviously isn't enough to satisfy - if his pleas of
I almost collapse. Damn, I want to fuck him so bad. If Harry's self-satisfied smirk hadn't brought me back to reality, I think I'd be screaming his name with his dick deep in my arse right now.
I have a phoenix in my bed. I can push him to the point where he thinks he’s dying and make him shatter - under me, around me, inside me ...
that he has so much self-control when I'm already losing it – and then it's too late. Harry's eyes squeeze shut as I hit his sweet spot; I can barely handle six thrusts before Harry comes hard, come ripped out of him like cream from a dropped pot. He tightens around me and I
His dick is still dripping on his belly, but his balls are contracted in anticipation and I have a clear view of his hole; a dusky rose nestled sweetly between his butt cheeks, hairless and smooth, like his sac, for my pleasure.
I wanted to suck it. He stared at me with dark eyes as I sank to my knees in front of him, his hand in my hair. I remember gazing at his dick, with its shining head, then dipping forward until my lips touched his silky-soft skin.
. It didn't take long before we both came; him down my throat, and then me into my hand, spilling on the ground. I kissed his cock tenderly, now once again returned to a perfect size to hold in one hand. I reverently tucked him away and fastened his trousers, placing a longing kiss on the modest bulge between his legs.
I have the Hero of the Battle of Hogwarts in all seasons. In the summer, we fuck outdoors in the manor gardens; gentle on the camomile paths surrounded by wild flowers or frenzied passion under the rose arbour. We’ve even danced the May rites in the garden in all weathers, naked as the day we were born, screaming our pleasure to the gods. I'm not sure if the birds have returned to the bird table in my Mother’s private garden, but I'm pretty sure the house elves regretted letting Severus in past the wards when he found us fucking in the fountain - his face may have gone white, but the air was blue. Harry came inside me with a shuddering moan, whilst staring at our former professor; if Harry hadn't been hammering my prostate into submission, I might have lasted, but the unwilling snort that escaped me when faced with Severus' outrage shorted my whole body and I came magnificently. I am still quite certain that he was more offended by me than by Harry.
I can feel it in my balls and it’s almost painful and my head roars. I press into him harder, crashing my hips against Harry as he gets ravaged by my dick, I slam it into him hard and
eyes staring at me mischievously from his position between my legs; sometimes I'll pull him around and suck his glorious cock while he sucks mine, or I'll haul him up for a kiss and a mutual handjob that will please us both, but
I knew it the first time I let him fuck me - the only man ever to do it and the last. I knew it as he moaned into my mouth as he prepared me, murmuring filth into my ear as his dick breached me for the first time - his first time too, as a top - biting my earlobe in an effort not to come instantly. Damn, he was beautiful. Even then, impaled on his dick, lying on my back with my legs open like a whore, for him and
My aim is to show certain situations that could have cause Draco to revaluate his beliefs and the part that Harry played in those changes. So i think seeing someone die (Dumbledore doesn’t count as he falls from the tower while this is in front of him) would be a big turning point.
That. The motive that brought him there, in the Headmistress’s office. Draco couldn’t understand why people were so civil with him when he had done nothing to deserve it.
“Mostly for  the same reasons why I am not going myself. Her absence will be noticed and that means the Aurors will be involved. Harry has no idea of any of this. It would be overwhelming to say the least, even without considering how an international operation of that sort would definitely alert the enemy. And, well, think about what would happen if You Know Who gets his hands on an Harry with no memories.”
It worked, somehow. Maybe because they had been children who fought; then boys and they had to fight something bigger; and lastly they were men and tired of fighting. Maybe because Draco had really, really wanted it to work, and Harry went along with it. Harry was wise, nowadays, a little in the way Dumbledore had been. Like a man that had lived through a lot and who tried to be better and to be happy.
Potter appeared a bit surprised by the request, yet he uncorked the vial and poured the content into the bowl.
“Calm down, will you” Blaise said kicking him under the table. They had squeezed themselves between Draco and Tracy, but Theo was looking at the other side of the table, where the students were mixed up in disregard of their House. Except for a few, most of the seats were now taken. Astoria sat on Daphne’s right, next to a Ravenclaw, and the other two younger Slytherins were talking to some of the Hufflepuffs, but it was clear that their House was still divided from the others.
The Death Eater collapsed. Draco knew the spell was weak, his new wand barely enough for basic enchantments. They didn’t have much time.
“She got accepted into pre-law at UCLA, and ended up enrolling for a last minute summer program. She wasn’t sure she could even make it to college before, so it wasn’t really a decision at all.” Scott explained, pride swelling his tone.
Potter was in the castle. Draco had known it already, from the Mark, but it had been surreal to actually see him there, still there even when the Dark Lord demanded for his life and his life only. Potter could have fucked off to some desert island or far away land and declared to hell with all that shit. Honestly, some people would have done it. Most, probably.
“Draco” Urgent. An order, and Draco snapped out of it because at least he was good at following orders. He nodded, wary.
He shook his head to get rid of the feeling and he glanced up again. The other wizard was regarding him curiously, an eyebrow raised.
Potter was not stupid, Draco was mature enough that he could admit as much. When bothered enough to put in the effort, he was a decent student, excellent in the subjects that caught his interest. Perhaps not academic, like Granger, but definitely not subpar, like Longbottom or even Weasley. That he rarely seemed to push himself to his full potential was beside the point and, as much as Draco did not understand, he guessed the other boy really had no one to please or to make proud. Even Dumbledore, despite his obvious favouring of the Gryffindor, could not be considered a parental figure. The thought of the Headmaster made Draco twitch, and he forced it out of his mind.
“Scott!” Ellen said, and Draco exhaled. “We were just discussing your bedmate.” She teased with a wink.
“As I said, it isn’t mine. And I remember. . . I remember what it felt like when I went to Ollivanders and got my Holly one. My wand. And this is yours”.
“If you really wanted it so badly you could have taken it while i was fucking unconscious on your sofa for the last two days. Or is it touching me while I sleep too far even for a creature like you?”.
The hour was almost up. Draco had helped a little to look for injured people, but mostly he had stayed out of the way of the mourners. The time was ticking. Fast. An hour was barely any time at all, but dragging on forever. A slow torture that was over too soon. He had kept an eye out for any sign of Potter, but the boy was nowhere to be seen. The hour was almost up.
Harry looked like a child with his forehead pressed against the window and his fingers idly tracing the path of raindrops running down the glass.
He fell into place in line behind a tired looking family, mindful to keep a safe distance away from exuberant feet. He was getting increasingly agitated and the two little imps chasing each other in the confined space in front of him didn’t help settling his nerves.
“Well, you do tend to stick together” observed Finch-Fletchley. Most of the table was glaring at Theo by now.
Draco obliged and he found himself looking in bewilderment at a pair of tiny footprints wandering around the page, the name Narcissa Malfoy written in loopy cursive just below them. “What-“ his voice sounded scratchy, and he cleared the lump that had wedged itself into his throat before trying again “W-what is this?”
They parted ways at Draco’s stop, the Motel half visible at the end of the road. It looked even more pathetic in the daylight, and Potter gave him a sympathetic grimace before quipping “Are you completely certain you want to move out?”
When he was finally reunited with his belongings he sat on the first available chair and opened his backpack, frantically checking that everything was still where it was supposed to be. Only when he had gone through every pocket twice, he noticed the boy from the queue was sitting next to him.
In the eyes of Matthew, Lucy, Zara, David and all the other first years there wasn’t any trace of that pride of belonging. He could only sense the fear of being that Slytherin, associated to the Dark Side even before being able to perform a simple levitating spell, or that Gryffindor, expected to stand up and fight when just yesterday you were clinging to your mother’s hand, just 11 years old and scared. To be that child, picked upon without being allowed to find your own place in the world first. The silence of the Hat spoke clearly. This is your house, but I won’t say more. Make yourself, take comfort and guidance from the people that will be around you but find who you are, be more than just a category. This year the Houses are simple names and nothing more.
“Because I don’t like you all that much, exactly.” Definitely-not-Umbridge replied, grinning in amusement for the first time since they had met again, almost a week before. His eyes danced with mirth, transforming his face completely into something younger and carefree. It was honestly disturbing, realising Lupin was a man in his mid-thirties when, most days,  he carried himself like he was at least a hundred. Draco feared what war did to youth.
At the swarm of heads, mostly terribly ginger, that surrounded his life. And lastly back at his children again. They had reached him and their arms wrapped around his waist, thin faces tilting upwards in a last greeting before boarding the train. He looked into wide pale-blue eyes and green lovely ones and behind the excitement, behind the trepidation, he could sense a bit of fear. With a smile, he kissed his children goodbye and whispered in their ears “It’s going to be ok”.
In spite of the Carrows methods, the students still showed their hostility trough displays of rebellion and pacific vandalism. Messages in support of Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix started appearing across the castle walls and people stood up against the abuse in every way they could. Often the younger students were rescued from detention and Draco strongly suspected the rise of a underground movement that aimed to continue Potter’s fifth year DADA project. The other teachers were clearly displeased and went to great lengths to show their support and avoid the students further suffering, and even the new Headmaster showed his unwillingness to resort to such brutal ways of discipline.
Unsure if it was his now full stomach or the truth behind his Professor’s last words that made him complacent, but Draco found himself agreeing. “Fair enough. I want money and. . . And, I want protection, a new identity, maybe. For a while. Should be easy with your expertise and all, could even rob a bank to tick off your Azkaban bucket list. . . “ He tensed, voice wavering” And I want to know if my mother is okay”.
They looked at each other while the wind blew their hair and tickled their skin. Then Harry asked “And you? What do you want, Draco?”
Draco glanced back a couple of times between the Gryffindor and the box in his hands, and Potter started to look embarrassed.
His father, on the other side, looked on the verge of a breakdown and when he spoke his voice was hoarse “My Lord?”
The sun was now shining fully over the horizon and he had just a fleeting moment of regret for his outfit choices before a cool breeze tickled his skin, bringing the smell of the ocean. He would head in that direction.
“Can’t relate. Listen, Draco, I think we could help each other here. That vial for whatever I can offer, name your price. Besides, I don’t see you wanting to get involved more than you already are, I’m trying to get this responsibility off your shoulders!”
“It seems Potter’s ability to resist the Imperius was just a legend, or the boy truly was a rotten teacher if his little pets perform so poorly”.
It was a testament of what a strange day he had experienced, that Draco let the jibe pass without a snarking remark.
Theo’s face was tired and disappointed, and it reminded him once more of Potter, that time in the bathroom, wearing the same expression. Their thin delicate features, almost childlike and feminine, were somewhat similar and he wondered why he didn’t notice before.
“But seriously, Draco. Its okay to go for what you want” Theo was resolute again, but his voice was gentle. “And its ok to be scared. If you weren’t even a little bit scared it would mean it’s not important”.
“The dishes, cooking, tending the garden… among others.” Potter counted off his fingers, sounding bitter and almost angry.
If it wasn’t for the lack of evidence of misconduct, he would have bet on being dragged into an interrogation as a prime suspect. Even Snape eyed him suspiciously these days. It was almost flattering.
Draco briefly considered the possibility of hooking up with a Muggle, instantly imagining Lucius' horrified reaction to the news. Thoughts of his father were enough to tamper down whatever insanity had overcome him, although his gaze dallied on the other boy’s lips for a little longer than necessary.
Draco’s eyes widened. You are? He wanted to ask, but he heard his voice replying “I am not scared” instead, his usual sneer in place.
Draco couldn’t understand how, in front of assured torture, they still had it in them to fight the authority. So one day, when he found Longbottom attending to his bruises behind one of the Herbology greenhouses, he decided to corner the boy and ask him.
“Side-along apparition, I took you to the Shrieking Shack and apparated us here.” He matched Draco’s incredulous stare with narrowed eyes “I know my way around the castle. And here is Cardiff, Wales. My home, I suppose”.
“How curious,” Lupin mused. “Memory incantations are always complex. The memories are still there, just under many shields.”
“Pretty unbelievable, if you asked me. Arthur was what, 9? 10? Who in their right mind would give a child that young all those chores!” He scoffed, but something in Potter’s demeanour stopped him.
Draco rolled his eyes, pondering if he could flip off someone he had technically just met, but the bus driver was starting to glare impatiently. With a last glance at his future flatmate, he hopped off, muttering “Ask me again when we actually start living together”.
Potter? Potter found the bat-like skeletal horses lovely? The idea was actually a bit ridiculous, and Draco felt a veil of sadness lift from his shoulders. The idea of the Gryffindor cooing and petting the creatures,in the same odd way Luna had done before, almost provoked a chuckle to escape his throat. Then he remembered, Potter could see them too. Harry, his brain automatically calling him Harry whenever he felt emotionally close to the other boy, could see them too. And had been able for far longer. With that in mind, the image of 14 years old Harry, scared and angry on top of Cedric’s body while screaming to the world the return of Lord Voldemort, didn’t seem pathetic and weak as it had 3 years before. Harry, who had seen death at 14 and still wanted to fight. Harry, who had been witness of horrors even before being old enough to remember them. And Draco, that at 14 still lived a life of privilege and love, because even though his parents had pushed him to achieve, they really loved him, had made fun of that little boy’s weaknesses when in truth he was much stronger. He had been one of those people, like his friends now, that laughed at the misery of others. He saw himself in Vincent, in Greg and Millicent and the others, grinning over their victims, proud idiots. Now he knew pain, he knew fear. In the comfort of the forest, in his secret place, there was no reasons for pretending and his feelings were there, for nobody and the world to see. And this girl, this target of bullies like him, could read it all over his face but instead of taunting him she talked to him, like he was worthy.
As usual, let me know if you spot any mistakes or things that don’t make much sense. I think as an illustrator im quite visual in my writing as in i write things like they were an image, so I am not sure it always works. I really want to do some artwork on this as well so maybe one day
I kind of imagine Lupin taking Harry’s place in the quest for the horcruxs but also Dumbledore petrifying him in the same way he did Harry in canon because he knew he had to die that night and that Remus would have fought against it in the same way. Dumbledore never suspected Remus because he never saw the possibility of someone wanting Harry out of that life enough to take measures like that, because he, albeit for the “greater good” always saw Harry as the way to end the war and not just a boy that deserved more
Draco watched frozen as curses flew around him for long seconds, until his wand was knocked off his hand and rolled under a cabinet. Wandless. Scared. Coward.
Then she turned to face him, almost angrily. “I hate it. I hate it all!” She spat, then softly, a dejected tone “Why don’t you, Draco?”.
The little bottle felt tepid against his digits, the last memories of his former Headmaster pulsing with the remnants of great power. Careful to keep it out of reach, he lifted the vial in front of his face, holding it precariously between two fingers. The glass swayed, unsettling the silvery substance into chaotic swirls.
Ignoring the insane urge to reach into the sleeping draught in front of him and lick it off his fingers, well aware it was on the poisonous shade of wrong, Draco had hopelessly tried to mend his mistakes, willing the potion to turn lilac or, at least, not red.
“Enough” said the Dark Lord, stopping the hilarity, and Draco released the breath he was holding. The world had gone fuzzy and he could barely make out words about trees and pruning. The forest, his mind provided, I wish I could be in the forest. Green, dark, hiding. His heart was a drum in his chest, regular, fast. Thump, thump, thump. A rhythm, like steps on the wild ground, running. A steady pace. Step, step, step. Thump, thump, thump. Slowing down. Thump. Pause. Thump. His breathing regulated, his pupils shrunk back, and he was abruptly jolted back to reality.
Pathetic, the dying voice of his remaining sanity whispered in his mind, sounding a lot like the sneer that used to taunt Potter ten thousands years ago.
When the guests were finished, the table cleared thanks to the magic of the house-elves. Draco had barely touched his dinner and he felt grateful for that when the icy voice of the Dark Lord interrupted the quiet “Now, if you could all give me your attention, a special guest shall join us for dessert”. He sounded darkly amused and Draco watched in horror as with a clap of his hands a body surged trough the door and came to levitate in the centre of the freshly polished table, almost above his head. The body, a woman, floated upside down, her neck strangely bent while her pale brown hair almost touched the surface of the table. Her eyes were unfocused, the white predominant, iris almost completely rolled inside her skull. She didn’t move but Draco felt drawn to her, and couldn’t help himself for glancing up in terror every few minutes. She looked familiar but he couldn’t quite place her, making him unnerved.
Well, I did a little drawing of Draco. Im not sure about the eyes but I’m satisfied with the age (I mean I think he looks about the right age).
Draco chewed on the inside of his cheek and pondered on what to do, not willing to comply without a fight. He itched for a fight, his magic coiling his muscles with nervous energy.
Not so long ago, sleep deprived and desperate enough to be considering the daunting promise of deathlike slumber bubbling away in his cauldron, Slughorn’s challenge had ringed in his ears with the suave voice of hope.
They entered a second room next to his, and Draco found that he liked it just fine. It was quite bright, the bay window open just enough to let a nice breeze caressing his overheated skin. It was bare, but for a double bed similar to Potter’s, a chest of drawers, a desk and chair and a single picture of an orange tabby hanging just above the bedside lamp.
Someone was calling his name, voice desperately trying to raise above the noise. And then arms were around him, his mother blond head buried deep inside the crook of his neck.
The adults spared him an uninterested glance and concluded he wasn’t a threat as they resumed their grooming. The little one stared. Draco aimed a quick warming charm at the ground to seat more comfortably, supporting his back on a chunky tree, and stared back. The white glossy eyes of the foal were fixed on him, seemingly blind if not for the precision with which the animal followed his movements. With the curiosity of the youngsters the thestral tilted its head and took a few step forwards. Draco had never been fond of animals before but in that moment he wanted nothing more than for the creature to approach him. I am alone. I won’t hurt you. He assessed the skeletal body, the eerie grace in the slender structure of the folded wings, the slight disproportions of infancy and thought that even if not quite perfect, not quite beautiful, the animal was magnificent. The foal assessed him back positively because he came within Draco’s reach, letting the boy run his fingers on its bony snout.
He cleared his throat, cheeks still pink, and Draco felt a thrill at having made him flustered, surprised that it lacked the old malice.
The woman in front of him was no longer unconscious and was now grunting in evident struggle against her invisible bonds.
My stupid self is still trying to act all mysterious around the second POV, although at this point it’s super obvious. But, well, tell that to my writing mode brain.
Draco meant for real, if anyone was in in need of hearing a sorry from his mouth it was the other wizard.
This new version appeared not to have a care, and Draco’s traitorous mind thought that it suited him.
The sun was setting over San Diego in promising hues of pink and orange, leaving the landscape bathed in a soft light that took Draco’s breath away.
He was panting heavily and his voice came out uneven when he demanded “What are you doing out of bed?”.
He had noticed Potter’s maimed fingernails enough times to know his perfectly kept manicure was the sign of a completely different upbringing.
The second of May came quickly, in a blur of assignments and new dynamics between the students of Hogwarts. A year from the day their school had no longer been a safe place. A year from the end of the war.
“Our time has passed” Theo commented, eying the couple. There wasn’t sadness or regret in his voice, as there wasn’t any in Draco’s when he agreed.
Yes, some scars still hurt, but together the pain was manageable. In the last years Harry’s eyes held a secret twinkle and he often declared his love for socks. Draco knew it meant he had everything he needed. Draco loved socks, too. People had accepted it pretty fast, even Weasley. Ron. They, also, were tired of fighting. And it really worked, they really worked, and the ones close to them could see it.
Quite a few people agreed and from then the discussion became more animated. They were just a bunch of kids but they had grown a lot during the last year. Draco felt like the first step had been taken. Maybe he could do this.
Draco felt his fingers circling metal as soon as the other boy hit the grass below, and he froze. Suddenly he wasn’t miles from the ground anymore, barely feets, hovering in mid air like a feather. Weightless, lost.
“I love her” Theo whispered, elbowing him in the ribs, and Draco, who was thinking that not long ago he was like Smith, couldn’t do anything but agree.
“Oh” Harry said, a bit surprised “Well, I never played before. Anyway, the rule is no concealing charms —” He giggled louder. It sounded pleasantly warm. “But, you see, when making the rules Ron hasn’t considered my invisibility —“
Draco reflected on that, on the Muggleborn students that had to go back to a world they didn’t completely fit in any longer, where their parents and relatives could do their best but would never truly understand them, understand the tales of Hogwarts and the excitement of magic running inside them. Where they had to hide the truth from neighbours and often extended family. From the children they grew up with, friends.
“What the fuck?” Draco glared in the direction of the blur, that now that his vision was settling had started to take the shape of a fluffy ginger cat.
Stay, Draco’s mind thought. It was an opportunity, he wasn’t sure for what but he felt like the moment was somewhat important. So he interrupted “I’d like you to stay, if you don’t mind”.
He shook the feeling off, chastising himself. His mother was alive, and he’d better stop that train of thought before it led to further misery. The Draco that relished wallowing in self pity was gone, and what was left behind didn’t have the time to worry about matters he had no control over.
Yes, still some are better than others, Draco thought, smoothing down the fabric of his shirt “I think I was looking for a confirmation that people can change, that I can be more than the little, stupid Death Eater.” He closed his eyes, pretending to be alone. Imagining he was talking to himself, getting the heaviness off his chest one stone at a time.
“When were you any younger than 80 years old, anyway?” Draco said, tilting his head to observe the other boy with mock interest. Theo sneered, and maybe his lips were a bit too thin to be beautiful.
Harry was where he expected him to be, sitting on the lower stand, next to a bunch of school brooms that had seen better days. He didn’t look up straight away, seemingly intent in a fight against the cuticles around his fingernails. Draco stopped, unsure. He could hear the silence, after the resonating sound of his steps on the muddy ground. Harry looked at him, then, a curious little smile playing on his lips. Draco could barely make out the faint darkness of the freckles against his colouring cheeks but didn’t move closer.
Draco spun around so quickly that he almost lost his balance again, but the boy that had entered the shop, half buried under a stack of crates, was not Potter.
“You know, when you told me, a while ago, that it was ok to be afraid, it made me feel less alone. But that’s all I had. . . Fear. That was my reason. I was hoping to see in Snape’s memories that things could be different. That I could be more than the mark on my arm. But, if it wasn’t for your mother, he would have been just that”.
He barely registered crashing into another body on the stairs. Professor Lupin’s presence was of no surprise, the entire school was swarming with Aurors and Friends of the Potter Club. The werewolf looked beyond his age, eyes wide and circled in black, and possibly as out of it as Draco himself felt.
Being raised in a traditional wizardry family Draco knew since childhood all about the importance of one’s wand. The intimate connection between a wizard or a witch and their wand was considered sacred and the moment they were allowed to get their first was something all magical children waited impatiently and excitedly for. When really young Draco had often admired his parents’ wands, running his little fingers reverently down the smooth wood. Both his father’s Elm one and his mother’s, made of Black Walnut, were fairly similar in length and colour, surely another sign that his parents were meant to be. Draco had found them very elegant and beautiful, especially his father’s, which was an heirloom and had been in the Malfoy’s family for many generations. When in the gardens, alone but for the watchful company of Splinter, he had often picked up the best sticks he could find and pretended to be his father, imagining the day when the legacy would be passed onto him. So, once the time had come to go to Ollivanders, albeit knowing it was likely a temporary arrangement until he would take his father’s place as the head of the Manor, Draco couldn’t wait to meet his wand. The wand that would assist him in performing his first spell and that would serve him trough most of his formative years. It was an important affair. And, as for all important things, Draco had been nervous. He had known what to expect but not what it would feel like because, as permissive and indulgent his parents were on many things, they were as strict and formal on traditions, so Draco had never held a wand before. He had touched a wand. He had yearned to just go for it and grab one, for an instant, maybe just his mother’s. Flick it, once. He had imagined he was holding one, refined and polished and lovely like it had to be. But he was raised to know better, to control his desires. 11 years old Draco had entered the gloomy shop of Garrick Ollivanders a virgin. The first wand had been a disappointment, and in the impatient mind of a child he had wondered if the whole experience was overrated. It had taken 4 wands before it happened. As soon as the hawthorn stick, lighter in colour than Narcissa’s and Lucius’s, simpler but equally sophisticated, had been placed into his left hand, Draco had known. It had been like being reunited with a part of himself that had been missing without his knowledge. His wand, that had waited years, patiently sitting on a dusty shelf, for him and him only. They were a match and Draco couldn’t imagine having any other. In that moment he came to respect the profound connection between a person and their own wand so much that he had never dared to touch another’s. Of course, in school he had bragged about all the magic he mastered at home as a child, but in truth the Hawthorn had been his first and only.
“Harmonia Nectere Passus” he whispered, almost fearfully, and his wand sent a bluish spark. The door of the cabinet rattled. Draco reached for the cage that stood on a dusty desk on his right and freed a little bird, a robin, clasping it gently between his cupped hands. The bird chirped and Draco looked at it for the last time with a pained grimace and proceed to shut the door, trapping it inside the cabinet. Images of Katie Bell and Ron Weasley’s red hair flooded his mind and with a mixture of hope and despair he muttered the incantation. The chirping stopped abruptly and after a few minutes, or maybe seconds, the door opened again. There it was, minuscule, a broken thing, and the silence was deafening. Draco stared at the little red chest, unmoving, and for a long moment all he could see was red. The bird’s heart shaped spot of vivid colour, so lively in death, Weasley’s orangey locks and his face heating violently in confrontation, cheeks flaming red. Even Weasley, the personification of red, with his clashing hair and skin and Gryffindor colours, would look pale in death, Draco thought. His doing, almost his doing. The blood, pounding in his veins, burning around the Mark, red too. Blood that would be spilling soon, once his plan was completed. Not his, hopefully not his, but did it matter? He stared at the bird until it was only a red blur, and he felt terrified, but that didn’t matter either. The cabinet was ready, and it was time. With the last bit of sanity he felt left, he sent his thoughts to Potter, willing him to stay in bed.
