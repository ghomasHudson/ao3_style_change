“Ginny’s seeing someone, you know.”
“I’m sorry, Ginny,” he said, honestly. “I just don’t think I can do this—us—right now.”
“We’re not together,” she said. “It’s not fair for me to keep asking her how she’s doing and what’s going on in her life if we’re not together.”
“Yeah, those who have received offers from the regional teams. Ruby Sullivan from Ravenclaw is deciding between the Falmouth Falcons and the Tutshill Tornadoes. Simone, who plays Keeper for us, got

lose his job, would he? Or rather, he would, but come tomorrow, everything would begin again. He had to stop thinking that this was it, that every time this happened would be the last time. Clearly, sticking to his routine and going about his day as normal over and over again wasn’t doing anything to break the loop. Maybe he had to do something different, something inconsistent.
But when he had opened the note, he realized that it was not a response, but rather his own note that he had penned to Ollivander three days ago.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.”
“What, Malfoy?” he asked in a sigh.
to throw a party?”
Harry tried not to hop, despite the increased pressure and pain.
Harry shrugged.
He winced when the words came out, because it sounded terrible even though he had meant it jokingly, but he was glad when Violet laughed and Daphne blushed harder.
It felt like nothing he had ever experienced before, not Apparition, not Disillusionment, not even dying. He completely lost all sensation of his body, which he supposed made sense, since his body was no longer…there, exactly. He felt light and energetic and strangely awake and he realised he was making some sort of movement but he didn’t recognise what it was.
He had already revealed far more personal information to Potter than was like him, and yet Potter seemed to continually be asking more and more. Initially, Draco had been suspicious, wondering if Potter was trying to dig something up on him, but then he reminded himself that there was nothing terrible he had done that Potter didn’t already know about. That in and of itself was a rather freeing feeling.
“No offense, but I think I could take you in a fight,” he said. Draco scowled.
It hadn’t gone exactly as he’d hoped, perhaps, but it had been a lot better than he had feared. He felt a strange sense of excitement inside of him, as if seeing Draco and exchanging awkward small talk over tea had been some sort of thrilling adventure.
George and Ron were discussing the shop, the products that were selling well, the ones that weren’t, and ideas for potential new ones. It seemed to be a rather animated conversation, with both of them jumping into each other’s sentences with new ideas or suggestions.
“I don’t really have a favourite,” he found himself saying.
Now, walking up Diagon Alley wearing jeans and a button-down, he started to think it was a mistake. He drew enough attention to himself being Harry Potter, Muggle clothes certainly weren’t going to help. He wondered if Draco would think it some sort of insult, rubbing in his face the fact that he used to hate Muggles.
Violet gave a little sigh.
wizard. For lack of a better term, it forgets its previous owner.”
“I had four teams bid on me,” he answered, valiantly pretending he wasn’t feeling a churn in his stomach at the sight of Draco’s chest through the laces of his leathers. “I got to meet some of the players and the managers, and the Magpies just felt right. I get along with everyone, and their flying style fits me well. It just seemed like the best choice, and I haven’t had any regrets about it.”
“Don’t say a word,” Ron had said to Harry, as soon as he was back to his human form.
Potter’s eyes were enormous as he stared at him. Draco stopped mid-rant, his breathing heavy and his heart racing.
“Tabitha Hawk? She was the recruiter!”
“Try and interact more with the set,” suggested Dennis.
“I asked if he wanted to meet for tea again,” mumbled Harry, still not wanting to uncover his face.
“What do you mean, ‘of course?’” Harry demanded. “How does it seem obvious?”
However, once accepted—albeit reluctantly—it certainly raised Draco’s respect for them, and he decided it was far better to be in awe than to be angry. The Muggles who went on that mission had to put so much trust into what they had built. They must have been told so many times that it was impossible, that their ambition was far too great, but they did it despite that, and ended up making history.
“I’d rather do it through you, I think she likes you better,” Draco said, playfully, and Theo shook his head in amusement.

not less.”
“Three minutes is tight, Malfoy,” he said. “And you’re wasting valuable time giving me lip instead of working.”
Granger obviously wasn’t expecting this question, but she was ready with an answer nonetheless.
Draco was taken aback. He didn’t understand how she could tell he wasn’t actually studying Transfiguration—he was, after all, a skilled Occlumens. Was she perhaps some kind of Seer? Would she answer him if he asked how she knew?
than him, and so
He had had no real reason to help Weasley, other than the fact that it had been years since he had last been to Lègendaire, and even imagining the place setting was closer than he was going to get to it any time soon. But there was something about Potter’s face, which Draco had stolen a glance of as he left the canteen, that made his heart rate picked up. He had looked slightly confused, puzzled even.
“What did they say?” Draco asked, knowing it definitely wasn’t as benign as Ella was making it seem. She flushed and looked away, and her lip trembled.
“I have to impress on you the importance of only using one drop per night. While it has no addictive properties, unlike Dreamless Sleep, it can be dangerous if consumed in large amounts. I promise you that one drop will be plenty.”
“I thought you might ask, Harry, so I’ve actually gone ahead and set up an area for you to practice and study.”

“Why are you bothering her?” Weasley continued, narrowing her eyes at him.
“So…could that mean that his mother is the only remaining living member of his family?”
“Oh, I
“I can
The tapping sped up.
She flashed him a beauteous smile.
“Aren’t you?” Draco asked, looking back at him.
“What did you want to cover it with?” she asked instead, looking at him with her head slightly tilted, her dirty blonde hair almost touching the ground.
“Double Potions today and every Monday,” Harry said, looking at his schedule as he plunked himself down next to Ron. “Typical.”
Draco felt oddly numb, but he had a strong sense of trepidation, as he knew the despair would kick in sooner or later. He had downed his drink in a gulp and relayed the information to Luna.
“He hexed you?” she asked, her voice sounding rather intense.
Draco stared at her, and he felt oddly touched. Violet didn’t need to give him an explanation. Quite frankly, he didn’t deserve one. And yet, she had trusted him—a Death Eater—enough to tell him that her little sister was a Squib. She didn’t think him a bad person—which was more than he could say for most people.
Waya’s expression was very serious.
“Right,” Potter nodded, picking up his own textbook and walking over to the storage closet. Draco, meanwhile, tried to think of how to answer Potter’s question.
Vogel and Bradshaw chuckled, graciously.
It had been agonizing, but the split had been what finally pushed Harry into taking his mental health seriously and working properly and honestly with Rhiannon in order to restructure his life in a way that was healthy.
Warm, orange flames immediately flared up under the cauldron. Malfoy looked somewhat put out, but didn’t say anything; instead he reached over and grabbed the ground up ginger root from Harry’s side of the table and poured it into the cauldron.
“I suppose not, then.”
“I want to go to the Ollivander’s branch down there.”
Pansy snorted.
Potter, once again, looked mildly embarrassed.
Harry took a deep, shaking breath.
“Git. Get back to your flower book, I have homework to do.”
“Easy, tiger,” he murmured, when Potter tugged at his shirt so hard that several buttons popped free. Potter pulled away, looking at Draco as though he was seeing him for the first time.
Waya smirked.
Before opening up the shop today, he took the extra few steps down the south side of Diagon Alley to Prospero’s Potions Emporium. It was still early enough, and it had been a while since he had stopped by to catch up with Theo. The young shop assistant, Willa, looked up when the door opened and waved when she recognized him.
, but he couldn’t. So his father had pushed him aside and done it instead.
Harry gripped the table tightly and squeezed his eyes shut, trying to force the memory down, trying to push it into the crevices of his mind, where he didn’t have to deal with it.
“Understood, Granger,” said Jamison, speaking through nearly gritted teeth. “Are we done here?”
Draco’s eyes narrowed.
“Would it be weird for you if Ginny started dating someone new?” she asked.
“Isn’t it a bit too late?”
“Please, sit.”
Waya regarded Foxblade gently.
Granger had a smile on her face again, a big one, showing off her white teeth. For a moment, Draco was distracted. He vaguely remembered Granger having sort of bucked teeth when she was younger. Perhaps she had grown into them.
He had melted into the kiss, not even feeling embarrassed when a tear slid down his cheek.
“Oh,” she said, and her sudden speechlessness had Harry hastening to clarify.
“’Mione managed to get us a reservation at Lègendaire. She says she wants it to be nice for our anniversary, but I’m terrified I’m going to get us tossed out for using the wrong fork or something.”
“How about some nuts? I think I have some walnuts. I was going to make some candied walnuts, but I’m sure I can spare a few.”
AHHHHH!!! AHH!
“Because I asked not to be.”
“No,” she said, sharply. “I painted myself. It was one of the only things I was allowed to do—paint.”
“I’m well aware of your turbulent relationship,” he said, in an assuring voice. “Professor McGonagall has given me the highlights.”
“Er…okay,” Potter said, turning slightly to look at him. “What?”
With Simone, it was always powerful, fervent, all-consuming, and Harry
“She’s in a class with us, isn’t she? I’ve seen her before.” Potter looked quite puzzled.
The man in charge of wardrobe, a slender man named Gabriel, was pleasant, and it seemed like he’d been warned about Harry’s dislike and inexperience with this type of work.
“I forgive you, Draco.”
“How do you study that?”
” he demanded. “I don’t need you to be
“Please,” he said, and waited as she carefully poured before lifting the glass and taking a whiff. He could always count on Daphne to have these lovely little surprises that reminded him of home. He supposed it was largely due to the fact that they were both raised in traditional pureblood families.
Harry looked at him, still stirring the potion with one hand and shelling iguana eggs effortlessly with the other.
“Alright, that doesn’t sound too bad,” Ron said. “So did he Owl back?”
“What do you mean?”
“Because I’d like to,” he said. “I liked listening to you talk, about your books and your job and stuff. I like how you laugh, and your Muggle notebook and the fact that you make candied walnuts. And now, I can even respond.”
“Slow down, Potter,” Draco muttered, catching up to Potter as they stepped across the threshold into the house.
Sugarplum’s was a bit of a guilty pleasure for Draco, an opportunity to indulge in his sweet tooth as well as an odd, clumsy sort of nostalgia, as it reminded him of Honeydukes with its bright colours and the scent of sugar in the air and the early years of Hogwarts, before everything had gone to hell. Being that it was right next door to Ollivander’s, it was easy to jump in for a quick break while crafting.
“I wanted to make sure you were alright,” Draco murmured, walking over and sitting beside Theo on the side of the bed.
“I remember her boggart? It was a girl bleeding. A girl who looked like her. Did someone in her family die?”
hello, lovely readers. thank you so much for your kind comments, as always, I'm so glad you're enjoying the story <3
It was Draco’s turn to stare.
“But…who will take over for him?” questioned Harry.
“You are not permitted to utilize time magic, Officer Granger,” said Jamison, sternly. “Only Unspeakables can—”
Hermione’s plastered-on smile immediately vanished, replaced by a worried expression.
But Draco valued that Potter was letting him see these parts of himself. He liked knowing what made Potter tick—what made him angry, what relaxed him, what made him laugh, what made him upset. He felt like he was being allowed in to some sort of exclusive club—the people that Potter trusted. It felt good, having Potter’s trust. He didn’t want to lose it.
“Is there a reason you’re reading a Muggle book about flowers?”
Kreacher was in the kitchen when Harry descended the stairs, with a veritable
“You too,” said Harry, and watched as Ron’s head disappeared, leaving the low flames flickering on their own. Harry watched them for a while, contemplating.
it. The stones might have been repaired, but walking the halls still reminded Harry what had happened here.
And yes, having forty-three children by six separate women
Draco distractedly skimmed over the article, which didn’t amount to much beyond speculation, flipping to the next page as he returned to the other room and began to dress.
Draco ducked his head, willing the heat that bloomed in his cheeks to disappear. He couldn’t help but feel proud of himself, having just cast a Shield Charm so powerful it knocked Potter backwards.
“I forgot you were as well,” Draco admitted, sheepishly. He felt a prickle of guilt wash over him. Of course Theo would be staying. Both of his parents were dead.
The owl hooted and Draco reached over to untie the parcel before the bird got too impatient. As soon as he was free, the owl took flight, before Draco even had the chance to offer him a treat.
“Shut up!” she yelled. “We’re talking about you and this potentially disastrous situation you’ve gotten yourself into!”
“Don’t sound so shocked. What have I been doing for the last two months, Potter? Yes, I’ll help you. But for now, let me read.”
“Why are you being so…so
“Er…the Biting Nettle?” Harry had responded, a question in his voice.
Draco woke to a familiar tapping sound.
Harry decided to call it a day, wiping his forehead and feeling an uncomfortable trickle of sweat running down his back. It wasn’t the warmest of days, but the sun was out, so he’d taken to his garden to plant for the winter season. He ended up doing far more than he’d planned, digging up a whole new plot of earth to plant snowdrops and peas.
Draco wanted to say.
He said as much, asking, “So the hawthorn wand
“Spending a lot of time on Knockturn Alley these days, Draco?”
His mind was blank; the feeling of Potter’s lips, of his hand gripping at Draco’s arm, of his hair between Draco’s fingers, it was too overwhelming. Every other thought, every other sensation, had vanished. All he could feel was Potter, his warm mouth moving so deliciously against Draco’s, and nothing existed but this, the minor push of the rim of Potter’s glasses against his cheekbones, and the tangled hair he wove through with his fingers, and the heady taste of Potter’s tongue.
“Outstanding job, my boy, simply outstanding,” Ollivander was saying, but Draco was far too distracted by the wand he held in his hands. It wasn’t a particularly handsome wand, but it was a
So maybe…maybe it was possible. Harry liked to think he was rather in touch with his emotions. He never felt the need to push them down the way Ron sometimes did, or grapple with the logic of them the way Hermione would.
“If your father were here, he would be furious,” she’d said, testing a different tactic.
Harry did. The thought seemed to follow him; even when he was consciously trying to focus on something else, it was still there, obnoxiously shoving its way to the front of his mind. It didn’t even matter that it was exam season, or that he needed to sleep at night, somehow for the following 48 hours, his mind was quite fully occupied with thoughts of Draco Malfoy.
Draco stared at her, trying to find some way to make sense of it all, to find a logical explanation. It was true that it wasn’t Draco himself who locked Ollivander in the Malfoy dungeons, but he had been responsible for bringing food down to the prisoners, and he hadn’t released them. The Lovegood girl had been there, too, and Dean Thomas, and that goblin.
“Alright. One drink. I’d like it acknowledged that I still think that this is mad though.”
“Right,” Harry agreed, suddenly feeling a lot lighter after this confession.
That responsibility. We all have scars, but…some of us earned them.”
“She certainly is, but she’s also only, what, twenty-two?”
“I can’t believe
“Yeah, I didn’t know she used to play for the team, I thought she was just a recruiter.”
me, Potter.”
“Oh, he likes you!” Luna cried, delightedly, and Draco couldn’t help but smile.
a job, he was sitting on piles of gold already and could easily just live off of being the Saviour of the Wizarding World for the rest of his life. More than once, Draco had the ridiculous thought that Potter had come back merely to terrorise him, since with him present, Draco found it all the more difficult to focus on classes.
Ashworth chuckled warmly.

He never heard another thought about him.
“Okay,” Harry said, not wanting to push her any further. He still wasn’t sure he understood the complex relationship between his two best friends, but he supposed he never really would—it was their thing. And if Hermione was fine with Ron dating Sophie, then so was Harry.
His nineteenth was genuine, good fun. The Weasleys threw him a party, cake and presents and all the things he had always wanted growing up. Afterwards, Ron and Hermione took him out for a drink with some other friends, a proper adult celebration, or so they said. He had thoroughly enjoyed himself and thanked his friends for a good time.
Hermione looked up from whatever schoolwork she was focusing on to raise her eyebrows at him.
” Draco burst out, staring at Violet. She looked at him as if just realizing he was there and her plump lips spread into a broad grin.
“Come back to bed,” Draco had said, patting the sheet beside him. “Take your mind off of things.”
Waya, who had been observing Malfoy and Foxblade carefully, waved his hand at the desk and the boggart was forced back into its drawers. The class was silent. Everyone was staring at the Slytherins.
Draco stayed rooted to the spot, not wanting anyone to walk behind him. Hero Potter may have saved him from getting hexed this time, but Draco was taking no chances. Once everyone was already up the stairs, Draco allowed himself to follow.
“HOW WAS YOUR EASTER?” was the question Potter decided to greet him with in their first Potions lesson after the holidays.
he had seen Daphne on the way up to the Founder’s Tower, so perhaps it wouldn’t be
“So is that what you want to do after Hogwarts? Open an apothecary?” asked Draco. Theo nodded enthusiastically.
He looked at Draco, somewhat pleadingly. Draco sighed. Sometimes he wondered why his friends expected it to be easier for him to talk about the war.
“Yes, sir, Hermione made sure I understood that loud and clear.”
“After you,” he said, opening it.
Draco couldn’t stop thinking about Potter.
“Don’t be sorry, mate,” Ron was quick to chime in. “We were just confused is all.”

With the wards dismantled and the coast clear, they encroached upon the house, Draco checking for curses along the way. His nerves were on edge, they always were in the field. Draco excelled at investigative work, but fieldwork was really Potter’s forte. It just seemed to come naturally to him, he fought like he was born for it, his movements almost seeming choreographed, almost graceful in a way, but still emanating with intense power.
“Look at that, Wilkins, got yourself a boyfriend. Didn’t know Death Eaters were your type.”
“I’m not really sure,” Harry replied. “At first, I had this thought that I was hungry. But I was in the middle of eating. And then I thought, that it was too early to drink alcohol and that, I didn’t have anything worth drinking anyway. But, it wasn’t me. I didn’t even want to drink. I just don’t know where it came from.”
“See what?” asked Sophie, her eyebrows knitted, looking more curious than anything else.
“Wine, Draco?” Daphne offered, holding a decanter of deep red liquid aloft. Draco squinted at it, unsure if the slightest sparkling was due to the light or the wine itself.
This statement took Harry by surprise, purely because it was…
He closed his mouth suddenly, realizing how much he was letting spill out. He felt as if he’d lost his mind. What was he doing, exposing all of these weaknesses to Potter? Talking about his feelings? Who was he becoming? Potter was staring at him as if he’d grown another head, a mixture of shock and awe in his face.
It didn’t matter who it was, Potter would stand up to anyone who dared badmouth his friends because that’s just the kind of person he was. When Draco confronted this fact, he became uncomfortably aware of the yearning deep, deep inside of him. The desire that someone defend him like that, that someone believe so truly in him that they would stand by his side no matter what, even when he wasn’t around. He wanted to be Potter’s friend.
“Of course it has to happen to me,” he mumbled, and Dean chuckled from his right, slapping a comforting hand on his shoulder.
“There’s Tobias Harper, you know, that annoying one who played backup Seeker for you sixth year? Sort of looks like a rat?” at Draco’s nod, Daphne continued, “Then there’s Edgar Caverly; he’s a weird sort, rather quiet, but he speaks mermish for some odd reason, so he was always pressed up against the glass in the Slytherin common room, talking to the merpeople. And then there’s Ella Wilkins. She’s the only girl who stayed, so they’ve got her in the dorm with Astoria and the other sixth-year girls.”
“Did you have trouble finding the place? It’s rather dingy, I know,” Pansy said, waving a hand haphazardly at the darkness beyond their illuminated table. “But I thought quiet might be better, to actually hear each other.”
“Draco,” Harry said, firmly, cradling Draco’s face in his hand. “I haven’t…I’m not used to being touched. To being held. It’s just…another thing I didn’t have as a kid. But that doesn’t mean I don’t like it. It doesn’t mean I don’t crave it. I just…I don’t know what I’m doing, when it comes to that. When it comes to affection.”
“Ah, Draco!” cried Dennis, pulling the attention of both of them back to the camera.
“Misery loves company, it seems,” Ron nodded glumly, not looking nearly as excited about his pancakes as he had a mere thirty seconds ago.
He returned to the Ministry, but avoided the W.A.S. office, instead wandering into the Auror Headquarters.
He hadn’t realised he was gripping onto Potter’s arm until Potter’s hand came to rest upon his.
“Sorry, I just want to finish up this chapter before lunch,” she apologized with a grimace.
“I suppose we sort of did, but it wasn’t anything real. Just me wanting to live up to my father’s expectations and pretending I liked her more than I did because of her name.”
“A yes to what?” asked Malfoy.
“It does?” Draco asked, suddenly feeling rather stupid.
He wondered if the long stretches between practice sessions would slow him down, and perhaps set his progress backwards. At times, he wondered if he should just give up on the idea altogether.
“Er…what exactly, sir?” Harry asked, confused.
“I had an apple in the morning,” she mumbled, casting her eyes away.
he thought to himself, miserably,
Harry looked up to find a tired-looking but grinning Ron Weasley, approaching the two of them on the bench. Sophie closed her book, her freckled face breaking into a wide grin.
“It’s mainly to do with magical energy,” he began, somewhat chewing on his lower lip. Harry found himself watching the movement. “Magical energy is a deeply complex field, and it’s barely understood. I suspect it’s being studied in the Department of Mysteries, come to think of it. When we say a wand is tied to its wizard, we mean his magical energy. That’s why you’re able to cast spells with your wand, because it’s connected to your magical core.”
Draco knew he was in no position to kick back anymore, and so he took it, his stomach clenching but his face impassive, expressionless. If the war had been good for anything, it had taught him how to hide his true feelings, a useful skill he had never been able to master before. Lucius would’ve been proud.
With all that said, I'll shut up now, enjoy the chapter!
“Here,” Potter returned, dumping an armful of supplies onto the table. Draco massaged his temple with an index finger.
“The problem is I fancy her.”
“Yes, I promise.”
Malfoy got up from the kitchen table, walking over to the cabinet where Aquila’s cage sat. He rifled in one of the drawers and returned with a pot of ink, a quill, and—to Harry’s surprise—a Muggle-looking notebook.
He whirled around to find Professor McGonagall looking at him from behind her rectangular glasses, her lips pursed and her eyebrows raised.
“Ladies, we have more than we could possibly even need, please sit so we can start this delicious meal.”
He wanted to say no, to reassure her that he was fine and just get up and walk away. He was tempted to. He felt such helplessness inside him, and then anger at himself for that helplessness. Why couldn’t he just be okay? Everything was
Malfoy stared at him as if he’d grown a second head. There was a long moment of silence, as though he was trying to figure out how to reply when Harry had neglected to insult him whatsoever.
“Oh,” said Potter, and Draco’s eyes flew back up to meet his, as he suddenly realized he had been staring at Potter’s mouth.
“That’s lovely to hear. I knew that larch would be the right choice for you. It will help you pick up your confidence as well,” at this, he gave Draco a wink. “And unicorn hair, like your first wand. I remember it well—hawthorn and unicorn hair, ten inches, quite springy.”
Draco felt his spine stiffen slightly at the implication, even though it didn’t sound like an accusation, especially coming from Pansy.
He rose from his seat and bussed his tray, his appetite all but vanished. He returned to the W.A.S. office, his steps feeling heavy as his heart rate sped up.
Her voice began to tremble.
Draco had tried to pay no mind to Potter at first. He didn’t know why he and his sidekicks had even bothered to return this year, they had all received a multitude of job offers without their N.E.W.T.s.
Draco had learned from Ollivander all the additional information he had to give to Muggle parents, and he made sure he explained everything methodically. It was easy to forget how much Muggles didn’t know, despite how much better his knowledge of Muggles had become.
He chuckled slightly, and Draco felt something cold stir inside of him. Nathaniel, always so cheerful and peaceful, had shown no humour in that sound.
“Of course,” Hawk said, in an understanding tone. “If you change your mind, however, don’t hesitate to send an owl.”
He signed with the Magpies, and McGonagall sent him a letter of congratulations. Things just seemed to fall into place after that, in a way they never really had for Harry. He got along well with all of his teammates, and even though he still wasn’t fond of the fame, he was much more willing to talk to the press when they asked questions about Quidditch rather than the war or his parents. The manager for the team, a former Ravenclaw several years older than Harry, by the name of Renee Quimby, was understanding about Harry’s dislike for the press and didn’t exploit his name for more attention.
“What?” Theo demanded, sharply. “Where are the rest of them?”
Draco simply watched him, mildly enjoying his obvious discomfort. He had been the one to ask Draco to do this, to come here and play like his student, so there was no way Draco was going to make it easier for him.
At a loss for words, Draco nodded.
In the next moment however, an enormous man emerged from the trees a wheelbarrow full of slabs of meat trailing behind him.
for Pansy, for lack of a better term, especially because they had only encouraged each other.
“Draco,” said Pansy, her eyes wide. “A time loop? This is
“I want to help people. And,” he felt his heart clenching painfully at the thought of Tonks and Moody, “some of the best people I know were Aurors. They gave their lives to save others.”
Potter exclaimed.
“I know,” he sighed. “I haven’t gone flying in ages. I miss it.”
“I know,” said Malfoy. “A bit sad, isn’t it? Getting attached to a bird.”
“Are you planning on going in at some point today?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow.
On a small circular table placed in the very centre of the room was a glass vase. Inside were four flowers: a warm yellow marigold, a bright red poppy, a deep blue larkspur, and a pale green rose.
“Ginny,” Potter was saying, in a low, warning voice, but she didn’t flinch. Draco was seconds away from spitting back a biting retort, but held himself back.
“Ow, alright, alright, I’m sorry,” he placated and Summoned the owl treats from the drawer in the kitchen where he kept them, and offered one to Elpis. “Here you go. I’d wager you’re rather tired then, aren’t you?”
He ground his teeth.
He remembered the self-inflicted scars on Malfoy’s Mark, the way they shone even whiter than Malfoy’s skin, and he wondered, with horror, whether he was also scarred from Harry’s curse. He felt his stomach coil at the thought, and like that, he recognised he no longer wished Malfoy any harm.
“I’d like nothing more.”
“I don’t know. We can’t help how we’re raised, I suppose. We believe what our parents tell us. You were raised to think all Muggles were inferior to wizards in every way. My parents would have raised me the exact same way if it hadn’t been for Laurel. They were forced to face the truth, and in that, they were lucky and so was I. Just because you weren’t doesn’t mean you’re a bad person. Not if you’re willing to challenge your old views when given new information.”
“Oh. I’ve been asleep?” Harry asked, shoving his glasses on his face.
“Just different. Your posture, your demeanour. It’s like your whole body changes. You’re more confident, more sure of yourself. It’s a good look.”
“Know thine enemy, Harry,” said Hermione, meaningfully, and Harry just rolled his eyes, but as the owl flew back out the window, he unrolled the newspaper all the same and the enormous headline took him aback.
Oh. Right.
He leaned in to kiss her cheeks as they said hello, her springy curls brushing against Draco’s face as he did so.
Draco felt his blood go cold. Without thinking, his hand shot out and grabbed Theo by the wrist, to hold him back from charging at Finnigan. But Theo didn’t make a move. He simply stared at Finnigan, his expression unchanging, but from up close, Draco could see all the colour flood from his face.
“Your hair’s got dirt in it,” said Harry, reaching out to tug at a lock of it. “You may as well come join me.”
He found that this father’s face joined the Dark Lord’s in his nightmares sometimes, however, and in the beginning of the year, when the boggart had appeared in Lucius’s shape, he had to confront the truth.
Harry remembered what Hermione said about being open and honest.
“That’s great, Ginny.”
“Ella, is it?” he asked, keeping his voice quiet for fear of losing control of it. After her nod, he asked, “May I see your left arm?”
She sounded defensive, and Draco squeezed her arm in what he hoped was a comforting gesture.
His expression was somehow softer, his eyes tired, his shoulder sagging ever so slightly, despite him clearly trying to maintain his perfect posture.
“Well, there’s not exactly room for us in Gryffindor tower, is there? There’s seven years, plus us. There aren’t enough dormitories.”
“Harry!” George called from behind him. “Go out the back!”
“She’s
“What are the thoughts saying?” Ron asked, curiously.
“Malfoy’s here.”
“Why?” Ron asked.
“Oh, you’re the best,” she said, with a warm sigh. “I don’t think my brain’s even been functioning for the past half an hour.”
“Who were they?” his voice was quiet, but Draco had known Potter long enough to recognize the rage hidden in his low tone.
Draco felt his heart thundering in his ears. He didn’t know what was going on. Perhaps it was a prank; after all, he wasn’t very well-liked, there was no shortage of people who would enjoy giving him a good scare. Someone might’ve cast a spell on him, giving him some sort of hallucination. Perhaps this was all a strange dream.
Draco, dearly.
“Here,” came Potter’s voice, as he unloaded an armful of ingredients onto their table. Draco decided starting on the potion right away was the best way of keeping Potter successfully, if momentarily, distracted. He instructed Potter on what to do, keeping his own hands firmly in his lap. He was still trying to teach Potter how to properly brew their Potions, and he had realized that Potter was very much a hands-on learner. Despite his terribly slow chopping and his lack of stirring skills—both of which drove Draco’s patience up the wall—Potter was improving, and at least he seemed to be learning, which was all Draco could hope for at this point.
littlest Weasley likes women, it seems so obvious now.”
Draco nodded, slowly.
“You have done an excellent job this year and have, I believe, a firm grasp on the fundamentals of wandmaking,” the old man said, in a matter-of-fact voice. “Wandlore is a subject which you never truly stop studying, of course, but it takes several years of study to become a skilled wandmaker in one’s own right. I would very much like to continue to oversee your education in wandlore, should you be amenable.”
Not being able to discuss how it was meant to relate back to his study of wandmaking, he gave her the bare minimum, while remaining honest. This honesty thing was still quite new to him, but he was actually trying to stick to it. Violet had quoted a Muggle author at him once, something about there being so much less to keep track of if you never lied.
It was all Potter’s fault, really. Potter was the one who had gone and thrown in a whole new dimension to this strange friendship they had and had brought up old, buried feelings Draco didn’t know how to handle. He was the one who changed everything with one conversation, leaving Draco at a loss as to how to conduct himself. He had barely known how to conduct himself before this bombshell.
Daphne nodded, listening raptly.
“Could I—could I perhaps…have a moment with Professor…?” he gestured vaguely towards McGonagall’s desk, but thankfully, he saw comprehension reach her eyes.
She didn’t push him though, instead offering tea and biscuits as they sat in her living room, and leaning back in her velvet armchair, waiting for him to speak.
“Sometimes,” he nodded. “Not often, I don’t think. I mean, when I was thirteen, I accidentally blew up my aunt. And last year, sometimes my magic would just come out without me casting a spell.”
“Potions,” he said, automatically. “But Slughorn—”
“You didn’t…you didn’t take the oath, did you?”
Harry couldn’t help but feel embarrassed. The war was one thing, but the previous six years of mostly petty antics between him and Malfoy were another. He had always seen Malfoy as somewhat of a nemesis, but in comparison to everything that had happened last year, it all seemed sort of childish.
He saw that look in his mother’s eyes, growing darker and sadder as the war raged on.
He wondered how long it would take for their high off the arrests of Macnair and Rowle to wear off. By the time it did, they will have probably moved on to another heroic arrest. The Aurors had cemented their place as heroes of the Ministry during the war, and had kept that record ever since.
“Ow!” Draco exclaimed, sucking the injured finger into his mouth. “Blasted owl.”
He didn’t begrudge Meredith her little matchmaking attempts, but he had never been tempted to actually take her up on any of them. She was right, it had been a long time he had been on his own, but during that time, he hadn’t ever really wanted to go out and meet anyone.
“Is there something I can assist you with, Mr Malfoy?” she asked, expectantly.
Unfortunately, a whistle went off as Demelza called her players in for a team huddle, which meant their practice was coming to an end. Harry watched them until Demelza dismissed them and they headed off towards the locker rooms, and then slowly rose to his feet, dusting off his jeans to remove any grass that may have stuck to him. He didn’t really want to leave; it was a surprisingly warm day in January and he liked the comforting familiarity of the Quidditch pitch, even though he wasn’t flying.
“I talk too much now,” Draco grumbled, more to himself than to Potter. “This is all Violet’s fault.”
“There’s also seventh years in the class, as well as us…eighth years, I suppose,” said the Gryffindor girl. Ron looked at her as if he had just noticed she was there.
Hermione rolled her eyes.
men,” she said, picking up her wand and refilling their glasses before Levitating some Sickles over to the bar.
“It is walnut?” Draco asked. “No, no, wait, it’s far too reddish for that. Mahogany?”
“Start what?” said Harry, innocently.
“Sorry,” he said, sheepishly, offering a smile.
His train of thought was interrupted by the swift and, as always, wondrous arrival of the owls. Draco had always loved the sight of all the owls coming as they delivered the mail, their magnificent wings spread wide, with various packages and letters swinging from their talons. The sheer number of them was impressive on its own, and after years of always receiving letters and packages from home, Draco would get a warm, excited feeling in his stomach every time he saw the birds.
“Oh, come on, Draco,” said Pansy, impatiently. “You want me to believe that with Lucius in Azkaban and no one pressuring you to get married as soon as possible, you’ve just been at home by yourself this whole time?”
“How so?” Granger asked, and Draco was glad that she seemed interested. He hoped she would be able to find some answers, since the past three hours had been fruitless for him.
He didn’t hate looking at his Dark Mark as much anymore, not since Luna had added the flowers. It still made him think of the war, and of Voldemort, and of his father, and the scars reminded him of his agonizing desperation to remove it, but now it also made him think of Luna, of Armstrong and the other young Thestrals, of friendship and healing and recovery and change.
you?”
He smiled, his dark eyes twinkling.
“My money’s on the Magpies,” Harry chimed in, partially to get Ginny riled up.
“Be polite, Theo,” Cordelia said, though her expression was rather amused as well.
The dementor didn’t come.
“Have you named him?” asked Luna. Draco looked at her in confusion.
They walked back to where the others were sitting with smiles on their faces, Harry finally feeling like everything was maybe going to be alright.
“You too, Professor,” Harry gave him one last smile and left his office, feeling lighter than he had since he first entered the castle this year.
“Yes, Miss Granger,” Professor Ashworth addressed her.
“I wouldn’t expect you to understand,” Draco sniffed, and carefully set the dragonfly wings out of Potter’s reach.
“I’m Sophie Roper,” she said. “We’ve been in the same House for eight years now.”
Ginny slumped in her chair slightly.
“Potter,” he said, slowly. “Do you mean to tell me that the concept of bisexuality is foreign to you?”
He withdrew his wand and, resisting the urge to shoot a Stinging Hex at Macmillan, opened the shop with a quick spell. As soon as he was inside, he closed the door behind him, and cast the curtains closed.
Greengrass was beaming at this point and pushed Zabini, who looked rather apprehensive, forward.
“Did he really?” Theo interjected, interestedly. “But wasn’t he part of Potter’s little club during fifth year? Dumbledore’s Army, or whatever rubbish it was?”
“Alright, I’ll try and look into it.”
And Potter would go pink in the face and stumble and stutter and “oh, er, thank you, I—” until someone rescued him. Despite his annoyance at Potter’s incoherent mumbling, it did strike Draco as rather amusing that the great Harry Potter needed to be rescued from his simpering fans.
Draco felt himself swell with rage. It wasn’t enough to torture her in life; after she had died, he had found a way to torture the last essence of her that remained, beyond the grave.
“This alright with you, mate?” he asked.
“You were responsible for McGonagall’s speech, weren’t you?” Draco asked, eyes light and piercing.
So—as he always did, as he had always done, as he had been
“I smell freshly baked bread,” he said, softly. “And rain on the pavement…cashmere sweaters and chardonnay and—”
He had to remind himself
“Let me buy you a drink, then,” Draco said, swallowing his nerves down. “In honour of your brave venturing into Knockturn.”
“Ollivander? Even though you…he…”Potter trailed off, and Draco felt the ever-familiar pinch of guilt hit him in the stomach. He looked down, feeling rather ashamed.
“No matter how long you walk around the Department, that report’s not going to write itself, Potter.”
“What does it look like? You have classes with seventh years too, remember?”
“Yeah,” Harry said, unenthusiastically.
“No, you don’t,” she said.
Hermione was the only one he had ever told about that kiss, and only because she had clearly been able to tell something was on his mind. She had pulled him aside at King’s Cross, as the Weasley clan descended upon Ron, and he had muttered in whispered tones, “Draco and I kissed.”
Potter looked just as surprised to see Draco as Draco was to see him.
“Malfoy is,” Ernie argued.
Harry couldn’t quite believe it, but he was managing to brew this potion with minimal commentary from Draco. Admittedly, the Slytherin’s jaw was clenched so tightly that the bone protruded so sharply that it looked ready to break through his delicate skin, however he refrained from verbally correcting—or insulting—Harry, instead shooting him sharp glances when he got something wrong, and nodding shortly when Harry fixed the error.
“Eleanor, what’s the date?”
“Burned out?” he asked.
“Yes,” said Draco, before remembering that technically he
“Mr Potter and Mr Malfoy! Excellent. Please seat yourself with your partners if you aren’t already so that we may begin today’s potion.”
Draco’s eyes snapped back to him, and bloody hell, he was going to go for it anyway, wasn’t he? Blast the consequences and all. He felt his eyelids slowly flutter closed as he leaned forward a miniscule amount and then—
able to give Draco more information. He had been rather taken aback when Draco asked him for help in the morning, however when Draco had showed him the book, his face had split into a massive grin.
“They’re boring,” Malfoy countered.
Harry scanned the list until he saw his own name.
“Do what?”
Dean shrugged.
“I know I didn’t have to,” he said, calmly. “I wanted to. It was the truth. It was the right thing to do.”
Harry snorted. He recalled having almost the same exact thought on his twenty-first birthday, when Hermione had first explained to him what was going on.
“Granger, I am begging you,” said Draco. “Please tell me what’s going on.”
“Hogwarts? You want me to go back to Hogwarts? After all the—after we—after the
“I’ve been a little busy, you know.”
“I understand that you are the mighty Saviour of the Wizarding World and can do no wrong, and unlike us mere mortals, do not need to worry yourself with inconsequential activities such as actually brewing potions or making any effort whatsoever, however you could at least have the
But every so often, Draco would hit a wall, something untouchable that made Potter close up at once. He’d learned that talking about Potter’s childhood before Hogwarts was off-limits. Even the casual mention of the Muggles who raised him was enough to end the conversation.
Potter shrugged.
Pansy raised an eyebrow, a smirk playing at her lips.
“That’s Pansy,” she said.
The next few people’s boggarts were a bit more standard—Hannah’s was a dragon, Padma’s was a cobra, Hermione’s was her parents, looking at her unrecognizably—and Harry’s mind was spinning, unable to figure out what his own boggart meant.
“Oh,” said Potter, frowning. “Sure, one second.”
After he and Dean parted ways, Draco Apparated home to rest for a bit before he was due at the Manor. He had promised his mother he would go there for dinner tonight, though he wasn’t feeling entirely up to it. He thought he’d much rather wait for Elpis at home and just be lazy on the sofa, but he knew better than to go back on his word with Narcissa. If he tried to say he wasn’t feeling well, she’d be at his house in minutes and have Polkey prepare him a soup.
and Draco felt that like a weight on his chest.
He lifted the cloth and leaned forward to look at Harry’s wing, his blond hair falling into his face. Harry took a moment to marvel at how different he looked with his hair loose and free instead of slicked back the way he had always worn it in school.
“But you do,” said Draco, in a matter-of-fact tone.
“He’s a sick fuck, Malfoy.”
“What are you doing here?” Harry asked, unable to help himself.
Harry felt his stomach sink more and more with every word Ashworth said. He didn’t have anything against the idea exactly, but his standing in school was nothing like it had been in fifth year. In fact, it was completely the opposite now. Instead of being the crazy outcast, he was now the Boy-Who-Lived-Twice, bloody Saviour of the Wizarding World, as much as he hated it. How was he supposed to find someone who actually needed tutoring and was able to take him seriously as a teacher, instead of seeing him as
“Me?”
Neville grimaced and raised his glass slightly in a mock-toast.
Draco looked over at Dennis.
him and Malfoy. Gryffindor and Slytherin students simply hated each other on principle. Didn’t they?
“You said…” Potter said, slowly. “You’re friends with Muggles now?”
Theo took the point with a small smile of his own.
One such occasion had had Draco foolishly thinking that perhaps things would change between them. Potter had appeared at his door, shaking from head to toe.
friendly! He’s the opposite of friendly! He’s
“May as well get it over with,” he said glumly, and got to his feet.
“I think Draco would agree with you on that, to be honest.”
Today, however, he didn’t even go into work.
“Well, yes, but you didn’t mean to,” Draco paused for a moment and then added, “Did you?”
“Defence. She had a terrible boggart at the beginning of the year. She fought in the Battle of Hogwarts. On your side,” Draco offered, numbly.
“I don’t suppose you actually
Granger’s success in school had always infuriated Draco, especially since his father never let him forget how a Muggleborn had bested him in every subject, but now, he simply couldn’t find any anger left in him for her.
“Damn,” Potter said, letting out a sigh. He turned his head to look at Draco. Trying not to tremble, Draco met his eyes.
Malfoy seemed to genuinely be waiting for an answer, so Harry hopped over to the Y and looked back up at him.
“Alright, alright,” Harry agreed. “Maybe I’ll ask Slughorn if I can make an announcement in class or something.”
“Gryffindor and Slytherin have the biggest House rivalry in the school,” Harry said, even though he knew that was a gross oversimplification of his relationship with Malfoy.
“Probably not,” Harry admitted.
Granger listened intently, her eyes growing wide and nearly bouncing out of her seat by the time Draco had finished.
Hermione looked up.
“Right,” said Draco, his heart aching. Here was the reminder of something he couldn’t have. A proper friendship with Potter meant memories with him, memories that they both had, not just Draco.
“I—well, yeah, we wanted her to let us past.”
Ginny just gave him a look.
“According to Greek mythology, when Ajax was not gifted Achilles’ armour, which was meant to symbolize the title of the bravest warrior, he threw himself upon his own sword, and the small blue larkspurs grew out of the places of his blood drops,” Draco paused again here, unsure if he wanted to voice his thoughts. But Potter was looking up at him, waiting, and, well, he was already this far in.
“That’s not really what I wanted to talk about, Harry.”
Draco rolled his eyes.
“Have a seat, Mr Malfoy,” she said, gesturing to the spindly purple chairs that sat in front of the desk, and moving to sit behind it. Draco sat and looked up at her, intending to get right to the point, but finding himself frozen.
“None at all, sir,” Draco said, unable to keep a hint of pride out of his voice. Ollivander awarded him with a warm smile.
Oliver was really not at all similar to Ron, but Harry could still understand why Hermione would be interested in him, as he was clearly on her intellectual level and the two seemed to be able to talk for hours.
There had been two of them, both in the 20
“Are you certain?” he asked. “You seem rather occupied.”
what he wanted to say.
“He stayed at Hogwarts,” replied Harry. He himself had been surprised at that when Draco had told him. “Apparently Narcissa is trying to purge the Manor of Dark Magic.”
“I suppose. She’s quite interesting, you know. She fought back against the Carrows last year, even though she wasn’t invited to be in the DA.”
“They
Before he could change his mind, Draco stepped forward and reached out a hand, gently stroking the silky mane of a nearby young male. It let out a low breath and pushed its head further into Draco’s palm.
He squeezed his eyes shut tightly, suddenly overwhelmed and feeling something heavy in his throat. He reached blindly for the next letter and blinked several times before regarding the envelope. The Malfoy seal was unmistakable, and his mother’s perfect handwriting even more so.
“Yes, Harry, a garden.”
Malfoy gave him a dirty look.
She had a soft look on her face and Draco almost envied her for a moment, wondering what it was like to love someone so much.
“If you can’t tell me about what you’re learning, then what about your plans for after school? Will you open your own—Demelza’s open, Ginny!—your own wand shop?”
“You’re too curious for your ow good,” Draco huffed, and began stirring the potion, which, as Harry saw as he glanced over, had turned a deep orange colour. Harry watched him stir, and spoke, barely realizing what he was saying as the words tumbled out of his mouth.
Harry felt a rush of heat run through him. He gritted his teeth, feeling betrayed by himself. Draco was just doing his job, being
“Draco.”
They had been kissing for what felt like hours now. They had gone from the doorway to the sofa and finally into Draco’s bed, and at some point during all of that kissing, Potter had become Harry. The first time Draco had gasped his name was entirely by accident, as Harry had kissed down his neck and gently sucked on a sensitive spot, and Draco had felt all blood leave his brain.
“I can take care of that for you, Malfoy,” she’d say, eyes innocent and voice saccharine-sweet.
“If you were capable of actually doing the work, I’d say yes, but seeing as your potion-making skills are worse than those of a first year, I think I’ll handle our potions by myself.”
“Any volunteers to go first?” Waya asked, his eyebrow raised and a smirk playing at his lips. There was a lengthy silence, then interrupted by a sigh from Ron.
“Come off it, now. I wasn’t the only one there, you know.”
Ashworth had decided to wrap up their apprenticeship early, telling Harry to focus on his N.E.W.T.s and complete his application to Keswary, the day school he had suggested.
But then when he did, he was slouching too much and didn’t look natural. It was too much to keep track of, looking casual but keeping the back straight and core tight, and trying not to look frustrated and focused.
“Can’t blame him, they don’t get many snakes down in the Portkey Office.”
“The third-floor corridor on the right-hand side,” he said, more as a statement than a question, but Ashworth nodded at him nonetheless.
“Why didn’t you go with them?”
“That’s…wow. I didn’t even know that was possible, studying wandlore,” Potter said, looking wondrous, and after a glance, Draco decided it was safe to look up again.
He met his eyes again and smiled.
So Draco just wouldn’t respond, setting about his work instead.  Still, it raked at his nerves endlessly—Finchley’s entitled rudeness. He was always tempted to retort, biting it back each time. He supposed it was karma, for what he had been like as a child, boastful and callous. Oh, how the mighty have fallen, and all that tosh. People always enjoyed kicking those who had once kicked them.
“What?” Daphne exclaimed.
“As opposed to leaving them to die?” Harry looked at her, incredulously.
“What do you know about the Oath? About the magic behind it? About its conditions?”
“That would be brilliant.”
The store would not be open to customers today.
“You’re just so…Potter-ish,” he complained, and to his delight, Potter let out a real laugh.
Harry realized he was tired of it. Hermione had been right, he just didn’t have the energy in him to hate Malfoy anymore. Moreover, he didn’t have the
Potter smiled, but it didn’t last long.
“You weren’t,” Potter interrupted.
“Oi,” said Jones, narrowing her eyes at Potter. “Don’t you think just because the entire Ministry’s ready to kiss your arse, you can boss us around. We outnumber you.”
“Are you so starved for affection you feel the need to live through my exploits?” Draco asked, looking down at his suddenly-full glass of wine.
“Alright,” said Potter, lighting a
“Yeah, I suppose. I slept through the night though, and even had a kip in the afternoon.”
“Gamp’s Law is so
Yes, it was just so incredibly lucky that he was to spend another year at Hogwarts with Harry bloody Potter.
Nathaniel’s face had softened, and he had reached out a calloused hand to cup Draco’s face. Despite how rough it was, despite how cold and wet and covered in grime, Draco had leaned into the touch.
He felt like he was lying to them. Like he was presenting himself in sheep’s clothing, an innocent boy who just got caught up in a bad situation. He wasn’t a prisoner in that house, not really, no matter how much he had felt like he was. He still got to lie down in a warm bed at night, even if he didn’t actually sleep when in it. He had done horrific things throughout the war. Before the war.
“Thank you,” he finally said. “She’s been suffering for a long time. I don’t think she would have given up the names if you hadn’t been there.”
Hermione looked astounded.
“Theo,” he breathed, as the boy next to him gave a slight smile.
“You sound like you’re speaking from experience,” he said, slowly.
“Alright, class,” Waya faced the class again. “Let’s move on to Shield Charms.”
fault.
Hermione seemed to think so too.
Instead, wondering why it had taken him so long, he went to Pansy’s house.
He was rather glad with his decision, as well. While he dearly missed playing Quidditch, the new Seeker—a fourth year boy named Euan Abercrombie—flew rather well. He was small and quick. The exact right build for a Seeker, and Harry was strongly reminded of his own first time playing Quidditch.
“Just lemon, please. And some sugar,” said Harry.
“You can consider this a courtesy visit, Jamison,” said Granger. “I’m here to offer you the opportunity to release Draco Malfoy from the
“Don’t worry, you don’t have to explain.”
Harry felt a collective sigh being released by the others in the room.
Hermione continued talking about what Ashworth could possibly introduce them to throughout the year as they made their way to the dungeons. By the time they entered the Potions classroom, Ron looked moderately displeased.
Potter was taking big, loud breaths now, and they were coming out far too quickly and heavily.
Theo paused again, and his expression softened.
He paused, his quill pressed to the notebook.
Draco waited, wanted the moment to stretch out as long as possible, until Potter looked like he was seriously straining to keep from moving.
obsessing over Potter. It was an old habit—and a dangerous one at that, one he could so easily fall into.
“Maybe we should let the owl in first.”
Nathaniel nodded slowly, and Draco knew in that moment, he had lost him.
“Frying bacon,” were the first words out of Weasley’s mouth.
Draco stared at her for a mere moment, before saying, whilst praying his voice didn’t crack from the emotion that tumbled out of him, “I love you too, Violet.”
“Exactly,” he murmured. “Do you ever just hold onto your wand in your robes as if you’re about to be attacked?”
Draco nodded slowly.
But more often than not, he felt…alright. Content. At times, even, at peace, something he had little experience with throughout his life. He and Ron had both joined the Aurors and were excited to start their training.
“You can call me Harry,” Potter said, still in that calm, kind tone. “I know it’s probably hard to talk about, but it’s important for us to know what happened, okay?”
“I’m…sorry?” said Harry.
” Draco crossed his arms. “Make it a challenge at least.”
“Think about it, my boy,” he said. “Remember what I told you on the very first day.
“Oh, er…yes, Mr Potter,” she said, looking thoroughly embarrassed.
“And you Brits are so stiff,” Waya countered with a raised eyebrows, before turning to Harry. “I was thinking for the rest of this session, we could focus on something a little different.”
Harry felt a sudden wave of guilt wash over him. He remembered, in the Battle, Lavender had been attacked by Greyback. He remembered Trelawney and Parvati leaning over her in the Great Hall.
“What would you do if there were no consequences?” he finally asked.
Thanks to his and Waya’s extended sessions, Harry had gotten rather good at wandless, nonverbal spells, and every time he mastered another one, he felt himself bursting with pride.
Harry grinned.
“After you,” Draco said, gesturing towards the newly revealed hole in the wall. Ron gave him a highly suspicious look, but followed the girls as they entered the Common Room. Harry hung back for a moment, looking at Draco.
“Would you like to join me to visit the Thestrals sometime, Draco?”
“I know,” said Malfoy, wincing at if it was hurting him too. “You’re being very brave. I’m amazed you haven’t gone into shock.”
The Slytherins had arrived. The loud noise appeared to be coming from a wizard radio, which Greengrass, who was leading the group, was holding in her left hand. As they descended the stairs, Harry recognized it as a Weird Sisters song.
Armstrong immediately lifted his head from Draco’s lap and opened his eyes wide. Startled, Draco looked at him, unsurely, and rose to his feet.
“Or what?” he asked.
Draco did just that.
Draco had squeezed his eyes closed, unable to respond.
“She’s teaching you about Muggles?” he said it with such disbelief that Draco was unsure whether to be offended or not. Then he remembered the countless times he had called Granger a ‘Mudblood’ and decided he didn’t have the right.
He tried to think about something else. Tried to focus on his schoolwork, at much urging from Hermione. But it was hard, hard to convince himself that his marks in Herbology still mattered after everything they had been through the last year.
Harry whipped around to find Draco leaning in the doorframe, his eyes looking down as he slowly unlatched his gloves.
“Ella didn’t want to give me any names.”
of memories in that house—maybe not all good, but all relatively
Draco felt himself bristle at this. Yes, he was learning a lot about Muggles, and yes, he was trying to be more open-minded this year, however he had been raised on pureblood traditions and some of the rituals were beautiful and full of complex, intricate magic, and Potter didn’t know a thing about them.
“You were nice to her,” he said.
“You can’t seriously be this upset with me,” Potter exclaimed, his eyebrows scrunched together and his eyes looking bright and beseeching. Draco felt an ache pinch his heart, like a soft crack in a glass window.
Draco took another deep, steadying breath, trying to ignore how it shook inside of him.
“Does he keep you here on purpose?” Potter asked.
But it hadn’t been a solitary incident. Lucius seemed to find some sort of power in it, in having someone under his control like that, and since all the other Death Eaters had lost respect for him, the only person that could be was Draco.
He let out a heavy sigh, taking off his glasses and rubbing at his eyes. He needed to get a hold of himself. If the man was going to such length to avoid Harry getting a glimpse of his thoughts, then clearly he didn’t want to have anything to do with him, and Harry was just going to have to accept that.
There were several owls waiting on his window sill when Draco entered his workshop and Elpis was sitting on the inside, looking distinctly ruffled and staring at the other owls.
“Just curious,” Harry replied, though there was more to it than that. He didn’t know how to properly address what he was really wondering, he hadn’t even figured out how to phrase it in his own mind.
Potter nodded, and Draco couldn’t help but feel his mood slightly brighten. There was something about holding Potter’s attention that was very powerful. Draco tried to tell himself it was because Potter was a dolt who couldn’t keep his focus on anything for more than a few seconds, but he knew that wasn’t the truth.
Harry leaned over the potion and saw that, indeed, it had begun to bubble and froth where the liquid met the cauldron.
” Hermione interjected. “I’ll try and think of someone for you, but keep an open mind, alright? Don’t just shoot everyone down.”
“What’s the catch?” Harry asked. Renee had a habit of neglecting to mention any negative aspects when she was pitching something.
After closing up the shop, Draco cast a quick cleaning charm to rid the room of dust and then walked up the spindly spiral staircase into his workshop.
But that didn’t explain the perverse sort of pleasure Lucius seemed to get from seeing him in pain, the way his lip would curl into something of a smile when Draco panted and whimpered after the curse was removed. His face almost resembled Bellatrix’s in its triumph and it was that face that invaded Draco’s nightmares.
“I just don’t want Ravenclaw to win the Cup!” Potter exclaimed once again, but Draco continued shaking his head and looking scandalized.
“If you want to lose your first game with a brand new set,” Draco said, grinning. Theo laughed.
Draco allowed himself a soft chuckle.
“I am so sorry,” he exclaimed.
Draco sighed. He wasn’t pleased about this. Not at all. But earlier, he’d thought he might be the only Slytherin to be back at all, and it turned out he had Theo and Blaise and he thought that
“Surprising,” Draco nodded. “Well, I wouldn’t say friends exactly. I’ve been going out into Muggle London more often recently. It’s nice sometimes, to get a break, to go somewhere that nobody knows who I am.”
Harry’s eyes widened. He couldn’t imagine life at Hogwarts without the cushiony armchairs in the Gryffindor common room, the warmth of the fire pleasant and comforting.
He sat with his head ducked down as far as it would go without severely hunching over. His pale blond hair made him all the more noticeable, and for once, Draco desperately wanted not to be noticed. He was not altogether successful, he realized, as he felt a figure slide in to sit next to him. He dared a glance upwards and was both surprised and relieved to see a familiar face.
Theo gave a little shrug with one shoulder.
He shook his head.
“Is it Dreamless Sleep?” Harry asked, suspiciously.
“Have you been going to the Quidditch games?”
“It’s not hard for you, is it?” he asked her, nodding his head very slightly towards Ron and Sophie, whose argument had gotten even louder.
He grinned at her and waved, before turning back to the path up to Hogwarts. He really did have to start on that Defence essay.
Draco looked over to the windowseat, where the few remaining Slytherins had taken to hiding, and saw Violet Foxblade sitting there, cross-legged, with an open book resting on her legs. Thinking of their last Defence lesson, he walked over to join her.
say a kind word before.
Harry sighed.
“Black pudding is
Draco blinked at him.
“Well, what can we do about it?” asked Potter.
Harry awoke to find Ron and Hermione’s blurry faces peering over him in his bed. He instantly scrambled to sit up and reached around blindly for his glasses. Once he had shoved them onto his face, he exclaimed, “What?”
“Yes,” Harry confirmed.
“You and I have been friends since we were in nappies, Pansy.”
He held out a hand.
Draco could picture it: a whole gang of red-headed Weasleys gathered around a too-small table, tossing presents at each other and laughing. He immediately felt the urge to make fun of them, to insult, to lash out. But it was accompanied by a stab of jealousy. They would all be together, and he would remain at Hogwarts, alone.
Harry felt himself blushing at her praise, and he couldn’t help but grin. Still, he looked towards Ron, rather nervously.
“I’ll be fine,” he said. “Just a hard day.”
In the end, it didn’t matter what he said, because Hermione would convince them to go anyway.
When he finally dared to meet Potter’s eyes, he looked utterly appalled, and Draco immediately bit hard on his tongue, regretting opening his mouth, regretting saying anything, regretting agreeing to these stupid meetings and helping Potter with Potions, regretting stepping foot on the Hogwarts Express in the first place…
He didn’t know what to do, what to say. He wasn’t particularly good at dealing with tears, he didn’t even know what to do when he himself was crying, let alone someone else.
“He went to Hogsmeade with Sophie for a drink,” Hermione supplied.
Harry waited as she gathered up her work, beginning to arrange it into a variety of folders.
So he simply nodded.
, and Hermione seemed to be the best at communicating with him out of the lot of them.
He shoved the hand back in Harry’s hand and Harry, not knowing what was going on, obediently cast, “
Draco’s eyes widened.
“Yeah,” Draco nodded. It was odd, for him to talk to Potter for this long without a snarky remark, but there was nothing typical about this situation.
Pansy waggled her eyebrows.
“Well, well, well, a Gryffindor not entirely consumed with his own House only?”
Potter looked at him, for the first time completely withdrawing his attention from the match.
“Let’s just all go to bed, everyone,” said Granger, already back to her characteristically bossy tone of voice, with a hint of forced cheerfulness.
“Ready to dig in?” Granger asked, and Draco looked at the tall stack of books in front of them.
conceivable. Barely.
Draco hated himself a bit, hated how he went to that blasted event where everybody hated him just so he could see Potter afterwards. Hated how he knew Potter would leave as soon as they were done and he still let him in, still wanted him here. He hated how he knew, he
“Why?”
Despite the fact that Harry and Ginny’s romance had fizzled out before it ever even got off the ground, Molly made it clear that Harry was still a part of the family and welcome at every Weasley dinner. Hermione was also always invited, though her job also caused her to be absent sometimes.
Harry was touched.
“You said,” Draco swallowed, suddenly nervous again. “Before you went to get the files. You said you didn’t know I…”
Granger’s bushy eyebrows shot upwards in surprise.
Harry stripped in the dressing room, quickly pulling his jeans and t-shirt back on, feeling a bit safer in the comfort of his Muggle clothes. He breathed in heavily, trying to calm the shakiness emanating throughout his whole body.
“Right!” said Slughorn, making himself comfortable in the chair behind his professor’s desk. “Welcome to Potions! First thing’s first. We’re going to be concocting some complex and often dangerous potions this year, so I trust everyone will pay the utmost attention to my instructions.”
Draco nodded, and followed Potter as they carefully made their way around the back of the house.
Harry was focused on something else.
that she was Muggleborn, but he’d have maybe felt a bit better if she could admit that she wasn’t in fact an authority on all things magical.
stared back at him.
“Oh, hello,” he said to the owl, who had a long, slim box and a rolled up note tied to his talons. “Are you here for me?”
“Let me look into the Oath,” he finally said, trying to sound as unruffled as he could.
“No kisses for me, thanks,” Harry joked and Ron rolled his eyes and grabbed him in a quick hug.
He had stumbled near the end there, realising how much it had started to sound like a
“Potter, I—” Draco started, but Potter seemed to have made up his mind. He turned back to the portrait and spoke in a clear voice.
“She slept with—
that night. But it didn’t. Life went on. And I think we realized that our feelings for each other were never going to be as strong as they were on that one night.”
“Chang,” Draco sighed in relief, taking the woman’s offered hand and climbing out of the hole. He turned back to help Potter, but Potter didn’t take his hand, instead pulling himself out alone.
“I don’t know why it is,” he said. “But you don’t love me.”
“Do they have any secret meanings?”
Finally, Draco gave a stiff nod and sat again, Harry quickly following suit. They say in silence for a moment, Harry’s heart racing and his hands fidgeting.
The flames vanished, and the hat seemed to rise from the floor for a moment, until a little bunny appeared underneath it, chirping and trying to get free from the hat. Warm laughter filled the room and Harry felt the knot in his chest loosen slightly.
Potter’s eyebrows furrowed and he immediately broke his promise of staying silent.
Alarmed, Harry looked to Hermione.
to him for two days, being open and honest in a way that Harry had never seen him before.
“Why am I here?”
She snorted.
Malfoy’s face had gone a deep pink and he immediately looked down at the potion again. This didn’t seem like Malfoy, who normally preened at any praise directed his way. Harry looked at him, somewhat confused. Surely Malfoy enjoyed the attention—he always had. Why was he acting like he didn’t want to meet anyone’s eyes?
Pansy went silent, taking an occasional sip of tea as she thought.
“A historic Gryffindor Seeker,” piped up Dean from Harry’s right.
Harry raised his eyebrows at her.
He felt himself go cold thinking about it, especially after Lucius’s betrayal. How foolish he had been to continue to trust this man. He may have been his father, but he had been showing Draco what kind of man he was for years, and Draco had been too blind with admiration and love to see it.
“They’re going to put you in some of our standard Quidditch gear for the first set, some shin guards, gloves, the works. They probably won’t do much with your hair, you’re practically famous for it now.”
He could already feel himself slowing down as he walked up from the Apparition point near Charmed Chocolates, his gut clenching and unclenching with anxiety over what he would say. He had barely slept last night, countless possibilities for how everything could go wrong flashing in his mind. Draco could hex him. Or throw him out of the shop. Or pick a fight. Or ignore him completely.
but honestly, what is the point in following me around like this? Do you want me to leave?”
“I didn’t mean—you don’t even remember—”
There were times when they’d be talking, and Harry felt more at ease than he did with anyone else, even Ron and Hermione, like he could say anything he felt or thought, without worrying about being judged or belittled, without feeling like he would cause concerns for his wellbeing.
“Have you never had one?”
this before.”
“Honestly, Harry, I’m a bit worried,” she said.
It was hours later when Violet let out a loud yawn and closed her own books.
“You do that, Potter,” Draco smirked, and sat back as Harry hurried to the supply closet. The pygmy blossom seeds took a moment to find, as they were in an extraordinarily small jar, however Harry retrieved them and turned to walk back to their desk, where now, Theodore Nott, chatting with Draco.
for someone who normally looked utterly confident and sure of herself, and this was enough to give Draco pause.
someone
But deep down, he knew that wasn’t really what they referred to. It wasn’t before the war. It was before he changed. Before his final year at Hogwarts, where everything he had gone through during the war started to tumble out of him and demand to be addressed. Before Violet, before Ollivander, before Luna, before wandmaking and before he had learned to be a real friend and before his Patronus.
“I think I’m having a
“I know,” Potter said. He would, seeing as his Invisibility Cloak was one of those ways. Potter began to venture further into the house, and Draco followed, feeling the sweat on his palm as he gripped harder onto his wand.
She smiled back.
“I told you to get one this summer, when I got mine,” Hermione said, in a chastising tone.
“I know, they aren’t my favourite either. Let’s get this over with then, shall we?” he said, and with a flick of two of his fingers, the door to a broom closet over on the right opened and a desk came barrelling into the classroom.
Harry didn’t know how Hermione felt about Waya’s casual nature, but he himself was starting to like him. He reminded him, Harry realized with a pang in his heart, of Remus.
Harry looked at him, curiously. This was their fourth session, and Harry was simply glad that there hadn’t been any arguments between them, or insults thrown. Malfoy had gotten impatient last session when he couldn’t master a spell quite as quickly as he wanted, and he had said that maybe Harry would have made a better Auror after all, but that was incredibly tame for him, and Harry had just laughed. But they also hadn’t talked about anything other than the spellwork, and Harry wasn’t sure if doing so was the best idea. After all, it wasn’t like they had ever held a civil conversation before.
advanced, but you would definitely need contextual information to understand it. Physics is a broad field, it studies how the universe behaves and what everything is made up of. I’m not sure if any wizards have thought to combine physics with a magical understanding of the world, though that would make for some fascinating theories,” she trailed off, seemingly distracted by her tangent for a moment. Draco let her wonder without interruption, only softly clearing his throat after a long pause.
“Come here,” he said, beckoning Draco forward with his hands.
“Wait a minute,” said Malfoy. “Can you understand me?”
To his surprise, Draco laughed—a light, airy sound that felt like a chill going up Harry’s arms. Draco himself looked a bit surprised at his reaction. He sobered quickly, his face becoming serious again.
Aware of Hagrid’s eyes still trailing him, Draco withdrew his wand and departed the clearing.
Sorry this is a few days late; I totally forgot to post it! My bad. Hope you enjoy!
It made it slightly awkward, then, when Harry sat across from her at dinner and tried to bring up the subject of Draco without actually mentioning his name.
“Kind of what?”
It had just been a long time since anyone had really looked at him, that’s all it was.
“Wait, you can do that?” Harry interjected. Ginny looked at him and her expression suddenly softened.
“Strange,” said Draco, his eyes focused on his now-empty teacup. “She’s almost exactly like I remember. We used to be quite close.”
“What, with you?” he asked.
His discovery about the strange dual-ownership over the hawthorn wand between him and Potter had astounded and impressed Ollivander, and the senior wandmaker had taken the wand in order to further study it. Draco was eager—and somewhat impatient—to hear what the wand revealed. Meanwhile, however, Ollivander continued to instruct him in the intricate art of wandlore and wandmaking.
something for the man, something more than just goodwill for a stranger. He hadn’t said anything to Ron or Hermione, the prospect seemed ridiculous, being that he didn’t even know whose thoughts he was hearing, but he had begun to almost look forward to those ten to fifteen minutes a day where he had a window into the other man’s mind.
“I think I understand the idea of different types of energy,” he said, slowly. “It’s sort of like…Transfiguration, perhaps? It’s systematic and precise, you have to consider all factors of the object and its structure in order to adequately Transfigure it into another object. So that’s like a transformation of energy, no? I suppose Conjuration and Vanishment wouldn’t work with that law of energy or whatever it was called.”
“What?” insisted Ron.
“I’m a professional,” said Parvati, dramatically batting her eyelashes.
“Oof!” cried Harry, as Draco landed on him, immediately peppering him with kisses. “Good morning to you too.”
“Wait,” said Potter, redundantly.
Draco chose to look back at the flowers, but his meditative state had been interrupted. He was now too aware of the crease in his brow, how pursed his lips were, the taste of blood inside his mouth as he chewed on the inside of his cheek. His expression of frustration must have been quite obvious, because Potter decided to comment on it.
He let the owl back out, quickly closing the window after it. The cold was going on for far too long, it was about time it started getting warmer again. Draco shivered and grabbed the Prophet on his way to the bathroom. Unrolling it as he started to wash up, he saw the large headline,
“Yeah, I’ll stop.”
chapter title is from the song Holy by PVRIS
which was partially why Draco continued to refer to them as Slytherin reunions.
“Did you enjoy it?”
The door swung open to reveal Potter’s face, looking utterly exhausted. He had dark circles under his eyes and he was wearing a Muggle t-shirt and boxers.
“I dunno, I thought you would.”
“There was someone,” Draco admitted, ignoring Pansy’s smug grin and instead taking a long sip of wine, letting it sit in the back of his throat until it hurt. “Two years ago, when I was still Ollivander’s apprentice. Nathaniel.”
“He’s still no prince, you know,” she said, with a joking tone in her voice.
To his surprise, Granger smiled again.
Draco, who had been confident in his analysis of his new wand, suddenly felt nervous under the silver gaze of his mentor.
But he didn’t think he did. He liked being his friend. He liked that he could now talk about the true nature of his apprenticeship with him, that conversation rarely turned to the war, that Theo was smart and well-read and could easily keep up with Draco.
“What about the other ones?” he asked in a quiet voice.
“Because I’m a Slytherin. They’re angry about the war,” she said this in a monotone, as if reading from a textbook, and it was this tone, more than anything else, that lit the fire in Draco’s belly.
Dobbs dodges, and Armstrong is taken out by his own team! And Dobbs has got the Snitch! Slytherin wins!”
Malfoy’s tone was hardening, seeming to morph back into how he used to talk to Harry, and Harry suddenly realised his silence can’t have been very encouraging. He forced his jaw to open.
The nightmares sometimes felt like they were Voldemort himself, haunting Harry from beyond his grave. He knew that was silly, the voice in his head that always sounded like Hermione reminded him that Voldemort couldn’t come back as a ghost even if he wanted to, since he had split his soul so many times, but that didn’t stop those intrusive thoughts from entering his head.
“Nah,” Ron said, returning to his food. “She’s on her emergency rotation now, so it’s more often, but they’re putting her on poisons and antidote training next month.”
Potter stared at him, eyes wide.
Blaise looked shocked for a moment, but valiantly saved face.
Malfoy raised a pale eyebrow at him.
“Harder to get their players to earn team loyalty that way,” Malfoy argued. “The Falcons have never had a player leave their team for another and the only player they ever pinched off another team was Tabitha Hawk, who played for the Wimbourne Wasps for a year before the Falcons got her.”
Why on earth would he be?
I have returned with another chapter! Thank you for your comments as always! It looks like most of you prefer the longer chapters so I'll try and feature more of those instead of the short ones! To be honest, Draco's chapters are pretty much always longer, Harry's often give me a lot of trouble!
“Potter,” Draco interrupted. “You were a child. It was bad. What happened?”
As soon as Slughorn announced the name of the potion they were brewing, Draco’s heart sank. The old professor spoke with such excitement and vigour, but all Draco could think about was how much time it was going to take from him.
“Yeah, tell that to Finchley. According to him, once a Death Eater, always a Death Eater.”
“I wanted to study for Potions,” he finally said, and Draco stared at him, incredulously. Yes, Potter had their Potions textbook on the table, but it wasn’t even open.
Simone Wexler, the youngest member of England’s National Quidditch Team and the star of the entire Quidditch world, a firecracker and fellow former Gryffindor a year below Harry’s, had barrelled into his life like a particularly violent Bludger.
“What? But…how?”
“I agree, Potter,” Draco said. “And he’s been trying to relive it with these women. But it will never be enough for him, because none of them are his sister.”
Potter was staring at him, eyes wide and mouth slightly agape. Draco let out a heavy breath; he was practically shaking with how angry he was.
Fruitlessly, he tried to flap his wings.
“Now why are you messing up my letter?”
Draco didn’t know what to say. He wasn’t particularly used to people
“Foul!” Ron bellowed, almost louder than the commentary, which was being done by Dennis Creevey. He motioned to Madam Hooch, who didn’t do anything, because it hadn’t really been a foul, and Harry just grinned at his friend.
possible that he and Potter had gotten somewhat emotionally invested in the case and allowed that to cloud their professional judgment. Slightly.
Potter blinked at him.
So he brought it to Ginny.
“From what I hear, you and Draco have been rivals since your first year.”
On another day, feeling particularly brave, he waited until after sunset and ventured into a club. It was still Tuesday, so it wasn’t completely full, but it was relatively crowded, and Draco felt nervous walking in. Unsure of what to order at the bar, he requested whatever they had on tap, despite not being much of a beer drinker.
“Oh. Right,” nodded Harry. As Draco stood, shaking out his robes, and Harry felt his heart rate picking up again at his nervousness, he managed to get out a, “Could we meet up again?”
Harry scowled at him.
The tension sufficiently relieved, Draco felt his shoulders relax and he speared a chunk of fruit with his fork.
“I—all of this, I suppose. The idea of me
Curiously, Harry continued scanning the board. He saw some familiar names in the column of mentors, namely Tiberius Ogden—who had been in the Wizengamot—and Gwenog Jones, former captain of the Holyhead Harpies. Dean Thomas and Alice Runcorn were the names in her row, and Harry was definitely going to ask Dean more about that later.
“To be honest, I don’t think he really wanted me to learn it.”
“I thought you didn’t call for backup,” he said to Potter.
Draco felt another wave of guilt wash over him at the mention of Ollivander. He knew that Ollivander would certainly not be the one to mentor him, not after the ordeal he had suffered in the Manor’s dungeons. Draco just hoped that McGonagall would be able to find another good wandmaker that would be willing to teach him.
“Yes, Potter, you’ve been in school with her for eight years now,” he neglected to mention how even he had barely known Violet before this year.
“Oh, that’s cool,” Potter replied, glancing up at Draco for a moment and then quickly turning away again. He was behaving strangely all of a sudden, not making eye contact but shiftily shooting Draco odd glances.
Harry thought about the Quidditch recruiters from yesterday, and couldn’t help smiling.
“Fine,” he said. “But you’re still a prat. This doesn’t mean we’re mates now, Potter.”
“For what? Calling you dramatic?”
Nathaniel shook his head.
Ollivander had said, with a dismissive wave of his hand.
Harry felt a sense of dread filling him, like he had been jolted from a great height and his stomach was now sinking like a stone.
He was still by no means fond of the newspaper, and he was always careful, but he didn’t do anything these days worth reporting on anyway, so he didn’t feel as hunted as he once had.
“Will you just let me in?” Draco huffed. “I’ll explain.”
“You don’t owe me anything in return.”
He was so focused on shoving that name back into the deep abscesses of his mind that he hadn’t thought to school his features into a neutral expression.
the war and, since Nott was a Slytherin, Harry had just assumed?
“You want to read the paper?” Harry said, smirking.
“I cannot do this,” Harry mumbled under his breath, his heart rate picking up with every step he took towards the Velvet Tearoom. He felt exceedingly nervous and unsure of himself. He had taken nearly an hour to dress, when it typically only took him ten minutes, and he had gone through practically every set of robes he owned until he decided to throw caution to the wind and go Muggle instead.
“I know,” Potter said softly. “I know that now.”
Draco was always careful walking around hallways—he had to be. There was often a Stinging Hex or Trip Jinx waiting for him around the corner. It hadn’t been unexpected, even when he first arrived. Maybe especially when he first arrived. He had been a Death Eater, of course there would be people seeking revenge. He knew Daphne and Theo had also encountered a few hexes here and there, from people who mistakenly thought their families had been Death Eater sympathizers, but nowhere near the level of Draco.
“The reason many potionmakers stay away from seeds is because of their tendency to mix poorly with certain ingredients, however this potion does not include any elements of an animal, blood or horn or hair, so the seeds have nothing to react dangerously with.”
“And for you?” asked Ella, looking at Harry again.
“But after the first Great Muggle War, poppies became symbolic of remembrance. Red ones specifically became intrinsically linked to death and the memories of soldiers who died in the war,” he trailed off rather pathetically, realizing that
“No, it’s just—”
Malfoy—Draco—eyed it suspiciously for a moment, and then gripped it with his gloved hand.
Waya looked at him curiously.
“Lovely,” Hermione said, in a disdainful tone, but she too was smiling.
In an attempt to shake himself of his thoughts, he began to look for Ron and Hermione’s names on the board. He found Ron’s together with Seamus and Michael Corner, apprenticing under Gawain Robards.
“No,” he said, hoping Macmillan would just accept defeat and leave him alone.
pretty funny.
Potter shrugged again, and Draco was slightly surprised to see him walk over to the desks and pick up a chair to bring over. Draco just watched him. The way Potter did things was odd sometimes. Why walk over to the desks and drag a chair all the way over when he could have just levitated it over?
She sounded incredulous.
After the trials—after they had hauled Lucius off—Draco had expected his mother to fall apart. He had expected to step into his role as the man of the house, as Lucius had always told him he would one day. He had been prepared to take care of his grieving mother and devote all of his energy and focus on her. She deserved that.
This year had somewhat changed that. It was the first year without his father looming over his shoulder and critically watching every move he made. He still shut himself off sometimes, kept his face blank and emotionless, but it was more out of instinct now than anything else.
“What are you doing, Lovegood?” The question burst out of Draco like rushing water breaking a dam. “Why are you talking to me? Why are you being nice to me? You were a prisoner in my dungeons, Lovegood, my aunt
engraved into the silver.
“Anytime,” Hermione offered, easily. “But now, I do have to go, my apprenticeship starts at seven.”
Harry’s heart thrummed in his ears.
Potter stared at him.
Making the decision that he was going to go and see Draco had been incredibly difficult in and of itself, so it was no surprise that actually
be the family disappointment.”
”No, no, of course not. I was just wondering.”
“Oh good, you’re alive,” Malfoy said, in a dry tone, straightening back up. “Is my instruction boring you, Potter?”
Blaise and Theo looked at him for a second—and then both fell into their own grins.
energy, it would be able to Conjure other forms of energy.”
Truthfully, he didn’t think himself much braver now, but he’d seen so many terrible things—witnessed so many tragedies—that he figured he could deal with being punched a few times by an angry Gryffindor. It was bound to happen at some point.
Harry fidgeted in his seat. “They came out of nowhere and it felt…like I couldn’t control them. Like they weren’t
It was as if he had opened a dam. Potter’s arms relaxed, their weight and warmth leaning comfortably around Draco. His shoulders fell, causing Draco’s face to nestle further into his neck. He leaned his own head forward, until they were truly wrapped around each other.
he muttered, and watched the image of the figure become much larger. He could still only see the student from the back, but it didn’t matter—he’d recognize that pale blond hair anywhere.
“What about them?” asked Ginny, her voice somewhat hard.
“Potter,” he blurted, before he could stop himself. “Do you still have the hawthorn wand?”
Harry sighed.
“It’s not stupid, Potter,” Draco said. “And trust me, I’m always the first to tell you when you do something stupid.”
Ella’s eyes snapped to him and she immediately shook her head insistently.
Potter alternated between yelling out cheers and unsolicited advice at the players and talking to Draco about their apprenticeships, a conversation that mainly consisted of him asking questions that Draco wasn’t allowed to answer, which seemed to really challenge Potter’s patience.
rather brilliant.”
“You’re thinking I’m fit,” said Harry, a smug expression on his face.
Harry could feel his heart beating heavily against his chest, not sure what to do with himself but worked up all the same. He had agreed with the Prophet to have their address listed for any inquiries regarding the article, not wanting his own made public, and he silently begged that the man would decide to write to him.
“Are you alright?” Draco demanded. “Are you hurt?”
“I don’t bloody believe it,” Ron muttered through gritted teeth from beside him, and he sounded so angry that Harry’s attention was torn away from thoughts of Lavender.
“Mhm,” Harry confirmed, pulling back before kissing him again—once, twice.
He was hunched down again, and had the hood of his robes drawn over his head, but it was the unmistakable figure of Draco Malfoy.
“I’m not stupid, Harry, honestly. Who else could it be about?”
Neville nodded.
“What did he say?” asked Hermione, all semblance of patience gone.
“No,” he moaned, squeezing his eyes shut. “Not again.”
It was his second year being fully and independently in charge of Ollivander’s now. Most of the year was quite peaceful, and he was able to dedicate a majority of his time towards research and crafting new wands, with only the occasional customer dropping in for a purchase. Late summer was the busiest time, with an influx of new and returning Hogwarts students flooding the streets, first-years purchasing their first wands and a handful of older students bashfully admitting they had either broken or lost theirs. Christmastime was also somewhat demanding, but far more manageable. Thank Merlin for small mercies.
“Then what’s your problem?”
Weasley sputtered, as Draco obediently sat himself down in the armchair Granger indicated.
and chastising himself for probably scaring off a potential friend, this tall, strong man who worked with his hands and walked with such power and had a jawline that could cut glass, this man who could
“You don’t have to tell me,” Potter said suddenly, leaning back, as if realizing the reason for Draco’s hesitation.
“Gin! That’s brilliant!” he exclaimed, pulling her into a hug.
He was still constantly exhausted, his nightmares not having ceased. He was just functioning automatically, and Ashworth and Waya had clearly picked up on his odd behaviour. He had cancelled on Malfoy, simply not having it in him to conduct a session with such little energy.
“Go on, then. I’ll see you at breakfast. If the Hufflepuffs haven’t, I don’t know, cuddled you to death or whatever it is Hufflepuffs do,” Draco said, already turning to walk into his room.
At this, Potter seemed to become himself again, and offered Draco a grin.
It had always been that way. Potter had always been
A woman on the far right end of the table stood up, and Harry wondered how he didn’t notice her before, with her wild chestnut hair that seemed to explode around her in outrageous curls. She wore robes of a dark blue colour, instead of the standard Hogwarts black.
to him, protect him, care for him. All his old sharpness and sarcasm felt fake and tired.
“You just went around tapping trees on the hunch that loose magic might have triggered an old fairy ring to reopen?”
McGonagall didn’t look too pleased herself.
“And when it’s someone they claim to care about? A pureblood? When it’s someone they’re meant to prote—respect?” The words were coming out automatically again, tumbling out of his mouth before he could stop them, and he stumbled to try and repair his slip of the tongue, but it was too late.
“I suppose you will have to ask him that yourself, Mr Malfoy.”
“And Firewhisky!” she declared.
“It’s because of this maddening wand!” he burst out, withdrawing his wand from his robes and tossing it haphazardly on McGonagall’s desk. “I’ve used other people’s wands before, I know wands can have difficulty harnessing a wizard’s power if not finely attuned to the wizard using it, but I have never encountered a wand so utterly useless before in my life. Yes, kneazle hair does make for weaker wands, but I can barely cast a Lumos without it going out in three seconds flat.
,” he called. He rolled himself out of bed and stumbled over to let the owl, and a sharp gust of wind, into the room. Draco blinked as the owl dropped the Prophet on his desk.
Harry sat with this information, feeling an odd sense of discomfort. He didn’t like this idea of soulmates, the idea that he was meant to be with someone. The concept of destiny seemed to follow him around, and he preferred to feel like he had the choice regarding things.
“Back off, Smith,” Harry said, quietly. He didn’t want the rest of the class to realize what was going on back here, they didn’t need to start a fight.
Malfoy gave another laugh, a sound that Harry was now finding far more comforting than he expected.
“It’s quite alright,” replied Draco, but he allowed her to reach over and squeeze his hand.
“Thank you, Mr. Potter,” she’s said, her voice clear and smooth.
“What are you reading?” Violet asked, taking her usual seat beside Draco on the windowseat. Not wanting to get distracted, Draco simply held up the large book in order for her to see the title.
She had been right, of course. Malfoy Manor had been tainted with Dark Magic, Draco could feel it in every corner, seeping from the walls, rising from the floors. He had hated it.
why would you
He did feel much better after some hours of sleep though, so he chewed his food relatively happily and nodded along as the other three chatted. When they all finished, and began walking out of the Great Hall, Hermione pulled him aside and asked him if he felt any better.
Sophie laughed, but was interrupted by a sudden three sharp staccato tones. Her face immediately became serious and she pulled at the chain on her neck to reveal a locket-like necklace—standard issue for Healers, Mediwizards, and Mediwitches. It was flashing a soft yellow light.
“That has to do with Gamp’s Law of Elemental Transfiguration, doesn’t it? That’s why Conjured items don’t last and aren’t particularly strong or sturdy. I’ve never fully understood that, come to think of it, but if you consider it as a form of energy being drawn from your own magical core and then returning once the Conjured item ceases to exist…”
Malfoy made a sound, and Harry could’ve sworn it was a growl. Harry took a look at him—a proper look—and saw that Malfoy’s hands were clenched tightly into fists at his side, but he didn’t flinch, didn’t make a move for his wand.
“That never works,” Harry grumbled.
“Draco. I didn’t think you’d be back this year.”
“Cutting it close today, Malfoy,” Finchley said, scowling. Draco kept his head down on his way to his desk, not bothering to point out that Finchley had said the same exact thing yesterday.
at him.
"Thank you, Professor,” he said, nodding at both Dumbledore and Snape, and then striding off down the spiral staircase and towards the Great Hall, feeling a sense of purpose return to his steps.
Malfoy scowled at him.
“Hang on. Whoever this is, they can’t hear
Draco typically preferred to send memos for this purpose, but on the occasion that it required a personal visit to the Headquarters, he tried to shift it off to his colleague, Eleanor Branstone. Eleanor was young, no older than nineteen, and had slipped into the same position Draco had worked three years to obtain with ease. She was not entirely inept, but seemed to take her job rather casually, often not bothering to stamp memos or misfiling documents. She also wouldn’t willingly help Draco if his robes were on fire, but as Draco had discovered one day, there
Everyone’s hand fell except for Hermione’s.
She shoved the toast into her mouth, holding it with her teeth, grabbed her book-bag, and waved at them before hurrying away.
“Ginny, come on,” Potter urged from behind her, quietly. “You know Luna went up to him.”
“Oh, yes,” she said, in a quieter voice. “I read about that in the Quibbler last Tuesday. Apparently his house elf was with him for a day after he died, not knowing who to tell.”
Professor Ashworth only answered two more questions before he jumped off the desk and clapped his hands together.
“Yeah,” he said, his voice only slightly croaky. There was a long pause, as Hermione looked at him patiently, and Ron just continued looking confused.
“You know what I mean,” he said, shortly. “We don’t have to be friends to be able to work together.”
“Doesn’t mean he’s not here,” said Draco. There were ways to hide from the human-presence-revealing spell, after all.
in the middle of a case, and there are fucking cameras outside. They want me to give a
This was greeted by a substantial reaction—some students began whispering amongst themselves, Seamus seemed outraged, Ernie Macmillan’s normally pink face went white as a sheet, and even the Ravenclaws looked rather mutinous.
me instead of being a prick about it.”
Malfoy gave a little smile.
“Yes,” he replied, reaching for his glass of wine as though it were a lifeline.
Draco nodded slowly. He did indeed remember the intimidating—and mildly terrifying—Irene Parkinson.
“You want us to do what?” Potter asked, his eyes widening.
“He agreed,” said Harry. “We’re meeting at five tomorrow.”
“Oh. Tell him happy birthday,” he said, though there was also no reason for him to be wishing Theodore Nott a happy birthday. “And don’t worry, I won’t tell Slughorn.”
He felt a thousand stone lighter, and when Hermione looked at him and mouther,
“What made you decide you wanted to do this?” He asked. “Teaching, I mean?”
“Hmm,” said Hermione, thoughtfully. “Did she say why she prefers the Falcons?”
Hermione Granger was speaking rapidly to him and a figure Draco assumed was Ronald Weasley, based on the mess of ginger hair on the back of his head. Potter was nodding, though clearly didn’t seem to be processing any of what Granger was saying to him, his eyes still focused on the Sorting Hat.
Hermione nodded, busying herself with buttering a piece of toast at an inhuman speed.
“About the same.”
She gave them all a stern look that clearly stated no further protest was welcome.
Harry dutifully reached over and grabbed a jar of dark brown powder, which he assumed was what Malfoy wanted. He was proven right when Malfoy took the bowl without criticizing him.
Ginny’s thick eyebrows were furrowed and she looked rather thoughtful.
“Mum says that Hannah Abbott’s family thought about sending her to Beauxbatons to finish her N.E.W.T.s, but she insisted she finish at Hogwarts,” Ginny supplied.
Draco smirked a bit.
for a sister?
“And why, do you think, is it
She offered him a half-smile.
“Not yet, but I get the schedules on Friday,” Harry replied, leaning back as the waitress arrived, so she could Levitate their drinks over to them. Harry wrapped a hand around the cold bottle of Butterbeer gratefully, the condensation a welcome relief from the scorching weather that was keeping everyone hot and sweaty.
Right above McGonagall’s head, in an elegant golden frame, hung the portrait of Albus Dumbledore. He was in sky blue wizards robes and his matching eyes twinkled as they gazed down at Draco.
“At least he isn’t Seeker now,” Harry reasoned.
“At least there haven’t been any love potions yet,” said Hermione, brightly.
Hermione rolled her eyes.
Chang snickered.
Potter squinted, eyes scanning the pitch back and forth, but then he leaned back and shook his head.
Draco just nodded, unsure of what to say.
“Yes,” Harry confirmed. Malfoy’s tone only made him more sure.
“Alright,” he said, weakly. “Alright, let’s go.”
Draco forced himself to release Potter’s arm, despite it being very warm through his Auror robes.
“Apologies for my tardiness, students,” he huffed, clearly out of breath. “Professor Hagrid was showing me his new batch of flying lizard eggs and I simply lost track of time.”
Potter?” asked Malfoy, clearly teasing, hand on his hip and his eyes twinkling with mischief.
“Look, Harry, he was important to you. You cared about him once, and maybe you still do. Do you really never want to see him again?”
“Malfoy,” he said. Malfoy was dressed, of course, in Northstar’s newest men’s line—Quidditch leathers in a pale shade of grey that seemed to make his eyes shine and rough black dragonhide gloves that cut off at the second knuckle. He had a characteristic smirk on his face and he walked with the kind of elegance and poise that came from years of it being drilled into him.
