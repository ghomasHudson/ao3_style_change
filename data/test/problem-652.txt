He was briefly confused on how they had gotten to the point where they were arguing about a
“H- hello, Professor,” Draco finally managed to spit out. He couldn't make eye-contact with Dumbledore, so he just settled for looking at the blank patch of wall between the two former headmaster’s portraits.
Dumbledore could very likely be under the same sleeping curse as everyone else, since all of the other portraits he and Potter passed were sound asleep in their frames, so he knew he might not have to worry about seeing Dumbledore at all. But if Dumbledore was under the curse that meant Snape was too, and they wouldn’t be able to ask him about the book they had found. Draco didn’t know which situation was worse; seeing and talking to the man he had almost killed, or finding that same man, along with Draco’s former mentor asleep, providing no information on the mysterious book.
(Please no hate comments!)
Now that Draco was standing in front of the wall that led to the Room of Requirement, he knew he couldn’t be brave. Potter also seemed a little tense, so at least that eased his mind a bit.
Draco nodded his head, for lack of anything else to say or do.
They had spent the rest of the day in the library searching book after book, sitting at the same table in the same spot, and Draco could tell Potter had been getting more restless as time went on and they still hadn’t found anything. He wanted to insure Potter that it would be fine, they still had plenty more days to search until the two weeks were up. But he didn’t say anything. Now thinking back on it, he wished he had.
“Draco-” Harry whispered softly as he leaned in closer. His eyelashes fluttered as he closed his eyes slowly.
Harry was surprised at the subject change, but seemed ultimately glad that Draco had asked something that could lead to an actual conversation.
Potter did however pull a frown when Draco got to the limitations of the books’ powers. “We just have to use our questions wisely,” Potter said.
“Still, we’re different. If you look past all the war shit, and Slytherin shit, it’s obvious we’re nothing alike.” But Draco was becoming less and less confident of the words coming out of his mouth.
for all that he’d done. Not just in the last two weeks, but in the past year; for saving his life multiple times. “Thank you,” Draco started. “Not just for- for. Uh, I mean, thank you for setting this all up. It’s very kind of you.” He wanted to smack himself for being a coward
“So,” Potter coughed. “Hermione usually scolds me when I eat too much treacle tart. So around her I only have one or two. But sometimes when she isn’t looking, I grab extra. Or I go to the kitchens and the house elves give me some more.”
He bolted down the hall and swung into the potions classroom, and started to call out Theo’s name. If he were in the potions room, he would most likely be visible to Draco right away. It was a dark classroom, but not

“If you don’t want to hang out with me, or be around me, that’s fine. I don’t want to pressure you. I don’t want to force something on you that you don’t want. But please just tell me. Tell me what you want and I’ll do it.”
He also hated Potter, of course, for giving him the scars that blemished his skin. But, he supposed he was partially to blame, for he almost cast the
“I don’t fucking know why don’t you ask her yourself!” Potter chided.
After about four days had gone by since the ‘kitchen incident’ Blaise and Pansy started dating, which didn’t surprise Draco in the slightest. The two of them had been friends for a while, it was just that Blaise had never hung out with Draco or been his friend until recently. Luckily, Pansy and Blaise didn’t show affection towards each other in the slightest around Draco. And so, Draco’s little group went from two to three, and he was pretty fucking happy about it.
She sighed and her face looked full of sympathy. “Well alright. Here you go.” She handed him the wrap, and he took it gratefully. “Have a good night, dear.”
Draco wanted to imagine, at the very least, Harry fancied him. He really hoped Harry fancied him, because if not, looking back at their night spent dancing, Draco felt like he wanted to throw up. Knowing that he had said and done things that were entirely inappropriate to say and do with a straight man, who didn’t see Draco in
Draco nodded, then yawned. He was reminded once more that it was past twelve in the morning, in the darkness of the empty library, and that they had class at 8:30.
“Yeah. Okay, I’ll learn some new spells. But after a couple days practicing these, we go back to looking through books. Alright?”
“The cut healed itself. There’s a faint scar, but you can hardly tell it’s there. I wanted to wrap it up though so it could finish healing properly. The skin where-”
actually
His skin looked terribly pale.
Potter was stunned. He was massaging the spot where Draco had punched him, and Draco wondered if the punch
He felt horrible about having to lie to Potter about something else, but he told himself he would eventually get around to telling Potter about the offer, right after he found out what exactly the offer was.
In that same first week since he had been back at school, attending his classes, Draco got it into his head that Harry was the problem. Because, why was he feeling like shit, despite his newfound life?
He made it to the dungeon corridors, figuring he would start there on his search, as it
So here he was now, helplessly banging on the door, hoping that someone would come by and let him out. He had tried countless opening spells on the door, but nothing worked. He didn’t know how the people who had locked him in the closet had secured the door so well. But that didn’t matter now, because he had to get to class. His transfigurations professor would not believe him in the slightest if Draco told him that he had gotten locked in a closet, which was why he was late. Even if his story was believed, his professor wouldn’t care, and Draco would be given detention for tardiness, which meant a one way ticket back to Azkaban.
"Yeah, thanks," he replied, Ty laughed.
"You wouldn't dare..."
"Your wish is my command," said Sirius, grabbing Remus' hand and dragging him in the direction of the dormitories.
Albus turned his head around that it was facing Scorpius' stomach, he put his arms around him and hugged him firmly. Scorpius also hugged him, placing one of his hands on his boyfriend's back and stroking it slightly. His other hand was placed at Albus' hair, which he decided to comb with his fingers, from time to time stroking the skin at the back of his head. Albus fall asleep qucikly, from time to time he was making noises like "mmm" or "yeah...".
Sirius took the fork from Remus, lifted it up, and put the first piece into the other boy's mouth. Sweet chocolate melted on Remus' tongue, the boy smiled blissfully and closed his eyes.
Nicky rubbed his hands and smiled even wider.
"Yes or no?" His voice showed no emotion.
If you liked it feel free to leave kudos and comments.
Remus reached for the cake. He was about to put the first piece into his mouth, when Sirius spoke again.
If you liked it feel free to leave kudos and comments.
"PENNY!" cried Simon, the girl laughed loudly. "You have 5 seconds to run away. 5..." Penny started running, and Simon ran after her.
Karkat looked at her stunned.
This damn caroller stood there for good 10 minutes while Nico ignored him totally. A normal person would've given up and leaved long ago, but he stood there and knocked on the door without any breaks, and called. Nico's patience was running thin. Can't that guy just take the hint and leave? Apparently fricking not.
"Weeeeeell..." Harry looked down. "I certainly wasn't missing you very much and didn't want to see you so damn bad. Certainly not that."
"You could've just read the whole script before you signed up, Karkat. Then there wouldn't be any problem," the teacher told him for the second time.
"Well, okay," the caroler sighed and began to sing
Thank you for reading!
Thank you for reading!
"And what now? Who won?" asked Bubblegum.
"Merry Christmas, Adam."
"Can I feed you the cake?" he asked suddenly.
Baz rolled his eyes.
The traditional annual Marauders Christmas dinner.
Thank you for reading!
, huh? Blue wanted to punch him so much.
For the next several minutes they continued doing it in silence, which was finally broken by Sirius.
Draco tore the package open and saw a green sweater inside. He took it out and unfolded it. The sweater was a bit misshapen and a silver letter D in the middle was slightly curved. Draco had never gotten a better gift before.
"How bad was that?" asked the caroler.
"Your phone number will do."
Nico got up from the couch.
Mrs. Smith sighed.
"Aleeeeeeeeeeeeeeexander!" a woman's voice yelled, and Alex knew he was in trouble.
He shook off his thoughts. It was something to worry about later, now he should focus on crushing Simon Snow not on dating him.
Blue felt the wave of relief wash over her. She'll be half an hour late, but at least she'll be there. She scanned the sweater and a few other things, which the boy chose, and then she handed them to him. The boy handed the sweater back to her.
"My lips are freezing from the cold, kiss me."
Scorpius lets tired Albus rest.
"Something happened? You're making some weird faces."
"Sure," Nico dictated it to him.
Remus turned around to face him. They were very close to each other, their noses almost touching. The black-haired boy looked down at Remus' mouth, and started to lean.
A surprise.
Thank you for reading!
"Quickly, I don't have a whole day."
Adam's heart stopped and then started beating again with twice the power.
"You're the best! How can I repay you for it?"
The blond laughed loudly.

"I'm not sure. Maybe you should show me one more time, or maybe even a few times."
"As heck."
"Merry Christmas," said Harry, hugging him suddenly from behind.
He opened them finally, putting in a bit more force than was necessary. He saw a tall blond guy, his smile bright, which was the perfect contrast to his own scowl.
"Let's just say that I decided to go back sooner," he grinned widely.
Thank you for reading!
Thank you for reading!
"Liar," Kit flashed a slight smile at him and Ty smiled back.
Karkat's speaking without capslock, because I thought that it suits this AU better. I hope you don't mind
The boy laughed and walked over to the counter, carrying two sweaters. He looked at her closely.
Henry leaned over and pressed their lips together in a kiss. Alex immediately felt warmer and better.
Albus grabbed Scorpius' hand and moved it away from his face. Scorpius was about to ask if something happened, when Albus put his lips on it and kissed it. Then the boy placed it back on his cheek, and Scorpius melted totally.
"What? Erm... Yeah?" said Remus, but it sounded more like a question.
If you liked it feel free to leave kudos and comments.
Kit wanted to go back to rubbing his hands, but before he could've done that, Ty had taken his hands into his. Kit blushed immediately.
"I'd rather," she begin, "you decide what you want and leave before I throw something at you."
The prince sighed.
If only Karkat knew how much Dave was already thinking about it.

"Okay, Okay... Thanks."
Neil did as he was told and saw a mistletoe hanging from the ceiling. He rolled his eyes and groaned.

"You can pretend you're not there all you want," called the caroler, "but I saw the light in your windows, when I was passing by, so I know that you're there. I ain't gonna go away untill you open the door."
"Huh?" muttered the other boy.
(Gansey's also there for some reason. I dunno, I was tired while writing that).
"I don't have any other choice, don't I?"
Ronan smiled at him and got up from the chair that he was sitting on. Adam quickly rushed towards him, hugged him and then kissed him firmly.
Thank you for reading this series!
"It's not very good, I know, but..." Harry began, but Draco cut him off by pulling him closer and kissing him firmly.
"Well, whatever helps you sleep at night. It's for sure still better than not having any decorations at all though," he looked at Simon's house.
"Maybe go to sleep, huh? I will wake you up for the supper," Scorpius smiled encouragingly.
"But Mrs. Smith," Karkat begin calmer, "when I signed up for this show I was sure that Strider would play at most my enemy. Noone said anything about him playing my love interest. And that I'll have to kiss him!" His voice rose a bit in the middle of the last sentence.
"Oh my God! Get a room, you two!" James suddenly exclaimed, making Remus and Sirius jump away from each other as if they got burned.
"You are lucky that I have a soft spot for you."
"You won't let me in?"
If you liked it feel free to leave kudos and comments.
"I love you."

Their position was causing Kit a slight trouble with walking, but he wasn't going to complain, when Ty,
Ronan surprises Adam.
Faces of both boys grimaced in horror.
Freezing cold was piercing through every part of his body. He was regretting agreeing to go out for a walk with his friend in the weather like that. Horribly low temperature, all the snow around them, and ice on the sidewalks. Not the best time for a walk, but Kit was unable to refuse Ty, when he asked him to go. Well, Kit was pretty much always unable to refuse him, but that's another story.
Being tired with their several-minute fight and making the fort, they fell down at the blankets and pillows. Marceline laughed triumphantly.
"I will crush you, Baz."
"Kiss me."
"This. Is. The. Best. Gift. Ever," he spoke while kissing and Harry laughed happily. It was by far the best Christmas of his life.
"What...?" he stuttered.
"Yeah?" he asked.
"Yes?" replied Neil.
, he kept telling himself, but he wasn't so sure of that. He had no idea, what Karkat may do, because the boy refused to kiss Dave during rehearsals.
"How am I supposed to know that? I don't even know her," she told him.

Snow was falling outside the window, in the fireplace in front of, which they were sitting, a warm fire was burning, and Scorpius felt as if his own heart was about to jump out of his ribcage and dance in the middle of the room. He loved his boyfriend the most in the world, and in that moment it was the only thing that mattered to him. The whole world was dissapearing every time he looked at Albus. It was the only thing that mattered, Albus and nothing more.
"Alex, we are at the cultural eve-"
One cannot simply ignore Will Solace.
"Oh hell no!" Karkat called again. For about five minutes he was non stop showing his enormous indignation. Dave preferred to leave his nervousness inside his mind.
"I'm very glad that you asked," he said. "Nothing special, just... Look up."
"I love you too."
"You're impossible," Adam said while laughing. "You're completely impossible."
"Nico."
"I'll take the blue one," he decided.
"Karkat, I know that you're angry, but it's not a reason for you to constantly shout," said Mrs. Smith, their theater teacher, her voice sharp.
"Good luck," Nico smiled and slightly closed the door.

"We're standing in the back, no one will notice," the dark-haired boy interrupted him. "Come on, please."
"Well, that's true, but please look at them and give me your female opinion, and tell me which one would you choose" he smiled at her slightly.
As soon as they got there Sirius pushed Remus against the wall and kissed him fiercely, putting his hands under the other boy's sweater, touching the skin on his back. He stroked lightly the scars that marked his back, while Remus used his hands to comb his friend's dark hair. They both felt that at last everything was in the right place.
"I have something for you," Harry looked anxiously at the floor.
"Okay, okay. I'll declare you a winner, but on one condition," she said.
Marceline and Bubblegum spend some time together.
"That's exactly why we didn't tell you," Gansey patted him on the shoulder.
"James!" yelled Sirius.
(See the end of the chapter for
Thank you for reading!
"Gansey, it's okay. Thanks, that's very nice of you, but you could've just told me. I would've helped."
"Hello?" called the voice yet again, Nico cursed under his breath.
"You're very cute and stuff, but please don't make out in front of everyone."
"You know damn well that we just haven't hung them yet, Baz! Not everyone is so weird that they must hung their decorations in the middle of the bloody November."
For some weird reason Blue couldn't stop smiling for the whole way back home.
"And what do you have to say, Ronan?" Adam turned to face his boyfriend.
"It wasn't bad, but... erm... very original. Yes."
Blue was sick of him. Today she was supposed to close the store a lot sooner than normally, on 6 pm, and then go inside her shitty car and rush home to make it on time for Christmas dinner with her family. She has been working since the morning, she had enough, she wanted just to end the day. However, the customer had other plans. He came around 5:55 pm, Blue hoped that he would make his shopping quick and leave, but she was wrong. The clock was showing 6:20 pm and he still was moving around the shop, looking at things, and asking her lots of questions. He was oblivious to her pain.
Poor Gansey standing there awkwardly, while his best friends act all lovey-dovey.
"I won!" she gasped, nudging Bubblegum lightly.
"What condition?"
"This will keep your hands warm."
The traditional annual Marauders Christmas dinner was coming to an end, when suddenly Remus sat on Sirius' lap, the black haired boy hugging him automatically from behind. They had done it so many times that their friends didn't even bat an eye at them.

"No."
"Mmm... The best," he said, Sirius laughed at him.
"Surprise!" the boy shouted. "Before you say anything, we knew that you won't do anything here, so Ronan suggested that we should go here and decorate it for you."
"Finally," said the blond guy.
And here goes the last one. Enjoy!
Nico raised his eyebrow.
"You do?"
"I knew you were going to want it," he pulled away from Remus and smiled. "Take it."
Thank you for reading!
Harry surprises Draco with a very original gift.
Bubblegum laughed lightly, then she leaned in and pecked Marceline's lips with hers.
And then he pulled him even closer and kissed him on the lips.
"Really, Nicky?" he asked. "A mistletoe trap? Very-"
As if he was called, Baz came out of his house. He looked fancy, so he was probably about to go somewhere, but he stopped, when he saw Simon and Penny. He raised his damn, dark eyebrows.
"How many times do I have to tell you that you can't quit, Karkat?" she asked. "Putting on a play is our school's Christmas tradition. You signed up, everything's already ready. You can't quit, when we already announced everything."
Kit and Ty have a walk.
"Well, maybe-"
"If you quit now, I won't let you play in any other show until the end of your senior year."
"Wonderful," she said, her voice falsely sweet. "Is that it?"
"By the way, I'm Will."
"Can you two stop flirting aggressively with each other?" asked Penny.
"I'm cold," said Kit, once again rubbing his hands.
Thank you for reading!
"That's for you," he said. "Merry Christmas, Blue."
"You could've just worn your gloves," Ty told him.
Sirius laughed, the sound was slightly muffled by the fact that his face was pressed against Remus' back.
As it turned out three hours later, someone must have noticed them, because the photo of them kissing was on the covers of most gossip magazines, and on their websites. Alex only hoped his mom wouldn't be mad, maybe she won't even noti-
"He- He nearly! He tried to..." He could not seem to get the words out, but those particular words were unnecessary.
"Shouldn't you be asking him that?" Was my godson's angsty reply - there were a lot of those, even before then and have been many more since; they were at the height of their teenage years, so I suppose I can permit it.
A simple diagnostic spell only increased my worry for the bloodied boy, and I dispatched Draco to fetch me some essential potions - primarily the Blood-Replenishing potion I permenantly kept in my personal stock... Habits can be hard to break sometimes.
The pale of his skin was almost as stark in the darkness, that ghostly moonlight making already pale and bloodless skin almost translucent. His splash of unruly black hair, that is always messy even if it is combed but it definitely hadn't been for a while.
"I would rather you be getting something in you, you lost a lot of blood." See, I was a burgeoning Healer even then! "And because it's better than being holed up in here all the time. Trust me." The look on his face then, honestly I wasn't asking him to step onto a magic carpet or anything! It was just tea - was he British or not?
Those glasses.
My godfather doesn't often admit such things, even when he was helping my initial... therapy.
look like anything other than..."
The room was earthy then, Sev has redecorated it since into some beautiful ocean blues and green - but back then it was shades of brown, really. Bare but iconic Hogwarts stonework mostly hidden by towering bookshelves laden with volumes, a wall hanging or two, the huge fireplace not too dissimilar to the one situated in Gryffindor's common room (and, later I learned, in Slytherin's) and also two doors. One by which I had entered, although I didn't know it, and the other by which the Potions Professor would soon enter - which actually led to his kitchenette.
Those words scared me, the flutterings of panic rising up my throat even as my exhausted eyelids closed, but at the time I couldn't think why.
I agreed, against the urgings of my latent anxiety, to come early in the evening; supposedly for a cuppa but possibly to grab dinner also. Apparently no one had explained to Harry he wasn't going to be leaving to go to the Great Hall for meals - when Uncle Sev told me
My reply of "I will." felt as solemn as an oath, I can still sense its binding upon me if I concentrate.
I know I would be in quite a different situation if Uncle Sev hadn't of helped me. I wouldn't have lasted five minutes in that dorm room without his secret lessons - his lessons in secrets, as I remember calling them. To myself of course, there wasn't anyone I could share that piece of excellent wit with...
His tone was abrupt, at the time it seemed like normal Snape - looking back, I think I hear less of the snark I know so well. But I didn't really know him them, or I'd have realised he was more worried than he pretended.
I rarely know when he is feeling like that, I used to be able to guess - both of us could, Harry too. Sometimes you just know a thing like that. But since we moved out I guess there's no one there to fix him a cup of tea when he's stuck staring at the bare healed skin of his wrist at the kitchen table for hours. I should check in with him more, especially to see if he's trying to write like I am here. Bumbling along!
"What about me?" I probably put my hands on my hips then. I don't know for sure but, knowing me, I probably did.
With a small, strained and tired but nonetheless real, smile tugging at the corners of his lips, he cocked one eyebrow at me and muttered: "His nickname is 'Sev'?"
I told him what I knew, where I had found him - but I could offer no further insight into the events of the night which had led us all there. Neither of us could, for that we had to wait for Harry's side.
Then I paused, and realised something that changed the game forever:
The room beyond was even darker than the hall in which I was standing, a single porthole of thick old glass sunk into the far wall allowed some faint memory of moonlight that seeped through the murky lake to light the space - sort of. As it was I was squinting.
I was prepared to take the necessary measures, but unlike last time I was uncertain I could achieve the desired effects alone; I thought I needed my godson to help Harry, to help me help Lily's son. I was right of course. Although I could never have guessed where things would lead...
"Do I need you to swear not to tell anyone?" I questioned.
[24/07/21]
"There tea and scones in the sitting room." I spoke softly but not too kindly I think, I can recall not wanting to jar him by changing too suddenly but looking back I reckon that ship had already sailed. Or sunk, rather...
But I knew I had come to the right place - if
I think I knelt, I must of, but all I remember is the moment when I lifted his sleeve.
When I came to properly, I was definitely alone - at least at first. I blinked several times trying to clear my head, though the world had stopped spinning my mind was still foggy and my memory a little scattered.
currently going on amongst too many of the older years. He couldn't keep this up for much longer. Even with his godfather's help - without which he wouldn't have lasted five minutes - teaching him so much in secret: occlumency, additional potion classes, wandless magic and duelling training. He fumed quietly in his head, shielded by his mental barriers and the silence of his surroundings, as he strode determinedly without direction: away...
Occlumency taught by Sev shielded my mind as I left, my quiet broken-hearted anger tucked behind my mental barriers as instructed.
As I peeled the blood-soaked material aside, the two
I tried to smile but it was more like a grimace I suspect.
I did let out a sigh then, it was far too early in the game to reveal my hand like this; but I didn't want to lie to him, I felt like he deserved the truth in that moment.
"He is not concious." I pointed out sardonically, taking great pleasure in raising one eyebrow and eliciting a rolling of the eyes in response. "It would be rather difficult to get a reply."
"But the Gryffindors? His friends? They would be of more help than I would, his enemy."
I can recall applying the various cleaning and healing remedies, forced to spell some directly into the unconcious boy's stomach; Draco has told me I was murmuring under my breath the whole time, not just spells but platitudes and orders and pleas - although I don't dispute I was desperate and terrified enough, I cannot recollect the words themselves. I suppose my attention was elsewhere.
"It was pretty graphic, and therefore triggering." I explained, pushing away dark memories of my own - even as I still must briefly now, as I recall the sight of Harry's wrists that night. "Have you... felt any urges?"
"I would like to point out that we are yet to hear from Potter, we do not know the circumstances and I should thank you not to jump to conclusions."
sighed. I would have thought 'Potter' had more brains than that; and he does, I am happy to report, but he wasn't really using them in that moment...
But I always insist it was because of what he did that night, not me.
I didn't immediately remember what had happened, what I had done...
I crept past their ajar door and made my escape; upon passing some of the younger years who were in the common room on my way out, I calmly rattled off a lie so believable and easily that I have no idea what it was.
"I freely admit it is likely," I agreed wryly, then added the ace up my sleeve. "But he has the two people most able to help him, right here."
"You should be resting." Were the first words I can recall, the first of many many more - but that would come later.
I padded in, memory guiding me blindly as I trod past rows of decaying desks and crumbled chairs - the ancient charms set to preserve them having long since dulled.
"Draco. Right now, I'm concerned about you." I admitted quietly, Harry was not in danger of being woken but I felt the need to speak softly nevertheless.
"Why would you help me? Why would you bring me my homework and offer to help me with it without a trace of mockery?" We both know what he was really asking, of course: what has changed now? Why is this so different, why should you care what happens to me?
"What have you got yourself into this time?" I remember thinking, although I can't recall if I voiced it. I almost want to add some insult, or diminutive address; but then I would be lying, and I've already done enough of that to last a lifetime.
I didn't know what to do, there was
Now here's where things go fuzzy.
Sev put a hand to my forehead and he must have been concerned by what he felt because he guided me back onto the warm sofa without a sound.
ragged cuts it hid stilled me. In shock, and in recognition.
He had looked away from me, avoiding my gaze like it might give him dragon pox when I added:
I wanted to make it easily for him, even then. He wasn't my enemy - I knew that already. But I thought we had been given our roles and were both prepared to play them; then again, I had never thought to ask my supposed adversary, so I have not excuse for being so surprised at how things ended up.
"Of course not." He scoffed and I almost grinned. "What will you tell McGonagall? Or the headmaster?"
The door was heavy, always was and always has been - it was just as heavy and dusty the last time I visited.
Then next time I saw Harry was later the next day. I had wanted to leave it a little longer, but Sev had been rattled when I met him for breakfast - in his office instead of his sitting room as usual, for obvious reasons.
"What are you talking about? Surely he will return to his house in the morning and that will be that. He isn't our responsibility." I scowled at his compartmentalising, wishing I could allow myself the same denials.
"The facts." He looked at me sharply and I allowed myself a smirk. "But only the barest ones. They have a right to know that - Dumbledore will agree that it must go no further."
I don't think I even opened my eyes, but I never asked about those sorts of details.
He was there of course, looking both curiously and warily at me as I stood in the doorway - having almost forgotten why I was there if I'm being honest like Harry has instructed me to try to be in these pages.
When Uncle Sev finally asked my what happened I hadn't got my story straight - all those secret extra lessons in deception, maintaining control of a situation and being ready for anything... He would have been disappointed if he wasn't so distracted.
"Will you help me?" I still don't know what drove me to ask that of him, or what gave me the words I wasn't sure I could find.
"What?" His response was startled and confused, so I sought to explain myself.
I believe I leapt to my feet, or tried to - finding them covered by a soft blanket which of course became tangled around my ankles. I would have fallen, almost did, except Sev caught me.
But that child was stable and more importantly deep in a healing sleep by that time, whereas my other charge was in a less than peaceful state.
I still don't know how he put down the tray he was carrying fast enough to grab me before I hit the deck, I suppose because he forsaw my tumble somehow.
Harry's first POV.
Which is of course why my raven is trying to get all three of us to write our side of things - I agree with him on that at least, this is a story of thirds...
I remember smiling at him and offering a hug, neither of us were openly very touchy feely - though Harry has successfully taught us to be far more comfortable about it since - but physical contact was remarkably instinctual and calming.
"Why should it?" He returned, dancing around the question like the master I had taught him to be - unfortunately the skill was backfiring on me slightly.
"But I am a Gryffindor!" I
I remember trying my best to hold onto hope though I was never very good at that. I'm not much better at it even now, but I'm working on it.
"You don't have to have experienced such things to be of help." He replied sullenly.
I had felt so alone, Uncle Sev is good company when he tries to be but there's nothign quite like having a close friend your own age.
So, they both danced together. Not really ‘together,’ but close to each other. Harry was not embarrassed about dancing, which honestly turned into jumping up and down as they listened to “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” ten times. Even if he was embarrassed, he didn’t show it.
by now, but he had been wrong. It had only hurt the slightest amount at Hogsmeade, but he had ignored it then, focusing on the mission at hand. But now he had nothing to occupy his mind, and worse, nothing to occupy Potter’s mind, so he would surely wonder why Draco had sprinted to the bathroom.
“No! I-” Potter stuttered, searching for an excuse. “Okay, fine, I guess I did.” He rubbed the back of his neck. “You can call me Harry, if you want. Only if I’m allowed to call you Draco for now on.”
The Figure had brown eyes, and brown hair. He looked old; worn out from exhaustion and revenge, when in reality, he was probably in his thirties. He looked like no one Draco had ever seen in his entire life.
When he had made his way into the castle himself, he respected Harry’s wish to be left alone, albeit reluctantly. He knew that if the situation were reversed, he’d want to be alone with his thoughts too, and not surrounded by the presence of the person who had lied to him.
She finally came back to reality, and shook her head a little bit, slowly moving towards him.
He stopped his trudge towards the stairs that led to the boy’s dormitory and looked up and around the common room, trying to spot her and trying to seem inconspicuous at the same time. He found her standing at the back of the room behind a large mountain of books--which made the top of her head only visible--waving her hand like a crazy person and not being quiet enough while ‘whispering’ his name.
All of their fights, all of their shared animosity and hatred for each other, their hexes and jinxes and cruel words crawled through Draco’s mind. A rejected handshake. Quidditch matches. Dementors and the Triwizard tournament. The Inquisitorial squad. Sixth year. Draco crumbling under the pressure of the Dark Lord, and Harry following him every chance he got. Malfoy Manor and the lies he told to insure Harry and his friends' safety. The FIendfyre and Draco clutching onto Harry, terrified that he would die.
Right on cue, Draco fell, tripping over his own feet, and skidded across the floor which was covered in dust. Well, it had been covered in dust until Draco had run and fell on it.
“And I feel awful for Alec. I know I probably shouldn’t, but I do.”
Draco turned his body around, looking at Harry who was also filled with laughter.
“You were constantly grasping your arm. I know you tried to hide it from me, but I noticed. You were in pain. You always disappeared to the bathroom. I thought you were harming yourself!” Harry was on the verge of crying. Draco was starting to piece together what was going on, but he needed Harry to finish explaining.
Though, he had considered locating Harry on his map, but when Draco searched all his pockets for it, he found that the map was not in his possession, and walking back outside to search for Harry’s magical map seemed foolish too- he told himself he would become ill if he was outside for too long- and so he just hoped Harry had his map. It seemed important to him.
“Just talking to the Headmistress,” his mother said with a smile. “Plus, I wanted to see you again before I left.” She turned to face McGonagall. “Is it alright if I wait outside by the gargoyle for you two to finish?”
“I was casting revealing charms, there's no way you could have avoided that!”
or some shit. Draco respected McGonagall, he really did, but he thought that idea was the worst idea she had ever come up with. That anyone could come up with.
Harry
Narcissa chuckled and pulled Draco in for a tight hug. He was glad that the Curse had miraculously brought them closer together. He was glad that they got to spend so much time together in the Hospital Wing, even if a lot of the time was spent by Draco grieving and moping.
a stripper. But she definitely fit a lot of the requirements.
“I just have to drop some things off in my dorm first. Then I’ll meet you back here and we can go.”
“Of course, our family had been one of the first ripped apart. I spent so long in your dungeon-” Draco didn’t miss out on how Drys said
“Wait, look at that.” Draco pointed to some words carved into the door. They read: Hortus de Mystica. “Garden of Mystics,” Draco told Harry.
When he finally got his hands on the paper, he cursed himself for reacting just the same way as his friends did.
Draco jerked his head towards the end of his bed, where Granger now stood. She was clearly nervous, fiddling with the ends of her robes. Weasley and Potter had come closer too, all three of them were now in a clump.
“What do you mean?” Draco wasn’t mad at Harry. He actually felt more affection towards him at the thought that Harry wanted to make sure Draco was safe and okay.
Wow, he really was pathetic.
Draco also wanted to bring up his dream again, how that had happened on the same day too, but he felt it would probably lead to some sort of argument, like it had earlier that day. He also thought about his Mark, how that had somehow awoken the previous night, before he had fallen asleep and had the dream and found out everyone was under a spell. He wasn’t going to tell Potter about that, though. No way.
Draco watched Potter breath softly in his sleep as he lay in his own bed, having trouble falling asleep himself even though he was fatigued.
Harry pulled him to his feet.
“And I won’t either.”
His feet moved on their own accord, and before he knew it he was standing at the side of Harry’s sickeningly Gryffindor bed.
This was one of the best and most care-free moments he’d ever had the pleasure of experiencing. All thanks to the two of them fighting.
He made a tiny crack in the door, peering out to see if Harry was waiting silently to stun him, and possibly force Draco’s secrets out. Fortunately, he saw no sign of Harry, and the lights were off, which meant he was most likely lying in bed awake, or already asleep.
“So that’s when I started experimenting on his book, using spells and potions to try and break whatever enchantments that only allowed you to ask three questions. It took lots of trials, but I did it; I broke the enchantment, and all the knowledge in the world was at my fingertips, and all I needed to do was ask it what I wanted to know, and it delivered. Every time.”
Suddenly, Alec spoke. “Father can wake anyone up at any given time, so he woke me up today. Snape’s book really is quite lovely. There’s so much information; information that can help you achieve anything.
Their words turned to touches and sweet kisses; that would one day be lost in time but never lost in their hearts.
Harry shrugged. “Maybe over the past two weeks I’ve gotten good at reading you.”
This is my longest chapter yet with a whopping 16k words, so grab your popcorn and be prepared!
Draco hadn’t known he was kicking up snow, but now that Potter had said something, he intentionally made sure his shoes were flinging Potter with snow.
Somehow, they moved farther onto the bed so no body parts were left hanging off, and Draco was now on top of Harry, his leg slotted between Harry’s and their hips crushed against each other. Sounds of pleasure came from both their mouths, and Draco relished whenever Harry gasped.
“Okay, fine, maybe it was a tiny bit of a big deal.”
“Here,” he responded.
And the exact words the figure said were, ‘They will all stay asleep. Thirteen days, Draco Malfoy, thirteen days and they-’ and then the person cut off. He was still talking, but it was like the message was censored or something and I couldn’t hear what he was saying. I wish I could’ve. It doesn’t make any sense.”
“But after I came out of my own vision, everything in the real world felt clearer. My… my Mark, it didn’t burn anymore, and whatever spell Drys had been casting on me to Pull me in, probably a variation of the Imperius, it didn’t work. And after he realized whatever he was casting wasn’t doing shit to me, he cast the Killing Curse on you.”
“Please call him Draco, Alec. And it’s okay, he gets a pass today.” She smiled at him, a real genuine smile, and Draco thought he could hug her right now.
He was then in the Garden of Mystics with Harry. They were slow dancing again, and there were words floating through the air.
he told himself. And for now, he was fine with that little progress he’d made.
He had been hit with disbelief at the words Potter had said, but hadn't really felt the loss of everyone else's presence until he had seen Pansy. Now, it was like they absolutely needed to do everything in their will to break whatever
Another birthday. Another year older. Another pathetic year of his life wasted.
It was amusing how he and Potter went back and forth consoling the other, saying comforting words when they got upset. Sometimes Potter was the one filled with anger and annoyance, and Draco was the one who spoke reassuringly. Sometimes it was the other way around, like right now.
“We’re just confused, is all,” McGonagall cut in. “I know there is more to the story. We would just like to see your side before we jump to conclusions.” At the last part, she glared again at the Auror.
Pansy flipped him off, and then got up and left.
The small noises of the outside surrounded them as they sat together. Draco still had something he wanted to say, but he couldn’t think of a proper way to say them.
, an even worse thought, was that Theo
They eventually arrived at a fancy door, and when Narcissa pushed it open, he knew what they were doing at the hotel immediately.
Harry grinned. “Okay now,
“I completely forgive you for everything.”
“So,” Harry spoke at last, in a voice low enough that only Draco could hear. “Should we talk somewhere more… private?” He ran a hand through his hair.
But after a couple times blinking, his doubt disappeared, and reality set in.
But, the whole situation just felt odd. It sort of felt like a zombie rising from the dead: insanely creepy.
He didn’t voice any of what he was thinking to Potter. “It’s getting late. It’ll be completely dark soon.”
He almost started laughing to himself as he realized he’d been standing there thinking about wind and sunlight, when Harry was clearly in awe at the Garden as a whole.
.” He hadn’t meant it to come out sounding like an insult, but he realized a little too late it sort of had.
He sat up farther in his bed, shifting to get more comfortable. He thought about his dream again. Was it a dream? It felt more than that. It felt like someone had actually entered his mind. That was ridiculous, though. No one could have entered his mind, he knew that. He was exceptionally good at Occlumency, and rarely ever kept his shields down.
Draco has a strange dream. Or is it more than that?
He hoped his mind wasn’t somehow playing tricks on him, making Draco think he was in love with Harry. He didn’t think that was even possible, since no one could make someone fall in love with another person, but they could manipulate you into thinking you were in love. Something Draco wouldn’t wish upon his greatest enemy. Except for the Dark Lord. Obviously. Or Kaspian. Or Theo.
Zacharias Smith and company blocked the door, the only way out of the room. Smith and his group kept walking closer and closer to Draco, until he had hit the back wall of the classroom. He was truly trapped and had nowhere else to go. He probably looked really pathetic, shrinking in on himself, tightly gripping his wand; the one he could not use to fucking defend himself.
he could always rely on his mum, and after the past week, he was positive he could.
“Times up,” Drys said. “What’s it going to be?”
Draco’s eyes always somehow landed on Potter. He guessed old habits die hard.
“Malfoy, you need to go to the Hospital Wing. Like now. Can you walk? Never mind, you probably can’t. I’ll go get a teacher-”
It seemed kind of selfish that Draco was more worried about what would happen to Harry, than what would happen to the rest of Hogwarts and his parents. Sure, the fact that hundreds of people were unconsciously counting on him to break them free of the sleeping curse was a pretty good motive to make the “right” choice, but Draco was still one hundred percent
“Get out of the way,” Drys said through gritted teeth.
. She did kiss me once, but that’s a story for a different time. No, I never had a boyfriend. I did kiss Theo though, in sixth year. That did not end well,” Draco grimaced. “Don’t ever tell anyone about Theo.”
“Oh. Well that isn’t too bad of a catch,” Draco said. He was sure there had to be a counter-curse for whatever Hogwarts was under. “So basically, once Potter and I reveal a secret to the book, it will allow us to ask it whatever we want, and if whatever we ask it already exists in the Wizarding World, it will show it to us on its pages?”
He wished he hadn’t written the letter to his father. He wished he would have been smart enough to send out a piece of parchment with the word, ‘HELP,’ and had an owl send it to the Ministry.
The staircase automatically turned into a slide, and Draco couldn’t help but gape at the sight. He’d of course seen the change happen when he’d attempted trying to break into the girl’s dormitories, but seeing
“Give me the knotgrass.”
Potter lifted himself off the steps, and took a couple steps in Draco’s direction. “We need to do something.”
At least for one night anyways until they figured out the next best option of where they should sleep.
I'm currently on vacation for my birthday on the 23rd, so I won't be able to write a lot. It will probably be maybe another two weeks until the next chapter, so if I end up not posting for a while I promise I am not abandoning this story
The next morning had been almost exactly like the first.
did you kidnap Harry in the first place, and
“Salazar, Pansy, I didn’t know you cared about me that much,” Draco said with a slight smirk forming.
His plan was to write a letter to his father in Azkaban, asking if his Mark had started moving once again like Draco’s. He
The Death Eater’s all looked at each other, and Draco sensed that they were all smiling under their masks. “If you insist,” the leader said.
He turned on his heels, and headed in the direction of the library, where he would start research on whatever was going on. He was sure Potter was staring dumbly at the back of Draco’s hair.
Even as Draco stood in the middle of the hallway, mentally reassuring himself: he wasn’t reassured. The painful burning sensation reminded him way too much of a darker time. A time where Draco was scared to breathe. He had felt that if he did, the Dark Lord would kill him or his family.
in the middle of the table. “Let’s
Draco slowly pushed Harry away from him, his heart begging him to keep Harry close, but his mind begging him to never have Harry touch him again.
He kept thinking about the summer before Eighth Year.
After a little confrontation between McGonagall and Snape, the two figures in the portraits left.
Did the sky seem darker? Did the forest seem duller? Did life seem less happy and full of goodness?
He gritted his teeth, once again feeling the pain wash over him as he thought about how Harry was somewhere alone in the castle.
Potter gasped once again from beside Draco, and snatched the book out of his hands.
“It seems like it, yes.”
your way out?”
He could worry about everyone else later. He would worry about Theo later. He would worry about the sounds that definitely had come from Slughorn’s classroom later. He would worry about the vial of deadly Bloodroot potion, that he had yet to return and was clanking around in his robes pocket, later.
“I honestly don’t know. It’s just another thing to worry about, really.”
Everyone in the room had turned to look at Draco, who was sitting by himself at an empty table. He felt really small and pathetic at the moment.
As much as he hated Theo, he wouldn’t want him to go through the same exact thing Draco had gone through with the Dark Lord.
A noise coming from the direction of Slughorn’s room startled him, and he immediately had to calm his breathing.
“I think we both know what really happened.”
And just like that, the world seemed to shift right back into place.
his hair was. Draco may have pulled a little too hard, though, as Harry let out a low moan. Draco laughed into Harry’s mouth, but that just made Harry kiss him deeper, something he hadn’t even known was possible.
“Give me one minute, though. Please,” Draco said, wanting to talk to Harry before he entered a duel that would probably lead to Harry getting killed.
Even though earlier Draco had wanted to solve everything alone, after the trip to Hogsmeade, a part of him realized he wouldn’t be able to. He did need Potter. As much as he hated to admit it. He was also pretty sure Potter needed him.
hasn’t gotten word of the real reason why the two of you broke up, seeming as every other aspect of your love life and beyond is out there for the world to read.”
During his first week back, he also started working up the courage to apologize to some of his peers, like Granger and Weasley. More progress.
“And while we’re here, I would like to discuss with you some good news.”
Later that night, when the castle was asleep, before the two headed for the Room of Requirement, he and Harry headed for the Garden. Their Garden.
remember how Draco openly said terrible things about what the former headmaster believed in and supported, and of course how Draco had almost fucking murdered him, right?
“True. But, there’s something else.” Harry glanced around the room, obviously scared someone was going to walk through the entrance to the Garden of Mystics any second. The idiot. “I was almost sorted into Slytherin. I asked the hat to put me in any house other than Slytherin.”
Draco could barely watch, and he felt the need to vomit. It wasn’t even until Harry’s finger was brushing his cheek that he realized he’d been silently crying. Harry brushed away the tears, and reassuringly smiled at him.
Draco straightened out his robes- he had put on a Muggle outfit that morning, but grabbed his Slytherin robe to wear on top, since he was cold. It had been the first piece of attire he could find. “You’re going to have to be a little more specific, Harry. A lot of weird events have happened over the past weeks.” Draco pocketed the vial of Restorative Potion he had left on Slughorn’s desk, and walked to the door, gesturing for Harry to follow him out.
Drys and Alec were taken outside the house after that and then whisked away, the other Death Eaters Apparating away from the house. But, before they all left, some stayed behind to light the place on fire, also using curses to break the windows and other valuables.
Harry shrugged. “It's fine. Really. I actually slept really well last night.”
Draco looked down at his hands. “You don’t know what I’ve done.” She didn’t know he was a murderer. She didn’t know he had killed his own father.
He didn’t feel the need to become numb anymore, as his mood was gradually getting better, and his fears for what was to come slipped away piece by piece, but he enjoyed lying in the snow next to Harry. He oddly, really, really, enjoyed it.
Could someone have kidnapped him while he was sleeping? How could someone have known to look for them in the Room of Requirement? How could they have gotten in without knowing what room they were using? That left him with only one other guess. Harry had voluntarily left the Room of Requirement.
Draco wanted to yell at Alec to go fuck himself, but saying that basically meant he accepted defeat. He thought about throwing his own curse at Alec, when he’d be least expecting it, but Draco literally
Of course, Harry had been down right
Whenever Draco moved his legs or hips just the slightest bit, Harry would bite down hard on Draco’s lip. He replicated Harry and carded his fingers through Harry’s hair and tugged on it, making him bite on Draco’s lip
But his attention was already somewhere else as he heard a loud banging, the door to the Hospital Wing crashing open and hitting the wall.
“What?” Draco was looking in the direction where Potter’s attention was grabbed, and saw nothing of interest. “Potter, what is it?”
The next couple parts came in fragments: the Aurors saying that Draco was free to go, and that they lifted all possible charges, McGonagall saying comforting words because she wished he’d never had to have gone through that, and lastly, Narcissa turning away from Draco, her body heaving up and down, as the Aurors explained that all of the Death Eaters were dead. His father was dead.
looked at his reflection. All of his scars were showing, and his overall appearance wasn’t that great.
Pansy moved out of the way, but Draco wished she hadn’t. Pansy’s presence always somehow made him feel more confident.
. He wasn’t even sure he’d be allowed to step foot into the place. He finally looked up at Pansy.
She sighed and went back to reading her issue of the
Sighing, Draco made his way over to Harry, who was across the library and staring brightly at a battered book in his hand.
“You sacrificed your life for me, Draco. And the only difference with your situation than with my mum’s, was that when I was a baby, I didn’t really know my mum. I couldn’t love her the way people love each other when they’re older and understand emotions. The mixture of your sacrifice, and…” Harry trailed off, pointedly not looking at Draco and blushing ferociously.
Potter crossed his own arms over his chest. “Well, I’m sorry but I can’t. At least for now. Something has happened and you're the only other person around.”
Potter focused on Draco and blinked.
. It was actually fucking writhing on his forearm, just like it had done when The Dark Lord was alive. He blinked a couple times. He was definitely imagining it. But when he stared at it, long and hard, he was starting to actually believe it
Apparently, standing up straight had seemed impossible, but running came easy to him.
Harry nodded. “So, uhm, does
Draco was now forty, and he wasn’t married, didn’t have any kids, hadn’t done anything useful or exciting in his life. He worked at a library. That pretty much summed up how interesting his life got.
“Looking much better, young man,” Pomfrey said, “I’d say you just need some more rest and a couple of healing potions in your system, and you’ll be good to go.”
Draco pressed on. “But you know what I think, Drys made it so that if he died, the Death Eater’s would die alongside him on purpose. It was definitely something he could have avoided if he wanted to. He knew that if he couldn’t succeed in bringing down the Purebloods, he could at least rid the world of all the Death Eaters. That included me. Take care of one evil beyond the grave.”
After all those weeks of Draco ignoring Harry, ignoring their much needed talk, everything was set into place finally. He couldn’t help but relish at how free he felt; and Harry wasn’t even mad at him. They were genuine
Draco didn’t know how group therapy sessions benefit him at all. He should’ve gotten a pass on the whole thing at the beginning of the year when it started. It was not like he would ever willingly speak up to share his feelings. His classmates would probably shoot him daggers with their eyes if he did. He knew they thought he shouldn’t get to feel remorse when there were others more deserving of it. Draco honestly agreed with them.
Harry didn’t have to finish the sentence. Draco knew exactly what he was trying to say.
It was definitely a good kind of different; odd, weird, slightly embarrassing, but good.
“At least not yet anyway.”
“Are you and Potter-”
Snape’s mystical book sat at the foot of the Gryffindor bed, along with his wand, necklace, and photograph. He grabbed three of the items and stuffed them deep into the pocket of his robe, and hooked the chain clumsily around his neck, not bothering to tuck the gem under his shirt.
He’d gotten kind of used to the faint hum of the Mark over the past week, which was it’s usual state. However, like right now, the Mark burned so painfully Draco was almost always thrust into flashbacks of when he lived with the Dark Lord. Not something he wanted to recount.
Potter stood back up again, the rock still in his hand, and threw it outside of the ward.
He couldn’t back out of admitting to Harry the truth this time. The truth always came out one way or another. It was a statement Draco had forgotten throughout his entire time of lying to Harry, rather unfortunately.
Draco hated being pitied.
All he really wanted to do was go to the library and start researching. He now had a place to start and he was determined to work it out on his own.
“Alec, it’s not your turn. Please go on, Pansy.”
“How-” Draco caught his breath- “How are you able to do that? Send me into memories and- and different scenarios.”
. Snape was lying. That’s it. He didn’t tell us everything-”
“Just a question!” She continued to smirk.
“What was that?”
Draco knew what night he meant. Stars. Snow. Photographs. Flowers. Necklace. Kissing…
, for Merlin’s sake?
Madame Pomfrey looked like she was going to say something else, but the door to the Hospital Wing flew open, and in walked Professor McGonagall, which made Pomfrey turn towards the sound. Pomfrey swiftly left Draco’s bedside to talk to McGonagall.
“I used to, though,” Draco added softly. “Harm my forearm, that is. But I haven’t in a really long while.”
, but the name of Harry’s capturer wasn’t exactly important.
Draco stood his ground, trying not to come across absolutely furious at Drys. Drys had put so much thought and work into wanting to control the Death Eaters and and kill the Purebloods, wanting them to feel the despair and hopelessness as they watched the Muggle-borns rise to the top. To Draco, it just seemed easier to grieve Olive, instead of concocting a whole evil plan to take over the world.
I would just like to say thank you so so soooo much to everyone who reads, bookmarks, comments, and leaves kudos on this story. I can't even use words to describe how grateful I am <3
They continued to sit in each other’s company, Draco counting the stars while thinking about how Harry had picked up a Latin book and memorized a phrase… to impress him? Maybe? He could have been reading into the whole thing too much, and Harry could have picked up the book just because he was bored, but even though Harry was pretty dense, he had a beautiful, complex mind, and maybe
“We don’t know that for sure. They could all very much be up and awake and have no fucking clue as to what’s going on here. I don’t want to take any chances. If someone put up that ward around Hogwarts and Hogsmeade that doesn’t let anything through, they’re probably trying to keep us from contacting anyone. We discussed this, remember?”
Everyone else was standing in the room, too shocked to do anything. Even Blaise looked surprised at his action.
“No, don’t worry you haven’t. Did you really get yourself stuck in a closet?” She smirked.
Why would Potter grow to care for him after everything Draco had done? He didn’t think it was possible for someone to forgive so many wrongs, and Draco didn’t expect to be forgiven for all those wrongs either.
“CAN YOU PLEASE STOP?!” Draco broke even more, screaming the words and creating more discomfort in his throat. “Please. Can you please just… stop.”
struck, was strong enough to keep Draco alive. A sort of reversal on what happened the night Harry’s parents died; on what Lily Potter did to keep her boy safe.
that we attempted to fix! You sounded so sure of yourself when you told me how this book works! And- and it failed us!” What Draco meant to say was,
He couldn’t get Harry’s words to stop repeating over and over in his head. It was exhausting and painful and had Harry been going to kiss him? Had Draco been a coward once again and backed out of it? Or was it just his imagination?
Potter gave him a pointed look that said,
Yeah, I also don't know how I wrote 10k words of conversation, but hey, life's a mystery.
Harry shook his head slightly. “No it’s not that. I-”
His Slytherin robe hung on his bedpost, staring at Draco. He found he
“As in, you want
She turned her head, dropping something from her arms. “Yes, dear?”
Harry lifted an eyebrow. “Why would I be kidding. You don’t want to talk to me! What did I do wrong?”
He sighed in relief, and wrapped his arms around Harry a little tighter. “You wanna know a terrible little secret of mine?” He mumbled into Harry’s neck.
What if it didn’t even work? For all they knew, Snape really could have been lying, or the book could have lost its magic after sitting in some secret compartment for decades. Draco might reveal something extremely personal, and it could end up he told his secret for nothing.
“That I did.”
Draco had taken that lesson to heart. It’s what made him seem powerful to his acquaintances. It’s what got him friends. He liked to think he was brave when he was younger. He knew however, he had shown weakness
way. “Draco, Draco it’s been Alec. Alec’s the one-” Harry said, but shortly broke into a coughing fit.
He leaned in even closer so that he was almost on top of Harry, but was really only curled into his left side, and kissed Harry’s cheek. Draco then kissed his nose, chin, forehead, and was about to kiss his mouth when Harry tugged a little on his hair. Draco was brought back to reality, and it was hard to remember how they went from casually talking to one another, to kissing and cuddling.
There were many flaws to the plan, Draco knew. If the Restorative Potion somehow killed Theo, and people found his dead body, realizing he was the only person in the school who had gotten killed, they would probably point fingers at Draco. They could also run diagnostic tests on Theo’s body, which Draco was sure would show he had some type of poison in his system. Once again, everything was likely to be traced back to Draco. One reassuring thought, though: he had Harry Potter on his side this time, and he
Draco would never have any scars remotely alike to that.
Well, it was horrible if you counted going behind someone else’s back sickening; someone you specifically told you wouldn’t keep secrets from.
done, was good. Every single step of the way, he’d known deep down that what he was doing was
He knew he could always count on Pansy, especially this past year. And he
Draco was almost just as in shock as Narcissa was, seeing his mother for the first time since Summer. Since he had left for his eighth year at Hogwarts. They never really wrote to each other- well, on the occasion that Narcissa did write, Draco never wrote back. He always knew that was the reason Narcissa stopped sending letters.
Draco gave a small gasp. “Is he here? My father?”
Draco furrowed his eyebrows. “That’s fine… did you leave something in there?”
Potter seemed startled at coming face to face with Draco as he stepped farther into the room, closing the door behind him. He was still in his pyjamas, and his hair was more messy than usual. His cheeks were flushed and he was shivering a bit.
“It’s just, two weeks ago, hell probably even a week ago, you wouldn’t have cared about what I think,” Harry stated, falling into place besides Draco.
“Okay, now say that again, but slower, this time.”
“Yes,” Draco said.
“I saw u torture Rowle.” Harry’s voice was small and unsure, but Draco heard him clearly nonetheless, and his stomach twisted at the mention of a moment he would rather forget. “I saw you using the Cruciatus on him, and-”
Drys, his values and plans, the exact opposite of the Dark Lord’s, and yet so similar. Wanting to rid the world of Purebloods forever, starting with the death of the ones inside Hogwarts; the Death Eaters, who were mostly Pureblood, getting to watch their own kind die by their own hands.
“Absolutely,” Harry said.
“Hi, Malfoy. Er- how are you doing?”
“I understand. Don’t worry, he’ll be safe here with me. I’ll keep an eye on him. Now, goodnight, Miss Granger.”
He found his way back to where Potter had said to meet, and Potter was already there, sitting on the bottom step once again. He was fidgeting with his robes, and breathing sharply. When he finally noticed Draco’s company, he stopped his nervous movements, trying very poorly to hide his tense composure.
“Yes. Sorry, I accidentally knocked something over. I can clean it up though,” Potter said as he took out his wand. He cast a spell under his breath that Draco couldn’t make out, and the mess on the floor vanished.
Draco wasn’t going to ask Potter about his nightmare. He knew Potter would have asked Draco had the situation been switched, but Draco wasn’t the type of person to ask such personal questions that would lead to heartfelt and emotional answers. Potter definitely was that type of person.
Two outcomes awaited Draco. On one hand, Theo would awaken from the sleeping curse once the Restorative Potion made its way into his system, and the first person Draco would come face to face with after two weeks of only being around Harry, would be the person who hated his guts, and probably had taken a blade to his Dark Mark just for the fun of it. But, he’d know the potion had worked, and Draco could save everyone.
, which he already said in front of the Great Hall.
Draco lifted his eyebrows at that. “Good news?”
It was a nice thought to have, but it would definitely not come true. Plus, they all probably wanted to use the bathroom before going to sleep, so they would have to wait up for Draco to be done.
Everything started to get really foggy, and Draco could hear hushed voices coming from somewhere.
“My people,” Draco stated.
Then there was the duel, and the whirring sensation as he was sent into past memories, and events that were only a mere figment of the future.
Harry hadn’t been going to kiss him, but he
familiar voice, causing Draco to look up from his shoes.
Draco had been wondering and fearing who it could possibly be for the last two weeks, and especially today, as it was the day the Figure had said he would basically infiltrate Hogwarts.
“No you’re not!”
Drys was still not nearly as frightening as the Dark Lord, but somehow learning that the man in the hooded cloak was Alec’s father all along, made everything a bit more real.
“I’m sure it does look good in my hair. Though, I doubt it enhances my appearance, because my looks are already naturally enhanced.”
Draco wished their walk to McGonagall’s office would hurry the fuck up. He could feel the students’ curious glances as they passed. And, of course, he didn’t want to talk to Pansy about Harry. At the moment, he didn’t even want to
Drys was about to flourish his wand, and Draco’s first thought was that he was going to kill him right there, but he knew Drys wanted Draco alive too much to kill him. “A little less eager now, are you?” Draco said.
Draco scrubbed a hand through his hair in irritation. “Fucking fantastic,” he murmured.
He was then standing next to Drys at the Ministry while the Minister questioned whether or not they had been the ones to kill the Purebloods who’d resided in Hogwarts. Drys put the Minister under the Imperius curse, and they weren’t questioned again.
Draco didn’t stop walking but felt like he needed to, since the surprise that Potter was actually
Draco stood in the center of it all, watching in disbelief as the house became destroyed, turning into the exact version of the one from his visions.
Draco honestly didn’t know what to say. He had not expected that the reason behind Potter’s friendship with Kaspian was based on something so deep and personal. He also didn’t expect Potter to apologize
He heard a couple more voices and noises, lots of shuffling around, and then he felt a cool substance flowing down his throat.
The next chapter is going to be way more eventful and something substantial is going to happen, I'm so freaking excited to write it. Not a kiss yet. They still have to get to know each other better and stuff. But we're working towards that I promise :)
“Draco. Draco look at me. Look at me.” So he did. Draco concentrated on looking into Harry’s eyes, and Harry stared back. Harry was full of concern and sorrow, and Draco wondered what he looked like when Harry gazed at him.
Harry found him instantly and sat down beside him on the bench. They didn’t talk for a minute or so, and Draco didn’t mind that. He liked having Harry beside him, the two of them gazing at the night sky and the London lights.
They hadn’t moved since forever, only picking up their wands to recast warming charms once in a while.
There was a noise coming from outside. It startled him
There were obviously lots of people who loathed him, and wished him dead- people he did not know at all- but Draco really had been expecting that the Figure would have
“So, is there some sort of protective charm on it?” Draco asked, resting his chin on Harry’s shoulder while peering at the journal.
Harry snorted, which made Draco blush. “Yeah of course.” The song immediately started playing again, and Harry started to dance, beginning with slow arm and head movements moving to the beat. As the song progressed, Draco realized he’d been staring at Harry the entire time, standing still and doing nothing but blush and blush and
“Oh, wow okay I did not expect you to comply so easily. Well, er- I’m sorry about that. I guess I’ll just leave you then.” Draco heard Potter walk away from the door, and he was so relieved Potter had just
Sorry I'm posting a lot later than usual, writer's block got the best of me this chapter, but nonetheless, I present to you the latest chapter of Finding Sophrosyne :) Hope you enjoy
Today was Draco Malfoy’s birthday; her best friend. Sure, he was a prick, but she loved him anyway. They’d been friends for about thirty five years now, and if that number didn’t show dedication, she didn’t know what would.
“Yes and no. My mind kept telling me that there was
They had spent the rest of their day in the library searching through books, much like their previous days, except that time they were looking for a different type of counter-spell. After they had tried countless charms on Snape’s book, and the wretched thing had deflected each of them, they had moved on to spilling secrets again. They took turns saying anything that came to their mind. After a while, Potter’s secrets got a bit more deep, and Draco’s stayed at the same level of a tiny fib.
“Harry! So glad you could join us. Pick a partner and have them explain to you what you missed.”
Through all his weak moments during the Curse, he still had plenty of moments where he felt like he’d owned the castle. Draco had felt better knowing that there was no one else save for Harry Potter to judge him or look at him.
Draco had been forced to join in that attack, since his father had led it. He’d been under strict instructions to hang back and watch as the experienced Death Eaters did what had to be done. Snape had been the one to explain everything in detail, and Rookwood had stayed back with the two of them to make sure they weren’t planning on doing anything stupid.
. And, to his horrible realization, thoughts that he’d probably grown accustomed to thinking for years and years and years. Ugh.
All Harry had to say after Draco finished his incredibly long clarification of the past weeks, was; “You could have just told me.”
But saying sorry was better than saying nothing. “I- I’m so sorry,” Draco said, and he really meant it. “I was a fool for siding with
He heard Harry’s stream of cussing as Draco’s hand- that wasn’t wrapped tightly around the book- hit the doorway, but that wasn’t going to stop him. He kept on running down the corridor, listening to the sounds of his feet hitting the floor echo off the walls. He heard a second sound, Harry running, coming from behind him, which only motivated him to run faster.
“Snape,” Draco said unsurely.
They found quite a lot of spells worth learning, such as
He stuffed the fake book back inside his pocket, and took one last look at Snape and Dumbledore, before setting off to go find his true love.
“Night, Draco,” Pansy said over a yawn. She then proceeded to stumble towards the Slytherin girls dormitories.
Merlin, he was adorable.
He realized he had spent the last minute staring at Potter, and Potter staring right back.
gagged.
and quickly gave it to Blaise instead.
Pansy seemed to be contemplating what she would say next. She was probably going to sit there and argue with him.
have sent a letter for help to the Ministry. If he had, instead of sending a letter to Lucius, Draco wouldn’t have to make an impossible decision.
“Is Harry still bothering you?” Pansy said at lunch on Monday, the second Monday he’d been back to attending classes; after he had eaten dinner with Harry in the kitchen, had almost kissed him.
The two of them ripped apart from one another at light speed. Luckily, they had not gone far with what they had planned on doing. Although, the damage was certainly done. There was no way Pansy had missed seeing their close proximity.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry promptly shut him up by pressing him up against the bookshelf, slotting his leg in between Draco’s, and slipping his tongue into Draco’s mouth. He couldn’t help but let out several gasps all the while, and he could feel Harry smiling smugly against his lips, the bastard.
He decided since he had already told Potter about his first vision, it wouldn’t do him any harm by telling him about the one he had just had. “I had this vision? It was weird. Remember how I told you about my dream that I had where I was in a weird room and there was this hooded figure who told me, ‘two weeks’?” Potter nodded his head carefully. “Well, I had the same dream just now. Except I’m pretty sure it was some sort of message. Not really a dream at all. It was all the same, but this time the figure in the room said my
“Finally,” Weasley muttered under his breath. Granger elbowed him in the stomach, and Pansy, still standing to the side of Draco’s bed, shot him a deadly glare.
It was weird the first couple of days. Blaise had just decided he was allowed to sit with Draco and Pansy whenever and wherever. Draco felt like he was intruding on his and Pansy’s privacy. But, he quickly realized that Blaise was genuinely a nice guy. He said he had wanted to befriend Draco a lot earlier, but that Theo hadn’t let him. Draco should have been angry at that, but he understood all too familiarly; being pressured by others.
- “It is almost nine o’clock, and Mr. Malfoy needs rest.” If he needed rest so badly, why did she let McGonagall talk to him? “Leave now.”
Maybe they were more alike than Draco had originally thought.
Before, all he had to worry about were curses and hexes directed at
He looked to his side, acknowledging Harry’s presence next to him. He must have given off a worried look- or maybe his whole aura was filled with anxiety- because Harry lifted his hand to rest on Draco’s shoulder, giving him a reassuring squeeze.
get to class. I know you hate Wynn, as do I, for a completely different reason, but if you show up late with me, and explain to him that I had a little complication, I won’t get in trouble. He'll listen to anything you say.”
I had to ask - we both knew it, then and now.
Uncaring as to his robes or knees, he knelt hurriedly at the teen's side lifting cloth to find the source of the bleeding - never thinking it could be the same infirmity which once afflicted him.
I often wonder what Potter might have thought had he awoken then, to see us like that: a weary professor holding his troubled godson.  How differently might things have gone?
Without meaning to, I fled to an old haunt of mine: a long-disused classroom tucked away in a tangle of corridors so dark and mysterious that most
And if I squinted, that famous scar.
I wasn't too frazzled, nor concerned. The hour was later than I realised so I presumed nightmares or some such disruption when I rose to allow entry.
"Whatever." Draco muttered, knowing how I hated such language. I knew better than to be thrown off by his deliberate use of it, he was unsettled.
'Trust me' - two powerful words that we weren't quite ready for, either of us. But I had said them, and I couldn't have taken them back even if I wanted to.
He reached almost without meaning to, an old haunt of his: a long-disused classroom tucked away in a mess of shadowy corridors that most (even armed with Lumos) never dared to explore. As he approached the cleverly hidden door, he noticed it was ajar and a dusty breeze shifted across his pale skin as he walked up to the darkened wood. Alarmed - although he would never admit it aloud - and annoyingly curious, Draco breathed a silent huff of frustration and drew his wand. He placed his hand upon the solid heavy door and quietly eased it open, slipping softly through the crack he made into the even-darker room beyond. His eyes squinted to see anything as the dust and shadows weaved their perplexing dance in front of his eyes, the only light was pale and dim, seeping in from the deep porthole window of the lake at the far end of the room. As he rounded the last of the abandoned desks and broken chairs, he noticed something tantalisingly colourful in the seemingly grayscaled chamber; then his brain filled in the rest of what his eyes were seeing unblinkingly.
It was red. It shouldn't have been surprising, red was the most common colour here besides the grays and blacks - most brought himself.
I'd been on the other side of this, but honestly this was worse.
I don't know what I thought I'd find there - but I know I hoped I wouldn't see exactly what I did.
"Draco, use your head." I snapped quietly. "This can't get out. It must remain a secret, think of what would happen!"
That someone else being Harry Potter, in case I had forgotten for one short second.
I watched Draco study Harry while he slept on, the gentle rise and fall of his chest immensely comforting to me for some reason. I have since watched the boy sleep on many occasions and only a few times come close to that sense of soul-wrenching relief every time my eyes registered another intake of breath.
Of course, when that conversation came I knew exactly why I was terrified...
"I suspect I will need some aid in sleeping soundly tonight." I admitted after a moment's consideration. Draco relaxed his anxious grip on his elbows and allowed his arms to hang loosely at his sides again, drooping like an unwatered flower with that strange dark relief I know only too well. "There's no shame in it." I told him as he plonked himself on the arm of the sofa where Harry lay.
"You are no more his enemy than Punch is to Judy." I answered. "Tell me, which of the Lions have suffered such an ailment that they could possibly relate or aid in his recovery?"
It breaks my heart all over again when I remember that I told him I didn't think he wanted to. To fight, or to live.
We were going to help him, I think we both knew that immediately - even Harry, although it took some explaining to work out logistics, seemed to see that despite everything that had happened prior, things were different. Everything had changed, we would help him.
I swear to you I didn't hear wedding bells or any such nonsense.
As I rounded the last line, I remember a spark of tantalisingly colour caught the corner of my eye - stark and bright in the seemingly grayscaled chamber... Then my brain realised what my eyes were seeing unblinkingly.
My shock was cold as a knife when I saw my godson with Harry Potter unconcious in his arms. Of all the things I had been ready for, and I kept myself ready for practically everything in those days, that sight was a complete surprise - and not the nice kind.
"Just go back to sleep, Harry. We can talk more later."
Draco was still frowning, he would never agree with me on such policies and once upon a time I would have agreed with him - but I am a teacher and have responsibilities, sometimes they seem harder than my duties for the Order or for He Who Must Not Be Named. But only sometimes...
Quickly dismissing my godson's attempts at explaining, there would be time for that later - and believe me, I had a
I fetched some potions, probably blood-replenisher given the situation and maybe a wound-cleaning one but that's my healer training since telling me that not my own memories of that night.
I had any doubts - when he immediately got to work no questions asked; in fact more than that, he cut me off when I tried to explain. I remember feeling quite indignant about that, but of course that's rather silly of me. I hope he doesn't read this, I'll get lectured for a month...
"Oh Harry, what have you got yourself into this time?" he asked the unconscious Gryffindor lying almost in his lap. Then he set about putting pressure on the wounds, briefly checking the other wrist and upon noting the same slashes there too included it in his ministrations. Doing all that he could with limited knowledge only acquired in self-exposure, Draco crudely stabilised the Boy-Who-Lived then cast a levitation charm and floated the other boy out of the classroom. As quickly as he dared (with a such a basic and concentration-based charm as 'Wingardium Leviosa) in the interests of both Potter's and his own continued survival - should a Death Eater's child catch him saving the 'enemy's' life - Draco swiftly crossed the short stretch of hazy passages to his head of house's office and quarters.
But I meant what I said, both that the Gryffindors would be of more use to Harry and that I would try to befriend him anyway.
The bit that was coming next would be horrible, I knew.
Eventually Uncle Sev sent me back to my dorm, the hour so late it was practically early and although tomorrow was Saturday I did have piles of homework to be completed.
It probably had pushed some still-quite-raw nerves in me, but mostly I was still too much in shock and processing it all; the late hours spent with the feel of fresh blood on my skin and the acrid smell in my nose would come later, I did know that and of course I was right - lucky me.
In truth, I was just scared.
Just a vague sense of pride and a strange weight, like determination or resolve, settled over me.
"Because I was where you are." I told him, looking him in the eye and daring him to look away. "Literally. I stood right there and asked the exact same questions of Uncle Sev: why are you here, why are you helping me, why can't you just leave me to slowly kill myself?" He looked shocked but I carried on relentlessly. "And I had to do it alone, I am trying to do this alone." I exhaled forcefully.
I think it was the third time someone cried 'praise the Dark Lord' that made me leave.
There was red, bright scarlet that caught the eye and practically screamed for his attention, but there was also a dark red accompanied by a gold that together just as loudly said 'Gryffindor.'
"So? He still cares. Besides, he has the most experience with these things, unfortunately." I didn't want to disclose that about Uncle Sev, but I thought it would shut him up long enough for me to get away. I was wrong, after all, I didn't know him very well then.
Who he was didn't stop him bleeding, but it did change how I was supposed to react - except it didn't, but I hadn't realised that yet.
However it was not these colours, no matter how dazzling in the greys of the moon-lit classroom; that had Draco stood there, wand drooping at his side and his mouth agape. It was the splash of unruly black hair atop a worryingly white face, framed by a pair of round heavy glasses which immediately identified this body as Potter. Harry Potter. Harry...
"I often have tea with my godfather in the evenings, it helps us both unwind from the day."
I remember opening my mouth to speak, but no words came out - they seemed terribly complicated right then.
I pondered what little information Draco had offered me, Harry's prescence in the dungeon's oldest classrooms was concerning - it represented a knowledge and subsequent pattern of behaviour that made an uncomfortable lump rise in my throat.
Draco said nothing, forcing me to prompt him once more - he really should have known by then that I required a proper answer.
I knocked and then opened the door onto a million memories, barely faded in the months since I had last had cause to enter this tidy little side bedroom in Snape's quarters. I gazed around space and decided that it was both good and bad to see someone else inhabiting it - good that I confidently no longer had need of it but also so incredibly sad that someone else did.
"Uncle Sev!" his whispered urgently, eyes and mind frantically scanning the hallways around him for movement. "Let me in! Quick!" he pounded on the door once again.
Sev has told me many times that I did the right thing and that in the end, Harry was alright.
The moment I think Harry wants me to start from is the instant at which Draco pounded on my door one late autumn evening at Hogwarts.
I think I dwelled on his name far too long. I told myself it was important as often as I told myself it didn't mean anything.
Besides, this isn't supposed to be about what he remembers.
Anyway, when Sev asked if this was triggering me I hadn't even stopped to consider that it would at that point.
My gaze drifted the the expanse of bare pale skin exposed by the removal of his shirt; beyond the bandages' edges, scars of varying ages were lit almost artistically by the firelight.
I placed my hand on his shoulder.
"Does it for you?" Was his counter and I frowned, I owed him a truthful answer but was not happy about it.
So when he dragged up one blood-soaked sleeve he was not expecting to find two ragged deep cuts piercing skin and blood vessels alike.
Anxiously, he knocked on the sturdy door with one fist, his wand still tightly clutched in the other with earnest concentration.
Harry! Harry bleeding; bleeding far too much and far too pale for Draco's liking. He had to do something, and quick.
I might have panicked, for seconds longer than I should.
Wonders will never cease.
"I meant this evening." He elaborated in a small voice.
I nearly bottled it, I suspected that wouldn't be a pleasant 'conversation' to bear witness to.
I have to admit I was surprised when Sev admitted it had triggered him.
"Because he's a good person? Because he owes your mum a debt? Because it's his job, to safeguard the students in his care?" I don't know who I was asking, me or him, because I certainly didn't know the answer to his question - I could only guess.
Please note I have changed some of this opening.
"Is this... disturbing you?"
"And what about you?" Yes, that's what he asked me! He always was smarter than he looked, I just don't like admitting it.
"No!" Draco answered, a little defensively to truly reassure me. "I'm almost a year and a half clean - why would I relapse now?"
When I arrived, knocking a smidge less frantically than I had less than 24 hours previous, I found the table laid with a tea tray and even accessorised with fresh scones! With less words than I was happy about, Sev told me to 'fetch' our patient for tea.
Draco crept out of the Slytherin common room and into the dungeons gloomy maze of corridors, he simply HAD to get away from all the Dark Lord
Understandably I was startled, and put the pieces together pretty quickly - I am proud to say.
I remember looking into his eyes, squaring my jaw and locking my shoulders: trying to appear strong. I have never asked him if it worked.
"Why is he helping me?" The Gryffindor only jerked his head in the general direction of Sev - don't worry, he got out of that habit quicker than you can say 'Hogwarts'.
As I remember it, the image blurs - I don't know if that's from time or tears, but I suppose it doesn't really matter?
When his colour slowly began to improve, his pulse and breathing had steadied and strengthened, I summoned my tea and took a deep breath, sitting back to look at the other student present.
As his gaze locked onto the bundle of blood-stained robes and messy hair that Draco still levitated in the dark corridor, the harsh words that had been brimming on the Slytherin teacher's lips faded and his expression morphed into one of shock.
"Why are you here?" His words were clipped, fear undercutting them although neither of us ever ackowledged it.
There was a pause I think but it passes in a blur in my memory.
There was a group of older Slytherins gathered in a dorm room just down from the study where I was slaving over some homework, DADA probably as I was struggling to concentrate.
Outside in the shadowed corridors, I just started walking - I don't think I was conciously going anyway except away, but something had other ideas.
