Harry ignored him, and stumbled to the group of healers struggling with someone a little bit away. He saw the blond hair tainted by dirt, and immediately knew.
"Harry..." Hermione looked at him with something that bordered pity and concern, "You know I'm not allowed to tell you... patient confidentiality and all that"
"Hey... hey it's going to be okay." he brushed Draco's hair out of his eyes, and grabbed his hand, "Just take some deep breaths okay?"
Minister of Magic" Hermione appeared as well, and slapped Ron's shoulder. She then noticed Kingsley, "Not that that's a bad thing by any means! Just that if we're to have any sort of democracy established it should be made clear that an election is going to--"
He had been hit by a spell he never had heard before and Harry had immediately called for backup. The wizards responsible had fled the scene, and the backup had arrived almost immediately after.
Harry watched the people laughing and dancing and drinking, and couldn't help but wonder how everyone else was able to move on so quickly when he was still stuck in the past. It was the first anniversary of the war, and the wizarding world had been steadily recovering from the war. Hogwarts didn't show a trace of the war-- save for the tributes in honor of those lost-- and everyone seemed to be recovering together. All funds from the gala would be donated to the "Children of the War Fund" that was set up by Hermione to help young kids who lost parents or family in the war.
"oh yeah?" i say, i bend down to kiss him. "prove it." It's a playful challenge, but Cedric can never turn a challenge down.
we had just got married, it was the happiest day in my life, at first my parents and draco's didn't like the idea of us together but the contract was annulled of all power so soon they warmed up to it
we went and asked the house elves to put some up around the castle politely even though they didn't have to as they weren't tied down to hogwarts and the students in it they did.
i hated how many people are here, i feel like the walls are closing in and i'm being washed away in a sea of people who don't even care about me just my social status and financial situation.
I'm about to head upstairs when I hear the sound of voices coming from the garden. Our garden is rather small — the price of living in London. We have a small table and chairs on the patio for when we entertain our friends during the summer.
I can hear warning bells in my head; something about that name seems familiar. I drum my fingers on the table as I try to place it.
Cedric stifles a laugh against my chest. 'I forgot about license day, good luck.' He offers me a playful smirk but moves lower.
'mhm, because they're going to fire us', i sit up on my elbows and pull his shirt off of him. "i'm sure that they can spare us for a few hours."
"Your relationship with him depends on me not telling him our little secret' he pauses, 'so yes, I do own you right now."
From there, the grandfather clock in my office never seems to move. The day drags by and it feels like I'm trapped in an hourglass that is slowly filling with sand and with no way out.
I drag my feet out of the hospital slowly. The idea of going home and facing Cedric chills me to my core. I know one thing - there is no way I am telling him what happened at the bar. Nope. The baby has to be Cedric's, it just has to.
Once I've greeted him I cant take this any longer, I lead him over to the living room, the test results firmly held next to my side. once we've sat I turn to face him, giving him the first sight of the white envelope before saying.
'hm,' he says but takes out his notes anyway,'just sit on the bed and we'll see how it goes.' no, i want to say, but I do as I'm told always to one to avoid social confrontations when unnecessary. Klein takes a couple of tests and asks me a couple of questions.
Already there are lines of impatient bar owners with documents crushed up in their hands. I offer apologetic waves to my team before slipping into my office.
Right, the Doctor. Keeping secrets has never been so stressful. I've convinced Cedric to meet me at the hospital. The idea of having him anywhere near the office where someone could innocently ask him how the visit went yesterday chills me to the core.
Kissing over my stomach (a lot of kisses there, warming my heart), he comes to stop teasingly at my crotch. I let out a low whine and Cedric nips at my thighs in response. My legs fall open and Cedric settles between them with ease and before I know i lose all track of my thoughts.
Potter's hands slide from Draco's shoulders forward to his collarbone. In one swift motion, Potter undoes the golden cloak clasps that pin Draco's cloak on either side of his shoulders. The clasps are engraved with the Malfoy coat of arms, and once undone, Draco’s cloak falls to the floor in a whisper of fabric that pools at their feet. It's considerably cooler once he's freed of the heavy cloak, and Draco's eyes fly open at the sudden change in temperature.
It’s all so very complicated. Earlier, they’d laughed about the girls, about the underlying implications. He feels like a hypocrite now because that’s exactly what this is about. His father had always stated clearly what his expectations were, how a Malfoy has to behave and live his life.
Suddenly, a gentle breeze of magic blows over Draco’s body, leaving them both completely naked and making the hairs on his arm stand on end. For a moment, Harry lies on top of him, pressing their bodies together, skin meeting skin. The moans that threaten to escape Draco’s mouth as Harry begins to roll his hips, sliding their cocks together, are all swallowed by Harry’s kisses.
Ginny’s retort is already on her tongue, but then the Floo glows green and both Ginny and Draco look wide-eyed at each other.
When he finally speaks, Potter’s voice is low. “I’ve never been good at these sorts of things. Draco I— Fuck—” He ruffles his hair even more, trying to find the words. “What I’m trying to say is, I like you, okay?”
If Draco had to guess it’s not so much about him not telling her, but more about Harry possibly telling Hermione — because he can’t shut up sometimes — who then told Pansy.
When Draco enters Harry’s bedroom, a room he’s only slept in so far, nothing else, the sight greeting him is not a bad one. Harry is standing there in his underwear and his dress shirt still mostly open.
To his surprise, Potter gets up and cups Draco’s face tenderly, before he captures Draco’s mouth in a heated, though excruciatingly slow kiss. He mouths a trail of kisses all the way to Draco’s ear, sucking on the lobe. “Do it,” he whispers.
Draco would rage and shout in his house, and Harry would endure it and hold him tight when he was done. His boyfriend would cry and blame himself for her death. Maybe if he’d been more careful, paid more attention to his surroundings instead of flirting with Harry, he’d have seen the shooter earlier. Draco would hate Harry because he’d been distracting him.
“There’s also a pink sash at the bottom,” Potter says, ignoring Draco’s statement. “Do you think you can come up with something that rhymes with ‘Weasley is our queen’?”
is Draco’s first thought, which of course, he doesn’t say out loud. There’s no point. They’re done. The end for them had come four days ago.
The crowd was loud underneath him. Due to all the noise, he could barely hear Blaise and Draco taking their respective seats behind the drums and the piano.
said to me before I threw you out that day? You don’t get to blame me, or put this entirely on me. You think your words didn’t hurt me? I’m not a cold hearted arse like you. Fuck. That’s not what I—why is this so hard?” Potter scrubs a frustrated hand through his hair, sighing. He closes his eyes briefly, trying to gather his thoughts.
“The house?” Surprise is written all over Potter’s face as he stares wonderingly between Draco and the enchanted door.
The weight of him, the minutes he lies on top of you, it all collates into the most intimate act of the night. How the two of you take your breaths in complementing synchronicity.
Draco breaks off the kiss only once he’s balls deep inside Harry. He presses his forehead against Harry’s, panting, before he pushes himself up for a better angle. He sets an easy pace, pumping slowly, holding Harry’s legs open as he watches his own cock slide in and out of Harry.
“That doesn’t change the fact that I haven’t seen you in almost three weeks. But you can make it up by praising my beauty in the photos.”
His heart beats fast inside his chest when Draco opens the door and the sound of the doorbell echoes loudly through the shop. The very empty shop.
Draco can feel himself blushing as he tells all of this, but Ginny and Pansy are amazing. His story is interrupted by Ginny sharing funny anecdotes and Pansy making jokes at his expense. Mostly, though, he’s gushing about how awesome Potter is.
“And that’s all I ever needed to know about sex with Malfoy, thank you very much. I need more beer to drown the images in my head.”
“You haven’t complained so far. But seriously now, Draco, I’m really happy for you. And it has taken you two long enough to get your act together.”
“Who?” his mother asked, and the weight of his father’s gaze caused him to blurt the name of the only single man he could think of.
It grows colder as he talks, the temperature in the stone passageway dropping several degrees as the torches extinguish themselves once they pass each scone. It feels like they’re chasing an ever shrinking pool of light, and they begin to pick up their pace, eager to get back to the warmth and light of the library’s fireplace. Potter presses closer, shivering slightly through that flimsy bathrobe of his, and Draco lets him.
It’s great to be famous, they said, but what they withhold is the price you have to pay for that. All the money and awards could never replace the lost years or anonymity. Every step you take, especially missteps, was splattered across the tabloids, discussed heatedly on the internet and other public forums. You could never be yourself — as soon as you stepped outside of the house, you were always a role model, an ambassador for one cause or another. Fifty people in one person.
?” Draco counters, folding his arms across his chest. “My mother’s a Black. Of course I knew. Now go on, put on some shoes and let’s get out of here.”
“All right,” Harry drawls. “So, Mr I-need-a-proper-apology, what do you say about dinner tomorrow? I’ll cook.” Upon speaking the last words, Harry places a hand on Draco’s upper arm. Draco’s body leans — involuntarily — a little bit into the touch.
Never had Harry entrusted anyone most with his intimate thoughts, painful memories, and wishes for the future. With Draco though, it simply poured out of him. The same way the ketchup splattered out of the bottle after you hit it too hard.
Draco’s reply is distracted as he focuses on keeping one foot moving in front of the other, and not on the warmth of their interlaced hands. “Yes—the, uh, the house. Well, as you know, this house has been occupied by Pureblood Wizards for generations. Countless centuries, maybe. Anyway, it’s been exposed to magic for so long that the house has absorbed a great deal of it, and developed its own sort of magic. I thought you’d have experienced some of it by now. Like the mattress being softer or harder, depending on what you need. Like the house trying to cheer you up after a bad day. It’s like Hogwarts, it knows what you need. But I guess that’s not the case here, is it? You seemed just as shocked as I was when we discovered that we couldn’t get out of here.”
Draco pulls away, batting Potter’s hand aside, and whispers seductively into his ear, “No, this is not how it’s going to end. You wanted me to take you on this lovely rug. So, get down, Harry, on the rug.”
Deep down, you’re aware that you’d never stand a chance against Malfoy, but every remaining fragment of self-preservation was gently blown off you when he whispered these words into your ear. All past promises to yourself that this was the last time have left with it.
Looking over his shoulder, Draco sees the mimosas blooming. He turns back to Harry, smiling. “Do you think we can get them to bloom some more?”
“That’s…” Harry draws in a deep breath as if he’s preparing for a long monologue but then he deflates, his face falling at the time. “Fine.” Another pause. “I’ll leave you to it then.” Draco watches Harry putting his hands into his pockets and turning around, his head hanging low as he walks towards the door.
Draco opens his eyes when Potter strokes his face with his thumb. Even in the orange light of the fire, he can see that Potter’s cheeks are equally flushed, his eyes blown wide as he looks at Draco and smiles. Potter’s face radiates clear affection as Draco pulls him in for another kiss. Potter rubs his hand over Draco’s erection, until he can’t help but moan shamelessly into Potter’s mouth, his hips rutting uselessly against Potter’s hand in a desperate attempt to get more friction.
“Well, Fleur gave me one of her old Beauxbaton uniforms; Ron has always admired them immensely. Hermione helped with a wig resembling her Yule Ball hairstyle. And the crown and sash, of course.”
Draco sighs; a long, deep sigh. He doesn’t reply. The silence stretches on, and Potter finally says, voice soft, “You’ve asked what it is to me. I care about you. I thought you knew that, I thought you—”
“I’ve just finished polishing this one. It’s totally different from your previous ones, but there's no harm in trying.”
Both his parents knew; he’d told them more than once, but while Narcissa seemed to believe him, Lucius’ ambitions for his son have remained unchanged. In an act of desperation, Draco firmly reiterated over his Christmas pudding that he was
Draco echoes his  sigh as he massages his temples. He can feel a headache beginning to form. “Stop. Look, I don’t understand whatever it is that you’re trying to say. Please just tell me
Their fingers brush when Draco leans forward and takes hold of the glass. Before he has time to object, Potter takes a seat at the other end of the bay window. Potter angles his body to face Draco, stretching out his legs as he does so. Draco follows suit. Silence spreads between them while they drink. Draco takes a cautious sip, and is happy to find that the wine is smokey and spicy, with a bright after-taste. It goes down smooth, and is exactly the kind he likes.
As if on queue, Daphne enters the living room. “Actually, I just wanted to avoid the constant poking of a certain redhead.” She holds out two folders, and Ginny eyes them greedily. Ever since this year’s motto reveal, she’s been excited to see the finished products.
“Mhh... something must’ve caused it.” After a minute, Draco asks, “do you recall Luna’s exact words?”
His hand slips under the waistband, moving from the hipbone to Harry’s cock. As Draco has correctly assessed yesterday, Harry is naked underneath. It’s an awkward position, but Draco doesn’t care. Draco has felt Harry getting hard ever since they started kissing, and while he isn’t an expert on dealing with feelings, he definitely knows how to get his partner off. The moans Harry lets out when Draco strokes his cock indicate he’s doing well.
Draco takes his mouth off of Potter’s cock. “Just a bit longer.” He kisses Harry’s hipbone, his teeth sharp on Harry’s flesh. “I just want to make sure you’re properly prepared.”
He doesn’t dwell on it, though, because there are so many more images to look at. No matter how stupid a couple of designs are, their execution is flawless. Thin lines, perfect shading. Draco is captured by every single one of them. He turns the page once more when his eyes fall on something familiar.
“I’ll be there. After all, I’m your boyfriend now.” It was the last thing Potter said before taking a swig from the bottle and returning to the castle.
The mere sound of his voice causes the hairs on your body to stand up. So familiar. Before you’re doing something idiotic, you’ll decide to move this somewhere else, to one of your houses, your turf. You twist one hand behind his body, holster your gun and reach for your wand.
Nevertheless, he drags himself out of bed into the bathroom and then into Neville’s kitchen, only to put his arms on the table, resting his head on top of them.
After hauling him to his feet — so far you didn’t have to even use a weapon — you force him to step back and back until he reaches the edge. The advantage of rooftops is that you can easily hide your traces by making it look like a suicide. Notes are so easily forged with the right spells that no copper, no forensic analysis will ever uncover the truth. And it’s not like people like him don’t have figurative bodies buried in various places.
“Illegal activities,” Draco sneers, shaking his head in disbelief. “So that’s what you really think of me. Good to know.” Draco’s jaw is tight, his entire body one long line of tension. “And even if I did engage in any illegal activity, what is it to you? Are you trying to ensure that your former fuck buddy gets the comfiest cell in Azkaban?”
Potter follows him as he goes and takes the opportunity to sling an arm around Draco’s waist when he stops in front of the closed library doors—which Draco could have sworn he left open. They’re heavy enough that he would have heard the doors closing, which he didn’t. But before he can point this out, Potter says huskily, “Where are you running off to?”
Before he can do anything else, Potter plucks the book from Draco’s hand, and sets both book and clasps down on a side table, and immediately returns to his ministrations of Draco’s neck—kissing, nibbling, licking. He feels Potter’s hands grabbing hold of the collar of his jacket, his nails scraping lightly over the skin, and loses himself in the combination of Potter’s hands and mouth on his neck.
When Potter browses the shelves for possible new wands, Draco wonders when they’d turned from friends to something that resembles flirting. They haven’t seen each other for a few weeks. He supposes that they bonded over crafting ridiculous items for Weasley’s stag night, but even then it hadn’t been like this.
Potter doesn’t do anything to help; just crosses his arms and stands there silently watching. Draco gives the door an irritated look, before running through the same list of spells that Potter used upstairs, in the exact same order, like a record on repeat. When
The first thing that Draco does when he Apparates into the small back gardens of Number 12 Grimmauld Place, is swear. He looks up at the tightly shuttered windows of the house as he stands there in his tailored grey suit, clutching the edges of his cloak firmly around him against the chill of an early Spring evening, and lets loose a stream of creative curses.
By the time you spill over, the fire has burned through you, leaving sparsely glowing embers behind.
“Here are your photos for ‘(Un)dressed at Work’.” She holds up a finger, wagging it at Ginny and Pansy. “And if they aren’t in pristine condition later, I won’t let you see the rest of them, understood?”
"If you’d been a good best friend and given me something, we wouldn't have to resort to these primitive methods. Your date was over a week ago, so spill."
As Draco steps out of the shop’s back door on his way to the greenhouses, the evening air hits Draco’s face with brutal force. All he truly desires now is a warm shower, but he has to check on the mimosas and a couple of other plants before he can make his way upstairs to Neville’s flat. After casting a gentle Lumos as to not interfere too heavily with the plants’ perception of night and day, he finishes the to-do list for the day. The mimosas are thankfully better; Luna must’ve given them a proper dose of happiness because Draco can see the early signs of new buds.
“Because it’s such an easy conversation to have, huh?” Draco snaps back. “You’d think I’d remember shagging the Saviour in a Muggle club, and not to realise it when he’s gloriously naked, his arse high in the air, when I’m about to do naughty things to him.”
You look up and smile. It would be so easy to Apparate to him, but you can’t attract any more attention. Besides, you love the chase; the adrenaline rushing into your blood. You love the panicked voices, how they try to get away from you as you close the distance despite their efforts. It’s the foreplay to the main act.
It doesn’t take long for the expected man to arrive. Or for him to drag Draco into the nearest stall pushing him against the door. His hands untuck Draco’s shirt while his mouth kisses whatever it can reach. Mostly Draco’s neck.
“This occasion isn’t a joyful one. No, we’ve all come together to mourn. The loss of an incredible human being that many of you knew as a talented singer-songwriter, a skilled guitarist, or a big fashion icon. But to me, Pansy was more than that. I’ve known her all my life. She had been there for me when I almost killed myself with drugs and alcohol. She supported me through my parents’ divorce and stood by me when I needed to step away from music. All my life, she’s been my shoulder to cry on, my rock.” Draco took a deep breath before continuing. On the other side of the stage, Harry’s heart was breaking for his boyfriend. “I love you, Pansy, and I’ll miss you so much.”
Potter gives Draco one more quick kiss, and then his hot mouth finds its way to the soft skin just behind Draco’s ear, before he kisses his way down from Draco’s jawline to his throat. Potter bites down gently, then licks over the bruised flesh. Draco moans, and in the same breath, tilts his head sideways.
After pushing his guitar on his back, Harry stepped in front of Draco to embrace him and kiss him on the forehead. Telling him it would be okay not to go out there or to stop in between. Nobody would blame him, and Harry would be there for him no matter what. All of that without saying the actual words.
Draco makes a lip-are-sealed-motion and watches giddily as Potter’s face morphs first into a pouty expression before he gives Draco the biggest puppy eyes.
It’s not like he isn’t aware of what you want, but you spell it out for him just in case. “Where is he?”
Draco opens his mouth to continue when his pocket vibrates. The fucking Muggle phone Harry sent to him after Draco complained about the mess the owls leave in his office. Draco had to ask one of the trainees for help to figure out how to send messages and receive calls.
“What do you mean?” Draco says. He can’t look at Potter: his gaze shifts over to the fireplace, to the flames dancing in the grate. This secret is too big for him to tell anyone—even the person who defeated Voldemort. Precious Potter.
Harry would never forget the blood soaking Pansy’s green dress while the shot was still echoing in their ears. Draco held her in his arms until the paramedic took her away. This beautiful woman had sacrificed herself to prevent a mad man, claiming to be deeply in love with Draco, to kill him. Nobody else should have him, nobody deserved him — those had been his words.
It takes Draco a full ten seconds to realise he’s been staring, and that he hasn’t shaken the proffered hand Harry has extended. Hell, he hasn’t even been aware of it. The spell breaks when the gorgeous man sighs audibly, rolls his eyes, and walks away.
They stare at each other, having one of those silent conversations married couples have, confusing Draco horribly. He’d remember if anyone had told him before, or if he’d read it in the Prophet. Potter being gay would’ve made the headlines for weeks.
He takes the seat opposite Neville and glances around the shop. It’s small, only four tables, but it’s warm and homely. A couple of brightly daubed canvases line the wall, and Draco knows immediately that Luna is the artist. She’s always drawn, even as a child. Draco thinks of old times in Malfoy Manor with her, before his father chose his loyalty for the Dark Lord over his family, and his mother saw no other way to protect him than to go to France, separating Draco from all his friends.
“You’re amazing,” he says in between pants, then pushes himself up. He slides out of Harry with a soft wet sound, and watches as his seed trickles out of Harry.
Draco’s heart begins to beat faster as they get ever closer to the exit. What if the house decides to lock them in the passageway? He looks ahead, and smiles in relief when he sees the welcoming square of light from the library flooding the passageway, and the still open bookcase.
Harry Potter is a very hard person to get rid of, as proven again that night. From what Draco learned later, he’d dumped his duty onto Neville before tracking and shaking down Draco with the help of his blasted map and a bottle of cheap Muggle spirits in his pocket.
Draco goes first. He runs to the gents as if he’s on his way to a patient about to die. A man on a mission. It crumbles the moment he’s in there all by himself. The last — and first — time Draco had done this, he’d had more to drink than two glasses of wine, and he’d been in a club, not in a pub with a lot of Harry’s friends outside.
With the owls on their way, and their own orders safely stored, Draco goes to the counter, where Luna is already waiting.
“You’re so… perfect… love the way you take all of me.” Draco pants, and he knows he’s going to get rug burns from the way his knees keep shifting on the rug. He can feel his own orgasm begin to build.
You remove the second shackle. Your hands rub over the reddened skin. The ghost of the metal restraining you will remain for a time, like his smell, but not as long as the burn you'll feel tomorrow and possibly the day after.
Potter huffs out a laugh before continuing to inflate the dolls. Draco sprinkles blue glitter over a pattern he’d just created with glue.
“Oh? I, personally, think this is the perfect outfit for the occasion.” Potter sprawls back even further and tugs on his robe, slowly pulling it aside to expose more skin, until the robe hangs midway off one shoulder.
Standing in the middle of Harry’s flat is definitely weird. And Draco is literally in the middle. Right in front of him is Harry’s kitchen with a dining table, to his right are two comfy armchairs flanking a small coffee table, and behind them, the foot end of his bed is visible.
And then some moments forced you to see that you were just like everyone else — just another human being, as mortal as every person on this planet.
Normally, he’d tell her to check in with the team Healer about it tomorrow, but he knows she won’t, so there’s no point. His visits have somehow become an almost weekly ritual by now. To be honest, Draco isn’t even sure anymore how it started, he just knows he’s seeing more of his best friend’s house since Ginny entered her life.
Harry’s entire body is trembling, and Draco can feel how close Harry is, can feel him pushing desperately against him, trying to urge him on. “Please, Draco, please,
Harry had done the same to Remus, had yelled at him because he could’ve stopped Sirius from going into the water. Afterwards, he’d felt like the most horrible person ever since Remus had just lost his husband.
“I hope I’m not crossing a line, and it’s not that I don’t like the way things are; actually, I do like it a lot—”
He knows it’s rude, but he hasn’t really talked with him since it happened. Too embarrassed and at a loss for words. On top of that, he’s been busy at work — overtime hours and a fuck-ton of patients.
Potter blinks at the sudden change in the mood, his mouth opening and closing soundlessly like a guppy. Behind his glasses, his eyes are wide with surprise. Something like realisation passes swiftly across Potter’s face, there and then gone again. Draco doesn’t want to see it. If there’s one thing he needs right now, it’s to get the hell away from Potter, and away from those empty words that he throws around thoughtlessly. He turns away and tries the handle, except that the door won’t open. Draco breathes out calmly and tries it again. The door remains firmly closed.
Every note clear yet so rich in colour. For years, Harry had hated exactly that because he could never win this battle.
“I’m gonna cut this short. Good news, you were right. Bad news, I need to call my cousin in the morning, hoping he can fix it.”
To be honest, Draco doesn’t remember how they’d got him to agree to this — he blames the booze that Pansy kept buying and Ginny’s persistence. It doesn’t matter at all. The fact is that for over a week, bags had been in the corner of his living room. And not just that. Harry fucking Potter invoked some kind of drunken promise of help from said pub night and is now perched comfortably in Draco’s flat, blowing air into something Draco can’t discern from his position.
For the time being though, Draco leaves him be. He slowly undoes his waistcoat, his fingers lingering on each button before he pops it open. He shrugs it off, letting it fall to the floor, then gets to work on the buttons of his white shirt. He’s in the perfect position to admire Harry’s broad shoulders, his gaze trailing down the smooth line of Harry’s spine until it reaches the curve of his arse. Harry’s Venus dimples are on prominent display, the flickering shadows of the fire darkening the shallow dip of skin.
Draco’s mind is still in his flat, winding down from a stressful day at work. He takes a sip of his Pinot Noir, granting himself a few moments to catch up.
Pansy presses one last kiss to Ginny’s lips before sitting upright again. “You practically asked for it.”
Draco smiles weakly. “Not much. Mostly fixing Quidditch Players post-game, and trying to get this one” — he gestures to Harry — “housetrained.”
Draco casts a quick Tempus Charm, cursing as he realises it’s already one p.m, which means the delivery to Harry’s bakery is long overdue and Luna needed him an hour ago. Looking after the plants — and calming some of them down because they’re sensing Neville’s absence — has taken longer than expected.
“I swear, Potter, if there’s even a hint of glitter in my living room after you’re gone, you can search for your balls in the depths of the Black Lake.”
He undresses and gets into the shower. The lingering feeling of Harry's fingers and lips on his body must be washed away. Then, he will go downstairs, avoid Harry, and leave by Portkey tonight as planned.
“Just as I’ve thought. It’s the bloody house,” Draco mumbles to himself. He runs a finger over the dark heavy wood, feeling his own magic humming underneath his fingertips.
Draco nurses his third flute of champagne, wishing for the strong Pálinka Charlie had brought the last time he’d visited Potter at Hogwarts. He doesn’t realise how tight his grip on the glass is until Pansy appears on his right side, casually inquiring if he’s trying to get out of this by breaking the flute and cutting his hand on the broken glass.
“Seems like Daphne was very dedicated to finishing them earlier this year.” Pansy smirks before taking a seat.
His eyes roam over the man in front of him. Half of Potter's face is lit with a warm glow from the fire, the other half cast in shadow. His breath hitches when he sees the edges of the fading love bite sticking out from under the collar of Potter’s robe; the very same one he had left  underneath Potter’s collarbone not just four days ago. Draco licks his lips involuntarily as he thinks back to the last time, to the noises Potter made as he marked him with his hands and his mouth, to the moans he dragged out of Potter...
The moment he steps out of the Floo, Draco’s nerves are replaced by smugness. Harry isn’t dressed yet, but cursing — from what his mother told him — like Great-Uncle Alphard during a lot of family gatherings.
He almost slips when his calves touch the barrier. Your hand reaches out to grab his jacket, but instead of pulling him back, you leave him hanging, giving him time to look sideways and see the busy London street far below. The deep drop that’ll await him if he doesn’t cooperate. He will take this exit no matter what, but he won’t realise that until it’s too late.
, which should have ripped the door from its hinges and reduced it to firewood. The door simply emits a faint blue glow when the spell hits, which grows brighter as the spell slowly sinks into the wood before fading away completely. There’s no way this should be happening. There’s no way this
“Kiss me,” Harry says between moans, and Draco does just that. He lets go of Harry’s legs, and leans over to capture his mouth with his own. His rhythm begins to falter; he fucks Harry wildly now, hips snapping against Harry’s, and all it takes is a couple more thrusts. Harry comes first, his cock jerking in wild spurts all over their stomachs, his body clenching tight around Draco, and it’s the feeling of Harry’s body gripping his, warm and wet and tight around his cock, that brings him over the edge.
doesn’t work, Draco casts a couple of additional spells that Potter certainly doesn’t know about, muttering under his breath as he does so—they’re new Unspeakable spells which Draco is currently in the process of fine-tuning. He’s fully aware that he shouldn’t be casting them in front of an Auror, much less an Auror who is
The moment he kneels on the floor and puts his hands behind his head, you take a step forward and know this will be a quick job. Your eyes stay trained on his arms because they’re in the perfect position to reach for a weapon strapped to his back. You, yourself, have used this trick before, and the scar on your left cheek serves as a reminder of the other time when you barely made it out alive.
The house remains silent, and the back door obligingly swings itself shut as Draco goes deeper inside. He climbs up the small staircase and stops in front of the door that leads into the main part of the house, where he pauses on the landing, trying to make out any sounds beyond the door. Complete silence.
“Well done, Potter. Maybe there’s still hope for you after all. Ten points to the Aurors for Potter’s great detective skills.” Draco says mockingly. He looks out of the window, trying to cover up the fact that his cheeks are heating up once more.
Draco reaches over to grab the bottle. He pops open the lid and squeezes a small amount in his hand, astonished to feel that it’s already warm. He shifts down, and Harry spreads his legs obligingly. One hand finds its way to Harry’s arse, and he circles Harry’s hole with one wet finger teasingly. Draco shifts up until Harry’s legs hang over his shoulders, his mouth hovering over Harry’s erect cock, and then he licks a long stripe from base to tip before taking Harry into his mouth. At the same time, he pushes his first finger in, slowly. Harry moans, long and deep, his cock twitching in Draco’s mouth. Draco slides his finger in and out of him, careful and slow, until Harry’s looser, then adds a second finger. Draco’s hot mouth slides up and down Harry’s hard cock while his fingers push in and out, keeping the same rhythm.
The next morning, Draco is woken by Neville faffing about in the flat. A quick glance to the alarm clock on his bedside table tells him it’s six thirty a.m., way too early for Draco to be up.
Draco’s skin prickles as Harry’s magic washes over them, and he knows that he never stood a fighting chance.
Potter looks down, taking in Draco’s flushed face. He brings both his hands to Draco’s face again, cupping it tenderly, and leans in. Draco thinks he’s leaning in for another kiss, but Potter just kisses the corner of Draco’s mouth instead, making him smile. Potter begins dropping little kisses all over Draco’s face—along his cheekbones and up to the corner of his eye. Draco lets out a little sigh of contentment, closes his eyes, and allows himself to enjoy it. This is a side of Potter that he rarely got to see during the last year; they never took the time to really explore each other.
It’s only when Harry pushes himself up onto his elbows and glares at Draco, saying, “Merlin, Draco, are you going to fuck me now or what?” that he finally slides his fingers free.
You sigh, disappointed at the very predictable plea to not hurt. It’s natural, and you’d gladly cause less harm, but from years of experience, you can safely say that pain is the only real motivator for truth. There’s still the slightest bit of hope that he’ll put up a fight. He might be one of those people who reach their breaking point fairly late.
“Oh yes, Potter. Telling two gossiping Sixth Years that the Saviour actually likes it when I fuck him hard into the mattress is exactly what I did.” Draco’s voice is dripping with sarcasm.
Draco usually busies himself with the magazines lying around when Pansy is gone, but today, a binder catches his eye. He thumbs through it, looking at image after image of ink on skin. Draco admires some people’s bravery, quietly laughs at the stupidity of others, and rolls his eyes when he sees that somebody got Potter’s signature on their skin. Like an ‘I was here’ carved into wood. Draco wonders though if Potter actually signed
Draco stumbles over an image and is reminded of one of the best nights of his life. There’s a catch though; of course, there is.
The shimmering charms on the buffet table dissipate, but Draco doesn’t see, busy as he is grabbing Potter’s hand and Apparating them back to Hogwarts.
Draco huffs. “You three can continue this game while I get another refill and try to steal some finger food from the buffet.”
, for helping me select the perfect wand for Draco. I know it's not discussed in detail in the fic, but it was important to me.
You run after him; there are three floors between you both by now. That’s not even a challenge — it’s more like chasing after Teddy at the Burrow. A walk in the park. If you could, you’d drag it out, but Kingsley was clear that he needed the information as soon as possible. Vital information, leaving no room for mistakes. That’s why he gave this mission to you.
Potter doesn’t give him any time to react before he leans in, his thumb stroking gently over Draco's left cheek. It’s a light, soft kiss, just a brush of their lips. It's completely unlike all the other times that they’ve done this before. Potter’s face is shining as they break apart, and he begins to laugh, but his gaze isn’t focused on Draco. It’s directed on something just to Draco’s right.
Draco is pulled out of his reminiscent thoughts by the soft clink of china on the wooden table. To be honest, Draco prefers tea or coffee over hot chocolate, but this smells heavenly.
“Don’t play dumb. You know very well what I mean. I can see it in your eyes. I knew you were always good at charms, you did get an ‘O’ in your N.E.W.T.s after all. And your family’s Pureblood—so is that the reason why you know so many spells that I’ve never even heard of?”
Fortunately, the book that Draco had accidentally left here doesn’t contain any clues that might expose what he does. It does have some coded notes that are crucial to his work, but the notes don’t make sense to anyone unfamiliar with the project that he’s currently working on. Most of the notes relate to Potion-making, which allows Draco to pretend that he’s training to be a Potions Master in the event that anyone asks.
Harry chuckles and kisses the tip of Draco’s nose. “Shut up, I know you don’t mind or you’d have moved away.”
Draco doesn’t hate children, but he prefers to have them as fully formed students at school, or like Teddy before he started Hogwarts: for an afternoon, before returning them to their parents or guardians.
. That was the worst word that Potter could’ve chosen. Something to use and then toss aside. Draco’s biggest regret was that he ever allowed himself to feel something for Potter, that he had ever allowed himself to believe that they could have been something more.
“Aha, got you,” he says triumphantly, and carefully slides his wand through the gap until it touches the lock. When the keyhole glows golden, Draco turns his wand as if unlocking a door, and the rock wall slowly melts away to reveal a black wooden door. He takes his wand out of the lock and jiggles the golden handle, trying to open the door. Nothing happens.
“If that’s the case, then yes.” Draco has to admit that Ginny, as well as Ron, are excellent cooks. Probably all Weasley siblings have exceptional culinary skills. He’s once heard Wood rave about Percy’s food while high on pain potions. Wood might also have mentioned a frilly apron with red roses, but Draco kept that part to himself. Healer-patient confidentiality and all.
anger, in Lucius’s case. Draco smirks, turns to face Potter, and says, “Everyone, please welcome my boyfriend, Harry Potter.”
“Another?” Harry blurts out, snapping Draco back to the present. “You can just ask me out, Draco. No need to spend all your money on wands.”
He stands around morosely, putting on his best air of “don’t talk to me”. It seems to be fairly successful because although there are potential brides aplenty in the Manor ballroom, none of them have approached (save Ginny, Pansy, and Millie, but they don’t count anyway).
“Let me see.” She grabs the photo from Draco’s hands. “Sorry to disappoint, Draco, but that’s just a root.”
He goes through the layout mentally, to make sure that he doesn’t have to spend more time here than necessary.  He doesn’t really need to do that, but he’s nervous, and doing this calms his nerves.
Draco turns away from Harry, not sure how to deal with the whirlwind of unfamiliar emotions. In the darkness, he can hide and pretend there’s nothing wrong. His thoughts are jumping from one place to another, words inadequate to express his feelings. Distracting Harry, and himself, from his inner turmoil, Draco reaches behind himself, his hand running down Harry’s side to the elastic of his jogger bottoms.
Draco cuts him off with a kiss. He needs to feel Potter’s lips on his again, just to make sure that it isn’t some mad dream. Potter kisses him back eagerly, and it isn’t long before they lose themselves, exchanging soft kisses.
Suddenly, the room is green. Before Harry is even in the room, he’s come as far as “Gin, I don’t know what to do. Dra— Oh.”
Draco enters the Parkinson-Weasley house late Thursday evening, unexpected by the owners and uncaring what he might be interrupting. He pours himself a glass of their strongest vodka before sitting down in his favourite armchair.
Draco’s job as an Unspeakable usually complicates his life instead of making it easy. Nobody, not even his mother, knows what he does. It’s both a blessing and a curse—Draco relishes the chance to make a difference, to do work that he finds meaningful and honourable; that differs very obviously from Lucius’ footsteps. However, all his work is shrouded in secrecy, done under the cover of plausible deniability—if it became public knowledge that an ex-Death Eater was working as an Unspeakable, the resulting scandal would spell the end of the Minister for Magic’s political career. This doesn’t bother him most of the time, but sometimes, in the deepest, darkest recesses of his heart, he wishes that someone, besides his colleagues, would know. Would know what he’s accomplished after the war, would know how far he’s come, would see beyond the Dark Mark on his arm.
Draco takes a deep breath. He thinks back to all the things that have made him happy. Like his mother chasing him around the gardens at Rosier Villa, or the day he passed his exams and officially became a Healer.
On instinct, the pair nestle closer together, Harry’s warm chest pressing against Draco’s back. Soft lips brush against his neck, sending shivers of pleasure rolling over Draco’s skin. Draco adjusts his position slightly and Harry’s lips graze over another patch of skin.
Pansy’s smirk is enough to not ask any more questions. He sips his wine and waits patiently for the girls to finish. He’s learned his lesson after doing this for four years now, and his butt still hurts when he thinks of Ginny’s hex from last year.
“Not again,” Pansy sighs. “She always tries to outdrink Dean.” Two more shot glasses hit the table. “But if she ends up with alcohol poisoning, she’s your problem,” Pansy adds with a smile.
In an attempt to keep composure, Draco turns his back to the living room and steadies his grip on the mugs. Only when he’s sure he can survive the sight awaiting him, he walks into the room. With the mugs carefully set on the table, Draco sits down on the couch.
"Thanks," Draco says, his eyes fixed on the plants, "for both the boiler and the tea." Harry remains where he is, as if he's waiting for Draco to say more. Draco can't, so he casts another Patronus, hoping Harry gets the hint. It's weaker than the ones before.
With careful movements, you unfold the spit wet piece of parchment. There are numbers, coordinates. You have a feeling about what you’ll find there. And at the bottom of the note, there’s a message, written in his unmistakable, neat curl.
After ringing the bell again and waiting yet another few minutes, Draco cautiously steps back to see all the windows are still dark. There is, however, a light next door. From where Draco stands, he has an undisturbed view into the back room of the bakery next to Neville’s flower shop.
Draco braces himself on the counter, waiting for the kettle to boil while praying that it’ll never finish its task. He turns his head a bit, checking if Potter is still sitting on his living room floor and this hasn’t just been some delusion.
did an amazing job once again. Being my beta, my shoulder to cry, and my personal confidence booster. Thank you so much. <3
He knocks on the door once, twice, and waits. No answer. Draco knocks harder. Still no answer. He lifts his leg, aims for the door, and—
Harry almost missed his cue for the chorus. The two of them had never sung publically together. Harry’s voice was much darker than Draco’s, but against all odds, it worked. They melted effortlessly together in perfect harmony. Rich and heavy.
With half-a-bottle’s worth of alcohol rushing through his bloodstream, Draco’s tongue loosened and he told Harry everything. Literally everything. From his gay epiphany at twelve to his father’s insistence on him finding a wife and making cute, blond babies.
Draco’s gaze is drawn to the slippers Harry had toed off and left by the edge of the rug. The lions are dozing now, their eyes shut.
“Know it was you? I adjusted them so that only you could enter without encountering any obstacles. Anyway, this plan was just thrown together at the spur of the moment. I had hoped that well... this would make you reconsider our relationship."
The smug expression on Pansy’s face has an interesting effect on Ginny. “Wouldn’t you like to know,” she answers.
Draco stirs, his head still in a daze, and Harry’s hand strokes soothingly — and a bit uncoordinated — over Draco’s skin. Without thinking, Draco puts his hand over Harry’s, lacing their fingers together, similar to how Harry had done a couple of hours earlier.
The nausea might actually be a symptom of his hangover and not Harry-related at all. After managing to stand upright, Draco slowly walks to the bathroom and checks it for potions, but all he can find are empty phials.
Sandwiched between Hermione and Pansy, Draco carefully takes a sip from his Sauvignon Blanc. Carefully, because the table at the pub is far too crowded, but since they’re in Muggle London, they didn’t use Extension Charms.
Safe and vulnerable at the same time. There’s a tenderness behind every kiss and caress that leaves him craving more.
Potter’s staring at him blankly. “Draco,” he says slowly, “I have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about.”
Also, Draco discovered — by means of looking long, intently, and frequently at Oliver Wood and Cedric Diggory — that his interests aren’t really part of the “Traditional Pureblood Heir Handbook”, so finding a wife had never been his intention.
he adds mentally, and then that old bitter feeling is there again, simmering just underneath the surface. He has never been good enough for Potter, and moments like this only serve to highlight this inconvenient truth, over and over again.
It’s only when Potter says, “I’ll make you feel so good that you’ll never want to leave,” that Draco snaps entirely out of his lust-induced haze. He turns around and shoves Potter back in one swift motion, his hand pressed forcefully against Potter’s chest, glaring hatefully.
Potter looks like he’s stepped straight out of Draco’s best dreams. His skin glistens slightly with sweat, his sleeves are rolled up, showing the most delicious forearms, and his shirt collar is open wider than Draco is used to, revealing a tanned patch of skin that he wouldn’t mind licking.
Draco’s eyes glide over the well-muscled body. Over the werewolf, the big, black dog as well as the stag and the doe inked on his skin. And then he realises Potter is really wearing
So far, Ollivander has been the only wandmaker to sell Draco a wand, but his luck might be running out very soon.
Potter’s smile widens into a grin, and Draco scowls at him, although he can’t help but luxuriate in the feeling of Potter’s hand in his. For a moment, he allows himself to pretend that they’re more than—than whatever they are. Here, in the narrow corridor of the secret passageway, Draco allows himself this brief reprieve from reality.
'well i got blackout drunk, then i remember going to the bathroom, but i don't really remember what happened after that and that's the worst part.'
"Congratulations Miss Potter, you are about nine weeks pregnant," he says gently. "I would say - and this is an early estimate - that the baby is due between early November to early December. I can't give you anything more than that at this stage."
i couldn't really remember what had happened in the last hour-ish but the room was now buzzing and a girl with auburn-red hair in tight curls that fell down her back approached me I couldn't really make out what she said clearly but it was something along the lines of 'do you want to go back to mine or yours ' we got in a taxi and headed home, she payed the taxi fare while I opened the door up i can't really remember what happened but it ended with us laying in bed with no clothes on, breathing abnormally fast.
he places the cup down on the rough wooden coffee table. "You know where I am now, so I expect you to keep me in the loop." He looks at me, his expression softening a little. "Speaking off, how are you?"
Cedric slides a plate of scrambled eggs and toast in front of me, a happy smile on his face. "Me too."
I decline the invitation to go out for a drink, promising to make it up to the team later, and finally escape.
after much research we found something called magic mistletoe which would lock them in place together until they kissed, no spell could help them.
Draco shakes his head at me. "You're right. This loft — the bar, none of it is very child-friendly." He pins me with a look. "Speaking off..."
also for some reason i can’t upload the photos, if you want to see them they’re on my wattpad yoursogoldennnn, but they’re just baby nursery’s from pinterest
it's was about 10am when Haley had left Draco's apartment for the foreseeable future and were on their way to their new apartment; the cars boot filled to the brim with extra things they had/needed to use over the past few days. It was only about 20 minutes away including London city traffic with a moving van following closely behind them.
I can't deny how much I'm looking forward to hearing and seeing the baby for the first name, to holding our child. A family. Our family.
"It's fine!" Please leave! I scream mentally. i lean down to pick them up but he's already kneeling down, one long pale hand reaching for them. Fuck.
"She made a mistake - she slept with someone else and now she's not sure who the father is. On top of that, the other man wants to know if he's the dad so he can be involved with the baby. I'm just not sure what kind of advice to give her."
I knew I couldn't raise another man's baby especially when we had waited for so long to have a baby together, I love her part of me always will but the other part cant look past the fact that she and that boy slept together. All because she was drunk, them she had the audacity to blame it on the fact she was drunk and couldn't remember any of it.
Thoughts of home become thoughts of Cedric. My stomach twists in uncomfortable knots and I fight back the urge to be sick. I have to do something about Malfoy. What, I'm not quite sure, but something .
At this, I feel my face drain of colour. Birth. Birth. I have not given a single thought about that aspect of pregnancy. Eventually, the baby is going to have to come out .
Once we had got inside I whispered 'I told him and he told me to leave' between sobs before I broke down in his arms, I can't really remember what happened next but I can recall he took me into his room and gave me one of his shirts before going into his bathroom, giving me privacy so I could get changed.
Draco would be home soon and I needed to find out before he got home to spare his feelings in case it's another false alarm.
So i've just found out that harry styles will be performing at the Grammys and honestly it's the only thing that's keeping me going.
"So, I'll see you next year." I try to take the sodding pamphlets out of his hands, but he's still kneeling by the desk, turning them over to read.
My stomach had started to show but not enough that I was restricted from wearing my current clothes, before I left I had managed to grab a few things including: some basic toiletries, a few changes of clothes, a phone charger and my vitamins I have to take daily (unsure of how long I would be away). After I had drank my tea I went into the bathroom to get ready, leaving my long auburn hair rest on my back in its natural waves and got changed into a pair of leggings with an oversized sweater and my vans trainers. When I left the room about 10 minutes later I saw Draco up and ready in a black suit on his phone, an empty cup of coffee lay infront of him.
"That's true," I agree. "But," I chew on my bottom lip. "Wouldn't it hurt? I mean, if it was us..." I trail off.
me and draco have been trying for a baby for a while now, around 3 years. Ever since Hermione and Pansy had Rose we had baby fever.
'You don't remember me?" He sits down in the chair facing my desk, his legs crossed, his posture relaxed.
as i'm walking home i decide to take a short cut ,as my feet are killing me, to a street that i haven't been through before. i'm lost in thought on how i should tell cedric, when i look up i can see a baby shop. immediately i'm drawn in because i can actually look for myself not one of ron's brothers baby.
I went to answer it the person on the other side still pounding on the door. However once I opened it I saw the man who stole my Haley from me. All i wanted to do is rip his head off, but my curiousity got the best of me so i asked him what he wanted.
I don't want to get my hopes up, let alone Draco's; who feels like hes already failing as a parent, and as a husband.
Draco seems bemused by my actions, a quizzical expression crosses his face. "Correct, I'm still the owner and we still sell liqueur."
he launched over to me careful of my still non existent bumb and took me into his arms and held me there, sill in shock
he leads me upstairs towards his apartment, once I get threw the door I turn around to face him, not quite meeting his eyes.
"Right." I run my hand through my already messy red hair. "Thanks again." I promise to come back in two weeks so dr Klein can see how I'm doing and leave.
He smirks, "We went upstairs — I live in the loft over the bar. It was... you were...," he trails off, clearly lost in the memories.
oh...' I vaguely remember hearing him say while I see him put them down before my vision is clouded with unshed tears.
i split this into two because it's a long part also i had a maths test today which i definitely failed so yeah
Taking Draco's advice i decided to go and rest while he went to get my stuff, it's not like he'll need me while he gets it anyway.
'Haley answer the next question honestly... are you saying you cheated on me and the baby might not be mine!'
Klein smiles kindly at me. "The next step is a visit with the midwife and setting up antenatal visits."
As i send the letter off first class with my assistant, I try to push all my worry about draco to the back of my mind. At least draco was sticking to his side of the deal.
when harry went to pull away after a few seconds but draco caught the side of his face and pulled him back in with his arms attaching themselves around his neck, Harry's arms coming to hold Draco's waist. this went on for a few minutes until they had to pull apart for air, their foreheads coming to rest on the others, a smile pulling from the corner of eithers mouth.
I flush, ashamed. "I've never cheated before," which is the truth, though I'm not sure he believes me. "It would break his heart."
All at once I want to wring the man's neck, throw his arse out and know every single thing he's said to Cedric. It's hard to decide what I want to say or do first.
When it was about 10 in the morning there was incessant knock on the door; I finally had to get out of bed and stop wallowing in self pity.
"I have..." I pause as I try to work out how to approach this. "A friend at work who's got herself into trouble and I don't know how to help her."
I play with the scrambled eggs for a moment, before taking a small bite. Cedric is by my side in an instant.
I can feel my face draining of colour. "It was?" My throat is tight, my heart is hammering in my chest.
Work drags by slowly. I jump every time Ginny says, "Haley, you have a visitor!" in a cheerful voice.
'it's fine, i just wanted to tell you something.' I pause mentally preparing myself 'I want you to hear me out before you say anything'
Harry soon descovered draco's love for Christmas especially decorating a tree, but more importantly how much he wants the tree to look perfect including the preciseness of where each bauble in placed in correlation to each colour.
"We need a name that won't get our child bullied at school," I tease. "I like the idea of giving the baby a name though, I don't like having to call the baby 'it' all the time."
he looks at me confused but complies. i take the bears out of my coat pocket and place them on his now outstretched hands.
pleased with our surprised reactions they turned away and headed in the direction of the slytherin dorm rooms.
'I would take you out on a proper date, show you what you deserve... after all the baby should have two parents who love each other unconditionally.'
im supposed to by marrying ginny this summer but im gay and so is she. She's in love with a girl called luna from ravenclaw and just I'm confused
Every Christmas Harry would take Teddy to go and buy a really nice bauble and write a message to either his parents, sirius or any of the fallen.
Once they were finished, they were both satisfied as it included both of their tastes, each one complementing the other, just like themselves.
when we arrive at the now familiar door, he holds it open and waits for me to walk through, instantly I sit down on the sofa while he sits on the armchair.
I only leave when its 6 pm and i know he would be home any minute. As soon as I've sat down and change into comfier clothes he arrives home.
He pokes me in the ribs. "Yeah, our first as a couple!" His eyes are shining with joy and it's infectious.
Interrupting my thoughts i needed to pee, i stood up bumping my hip on the table causing my now half-full drink to spill. Everyone was to drunk to even notice so i slipped away, slowly as i was trying to fall over, to the toilets.
'hypothetically' he repeats,' I would probably want to move in together in case anything goes wrong I can be there, but as you have pointed out we would have to get a new place because this isn't suitable for a baby,' he states as if it were facts, bewildered I just say,
I feel him take me into his arms, wrapping them around my torso and resting his chin on top of my head while I break down.
"It's a busy day and as you no doubt saw, there are a lot of people waiting to see us. So if you could...," I gesture towards the door, my smile strained.
Alarmed, I flinch, I wasn't aware that I woke him up. "Nothing, go back to sleep." I say dismissively.
We troop up the stairs to his loft. A week has passed and I do not feel any fitter than I did last week with these stairs. Once we reach the top and pass through the wards, I head straight for Draco's over the top white leather sofa and immediately sink down into it.
'Harry when are we going to get this years bauble!!' little 7 year old Teddy said rushing out his words clearly bursting with excitement of having another person to share their tradition with.
'Right, of course'. I smile, or at least I try to, and Cedric comes to my rescue and begins asking his own questions.
As I as laying in bed I looked to my left to see cedric laying there peacefully unknowingly. I've never felt more guilty with what I did. It got us into this whole mess. I just hope our relationship is strong enough to get through this but I dont deserve it.
Once we've ate we go to the first house, I liked it but Draco and I agreed that it just wasn't our style, the second house we saw would need to much renovating, the third was the same so we decided it would be better if we just went to look at the apartments.
'I own my own restaurant love, if you really must know I help my father run his business, one that once he retires I will take over' and with that he went down stairs with the realter who was previously stood in the corner, not really sure where to look, I presume to go and to sign the papers to make this apartment ours.
I mumble a response, which causes him to lead me over to the sofa. I sit down while he walkes towards the kitchen to make some tea, I guess. A few minutes later he comes to sit beside me bringing a tray with two cups of tea on it with him.
I stare numbly at the off white ceiling. I swallow past the lump in my throat. "W-what do I have to do now? I mean-"
Taking the bags he had upstairs he went into Cedric's bedroom (while obviously turning his nose up at the mess and smell) and started to get her clothes out lo off the wardrobe. All while Cedric stood at the door observing his every move.
I glare fiercely back at him. I want to get him away from Cedric as quickly as possible. No, I need to get him away from Cedric.
Once they had finished the kitchen and living room they did the nursery; so it would be ready for the baby's arrival in a few months time, Haley caught Draco stood in shock in the nursery, barely believing he would have a family a few times but was considerate enough not to mention it to him, for the sake of his pride.
I stagger forwards and sink down into a chair, my head in my hands. This situation is slowly slipping out of my control. Questions buzz around my head, mostly concerning Malfoy .
"Good." Draco relaxes into the single leather chair, throwing an arm over the back of it. "I like to make sure that the things that belong to me are taking care of themselves."
'I thought we could go to the Harvester as it's on the way to the houses I want to show you', he tells me as he open's the door for me so I can get in the car. Maybe he can be a gentleman.
'in here' I called from, the living room when I sat shaking with anticipation, holding the carefully wrapped box with a white bow on top.
"In any case," I clear my throat, "it's been lovely meeting you. Good luck with the bar." I rise, holding my hand out formally.
He looks thoughtful. "A woman of her word," his eyes drift to my stomach and smirks, "sometimes." I resist the urge to scream at him.
I scratch behind my ear. "Nothing has changed since last time." I drop my hands into my lap. "I won't be able to tell you anything new for another three weeks at least."
The question takes me by surprise. "I'm fine," I find myself saying and then figure he deserves the truth. "I have some morning sickness, but other than that, I'm well."
First I got him to watch home alone as it's a classic then we watched the grinch which he thought was stupid as 'this would never happen Pottah it's not realistic' he said while a house elf pops up bringing him a hot chocolate with warming charms on it and he levitates it to and from himself and the table when ever he wants it .
"Well," I manage to choke out, "I always do listen to your ideas, love, " I stress the final word, which only seems to amuse Malfoy .
I nodded in agreement as we finished our food in comfortable silence, After we had finished Draco put Netflix on and we watched some movie, well he watched the movie. I fell asleep.
'ok man i don't knw what your problem is but just get that bitches stuff and get out, i don't want anything of hers left her when i get back' and with that he slammed the door and left, leaving draco dumbfounded holding some calvin klein bras.
For the past week Draco and I have been packing up his apartment and going furniture shopping so we'll have it in time for when we move in which is only 2 weeks away. We've been on countless trips to Ikea and packed up all of Draco's stuff when I realised that the remainder of my clothes are at Cedric's house. the only thing is I don't want to go back. I don't want to see him, even though its my fault that we're here in the first place; I still can't forgive him for not hearing me out and kicking me out at basically the first opportunity he had.
Malfoy has really got under my skin, damn it. I force a smile, ignoring how much I've been doing that in the last half an hour and how much my cheeks hurt right now.
I went into the room (with my hands shaking with nerves), I was ready to finally put my mind at ease.
sorry but you'll find out who's baby it is in the next chapter i'm not sure when that will be as we have loads of exams to do but i'll try and upload it in a few days!
He hums softly to himself and then looks me square in the eye. "And you spent the night with me." It's a statement, not a question.
Guilt washed over me as I nodded my head to his question slightly, I handed over the envelope and when he opened it his whole face changed into something I've never seen on his face before.
this only last a few minutes until i hear someone walking this way. they would make me go back not caring how i felt.
i'm so sorry for what happened and how people seemed to forget, i'll never forget how you saved my life. You sound like a good guy for saving Harry!
"No." Oh my God, I sound like a moody teenager. I clear my throat and try again. "Good afternoon Draco."
my parents make me come every year no matter how much I protest as 'you have to keep up appearances harry no matter how much you hate it'
"It's not the strangest question I've been asked," Klien's voice is coloured with amusement. "Babies do poop, but it only happens in less than 15% of all pregnancies and most of the waste comes out during birth."
He snorts, "I have to get along with my baby mummy." He covers his mouth as he yawns, and I can't help but notice how well developed his chest is. "If this lovely little chat is over then I am going back to bed. You're welcome to join me." he adds cheekily.
That night, I lie in bed, my mind whirling. Cedric sighs and turns over, dropping an arm over my chest.
Klien presses a reassuring hand on my shoulder. "It's OK, we don't have to think about the birth just yet, but it is something we're going to need to discuss in the future."
At least this time he's wearing clothes. He's wearing a sleek pair of dark grey trousers, with a matching grey t-shirt that is just tight enough to stretch across his chest in a way that shows it off nicely.
It had 3 bedrooms, enough for us and the baby, and 2 bathrooms including an on suite joined to the master bedroom. The kitchen was connected to the living room with full length windows that replaced the walls, giving the place a lot of natural light. There was a balcony that was only accessible from the master bedroom but it could be seen slightly from the living room, though it was mainly blocked by the large flat screen tv hung on the wall.
"Ah." Klein sounds like he's heard this all before, and maybe he has. Fabulous, I've become a statistic. "That would complicate matters."
Looking at the time I realised it was now 9pm and I had work tomorrow morning. Without getting ready I got straight into bed. After 5 minutes I realised how lonely and cold this bed felt without her, compulsively I decided to go to the pub and get drunk.
When he first saw Harry's tree he was distraught with how it was decorated, how the colours of each bauble were mismatched. How the lights were all still tangled up. How there was tinsle on each levels of the branches.
'Haley answer the next question honestly... are you saying you cheated on me and the baby might not be mine!'
The following morning, Cedric is up, dressed and in the kitchen before I am. There's a parenting book on the kitchen table, along with a list written in Cedric's neat script. I wander over and pick it up.
"How soon can you tell who the father is?" I ask. "It has to be Cedric, right?" My mouth is very dry right now. "You can't get pregnant by having sex one time."
cedric shoves me off him, climbing on top of me, I spread my legs so he can he can settle between them easier. he pins my hands above my head, kissing me. we never did make it to work that day.
but on the 7th time they were joined by Draco Malfoy. He and harry had started to date in early February and Harry had introduced him to Teddy late March.
'do you love her, haley' cedric pauses while maintaining eye contact with draco 'or is she just a good fuck?'
'yeah i'm fine', i dropped my pen onto the desk, screwing on the paper i had been doodling on and throwing into the bin in the corner of my office. the action seemed to jog something in my foggy brain. waste, it was ringing a bell.
'i got bored amd craved cheetos so i walked to the shop to get some and now i'm watching the vampire diaries'
"Why don't you sit down Haley?" He pats an empty chair next to him. "After all, you have the baby to think of now."
I cope, I somehow cope, until a letter is dropped of into my office. I'm instantly suspicious. No one I know has a this return address.
The bar is closed when I arrive. The doors are locked from the inside. I realise that there has to be a private entrance for the workers, so I head down the side of the bar. There i find a large wooden door with the word 'EMPOLYEES ONLY' I knock loudly on the door and wait.
Guilt washed over me as I nodded my head to his question slightly, I handed over the envelope and when he opened it his whole face changed into something I've never seen on his face before.
He hands me a leaflet. "I suggest you tell your boyfriend at least, and if you know - the other man who may be the father. Other than that, I'd advise against telling anyone else until you're 12 weeks."
I ball my fists at my sides. "Shut up! No one is supposed to know." My voice sounds more pleading than angry.
"Well, at least I can trust one of you," Klien high fives Cedric. "So, you're entering into the world of sleepless nights and baby vomit. How are you both feeling?" Healer Klien folds his arms, half sitting on his office table.
It was just after lunch and I had decided to get it over and done with. I knock on the door and wait for the deviously handsome but arrogant blonde to arrive.
it was going to happen eventually, i just helped to speed it up. I saved them a lot of time in the long run. He should be thanking me.
'Ah yes, we do need to warn people that another Potter is coming to cause trouble.' I pause. 'We should tell Snape first, he's going to have a heart attack.'
"As for your first question, it's too early to tell. Right now the baby is the size of a raspberry. As the baby develops we'll be able to do more."
I think this is the longest chapter so far. but I want to finish this story soon as I'm running out of ideas, if you have any please let me know.
In this the Potters are alive and happy. Harry's family are the gryffindoor royal family draco is slytherin, there isn't any hate towards each other and the kingdoms get along well but Draco was engaged to Astoria and harry was engaged to ginny.
as far away from Cedric as possible and informed and I still won't know for sure who the father is for weeks.
so literally half of my year is isolating but im not, so at school there is going to be basically no one to talk to but someone who is supposed to be isolating and has come into contact of the person who has it asked people to come around to hers,
unable to get the words I take the test results out of the envelope, I had opened it at the doctors office so I knew what to do. I pass them over to him and see the range of emotions display across his face as he reads the results.
'hello miss potter, i'm dr Klein', he turns out to be a fairly handsome redhead man with a well-trimmed beard, an easy smile and kind eyes.
"Oh!" I blush. "No - well-" Oh Merlin. 'Cedric - my boyfriend and I have been talking about maybe, you know, trying for kids, but we haven't had great news and told that we had a really low change of it actually happening.' i manage to stutter out.
Haley would have the master bedroom as the door next to her bathroom would lead to the baby's nursery and Draco would have the second which wasn't all that different just didn't have a balcony his room was also next to the nursery but he would have to leave his bedroom to get there.
Gratefully i look up and whisper 'my saviour' to him, my headache still not completely cleared, i notice him still wearing his sleepwear so i know we have some time until we have to be at work. i grin and pull him down onto me, rolling over so i'm on top of him.
"Hm, that's good. Not everyone gets morning sickness, but be aware - just because you haven't felt sick yet doesn't mean you won't ."
when he returned he led me into his bed and wrapped the duvet around me as the t-shirt was only made from a thin material and only came down to my knees.
'well i believe potter that this is magic mistletoe and judging by their grins im guessing they have something to do with it'
There's only a week left until I can find out who the father is, I find out if my mind can be put at ease or my life will change. I know what I have to do but I'm not happy about it .
I feel like a bastard. "If you are, then I'd like you to be part of the child's life," I hesitate, "It would be beneficial to my life if you weren't - because of Cedric. Because if you're not, then mine and Cedric's life doesn't change."
I scratch the back of my neck. "Well yeah - I mean, I've had a couple of headaches, but nothing I would be worried about."
"We were." I shrug, rubbing the back of my neck nervously. "It happened sooner than we were expecting, but..." I shrug, I really can't complain. This is everything we've wanted. Cedric's smile is still fresh in my mind.
this has Mpreg harry so if you aren't comfortable with this don't read, it also includes them struggling to get pregnant just incase any of this Is a tw!
He releases my arm, it still feels warm from his touch. I need to get out of here. "Well, thanks," I say again. Draco looks amused at my clearly flustered state. Embarrassed, I move back towards the stairs, Draco following close behind.
'sure, now can i come in to get her stuff,' Cedric stepped aside to let Draco in, not before making sure his shoulder would hit Draco's as he passed.
the key haley gave me was useless. all i had to go was go in, grab her stuff and get out, but i have a feeling that it wasn't going to be that easy.
He looks at me, his eyes dark and intense. "I'm surprised you're here, I half expected you to blow me off."
'well let's just get this over and done with, i don't have all day you know.' draco said sharply while turning to face harry.
"oh, only a few hours?" His voice light as he teases me. i can feel him stir with interest beneath my hips. 'i think we can do better than that."
Malfoy brushes past me and I hear him talking softly to Cedric and then the sound of the front door opening and closing.
so I've come up with a manageable schedule and I've decided I will upload twice a week maybe more if I have the motivation, but I will be uploading Christmas drarry one shots in December!
By the time 5 o'clock rolls around, I am so ready to head home. Naturally, because today is not my day, I end up having to work past when I'd usually leave.  When the last person is finally seen, the four of us meet outside our offices and high five each other.
I grab his hand and squeeze. Together, we walk into the hospital and head for the private treatment rooms. Doctor Klein is waiting for us, the door open wide. He raises an eyebrow at me as Cedric enters.
I drop my glasses onto the side table and rub tiredly at my eyes. I can hear our bed calling me. My bones ache and I am so very done for the day.
however during the second week of december he had caught a cold, he was too tired to protest anymore so i took this as my chance.
once they had appeared to have finished they both had a cheesy grin on their faces, they turned to face us while holding hands then draco said cockily,
sweet merlin, he was looking at me, instantly i felt a blush spread across my cheeks. Standing here, my cosy life with Cedric felt a million miles away. there were no words were needed. he moved towards me, with a determined pace, i saw his eyes turn black with desire.
I look down at the teacup in my hands. "I would rather not find out," I admit. "I know that makes me a coward, but..." I let my sentence trail off.
Cedric laughs as he places kisses around my jaw, and I close my eyes in pleasure. 'Do you have to work today?'he asks as his teeth nip at my throat.
ohh right cedric. my boyfriend of 5 years whom i know live with (am i using that right or is it who?) i mean there isn't anything wrong with looking at dashingly hot men right. it's not like i'm going to do anything.
'well, ok if you're sure.' she still had that concerned look on her face. "You've seemed pretty out of it for a couple of days now."
"And listen to your body." He tells me sharply. "If you need to sleep - sleep . Your body knows what it needs to do to keep you and that baby healthy."
I pause to quickly poke my head into the bar area. There's a small crew of people working diligently, re-setting tables and chairs.
Eventually, the door swings open and Malfoy stands there wearing a loose fitting pair of black silk shorts, shirtless and his hair mused as if he just got out of bed. Maybe he has.
she gives me a doubtful look but turns away and leave. but by friday cedric has booked me an appointment to see our doctor. he ignores all my protests and assurances that i'm actually fine, thank you very much.
I'm so consumed with panic, I miss a knock at the door and only come too when an angry female bar owner slams her hand on my desk, her face screwed up in a snarl.
I arrived at the hospital without a minute to spare and once I had made my way to the reception the doctor was ready.
its not as if anyone has a problem with who you love but we have to marry as the contract was made as soon as ginny was born.
I wanted to tell her that this, this human life growing inside of me was so much better than some ring.
We were shown the building first seen as all the apartments Draco looked at were in the same place. I found out there was a gym, spa, sauna and a pool included if you lived here. I could already tell that it would be too expensive and I couldn't afford any of these even with Draco's help, since he would live here as well.
I'm not sure how lying down is supposed to make me feel better, but OK. I lie down on the hard leather and feel, well, less dizzy.
So i've planned the rest of the story and it will end in chapter 20, so for us in the uk we go back to school march 8th, hopefully i'll have finished writing this by then but i'm not sure (when i'm writing this it's Thursday) because i have my gcse's next year and we've missed a lot of school so i'll be focusing on that.
I looked around the apartment once more while he was signing the papers, imagining what life living here would be like.
I really didn't want to go back to that house especially because there was a chance that Cedric would be there, I had a feeling that I wouldn't be his most favorite person in the world right now.
Me and Cedric are going to the doctors today for a checkup so it means we can see the baby again. i'll need to make up and excuse to talk to the doctor alone so i can make an appointment for tomorrow.
'Haley,' dr Klein looks at me with a sudden sternness that takes my breath away. 'are you using protection?'
I arrive at the pub with twenty minutes to spare on Saturday. This time, seeing Draco doesn't quite put the fear of Merlin in me, which is an improvement. The bar, of course, is closed, so I head to the employees only entrance.
oh yes. the busiest day of the year. where every pub and club owner comes to get their liquor license renewed, and lucky me i'm the one who gets to do it!!!
after we've finished up at the hospital appointment i tell cedric i want to speak to the doctor privately, having heard what his friends had said about pregnant woman and their mood swings he decided to let it go and said he would wait in the wating room outside for me.
Usually i didn't drink so i would be teased about being a lightweight tomorrow but there was a pleasant buzz i was getting from the alcohol.
things had been going really well for the three and earlier that year they had welcomed their baby girl Lily together, thanks to Ginny who had offered to be their surrogate.
They both laugh at Teddy's antics and think to themselves this is going to be the best christmas yet!
As soon as I'm outside, I breathe in the fresh morning air. I lean against the cold brick wall of the bar and try to asses my situation. I need to keep Draco
"Sorry." He wraps his arms around me, but the tension doesn't leave my body. My eyes are glued to the blonde-haired man sitting in the other chair.
i could of sworn I saw tears of happiness threatening to spill, but he would dismiss them and tell me 'don't get all sentimental on me pottah'
Once Draco was finished we found out we could move in, in less that 3 weeks, turns out the seller really wants to move out. We went home while picking up a take away Indian we passed. I didn't realise how much time had passed until we got home and it was 5pm.
'I guess so.' He crawls towards me on the bed, a mischievous gleam in his eye. ' no I meant to surprise everyone with the news.' I tilt my head up and he kisses me deeply, making me breathless with desire.
once i was finished i checked myself in the mirror incase i had spilled something or had lipstick all over my mouth like lavender who had gotten so drunk she couldn't even put lipstick on (i don't even know why she was invited since mione hates her). i had just dried my hands and was about to leave when the bathroom door opened. alarmed i stumbled back. away from the tall figure that now stood staring at me.
it had caught them both off guard as they were in the middle of a semi-heated argument as we walked out of potions (now taught by Slughorn) when the mistletoe suddenly appeared from the top of the door way causing them to come to a sudden halt as magic bind them there until they kissed.
it had been around 2 weeks since Haley left me and I miss her so much. I thought she would come back after a few hours or at the least to take her stuff away so I didn't have the constant reminder of what she did to me. I did everything for her. I looked after her, I mean we were trying for a baby. But she cheated on me. And I still love her.
when they first did this, harry thought it would be a one time thing until the next christmas came around and teddy asked if we could get a bauble for Harry's parents since it's only fair that they got one for his.
i stare down at my paperwork and barely stifle a yawn, my bones are heavy, i feel my eyelids threatening to close, letting my head drop to the table i glance at the clock and see i've got 6 hours left, until i can go home, change into some baggy clothes and sleep.
I breathe out a small sigh of relief as Draco pushes himself off the wall, turning to open the door. I follow him inside. There's a quiet hum of chatter, the sound of chairs scraping against the hard floor.
when they got back with warm cream lights, matching rose gold and white baubles and a new frosted-snow green tree they got started.
"I need to lock up after you go," he explains. Right, that makes sense. I hurry down the stairs, forgetting how awful they are.
'hey' I say confused and walk over to his chair to see what he's looking at, that has him so captivated.
i braced myself for them but when the curtain was pulled back i saw none other than Draco Malfoy prince of Slytherin.
It was a thing I would regret instantly but I did it anyway. I felt bad for kicking her out I was just so mad with what we did. Our whole relationship gone.
Cedric's desperate to break the news to his father and it's the cutest thing to watch. Every morning he picks up the bears on the dresser and excitedly says 'i can't believe we're going to be a family like this!' he has a sappy smile on his face and i can't help but smile at him.
At first Draco was confused with why they got a single new bauble each year ; until Teddy realised that Harry hadn't told Draco about the bauble.
dr Klein looks at me with pity in his blue eyes, "I'm sorry to tell you, but yes, you can get pregnant by having sex just once, If you're having sex without protection, you risk becoming pregnant." He looks stern again.
"Have you ever thought about telling him the truth?" He walks to the kitchen and a comes back a teapot and two cups in his arms.
Now Christmas is over I'm hoping to get more chapters out quicker, also in the UK we are having to isolate for 2 weeks before we go back to school so I should have more time to write.
he turns the laptop to show me a Pinterest board of nursery ideas, all based around 'gender neutral' tones.
i walk aimlessly up and down the isles still wearing my work clothes, i spot two beige bears holding a baby bear; without a second thought i bought them deciding this is the way that i would break it to ced.
but it also means for my group presentation I have to do it on my own and my English presentation I have to do while others don't.
I arrived at the hospital without a minute to spare and once I had made my way to the reception the doctor was ready.
i was laying in bed lost in thought when cedric awoke, still unaware he was awake i almost jumped out of my skin when i felt his hand come to life and cup my stomach.
I move silently through the house, my wand held tightly in my palm. The quietness of the house has me feeling tense, alert.
The question takes Cedric by surprise and for a moment he's speechless, then once he's processed what i said Laughter bubbles up from inside of him, and he's quickly holding his stomach as he laughs.
finally the pieces click into place and Cedric all but throws himself at me, still careful of my stomach. He buries his face in my auburn hair (just like my mums) and we laugh, wild and free. The future seems brighter and happier than ever before. Dinner lays forgotten on the table as Cedric takes my hand land leads me into the bedroom.
The following morning, I decide the best way to handle Malfoy  is to talk to him head-on. I send a message to Ginny, letting her know I won't be in the office that morning due to a Doctor's visit. Then I head straight to the peacock .
I woke up to a light nudge on my shoulder, once I had rolled onto my side I saw that it was Draco. It took me a second to recall what happened last night however my train of thoughts were interrupted 'I brought you some tea and thought we could go for breakfast before we go to look around some house and apartment since the baby can't grow up here'. He placed the cup of tea into my hands and started to walk towards the door before stopping and turning around, 'oh and, drink your tea and get ready since it's already 10.' With that he left me alone in his room with a cup of tea and an overthinking mind.
'hypothetically' I rudely interrupt, not wanting to face the music and realise that there is a fair chance that the baby could be his,
we didn't see them for the rest of the day; they we're also late for breakfast the following morning.
Malfoy sighs, "I don't want to be an asshole, but I take my responsibilities seriously." He looks at me sternly. " If the child is mine, then I want to be a father. You can't deny me that."
"Excellent!" My voice is so bright it sounds fake even to my ears. "You just need to sign this then." I pull the required piece of parchment out of the folder and pass it over him.
soon after that i leave the room and me and cedric leave, I make up some excuse about periods and pregnancy; he buys it.
ever since me and pansy had gotton together late october we have been spending alot of time with the silver trio which meant harry and draco had to be in close proximity for long periods of time, we all thought they would fight but instead there was a strange sexual tension between the two, they would make sense together: me and pansy are together and so are ron and blaise, also they are both really obvious with how they're always staring at  when they think no ones looking,
"I'd want to know," he says, "if I was the husband. You can't work on a relationship if people are keeping important secrets like that."
the next time we saw each other at their engagement party he pulled me into a corner and said the strangest thing to me
I can't get to sleep, knowing that tomorrow I can find out who the baby's father is. Cedric had to go back to work this afternoon which gave me just enough time to go and get the swab from Draco and deliver it to the hospital, which suprisenly he was cooperative about. As soon as we had got home cedric had already fallen asleep so it gave me chance to get his swab, so I already had his.
All previous thoughts about Draco disappear to the back of my head until the next morning when this whole madness starts again.
'what?' he asked clearly he knew what I was trying to say. After my lack of response he asked me again.
"Thank you." I can feel myself starting to sweat. Why won't he just leave? I snatch the finished license off my desk and shove it under his nose.
I walk through the employee entrance through to the apartment upstairs avoiding the subtle buzz of conversation from the late lunchers.
The rest of the week passes surprisingly smoothly. It's as if we're walking on clouds. Yesterday, Ginny asked to look at my hands, thinking Cedric had proposed!
Draco's at work until 6 tonight, its unbelievable that he has to work on Christmas eve, he's the head auror so If something happens he has to be there.
I feel a light blush spread to my cheeks, I take a moment to gather myself then say, 'well thank you for that but I best me off, Cedric is making stir fry.'
i'm not sure when i'll upload next i seem to be getting writers block for the first time and i've lost all motivation for this story.
"Aren't you going to invite me in?" I am not going to fight with him. I am going to be a grown-up. For now.
That night, as Cedric sleeps curled next to me, his hand splayed across my stomach my mind strays to the bar, and the stranger I face can no longer remember. The man's face has become blurred in my mind, I can't recall any of his features. Tall, short, handsome, ugly—I can't be sure.
She had Harrys tan skin (thanks to his fathers side) and Draco's cold grey eyes. Her features were a mix of both but thanks to ginny she got auburn red hair. She looked almost the same as harry's mum.
Oh no. Oh no . hermione's birthday. That hot guy at the bar. Cedric. My head swims and for a moment I feel dizzy. Shit. Shit. Shit .
We cross into the centre of the room where Malfoy drops into a worn brown leather sofa. There's a matching armchair nearby, so I sit down on that.
"Mhm," is the best I can do in response. I have a sudden image of me, walking up those stairs with a cranky toddler in tow. I throw an arm over my eyes, nope. That is a horrifying image. No child is going to want to climb those stairs.
Over the next few weeks they would spend time putting together their apartment with each other; conveniently ignoring the thing that was between them.
A hazy image of me, pinned against a bathroom wall, my legs wrapped around a strangers waist as he pumps into me fills my mind. I instantly pale. "Yes."
By the time I arrive at work only an hour late, my department is swamped. Fantastic. We're crammed into the smallest building which usually isn't much of an issue. With me are Ginny; Greyson, a new boy a few years younger than me, and Beverly, a quiet girl from Ginny's year.
i haven't ever been one for one night stands, especially when i'm already in a committed relationship; but the feel of his hands on my hips, his mouth nipping, licking and sucking my throat. his strong but delicate  hands pushing my top apart and tracing over my stomach. i felt helpless against his touch.
once I had finally got to sleep around 4, my head was buzzing with what if's but I put them at the back of my head as they we're future me's problem.
"Would the cheating break his heart, or would the baby not being his do it?" Malfoy asks. His voice is losing the thickness it had as he wakes up.
'Drink this you'll feel better' Cedric pushes a glass of water and a paracetamol into my hands. i shove them in my mouth and gulp down the water and almost instantly my headache eases.
'Haley', Ginny appears around the door. 'are you ready for tomorrow it's our favourite day again' she says, voice dripping with sarcasm.
Once I've calmed down the tea is cold, Draco obviously in shock mumbles something about making some more and heds off to the kitchen again.
Once I've greated him I can't take this any longer, I lead him over to the living room, the test results firmly held next to my side.Once we've sat I turn to face him, giving him the first sight of the white envelope before saying.
I drive home, hitting about as much traffic as i possibly can. when i get in i ditch my coat throwing it messily on the sofa. Cedric is going to have a fit when he sees it.
"It does," I agree softly. I tear my eyes away from the bar, so I can see Draco more clearly. "You've done a great job on this place."
