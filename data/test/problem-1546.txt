He looks around and sure enough, he’s crushed Draco underneath him. His heart stops as he falls back to his knees, rolling him over so Harry can see his face.
“How the fuck did you beat me?!” He asks a few minutes later. Malfoy sank all of his ships and Harry only managed to sink one. He shakes his head in frustration.
to return his feelings. Now the question is though, what does he do about it? Draco has never been good with coming to terms about things, especially where emotions are concerned. That’s why he’d rather ignore things, push them aside. He’s done that quite a bit lately.
Draco is already watching him, smiling fondly as Harry takes in the other couples around the table. Harry grins at him, squeezing his hand and lifting it to his mouth. Draco’s returning beam takes Harry’s breath away, and he has to close his eyes for a moment. Even after being married for two years, and together for another four, Harry still finds it hard to breathe around him.
Rain slams heavily onto the roof of Hogwarts, and wind is throwing parchment around everywhere. The First Years scream as a particularly loud clap of thunder rings in our ears. The storm was supposed to be a quick and quiet affair. No such luck, though. It immediately became clear that it was going to be a tough day to get anything done. Walking through the undercover corridor from the Herbology greenhouses back into the castle, I’m worried that the Third Year I’m meant to be meeting with again today will cancel on me. Not that he needs much help, he is a natural at Potions, even if he pretends otherwise. Regardless, I make my way through the passages and down into the stone walls that surround the Potions Classroom. I push into the door and step into the cold room. My footsteps echo through the class, and I place my books onto the teacher’s desk at the front of the class. I start to set up the equipment that we’ll use today, and wait quietly for the boy to make an appearance.
Draco shakes his head to hide his own smile. He doesn’t need Harry learning how soft Draco’s become recently. And when did he start calling him ‘Harry’ anyway?
Harry nods. “That makes sense. I don’t know what else there could be though… We’ll have to think on it.”
It’s shit, he knows it is, but it will do until he can think of something better. What’s even happened since they’ve arrived? He honestly can’t remember much. This may be a problem.
“Thank you,” someone says over the noise. It rings out, and shuts off. I turn to look at the voice, and see that it belongs to Kingsley Shacklebolt. “Now that we appear to be protected, it’s time to leave. Your Portkeys will begin to activate within the next two minutes. There are no spares. Make sure everyone is holding on tight, we don’t know what we will see when we get there.”
The parmigiana is really good, and Harry finishes his bite before answering. “I actually hadn’t started it when I spilled water all over it,” he confesses. “It’s supposed to be about a man who becomes possessed by some vengeful spirit, and tries to take over the world.”
As Harry goes about getting changed and brushing his teeth, he tries not to think about how he’s going to sleep in the same sheets Malfoy wanked in this morning. He doesn’t succeed very well, and the fact that Malfoy definitely cast cleaning charms after being interrupted doesn’t sway his mind at all. He brushes his hair—as he does
I sigh. “I do, but I’m not sure I’ll manage.” It feels weird, saying these words aloud. Harry would swat them away and assure me that we’ll figure it out, but Mother will be honest.
“Hold on,” he says, raising a hand to stop Draco starting on whatever rant he’s aching to go on. “If the cotton and leather are for the second and third year, and the bracelet is for the first, we’ve completed a set!”
By the time Harry is out of the forest and sprinting down the cottage’s path, he is very out of breath. He isn’t quite sweating, but he imagines that he would be if not for the cold. As it is, his skin is flushed pink. Snow flies out from beneath his feet as he approaches the door, and he allows himself to exhale in relief when his hand collides with it. He’s here. Except, there’s one problem. One big problem, that will need to be dealt with before going inside. The door is nearly snowed under.
The boy hurries to retrieve the indicated goods, and Draco lifts an eyebrow at Harry. He just smiles in return, and while it makes Draco’s stomach fuzzy with something not entirely horrible, it doesn’t answer his silent question.
“Exactly,” Draco agrees, a jolt rushing through him at the memory of that morning’s paper. “I just want people to see me for who I am, and not what my father did.”
cursed after all—and then be teleported to a forest? With the most annoying man on earth, just to make matters worse. And okay, maybe Potter’s better than he used to be when they were in school, but he’s still a far cry from good company. And yes, maybe he’s filled out and has lost his ‘half-starved for eleven years’ look, but he’s nowhere near as strong as the other Aurors. Draco thinks. He’s not entirely sure on that fact, because as it turns out, most of the work he does happens to be with Potter.
It is the first quidditch match of the term, and the castle is bubbling with excitement. It’s the Gryffindor vs Slytherin game, and all the students are in red or green. Well, everyone but the Slytherins and a couple others are in red. This doesn’t surprise me, these games are more of a popularity contest when it comes to the crowd, than the actual player’s skills. And I know that Gryffindor is the favourite by far.
!” Potter swears, gently shoving him in an imitation of their past fights. Only this time, there’s no real malice behind the action, and Draco’s stomach burns with something he doesn’t want to acknowledge.
The student at the front of the line is trying to cast some complex charm, and keeps sending sparks flying from the end of her wand. She flicks her blonde hair off her shoulder again, before raising her arm. After another failed attempt, Professor Falco calls out, “Miss Brocklehurst. If you could please sit down and maybe your partner could try the spell?” The Ravenclaw nods sullenly before stalking off to her friend.
Malfoy anymore, but he definitely doesn’t like him. And just because he’s realised that, doesn’t make him think any higher of the blond man.
“Someone close to me made what they thought was a mistake of their own, but really the only problem was the way I reacted.” Harry fixes his gaze on Draco, sitting at the Slytherin table and growing steadily redder.
“You sound like a MediWitch,” I scoff, before knocking back each of the vials. I scowl at the last one, a disturbing blue liquid which tastes like bile.
His head rockets up and a goofy grin crosses his features. He shuffles over in his bed and taps it, gesturing for me to sit down next to him. I roll my eyes.
Draco makes his way over to the village. He wouldn’t lay a finger on Potter. Not only would he be sent to Azkaban for harming the Saviour, but he’d also be risking their working relationship. Draco actually quite likes him, as much as he tries to deny it to everyone. The village looks gorgeous, right out of a photograph. Smiling softly, he walks up to the nearest building and finds a path down the middle of a strip of shops. They look like little local stores, people depending on them to survive. Something feels slightly off though, and he can’t put his finger on it. He can’t see any form of signage anywhere on the exterior of the building, but it is made out of red bricks and has a black roof. The black seems to come from dirt though, so what it was before is anyone’s guess.
“She’s breathing, Malfoy.” His stunningly green eyes sparkle, an unusual sight these days, unlike from our earlier years at Hogwarts.
in. Harry sighs, rubs at the back of his neck. He fucked up yesterday, and something needs to change
“Then let’s open it!” I exclaim, almost tripping over myself to move closer. Too close, really. Oh well. This is important, and I refuse to feel stupid for standing to close to Potter. Honestly.
After Apparating as close as possible to the estate without entering its wards, Draco and Potter start walking up the long, paved driveway. Draco doesn’t understand why manors need driveways, but they all seem to have one. Even the Manor does. From his understanding, driveways are muggle things for something they have called ‘cars’. He’d quite like to see a car someday, but his father would roll over in his cheap grave if he ever did see one.
Draco’s stomach lurches as he picks up his speed, trying to follow Harry’s pace. Harry looks back at him, checking to see if he’s okay, before he’s running again. Draco groans, thinking not for the first time that he’s not as fit as he should be, and jogs on behind him.
Malfoy looks like he’ll say no and tell Harry to piss off, but then he clasps his own around it and shakes it. Harry tries to tell himself that Malfoy’s hand isn’t really soft and that it doesn’t matter if it
“I’d rather give you a gift, I think,” Harry murmurs, pressing a kiss to the top of Draco’s head. His hands slide into his hair, playing with the strands and making Draco sigh in contentment. He loves his hair being played with, and he’d be more than happy to sit here all day.
“Oh, why do you have to bring your feelings into everything?!” I snap, suddenly annoyed. His eyebrows both rise, and he glances quickly to the side Berle staring back at me. He shudders and starts off around the room once more. This time he doesn’t ask for my opinion, instead just telling me exactly what he wants.
“Hey,” Harry murmurs. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it like that.” He can’t stand seeing Malfoy closed off to him.
Harry very slowly lifts his hands, moving them up to rest on Draco’s legs. When he doesn’t move, just keeps sleeping, Harry gathers more courage. He drags his hands up Draco’s back, over his shirt and the skin of his neck, and into his hair. It’s silky and smooth, perfectly soft despite the rest of Draco’s body being covered in splotches of paint. Harry’s nose crinkles as he remembers that fact, shooting cleaning charms at Draco to wipe away the paint and anything else on his skin. After a second, Harry casts one on himself as well.
My wings are totally gone. Vanished from existence. I feel awful. The steady stream of food, sun, water, and air being spoon-fed to me isn’t enough. My mother is blaming herself, and I can’t stand seeing her beyond her right mind. I start praying to a god I don’t believe in for Potter to arrive.
Draco looks around, eyes scanning over the floor of the hole. When he fell in, the net over the hole caved inwards. The leaves and sticks covering the net and hiding it from view collapsed, and some tumbled into the dirt trap. Now, there are sticks littering the floor. Some are broken and too short to be useful, but some are long and look quite sturdy. Draco stumbles across the hole and gathers as many of these ones as he can. They dig into his skin and rip his clothes into tatters, but he manages to collect a few. The branches are wet and sodden, feeling almost slimy against his hands. He’s going insane, but this might work; he has to try.
Hours pass of us sitting kind of near, but also kind of far, from each other. I get through the first few chapters and become hooked, and Potter has been taking messy notes with a weird muggle
. He can’t afford to keep dancing around what he’s feeling, not when Draco so obviously feels the same way.
They begin putting the groceries away, and Malfoy quickly makes cheese toasties out of the new ingredients. When Harry bites into his once the shopping is away, he nearly moans at how good it tastes. Malfoy looks very smug at the nonverbal praise, and takes a bite of his own.
. Harry’s stomach flutters with something suspiciously like joy, and he tries to stamp it down as he passes Malfoy a plate. Malfoy’s eyes fall to the offered treat, and he sniffs again.
An hour and a lovely shower later, Draco and Harry are leaving the cottage. The path is totally clear of snow now, and Draco wonders when they might get some again. He’s always loved snow at Christmas, even though it can get really annoying if not taken care of properly. Judging by Harry’s face, he feels the same way.
“About bloody time,” Ron grumbles, stepping forward from the back corner where I created my duplicate.
friends behind it. Pansy has this thing where she thinks danger brings out emotions faster and what not. I don’t think it makes much sense, but there was something about desperat—” Draco cuts off, hiding his face in his hands. “Sorry, I’m rambling.”
When I duck back in, I gently shake Pansy awake and tell her to get dressed. She thanks me and walks to the bathroom. I sit back down in my seat and, instead of looking out the window, I glance out into the corridor again. I take note of who’s sitting close to me, and if it’s worth trying to eavesdrop into any conversations. That’s when I see him. I scratch the back of my head and sharpen my ears. Potter’s saying something about changes that the eighth grade will have to deal with this year.
Draco sighs, tugging the blankets up higher. He’s freezing, body shaking. There’s no way it was this cold a few minutes ago. Then again, he was in front of a fire. Draco grunts, rearranging himself and trying to get comfortable while not allowing any of the cold into the bed. He’s going to turn to ice in his sleep, but there’s not much he can do.
Draco’s legs fall open further, and Harry slides into the gap he’s created. He licks and nips at the sensitive skin, feeling Draco’s muscles clench and twitch under his mouth. Harry makes his way up, nearing his hips and the hard cock still hidden. He nuzzles the area around it, refusing to touch Draco. He breathes hotly over it though, his breath dampening the fabric. Draco sighs, his hands sinking back into Harry’s hair. He mumbles broken pleas, and Harry licks across the band of his pants.
him in. Fire floods Harry’s veins as his lips meet Draco’s. His fingers twitch, and he threads them into Draco’s breath-taking hair. The kiss turns hot very quickly, and Harry struggles to keep up as Draco slides his tongue against Harry’s. He’s going dizzy with it, burning from the inside out. His stomach flips as Draco slides his hands from his collar to the back of his neck, pulling him even closer.
He picks himself back up, rubbing his arm gingerly and wincing at the pain it sends smarting up to his shoulder. He’s going to have to heal that. Hopefully Draco still has some of his potions with him. He doesn’t think the other ones are going to cover this. At least it’s not bleeding.
“Not even your mother? What about your friends?” Harry’s heart sinks at the thought of him spending Christmas alone, feeling totally unwanted.
does. He smells amazing, something Harry could get lost in. Harry hums, licking around the head before taking it into his mouth. He groans as it hits his tongue and he puts on a show for Draco, hollowing his cheeks. Draco’s hips twitch, and Harry holds him in place roughly.
“I see you’ve finally arrived, Potter.” Malfoy draws the short sentence out impossibly long, his nose tilted into the air. “Make it a habit to be late?”
He strips his clothes off quickly and pulls on his pyjamas, not wanting to freeze to death before getting into bed. The nights are so bloody cold. Draco shivers, skin prickling into goosebumps even as he dives under the covers and piles them up. He pulls them over his shoulders, only realising as he buries his face in the pillow that the sheets were never cleaned this morning. They smell like Potter.
“They are in the living room too, Draco. Another 30 at least.” Harry’s words cut off for a second, as he presumably looks around from the vent. “I don’t know any faces, but names could be another story.”
Malfoy huffs a small laugh. “Not very. We work together five days a week, but we don’t really talk about ourselves, you know? The only time we really speak is when we’re drunk, which means we don’t remember any of it.”
Draco gasps in surprise, Potter’s hand encircling his throat but not digging into his windpipe. The balance is… not entirely uncomfortable. He heaves in a breath, and then targets the joint connecting Potter’s thumb to his hand and presses down. Potter’s hand gives way and Draco pushes him back before scrambling over to him. He straddles Potter’s thighs and pins him to the sofa, trapping his wrists and locking his ankles over Potter’s own.
Thankfully, when he looks around and wanders to the back of the store, he finds a rather large cosmetics and bathing section. Draco relaxes slightly as he walks through the aisle, taking in the colours and bright smiles of the models. One thing Draco has never understood about Muggles, is the way they cling to unrealistic beauty standards. No one’s teeth are
Instantly, his hands start sweating and his heart rate picks up. He needs to get over this. He’s been in this forest so many times this last week that the feeling of unease should be gone. If anything though, it’s only increased from the last time. Those witches and wizards still plague his thoughts, and he really needs to talk about it and get it out of his system. Normally, he’d do that in the way of theories and planning with Ron—or Malfoy, whenever they’re partnered together for work—and he’d manage to work everything out. He couldn’t do that though, so he had tried to write everything out. It hadn’t worked that well. He doesn’t usually write out memories without viewing them again in his Pensieve, and Harry would give basically anything to get his hands on it right now.
He can tell the truth or twist it a little bit but when he looked at his godfather, he saw him eyeing him warily.
“Thank you, Harry” he whispered, tilting his head to look at the man who’s been one of his sources of joy and freedom.
The next morning, with a determined perseverance to finish the job, Draco woke up early and got to the shower. He wore the disguise he wore yesterday, the wig and made sure it won’t come off with a simple whip of the hair.
Draco holds his breath as Harry takes in the request, his eyebrows rising up his forehead. He doesn’t know why he said that. There’s no way in hell Harry would willingly set foot in the Manor, would want to go with him to the place Granger was tortured, where Dobby was killed. Draco holds his hands up, shaking his head.
“Yes. The scar. Go to St. Mungos and get it removed.” Draco can’t concentrate on anything with Harry standing so close to him, utterly unaware of the effect he is having on Draco.
“Demelza! Watch it!” I twist towards the voice who warned her, and scowl at Weasley. He must be getting agitated, not being able to block our scores, so now he’s warning his players. Robins ducks out of the way, the Bludger missing her by mere centimetres.
Alex is agender, and they’re absolutely gorgeous. They’d been worried for a time that their lack of gender would prevent them finding someone, but Theo had fallen for them ridiculously quickly. Harry is so glad for them both, even if Theo receives many unwanted questions and comments about his sexuality because of it. People always ask if he’s actually
He whined when Harry pulled his lips away from his but immediately latched onto his jaw down to his neck, sucking deep and hard, his hips rolling to Draco’s thigh, letting him feel that huge cock already so hard for him.
He sighed, leaning his head on top of Ginny’s resting against his shoulder. He came here for some silence, to think clearly and putting images into appropriate words. He might as well be a poet by now.
“Kingsley had offered me to be Minister but I refused because I still sometimes think I am not ready for that kind of responsibility”
“I’m loving this song” he murmured, head tilting down. His mouth close to her ear and he was half tempted to kiss on her earlobe, pull it between his teeth but it was no time for that. It’s no time for that yet.
He had given up all reason. He let himself get drowned by lust and seduction. He had grown obsessed with the ass of a certain Slytherin who should be out there, partying with people his age but instead, he's here at his own home, kneeling and sucking an older man’s huge cock.
He played with the end of his clothes, eyes casted downwards and trying to make a thought of what sensibility left in his mind.
As they fell into a smooth conversation, he completely ignored his boyfriend beside him. Luke knows his way into conversations and Draco found himself giggling and laughing at the jokes thrown over his way.
Dracy weighed her choices. She wished her good life back when everything in her life fell apart, didn’t want people touching her especially when they only see her as a pussy to have but now, from days staying with Harry’s, he provided her a new outlook of what and where she’s in.
He wouldn't risk Draco and his promise to Mrs. Malfoy. Harry always do his work flawlessly and pour all of what he can. And if only he can also cast the shielding charm to himself so he wouldn't be lured in the daring appeal of the young boy he's guarding, he will.
As she was busy wondering, Harry reappeared within a pop with a sorry expression on his face, “Shit! Sorry baby! I forgot to apparate you with me!”
"You look gorgeous, Dray!" Daphne spoke and raised her glass before turning to look at Draco's company, "You brought us desert, I see"
The walk was a smooth sailing, Harry’s hand tightening for a fraction as they reached a black door, opened slightly ajar with a faint noise coming from inside.
Surely, he saw the two practically joined hip to hip and avoiding anyone’s attention, trying to make themselves appear smaller. Parkinson have grown to be such a beautiful woman with exquisite taste of fashion but there was something distinctive plastered on her face.
He shook his head in time with the concessionaire who was smiling at them both. He felt a bit of deja vu with what happened but tried to brush it off.
Draco smacked him at the back of his head. Is this man seriously his superior? Who the hell acts so obvious in espionage? Why did Kingsley think it’s okay to partner him with the embodiment of noisy apocalypse?
She followed, eyes following him when he moved from his place. He stood at the right side of the bed before leaning down, one knee above the mattress.
Harry cleared his throat. Confrontation just turned into confession. That really took an unexpected turn.
She gulped at the tickling but relaxing sensation. The way the omega side of her reacted to the simple touch and unintentionally, her rigid body loosen up a bit.
He raised his hand, cupping his cheeks before letting it fall down and gripped his neck, “What do you say, kitten?”
“Re, ohh, fuck! Re!” Sirius moaned loudly, sobbing as he scrambled his hands to hold onto Remus’ bicep, “Love, shit”
When they heard footsteps approaching, Harry was fast to pull out and set him on his feet which immediately collapsed.
James blurted out, his voice coming out in a panic whisper, his vision as if it’s only seeing white, “And a nice sedative, please”
He’s never got a flirty customer before and if this escalates worse, he’s afraid to make a scene and cause problems for Harry and his business.
The words wrecked every cell in his brain, it messed with him worse than the clashing of whats and hows.
He failed to respond to Harry’s kiss as he closed his eyes, sobbing and temporarily forgetting anything else rather than the buzzing in his ear and the groans coming out from Harry.
He legs threatened to close around Harry’s waist but he somehow managed to keep them apart, determined to lay there open like he wants to. This is what he wants, to have the all too good Senator in the bed, have his way with him.
He signed to Andy for the baby and he swelled with pride when he saw Dracy cradling the baby close to her chest and trying to give their little beanie a kiss on the forehead but was obviously failing.
“Hmp” he softly whined and stared at the book he’s holding. He’s not even reading, he’s just looking. His attention is wandering around Harry and those hands, those lips, those eyes, that bird’s nest, and that sexy body. That so goddamn sexy beard that somehow managed to look so attractive on him.
He never knew enemy kisses like this was good. He could get addicted. His own kind of cocaine. That doesn’t sound so bad now, doesn’t it?
It wasn’t until Harry was on the twentieth page of the book when he noticed that Dracy was already sleeping on her side. A hand clasped around his shirt as she tried to tuck her body closer to him.
Then Cho, Cedric, Goyle, Lavender, Terry, Crabbe, a frowning Daphne and Astoria then the Weasley twins. All of them handing single stems of white roses and slowly forming into circles, all the lights directed to him.
Even when he didn't want to, Draco felt himself blush. He knew his father have made a wrong decision to arrange a marriage with a muggle. Even if the Potter family is considered to be a 'royalty'. This is an absolute mistake. Harry doesn't even look like he possess an ounce of nobility. He looks like a complete playboy, a man who crawls in different beds every night.
His mind raced to plans he can do to snoop around the place. He was sure there can be files hidden inside his penthouse office, ones that could be useful to his father to defeat him next election. Things that can uncover that the Harry Potter the citizens know is not really the Harry Potter inside.
“I think I should know more about the context here but I’m not judging you for it, Harry but you should remember you’re old enough to know what you’re doing” Remus stated and Harry nodded.
She’s just existing for men to invalidate and molest when there are no other willing pussies to fuck.
Things are nice at the present. Why dig some of the past? He came back not to relive the past but try to live on the present. Focus on it, really be with it.
With the enough video as an evidence, he smirked proudly. Now, he thinks he know why Kingsley got him for the job. He’s fucking skilled at this. Leaving where he was hiding, he began to wander around once more.
Fuck. It was so warm and wet and so good. The sensations of his cock engulfed in that wet heat was making his breath hitch and he felt like choking on his own saliva. He groaned lowly when her tongue dipped in his slit and leaked the precum that poured out.
Fuck. His rut is coming. This explains his need to have the omega beside him, under him, and above him. His rut can be aggressive especially when there’s an omega in heat near him, ones that have the scent that can draw out sexual frustrations and need from him.
She gulped when the doorbell rang again. She played with her fingers and looked down to her tummy, sighing when she cannot no longer see her toes. Merlin. How big is their baby going to be?
He closed his eyes and savored the taste of Harry’s precum in his mouth, ignoring the noises Harry is making as he put the head of his cock in his mouth and began to suck shamelessly.
After the attention Harry shamelessly gave her, ignoring the male staff that stood across them, eyes watching their every moves, he put on the shoes, “Tell me if it’s nice and comfortable”
“I informed you two days ago! I informed you yesterday! I informed you before I left for work yesterday!”
And who wouldn't be shocked? If you look at Harry, he looks like he wouldn't bother himself accepting jobs that aren't in his list. He looks like him being a Head Auror is reserved for things that are much more important, given how skillful Harry must be in casting offensive and defensive spells.
“Hey! I juiced some squill bulb! It was you who grabbed the pearl dust” Harry countered, crossing his arms as he looked at him. Heart once again hammering inside his chest as mind supplied beautiful images of the man before him. He doesn't know why and how.
And... it's finished! I had fun writing some fluff and I hope you've enjoyed it too. If you have any thoughts, feel free to drop 'em <3
He went up and straddle Draco’s legs, putting a little bit of weight into it to let Draco know of his position.
“Re” he called, his voice hoarse with all the moans and whimpers, he closed his eyes, loving the way Remus’ movements didn’t falter as he began to chase his own zenith.
He eyed their joined hands, squinting when he noticed how small his was compared to Harry’s. Hmm, that’s a discovery.
But how could he listen to his own set of rules when Draco have been so obscene, filthy and gorgeously tasty as he displayed every bit of his glory.
“He doesn’t look like cockybee to me” Harry murmured beside Draco as they stared at the man who walked in the restaurant, eyes scanning the crowd until it settled on them. A small smile graced his face as a woman followed him from behind.
Whether it be a challenge in the field of their job, a quidditch match, a game in the conference room or this.
He helped her and convinced her not to worry because he will handle it. She was utterly grateful for the man that’s endlessly showing efforts to really make  it up to her. The man that’s making her heart beat erratically, the pool of slick that’s immediately there whenever Harry stares at her with that glint in his eyes.
She bit her lips, hands clenching on the sides of her gown. She was supposed to be teasing him, supposed to be riling him all the way, sucking him out of his proud exterior and strip him off to reveal who really is behind his restricted facade in the public.
Harry grinned deviously. He leaned even more before he inhaled so deep  and took in his memory how this wondrous smell can do to stir his Alpha up. Merlin. He will for sure have another intense wanking session later on.
“I understand what you feel and what you think. I’m sorry for not thinking about that. I was excited to propose and failed to communicate about important matters with you” he smiled, untangling their hands to cup his cheek, “We can come up with a solution, angel. Trust us, okay?”
Not being able to stand his inspection of my face, I pull the great doors in and glide out of the Hall. I walk briskly down the corridor and through to the nearest bathroom. The heavy door slams behind me and I cross the spacious, white and gold bathroom. Stopping in front of the mirror, I turn on the tap and freezing water gushes out. I let it rove over my hands, the water just cold enough to start aching. I splash my abnormally pale face and rake my fingers over my cheeks. I stare into my reflection and watch my Adam’s apple bob as I swallow. The pale skin lifts and drops in time, and I can’t help but think that my throat is quite slender and a bit pink. Ugly by all means. The sound of the door slamming draws me from my stupor, and I rush into a cubicle so as not to be disturbed. Footsteps cross quickly over the floor, sneakers squeaking on the tiles. They stop suddenly, as if the person wearing them is looking around the room. And then the footsteps pick up again, and I hear them approaching my cubicle on the far side of the bathroom. A shadow creeps under the blue door and I try to figure out who it is.
“I love you so much Harry,” Draco says again. Firmer, leaving no room for doubt. “And we are going to fix this.” Draco watches the light fall from Harry’s eyes. “Not fix you,” Draco reassures him, “you don’t need fixing, but this does.” His hand sweeps through the kitchen filled with shattered bottles. Harry’s thrown them in his despair, and the alcohol has been half-heartedly Vanished off the floor, leaving shiny splotches where the tiles haven’t been dried properly.
By the time he has a tiny picture somewhere in the middle, he figures out what it is he’s making. He groans loudly and curses the gods again. It’s the outside of the fucking cottage. Draco barely manages to stop himself tearing the whole thing to shreds. He needs something to do, and removing his source of entertainment would
makes itself known in his gut. Maybe it’s an omen. A sign that he shouldn’t be abusing his body like this, even if it’s to lift some of the strain on his mind. Regardless, Draco keeps looking. Most of the men aren’t his type tonight. Which is a shame, because he really needs to get laid. After dealing with the morons he encounters as a Curse-Breaker and all of their questions, a distraction is sorely needed. A glimpse of pink and purple light catches Draco’s attention, and he turns slightly to catch a glance. The beams are bouncing off of shocking black hair, reflecting them across the room again. The stranger spins quickly around on the spot, and he looks slightly familiar for a second. Shaking it off, Draco makes his way across to him.
“Not here, don’t worry,” he chuckles. “But later. At mine, this time.” Harry’s green eyes are sparkling, and how on earth can Draco say no when that expression is turned to him? Not when Draco has actually realised the effect Harry has on him and the clear-as-day meaning behind it. If he allows himself to indulge just one more time, knowing he’s earned every second of it, well…
“Hey, Potter,” he murmurs, pushing at Harry’s shoulder. It hurts, having to call him by his surname still. All he wants to do is shout ‘Harry!’ from the rooftop and fuck anyone who cares, but he can’t. Not yet. “Wake up.”
“Malfoy! What’s happening? Are you okay?!” Potter starts asking questions, concern and shock in his tone.
Draco huffs but uncrosses his arms, rearranging what’s left of his blankets. “Well, I’m up now, so let’s just forget about it.”
Harry hummed, palm gliding up to caress his arms and consoling with honest forgiveness, “I wronged you just as much, baby. It’s okay now”
She sucked all of his cum and made sure to lick the ones that drip down his softening shaft. After Harry rode out his orgasm, he gently pulled Dracy up and wiped a thumb on the corner of her lips.
It is its own kind of deception. One that gnaws within, caressing the hidden desires and jab at it in the right place at the right time.
Harry returned to the living room to see Dracy sitting properly and is just staring at her hands on her lap. He sighed. Uncovering a wallflower would be too much work. But would be pleasing to watch her bloom.
“Hmm, Already so hard for me, baby. Wet and already so needy” harry smiled before biting down to his jaw, feeling Draco’s eyes on him, “So beautiful. So good for daddy” he praised, grinning as Draco hitched a breath.
She played with Harry’s hair, twirling it between her fingers. Not bothering to make a sound because she knew all he needed is silence.
He saved her from that crampy, dirty, barely surviving place. He saved her from millions of prying eyes, disgusting hands, dirty and bastard Alphas, he saved her from thousands of pain. But who did save him? No one. And here she was demanding some attention when it was him who needed it the most.
He moaned as Harry began to fuck him ruthlessly, his huge cock hitting just right and all the nerves inside him, prodding more precum out of his own, “Harder, faster, please”
He turned around and grabbed a shirt on the floor before returning back to stand on the foot of the bed. He was glad when he saw Sirius already in his knees, following what he ordered. He handed him the shirt and gestured for him to wear it.
“Make yourself cum on my voice, kitten. Want to see you cum undone on my voice only. Could you do that for me?”
He leaned more into the touch and sighed softly, “I wanted to but this is our last time at Hogwarts so I’m thinking of staying”
He met some omegas in his way back to his department. Smiling at him and some waved at him seductively which he did not give any mind to. There’s only one omega in the Ministry Harry wants.
, fuck, let me cum” she begged again, body trembling from all the stimulation and let out a surprise mewl when he encircled one arm around her waist and pulled her up.
Draco relaxed himself and listened, beginning to feel drowsy even at the beginning, his hands tightening around Harry’s hand on his waist.
Harry smiled and exchanged goodbyes before he walked back to his office, stopping at the sight of Hermione.
He looked up from his place at the Astronomy Tower and saw Ginny smirking at him, sitting down beside him and letting her feet dangle on the railings like Harry’s are.
His father gulped, visibly not knowing what to say before sighing and bowing his head low, “I’m sorry”
Sirius butted in and gave Harry a wink, “That’s another problem, Moony. How should he approach the kid? How should he open the topic?”
It felt as if his body is sparkling with joy, alight with very bit of pretty fireworks, not exploding but comforting him with its beauty, his whole body shouts nothing but Harry’s name. His mouth letting out little noises of appreciation and adoring amazement he has for the man. His fingers wrapped around his reason of his smiles and the happiness blooming over his chest. Merlin, he's so deep in it.
He tilted his head as he suddenly forgot his favorite kind. Mocha cappucino? Or what? Is there a hot chocolate here? Flat white? Ristretto? Machiato?
He cannot let himself be that sanctimonious, prideful, popularity feeding bastard that’ll hear no end from Mrs. Weasley and Hermione.
The feeling he’s beginning to familiarize with is still there, shining if Harry’s close and glowing whenever they are touching. He was beginning to associate themselves with the potion. What if they’re waiting faraway when the answer is just right there all along? Just needs to figure it out?
“Just you wait, baby boy. When I get out of this, I will fuck you so hard, make you scream whose you are, fuck you everywhere until you’re limping and drooling”
Harry removed his robes and left his self shirtless before joining the boy into the bed, he rested a hand beside Draco’s head, carrying his weight while the other touched him by the legs, slowly trailing upwards to his milky thighs to his hips, to his small waist.
“The potion, Professor. Back in the hospital wing you said… you said it’s harmless and we might act strange” he toyed with his fingers, “But the thing is, I’ve also been feeling strange”
Unable to control himself, Draco stilled on his seat and lips parted for a bit. His eyes changed from pain to a soft brush of something Harry cannot describe. There’s more than sadness, more than the blues from what happened. They somehow managed to retain warmth and adoration.
It was an office. He fist bumped the air as he smiled. See? He’s fucking good at this. He went to the desk and grabbed any papers he find useful enough and stole the laptop. Go big or go home. That’s what he’s doing.
Harry’s eyes darkened when Draco’s lip parted, his chest rising up and down quickly. Draco gripped his shorts into his fist and looked back at Harry.
“Legs wider for me, princess” he ordered to which Draco immediately did, chest heaving, feeling  Harry’s hard cock pressing to his back.
He resumed his previous pace, palms gliding at her back to the dip in her spine down to cup her ass. Massaging them before landing a spank that has her moaning loudly. The pain mixing with her pleasure spurred her on even more.
She held her chest by the sudden voice. She smiled and nodded, trying to look convincing which she’s sure she wasn’t able to achieve because Harry had his eyebrows furrowed. Taking his steps closer, he opened both of his arms and she did not hesitate to walk into them, burying her face in his rock hard chest and sniffed. There’s a new scent in him. Cinnamon. Something which surprisingly, relaxed her.
Harry knew people hated Lucius and they have been so enthusiastic to pour those grudges into the princess turned beggar of a daughter. Especially with her standing as an omega, she could barely do something to fight for herself.
His gaze followed Ginny’s when they both heard the boisterous conviviality of the eight years. Rowdy as ever, leading the walk and fun were Seamus and Hannah following behind them are the others.
His smile did everything to show how happy he is to wake up like this. This morning filled with nothing but Harry’s spoiling. The kisses he knows he would never get tired of, and that palms gliding over his sticky thighs, still marked with the remnants of their orgasms even when Harry had taken it upon himself to provide him a heartwarming aftercare.
“It’s one of my safe houses. Wily makes sure it’s clean and complete with supplies” Harry responded, following behind her.
Dracy woke up from her nap to see a snack on the bedside table and a note that said Harry will be back early in the evening and she needs to get ready, dress up and little smiley drawing. She smiled at the cuteness of the note.
The man was a balance of both sides. A scale only Draco can trigger and if he pick the wrong choice, he is in for the worst. That he knew.
He buried his face at Draco’s sweaty neck, his tongue peeking to lick some beads sliding down at his throat. He angled his body to nudge at that bundle that reels Draco into his subspace.
Dracy stood in the middle of the living room, not knowing whether to admit to Harry that she doesn’t like to go shopping and have him just magically repair her clothes instead.
He dug his teeth on his lip as he felt the now familiar warm breath on his shoulder, nose skimming along the side of his throat, touching him lightly, fingers dancing along his wrist, various shapes drawn into them.
She bit her lips as her eyes begin to travel down her body. It used to look starved and five meals away from giving up but days living with Harry had done her such wonders. She can see how she filled up nicely and it made her breasts perked up more.
There aren’t any people, not even a shadow. It was peaceful, beautiful, and silent. Far different from Diagon Alley. Far from the gossips she have to endure.
He closed his eyes, feeling as if he has the ability to see what’s happening around him with closed eyes. As if the images were flashing on the darkness that greeted him.
He sighed and decided to finish up his morning jog to go drink for a coffee before taking a bath and go to the Ministry. He expects Draco to follow his instructions that he should stay here and besides, his visit only take half a day and he'll be back just right after lunch.
He leaned forward to remove her ties and pulled his cock out. He did not let her speak as he held her by the waist and flipped her to her knees. She gasped in surprise, propping her upper body with her elbows and throwing her head back as Harry pushed inside without warning.
Harry sighed. That’s the issue. He doesn’t want to be promoted just because he was ‘famous’. He wanted to earn things because he worked for it. True, being privileged is nice but it only feeds on his ego.
She bit her lip as she fought the urge from lying down to take a short nap. Patience, patience. She can rest for as long as she wants when they get back to the house. Their check up today for the beginning of her second trimester is fine. Andy have assured her that her pregnancy is looking good and there’s nothing to worry about.
He heard Draco sobbed and then the rustle of his sheets as if he was standing up which Harry quickly tried to avoid, “Why did you leave last night?”
He clenched his jaw and grimaced at his shirt. An oversized shirt tucked into his pants. Comfortable but not entirely fit for the bar Tom owns. The place is full of short dresses, glittery outfits, and nice designs.
He get onto the desk and opened his legs wide, hearing endless stream of curses from his daddy. He smirked, letting one of his hands wander on his nipples, playing with the hardened bud and rolling it between his fingers. Occasionally playing with it and moaning at how sensitive they are.
He just the person in his dreams. That look, that expression, and his moans. Fuck he wanted to have Draco now.
Particularly, everyone who knows what Draco harbors for Harry thinks he’s just being a childish personification of useless hating. The needle that pops a balloon and the kind of pranks that just annoys instead of making fun.
Draco blushed furiously, “Pansy! That is not what I am expecting” he grumbled, eyes scanning for the familiar rat’s nest.
Draco is wearing a leather skirt, a black and red tie back bandana cami top, and a heeled boots. He looks so fucking delicious. Harry gulped and he raised an eyebrow. Is there by any chance they could just stay here and worship the young boy?
"The south wing is where my parents bedroom is and we wouldn't want to go there if we don't want to see the atrocious things that hid there" Draco shivered as he said those words. (lucissa are kinky af, i just think so).
Perhaps his idea of spending his last year with normalcy isn’t really going to be normalcy. The moment they locked eyes at the Great Hall, he knew something just happened.
“This will be our home,” he motioned around like it was  no big deal and Dracy was already feeling like she’s about to get a heart attack and pop the baby in no time.
He tightened his hold before they began to bask in the silence. He knows Draco must’ve been floating in space. He patiently sat there, with him between his thighs, dropping kisses now and then.
Sirius led them to the back patio where even from a few feet away, Lucius and Narcissa heard some hush voices and the smell of freshly cooked foods.
Maybe it will not fit or maybe it will. Draco will not back down. He bucked his hips to meet Harry’s mouth and his own hang open.
Harry chuckled and pulled him in a kiss, his tongue pushing pass his parted lips and sucking, “Cum for me, sweetheart”
“Yes, yes. I got the star of the night for tonight’s auction,” he grunted, “Money down, Mr. Poh. You’ll get the invitation after it”
He inhaled Harry's scent and he nearly moaned. He didn't bother himself pulling his body away when he noticed the way Harry's breathing started to get heavy and ragged. He's kind of enjoying it as he watches him, little by little, slowly, gradually lost his control and hopefully by the end of the two hours they're going to be in the party, Harry will strip him off of his clothes and have all the wicked ways be done to him in the most pleasurable ways as possible.
"I know. But I really cannot. Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy didn't inform me when they would be coming back so I am assigning you with the raids. I am only here at the Ministry every Wednesday morning" Harry explained.
He tried to ignore the way the silk dress slid between those creamy thighs when he moved to sit down and definitely didn't try to look through his peripheral vision when Draco crossed his legs seductively. A little bit expanse of pale legs came into view and Harry gulped.
“Oh, here’s my little raven” he said and Dracy watched from a few feet away, letting their children have fun with their father first. She always love this part. Just watch the way Harry have always been an amazing father and a perfect husband.
“It’s a nice day out” Draco mumbled, finding himself smiling at the joyful expression on everyone’s faces.
From their time together, starting as strangers to friends to lovers, Harry had never once been angry, pissed, or annoyed at him. He opens the doors for him, gives him forehead kisses, and blesses him with a smile so blinding Draco thought he have walked right into heaven.
Just the question rattled Harry out. It didn’t feel right, didn’t feel good. He cannot imagine someone else in Draco’s place. It just doesn’t seem realistic like things now turned out to be.
Dracy isn’t one for sweet gestures before but everything changed ever since her family fell apart. What she suffered from alone, no galleons to depend on and basically had to beg to be employed and hardly accepted how little the owner pays her was very exhausting.
Harry recognized him as the sour painting who only knows to scowl and stare daggers at everyone, earning him the title as
Two years ago, at age eighteen, Draco is nothing but a needy and seductive boy. Who possesses every ounce of beauty in the world. The long pale legs that manages and never fails to catch Harry's breath and entice him into touching him without the thoughts of being righteous and go against his own principles as being a Head Auror who should be brave to look away to such indecent thoughts.
“However, I always read newspapers and such. I haven’t encountered your name yet. Or perhaps, you go by a pen name?”
The intense kisses they shared, sweaty foreheads, and bite marks in his body as a reminder of what Harry had claimed, the property he took from his body. There were no statements but never did Draco allowed himself to hold another man.
Susan and Pansy were talking about hair charms that’ll last longer than the one they are currently using while Hannah was doodling in her Astronomy parchment— despite the fact that she was the one who egged them on having a group study session. And Luna, the enigma of the century, eating some muggle pop tarts her muggleborn Ravenclaw roommate gave her.
He knows because he always experienced that when he's a kid and even just two years ago. Old men who did nothing but shout at him if he so much as step a foot outside. He really hates that and really just had to endure because he wasn't of age back then but now that he is, he can do whatever he wants and follow his decisions.
His hands began to guide her movements, fastening her pace and he continued to throw in curses and praises. Every pant that came out of his parted lips and the bead of sweat on his temples, he was quite the view like the sight below him.
“Don’t leave. I understand you might not want to be in the same vicinity with me so I’ll be the one to leave.”
They were currently spying on Tom. Draco prayed to all who was willing to listen that hopefully they’ll be able to find something important. He yelped in surprise when he was suddenly yanked on his feet with a firm hold on his arms.
Their heartbeats more than enough to quell for the lack of noise and her soft giggles a gentle tune to his ear. Harry was smiling down at her as he turned her around and pulled her back close to his chest before laying one hand protectively against her protruding belly while the other stayed on her hip.
“Come on! Whiz bangs!” Ginny cheered as Luna smiled into the background, wearing what seemed to be a Phoenix head.
They did not wander around after paying for the books. Some of the people they met inside the bookstore already have literally glued their lingering eyes on her and only stopped when he threatened them with the sharpest glare he could muster when she wasn’t looking.
Harry guided him to stand up after grabbing hold of the handcuffs as well. He gently pushed him to sit at the edge of the bed. He tilted his chin up to look at Harry who smiled softly.
There’s growing sadness that gnaws inside him followed by dread. What if they left? What if they had an emergency? What if they had another run in with another biker group? What if someone is hurt? What if?
The obsession looming around his head scares him. The idea that there’s eyes watching him wherever he goes haunted him, even in his sleep.
Madam Pomfrey pinched the bridge of her nose, “The two of you fainted at Potions, Mr. Potter. An accident while brewing what was supposed to be Felix Felicis”
Harry bought themselves a flower necklace and unwithering flower bouquet for him. He smiled at the action, leaning close to him and giving him a kiss on the cheek.
“Darling you see, we had to seek for a new person who could provide the security we need in the muggle world. He requires marriage in exchange”
“If you want it as much as I do, say yes. If you don’t, walk away, tiger. Your call” he added, allowing her a moment to ponder on her choices because they both knew if she gives the signal, it would no longer be her in charge.
Before Draco can even respond, Harry apparated them to his room. He took the flowers away from Draco and threw it off somewhere before he pushed Draco on the bed.
For him to devour in any time of the day but Harry was 30 back then. He cannot fuck an 18 year old. He cannot. He was a righteous person, brave to walk away, courageous to close an eye even when the absolute perfection presented itself in front of him.
“Well, kitten,” his hand glide to touch his upper body, his index finger tracing along his stomach to his sternum. As goosebumps erupted from the back of Draco’s neck, he had an inkling he now understood what the game
He wanted to talk to Madam Pomfrey to make sure he’s not going batshit crazy and not making things up. But McGonagall said they’ll be acting strange. Maybe these kinds of thoughts and that action was a sign they still have potion in them, the pearl dust in them.
Her lips parted and her eyebrows furrowed. She felt as if her nostrils flared up for Harry’s audacity to talk like this as if he’d never avoided her! This jerk!
Tom Riddle was handsome. Clean cut hair, nice stance, may not be as muscly as Harry but elegant. Poised. Elite. Those are what Draco sees. No one would really expect this man is anything but good.
“Baby, the next time you say that, I’m going to obliviate myself” he murmured, chin resting on Draco’s shoulder, “But this is nice. Me keeping you warm”
He stood up and walked back inside with fire in his gaze, “Explain to me why my husband walks out of the target’s apartment behind my back?!”
Draco blinked amused. Yes, he’s gorgeous but to hear it from someone who’s as beautiful as fluffy Japanese pancakes is something more. It’s glorious. Believable and yet, disputable.
He pulled him in front of the sports booth, “This is a game known as Spear’s Gamble. You get a spear, aim for those dragon balls and if you strike one, you get a reward… or an odorous liquid on your face”
Harry pouted his lips. Wanting to kiss him but there’s no harm if Draco wouldn’t really want to. After all, his reputation has been ruined because of the path he chose for himself.
He furrowed his eyebrows together when he heard something that sounded like a pained whimper and he clenched his hands into fists. Taking a step closer, letting some of his Alpha win this.
Dracy shook her head, not minding others as she tilted her head up and kissed him on his cheek, “We deserve to be, ‘arry”
He prayed to whoever can hear to let him see daylight if he was to be caught. His captor who he have not learn the name yet is someone so utterly dangerous, one look and it makes Draco keep his mouth shut. His towering figure to his lithe frame, he knew he’s small and have literally no chance at all to escape.
“I’m going to make you feel so good” Harry sucked on his nape, leaving an angry red and purple bruises along his skin. To his shoulder, to his throat, to the side of his neck while his hand slid up and down his shaft.
Harry clicked his tongue and left the room. Draco sighed in frustration. He needs to test his blood pressure. What did Kingsley thought partnering him with him?!
He was about to speak again when there was a familiar sound of apparition from outside and Lucius gave him a stern look so he was force to sit up properly as he smoothened the light wrinkles of his dress.
She gripped the counter tight when his right hand began to move down, stopping by her tummy for a second before resuming. Her knuckles turned white at the sight of Harry’s fingers dipping past her bottoms and into that place where all lust can be sated.
Harry shrugged, “I don’t know a thing about diseases. I have to read. What the hell is bubbling frog disease?”
Harry hummed in agreement, chest overflowing with joy and love. The arrangement is as amazing as it can be.
Draco coughed at what he heard. A certain memory playing in his mind. It just felt a little bit similar to what had happened, that one situation Harry wants to stay as secret. He felt hands tapping his back, comforting him from nearly choking on his own saliva,
He waved a hand respectfully and let Harry pull him to wherever he desires. Occasionally stifling a chuckle when he remembered his reaction. He looked like he was ready to explode and even though he was hit with it as well, he found it ridiculous.
Harry felt his chest easing up as he let the words out of his mouth. Explaining and telling his side of the story. He didn’t feel regret or anxiety for what just happened and he found himself glad that it did.
Before he could dwell any longer on the matter, he perked up when he heard the doorknob twisting. This is it.
"What?" a girl spoke, confused at Harry's interruption but he didn't answer her as he beckoned for Draco to follow.
It left her in awe, her lips parting as she scrambled to her feet, getting closer to the blanket and eyes staring at the whole place.
The man eyed them both silently, lingering to Draco the same way they lingered back at the coffee shop and if it weren’t for Harry holding him close, he might’ve excused himself already. That glance looks so terrifying. Just downright horrible. All the things he could hide beneath those stares and the darkening of his gaze was even more scary.
While Malfoy really managed to make himself seem smaller. He seemed frail and kept to himself, lithe in figure and heavy regret in his eyes. His features who used to be sharp have been softened by his own past experiences.
But because he's in Harry's bedroom at the moment. Inspecting his things and whatever he can know and learn about him.
They all did. The three of them did receive an invitation to join the Ministry of Magic but only Hermione chose to accept as Ron settled back on helping Fred and George with their growing business.
Draco bit his lips, unclasping his hands from his robe and let it touch Harry’s wrists, taking in some support as goosebumps erupted from his skin. He had a lot of names before and had a lot of experiences with how men treats him.
He was sure if it wasn’t for Harry’s arms, hands, and body, he would’ve collapsed on the ground. He cried out, hands clutching at Harry’s, needing strength. It’s all good. Too good in fact.
It wasn’t his intention to get Dracy with him so he could mark her. So how could Harry answer his bestfriend’s question?
“I just sort of winged it. She was my bestfriend before she became anything else more. I didn’t know it was her until one day, I just looked at her and wondered why would it not be her?” she chuckled, “I don’t ask questions like you do, Harry. I don’t figure things out. That’s not how I do it. Because like you, Luna knew before I did. She’s definitely the brains in this relationship, I’m the jock” she winked.
He smiled at the thought, burying his face at the crook of her neck and biting at her skin, nipping and leaving love bites on the pale expanse of skin, the noises his cock creates with her pussy was music to his ears as he felt his balls slapping at her soaked entrance.
Molly worked hard for it so they wore it with gratefulness. Harry’s and now, Draco’s friends sang Christmas carols as they made their way to the Great Hall, catching younger student’s attention and greeting them.
Not even their friends taking a picture of them, buried underneath the stars with the howl of the nice cold night.
A look of surprise etched into her face by the question. Really? Harry wants to go out with her today? She smiled and blushed. Maybe they can enjoy the whole day with each other.
“Andy won’t tell us what the gender of the baby is” he brushed a thumb on her cheek, “Ready  to go?”
What puts him off is the reality that this person has taken a liking on him. A simple owner of a simple pub. It sets him off, mainly because Draco was feeding on his own insecurities that he questions every little thing.
“I know” Harry rubbed his temples. Sometimes, Hermione’s nagging really just pisses him off and it’s worsening his headache more.
“Please, H-harry. Yes, fuck. Please” she begged, eyes rolling at the back of her head when Harry began to suckle on her throbbing clit with enthusiasm. She felt him insert a finger, tauntingly slow to coax more pleas out of her mouth.
Harry looked up from his steam of endless documents at the sound of his little boy's soft and gentle voice. He was holding his favorite stag stuffie and was wearing nothing but Harry's oversized shirt.
Harry clenched his jaw at what he had seen because that ass laid out in front of him, covered by thin material that added up with sexiness, his for the taking, do what he can and wants to with it (and he for sure has million ways to play with it), have them jiggling in his palms and the idea that he can lick through the crack, claim and fuck.
“Is that so, tiger?” he stated more than questioned, playful and menacing. She felt the tingling in her spine and she knew then she’ll be fucked. Figuratively and literally.
Dracy felt like the luckiest person on the whole of Wizarding World because the topic of conversations and papers is right there with her, taking her and ravishing her. Leaving her hungry for more but as well as, sated.
Draco moaned loud when Harry had touched his prostate and felt shocks to his spine that flowed through his cock with mind-numbing sensations.
He smiled giddily. Harry and everyone is getting back from their trip from Texas. About a work they do regarding with their biker thing. Something Draco doesn’t bother himself for and even if he does, Harry would never let him know under the guise of his innocent mind shouldn’t be tainted by what job Harry does.
He sighed. He has been flipping through folders nonstop, trying to waste an hour until it is time for him to go home and just relax in his bathtub. Working eight to ten hours a day exhaust him to no end. Plus, the irritating hot spaghetti sauce of a man is not helping.
“Daddy, daddy” he chanted as Harry nudged on his prostate, his cock leaking more and he felt his lungs lacking of air as his feet began to shake even more, threatening to move from its place.
He tried to ignore the chaos happening inside him, the war currently raging in, the fire and air hovering him uselessly.
Relentless, cold, but still, quite reserved. How Sirius dreams of seeing them go full force and meet the man he had heard from his bestfriend. The man who controls the security, the man who do the dirtier work behind while James only do a certain level of dirty. The man who Lily had referred to as the kind but ultimately, dangerous at the end of the day.
Blaise who seemingly was the only one who could get his point grinned, “Nothing like yours, of course”
Dragging a chair over to Draco’s sides, he straddled the seat and leaned his elbows on the back of it, “Sooo. . .” he drawled, prolonging the vowel.
He decisively stood up to follow him and found him in the living room, getting ready to go in the floo.
” Harry growled out roughly, stilling his hips and Draco moaned absently when he felt the familiar hot juices filling him up.
She spent the next hours doing whatever she could do. Settling on the living room, cleaning even when there’s nothing to clean, going to the library, hanging on Harry’s bed before finally, going back to her bedroom and chose something nice to wear.
Personal reasons. What could they be? It was obvious Dracy knows nothing about the Alpha. He’s too secretive of his personal life.
“Ow! What was that for?” he grumbled. Fuck. That slap is fucking painful. How did Draco manage to have a mark first? Harry expected he gets to have spanking first.
“You’re worrying too much. Trust me, Harry. Draco may be eighteen on his age but he’s not on his mind. He may be a boy in the eyes but he’s a little devil”
It’s something he should consider with in-depth thoughts. It’s not just about marking an omega, it’s being with each other for all days in the future. Suspending or trying to cut of bonding is a long process and can be really really hurtful. That’s according to some testimonies he had heard over the halls of St. Mungos by crying omegas who were claiming their Alpha is not responding to them with how they wanted.
Harry sighs, scrubbing a hand over his face. He needs to wake Draco. He is warming up, but not quickly enough. It’s also not going to help him much to hear Draco murmur his name in a sleep-muddled voice. No, it’s much better in the long run to just wake him up.
Except, no he isn’t. Harry has locked himself in the bedroom, and wants nothing to do with him. Just like his mother doesn’t. No! That was a dream, a figment of his imagination. It’s not to be taken seriously. Not like the way Harry has hung him out to dry, refusing to even look at him.
“Draco,” comes Harry’s voice. This time it isn’t steady and devoid of emotion. This time, fear fills the trembling word. “I can see them. Lucius and Voldemort are both in the dining room having a feast with about thirty guests.”
Mother’s eyes widen, surprised to hear how easily we found information. That only lasts a moment though, replaced quickly with suspicion. “What is it, Draco? There’s something you’re not saying.”
“Well, you can try to look I guess. I can’t promise you’ll see anything.” I stand from the armchair and untie the dressing gown I’d put on a few minutes ago. It falls to the ground after a second of twisting it around my wings, leaving me in Harry’s cozy shirt. I feel a pang of regret as I spell it off me, the holes ripped in to compensate for my wings glaring up at me, but fold it neatly regardless. I take a second to pull my tracksuits up slightly, making sure they don’t ride down too low on my hips. Happy that I won’t accidentally flash my mother, I spin around and crouch before her.
By the time they run their tests and confirm that yes, there is a weird trace of magic over the whole thing, the sun is setting. The Vanishing Cabinet, nearly forgotten in light of the breakthrough, is now pushed away from the fountain again. Harry is crouching by the secret drawer they’d revealed last time, examining it from his haunches. Draco is standing in front of the Cabinet, trying to look for signs of magical exhaustion.
Draco moans at that, pulling the blankets off himself and standing. He stretches his arms above his head, his shirt riding up even more. Harry’s eyes fall to the trail of blond hair leading down from his belly button into his pyjama bottoms. He
late- Oh. He’d only had an apple for breakfast… and by now it’s definitely past midday. Harry sighs. He hadn’t thought to bring food with him. Of course he hadn’t. Harry curses past him and condemns his afternoon to hunger.
It works, everyone in the room yelping, alerting me to where everyone is. Keeping my ears peeled, I continue to tamper with the lighting, dodging people and just being a general nuisance to these people who are trying to help me. I feel kind of bad, blinding them on repeat and then plunging them into darkness in the space of a second. A good friend wouldn’t do that. Then again, the people I face in the actual battle won’t be good friends, will they?
His hand makes contact with something, and he attempts to pick it up. Unfortunately, it doesn’t make it much further than that. He knocks it over, and realises that it wasn’t the book he was after. It was a glass, full of water. Harry swears and jumps up, running to the kitchen to grab a hand towel. He races back with a bright pink towel, picks up the book and the now-empty glass, and mops up the water
Once he’s satisfied that the dirt has been washed away, Draco struggles through turning the tap off. He hisses in pain as he uses his injured arm, but he needs both hands to turn the handle. It would be so much easier with his wand. He sighs, trudging across the hole and sitting down at the opposite side again. He tips his head back, resting it against the dirt wall behind him. The sky above is grey, cloud covering what Draco knows is blue. That means it’s either night still, with the moon and stars blotted out by the heavy canopy above—or that it’s going to rain. Pour, really, possibly even storm. Draco knocks his head back, hitting it against the dirt. Knowing his luck and just how much the gods hate him, it’s going to be the latter. He can’t even escape it, trapped as he is. There’s only one thing he
But no matter how much he tries to avoid them, he keeps being plunged back into them. Usually, it’s in the form of stakeouts. He can deal with those. He doesn’t know why, but something about them feels different. Probably because there’s always another person there. He doesn’t feel as isolated. But it could also be that he’s just normalised it, and that he knows that even
Draco really should chastise him for this decision, but lets it slide when he sees the tired lines on Harry’s face. “Why?”
Regardless, with the people figured out Draco is able to unravel the—now glaringly obvious—motive. He and Harry are being set up, and their friends and peers have gone to an insane measure to achieve it. While Draco has worked it out though, he isn’t so sure about Harry…
As the hours creep by and the night projects darkness forward like a bullet or an Unforgivable, Harry finds himself occasionally bumping into Malfoy. It’s nothing, just a casual bump of shoulders as they both end up close to each other. It doesn’t mean anything, just that their bodies are trying to use the other one as a source of heat. That’s what Harry tells himself. He ignores the sparks shooting through him every time they come into contact, or the flutter in his stomach every time Malfoy looks at him. It’s nothing. Okay, maybe it’s something. Maybe, somewhere along the way, the lines became kind of blurred. Maybe the reason Harry no longer hates Malfoy is because he feels something entirely different towards his nemesis, but he doesn’t want to think of the implications of that fact. He’s known he’s bisexual for many years by now, but Malfoy? No. That can’t ever become anything for so many reasons. Hence why Harry is desperately trying to be as rude to him as possible in his own head.
He blushed when he saw the intensity in those emerald eyes. They were piercing but still held a semblance of gentleness. It felt freeing.
Harry gave a particular hard suck on her nipple while his hand pinched the other and pulled on it, Dracy felt the warmth of his cum coating his jeans and she felt hazy at the goodness of it all. Dirty but was so sexy. She’d never made a man cum that fast before and the thought it was Harry was more than the best.
Alarms blare in his mind as he fought the urge to let out a gut-wrenching plea. He let a tear roll down from his eyes. His mind ringing,
Dracy nodded, taking in what Andy is telling how as she stared. Baby. Their little beanie. She bit her lips. Never would she expect that she will  be here with Harry for that matter. She squeezed Harry’s hand, getting some strength from his large hand when she started to get emotional.
“Fuck!” he exclaimed and within a second, exploded because fuck. He’s not going to hell. This is hell.
His hands massaged Sirius’ shoulder, smoothing all tense muscles, “Why don’t we go wash up?” he suggested after a while.
“No! That’s a big step and I just wanted to think about it more. Marking her would completely change everything”
Looking up, grateful for Harry’s kindness, he smiled at her. Fingers carding through her hair before she started on with her work.
Harry grinned proudly before shaking his head and giving him a kiss on his lips, “How about I drive us to my place and let daddy take care of ‘ya, sweetheart?”
He growled and was about to lift her up when Dracy pushed him away so he could lean on the counter. Harry’s eyes widened at the action as he looked at her, eyebrows raising in confusion on what the omega is planning to do.
“Hmm” Harry hummed nonchalantly, hand tightening at his throat as his mouth busied itself from biting and sucking purples marks along his neck, completely ignoring his cock.
She did not even try to look around Harry’s room. She willed herself to behave like he wanted her to. She itched to slid a hand down her cunt, pinch her clit and play with herself but Harry specifically told her not to so she closed her legs tight.
"Please call me Harry, Draco" Harry spoke and Draco watched his adams apple bob up and down and he doesn't know why but he finds it as sexy as his body.
She looked up hastily when Harry appeared in the middle of the living room through apparition. The alpha immediately approached and kneeled in front of her, “Is everything, okay? What is it, baby? Wily said it’s urgent”
“It’s not about my rut. It’s actually about a question Dracy asked me last night and I couldn’t answer”
Lucius didn’t answer immediately so she continued, “You left me with nothing. I had to endure disgusting things to survive while you ran off with someone and enjoying what life can give you”
If you can just see how squishy those ass is, you'll understand why Harry had to restrain himself so fucking tight so he wouldn't jump to the small form and squeeze every sound he can.
, tight” he stared at her down, matching the little moans with his grunts, "All these for me, yeah?"
Dracy nibbled on her lips and looked around. Trying to think of a place she wants to visit in but contemplated when she met the eyes.
When he got outside, he saw Harry leaning by his motorbike and was smoking as if he was waiting for him to come out. He had his head tilted down, staring at the pavement. One of his hands is inside his pocket. He was only wearing a simple black sando, his leather jacket laying over his motorbike and the dog tags Draco is very fond of is dangling around his neck.
“Harry!” she tried to push his hands away from the side of her waist, trying to get him off but to no such luck.
Taking a deep breath, she tried to ignore the eyes that looked at them as soon as they stepped inside. Feeling Harry’s tight hold on her hand as he pulled her close, they ignored the stares and Dracy had the urge to bow her head down.
He went back out and closed the door just as he heard the familiar sound of apparition. He's here. Harry's here. He casted a quick tempus and saw it's still 3 in the afternoon. They can still do a lot of things one of which involves two writhing flesh but there's a proper time for that.
He cringed, remembering to look at his watch and wincing when he saw it was already six in the evening. Was he really out for long? He carefully pushed Harry’s hand away, quickly redressing and walking out without so much noise.
She cried out softly when Harry kissed her, deepening it right away and dominating the kiss. Harry moved his lips and Dracy let him on, his tongue found its way inside her mouth and she moaned.
If he has a choice, he'd very much prefer to deal with the cross werewolves and vampires or the just-in case, the illegal potions trade happening at Hogsmeade. Because then at least he will not stare at criminals' ass and wonder whether they possess the equal softness like Draco's.
The way he had admitted to wanting Harry. It is so fucking hot. No one in his past relationships had made a first move and certainly not as motivated and determine as Draco. Harry always did the first move and it was him who always did the wooing and actions.
, Harry!” he sobbed when Harry thrust his erection, causing electric sensations shooting to the base of his cock, bobbing and throbbing, “Shit. Please, need you, fuck, need you so much”
“G-good morning” she stammered. She cannot get her tongue straight whenever it was Harry who talks to her.
She gulped and leaned. She never felt an elevator ride for so long before. When she felt like she can no longer handle the eyes behind them, Harry was quick to pull her in front of him and shielded her away from their prying eyes.
Draco chews the inside of his cheek, not quite believing what he’s hearing. He pulls away, prying Harry’s hands off him. “How do you even know what happened? I thought you were asleep.”
The wind roars around my ears, and I can’t hear anything other than my pulse and hammering heart. Mountains are beautiful to look at, but to hike them? That’s another story entirely. But I needed to get away. I couldn’t bear to be in the same house as my father and Voldemort. The two men are positively twisted. They both need a mental asylum.
For some reason, I’m suddenly compelled to kiss him. Compelled to wrap my arms around his neck and waist, to pull him flush against me, and to press our lips hard together. But I can’t, so instead I smack his hand silently under the table. He gets the message and removes it, and I stand from the table. My footsteps echo around the hall as my feet hit stone, and the great doors groan as I pull them in.
It doesn’t work. Of course it doesn’t work! It’s impossible to Apparate from the Ministry! Harry sighs, releases Draco’s waist, and steps away from him again. Draco is looking at him fondly, shaking his head like he so often does.
“Might as well keep reading. There is nothing we can do about this.” I stare at him in disbelief, before picking up my own book. I hate to admit this, but he is right. There is nothing we can do about being locked out of the Common Room.
“Come on. We have work to do,” Harry chuckles. I smack his arm lightly and say ‘whatever, you dork’ before pulling Goldstein’s parchment from my robes. Harry once again rips it from my clutch, and starts pacing around.
Draco’s skin heats even warmer than it already was, a shiver coursing through him at the use of his first name. Potter said his fucking given name, in public, in daylight, on a case. That is unacceptable. Even if it makes Draco slightly aroused.
,” Harry whines, his hands reaching up to hold onto his shoulders. His fingers rub circles into his skin, comforting. “Christmas is in a couple of days, and since I’ve been trapped
Harry bites his lip, a fond laugh trying to escape. He may be confident in his emotions now, but Draco doesn’t need to see him with hearts in his eyes just yet. “Coffee is under a
Draco pulls his wand out of his pocket, raising it straight up at the sky. He murmurs an incantation and a stream of silver flows out the end. It’s the colour of a Patronus charm, and for a second Harry thinks that that’s what it is. But then it darkens, becoming a deep grey, and fires off. It travels around the perimeter of the plaza, following the pavers and looping around the corners. It’s precise, and it rockets back into Draco’s wand barely two seconds later. Draco, to his credit, doesn’t sway at all.
“No buts.” Harry sighs deeply, arms wrapping tighter around his waist. “What you did was a momentary lapse of judgement. You didn’t know what was happening.”
“How could I not be? I’ve known him for seven years and I’ve just sent him into one of the most dangerous buildings in England!” ‘Worried’ seems to be an understatement, but I don’t know how to comfort her without crossing a line. This odd understanding that’s developed between us is very fragile, so I don’t say anything for fear of breaking it. Not only would this mission become impossible, but Harry would never forgive me. If I’m going to be his friend—or even something more—I need to make an effort. Because I can feel Harry and I drawing each other in. It’s like a magnet, pulling me towards the man who saved me from my father and a lifetime of ill decisions and regrets.
Draco feels his arse being kneaded, and he forces his hips to stop rocking into the mattress. Air moves over his entrance as his cheeks are pushed apart, causing him to gasp. Harry runs his finger gently over his hole, and Draco shudders.
It’s chaos, just like the beginning of every other match I’ve ever played. I immediately rise up and out of the way of the others, taking myself to the edge of the pitch. Players are flying rapidly around the pitch, chasing after Quaffles, Bludgers, and other players. Robins and the Weaslette are following after Adair, who has the Quaffle and is making her way down to score for Slytherin. Urquhart meets her there and she throws the ball to him. He flies around the Gryffindor Chasers before landing the first perfect score.
Potter smiles, then it twists into a grin. “I can hold your hand if you’re scared of falling again?”
Malfoy doesn’t comment, just walks back to the living with his bowl and a spoon in hand. He brushes past Harry, and Harry tenses at the sparks lighting up his skin.
Merry Christmas! I hope you have a great rest of the year and enjoy today (even if you don’t celebrate it, have a nice day). Xx
He sees Potter roll his eyes, but he doesn’t argue with Draco as he leaves down the corridor. Potter comes back a few seconds later with his notebook and some of Draco’s markers. Well, they aren’t strictly
Harry sighs, feeling the tension leave his body. He cancels the spells and begins running again, slowly speeding up until he’s practically sprinting. Stamina be damned, he needs to beat Draco there. He can’t believe Draco did that.
Harry unbuckles Draco’s belt, the metallic clinking filling the bedroom. With the clasp undone, Harry unbuttons Draco’s trousers, and pulls the zip.
“Can someone please tell me what just happened?” Hermione asks, clearly not keeping up with the realisation still fresh in my mind, regardless of Harry’s comforting presence.
Humming in acknowledgement, Draco links their hands together. Harry arches an eyebrow at him, but Draco just shrugs. “Pretty sure they all think we’re dating anyway. It’s a good cover story.”
He pushes himself to new limits, running faster than ever through the forest. The panic he’s forced on himself morphs, becoming more real. Flashbacks fill his mind. Walking through a forest in First Year and seeing Voldemort drinking unicorn blood. Spiders chasing him in the car in Second Year. Running to avoid Remus’ werewolf form. Finding the dragons in cages. The giant, the centaurs, the dementors, the fire and Hagrid’s hut burning to the ground. The snatchers, Ron’s arm nearly being splinched off. Dying. Harry isn’t aware of anything anymore, just the all consuming need to get
Swallowing drily I manage to whisper, “They’re in there, Hermione. They are actually in there, with dozens of guests.”
Potter said that? Of course the man would let Draco starve at the bottom of a pit, he was a Death Eater!
Harry’s head falls back, and Draco takes that as an invitation to kiss his way down the skin. His mouth sucks and bites, his teeth sinking into his skin tantalisingly. Harry moans under him, his hands holding Draco in place. Draco’s tongue swirls down his chest and between his nipples, before moving off to the right and licking around one.
“Back to Potter, am I?” Harry can’t help it, there’s just something about Malfoy calling to be riled up.
It feels like there’s a string wrapped around his hand, slowing being pulled taut. Of course, it’s connected to Potter. Draco feels like the only way to warm up properly is to touch Potter, to move into his personal space. It’s pathetic, and surely just a side effect of his ill-advised emotions. He squeezes his eyes shut, willing himself to think of
Draco hums, tearing his gaze from Harry’s face. “They probably have some time modifying spells in their kitchen.”
“I have.” My eyebrows furrow, and I turn to Harry. I forgot he was still in the room, as he usually moves away and does some things down stairs. But now, he is sitting very close to me on the leather sofa. So close even, that if I moved my leg over slightly, we would be touching. Trying to push away the heat rising to my face, I fix him a curious and intrigued glance. “I think you’re conversation a couple of days ago triggered the change.”
the girl Harry and he had last time—he’s not sure he could take her suspicious and judgmental gaze again. This time it’s an older woman, dyed black hair short and tidy. She’s methodical as she packs the bags, not commenting on the items at all. She’s polite, fast, and very competent. As Draco takes his bags, he drops a £2 coin into the tip jar. She beams at him in thanks, and he closes the door with an answering nod.
The worker laughs softly and asks what they’d like. Malfoy starts pointing out different breads and asking about them, so Harry takes the chance to look around the shop.
Swallowing heavily and feeling my throat contract slightly, I answer. “Only about an hour ago, I think. It woke me up.” I sneak a glance at Harry and find him already looking my way and nodding thoughtfully.
“Malfoy. You are dying.” I want to disagree, but realise he’s probably right. Not that I’d ever tell him that. “Stay here. I’ve decided for you.” He nods his head at me before slipping through the door, and pacing silently down the hallway.
“Seems so,” Harry answers. “Something to do with ‘adversity bringing out powers’ or whatever.” He waves a dismissive hand. “Anyway, help me look!”
Draco tries to flinch away, but that only makes Potter raise his other hand and hold him in place. Potter’s hand presses into his forehead, his skin cold against Draco’s. He tries not to flinch at the physical contact, thinking back to last night when Potter’s hands were all over him.
“I figured that out on my own already. Unlike you, I am perfectly capable of understanding implications.”
All the boys he’d thought he’d been friends with back at Hogwarts are busy with their own lives, and haven’t really reached out at all. Seamus and Dean got together quite quickly and have been keeping to themselves, Neville is apparently building his own magical plant nursery, Luna took over the Quibbler while still in her Seventh Year—how she manages it all Harry can’t begin to comprehend—and… well that’s it, isn’t it? Ginny has been ignoring him for months, and Draco leaving him suddenly hasn’t seemed to change that.
“What the fuck happened there?!” Harry demanded, throwing his hands up but not stepping further away from Hermione and I .
With one last glance at Malfoy, Harry pulls his own shirt off and drops it to the floor. He lifts the blanket and slides in under it, and he’s immediately being grabbed. Arms wrap his chest and neck, icy feet pressing against his legs. Harry sighs, accepting his fate, and turns around so his head can rest against Malfoy’s chest. He breathes in the other man’s scent and wraps his arms around him, pulling him closer. Harry drifts off to sleep like that, wrapped up in Draco Malfoy.
The floor is cold beneath his bare feet, and his breath puffs out in clouds. He is so bloody cold, and that is definitely not normal. Harry makes his way, in the dark, down the hallway and towards the living room. He doesn’t want to wake Draco, because he’ll protest. Harry
As they duck through the branches at the edge of the forest and walk towards the courtyard, Draco takes a second to observe Potter. The man is wearing a navy blue coat, and it actually appears quite new. It was probably a gift from Granger, if the sleeves include little thumb holes. He squints, trying to catch a glimpse—  and yes! They do.
need to rethink Draco’s emotions in all this. An uninterested person would not act like that, he’s sure. The thought of Draco reciprocating his feelings brings a spring to Harry’s step as he walks towards Draco again.
It’s rather ridiculous, my current situation. I’m seventeen, a fallen angel, dying in the middle of a war on the wrong side. And I’ve just been rescued by another seventeen year old boy, who is destined to save the world. But that’s not where the stark contrasts end. My pale skin, silver eyes, and platinum hair are opposites to Potter’s tan skin, black hair, and green eyes. Evil, wicked, cruel. Honest, saviour, brave. Stupid, stupid. At least that’s the same. I’m stupid for sticking with my father for so long. Potter is stupid by being so ‘brave’ and ‘heroic’. And we are both probably going to die before the end of the world.
Upon sensing the shaking nerves inside her, Harry pulled her closer before dragging her out of the store where a flash of camera immediately greeted them.
“I’ll cook you your dinner and you shall rest well after. Your duties start tomorrow” Harry kissed her pointy nose before disappearing to the kitchen.
He gripped the edge of his vanity table, looking down and groaning at the obvious erection beating. He never experienced this with someone, not anyone, not ever.
“Brandy” the man leaned on the counter, flicking his fingers to the bartender and turning his head to look at him, “Hi”
It didn’t help that Harry is one fine specimen. Tall, unrelenting, seductive and utterly so good with his hands. Those thick fingers, much thicker than Draco’s and the rings that glinted within the dim lights of the pub Draco is working in.
He grunted as cold towel cleaned him up before he felt himself being carried. He sighed softly when he felt his back touching his soft mattress, body wrapped in a relaxing blanket and as his eyes steadily dropped, he forced them back open.
“You regret it?” Draco found his voice breaking a little bit. Was it not good? Is he just saying that to save himself from telling the truth?
He has his fair share or if not, more than necessary. Every one knows how omegas wanted to own that temple but every one also knows he’s not one to commit so easily.
“Fuck me, Harry. Want you inside me” she demanded with a moan, “Want your cock in me, pounding in me. Yes, fuck, please. Want your thick cock inside me”
Her heart hammered as Harry’s husky voice resonated behind her, body close to hers as she felt the warm radiating off of his body. She bit her lips, already loving the idea of a massage. She will never say no to a massage.
It wasn’t long before the younger years were dismissed to retire on their bed and eight years asked to stay back. Counting from the heads Harry can see, he reckoned there were at least 19 who came back to finish their studies.
Draco hummed contentedly, “Fill me up so good, Alpha. Fill me up so good I’m gonna feel you for days, your cum sliding down from my boypussy”
You see, House of Potter has three basic rules. Basic but strictly should be followed with every ounce of honor and virtue. The boat has been so smooth because Harry doesn't harbor any desire, any secret or hidden kinks with younger people. Until he shook his hand with Draco's small one and he knew then that this passion is just too secretly hidden for him to notice with one single blink.
To take over, claim her in the wooden floors, atop the dining table, have her behind bookshelves, in the bed, under the shower, and everywhere they can fit in.
He cleared his throat, coming back from his stupor upon the sight of that cute color that tainted her supple cheeks. He took a sip of his water and turned his attention to his plate.
His eyes looked straight at the ceiling, feeling as though he was seeing shapes as Harry laved his tongue on his sternum, fingers twisting and pulling on his nipple. It wasn’t long until his mouth took the other nipple and sucked on it harshly. Noises echoing from his throat.
"Little one, I know what you're doing" Harry said through gritted teeth. Draco bit his lips and blinked at him. Harry found himself staring at his cherry red lips and he imagined himself smashing his to that delicious lips and sucked the bottom lip between his fingers.
He groaned when he felt the familiar tightening of his body and felt the way his whole body grew rigid and his breath rocketing.
When basically all of him throbs in a debatable way, his gut is right. He’d always been quick on the uptake.
“Who’s your boyfriend, Draco?” he asked seriously, slightly tightening his hold, “Zayan, huh? That asshole from the party?”
“Whenever you’re ready then, Potter” he rolled his eyes, stopping when Harry tickled on his side, “Hey! Stop it!” he said through his fit of giggles.
She fucked up. She’s messing up. Harry will hate her like how everybody hates her family. The family she refuses to acknowledge she’s in anymore. She’s Harry’s now, right? Right? It’s better.
He smiled coyly for how he literally can feel the heat radiating off of Harry behind him and the rough breaths echoing in his ear despite the booming noise around them.
He felt the air shifted between them. He can feel Harry’s arousal and he is living for it. A cold and glaring Harry is so tempting.
“You should know better than to run away” he tutted, “The outside is harmful. Danger lurks in there. You’re safe here, love. I’ll keep you safe here”
“Like bubbles that form in the upper body jumping around from places to places with a stinging pain”
He was covered in love bites. A good amount of love bites. He traced the one on his neck to his chest, shivering when bits of what had happened last night came into his mind unintentionally. The way Harry’s mouth sucked and bit on his neck and the way his tongue would lick and roll over to the crevice of his collarbone.
“You are, aren’t you?” Harry cut her off and sighed. Dracy didn’t respond to that and watched him massage his temples and heave another deep breath.
"And I'm going to have you" Draco added and tilted his head, baring his pale neck that seemed to be an amazing canvass to paint deep colors of red and purple.
The way he carries himself fascinated her. He has this air of nonchalance and at the same time, plenty of raw expressions written in his face. It draws her in as to why a man like Harry Potter can be two sides of the same coin, all seasons, day and night.
“Oy, children! We brought some little phoenixes we can put up the tree” Hannah and Susan appeared out of nowhere, holding a bunch of the thing in their arms and tossing each one to the others.
He wanted the romance to be given to him, he wanted to receive things he can show off and wanted to be so spoiled he’ll cry himself to sleep because he’s so loved and so lucky.
“How are you?” he asked, running his fingers in Draco’s silky hair, the footsteps nearing until it stopped and the next thing Harry heard was the opening and closing of a car door before it drove off.
He grumbled and downed the whole bottle. He’s getting tipsy but he ordered Dobby to give him another bottle to get some alcohol bravery. He was about to drink another bottle of firewhiskey when he heard the familiar swoosh of the floo.
He glared down at him. Not appreciating what he said back at the dining, “Who?” he asked, his right hand gliding to Draco’s wrist upwards to his arms to his sharp collarbone.
Harry paid for their order and proceeded to stand beside Tom where he was still waiting for his order. It was silent for a while and Draco though he was going to ignore them or is not really up talking to strangers but surprised him when the man opened his mouth,
And the one who currently doesn’t spare him any glance as he focused on what is happening straight ahead, ignoring Draco’s feeble attempts to get him to his bed.
Draco tried to ground himself down. Lips parting as Harry snatched the glass away from him and set it down. He cleared his throat, palms finding their way above Harry’s rippled shoulder, “Uhm”
She sighed. That was what she’s just been thinking a second before. She shook her head and was about to bow her head when Harry cupped her chin and tilted her head upwards. Something she noticed he always do whenever she tries to avoid his leering eyes.
“Loosen up, please” he mumbled smoothly, words rolling in ease, “I don’t bite but you look like you can"
Harry hummed teasingly, meeting his eyes and shrugging, “I’m not sure I like the sound of that” he mocked and it took Draco some time to understand what he really meant.
“Your mother and I were also arranged for a marriage. I hope you know how this practically runs in our blood”
He was bewildered at what happened back then but opted to keep his mouth shut. And now? As his eyes wandered to Potter’s face, down to his hard chest and what looked like a muscular abdomen. The physique of this man is—
Love is not easy. It’s not something you can just pick up from the side of the road and it’s not something you can just buy in Diagon Alley.
“Pansy!” he called out, wanting to sound fierce but only ended up sounding too tired and sad. Which he didn’t even try to conceal at this point because Pansy knows him well enough to read between his facial expressions.
Draco stared for a minute before relenting and nodding. Harry handed him a helmet and as they were settled in, Harry drove away. The ride was silent other than the noises the motorbike makes and Draco wondered whether their position is awkward or it's just him feeling that way.
“When you shouted at me last night, I realized what I have done to you. And you asked me who even I am”
He wasn’t able to focus on his work as midnight rolled around with no single word from his boyfriend. He doesn’t like this. They just patched up an issue recently and have wonderful make up sex. He had just communicated what he feels and now, this is happening.
“Are you with me, angel?” the new name coming out of his tongue easily. Fuck, Draco looks so ethereal. A flicker of possessiveness blossomed on Harry’s chest. This baby boy, his baby boy, all for him to take, to stare at, to taste.
The door opened and Harry came walking in, “Go get ready. We’ll be visiting the bar. Don’t wear too short dresses or skirts, sweetling”
She toyed with her fingers. Thinking whether to ask him something or just let it be until it just flows out because of time.
Draco was half expecting to be wrapped with a thick blanket but he was not at all surprised when he found himself at Harry’s cocoon of sweet kisses, warm breath fanning his cold skin after such a nice and steamy night in his bed and with Harry’s hands around him, tightly.
He came with a cry, tears sliding down in his cheeks for the sheer force of a good fuck Harry never fails to deliver,
He was bare from the upper torso as the white sheets covered his bottom half. Draco tried to open his mouth to say something but no words came out as he tried to comprehend what was happening.
"And he cannot come with us. His grandmother is severely sick and she doesn't want him to see her to such state." Mr. Malfoy added to his wife's statement.
But fuck, he shouldn't. He's the mature one here and he should be acting like so. Not let a young boy try to push him off of his resolute morality and not dirty the House of Potter.
“I do not permit anyone going inside my bedroom so under any circumstance, don’t. Your bedroom will just be beside mine and if you have anything to say, knock and wait”
She nodded and watched him as he began to take some bread and handed it to her before he ate his as well. They were comfortably silent, just basking on the tranquility of the morning when her eyes darted to his body to find the Alpha dressed up. A white linen button down shirt with the first few buttons popped open.
He smiled and looked around. He really doesn’t know where he wants to go first. There’s just a lot and as he began to walk around aimlessly, observing if he’ll catch something he’s interested in.
There were cheers as they enjoyed the free day out. Several homework lined up but as they were known for lazing around, procrastination is apparently a thing too in the Wizarding World.
“For me to be rough with you? Tease you as you have teased me? Punish you for flirting with that man?”
His eyes darted over to the counter upon walking in. Seeing a nice figure sitting by the stool, alone, black haired, wearing this skin-tight pants and a crop top.
When he looked up, Remus’ face is unreadable and he turned his head to look at Sirius, “This is about the letter you didn’t want prongs to know?”
Dracy shook her head and looked up to her father. He has the hopeful expression on his face even if his eyes were as lifeless as they could be. For a fraction, she felt bad. Because she knows, no matter what happened, she has his blood running through her veins and he is her father. She felt bad at the way she’s living such a good life while Lucius was living the consequences of his actions. Something which he obviously deserves but she wouldn’t dare wish for it.
Now, she wasn’t even sure if she was under or overdressed. But considering how she was wearing a maternity dress, probably it doesn’t matter then. She was sitting at the edge of the bed to wait for Harry to finish getting ready. The Alpha was wearing a simple sleeves and trousers. He was utterly presentable and drop dead attractive that aroused more perplexity than admiration with the view.
Draco cannot stop moaning and whimpering and delighted the way Harry seemed to be harsh with his thrusting. He screamed in surprise and arched his back when Harry hit on his prostate and milked him more of precum.
For a few minutes, they stayed at the couch. Letting her lean on his body to rest and his hands caressing her back to comfort her.
“Since their death, I was followed by everyone. Wanting to interview me, ask me about what I think about what happened to my family. They were so focused on my life, so desperate to get a statement”
He thought back for a moment. Does he want to be an Auror still? It seemed so far away now. He once claimed he’ll be an Auror and when he got the chance to be one, he declined. He doubt Robards will hold his spot for long.
But now that Harry is here, he can do something. That is to shout and nag him for eternity. Until his ears falls of. He deserves it. Can’t Harry see him? He’s special. His father had told him he is to be treasured and what did Harry do? The exact opposite!
Dracy feeling the heat between her lower abdomen and the way her breath started to reflect her mysterious anticipation. For whatever reason, her heart started to beat faster, her sight keeps on focusing and unfocusing. Harry’s fingertips felt like his breathe and those palms felt hot as muggle lava.
Draco watched Harry gave his father a smile before walking over to his spot and doing this very confusing handshake, with claps and things he cannot comprehend like a whole complicated routine.
She snorted and was about to start cooking when she heard the floo activating followed by excited and joyful squeals.
, yes” she moaned, arching her back more as she tugged and tugged on her tied wrists. He grinned. She’s just so fucking sexy.
“Yes daddy, yes” Draco’s eyes rolled back, gripping Harry’s shirt tight to his palms, hoping to get some strength, some energy to hold back and not have him rutting on Harry clothed huge erection desperately.
