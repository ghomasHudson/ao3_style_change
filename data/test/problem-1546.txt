Ron rolled his eyes at that, knowing Draco and Harry were anything but friends. Nonetheless, Draco wasn’t giving Ron anything to say that he really wasn’t going to try and fuck Harry.
Harry smirked as Draco entered the room, black robe drawn tight to his body as he closed the entrance way. He looked around, as if Harry would blindside him as soon as he walked inside.
He rolled his eyes, beckoning Draco to follow him with the wave of two fingers. He then excused himself from his friends, walking out and waiting to be met. He waited for a minute before the heavy doors opened with a groan, closing with another as Draco stepped outside of them.
“Yeah?” He asked, “You think you could take another cock? Maybe next time I’ll get Ron in here, and right after I’m done, he can have his way with you. Would you like that?”
“Go ahead then,” Harry coaxed, grip tightening and stroke speeding up, “cum now before I change my mind.”
Harry popped an eyebrow up, “say what?”
Harry groaned at the burn Draco’s nails left behind, not minding that they would definitely leave angry red marks for a few days. He took Draco’s hands in his as he repositioned himself so that Draco was hitting his prostate.
He reached his hands down then, Harry's eyes following his every movement as he unbuttoned his pants, tugging them down and dropping to his knees to remove them. His underwear came down with them and Draco couldn't help but run his tongue over his bottom lip as Potter's cock sprang free.
“What more could there possibly be?” Ron asked, the information sinking in as they spoke, “you actually did it… you and Harry—“
“You never were good at your greetings,” The other man spoke, making his way inside despite not being invited in, “nothing’s changed in a year, I see.”
He decided it was both.
He tugged on his invisibility cloak, heading as quietly as possible to the library. It wasn't exactly something to sneak out for, but the library had been closed hours before and he still had studying to do. He'd turn red if someone caught him sneaking out at this time, just to find out the reason why. It was hardly worth getting in trouble for.
Harry smirked as he slid his now fully-hard cock against Draco’s bum, hearing the way Draco seemed to take a breath but not let it back out, “Well, I came here to get back at you, but I think I’ve found something much more interesting.”
He looked up to see Draco staring at his own leg where Harry’s hand was, then looking up with rosy cheeks and wide eyes. Harry gave a quick apology before he looked away. He stayed silent as Draco finished the potion, waiting for class to be over.
Harry said nothing but gave him an understanding look. Draco took it and moved to the large wooden doors, placing his hand on one of them before turning back to Harry who hadn’t moved one bit.
Harry held back a laugh as he nodded his head in understanding.
Draco let out a sob at that, and whether it was from his body responding to Harry or Harry noticing he didn’t know. Either way, he was now fully hard and he hated himself for it. Harry tightened his grip on Draco’s jaw, causing a dull ache to spread through it. He whined high in the back of his throat at this, trying to pull away from Harry (to no avail).
“I’m not very nice,” Draco responded, throwing an eyebrow up at Harry as he took in their minimal distance.
“More?” Ron asked, interest lacing his features, “more as in…?”
Draco let his eyes flutter closed as he leaned forward, pressing his lips to Harry’s and reveling in the surprised moment it took him to kiss back. Once he kissed back he took control, running his tongue over Malfoy’s plush bottom lip and nibbling on it.
Ron nodded, stepping forward and batting Draco’s hand away. He popped the button on Harry’s jeans, the zipper making a harsh noise as it slid down the metal teeth.
"The last one. You want me, don't you?" Harry hadn't meant to, but the way he said it was more of a plea for reassurance than a question, "You want to fuck me, Malfoy?"
Draco thought for a minute, “Harry”
Harry smirked, “it’s a game of transfiguration. I have two needles in my pocket, one for you and one for myself. All you have to do is make it into a potion.”
Draco took it all in, noting the way the boy beneath him responded to dirty talk.
That's all Draco said to him as he picked him up, Harry jumping and wrapping his legs around his waist. He lowered the Gryffindor back down onto his length, immediately finding his prostate once again before he sped up his thrusts, going significantly rougher than he was before.
Draco could feel the way his throat tightened as he swallowed, “thank you.”
"Alright then, let's play."
Monday there was breakfast. Now, oatmeal has never been Harry’s favorite anyway, but having Vertiserum at seven in the morning just made it that much worse. It also didn’t help that Ron was wearing a God-awful sweater that he just so happened to ask Harry’s opinion on, opting to not ask him anything else the rest of the day as the answer he received was Harry gagging dramatically.
He watched as Draco followed his orders. He waved his hand smoothly, tinting the windows in the classroom and putting a temporary silencing charm on the small room. Once he was satisfied he walked to the back and stood behind Draco, getting close enough to talk in his ear.
Harry bit his lip as he took a quick chance. He angled his hand a bit and landed his last strike. It was a little too close to Draco’s balls, and he knew that, but he hadn’t angled his hand for nothing. He nearly groaned as he heard the gasp Draco gave below him, quickly covering it up with a shaky, “ten!”
- - -
“Well,” Harry started, avoiding Ron’s eyes, “I nearly knocked him over yesterday in the locker room when I turned around, and so I grabbed him to keep him steady…”
The man gave an amused chuckle, “I am.”
Draco obeyed, cumming hard between his stomach and Harry’s. As he squeezed around him, Harry came inside him. He filled him up, some leaking out when he pulled out.
“Yeah, right,” Ron mused.
“I’m here, your day just got better,” Ron said to Harry before turning to Draco, “and your life just got longer.”
He was focused on Draco who was pounding into him. Draco was wiping his hair from his forehead with one hand and cradling his face with the other. Draco who was whispering in his ear that he was doing so well and asking him if he’s alright.
Ron nods, though nothing is said out loud, and lays his head in his palm as he looks aimlessly around the room. He lands on one particular figure who is also looking at the door where Harry had just exited. If Ron hadn’t noticed it three or so nights ago, then maybe he would be surprised, but right now he was just curious.
Harry walked quietly under the cloak, making sure to not make any sort of noise as he stepped into Draco’s room. Draco had his own room as opposed to having to share a dorm; Daddy’s money came in handy once again. It was dark in the room, the only light being the pale moon shining through what little bit of window Draco’s silk curtains weren’t covering.
Harry held his breath as Draco bottomed out, letting out a moan once he started to move. His thrusts started out gentle, but that quickly changed as he angled them, hitting the other boy's prostate and making him nearly scream.
So, what does Ron do when he’s curious? He does what he does best, of course. He goes poking around where he probably has no business doing so.
He did just that. He came in thick ribbons over Draco's hand and between their abdomens, eyes falling shut and mouth hanging open in a cut-off moan of "Draco"
"Go ahead, Harry, come for me."
Harry's eyes slipped closed, breathing deeply as all he could smell was Draco and all he could feel was Draco and all he could think was Draco.
Harry pulled away from Draco as Oliver came back into sight, mumbling that he forgot his jersey before leaving once again.
Ron turned an eyebrow up at him, “what are you on about?”
He practically threw himself into his spot as Ron and Hermione gave him an odd look. He sighed, plunging a fork roughly into his eggs before he couldn’t ignore their stares any longer.
“You sound so pretty when you beg,” Harry praised, “you’re almost ready, darling, one more,”
There it was. How Ron could hate him if he didn’t already slightly like him.
He merely nodded, his heart jumping at the smirk Harry gave him before he let him go and made his way off and down the long hall.
Harry watched as the blonde moved swiftly, his eyes scanning the living room and seemingly noting any differences there were since he last saw it with a nod of his head or the lift of an eyebrow.
Draco was about to swear to it, but didn’t have to as Harry had stopped in his tracks, momentarily looking between his red headed best friend and the arrogant slytherin who he’d not dare to speak to on this fine morning.
Harry watched as Draco pulled their wands from the desk. Draco simply nudged the desk as he walked back past it, closing the top of it once more. He strode to Harry proudly and handed him his wand.
“I know you want this. I could tell by how you responded to me talking about it the other night.”
Harry didn’t quite understand, and, as if reading his mind, Draco continued.
His eyes widened for only a second before he forced himself into his cool demeanor once again, curling and uncurling his fingers where they were against the cold tile of the wall.
“I am, I-” Harry sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose, “give me my robe.”
Ron took Harry’s legs then, folding them over his forearms and assaulting the poor boys prostate over and over again. He dropped his head into the crook of Harry’s neck, listening as Harry struggled to form sounds, muchless words.
He knew he made the wrong decision to not look at himself because when he came through the large wooden doors of the dining hall everyone turned their attention to him, and kept it there. Usually, when someone was late they would get looks, but they never kept them like he had as he made his way to his table.
“We stand a ways apart from the other, but facing each other. Then, we fire a spell off of our wands into the air, naming the first thing that comes to mind, but we can’t say it aloud. Whatever comes of that spell is final, and whichever beats the other will win.”
He turned to grab his bag, nearly knocking Malfoy into the set of lockers. He grabbed the other boy's waist to keep him up, pulling Malfoy into himself.
He didn’t need to be told twice. As soon as he had permission he was cuming. He came hard inside of Harry, white light blurring his vision until he came back down, panting.
“You know you’re insane if you think Harry would let you anywhere near him like that”
“Because you lost. Don’t make me repeat myself.”
Draco obeyed, pushing up as best as he could so that he was basically holding himself up while his legs were spread. He looked up at Harry, waiting for some kind of instruction.
“What about it?”
“I was,” Draco protested, but Harry just shook his head.
“I don’t doubt that,” Harry assured, “but it’s best to be safe. What would you like your safe word to be?”
A broken moan escaped him as tears pricked his eyes. Harry smirked and placed a hand on Draco’s lower stomach.
Ron pulled his fingers out, watching as Harry's hole clenched around nothing, ready to be filled again. Ron cursed at the sight, placing his cock there and slowly pushing in.
Draco hesitated but obeyed after a moment,  placing his hands about his shoulder-length apart onto the crooked, cracked wood of the desk. He scoffed at having to touch the tarnished material.
Harry swallowed, “I would if not for the fear it would make me puke.”
“Fuck, you’re tight,” Harry breathed out, working in his second finger much too soon, “can’t imagine how you’ll take all of me.”
Though he didn’t open his eyes, Draco nodded fervently, “yes, please!” He seemed to beg, though neither boy had the heart or will to deny him this time, “want to cum for you, please! Please let me!”
Harry sighed, “why are you here?”
“I could have you like this forever,” Harry breathed out, “but it’s really up to you how much longer this lasts. I’m close, and all you have to do for this to be over is say my name.”
Thick, white stripes were painting his own abdomen as Draco thrust once, twice more before coming inside of him.
“M’not gonna break” he muttered, “don’t have to be gentle with me.”
Harry bit his lip, “nothing, but I swear he did.”
“Why on earth would I do that?”
Ever since Harry had found the pages of blank paper encrypted inside the brown leather of the worn-out journal, well, he had been different. He spent all his time scribbling in it, waving Ron off with some nonsense to get him to leave him be. He had done the same with Hermione, giving her a small smile and saying he’d be all hers in a matter of minutes.
“Light bulb?” Ron questioned.
It almost hurt. Being so overwhelmed and underwhelmed by two completely different senses. Draco was close, clouding everything Harry knew. Ron was far, intriguing everything he didn’t.
“You ready?” Harry asked, placing the head of his cock and Draco’s stretched hole.
All week, all fucking week, Draco had completely ruined his day one way or another. When he says every day was rubbish he wasn’t exaggerating. If you think he is, allow him to walk you through his week.
“Who’s gonna stop me?” Malfoy challenged, giving Harry a once-over.
Harry nodded, not trusting his voice at the moment. To be completely honest, his mind was only producing DracoDracoDraco, and it made him feel a little woozy.
"Malfoy."
Harry nodded as he hid a smirk, “well then, I want to give you a safeword.”
It was a strange thing to do.
“No hiding. I want to see your face when I cum inside you.” He sped up as he said this, starting to feel the familiar heat coil in his stomach, “Say my name, Malfoy.”
“Yes,” Draco agreed, “I suppose so…” He seemed to think for a moment before he lit up, making Harry shake his head immediately.
Draco managed a nod, “have to to-touch you.”
“Excuse me?”
Harry nodded, looking down at Draco who definitely seemed completely lost. He heard Ron speak up enough for Draco to hear him, “are you close, darling? Want to cum for us?”
‘You,’ Harry thought as he shared a look with Draco, ‘are so very dead.’
That was around two months ago. Since then, at least three times a week (but usually more), either Draco or Harry was sharing their bed with the other. They kissed and even hung out when they weren’t busy with other things. By all definitions, they were dating, but nothing official. It had changed a few weeks ago though as Draco had caught the way Ron looked at them. It had changed from a while ago, now he looked at them differently.
“Lonely up at the front,” Draco answered, “figured I’d see what you would cook up as a way to pass the time.”
“Shit, Draco!” He practically yelled, “fuck, fuck!”
Harry threw his head back as a moan left his lips. His eyes shut on their own accord as Ron slid his tongue up and down Harry’s shaft, circling the head before taking him in once again.
Ron pulled off of Harry with a wet ‘pop’ before wiping his mouth where saliva had gathered at the edge of it. Harry’s chest rose and fell as he gained his breath back.
Malfoy was only in a towel, and though the room was already hot, his skin burned with something different. He nearly whimpered as Harry’s fingers skimmed his skin as they dropped from their hold on him.
Draco let out a sound between a whine and a cry. He fucked himself harder, struggling to be good and not cum.
“That’s not very nice,” Harry said, finding his place beside Draco and leaning against the lockers.
"D-Draco!" Harry practically screamed, only just starting to come down from his orgasm.
He dropped to his knees once again and spread Harry open for him, a gasp coming from the Gryffindor above him. He smirked to himself before leaning forward and licking a wide stripe over Harry's fluttering hole.
“Oh it’s alright Ron,” Harry dismissed him, “I think we should let him. It’ll be entertaining to watch him try to get words out while being used like a little fuck toy.”
“And he may have… whimpered?”
They both took a minute before moving out of their seats and towards the door.
“Shouldn’t be doing that,”
“It’s not funny!” Harry insisted, “it’s true! I thought I imagined it but then…”
Ron was still chuckling as he returned his attention to Harry, “and then?”
“You expect less?” Draco asked with some attitude, “when has a Malfoy ever not been precise?”
"If you insist," was what Draco said as he pushed into Harry.
“What if I don’t?” Harry asked, keeping Draco’s hands pinned with one of his own, using the other to lift Draco’s chin so he met his eyes.
“Fuck!” Draco called out, “Potter, m’close!”
"Please, Malfoy, need to!"
"We're going to play a game called two truths one lie, and I'm going to go first." Draco slowly rolled his hips into Potter's pushing him back flat against the wall and pressing his body firm against the pliant one beneath him, "I'm going to tell you three things. Two of them are true, one is a lie. You have to tell me which one is the lie. Do you understand?"
This was going to be easier than Harry thought. That was his invitation right there. He gave Malfoy a small smirk before pushing him back against the lockers, pinning his wrists above his head before he could so much as take a breath.
He couldn't remember when he had started to find the blonde attractive, but those feelings were definitely not helping his current situation.
Harry didn’t step back as a snake landed in front of him. In fact, he smirked, he knew Malfoy too well. He watched as the snake began to slither towards him, tongue poking in and out and a small hiss coming from it. He made no move as an owl swept down and grabbed the snake in its talons.
Draco nodded, watching as Harry took out the two needles and placed them on the floor, “ready?”
He was thrusting only two more times before he came into the smaller boy, letting his head fall forward and fending off a moan as he bit into Harry's shoulder.
Ron changed his angle, hitting Harry’s prostate straight on as Draco tugged on his hard bud. They both revealed in the squeal that Harry let out.
“You came,” Harry said, startling Draco as it was quite dark in the room. Harry waved his wand, candles lighting up around the room and illuminating both of the boy’s faces.
Draco Malfoy wanted Harry fucking Potter.
“Look how well you’re doing, you’re taking all of me” Draco praised, watching the way Harry’s eyes were scrunched closed with pleasure, “you were fucking made to take my cock, weren’t you? Such a slut for it.”
Draco was near boneless as he slung his arms around Harry, not caring that he was pulling him down to where he could barely move on him. Ron was doing a great job alone, having found his prostate and assaulting it as Draco raked his nails down Harry’s shoulders in a sorry attempt to keep him still.
So much could go wrong.
“Finished just in time,” Pomfrey announced, brushing what looked like soot off of her dress, “hour’s up boys, you’re free to go.”
“Potter?” He asked in a harsh whisper, “what the hell are you doing in here… What the hell are you doing on top of me?”
“You’re welcome, darling.”
“I was thinking,” Harry started, voice hushed as he spoke beside Draco’s ear, “you never did thank me yesterday. Shame, I’d hate to have to spank you again for that… wouldn’t you?”
“I don’t understand, what if you want to say my name during?”
“Cum for me,” Harry commanded, close himself.
“I feel like you’re trying to say something,” Draco responded innocently, tugging the sleeves of his own robe over his hands to make sweater-paws, “you know you’re always cranky when you oversleep.”
"A game?"
Draco obeyed, pearly white streaks falling over Harry’s hand and his own thighs. Harry stroked him through it, milking every last drop out before letting him go. He took his hand away, whispering a cleaning spell and petting his now clean hand through Draco’s sweaty hair as he came back down.
Ron was looking at him like he had just said he was going to blow the school up, so he continued to explain.
checking on him and slowing down when Harry didn’t respond.
It wasn’t really a question, Draco knew, but he answered anyway, “Yes.”
“You’re right,” Slughorn finally managed, chin dipping and eyes lowered. “I’m sorry.”
“Ok, well… hungry?” He lifted up the usual buckets.
“Oh dear…” the man muttered, before exclaiming louder, “By Merlin!” Slughorn nearly jumped out of his skin as he straightened, sweeping back his hair and frantically patting himself down. Peaky followed him dutifully as his master began to waddle out the room in a hurry, pausing just before reaching the hall as if just remembering Draco.

Green eyes bore into silver ones, and there was no room for mistranslation or confusion left.
Tomorrow was when they’d have two days off with no shows, as much as a break for them as the Master. It was hard to imagine their leisure-loving socialite working weekends when he could be out partying. Then again, it’s where the man gets most of the guests for his events. The Master only trusted himself to run his own show, a paranoia that afforded his magical creatures similar hours as him. Draco didn’t mind the reason, as long as he reaped the benefits.
This newfound excitement of being able to do with Harry what he used to with Luna, however, had the major caveat of reminding him of Luna often. It felt cheap almost, like Draco was possibly betraying her somehow… After seven years of friendship, he had made another friend who caused him to be as happy as easily. Draco wanted to be more concerned about it—to know what it meant about himself, but anytime that brilliant smile and green eyes were directed at him, he’d completely forget how to judge himself in the first place. That was of course, until it worsened whenever Harry would leave.
he could feel
Slughorn swallowed to clear his throat before remarking, “His is the only show of that nature.” As if it was any counter to what Harry said. Why doesn’t he explain it better?
Either way, he appreciated it. And there’d be more of that later to look forward to.
Instead of being bothered by his own reaction, he was swept up by the ensuing elation that coursed through him at the soft recognition of the beginnings of an idea he’d overlooked until now…
If he were sent back to the ocean, Draco would be back where he started. Was that worth leaving here?
The music abruptly stopped, just as Draco reached it’s top, his body aligned with its center. There, the eerie silence culminated as Draco hovered above the prongs, the middle one jutting out just a little further than its neighbors, almost grazing Draco’s member. This was intentional.
“Of course.”

The hazard of falling wasn’t unexpected.

. I call him Otter, fits since his heart belongs to the sea and all its creatures. He must be one of them.” He smirked. “Clever, isn’t it?”
He looked like he belonged in water.
Finding Luna was more important.
Draco couldn’t even look at him, not while knowing what Slughorn truly thought of him now. Any affection he’d felt for the man was complicated by everything that just transpired, kept pinned under competing hurt, fear, confusion, and anger all at once. It was already more than he could bear.
“I can’t be your mate,” Harry said, voice faltering and eyes watering. “I’m not a siren.”
Draco curled up and wished to disappear.
Draco knew no more of the world beyond the two of them as Harry pressed him on the ground by the water. Their magical cores intertwined, his song making promises as Harry fulfilled them.
Each other.
In the middle of outswimming Harry’s passionate pursuit, all the energy seemed to culminate into a point within himself that burst in on itself, flooding his body with a painful sensation of unbearable heat. His body froze, forcing Draco to stop engaging in their play, hands clasping at the spot where it seemed to have lit itself on fire.
Part of being one’s mate was to provide and offer food to the other. While Harry had checked that prerequisite off, Draco was the one that needed to prove himself and his hunting worth. Unfortunately, he had no means of food besides what Harry provided. Still, he made do.
While the dragon listened to him with unerring focus, Harry lavished the dragon with sincere, softly murmured praises.
Hermione talked Harry’s ear off, as a very not-rutting Draco enjoyed fish after fish from Harry’s fingers without a care in the world.
Touches never took place beyond where Draco’s mouth might graze Harry’s palms and fingers, or his greedy hands might hold Harry’s hands up for himself to have better access to the fish cupped in their palms.
“You’re a beauty,” Harry said honestly. “Such a strong and powerful dragon. I reckon you’re

“That was

Draco smiled, moving off of Harry as Harry sat up. The worst of his fears that he wouldn’t see her again because she had died or worse were laid to rest. Now he only had to hear where she was living. But Harry wasn’t finished.
“There’s being comfortable and then too comfortable,” Harry mused aloud, already holding out the next fish to Draco. “I worry sometimes they forget I exist when they look at each other, which is fine… but… well, maybe not.” Draco thought he almost caught a sad quality too his voice, before Harry started theorizing how many children they might have together and if that was weird to be curious about—Draco was a siren and wouldn’t know human’s standards for weirdness—which was around the time Draco stopped listening to his words entirely to pay more attention to Harry’s hands.
Only then did Harry let himself exhale too.
He reminded Harry of a Bowerbird, something he recalled from his muggle education pre-Hogwarts. The male birds were known for their meticulous building of structures from twigs (bowers) to attract mates. Malfoy was flitting back and forth, constantly judging, and micro-rearranging like the bird in the video had. Except instead of the color blue, gold was his primary decoration of choice.
Draco found this and the human’s likely very different understanding and experience around mating disconcerting. He didn’t know what he had been expecting, given that if Harry,

by siren and human standards
An impulsive dragon’s fickle mental-space held little room for negotiation. As much as collecting treasures brought it the most joy, the dragon liked to change up arrangements of them almost as much, and the most with Harry. Quite the feat considering everything else was constantly moved.
It was hard to hold onto his embarrassment completely, when confronted with a resoundingly deep resonating laugh that made some forgotten pulse in Draco awaken. It took a moment for Draco to realize what it was. The urge to return a song
with plenty of food and only one good friend, who wasn’t entirely human and who was entirely disturbing him at the moment.
It was at the point that being with Harry reminded him of Luna instead of making him momentarily forget his separation from her. Almost immediately after Harry would leave him, he would take that blessed happiness with him. And Draco would be hit with a sense of loneliness and the abject trepidation, that just like Luna, Draco might never see him again.
him. He felt another poke of heat at his lungs, and bit back the sound of pain that wanted to escape.
can tell that to the papers.” Hermione sighed, trying to remain exasperated, but a smile still graced the corners of her mouth. She obviously approved of her friend’s happiness, despite the current inconveniences it had caused.
“Thanks, but I don’t eat raw fish like you do,” Harry said, gently pushing the fish and Draco’s cupped hands with it back toward Draco.
While Draco talked Mrs. Kubyn into letting him buy out half her stock of valuable Dittany potions and then some, Harry wandered off to the shelves to the left of them.
That night, Draco hardly slept. The only thing that eventually let him shut his eyes for good was the idea there was going to be Harry

you hold for your creatures, Slughorn.” A beat later, Harry’s eyes hardened. “But they are people, not yours to keep or use for financial gain.”
“The MGPA knows nothing about proper care for these magnificent creatures and their claim of moral superiority is laughable. I ensure my charges’
“Took longer than expected.” Harry rescued two packages that were beginning to, slowly but surely, float out a window. He closed it before more could, earning him a grateful look from Malfoy.
“You’re probably wondering why you’re here. I’m sorry that wasn’t communicated to you. Most people don’t know you can understand.” Something in his voice betrayed some remembered irritation; Draco was more surprised to be given an apology at all, though not for what Draco wanted.
“I know you say you host these shows primarily to create charitable funds so you can run the care for your collection,” Harry added. “And I’ve seen those records, both published and unpublished, which would seem to prove you right.”
Draco frowned, but put it back in his mouth and began eating again.
There was a growing tautness in the tension of his body, like a coiling snake. The draw towards the open cave pushed from under his skin, which seemed to worsen as he looked at Harry in complete silence.
When he woke up next, it was to the hushed voices speaking around him. They came in and out of focus like the tide. His eyes weren’t able to see anything though he was sure they were open.
He felt the tell tale clutching within his groin, his body reacting to the arousal and accepted it within his swimming. As he danced, his member slowly unsheathed itself, unfurling into the open water for all to watch. Draco kept his front facing them, ignoring the change in his body as if it was part of the dance. Because it was.
Harry had been about to think of something relevant—but Draco smiled in his direction, looser and
Draco fell asleep again, much cooler.
Draco gently gripped Harry’s shoulder, shifting his attention away from the racing broom and toward the other items to put away.
“Name’s Charlie.” He stuck out his hand toward Draco, who shook it back after taking a moment to remember seeing Slughorn shake people’s hands like that before. Otherwise, he’d have just stared stupidly at it.
Whenever Harry would accompany Draco here, it would often catch Harry’s eye. Only because it had caught Draco's once. Two years ago, Draco had immediately taken to the vial and sung its content’s praises. Of course, only the color of the liquid itself had appealed to him, rather than the purpose of it.
But when all was said and done, other than having his voice inhibited and being forced to perform the same unchanging routine weekly, he hadn’t been severely harmed or mistreated. Certainly, he’d been asked to showcase the most intimate parts of himself—to turn himself into an object of human’s desires—but he was never forced to mate with any humans. And that was a major fortunate circumstance he had going for him, which almost made up for the vulnerability of his losing his one weapon and defense. His voice. Now harnessed and barbless.
Leaning against the wall, Harry watched Draco mutter to himself as he piled every processed item into the small trunk. Each one had to be opened, checked for any damages sustained in transit, and have their sender recorded.
But again Draco stopped him, this time grabbing his legs and tapping the toes of his boots in place to keep him where he was. It took Harry a full minute to get the message Draco wanted him to lie down, and a few more seconds to decide whether he’d entertain the request or not. He decided to.
To Draco, it sounded like the same segment of conversation they’d had a minute ago, and they’d returned back to square one.
“When you sing, it’s impossible…” Harry sounded close to tears, voice shaking, wide green eyes dark and glued to Draco.
Because Harry’s voice was Draco’s own.
—surprisingly softened somewhat.
It wasn’t.
It was at that moment when Draco was quite happy and full—possibly as a consequence of eating so hedonistically—that he let out an enormous belch, before he could stop himself. Seeing the other beginning to register with wide, about-to-be-affronted eyes, what he’d just done, Draco immediately covered his face and flung himself into the water out of sheer embarrassment.
Being a dragon just had that sort of freeing effect on Draco, where he could be as greedy, petty, gold-obsessed, and possessive as he wanted, without any guilt of his and their shared less savory history attached.
After the final box was in, Draco shut the lid and miniaturized it into his pocket along with the quill. With a cursory look over the room, he rolled up the parchment and tucked it under his arm before turning to Harry with a definitive nod.
Instead, Draco bit into another mouthful of fish as Harry mentioned his friends Ron and Hermione again, complaining—good naturedly—about their unnecessarily fervent public displays of affection when he was around.
But his fear did not stop the sound of his voice spilling out too easily, first beginning in disjointed bits and the longer ones until Draco sang a full note. And then another.
Harry immediately sagged against him, still not letting go.
As he shifted himself up and down the prong, he couldn’t look away from that one fool in the audience that wouldn’t look back at him. Perhaps he was a prude, and couldn’t bear to watch? It was maddening to remember; humans were the ones in control and he wasn’t, even here where he was a beacon that blinded them with lust. To even consider that this one will escape, not knowing his power, and thinking he could remain untouched from Draco’s grasp? In his frustration, he thrusts into himself a little too enthusiastically and makes an aborted, unplanned sound of pain which the collar quickly silences the end of.
Earlier that morning the gem-plant-bug had arrived on their doorstep in a floral-decorated jar and was now being sorted with the rest.
“Sorry about the meal mishap, mate.” Charlie reclined deeper in the chair, setting the book on his knee. “Didn’t think you’d mind some fish in the water, given that’s how they’re typically eaten by your lot in the wild.”
Still, every week, Saturday couldn’t come soon enough.
At the moment, Harry did his best to not nod off as things started to wrap up. They were close to done. That is, Draco did less adjusting of the center pile as Harry brought out his pocketed list.
He answered his own question. “Another
“I make you sick.”
Soon the two men were through the door and disappeared down the hallway. And both Draco and Luna were left alone again.
Only, there was no one else here to show off to. Because the location had to be kept secret, kept

He talked as if from experience, as if he had seen exactly that before. A human and some other creature that
Draco still hadn’t given up his mealtime ritual to eat out of Harry’s hands, which Harry always dutiful held for him. Though now, Harry had taken to cutting up the fish earlier and feeding it to Draco in bite sized  portions, a change that Draco greatly approved.
“Harry,” Hermione’s voice cut through all other noise.
.” Because, unlike bowerbirds, a dragon’s mate was both an audience and integral center-piece.
“Come here my Dears,” Slughorn called to Luna and him as he ambled toward them with weepy cheeks and open arms.
Tears fell out of Draco’s eyes, as he felt the heat within himself blossom and he opened himself up to Harry ending or beginning him. He pressed a kiss to Harry and then let his head fall back with his last wish, an appeal and invitation,
“Glad you think so.” Harry grinned, cocking his head in a way that would make the gold glint and Malfoy greedy.
“I don’t mind it,” he said again, with the sort of affectionate, wider smile—than the smaller ones Draco had been familiar with directed to him at this point—that had Draco’s thoughts grinding to a halt.
As the last part of him (fighting to be conscious for this fulfilling peace) quieted, Harry hugged the dragon head to himself.
Unfortunately, others were set on proving her uncanny forecasts true.
Draco knew how much happier Harry would be if he knew he was the one that caused it, but also the one who could
But being left there, it would be such a waste.
Looking more uncertain than Draco had ever seen him before, Harry leveraged a calculating frown at Draco, no doubt trying to ascertain Draco’s intentions. Draco tried to appear like the picture of benevolence as he gestured for Harry to follow him in.
quite yet. At least for siren standards it was.
“Back to the left then?” Harry moved it again.
If Harry did manage to get obviously sidetracked by some internal thoughts Draco wasn’t privy to, Draco sometimes would purposely flex his silver tail to reflect the light and make Harry look.
Having the one experience of being on the receiving end of Harry’s deliberate affection-filled gestures, Draco’s true potential for showing and demanding physical affection unleashed itself rather determinedly. Harry was hardly prepared for its onset.
Harry’s strangled confession pushed past his erratic breathing, “If you call for me, I can’t…”
Draco never understood why his given name couldn’t be used when spectators would be seeing his real body.
Again, Harry wasn’t going to question dragon-Draco’s abilities and logic.
It was certainly faster than setting up. Albeit, difficult in a different way. They take everything they took out for display and put it back on shelves and in chests. Every single one.
Harry and a stranger, a woman with long bushy hair wearing one of those white uniforms, came into the room, speaking animatedly to each other.
But it was alright, because Draco was able to pull himself out and they didn’t close the door. He painstakingly dragged himself across the floor, making his way toward the doorway by his arms alone. The concrete sloughed roughly against his scales but mattered little to him.
They stopped approaching him directly when they had enough of his evasive maneuvers. Soon magical spells were being flung at him, but the spells meant to be cast in air, were slower in water where Draco was faster. Still, they managed to cut off two tunnels to the other tanks, and no doubt had done so with all the others. The sheer volume of spells would catch up to him eventually, and he would be caught.
back there. He was used to getting ready for shows everyday, and found himself waking up to get ready, only to remember there would be no more audiences to come and see him. Halfway through the day, he’d feel strange at not being praised once, finding himself waiting fruitlessly to be told how beautiful and captivating he was. And he’d find himself glancing at his tail to reassure himself that his silver scales hadn’t lost any of their luster compared to yesterday. There was also the glaring difference that Slughorn, the phoenix, and most importantly, Luna, themselves weren’t here. The absence of Luna, who’d always comforted him and told him all kinds of stories and
something Harry had clearly witnessed and wouldn’t be able to forget, with Draco literally being right there. Draco wanted to shout at the man’s playing
Draco snickered at Harry’s slightly put upon expression. His laugh jarred Harry’s other hand (not feeding him bites of fish) that rested against his back, which gave him a brief squeeze.
The first time Draco had done Dragon Day with him had been meant to be a one time thing. Draco had moaned the year before, the same year he and Harry had gotten together, that something had been
. There’s that childish sense of justice, receiving what little vengeance he could for having his shackled voice released only when being put on display for his viewers. Because as much as they liked to pretend the worse of his seductive ability was tampered down by his collar, he knew-
At first, Draco had asked that his friends and acquaintances (including Harry) do the gift registry on Dragon Day entirely in place of Christmas and his birthday. A decision that Harry, who valued birthdays more than any other holiday because of his own history with it, had been vocally against until Draco relented. Ultimately, Draco limited it to replacing gifts on Christmas and made the gift registry a
Singing Harry’s name aloud in siren tongue seemed to have a profound effect on his mate. For Draco as well, hearing its syllables even from his own mouth seemed to worsen his condition.
As the dragon roared and had a good time of it, Harry sat patiently on his pile without moving like he was supposed to. Doing his best to keep his eardrums intact.
“You won’t need me, Draco.” Draco didn’t want that sort of guarantee if it meant she wouldn’t be there.
to Draco then.
The magic in the air merely thickened, unpacified. “I’m not the one deserving an apology.”
Draco nodded, but Harry still checked up on him. He looked Draco over for signs of distress or injury, while Draco calmly waited for him to finish, enjoying the attention for what it was while it lasted. Finding nothing, obviously, he turned back around, likely to resume their business with the fish.
And Harry, a human, was his
Draco’s short-lived relief stopped dead in its tracks.
“Don’t worry, I’m not here to feed you, not when you’re conscious anyway. No, I’m just here to monitor you.”
liked that one.
Draco had to pull back and sneeze at a point, which had the benefit of inspiring Harry’s laughter--easing the tension in Harry’s body that Draco hadn’t noticed building when he’d buried his nose repeatedly in Harry’s hair. But Draco had little else to show for his actions. He was making no progress like this. Besides, Harry would have no way of smelling Draco properly either, surely nose-blinded by his own false fumes.
His head fell back to Draco’s chest. “I can’t be what you need.”
, everything old and new he’d received for this day was secured in its usual spot. Nothing was missing and nothing would make it out with them.
A beat later, he was certain there was better phrasing he could’ve used. Not calling it ‘lots’ for starters.
He didn’t like the sound of that and made as much of his body language say so. He saw no reason why they had to be separated, or why Luna was so sure of herself. She couldn’t be right about this; Draco wouldn’t
Refusing to linger his attention if the other wouldn’t, Draco made a point of ignoring him back and returned to his meal, making a show of chewing fish bones as noisily as possible to drown out the man’s uninvited company. Glancing up at his still-silent friend, he was disappointed to not find an equally offended, kindred spirit. Luna did not look surprised by the newcomer’s presence nor as affronted by his lack of introduction. But her peaceful gaze fixed, oddly intent, on the rude man.
contact of a thumb grazing his cheek as he bit into the fish, Harry let go of it in shock.
Draco resisted.
But they were always careful not to engage with him, avoiding looking him in the face and eyes for too long, something that had frustrated Draco beyond belief for the first hours he’d been here. So Draco stayed far away from them near the opposite three walls of the tank instead, ducking behind some coral for privacy.

an obscured face in the middle of the crowd—chin obviously tilted down towards his lap where the program for the event lay open—that
“I was told you were that kind of person. But I didn’t believe her much since I’d already met you. And you didn’t come off as it.”
And soon they were humming each other’s names in perfect harmony as they sank back together in oblivion, spent and content. Draco’s song lulled, but did not fall silent.
All that remained was convincing Draco.
But it was worth it, as Harry took a step towards him.
Harry smiled down at him, where Draco had purposefully laid on top of Harry’s torso perpendicularly before the time he would leave. But it seemed the other had caught onto this tactic. He started gently heaving Draco off of him earlier than usual.
Harry and Hermione began discussing him again, but Draco couldn’t heed them any with Harry being so near, but not near enough.
He offered himself, his body, and his song to Harry to mate him or not. He would make it a request because that’s what his mate deserved. A
As if reading his thoughts one last time, she raised her voice, but not to say goodbye again.
But there was nobody else left, same as his last refuge of water that the wizards magically drained to trap him in the newly dry pool.
“A fearsome nightmare to behold.”
Had he done this with Harry earlier, Draco would have immediately identified him as his mate.
When Draco came to, he was floating weightlessly.
In retrospect, Draco should have realized. Yes, sirens had historically weaponized their allure against humans, but that had little to do with siren’s being promiscuous and everything to do with human’s wishing violence upon them. Human’s knew nothing of what sirens had done to survive and why. Between inspiring lust or bloodlust, the choice was easy. Sirens had weaponized their own intimate mating songs to derail and attack sailors that would otherwise have hunted them for their shiny hides. Nothing of this truth would ever occur to the minds of humans though, forever stuck on the idea sirens were sex fiends with a taste for human flesh. And Slughorn thought the same.
thing.”
Discreetly, Draco grabbed a fish himself, and then presented it to Harry to eat it in the same manner he did for Draco.
Harry had done this song and dance (the roaring and stationary-sitting equivalent) three times before. His body already braced itself for a scalier version of Malfoy, as Harry stood where Draco wanted him.
“Just think about it, when did it start? When he was alone? No. Who was with him? And who was at his side when it was taking forever to cool down and nothing was working to alleviate his heat that he didn’t recover from until they left… Only to relapse after receiving another visit?”
Draco shrugged and waited for Harry come in the rest of the way
Draco sang with his heart and soul and watched those green eyes widen for him alone. The room filled with the most wrathfully fervent song Draco had had in years, as he frantically thrashed himself against the prong instead of remaining motionless above it to sing as was his usual practice.
A shudder ran up his shoulder despite himself.
“It will be ok.”
more difficult to read than other humans Draco had met, but he had his fair share of inscrutable moments. For the following days, Draco would have to challenge both himself to communicate and Harry to understand Draco’s courting intentions.
Slughorn started to protest but Harry raised his hand, cutting him off.
Harry ducked underwater to give him a strange look followed by a sudden salacious smirk Draco wasn’t prepared for.
As it turned out, the best had been Harry’s arrival itself. Transformed, the dragon had immediately corralled Harry onto the pile of old and new gifts, grumbling irritatedly and flashing teeth at Harry until he’d moved in the
But not all of it was so straightforward. It was never that simple with dragons.
Whatever it was, Draco didn’t have access to it, his only resource being fish he could not even get himself.
“You were on fire today. Did someone special in the crowd ignite it?” she asked. He stared back into her half-fae eyes which both looked at and right through him; she was the one person he didn’t mind not giving their full mental attention while addressing him.
“Clear the room. I’ll let you know how he is, once we’ve got past the worst of it.” Harry hesitated but made his way to leave, gently pulling Draco’s hand away, who despite his weakening limbs, held onto him as much as he could.
One of the Red Robes noticed him halfway across the hallway. “Hey! It’s the siren!” The announcement was followed by others turning towards him.
After rolling up the last chain with the other jewelry she’d taken off him and setting it aside, she started speaking again while he ate.
He must be quite the sorry sight. Because a familiar hand settled on his head, causing the tears to fall as the extra weight seemed to give that final push to squeeze the emotions out of him. Once he started, he couldn’t stop, and he didn’t want to.
Neither got to sleep long. Because of ‘plans’ and the need for brevity. It was a fact that Draco spending too much with the horde could be harmful, despite how beneficial in the short-term it could be. The idea was for Draco to vent his dragon self without being consumed by it.
said sirens only ate their meals in water. It didn’t say anything about sirens liking to be hand fed or being perfectly fine with eating on a dry surface.” He nodded pointedly to Draco.
Where he belonged.
So continued his and Harry’s small exchanges over his meals, that Draco patiently looked forward to everyday. Every time Draco saw him, Draco acted as if he hadn’t been eagerly anticipating Harry’s arrival in the slightest; looking for all the world impassive. Although, judging by Harry’s altogether too-pleased greetings, Draco had the suspicion his overactive tail gave him away.
“Well, it’s not the most impressive thing to brag about your classmate giving you permission to come back to school,” Theo snapped. “And besides, that’s not the point.” He looked to Blaise.
“It’s come to this,” he said weakly, still staring vacantly at the castle wall. “My fate, in the hands of
Granger shushed them again.
He didn’t mention that Dolohov had trained him to cast it at the family of rabbits that lived in burrows under the courtyard.
“Hm?” Theo pulled his wand from his boot. “Yeah, I suppose so.”
Theo tried not to picture that in his mind’s eye, failed, and decided to focus his entire attention on a stone in the far wall that looked rather like a sparrow.
“Really?” Blaise poured a hefty pool of gravy down beside his potatoes. “I thought you might’ve missed it.”
“Pansy, seriously, I don’t need—” Theo hissed, but Blaise bumped his shoulder before he could finish. Theo’s circle of light wobbled and flickered out.
“Right, this has been atrocious,” Macmillan said, and Theo snorted. “In any case,” Macmillan added awkwardly, “I should— I mean to say, I was going to stop by Scrivenshaft’s—”
but before he could reach it, the grip on his arm released and he stumbled into the side of a desk, catching the edge to balance himself.
Theo left Potter and Draco to themselves. So did Weasley and Granger, who took a seat on a bed by the front of the bus. Theo made his way to the back, wishing he’d thought to bring a book with him, and promptly spilled half his cocoa on his trousers as Pansy flopped down beside him. Blaise sat with a bit more poise, still a little irked over the outcome of the bet.
“I’ve got to finish up with these so I can give them back to Finnigan, so
“Why not?” Draco shrugged. “I tell Blaise to mind his own fucking business every morning. It’s hardly a challenge.”
name was recognizable enough that Theo had only escaped a long, convoluted battle with the Ministry before his seventh year because of his stepfather. If it hadn’t been for the carefully penned letter detailing how Theo hadn’t contacted his father since the Easter holiday at the end of his fifth year, he might never have made it back to Hogwarts.
But even the familiarity of his peers couldn’t soothe Theo’s growing anxiety. It was rather pointless to worry, but Theo did nonetheless.
Potter gave a guilty look. “Well,” he said, looking down at his robes. “I suppose. But—”
“But since Draco didn’t say anything, and Potter didn’t either,” Theo said, “then technically we’re still on.”
Theo heard what sounded suspiciously like Potter’s voice snickering from the same area, but it was quickly muffled.
Theo stomped all the way down to the stairwell before realizing he needed to decide where to go. He settled on the kitchens, because he knew for a fact that he wouldn’t run into anything untoward there, this time.
face. “Blaise, come on,” he said. “You know Draco. He likes being dramatic. He likes winning. I wouldn’t put it past him to forget what’s at stake, just to prove a point.”
So Theo obediently stood guard by the classroom door, glancing over his shoulder every few seconds to watch Draco mutter furiously with Weasley’s voice and give his quintessentially Draco mannerisms with Weasley’s gangly limbs. It took him a worryingly short time to break into the potions cupboard, and before five minutes passed he had a cauldron brewing on one of the empty desks.
“You’re doing all right, though?” Ernie looked at the door; another handful of students passed by, not even noticing there was a shop they were running past.
“Eh,” Theo said, “I think you Hufflepuffs have been taking care of it.” He picked up the other half of his scone, which had fallen onto his porcelain plate. Macmillan didn’t say anything for a while, apparently thinking everything over. “I don’t blame you,” Theo said quietly. “Especially Finch-Fletchley and the other Muggleborns. It must have been hard not knowing who to trust, and I can’t imagine that would wear off quickly.”
This was clearly the last thing Granger had expected. It was the last thing anyone else had expected either, judging by the few intakes of breath that echoed around the common room.
“She only bullies
“Careful,” Theo said, wincing. Finnigan’s heel was digging painfully into his thigh.
And then, at long last, it was Friday afternoon. The last exam was Defense Against the Dark Arts, just after lunch. This time tomorrow their exams would be over, and Theo would finally be free. Hopefully, Draco would be too. But most importantly— Theo wouldn’t have to cart around a thousand secrets, dodge Blaise’s questions, or ignore the sympathetic looks Pansy shot Theo whenever she caught him looking at Potter for more than a second.
Finch-Fletchley rubbed his face again, looking away. “Right,” he muttered. “Well, if that’s all you wanted to point out, I think I’ll go.”
Two people sucked in air very sharply from behind the chair, and Theo nearly fell off the back of his stool as Pansy walked in, holding an armful of Christmas crackers.
“Oh,” Thomas said, “no, yeah, we haven’t covered it yet. It just makes it easier to calculate ingredient ratios for different levels of effect intensity instead of having to do it manually.” He sighed. “Personally, I think it’s stupid to make us ‘learn the theory’,” he said, making air quotes, “before we get to use the actual formula. You get the same result in the end anyway, right?”
He grabbed the keys off the counter and flicked off the lights, taking one last look at the shop before he left.
Or perhaps he should listen to Thomas and stick with the truth, despite how far-fetched it sounded when he put it to words.
“Nothing,” Theo promised.
Potter took a moment to process this, and the quick-start anger ebbed away. “So even if they wanted to,” he said quietly, and Theo knew he meant Weasley and Granger, “they couldn’t tell me they were okay with it.”
The moment she was gone, Theo looked to Macmillan. “Is she watching?” he hissed.
“Theo,” she said delicately as they took their seats for Charms. Across the classroom over Professor Flitwitck’s head, Potter waved. Theo waved back more discreetly, but saw Pansy bite her lip out of the corner of his eye. He tried not to groan.
“You know, all things considered,” Theo said, “I think that went rather well.”
He grabbed a profiterole, lemon cream this time instead of coconut. The moment Theo had emerged from the boy’s dormitory this morning, Morley had appeared out of thin air with a mountain of them, flavored with everything from coconut cream to lime curd to chocolate mousse. Theo had once again offered to send for a pair of elf-sized glasses, and Molrey had once again refused.
Potter blinked. And then his face split open into a wide, manic smile. “Zabini, you’re a genius,” he breathed, and rounded on Percy with sudden hopeful energy. “They can’t object to that. Dumbledore was my defense Witness once, remember? You were there.”
Potter ignored him completely. “With,” he began, but Goodwin raised a hand, cutting him off swiftly.
Another kick. Theo forced his tongue between his teeth so he wouldn’t split his lip.
“Yes,” he said, through a jaw locked so tight that Theo wondered what would happen if he muttered
“Promise,” Theo said, nodding. He looked at the plate of profiteroles sitting on the floor between them. There weren’t exactly tables and chairs down here, but they’d found a bit of floor that wasn’t being used. Potter and Draco were both leaning back against the wall, while Theo had to keep himself upright on his own. Utterly unfair.
Draco scoffed. “Plenty of people survive Azkaban, honestly, were any of you paying attention in fifth-year—”
Theo, meanwhile, looked over the rows of pots to the other side of the greenhouse. Potter was sitting alone, a scarf tied around his face. At least he’d gotten the colors right this time. A table over, Granger and Weasley had commandeered a pot beside Finnigan and Thomas. Potter, Theo noticed, had a broken quill beside his parchment, and was now scribbling with such force that Theo considered it a miracle he hadn’t broken the table in half already. That didn’t bode well.
that Hermione did, too.”
This was putting it on a bit thick, Theo thought. Hadn’t Potter learned anything? Now Weasley was going to start spreading rumors about Draco’s health, or his family, or something else equally ripe for gossip.
Theo didn’t like being late, but he’d forgotten to grab his dragonhide gloves and the spare pairs Professor Sprout offered were too tattered for his liking. And so he found himself jogging up to Greenhouse Six, five minutes after class had started, with his gloves under one arm and his bookbag under the other.
Potter still looked lost, so Theo tried to think of a good example. He remembered one at once, and couldn’t help smirking. “You should have seen him back in fourth year,” he said, chuckling a bit. “It took him ages to figure out why he was so furious you were made champion.”
It closed with a tinkle behind them. Damp March air hit their faces, blissfully cool and earthy, and they both doubled over, laughing.
A few people gave Potter a welcoming nod as he made his way into the common room. He set his broomstick down by Granger’s study group— it wasn’t like anyone was going to steal it, but Theo understood why Potter might want to keep it under a watchful eye— and stretched his arms over his head.
The chair lived next to the window by the fireplace. By day it warmed itself under sunlight, and by night it warmed by the fire. It was the perfect temperature at any given time, and Theo suspected it had to be under some sort of charm that kept its cushions thoroughly plump and squashy.
“Theo, what is
“Let me check,” Granger said, pulling out a handbag from absolutely nowhere. She rummaged in it for a solid minute. “Sorry,” she said at last. “You’ll just have to make do like the rest of us.”
The week had been grueling. They were fully done with review work now that it was December, which meant they were tackling the main meat of their seventh-year classes. The last teacher to hold out had been Slughorn, who had insisted on taking his time through the older lessons.
“Not good enough.” Pansy smirked, which instantly lined Theo’s stomach with horror. “And that’s why—”
Theo took a slow breath. The expectant silence rang in his ears. “I lived in the Slytherin boy’s dormitory with him for our first six years at Hogwarts,” he said. “And I lived in the eighth-year dormitory with him this year.”
Potter nodded. “Of course.”
“So give us the Galleons,” Draco said impatiently.
Playing Draco and Potter’s secret-keeper did provide certain benefits. It was nice to have Draco pour his morning coffee— now more out of a guilty conscience rather than the threat of being ratted out, which Theo appreciated. Potter had even let Theo ride his Firebolt on one memorable occasion. Theo had wound up hanging in an oak by the hood of his robes, forced to listen to Potter ask between wheezes whether he’d ridden a broom since first year.
“I see,” Goodwin said at last. “So we may take it as fact that you and Mr. Malfoy both know this spell due to your affiliation with the Death Eaters.”
Ah. Vincent.
Potter’s benefit too, he supposed. Not that he particularly cared about Potter’s well-being. Everyone worshipped him. It was hard to feel much pity for his day-to-day life.
Of course Draco’s family would be called into question. And that meant Theo’s would, too. Their fathers had worked together throughout the war, and Theo had met Lucius several times. It wouldn’t matter that Theo hadn’t seen his father since the end of fifth year, it would matter that he carried his father’s name. And whatever he said about Draco would be tainted by that association.
Theo successfully managed to turn his footstool into a toadstool mushroom that came up to his thigh, but the spots looked suspiciously like buttons. Potter didn’t fare much better, though Theo saw the examiner give him a fond smile even as she scribbled down his score. Blaise, to Theo’s surprise, produced a brilliant purple toadstool that gave off a faintly sweet scent. He didn’t say anything about it as they made their way down to the Great Hall for dinner, but his chest was puffed with pride the entire night.
“Yeah,” Theo said, watching the lot of them talk, whisper, and laugh. “I suppose there is.”
Draco huffed. “They’d throw me in Azkaban for a while. I’d get a reduced sentence because of my age and the circumstances around my involvement. Probably five years. And then they’d let me go.”
“All right, all right,” Weasley said, gingerly tucking her hair out of her face. “But, don’t forget, you
Theo told her. He was certain the rest of them had done the same, but he took care to mention that Draco had been falling while he’d cast the spell, and had neither pronounced the curse nor aimed his wand properly.
“Well,” Pansy said, “it’s more plausible than your theory, anyway.” She looked at Theo.
Draco tutted. “Please. I’ve been taking food into the library since I was twelve, I think I can manage it without getting caught by now.” And with that finishing blow, he swept down the hall with his breakfast in hand, not even bothering to glance at the Gryffindor table as he left.
“Useless, then,” Weasley grumbled. “Fine. I’ll have to do it myself. Follow me, and make sure Granger doesn’t start tailing.”
Theo said under his breath, but Pansy smacked his arm.
“Reversible ink,” Theo said, grabbing the sample bottle. He snatched a quill from the register and dipped it in the pot, then scrawled a long, jagged line across his forearm. He blew the ink dry, then turned the pot around and read the word printed on the back. The line vanished immediately, starting from where he’d taken his quill away and ending where he’d started. He showed off his bare arm, turning it to show that the ink had well and truly gone.
Several Wizengamot members chittered. Goodwin blinked. “Elaborate for us, Mr. Nott?”
Potter shrugged. “Draco spent the whole year pretending not to care about what happens today, and I’d been worried to death about it. Now he’s terrified, and I’m supposed to be the brave one, except I can’t.” He balled his hand into a fist on his knee. “I can’t do anything.”
Granger and Weasley were staring straight at them, their faces identically slack with disbelief. Weasley’s eyes met Theo’s, and he mouthed something Theo couldn’t quite make out.
Draco scowled. He looked to Potter. “I don’t believe him.”
And now Macmillan, Abbot, and Bones were gone for the holiday.
A gaggle of Slytherin girls hurried past, not noticing Theo through the crack behind the potions door. They couldn’t be older than second-years.
“Hey, Nott.”
“I’ve got time,” Thomas insisted. “Really. I like tutoring.”
“What,” he said weakly, “what were you— why did you—”
Weasley and Granger’s faces had gone the color of porridge. They looked at each other with mounting horror, Granger’s fingers white-knuckled around her wand.
And as the room exploded into chatter, Theo listened to any last chance that he’d be able to survive this year catch fire, shrivel up, and die.
“About what?” Theo said, hoping Pansy would take his feigned ignorance as a sign to drop the subject.
Thomas joined him, clasping his shoulder. “What?” he said, to Draco’s shocked expression. “We’re done with exams. Got nothing else to do tomorrow, do we?”
“I had no idea,” Finnigan said when they’d finished.
Goodwin considered him for a long second before nodding. “Mr. Nott,” she said, turning back to Theo. “Please describe this curse.”
“It was
Blaise sighed. “Fair enough,” he said, “but I still feel like something’s wrong. Pansy said you frightened her at Christmas, so if it’s something to do with the holidays… perhaps your family...” He looked at the bulletin board, like he was double-checking the Easter holiday dates. Theo knew he was just avoiding eye contact. “We’re both going to be here for this one. So. If you need us. For anything.”
“Mr. Nott, if you could please elaborate on Mr. Potter’s point?” Goodwin asked. “If not, your testimony shall end here.”
Potter checked his watch. “It’s barely four.”
True to his usual routine, Potter lagged behind nearly everyone else as the rest of the school filtered out of the hall and began making their way to their morning classes. He was still wearing the tie, and had just begun to tuck into a fresh grapefruit when Theo, Blaise, and Pansy finally left.
Also bizarre was the fact that the rest of the Slytherins were here too, with two noticeable exceptions: Gregory Goyle was in Azkaban, and Vincent Crabbe was dead.
“Well, we’re just going to have to hope that they consider that he might lie in order to get a better sentence,” Theo said. “That’s not so hard to believe, right?”
Theo clucked his tongue. “Yes and no. The Apparition Test Center is always looking for new hires, but I don’t want to un-splinch people every week. I’m waiting for something from the Department of International Magical Cooperation to open up.”
“We don’t get to stay?” Finnigan asked, and an instant blanket of fear enveloped the group. Had he spoken out of turn? Would they all be dismissed at once? Even Potter’s legs locked, and Finnigan went pink.
“I wasn’t aware Slytherins knew how to do that.”
“No,” Bones said, shaking her head. “I’ll stay.” Potter nodded his thanks.
She, obviously, had opted to take all the proper exams, and had formed a militant-style study group that met during weekday evenings and all day through the weekends. They sat around the table by the window and commandeered all the spare chairs.
But instead of acknowledging any of them, the red-haired wizard just nodded sharply and strode up the stairs and out a small door.
Normally Theo would ask Blaise for help, but he’d gone home for the holidays along with the vast majority of the school. Finnigan and Thomas wound up staying as well, along with Pansy, Macmillan, and the Patil twins. Interestingly, Weasley and Granger had both gone home, leaving Potter alone. Well, not
What was the right play? Should he feed into their assumptions? He could put on a show of turning up his nose at the idea that Draco, who came from
“He has no idea, and neither does Potter.” Theo gestured to the Gryffindor table, where Potter still sat between Weasley and Granger, tucking into a bowl of cornflakes like it was a normal Tuesday morning. “So it doesn’t count. We’re still on.”
Theo squinted. “Huh,” he said. “Well, that would explain why I’ve been using antidote structures for all of my potions. I thought that was the
Pansy sucked in so much air at once that Theo worried she would collapse on the spot. Blaise clucked his tongue, no doubt remembering that the amended date Theo had given him was
Finnigan looked at the brooms again, then back up. “Uh,” he said. “Quality Quidditch, I think? What d’you think, Dean, we get these fourth year or fifth?”
“—so he’s not exactly starting out on a good note,” Blaise finished. They all considered this.
together, not just shagging under the cover of night, not just sneaking about in abandoned classrooms and swapping clothes for a laugh. Potter’s brash personality was beginning to show in Draco's. Potter was biting his tongue to keep from lashing out and revealing that he cared. Both had changed for the other, and that could only mean one thing. Real, actual
“Exactly.” Blaise smiled, and Theo understood. Blaise had known he wouldn’t have been able to convince Granger himself, but of course she would listen to Weasley. Theo gave Blaise’s ankle a gentle tap in apology, and watched as Blaise bit his lip to hide a smile.
It was Finch-Fletchley.
“Hush up,” Potter said, folding his arms and leaning back on one of the four-posters. “I just wanted to ask you about Draco.”
“Barely,” Potter said icily. “He said it was a
“Yes,” Draco drawled, emerging from the boy’s dorms looking for all the world like he’d just spent an hour dressing himself to perfection, “I agree. What on earth was that racket— oh.” He looked at the mess of crackers under the table and sparks floating overhead. “Well,” he said stuffily. “I’m going to the library. Perhaps I’ll find some peace and quiet there.”
There were a few exceptions. Macmillan, for instance, was heading home to visit his parents.
“All right,” he said. “I get it. Just.” He took a breath. “At least try to be a little more careful?”
“Not a chance.” Granger beamed at him. “I’ve missed you far too much for that.” She kissed each of his cheeks, and then his nose. Weasley went faintly green.
After another impossibly long wait, the door to the antechamber opened. Percy Weasley stood between them and the courtroom, looking expectantly at them. Theo tried to look over his shoulder, but Draco was out of their range of vision.
The Ministry of Magic looked, to put it kindly, a bit shabby.
“...didn’t thank you yet, for that.”
The fireplace
“—must have been cursed—”
“I’m not saying that. I’m asking what would happen if you didn’t.”
Weasley thrust a hand into his pocket and pulled out a handful of coins, ignorant to Blaise’s reprimand. “Damn,” he swore, after counting them. “’Mionie, how much have you got on you?”
“What—
She pursed her lips. Draco took that to mean his response wasn’t necessarily good.
The sight made Draco freeze in surprise despite himself, but only for a moment as he recovered quickly, hiding his stumble behind a confident smile as he rode himself on the prong more roughly than usual, for the entertainment of all those present.
Hearing the rest of his mate’s name—and a new nickname to boot—had Draco smiling back.
But whatever it was,
“Alright,” Harry acquiesced.
was an important piece Draco needed, mind still reeling with ‘
For sirens, having someone hear them make such an undistinguished, gross noise from one’s mouth which was only meant to utter lovely sounds was an absolute mark of disgrace.
He wondered how Luna managed it—appearing merely human as far as most could tell. As one of the few creatures deemed without an entertainable skill or qualifying “charisma” as Slughorn liked to call it, she was stuck with odd jobs tending to the other creatures around the establishment, which she rather enjoyed. At least, she seemed to be fond of caring for Draco. But Luna never struck him as the kind of person to complain much about anything, between her mysterious silver linings and being more invested in the unusual thoughts in her own head than life’s happenings outside it. It made it that much harder to stay negative around her.
Gently, softly. He spoke, staring into Harry’s eyes. And wishing so much to convey how much Harry couldn’t,
When he looked back up to her, the panicking, protective part of him ready to drag her into the water with him, she gave him one last marvel: her expression being minutely sad. And it floored him completely into inaction for that moment.
The second item to siren courting was scent. Not just any kind of course, but that of your partner’s. The idea is being familiar with their scent will allow you to test your compatibility but also know the uniqueness of your body. It needs to stand out to you, that way you can find them easily across leagues of the ocean. Siren territories couldn’t be that large without sirens having a means of them finding and identifying each other through long distances.
“We can do our best anyway,” she said calmly.
But Draco couldn’t find himself genuinely regretting it, too happy with having enthralled those stubborn green eyes. Everything else felt dangerously inconsequential besides it and his hungry stomach as he made his swim through his tunnel to his ‘home.’
Draco couldn’t completely blame Harry for his reaction. The abruptness must have distressed his mate. Having been completely floored by it himself, Draco understood it might have looked worse than it was. But Draco had never experienced the fallout of having performed what, in retrospect, had the markings of two of the last three steps of siren courtship: a mating chase and elements of the mating dance—immediately after he’d attempted to scent Harry, another step.
he said.
The melody slipped gently out his lips as he pressed Harry’s hand to his chest. ‘Me’ he mouthed after. Then he said it again, and Harry repeated after him, eyes wide in wonder.
after-all, as Luna tended to be.
Hermione’s eyes remained unaffected as if she was used to this Harry, looking like he was at the end of his rope.
“You’re late,” Draco said, standing in the middle of the overfilled room. Several stacks of various boxes levitated around him as he scrutinized a hovering parchment. A fluttering quill scratched away above it, on alert to check off any and all fulfilled gift requests and sponsors on the list.
What about it had, aside from his pride? It would have been expected of any other creature. Slughorn had merely requested it from Draco because he was, in Slughorn’s words, the star attraction who was ‘simply stunning’—
Turning toward Harry, Draco pressed his face into the warm shirt and grounded himself, while grief overtook him. Actually stopping and allowing himself to feel everything he missed and would be missing: strange stories of beings that couldn’t exist—Bartlyles, Poltickeries, Hefelumps and Woozles; her predictions—from the most mundane to the most life-shattering which she would say in the same airy voice as anything else; her kind smiles and her even kinder eyes; the bloody plants she’d never stop sticking in her hair no matter how much they grew on her…

sense of it and give Slughorn the benefit of the doubt that in the human’s eyes, perhaps imprisoning them had been the lesser evil.
It wasn’t that hard to admit in that moment, being completely honest with himself, that Draco liked Harry. And that Harry probably liked Draco too. Though Luna could never be replaced, maybe even with her absence, Draco didn’t have to be alone after all.
Then his gaze caught
But Harry had little time to appreciate Malfoy getting dressed before they were up and moving again. Though, considerably more relaxed than before. The entire process of collecting all of Draco’s loot for the dragon to immerse himself in reversed itself. And Draco and Harry now had to put everything back to lock it all away.
Once more, the other presented the fish, this time with both hands and without dropping it while Draco dug in. As he ate, he enjoyed where the other’s skin brushed his nose and the way the fingers would twitch in response. Yes, much better than a plate.
In the meantime, Harry stayed where he'd be most useful. Out of the way. And backup for any box that fell through the net of Draco’s stretched magic.
“Can’t you figure out what’s wrong with him? Why won't his rut go away?” Harry pressed.
First tank. No Luna. His neighboring werewolf to that particular tank was also missing—the gloves and the muzzle the only evidence of his ever being there. The playpen for the baby cat-boar, their new addition to the troupe, was quiet and flipped on its side. Just two groups of Red Robes huddled together in conversation, Draco left before they could notice him—
Following through with the latter compulsion, Draco nuzzled into Harry’s neck where it smelled strongest, only equaled by Harry’s groin. But Draco was sure it would be improper for him to scent him
A bit of an underreaction after Harry had gone to all that trouble. But with all the packages Draco had received, he had plenty of objects for his attention to track at the moment. Mentioning the
He swallowed down another bite of fish and the odd sense of uncertainty. Before he could gesture for her to explain, the sound of Slughorn’s voice returned, this time accompanied by another pair of lighter steps.
Draco didn’t bother correcting her that he couldn’t say fish or anything at all, which meant it could go on forever. But this life was what he’d known for seven years now, and would probably for another seven more, so maybe she was right
The shaking in his hands spread to full body tremors. The other presence seemed to recognize his terror. Perhaps Draco wore it openly. Draco had no way of knowing what  face he was making right now. He was too lost.
Harry’s voice hitched continuously as he slammed the rest of himself against Draco, as if he wished to sing back as well, but could only manage repeating Draco’s name over and over. The mating need grew and grew in Draco, and Draco embraced it and Harry with all his magic and being.
So he kept not eating, each time Charlie arrived, because it had made Harry come the last time, for three whole days, and even when Charlie warned him it wouldn’t work by the fourth day.
For Draco, being off stage doing whatever he wanted within his confines wasn’t freedom. The only time he and others got to be truly free was when they were put on display for witches and wizards to see and gawk at in all their unclothed and unchained glory. And even then, it was the equivalent of being let loose in a bigger cage. No less controlled.

Lowering his voice, he mock-whispered, “He’d probably forgotten they were even there,” making the woman give in to her loud laughter.

Because the other had decided to and because it had been his mate.

Harry tried to be patient, but this had to be his least favourite part of the occasion. Not that he disliked Draco’s animagus in action, but for all the detailed preparation and organization it entailed. The microscopic re-positioning and gift acquiring and pre-planning that Draco was attuned to. And that Harry was deathly allergic.
A strange fleeting sensation made itself known in the back of Harry’s head. A warning perhaps.
It hadn’t been more than three seconds before the man had abruptly turned away from Draco to return to conversing with Slughorn. Draco frowned, greatly insulted. No well-earned look of awe and not even a

Another thing Draco noticed about Harry was his scar, jagged shaped and sitting on his forehead above his right eyebrow. It’s pattern that branched out was weirdly mesmerizing, like the roots of a tree. Draco didn’t understand how he could have missed it before. But now that he noticed it, he sometimes found it difficult to look away. Harry preferred hiding it behind his hair it would seem, just like his eyes. A real shame. Draco thought both too wonderful to conceal.
Draco watched, with growing hurt and confusion, as Harry turned away from him. He was quiet and withdrawn, as if he’d just been told some grave news. He turned to Hermione, who regarded him with surprise and concern.
Only this day out of the whole year, Draco used to channel his animagus form, which mostly entailed having Harry’s company and hoarding. There was no other suitable word for the latter—amassing a bunch of things he’d never use and storing it away to never see the light of day again. It wasn’t unlike a Gringotts’ vault in that respect. Treasures from previous years overflowed shelves in the grey rock face and were joined by Draco’s newest acquisitions that he strategically piled into a mound in the middle. Polished walls of the cave reflected the lights of the many flickering gold-flamed torches, creating shimmers across the ground and making objects that could glitter sparkle.
exactly, even while he was a dragon. The next year, Draco had Harry join him on a whim—with proper precautions—to spin ideas.
“Then why are we bothering with talking if we can’t even help him,” Harry said, impatiently.
Turning, he spotted the rest of the room had similar tanks of various sizes, some larger than his own. But none were occupied that he saw. At the end of the room closest to Draco, there were two large cream-colored doors that remained shut.
He lifted Harry’s chin back up to look at him.
The gifts inside the packages eclipsed all manner of shape and size and kind of object. There had to be at least twenty gifts from people Draco immediately knew, not including the few he’d gotten for himself. But Harry wouldn’t put it past the Malfoy family’s more distant connections making it well up to fifty.
It always felt right somehow in that first moment where he met his new audience. How right it was to be seen and instantly desired—that the dynamics of sirens and humans remained in some way unchanged, even though Draco was the one captured in the cage and not entrapping them with his voice…
There was no describing it, only that it was Draco’s favorite thing of everything he’d ever smelled before, the combination of musk and sweetness. It infused a powerful note of warmth around Harry that made Draco’s water even more breathable to him than before. His breath came faster even as he stilled lazily next to Harry who’s head still remained above the surface, marveling at the intoxication he had experienced just by Harry getting wet. Knowing what he had been missing, he wished to have thought of it before.
Harry didn’t breathe for a moment, and then the next he was red-faced and apologizing a mile a minute, looking incredibly alarmed. Of what, Draco couldn’t fathom.
The internal struggle taking place in Draco as he closed the cave was obvious... It showed in the way he leaned a little too forward… How his gaze was almost reptilian in its unblinking stare at their non-cave surroundings. The considering gaze never quite left the entrance of the cave for long or Harry in its periphery, like it was weighing its options in a calculating way.
Eventually he could eat no more. With a full stomach, he reluctantly pulled back from the physical closeness he still hungered after. As soon as he had, Harry stood up, stretching his back and arms. Draco wanted to poke them.
He rubbed at his stomach as if to check the skin there hadn't been pierced through after all.
It was then that Draco noticed an additional but not separate response taking place within himself, that he almost didn’t recognize at first. A heat that centered below his navel began slowly pulsating, sensitive to the rest of his body wherever it was in contact with Harry and his magic.
All friendliness he’d acquired for the clear
The lights as always were blinding as he swam out from his entrance point with the signal of his stage name. He was welcomed to the sounds of applause he could hear just as well, had he been sitting out there with them, thanks to the completely magical, invisible barrier that made up his large, floor-to-ceiling tank.
Staring at his partially translucent reflection in the glass, Draco imagined for a moment he was looking back at another siren. But his eyes had to notice his empty neck, and the memory of
Second tank that let him view into the “Winged Room”, the same. A spot clearly laid empty where several bird cages should be, a phoenix’s among them, who sometimes sang for Draco when his longing to hear his own voice was especially strong. Only some loose feathers left behind and no Luna, and footsteps entering—
And then he saw Harry, but not where he was supposed to be, but on the other side of the glass of his tank, where the people in white uniform liked to observe him from. He was alone.
Harry was almost used to the dragon by now, despite seeing him only once a year. And he was more roar than bite anyway.
Then and only then, with arms wrapped around him and the press of a close body to his own and lulling voice against his hair, did he feel something like gratitude, and warmth as the magic of the other fully accessed his soul song and magic, holding and covering it like a warm blanket that soothed him so deeply.
“Lovely,” Draco said, eyes brightening slightly.
“True masterpiece, I’ve never seen the audience so moved! Anything you want today in fish, water, new toys! Whatever you desire is on the house-” His speech was distracted by his house elf Peaky appearing suddenly with an announcement just as Luna joined them in the room.
“I’m not supposed to be here,” Harry muttered, but stared at Draco who smiled at him so happily. Draco was just glad to be able to see him, and hear him, though fainter through the glass wall.
“Draco won’t.” Harry smiled at Hermione's questioning look.
Charlie soon left, taking the bucket of fish, correctly guessing Draco wouldn’t touch it even if he left it for him.
“Hello, Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Potter. How may I help you gentlemen today?” Her violet eyes landed on them and her friendly smile beamed wider.
Like this, he cried until he was gone to the world.
Draco frowned. What had Harry thought when seeing him aching for him then? Draco’s response had been one for his mate, but Harry’s… hadn’t. For the first time, Draco thought Harry might not find him mate worthy after all.
Draco didn’t look up at Harry as he left, staring at the ground and then down where his answer awaited him.
Forgoing the human interpretation of the sound of his name that Luna had given him, in that moment Draco told his mate his real name.
Draco put a hand over his face and slowly dragged it down. “Merlin’s ballsack,” he groaned. “Harry, if you don’t get us found out,
It hadn’t been the most graceful of exits. He and Potter had been gently kicking one another under the common room table one afternoon, until Draco had had enough and announced he was moving to the library, ears pink. Potter left not five minutes after, claiming he needed the bathroom. Neither returned for half an hour, and when Theo had left to escape Thomas’s latest Golpalott lecture he’d caught them rushing back in the seventh-floor corridor. Draco hadn’t appreciated getting a reminder that showing up together after a thirty-minute absence wasn’t wise.
. A little ways away, Weasley just stared open-mouthed and Granger, holding his arm, had tears in her eyes.
Finnigan and Thomas rushed over to clap Potter on the back, Macmillan whacked Draco’s arm with all the strength he could muster, and Finch-Fletchley swore in victory, his voice echoing off the tall, cold walls. Longbottom stood awkwardly by Potter, not sure what to do or say, but Granger slung an arm over his shoulder and he smiled then.
Theo felt sick. Blaise and Pansy caught his eye, and the three of them hurried out of the exam room.
didn’t want to be here either,” Theo said, relief making him butter his scone with perhaps too much force. It broke in two, one half clattering onto his plate. “But I had to say yes. Once Pansy sets her mind to something, there’s nothing that can stop her. Except maybe Blaise, but
Potter looked like he was going to throw up.
“Did you hear Perce, though?” Weasley was telling Granger. “He wants Malfoy to get off, I can’t believe it. He mentioned he was picked for a big project when I saw him over Easter, but I didn’t realize he meant
Abbot was following Bones home for the holiday, and Weasley was the only other one visiting family. It would be his family’s first Easter without his brother, and from what Theo had heard through the grapevine, Christmas had been somewhat of a shit-show.
Theo stared. Potter was biting his lip expectantly. “You can’t be serious.”
The door opened again, this time much more violently. Finnigan, Thomas, and Macmillan burst in with a roar of laughter, completely ignorant to the two people they’d just squished behind the door.
Theo shrugged. “Trying to keep Draco from throwing himself into Azkaban, why d’you ask?”
Potter, who stood two feet from Draco’s chair, had stiff arms and locked legs.
“Well, maybe,” Pansy said crossly. “You don’t know what happened, Blaise. Someone could have cursed him.”
He spoke the last few words in an uncanny impersonation of Draco’s spiteful drawl.
The fact that Potter was wearing a Slytherin tie
Theo instantly realized that Weasley would have been a better target for this particular pitch, but there was no going back now. “Think about it,” he said, “if they don’t want it getting public before their date comes up, then they’ll keep quiet.”
January marked the beginning of their second term, and with it came Golpalott’s fifth law in full force. Slughorn, after spending almost their entire first term reviewing sixth-year material, had then needed to condense the seventh-year material into the remaining two terms. Granger eventually conceded that Thomas could lead the study group for their potions assignments, which Thomas had boasted about for exactly one week before getting eight requests for copies of his notes.
“But of course he—” Blaise scoffed. “He told them about the whole thing!”
A sliver of cold air squirreled down Theo’s neck and he shivered, pulling the door shut behind him. No one had noticed his late entrance. Everyone was still talking to one another in barely-hushed voices, hunched over the greenhouse tables like they were afraid of getting caught.
“Trust me.” Pansy punched his arm.
and a rush of green flames, the two of them vanished.
this?
“I’m fine,” Theo assured her. Well, maybe that was a bit suspicious. “I’ll be fine,” he amended.
Molrey was nowhere to be found when he arrived, and the elves that greeted Theo in his stead presented him with a plate of hand pies. Theo accepted them politely, and set them on top of his bookbag. He sat beside it and rested his head on his fists, thinking hard.
Hugging Theo in a hallway wasn’t enough for Potter. Over the next few weeks he became suddenly and unbearably friendly, and either didn’t realize or didn’t care that he was doing everything in his power to draw attention to the two of them. He took to smacking Theo’s arm whenever they passed one another between classes, catching Theo’s eye during classes and smiling, and even visited the Slytherin table one afternoon at lunch to let Theo borrow his copy of
In Theo’s opinion, Draco was still pompous, stuck-up, and a prat— more so now than ever— but it didn’t seem like the right time to point this out.
“Yeah, all right, I'll see what I can do,” Theo said quickly, cutting Potter off before he started steaming out the ears. He made a mental note that Potter tended to go on the offense when he felt attacked, rather than clamming up to defend. He was a Gryffindor, so it tracked.
Draco blinked.
Macmillan cleared his throat, and Theo snapped back to attention. “Look,” Macmillan said, “this has been. Er. Fun.”
Almost everyone was staying at Hogwarts.
Theo,” Draco snapped. Then, at Theo, “Did Blaise put you up to this?”
He’d blasted a small crater in the floor, the iron chains that had bound his hands lying in a charred heap at his feet. He must have summoned Draco’s and Goodwin’s wands nonverbally. How long had he known he’d be coming here? Goyle had never struck Theo as someone with the skill for wandless magic. He imagined Goyle sitting in his cell, practicing the incantation, summoning dead flies and rats until he could catch them in midair.
“Most of the Gryffindors are in on it too,” Theo added, wondering if Potter truly was more dramatic, and he just hadn’t hit a nerve yet. Sure enough, Potter rounded on him, eyes wide.
Blaise snorted. “Sounds moony to me.”
Granger smacked his arm. “Ronald,” she chided, “honestly. You have absolutely no tact.”
“Ooh,” Pansy cooed, “Potter wants you to go check out his
He’d known it was only a matter of time before Pansy brought it up, but he’d hoped she’d hold off a little longer.
Draco had a slightly different train of thought, as he was staring at Potter with what could only be described as besotted awe. Theo was almost tempted to call it cute.
Pansy took the bait immediately. “Theo,” she said sadly. “This is what I’m talking about. You can’t just hope it’ll go away. You need something else to focus on.”
Draco, whose attention was almost completely on Potter by this point, waved his concern away. “Don’t tell him why,” he said, as though this were obvious. “Just let him assume you have your reasoning, he’ll come up with an excuse on his own."
“Not important,” Draco said quickly, pulling the little pit out of his pocket again. “This is a bezoar. Theoretically,” he said, striding towards the potions classroom, “if I mix it with the catalyst ingredients for a Polyjuice Potion— along with a dash of bubotuber pus, obviously—” He pushed through the door, still babbling nonstop. “I should be able to make this blasted potion wear off before—” He broke off, suddenly looking at the door behind them. “Stand watch,” he told Theo. “In case Granger really did tail us. You never know. She and Weasley both know about that stupid cloak, she could be anywhere.”
Weasley gave his brother a contemptuous look before turning to Potter and patting his shoulder. “It’s no use. Don’t start a fight, yeah?”
Every once in a while Theo would wonder which N.E.W.T.s Vincent was taking in June, or notice his absence at Hogsmeade. And though he knew better, sometimes Theo still looked to the ceiling when the owls swept in for the morning mail, wondering whether his father would send word today.
“And that landed him in the hospital wing?” Theo said, knowing where this was probably headed but wanting to hear Potter say it anyway.
“Ronald,” Granger muttered. “You don’t know that. This might work.”
thinks it’s got something to do with Potter.”
Honestly. Potter had stolen a
“That’s not the point,” Theo said. “And if you can’t wrap your thick skull around that, maybe you’d be better off spending time with Greg. D’you think he and your father are chums, these days?”
“Yeah,” Theo said. “That sounds pretty bad.”
“But did he specifically force, coerce, or influence them to come clean?” Granger asked shrewdly.
“Oh,” she said softly. “It went that badly, did it?”
Blaise, who had been standing silent guard behind Theo while he still carried the extra wand, made a strangled sort of sound in his throat. Theo ignored this.
A long silence followed this, in which Draco began cutting his sausages. The end of one fell onto the table. He scowled at it, as if it had done him a personal disservice, then began to eat the untainted slices still on his plate. After a moment he looked back up at Blaise, Pansy, and Theo. “What were you three talking about, anyway?”
Theo’s stomach gave a funny jolt. “I recognized the spell,” he admitted.
“With all due respect, Ms. Granger— which is a lot— we are hardly going to deify Mr. Potter within this court,” Goodwin said evenly. “He has judgements just as the rest of us, and those judgements can be clouded.” She raised an eyebrow. “As can the rest of ours.”
This, he thought, was a very good closing line. It would pair nicely with a proper dramatic exit, but he was perfectly content here in the cozy glow of the kitchens. He sat back down, porridge in one hand, and picked his book up with the other. Finch-Fletchley watched him for a full paragraph before sitting down beside the wall himself, and soon Theo heard the tinkle of a fork scraping porcelain.
Blaise snorted. “As if Draco has that kind of patience.”
“Wait,” said a small voice. Justin Finch-Fletchley emerged from a shadowy corner, standing up straight. “I haven’t gone yet.”
Draco blinked again, slowly. He looked down at the empty goblet, frowned, and then began to search for more sources of caffeine. As eighth-years, they were technically allowed the use of Pepper-up Potions and the like because they were of age, but those were a pain to brew and a bigger pain to drink without attracting a crowd of desperate O.W.L. driven fifth-years. Coffee was a much more practical option.
“What do you mean?”
a Slytherin, and you’re being nice to me.”
Pansy nodded, going back to her dinner.
“What?” Weasley stared blankly at her. “Yes,” he said after a moment. Then— “I need to take a shower.”
“Torture,” Weasley groaned.
“Lucky,” Finnigan groaned. “I don’t like working with
“Almost got it—” Finnigan grunted, “—yes!”
For someone on parole, Draco sounded remarkably unconcerned with picking a fight. Not that Granger, Weasley, or Potter were the voice of the Ministry, of course, but most of the castle tended to get on their good side nowadays. Draco, apparently, wasn’t interested in sucking up.
Goyle’s chest rose and fell in rapid succession as he glared up at Potter with pure hatred. He sucked in a sharp breath, and the wands in Theo’s pocket twitched violently. Theo slammed a hand over his robe pocket to keep them from flying out.
And then, horribly, “I swear I saw a Death Eater use that exact curse—”
he thought idly as he dug out a new quill and set back to work.
Theo put on his best
“I can’t just change my date,” Theo protested.
Theo gathered his coat from the little room in the back, along with his satchel of money and his wand, which he stuck in his boot. He stuck his hands in his pockets, looking for his gloves, and pulled out the letter Blaise had given him last week. He smiled, and slipped it back in his pocket.
Potter went pink and hurried them towards the back of the Atrium. They reached a set of golden gates, behind which was a smaller hall fitted with two dozen lifts that provided transportation to the Ministry’s various floors. They couldn’t all fit into one lift, so Potter ordered them into smaller groups. He consulted his Ministry notice for a moment before instructing them to head up to the second floor, then headed for a lift himself. Granger and Weasley followed him, along with a handful of eager-looking Ministry officials. Theo caught one last glance of Potter’s scarlet face, flanked on either side by Weasley and Granger’s pity, before the lift doors closed and he was gone.
“Where’s the sugar,” Draco muttered. “Ah, there.”
Draco, still bound by enchantment to the well-worn wooden chair, had his head pressed to the back, trying to get as far away from Goyle as he possibly could. Goodwin was holding her empty palms up, standing defensively behind the podium. The forty-seven Wizengamot members were frozen in place too. Theo didn’t doubt they had their wands, unlike Goodwin, but they wouldn’t chance startling Goyle.
And with another
Potter swallowed, but to Theo’s immense surprise and relief, he didn’t push it. The last thing they needed was for the court to hold Potter in contempt.
“I should hope so,” he said loftily, though the effect was rather ruined by the promise of tears by the edges of his eyes.
“Shh,” Weasley hissed. He tugged a tapestry to the side and clambered down the set of stairs that led to the Hufflepuff common room and the kitchens. Theo followed, as the pit in his stomach began to sprout. They emerged on the other side and nearly bowled over the Patil twins, but Weasley didn’t bother apologizing.
“Potter actually went to Draco’s first trial in person,” Blaise explained. “It gave his testimony more weight, but also brought a lot of attention.” He let out a long breath. “Whatever happens today, it'll be on the front page of the
“By hiding like a coward.”
This explained everything. If word got out to the public that Potter was dating, actually
“Harry,” Draco said, exasperated. “He’s a Slytherin, what did you honestly expect when you told him to help? That he’d be kind out of the goodness of his heart?”
Draco hugged him fiercely, his pale arms wrapping in a tight circle around Potter’s waist. Potter embraced him back, tucking his face into Draco’s neck, whispering private things. Theo caught the barest glimpse of tears on Draco’s cheeks before he buried his face in Potter’s shoulder, shoulders shaking.
“Don’t distract from the matter at hand,” Draco said, pointing to Theo. “He’s blackmailing us. This is
Blaise stood in front of him, touching their shoulders together briefly in a silent signal. He’d seen.
Hardly any of them felt relaxed once the Easter holidays began. Theo was starkly reminded of their third year, when they’d truly believed themselves swamped because of the added exams for their electives. How naïve they’d been.
“We’ll talk later,” he said under his breath, as Weasley tried once again to start a conversation. “They’ll send me out to tell you when it’s over. Now
With snow on his tongue and a half-forgotten song in his throat, Theo stepped out into the cobbled street to meet his friend.
Meanwhile, Theo still didn’t know what he really wanted to do once he finally left Hogwarts. He favored charmwork over anything else, simply because it was so practical, but there weren’t many interesting professions that specialized in charms. He doubted Professor Flitwick was going to hop the twig anytime soon, and Theo didn’t especially fancy himself as a teacher, anyway.
Weasley said nothing.
“No,” Potter said, “I want to hear it. What would you rather I do? Tell the school? Send you a Howler at lunch?”
The suggestion that Weasley would go behind his friend’s back and place a bet on his sex life was enough to break Granger out of her incessant pacing. She stopped short, goggling at him. “You can’t be serious.”
“I’m not hearing a ‘no’,” Potter said, folding his arms. “By all means, then, let’s just cart you off to the Ministry tonight.”
“All right,” Blaise conceded, “but that still doesn’t change the fact that they’re going to be biased. Draco’s father went to Azkaban for admitting he’d been housing the Dark Lord—”
he thought bitterly as he reached the bottom of the hidden stairwell. He crept out from under the tapestry, trying not to let any of the younger years spot him. Sure, they’d figure out how to sneak around the castle in their own time, but the eighth-years weren’t supposed to encourage that sort of behavior.
“And the only one I’m going to pass is Muggle Studies,” Finch-Fletchley snapped. “Because being a Muggle is the only thing I’m good at doing.” He tutted. “Your lot,” he said, and Theo took that to mean
“Harry’s got an inch, he’s going to take a mile,” Weasley insisted. “And besides that,
And then, of course, it all went tits up.
Lightning struck, igniting the lake in a brilliant white light for a fraction of a second before vanishing in an instant, and in that moment Theo saw Potter’s face in absolute clarity. He was looking at the back of the chair by the fire with wide, fearful eyes. He’d been uncharacteristically silent ever since Draco had spoken, and as Theo tightened the grip on his book, he suddenly realized
They’d had to choose between three different potions ranging in difficulty to brew within the allotted time. The only ones who seemed pleased with their results were Thomas and Granger, who eagerly swapped details about how their steam had been the sufficient shade of indigo, and how they’d remembered to stir counterclockwise twice every three minutes.
“And he wasn’t impartial,” Potter added. “Fudge knew that, and he still let Dumbledore speak for me.”
Blaise scoffed. “He’s not going to get thrown in Azkaban for bickering with Granger, Theo.” He frowned. “What are you playing at?”
would go well with delicate French
Potter took the wand carefully, like he was cradling a newborn. Theo resisted the urge to judge him for this particular show of theatrics. He was facing the possibility of this wand being the only thing to comfort him for five long years. A little dramatism was acceptable.
Potter reached down, grabbed Goyle’s collar, and pressed the tip of his wand to Goyle’s throat.
Beside them, Blaise ignored this. Theo wasn’t surprised. If they were truly concerned about him, Blaise wasn’t likely to show it unprompted.
“That’s different. Father is weak, and a coward. He has nothing left to live for, save for me.” He snorted. “Not that I matter terribly to him at the moment.” He gave Theo a sad, resigned smile. “If he knew about this, I doubt I’d matter at all.”
Theo moaned.
“Er,” Theo said. “He did?”
Blaise smirked. “And what is?”
in the first place. If Potter sided against him, a fight was sure to follow.
Potter cleared his throat loudly. “Madam Goodwin, what does that have to do with Draco’s case?”
Pansy and Blaise had still refused to tell him who his supposed date was. Even Finnigan had refused to speak when Theo cornered him after class one day. The second the word “date” came out of Theo’s mouth, Finnigan sidestepped him and scampered out of the Potions classroom without another word, grinning like a loon.
“It was supposed to be his hair,” Draco said, after he’d stopped furiously muttering to himself. “I didn’t intend on—” He tugged at the mass of ginger hair on his forehead. “This.”
“I think something’s wrong with my Firebolt,” Potter said. “I was wondering if you could come give it a look.”
Weasley swore, pulling out a pair of gloves, examining them, and tossing them away. Theo stared. Weasley was supposed to be miles away right now. Why was he here? And why on earth was he snooping through Draco’s trunk? Theo watched, dumbfounded, as Weasley pulled out an ornate looking box that had to be worth more than anything he owned himself. He opened it, pulled out what looked like a peach pit, and stuffed it into his pocket, dropping the box onto Draco’s bed without a second thought.
But even sugar and lemon couldn’t help make his damn equations balance. Thomas’s notes made sense in a way that the textbook didn’t, but not a single one of Theo’s example potions would work on paper.
Weasley frowned. “Mate, it’s only half past seven. Why—”
“Wait,” Macmillan called.
From what Theo had overheard from the chair, it was the first time they hadn’t stayed at Hogwarts with him for Christmas.
Potter smacked Draco’s shoulder. “We were
“Oi,” Pansy barked.
Draco let out a long, quivering breath, and Theo only realized it was actually a laugh when it ended and Draco turned to him with a smile. He clearly hadn’t meant to give one, but the damn thing wasn’t going anywhere.
Satisfied, Theo turned on his heel and made for the door.
“I don’t care if he’s trying to be a better person,” Weasley said, shrugging unapologetically. “He’s still a git.”
after this!”
Two hours later Theo pushed the boy’s common room door open as silently as possible. It creaked, and someone on the other side of the room shifted. Theo stepped over to his bed, trying not to trip over the array of clothes and debris that had migrated there around the second week of term and would probably remain until their last day at Hogwarts.
Draco returned three days later and regaled anyone who asked about how his mother was growing weak with grief over the inevitable loss of his father, and had simply needed someone to care for her for a few days. Potter showed up a day later. Theo could only hope that he’d come up with a more believable story, since Draco had depended wholly on his listeners being too sympathetic and awkward to ask any questions.
“Not everyone would say that,” Theo said. Macmillan didn’t argue. “I’ve known Draco since we were in our first year,” Theo continued. “It’s hard to know someone for that long and not think they deserve a second chance.” He looked at Macmillan. “But you didn’t know him at all.”
“That’s different,” Potter said dismissively.
“He’s probably the only bent bloke they could find,” Draco pointed out. “You know, besides us.”
Theo blew out the candle. He flapped a hand over the smoke to disperse it as quickly as he could, leaned back, and nearly fell off the stool again.
“Of course it is, you’re involved.” Theo pushed the earmuffs back into the bin, toppling a stack of old textbooks. “I assume he wasn’t really attacked?”
Potter chewed his lip. “I suppose,” he said thoughtfully. “You’ve got a point.” He sighed. “I feel like an arse.”
“They brought him here to testify again,” Potter said weakly. He looked at the wall, behind which they’d heard bangs and shouts hours before.
Every year since, now and the past two, Harry was a part of it.
______________
And Harry had saved them both.
His member bobbed freely in the water outside his parted slit as he kept his hands raised and clasped above his head, his hips never stopped their swaying. The human’s heads swiveled to follow his every movement and action, willing puppets at his command. He  eventually twirled himself slowly downward to the base of the trident, his member jutting fully and dragging in the water, only to slow and slither his body up and around the trident’s base.
As Harry understood it, they were bottling up dragon greed or something equally ominous, by leaving it behind and locked away.
Those eyes that incensed such passion in Draco had yet to escape him again. Draco was intent on keeping it that way, just wanting
Harry stopped, looking caught between their orders.
Draco was unable to keep the smugness from his face as he looked down at the crowd with half-lidded eyes. As easy as breathing, he didn’t even have to
Again, the only sense that welcomed him was dread.
An unknown amount of time passed before their voices reappeared, this time with indistinct colors swimming over Draco’s vision. A blob of white hovered over his face, with two more blue blobs that might have been eyes.
Draco watched Harry’s jaw and fists clench at this. He wished he could tell him how truly simple it was to solve.
taken. And the fae do not rescind their claim on those they’ve marked, let alone those that are their own flesh and blood. He wasn’t all that surprised and even understood why she would accept being taken to them. After all, those were her own people—family that she would prefer to return to, compared to Draco who had none.
“I think we have a problem,” Hermione said evenly.
as it were, only left him one tank he currently inhabited—albeit larger than the others he’d had with Slughorn. But he had no free movement around the facility to occupy himself, nor a specific tank dedicated to his privacy. In that regard, this was a downgrade from Slughorn’s network of tanks made for Draco. Not to mention, the considerable lack of neighbors beyond Draco’s tank might imply he was the sole creature there, which was becoming an even larger concern of his than his reduced area of travel.
Draco didn’t want to be
“I don’t mind. It’s just a burp!”
Disbelievingly, he lifted his head the rest of the way at him, tired but curious.
Without any introduction, Harry launched into answering the questions that had been silently festering in Draco since he’d found himself there.
Draco’s confusion mounted as his mind reeled. Harry’s being human had never mattered to Draco’s consideration of him as a mate, except figuring out how to navigate human mating differences. And so Draco never thought about if it would be an issue for Harry. And now he was learning it
Draco knew, if it had been anyone else not his mate, he wouldn’t have responded this way.
dangers to their lives are!” Slughorn said with so much passion, only to seem to recall who exactly he was talking to and caught his breath.
“-Highest class of medical care and food and pristine living spaces… As you can see, I treat my charges very well.” Slughorn gestured to the room and let the other man through the entryway.

which thoroughly weakened his resolve to not be tempted.
“Figured
occurrence—the only thing left is it could be something wrong internally.”
But when Harry had tried to pull away earlier, his magic had grown and burrowed its way into Draco’s lungs. The magic was comforting and lilting just like the hands carding in his hair. He felt that familiar rustling of his own magical core. But unlike before with a magical collar to keep his own at bay, it didn’t merely stop with being stirred. When the other’s magic touched his vocal center, his own reacted and
“Draco, It’s time!” Luna called into the shaded area of the pool, where she had rightly assumed he was.

far.”
The elf stretched on his tiptoes to speak in his ear while Slughorn tilted precariously to the side to listen, while Draco and Luna shared curious looks. His earlier jubilant face paled considerably as the house elf finished.
Draco pressed himself against the glass as if it would bring Harry closer.
Draco wanted to ask.
Draco noticed the doors opening behind her again where Slughorn and Harry had disappeared—only for two men in red robes the same as Harry’s to enter the room instead. Draco began to panic as they came up to them and stood by on either side of Luna, who still hadn’t turned away from him.
“It’s the last show for the day and then you can sleep all you want tomorrow,” she added. To which, Draco snorted.
Once he’d finished the last of it, he saw Harry standup from the corner of his eye. He grabbed the bucket and fish bones around Draco. As he turned, Draco felt a gentle pat on his head, the most that Harry had touched him of his own accord, and he looked up at the human in his shock.
On cue, Draco felt the telltale buzz against his throat that silenced his voice once again. Used to not speaking, the frustration at having his voice suppressed had died in him a long time ago. Regardless if he could sing, no listener existed who could understand the full meaning within his melody.
“So his body is likely undergoing detoxification-”
Musical and lovely... but not
The simplest answer was usually the correct one. Harry was a liar.
The Master, Slughorn, was not an altogether awful man, aside from treating them like collectibles, he regarded and cared for his collection well. He valued them in his own way and wished for them a positive experience while in his management, even taking requests from those that could speak as rewards for good behavior and being mindful of their physical health. As for the bad apples, he carefully screened such individuals to never even be accepted and interrupt the peace he’d so far scrupulously cultivated, since the incident with a certain “You-know-who”, something before Draco’s time there that the oldest members of their troop refused to speak about. But still, there was no masking their status of unwanted captivity, no matter how much the Master fed and praised them for their hard work.
When he woke up, fully for once, he was surprised to see a familiar face he’d thrown fish at sitting next to him. It was the same red-haired man who had first meant to be Draco’s keeper and the start of a series of repeated rejections until Harry.
“Because that’s what sirens do,” Slughorn said instead, looking puzzled that it was even a question. “They enjoy seducing humans. It’s just in his nature to whore himself around.”
“I’m going to need help.” Her wand pointed suddenly and a silvery creature Draco had never seen before came out the end. “Madame Pomphrey, the patient is relapsing into fever.” The animal disappeared and then she turned her attention back on them.
Someone he was meant to have the deepest magical and emotional bond with. His only mate.
It was nice. As far as Harry’s baser instincts were concerned, perfect. Forgetting the larger world outside the two of them and their cave was too easy like this.
Pulling back, he shook his head, dabbing his watery eyes on his sleeve. “Ah, I will miss your peculiarities, Lovegood.” He gave her one last pat on the shoulder, before he set upon Draco.
Harry only had to look back at Draco to see it—to feel it too: the urge to throw the both of them back in, to be locked away themselves. Like Draco didn't want Harry to leave. Like he didn’t want to leave either.
one. What else could he call that hand, which knew him for less than a day, taking from his neck the weight that had been solidly a part of it for seven years? Freed from or
Harry said as much, “Just seems like a waste.”
The debate that followed between the people beside him flew away into the abyss of more heat.
The collar buzzed just in time. Draco’s song hit him, full force, out his lungs then: angry to be heard for something different, proudly refusing to be defied where he was meant to shine, and longing for what it deserved—this new shade of eyes to acknowledge his irrefutable
The impulse to hoard something away for safekeeping, Harry could understand. But he struggled to reason with collecting objects that will never be used.
Draco used his voice to make it sound like he was behind him when he was actually hiding behind a bit of coral, startling Harry when he tackled him, but he immediately let go of him again to start fleeing Harry himself. This was what it must have felt like to be a snitch chased by Harry, exhilarating.
“Of all the irresponsible things you’ve done, this has to top it. Because of this incident, we’re going to have a review. Not just from the HR department—
After several apologies for his laughter mixed with intermittent chuckles, Harry finally convinced Draco to come back out of the water to finish his meal. Draco did indeed eat but for once out of his own hands, as he obstinately kept his back to Harry for the rest of the time.
Keeping his face relaxed, Draco lowered himself fully upon the middle prong, making them watch inch by inch as it disappeared into his body, creating a picture of a fish speared perversely on a fork. It was fitting since many of them would eat him if they could. His master, preferring more lasting sources of income than a one-time meal ticket, blessedly held no such interests.
“All of it,” Harry nodded, reaffirming to Draco for the third time that
Amid his tears and joy, a mix of loss and laughter as he ripped off his kelp collar for good, and the sensation of his voice and his magic unlocking itself, Draco shook his head and finally said what he meant to say that day, singing lowly just a single note.
about his time spent with Harry involving greater physical contact. Harry seemed slightly startled by Draco’s new attitude and excessive preoccupation with having as much of himself in contact with Harry as possible.
Luna,” Slughorn smiled, and then clapped his hands together, re-donning his jovial self.
Rather than calming him, Green-eye’s patient expression had the effect of unravelling the Slug Club owner further. Slughorn shook his head, spouting apologies.
He didn’t know when it started. He just knew it didn't feel like it would end, just like this nightmare wouldn’t. Nothing felt real. And nothing was left to stabilize him. No metal covering his throat and no Luna.
No gift would come outside of the cave once it made it in. Even the broom Harry had been eyeing the entire time and pretending he didn’t want. Despite being perfectly capable of buying it himself.
“Do you know why you’re here, Draco?”
______________
Scanning the room scrupulously as if something had to be missing, Draco asked, “Everything has been put back, then?”
“Just tell him and the rest of them the truth,” Harry answered, completely relaxed as he moved his hand from Draco’s back to hold Draco’s hand instead. “That we’re together.”
“You blew it, Harry,” she said sternly. “Completely, out the water—out of
Hermione glanced at Draco, who watched them both earnestly.
Draco started singing. The more he sang the stronger he felt, even with no food in his belly.
“Alright, just a little longer.” His voice seemed deeper up close, and his hand on his back felt warm. As shameless as it made him, being held like that… Draco knew what he felt for Harry was somehow stronger than what he felt for Luna.

“It’s alright.”
Memories of being out in the ocean, alone and with nobody to call his own… Sleeping on an empty stomach in that cold and silence that went on and on and on. He already knew what real freedom was:
, to exist as something real and not merely legend to humans beyond this little world.
“And why is that?” Harry pressed. Draco’s tail flickered impatiently in the water.
Draco went back to work on his own. But before he did, his hand gave Harry’s head a small, affectionate pat that could have been more encouragement to remain where he was seated, or acknowledgement of Harry’s patience for Draco’s dragon-induced lesser reasonableness. Maybe both.
Red Robes moved outside all five of his tanks, and near all the tunnels interconnecting them.
, the collar and its removal, made everything seem to stop for him all over again. And then he wanted nothing to do with anything.
For a moment Draco had the desire to attack him just because he could defend himself. He finally had the option with his newly freed voice, and he wanted to use it. But just as easily as he thought it, it passed.
She hardly minded her fingers being wet as they returned to her own hair. Luna never dried them off after touching him like others would, one of many things Draco liked about her. Like the plants she wore having a penchant for gradually taking root in her clothes and hair.
even if it wasn’t the one Draco wanted. Even if a final rejection, would break him.
’ and ‘
How could Harry forget the date, now an hour or so later, wearing his ‘best’ robes and sitting inside the biggest cavern he will ever step foot in—a tall, expansive, and glittering cave that put even the Chamber of Secrets to shame with its sheer height and extravagance, alone.
Instead, Draco was left staring at the metal collar in Harry’s hand, uncomprehendingly. He saw no kind act behind it, but a
It felt like hours, but it was likely only minutes, he was left there waiting for them to come and take him. The men in red robes did not fail his expectations, filing into the room, and immediately approaching him. They made obvious attempts to communicate with him to get out of the water and to come with them. But Draco didn’t cooperate with any of them. He would fight to his last breath. Whether they meant well for him or not was irrelevant.
supposed to be?
Just the sort of thing a dragon enjoys. Along with his Merlin Medal of Honor (for defeating a Dark Lord), Harry’s trusty cloak, and a snitch pin (actually made of some sort of pure goblin-gold). It was more garish than Harry cared to dress.
But Draco didn’t care about any of it, only watching the man unable to stop watching him now. Though drained, he smiled for that one human in the crowd, beaming at the green eyes he’d caught, and wishing he could sing of his victory.
“Once you rule out the external factors—which all past siren research never mentions as a possibility because it is a

,’ he mouthed, pointing to himself. Slughorn’s shocked comprehension and guilt following it were worth the effort.
Draco reached for him, almost beseechingly, as the heat worsened. Harry noticed, and stood next to him again as Draco clung to his front, breathing more and more laboured by each second.
He ripped into the fish, feeling quite ravenous and uncaring how messily he did so. Luna wasn’t one to judge.
Maybe somewhere along the way being told what to do every day had been a sort of freedom and he was terrified to make any decisions on his own again.
Draco didn’t need to be told. He understood then, Harry wasn’t going to be feeding him anymore. But Draco couldn’t let that happen without his displeasure being
It was the same for the muzzled and mitten wearing wolf shifter in the cage next to his tank, who’d given up on conversation with Draco entirely a year ago once he understood Draco’s voice was magically restrained. The master took special care to lock away the too dangerous parts of the magical creatures in his ensemble. The centaur herd were kept docile through potions, the phoenix’s wings remained constantly clipped, the giant was under strength-limiting spells, and the pack of werewolves including his neighbor were routinely made to wear indestructible gloves and masks even when in human form, amongst other tailored practices for other creatures as were needed. And of course, he himself as the last siren alive wore a collar which told him when he could or couldn’t sing.
Boy sits on the pile of
Unable to keep looking at something he learned to identify with his body without feeling more foreign to himself, Draco stared at Harry instead.
“I know how much…
they had merely been entertaining themselves in that moment. Their behavior hadn’t been intended for that, but it didn’t change what their actions imitated.
Draco would have to make do with the second step of siren courting.
His song sought comfort in the chest pressed against his face, which he clung to greedily.
Watching Harry all the while, Draco curled up and with his head tucked on his own shoulder, making this low rumbling sound. That might sound like a cat’s purr if it weren’t too many decibels lower. But the invitation—or demand—in the noise was clear.
The dragon’s head on his stomach seemed to relax on him further. The weight of his head wasn’t anywhere near life threatening. He was a bit heavy, but not completely uncomfortable.
Were Harry’s standards that his mate had to be human, but it was fine to have a siren for a friend? And now, that he knew Draco wanted him as a mate,
how great it was below the surface. This need to make an electrifying impression on Harry competed with Draco’s simultaneous craving to be as near to Harry’s scent as possible. The latter made it harder to even
The only occasion they could intrude into this colossal collection of wealth was Dragon Appreciation Day. It was officially Draco's time to get all of the ‘dragon greed’ out of his system. And be the most ultra-particular and demanding interior decorator Harry would ever know.
Draco pressed his hand to Harry’s chest and recited Harry’s name in siren, the same melody that he’d sung all night and morning. He watched the understanding rush into Harry’s eyes.
It just hadn’t killed him yet.
After laying on his back on the somewhat uncomfortable ground, Draco slid forward to join him and surreptitiously began sniffing his hair. It just seemed the most sniffable out of the rest of the pieces that made up his would-be mate. Smelling it up close, Draco could smell the cloying fragrance of flowers and spice but not much of Harry’s true scent. The skin by his ear and neck were an improvement, but not much. All the foul-smelling layers of fruity combinations drowned it out Harry’s naturally alluring scent no matter how strongly Draco inhaled.
So he said, but Harry didn’t stop feeding Draco that way for either lunch or dinner.
Suddenly exhausted, he curled onto his sea bed as he tied one of the kelp around his neck, a makeshift weight to pretend he wasn’t here, but back at the Troupe… feeling Luna’s arms around him. And, more strangely—even after only having felt it once—the echo of a man’s touch and too-green eyes that had both upended his life and comforted him for it, resonated with something deep within himself that had no name. This man was also nowhere to be seen, and Draco had the sinking feeling, he wouldn’t find him again either—not even to demand answers, which only fueled his depressed stupor upon waking.
But the matter of how stressed Harry had been couldn’t be ignored. Draco’s

by Hermione addressing him.

Draco didn’t even look up at him.
Harry’s green eyes that captivated Draco the moment he saw them, stared into his own tearful ones. And Draco swallowed, praying that Harry could see in Draco’s eyes what he couldn’t hear in his voice.
had arrived.
He suddenly shouted in frustration, “I CAN’T-”
When she let go of him, his nameless distress became realized at the unwavering
“You have to eat Draco.” His eyes filled with pain that mirrored Draco’s own.
“Hi, Draco,” Harry said, laughing incredulously. “Don’t you usually wait over there?” With both hands holding the pails’ handles, he indicated the water with his chin, but Draco’s eyes remained fixed on him.
This whole thing was a bit like staking a claim, and the surge of confidence that it brought for Draco. Harry could enjoy it for that fact alone. The entire event was worth it if just for that smile.
“Thank you,” she said.
“What is it? What’s wrong?” Harry immediately stood up, concerned. This action moved him further away from Draco, who lamented the distance instantly.
From what little of their conversations he could hear through the thick glass, Draco was frustratingly only able to piece together a few snippets—something about assigning him a keeper, whatever that was.
Engaging in playful chases which border-lined a true siren mating run had been playing with fire. Of course, Draco hadn’t considered the ramifications of it. He’d been too set on competing with Harry and the pleasure of racing with him. And somehow their alternating the roles of “chaser” and “chased”—while siren pairs traditionally stuck to one role—seemed different enough to his mind to not immediately correlate their behaviours with siren couplings.
“The omega?” Draco asks bitterly after picking up the phone again. “Show them a sweet, simpering omega without an alpha –”
“Draco, my God, you’d think our mother was yours. Every time we’ve mentioned her you’re all tense.”
“The runes circle can boost our magic to allow us to do something about being cooped up in here.”
“How did you not realize it was him?” The lawyer is getting angry. The lawyer is an alpha. “How did you not recognize the man who hired you?”
It forces omega magic out through the skin, in basically whatever form that takes. For Draco, it’s a fucking ocean of freezing water bubbling in the air above him and crashing onto Draco’s face like a tidal wave.
Draco tries to look anywhere but at this lawyer. It is the High Inquisitor who speaks. Draco turns his head so fast to meet her eyes that it gives him whiplash. “Mr. Malfoy, you took an oath to tell the story as it happened.”
“What did you do?” Harry Potter is in the same cell as Draco, which means he did something. He did something bad enough to be in a ministry holding cell.
Barnaby’s genius plan to reduce Draco’s sentence is to bring in a doctor who tells the entire courtroom how Draco’s symptoms can only be caused by the lack of a single person in his life who cares for him. His rage, physical strength, and magic are still perfectly intact while his mind goes. This is the opposite of alphas, who maintain their minds but cannot maintain their magic.
“Draco—let’s do it.” Harry goes to grab Draco’s arm and it makes him flinch. Harry doesn’t appear to notice. “Let’s do it. I have a Grimoire—”
Leaning against the tiny Azkaban holding cell, in the blue light of evening, Draco can almost imagine the scene is about to happen for real.
“Draco, magic doesn’t
“What does this have to do with me?”
“Are you capable—” Barnaby reacts violently at his own voice because his sonorous is still active. The echoes of his voice pound through the white room. He puts his wand in his back pocket and looks at Draco again. “Can you be normal now?”
Older Draco looks disappointed. “Which fucking version of us went to the Hallow’s Eve gala?” Draco is so thrown by the change of subject and weird phrasing that he doesn’t think about the answer. “It was you – it wasn’t me.”
The only thing Draco mistrusts more than Azkaban is an Azkaban run by Granger.
“Good. There’s a lot of paperwork involved with that now.” He buttons the jacket on his cloak. “They used to just throw you to the dementors if you wanted! Now you need to jump through hoops.”
Draco hates to speak in code. “He told me to tell Harry Potter – who won’t be here, I’ve read the witness list – that I can travel to other dimensions.”
“It’s not illegal,” Draco mutters, while spluttering water from his lungs. It’s so cold, it numbs him. He doesn’t even really feel lit.
“—actually, that spell would have to be—”
“Before that.”
Draco feels so angry all of a sudden, he can feel himself exploding latent magic all over the room. Seemingly despite himself, Harry smiles, which makes Draco even angrier. “You told me you wanted me to stay in the garden! You told me not to go! Well, now I don’t want to. I’ll stay here forever.”
Draco had been under the impression that all of these people had been raised wizarding. “Couldn’t we just pull our magic?”
“C’mere, Draco, let’s crack on.” Barnaby holds up the magically binding handcuffs as if they are merely an annoying fashion accessory for
Astrid scoffs, “I’m sorry, I forgot, we could just
It’s Barnaby. Draco doesn’t bother to look up or say anything. He falls to the floor and lies supine across the concrete.
He’s blacking out again, surely. It’s like a record skip – they just talked about this –
for alphas. Their love is supposed to be the strongest thing in the magical universe.
In a moment of extreme embarrassment, so much so that he can see his mother flinch in the corner of his eye, Draco lets out a long omegan whine that is meant – biologically – to show extreme distress. In theory, everybody in the area should desire to rush to his rescue. It is a sign of true submission.
Potter stands up and walks over to the bed that Draco’s sitting on, and he knows he’s fucked up. He’d only been trying to make Harry Potter a little crazy, that’s not illegal, and he quickly tries to rein in the magic he’s been letting fill all over the room.
Lucius looks uncomfortable. “When I first got here there were…people from the Department of Mysteries. They were studying – us.”
When he comes to, he’s in a field. It reminds him of the section of the Manor that his mother always tended, back before the war. The path that he’s walking leads down a hill, into smaller areas that are blocked off my moss. The lavender is out, so it must be early summer, despite the high sun.
After several minutes in the boat without Granger saying a single word, Draco starts picking at the magic handcuffs until he shocks himself.
“Not quite,” somebody says, leaning against the door. Draco jumps nearly through the ceiling at Lucius.
Younger Draco is wearing a genuine leather robe with a high collar that makes him look like Dracula. The inseam is too tight, leaving him to constantly adjust it so that his pants lay crooked as he walks. The combination of all three Draco’s embarrassment is palpable.
Draco jumps down from the top bunk into the water with a loud splash, grabbing Blaise’s collar, holding him down as the water rises. “Is the bite worth it now?” He asks quickly. Even to his own ears, he sounds absolutely batshit.  “It’s only going to protect you from alphas.”
“No.” Older Draco is beside him again, while current Draco still plays this role. “You really don’t remember?”
“I can’t do anything!” Draco says, hoarsely, posh accent forgotten.
“Malfoy,” he turns and sees...Harry Potter? “What did you do to end up here?”
Draco feels sick. It feels like he’s eaten a lot of candy or smelled something putrid.
“Tell me what you’re here for.” This is the most enticing thing to happen to Draco in ages.
Narcissa and Barnaby are arguing about something while Draco slumps into a chair he doesn’t recognize. “Rose garden...” he mumbles trying to place where he even is in the Manor. Granger puts her hand on his shoulder and deeply shocks him, to the point where Draco doesn’t really recall who she is.
Draco has a semblance of control when it’s this light. He hates seeing Barnaby standing with his wand out, wearing that fucking formal robe ensemble and smirking, watching Draco stand in the rain.
Draco’s magic is not as forgiving nor as beautiful as muggle gasoline. Potter’s anger detonates in a split second, consuming the cell with blue fire.
That is what omegas are. They are partners and servants to communities. Rare and holding limitless opportunity for power, an omega is an alpha’s true strength.
Draco is still spread-eagle across the floor. “Is this normal?”
“Oh yeah?” Draco yells. He pulls down the side of his collar. “This is a noticeable difference.”
Draco contemplates his answer. “Both.”
After that, the boat ride is so charged with hatred between the three of them that it would be difficult to navigate the sea with calm waters.
is something hilarious.
Draco nods, learning into Potter’s hands. “You’re a dream.”
cell, is making Draco’s whole personality seem very tiresome.
Two motherfucking months. Merlin. To Draco, it’s felt like two weeks.
It feels like decades before he can gather himself, wipe his eyes to notice that he’s positioned in an all-white room, crouched over his own knees, holding himself in a squatted fetal position. He’s soaking wet.
What story. Draco tries to wrack his brain for what’s even happening. He asked Potter questions about why he was here. He filled the room with magic, which theoretically should make Potter want to spill his guts. He was sitting on the bed crisscross applesauce.
In Draco’s inexpert opinion, that seems slightly unnecessary. Runes circles are used to boost magic and Draco imagines that this room has excess magic in spades. Additionally, runes circles need the sound of a metal gong to begin.
Just when he settles down to try and sleep, another prisoner barges into the room with a huge cacophony of sounds. The guard is asking if he can do anything to make this new prisoner more comfortable, which makes Draco want to scream again.
“I’ve seen you go to this place.”
It is unclear why Narcissa came, as she does not make any effort to speak to Draco beyond asking if he may bleed out. When Draco had first presented, his mother had been easy with her affection. It had been simple to transfer the constant magic that flooded his body to her. Recently, Narcissa forces herself into withdrawal by refusing to touch either her son or her husband. Draco has stopped trying to understand it. He doubts she has enough control of her magic, without an omega in her life, to do simple tasks.
The part of this interaction that kills Draco the most, even to this day, is what happened afterwards. The man grabbed that omega woman by the waist after she had said goodbye to the stranger on the street and, laughing at the abruptness, she leaned in to kiss him right in the center of London. He whispered something to her, and they walked off, never having stopped touching the whole time.
” He leans back on his feet, which should be impossible at his weight. “I thought I’d killed you.”
Granger stops rowing and simply regards him for a while. She seems to decide something, looks resolute, and then takes the oar in her hand and cracks it over Draco’s head in one strike.
When they lock eyes for the first time, something gives in his expression. He allows Draco to crawl into his arms, and even though he’s in immense pain, Draco welcomes the alpha’s embrace against his back.
“Oh, think about it,” Draco insisted, “when’s the last time you think he got some? He needs some serious stress relief, and what better way than--”
“What are you doing here?” He asked, sounding somewhat panicked.
The locker room was hazy as the last of the boys cleared out of it. The only thing keeping it somewhat clear was the opening and closing of the door as the boys left. Harry was the last one there, still getting dressed after his shower. At least he thought he was.
“I-I can, I promise,” Draco sounded desperate and Harry was absolutely thriving on that.
It was an hour. It was only an hour, and Draco could handle that.
“Kinky bastard,” Draco muttered under his breath as he slumped back on the bed, exhausted.
Harry was moving his hands then, running them up and down Draco’s tense thighs and brushing over his clothed crotch. Malfoy heard the way Harry tsked as he did this.
“Get used to it?” Draco asked.
It was early; much too early for this. Harry was already pissed off with Draco and it was only eleven in the morning. Classes started at eight-thirty, right after breakfast, so it took all of two and a half hours for the prestigious blonde to tick Harry off. Of course, that meant he was also ticking Ron off, Ron just wasn’t aware of that at the moment.
Ron was right. If it was just the two of them, Draco could definitely blow him off.
Oh, that’s right, he wanted Harry.
“How could we not keep him?”
“Thank you… for spanking me.” Draco was blushing again. Oh, how he hated Potter.
“And?”
Draco watches as Harry pours two cups of tea, adding a spoonful of sugar as he likes before sliding it over the countertop towards him, “you still drink tea when you’re upset,” Draco notes, watching the way Harry practically downs the tea like a shot of whiskey.
Harry had been partnered with the last person he would have picked to be partnered with; Draco Malfoy. Oh, how he could hate potions at that moment. Nevertheless, he moved seats to sit beside the Slytherin and get started.
Draco released his nipple, licking over both of them to soothe them then pulling away and letting Ron have his own fun.
Harry didn’t startle near as much as the last time Draco had seen him like this. In fact, he didn’t startle much at all, as if he was expecting someone. Maybe he was.
So, Draco had to be Draco and point it out. After getting on his nerves long enough (and threatened that he and the other Slytherins would gather around a fire at night and chant out Ronald Weasley, Ronald Weasley…) he got it out of him. Turns out Ron had never been with another guy and was curious. He was going to ask Harry for help, as Harry was the only one he trusted, but then Draco came along.
This made Draco smirk, and Harry didn’t like it one bit, “They get to punish the loser however they see fit.”
Harry decided the best way to do this would be quick and hopefully easy. He was light on his feet as he moved to get on the bed and straddle the back of Draco’s legs. He then leaned forward slightly to grasp both of Draco’s hands in his own. As he pinned Draco to the bed, Draco awoke with a start, a grunt escaping him before the panic set in and he began to thrash around.
He let his head fall back as he rode Draco, a warm hand running over the marks Draco had made on him and soothing kisses being pressed to them from behind. Harry could tell that Draco was close, could feel the way he tried to push his hips up into Harry but wasn’t able to do it for long.
What? He is Harry Potter’s best friend, after all.
Draco quirked an eyebrow at that, taking a step forward and effectively pinning the smaller man to the stone wall behind him. Harry noticeably shrank, not expecting this at all. Draco's smirk grew as he noticed.
Harry said nothing, raising his eyebrows instead in a silent agreement of the statement. He took a minute to eye what Draco was wearing (black pants, tailored to perfection of course, and a black button-up. His expensive boots clicked on his way through the doors, Harry noted right away) before stepping forward and letting his wand slide out of his own sleeve.
Ron slumped at the dinner table, not touching his dinner as he sulkily watched his best friend jump up from the table and scurry out of the dining hall. It had been three days in a row that Harry had done this, along with barely talking to Hermione or himself, and it was worrying Ron immensely.
Harry gave what sounded like a broken whine at that, piquing Draco’s interest even further.
“P-Potter, I’m serious, st-stop, I-” He was cut off as a wide stripe was licked over him, a gasp leaving him as Harry began to eat him out.
The two boys hardly listened as Madam Pomfrey scolded them. Draco was vaguely aware that she was more-so ranting about having more important things to tend to on a Friday afternoon at three in the afternoon. Draco was also aware of the half considerate, half suspicious look she gave him when he suggested that she go ahead and take care of her “important matters.”
The other man smirked, “say it.”
“What?” Draco asked, his joggers getting noticeably tighter as he fought to not freak out when Harry leaned in towards his ear.
The other male just stared at him, leaning back against a desk and waiting for Ron to speak. This unsettled Ron somewhat, never knowing the man in front of him to leave any talking room.
“So responsive,” Harry mumbled, “just like I thought.”
Harry crossed his arms, "You called me Harry earlier."
As Draco laid on the other side of Harry, he draped his arm over him. On the other side, his hand brushed against Ron’s, and rather than pulling away, he laced their fingers together.
“I got a kick out of it,” Draco responded, tugging his bottom lip between his teeth as Blaise gave him a puppy-dog look.
“Well,” Draco started, recalling the conversation, “at first I mentioned another round, but here’s the kicker; with the way he responded to it, I got a bit carried away and brought you into it.”
“My name. You can’t even call me by my name, can you?”
Harry looked elsewhere to distract himself from his own embarrassment while they transitioned to discussing business. As usual, his focus ended up resting on a certain familiar golden-colored vial.
Lately, Draco was, more and more, preoccupied with wanting those hands to be put on him. And not even in a particular fashion, as long as they
“You’re at a Rehabilitation Center for Aquatic Magical Creatures which you will stay at temporarily before your release,” Harry elaborated. “Here, we want to make sure to get you back to the wild—once assured you’re
Draco stopped singing, even as all his instincts screamed against it: to suffocate his mate in their need to have him. He ignored the desperate compulsion to be as provocative to his mate as possible to get what he wanted from them, to let his mate
Nobody.
Its’ eyes—the color of molten silver—roamed over its surroundings, settling on Harry but head unmoving from its position. The polished scales shined more brilliantly than the pile of precious stones and wealth they sat on. And easily were worth a hundred times as much. Harry knew their smooth texture well, but he would wait before he could touch quite yet.
“You’ll be in control of your own life again.”
Even though it had been long since their first jumble of mouths, there was an anticipation any time they would go in for it. Harry didn’t mind. It just made the times they did it more precious.
Harry’s hand rested idly in his pocket, fiddling inside his moleskin pouch. Where real solid gold galleons weighed heavy.
“I must say! That’s quite the becoming look,” she said, startling Harry. “It’s so nice to see more men enjoying jewelry for themselves these days.”
as it compelled him to draw himself closer and closer to Harry.
He let the seemingly sharp object—magicked to be smooth, flexible and softer than the metal —invade his body, to the shocked and scandalized gasps of the crowd. Their reaction mattered little. Because once again, for all their misgivings and appreciation for the supposed social niceties and decorum of magical wizarding society,

He did not return.
at the same time, nerves both raw and numbed into a nonsensical jumble.
or not in such a way as it meant to sirens.
But somehow that action attracted the stray audience member’s attention. The dark fringe of hair was no longer angled to hide his gaze as he lifted it. And now, finally meeting them, Draco could see the color of his eyes even from so far away-
A telling look from Harry had Slughorn’s shoulders falling, chastened and defeated. But Luna wasn’t one to let anyone go feeling miserable, even the undeserving.
Her eyebrows furrowed a bit disappointedly. “How can Draco be released now?”
But this wasn’t the sea.
Letting himself sink back into the incredibly warm and comfortable water, he reviewed the events of what led him here. He’d finally revealed the physical consequences of his interest in his mate, but the other had reacted like Draco was experiencing a sickness. Harry treated Draco less like a mate in desperate need of reciprocation and more like a
Draco stifled a snort next to him, which wasn’t much better than the witch’s well-fought for but cracking politely-neutral expression.
It was the same question Harry asked each time. And he’d still ask it every other time since, whether because he needed reminding or he was waiting for a different answer.
For a long moment, Draco stared after him.
______________
When his own hand was no longer doing the job, it had been the same whim that made him silently ask for Harry to put his hand on the back of his neck. Harry’s cooperation with this request was something Draco thanked him for, as much as he could without words. It was this kind of relief from worry Draco kept chasing, and Harry was the generous balm to erase his worries, if only temporarily. Draco was able to hold himself together just for those three visits a day.
Seeing Harry in the water for the first time, briefly made Draco forget all his intentions to court him. His hair made a lovely inky halo that finally synchronized in the way they moved around his head. His green eyes seemed to shine even brighter underwater, or perhaps it was the lack of barrier from his absent glasses that was tricking Draco’s own eyes. And his scar was more visible with his hair constantly floating up. The way he swam upward to get a breath of fresh air was surprisingly graceful, something he’d never thought he’d say about human’s unnecessarily complicated way of swimming.
And actually, why not? He had plenty of it. Right here.
.” The dragon’s eyes closed a little, which Harry took as a happy sign. Draco’s reactions to him as a dragon were a weird mix of intimidating and adorable.
Draco did look at him then, with a glare filled with so much spite that only astonished Slughorn further.
He did this for another day or two.
evaporated.
Even though it shouldn’t matter that Harry had only repeated himself from earlier with the addition of touching him and smiling, the last of Draco’s shame died with their combined reassurance anyway.
