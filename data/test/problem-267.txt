He also wasn't a dragon animagus, which might have helped him wrap his head around the extent of Draco’s obsession for collecting shiny and pricey things.
Its’ eyes—the color of molten silver—roamed over its surroundings, settling on Harry but head unmoving from its position. The polished scales shined more brilliantly than the pile of precious stones and wealth they sat on. And easily were worth a hundred times as much. Harry knew their smooth texture well, but he would wait before he could touch quite yet.
At times like these, sitting across from Harry, he desperately wished he could ask the other what he knew of Luna’s fate.
What about it had, aside from his pride? It would have been expected of any other creature. Slughorn had merely requested it from Draco because he was, in Slughorn’s words, the star attraction who was ‘simply stunning’—
Taking his cue, Harry laid with him. Draco’s snout carefully positioned itself directly on his belly, snuffling a bit, angled in such a way one of his eyes was staring at Harry’s. Harry stroked his scales, enjoying the texture under his fingers and the rhythmic waves of warm air fanning his face.
After devouring the first fish, he did the same with the others, ignoring any Harry wasn’t directly holding and only eating what Harry gave him. For the second hand-fed fish, as soon as Harry would try to let go of it, Draco would stop eating, disrupting all Harry’s attempts to make him eat by himself until Harry gave in.
Memories of being out in the ocean, alone and with nobody to call his own… Sleeping on an empty stomach in that cold and silence that went on and on and on. He already knew what real freedom was:
But it was clearly something Draco was keen on doing more often, once most of his inhibitions were out of the way.
It wasn’t that hard to admit in that moment, being completely honest with himself, that Draco liked Harry. And that Harry probably liked Draco too. Though Luna could never be replaced, maybe even with her absence, Draco didn’t have to be alone after all.
“What they do or don’t, or, what they should or shouldn’t do according to their species, isn’t up to you! That’s the point, Horace!” Harry loomed over a startled Slughorn, the same time an impressive wave of magic rose to bear down on all present, wondrous and terrifying. The danger it posed strangely grounded Draco’s otherwise rapidly whirlpooling thoughts, even more than Luna’s hand which found his and held it tightly.
Draco couldn’t go completely back to normal until he was mated. Why was that so hard to understand? But telling that to these humans proved an impossible task.
The hand pulled back and with it, a very familiar silver inlaid collar glinted without a neck inside it, its polished surface reflecting Draco’s own eyes that it had been created to match.
It was the same question Harry asked each time. And he’d still ask it every other time since, whether because he needed reminding or he was waiting for a different answer.
Because there was no other word for it. Draco had experienced the wonders of Harry giving him physical affection and wasn’t about to give him any reason to stop. Maintaining any of his typically indifferent disposition—which hadn’t been useful to impress Harry anyway—was no longer worth it. Having Harry’s hands stroking his tail—a reward that was actually tangible and more satisfying than stroking his own ego—was priceless.
But he had no human voice to utter it, and Harry had no siren ears. So Draco smiled at him, as warmly as he did mutely, instead.
When he woke up, fully for once, he was surprised to see a familiar face he’d thrown fish at sitting next to him. It was the same red-haired man who had first meant to be Draco’s keeper and the start of a series of repeated rejections until Harry.
While the dragon listened to him with unerring focus, Harry lavished the dragon with sincere, softly murmured praises.
Harry noticed this, and after taking a needed gulp of air, made his way towards him, probably wondering at Draco’s sudden pause in participating. But even if Draco could verbally explain, he didn’t think he would. He felt over-sensitive and not sensitive
Engaging in playful chases which border-lined a true siren mating run had been playing with fire. Of course, Draco hadn’t considered the ramifications of it. He’d been too set on competing with Harry and the pleasure of racing with him. And somehow their alternating the roles of “chaser” and “chased”—while siren pairs traditionally stuck to one role—seemed different enough to his mind to not immediately correlate their behaviours with siren couplings.
This was something only Draco owned, not managed by goblins. It was a wonder Malfoy bothered with having a Gringotts vault at all.
It was still surprising how so many people were willing to participate in something they’d never get to see. Dragons were an important symbol to wizards, yes. But not something he’d ever thought they would pay tribute to, or make an entire holiday dedicated to doing just that.
The green eyes were almost desperate now, or it was himself projecting. Draco couldn’t even think clearly, while something so beautiful and obviously wanting had dared to have kept their eyes from him, to pretend to be unworthy of witnessing his song?
“Well, I’ve got to give it to you. First time in a while I’ve gotten startled by a creature like that.” His muscled arms spread themselves to stretch behind his neck. “Gave my heart a fright, you did. And a good story too.” He leaned forward, whispering a bit conspiratorially. “Surviving a siren’s fish attack is practically a medal of honor around here, you know?”
His fourth tank, the show stage, and his last area he would be able to check. He found no one there either. Luna was gone. There were no more familiar faces in the audience, only red robes in the pews, taking measurements and levitating and packing things that didn’t belong to them. The trident stood tall in the face of everything but offered Draco no more real refuge than it ever had. It and his song on this stage never once saved him. And the crystal-clear water, designed to make him as visible as possible, didn’t start to hide him from the uninvited audience now. Even more Red Robes congregated and pointed their sticks at him. Draco swam away while he could.
would be a troublesome one.” Rather than a warmer greeting Draco somehow expected given their last emotional exchange—albeit on Draco’s end—Draco was met with a stern, matter of fact expression and neutral, green eyes.
“You won’t need me, Draco.” Draco didn’t want that sort of guarantee if it meant she wouldn’t be there.
Draco raised his face to look at him and must have worn quite the expression, because the other relented and pulled Draco back against his chest.
“I wish to have left on better terms with you, Draco,” Slughorn said to his half-submerged head. “Know that I will always hold a high opinion of you.” It was almost enough to make Draco acknowledge him, if only because of Slughorn confirming he realized for the first time that Draco could and had understood
The Master, Slughorn, was not an altogether awful man, aside from treating them like collectibles, he regarded and cared for his collection well. He valued them in his own way and wished for them a positive experience while in his management, even taking requests from those that could speak as rewards for good behavior and being mindful of their physical health. As for the bad apples, he carefully screened such individuals to never even be accepted and interrupt the peace he’d so far scrupulously cultivated, since the incident with a certain “You-know-who”, something before Draco’s time there that the oldest members of their troop refused to speak about. But still, there was no masking their status of unwanted captivity, no matter how much the Master fed and praised them for their hard work.
Harry and a stranger, a woman with long bushy hair wearing one of those white uniforms, came into the room, speaking animatedly to each other.
Draco felt his insides freeze over. For a moment he wished he’d misheard. Or that he could stop understanding Slughorn as the man, who he’d known to only give him compliments and endless accolades for the past seven years, continued on unflatteringly about his mating habits like he’d been talking facts about the weather.
But the last of Draco’s hopes were cruelly dashed by Charlie once again being where Harry should be to give him his morning meal the next day. Draco didn’t even bother looking at him as soon as he recognized who it was, and who it
Fussing with Harry’s robes with his last precious seconds, Draco preened over him a bit in a way that reminded Harry of how parents might prep their child for an outing. A comparison Harry tried not to think too much about.
Draco snickered at Harry’s slightly put upon expression. His laugh jarred Harry’s other hand (not feeding him bites of fish) that rested against his back, which gave him a brief squeeze.
Still, since those interactions, no keepers or cleaners would even come near him now. The humans in white coats that once stood in front of his tank’s glass wall were strangely absent as well, as if Draco’s aggression to the ones that fed him had made them vanish also. Though he thought he saw a few sneakily leaving the window to his tank when he woke up after a nap once.
Only this day out of the whole year, Draco used to channel his animagus form, which mostly entailed having Harry’s company and hoarding. There was no other suitable word for the latter—amassing a bunch of things he’d never use and storing it away to never see the light of day again. It wasn’t unlike a Gringotts’ vault in that respect. Treasures from previous years overflowed shelves in the grey rock face and were joined by Draco’s newest acquisitions that he strategically piled into a mound in the middle. Polished walls of the cave reflected the lights of the many flickering gold-flamed torches, creating shimmers across the ground and making objects that could glitter sparkle.
But there was one other difference, this time, he could voice his grief. Draco could say goodbye to Harry.
“It’s rut, your rut has been triggered. Shit,” Harry seemed frantic and confused, rather than happy like Draco had hoped. Draco was puzzled by this. Shouldn’t Harry as his mate be more interested or happy for Draco to so obviously want him.
“You’re a strange one,” Harry finally murmured, but his hand finally stayed still for Draco to finish.
Harry turned back to Slughorn who winced, preferring being forgotten. “I’m not going to arrest you,” Harry said to Slughorn’s blinking eyes. “But I am referring you to a program for addiction. You need to get a hold of your urges to collect living things… or delve in herbology raising
Draco eventually flew to his side, finally stepping off the broom. “Is that everything from the gift registry?”
From his lenient pose, the man sitting on the chair next to him and reading a book didn’t seem to hold any grudges for the thrown fish. If anything, when he saw Draco was up, he smiled warmly, just as he had the first day Draco met him. Draco almost believed he’d confused him with someone else—there were many people at the center with red hair—until he spoke.
Draco passed the time in Charlie’s company listening to the man talk about everything from the weather to his many brothers and one sister—and how Draco ought to meet them--until the other’s shift watching him was over, and Draco was left alone but happy at their interaction ending without any hostility.
Already platinum blonde, Draco had little use for golden hair dye. He’d set it back and never looked at it twice since. It was potions of actual high value or rarity, whatever the color, that Draco held a larger interest. Much like
Too soon, his collar vibrated and Draco’s voice cut off, slamming into the time limit and sudden muted silence. He floated there frustrated and hot, song not even half-sung, not finished in time to transition into the end like his usual routine. And he never reached the last centimeter of release as his tired body slid off the prong.
“Let’s ditch everything we think we know about sirens and ruts, just think for ourselves for a change. And let’s go with Otter’s trigger theory for a second,” Charlie said.
Draco frowned. What had Harry thought when seeing him aching for him then? Draco’s response had been one for his mate, but Harry’s… hadn’t. For the first time, Draco thought Harry might not find him mate worthy after all.
As he shifted himself up and down the prong, he couldn’t look away from that one fool in the audience that wouldn’t look back at him. Perhaps he was a prude, and couldn’t bear to watch? It was maddening to remember; humans were the ones in control and he wasn’t, even here where he was a beacon that blinded them with lust. To even consider that this one will escape, not knowing his power, and thinking he could remain untouched from Draco’s grasp? In his frustration, he thrusts into himself a little too enthusiastically and makes an aborted, unplanned sound of pain which the collar quickly silences the end of.
Harry bit his lip but stopped arguing. His lips looked like they’d been bitten a lot lately, Draco noted distantly. His mate’s presence was more magnetic than he remembered, and he felt a prickle of heat at the back of his neck which the water around him immediately cooled.
“Draco,” his voice was strained, and he fervently pressed himself against Draco, and held him so close, and Draco felt the beginnings of the heatwave returning, more dangerous he knew with his lack of nutrition. But he didn’t care, not while Harry finally
A beat later, he was certain there was better phrasing he could’ve used. Not calling it ‘lots’ for starters.
And then he saw Harry, but not where he was supposed to be, but on the other side of the glass of his tank, where the people in white uniform liked to observe him from. He was alone.
Outside the cave, there wouldn’t be another opportunity to show Draco, since all gifted objects had to remain behind after his dragon claimed it for his horde. Draco liked the earrings and that was good enough.
Draco didn’t bother correcting her that he couldn’t say fish or anything at all, which meant it could go on forever. But this life was what he’d known for seven years now, and would probably for another seven more, so maybe she was right
Harry only had to look back at Draco to see it—to feel it too: the urge to throw the both of them back in, to be locked away themselves. Like Draco didn't want Harry to leave. Like he didn’t want to leave either.
Luna started to weave the pumpkins out of her flowing yellow curls, pausing between several to help him take off his charmed jewelry. The collar of course always remained after the others were lifted. Unlike his adornments, the pumpkins were her own selection.
After an hour or so longer keeping each other close, Harry made to move away but Draco wouldn’t let him.
But Harry had little time to appreciate Malfoy getting dressed before they were up and moving again. Though, considerably more relaxed than before. The entire process of collecting all of Draco’s loot for the dragon to immerse himself in reversed itself. And Draco and Harry now had to put everything back to lock it all away.
about his time spent with Harry involving greater physical contact. Harry seemed slightly startled by Draco’s new attitude and excessive preoccupation with having as much of himself in contact with Harry as possible.
He sang his grief and longing until they had turned into the same melody. And eventually, the song merely became Harry’s name in siren tongue, said over and over, the sweetest melody that Draco could sing to himself to pass his remaining days. A song of
Draco stopped singing, even as all his instincts screamed against it: to suffocate his mate in their need to have him. He ignored the desperate compulsion to be as provocative to his mate as possible to get what he wanted from them, to let his mate
dangers to their lives are!” Slughorn said with so much passion, only to seem to recall who exactly he was talking to and caught his breath.
Draco was hellbent on capturing that effect to its fullest. Throughout the entire span of the cave, he fretted about without stopping. Copious amounts of levitation magic spread thick in the room, objects floating to the bottom or top of piles. Draco himself flew in every direction possible on his broom, redoing and undoing his progress while Harry watched on, amused.
, the collar and its removal, made everything seem to stop for him all over again. And then he wanted nothing to do with anything.
“You’re probably wondering why you’re here. I’m sorry that wasn’t communicated to you. Most people don’t know you can understand.” Something in his voice betrayed some remembered irritation; Draco was more surprised to be given an apology at all, though not for what Draco wanted.
“We’ll see each other again someday. Not in this world.” She smiled again, only this time brighter. “But when a Rowling pens a red rock.”
. To think he’d prefer it remained that way—that today could have been like any other before it. Now, it was the place he’d see both the closest thing he had to
A long silence ensued between the seething man and the cowed one, as the dense cloud of oppressive magic lingered, flooding the vacuum of unspoken words and poised itself to react with violence. Draco could even feel it enter his lungs as he breathed in. And some of it remained burrowed in his throat as he exhaled, a thread of it winding itself deeper toward his own muffled magic’s center. His inner song stirred in response.
Draco’s hands had started twitching without his notice. For a moment, he was certain he was in a dream gone wrong, recalling all the different creatures he’d known for so long disappear before his very eyes past his different tanks and tunnels, as more and more red robes came to take them. And Draco still didn’t know where he was going.
Draco used his voice to make it sound like he was behind him when he was actually hiding behind a bit of coral, startling Harry when he tackled him, but he immediately let go of him again to start fleeing Harry himself. This was what it must have felt like to be a snitch chased by Harry, exhilarating.
He swallowed down another bite of fish and the odd sense of uncertainty. Before he could gesture for her to explain, the sound of Slughorn’s voice returned, this time accompanied by another pair of lighter steps.
intended to be a permanent place for him. Draco should be grateful for this, but it was quickly overshadowed by fears of being sent back to the sea. These humans that thought they were doing what was best for him—just like Slughorn—had no way of knowing just how badly he wished not to go back there. There was no doubt in Draco’s mind they would not let him stay here to live amongst them in the human world, no matter how much he fought and shouted.
It hadn’t been more than three seconds before the man had abruptly turned away from Draco to return to conversing with Slughorn. Draco frowned, greatly insulted. No well-earned look of awe and not even a
“I want to control myself,” He felt Harry’s tears against his neck, even as Harry pressed against him, his heat and groin pressed to Draco, unmistakable in Harry’s own need to take him. His voice was so immeasurably sad and
But the simplest answer was also often the most disappointing. Draco wished he’d been telling the truth.
It was guarded as much as Draco’s animagus ability from public knowledge. Maintaining secrecy was necessary. For all that a dragon animagus would make any witch or wizard a celebrity, an ex-death eater capable of assuming the form of a fire-breathing dragon did not paint a reassuring picture to many.
Draco nodded, but Harry still checked up on him. He looked Draco over for signs of distress or injury, while Draco calmly waited for him to finish, enjoying the attention for what it was while it lasted. Finding nothing, obviously, he turned back around, likely to resume their business with the fish.
He wondered how long he could keep it up. In the ocean, he’d gone for quite a while on very little. It must have been nearly four days already with Draco not eating. This morning he decided to lay at the edge of the pool outside it to sunbathe—considering what it was like to be a plant who only needed sun and water; there’d be no way to lob sunshine at him crassly for one—when he saw a familiar face.
On bad days, the kelp around his neck could only do so much to give him the illusion of calm. It had been steadily losing its effectiveness now that his freed voice seemed intent on vocalizing random noises whenever he had a casual spike in emotion.
For the rest of his stay in that room while he recovered, Draco stopped seeing Harry after that. And Draco’s heatwave did not return after a week. He was let out with a clean bill  of health and transported back to his usual tank.
But it was clear that was too oversimplified. And to Draco, the cave meant much more than any wizarding bank’s vault could.
him. He felt another poke of heat at his lungs, and bit back the sound of pain that wanted to escape.
And soon they were humming each other’s names in perfect harmony as they sank back together in oblivion, spent and content. Draco’s song lulled, but did not fall silent.
The sight made Draco freeze in surprise despite himself, but only for a moment as he recovered quickly, hiding his stumble behind a confident smile as he rode himself on the prong more roughly than usual, for the entertainment of all those present.
The effects of the potion he drank before the show slowly pulsed deeper and deeper within him, with every swimming stroke and flip of his body, as he chased his own tail around the trident set in the center of the stage. The audience didn’t know its significance yet, but they would soon.
Draco had lived as a captive in this magical creature zoo for years, the star of the show, reserved for the highest paying clientele. Repeating tricks and dances that showed off his sexual appeal hardly affected him, other than the monotony of flipping and singing on command with little reward.
Keeping his face relaxed, Draco lowered himself fully upon the middle prong, making them watch inch by inch as it disappeared into his body, creating a picture of a fish speared perversely on a fork. It was fitting since many of them would eat him if they could. His master, preferring more lasting sources of income than a one-time meal ticket, blessedly held no such interests.
By the time most of the fish were gone, his face lingered above the man’s hands, going slower and slower by the end of it. The need to prolong contact and nearness with someone after being without for so long had him stretching his usual pace. If Harry mistook it for Draco eating slower as he got fuller… well, Draco wasn’t going to correct him.
For Draco, being off stage doing whatever he wanted within his confines wasn’t freedom. The only time he and others got to be truly free was when they were put on display for witches and wizards to see and gawk at in all their unclothed and unchained glory. And even then, it was the equivalent of being let loose in a bigger cage. No less controlled.
“I don’t mind it,” he said again, with the sort of affectionate, wider smile—than the smaller ones Draco had been familiar with directed to him at this point—that had Draco’s thoughts grinding to a halt.
The smile that was aimed at him was genuine, the same singularity he’d seen once before and yet different from the one that had answered Luna’s thanks for their freedom
“You’re awfully happy today,” Harry noted as he sat in the unfolded seat. If only Harry knew for what a glorious reason that was.
Resigned, Harry returned to his spot, thankful for the Calming Draught he had taken that morning for that exact reason. One bundle of dragon nerves was enough.
They stopped approaching him directly when they had enough of his evasive maneuvers. Soon magical spells were being flung at him, but the spells meant to be cast in air, were slower in water where Draco was faster. Still, they managed to cut off two tunnels to the other tanks, and no doubt had done so with all the others. The sheer volume of spells would catch up to him eventually, and he would be caught.
“Don’t get too used to it,” Harry said, gruffly, slinging the empty buckets over his broad shoulders.
But Draco had already turned away, re-absorbed in studying the list. The quill scrawled off another check-mark on Draco’s Gift Registry, wherever
Then he turned away, swimming to the center and bottom of his tank, and sat there, staring off into nothing.
But Draco couldn’t find himself genuinely regretting it, too happy with having enthralled those stubborn green eyes. Everything else felt dangerously inconsequential besides it and his hungry stomach as he made his swim through his tunnel to his ‘home.’
It was irrational, he knew. And felt somewhat misplaced to miss someone who was still there while still having a friend with unknown whereabouts. But it didn’t stop him from panicking anytime Harry was delayed in his visits to Draco nor his endeavors in making Harry stay as long as possible. Harry had yet to complain.
Abusive? Draco had thought of it as confining if anything else, but he’d still been offered to reject it. And
.” The dragon’s eyes closed a little, which Harry took as a happy sign. Draco’s reactions to him as a dragon were a weird mix of intimidating and adorable.
Slughorn, who had provided him considerably more than this, had wrongly thought of Draco as sexually promiscuous. What must this set of humans think of him then, who didn’t even bother to so much as talk to him?
“You were on fire today. Did someone special in the crowd ignite it?” she asked. He stared back into her half-fae eyes which both looked at and right through him; she was the one person he didn’t mind not giving their full mental attention while addressing him.
“It doesn’t change that they’re here against their will, Horace. It is in violation of the Magical Creatures Protection Act.” His eyes narrowed on Slughorn, sounding almost disappointed. “You know better.”
As Harry stared at Draco, there was no happy revelation on his face. There was no joy or at least, the flattered reception that Draco had expected.
When he peeked back above the water a few seconds later, rather than revulsion, he found the other laughing uncontrollably, as he called for Draco between gasps.
Harry didn’t breathe for a moment, and then the next he was red-faced and apologizing a mile a minute, looking incredibly alarmed. Of what, Draco couldn’t fathom.
He held onto the thought that he was luckier than most, certainly more than the other sirens that no longer existed. Even counting his blessings, receiving his choice meal and so called ‘treats’ over and over again felt less like the reward that Slughorn meant it to be, and more a necessary chore to satiate his terrible hunger after wasting so much magic and energy into his endlessly requested songs.
Turning toward Harry, Draco pressed his face into the warm shirt and grounded himself, while grief overtook him. Actually stopping and allowing himself to feel everything he missed and would be missing: strange stories of beings that couldn’t exist—Bartlyles, Poltickeries, Hefelumps and Woozles; her predictions—from the most mundane to the most life-shattering which she would say in the same airy voice as anything else; her kind smiles and her even kinder eyes; the bloody plants she’d never stop sticking in her hair no matter how much they grew on her…
Draco wasn’t embarrassed, exactly. But if he didn’t know any better, this man had a better sense of courting behavior than his Harry did, though Draco didn’t mind.
He felt the tell tale clutching within his groin, his body reacting to the arousal and accepted it within his swimming. As he danced, his member slowly unsheathed itself, unfurling into the open water for all to watch. Draco kept his front facing them, ignoring the change in his body as if it was part of the dance. Because it was.
abusive, no matter if he agreed to it. Given the power dynamics involved, you’ve no excuse for that.”
He dove deep and planned to travel through his tunnels to his various tanks, five in total—Slughorn’s gift that had allowed him to roam the building with relative ease despite his need for water for locomotion—trying to spot her. But he always missed her somehow. While scanning every which way for unmistakable long and pale hair, the red robes and hoods seemed to be everywhere, in front of every creature and holding place in the whole facility. But nowhere was Luna among them.
Forgoing the human interpretation of the sound of his name that Luna had given him, in that moment Draco told his mate his real name.
Rather than calming him, Green-eye’s patient expression had the effect of unravelling the Slug Club owner further. Slughorn shook his head, spouting apologies.
Realizing that his own voice working normally scared him almost broke him. The everyday sounds within himself that he’d been so used to being silenced were now much too loud and abrupt for his ears. It pained him how unnatural his own day to day voice had become to him. The too light weight of the kelp band that poorly substituted his old silver collar only worsened the sensation of wrongness. Draco had developed a habit of touching his own neck periodically and not relaxing until he’d circled it with his hand.
"I didn’t mean it," Harry muttered when the library door reappeared as quickly and silently as it had gone.
Only, Harry nods, sighing heavily. “Yes, I trust you,” he mumbles, rolling his eyes, and then points at Draco’s books. “Where did those come from?”
"Mum says, if a man won't give you a ring after three years, he'll never do it." Another kid told him solemnly. He caught Pansy's eye, and she had one hand over her mouth to stifle her laughter.
The house was almost done, and even Harry knew this. Draco was hanging around more for him than the house. Neville came by and finished off the garden for nothing more than a cutting of some of the rarer plants and a promise he could come by any time. Still, the garden was the least of Harry's worries. With every brightened hallway, it felt like time was running out and only a firm grip on reality—Draco had not expressed any interest in seeing him past the completion of his work—prevented the house from going haywire and locking Draco there. At least, that’s what Harry thought. He was too embarrassed to ask.
"We could have done one-on-one, Keeper and Chaser," Draco said as if he was accusing him of crimes against humanity.
The name seems to escape Harry’s lips so easily he doesn’t even notice it. Not until Draco’s blushing furiously. His eyes widen a bit as he watches Draco rushing out of the room before he can fall to tears in front of Harry.
The next day he returned, Draco wore a collared shirt embroidered with ivy leaves that trailed delicate down his arms and across his shoulders, He wore black jeans, beige penny loafers, and a thin silver choker with the same ivy motif as if he expected that there was a bridge too far and he could find it. He would be disappointed then, because Harry liked it all. Everything from the return of the rings to the delicate sweep of his blond hair tousled back.
The words were so immature, Draco took a second longer to compute them. By the time he understood what Harry was saying, Harry was already striding out of the room and hiding in Draco’s study. Another thing Draco hadn’t noticed until then was that Harry never sought refuge in his old painting studio. Instead, he’d rather be anywhere with Draco’s things close to him.
“I really can’t share you,” he repeats, and Harry nods understandingly. “I missed you so much, Harry.”
Past-Harry smiles at the camera with glinting eyes and flushed cheeks, and Draco’s heart skips a beat. They had both been wearing matching light-blue tailored suits—Draco’s choice, obviously—with navy bow ties, on Harry’s insistence, and they looked beautiful and completely in love.
"Atty, sound us off," Oliver insisted. He scooped her up and placed her on a table while she giggled amongst weak protests that she couldn't possibly.
Harry’s fingers brush his forearm, the softest touch on his mark. Draco shudders and cries. He asks for more, for
“Well, Potter, aren’t you gifted with your words?” Draco says, but he can’t quite stare at Harry while his cheeks burn madly, and the words lose half of their bite.
Harry points at Draco’s handiwork, still resting on the stove, before he has a chance to say anything. "It smells fantastic.”
Elle opens her eyes, surprising herself with the ease of the simple action, something that had her grimacing in pain minutes before. The stiffness that’s permeated her movements for months seems to have completely disappeared, evident from the effortless way her chest rises and falls with every breath, and how her eyes cast around seamlessly. The sedative potion Draco’s given her before the procedure is still acting on her body, causing her movements to be slow, but steady and calculated.
“Don’t,” Draco interrupts. He can’t hear what she has to say right now. Maybe he’ll never be ready to.
It’s been like this since Harry left his house three weeks before. He tries not to think about it, not to be hurt by it. Draco was getting used to not having Harry, before their encounters started becoming something more of a constant.
"I wouldn’t know," said Harry for the sake of conversation. "How did you get into magical houses anyway?"
"Excellent choice," she said and shot off in the other direction, because everyone knew Harry drank the same pint of Lethifold Lane ale every single time he went out with them.
"Like recognises like. I still would," Millicent said. Harry's mind was feebly trying to contend with the concept of Pomona Sprout, queer icon. This rapidly degenerated into a conversation of which Hogwarts teachers were fuckable.
Harry was not anyone’s older brother, but now he had an idea about how that protective instinct would sit uncomfortably on him. It wasn’t about age. Atty was nineteen and Luc was twenty-two. But she was a first time rookie, and Luc had been called up to Ligue Sept at seventeen and to the Falcons at nineteen.
Blaise shrugs, and the rest of the room chuckles lightly. No one has really forgotten Harry’s words, but it’s a silent agreement not to engage in the heavy topic for now.
"Sixteenth century. Gold and diamond. Do you think I look silly?" Draco asked. Harry opened his mouth to protest that it was different somehow, but instead he caught sight of himself in the mirror over his armoire. Harry looked…much the same to his own eye. Just Harry, wearing an incredibly expensive necklace. What caught his eye was how Draco was watching him, attentive.
The photoshoot was less fun than chatting with Lee. Here, the photographer, Toni, tried to get Harry to lighten up while several assistants appeared to be there just to keep Harry's naked body warm. Harry had, at least, remembered to Disillusion his tattoos.
He sighs, wearily eying the assembly on top of the table he’s ignored while Mrs Weasley was there. He repositions it in the center of the room and pours himself another glass of the abandoned wine he finds in one of the empty cupboards. It’s just tasteless now.
"Surely there's a way to gain influence without showing everyone my—" Harry made a gesture at his body, though he was fully clothed in his favourite Nike sweatshirt. Good thing too, since her office walls were glass and facing all of Diagon.
Pansy didn’t, because she doesn’t know he’s here, but Draco’s not about to let his friend get into trouble. “She doesn’t know. I sneaked in,” Draco murmurs.
"I like the gold," Draco said, tapping his own fingernails. "Also I didn’t think you still wore the glasses." Draco was, of course, wearing his glasses.
"I have a lot of time in the summers. And it’s better to keep busy than not do anything," Harry said with a shrug.
"Guys, leave her alone," Harry said. Luc and Milo ignored Harry and continued trying to figure out what rhymed with Blake.
"I'll have to do some research to find out what happened to this." Draco brandished the vault contents parchment before slipping it into an inside pocket. "I won't be back until Monday. Keep up the magic transfers, please. Farewell."
"It’s a greenhouse. I thought it was a bit warm for this time of year," Neville said. "Most of the flowers are lilac, honeysuckle, and jasmine. Could use a trim, but they look good."
When Harry stumbled across the inventory Draco made of potential locations for Potter family artefacts, Harry knew what he could ask for. He left a note asking to see Draco and, as simple as that, Draco stayed until Harry was home from training.
“We can’t keep going on like this, you can’t deal with this on your own,” Harry whispers, hands cupping Draco’s. “I feel it getting closer. I want you to be happy, when I—”
None of this happens, though, and when he reaches the pub, he catches  sight of Blaise’s slender figure waiting for him by the door.
Usually, Harry ate two breakfasts, both simple. One was a green smoothie before his workout. After, he had a homemade fruit salad, greek yogurt, a Nutrition Potion that tasted as if someone had somehow allowed peanut butter to spoil, and boiled eggs with salt if he was feeling decadent.
When Pansy and Hermione finally adopt the sweetest twin girls, Ava and Emma, Harry and Draco fall in love with them immediately, and the single bed in Teddy's room becomes triple beds. They come over often, and love Uncle Draco and Uncle Harry.
Draco glances around once. He’s not in the forest anymore. He looks around again and the landscape finally sinks in.
Being without Harry felt like dying anyway, he thinks, without voicing his words. Instead, he says, “I’m fine.”
The next day, Draco asks Harry if he can take Draco through the path to Hogwarts' Tree of Life. Harry seems reluctant about it, but doesn’t resist much after Draco explains Hermione’s theory about the trees and Voldemort.
, he tells himself. Harry isn’t here because he feels sorry for Draco, though that’s what he claims. Draco knows what he feels, he’s had to deal with it for too long. This is probably too much for Harry to handle, he reasons. He shouldn’t force his own feelings on Harry, he just doesn’t know how to stop.
"It's silly though, I'm a bit old for that," Harry said. It was nice to have Pansy and her amber perfume settle over him, warmth radiating from her. She patted him on the knee.
"Gwen, how are you? And your wife and kids?" Harry asked. Eugenia and Carlota were in their fourth year at Hogwarts. They had long since graduated from poking their heads into rooms he was in and giggling.
"Orgy?" Harry said. He had put himself down as the promiscuous one in his friend group, but he'd never been to an orgy. He had participated in one threesome last Worlds, and he promised he’d never subject himself to that stressful a division of his attention ever again.
Harry does this often when he doesn’t want to talk about something, but Draco’s found he prefers it when Harry’s trying to distract him rather than blatantly ignoring him.
before leaving the house. There’s a huge photo of a clearly annoyed Harry under giant capital letters spelling
That wasn't quite it. Of course, he wondered. He wondered about what his parents would have thought of his career in professional Quidditch. What would they have eaten at Christmas? What was he missing? He wanted to know which set of grandparents would have given him dusty sweets and which would buy him itchy holiday outfits.
“I think she’ll be great with them,” Harry says close to him, and Draco notices he has neglected hearing part of the conversation.
"We are back in business. Pray. Burn incense. Thank your ancestors. We have to replicate this success. Don’t do anything new if you can help it," Coach said.
“Let me cast some more diagnostics,” Pansy offers hurriedly, taking her wand back. “Talk to me, let me know if you feel any discomfort or—”
"Hello," Harry said. He decided the longer he went without saying hello, the weirder it was going to get. Draco flushed. He wore a good outfit today: cream coloured trousers and brown knit sweater vest over a collared shirt. One ear had a pretty dangly earring. Harry didn’t know what it was called, but he liked it.
Where’s Harry? Harry always holds him tight whenever he has a nightmare. Harry’s arms are supposed to come around his waist, lips on Draco’s nape, whispering sweet nothings to his trembling form until he falls asleep again.
He’s tall, his bulky legs wrapping around his own stool. The man smiles brightly at him, lips full and flushed.
Harry snorted and held a hand out. A bottle appeared in it as if Summoned. He handed it to Draco who read the label.
He doesn’t dwell on the lyrics, instead committing those violin chords to memory. It’s a beautiful song, Draco thinks, pulling Harry closer by his side, fingers slipping to the hair at his nape as the man on the radio sings,
Draco’s hands are on his thighs, pushing Harry up on the table. “Well, I’m starving,” he says raggedly, positioning himself between Harry’s legs, mouth searching for the spot on his neck Draco knows is bound to make him writhe. He finds it, and Harry whines.
The laziness of the early days of summer nestles inside Draco’s bones as he rests his back against the tree trunk. The side of his shoulder touches Potter’s and although it’s too hot for the contact, he doesn’t pull away.
“Just give him some space. He’ll come around.” Something in her pointed glance tells him she knows about the letters he sent, but none of them bring it up.
Harry looked at him. Draco prodded the canvas hard, and, while Walburga Black protested, they couldn’t hear a word she said.
Harry sighs. He doesn’t move closer, but he doesn’t pull away either. “I had a part of Voldemort’s soul inside of me. It needed to be destroyed—
Because of his injury, Harry was free to join Hermione and Ron that Wednesday for dinner instead of their usual firecall. Harry was beginning to feel a little like a stray dog wandering between friendly homes, but Harry had never before been out for a week without being in St Mungo’s.
"I don’t do gymnastics," Stella said with a stubborn jut of her chin, folding her arms across her chest.
He searches Harry’s face, but he’s still staring at the picture, circling the shape of the musical instrument with his index finger. He finally lifts his head and gazes at Draco, eyes unreadable. “You play?”
"All translation spells are terrible. Hand it over here." Draco pulled out his glasses from an inner pocket, put them on and peered at the letter on pale blue parchment. "She is very sorry. Her grandfather, who was—I don’t know these particular words but the gist is many curses upon his name—was a collector.
Draco had been terrified. But how could he explain that the possibility of living without Harry had seemed worse? It still does. He doesn’t know how Harry will take it and only shrugs.
The day after, Harry came home to piano music drifting down the stairs. It was past six, so Draco wasn't on the clock right now. He had rolled his sleeves up, and Harry got a proper glimpse of his coverup: a full sleeve of runes. Muggle tattoo. Despite the black of the ink and the underlying red brand of the Mark, you couldn’t tell what it had been.
Harry’s fingers brush across the thin white lines scarring Draco’s chest. He stops, eyes roaming over the patterns that mar the alabaster skin.
so young. Sometimes, when Harry looked at him and thought about what his childhood had been like, it made him sick. But Teddy was very different than Harry had been. Teddy needed to be reminded of his manners. Teddy chattered away to friends and family. Teddy did most of his chores sloppily, if at all. Harry loved him like that.
Draco exhales with force and sits up, mirroring Harry’s position. He brushes a hand across his face and takes a deep breath, trying to smooth the remnants of sleep induced irritability.
But Harry had heard tales about those who had survived, and he wasn't sure he quite agreed. Their generation had fallen from vigilante justice groups to addiction to homelessness. If it wasn't for some people who were unflinching in facing the war, Harry thought the Ministry might have just jailed everyone that didn't pay a bribe and been done with it, regardless of the side they fought on. There should have been programmes or something. Instead, they'd punished a few people harshly and let the rest loose. The Ministry wanted the war to be over more than resolved, and they had all paid for it.
"Potter, get your head out of your arse," Coach roared at him during timeout. "Why do you look lost? You are the Captain. I will pull Park off the bench, you hear me? Get it the fuck together."
“But you didn’t know this part of me,” Harry mumbles feebly. “You’re allowed to reject it. I don’t expect you to—”
Draco doesn’t dwell much on the fact that the life he’s trying to save is his own, even more than Harry’s. He’s selfish, but he’s also guilty.
"You can keep the glasses," Draco said and proceeded to re-enact that scene with such extraordinary attention to detail that Harry was certain he had read that book and also the one that was on his dresser last month. Very faithfully done aside from the bit with the enchanted ropes, although Draco improvised admirably.
“Draco…” Harry’s hand lifts slowly, making its way to Draco’s face. It hovers close to the skin, never touching. “When I touch you, what does the bond make you feel?”
The summer after the war, when Harry lived in it, Grimmauld Place seemed safe. During the day, he was always with Ron and Hermione at trials, memorials, funerals and rebuilding projects. All three of them wept a lot. At night, they drank in a passive, idle way. Most of the time it was a case of beer to the three of them. Sometimes it was sangria, which Harry thought might have been Hermione’s half-hearted attempt to prevent them from contracting scurvy.
I had a few days to prepare for it. My Sunday routine had morphed into lazy stay-ins with Luna and the cats, so I couldn’t help but feel a little anxious at the change. And the Burrow was not… As empty as I would’ve expected.
Maybe Harry followed the same reasoning as he did. If no one knows about their not-date, they’ll be able to pretend it never happened if this doesn’t work out.
Harry pulls back, breaking the contact between them. “Aren’t you worried I might go into a coma again?”
reporters finding him, or him bumping into someone who hates him, or just the overall panic about being recognised.
"Is that Edward Lupin?" Oliver called from the far bike. "Merlin, you’re getting tall. Hogwarts next year, right?" Teddy nodded. "I remember when you were a wee little thing. Hope you’re treating your Nan well."
The way the chillness spreads in his body is unlike anything Draco’s ever felt. It’s slow, almost as calm as Harry’s magic feels. Hopelessness slithers across his body, to his limp limbs, to his dry eyes; claws like iron squeeze his heart.
And so, Draco works. He distracts himself from the fact that his husband doesn’t remember their story, and doesn't want to see him. At least he knows he is close to Harry in a way; the magic pulling them together is warm and constant. He will be there, if Harry remembers everything suddenly or if he wishes to see Draco.
"Hangover Potion." Harry looked at it with reflexive suspicion. Draco rolled his eyes. "Ah yes, you’ve caught me. I will enact my elaborate revenge on behalf of the Arrows, and I’ll do it after being seen with you in public by a dozen witnesses, and right in your bed when it happens."
“It’s Harry,” she starts again, and it only takes a second for the words to sink in Draco. “Something’s wrong. I met him a couple of nights ago, and he was weird. He acted like when…” she doesn’t finish her sentence, but Draco knows, clear as day, what she’s referring to.
Stella smiled brightly with too many teeth. "I'm afraid that's not a question. Does anyone have a question?"
As much as Draco wants to know all the ways this new Harry sees the world, Harry also seems curious about him. He’s always asking questions that leave Draco’s cheeks burning and the bond pulsing happily in his chest.
“You’re here,” Draco sighs, hands fumbling over Harry’s entire body as if he doesn’t remember its shapes, just needing to be sure it’s really happening. “Harry, you stayed.”
As his voice got louder, the crystal plate Draco was holding shattered in his hand. Blood dripped down his hand even as the plate flew back together with hairline fractures visible on its surface. Draco hadn't even gestured.
He risks a glance at Harry, who’s smiling peacefully as he says, “Let’s go. It’s getting late.” But he doesn’t look at Draco again that afternoon.
," Draco said, as if outraged by his lack of frosting. "If you’re going to eat cake for breakfast, do it right." Harry thought he enjoyed watching Draco eating it more than he liked the sweetness. Draco relished his slice so much, making sure each forkful had the same ratio of cake to frosting, chasing each crumb.
She’s always called him Potter, even after he and Harry adopted each other’s last names. Draco takes some comfort in that for a second.
Some are distant and formal. He’s glad he didn’t send any of those, although the overemotional missives he might have delivered in some intoxicated state are no better. Most of them, however, display a myriad of
what was on your mind before swearing at the only female reporter in our press corps for asking a simple question. Do you want to go to Nationals? Are you a misogynist or just not very smart, hm? Could it be both?"
Draco nods, lips coming to press against Harry’s palm. “Too much work. I will be fine,” he whispers to the lines of Harry’s hand.
Taken aback by the question, Draco adjusts himself in his seat, unable to find a comfortable position. His eyes search Harry’s face for something he can’t find in their bond. Where was the anger he was expecting?
It’s a long shot, though, to bind someone’s magic into an inanimate object and ensure that it’ll remain active and sealed until it can be restored to its owner. There’s a reason wizards use wands to channel their magic, and the idea of a wizard’s magic wild and on the loose is terrifying. He’ll never go forth with it before he has Healer Cameron’s approval, though he knows this is the only possible solution to her case. Draco worries Elle won’t live long enough for him to figure another one out.
"I know how much you make, of course you’re going to pay," Pansy said. "Let me have one more. We'll walk a bit." He handed her one cigarette, and she lit it with a snap of her fingers and a whisper, an impressive bit of magic.
Draco nodded once. Harry pulled Draco into a messy but perfect kiss with no hesitation. Harry didn’t hold back at all, not content to slow down until he was pressed up firmly against him, until he could feel the warm sweep of Draco’s tongue against his. One of Draco’s hands cupped his cheek warmly, and the other rested on the hand that still held the Snitch. It fluttered against their hands. They kept breaking off the embrace to smile into each other’s mouths. The stadium was still loud, but Harry thought even if every single person in there were unhappy, he wouldn’t have been able to hear it.
Draco goes to the centre the next Saturday, though, despite his churning insides and growing fear of being completely out of place in a space that used to be his safe spot.
The season picked back up as fast as it had relented. The Tornados were an easy win, and Harry let Stella manage the Chaser line so he could zip through and catch the Snitch forty-five minutes in. There was a lot of joking on the bikes, and they even had a group hot tub session to further revel in the easy victory.
And then, Draco remembers, and casts his eyes down, immediately finding the web of white marks on his torso he never thought he’d be able to forget. The scars Harry left there three years ago.
Of course, this new system is something he’s been practicing for only a day, and Draco can’t quite bring himself to stop Elle when she carries on.
"I'm not telling you that. It was everyone," Neville said. "I'll think of it fondly when I'm a hundred and twenty. That's all you get. Are you being weird because it's Draco?"
It’s not desire moving him now. It’s starvation—but not for food. He’s hungry for something he can’t have: more information about Harry, Harry himself, love. Soup is what he’s got now, though. Draco silently grabs one bowl and starts eating.
Harry doesn’t respond. They don’t talk again before they go to bed that night. Pleads, rage and despair assault Draco’s mind all night, but what wins in the end is hope. He can fix it, if only he has a little more time. Harry will be fine, they will both be fine.
"Harry, my love, what can I do for you? Is everything fine?" Barb was never surprised to see him, even when he walked into her Diagon Office without appointment. It was one of the tricks Harry thought she must have developed as the first female major Quidditch League agent.
It seemed Draco was not going to be content with a quick fuck to take the edge off. He moved at a leisurely pace, and Harry matched him to have more time to commit every gasp to memory. That splotchy flush of arousal. His shoulder bared to Harry.
"Going with Blaise to visit his mother like every year," Draco said offhandedly. How old was the fallout with Draco’s parents if he went to Italy every December? "What about New Year’s Eve?"
to watch. The sounds coming from the telly act as background noise during their idle chat. At one point, Harry asks Draco to play the violin for him again. Draco does so, chest puffed with pride, and Harry applauds him when the song is finished. They cook lunch together—chicken marinara—and decide to order Chinese for dinner.
"You should look into that bell you promised." Draco swept broadly with his wand and the books all flew to the bookcases. Draco tucked it safely away in the waistband of his jeans and stood leaning against the piano with his arms crossed. "What’s with you and your obsession with my clothing anyway?"
He shakes his head. “No. I could have done more. I should have healed you.” He had promised her she’d be better, she’d be fine. But he had let her go. Just like he had let Harry slip from his grasp.
"Did you?" Harry said off-kilter. He didn’t expect Draco to bring it up with him, and he wasn’t sure which of the stock answers he had in his back pocket might address whatever concerns Draco had. Frankly, after his defense of the house’s heritage, if Draco was coming forward in defense of pure-blood bullshit to "understand the historical context" or whatever, Harry might toss him out the door, the house be damned.
“It feels safe around you,” Harry says apropos of nothing, and hands a cup for Draco to dry, who almost drops it on the floor.
"Intent matters," she said, frowning. "But wearing someone’s family ring used to be enough to declare a Marriage Bond if you’re a pure-blood. Most people still present theirs to their intended when courting. It’s not the kind of magic you want to invoke by accident."
Harry’s rigid for a second, and then his hands are everywhere on Draco’s body. He whispers, “You’re my star, you know that?”
"That doesn’t mean it’s fair. Will you be all right?" She sniffled hard, but shook out her shoulders and nodded.
"This is not the official playbook, or you wouldn't be able to see what I was working on." Harry reset, frowning at the pressure he'd be putting on Min-woo. Atty was playing centre, but if she played right…
and Draco had found himself jobless; how Draco’s and Narcissa’s relationship had been possible again only because of Harry’s insistence and how thankful he is for that. He tells Harry about their lazy mornings, their favourite TV show, Christmases they’d spent at the Burrow with the Weasleys. If Harry is surprised by any of it, he doesn’t show it, just listening intently as Draco narrates each aspect of their lives together.
“It’s not only that,” Pansy cuts in with pursed lips, brows furrowed. She turns to Granger keenly, eyes fierce. “You’ve heard about the tree at Hogwarts, right? The one in the Forbidden Forest everyone says is enchanted.”
. He loved that Draco had found someone else to talk to, and Winston warmed up considerably when he realised Harry was no longer single.
It takes a good portion of his strength to hold on to whatever force has been keeping him standing and breathing during all this time. Her magic is caring and maternal, draping around him, something he’s only ever felt with one other person: his mother. Draco wants to let go, to be held, to be told everything is going to be okay, to cry, but he doesn’t think there are tears left in him. In the end, he just holds himself still by the door, as the plates organise themselves on the table; beef bourguignon, French soup, apple pie, cassoulet and at least three more dishes.
“What’s all that?” Harry asks, sitting by his side on the small but comfortable couch Draco had made him buy when he moved in. He shoves a cup of coffee in Draco’s hand, and Draco directs a thankful grin at him.
Yes, he does, so much. But he can’t. Not yet. Not to be alone in the darkness until the morning comes, not to pretend everything is okay, when nothing is.
Draco regretted the letter the moment he sent it. It had been rushed and not thought out in the least.
That’s it. He can’t stay here and listen to this. He can imagine what she’s about to say; he’s heard it all from Pansy, Blaise, and even Hermione over the years.
Draco feels like he might explode. He’s a mess. Harry is sticking his pieces together one by one, just so he can break them again later. Draco sucks a breath in, the air doesn’t seem to reach his lungs; it isn’t enough. Nothing is enough. “I’ve always been yours,” he stutters. “I’ve always been here.”
"I read your opinion piece," Draco said, rather stiffly. He was still crouched on the ground next to Harry, although he kept his eyes on the playbook and the tiny figurines careening around on the floor.
he would not stand for quietly without making his complaints known. He did collect all those crudely dumped fish then, but not for any rudimentary purpose like eating.
But Draco gave gifts as good as he was given in return during the holidays. Christmas was a whole other complicated event. Fun, but fatiguing.
Draco still hadn’t given up his mealtime ritual to eat out of Harry’s hands, which Harry always dutiful held for him. Though now, Harry had taken to cutting up the fish earlier and feeding it to Draco in bite sized  portions, a change that Draco greatly approved.
The woman named Hermione sighed. “Harry, I know how concerned you are for Draco.” Her voice softened, but her tone stayed firm. “But I can’t skip procedure, even for you, nor give you more answers on a developing case than I already have.”
Blinking, Harry slowly picked it up again, staring at him all throughout his action. Draco didn’t care if the other thought him odd for it, having just discovered he quite liked this new manner of eating. And evidently Harry, despite his initial pause, was still willing to try again.
It was at the point that being with Harry reminded him of Luna instead of making him momentarily forget his separation from her. Almost immediately after Harry would leave him, he would take that blessed happiness with him. And Draco would be hit with a sense of loneliness and the abject trepidation, that just like Luna, Draco might never see him again.
As the dragon roared and had a good time of it, Harry sat patiently on his pile without moving like he was supposed to. Doing his best to keep his eardrums intact.
The last glimpse of the upset and broken look on his mate’s face had Draco falling into the silence. His wish that he could be there for his mate as much as the other could be there for him went unfulfilled. As more white uniforms appeared into the room, the heat consumed him.
Touches never took place beyond where Draco’s mouth might graze Harry’s palms and fingers, or his greedy hands might hold Harry’s hands up for himself to have better access to the fish cupped in their palms.
On cue, Draco felt the telltale buzz against his throat that silenced his voice once again. Used to not speaking, the frustration at having his voice suppressed had died in him a long time ago. Regardless if he could sing, no listener existed who could understand the full meaning within his melody.
Earlier that morning the gem-plant-bug had arrived on their doorstep in a floral-decorated jar and was now being sorted with the rest.
“Sorry.” Harry shoved the door shut behind him. He set the package he’d intercepted from their owl on the table for Draco to sort out.
Harry wrapped his arms tighter around Draco, who didn’t remember when they got there, but was even more thankful all the same. The song in his chest still sang even if it couldn’t escape his mouth.
After a moment of internal deliberation, Harry took off his glasses and joined him in a splash. Draco dove under to greet him.
He ripped into the fish, feeling quite ravenous and uncaring how messily he did so. Luna wasn’t one to judge.
“I’m sorry, I only meant… I only wished to save them all. But I know you’re going to take them and I can’t- I cannot…” He struggled for words, and when none came, all of his control seemed to crumble as his face broke into tearful pleads.
It was the same for the muzzled and mitten wearing wolf shifter in the cage next to his tank, who’d given up on conversation with Draco entirely a year ago once he understood Draco’s voice was magically restrained. The master took special care to lock away the too dangerous parts of the magical creatures in his ensemble. The centaur herd were kept docile through potions, the phoenix’s wings remained constantly clipped, the giant was under strength-limiting spells, and the pack of werewolves including his neighbor were routinely made to wear indestructible gloves and masks even when in human form, amongst other tailored practices for other creatures as were needed. And of course, he himself as the last siren alive wore a collar which told him when he could or couldn’t sing.
Draco didn’t wait for them to grab him too. Quickly, he reversed his direction, going back the way he came, made easier by the slippery trail of water he left behind when coming from it. He strained his arms until the footsteps behind him couldn’t make it in time to catch his tail as it slid back into the pool. He didn’t even bother looking back to see what they would do to pursue him.
Harry rushed over to him, while Hermione trailed after him at a more comfortable pace, looking at Harry thoughtfully. Draco’s tail thudded against the side of the tank in his eagerness to see Harry as well. And to finally meet one of Harry’s best friends, albeit under the circumstances Draco was having trouble focusing on her.
Draco appreciated a belated apology over none. In no mood or state to give anyone else grief, he merely nodded his understanding, which earned him another smile from the redhead. He seemed to be a person, like Luna, whose regular expression was a smile and who enjoyed talking. It’s a good thing Harry wasn’t like that, or Draco would be distracted by his smile and voice all the time. Thinking of Harry made him nervous and his body clench for some reason, so Draco focused back on the redhead in front of him.
For the first time, Draco considered how sated his stomach felt… given how long he’d been out. As he scrutinized his own belly for signs of being underfed, he didn’t remember eating or receiving any fish. Slightly alarmed, Draco leveled him a suspicious look, which the other correctly understood.
All the oppressive magic slowly receded like the tide, taking what little settling effect it had on Draco with it, and the man smiled softly, “You’re welcome.”
Harry smiled down at him, where Draco had purposefully laid on top of Harry’s torso perpendicularly before the time he would leave. But it seemed the other had caught onto this tactic. He started gently heaving Draco off of him earlier than usual.
He felt cooler hands place themselves on him that made his body shudder, as he was pulled toward the surface with Harry, where he’d otherwise sink like a rock to the bottom. Taking him to the edge of the tank where they could cling to the rim of the sides, Harry asked him, worry written all over his face.
can tell that to the papers.” Hermione sighed, trying to remain exasperated, but a smile still graced the corners of her mouth. She obviously approved of her friend’s happiness, despite the current inconveniences it had caused.
Draco had the gut feeling he didn’t want to meet these twins, despite Charlie’s eyes softening at mentioning them. He reached down and grabbed something in a wrapper which smelled like food—which had Draco’s shoulders instinctually rising defensively—but it turned out to be for himself and not Draco as he unwrapped and bit into something crunchy that smelled but looked nothing like fish.
It seemed unjust that such a magnificent animagus couldn’t be seen out in the open, where it ought to freely fly. Harry would like to fly with him.
“Took longer than expected.” Harry rescued two packages that were beginning to, slowly but surely, float out a window. He closed it before more could, earning him a grateful look from Malfoy.
At that, Draco stared incredulously at her, burying the urge to laugh. Then they were misunderstanding entirely, and he would be miserably stuck here experiencing an eternal heatwave while the answer was right next to him, stroking his hair. All his ‘state’ needed was Harry’s reciprocation of Draco’s mating song and they could both continue on happily as a mated pair. Can’t they put two and two together? Was their information on siren’s copulation so
He felt more tugging on his navel and chest than usual as they reappeared in Diagon alley, in front of a small shop with pink tinted windows and a cheerfully orange door. It belonged to one of Draco’s favorite shops for pre-made potions and tinctures. Ever the potion connoisseur, (a fact Draco loved to rub in Harry’s face but less so these days), he wanted the storerooms in his cavern stocked up with dittany. More than even healers at St. Mungos could put to practical use.
Despite his obvious expression and hiss of warning, Harry casually sat across from Draco with the bucket of fish next to him. And
For the days that followed, at all three mealtimes, Harry would always appear. Partly, because Draco personally ensured their arrangement persisted unchanged.
Once more, the other presented the fish, this time with both hands and without dropping it while Draco dug in. As he ate, he enjoyed where the other’s skin brushed his nose and the way the fingers would twitch in response. Yes, much better than a plate.
Harry’s voice hitched continuously as he slammed the rest of himself against Draco, as if he wished to sing back as well, but could only manage repeating Draco’s name over and over. The mating need grew and grew in Draco, and Draco embraced it and Harry with all his magic and being.
Strong eyebrows hung over large emerald-colored eyes behind circular glasses. A less pointy nose than Draco’s sat above lips perfect for framing any song they’d sing. The sturdy neck promised a strong voice, and black locks of hair stuck in every direction except the same one as its neighbors. A shirt hugging a firm chest and lean stomach was visible in the opening of his red robes, and below that, long legs which would suit a longer tail.
A chorus of “I love you, too”s meet his ears as another contraction rips through his body. He moans and rocks against Draco and the instant it subsides, they Portkey away.
The soft smile on Draco’s lips sets the pixies to dancing with renewed vigour and Harry busies himself assembling the pasta, sauce, and chicken, before covering it with cheese and sliding it in the oven.
“Yes, Al. I’m happier than I’ve been in a very long time. I have a fiancé I love very much who loves me in return and treats me wonderfully well. We have four amazing kids and one more on the way.” He pats Al’s shoulder. “This is the kind of happiness I wish for you kids one day.”
“The Healer said he’s so skinny there’s nowhere for the baby to hide,” Draco explains. “And he’ll be much bigger before this is over.”
“I’d like to.” Harry does want to tell Hermione, but he also doesn’t want to make Draco uncomfortable. “She already knows we’re dating. She’ll ask how it’s going. And I can trust her.”
Draco laughs. “Both! And you know it!” He shakes his head. “But seriously. We have a new department that’s working specifically on long-term side effects from Dark Magic. You would have an exceptional skill set for that.” Draco glances at Harry.
“Fuck, I’m nervous.” Harry runs a hand through his hair and looks to Draco, who is sitting on their couch sipping a cup of tea.
Minerva blinks rapidly. “Are you to tell me in eleven years’ time, Hogwarts will be host to a Potter-Malfoy child?”
“I am going to put you on modified bedrest, Mr Potter. You need to be reclining or laying down at all times. You can go to the loo and you can move between your bedroom and the living room. Otherwise, I’d prefer you not move around any more than necessary.” She glances from Harry to Draco and back again. “I’m also going to advise that you not have any vigorous anal penetration. No anal sex, nothing larger than three fingers. Anything smaller is ok for now, including toys that vibrate. If you have pain or unusual discharge, stop immediately and call me.”
“You’ve lost another four pounds in addition to the two and a half you lost last week, and you’re anaemic. You need to eat more to keep you and the baby nourished.” She continues her spell work. “You’re not feeling faint?”
Matthew gives James a meaningful look. He’s apparently the one who has been chosen to broach the subject first.
“Harry…” Draco’s moan sounds like a desperate plea, then he presses his cock deep into Harry’s arse and Harry feels himself being filled.
Draco slips an arm around Harry’s waist and squeezes gently. “You haven’t looked at your mobile, have you?” he asks with amusement in his voice.
James’ face goes red, knowing that he’s about to have a discussion about sex with his dad, his dad’s fiancé, and his boyfriend, but he nods. He disappears through the door and Harry immediately looks at Draco.
“James, just because I’d rather you not be having sex doesn’t mean I’m going to forbid it or pretend it’s not going to happen. I’d rather you have everything you need to be smart and safe.”
Harry snorts and a ghost of a smile touches the corners of his mouth. “This—” Harry gestures between them, “—makes a bit more sense now, knowing that Al’s been meddling in things.”
Eventually, the contractions begin to intensify, and Harry has to lean on Draco. He moans into his husband’s chest and his ear is filled with quiet whispers. “I love you. You’re amazing. I know this hurts but you’re birthing our son. I can’t tell you what that means to me.”
Harry smiles as he rolls over, spreading his legs around Draco again and planting his feet on the blanket. He gazes at Draco, who leans up between his legs and kisses him softly. Draco gently pushes one of Harry’s knees to his chest. Harry feels incredibly on display, more so than the times Draco has fingered and rimmed him already, as Draco’s gaze rakes down Harry’s body and then focuses on his hole.
In less than thirty minutes, he will be walking out into the garden with Draco and they’re going to be married. Draco will be his husband.
“Wonderfully, actually.” Draco snuggles closer, and Harry happily wraps an arm around him. “Last night was brilliant, but waking up next to you might be even better.”
“I’d like to perform a more thorough exam, if Mr Potter is comfortable with that. We’ll know more about your specific situation with that information.”
“How did that go?” The drumming is back. Harry can’t help but smile. His best friend’s relentless pursuit of knowledge extends to his love life too, evidently.
And he does. Harry pushes, and then there’s fire burning in his groin. He stops pushing as his body involuntarily screams in pain.
“Just a rough conversation with Scorp. He’s having a bit of a hard time wrapping his brain around this. It’s come as three pretty quick big events for him, and he’s never had to grapple with me even dating before.”
“It’s just after nine, so a few hours.” Draco’s hands rub his stomach gently. “What kind of pain are you having?”
A tea tray appears in Harry’s field of vision and he looks up, watching Malfoy delicately place the tray with two teacups on the table. Malfoy settles into the seat across from Harry and pours them each a cup.
Draco steps to the middle of the nursery and lifts his wand, complex movements and strings of Latin sending silver wisps of Magic dancing around the room before settling on the walls. All the constellations represented in their family now twinkle against that beautiful blue. He steps back to the door and both men survey his work.
“Let me clean this up, and we can go upstairs.” He gathers the remains of their dinner, and Draco grabs the popcorn bowl and empty butterbeer bottles.
“Looks like an ugly tree stump. Has thorn-covered vines hidden inside. Never handle alone, always with two or more people. Pulsating pods are about the size of a grapefruit.”
“Not necessarily.” Harry shakes his head. “You’ll have trouble using it in magic spaces if it’s not, but magic won’t hurt it. They’re much easier to ward than a telly, though. I warded mine and the boys’ myself after Hermione showed me how.”
Several minutes later, Harry makes his way through the barrier to Platform 9 ¾. He immediately sees Draco’s white-blonde hair across the platform where he’s talking to Blaise, who, like Hermione, knows about their relationship and is supportive.
. “There’s a wide variety that can be used alone or with a partner. Using a mix of fingers and toys before you move on can help.”
“He’s right, Harry,” Hermione has her information-delivering face on. “Pregnancy taxes a witch’s body as much as doing high-endurance sports every day. It’s even more demanding on a wizard’s body. And it taxes your magic on top of your physical self. It’s quite fascinating.”
By the time Hermione heads home that evening, there’s a tailor coming in the morning with a selection of robes, early afternoon has a jeweller scheduled to pick out wedding bands, and there’s a rough sketch done of the arch under which they will be married, which Hermione is taking care of. The younger kids have taken on the task of tidying up the garden, and James and Matthew have volunteered to contact several photographers so they can have pictures.
“Thank you.” Harry leans into Draco. “We’re both excited. We wanted you to know before the press catches wind.”
James scoots a bit down the bed to better see the bubble. Healer Carr very patiently talks James through every feature of Regulus’ tiny body, his umbilical cord, and measuring the fluid in his amniotic sac, and patiently answers each of his many questions. Harry loves seeing Regulus— but today, he thinks he might be enjoying watching James’ fascination with the medical side of things even more.
Harry feels the magic of the potion wash through him and finally opens his eyes. Concerned grey eyes meet his.
He feels the bed shift as Draco sits up, but he can’t even bring himself to look over at his husband. He just rocks, slowly, and tries to think about anything other than the constant discomfort he’s feeling.
“Yes,” Harry breathes and lifts his hips just off the bed. Somehow his nerves go out the window and all he can feel is Draco’s hands on his skin as his pants slide over his hips and his cock springs free. Draco drags them down Harry’s legs and tosses them aside.
“You can, but I’m fairly proficient at packing charms. It won’t take long. I have a couple of expandable trunks.”
“It’s over. You did great. Everything went perfect.” There’s a strained joy in Draco’s voice, and Harry can’t imagine how hard it must have been for him to sit and wait for news. He reaches for his stomach.
“Let’s move on in before we cause a ruckus.” Draco and Harry herd all five children into the restaurant.
“We haven’t been out publicly as a couple yet because we wanted to tell you first. We do plan to be out publicly with the four of you over the break and by ourselves from here on out, so there will probably be press.” Draco’s voice takes on a firmer tone. “Harry and I do not want you kids to take any of the brunt of whatever the press cooks up. I want you to tell us immediately if you’re being harassed by reporters or photographers, okay?”
“I'm not sure I’d have the right skill set for working with rare magical maladies. I’m not as smart as you or Hermione,” Harry states quickly. He’s always been a hard worker, not necessarily naturally smart.
Harry reaches for his bedside table and pulls on the bottom drawer, warded to open only at his touch. He withdraws a phial of lube and coats the fingers of one hand and the palm of the other.
“Would you like a couple of moving images?” Healer Powell asks softly, seeming hesitant to interrupt the moment.
Draco continues his ministrations, working his way down Harry’s back, to the top of his arse. Harry is nearly a puddle on the blanket by the time he feels Draco shift and move off his arse.
“Do you know what colour or kind of wood you're looking for?” Bernice brings them to a stop in front of a section of bedroom furniture.
Harry rolls over and pushes himself to a sitting position next to Draco. He takes Draco’s hand and laces their fingers together, giving him a soft kiss.
“Better than a fight, I suppose.” Harry pushes himself into a seated position. “Did you Floo Minerva?”
Twenty minutes later — garlic finished, tomatoes diced, and basil chopped — Harry feels the wards shift just as he’s about to light the hob for the sauce. Wiping his hands on a towel, he heads for the front door.
“Hmmm. Let’s check your canal, then. I want to make sure this little one isn’t trying to make an early exit.” She peels back the blankets and casts a relaxing charm. “Leg up for me, please.”
Harry stomps down the stairs to the kitchen and sets about making a couple of sandwiches. He desperately wishes that he knew what was or wasn’t going on between him and Draco. At the very least, he wants to know what Draco is feeling towards him.
“Absolutely. If it goes absolutely awful, we can bring him here for the rest of the break and figure it out from there.” Draco closes his eyes for a moment. “I won’t let another child feel like I felt. He shouldn’t be made to feel dirty or worthless just because he’s attracted to men. It took me years to be truly okay with my sexuality after what my parents said.”
“I’ll get it.” Draco’s touch and subsequent easy smile give Harry butterflies in his stomach. “You’re helping me out today.”
A very refined-looking salesman comes walking towards them, and Harry watches him work to school his shocked expression as he realises Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy are standing in front of him, hand in hand.
Harry closes his eyes to fight the lump that springs uninvited into his throat. It’s hard for him to lay back and just let himself be taken care of. He’s so used to being the one taking care of someone else. He opens his eyes to meet Draco’s grey ones and nods.
“I’m still trying to decide exactly what I want to do, but I know I want to work with LGBTQIA+ kids.” James’ voice holds a lot of conviction and Harry is pleased that his son seems to be developing some focus in his goals at sixteen. He certainly wasn’t able to do that. “I want to be a counsellor or provide some kind of centre for them to be around other kids like them and get support — or even a place to live if they have parents like Matthew’s.”
“That’s appropriate. It also means we are fresh out of bedrooms for Regulus, so I’ll start calling contractors tomorrow.”
the garbage I went through. It just seems unfair that you dealt with so much, and nothing you did merited being put through it.”
Silently, Harry summons the chair to come up behind him and he sinks down. Draco shudders as Harry’s cleaning charm passes through him and his hands snake under Draco’s thighs, around his hips, to each grip one cheek of that delectable arse.
Patiently, Draco wipes his face and runs a comforting hand up and down his back until he’s able to sit up for water again.
“We didn’t waste any time after, though, seeing as we’re married and adding another little duck to our row today.” Draco pauses in his walking, tugging Harry into his arms and kissing his forehead. “It’s been a bit of a whirlwind romance, but it’s been perfect for us.”
“Thank you. That might be my saving grace.” He shrugs at the Healer. “Being still and doing nothing has never been a particular strength of mine.”
“You know I’ve not dated much since Ron, Harry.” Hermione’s face shows a hint of pain and Harry winces, regretting his hasty question. They usually avoid this topic. “But the man has generally asked me out on a date properly. I don’t always say yes, mind you.”
“Don’t hex anyone, Draco. I’ll be fine.” Harry loves Draco’s protective side, but he also has no desire to deal with the ramifications of his fiancé hexing the public.
Harry reaches down and the warded drawer clicks open at his touch. A tug and a silent summoning spell later, a vial of lube, a set of anal beads, and a vibrating dildo are in his hand. It’s not the charmed one he uses on himself, but it’ll be good for Draco’s first time using one on someone else. He sets them beside him on the bed and rolls over to kiss Draco softly.
“Ok, you three!” Harry turns back to the younger children. “We’ve got a Portkey home because I can’t Side-Along anyone this far along. We’ll activate it as soon as James comes back.”
Plates filled, the kids sprawl in the living room and opt to watch a movie while they eat. Harry is thankful the kids all seem to be rolling with the changes that keep coming at them. There’s still a lot to figure out, but for him and for Draco, there was never any other option than to take care of Matthew the best they can. The question is what, exactly, that’s going to look like.
“I recommend a longer-acting anti-nausea. I can give you the directions for brewing, Mr Malfoy. A male pregnancy usually entails pretty severe exhaustion, nausea, and magic fatigue from about four to twelve weeks. Your body has a lot more work to do than a female body. Unfortunately, it will probably get worse before it gets better.”
Harry keeps his eyes closed as he downs the potion and feels his body adjust. He cracks open his eyes and pulls off the glasses he no longer needs. Draco still has his eyes screwed tightly shut and the face that is no longer his looks pained.
“Pardon me if I haven't dedicated my time to stalking you like l used to in school,” Harry quips, voice laced with sarcasm.
“It’s a lot, love. I hate seeing you in so much pain but you’re managing it so well. You’re doing so much better than I ever would. And there are no words to tell you what this means to me, for you to bring our son into the world.”
Minerva steps back and squeezes his hands. “Off you go, then, before that fiancé of yours begins to fret. Keep in touch.”
“He’s still head down, which is good. If you watch, he’s practising his breathing. See his little lungs expand and contract?”
Several contractions later, Harry has begun to wonder if Healer Powell was somehow mistaken, that perhaps he still had more labouring to do. But then there’s fire spreading in his groin, and burning, so much burning, and he’s bucking back against Draco and there is nothing in the world except a desire to bear down, to push their son from his body.
Draco pushes himself up to sit and finds his shoes, passing Harry his, as well. Picnic blanket and basket surreptitiously shrunken and tucked into Draco’s jacket pocket, he takes Harry’s hand and they set off walking through the park. The night air is just chilly enough that Harry casts a wandless, wordless warming charm over them both.
Harry is in complete awe that this tiny person is growing inside him. He steals another glance at Draco, who positively beams at him.
As wonderful as the room is, the man standing in it putting away the last of the clothes and blankets is even better. Harry can’t understand how someone as caring and protective and wonderful as Draco could be
Draco laughs softly. “Absolutely nothing we’ve done in the bedroom…or, er, anywhere else…has been bad from my end. Merlin, especially that morning on the kitchen table. That was fantastic.”
“I won’t know until they let me see the fucking imaging.” Harry turns back to the Healer. “I work with core imaging. Specifically, cores of people exposed to Dark Magic as children and the long-term effects.”
Harry is unprepared for the full-faced smile that lights up Malfoy’s face. “Honestly, Potter, you have no idea what hearing that means to me. I was so misguided in my childhood.” Malfoy breathes a laugh, “I was a right spoiled little blood purist brat, honestly.”
“No, I want to do the nursery. I just need a minute and I’ll be good.” Harry stretches out on the couch and closes his eyes.
“Draco, it’s not your fault!” Harry sighs, hating that his fiancé feels guilty over his illness. “I mean, yes, it’s because I’m pregnant, but it’s not like you did something malicious. And the potion you brewed is helping. The nausea just keeps getting worse.”
Harry studies the case of rings, trying to imagine what he’d like Draco to slide onto his finger. There are some truly ostentatious designs, and some that are more plain than he would prefer. But on the back row, Harry spots something he likes.
“We’re ok. We’ll figure this out.” Harry scoots to one side of the narrow hospital bed and turns on his side. “Lay with me?”
“Vultures. All of them,” Harry mutters, re-evaluating his stance on the hexing. Draco snorts and they make their way down the sidewalk to the Apothecary. Harry again wishes that he could just enjoy his life without this madness. But he’s determined not to let the press and the public steal their happiness, so he leans close into Draco and focuses instead on enjoying a day out with the man he loves.
,” Draco shudders. Harry is pleased to see that even though the face and voice aren’t Draco's, the expressions and the vocal inflection most certainly are.
He tips over the edge and everything happens at once. His cock spurts thick white streams on the sheets, his ears are ringing, he feels like he’s free-falling, and he’s shouting Draco’s name. The dildo keeps going, wrenching every bit of Harry’s orgasm from him.
“Let's take a closer look this time.” Healer Carr mutters an incantation and the image in the bubble is suddenly more defined. She begins moving her wand with small, precise movements against Harry’s abdomen until there’s a distinct tiny face.
“Me, too.” Draco’s voice holds so much emotion. “I didn’t know how much I needed you until I had you.”
Harry takes a deep breath. Speaking openly about preferences during sex is never exactly easy. It’s a little awkward even in the best circumstances. But this is important to him. He wants to know what Draco likes and dislikes, and he wants Draco to feel comfortable doing things he knows Harry will enjoy.
“I’ll be fine, Al. Just some kind of stomach bug or something. I’m sure I’ll feel better tomorrow.” Harry frowns. “I’m sorry I can’t see you four off at the station.”
. He hears a movement-sensing charm go off and knows that means Draco will be in soon. Everything he tries to quell his nausea is useless, and he just ends up heaving to the point of tears, muscles sore from his earlier bout of vomiting.
There’s a soft chuckle and Draco obliges, setting a steady rhythm. The meeting of wet skin and their hard-panting breaths mix with the sounds of the shower running over them. Harry knows he’s already terribly close to the edge but this — his gorgeous fiancé setting his whole body alight with pleasure and sensation — is what he wants. He presses back into Draco, one hand wrapping around his cock while the other braces against the wall.
“The whole thing.” Hermione shoots him a look. “But yes, especially the library. Are you planning on finishing it before the baby?”
A knock at the bedroom door startles them both, but a quick glance at the clock tells Harry that his afternoon has gone quicker than he realised. James had come to keep him company while he laid down, and it had turned into a study session.
“Would you gentlemen like to know the sex? We should be able to tell today.” Healer Carr’s voice breaks through their moment.
“We certainly took long enough after that to get our ducks in a row and start seeing each other properly.” Harry shakes his head, thinking back to the weeks of awkward maybe-flirting on his part.
“It is. Help me up? I need to Floo Minerva and see if she’s free Saturday. And probably call Hermione.”
“Ah,” Draco nods, “that makes sense. If you tell Al today, he’ll be a complete disaster by Friday. Scorpius may strangle us both if we leave him to deal with a worked up Albus that long.”
Thirty minutes later, Draco is the proud owner of two new iPhones and Harry is glowering at the twenty-something clerk who has been flirting with Draco the entire time he’s been helping them.
“That’s the plan, but just in case.” Harry can hear the desperation in his own voice. He needs to know that his kids will be cared for, even if something does go wrong.
“The preferred way for men to give birth is naturally. Your body should be forming an additional path from your womb to your rectum. If it’s forming properly, you’ll be able to birth much like a female pregnancy but through the anus.”
Scorpius’ only response is a hiccough and a sob. Rubbing his back gently, Harry looks to Draco. “Do you suppose we should tell the others?”
“We’ll put enough in to start it for you. Once we know more about long-term plans, we’ll make any changes needed.”
“Ok, but I expect an honest answer from you, as well.” Harry fidgets with one of the throw pillows from the couch, glad that Draco can’t see him at this moment.
“Let’s go back to that Muggle cafe with the French onion soup you like so much. I don’t feel like being papped today.”
Reaching under his belly, Harry gently eases Draco’s mouth away from his cock. “Love, I’ll cum if you keep that up, and I’d rather do that when you’re inside me.”
Since the sex in front of the mirror, both Harry and Draco had been nearly insatiable. Any time Harry has been comfortably enough, they’ve been finding every position a heavily pregnant man can be in for penetration.
“Harry.” Draco’s voice is thick with emotion. “I knew, before we started dating, what being with you would entail. We were in the papers for just being out in public as friends. I know they’ll drag up our pasts. I know they’ll be cruel. But I knew all this before I asked you on our first date. You were worth it then, and you are worth it now. I love you. We’ll get through it together.”
have lunch plans, but his dinner plans include laying on the couch in his joggers eating a sandwich; he just has no desire to spend any more time with Claire than he already does at work.
They slowly drift back to earth and Harry gently pushes Draco’s head from the crook of his neck to kiss him softly.
“The situation certainly seems to warrant it.” Her trained eye looks Harry over. “Can you tell me what happened?”
“You do have to understand that neither of these methods is perfect.” Draco is emphatic. “You still run the risk of getting pregnant if you’re having penetrative sex.”
The stairs are an impossibility and he labours in the living room, kneeling and squatting against the couch in turn. He’s quite relieved when Healer Carr comes again and checks his progress.
They’re much later getting ready to head out than Harry had anticipated, but the languorous sex in the shower had been well worth it. Draco had pinned Harry’s arms above his head under the shower stream with one hand, worked him open with the other, and slid deep inside him before pounding against his prostate until he came untouched. After their first time on Thursday, they’ve been nearly insatiable and Harry is enjoying being properly fucked thoroughly and often.
“Don’t you dare make me cum until you’re inside me.” He clenches softly around Draco’s finger. “More, Draco.”
Several minutes pass as Harry tries to figure out how to put this into words that don’t feel ridiculous. He startles as his mobile begins vibrating with an incoming call.
“I know, son, but it’s important that you truly understand. And especially if you’re thinking about going further, it’s important that you remember that if either of you
“I want to prevent someone from going through what we had to experience. It’s going to be a long development process, but it will be worth it in the end.”
Draco’s eyes have turned bright with what Harry suspects is unshed tears. Harry places his free hand over the top of Draco’s hand. “I know. You couldn’t have known. It just kind of hit me like a bludger when I put it all together.” Harry is torn between being angry at Voldemort and his endless cruelty and wanting to forge ahead and make sure no one else suffers the same fate as Ginny.
“I did.” Draco wraps an arm around Harry’s waist and leads him to the rail as the Eye continues its upward journey. Harry snuggles in as Draco begins pointing out familiar places as they ascend.
His vision goes black at the edges and the middle bursts with white stars. This contraction is more torturous than the rest. Harry arches his back and pushes. He pushes for Draco, the man who has loved him so fully; for Regulus, the product of that love; and for himself, to meet this child who is the blend of himself and his husband.
“No, not since Astoria,” Harry says, shaking his head. “And they didn’t really date. It was an arranged marriage for an heir, not a romantic situation.”
“I’m pretty familiar now. Dad gave me several of the books Aunt Hermione got him to read when he first found out he was pregnant.”
Harry closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. There are retorts on the tip of his tongue, but he can’t bring himself to pick the fight. “I want to argue with you so badly, but I know you’re right.”
“If something happens, I will take care of the kids. I promise.” Draco’s voice holds no room for doubt and Harry clings to that reassurance.
have a lot of Gryffindors. Lions…so Leo?” Harry doesn’t particularly like that one, but it’s certainly better than his family names.
Harry scratches the Floo address and Apparition coordinates for Potter Cottage at the bottom, as well as the wording needed to allow Draco through the Fidelius Charm. He rolls up the parchment, seals it with a gentle spell, and sends Pyxis off with the reply. Resting his forehead against the cool glass of the now-closed window, he can’t decide if dinner with Draco is a brilliant idea or a terrifying one.
Apparently sensing his unease, Draco leans down to whisper in his ear as the charms wash over him and the Healer’s fingers slide in.
“Yes, love?” Draco pokes a finger gently into Harry’s belly again and Regulus kicks back. This is their father and son game, and it never fails to delight both daddies when their son responds.
“All right, let’s see what we have here.” Healer Carr begins casting over Harry, watching intently as spells provide numbers and change colours. Several of the spells are uncomfortable and Harry squeezes Draco’s hand as they run through him.
“I’m ready to be happy again. To share my life with someone. Maybe even to be loved by someone again.” Harry watches Hermione’s eyes spill over, and one lone tear rolls down each cheek. “And since I think Draco might be that someone, I really don’t want to fuck this up.”
Harry unties the parchment from Cupcake’s leg, retrieves some owl treats, and makes sure there’s water in the bowl by the perch. Sliding his empty dinner plate aside, Harry unfurls the parchment to see Lily’s favourite glitter ink scrawled across the page.
Draco’s tongue is replaced with fingers as he carefully stretches Harry open. Hips press back, desperate for more, deeper, faster and the groan at finding himself suddenly empty is involuntary.
“I’m incredibly relieved to have Harry back safely, but I will feel much better when I see for myself that our little one is okay, too.”
Harry groans, his own cock hardening further just knowing he’s about to give Draco his very first blow job. “Tell me what feels good, and tell me if anything doesn’t, yeah?”
“I’d appreciate that,” Draco says, reaching into the bowl and turning his attention to the telly. Harry lazily waves a hand and dims the lights as Simon begins narrating the opening scene.
Harry stumbles as he steps through to Minerva’s office. Thankfully, Draco knows the Floo is becoming even more difficult and is there to catch him.
“You’re amazing, Harry. You’re birthing our son. Regulus is almost here. I’ve never been more in love with you than I am in this very moment.”
Harry laughs. “Yeah. Let’s rinse off? I don’t really want to have this chat in the shower.” Harry takes in the uncertain look in Draco’s face.
Hands guide his calves back into the air and Draco sits reclined in the bed behind him, Harry lying on his chest.
“That’s wonderful. The next thing I’d like to check is to see if your magic is properly forming a birth canal. Are you familiar with male childbirth?”
“Then James, nothing that happened is your fault.” Draco is choosing his words carefully, Harry can tell, and he wonders how personal this is about to get. “Matthew is no more or less gay because you’ve had sex. And if his parents are bigoted against people who are gay, it wouldn’t have mattered when or how or why he came out. Their reaction would have been the same.”
A few minutes later, Draco’s hand is on his lower back as he holds open the lab door for Harry on their way out. Harry’s gotten used to Draco’s casual touches, though they still send delighted shivers up his spine, and finds them much more welcome than Claire’s will ever be. They’ve gone to lunch almost every day since Harry started working at CRMM, and they’ve spent several evenings together, as well. Unfortunately, he still doesn’t know if Draco’s actually interested in him, though Harry has been trying to flirt back more.
They’ve spent the last five days with the CRMM team and the St Mungo’s staff, putting together a plan to try to remove the malevolent magic from Harry’s core without harming him or the baby. There have been many hours in the simulation lab running through the procedure. Tomorrow — well, later this morning — they’re set to perform the procedure on Harry.
“Yes, you can clearly see that’s my style,” Harry says, rolling his eyes. “I want something we both like that fits our needs. Beyond that, I don’t have a lot of preference.”
Checking the mirror again, he decides it was worth it. His eyes look bright green next to his caramel skin, brought out by the jumper he’s put on. As a bonus, it detracts from the fact that his hair always looks like a bit of a rat’s nest. He pats his pockets.
“We’ve got a bit before midnight. Shall we watch a movie or play some games?” Draco speaks up from beside him.
But everything else about these three weeks with all four kids home has been wonderful. There have been squabbles, but overall, the blending of their two families had gone remarkably well. Christmas was exactly as Harry prefers it: loud and full of love and laughter. The children had all gone together and gotten their dads matching plush bathrobes. Scorpius and Lily had both been over the moon to get the mobiles Harry and Draco had picked out, Al and James were thrilled with their new brooms, and Harry was just happy to have them all together.
James nods and climbs off the bed, books in hand. As soon as the door shuts behind him, Draco and Harry both sag.
“Wow!” She’s never spent much time around a pregnant person, so Harry supposes she’s probably fascinated. He certainly was when Ginny was expecting James. Harry looks to his oldest son, who is staring into space and not eating the food in front of him.
“We can at least make sure Matthew has some support if it goes poorly,” Harry says firmly. “He won’t be left alone like you were.”
“Oh, that’s their Hogwarts Houses. Black means they went elsewhere, but otherwise, colours correspond to their sorted House.”
Hermione turns her hand to grip Harry’s and squeeze it lightly. “I’d like that a lot. I’ve always hoped he’d come around.”
“Well, it shouldn’t last long, at least.” Draco rolls his eyes. “After this weekend, there’s only two weeks before the kids come home. And I’m sure you and I will make a
“I’ll make sure you have more of both before you go back. Do you need anything else for the bedroom?”
“Yes. Yes. Just like that. Godric, this feels amazing.” Harry’s voice is low and gravelly. He presses his arse back to meet the slow strokes.
“Perhaps I’ll join you.” Draco’s lips press a kiss into Harry’s hair. “One of the benefits of working from home.”
“Middle name, though, I think,” Draco muses. “It’s not really able to be turned into anything that is more typical.”
The kids all clamour for a seat and Draco helps Harry out of his coat before pulling out his chair for him. Harry kisses his cheek in thanks before sitting, shaking his head at the gasps he’s hearing around the spacious dining room. Draco slides into the seat next to him.
“Romantically?” Draco sounds almost hopeful, but Harry can’t decide if that’s what he wants to hear or if that’s what Draco is really conveying.
Harry can’t decide if he’s exceptionally nauseous Friday because of the baby or because he’s nervous about telling the kids that, after nearly twelve years, they’re getting a sibling. Regardless of the source of his stomach’s unease, Draco is taking his own anxiety out by hovering and inquiring constantly about Harry’s well-being. It’s about to drive him completely spare at this point, so he’s sent Draco to the pantry to hunt the pasta just to give him something to do. He sets aside the ingredients he’s been preparing for dinner.
“That sounds great. Would you hand me my mobile first, though? I’m going to text Hermione and ask if she can up the ante on her book and DVD game for the next several weeks. I’m going to lose my mind if she doesn’t.”
“Yeah, sorry. I’m still in here.” Harry reaches for the shampoo so he can finish up and join Draco for dinner.
“Not in as many words. But basically, yes.” Harry rolls his eyes. Lily, as always, had not been shy in telling Harry exactly what she thought about the baby situation. She’s extremely excited to be a big sister, but she had no qualms in telling Harry she wanted it to be a boy because she liked being the only girl.
Hermione’s laugh fills the room. “Of course.” She stoops to hug Harry briefly. “I told Draco they’re sure to come up with something sordid.”
“Oh?” Harry’s heart lifts at the news. This project has been particularly important to him, and he’s so pleased that they’re making progress.
“Ok.” Draco helps Harry to sit up and tip the potion into his mouth. He swallows and immediately gags.
Draco divests himself of his own clothing, and they slip into the shower. Harry can’t help but moan at the warm spray down his back.
And when it finally does, he squints into the bright lights that assault his regained vision until a figure obstructs the light. Draco. That platinum blond couldn’t belong to anyone else.
Draco is pulling out vegetables for the salad and Harry is lighting the hob to boil water when footsteps come timidly down the stairs.
Harry smiles to himself. He’s nervous, too, even though he knows he wants this. He’s rapidly falling in love with Draco and as much as that scares him, it also thrills him, and he’s ready for this next step.
“I was going to say the same thing. Worrying is one thing, but Al is miserable because that’s all he can do.”
Harry shifts back, easing the soft black fabric off Draco’s feet. He nudges Draco's knees apart, running his hands over the muscled legs from ankles to hips and settling himself on his forearms between them. Looking up into Draco's face, he sees swirling silver eyes that are lust-blown, staring back at him intently, pink lips slightly parted.
And Lily is chattering away to Draco, telling him all about her visit to Mina’s house the day before. She’s endlessly fascinated by the way Muggles live with no magic in the house at all, and she’s explaining it all to Draco at high speed, hands gesticulating just as rapidly. She’s preening under Draco’s attention, so proud of her first visit to a Muggle home.
“I could say the same. I didn’t know how unhappy I was until you reminded me what true happiness feels like.”
Bursting out laughing, Harry puts a hand to the small of Draco’s back and gently propels him forward. “What can I say? Gin and I both loved Quidditch and when we built this house, I still couldn’t set foot
The back door swings open and five grinning, laughing kids burst in. Harry can’t help but smile along with them.
“Oh, surely you’ve read the unauthorised tell-alls that came out after the war,” Harry says with mild disdain. “They even had pictures.”
“Well, I think you should get married soon.” Lily's authoritative air means she clearly finds this to be important.
“Do you feel better now?” There’s an easiness to Draco’s voice now that Harry hadn’t realised was missing before.
Harry nearly bursts with pride. He has always told his children they have lived a privileged upbringing despite losing their mother. James seems to recognise that and has a desire to make a difference. For all he tries to hide it, he has a very sensitive soul.
Slow, slick, and maddening, Draco’s finger slides in deeper, exploring his insides, and as the finger crooks, Harry cries out.
“No better, then,” Draco sighs, disappears into the loo, and returns to perch on the bed next to Harry. There’s a
“I love you, too,” Harry replies without looking away from Regulus. He’s both of them, and it’s amazing. Strawberry blond wisps of hair look like they may end up being Harry’s curls and he has Harry's mouth, but he has Draco’s nose and chin. And only time will tell what colour his eyes will be.
. He’s perfect. He’s absolutely perfect.” Draco is awestruck. “Harry. You made him, grew him in your body. I love you so much.”
Harry can’t hide his grin as warmth spreads through his belly. It’s so nice to be out and about with Draco, proudly in a relationship with him, even if it’s not really their bodies. He can’t wait for all four kids to arrive home from Hogwarts so they can stop hiding away.
“You get used to it.” Harry shrugs but doesn’t leave Draco’s embrace. He glances out the window. “Well, fuck. It’s about to get worse. There they are.”
Draco kisses Harry’s cheek, hugs James, and Apparates away. Harry knows when the doorbell rings over the phone less than ten seconds later that Draco didn’t use an approved Apparition point. He must have Apparated directly onto Matthew’s front stoop.
Hermione squeezes him in return. “I’ll save you whenever necessary.” She pulls away and looks Harry over. “What, exactly, am I saving you from today?”
Draco panted, his entire body arching further and further off the couch with every thrust of Harry's tongue. Harry noticed that even though Draco was very much enjoying having his ear tongue-fucked, he didn't seem very disposed to making much noise. He'd always assumed that Draco would be as loud during sex as he was at any other time... Not that he'd thought about it. But, he decided, the small, almost desperately restrained sounds that Draco did make were incredibly hot all the same.
"Well- yes, sort of," she said. "I know you have a crush on me. Have done for years. Maybe you influenced the Goblet in some way."
"Ah, yes," Dumbledore smiled grimly. "My home away from home these long six months. Before then I'd been tracking Voldemort across the entire U.K. There were many reports, of course, but only a handful of them sounded promising. Due to Voldemort's terrible cleverness, however, those that were genuine were sketchy at best, and morsels of real information were difficult to pick out amongst the gossip. When I found him at last in early spring, I had to be careful to disguise my presence. The cloak helped."
"What? So we're boyfriends, now?" Draco interrupted. His voice was high, and his cheeks were beginning to tinge pink. "I'm supposed to give up my future because I've snogged the Boy Who Lived a few times?"
Malfoy's expression flashed from uncertain to angry, and his voice was quietly furious when he spoke. "You seemed to be enjoying it up until now."
Draco groaned unevenly, the fingers of his right hand twitching in Harry's grip. He seemed torn, his ego and the demands of his body at war. When Harry began to pull his hand away, however, Malfoy quickly snatched it up with his free hand and shoved it unceremoniously down his pants.
"No, I'm not." Harry growled between clenched teeth, ending the discussion by going back to work on his essay.
Harry squeezed the cock pressing into his palm, sliding his hand up and over the head, smearing the wetness there down the shaft. Draco's face averted from him, hiding his flush of shame as he allowed Harry to pull him off with slow, tight strokes. Harry revelled in the way that Draco's hips jerked into his hand, seeking a faster rhythm that Harry wasn't ready to provide just yet. Draco whined and reached down to grip Harry's wrist, attempting to force his hand to move faster along his cock. Harry stopped entirely.
Just then she looked up and saw him, still smiling brightly at something Parvati had said. She stopped, the smile slipping from her face instantly. Parvati gave her a worried look, placing a hand on her arm.
"My point is, Harry, that forcing you to have sex when you don't want to is rape." Hermione continued doggedly. "We'll go to McGonagall right now and get this straightened out."
"Wait a second," he began. "You still haven't answered my question. Why did you say earlier that you don't know whether or not you hate me?"
Lavender waved a hand imperiously, dismissing his humbleness. "Those other remedies either don't work very well, or don't work at all. And the charms are either too difficult or leave side effects of their own. This sounds like it might actually work."
Pulling on his sensitive flesh rapidly, Draco silently berated himself. He'd been so close to having someone other than himself touch his dick for the first time. Even if it had been Potter... Potter's hand... almost touching... almost... Oh!
"Me first, Scarhead!" Draco shoved in front of Harry and stood in front of Professor Mason, arms crossed over his chest as he stared at her angrily. "I demand a partner change."
"Today marks the beginning of our transition from theory to practice of the material. You've probably noticed that the room is a bit different today..."
"Snob," Harry retorted, turning Malfoy's hand over in his and running his fingers over the perfectly smooth palm. "You've never done a day's work in your life, have you?"
Harry heard people shifting closer together all around him and wiggled uncomfortably, settling himself more fully on his hands. He could feel eyes on the back of his head. When the silence seemed to stretch unbearably, he looked up at Mason.
The boys rose from their seats, glaring daggers at one another as they walked by her. Looking up toward the heavens, Rosemary Mason heaved a great sigh. "Well, that appears to have been productive."
Harry stopped, feeling frustrated and angry. Draco was staring at him with a pleading look on his face, silently asking Harry not to bring this thing between them here, out into the open, where it would be more real somehow. This wasn't class, nothing was expected of them, it wasn't okay to do this here.
Reaching hastily to undo his trousers, Harry drew out his neglected erection with a sigh of contentment. Pulling himself off in slow, lazy strokes, Harry wondered if Draco was doing the same right now. Concentrating on the wall, he tried to will a tiny hole into it, wanting to hear some indication of what the Slytherin was up to. However, no matter how hard he tried, he could not succeed in making so much as a dent in the barrier.
"Yes, ma'am," Harry mumbled, keeping his head down as he pulled back the curtain and stepped inside.
Harry paused, twirling the drumstick between his fingers, before asking a question of his own. "Have you had a lemon drop recently, Hermione?"
"Well, well, Potter," he drawled, twirling his wand lazily. "That'll be fifty points from Gryffindor, I think."
Nodding mutely, Harry followed him up the winding staircase to his office, which was as oddly quaint as always. Harry had to turn away when Dumbledore took a seat behind his desk, so out of place did the frail, gray old man look amidst the clicking, sighing shiny objects and colorful portraits around him. He might have been a pile of ash against the bright red leather of his chair.
Nodding feverently, Harry swallowed. It was quite a bit to take in all at once. "Yes," he said, meaning it. "I'll read it. I promise."
"Nothing!" she squeaked, her eyes wide with stunned disbelief. "Look, you just have to understand that I'm upset."
Harry ignored him and unbuttoned his fly, and was reaching for the zip when Draco's hand settled over his. He looked up in surprise, and found Draco leaning over him, his face pinched into a look of seriousness.
It was interesting to watch the war waging between Malfoy's pride and the potion in his system. When, predictably, the Veritaserum won out, the Slytherin released a breath and turned his face away from Harry before answering.
"Please, Potter, just leave it?" Draco winced, pressing his fingers to his eyes dejectedly. Ensuring that Harry couldn't probe further, he quickly asked, "Do you think we can do this? The whole Sex Magic thing?"
"It's silly," he said dismissively. "It'll just end up in the growing pile of my ideas that Sprout tosses out."
"Regardless of how it turns out, Rosemary, we still forced a young man into a sexual situation against his will," McGonagall snapped. "Albus, Merlin knows I trust you, but I very nearly couldn't do it. I felt ill!"
Professor Mason's cool voice filtered through the thick, hazy fog of Harry's consciousness. Flinging his head back, he craned his neck up to look at the professor, who stood with arms crossed above the two of them.
"Sex Magic was brought to Hogwarts by Lerner the Lecherous in the late 1940's," Professor Mason explained. "Some have speculated that if Armando Dippet, being rather feeble-minded, had not been Headmaster at the time, the subject never would have been introduced. The curriculum focuses mainly on the magic created and sustained during the act of sexual intercourse. Such a meeting of two magical people with their mingled abilities - not to mention other aspects which tend to become mingled during such activities - of both partners involved can create quite a bit of energy. With enough training, that energy can then be focused and funneled into other things. Under the right circumstances, with the right partner, the magical potential created can be amazingly powerful.
When Malfoy's mouth worked silently for a moment, and the blond's eyes strayed to where Harry held his wand with a look of desperation, Harry knew that he'd won. He took the final step closer that brought him chest to chest with the other boy.
Harry felt the beginnings of rage boil up underneath the shock of the situation and turned on him. "Your father won't do anything!" he screamed at Malfoy. "No one even knows where he's at! I know where he's supposed to be, though. In Azkaban, where all Death Eaters belong. You probably haven't even heard from him, have you? Unless I'm mistaken and your owls aren't being closely watched."
Malfoy was breaking their unwritten rule, and talking about the fantasies they shared in. He considered playing dumb but quickly dismissed the idea, realizing that it wouldn't last long, anyway, and he was better off just playing along so he could get Malfoy's hand on his cock sooner.
Darkened gray eyes stared up at him, and the look in them was something that Harry had never seen before. Hatred, amusement, mocking disdain... Those were looks that he was used to getting from Malfoy. This wild, intense look of hunger and anticipation was new, and exciting.
"Oh, I don't think so." Draco smirked. "You know, I've always wanted an Invisibility Cloak. I think I'll just take yours."
Harry and Draco immediately pulled their hands apart and wiped them on their trousers, sending one another suspicious glances before they gathered their things and left.
When the time came for the Gryffindors to make their way to their first classes, Harry walked a few steps behind Lavender, his eyes fastened on the corner of the glossy magazine sticking out of her bag. Glancing around to make sure he wouldn't be noticed, he whispered a quick, "Accio!" and the magazine flew smoothly into his hand.
His abdomen tightened as a spark of pleasure seared down his spine. He wrenched away from the kiss with an audible smacking sound, gasping in air as he rocked steadily against the warm body under him. Malfoy arched up rhythmically, making small, soft noises as he panted. The sound made Harry growl animalistically, and he buried his face in the crook of the blond's neck and shoulder and marked him with his teeth.
"Great, after I got her to stop crying." Neville answered flatly, and Harry burst out laughing. Neville joined him after a moment and the two of them laughed together until their eyes watered. Harry shook his head and wiped away the moisture on his lashes.
Draco turned to give him a look of extreme resentment. The muscles in his jaw twitched a bit as he clenched it tightly, but Harry knew that he had to answer whether he wanted to or not.
Harry nodded, his jaw still tight with anger. The professor left and he sagged, disbelief and horror settling over him. He returned to his seat to collect his things and remembered with sudden clarity his wish for a distraction this year at Hogwarts. He snorted nervously to the empty room. Shagging someone he hated, and more importantly, a boy, would definitely prove to be distracting.
"So, Potter," Malfoy drawled, wrapping the fabric of Harry's cloak around the fingers of his left hand. He tucked Harry's wand into the side of his trousers, while keeping his own wand trained on Harry himself. "Out after hours? And caught with a forbidden magical object, no less. Perhaps I should inform Mr. Filch?"
Groaning inwardly, Harry hastily laced his fingers with Malfoy's. The other boy's hand remained limp in his own and when Harry chanced a look in his direction, he saw Malfoy was pink-cheeked. Harry found his embarrassment to be oddly somewhat rewarding, and squeezed his hand for good measure. With a shocked gasp, Malfoy jerked his head around to glare accusingly at Harry.
"I agree, Albus. Young Malfoy is an average student, with no exceptional magical qualities. I don't see what he could possibly bring to our side that is worth all of this."
"Why?" Mason asked, looking genuinely confused. "The boy isn't dim or untalented, but I have yet to see anything truly spectacular from him."
Harry let his eyes fall shut as Draco's hand began to slip up and down. He settled deeper into the cushion and pushed his hips up in demand. Draco acquiesced, tugging the waistband of Harry's pants down over his hips and sliding his hand inside.
Harry stared at Dumbledore, stubbornly refusing to listen to the weakness in his knees suggesting that he sit down. Refusing to entertain the image that wanted to make itself known, of Ron and Hermione, bloody and unmoving, with Harry standing above them, wand hanging limp and useless in his fingers.
Neither boy realized how intense things had become until Harry was pushing Malfoy onto his back. Malfoy fell back without hesitation at first, but tensed when he realized what was happening. Harry felt hands on his shoulders, resisting weakly, so he settled his weight more fully into the cradle of Draco's hips beneath him.
Malfoy drew himself up on his elbows as Harry settled back onto his side of the sofa. A heavy silence hung between the two of them as they straightened their robes and stood. Harry glanced in Malfoy's direction, and Draco looked away quickly.
Out of sheer restlessness, and to escape Neville's curiosity, Harry decided to pay the Headmaster's office a visit that night. After whispering the password and beginning to climb the narrow, winding steps, he thought he heard voices coming from the top of the stair. He took the next few steps as quietly as he could and pressed his back against the wall near the door hinges.
Harry's victorious smile was more of a possessive snarl as he leaned forward and muttered against Draco's lips, "Then don't ever pretend that you don't want this again."
Harry followed, going over in his mind every possible scenario he'd imagined for today. Malfoy resentfully giving him a handjob while Harry grinned smugly at him... Himself giving Malfoy another handjob while the other boy gasped and pleaded...
Harry glanced at his schedule and then back at the door in front of him. According to the paper the location of the classroom for Sex Magic hadn't changed since the last time he checked. Sighing, he tucked the scroll back into his pocket and stepped through the door to the Room of Requirement. Inside his worst fears were proven true for a brief moment and he choked, halting midstep in the doorway. Terribly tacky and distasteful paintings groaned as they moved in lurid ways. Kinky, complicated objects lined the walls, and one wall in particular looked rather painful. After a moment, however, the garish images swirled and reformed into a perfectly ordinary classroom. Harry let out a sigh of relief and heard someone giggle off to his side.
Malfoy sat tensely on the sofa, his knees pressed primly together and wringing his hands. He jumped when Harry entered, his face flickering through a myriad of swiftly concealed emotions. Harry ignored him and made his way over to the opposite end of the couch, slumping down onto it in a haphazard arrangement of limbs. Removing his glasses, he set them on the low table nearby and threw an arm over his eyes.
Harry chuckled an unthinkingly ran a hand up and down Draco's ankle in a casual caress. Draco sobered immediately, drawing his leg away to swing into a sitting position on the sofa. Harry knew a moment of disappointment before it was forcibly squashed.
Lavender squeaked indignantly. Neville hung his flushed head and gathered his things to sit next to an obviously displeased Lavender. Harry imagined one of the other girls in class reacting similarly when their names were called together and felt his ears burn.
Something in her tone put an end to Malfoy's infuriated tantrum and he swallowed and nodded, gathering his books with halting, jerky movements before he slumped into the chair next to Harry and immediately scooted as far away as the table allowed. Harry sat down slowly, staring at his white-knuckled hands on the table in shock.
Malfoy sat, arms tucked tightly across his chest, legs crossed and one foot tapping against the leg of his chair. He glared heatedly back at Harry, somehow cluing into the point of the Muggle game, and refused to break eye contact.
"Er," Ron paused, glancing back down at the notes nervously. "Neville said that you all had to kiss your partners in Sex Magic yesterday..."
Hermione stared at him perplexedly for several moments before her mouth fell open in a small circle of surprise.
"Arithmancy is such a fascinating subject!" Hermione enthused from behind a textbook so large that hid her entire upper body. "Professor Vector has promised us that this year we'll begin to study how the proper runes, with the aid of an invocation, can work together without the use of a wand to create the illusion of wandless magic..."
"Catching students out of bed, what does it look like?" Malfoy asked, as though the answer should be obvious.
"Quiet, Mr. Potter." Professor Mason admonished. Behind Harry, Malfoy snickered. "The partners that you are paired with during this course will likely become, at the very least, extremely dear to you for the rest your life. Most people find that they meet their future spouses here in this very room, as the selection method that we use chooses your partner based on a number of compatible elements, both personal and sexual. I'm sure you're all familiar with the object that we use to pair off students; the Goblet of Fire. The Goblet is a surpremely beneficial tool to this course, as it is both fair and unbiased on the criteria which it bases its selection, even though you might harbor such biases towards your fellow classmates yourself. Do not be surprised if you are partnered with someone you do not expect. The Goblet sometimes makes shocking, yet intuitive choices. When I call your names, please move to sit next to your partner."
To the casual observer, Ron Weasley, out on his nightly rounds of the fifth floor's deserted halls, would appear to be speaking to thin air. And if two sets of footsteps sounded in the quiet of the sleeping school, it could be put down to echoes within the drafty corridors.
"No, most definitely not." Draco snorted softly, and gave Harry a look. "But it is interesting to note your inventive wanking habits."
Harry felt the icy fist which had settled into the bottom of his stomach last night plunge even further into his gut at the mention of 'practical applications' of the material. Luckily those wouldn't begin for at least another week, which would afford him plenty of time to corner Ms. Mason and tell her about the huge mistake that had brought him into her classroom.
Without meaning to, Harry had blearily made his way to the seventh floor corridor. He ran his fingers along the stone wall, visibly swaying with exhaustion, and his fingertips encountered a familiar doorknob. Looking up, he saw the door to the Room of Requirement, already manifested. It was enough to startle him awake.
Harry watched as Malfoy nodded and left the room. The blond's shoulders weren't as straight as they usually were and his head was slightly bowed. Harry felt something indescribable tug at him at the display of obvious humiliation.
The three students in the room seemed to sag all together. The muscles in Harry's jaw flexed as he grit his teeth together. Hermione placed a hand on his shoulder and squeezed.
Harry stared at her blankly for a moment. "I don't understand. Why aren't you telling this to Malfoy too?"
Glancing with trepidation at the wall out of the corner of his eye, Draco slid a hand over his erection through the material of his trousers. His eyes closed and he sighed as he teased his fingers up and down his own length. Opening his eyes a crack, he gave the wall one last distrustful look before quickly undoing his trousers and sliding his underpants down his hips. Taking himself in his hand, he worked quickly, convinced that Harry would change his mind and make the wall go away any second. Silently, he willed it to remain up just a bit longer, just a bit...
Peering through the crack he saw McGonagall and Professor Mason sitting in front of the fire, seemingly deep in conversation. Another, deeper voice came from the direction of the fireplace, and Harry leaned to the left in order to see Dumbledore's flaming green head sitting in the hearth.
Tuesday evening found Harry poring over Charms notes from the past six years- Hermione's of course- in preparation for an impromptu practice NEWT exam the next day. Covering the pages with one hand and staring at the floor, Harry cursed freely and frequently as he attempted to recite the incantations from memory.
Well, well, she thought with a chuckle. It would seem that even when apart, the two of them were solely focused on each other. Giving the fading, crackling lightshow one last glance, she shook her head and turned to face the Longbottom/Brown booth, where a warm, orange-tinged pink aura gave off a swelling radiance.
They hit the floor in an ungraceful, tangled sprawl. Harry's nose was smashed against the floor, his hands still caught underneath Malfoy. Draco groaned and shifted, attempting to maneuver around Harry's knuckles pressed into the small of his back.
"I've never," he paused, desperately trying to come up with a less pathetic way of phrasing it and failing, "been held."
This turned out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, and Harry was swiftly rewarded with steely fingers clamping around his wrist and fingernails digging pincer-like into the soft skin above his pulse. When it was over, Harry pulled his hand away and wiped it on the sheets, examining the crescents left in his flesh with lazy interest.
"Misters Malfoy and Potter, we are once again waiting on the two of you," said Mason. "Please do not continue to hold up my class."
"We've been using this room since the subject was first brought to Hogwarts over fifty years ago. As our needs during the course of the class often change, it is convenient to have a room that adjusts to fit them. Now, if there are no complaints..."
"But it's past hours," Ron said half-heartedly. But Harry was already on his way up the stairs to their room to get his Invisibility Cloak.
"Come, come! You're in a Sex Magic class. If you can't handle a little hand-holding, then I dread how you'll feel about the rest of the assignments!" Professor Mason scolded them.
Harry tugged the front of his robes away from his body, his cheeks burning with embarrassment as he attempted to hide the evidence of just how advanced their assignment had gotten. Draco sat up and hugged his knees to his chest, staring toward the back of the booth miserably. His profile was to Harry, but his hair had fallen forward, curtaining any indication of what he was thinking.
Harry glanced at him but Ron just shrugged sheepishly and looked away. Faintly intrigued by the strange display, Harry tore the ribbon from the roll of parchment containing his Seventh Year schedule. Unrolling the crisp, yellowish paper, he scanned the line of familiar courses; Potions, Transfiguration, Charms, until he found a new addition to the list. His eyes bulged from behind their round, plastic frames and his mouth fell open in shock.
Harry hesitated, the wand in his face a tricky thing to maneuver around. Malfoy must've mistaken his silence, however, because in the next moment his smile turned into a look of disgust.
Harry's head snapped up suddenly and his eyes were hopeful. "Can you ask him for me? If I can drop the class, I mean?"
He'd been surprised at first, when the Room began to shift and melt around him; colors and textures fighting to manifest whatever vague fantasies danced around in his or Malfoy's head.
Snatching the parchment out of Harry's nerveless fingers, she quickly scanned the page, her eyes widening.
"You want me to treat you as an adult, and not a child. I think you have earned it, and so I shall give you honesty at its most complete and ugly." The Headmaster stared at his shriveled hands folded on the desktop. "War is coming. Many will die, and among their numbers will be those within these walls. Teachers, classmates, friends... Some of their deaths you will not be able to prevent, and some you will be responsible for."
Harry, still dazzled from the news, only nodded in response. Hermione, however, wasn't about to let the subject go, and rounded on him.
"No," Harry corrected. "I meant what are you doing here. In this tent. There was no magical energy above it. For all you knew, no one was in here."
Drawing a small vial out of her pocket, she unscrewed the cap and withdrew an eyedropper full of clear liquid. Tilting her head back, she carefully squeezed three drops onto her tongue before replacing the cap.
Sighing, she pulled the curtain back and snapped, "Mr. Potter, why did you jump away from Mr. Malfoy as though he were diseased last week? Discuss."
Draco made a muffled, 'mmph!' sound against Harry's mouth as he came. Harry continued to pump him slowly, until the last of the pulses died out and Draco slumped back against the wall bonelessly. Harry pulled his hand out of the front of Draco's trousers, taking his wand from his pocket and using it to spell his hand and then the inside of Malfoy's trousers clean. Draco mumbled something that could have been thanks, and reached for his wand in Harry's pajama pocket. Harry thought briefly about stopping him; envisioned himself catching Draco's hand and pulling him forward for a kiss. But instead, he simply let the other boy pluck his wand from his pocket and took a few steps back, giving Draco space.
Harry, on the other hand, felt Mason's presence like a shock of cold water. He clambered off of Malfoy, feeling uncomfortably hot and sweaty, and immensely dissatisfied.
Lavender let out a sob and threw herself down onto the duvet, balling the red material in her fists. Hermione's lip curled. So that's why Neville had been so upset at dinner.
Everyone moved forward in one rush, taking their partner's hand and pointing to favorable places on the floor; except for Harry and Draco.
It was now Monday, and Harry lay on his side next to Draco, fisting his cock roughly and licking figure eights around the shell of his ear. He nearly yelped when Goyle's voice filtered through a suddenly green-canopied bed.
Draco stood and walked over to one of the armchairs, fastening his fly and shooting a glare over his shoulder at Harry as he went.
Harry dug his heels into Slytherin sheets and came onto his stomach, letting out a harsh sigh of release. Draco's hand slid down to his balls, rubbing them lightly, and Harry made a small noise of protest and pulled away, the touch too much for his sensitive nerve endings.
Draco did as asked, arching his back up off of the floor so that Harry could slide his hands out from underneath him. Harry pushed himself into a more comfortable position, turning his head so that his cheek lay against the cool floor.
He heard Dumbledore take a deep breath and winced, not knowing if he was prepared to hear the sound of his sickly voice again- or what it would say.
Malfoy suddenly tore his mouth away from Harry's and latched it onto the side of his neck. Harry cried out in surprise at the feeling of something hot and slick pressed into his throat. If Malfoy lacked in finesse, Harry didn't mind. The Slytherin's mouth moved sloppily and without any pattern. He licked the line of Harry's collarbone, dipping into the hollow there and sucking hard. Harry moaned, fingers clawing at the ground on either side of Draco's head. Draco grinned against his shoulder and repeated the gesture in various spots all over Harry's neck, seeing which ones produced the strongest reactions. Harry endured it as long as he could before fisting a hand in Malfoy's hair and jerking his head away from his thoroughly laved neck.
Harry continued to glare as he sat up and pushed himself off the sofa. He couldn't explain the sudden flare of angry hurt, but it made his stomach burn nonetheless.
"What would happen if both wanted to be dominant? Or submissive? Wouldn't that create problems?" she asked.
Several people in the Gryffindor common room jumped and turned around, seeking out the cause of the disruption. A few people close by gave him confused, yet slightly interested glances.
"Maybe so," he admitted, and watched her mouth drop open. She'd expected denial. "But either way, short of reaching into that goblet and tying our names together myself, I can't be expected to take the blame any more than you can. Ignoring me is not going to make it go away, and neither is having a crying fit during our lessons together. Have I told you that I'm not fond of that?"
"The Goblet of Fire cannot be fooled, Ms. Granger. If Potter had been truly adverse to participating in the class, his name would not have been accepted. Regardless, the point is moot. The Goblet creates a binding, magical contract. Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy are legally bound to one another to complete the course together."
"Today I want to talk about the actual magical part of this class," the Professor began. "The theory of Sex Magic was brought about by Lerner Cunningham, affectionately nicknamed Lerner the Lecherous, in the mid 1930's. He observed the increased amount of wandless magic that appeared to happen when he and his wife were intimate, such as glasses shattering, furniture rattling or candle flames extinguishing. Based on this, he theorized that when a magical person is involved in sexual activity they are not in complete control of their magic. When that person's partner is also a witch or wizard, the combined magical energy between them is quite powerful, but unfocused. He thought that if their magic could be brought under control, using their increasing pleasure as sort of a catalyst for the strength of the magic to grow as they reach climax, great things could be accomplished."
Harry stumbled back a few steps and looked up to see Draco Malfoy standing a few feet in front of him, dazed and rubbing his rapidly swelling nose. He raised his wand and waved it about defensively, his eyes suspicious and a little scared.
"Look, Harry," she began, her tone serious. "You're a seventeen-year-old boy. Any... physical intimacy is bound to be pleasurable for you. It doesn't have to mean anything. It doesn't say anything about you."
"I wouldn't laugh, Mr. Malfoy," she began. "The lightning storms dancing above your and Mr. Potter's booth for the last two weeks have come alarmingly close to setting the woodwork on fire."
He had Harry's attention, and he turned to face Draco on the couch. Draco looked back at him with a faint flush on his cheeks, but his eyes level and direct.
"I'm afraid Harry will have to complete the course," Deputy and currently acting Headmistress Minerva McGonagall told the trio that stood in front of her desk.
And like that, concepts like 'want' and 'choice' were thrown like a gauntlet, and Draco reacted accordingly.
"Cockroach Cluster!" Harry shouted at the impassive face of the stone gargoyle. Tearing off his cloak when it did not move, thinking absurdly that somehow it had prevented his voice from carrying, he shouted again, "Cockroach Cluster!"
He had thought that this year would provide a nice, mundane distraction. Now, however, with only a single kiss as experience he was being thrust into a highly powerful and sexual form of magic. He was expected to practice magic based on sexual experience he didn't even have.
From the look on Harry's face, it was obvious that he'd completely forgotten about that. Neville quickly tried to backtrack. "I'm sorry, I wasn't implying... I mean, I know you're not-"
"Rosemary, I tried to get in touch with you earlier, but you were unavailable," she said briskly. "The staff meeting has been moved."
Harry broke away and Malfoy's hand tightened around his nape, trying to tug him forward again. Harry shook his head.
Hauling back the flap to their booth, he stalked away from the Slytherin without looking back to see his look of self-loathing regret.
"Mr. Potter!" Professor Mason boomed over whatever obscenity a white-faced Draco had shouted at him. "That's quite enough. Mr. Malfoy, dinner. Now."
'This must be what Professor Mason sees,' Harry thought, awe-struck. Looking around, Harry attempted to remember which booths belonged to which couple. There was Theodore Nott and Padma Patil's booth, with a gentle, rippling pool of blue and green swirls. Goyle and Parkinson's booth had a violent pink glare above it, and Harry winced and turned away with a grimace of distaste. And there was...
Draco groaned and buried face in his hands. Harry felt embarrassed for him, but he was enjoying this immensely nonetheless.
Rosemary Mason was lazily observing the swirling blue-green clouds above Padma Patil and Theodore Nott's booth when she heard the sound of hot, electric snapping from behind her left shoulder. Whirling around she saw what was essentially a heat lightning storm above the Potter/Malfoy booth.
"No, Ron." Harry shook his head and the air rippled with the shifting fabric. "I've got to figure this out on my own."
"You're not... I mean, the Goblet obviously made a mistake when it teamed you up with Malfoy, right? Because you're not, y'know..."
"You've run this little freak show up until now, and until now I've let you because I didn't want to participate," he began cooly. "If I did, then it would say something about me that isn't what I'd like or even entirely true. I don't like boys."
Harry felt himself go stiff, suddenly unsure. He'd been so focused on winning over Draco up until this point that he'd forgotten about his own apprehension regarding his virginity. Forcing himself to relax, he let his hand slip from Draco's nape onto the edge of the sofa.
"Yes. I mean, you were. Warm, that is," Harry said lamely, and felt the rest of it coming before he could stop it. "And you smelled good. And I just wasn't comfortable that it was youpressed up against me. It was weird, and sort of scary."
There were two choices that he could see. He could decline, and continue in his seduction efforts, which may or may not prove to be successful. Or he could agree to Malfoy's terms and try his damndest to win the Slytherin over to their side in the short months they had left.
"Now, I want you to explore one another's hands," she announced suddenly. "I know how silly that sounds, but a large part of this course will be establishing a level of physical familiarity and comfort with your partner. I want you to get to know every facet of them, and they you. Play with their fingers, their palms and wrists... Just allow yourselves to explore. Once fifteen minutes have passed, you are free to leave."
"Mr. Longbottom, would you care to explain why a ball of pink energy just flew from your tent and straight through the side of Mr. Goyle and Ms. Parkinson's?" she raged.
McGonagall didn't answer and her eyes slid to the side, silently indicating the two boys nearby. Nodding her understanding, Mason stood and motioned the Transfigurations professor to one of the booths. A marvelous insight on her part to have made the curtains soundproof.
"You, however, I think I can trust to remain coolheaded enough not to lash out at your partner due to past grievances. I don't believe that you will harm Mr. Malfoy, intentionally or otherwise. Am I right, Harry? Can I trust you?"
Harry swallowed and nodded, walking out of her office and on toward the Great Hall with a feeling of numb detachment.  He was going to have to shag Malfoy. Repeatedly.
"I'll see you in class tomorrow, Potter." Draco mumbled, looking at the floor the entire time, before he pushed the flap back and was gone.
Harry breathed deeply with his eyes closed for several minutes. Unlike Draco the night before, he felt like relishing his first other-person-induced orgasm. When he forced his heavy eyelids open at last, Draco was staring down at him with painful expectation. Harry realized that he was waiting for a reaction. Well... for a secondary reaction, anyway.
Harry sat up, favoring her with a sour look. "I suggested that to begin with and you told me that it wouldn't work."
Lavender Brown colored, shooting her best friend a challenging look over her copy of Witch Weekly, before continuing to read.
When he turned to give her his best disapproving glare, however, she'd moved on, and Neville was looking at him strangely.
Harry didn't need to see Draco to know that he had remained just as firmly rooted to his spot as himself. He avoided looking directly at Professor Mason, prolonging the moment until she would force him to participate. He groaned when he heard her call their names.
Draco took a tentative grip at the base of Harry's cock and began to pump it cautiously. Harry cracked an eye open to see Draco staring down at him intently, watching for a reaction. He cleared his throat and said hoarsely, "Faster."
"I gave them one of the letters Harry had written me this summer. They said that they needed his signature. I asked them what for, but they only said not to worry, that they were going to help Harry get a girlfriend. I never thought they'd go this far, though!"
Professor Mason sighed, turning around to face them with an expression of irritated patience that only professors could manage. "Boys, I've already told you there is nothing to be done for it."
Harry snarled. "Even under Vertitaserum, you're still just a snotty, spoiled little boy who can only feel good about himself by making other people feel horrible."
"I am Professor Mason, and I will be your Sex Magic instructor. The class consists of one semester of classroom work and another of independent study, at the end of which you will complete and submit your final projects for my approval. I'm sure many of you are surprised by the briefness of the classroom component, given its content, but this is not a subject that requires much study. It is unique to each person, and therefore lengthy discussions of the theory behind it when they may or may not apply to you are frivolous. Much of the class will be spent in practical applications of the concepts you'll learn in the first few sessions."
Harry glared at her and took a seat three over, next to Neville, who looked even more terrified than he felt. "What are you doing here?" Harry asked him in a hushed tone.
"To be fair, we both thought that Mason would sign for you," Ron told him. "Hermione's right, though. They can't exactly force you to shag that git."
Harry let out a wail of rage and the tables bounced even more heavily against the flagstones, the sound almost deafening.
"Well, yes, but that was different. That class was purely elective, and I had more than enough classes to fulfill my requirement. But Sex Magic isn't even technically on the roster. You require the professor to sign a form in order to add or drop the class." Hermione explained.
Harry stared at the other boy in mute shock for several seconds before voicing his thoughts. "You insulted my friends, made fun of my parents, and tried to get me expelled or possibly even killed because I hurt your feelings when we were eleven?"
"Because he's not a bad bloke!" said Lavender defensively. "He's not like other boys. Neville Longbottom is a gentleman."
In the end, he decided that rocking Malfoy's tiny, pureblooded world would be much simpler with his cooperation.
"She can't do this!" Hermione told a stoic Harry, who was laying on his bed and apparently quite happy to stare at absolutely nothing. "Look, I don't care if she does use the Goblet of Fire to choose names, you didn't put yours in!"
Harry groaned. He did not want to talk to anyone at the moment, most especially not anyone associated with Sex Magic. Leaving his face buried in his pillow, he didn't bother looking up.
Harry felt uneasy. Malfoy would almost definitely want to control him. That was just the sort of prat that Malfoy was. Harry realized for the first time the danger of the situation that he now found himself in. He would be laid bare in the hands of a Death Eater sympathizer who would have the power to hurt him.
Hermione rolled her eyes. "The fact that it was the twins, and that they required a signature to procure Harry a girlfriend didn't raise a few alarms in that thick head of yours?"
Harry fought to keep his breathing at a normal level. He didn't want to be partnered with anyone! He just wanted to leave this frankly terrifying class and never return. He raised his hand once more but Professor Mason had already brought out a rough wooden cup that was crackling and spitting blue sparks, and set it on her desk. Small pieces of paper, knotted together in the middle, began to fly out of it and Harry lowered his hand as she began to read them out loud.
"That's ridiculous!" Malfoy screeched, his eyes wild in his pale face. "I refuse! Put my name back in! I will not-"
"Well," Neville swallowed nervously. "Because of something Professor Mason said. About the Goblet pairing people up based on sexual compatibility."
"You want me to make you come?" Harry continued, taking care to make sure he had Draco's complete attention.
Rounding the corner, he glanced briefly at the stone gargoyle guarding the Headmaster's office. He'd passed it often during his late night strolls over the past year and a half, and his eyes were always drawn to the cobwebs gathered at the base where it met the false wall behind it. They never failed to cause a brief pang in his gut- the disuse of the Headmaster's office somehow depressing to him even though he hadn't forgiven the man for the events of Fifth Year. But time eased all manner of wounds, and his bitterness towards the old man had faded considerably since then.
Draco turned away and fell into a moody silence. Harry's brain niggled at him that he was missing something important.
Making a decision so impulsive that it would've made Gryffindor proud, Harry took it upon himself to thank Malfoy in another way. One that didn't involve talking. Reaching down, he shoved a hand up under Draco's robes and gripped the outline of his cock through his trousers.
Harry didn't answer, opting instead to stuff a large bite of chicken into his mouth. Hermione's eyebrows rose.
Again, this story is not mine, I do not intend to take credit for it, I just wanted a good fic to have an opportunity to be seen by many others. Enjoy!
Draco was shaking like a leaf under Harry. Harry's fingers lay tantalizingly close to the tip of the his erection, and Harry could feel that the moment rested on a knife's edge. Yet, true to Gryffindor form, he played precisely the worst card possible.
When Hermione and Ron glanced at each other before turning to look anywhere but at him, his stomach lurched disturbingly.
"Well," Hermione began, clearly uncomfortable. "You see, Harry, if they have your signature on the documents, you can't simply switch just like that."
Harry felt Malfoy squirming, rolling his shoulders and adjusting his body to lessen the strain on his neck. It looked quite uncomfortable, but he was disinclined to do anything about it.
"No, we won't," Draco fired back. "We will be attending class, shagging when required, and leaving. After the year is over, I don't plan on spending another minute in your presence, if at all possible."
He heard Malfoy groan softly in disgust, but felt him pull their hands apart to run the tip of his index finger down to the base of Harry's thumb. He stopped, seeming satisfied and reluctant to continue any further. Harry would have let him, but Mason was staring right at them. Shaking his head, Harry trailed his fingers down the back of Malfoy's hand to his wrist bone, the rough pads of his fingers scraping against the soft flesh.
Harry wrenched his mouth away from Malfoy's and took several deep breaths, his chest pressing tightly to Malfoy's each time he inhaled. "Y-yeah," he responded. Clearing his throat, he reluctantly eased away from the warm body under him.
Harry awoke to the sound of shuffling feet and low voices outside of the booth. He fumbled around for his glasses, clumsily knocking them onto the floor. As quietly as possible, he leaned over the edge, wincing at the creak of the couch springs. His fingertips had just grazed the plastic of his frames when recognized one of the voices, and bolted upright.
"Well, that all changed when you got my father in jail," Draco paused and made a disgusted sound. "You know, as if it wasn't enough that you had to be so bloody perfect! Better at everything, getting away with breaking rules, the famous Boy Who Lived making the front page of the Prophet every other day... Then you had to go and take away the one thing in my life that made me feel that I had something over you."
Harry looked over at Malfoy to see him staring at a spot on the desk in front of him, a muscle in his jaw twitching. Another five seconds stretched before the blond slowly brought a pale hand to rest on the bench between them. Feeling his gut twist unsettlingly, Harry drew his right hand out from under him and inched it along towards Malfoy's. When his fingers had barely come into contact with the back of the Slytherin's hand, he stopped.
The look that McGonagall gave Harry when he answered her owl the next morning was not encouraging. He hadn't slept at all the previous night, his stomach burning acidly with a combination of hunger and apprehension. Now, facing down a scowling Headmistress, his hopes were dashed.
Rosemary Mason, in her full decade of teaching, had never witnessed two more difficult students than the ones currently sneaking hateful glances at each other in between bites of sandwich.
"Only the herbal ones," he corrected her. "And being able to tell what does what in a potion and actually being able to brew it properly are two different things."
"As do many students after receiving their partners," she told him calmly. "The fact remains that even though you may not wish it now, when the Goblet made its assessment of you it found no objection to the class or the course material."
Harry leaned in and kissed him, moaning as he did so. He hadn't had this for nearly a week, and he hadn't known just how much he craved it until Malfoy's lips were under his again. Malfoy was unresponsive and tense. There was a lot to be said for pureblood pride, Harry realized, as he licked at the Slytherin's lower lip and felt a swelling hardness against his thigh. Malfoy obviously wanted this, was clearly enjoying it, and yet he wouldn't give in. Harry could almost respect that, if it didn't frustrate him so much.
Clearing his throat loudly, Harry watched Draco give a little jerk of surprise, and opened his mouth to speak.
