The promised smut. ❤️
“And you decided that the best way to comfort me would be to boss me around in bed?” There’s a slight grin to Harry’s voice and Draco feels his face heat.
, Draco wants to say. Instead he just regards Potter in fixed silence, finally just shrugging nonchalantly. “There’s nothing to gain from telling them and they have nothing to lose from not knowing,” he says crisply. “And I can do with a while more before I’ve to deal with Weasley’s taunting and Granger’s smugness.”
He presses Malfoy against the bike, lapping just under his jaw, leaving uneven, mottled bruises as he sucks ruthlessly into the bites he gives him. Malfoy leans into Harry, swaying unsteadily on his feet from the force of Harry’s assault.

think that’s complete rubbish,” Weasley adds then, and with no small amount of relish. “It’s barely even been a month since you both started—” he waves one large hand carelessly, “—doing whatever it is you both are doing. That’s not love, that’s just plain old randiness.”
Draco rolls his eyes. “Six years of being married and he’s still scared of the in-laws,” he mutters, sliding the cookbook back to Harry.
Now Malfoy stares at him in silence. “No,” he says firmly after a beat, seemingly unaware of the way his hands cradle his stomach. “
Harry, evidently on his way to investigate the source of all the screaming and clanging, froze in his tracks in bewilderment when Draco burst out of the bedroom, emitting shrill war-cries as he ran after Moody who was, of course, headed right for the kitchen, Draco’s robes sliding along behind him.
Harry woke with a slight start to realise he’s being prodded and poked at; cool fingers gently pressed into his right flank and Madam Pomfrey nodded to herself.

well.” The silence that follows is thick with hope and seemingly infinite, Malfoy still enough against Harry that he knows he’s holding his breath – almost as though he’s waiting for Harry to continue, to say something further about how Harry feels about him.
already. “Nah, I doubt it. He’s a self-proclaimed slut, that wanker.”
“I’m incredibly flattered that you made sure to stay up-to-date from Spain, Lucius,” Harry drawls with bored sigh.
Harry’s wildly hammering heart slows very slightly when he sees that although tiny, Malfoy’s flat – sparse but clean – is not as bad as he’d envisioned on his way upstairs. The walls are bare and what little paint remains is peeling. There’s a rather cluttered little desk under the sole, square window, and Harry immediately spots the letter he’d sent Malfoy that morning. A small, tidy kitchenette lies to his left, a single bed, neatly made, against the wall on the far right. There’s an old wardrobe, the dark wood faded and scratched, and, across from it, an overstuffed, rather comfortable looking winged armchair, a small patch of the upholstery torn and leaking fluffy cotton on one of the armrests. A large trunk sits beside the armchair, several books stacked neatly on it along with a steaming mug of what Harry can smell is tea. There’s a bathroom on the right, a little off the foot of the bed, the door slightly ajar, and Harry can just about spot the porcelain of a stained sink with a cracked, dirty little mirror above it.
“Going to swallow it all down, Potter,” Draco promises lewdly, starting to fist a hand up the long shaft, angling the bulbous, almost purpled head back into his mouth.

Harry grins lewdly. “I once spent almost a month with a raging boner, Ron. What do

It reminds him of the Hogwarts library at first, innumerable, towering shelves extending all the way up to the high ceiling, stacked with rows and rows of books, all of them, judging by their musty scent and cracked spines, centuries old. Reading tables line the walls on either side, grimy windows Charmed to let in weak sunlight, dust motes dancing lazily in each broad shaft of yellow filtering in.
Draco sits there and struggles to process that he, Draco, makes Harry feel safe.

“See you, Malfoy,” Harry says, licking his fingers clean.
“Hey, so you’ll think about the Ministry thing then?” he asks Potter. “It’s just... No pressure, mate, but it could be good, yeah?” Potter just shrugs one shoulder, humming noncommittally in reply. Weasley’s face falls slightly and for some reason, he throws Draco a look over his shoulder. “Right. Okay, then.”
“Nor Pansy me,” Malfoy sighs. “It’s probably why she said she’s most certainly not going with me this year.”
By the time they finally part and Harry drags him out of the crowd, the rest of their party has arrived, looking around for the both of them. They all spend the evening gathered around the single booth they manage to commandeer and Harry has plenty of time to think about the kiss – and what it might turn into once they’re home.
“Malfoy,” Harry presses his fingers to one suddenly aching temple, “please tell me what it’ll take for you to just...stop being like this. What would you have me do in exchange for being just a
Harry smiled and stepped forward, extending his hand. Scorpius squeaked and darted behind Malfoy’s legs.
“Please!” he screams, thrashing frantically, cock slipping through Potter’s fingers, now damp with precome. Potter just sticks his fingers back in and Draco whimpers around them, licking them thick with spit and pressing beseechingly against Potter.
Draco automatically slowed when he neared the little coterie gathered at the wide window seat. It was the usual bunch of Gryffindors with Lovegood's fair head standing out as the single Ravenclaw – but Draco’s eyes remained on the one person who stood out like only he could.
hooking them down so that the last second Draco’s orgasm is drawn out into an agonisingly brilliant eruption of pleasure that has him shrieking and clawing at the door, his spent cock twitching damply against his thigh while Potter massages his prostate with an insistent press that nearly renders Draco unconscious.
at Potter’s chest. “I know some people are into that stuff,” Potter adds, panting now as he bats away Draco’s hand.
“Still...it’d be nice if you came,” Harry says earnestly.
“Nooo!” Draco groaned. “But I hate him!”
When Draco turns, Potter is standing there with his hands casually stuffed into his pockets; his chin high in the air as he stares flatly down his nose at Draco, jaw bunched tight, his whole form seeming to crackle with barely suppressed, white-hot fury, the badly masked ferocity in his expression making Draco erupt in gooseflesh.
“Thank you for sparing the extra sugar.”
“Yes.”
“What?” Malfoy and Harry ask in unison, Harry taking a step forward.
“No, he doesn’t know,” Harry waves a hand, and then when Malfoy looks confused, “Oh, I mean, it’s a surprise gift,” he adds hastily.
“Fuck, I’m sorry.” I scramble around to lift up off him and find my wand.
where else.”
“I’m not very fond of this holiday, Malfoy.” Harry hesitates before going on. “My parents were killed Halloween night, so...” Malfoy pales so fast that Harry instantly regrets bringing it up.
I’ve had him around for long enough now that I’ve managed to recognise him for who he really is and detach that person from who he used to
“We can just sit here and not even look at each other if you prefer that, Malfoy,” Granger says wryly, sipping at her wine and not even looking a tiny bit offended that Draco is on the very verge of throwing a tantrum at the prospect of being left alone with her.
flicker of some sort in Hermione’s eyes.
“Finally!” Harry whispers on a groan, his head falling back, his hips still and unmoving as he simply stays put.
“I know,” Draco said tightly, sulky displeasure clear in his voice; he scowled at the teasing grin he got for that.
“It’s really fucking creepy when you do that, Potter,” Draco hisses, determinedly not making eye contact with any of the occupants of the room, his gaze fixed somewhere near the Wireless on the mantle.
‘dates for the night’.
Draco wants to stand up and flip the whole table because out of nowhere he feels a lump rise in his throat and he is fucking fed up of these sudden, completely random — not to mention bafflingly drastic — mood swings and fierce rushes of emotion. Potter’s soft, genuinely touched expression doesn’t help one bit, and so Draco shoves the rest of his omelette into his mouth and then angrily stabs the grilled sausage on his plate, stuffing half of it into his mouth, determinedly chewing and swallowing intermittently to force down the tears with eggs and meat.
“I’ll need to scan your signature and require a sample of your blood now, Malfoy,” Hermione ends the projection, causing both men to blink around in the sudden brightness as the lights come back on, “You can sit up and fasten your robes now, if you like.”
“Portkey’s at seven,” Potter calls out after him, not even bothering to hide his laughter.

?” he presses exasperatedly, before his eyes narrow dangerously, “
Enormous grey eyes peered out from behind Malfoy and despite everything, Harry grinned, taking a single limping step forward. He stuck out his hand again. “Hello, Scorpius.”
“Okay, well, I’ll give you these for the time being, and you can come back if you think you need something more to keep you up and running through the day,” she nods, “This is for your nausea, by the way, just a basic anti-nausea,” she points to the second, blue glass bottle.
So now, instead of taking it off, Harry simply rucks the jumper up over Draco’s belly and applies his mouth to the warm skin of his stomach, sucking moist little kisses and swirling his tongue into the shallow dip of his navel, Draco quivering under his mouth.
Harry bent and picked up Lily. She was even warmer now. He arranged her against his shoulder and gently stroked her face with his thumb.
“Are you going to fuck me?” Draco slurs, tongue thick and slippery in his mouth.
, and Draco doesn’t know if he has it in him to start talking about it only to realise that it’s not mutual.
Crying out softly, Draco wrenches himself out of the kiss, desperately gasping in shrill wheezes for air, squirming and disentangling one hand from Potter’s hair to reach back and tug weakly at one of Potter’s, shuddering every few seconds just from the ravenous
Almost without thinking, Draco draws his wand, points it at the Forbidden Forest and loudly chants, “
“I am, yes.”
To Harry’s intense surprise, Malfoy complies without comment, striding forward and folding himself into one of the chairs in front of Hermione’s desk, spine stiff and jaw still clenched.
“I don’t need any more help from you, Potter. Fuck off.”
“Thank Merlin for that,” Draco says, rolling his eyes pointedly. “He was sort of an arse.”
—please! Please, fuck,
Two weeks after the first incident, and Ron was already telling Harry that it felt like sixth year all over again.
“I’m serious, I won’t let go,” Harry’s warns.
“I’ll wait with bated breath,” Harry drawls back, turning away and going to fetch Malfoy’s tea and his own breakfast.
Potter, however, lubes up, hoists a long, milky white thigh onto one arm and splits Draco’s arse open on his cock.
“Harry,” Draco strides forward, clutching a bunch of socks in both hands. “Harry, listen. I don’t have a single matching pair of socks.”
And now he’s supposed to sit here and successfully convince Potter that he finds nothing about him pleasing.
“Thanks,” he says on a slow smirk. “I should knee you in the bits more often.”
it, Potter.” He followed it with an eager kiss to Harry’s gaping mouth.
“What.” Harry emerges from under the socks, spluttering as he takes in Scorpius’ robes and snorting with laughter. “How’d you manage that?” he giggles, standing up and walking over.
“Could you...pour me a glass of water?” Malfoy sounded like he fully expected Harry to laugh in his face.
“Excuse me,” Malfoy splutters, “my
He’s wearing a pair of soft, grey, terribly comfortable looking jogging bottoms, and has a towel slung around the nape of his neck, his chest and stomach gleaming with a thin layer of perspiration. He has a set of huge dumbbells on the floor beside him, and is drinking deeply from a bottle of water.
I don’t say anything. Every single eye on the room is on us. My peripheral vision recognises the shock of red hair somewhere to my left but otherwise, every single cell in me is focused on Draco.
“What time does your fan club arrive?” he asks drowsily, nuzzling at Potter’s jaw before he finally pulls away and sits back.
His arms give away and Draco sinks onto his elbows, his hips working on their own accord now, jerky and out of rhythm, Draco’s moaned panting and Potter’s desperate gulping loud inside the curtain of his hair. One of Potter’s hands disappears for a second, and before Draco can whine his protest, it returns.
Draco’s lips twitch. “Just the one?”
Draco feels slightly guilty that he’s only now starting to enjoy his pregnancy so much. Although he attributes a majority of the enjoyment to the innumerable orgasms Potter has started giving him every day, he believes it also has something to do with the relief that has come from the elimination of all that tense uncertainty that hung around them every time they were in a room together. Potter is open and very giving with his affection and while this is very convenient in the face of Draco’s raging libido, it also means that Draco isn’t as lonely as he’d been for months – years, in fact.
The silence lasted a lot longer than before, both of them not saying a word for what had to be at least a quarter of an hour. Harry checked the large, round clock that ticked soundlessly on the wall above Madam Pomfrey’s office; it was nearly four AM.
Draco can’t seem to find any air to breathe in and is definitely lightheaded now. “Merlin—
?” Malfoy’s scream fractures the brittle air in the enclosed, stone kitchen, no trace of warmth in the space despite the fire.
“That sick
When the very tip of his cock finally brushed against the shallow dip where Malfoy’s stretched hole lay, Harry’s cock spat out a large dribble of precome that then trickled down his cleft. Harry whined in his throat, bit his lip and gently coaxed the tip in, Malfoy completely still under him.
the one who keeps asking me to try being in a relationship for once, instead of sleeping my way around all of London.”
I pull it on over my head and the gemstone comes to rest just past my sternum. “I love it,” I say simply, tucking it into my robes and then down my shirt, prodding the thread down in past the collar; the pendant feels strangely warm against my skin. “Thanks.” I throw a light Stinging Hex at him and he yelps.

“Wait,

“You were plenty rough the first time,” Draco informs him blandly, quirking an eyebrow at him when he pulls back. “And I survived just fine.”
He’s wearing striped, soft looking pyjama bottoms and the same jumper he’d worn the night he’d offered to teach Draco. His hair is pillow-mussed and his face a bit pale and he sits hunched over with his back to Draco.

“But we have a free clinic here at Mungo’s,” Hermione says, a thin line between her brows.
“Oh, I’m looking at him,” Draco drawls, leaning one shoulder on the cool metal and crossing his arms.
“I’ve listened already,” he says. “Your boyfriend is a slut. And you need to bring out your fanciest best to keep him interested, yes?”
“You think?” Draco says steadily, proud of himself for holding himself together.
“They’re doing that now. The dementors. They’re taking away people.” His heart thundering in his ears, Harry sat in silence. “Sometimes they Kiss them first. But apparently they take some away...whole,” Malfoy’s eyes shifted, “Like they tried to with your little girl, earlier today.”
Draco’s cock twitches against his thigh and he sighs. “Fuck, yes.”
“Really?” Potter sucks harder and Draco’s cock is suddenly at full mast.
“We don’t,” I bite out. “Doesn’t make it any less true.”

“Er, I can’t go, I have loads to do,” Harry says at once.
“Draco.”
Potter, the courteous, hospitable bastard – always doing little things for Draco just to drive him up the wall.

Very slowly, Potter tilts his head to one side, eyes narrowing in consideration before — in a move so quick that Draco couldn’t have predicted it even if he’d been expecting it —Potter grabs him by one elbow and drags him closer, bending slightly and pushing his nose into the crook of Draco’s neck, inhaling loud and deep. His skin is fever hot where he touches Draco, and frozen as he is in shocked fear, Draco finds that heat...

Draco’s own body is seizing up from the shock of the sudden impaling, his arse clinging to Harry’s cock greedily, razor sharp bolts of pleasure shooting up and down his spine and that same tightly knotted, burning hot pool of arousal making his stomach and hips ache. He’s gasping quietly, Draco, nails hooked into the sweat slippery skin of Harry’s pecs, his long, white thighs trembling uncontrollably against Harry’s hips.
“Lyra is,” Harry says with a hint of a frown. “Gilly is watching her. I managed to get Scorp’s pants on before he ran off to watch TV. ”
And then relent and give it to him.
“Goodnight, Malfoy.”
Draco spins around on one heel, juvenile glee coursing through him at the prospect of making a dramatic exit—
word for it?” Ron asks, slowly and incredulously.
“I’m not entirely surprised, actually,” she says with a sardonic slant of her mouth. “Don’t be angry with him about it, though. He likely wouldn’t have told Ron and me either, had I not been his Healer and had access to all his medical information. Hell, some of Ron’s family doesn’t even know yet.”
“I don’t understand,” Draco repeats rather helplessly.

“Why didn’t you accept his proposal?” Harry asks, blinking slowly.
Then he looked up into the cold, grey eyes of Draco Malfoy.
He’s close, I can tell. He also seems very shocked; unprepared and a bit befuddled – like he hadn’t expected to be as taken by surprise as he seems. Slowly, he opens his eyes, and the white of the moonlight sharpens the silver in them.
“Mmm,” Malfoy hums, dragging a hand along Harry’s thigh, up to his hip and then back down, stroking him with proprietary familiarity, bringing his other hand to curl loosely around Harry’s wrist against his stomach, sighing contentedly through his nose.
Harry had fisted his cock until it was chaffed and throbbed painfully, the foreskin bright red and sore, his balls
“Don’t be absurd,” Malfoy scoffs softly. “All these years without incident and you lose control simply because I threatened to sleep with someone else?” There’s a hint of a smirk to Malfoy’s tone now and Harry’s jaw aches with how hard he grits his teeth.
“Nothing. I’m just dancing.”
“Does it hurt?”
“Why?” Ron scowls, “Where are you going?”
“Tell me what your deal is.” Potter drags his jeans off and grasps his jutting cock; his glasses are smudged and crooked, his gaze fixed on Draco’s arsehole as he pulls them off and tosses them aside.
“Why do you think, Granger?” Malfoy rolls his eyes, “So I could lead a normal fucking life. You think it’d have been easy for me to get through Hogwarts if I walked around attracting slobbering idiots the whole time?”
him roll his eyes. “Are you fucking done yet? I’m cold.”
Harry slants him a look, gaze amused as he takes in Malfoy’s wide, mischievously twinkling grey eyes, his sharp nose still slightly pink from the cold outside, to match his cheeks, flushed with playful excitement. Slowly Harry says, “I’m not a vanilla prude.”
The long, wooden table is strewn with a few old copies of the Daily Prophet, with that day’s copy still rolled up neatly with a piece of twine. There are several moisture rings and the wood needs polishing, but Draco can tell that this too has been scrubbed clean.
After his talk with Weasley, he’s more or less sure of two things: one, Harry may just feel the same way about Draco as Draco does about him, as insane as that sounds, and two, Harry isn’t happy about what Draco did the previous night.
“Are the dementurbs gone?”
Malfoy’s elbow is in my face.
Potter’s eyes twinkle and he tilts his head slightly, regarding Draco carefully for a few seconds. “I didn’t help you as a favour, Malfoy,” he says slowly.
,” he hisses, a cold lump of some sort rising up his throat as the mental image of a puffy-faced Malfoy, asleep in the hospital wing, floats before his eyes.
“I bet it gets lonely, though.” It’s the most covert way Draco can bring himself to sniff around for signs of someone else in Harry’s life.
Potter’s harsh panting rings around the cramped space. “You reeeally need to learn how not to let that beautiful,
“You invited
Because it feels like a challenge.
“I spent all morning throwing up,” Malfoy replies distractedly as he peers into the en suite, eyes bulging at the sight of the, frankly, obscenely large claw-foot tub, scrubbed spotlessly white and gleaming.
Startlingly enough, Malfoy smirks, gorgeous despite his puffy eyes and cunning smile. “You can try,” he drawls and Harry can’t help the laugh that escapes him.
Bouncing slightly with a yelp, Draco scrambled up to attack Harry’s pants, pulling them down and after a bit of a struggle, dragging them completely off Harry’s long legs, running his hands back up the length of them, feeling the fine black hair part under his fingers, to wrap one hand carefully around Harry’s erection and using the other to drag Harry forward atop himself.
“Arseholes,” Draco replies flatly. “What do you want?”
“People expect me to,” Harry croaks, wiping his face again, leaving tracks of dirt. “They expect me to and I let them
“He’s lying,” Ron says immediately and as though it’s startlingly obvious.
He waited for the frenzied disbelief at what had just happened to flood his mind; for the jarring surges of panic and regret.

“Crisis averted,” he announces with a little grimace. “Ron just picked Scorp up – I fixed his robes by the way.” Draco just rolls his eyes with a reluctant huff of laughter. “Sorry,” Harry murmurs softly, picking up the tub of toys that’s been upended – likely by their raging daughter – and collecting its contents with a wave of his wand. “I know you were supposed to start getting ready forty minutes ago. I could take her if she’s calmed down a bit?”
Unfazed, Potter had done just that. And he’d done it with such élan. Pressing lube into Draco’s arse with his thumb, grabbing Draco’s arse and jiggling it with obscene glee, playing with Draco’s rim even as he’d thrust into him, his silver pendant swinging against Draco’s back.
Harry blinks awake from the light doze he’d fallen into. He pushes his nose into the little nook under Draco’s ear, pressing around the curve of his back as he says, “I told you, let’s just go up to bed.”
“Git,” Harry says, sniggering along helplessly. “No, listen. I don’t care what they say and neither do you. And I’d like very much to move into a place that isn’t steeped in Dark Magic and I’d like to do so with a roommate.”
“Be brave. Do not take the Cloak off. Do not make a sound. And don’t touch anything.”
“He’d still be my child’s other parent,” Harry says hoarsely. “Of

“I think that’s the closest you’ll ever get to saying you love me too?” I guess.
“You’re insatiable, Potter,” Draco murmurs three hours later as he lies there pinned between Potter and his sofa.

He’s just grabbed his carefully wrapped textbooks when the flash goes off, prompting another two reporters to quickly fight their way past the crowd to the forefront and raise their own clunky cameras as well.
“What were you hoping I’d do or say, Malfoy?!” and then, with a mirthless chuckle, “A proposal from me as well?”

in that club – luminous skin and ridiculously shiny hair, lips berry-pink and moist, eyes sparkling with vitality.
“Looks like we’re going to be in the papers again.”

to be more accurate.
“TATTOO!” Weasley bellowed.
“Yes, well, he probably wants to be fed now,” Draco picks up his wand and waves it in the direction of the kitchen, “Caesar, run along now, your bowl’s full.”
“UNLIKELY ROMANCE?” shouts the front page, and seated at the Gryffindor and Slytherin tables respectively, Harry and Draco exchange grins over breakfast.
“I’m living under your roof and steadily eating my way through your pantry, Potter,” Draco drawls with a self-deprecating snort. “The least I can do in return is answer some of your questions. What is it?”
Draco’s stomach flips over with excitement as Potter strolls in, Weasley beside him, gesticulating wildly, both of them deep in conversation. Potter’s still sweating from training, briny tracks running down the side of his face, forehead, upper lip and neck glistening with perspiration, the round neck of his grey a-shirt dark and wet with it. Potter runs the back of one hand across his brow, chuckling at something, no doubt, inane as fuck, Weasley is saying, and as his arm lifts, Draco can see the beads of moisture clinging to the wiry black hairs in his armpit.
“No! I just meant—”
And yet she stands there, bushy brown hair practically bristling around her as she stares (glares) at Draco.
“Eat the sandwich, Malfoy.”
Potter smiles into the kiss, the tips of his hair glowing golden against the morning sunlight as he pulls back and combs his fingers through Draco’s hair spread out across the pillow. Draco takes in the bags under his eyes once again, the bloodshot puffiness of his eyes.
He swept his cloak back over his shoulders and the first thing Harry saw was the gleaming hilt of a sheathed sword tucked at his hip. Malfoy was working at a broad sling of some sort, knotted tightly, across his chest. As Harry and his sons watched, Malfoy undid the knot, revealing that he had the child tied to his back. When Malfoy carefully lowered the little boy, lifting the sling off him and then taking his hand, Harry actually smiled.
It’s really difficult to hate him, Draco thinks grumpily now as Potter sidles into the room and ambles over to Draco who’s lounging across the sofa, to hand him a large mug of warm honey-milk. Damn him — how is one supposed to succeed at sincerely hating him?
Potter doesn’t kiss the man and when the little shit reaches up, mid-sentence, and runs a hand down the contours of Potter’s bicep with a sly little laugh, Potter immediately eases away. For some completely illogical reason, this infuriates Draco further.
. This is about Harry and the fact that he probably likes Malfoy—oh, for heaven’s sake!” She rolled her eyes and looked away when Ron hissed at what she’d said. “Harry. I don’t know if you’ll listen, but I think you ought to just go over and talk to him. Or at least let him know that you’d like to talk. Even if he doesn’t cooperate, at least you’ll know you tried?”
of fussing from Father, I managed to lift the curse,” he says simply, shoulders lifting in a shrug. “It took about a month until the Veela genes surfaced properly, but well—so—yes...” he mumbles, trailing off once more. “Father died a few weeks after that – his heart had started to give in even before the War ended – but Mother said he’d never looked as handsome as he did lying there in his coffin.” Draco blushes furiously, suddenly. “I don’t know why I just told you that, Potter, I’m—”
Narcissa makes a slightly impatient, huffing sound and gets to her feet, plucking Lyra up from his lap and turning away dismissively. “I’d like to remind you that I probably know more about sex than you do, regardless of how adventurous you and Harry might’ve been. There’s something to be said of
“Yes,” Malfoy admitted softly. “So hard, Potter...”
Harry ambled over and Draco, despite his fury, reluctantly and furtively admired the way his muscles moved, his various tattoos seeming to dance over his skin. But when Harry entered the kitchen and snorted in amusement – emitting a spray of foam – Draco gnashed his teeth and kicked him in the shin.
Lucius is no longer smiling, instead looking off somewhere to one side; Narcissa is sobbing quietly into one hand. Malfoy is panting softly and Harry gives into the urge to reach over and firmly clasp his hand.
with you?” Harry snaps heatedly, keeping his voice low and leaning forward. “

“What? No, no,” I force out a laugh, “Not distracted. And I’m good. How’s work?”
“Sit the fuck down, Dean, I assure you that he isn’t
“Yes,
?” Harry snaps. “Why is everybody asking me to fucking
“I’m not a fucking woman,” Draco grits, “but I’m certainly offended.”
“Malfoy,” Potter growls, finally twisting some of Draco’s hair around his fingers and bucking up, leaving a smear of slick on Draco’s cheek as his cock slides up his face.
Because despite everything, despite
“What?” Harry, absurdly enough, feels his face heat at once, “What’s that look supposed to mean?”
“Why in the name of Merlin’s balls would I do that?”
Malfoy was silent for a moment. “No,” he said. “No, I won’t pretend.” And then, “My sympathies, Potter.”
“What’s the fucking deal with you?” Zabini frowns. “Is he that stupid that you’re worried to introduce him?”
Malfoy has the decency to flush although his chin does jerk up defiantly. “I’ll write you a list,” he drawls sarcastically and Harry feels something bubbling up to the surface.
. The stooped old thing had still been yelling in affronted indignation at Draco in its grating, bullfrog like voice a few seconds later when Potter had barrelled into the room with his glasses slipping down his nose, wand drawn, wearing nothing but a thick, terry towel wrapped firmly around his hips.
Ron immediately turns red. “I didn’t mean to imply that he’s—”
“Are you mental? The press has been granted permission to be there tonight.”
“He’s a damn attention whore, is what he is,” Draco grits out under his breath. “Can’t he just stay asleep out there? Had to come in here and—”
way!”
--” He scrambles up quickly, lips wet with Draco’s spit, glasses askew, his white t-shirt snug enough that Draco can see where his nipples have pebbled. He’s already hard, his erection a neat little bulge in his worn blue jeans, and his gaze strays over Draco’s bare chest before snagging with burning grey, at which point he gulps hard and stammers, “I—I’m sorry.”
,” he shoots Harry a sly look, eyes glinting, “
“About what?”
“Stop apologising,” Malfoy says irritably, and then squirms awkwardly. “I mean... Whatever. We’ll read up about it, I suppose.”
Harry leaned back onto his hands and stretched his legs out alongside Draco with a broken groan of pain. Ignoring his near complete nudity for a few more seconds, Draco reached out and gave one of Harry’s ankles an empathetic squeeze. Harry sighed, smiling lazily as Draco got stiffly to his feet and pulled his clothes back into place, muttering under his breath as he Summoned first his tie, and then the buttons he’d once again lost, applying a Sticking Charm to fix them back onto his shirt – these charms never lasted long; he’d have to make another trip to the kitchens. Or maybe he’d just teach himself to sew. He might as well; it’s not as if Harry would ever
Jerking in startlement more than pleasure, Draco scrabbles to clutch Harry’s hair again, guiding his head in a slow bob down his length, rasping out hot, breathless gasps. Harry’s hands never stop moving over him, running over his stomach and chest and sides and nipples, the tip of his tongue fitted into the slit, his lips tight around Draco’s cock.
“What in the world are you doing
But Harry places the book aside, firmly brackets Malfoy’s face with both hands and kisses him again, not pulling away for long, breathless minutes until they’re both red in the face and sprawled out flat. Wordlessly, Harry works Malfoy’s pyjamas off and circles his cock with one hand, swallowing Malfoy’s soft moan as he works his fist over it on torturously slow, leisurely pulls that soon have Malfoy’s hips arching high off the bed.
“I just remembered, I’ve to be somewhere,” I say, pausing right in the middle of Diagon Alley, other shoppers continuing to hurry past all around me.
We eat cheese and crackers. We eat the mushroom risotto. We eat the chocolate mousse.
“You don’t say,” Draco replies blandly, lip curling into an expression that he hopes is efficient enough to convey his thoughts on that bit of information.
“Ron, none of that necessarily—” starts Hermione.
“Shut up and fuck me,” Malfoy groans, his toes curling where his foot flops in midair, his hips now moving in time with Harry’s fingers, thighs trembling. “Damn it, Potter!” he sobs, spine pulling inwards as Harry works in a third finger and twists them inside him.
Malfoy moaned, a short, devastated sound uttered on an exhale, before he muffled the rest into the many layers around his hands. His cock was leaking copiously onto his belly and his toes curled into the sheets with each inward thrust of Harry’s fingers.
“Ah, sorry, Scorpius. I’m afraid I didn’t pack any berries.”
Harry’s expression turns slightly severe. “Please don’t be a prat about this,” he says softly, though his tone has an edge to it. “If I’d hurt you—if I'd tried to—”

can’t believe you’re real. It’s why I kiss you so much, you know,” he says wisely, “to make sure you’re not something I’ve whipped up from imagination.”
“Hullo.” He sounds decidedly breathless. Then, smiling: “Sorry. I didn’t mean to almost kill you with the door.”
“Fuck, you’re tight,” Potter comments admiringly, twisting the digits through conjured lube, and starting to stroke his prostate with the pads of his fingers.
And Harry

The silence stretches on and on, turning strained and unbelievably tense. When the same house-elf from earlier pops in with a
“If it hadn’t been for her, Scorpius and I probably wouldn’t have made it. She...spent all her magic in keeping them away. I...was trying to pack some things. When I turned around, it was already done.”
“Er.” Harry lit his wand and peered up the stairs. “Let’s go find out.”
“Harry.” Hermione’s voice is firm and I sigh, placing my beer next to the bowl of crisps and leaning back on the sofa, pushing my glasses up onto my forehead and rubbing at my face vigorously. I can feel the beginnings of another headache. “You’re going to have to talk to us about this at some point,” she says bluntly and I drop my hands to glare at her.
He pulls out what appears to be just a long length of thick black thread, until I see something glinting off the end. He holds it out to me and I take the necklace, peering at the oval medallion that dangles at the end. The dull gold base has a pellucid gem stone in a deep green set into it, the extremely fine threads of gold running through the stone catching the light every now and then.
Potter pointedly turns the television on and Granger laughs. “We won’t be long,” he promises sheepishly, looking Draco straight in the eye with a small nod; in the absence of their present company, Draco imagines Potter might’ve squeezed his hand reassuringly or maybe gently stroked his cheek.
!” he whimpers, spreading his knees wider and pressing his arse into Harry’s face with a delightful lack of shame until Harry stills him with a bruising
“Always did know you were a hubristic wretch, Potter,” Lucius seethes, “Just like your father, from what I remember of that Mudblood-loving swine.”
“It’s still one of the safest places to be.”
“It was so hard for us here, Draco,” she whispers brokenly. “For your father, especially. We couldn’t leave the Manor without a wand being pointed at us, a hex being flung our way. And with you gone, it just seemed so dismal, living all by ourselves in this house.”
“He’s fine,” I say. I feel really warm suddenly and take off my Auror robes and drape them over the back of my chair. When I look up, Hermione is staring at me, looking concerned, and Ron looks like he’s about to pop a vein. “We haven’t had sex yet,” I blurt.
“Draco,” Harry says on an exhale, feeling like he’s about to fly apart.

“Then listen to Papa,” Harry says calmly, winking at Draco again as he comes back with a brick of butter.
and unblinkingly watching shockingly tacky soap operas on TV.  She’d responded clarifying that it’s a book detailing some of the most interesting cases the DMLE had seen, and Draco had to grudgingly agree that it did sound like the sort of literature that consulting-Auror Harry Potter would devour.

than surprised now. “You followed it, then?” he asks casually. “The tragic saga of The Boy Who Lived getting bitten while helping on a case when he wasn’t even an official Auror; it was covered endlessly — did you read all about it then?”
They both stared at it for a beat.
He laves over Harry’s nipples some more, biting hard into the skin around them and leaving stark imprints, already purpling by the time he finally licks his way down the taut, quivering muscles of Harry’s hard abdomen, dragging his teeth over the firmness of it and lapping at the sparse line of hair trailing down from his shallow little navel to his thatch of coarse black curls.
“Kreacher,” Draco sighs, “please listen? Yes? I know what I’m doing. I’m going in there. I...don’t
“Why won’t who all leave you alone?” Weasley asks, sounding bewildered.
“You’ve
Harry shrugged with a smile, now shooting consecutive drying spells at the shirt. “I caught the Snitch.”
When he steals a quick peek, Malfoy is staring at him with his mouth hanging open, looking completely gobsmacked. “
“It’s ... me,” Draco said, slowly getting to his feet and pressing into him, his own face heating now. “It’s ... Draco.”
Potter sighs. “Malfoy, you’re not listening, only a

Potter narrows his eyes a bit before rolling them. “No,” he says, “Why would you care?” They stare at each other a beat. “I was just clarifying. Earlier you said—”

face.”
There’s a creak of a door hinge now and then Potter is joining Draco in the back alley. He’s wearing a pristine white shirt tucked into blue jeans and his boots look new. He’s fiddling with his hair as usual, but that somehow proves to be an improvement on his general appearance. Trudging up to Draco, Potter stands there with his hands in his pockets, gaze fixed on Draco’s mouth wrapped around the cigarette.
Potter lives in no dearth of loved ones but Draco can't help but feel an inexplicably random rush of sympathy for the man. He's no Gryffindor, Draco; he isn’t one to live under the shadow of all the good deeds that people might’ve done for him – but it was Potter who had pulled him out of a burning room, Potter who had spoken in his favour at his trials, Potter whom he had to thank for living, not only as a free man, but as a proud Veela.
you fell for!” Lucius rages in one breath, spittle flying, eyes popping alarmingly.
Lifting up in a high arc, neck strained and throat raw with how loudly he’s shrieking, Draco sinks his nails into Harry’s back, ruthlessly breaking the skin, and comes harder than he ever thought it possible. Harry’s emitting some sort of barking snarl as he watches Draco unravel completely, flying apart while simultaneously imploding underneath him, his rosy cock shooting a long stream of come that hits Draco’s bobbing Adam’s apple in a messy white splatter.
His smile doesn’t falter. “There’s this guy I know; let’s just say he’s a friend, shall we? Muggleborn. Recently got out of Muggle prison. Was willing to do pretty much anything for a bunch of galleons.” He clasps his fingers in front of him and bounces on the balls of his feet, eyes shining. “So I paid him to let me put a very specific curse on his cock and then paid him some more to drink some Polyjuice and attempt to seduce a serial adulterer I know into sucking his cursed cock. Turns out that the greedy little swine wanted to a lot more than just suck his cock; he wanted to ride it too! Such a pity it landed him at Mungo’s.
Draco has raised a fist before he knows it, his elbow hitting the wall as he draws it back, jostling him awkwardly, giving Potter more than enough time to snort derisively, grab Draco by the wrist and twist his arm back, pressing his own clenched fist into his lower back so that Draco’s hips are canted outwards.
“Tea, I think,” Hermione says decisively, and I gladly follow her into the kitchen and settle down at the table as she makes the tea and pulls out packets of biscuits. “We should decorate your flat tomorrow,” she says brightly as she sets my mug before me and takes a seat opposite me.
Malfoy in turn keeps his word and brings his fully packed and shrunken trunk with him, barely looking at Harry, having hardly spoken a word to him since the previous night. He’s dressed in neat, voluminous robes in a sombre grey and wears his hair in a severe knot at his nape, his face worn and tired, mouth tightly pressed into a thin line.
“Yeah, because you reeked of it yourself,” Dean informs him. “Olfactory adaptation and all that.”
get comfortable, and the aversion he’d developed towards sleeping potions after the war was still strong enough that he couldn’t bring himself to down any of it.
“Why?” he asks with obviously forced calm.
“And do you get a lot of them here?”
“We can’t stay past two,” Harry says quickly.
His cock was half-hard.
“For Merlin’s sake, that’s not how one keeps their clothes crease-free,” says a lilting voice and Harry blinks around to see Malfoy leaning against the snow-frosted window of Honeydukes, almost blending into the white background in his pale,
There’s another long pause. “Really?” Malfoy turns his head so Harry can see one pink cheek and a heavy-lidded grey eye trained curiously on him.
He laughs along with Potter this time, heart happily skipping up and down his oesophagus. When they get to the empty pages at the end of the album, Potter reaches for the envelope beside him, pulling out a few shiny, new photographs, all of them featuring a sturdy little baby with bright turquoise, and in one photo vivid pink, hair.
“I don’t think--” Harry swallowed again, shutting his eyes as he felt his face heat for the first time since he’d got into bed with Malfoy. “I don’t know if I can do that without hurting you.”
“Selfish of you, keeping these all to yourself,” Draco had remarked with a scowl.

“Was,” Draco points out, getting to his feet, “and that too because my father was kind of an arse and used our gold to get his way around here. My father is now dead and I am nothing like him...anymore,” Draco adds, slightly awkwardly.
“Certain level of trust between

Malfoy, his face devoid of any emotion or expression now, stands, ignoring Harry’s hand. “Let’s go,” he says shortly, wiping his face on his sleeve and stepping around Harry, making for the door with his usual easy grace, one hand on his swollen stomach, and the other clenched into a tight fist at his side as he walks away from Harry without looking back.
“He’s... Ah.” Harry fidgeted for a second before saying, “Scorpius, this is Albus. And this is James.”
one, and have been once since birth.”
Hermione rolls her eyes. “I think all of us know that Malfoy’s... ‘thing’ with Tristan isn’t going to last.”
“No...” Harry shrugs, “I just...want to give him something.”
The sky breaks open and rain starts hammering against the pane of glass and Harry’s ears are jangling warningly as his temper spikes dangerously. “Do you even realise how dangerously you just Apparated?” he asks through clenched teeth, deliberately drawing deep, full breaths. “You could’ve splinched yourself, Malfoy.”
Draco blinks. “The Veela thing?” he repeats, one eyebrow lifting in a slow slide.
“Because I also get the feeling that you’re fantastic in bed,” Malfoy says flatly.
Grinning, Malfoy permits Harry to nuzzle his cheek. There’s a brief silence again during which Harry simply breathes against Malfoy’s skin.
“Don’t be a prick, Malfoy,” Harry says impatiently, sitting on the very edge of his seat and turning halfway to look at him properly, “Tell us what’s going on.”
“Fucking get your stupid, scarred face away from me!” Draco grits, rearing up and trying to head-butt Potter in the face. The man dodges neatly, expressing turning icy and sour as he bends his leg some more, and Draco chokes out a gasp, certain that his knee is going to snap. “
pushing all the way into him, arms trembling on either side of Draco, cock sliding in on a torturously slow press until his pelvis is tight against Draco’s arse.
Mostly because Draco doesn’t have Potter’s cock lodged so deep in his arse that he’s coughing from it tickling his throat.

And when they’re not frantically fucking or desperately snogging, he and Potter take walks together, go to the cinema, go out to brunch or dinner, or very simply, just stay home reading or watching television – together; always together. Draco doesn’t think he’s spent this much quality time with anyone in the past, whether he was sleeping with them or not. It’s fascinating and also rather terrifying; fascinating because he actually finds himself enjoying it,

“You just did,” Draco drawls, his balls quopping with the need to come. “Eat me out,” he tells Potter, and lifts his knees up to his shoulders as Potter more than amiably slithers down and obliges.
“Why?” asks Draco stupidly.
Ron shrugs. “Sleeping around. Look, I’m not his biggest fan.” He smiles crookedly. “But the git’s alright. I know he’s had this whole anti-relationship act he’s had going these past few years, but he’s bound to settle down some day, and it’s not going to be with someone like Tristan,” he declares flatly. I mouth soundlessly at him for a few seconds.
“We were discussing what I’d do with the torch...”
Harry doesn’t reply for a long time as he just sits and regards Malfoy steadily, noting the way the sardonic smirk slowly fades off Malfoy’s startlingly handsome face. “Do you regret it, Malfoy?” he asks quietly when Malfoy finally starts to fidget. “Do you regret kissing me back and letting me drag you into the gents’?”
They moaned into each other’s mouths as Draco sunk, not very carefully, onto Harry’s cock. The shaft pulsed and throbbed inside him, the burn of accommodation making Draco go cross eyed. “Wait!” Draco gasped as Harry lifted him back up so only the head was inside; but before Harry could scrabble to obey, to hold him firmly in place, Draco was already sliding down once more, gravity and his own weight dragging him into place around Harry’s cock, which then slid snidely over Draco’s prostate in a flash of near blinding pleasure. Draco thrashed. “
“No,” Harry cuts in, bored. “I haven’t had my cock in a bloke’s arse in the longest fucking time and if that by itself doesn’t tell you how
Another derisive snort. “Yeah, I’m sure.”
“Are you regretting this yet?” Draco asks and Potter, panting through his mouth, slowly shakes his head. Draco rubs the pads of both thumbs over Potter’s arsehole and presses until the rim dips inwards. “You don’t regret doing this with me, Potter?” he questions and once again, Potter shakes his head.
He sounded slightly desperate, bitterly resigned and supremely vulnerable.
“They weren’t there,” Draco says, sounding choked as he frantically tries to swallow his tears. “I got past the gates but I’d been warded out of the house and one of the elves finally opened the doors to tell me that I wasn’t allowed in because Mother and Father weren’t there anymore — that they’d m-moved.”

“But not because of the baby,” Draco says softly, derision barely masked.
your giant boner,” Ron supplies from the kitchen.
Harry can feel his boner lean hopefully in Malfoy’s direction.
“I’m appropriately appalled,” Draco murmurs, nuzzling at his nose. “Can we go have sex now?”
Malfoy jerked his hand out of the way with a little gasp, the look in his eyes now more uncertain than angry.

He hadn’t even kissed the bloke.
Potter grins then, eyes still gleaming with annoyance, fingers only tightening around his arms. “I don’t think that’s going to work on someone you’re trying to apprehend, Malfoy.”
Draco wrenches away, not giving himself time to think as he hurriedly crawls backwards until he’s kneeling between Potter’s legs, ignoring Potter’s squawk of utter shock as he leans in close and rips his flies open, roughly dragging down his jeans and black boxers in one, heaving tug.
but held back with sheer willpower.
Lucius doesn’t reply at once, staring at his wife in wounded silence for a few beats. “I want to know why he’s here,” he finally says slowly, pointing at Harry as though it needs clarifying that he’s talking about him, “or I want him out of this house.”
Harry fitted their mouths together, pulled out and rammed back in, marvelling at his own self control, amazed at the fact that he hadn’t come all over the both of them already. His back ached and his left leg felt like it was about to go into a cramp. His injured side was properly hurting him again, the pain muted for the time being under the heat of his dangerously looming climax, Malfoy’s arse clenching mercilessly around him. Harry was
“Thank fuck I did,
“No,” Draco says at once. “The Room is fine. I’ll see you there at seven.”
Potter, still blushing furiously, scowls. “What the fuck have I been saying all this while, then?!”
Potter also doesn’t seem to be able to stop touching Draco’s belly; one or both hands constantly smooth over the hard bump, stroking down the curve of it and caressing it with what can only be described as reverence. He seems to be almost in disbelief that he’s touching Draco, touching his stomach, as is clear by the way he keeps breaking the kiss to gaze down between them at his own hands working gently over the bump.
She pats the narrow examination table against the far wall. “Up here, Malfoy? Robes open.”
The last dementor vanished and so did Harry’s consciousness.
“You are so welcome, Malfoy,” Potter says happily. “Did you see the chocolate I put in your room? These are from that shop too,” he adds, gesturing to the

“You know me.”
,” he replies sardonically. “There’s much to say about the quality of life after you’ve been bitten by a fucking werewolf. I throw a little one-man party monthly; you just missed this month’s. It was last night. Truly memorable.”
“I will come over there and fuck you if you don’t shut up,” Harry says smoothly, straightening up and draining his mug of tea as Ron accidentally breaks his and splutters indecipherably for the next three minutes.
“Just come and dance,” Harry growls and yanks Malfoy along by one elbow.
“I’m fine,” Malfoy says at once, but when he looks up at Harry, his lip trembles again. “I’m... I’m a fucking
The door to Malfoy’s old flat is ajar as Harry reaches it, the single light bulb in there about to die out by the way the weak yellow light flickers incessantly. It’s freezing inside and when Harry pushes in and glances around he sees that the window’s been broken, the glass glinting in jagged, dangerous looking shards. The floorboards are filthy and there’s a vile, putrid stench that gets stronger with every step he takes into the tiny room.
the time. I’m
“Harry,” Ron groaned. “Nooo--”
“And?” Ron had prompted, but Draco had merely shrugged. “Wait, you’re not going to threaten to tell us in horrific detail just how thoroughly that eejit fucked you all over his place last night?”
“Why are you still here?” Draco asks rudely. “Why haven’t you fucked off yet?”
I can’t help it; I reach out and lift a bit of his diagonal fringe off his face. He blinks, looking pleased, and throws an arm around my shoulders, steering me towards the others.
“Oh, unclench, Auror Potter,” Draco drawls, rolling his eyes and using a paper napkin to dab at his eyes. “I was joking. I did not use any special

you that saved us?”
Malfoy flushes but glares back defiantly at his father. “What we are doesn’t matter,” he says crisply, “What matters is that Harry found me when I wasn’t quite doing very well for myself and very kindly took me in.” There’s a single beat before, “He saved me.”
“That’s fair, I suppose.
There was a moon. James and Albus’ faced hovered above him, white and drawn and streaked with mud. They had all fallen.
“Since when do you fucking ‘date’?” Ron asks through a mouthful of beef, sparing me from asking the same damn question.
He blinks blearily around his room now, the sunset painting the room ochre yellow through the crack in the curtains, his brand new eagle owl — yet
“You look familiar,” he drawls as he comes up to me. “Have we met?”
“Won’t the effectiveness of the potion be compromised if you throw out the natural juices of the aconite?”
“Get out,” I say, and for the second time, turn around and walk away.
“But that night—” Harry starts, Malfoy’s gaze locking with his before they both colour slightly.
“Dad! Dad, Lily is...is...flying next to you.”
There’s still the question of what Harry wanted from him though.
so, so
Potter frowns. “It’s
Draco smirks. “Yes, Potter?” he teases, running the tip of his prick along the insides of his mouth but not licking or sucking.
“Never—never claimed otherwise,” Potter says breathlessly, lifting his bum obligingly when Draco drags his pants down and throws them back over his shoulder. “Fuck, should you be sitting on the floor like that? Do you want a...cushion?” he trails off at the cool, half-lidded glare Draco shoots him.
“For fuck’s sake, tell me this hasn’t got out,” Harry leans in and snarls. “D’you even know what might happen if he were to find out his parents were immediately taken in the moment they were found?”
“No,” I answer morosely, lifting my wand higher and immediately noticing a box I’d not spotted earlier. It rattles and makes pretty clinking noises as I pull it towards me. “I think this is it,” I open the box and find neat rows of beautiful little glass orbs, “Yep, found it.”
“Fuck you, you scrawny—”
Draco thinks it’s the perfect opportunity to discuss things, what with an actual Patronus in sight and all, but Harry must’ve detected something in Weasley’s tone that makes him quickly pull their things together and hurriedly lead Draco back to the castle.
Five minutes later, Draco is still thinking about the grin Potter had given him as he’d left his room. He’s waiting for him, Potter, his breakfast still untouched as he flips through the sports section of the Prophet, the daily news and gossip sections laid out next to Draco’s plate as usual.
Potter is in Draco’s kitchen. He’s waving his wand at a broken mug on the floor – Draco’s
“Thank you,” Potter interrupts softly, his gaze still burning but in a different way now; there’s suddenly something unimaginably tender in the vivid greenness and for a moment Draco is just left gaping at the honesty there.
“Ready?”
“Open that privileged,
“Malfoy,” Potter says, still craning around to stare at Draco.
Harry’s mouth didn’t relent, sucking on the hard nub until it was reddened and shiny with spit before flicking his tongue over it in swift, teasing strokes that had Draco keening and yanking on his hair again. Over and over those teeth scraped at his nipple, leaving it delightfully sore and perversely throbbing for more of the same treatment. And Harry obliged, loudly sucking on it until Draco’s spine bent inwards and he unravelled completely.
“See now,” Draco says airily, “
The ease with which the conversation flowed between them was un
“No.” It was a whisper, barely audible, but it was firm. “No. Don’t stop.”
“Come to the Burrow,” Harry says automatically. “Ron invites you every year anyway, you’ve yet to make an appearance. Mrs. Weasley would be really pleased.”
There’s only pin drop silence from the other side suddenly, and Draco’s heart climbs further up his throat.
“I don’t know.” Harry swallowed. “You sound upset.”
“Are you
“Did you say it back?” Seamus’ eyes are alarmingly wide. Draco just stares impassively at him for a few seconds before emphatically mouthing ‘woman’ at him. “You
“For staring at them or giving them to me in the first place?” Malfoy’s voice, soft in Harry’s ear, held a definite hint of a smirk to it.
Potter hitches the blanket up over one shoulder and, as he does so, Draco sees what must’ve been a horrifically painful scratch along the entirety of his left forearm. The scar is a stark scarlet and must’ve been deep judging by the way the skin has knitted together in a dark line. As the blanket shifts further, Draco sees that there are, in fact, several more scratches up his arms, some peeking out from under the neck of his t-shirt. There’s also another wound, brownish-maroon and gnarled, on his left shoulder, but it’s barely visible except for a small sliver when Potter shifts again.
.” He’s standing before his full length mirror holding a set of cream and gold robes up against himself and squinting slightly. “Do these wash me out, you think?”
They pick up the potions from the kiosk on the ground floor and then Floo back to Grimmauld, Draco immediately taking off his cloak and heading upstairs to his room, Potter staring after him, helpless and morose. He’s barely just taken a piss and washed up for dinner when the awaited knock sounds and Draco opens the en suite door and waves his hand from near the sink to let Potter in instead of just answering out loud.
Moody screamed back at him.
“You have some...” he murmurs, and without even thinking about it, Draco leans forward. Potter’s thumb swipes over his lower lip, wiping off the streak of chocolate on it which Potter then promptly licks off.
“Are you still mad at me?” asked Harry, tilting his head like a puppy.
Potter walks over, effectively cutting him off, and then Draco is looking at it right up front.
There’s a small flurry of movement from Malfoy next to him but Harry never takes his eyes off Lucius who’s looking as though he might just pass out from anger. His lips are pressed together in a white line and the thin line of his wrinkled jowl is quivering as he glares scorching hot draggers at Harry.
“Unpleasant, I’d say.”
Malfoy’s lip curls. “As much as I’d have loved to come here and be humiliated, I chose not to risk whatever self-respect I have remaining. Besides, it’s a pretty accurate diagnosis, isn’t it?” Malfoy nods towards the scrap of parchment again.
He kissed him hard and deep and vigorously, all at once, and Malfoy gasped into it as he immediately struggled to return it, pressing bound hands into his back.
Malfoy sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Okay, what do you want from me, Potter?”
Potter doesn’t dawdle now though — two and three fingers in quick succession, scissoring them inside Draco until he’s a shaking, drooling mess, and then Potter is swiftly slicking his cock up, sitting back on his heels and lifting Draco’s arse and placing it on his thighs. There’s a cool, slippery press against his arsehole as he lines the tip up, and then Potter leans over him once more, one hand braced next to Draco’s shoulder, his breathing ragged and hot in Draco’s ear.
at the memory of Potter’s tongue in his mouth after that; at the way Potter had made tiny, sweet sounds against his lips as Draco had emitted low rumbles that emanated from the very pit of his stomach, and held Potter’s head in place with handfuls of his hair and
Malfoy’s fists tremble where they’re clenched on the table, eyes narrowing to flaming flints, thin chest heaving. Something about the way he’s slowly swelling up, face draining of all colour, mouth starting to tremble, makes Harry go completely still, the hairs on his arms rising.
Harry opens his mouth but Malfoy beats him to it. “

.” He takes a step forward and Harry springs to his feet, wand in hand. Malfoy yelps in shock and struggles to his feet at once, grabbing Harry’s arm in a painfully tight grip and attempting to drag him back down.
Harry made an odd spluttering sound. “
“Mmm,” Draco smiles, “I don’t think
He props the card up on the vanity next to the newly filled bowl of chocolates, which Draco pauses to note, are from
“I always was, Granger, I’m a Veela by blood.” Draco sniffs haughtily, and Granger laughs. “What did Potter say about me?” he blurts out, not even caring that the gleam in her eye intensifies at his question.
He turns away hurriedly, carefully keeping his gaze averted, when he’s called to a stop not by Potter but—
“I’m just sorry about the whole evening,” Harry says, hopelessly morose. “The whole Ginny thing, manhandling you like that, fucking knotting you and now
Draco made an impatient sound through his own laboured breathing. “And what? You want to ensure everybody knows about us before we leave? Hold my hand in the corridors? Snog me at breakfast? Undress me and fuck me in front of everyone during dinner? Oh, shut up!” he said irritably as Harry’s grin grew filthy and he squeezed Draco’s arse as if in approval of Draco’s suggestion. “What do you want?” he asked on a sigh, combing the wild black fringe off Harry’s forehead and gently flicking the pad of his thumb over his scar.
“Challenge accepted.” Harry sat up, kicking the covers off himself vigorously and accidentally catching Baguette with one heel. “Shit, Baguette, I’m so sorry!”
“Rose petals, then,” Malfoy drawls, rolling his eyes and permitting Harry to kiss him for a few seconds.
“Why does Erickson want to see me?” Draco mutters, frowning down at the message scribbled down in Octavia’s appalling scrawl.
“Aren’t you worried that I might’ve—?”
“What do you mean, why?” Harry says gruffly. “It’s your birthday and the others aren’t here yet so I thought I’d dance with you.” He forces himself to release Malfoy and step away. “Unless you’d rather dance with someone else; go home with them perhaps?”
Draco clicks his tongue irritably, turning away without replying and walking back to the cauldron. The muslin has turned slightly translucent, damp and heavy with the absorbed fumes and steam. He carefully lifts it off and replaces it with another identical sheet of muslin, walking over to the little steel sink in the corner and wringing out the first sheet of muslin under the tap.
“For now,” says Harry.
He sticks a leg out as Potter walks past.
to seduce that sickening little slug. If your precious little boyfriend had remained faithful to you, he wouldn’t be in this situation now, would he?”
Harry himself looks absolutely gorgeous, Draco thinks rather broodingly. Even though he likely hasn’t combed his hair in a week, despite the clunky glasses he wears, his Muggle ripped jeans – none of it puts Draco off. Harry’s arms and chest are still lightly muscled, abdomen taut and flat, hip bones begging to be touched and licked.

uncivilised!” Draco shouts as he marches out.
Harry smirked, slow and smug, before once again pulling the covers off Malfoy, bringing it down his legs before placing his hand lightly on the inside of one calf. There was a sudden, deafening silence as Malfoy stopped breathing entirely. Harry let his hand brush, feather soft, against the flimsy pyjamas as he moved his hand upwards.
They panted softly at each other, Draco frowning, angling forward for more, and Harry pulling back gently with a small smile that clearly indicated that he had something on his mind.
“Aren’t-- Aren’t you going to talk me out of it?”
Harry stared at him, swallowing hard. After a moment he nodded. “She would.”
“You’re still hard,” Harry pointed out unnecessarily. “And you’re currently in no condition to—to take care of it.” Carefully, Harry traced one finger over the back of one of Malfoy’s hands, the plain white bandage slightly coarse but soft under his touch.
“The snitch?” said James, perking up as he always did at the mention of anything Quidditch-related.
“I’m so sorry,” he whispered. “We’ll get warmed up in a second. I’m going to find you a jumper and a blanket, all right?”
Draco opened his mouth and neatly sucked his thumb in, closing his lips around it and deliberately moving his mouth along the digit in a way that was transparently suggestive. Harry’s breath shuddered out of him as he watched, transfixed, as Draco lapped at his finger, nibbling at the square corners of his nail before sucking the length back into his mouth.
Harry grinned wickedly to himself. “Oh, I’d rather fuck

“He’s my plus one,” Harry says smugly.
“I—I...” Harry wanted to warn him that he was nearly there, he was nearly right fucking
“Dose number three of the week for Mr. H. J. Potter,” comes a bored voice from behind the counter, “Standard Wolfsbane, certified brew by St. Mungo’s. Here’s the bill – bring that back with you tomorrow or you won’t receive the fourth dose.”
“Alright, Malfoy?”
“Taken, I’m guessing.”
“Let go of my hand, Potter.”
Draco doesn’t pull away. This isn’t an odd thing for us.

“I will be this June,” Malfoy replies shortly, and when Hermione looks up expectantly, sighs and adds, “Fifth.”
When he glanced back over, Malfoy was watching him. Harry resisted the urge to flip him off.
“Fuck. Sorry.” I set my glass down and start fumbling for my wand.
“Why?”

anything, and Draco wants to ask him what he wants.
“Oh.” Harry blinks at him for a full ten seconds. “That’s convenient, I guess.”
My hands are already under his t-shirt, one hand skating up his narrow waist, the other heading straight for, what I know are, his very sensitive nipples, taking turns to tweak each one, turn by turn. He presses into me, squirming and squeezing me with his thighs, his mouth moving wetly against mine – until suddenly he pulls away.
Finally, he goes with, “There weren’t
Malfoy looked torn between irritation and bewilderment. “Do you ever actually
Although he very much doubts he has it in him to ever face Potter again, he can’t stand that he has to wait two whole days before he sees the bastard again. And he can’t help but wonder if they would find another stairwell to meet in on Monday.
“Oh?”
Malfoy is rigid and palpably incensed, and Narcissa looks utterly aghast. “That’s not what we’re here to talk about, Father,” Malfoy’s voice is low and full of warning, “and it is not a topic open for discussion either.”
your father; I’ve seen him actively engaged in service to Voldemort. But I would still not let him be thrown into Azkaban; not now. Not when—” he breaks off when Malfoy’s eyes widen slightly, lips parting and breath catching. He stares at Harry for a long moment, chest heaving in quick pants as his gaze, hopeful and expectant, flicks between Harry’s eyes.
Draco can tell that he’s close; his cock twitches vigorously in his hand with every punishingly hard suck Draco slurps around the head, spurting out thick strings of precome into Draco’s mouth as his balls tighten steadily in his hand.
Potter’s eyebrows slide up briefly but then Draco can’t think or act or speak or
Just over five months pregnant, he’s showing now, plainly and clearly visible through his clothes, and Potter simply does
To Harry’s pleasant surprise, Malfoy makes his way back to sit down beside him once more. Narcissa sits in the sofa chair adjacent to Malfoy, reaching out to cup his knee at once, and Lucius sits down on the sofa opposite Harry and Malfoy, tossing one leg over the other and regarding them with a hard, expressionless sort of curiosity.
Draco snorts. “I told you. I’m the only Slytherin staying back for Christmas. Well, except for that one fourth year, but I think she spends most of her nights stalking the Blood Baron.”
“No, you don’t, you’re just doing this as some sort of thoughtless favour!”
Then suddenly, quite literally in the span of a single second, Potter is scrambling away with a wild, horrified gasp, his hands and feet slapping onto the floor as he crawls backwards. When Draco turns around, startled and more than a little rueful at the abrupt disappearance of that greedy mouth, he finds Potter staring up at him with something akin to unbridled panic.
so I’m completely out of the way!”
“I’m your boss, you bint,” Draco throws back as he straightens his collar as turns to head back out.
He thrills in the element of domesticity that’s now bled into his life. No longer does he restlessly wait for mealtimes so he can see Potter, or carefully time how long he’s spent around Potter before he starts seeming too eager. He doesn’t have to mindfully keep his distance from Potter and can touch the sexy bastard as much and as often as he fancies. It also helps that Potter genuinely is fantastic company.
Potter’s face relaxes into a grin, and he leans back all the way, tilting his chair backwards and rocking indolently. “Malfoy,” he says, “you wouldn’t be standing there, alive, if I didn’t trust you. And it has little to do with the fact that you’re really quite
“Blaise, you fucking traitor,” Draco gnashes his teeth as he glares at Zabini who’s just pulled out another cold one for Ron.
“Are we friends with the bloke?” Ron asked weakly. Harry barked out a laugh before quickly clearing his throat.
are you doing? Where’d you go?”
They pulled away and Draco’s heart sang in his ears, his chest rising and falling as they beamed at one another, both of them completely out of breath, Draco completely out of words.
“Never again,” Draco moans, arching into his mouth, “never begging again.”
“I believe I interrupted some complaining?” Harry said against Draco’s lips when he’d pulled away. He sounded slightly smug.
Ron mutters a contrite
“I want to do this.”
It’s an absolute nightmare, living with Potter, honestly.
“And you just happened to be carrying those around with you?”
Malfoy’s glare slowly dissipates into just pure, resigned exasperation, and he throws his wand back down with a weary sigh. “I’ll put the kettle on,” he murmurs, ambling over to the kitchenette. He’s wearing pyjamas bottoms that ride a few inches above his ankles, and a long, faded, soft looking yellow t-shirt with a picture of a bowtruckle on the front, his glossy hair up in a small, messy knot, his creamy nape exposed and causing Harry’s mouth to flood with saliva. His perfectly arched feet are bare and soundless against the wooden floor as he fills the kettle and sets it on the hob, lighting it wandlessly. “I only have teabags,” he mumbles over his shoulder.
“No,” Harry says calmly, looking around once more, just because he cannot bear to look at Malfoy for too long – the urge to touch him rises inside Harry like a tidal wave.
Draco sighs, picking up his wand and dragging a hand through his sweaty hair. “I was seven and Father finally gave in to my relentless begging and bought me a Crup,” Draco says, rolling up his shirt sleeves and not looking at Potter. “She had black fur, was terribly moody and slept right on my chest most nights.”
There’s a quiet snort and then Harry’s mouth lands on Draco’s forehead, his quiet sigh barely ruffling Draco’s hair. “Am I still a good person, Draco?” he breathes, as though barely daring to ask out loud.
Draco sighs, rolling his eyes. “Yes. I placed my order in October and was apparently one of the last ones to.” He walks over to me, frowning. “Make him leave,” he says loudly, pointing to Ron.
“Oh, do stop sulking, you big
“Because you can’t let me stay with you rent-free, buy me exotic sweets every week
There’s nothing he could’ve done; Fate – unavoidable, and a real
“Shut up,” Draco replies and Potter chuckles, sitting down beside him and lifting one ankle onto a knee, arms slung loosely over his legs. He’s not bundled up like Draco is, although he
Ten minutes of Draco kneeling on the bare floor, just holding Harry, and a third helping of whiskey later, Harry sits there, pink-nosed and sniffling, Auror robes shrugged off and strewn messily over the sofa, his eyes bloodshot and puffy, smudged, tear flecked glasses abandoned on the coffee table. Draco sits pinned to him, one leg thrown across Harry’s lap, one arm around his shoulders while he rubs warm circles on Harry’s chest with his other hand.
“What seems to be the issue?”
come back.”
him, that he’s on his knees with his whole face squeezed in between Draco’s arse cheeks, his tongue painting sopping wet strokes over his arsehole while groaning blissfully into Draco like eating him out is the ultimate luxury life could provide him with. And Draco, in turn, moans like a dying walrus, reaches back to hold Potter’s head in place with a handful of mangy hair and pushes his hips back as much as Potter’s rigid hold on him allows, gasping and cussing against the polished oak of the door.
“Bedtime, I think,” said Harry. Malfoy nodded, getting to his feet and brushing crumbs off his clothes. Harry stood and crushed his empty beer can. Then he said, “Tomorrow, Malfoy, we start practicing.”
“Where’s Mum?”
“Are you ever going to acknowledge what happened?” he snaps, and Draco takes a step back.
Across the room Lily let out a shriek of rage at something Albus did and Harry sighed.
Harry blinks. “Um...”
“Haven’t you wondered about the monthly transformations?” Granger asks Draco, frowning lightly at Potter again.
Harry’s balls are tightly drawn up against his body when Draco finally lets them slip out of his mouth, nuzzling into the crevice between his spit-slick sac and heavily bobbing cock before finally moving up and straddling him, sighing softly and smiling down at Harry when he wrenches open his eyes to gaze blankly at Draco, heaving great big gasping breaths, eyes filled with nothing but mindless, aching arousal.
Deeming Harry suitably cowered, Malfoy turns back to his parents. “Potter and I have a lot to discuss and marriage is only
“What’s that?” Ron immediately cranes his neck, trying to catch a glimpse without actually getting up.

Draco narrows his eyes. “Like you wouldn’t believe,” he replies breathlessly, dragging Potter back in.
“For a stopover.”
“Because it’s dangerous, James. It’s really, really risky.”
“Yes, they are, I’m always wondering how to impre—” Potter breaks off abruptly, picking up the discarded menu and holding it up in front of his face.
“No.”
“Come in me,” Draco murmurs back, drawing him down into a kiss. “Come inside me, Harry.” His voice is barely audible over the
My brain is basically mulch at this point so I just take the nod for whatever it might mean and go ahead and take his cock into my mouth, pulling whatever I can fit into my mouth and applying tight suction, holding his hips down when he, as expected, lurches off the bed.
It’s difficult to focus with my head so full of him and my cock so hard but I manage to Apparate us onto his bed. We land too hard and he knocks his head into the headboard but doesn’t complain for a second – probably because I don’t give him a chance to; I’m already undressing him. I pull his t-shirt off with a single yank and his hair is left uncharacteristically messy. He’s always careful with his hairstyle, Draco. It feels good to leave his hair messy on the side where the t-shirt had dragged over his head. I reach up and muss up the whole mass of sleek, blond hair just so I can see him dishevelled.
for a fucking
Draco still has on his jumper, now bunched up around his chest, one pink nipple peeking out as he arches up off the floor, his mouth wet and gasping open with each press of Harry’s fingers inside of him. His hair fans out bright gold across one of the rich green, velvet cushions, his neck blotchy, and stippled with countless little crimson nips, lashes fluttering as his eyes roll shut.
“Dear god, I hope not, Weasley.”
“Kids bounce back real quick,” said Harry.
Shivering, Draco tries again. “But I’m—”
Malfoy sighed softly and with some difficulty, turned over onto his side, resting his cheek on one bound hand. “Go to bed, Potter. You need to heal.”
I think back to a few weeks ago when my days had been spent in a blur of wanting him with every aching fibre of my being, of feeling his absence like a gaping hole somewhere inside me. And now I have him, and I love him more than ever, and I’m making an utter idiot of myself because I can’t stop thinking about
“Shut up, then,” Potter says warmly, cupping his jaw and planting a wet smack to his mouth.
“Because we fucked?” Harry asks savagely.
“Malfoy,” Harry gets to his feet, raking a hand through his hair as he approaches him carefully, “Look, we’re...we’re sort of stuck together now, yeah? We don’t have to discuss the details of it right away but, fuck, we
“Did you even mean any of it?” Draco’s throat is so dry that his eyes start to prickle from the need to cough. He’s overly aware of the seriousness of this moment and doesn’t know why the urge to kiss Harry is so overwhelming when he’s trying to convince himself that he’s livid with the bastard.
“Thank you,” Draco says, staring at him curiously.

fucking
Draco grits his teeth, turning around and marching up to the room, pushing open the half-shut door and glaring around at the Golden Trio of the wizarding world.
The elf bows low and vanishes with a
There’s a sudden flurry of activity at the streetlamp-lit end of the alley where a small group of people exit the club, laughing and jostling one another, merrily drunk, as they stumble and sway over to the greasy spoon for bacon butties and chips. They hear the bell above the door chime as they enter the diner, the carols suddenly sounding louder, before the door shuts and there are just vague drifts of it over the sounds of their breathing again.
Malfoy went crimson, and then to Harry’s utter shock, picked up and hurled a large dictionary at him with a snarl. Jerking out of the way just in time, Harry gaped at a fiercely glaring Malfoy for a few seconds before getting up and walking over to retrieve the book that had landed a few feet behind him. He saw Ron get to his feet furiously, as if determined to come over and throw the book back at Malfoy, and shook his head swiftly with a grin.
“It’s my last week here,” Erickson snaps. “Have you heard anything?”
“You should eat something,” Draco whispers hesitantly into his hair after a solid twenty minutes of silence.
The elf looks at him much like the voice sounds. “Master Harry is being needing it for health purposes,” he answers politely anyway. “If young Master Black can be excusing Kreacher now?”
I freeze. Slowly, akin to a scene in a horror movie, I turn back around to see Draco in front of me.
Yes, he’s one of us now, lift your jaw up off the floor and no, don’t roll your eyes – it’s really not
Harry had visited Draco in the hospital wing the next morning, had silently seethed at the sight of his puffy, bruised face, the way he’d lain limp and unmoving as he’d stared impassively up at Harry through the one eye that wasn’t swollen shut. When Harry had asked him who the people responsible were, Draco had chuckled darkly and pointedly turned away from Harry.
Brushing Draco’s hair off his face, Potter carefully cups his cheeks as they kiss, their lips smacking wetly as he further deepens it, sighing over the soft rumble that sounds from the depths of his chest. Draco almost wishes that the Potter from the night before would make a reappearance, the one who had yanked at Draco’s hair and grabbed at him like he intended to devour him whole – Draco hadn’t been given much time or opportunity to process any of that while it happened; he’d just let Potter have his way with him and blissfully revelled in it. But now, this achingly tender way Potter is stroking Draco’s cheeks, sighing against his lips as he lets Draco greedily claim his mouth is somehow agonising to deal with.
for fuck’s sake – his expression completely shuttered, the carefully controlled impassivity sending Draco’s pulse racing even as his mind turns sluggish and
Draco slaps his hand away with a squawk, his cock automatically twitching against his thigh. “
“You both are such
The cracked groan of pleasure Potter lets out as Draco’s mouth descends around him is quite enough for Draco to go fully hard. Potter’s cock lengthens and hardens further in the insistent, hot suction of Draco’s mouth, the soft foreskin stretching and peeling off the head. Draco hums as the lets the crown slip into his throat for a moment, smirking around the hard thickness when Potter cries out and drops a hand into Draco’s freshly washed, still damp hair. Potter leaves his hand there, loose and undemanding, as Draco bobs his head steadily, slicking Potter’s cock up thoroughly, leaving it gleaming with spit when he sucks off to lick hungrily into the slit.
Atop the table, a two litre bottle of pumpkin juice lay on its side, its contents spread across the round expanse of teak, dripping off the edge at various points. The

“Wake him up.”

I stab him in the face with my elbow.
at Draco, her expression pleasant and open, and Draco doesn’t want to admit how that sight makes him feel slightly relieved. With a little effort, he forces his lips to curve upwards in what passes as a polite smile.
“And?”
“I’m not very surprised, either way. Spontaneous pregnancy with Harry Potter, who just happens to be an Alpha werewolf, who then moved me into his best bedroom and bought me everything galleons can buy before unwittingly knotting me – this is just my life now.”
“Malfoy,” Harry spoke very firmly, his gut assuring him that he was on the right track. “I’ll see you tomorrow, alright?”
“For whom?” Harry hisses poisonously, his thighs trembling now, balls pressed tight against his body, his whole form now thrumming with a preternatural force of some sort. For a moment, Harry feels a streak of fear amidst the blind, possessive hysteria that he’s bursting with. “
Harry lowered his head, unable to take his eyes off the spit-slicked lips. “I don’t want to stop,” he admitted, grinding his still covered cock into Malfoy’s bare erection just to emphasise
me so I don’t—”
“Is it his birthday?”
“They’ll find a way in, Potter.”
And then he’s prancing lightly out and back into the party, rolling up his sleeves that had slipped back down to his wrists, and I smile at the way the yellow light catches in his bright hair before I follow him.
“I actually came here to try and figure out if you really do feel about Harry, the way he feels about you,” Weasley says with careful consideration, “or if the whole thing was some elaborate plan you concocted so you have something to wave in Harry's face as some petty victory.”
“We’ve done...stuff,” I force out eventually. “And it was great, really. I’m—I’m talking about...going all the way.”
Spotlights or someth--”
But Harry just sighed softly, not answering verbally, instead sitting up and looking around wordlessly for his glasses. Shoving them on, he leaned over Malfoy’s come-sticky chest and reached for the jug and glass. The gush of the water being poured seemed overly loud in the silence between them.
“You did?” he asks, voice cracking. Harry nods. “Why?” he asks in genuine confusion.
so that when he slides a hand between them and grips his cock, he’s instantly exploding into a spectacular orgasm, messily coming all over the place with several wild bucks up against Potter.
Ron is silent for a long beat during which I watch Simon lean idly over the bar, grinning at something the bartender is saying. Then, “So... You
Carefully, and very slowly, Harry got to his feet, Albus being more of a nuisance than a help as he grabbed him by one arm and tugged.
But then Moody’s little head appeared from behind the fridge and he wiggled his nose at Draco, looking very pensive. Before Draco could even think up another insult to hurl at him, the ferret had scuttled out and over to where Draco stood.
to get me fired?” he hisses as he walks up to us a few seconds later. “I have other customers, you know.”
Draco lets his gaze sweep past the small, wrinkled elf and down into the long hallway behind it, his lip automatically curling as he takes in the dingy, almost completely unlit interiors. There are no signs of natural light entering the house anywhere and even where he stands, Draco can smell the musty stench of mildew that seems to linger about.
The snapped instruction made Harry shift into action almost automatically. He hefted his left knee onto the bed and swung his right leg over Malfoy’s calves, leaning forward and slipping his fingers under the waistband of the pale blue pyjamas. His hands paused momentarily and Harry used the second of indecision to glance up at Malfoy once more.
“MUM! GET UP!”
he is.
is something he can choose, actually. I mean, he does still have to be on Wolfsbane to suppress certain symptoms – that uncontrollable, aggressive rage, insomnia, tremors; there’s a list of those – but his Alpha gene means he can control the wolf in him enough that he doesn’t have to go through the transformations at all.”
Hermione tuts. “Isn’t there
me, you piece of shit!”
“Weasley, get the fuck out,” he says with a frown.
“It wasn’t,” Potter interrupts, not even raising his voice. He strolls a few steps closer and pauses in front of Draco, hands in his pockets. “It truly wasn’t. And I was practicing on a Boggart-Dementor which made the whole thing ten times as hard because I kept fainting.”
“Er...” Harry stares in utter bewilderment at the book before looking up at Malfoy, waiting for an explanation. “Um, I don’t want to read about who Morgana fucked, Malfoy,” he says lamely, when Malfoy just stares back impassively.
, why would you...”
Draco smacks his arm, then he kisses him – because he can now.
“This how you planned for your night to go, Malfoy?” Harry ‘s voice doesn’t even sound like his own as he murmurs against Malfoy’s throat, hunching over his back. “Is this how you pictured a fucking
We move simultaneously but it’s not a hard, messy clash of lips. It’s as though we’ve rehearsed this before. The timing is immaculate, the way our lips slot together is faultless. Kissing Draco still feels like a novelty and I greedily take more, slanting my face against his and kissing him deeply, not pulling away for a long, long time.

I smash my mouth against his, my teeth scraping over his lips still parted on that gasp, and sink my tongue into his mouth, one hand still holding him by the collar, my other hand holding his face in place. With my brain completely turned off, I kiss him so hard that he gasps again, his mouth automatically opening wider under mine, his lips easily slotting with mine.
“Well, he failed to mention any of this to me, Granger,” Draco says steadily; next to him Potter lets out a loud whoosh of air and Grangers mouth ticks up on a smile.
going to be starting you on some additional pre-meal potions, though, just a preventative so your digestion and bowel movements remain normal.” She pauses and lifts wry eyes when Draco splutters again, smacking a hand onto his face. “Relax, Malfoy. Your blood pressure is a tad high and you need to avoid stressing.”
you if—”
But then James’ eyes flattened, brow smoothing out. “She’s dead.”
This time when Draco knocks, it’s Potter who answers the door.
“Why?” Draco retorts in turn. “It’s—it’s not as if you’ve never seen me before.”
Draco blinked, secretly horrified that he was now actually
“Not everybody, no,” replies Harry, one corner of his mouth lifting slightly.
“He’s not lying,” Harry repeats more firmly. “Besides, that’s what we’re here to confirm, right?”
The same, shapeless cloud of silver mist he’s been producing consistently for the past week dissipates almost the moment it appears, and Draco just stands there, staring in irate frustration until he hears Potter’s soft sigh.
Harry tugged until his palm faced up, and continued to run one fingertip over the pink and white skin, Malfoy’s breath sounding a little shaky as Harry drew ticklish patterns.
Malfoy gasps, jerking. “I
Several minutes later, Draco
“We’ll find something tomorrow, I promise,” Malfoy muttered, reaching out and gently squeezing his hand.
Harry was careful to maintain impassivity. But Malfoy seemed to find his silence offensive anyway, and a second later he got to his feet, gripped his stupid gold sword and flounced off in a huff.
“Didn’t even ask,” he repeats. “Just left.”
“But then shouldn’t we save her? If it’s not safe there?”
Outside, Lily’s crying grows deafening and Draco abandons the rest of his socks before heading to the nursery. Lily is lying facedown on the plushy, yellow carpet, sprawled out much like her other father was a few minutes ago, and is sobbing loudly, blond curls in a loose mess around her head. She has on a diaper, one frilly pink sock and not much else and her small body heaves with each guttural sob.
For a moment, he genuinely believes that Potter’s going to pull his wand on him. The burning fury that flickers across Potter’s face is frightening in its heat and Draco’s hand involuntarily tightens on his wand.
“Yes, as a matter of fact,” Tristan chortles, wiping his brow with a fluffy white towel and throwing it over his shoulder. “Tristan Legrand.”
Neither of them has spotted Draco skulking behind the doorframe yet and so Draco carefully stays put, barely breathing for the terror that suddenly fills him making him instinctively grab the curve of his belly, his mind blank but echoing with a panicked shrieking of some kind.
“Er...” he twists around slightly to blink up at the unmoving pictures, “What in the world...?”
“You seeing someone, then?”
“I was
“Potter, you utter fucking twat, I’m
I think about it for days and weeks and months and years to come. He says those words to me again of course, always hesitant and self-conscious at first, until he grows into it and graces me with them regularly, consistently, like one might say hello and goodbye.
He thought of their kiss just the previous evening, the one after which Harry had said those things about... them, the promise ringing clear in his tone.
“Aren’t you guys called Solar Something?”
Draco fidgets a bit, feeling oddly guilty suddenly. “I don’t like to pry,” he says awkwardly. When Potter just shrugs a shoulder like it doesn’t matter, “It’s not like I don’t care about you, Potter,” he says without looking away. “I just don’t want to...invade your privacy. I’m already living in your house, rent-free; I don’t want to be someone you have to check-in with every time you leave the house or...justify going out to.” He finally looks away, Potter’s gaze on his face way too intense now. “I’m used to spending a lot of time indoors; I never did have too much reason – or money,” Draco adds with a tilt of his lips, “– to go out much, or people to go out with. You do, and you have no obligation to give me any explanations before doing so.”
I just lie on the floor, facedown, panting into the floorboards. I can feel my face radiating heat like an oven. My limbs feel stiff and clunky. My stomach is churning and I feel slightly dizzy even though I’d had only one glass of wine.
at Draco like it’s no big deal for him to be cooking breakfast in Draco’s kitchen after having, presumably, spent the night in Draco’s bed.

And no, I know what you’re thinking and I’m
“You hate being alone.”
“What do you
When he’d left, once again reminding Potter not to forget his daily doses, Potter said, quite suddenly, “So...I won’t be seeing you until after the next full moon?”
Malfoy looks flustered and angry again by the time Harry finishes, glaring at him with his lip curled. “Typical,” he hisses. “So what are you going to do about all that, Potter? Repair the whole building? Infuse it with some of your own excessive magic, perhaps? Obliterate Knockturn in its entirety?” His eyes flash for a moment before he sets his mug down. “Or perhaps you’ll throw me a bag of Galleons if I just got on my knees for you? Bent over for you, maybe?”
Finally, “How are you?” Draco opts to ask in reply. “How did this month’s transformation go?” he adds boldly.
“Yeah.” Potter shrugs again.
“I’m glad you liked it!” Goddammit, why is my voice still so fucking shrill?! Draco seems rather unsettled by my cheeriness as well, and simply smiles, looking rather pained. “Champagne?!” I half-shout.
“None of the Weasleys are ever going to harm you, Malfoy,” Harry says frowning as he rolls his eyes.
It’s not as if I’ve not seen him at all, though. Because that would have made getting over him easy. When have I ever been that lucky?
coming from?!” I finally manage and Ron grins guiltily before nodding towards Hermione.
“Harry.”
Ron sighs. “What did the idiot do this time?” he asks, sounding all patient and parent-y. “Did he hex your name-plate on the door to ‘Happy Potty’ again? He hasn’t done that in a while now.”
My brain is struggling to put together some of this information but I am completely blank as I just stand there and watch her stuff a set of pyjamas into a bag.
Slowly, their shoes soundless on the mown grass in the backyard, the four of them approached the house. Nothing moved inside and when Harry reached out and pushed the door further open, the creak it made had him stiffening and looking around nervously.
I lean forward and drag another box forward but inside there are just stacks of parchment bound into little piles with twine. When I peer closer, I recognise the tiny, neat handwriting.
. And Draco sometimes had to go to the loo and check if he had dried ketchup on his chin from when he’d been eating the chips that Goyle ordered that Draco had insisted he didn’t want.
And a tiny bit terrified.
Harry thought that maybe Malfoy might have tacked on an insult at the end of that sentence. But Malfoy, strangely enough, seemed the sort who wouldn’t swear in front of children. Harry couldn’t explain it, but he was sure of it.
Harry fought down the natural urge to snap at Malfoy that sprung up in him. “Yeah, sorry. I want to put together something soft that she can rest on. And get some chocolate in her.”
Like the fact that even several seconds of staring at each other later, Harry still hasn’t smiled at him.
He finally releases Draco’s hair but before he’s had a moment to process
“I’m still waiting over here for you to deny it, mate,” Ron says weakly and Hermione clicks her tongue.
“I’m not going anywhere,” Draco says stubbornly. “I don’t care if you and Father think I’m a fat lout now. Sorry,” he adds almost at once as he sees the hurt cross his mother’s face. “
it, you fucker!”
!” Harry squeaks hysterically, jumping to his feet and vigorously pointing at the plate of food. “
” my arms bend back with the weight and Ron suddenly lunges back to catch the bar, staggering backwards with a grunt, right into Draco who topples back with a startled yell.
Kreacher trots up at that point, laying a broad, creamy white envelope with a red and gold seal on it next to Harry’s bread plate; it’s easily recognisable and very familiar even before Harry carelessly turns it over and reveals the Ministry of Magic emblem.
“I will break up with you,” Draco assures him calmly, elbowing him away and sauntering over to where Ron is sitting sprawled out in the grass, choosing to sit on enormous square of blue and white instead of on the bare ground. “D’you want some cider or not?” he asks when he turns to find Harry still standing there sulkily.
Ginny’s face disappeared from sight as it bent over her.
“Well, if he’s gay, I’ll wear my tightest pair of trousers.” Malfoy was definitely smirking now and Harry had a feeling he fucking
Voice unexpectedly steady, he says, “I want to see you too.”
Clicking his tongue with the indulgent patience of familiarity, Draco let him press dry kisses into his hand before combing some of the hair out of his face. Cupping his cheek, he murmured a soft, “Get up, you stupid lump,” and tugged firmly as this time, Harry accepted his hand and hauled himself up to his feet.
Fingers tightening in Malfoy’s hair, Harry flattens himself against him, groaning into his neck as his hips snap, wild and unstoppable, the
Potter looks stricken as leaps to his feet, shoving his glasses back on and pushing his hands into his knotted hair, face bloodless and writ with shameful guilt. He just shakes his head again wordlessly, one trembling hand coming to close over his reddened, glossy mouth. Draco steps forward at once, almost tripping over the tangle of his pants and trousers, and just as he bends down to drag them back up there’s a crash as the doors fly open. He looks around, startled, and watches Potter hurtle away down the stairs without a backward glance.

sort of positive emotion, during that exact moment.”
so that he can revel in this feeling of being, quite literally,
“Who said she was drunk?” Harry chuckles, pulling his fingers out to a mournful cry from Malfoy, unbuckling his belt and pulling his flies open to gingerly pry out his poor, neglected cock, hissing as he eases the foreskin down and gives the shaft a swift little stroke.
“I’m calling from Solar Spotlights – the power of the sun, in your hands!”
The front door swung open. It wasn’t flung open with a dramatic crash like in the movies. It creaked open slowly but nobody appeared. Outside, the night was pitch black and abnormally cold.
Potter barks out a laugh. “You’re hilarious, Malfoy,” he replies lightly, scratching Caesar behind the ears so that the cat nearly falls out of his arms trying to lean further into his fingers.
Harry feels his face burn – and horrifically, his cock stir.
, of course, and it’s primitive and incredibly powerful and--” she sighed sadly, “I suppose now’s the chance for you to really get out there more, to look for someone.”
“I don’t know
She doesn’t look like she wants to humour me this time. “When, then?”
Almost dizzy with the need to come now, Harry gently brings Malfoy’s leg off his shoulder and eases himself behind Malfoy, hooking his elbow under his thigh and holding it up so he can continue pressing deep into his contracting arse.  Malfoy moans softly when Harry feathers kisses up his clammy nape, turning his head to kiss him hungrily, reaching back and fisting a hand in Harry’s hair.
“We were one hell of a duo,” Harry reminds him for the enth time. “
For then Harry descended on him, one arm winding around Draco’s waist and pulling, the Snitch’s wings fluttering against the small of his back, his other hand pushing into Draco’s hair as he crushed their mouths together.

Potter, however, looks completely unruffled. “Yeah, something like that,” he says, nodding as he watches his own hand slide down Draco’s flank. “It’s stressful, physically and mentally. I’m basically overpowering the most significant part of lycanthropy – it’s taxing.” Then his face falls again. “Even though I do stay human, some of the wolf’s more savage instincts do creep up. That’s why last night I—”
“GET AWAY FROM THEM!”

Instead he’d smirked and tossed his hair back over his shoulder as he said, “Well, of course you did, Potter, I’m scintillating company.”
around.
“Well, we can still try not to say fuck so much,” Potter says lamely, frowning a bit. “At least not in front of the baby.”
He moans something on a whisper – I think it’s my name – and it’s this barely-heard sound that clicks my brain back on; it clicks reality back on. I think of the fact that he probably whispers Tristan’s name like that; that he probably ruts against Tristan like this.
Harry turned. Albus looked a bit worried but mostly curious.
for the rest of his life.
“Mind if I nip into Quality Quidditch? I need broom polish.” I’m already walking towards the door.
Harry smiles ruefully into the dark. “Sorry,” he murmurs.
The fact that

“See, this is what I’m talking about,” Harry barks loudly and Malfoy starts where he sits, looking around at Harry in wide-eyed silence. “Grow

Harry frowned on a sigh. “Well, if
Harry rolled his eyes. “It was in the dead of the fucking night.” He sighed heavily through his nose as he was immediately assaulted with mental images of pale skin, blushing gloriously pink; that quivering, beautiful little arsehole; swollen, trembling hot mouth... “It was completely spontaneous, neither of us saw it coming but we did it anyway and he was very clear that he wanted it and now he won’t even fucking
Half a second before I open the door, I instinctively know he’s
“Malfoy,
Draco blinks as he kneels there in front of him, his own cock tenting his pyjama bottoms, wondering whether he should shrug and brush aside whatever the moron is apologising for, or whether he ought to milk Potter’s contrition for all its worth and make him suck Draco’s cock.

him, all right?! I’m—weren’t you listening when Hermione and I described in what condition he was found last time?!”
“No no, we’re on our way to Ron parents’, we just popped in to say hello,” Granger waves a hand through the air, “Harry, we’ll see you later. Shall we tell Molly you’ll drop by tomorrow for Sunday roast?” she adds hopefully, eyes wide and beseeching.
sake,
Suddenly Draco’s elbows were being tugged at, prompting him to drop his arms and let Harry take his hands, guiding them behind himself. Face heating immediately, Draco slowly gripped and parted himself for Harry’s perusal, because Harry Potter was also shockingly filthy and it was probably one of his top three traits, in Draco’s top-secret opinion.
Harry releases him as though burnt, stumbling back with a shuddering exhale, watching Malfoy rub his wrist and bare his teeth at Harry. “I’m—I’m
“Well, it may well have been a contributing factor, Harry,” she says, nodding. “We can’t rule it out.” She falls silent for a beat, watching Malfoy closely. “Why the suppressant?” she asks.
But Harry didn’t want to go away. Harry wanted—oh fuck, he
“How does anybody know anything, Potter? If and when they come back, I will deal with it then.”
But Harry pulled his fingers out, gritting his teeth as he watched Malfoy’s hole clench emptily once he was out, slick and gleaming in the dim light.
“What’s wrong?” Harry asks warily as Malfoy comes to stand before him, chin high and nostrils flaring, his whole form shaking with the sort of tightly suppressed fury that’s likely to wreck utter havoc when it, inevitably, explodes.
I head down the corridor to my bedroom, leaving him standing in the living room with his eyes like flints. And then he attacks.
“We do?” Harry’s voice is low and gruff and before Draco can reply, he’s leaned in and kissed Draco square on the mouth, tongue and all.
“Fuck off, Potter,” he kicks me lightly in the shin. “And I promise I won’t disappear on you again – not until I’ve secured a nice, tight arse for you to fuck through the night.”
The way he said it sounded like a dismissal. But Harry didn’t move. He stood and stared at the sword.
“It’s all right,” Potter repeats, pulling the t-shirt over his head. “’s not as bad as it looks.”
“Shit, why won’t you all just leave me
Harry was surprised – not that Malfoy’s wife had wanted to teach him tricky magic but that Malfoy would admit to it at all. Malfoy’s words hung between them, getting heavier every second because...
“Harry!” Draco barely has to raise his voice to call out before Harry is ambling in hurriedly, scooping up a very naked, wet Scorpius over one shoulder – Scorpius shrieking happily and beating his small fists against Harry’s back – and extending his other arm to take Lyra. “You’ll take them both?” Draco asks, carefully tucking their daughter into the crook of Harry’s free arm. “Thanks, love, I’ll just be five minutes in the shower.”
?” Potter looks completely thrown. “What do you mean locked?”
That whole evening had felt like a dream to Harry.
Draco doesn’t think about how he feels more disappointed than relieved that Potter is about to put some clothes on. But the next second, he isn’t thinking about anything at all. Potter tugs the towel off and when Draco catches sight of his left shoulder, his mind just goes blank with horror.
Their voices fade out again as I discreetly look back around, trying to locate Draco and his ‘date’ before I realise they’ve disappeared completely.
as Harry calmly resumed brushing his teeth, green eyes twinkling with mirth, irritating Draco even more.
“Why would I?”
Screaming, Draco comes again, pulsing hard down Harry’s throat, his balls throbbing painfully where they’re drawn up against his body. Harry doesn’t stop sucking the whole time, only pulling off with a rueful smack when Draco drags him off his softened cock.
. At least they’ve drained most of the pus out and he’s on anaesthetics so he’s not in pain.” Then she frowns, looking uncomfortable. “It’s...sweet of you to want to check up on him even though he...you know. He can’t talk with his mouth full of those boils, or whatever they are.” She shudders, “but I’m sure he doesn’t have much to say for himself, nonetheless.”
Unlike a real gold Snitch this one was silver, and had tiny wings, also silver, that didn’t flutter. Inside the shiny, spherical ball, he’d found the cufflinks he’d pointed out to Pansy one evening, several weeks ago, as they’d flipped through that month’s copy of Wizarding Elite in the Eighth Year Common Room. Harry had sauntered past with a derisively snorted
of posters – all Muggle – around the room,” he shakes his head, dimples flashing as he grins, “Most of them had Permanent Sticking Charms on them; took me weeks to fight them down. I’d have left them up but they’d turned mossy and smelt godawful. I left these up to honour Sirius,” he adds waving his hand at the posters above their heads. “Cleaned them up best I could. Wanted to keep a bit of him around,” he says wistfully, blinking myopically around the room with one hand still on Draco’s belly.
“Oh.” She looks at me, eyes very wide. “So you...don’t know that he...?” When she trails off and waits I just shake my head. She looks dreadfully ashamed. “Simon’s had...a sort of accident,” she says. “He... He had—He was with some bloke last night.” She says it bluntly. “He’s managed to tell the Healers what happened – I guess he wrote it down for them. His mouth and—and—” She turns red and clears her throat. “And his...bum—they’re...well—They’re infected with something. They don’t know what yet.” She sighs, looking worryingly close to tears of embarrassment while I digest the information. “One Healer mentioned it might be a dark curse of some sort. I suppose that’s what one gets for spending the night with some charva you meet at a—”
“It’s fucking
for this—“Wish I could just
Malfoy took a few seconds to answer. “Yes... Alright, Potter.”
“Charming.”
“What?”
“Okay, I’ll answer for you,” Ron says. “He’s never been in love before you. And he’s been in love with you for
“Exactly,” Potter says pointedly. “While all along, I’ve been asking you to focus on the
He notes the way Harry’s nostrils flare, the way his lips thin, an angry frown creasing his brow for a moment before his face smooths out again.
Weak, breathy moans sound as Harry marks Malfoy’s throat some more, sinking his teeth in and viciously sucking blood up until his skin stands out in mottled red and purple. Malfoy gasps, arching high, pressing his chest into Harry’s mouth as he sucks on tight, pebbled pink nipples, pulling the reddened tip in between his teeth and flicking his tongue over the throbbing nubs until Malfoy is sobbing with each helpless jerk of his body.
Harry stood up. “Malfoy, I’m making your kid some porridge. Problem?”
Harry seems to make a visible effort not to lose his temper, his jaw clenching so tightly that Draco hears it click; he hasn’t shaved in a few days now, and has thick stubble that has left deep red patches on Draco’s skin all over – Draco never heals them.
The first lap is laid along the entirety of Draco’s crack, a long, thorough lick with the flat of his tongue, then another, this time running all the way up to his tailbone. Then Harry pushes his face into the moistened groove with a throaty, slightly lewd groan that’s nearly Draco’s undoing by itself, and tickles his arsehole with the very tip of his tongue.
Malfoy’s shoulder moves in something resembling a shrug. “Well, you didn’t mean to, so...” he trails off and sighs before slowly settling one hand over Harry’s on his stomach as there’s a slow, tumbling roll inside.
managed to get under his skin with next to no effort. “Amortentia,” he said.
“I don’t think they’re wrong in expecting the grooms to be on time for their own wedding, Potter,” Draco sighs, managing to smooth her robes down
It’s with that mental image that I get completely shitfaced and pass out on the sofa, the twinkling lights around the window frames the last thing I see.
“Nowhere,” Potter mumbles, scratching his head and looking miserable.
“Well, it took a while to learn how to overpower the wolf,” he chuckles, gently fiddling with Draco’s earlobe. “I went through my share of transformations, yeah; almost a year’s worth.”
Grinning at Draco’s haughty sneer, Harry gathered him up in a sudden tackle and kissed him deeply. Simultaneously attempting to pat his hair into place, Draco kissed him back with a low hum, pushing his tongue in under Harry’s and gently nibbling on his lower lip.
He looked around and spotted three enormous fireplaces set into the far wall. Gently prying Lily’s hand off him, Harry made his way over and inspected them. Deeming them clean enough not to produce clouds of dirty smoke, he conjured fires in all three of them and added a barrier to keep the kids from getting too close.
Granger silences him with a loud sigh. “Harry’s an Alpha wolf,” she says bluntly, darting Potter another frown before dipping her quill into the inkpot and resuming her scribbling.

“I would
“Nice.”
“It’s supposed to rain today; and all night. I thought it might be more comfortable indoors.”
Potter nods thoughtfully, taking a bite of toast. “Yeah,” he says, voice muffled as he sprays crumbs across the table, “I used to let the team gain a head start of at least ten goals before I looked for the Snitch in earnest; used that time to watch the opponent Seeker and note flight patterns and stuff.”

“Don’t make a noise, Papa’s sleeping,” he chides softly, handing Scorpius an oven mitt shaped like a dragon’s head when the boy reaches for the whisk with a growl of rage. Scorpius immediately stuffs his hand in and pretends to ‘bite’ off Harry’s nose with his fingers in its soft ‘mouth’, while Harry solemnly stays in place for it.
“Hello, you two,” she says, all warm smiles and kind brown eyes, shaking ash out of her hair. “How are my boys today?”
But now Harry is screaming too, flinging Draco higher up the bed with the force of his final few thrusts, and then Draco can feel the wonderful, hot splash of Harry’s release inside him, sobbing even harder now as he turns his face blindly to seek Harry’s mouth.

Malfoy looked at him, shrewd and arrogant. “Albus Dumbledore’s wards will never break, they say.”
“Because I will,” Malfoy says and Harry’s breath catches in his throat. He stares in silence until Malfoy adds, “I’ll choose
“There’s nothing I’d enjoy more than taking you down, you overconfident ginger git.” Draco smirked as Weasley’s sister sang a low
“Nothing,” he says at once, mouth curving into a dead, thin-lipped smile that makes the hair on Harry’s nape stand up. “I can find my way back just fine if you have plans with your girlfriend.”
Maybe it’s the stubble, Draco thinks quietly now, watching discreetly as Potter lifts a hand to let Granger’s friendly little otter butt it’s silvery head into his palm before streaking off to her again. Potter’s nearly always wearing a very light stubble, like he can’t be bothered to put much thought or effort into his shaving spells. Maybe it’s the way Potter’s smile doesn’t very often reach his eyes anymore, although these smiles
“I mean, I came close--” I start.
that fills the club. “And
“I hate you,” Draco breathes blankly, burying both his hands into the wild mane of ebony again. “You’re such a prick.”
“Malfoy.”
And then Potter moves forward, but it’s not with the intent of touching Draco, apparently, for he just strides in, crowding Draco, backing him up against the double doors and, well, then he
The look of disbelief Malfoy shoots him serves to make Harry snap out of it some – just slightly. “Excuse me?” Malfoy dips his head, looking at Harry as though he’s the dumbest, most obtuse half-wit alive. “Your cock is soft?” he repeats, one eyebrow hooking upwards. “Is that a completely unnecessary observation you’re sharing with me, or do you genuinely not know how sex works?” When Harry continues to stare with his mouth hanging open, he declares hotly, “You came
“No, it’s a stupid
Draco leaps to his feet, sending his chair toppling back, and throws his napkin onto his empty plate. “Remind me when I asked for your opinion on my physical appearance?” he spits loudly.
We cheer in loud bellows as Draco’s dart hits the bulls-eye and he turns around, crossing one ankle behind the other and bowing jauntily.
“I guess,” he finally says, shrugging. “I suppose a lot of events will be celebrated like that now – first winter after the War, first Christmas, first spring.”
“Are you done staring like a fucking pervert?” Malfoy hissed. “Do you mind going back to your own fucking bed? Or, since you can’t seem to stop staring at my fucking crotch, do you plan to help with that situation too?” His mouth curled into an ugly sneer.
Malfoy’s nostrils flared, mouth thinning. “I appreciate your generosity; I really do. But I’m all right.”
Potter grins crookedly, leaning back against the armrest and throwing an arm across the back of the sofa. “Go on, then,” he challenges, “pay me a compliment, Malfoy.”
“You’ve preserved all the

“Is it because I’m engaged to Theo?”
are you selling torches for a living, Malfoy?!”
Harry’s prick jumps again.
“Thanks. How’re you feeling?” Malfoy asks calmly.
“All right, James,” said Harry, “Give me your hand. Are you and Lily holding hands?”
, leave alone flinch or yelp.
From what Harry could tell, the whole village seemed deserted. The quiet surrounding him wasn’t the sleepy quiet of early morning, but the dead silence of a place uninhabited. Not even birds seemed to be around to sing anymore. When he scanned the skies there were just puffs of clouds and thankfully no dementors.
“Are you feeling quite alright, Potter?” Malfoy asks quizzically. “Move in with you? Why, because I’m pregnant with your child? Because it’s something akin to what’s
He brought Lily a little bowl of dry Froot Loops to munch on. He checked the fridge one last time and threw out some old pudding cups. He tore off all the pictures of the kids they had up on the fridge and put them in his pocket.

“Ambitious,” Malfoy mutters against his cheek, shivering as he nuzzles him. “I’m definitely in. So, can we
“No.” I grab him around the shoulders with one arm and vigorously muss his hair up. He curses loudly through reluctant laughter, bent at the waist as he walks backwards, trying to escape my grip.
He expects some resistance: an offended huff and a murderous glare maybe. But all Potter does is bite his lip and fumble with Draco’s flies. Draco is so surprised that he doesn’t even pause to marvel at the desperation with which Potter pulls his cock out and sucks on the head.
“Harry,” Draco says again, quite at a loss for words already.
“One of these days, you’re going to come home and find him gone, I swear to Merlin,” he threatened. But it didn’t sound as morbid as he’d hoped because his arsehole was still clenching and his cock was trickling a final drop of come down his shaking thigh and Harry was running large, calloused hands all over him. “And maybe I’ll kick
“I don’t think she’s the one who has a problem with it,” she replies, leaning forward with a crinkly smile to stroke Lyra under her chin. “You are aware that your father and I have had regular intercourse for over three decades now?”
The teacup rattles noisily on its saucer as Potter sets Draco’s tea beside his place. “Um,” Potter’s voice is rather high, “That’s okay, Malfoy. I got them for you. Kreacher said he’d put a Stasis over them so they’d stay fresh for however long it takes you to finish them.”
Harry leaned back in his chair, eyebrows raised. When Malfoy continued to stare fixedly into his textbook, Harry asked softly, “We’re not?”
Harry supposed it was when one is five.
“Why?”
“He was asking for it,” I spit. “He’s vile. You never saw it.”
“Seeing as you’re no longer officially employed with the DMLE,
But Harry just shakes his head vigorously, sobbing great, heaving sobs into Draco’s shoulder, bent over at the waist as he clings to Draco. It’s with some effort that Draco swallows his own tears – he’ll never get used to this, never know how to deal with it when Harry cracks like this.
“You just left last week,” Potter reminds him like a great, big oaf. Like Draco doesn’t remember the weight of disappointment in the pit of his stomach as he’d stolen one last glance at Potter and walked out.
Maybe it had been sometime around the second week of Auror training, when Potter had politely requested Draco to budge over so he could reach the pot of tea in the break room, and Draco had automatically snubbed him and asked him to take his orphaned arse elsewhere. The tips of Potter’s ears had turned red, the slow spread of rage making Draco’s skin tingle with anticipation even as regret had bloomed in his chest.
Draco smiles unexpectedly. “You’re lucky I’m in such a good mood, you ginger wazzock. Or I’d be wrapping up your bollocks in a little red ribbon right now for Granger to put in a jar on the mantle.”
“I did it because I
Potter’s teeth scrape over his nipple and Draco throws his head back and howls, quivering as he catches his breath and blinks down at him in heaving shock to find him slanting Draco a sly little look. “So come,” Potter says simply, teasing the peak of his nipple with the very tip of his tongue.
Draco colours slightly. “As compared to...this morning,” he admits quietly. “And last month,” he adds, remembering.
Hermione just sighs, shaking her head irritably before opening two different files. “Malfoy,” she starts carefully, “were you going to tell me about...a certain suppressant you’re on?”
the next day, a panel of pictures splashed across the front page – Malfoy wiping his cheek outside Honeydukes; the two of them garbed in formal dress robes, Harry holding out his hand for Malfoy to take; the two of them desperately stifling their laughter as they’d spun together in the Great Hall, dancing with a sort of grace Harry wouldn’t have believed possible if not for the photographic proof in front of him.
Draco is
A faint line appears between Potter’s thick eyebrows and his mouth tightens a touch. “Why?” he asks quietly.
He was wearing his tightest pair of boxer briefs and Draco could clearly see the promising bulge of that magnificent cock of his, and he had one hand in his hair messing it up
“—and we’ll even give you a free pouch along with--”
Frigid grey eyes snap up to his and Harry hurriedly abandons his statement, pursing his lips and watching Malfoy shred tissue after tissue in staunch silence, the little pile of spontaneous confetti between the salt and pepper shakers and the grimy bottle of HP sauce gradually growing.
“So, what gives?” Draco sucks syrup off the pad of his thumb. “You pull this weekend?”
Harry nods sombrely. “Repeatedly, and to no success.”
“I’d love to,” Draco had blurted before, his cheeks burning, hurriedly adding, “I’d love to
Granger seems on the verge of giggling. “The head actually measures half the length of its body,” she says, pointing out with her forefinger again. “Your baby is no bigger than a kumquat right now,” she beams, “but he seems pretty happy in there, doesn’t he?” She turns, still smiling widely, to Potter, who is still just standing there, arms akimbo, lips turned inwards, jaw clenched and eyes over-bright.
be real.
“Have you ever actually even
“It doesn’t make a difference, alright?” I sound tired to my own ears. “It doesn’t even matter.”
“Nothing!” Harry laughed softly. And then quite out of nowhere, “I wanted to kiss you back there in front of everybody like I’ve wanted nothing else.”
“She offered to teach me once,” said Malfoy. “But I knew I’d be rubbish.”
Draco keeps his hand firmly by his sides, fingers curled so tightly around the sheets that he can feel his nails digging into his palms even through the cotton. He swallows over and over again, muffling any sound that tries to rise up from somewhere in his stomach where he can already feel a tight ball of heat gathering.
“I’ve read plenty of books, thanks.”
Harry can feel Malfoy’s breath against his cock, quick and warm, as it huffs over his shaft. Malfoy’s thumb lazily traces the ridge under the head, before pressing in an unhurried slide down the bulging vein, all the way to his balls. “Wow,” Malfoy whispers suddenly, lapping away a little bead of moisture that leaks out, wrapping his hand around and drawing the folds of his foreskin down. “Consider me impressed, Potter.”
of us have work to do, you know?!”
Harry splutters wordlessly for several seconds. “
Draco is in absolutely no mood to entertain sub-department fraternising. The serene calmness with which he’d started off his day and left Grimmauld Place had worn out around midday, leaving in its wake an incessant, anxious gnawing in his stomach that’s yet to go away. He’s spent the day thinking about (worrying about) Harry, what he might say about what Draco did, and what that whole talk might lead to. He’s restless and uncertain and above all, misses Harry terribly.

“Shut it, or I’ll come rub Snorkack shit all over you.”
“Only
That is until Malfoy’s hands fly up into his own sweat-heavy blond locks, his eyes rolling back into his head, his mouth sagging wide open as he garbles, “Potter, please,” bucking up ineffectively under Harry’s heated weight.
The stands exploded.
Then, with one final shaky exhale, he’s stepping inside and shutting the door behind himself, effectively locking himself into a room with a (with
Harry rolls his eyes, setting Malfoy’s trunk down with a

read the other boy. His actions, his words, eagerly invited Harry in; his expression, however, was completely shuttered and that set Harry on edge.
Malfoy smiles, jerking his cigarette with his thumb to flick ash off the end. “It’s our thing, Potter,” he says simply.
“Then you’re going to be better than any other man he’s ever been with.”
“Potter, how did you find me?” Malfoy asks suddenly, eyes narrowing to slits, head tilting slowly. “Nobody knows where I--” he breaks off, realisation dawning, “You tracked that owl,” he hisses.
for this when I started my day, Potter.”
“Are all of you like this?”
To his irritation, Caesar doesn’t gallop out at once like Draco had expected him to. He lounges against Potter for a while more, nuzzling into his neck and rubbing his head against his face, before finally stretching tightly, flexing his miniscule little toes out, and hopping lightly onto the floor, slinking out after rubbing against Potter’s ankles in a figure eight.
“Yes, Harry,” Hermione sounds just as exasperated. She taps impatient fingers against the ladder I’m perched at the top of, my head and torso inside the musty smelling attic. “The box of ornaments my mother gave me isn’t here. That’s the one we’re missing.”
Harry blinked. Malfoy’s head was thrown back and he could only see the pale triangle of the underside of his face. He was writhing lightly, and when Harry lifted his hand off him, he continued to writhe, shifting restlessly in a way that made Harry bite his lip as he watched.
Malfoy sits with his back very straight, hands clasped in his lap. He’s bundled up in a cloak, his hair swept into a tight knot behind his head and he barely returns Harry’s smile, seeming preoccupied as he watches the Harpies over Harry’s shoulder.
To his disgruntlement, Potter doesn’t even seem to care about having been banned from Draco’s lab; Draco really shouldn’t be rewarding him like this with more shamelessly enthusiastic snogging.
“Leave the cleaning to the elf, darling,” says Narcissa. “You ought to go to bed.”
“We’re in
And I’m thankful because... he’s
“What the fuck does that have to do with anything?” Malfoy asks flatly, tossing his specs down.
“And you left anyway.”
They entered the clearing to find all three boys crouched around Lily who was now sitting up and staring back at them in confusion. When the two men walked up, they got to their feet and Lily reached for Harry.
“Goodnight—oh, and Malfoy?”

“I’m not,” Harry replies at once. “Well, not yet anyway.” He squints slightly, pushing his glasses up his nose and blinking as Malfoy finally comes into proper focus, his expression one of wry amusement. “What’re you—what’re you doing here?”
, could they? – then she ought to be with her family.
Harry wound his fingers in the soft hair at the nape of Draco’s neck, gently tugging until his throat was bared and his breath was audibly hitched. “Really?” He brushed his lips over Draco’s – once, twice; barely-there touches that made him whine and pull against Harry’s grip on his hair.
“As compared to?” Harry asks softly, tilting his head.
what’s about to happen, never comes; all he feels is a sense of profound gratefulness that it’s finally happening.
“Yes, well, I broke his grandfather’s antique Pensieve,” Draco snorts. “Frankly, I’m surprised he didn’t make up a more vicious story.”
him, smacking his palm down over his arse so hard that the cheek wobbles deliciously and the crack of the strike resonates around the confined space they’re in. “
I look at them helplessly, not knowing how to tastefully reveal that we’d got off together by simply rubbing against each other, like teenagers, once; and that Draco had sucked me off in the loo at the pub once after that and I’d nearly
as fuck as it used to be?”
Moody looked extremely startled. He’d apparently been arranging and burrowing into Draco’s robes and when he was suddenly exposed he went completely still, sitting up on his haunches to stare up at the floating fridge and then at Draco who stood there, panting and red-faced.
“Are you lot still not done poking your big, Gryffindor noses into my private life?” Draco hands me my plate with a scowl. I take a tentative bite of the rich cheese-stuffed filo pastry and moan at the wonderfully decadent sweetness that gushes over my tongue. “Good?” Draco grins, helping himself to a slice and then sinking into the spare chair, toeing his shoes off and putting his socked feet up on my desk. He hums around his first mouthful and then positively fellates his fork as he sucks the syrup off of it.
“And me,” said James.

Weasley struts forward, pushing into Draco’s personal space and huffing hotly into his face, one grubby finger stabbing at Draco’s sternum. “Listen here,
Albus was blinking around, looking astonished at finding himself outdoors. James sat up, unruly hair flattened on one side, and stared up at the sky with his mouth slightly open. Then he looked down at the spot next to him.
Potter’s expression is still careful, considering, like he’s trying to figure something deceptively simple out, but there’s a new softness to his face suddenly, the cool distrust slowly vacating.
“How about I ask him to join us all for a pint the next time I spot him at the gym?” I ask casually, Draco immediately scowling at me as I sidle up beside him and rest one elbow on the bar.
“No, but I hadn’t planned on denying it in case they inferred,” Potter ticks him a small, casual smile. “Why don’t you want them to know about this?”
Draco spluttered quite vigorously and was certain that he’d unintentionally spat on Harry. “What? Why?!”
“Shove off, Malfoy,” Ron says loudly, while Harry splutters and tries not to die of embarrassment. “Go annoy someone else, it’s too early on a fucking Monday to look at your pointy mug.”
“I’d like to leave now,” Draco says, completely mortified. “Mother, for Merlin’s sake,
