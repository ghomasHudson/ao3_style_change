Harry went back to his tea and tried not to think about Draco Malfoy currently being in his room. He wondered which bed he had actually taken, it wasn’t as if they were clearly marked out as whose was whose. Ron and Harry bought nearly everything they owned at the same shops or were hand-me-downs from his brothers. The idea of Malfoy in his bed sent a small shrill down his spine that he told himself was unease.
As they climbed the shallow steps, the crooked door straightened and the grungy blue panels blossomed into eggshell. Harry pounded on the door.
Still, the idea that he was cracking through that scaly Slytherin shell was heartening. A smile tugged on the corner of Harry’s mouth. “You know that also means you’ll have to spend more time with me.”
Draco began to pull out of his grip. “We need to clean.”
Robards rolled his eyes with even more exaggeration than before. “Oh how kind of you,” his voice dripped in sarcasm. “At least we got him. I have a feeling this wasn’t the only sensitive information he passed along. Hope he likes joining his father in Azkaban.”
The petulant crease of Draco’s brow made it clear he wanted to argue but it was only for the sake of arguing at this point. Harry made good points. The building didn’t bother Draco all that much and it would give them both some peace of mind. Draco didn’t think he could go back to the days of dreading every sound he heard outside the door.
Harry shook his head, trying to wipe the grin off his mouth with the back of his hand. “I’m not laughing at you, I’m just amused.” Draco’s frown only deepened. That had not been a proper answer. Harry relented, “I’m
“It’s not like it’s the first time,” Harry shot back. “She couldn’t keep up with me in Potions sixth-year either.”
Harry’s eyes had locked with his. Horror swept away on the back of mischief. A crooked smile peeled over Harry’s mouth, and then his hand ran wildly through Malfoy’s hair, shaking loose any previous form it had.
“What?” Zabini snarled. “Going to kill me? If you can’t have him, no one can, is that it? Maybe you don’t deserve him either then.”
Home.
“Don’t worry,” Pansy assured, seeing Draco’s guilt swim in his eyes. She looked over her shoulder where Heather was frothing their drinks. “Heather was there for me.” She turned forward again, a soft flush budding over her cheeks as she looked back at her cup. “I’m actually really happy everything worked out how it did.”
Everyone began to flap around him, trying to get him to lie back down. Hermione and Draco each grabbed a hand and held him down. “You can’t move,” the healer spoke urgently. “You’re too weak. We’re still not entirely sure what you were hit with. You could faint if you move too much.”
"I don't know. Why don't you ask him?" Malfoy spat. Ron took his suggestion and lifted his wand towards Skeres. "Not here, you bloody fool!" Malfoy roared. "He's trying to kill me. At least untie me so I can defend myself!"
Harry slapped open a file more forcefully than necessary, not looking up. “I left.”
Harry shook his head. “Pansy works for the Prophet, I’m sure she’s been able to keep a few things out of the paper.”
“Who is it?” Harry said curtly. He already hated whoever it was on principal for interrupting them.
Harry’s smile faltered.
Harry ground his teeth. His voice was audibly strained as he attempted to speak with as much civility as possible, “Please just watch out for your children. Some discipline-”
Andromeda looked at the boy oddly, opening her mouth to instinctively deny. “Actually,” she said, turning back to the cupboards, “I do. My sister just sent me some a little while ago.” She picked up a yellow tin that Harry recognized well. “I haven’t even opened it,” she muttered more to herself.
“Fine, get yourself to the sofa, then, Mr. Smiley,” Draco huffed, returning Harry’s arm.
Draco became as still as board. His whole face smoothed. “Everyone knows what?” his voice was forcefully calm, riding the edge of splintering.
The rumbling heat in Harry’s chest momentarily cooled to a comforting warmth as he looked at his friend. He really shouldn’t have expected anything less.
“I see what you really meant earlier is that you really missed vexing me.”
Draco’s brows pulled together, his lips tugging down.
Draco scoffed loudly. He crossed his arms over his chest. “You sent Weasley to my flat last night. Honestly, you should have at least sent Granger. At least she can make a logical argument and not some fabricated emotional rubbish about you needing me.”
His stranger was not spoiled, not in the least. It took some pressuring but they eventually dropped a few hints to what their childhood was like here and there. They admitted to never having a birthday celebration before Hogwarts or always receiving foul gifts for Christmas, as well as doing most of the cooking and cleaning for his family by himself. His company had been a few toy soldiers, the occasional kind stranger, and Alice in Wonderland.
“It’s not fair if Malfoy is just going to help you cheat,” Ron hissed. Hermione abruptly realized that maybe they were obvious enough for other people to notice. Neither seemed to care.
They had felt the weight. It hadn’t just been the dread that someone they knew might get hurt, they had also gotten the responsibility. Both parties were vague but from what Draco could decipher, they had also been in the thick of things.
"I can just-"
Draco admitted to his own nightmares, occasionally even taking a page out of their book and writing it down only moments after his mental monsters had yanked him from his sleep. It was hard to put the first one in the book. It made him feel naked. He was giving up information from the chaotic depths of his mind, places he, himself, was even afraid to look at.  He told them about the snake which haunted his own mind, often waiting for his guard to be down before twisting around his throat with a grip so tight that he woke up convinced that someone was actually strangling him.
Harry continued, “I don’t want you to hate the person who gave them to you.”
“He told you what happened then?”
“I won’t do anything, I promise. I’ll just keep him from leaving.” Ron didn’t look convinced. “Get Robards!” Harry’s shout earned several scandalous looks from passerby but he didn’t care, he only cared that it finally kicked Ron into action. He gritted his teeth but took off towards the lifts nonetheless.
The lightness of Malfoy’s voice relaxed Harry. “Yes, let’s avoid that, please.”
"Is it not our job to protect people?"
Harry’s pushed harder against him. His firm chest gave Draco little room to move. He was close to leaning back onto the hot stove. The heat against his back only made the moment more intense. However, it did not remind him where he was.
“No need to be so hostile, Potter,” Zabini hummed. He had softened his features to a rich warmth, but Harry would not be charmed so easily. The corner of Zabini’s mouth quirked as if he was amused by this realization. “I mean that with all sincerity. I only wanted to speak to you because I thought I owed you.”
He had sat on the bed he slept on for a bit, but the feeling of having his back exposed ate at him. He dropped himself into the little nook between his bedside table and bed. His legs were brought up to his chest. His fingers twisted in his hair and his face tucked between his knees. He rocked a bit, trying to keep himself grounded with the pain of the corner of the nightstand digging into his back.
Draco looked back just in time to see Luna be dragged towards the row of tables in the center aisle where a small horde of Ravenclaws sat over piles of books. Thankfully, none of the others seemed to notice Draco was there, all of them too absorbed in the material in front of them.
“What?” Draco stepped fully into the room. “Why now?”
Hermione managed to shut her mouth, but her eyes were still relatively large. Ron’s shoulders loosened.
“If you’re cold, you should probably sit closer to the fire,” Harry heard his voice before he thought about speaking.
Malfoy shook his head with disdain, holding the door open for Harry to enter. "Still such a people pleaser, Potter."
Draco could see that he knew it as well. “You-Know-Who might not have had any respect for my family, but I was still under Snape’s protection. The Carrows had to listen to me. Blaise saw his opportunity. He was happy to get on his knees if it meant the Carrows would spare him any uncomfortable questions. I protected him from everything, including having to participate in classes that could possibly ruin his name.”
Draco’s brows shot up. “Is it? I thought the fit was a bit odd. It must have gotten mixed with mine in the wash. It’s quite comfortable though.”
Pansy shrugged. “I forgot something at the office,” she tossed a wink at Draco, “and I heard about Potter. My editor asked me to get the inside scoop.”
She pulled away only to swat at him. “Oh hush, of course I did. Everyone deserves a cake on their birthday, even if we didn’t do it on the actual day.”
An ill-timed smile broke across Harry’s face. “You can keep Percy.”
Deciding it wasn’t his place to ask, Harry tugged on his jacket and started towards the fireplace. Just as he was going to grab a fistful of Floo powder, she spoke up, “Harry?”
He kept the forced smile to maintain some semblance of being all right but he tore his gaze away from them nonetheless, not able to look either of them in the eye. To Draco’s dismay, Weasley spotted him instead. “What are you staring at, Malfoy?”
"No, no. Come on," Harry urged. "I hate going there alone anyway."
“Not yet,” Harry whined, “please.” What was it about hearing Harry beg that made Draco so weak? He couldn’t even offer his voice to agree, let alone attempt to deny him. All he could do was nod.
He never would have thought this small woman was so strong. "Thank you," she whimpered into his shoulder. "Thank you for helping my son."
"Harry, you've done all you can right now," Draco tried to coo. He took a calculated step closer, watching Harry's reactions. Harry didn't like him to be too close when he was all riled up, but he appeared too deep in thought to notice this time. "Eat, sleep. You'll be able to think better tomorrow if you do."
Teddy still appeared forlorn but followed Molly nonetheless. The silence which lingered did not last as long as the last. While everyone watched the child’s recovery, Hermione’s focus had remained on Andromeda. “Was that really necessary?”
Malfoy shook his head wordlessly.
I couldn’t decide whether to split this into two chapters or just keep it as one big one. A lot happens. I really just wanted to tie this story up though, and I know the amount of chapters is getting foreboding for casual readers. If you like commenting about what’s going on, feel free to comment more than once. I might push some parts of this back into the last chapter later if I decide to comeback to edit it.
“Who says I won’t?”
“Fine, just keep it off the table,” Draco snapped. He spun away and started towards the living area, mumbling about the dirty glass and books on the coffee table.
Harry’s tongue moved of its own volition. “I wouldn’t say no.”
“I have never seen anything like that,” spoke the familiar voice of Harry’s attending healer. She sounded far more joyful than she had thus far, which was even more surprising when Harry saw who she was walking in with. The Aurors had gone, and all that was left was Draco strolling in at her side. Whatever praise she was giving him, he was eating it up with a poor attempt at a humble smile.
Besides, Draco made good points. For once, he ignored his impulse to say fuck it. He wanted to. With everything in him, he wanted to. Draco was right, though. Harry could handle his own name being dragged through the mud, but Draco’s name had enough. Draco deserved some peace, and no one around Harry would ever have that. And if Draco honestly didn’t want this, then he wouldn’t force it.
“Actually, Dumbledore gave it to me. My father had leant it to him.”
Harry only had enough sense not to ask Ron if they could talk about this later. He paused and looked to his friend, seeing how desperately he was trying. "You don't need to apologize. You're right. I was out of line."
Was Malfoy walking around under an invisibility cloak? Was that why Harry never saw him? Or was he just that good at lurking? It wouldn't surprise Harry.
"They do actually," Draco urged, "you should know, we share a bed."
“Not anymore.”
“Hey!” Ron yelped. Goyle began to thrash in his restraints.
“Wha-”
They let go and Harry stepped away from the desk. He gave one last nod to the man who taught him far more than he expected in the last three years. With a fleeting smile, he started towards the door.
He opened the door. “Granger?”
He wasn’t even in the room yet before Lucas attempted to tear off past him, Maggie on his tail. Harry caught them both in his arms and lifted them off the ground half an inch, causing them both to fill with giggles. “Time for lunch guys, head downstairs.”
Harry snorted and reached up to push back the hair which had fallen into Draco’s eyes—he never noticed how quickly it grew, no wonder he used to slick it back. “I didn’t have much time to be one, so I guess I’m catching up.”
Harry had to physically bite his lips together to keep from making a retort. He didn't restrain his overzealous eye-roll. Malfoy couldn't help but laugh at his expression. Kreacher shot them a glare, and they both feigned innocence.
It looked like Harry’s prediction was correct. This seemed to do the trick. The famous Malfoy sneer pulled up at his mouth, heat festering in his glower.
Ron Weasley stood before him. His face was just as red as his hair with his wand clenched in his white knuckles. “Of course, you’re an arrogant enough prick to just come back here like nothing happened,” Ron spat.
On the morning of Harry’s appointment with Sow, Draco woke up early. Never before had he found himself looking forward to word that Harry had to go back to work. He almost felt guilty about it. He felt no urge to kick Harry out, but he did wish there was something he could do to help him.
Ron averted his eyes from Harry’s face. He found sudden interest in a loose stone by his feet, beginning to wiggle it with the toe of his shoe. “Yeah, well, I guess I could kind of tell back then too. I just didn’t want to admit it.”
“You aren’t the only person that people are going to be angry at about this and, if you’re right, if there is a leak, then his whereabouts might not be as secure as we all think.”
Harry sighed. “If that will make it easier for you to understand, then yes.”
charm. While creating water sounded like a simple task, it was actually very complex, requiring elements of Transfiguration to conjure water out of thin air.
Harry groaned long and hard as he sat up. He threw the book on the mattress beside him. “No, I meant what I said. You’re just no fun.”
Harry’s eyes remained on Cobris as he passed, never breaking until he passed fully.
Draco rolled his eyes but not even he could keep himself from blushing, especially when it covered most of his face. “Yes, Harry, I’ll run away with you.”
Then, for one all-consuming second, he felt Harry’s rough warm fingers glide into his hair. He swore his heart had stopped. Perhaps it had in the instant that his fear flipped to rage.
Draco whipped his own face of any possible runaway icing. “She’s doing fine. She’s in France right now.”
“Sounds perfect,” Draco agreed.
“Wait, today?” Harry asked, glancing between the two.
“We aren’t doing anything,” Harry said grumpily as if he was bitter of this fact. “I’m comforting a friend.”
“Well I caught you both so I guess I’m it,” said Harry. “You better get downstairs before I catch you.”
She heaved a sigh. “I was afraid of that.” Her eyes began to dart behind him again. “Where is he?”
Truly, sometimes they were scarily alike. At least Draco knew he made the right choice of not joining them that night. He couldn’t imagine how the night would have ended if they were both alone in the dorm saying stupid things like this. Maybe it was better to not try and think of it.
Draco’s retort was automatic although notably weak. “Nothing much, I can assure you.”
to spend that much time with Harry. However, he fell asleep to the thought that maybe, just maybe, Malfoy actually did.
"Dray?" Heather chirped, turning to the blond man. "That's a unique name."
Harry didn’t listen. He wobbled to the breakfast bar where Draco had dropped the bag of food. “Are you okay?”
“They are going to think I enchanted you or gave you a love potion. They won’t believe it, and there will be people who will try to prove it or ruin us by trying. We’re Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy. We’re the only people who can never truly hide from our world.”
"You're going to leave me alone with this?" Malfoy hissed, poking at the uncooked chicken.
An instant chill ran down Harry’s spine as delicate fingers ran up it. His eyes flashed back to Malfoy. Something hot twisted in his gut when the cool fingers hit the back of his neck and glided up into his hair.
“No, thanks,” Ron responded politely, taking a seat at the small dinette.
“Then why are you being nice to me?” Malfoy was still smiling as he asked, his voice gushing with genuine bewilderment. “That isn’t exactly normal behavior for us.”
Malfoy’s eyes flicked up, as though his thoughts were finally being confirmed. Harry ignored it and went on, “I would like to know why you were gone this morning. You didn’t have to sneak out.”
“Of course.” She smiled, but it was such a light action that it was hardly noticeable. She seemed distracted by something.
“No.” It fell out of his mouth like a quiet prayer to God.
Pansy didn’t try to hide her smirk, her eyes flickering up to him. She turned a pointed look at Harry, a well-groomed brow raised high. “You either,
He had been planning something for dinner at Malfoy's. Not to mention that he couldn't just not show up without warning him. It was rude, of course, but also, he couldn't get the image out of his mind from the time they'd been walking, and Harry had lost him in a crowd for almost five minutes. Harry ended up finding Malfoy hiding in an alley, trying to hide his face from the people passing by. He looked absolutely petrified. It was the expression that always popped in Harry's head whenever he thought about leaving Malfoy alone; he just couldn't bear the chance of that look resurfacing. He had to stay with him.
"Okay," Harry sighed. Draco's eyes instantly lit up, and it made Harry's heart flutter. "I have to go to the speech, but I won't go into the office."
“Just put something on, and not one of your old t-shirts,” he added, jabbing an accusatory finger in Harry’s direction.
He started to turn away again but was suddenly hindered. Hands on his face pulled him towards soft lips. He briefly forgot what he was doing.
Harry tugged off his cloak and hung it up on the hook, dropping his bag below it, before returning to the kitchen. “Why are you in the kitchen? I thought nearly burning the place down once was enough.”
Draco threw the door open. His smile fell. His whole body shuttered.
Malfoy placed the takeaway on the small dining table and began to pull boxes out of the bag. "She's okay. She's spending some time with a few old friends in France right now." He glanced back at the table beside the front door where a neat stack of post sat. He narrowed his eyes as if doing so gave him the ability to see past the envelope to the letter inside. "She's been staying in Versailles, but I think they're visiting Avignon right now."
“That or the Imperius Curse,” said Cobris. “How else would you explain snogging Draco Malfoy in the streets? We aren’t judging. You’re clearly under the influence. He’s a Death Eater for Merlin’s sake, no one in their right mind would look his way other than to spit at his shoes.”
After a brief farewell to the healer, Draco went around to the other cot. He toed off his shoes then climbed into the small, stiff bed. “You owe me for this, Harry. This is horribly uncomfortable.”
“Come on.” He tugged lightly on his shoulder. “If I come back empty-handed, the others may jinx me.”
The blonde’s head snapped up. He almost pulled away, but Harry kept his grip firm, attempting to calm him with soothing circles against the back of his palm. “I won’t judge you,” Harry assured. “I’m not going anywhere.”
“Want a drink too, Harry?” he asked amid lining up the glasses he’d been pulling out of the cupboard. He’d meant only to be courteous. He was going to hand out a few drinks to anyone who wanted one then join his father in the shed with Bill. He hadn’t meant to earn his mother’s ire. He didn’t have to look up to feel the cringe coming from Fleur and Percy at the table nor the stillness from the other room.
Harry perked up. “Really?”
The shock finally wore off, and Harry rolled his eyes. He picked up his steps again, bumping Malfoy’s shoulder as he passed. “Shove off!”
He guided her into the flat, taking her coat for her.
“Okay, fine, but I’m still not going to talk about it.”
Harry took the last empty spot at the square table and joined everyone in eating.
Narcissa sighed. She would be lying if she said she hadn’t been hoping this was a phase. She thought she’d come to terms with it and she had. However, there was still some bitterness in her heart when she saw them together. Eventually she realized it was jealousy, jealousy at seeing anyone who had found the love that so many searched for – including herself. Now she just wanted them to be safe.
Walter subsided. He turned away in a flurry, tugging Mrs. Hatch and his boys with him. Harry expected George to walk away as well but instead he gave a surveying glance at the crowd the outburst had created. “If you all need some more entertainment in your lives, I’d advise you to visit Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes. Otherwise, please and very respectfully, get your noses out of our business. Thank you.”
A smile was plastered across Harry's face, but he was able to keep from laughing at the very least. "It's called a television, and, no, they can't hear you. It's not like a painting. It's more like a photograph," Harry explained. "It's a recording, something that's already happened and can't be changed. Some of it is news. Others are more like stories. There's a ton to watch, really."
“That’s okay,” Harry said simply. Draco’s eyes darted to him, and a soft smile swept over Harry’s mouth. “I promised that I’m not going anywhere. I don’t mind if you don’t believe me. I told you that I’ll prove it.”
Harry's hand stopped moving, his mouth falling open. "I'm not a horrible snogger!"
“I’ve got you now,” Harry cooed. “I won’t let that happen to you again. He’ll never hurt you again.”
She waved a hand as she followed his guiding hand. “No one calls me that much anymore, Narcissa will do.”
Harry shook out of his own imagination and finally nodded. He released Draco’s hand. “I’ll go first. Remember, it’s the Burrow in Ottery St Catchpole in Devon.”
Despite appearances, neither returning to work or being back with Draco had not actually curbed Harry’s restlessness but he did put it towards something else now. He kept waiting for Draco to give in. For a touch or a look to set him off the way it did Harry. He tried not to be too obvious. Small touches and sweet comments. He got nothing in return. Draco just went about his days like nothing had happened between them.
Draco and Harry didn’t talk about waking up the next day. Nearly all of their limbs were entwined, and neither had been all that alarmed nor eager to separate quickly. It didn’t feel like a conversation that needed to be had. It was just…them. That was simply how they were now.
“I heard they got closer last year,” Ron piped in. He went on, spotting the curious looks on the pair, “Ginny mentioned it. She said she was surprised Zabini hadn’t been at the trials since they’d gotten a lot closer during seventh-year. Like,” Ron widened his eyes to press his emphasis, “a lot closer. Never saw one without the other.”
“Not everyone wants to look like a specky-eyed git, you know!”
A bitter, breathy snort came from Malfoy as he crossed his arms. He clearly didn't believe that Harry would actually help him. If someone was really giving out his information, then could Harry really blame him? He would lose faith in authority, too, in that case. Hell, he had done precisely that when Fudge was in office.
Malfoy pointed up Andromeda’s blotched portrait. “What happened to hers?”
“Pansy?” Ron’s brows drew down and together.
Zabini came to a stop. His eyes narrowed. “I stopped doing all of that ages ago. That’s not what this is about.” The corner of his mouth pulled up. “You’re afraid of competition.”
After nearly three full, consecutive cups of tea, Draco was the first to concede to the bathroom. Silence lingered behind him and Harry thought it would remain until returned. Only a second after his departure, he found that he was wrong.
He stood very still, focusing intensely on how Sow was moving her wand as if hoping doing so would make him blend into his surroundings. However, Hermione’s prolonged gaze finally got the better of him, and he peeked at her out of the corner of his eye. There was conflict on her visage ― she’d been debating if she should even address him ― finally, she settled for a firm nod. Draco returned it.
Hermione had softened as she watched these thoughts transpire across his visage. He’d always been easy to read. It was the reason she knew that Draco really helped him.
Swallowing the automatic retort on his tongue, Draco shoved the daisies across the table towards Longbottom. “Try daisies.”
“Malfoy,” Harry whined, “please.”
Harry took another tentative step forward. “Draco, I don’t blame you. I don’t know exactly what happened but it wasn’t all your fault. You were a child. Despite what anyone’s told you, strangers or your father,” Draco’s hard eyes snapped up, “you couldn’t have done much to change any of this. What you did do was try to helped people and I don’t see that as any reason to persecute yourself.”
Malfoy hadn’t been there when he’d woken up which was a little confusing. He hadn’t told him he had to be out before dawn or anything of the sort. Maybe Malfoy just didn’t sleep in late. He had at least stopped avoiding his eye all together in Transfiguration and he’d accepted the extra quill Harry had offered when he looked at a loss for his own. Ron and Hermione had given him odd looks again but had yet to comment.
It shouldn't come as no surprise anymore
Harry rolled his eyes. “Well, get used to Harry because I won’t answer to anything else from you.”
She nodded curtly. “I always have.”
Malfoy was standing in his doorway. He didn't look much different from the last time Harry had seen him, though there was an evident absence of blood in his hair. Maybe he was a little fuller looking but not the Malfoy that Harry hoped to see when he finally walked out.
Harry straightened up when he noticed all of the odd looks around the room. “What? I’m just saying, you don’t know. It can’t be all that easy being a social pariah, people hating you without even knowing you. If I were her, I’d be trying to reach out to people I thought I could trust too.”
Even as Harry bolted away from his best friend, he couldn’t help but feel incredibly light. He wasn’t entirely sure how long that particular conversation had been weighing on him. It had likely been a few years. There was no telling where it would go now, but at least he had one less thing to worry about.
The elf came trotting into the room. “Wait, wait, no,” Harry urged, waving his hands at both Malfoy and Kreacher. “Fine, I’ll come. I just need my uniform for tomorrow.”
“Hello, Malfoy,” she greeted politely. Spotting the questions in his eyes, she explained, “Ron gave me your address.” Lovely, more people with his address. She looked past Draco into the flat. “I had a little extra time before I went into the office, and I wanted to check on Harry. We haven’t heard anything.”
Ron nodded slowly. It was still hard to comprehend they were talking about the same person from school but Ron wasn’t going to fight it anymore. “Then…you two are…”
They both looked as if he was spewing nonsense. “Of course today,” said Hermione. “You’re coming home with us today.”
Draco did not whirl around, though. He did not even motion for his pocket where his wand was. The tension in his shoulders sunk away, not in relief but defeat. “I had a feeling you’d appear after Granger.”
“I’m sorry, I didn’t realize we were all still at Hogwarts,” Robards boomed. “Is this really how the most elite witches and wizards in the British Ministry behave? If so, maybe it’s time to start clearing the deck and getting new recruits. Maybe they will act like actual adults!”
The familiar snap came from the kitchen, but Malfoy didn’t look up, pretending to be more interested in his book. Flipping a page, he hummed, “Is it already time?”
After a few minutes of searching, he found the remote underneath the armchair. He eased himself onto the sofa, beginning to click through the channels.
These were gruesome scenes. However, Draco noticed that most of the more eye-catching aspects of the scenes were done post-mortem. He'd seen enough bodies be dragged out of his drawing-room after one of Voldemort's tantrums. He remembered how furious his mother had been with that executioner for not disposing of them properly as he'd been told; instead, he left them to rot next to her rose bushes. Draco wasn't sure if he had preferred them lying there intact to look at him or the resulting carnage the executioner had left afterward to 'fertilize' her garden. Whoever was committing these murders had just about the same tact. Messy and quick and almost excited to be causing this kind of damage.
“Can I meet him? Maybe I can show grandma that they aren’t so bad, and she can stop being sad.”
Harry frowned. "That's next month. That's a long time to keep him in detainment. Are we sending him to Azkaban?"
“I guess it’s the job. He misses it,” she considered. If he only resumed recently, then that was the most likely cause. “He likes working. It keeps him centered.”
Though Harry had promised himself he would never show up at Malfoy's again, he found himself at his doorstep the following three days.
Harry couldn’t recall a time he shared a bed with Ron or even Hermione. Perhaps this was crossing a line. He likely should have backed away, but he couldn’t. He couldn’t make himself stop. If this was the best way to comfort Draco, then he’d do it. He’d do whatever was necessary.
Malfoy’s brow knitted together. He looked to be trying to consider what answer she wanted to hear, but his personal opinion outweighed it. “It’s ludicrous, of course.”
They sat in their regular spot in the corner of the café beside the lounges. When there was a short break of new walk-ins, Heather left the counter and found the trio. “Glad to see you’re introducing more people to our little place,” she said, looking at Pansy.
Draco frowned. “
The scowl on Finch-Fletchley’s face abided as he glanced guiltily as his friend beside him who appeared mildly grateful that Draco had spoken up. Draco gave a sigh and took a step closer towards the trio of Hufflepuffs, which also included Ernie Macmillan, and their practice space.
Ron got to his feet. “Fine but I’m coming with you.”
Kreacher nodded slowly. “Or he breathes heavy and shakes and cries, mutters things about Kreacher’s old master and Dumbledore and Moody. Kreacher has tried to get help, but he doesn’t let Weasley or Granger around.”
“Granger.”
“You absolute wanker!” Malfoy roared, and all seemed to be right again.
“Or perhaps,” Zabini spoke up now, though he appeared more concerned with straightening his cuffs, “you should do as you were always meant to and stay there. Then we can finally be done of you.”
"I-I'm sorry," Malfoy said through a hiccup.
Ron leveled on him. “You’re joking, right?” Harry started to argue but Ron kept on. “I’m your friend, Harry, your best friend in fact, but we’ve never shared a bed, especially for an extended period of time.”
Neither Draco nor Harry had been magically cured of their previous problems by being together. Walking into crowded streets still made Draco uncomfortable. Harry still looked over his shoulder and saw threats were there were none. They weren’t fixed but they were healing. Because Draco was uncomfortable but not crippled in fear; and Harry’s mind showed him threats but he didn’t believe them.
“In your dreams.”
“I’m saying it, so you know that you won’t lose me, not ever.”
“I just saved your arse from a lawsuit. The least you can do is spend a few knuts at my store.”
Malfoy shrugged and sat back. “I had just started falling asleep when you came in.”
He shook away the chill that ran down his spine. “It doesn’t matter,” he muttered to himself and suddenly he realized that the tiny whimper in his head had been his own voice. He hadn’t recognized it. “It doesn’t matter,” he repeated both mentally and out loud.
Draco gave his hand a wildly exaggerated shake. “Yes, and precisely for that reason.”
It wasn’t far off. Harry had seen a few Dark Marks since the war, but none this close. It looked like an aged muggle tattoo that hadn’t been well cared for, sun damage and age smudging and stretching it.
Draco shook his head slowly, his gaze falling back to the sofa. “You’re the one who’s having their reputation ruined by all of this.”
"I beg to differ."
. I went back once a week but you eventually just stopped leaving. I didn’t understand. Then a few weeks ago,” his lips curled again, as his eyes raked up and down Harry’s body, “I finally saw what was going on - you should really close your window.”
Hermione frowned. “Skeres?” She got off the ground, dusting herself off before sitting down next to Ron. “Terry Skeres?”
Draco hesitated. He would have to warn Harry eventually, and maybe it would lighten his mood, or at least distract him. "I guess it's a bad time to bring up the fact that we'll be having a guest tomorrow." Harry looked back with his brow creased, and Draco explained further, "Pansy is coming over. She always comes over on the anniversary."
Harry’s face cracked into a wide smile. “You’re on.”
Ron’s exasperation disappeared and his face fell. For a moment, Harry feared that he’d said something wrong. That this was some sort of test that he’d just failed. It certainly appeared like Ron had just received some bad news. “Mate,” he said carefully, “you know we won’t care, right?”
Nevertheless, he was just happy to be back in the flat. He’d been beginning to believe he’d never see it again.
There was a yelp of shock. Draco tore away but couldn’t get far as Harry locked his arms. “What are you–“
He could still feel the Ravenclaw’s stern eyes as she started to pull Luna away. “Come on, Luna. You said you’d help us with Care for Magical Creatures today.”
“Are you absolutely positive she agreed to this? Molly Weasley said the words ‘Draco Malfoy is invited to the party’?” Draco hadn’t stopped searching for reassurance since the night before when Harry reminded him about the party. He had accepted the invite far easier the first time Harry brought it up Monday night. However, it appeared he had expected it to be withdrawn before the weekend actually came.
Harry’s head snapped up, and though he saw the teasing curve of Draco’s mouth, he also saw the honesty in his eyes. “That isn’t true,” Harry insisted. “You aren’t evil.”
Hermione found herself flabbergasted. Draco Malfoy was genuinely living like a muggle. No owls, no Floo, not even robes ― he wore a gray jumper with black trousers and socks, not at all something a well-respected pureblood would be seen walking around in.
Ron made a face. “I think I’d need to be committed if I found out he was leaving his toothbrush at her house.” She could still feel the pull of concern in her chest. Nonetheless, she found herself chuckling at his words.
“Like hell he did. I know you think I’m an idiot, but I’m not that gullible, Malfoy. Why would he ever come to you?”
But that would never happen. He was still Draco Malfoy and no one would look past that anytime soon.
Harry nodded, knowing it was better to ride out Malfoy's courage than keep pressing the matter. They got up to the ground floor, Kreacher closing doors behind them. They tucked the wine glasses onto the top of the pans, and Malfoy used his free hand to grab an umbrella from the troll foot beside the door.
“You aren’t though. You need to get out of this flat, eat a real meal. You need to enjoy your life.”
Harry’s face deadpanned. “As a house elf in the kitchens,” he huffed. “As a professor, you git. The Dark Arts position to be exact.”
Draco rolled his eyes, “I don’t need praise for everything I do well.”
"Can I use your shower?"
However, that would put him in a cell in Azkaban right next to Goyle. He would be forced to leave Draco all alone. No amount of pride, no amount of anger, would ever be worth that. He promised he wouldn’t leave.
“Do you know where we can find him?” Harry questioned. Ron’s eyebrows shot up on his forehead.
“Then we’ll need someone who knows how to accommodate you,” she declared. She looked at Draco. “As long as that’s okay with you? I understand if you were looking forward to a night off.”
"Azkaban? No. He's going home."
Ron quirked one brow. Curious but attempting to be casual about it.
"Are you up for that dinner we were going to have last week?"
“I know!” Draco insisted sharply. His gaze snapped back, both irate and pleading, “But I want it to be on my own terms, okay?”
“The reason I have it is so I can protect them. So long as their name is in my desk, and they are not a public figure in their own right, then the Daily Prophet and any other media outlet cannot publicly connect them to any of my people.
She gave him a very firm disapproving look that would have made Mrs. Weasley proud. “He doesn’t exactly have any other friends besides you. If he needs someone to talk to–“
"Nope, I was never part of family portraits, thank God."
"It wasn't just cooking and cleaning, was it?" Malfoy questioned.
Abandoning everything they’d been doing, Ron and Hermione both lunged forward to grab some part of Kreacher. They whirled away a second later.
Malfoy blinked at him a few times. He had pressed as far back into the seat as possible, an almost unnoticeable pink tint blossoming from his stiff jawline.
“Go away,” Draco called back. He remembered what happened the last time he’d opened the door for Ron. Draco had yet to fix the crack in the mirror beside the door from when Ron smashed his head into it.
“Okay,” Harry nodded, understanding. He started to place his other hand on Draco’s shoulder but Draco flinched away. His eyes darted towards the Burrow. Harry followed his gaze over his shoulder. He couldn’t see any faces in the windows but he wasn’t naive enough to think that there couldn’t be. “This way.”
“Yes! That is precisely what I thought!”
“Do you have honey?”
“Ignore her,” Draco sighed. “Her main personality trait is bitch.”
A smirk rolled onto Harry’s lips again. He started to lean forward. “She said to disinfect the counters after; shouldn’t we make them dirty first?”
Harry stepped inside, starting towards the kitchen. "Damn, I forgot about that. I could have just come straight over without changing."
Robards crossed his arms. “Not if I can help it. I was hoping you could voluntarily take a few days of leave but I will officially suspend you if I must.”
Harry threw his hands in the air. “I know!” He dropped his arms in a defeated sort of way. “I can’t force him though.”
Pansy waited until the girl turned away before yanking Draco by his shirt to hiss in his face. “I will cut off your ballocks with my nails.”
“That was not my doing!”
“Do we have to do that by being friends?”
“Mr. Malfoy, what are you doing here?” Robards came striding down the hall with his assistant scuttling at his side. He had arrived just before Harry managed to shove his foot too far into his mouth.
A breathless sort of sigh left Draco’s lips. “You want me to run away with you?”
They landed in the kitchen of Grimmauld. The elf started up the steps with Ron and Hermione on his heels. They came to an abrupt halt on the landing of the second floor. The sound of heavy breathing could be heard from the room they knew to be Harry’s, the occasional whimper cutting through the air.
Harry eyes widened. His gaze darted around the room. “Right now?” He was only in joggers and in a horrible state at that. If that prim woman apparated into the room right now, Harry was screwed.
Surprisingly, the invitation hadn’t been one Harry had thought of before. He never assumed he had to give one. Everyone else in their Common Room had just started appearing at the end of Gryffindor table, and no one thought to tell them to go away.
Granger frowned, her eyes dropping to the meager bags hanging from Potter’s hand. “You really can’t remember what it’s called?”
“With you?”
Harry looked up, pretending to consider his words. After only a moment, he looked back at Draco and shook his head. “No.” As if proving his point, he closed the gap between them to press a long kiss to Draco’s lips.
This was going to be entertaining.
Malfoy nodded slowly, his shoulders gradually easing. He squeezed Harry's arm closer, pressing their shoulders together.
“What? Where are you going? Is this really the best time-?”
"If you'd like to speed it up, I suppose I could show you how to use a blow-dryer. It might make it a little more evenly cook. Using the microwave may be dangerous… If we hurry back before it gets dark, we could use the sun. It might get a little damp, though; it's been raining all day." The more things Harry listed, the angrier Malfoy physically became. There was a vein popping out of his forehead by the time he mentioned the sun. Meanwhile, Harry's mouth had become twisted into a crooked smile.
“Just drop it, Malfoy,” Zabini hissed. “I already told you.”
Harry watched a young couple accompanied by an older woman walk down the street. She held the man’s arm though she appeared to be in conversation with the young woman who was smiling and nodding politely. He watched them until they vanished into the small restaurant on the corner. Breakfast with the in-laws, Harry thought offhandedly.
Harry and Ron weren't the only ones who had taken up Kingsley's offer. Longbottom had probably been the most surprising addition to the office, but only if you didn't know him. In all honesty, he was just as likely to be there as Harry was, if not more so. Both of his parents had been renowned Auror's in their day, and he could have easily been the one in Harry's shoes all those years ago if Voldemort had deciphered the prophecy as referring to him instead of Harry, not to mention that he'd been instrumental in taking down Voldemort. Longbottom certainly belonged there; it didn't mean his old interests had disappeared, though.
Narcissa’s head snapped up. “She did?”
“He’s trying to say something,” Hermione squeaked happily. They all leaned in closer, Hermione dropping down to nearly rest her ear against his chest. “It’s okay, Harry. You’re safe.”
Draco’s eyes found his and momentarily lit up with their old spark. He pursed his lips. “So I’m just a lot of other horrible things then?”
“Dray!”
"Why haven't you healed it?"
Draco’s eyes were trained on the ground now, hard and distant. “I’ve figured that much out.”
“I think I’ve changed my mind,” Draco declared loudly, pulling on Harry’s hand. “That Stardeer place looked fairly popular. It’s likely good, right?”
“No, Harry, you’re not.” She urged, her eyes following him as he began to pace, trying to keep his face hidden from her as much as possible. “You’ve never been fine. You’ve been fighting evil since you were one-years-old. Of course, you’re not fine. We just want you to admit it and let us help you.”
For a moment, he considered ignoring the topic and acting as if he hadn’t read it. That wasn’t right either. He had already told them that if they needed to talk he’d listen. He didn’t want to go back on that. Above all, he didn’t want to lose them.
She may not be acting out like Ron, but Harry knew her thoughts weren't far off from his. She didn't understand this either. Hell, Harry barely understood it.
Draco blinked at him for a long moment. “As…”
Every muscle in Draco’s body was tight. He rather cut off his arm than watch Harry’s reaction when he saw it. In the end, he settled for squeezing his eyes shut.
Harry got to his feet. He didn’t know whether he planned to run away or run towards him. He didn’t have to decide. Draco crossed the room in long strides.
A faint smile played on Harry's lips, but it didn't reach his eyes. He shook his head slowly side-to-side. "No, none of that, I'm afraid. I try not to go around too many wizarding hangouts for that reason. It's hard to always be pleasant when all you want is a beer so you can get a good kip."
"Yeah, Malfoy. We've all tried doing that once or twice."
"Here's the address," Robards handed Harry a half sheet of paper with an address scribbled on. "Apparate, it's quicker than finding the right Floo. And hurry before any muggles get hurt."
He bit away his smile and returned to playing with the fabric. “You don’t care what others think about you, but what do you think about it?”
Draco frowned at him. “Why didn’t they tell you?”
With some throat clearing, Harry finally pushed himself off of the other man.
Malfoy didn't move from the spot Harry had left him. He continued to stare at the white door with wide eyes.
Harry was only a block from Grimmauld when the familiar, purple neon lights touched his face. He stuffed his hands in his pockets and kept his head forward, but his eyes slid to the building across the street.
“I’m surprised she didn’t mention it in her letters. She always used to...” Andromeda trailed off with a sigh and shook her head. “Things have changed. I’m surprised she’s even sending me anything, honestly.”
“Take me to him,” Malfoy demanded.
Harry and Draco had returned to the Burrow to find a strange atmosphere around them. Harry tried not to ponder it long, announcing they’d be leaving almost as soon as they entered. It wasn’t going over well.
are not going to go anywhere near him.
Harry pulled his head up from his desk to rest it in his palm. He looked up at Ron though his eyelids felt like lead weights, which threatened to fall back down. "Just a home remedy for a few of those bruises Knox gave me."
They both joined him. Ron leaned forward on his elbows, his brown knotted in concentration. His Auror brain was already searching for answers. “Do you have any idea who took the pictures or how they found out?”
“Harry.” His eyes snapped towards the sound. There was a slight quirk of victory on Draco’s lips, but his eyes were sincere. “Thank you.”
,” he spoke like it was a curse.
Air fell out shakily from Malfoy’s mouth. He tried to speak, but the connections in his brain could not be made. The only functional part of him was the rush of blood to his face.
He started down the street. It was a rare day of sunshine in London, and there were plenty of people out to enjoy it. Harry passed the dull sign of Allure. The club appeared open but certainly not at its peak yet, most likely getting ready for its busy Friday night.
After his cup of tea and seeing Ron and Hermione off, Harry put Teddy to bed upon the child’s request. He resumed Andromeda’s place in
Harry rolled his eyes but George likely didn’t see as he was already weaving through the shelves back towards the door. He had to get back to the ministry to talk to Robards.
“Like what?”
Walking through London holding Draco’s hand, Harry found that he still had those rose-colored glasses on and it felt like he had a permanent sticking charm keeping them on his face. His friends were safe and happy. He had Draco all to himself. He hadn’t even had as many nightmares recently. He was so unbelievably happy.
They eventually reached the apartment. When they got inside, they resumed their usual, nightly habit of sitting in front of the television; however, Harry didn’t go to his corner of the sofa. Instead, he remained pressed next to Draco. When it started getting late, Harry suggested that he go back to Grimmauld, but, to his great relief, Draco assured that he could stay like before.
“I don’t know if she said those exact words,” Harry said carefully, “but Ron said you were invited.”
“Did something happen at work today?” Malfoy asked, hoping to find some sort of source for this behavior.
“Master is not feeling well today. He sent Kreacher to tell Mr. Malfoy that he won’t be coming today.”
Draco stirred honey into each of the cups. “It’s a good thing I got the week off then.”
A cold chill ran down Harry’s spine. Such a proclamation several weeks ago would have sent Harry into a rage, but it only made him feel more concerned now. “What? No, come here.” He knelt onto the bed, holding out an open arm. “I don’t blame you. It’s not your fault.”
Narcissa shook her head rapidly, flapping her hand. “I wouldn’t want to intrude. I doubt Molly would want me there.”
Malfoy made a face. "I need to stop doing that," he mumbled, making Harry chuckle. "But seriously, all you do is work?"
"I need to do something." Harry grabbed the back of one of the dining chairs, his fingers clutching the lumber so hard that they turned white. "I need to look. I need to-"
“You aren’t an Auror right now.”
Draco pinched a small tuff at the nape of his neck, sending a shiver down Harry's back. Feeling bold, Draco slowly moved his fingers through the inky locks, waiting for Harry to eventually shoo him away. It never happened. In actuality, the slow movement caused Harry's eyes to flutter closed.
Harry was on the verge of losing control when the giggling doorknob cut off his thoughts. When whoever was outside found it sealed, they began to pound on the door. “Mr. Goyle, are you in there? We need to speak to you,” Robards’ voice boomed.
Harry gave him an odd look. “No, why would I make you invite her?”
Harry stared. His chest heaving as adrenaline pumped through his body. All he wanted to do was spin around and start kicking down every door in Britain to find Macnair. Draco was right, though. He wasn't going to find him like that. Even if he did, he'd be too weak to put up a real fight.
“Don’t you two spend enough time together?” Harry leveled a look his way. Ron quickly put his hands up in surrender. “I’m just concerned about your well-being. You already scrapped her coming home party after your accident, I don’t think you can survive skiving out on another. She’ll likely show up at Malfoy’s and pull you out by the ear. I’ve seen it happen before.”
“There’s something between the two of you, mate, and it’s more than friendship. A blind person could see it. Everyone at the party could certainly see it.”
“Please, it’s not like we’re exhibitionists,” Harry claimed without a hint of remorse, making Draco’s face flame up even more.
When there was no response, only Draco’s bleary eyes hundreds of miles away, Harry inched only a breath closer. Draco’s eyes snapped back to the present to stare at him. “Draco?” he attempted.
“Where are you going? We need to tell Robards,” Ron urged. Thanks to Ron still being in his Auror robes, they were able to break out of the visitor center quickly. They rushed through the atrium together but Harry hesitated when he spotted the caretaker office.
It seemed impossible to wrap her head around that information, and yet here it was right in front of her.
“I heard that you resigned from your position at the Auror’s Office and,” she straightened the black sleeves protruding from her emerald green robe, “it just so happens that I find myself in need of a new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. Dawlish has done a wonderful job these last few years but, as he keeps reminding me, he only took it as a temporary position.”
, he thought to himself and the feeling seemed to double.
“Oh? Why is that?”
"And yet you’re still defending him?"
The next day came and Draco once again noticed Potter leaving the library alone. His head was low, concealing most of his face. This time he was already rounding the corner outside in the corridor before he could spot Draco.
A short gasp drew Draco back as he caught the earnestness in Harry’s eyes. Draco’s eyebrows were knitted together, his eyes darting over Harry’s features with heavy-handed measurements. Panic was rising. Harry had to do something. He reached out to grasp Draco’s wrist, partially to keep him seated and also to give it a reassuring squeeze. “You’re beautiful,” he said quickly. “That’s what I was thinking.”
Harry’s confusion only delighted him more. An actual laugh fell out of Malfoy’s mouth and it seemed unusual. Harry suddenly realized he had never actually seen Malfoy laugh genuinely, at least not that he could remember, and certainly never this quiet coy snicker. “My wand likes…” Malfoy started to say but he couldn’t finish. He shook his head and waved his hand at his own thoughts. “Never mind. It’s nothing.”
“I don’t have enough control to use it that way though.” He wrapped his finger around the wood, recapturing his usual hold. “Not many do.” His jaw clenched. “It’s quite terrible.”
Harry rolled his eyes. He was half prepared to stand up and walk away, but there was nowhere else to go. He decided to settle on, “You don’t have to be an arse.”
“My mum?” Draco snapped around and Harry quickly realized his mistake. “What about my mother? What did she say?”
"Malfoy? Are you okay?"
Draco gave a little hum of consideration then began to guide Harry’s face down again. He pressed a soft kiss to Harry’s lips. “How about now?”
Had this been what it was like for Draco trying to deal with Harry that week? He could see why Draco had begun to lose his patience.
Barely hanging onto the moment, Harry shook his head which was held between his hands.
The door opened.
“You’re welcome,” Malfoy said as if Harry had taken too long to say it himself.
Harry tilted his head, confused. Draco seemed to catch on before he could. “Andromeda was a bit cold the first time we spoke but she asked about you.”
The afternoon with Draco was the only thing that kept Harry complacent that evening. Draco was also by his side for the rest of the day. Harry knew well enough how suspicious he would become if Harry suddenly stood up and went to confront Zabini. Every bone in his body wanted to.
Only hours ago, Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy were not friends. They were hardly begrudging classmates with only the occasional polite word and a strange recent string of one-sided kindness. Now they looked like decades-old childhood friends who had a particular pension for banter.
Draco’s gaze dropped to his feet. It was a bit disconcerting for Ron, just as it had been for Harry. He was so used to the feisty blond fighting back.
Harry sat up straight. “What? No, of course not! I loved Ginny.” A deep ache in his chest made his shoulders fall. The memory of hurting her rolled through his brain and he suddenly felt like he was going to be sick. “We weren’t good for each other.”
Harry pulled them to a stop in front of the apartment building. Draco gave him a quizzical look but it was cut off when Harry pressed another kiss to his lips. It was a soft, short kiss but it said everything Harry was feeling without words.
“Wait! No! Come back here.”
Ron hurried to get his things before leaving the room. On his retreat, he tossed Harry one more disapproving glance and made a face.
“Harry, I think he’s been in love with you for a while,” Parvati added.
“Actually,” Draco’s eyes flicked over to Harry who swallowed down a piece of fruit, “we’ve decided to go back to England for the holidays.”
He was in there only for a minute before washing up and heading back out. His heart sunk when he heard a grumble from the bed. He had tried so hard to be quiet. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to-”
“No, I’m defending
“Do you know what happened between them?”
Both gave him a pointed look.
"What for?"
"Well, have you ever considered being a healer, yourself?"
Malfoy let out a loud groan and flipped over, yanking his covers with him. “Your question is ridiculous.”
This story is getting much longer than I expected it to. I'm going to try to keep it within 5  chapters at a maximum but I've given up on limiting word count.
Malfoy looked back over his shoulder, hands still in the suds, and wrinkled his nose as if he had smelt something terrible. "Please do."
Ron was smiling fondly at the memory as he went on. “I’m only saying that we’ve always gotten ourselves out of things before – even
The cool expression on the woman’s face crumbled. Her brow furrowed. A firm frown formed on her thin lips. “She’s been down there for months. She’s been sending me-”
There was a loud thumping in Draco’s ears, his heart was doing summersaults. It was a short message today but it made him feel strange. Were they flirting with him?
After the contract had gone out on the apartment in London and Grimmauld underwent construction, Harry and Draco had decided to find a new place for them to settle – after they’d finished traveling the Mediterranean coast. They’d found a cottage in Devon, only a short apparition from the burrow. They had neighbors but they were hidden between trees and bushes, giving them plenty of breadth to practice magic without too much concern.
She rolled her eyes. “Obviously, I knew that would be your answer. That was just my excuse to get some info for my friend, but clearly, he’ll soon have more information than I do.” She smiled at Draco, who gave a gracious nod. Pansy might be a gossip loving bitch, but she knew how to watch out for her friends.
Deciding not to attempt any input or argument, Harry turned towards the kitchen. “Tea?”
Draco shook his head. "As someone who repeatedly lost to you in Quidditch, I can assure you it's not the only thing. I lost to you in a lot of things, actually. I hated how carelessly good you were at everything. I had to work so damn hard, and no one gave a shit."
The candles were lit and everyone began to sing. Harry was grateful to have Teddy in his arms so he wouldn’t have to feel too awkward with everyone singing at him. When the song came to a close, Molly urged Harry to make a wish.
Harry pulled his voice down and pushed it through his clenched teeth. “What are you talking about?”
“Please stay,” Malfoy simpered into the crook of his neck when he began to calm down.
"No, I imagine you wouldn't; you were snoring halfway through," Malfoy teased.
Draco sprung to his feet. Harry was only beginning to stand up when he reached the door and jerked it open.
“He’s what?” Hermione stared at her boyfriend in absolute bewilderment. She had only beaten him to their apartment by about two minutes and was still trying to process her workday, let alone the news they were having company. She felt like she’d forgotten what it was like to have Harry over. Not to mention she knew that neither of them had anything planned for a meal of any kind.
Fear plucked down through his arm the moment he felt Draco’s body go rigid. His eyes met Harry’s apologetic gaze. Instead of pulling away, Draco sighed as if resigned and went back to his meal. Thoughts of Zabini disappeared. The moment in front of him was all that mattered. The feeling of Draco’s cool fingers twisted with his own, and Ron and Hermione’s banter over studying for finals, and Justin and Dean quizzing Seamus on muggle topics, and anything and everything in this moment alone.
That was, at least, what Harry assumed. Thankfully, Draco was a master at concealing his expressions and compartmentalizing his feelings. Nevertheless, Harry’s new ‘subtle’ affection was becoming painful. There was no longer space between them on the sofa, Harry often sitting as he did with his legs crossed and his knee overlapping Draco’s thigh. He was also very quick to help with stuff like opening jars or handing him something across the room, somehow always managing to make his touch linger. He was also pretty sure that Harry had moved closer to the center of the bed at night or maybe that was just his own subconscious action.
“Don’t laugh!” Draco snapped, seeing Harry’s smile flash in the corner of his eye.
He picked up his muggle wallet, which had a few pounds and a driver's license Hermione had helped him get, and was about to toss the slip of paper into his nightstand in its place. However, he hesitated when he saw the miscellaneous mess that was the drawer of his bedside table. He would never find it in there. He tucked the paper into the wallet, making a mental note it was there if he ever needed it, and stuffed it in his jeans.
Kreacher narrowed his eyes at the door Malfoy was pointing at. "The wine cellar, Sir."
“No.”
Draco had hated Dumbledore before he ever arrived at Hogwarts. All of his opinions had already been made up without his say. It wasn’t as if he could disagree with his father. He hated Dumbledore, even if Draco’s largest complaint of the man could ever be that he had very blatantly given the house cup to the Gryffindors their first year. Of course, there was also the fact he obviously favored Potter but everyone did—even his own father spoke of great things of the child when many thought he would end up the next Dark Lord.
If Harry hadn’t learned first-hand how easy it was for snakes to be dismissive, he might have only seen Zabini’s show of dusting himself off and missed the spark in his eye. “What are you talking about?”
“I don’t have any problem with-” He attempted to step forward and instantly felt a sharp pain shoot up his abdomen. He crumpled forward, nearly losing his footing. Draco caught him before he could fall.
And you're not here
Draco gaped at the child. He could feel his heart pounding in his ears. His whole face flushed. “Is…” he glanced around for any eavesdroppers but the child had enough couth to speak in decent whisper, “Is that so?”
Andromeda sighed as she began to fill up the kettle. “In all honesty, I don’t really have much to say to her. She mostly just sends me gifts in hopes that one will get my attention.” She eyed the tin. “Our mother loved Oolong. Always picked up a new batch in France from this little company.” She tapped her nails on the lid of the yellow tin beside the sink. “She liked to make it with fresh honey. All of us girls would sit around in the drawing-room with our tea and talk about our day.”
It wasn’t a thought Harry had entirely avoided, but he also knew that whatever conclusion he came to wouldn’t change anything. “I was nine,” he said. “It’s hard to tell. I just know it hurt when he turned his back on me.” Harry finally tore his eyes away from Draco’s to return to the apathetic lake. “I can deal with bullies; I don’t know how to lose a friend. I’ve had so few.”
Draco sighed. Some poor muggle-born was likely going to be missing this come Monday. Maybe it was a good thing, it was quite terrible. They hadn’t even remembered to write their name and several of the ingredients they mentioned had been mixed up, not to mention that the historical context they’d added was flimsy at best.
"Home! He just tried to kill someone."
