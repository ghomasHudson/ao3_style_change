“No Draco, they ask all the time for you to join them. They know I love you and want to be with you as much as possible. They just want to be included.” Harry flipped around teary eyed.
“Yes, several. And books. And parchment. And quills. And some magazines.” She pushed the bag into his arms. “Get changed.”
“I didn’t punch his face.” Potter growled. The intensity caused Draco’s stomach to knot up. Damn what was the Savior doing to him?
“Oh hun,” Pansy ran up to him holding a large bag. She pulled him into another hug. Damn the tears were threatening again.
Pansy looped her arm in his and they started walking out into the main part of the hospital wing. “I’ll be back later. Let me know if you need anything at all ok?” She gave him a kiss on the cheek. Draco nodded.
“Mr. Potter, I do not appreciate you damaging the walls of the school.” Headmistress McGonagall said. Her voice wasn’t as stern as Draco would have expected. “I expect you to take a visit to Madam Pomfrey, I believe you have broken your hand. I will inform Professor Sprout that you will be late to her class.”
McGonagall walked over to Harry then. Draco followed her, he had to get away from that man before he tried again to do something.
Potter chuckled and slid into the seat right next to Draco. They were so close their arms and legs were touching. Draco felt his heart race. Damn that idiotic Golden Boy, he probably knew what he was doing to Draco. Maybe this was the plan all along? Tease Draco about his sexuality.
Draco dressed in silence. Part of him wondered if Pansy left the bathroom. However, she was waiting on the other side of the door when he opened it.
“You know you aren’t the only one with nightmares, right?” Draco said softly. Why? He had no idea. Slytherins do not admit weakness. But he didn’t say he had nightmares just other people. Yes, not Draco.
Harry rolled over with a sigh and picked back up the discarded box. “I know it’s kinda soon but I wanted to get you something.”
This time when he reached Draco’s slacks he pulled them down. He didn’t stop kissing. He kissed along his hip bone, he kissed down his thigh. Then he paused in front of Draco, who was becoming embarrassed being exposed like that. Before Draco could say anything, Harry took Draco in his mouth.
“Hugo please alert the Headmistress, I’m sure she wants to know that Mr. Potter is awake.” Pomfrey got up and fetched a few more potions.
“I have had several nurses from St. Mungo’s visit and help as they could. The fact is this all depends on him. If his body is strong enough, he will pull through. He has just been through so much, I’m not sure how much longer his body can fight.” Madam Pomfrey went over to Harry and checked his eyes. “His friends have come and gone several times. So, have yours. I’d bet they would be happy to see you come back to the common room.”
Beside him Granger let go of his arm as Potter came back to their small group. “Blimey mate, you have to go that hard?” The Weasel smiled.
Since the start of the term Draco had a rough time. McGonagall had called them all back offering a special eighth year for students who were never able to complete their schooling due to the war.
Draco knew then that he wanted to do something else, something more. He held out his hand Harry didn’t hesitate to take it. Draco led him slowly away from the common room back towards his room. Before they got there though Harry pulled Draco back towards him never releasing his hand. Harry’s free hand slid up the side of Draco’s face, into his hair, gently tugging it to force Draco into a deep kiss.
Draco turned and saw Weasley. He did not have the energy to even think of some smart-ass retort. He just looked back at Harry.
“Do you really think we hate you?” Draco nodded. Granger just sighed. “We don’t. I don’t think we ever really did you know? Yes, you were pretty horrible at times. But so were we. We were all just school kids. Rivals before the war.”
Draco set the box aside without looking in it. He reached up and turned Harry towards him. Looking him in the eyes, part of him still scared this was some elaborate joke. As Draco searched Harry’s eyes though he saw worry, and happiness, and something else. Draco pulled Harry into a kiss. Pulled with enough force that Harry was soon on top of him.
“Madam Pomfrey these are the blades. We tried casting the healing spell, but nothing helped.” Hermione said softly. Tears were streaming down her face.
Two years have passed. Draco was sitting next to Ginny and Hermione. They were at the Burrow for Christmas.
Draco nodded and pulled up a chair. Pomfrey messed with Harry’s bandages a bit and then left them alone. Draco looked at him and the tears returned.
When night fell Pomfrey insisted Draco go to the next bed and lay down. She threatened to kick him out of the hospital if he did not comply. He frowned but obeyed.
“I can’t believe Christmas is only a few weeks away.” Potter said. “This year seems to be flying by.”
It shouldn’t have surprised Draco as much as it had that he would be with Saint Potter. Of course, it had to be him. The bloody Savior. The Golden Boy who saved them all. The one who spoke for Draco and his Mother at their trials. The reason Draco was given another chance.
“You won’t drop it will you?” Draco sighed. He had been hoping to get some reading in, the fire looked so welcoming.
“Ma’am.” One Auror said with a gruff voice. “Whoever cast these spells please remove them after we have the cuffs on him.” The man then went to apply two sets of cuffs one for his wrists one for his feet. Draco knew of these; they were to prevent magic. The person wearing them could not cast even if they got ahold of a wand, they also could not shift if they were an Animagus.
“That’s the point Draco, you aren’t trying to understand!” Harry screamed back. “They are my friends. They are like family to me.”
“When he died it was you who saved him though. You might not know but it was your mother who checked on him who asked quietly if you were alive, that was the only thing he was sure of he could honestly answer. She lied for him then, for you. All she wanted to do was see you again, you know? Which gave him the chance to get away again.”
“I am truly hesitant to guess Molly. He is breathing and his heart is beating. Both are excellent signs. However, the wounds still are not closing. We are keeping him on blood replenishing potion. Then there is the fact he still has not woken up. He has shown no signs of being alert. I’m not sure if it was the poison, the wound itself, or the shock of it all.” Pomfrey said all of that as matter of factly as possible. Again, her voice softened her tone changed. “It’s up to Harry. He must fight this. I think he is; he is nothing but stubborn. He just needs his body to cooperate. I am doing my best to aide him.”
“Potter!” Draco called trying to wake him. “Potter!” He reached in trying to be gentle. Nothing was helping. “Potter!” He started to shake him. Instantly there was a wand at his throat. Draco froze. “Potter you were having a nightmare.”
Madam Pomfrey came over in a flash. She poured a potion down Harry’s throat. She searched over his wounds and poured something else there. The bleeding slowed.
“Because I like you.” Potter replied. Draco frowned, why was he saying such things? What was he trying to accomplish?
Leaving the plates to wash themselves in the sink, Harry retrieved the shopping bag from the front hall. It was silly, he knew, but how could he not? It wasn't really for the baby
Harry sighed and hoisted Draco a little higher. “Darling, you’re a lightweight. You’ve never been huge. And I’m taking you to bed, you ridiculous creature, and then I’m going to rub your back and your feet, and kiss you, and if possible, make love to you.”
One of Potter's broad, calloused hands retreated from where it had been groping Draco's bum and took hold of Draco's rock-hard, already-leaking cock. The hand gave a firm tug, and Draco moaned into Potter's mouth. Potter was obviously responding to some primal instincts because this threw him into more of a frenzy, and his own cock joined Draco's in the tight grip of Potter's hand.
“Oh, fuck, Malfoy,” Harry didn’t need this, he was ready, very ready, aching to sink into Draco and love him. “What would you like to do - where do you want me?”
Draco had a type from quite young, he knew that. His first crush was a young Kingsley Shacklebolt, whose dark skin bordered on ebony and who teased Draco when he saw him at the Ministry accompanying Lucius. He'd had a short fling with Blaise in their 6th year, though it had always been a raw, visceral thing, born of teenage hormones and fear. Blaise was dark-haired with skin more olive than black, and freckles all over. He was gay, like Draco, but much preferred to keep that on a need-to-know basis. He also preferred to sleep around in a way Draco had never managed to get the hang of.
Running his hand of the polished handle, Harry couldn't help remembering the first time he'd flown at Hogwarts, when Draco had hurled Neville's Remembrall and Harry had gone after it.
"You're just so lovely, even though - you know - and you don't mind, you just - just buy things and they're
Harry was not surprised then that it had taken two and a half weeks before Draco had initiated anything more than a long hug, and they’d had a sort of frenzied sex in which Draco had taken control completely, a frightening contrast to their usual dynamic. Afterwards he’d cried, and Harry had held him softly at first and then tightly to remind him that he was safe and that Selwyn wasn’t coming back, and that if Draco never wanted to have sex ever again then that was just fine with Harry.
Potter moved minutely, and Draco's neck and chest prickled with mortified heat. Draco's erection was pressed against Harry-fucking-Potter, and there was a giant erection pressed right beside it. A massive
Maybe it was the first time they’d met in the bar when Draco had softly whispered “I didn’t expect to see you here.” Which Harry had thought was a bit rich at the time because it was a muggle bar and Draco had the whole pure-blood thing. Or maybe it was when he realised Draco was flirting with him, because it was also a gay bar, and the shirt Harry was wearing was most definitely not designed to scream ‘STRAIGHT’.
Potter started carrying him toward the lounge and Draco pulled out of the demanding kiss to gasp what he hoped sounded like 'bed' before submerging himself once more in the stubble and lips he'd started to know so well.
But he was in love, with Draco, and finding out Draco was androgynous was honestly quite exciting to Harry. Harry had released a while back that he liked men as well as women, and he'd realised long before Draco came along that he also liked men and women who chose not to conform to gender stereotypes. He was massively into long-haired men, and buzz cuts on women. He loved a men's shirt paired with breasts and short skirts on hairy thighs. He loved the contrast of masculine with feminine and he loved confidence. So it figured that Draco with his sharp yet delicate features and his contradictory elegance and androgyny and his sheer, unrelenting arrogance would be just Harry's type.
Draco had absolutely refused to get fitted for maternity clothes in his usual fashion, and being so slim, he had found himself no longer fitting his wardrobe quite early on in the pregnancy. He’d instead opted to wear a combination of Harry’s hoodies (these were now unfortunately also too small), pyjamas (emerald, silver, midnight or powder blue, or black; all silk) that had been enchanted to be whatever size he needed, and the dressing gown.
He'd donned jeans, t-shirt, and hoodie, which was just typical of the Saviour's complete disregard for fashion. With a firm grip on Harry's generous bicep, Draco had guided a clearly dazed and confused Harry-fucking-Potter to the Apparition Point just outside the Ministry's nearest exit, and had brought him home to the spacious London apartment he preferred to his ancestral home.
“Oh sod off, you silly bugger. We managed a couple of weeks ago. Here,” Harry retrieved the belly pillow from where it had fallen on the floor and wiggled it under Draco’s lower back, raising his hips so Harry could get closer to Draco despite his swollen stomach. “Now, where were we?”
"What?" Despite still being fully unclothed, Draco ducked back into Potter's shower immediately. Potter was still leaning away from the running shower, examining his fingers, which did have a little pink residue and were undoubtably... glowing. "Wash it off!"
Harry scrambled out of bed, trying to clear his thoughts which were whooshing round in his brain, colliding with each other.
Draco wasn't sure where Potter got the idea to make him beg for it, but lately he'd been holding that delicious cock hostage in some kind of cruel humiliation tactic.
Draco’s musing about exactly what kind of ‘robe’ one would normally wear in this situation was cut short by the return of Harry and his now-lubed magical fucking fingers.
It was really a miracle he wasn't worse off, he supposed, unbuttoning his robes. The potion was all over his skin, and he felt fine. It was a lot more than could be said of some people experimenting in potions. With his things settled and slime-covered robes dropped unceremoniously on the floor, Draco pulled aside the curtain to turn on the water.
No, going forward, he would conduct all his experiments at home, in the well-stocked and eternally spotless potions laboratory at the Manor. It was a plan that was preferable to his current situation - sharing a lab and cauldrons with Merlin knows who, and Merlin knows what potions - twofold, because not only did it afford him privacy and confidence in the sterility of his equipment, but it would also take him far, far away from the prying eyes of Harry-
"Oh darling. I don't mind. It will look like you, and I love you so much. I can't wait to see the baby you've made. It doesn't matter what he or she looks like, I just want to meet them."
In a very short time, he'd made a total nuisance of himself. Unfortunately, he'd also been right, at least in-so-far as the potion went. It turned out that simply being in the shower cubicle next door to Harry's had been almost painful separation, and Harry had such low self-restraint he'd actually followed Draco in, watching in surprise as Draco dressed in his perfectly tailored neat black trousers, a simple white shirt and a fine-knit black sweater. His mouth had hung open the entire time and Draco had been forced to physically manoeuvre him back into his own stall to get dressed himself.
“Draco,” Harry breathed, barely audible to Draco over the thundering of his own arousal in his ears.
Thursday had been wet. The awful, pervasive, cold kind of wet that comes with persistent rain. Wednesday had been wet, too, but Wednesday hadn't brought him Potter.
"Hmm." Harry seemed intent on making Draco drop the glasses, pressing his lips to the skin on Draco's neck. "That's quite a lot of time."
They’d cleared all the extra staff from the room including the gruff healer who seemed to have been in charge, and there was just one healer left, who appeared to be weighing blankets in the corner. Draco was propped up on the bed, pale except for a residue of flush, and was smoothing his hair back, grinning.
Biting his lip, Draco simply said “Don’t,” and pulled Harry in by the front of his t-shirt for another kiss.
Potter sighed. "But I worked so hard on this one. I'm shit at writing things like this and they know it. I asked them to give me some feedback and they just said they can't show favouritism to any particular project. 'Come back with a more solid plan' they said. As if I know how I'm going to do it in advance!"
"You fuc-" Potter's hand was in his mouth. His fingers tugged on Draco's cheek, and Draco followed the fingers to glare at Potter's smug face.
Not giving Harry or his bookshelf another glance, Draco folded his legs under him in his favourite spot at the end of the couch, picking up the potions textbook he'd left on the coffee table this morning and flipping directly to the index.
"It's nice," Potter murmured sleepily behind Draco's head. "I like holding you. I like how you're mine."
wee-un that was coming and they weren't ready to come. Now git a wriggle on or this child will think it ent wanted."
The first finger took Draco by surprise. Harry had certainly not given him any warning, and suddenly his finger was stroking Draco’s arsehole and there were sparks of pleasure flickering up Draco’s spine. The finger pressed softly, angling inwards and then it was inside Draco, stroking gently.
"Yes, Potter, I really want it." Draco demonstrated by leaning towards the deliciously warm and wet cock.
"Mmm." Draco couldn't be sure, but he wondered if an effect of the potion may have been a loss of speech. Casting a quick cleaning charm over the both of them, he prodded Harry, who looked on the verge of drooling on his lovely silk-encased pillow. "You have to come too, remember?"
The finger slid slowly out and the sparks of pleasure became bolts as it was thrust back in. It occurred to Draco that he could have been doing this for a lot longer had he not wasted his youth with the Death Eaters and internalised homophobia.
"Mhmm." Draco felt himself nodding, which was obviously the fault of the potion, because Harry seemed to take it as an invitation to remove both items of clothing in a movement so smooth Draco could have sworn it was practiced.
"Oh. Right." He rolled himself up into a sitting position, blinking blearily at Draco. "That was good."
“Oh.” Harry decided this was consent, at least to the carrying and the back rub, and figured if the only thing he got from this evening was to see Draco comfortable enough to get a bit more sleep than he’d had lately then that would be enough. Sex would be a bonus, but not one he couldn’t live without.
It was glorious. Afterwards, Harry collapsed next to him, half asleep, exactly how Draco felt. Draco felt he could lie there forever, half under the Saviour, full of his come, satisfied. By the looks of him, Harry would have stayed there too, had the doorbell not rung intrusively.
Harry knelt and offered Draco his arm, which Draco used to pull himself into a sitting position. "This is ridiculous. How long were you planning to just leave me here? I've been busting forever."
The rocking slowed, and Potter leaned forward over Draco. With a muttered incantation Draco spelled away the sticky come from the sheets under him and lowered himself into the pillows.
Potter looked appeased and rose back up to meet Draco's waiting arse. He rested on the rim, bracing Draco's hips with his stupid strong hands. "
When Potter's lips parted at his earlobe and left a quick bite there, a small breath escaped Draco's tight chest. Potter seemed to take it as encouragement, because he grabbed Draco's head in both hands and brought their faces crashing together.
Harry’s chest hurt even now, after they’d been dating for two years, when he thought of Draco having to live as a boy during their time at Hogwarts, despite being attracted to boys and wondering if he should feel like a girl. After the war, with Lucius locked squarely away in Azkaban, Draco had considered living as a girl, but decided against it. He told Harry it felt more authentic to the way he'd spent his entire life to continue to present as a man but behave as just... himself, Draco. He had a naturally boyish figure anyway, tall and slim with very little in the way of curves and less in the way of breasts. His sex drive was high and he like to top and bottom about equally as much. He had sex with men he met in gar bars, and never allowed vaginal penetration. Never, until he met Harry.
Potter wore a fake smile. Anytime someone wasn’t looking at him he let it slip from his face. He didn’t laugh. His friends all talked and joked around him, but he never laughed. Potter always had a reason to avoid quidditch, he had to study, or tutor, or was just missing.
Potter nodded. Silent. Draco watched as the tears that had been in Potter’s eyes fell slowly. Damn it all.
“Help me get him into the bed.” Pomfrey instructed. Draco lifted Harry as carefully as possible and place him in the closest bed. “Now move to the side. And tell me what happened.”
“If you would like to stay you may. As long as you do not get in the way or disrupt any of my patients.”
It was Christmas day, Draco woke late. He wasn’t really looking forward to the day. With his father in prison and his mother stuck in the manor there wasn’t much to celebrate. Except this new thing happening with Potter. Harry? Maybe he should call him Harry if they spent so much time snogging.
“I don’t think you understand Madam he is one of my boys!” A plump red headed woman bustled in and straight to Harry. “Oh love, you poor dear.”  She fretted about him pushing his hair off to the side, feeling his head, then her hand rested on his cheek. Without turning she spoke again “Were you here all-night, love?”
“No” Potter replied softly. Draco nodded and started to get up and leave. “Please stay.” Potter whispered.
“Come on Luna will be there.” Potter offered. Damn him. Potter knew he had a soft spot for that Ravenclaw. Luna was always so sweet to him. Even after they imprisoned her. Draco tried to care for her as best as he could, brought her extra food and blankets. He even took punishments to protect her. But he never expected her to treat him the way she has since…as a friend.
Luna ran behind Ginny and was trying to hide. Ginny scooped up a bunch of snow and sent it at Potter as well.  Draco just continued laughing.
There were a few gifts at the foot of his bed. Draco sat up and scooted down. One was from his mother. There were a bunch of his favorite chocolates as well as a new book. There was another gift from his aunt Andromeda that was a new quill set.
Draco nodded and was then left to his thoughts. He sat there most of the night watching Harry, watching him breathe in and out.
“Then the war happened, and everything changed. Look I know you heard him when he spoke at you trial. Harry knew so much of what happened to you. Because he witnessed it. He was linked to Voldemort; he saw through his eyes. I had to listen to his screams Draco, his screams as he begged for you to be spared. Harry doesn’t hate you. He knows you had absolutely no choice in the matter. He forgave you long ago. We all did. We have no hate towards you at all so drop it ok?”
“I hope you don’t mind. I knew you spoke French and I searched for special sayings. This one stood out to me, it seemed the most accurate. ‘Nothing is real but dreams and love’.” Harry said looking at the pendent. “I hope it’s not too much.”
“That really does need to get looked at.” Granger said as she pulled his hand close enough to examine.
“I have to go; I just wanted an update.” Weasley said standing and looking back at his friend. “You’d better pull through mate. Mum will be here in the morning. McGonagall is keeping her at bay for now. Later Malfoy. Let me know if anything changes.”
“He loves you, git. He looks at you the way I look at Mione. The way my dad looks at my mum. The way Ginny looks at Luna. The way Dean looks at Seamus.”
Once the sobs slowed, he looked up into the sad face of the Weasley mother. He couldn’t understand why she was so nice to him. So, he asked “Why? Why are you so kind to me? I almost killed one of your sons. I was the reason the Death Eaters were here when your other son was killed. My father almost killed your daughter. Why?”
“You and your fucking hero complex!” Draco flipped around and stormed off towards the stairs. “Fuck you Potter. I don’t need your pity.”
“Gentlemen” McGonagall’s face was dark. “Please get this man out of my school. Immediately. Please let me know if you need anything further for your investigation.”
Suddenly snow was dumped on their heads. They pulled apart breathless and cold. Potter glared at the Weasley girl.
“I thought it was just the dream. Then I felt you, I don’t know it’s hard to explain.” Harry sighed.
McGonagall looked around “Alright there is nothing more to see, off to class with all of you!” Draco watched as she turned and walked down the hallway again.
Draco frowned and glared at the table. “No Potter. I am perfectly capable of doing my own homework.” Draco refused to look up. He heard the chair pull back and the sound of someone setting their books out on the table.
When they arrived at the school the new headmistress had decided to mix things up a bit for the students. The eighth years got their own common room. They also were roomed with students from different houses. No Gryffindor roomed with another Gryffindor and so on.
Harry smiled again, his eyes misty. “Draco. When we first met all those years ago I never would have guessed we’d end up here. Then as the years passed I hoped but still never could have truly imagined it. I love you so much that it baffles me, I have never known a love like I feel for you. You have always kept things honest between us, when the world saw me as a Savior, you saw Potter. When the world wanted a Golden Boy, you wanted Harry. Your love has made me better. I know that’s sappy, but it’s true. You make me better. You ask me why I do these things; the answer has always been the same. Because I like you.” Harry slipped the wedding band onto Draco’s finger.
Harry kissed him deeply again. As he did so Harry’s hands slipped down unbuttoning Draco’s slacks. Draco started unbuttoning Harry’s shirt. His skin felt like it was on fire, every part that touched Harry was tingling with energy.
“Draco I would do anything you want.” He pulled back eyes dark with lust. The sincerity in his face was enough to confirm that Draco was ready for this. For Harry.
“Yes.” Draco managed. “Yes, I will.” Harry slid the ring onto Draco’s finger as he stood. The room filled with cheering and clapping.
“And you are ok with that? With him loving a Malfoy?” Why is this so important to him? To have her approval.
Draco eventually took shelter behind a tree without realizing Potter was already there. Potter just looked at him, eyes gleaming with laughter. “Told you it would be fun.”
Inside the box was a silver ring with a thin green line in the center. The green appeared to be a solid emerald. How? When?
Without breaking the kiss, the door shut and locked behind them. He could tell Harry cast a silencing spell too, because the sounds of the party were now almost gone.
“Get help!” Draco screamed. He heard Hermione shout something. “Don’t you dare Potter. Keep your eyes on me.”
“What do you mean this time?” Draco almost turned. Screw that. He should just go one more step and all his pain would be gone.
Draco stood there stunned. His lips still damp from the kiss. His skin still feeling Potter against him.
Draco looked up at him now, the green eyes held only fear. Salazar, he should have stayed in his own bed. He shouldn’t be over here comforting some Gryffindor. But it was a scared Gryffindor. It was a scared Potter.
The entire Weasley family was sitting around the room. Along with Draco’s family and friends. Well at least his mother and his Aunt. Little Teddy was upstairs sleeping. His mother and Aunt were talking in the kitchen.
Propping himself up with his right hand, Harry set to work loosening the drawstring on Draco’s dressing gown.
The bizarre thing was, Draco hadn't been expecting an explosion because he hadn't yet altered it. He liked to fully assess a potion's constituent ingredients by brewing it as per the instructions before making any changes. It was part of his diagnostic process, to analyse the potion in its original form. It helped him appreciate the influence of each additive, so he liked to take his time and do it properly.
Draco wanted nothing more to do with the entire Auror Department. If they couldn't keep their nosey little Potter from interfering in perfectly justified potioneering, they should shut up shop for good - they certainly didn't appear to be apprehending any actual criminals as far as Draco could see. No, the most remarkable deduction Potter had made this week was that
The third finger was not so much a surprise as it was surprising. Harry eased it in slowly, and it ached deliciously. Draco could feel himself relaxing gradually around the fingers.
Draco sighed internally. He really was very busy, the International Light Wizarding Committee had recently unearthed a number of very, very old artefacts in Egypt which they had sent to Draco for analysis. Draco was becoming quite well known for his diagnostic and interpretive charm work and was finding he spent as much time working on existing objects housed at the Department of Mysteries as he did on objects being turned in by well-meaning and frightened witches and wizards who were concerned their precious family heirlooms may contain horcruxes or other dark magic. The International Light Wizarding Committee had sprung up after the War, and were particularly zealous contributors to Draco's workload.
"Er... Dr- Malfoy?" He walked back in through his own front gate, visibly red with exertion, sweat rolling off him, and breathing heavily. It was still half dark.
And sure enough, now that Harry looked, he realised the baby did look like him. She had caramel-honey skin under the redness, much lighter than Harry’s layered coffee-dark complexion plus tan, but already darker than Draco’s soft marble. She had a light smattering of jet hair on her tiny head, and a perfect little mouth, with pink lips, and when it opened, her toothless wail was achingly sweet - if very loud.
They hadn't meant to fuck, initially. Draco had felt his heart drop when Potter had strutted into the Mastery Preparation Course he'd been assigned to assist on. They'd spoken briefly in the class, to keep up appearances of civility, and Draco had reciprocated the nod Potter had left him with at the end of the first day. How they'd ended up fucking was anyone's guess really. Draco had made some snide comment about Potter's complete inability to form a sentence on paper without a quick-quotes quill, and suddenly they'd been bantering like they were back at school.
For some reason, there was a strong sensation that he ought to be doing something, that he was forgetting something. It was a feeling he'd had quite often recently, and he was starting to wonder what was wrong with himself. Sighing, he got off the couch, and went to find Blaise.
“Mmmf, you’ve been holding out on me, Malfoy.” Harry loved these moments, when they relived the tension of their school days.
As Potter carried Draco up the stairs to his bedroom, Draco noticed his heart had settled once more into a fast but steady rhythm. His lungs were screaming for more though - more of Potter's taste, his heat, his ridiculous magical power. It zapped at Draco, whenever they touched, but especially when Potter touched his Mark. Draco suspected the Mark was what made him so good at his job - it grew prickly when there was dark magic around, and it tickled when Potter put his mouth on it. Or stroked it with his fingers. Draco assumed the Mark must still be sensitive to both powerful magical signatures, which of course Saint Potter was blessed with, and dark magic, which the objects he assessed so rarely contained.
If Harry had looked surprised before, he now looked absolutely flabbergasted. "You eat curry? From muggles?"
As though he’d done it a million times, Draco flicked the edge of the blanket out of her way and guided the baby’s mouth to his nipple. She took a few attempts to latch on, but suddenly she was away sucking and her eyes snapped open, and Harry knew it was over.
If a naked Harry-fucking-Potter was a sight when he was wet, he was something else dry, in Draco's kitchen. Draco's double-crossing hands reached out and rested on the bloody bulging muscles of Harry's chest. Dragging his eyes away from the chiseled sculpture of Adonis in front of him, Draco looked up into Harry's dark eyes. They were practically glaring at him again, and Draco wondered if he was trying to devour Draco with his eyes.
Grabbing yesterdays robes from the armchair by the window, Draco dressed as quickly as he could and fled downstairs, shooting a final look of murderous rage in Potter's direction before he swept from the room.
dripped from the tip. Harry wasn't moving and Draco hadn't done this before but he was fucked if he wasn't going to start. Rocking back, he leaned into Harry's hips, then swung forward to pull off, nearly to the end, before slamming back into it. Harry must have worked out Draco's furious need for it, because his fingers tightened on Draco's hips and he began thrusting in slow, measured rhythm and it was all Draco could do to not come then and there.
"I did not. But certainly some of them would show traces of dark or intense magic," Draco barely stifled a laugh, "You could try them on Potter to see what makes his magic so out of control."
As always, they lay there, together, just breathing. Draco knew that Potter would stay the night now, he'd admitted early on that the nightmares that startled him awake were less common when he shared a bed. Draco had admitted some understanding of recurrent nightmares from the war, and since then, Potter had taken it as an invitation to stay whenever they wound up at Draco's place. Draco inferred he was welcome at Potter's when they met there, although he preferred the larger space of his penthouse apartment and usually dragged Potter there instead, either before or after fucking.
"Merlin, no. My mother would have a fit." Draco took a deep breath. "You can come to my apartment. Just for the night, and don't expect any special treatment. I'll have my elf make up the spare room and we can order curry from the place round the corner."
After eleven hours, Harry was absolutely, unequivocally exhausted. An hour ago, Draco had suffered an unfortunate tear, and had immediately banished Harry from the delivery room. Instead, Harry had been pacing up and down wildly in the waiting area, jumping at any healers passing by and being generally waspish and snappy when they told him they weren’t currently attending the birth, sir, please sit down and we’ll find someone who is.
"Well, Potter, I have some reading to do, since I have no idea what the hell was in my cauldron to make it explode and get us into this mess. I'm sure you can find something to watch on television that will keep you entertained. I believe there's a children's channel, which would be appropriate for a man of your... intellect."
Draco ducked under Harry's arm and grabbed a towel which he now realised was probably Harry's and should have been a dead giveaway that his preferred shower was in use. "It's a very simple potion, Pothead, just go home and it should wear off in a few hours."
Draco nodded, looking devastated, though he seemed to ease under Harry’s hands moving in steady circles on his back.
Harry was planning to come back. He was always planning to spend more time at Draco's apartment, and he'd started leaving stuff there to use the next time he visited. Draco hugged himself tighter.
Draco sighed. "I seriously doubt you will be able to comprehend advanced potions texts, Potter, but you are welcome to peruse my bookshelf as you like." He lead Harry back into the lounge, gesturing towards the wall adjacent to the kitchen, which was entirely bookshelf except for a large flatscreen and a small section of the shelf below which housed Draco's DVD collection. Mostly classics, including Pride and Prejudice (both versions), The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (one and two), and Love, Actually.
"Look, darling, I'm not saying that you are." She leaned back on the chaise lounge. "All I'm saying is that he's fucking fit,
"I read your research by the way. Your diagnostic spellwork has some incredible implications for interpreting magical signatures. Did you ever test it on people?"
Pausing in his attentions, Harry looked up from the sliver of beautiful ivory beneath Draco's shirt and took in Draco’s face, which was pink in blotches and very wet. Draco’s bottom lip was trembling and he wouldn't meet Harry's gaze. Harry felt the smile slide off his face.
." And then he buried his face in the pillow because there was no way in hell he was letting Harry Potter hear him scream when he came.
Draco snorted. "Obviously, Potter. I have a very well-rounded palate, thank you very much." And with that, he stalked into the next cubicle, where his emergency muggle-mingling outfit was waiting for him.
Draco continued to muse over the shortcomings of his fellow students as he stacked up his last remaining set of clothes: an emergency muggle-mingling outfit; and his shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and facial cleanser on the shelf beside his favourite shower cubicle.
In the lounge, he straightened his robes enough to cover the essentials and threw a handful of Floo Powder into the grate.
"What are you doing now?" Draco said softly into the pillow, still enjoying the sleepy bliss that follows a good orgasm.
"Draco." Harry took a deep breath. This wasn't the first time they'd had this conversation, or a version of it, and Harry was starting to run thin on new ways he could explain it. "Look at me," he grasped Draco by his arms and held him at arms' length so as to make sure Draco was paying attention, for Godric's sake.
Draco was curled on his side, nestled among a mound of pillows, watching another muggle documentary about exotic birds or lost tribes, and there was an (empty) ice cream tub on the coffee table beside a banana peel and -
Draco’s silver-grey eyes locked with his, from the honey-brown face of the most perfect, delightful daughter anyone had ever seen.
By the time they were tidying away the containers and plates, Draco had almost adjusted to the Saviour's presence in his kitchen. They were
"Right." Harry was blinking again, looking like a particularly thick owl behind his glasses. "Well if it's alright with you, I'll just stay here then."
Draco stalked down the corridor of the Ministry for Magic and decided that he would simply not bother to visit this wretched place any more.
. The kiss started rough, like previously, and Draco's softening cock gave a mournful little twitch. His arms came up around Harry's broad and bulky shoulders, and Draco relished in the feel of his surprisingly silky hair under his fingers. As Draco tipped his head up, deepening the kiss, it softened and he found Harry's lips gently sucking and pulling on his.
Merlin. He hadn't fantasised about Harry this hard since Hogwarts. Not that he'd fantasised much. Just after Quidditch games. And after they'd argued. And if they'd come to close to touching in a corridor or classroom.
Draco gave some kind of erratic nod, rather than trust his mouth to form words that weren't 'fuck me' or 'I'm fucked'.
“Fuck me,” Draco’s voice sounded needy and somehow detached from his body, “please…” and it trembled. The warmth of Harry’s cock against his opening pressed more forcefully, suddenly slipping in as though it was the most natural thing in the world.
The whole place was a circus, frankly, and Draco couldn't wait to be rid of them. He'd write to the Potions Masters supervising his project and inform them he'd be working from home going forward as soon as he'd washed off the residue coating his entire body and robes. He glanced down at the once-black robes now drenched with pale-pink slime. Scratch that, he'd write to them as soon as he'd made it home and changed out of these ruined robes.
"It was twenty minutes, love, at most. I will never leave you." Harry pressed a kiss to Draco's ear, as he gathered himself to his full height. It required a bit of effort these days, for Draco to walk. Harry watched as his slim and lithe boyfriend, normally so sophisticated, waddled - yes,
"Surely you are aware Terry Pratchett is wizard, Potter. No one could produce a volume of work that massive in a muggle lifetime."
Harry spun round, but Draco was just standing there, beside the bed, holding his belly (which Harry thought did look ready to pop, if he was honest). Coming round to Draco’s side he noticed the puddle on the floor, which must have been the water from Draco’s womb. Harry opened his mouth only for the words to die as he realised there were tears streaming silently down Draco’s lovely white face.
"Draco, look. I know you're worried that because it isn't mine that I won't love it, or that I'll leave you, but for the
So when Potter turned out to be bent as well, Draco threw caution to the wind and let himself enjoy Potter. And now the whole thing was ruined, all because the Ministry hadn't accepted Potter's bloody ridiculous Mastery project.
Another whimper escaped directly into Potter's hot, ravenous mouth as his tongue forced its way into Draco's. Potter's broad, strong hands travelled down Draco's back, as if to pull him closer, as if Draco hadn't pressed every fibre of his being into Harry-Fucking-Potter the moment their lips met.
Potter's fingers traced spirals on Draco's stomach. The spirals moved up his chest, covering his peck, coiling in on his nipple and then back out. Down, across his sternum. Out, over his ribs. Down further, then across to the top of his hips. The fingers were joined by the palm, flat on Draco's hip.
"You covered yourself in love potion?" Harry had a look of faint disgust on his face, but he was still pressed right up against Draco who remained pinned against the wall. "What kind of love potion would make you want to fuck me?"
And then it all made sense. Draco had been feeling sick all week and had finally thrown up this morning. He was pregnant. They were having a baby. Draco was having his baby.
"We wash it, obviously," Draco insisted, doing his level best to keep his tone light and breezy. "You must have touched it when you pushed me." He stepped forward into the stream of Potter's shower, which was warm but not as hot as Draco preferred. Tilting his head back, eyes closed, he let the water run down his head and back, wondering idly if he should turn around to preserve Potter's naïve muggle-born modesty. He decided against it, assuming Potter would likely be more alarmed by the sight of Draco's quite honestly superb backside.
They'd flown together often, at school, playing quidditch, and once they started dating it had been a fun date activity and exercise. Harry felt his crotch growing warm as he pictured Draco sweaty and flushed when they landed in some park in the middle of the night after a long flight from their flat, just because they could, and how Draco had pushed Harry against a tree and had kissed the breath out of him. They'd lain together in the wet grass afterwards and Draco had curled his moonlight limbs around Harry's and it struck Harry that if Draco was the moon, then he was the sun, or the earth, but either way their difference was in his darkness and Draco's cool light, and Draco's slimness and elegance and Harry's broadness and strength. It was in Harry's rashness and readiness, and Draco's considered patience, his contemplation and preparedness. They were wrapped around each other like yin wraps around yang, and Harry wanted nothing more than to stay that way until the end of time. Or dawn. Or until Draco got cold, and then they could fly home to a hot shower and a cosy bed.
"You taste like smoke. And strawberries," Harry whispered from where he was pressing little kisses below Draco's ear.
Potter just shifted his weight forward a bit, still staring at Draco's mouth. A hand appeared on Draco's hip and drew him closer and with a rush of burning heat to his face Draco realised he had an erection. An erection which Harry-fucking-Potter had seen. A massive,
“Then we will wait, patiently, like your father couldn’t, and we will love this baby just as it is, as long as it is ours to love.” Harry spoke slowly, and punctuated each pause with a squeeze on Draco’s shoulder.
The black (and pink goo) robes were his back-up set, a fine wool-blend with exquisite silver buttons. They looked absolutely exceptional paired with his snake cloak pin, which he had luckily fixed to the heavy-duty cloak he chose to go over the first set of robes before leaving home this morning. He knew full well how the backup robes had been ruined, it was when he added the blast-ended skrewt skins. Though mildly explosive, they really shouldn't have done anything to the potion. It was a simple school-girl's love potion. You know the sort, 'just add a drop to his juice and he'll have eyes only for you' and all that nonsense. No permanent alteration to the emotional state, certainly no specific or predictable behaviours, just a fleeting ardent affection that would wear off with a good nap, a hearty meal and eight to twelve hours.
“Okay then.” He swallowed. "Okay. It will be okay." He was fighting awfully hard to keep his tone even and soft. The last thing Draco needed right now was to be reminded of the awful incident with the rogue Death Eater who had managed to avoid imprisonment at the end of the war.
, or at least something designed to inflict pain. Instead of spells though, Harry had just said 'I love you' over and over again, and every counter spell that Draco tried would just produce Hippogriff keyrings that were circling around waiting to scratch him.
Draco stretched out his legs elegantly and started to sit up. "Well don't just stand there, I need to pee! Again!"
“I’m - oh god Harry - I’m so sorry.” Concern was sweeping through Harry as he watched the tears start to spill. Through tear-darkened eyelashes, Draco’s silver eyes finally met Harry’s face. Voice wobbling and unsure, Draco managed to get out “I’m - I’m pregnant,”
"Pansy!" Draco was pacing up and down on Pansy's hideous pink shag carpet. "Of course I'm not in love with him!" It was just like Potter to ruin a good fuck with
Draco rolled his eyes. "Honestly, Potter, what are you, frightened?" He tossed the towel to a still-dripping Harry.
Potter tipped Draco backwards onto the bed, which Draco had made up this morning with fresh ivory silk sheets. As Potter set about undoing Draco's trousers, Draco took a moment to imagine how he must look, pale on pale sheets, with his hair soft and loose like Potter said he preferred it, the two black tattoos on his forearms creating a stunning (if he did say so himself) asymmetry to contrast his natural perfection. The Mark, on one arm, now represented everything he worked to remedy and oppose. Twin bands on his other arm shifted and pulsed with colour as he cast magic, representing his commitment to magical finesse.
"What?" Draco demanded testily. Trust Potter to come here after a disappointing day, hoping Draco would help him lick his pathetic wounds.
As predicted, it didn't last long. Potter's cock brushed Draco's prostate and he tightened with the thrill of it. That tipped Potter over the edge and he picked up the pace, driving into Draco with great smooth thrusts. Draco came first, but within seconds (come still pulsing from Draco's cock) he felt Potter shudder and groan.
“I love you.” Draco breathed when he finally stopped kissing Harry long enough for Harry to catch his breath and lick the salt from Draco’s tears from his lips.
Potter leaned in and started pressing kisses up Draco's neck. Which was exposed, because Draco had rolled his head back to get away from the damp smell of Potter's hair,
He lowered Draco carefully into their bed, and helped lift his legs up. Draco was sleeping with about six pillows these days, tucked in between his legs, behind his back, beside, below and around the - admittedly very - large belly Draco was encumbered with. Harry grabbed the first of the belly-pillows and started to tuck it under Draco’s right side, but Draco shook his head.
Draco had surprised Harry in the middle of the first trimester by suddenly becoming insatiably horny. Harry had had difficulty keeping up and by the time Draco’s libido had dropped towards the end of the second trimester, Harry had (understandably, he thought) been somewhat relieved.
"Your turn?" Draco asked, because he was apparently delirious, and for some reason had decided that Harry-fucking-Potter shirtless in his kitchen was a sight he needed to see
Gasping for breath and release, Draco looked down at where their cocks were being methodically wanked off together. Potter's penis was broad and dark, though Draco's was not much smaller.  As he watched, Potter's emitted a dribble of pre-come and suddenly Draco was thrusting into the hand, come spurting all over Potter's magical fucking fingers. The hand kept going, and with each thrust Draco emptied himself onto Harry-fucking-Potter. He was almost done when Potter shoved his other arm over Draco's shoulder to brace against the wall, his body shuddering as his cock erupted next to Draco's spent one.
"Do get on with it, Potter," he said, rocking back to brush against the glistening tip of Potter's ready penis. Potter slipped a finger in suddenly, giving Draco no time to prepare, and he hissed through his teeth.
It had fallen to Harry to spend months - years, even - convincing Draco that although he felt like a boy now, he was also in no way 'incorrect' for a girl. Hermione herself had explained to Draco that Clitoromegaly in premature babies usually only lasted a few weeks at most.
Then the hands were pulling at Draco's backside, lifting him, and he was pressed against the broad, sturdy chest, the ridiculous muscular stomach, and the hard cock of Harry. Fucking. Potter.
Draco was still deciding whether the work was a good excuse to steer clear of any public spaces or if it was an inconvenience. On the one hand, he was good at it. It was also an excellent excuse to never leave his little lab in the Department of Mysteries. On the other hand, it seemed to encourage people to want to talk to him. Not to mention the ridiculous number of items people had suddenly become suspicious of. His charms were ground breaking, Flitwick had practically jumped on him when he'd managed to corner Draco one day last summer. He'd read the report Draco had submitted to the WIzengamot in defence of Martin and Mallory Partridge, who had unwittingly purchased what had initially presented as a cursed necklace and had turned out - thanks to Draco's new assessment spells - to have been a defective levitation device. Rather than grant the wearer the ability to float a few metres in the air while walking, running or otherwise living, the necklace had unfortunately knocked the wearer horizontally incapacitated mere millimetres from the ground. It wasn't dark, merely defective.
"Well he must have forgotten to give it to them, because I found it with the magazines on my coffee table." Draco left, before Granger could try to make any more strange small talk - or worse, before the Weasel turned up.
- a bowl of explosive liquid which Draco had spent all morning extracting from a freshly shaved erumpent horn.
It wasn’t exactly how he’d predicted his evening would go, but then, Harry Potter had been ruining his plans since they met in Madame Malkin’s Robes For All Occasions.
"Harry's virtually burning up with magic. I'm sure any of the suitable spells would show his signature as unnaturally large."
Draco breathed in the smell of Potter's hair, which had been missing from his bed for six weeks too long, and felt Harry's thick arms wrap around him as if by reflex. He pulled back from where his head had rested against Harry's shoulder, so he could look him in the eye.
"Potter." Draco nodded curtly and stepped aside as Potter brushed past him. "Can I ask what brings you here?"
Oh. That would explain all the tears then. Feeling Draco’s sobs racking his slim body, Harry pulled him closer.
The nightmares were getting more and more bizarre. He'd just woken up from a new one that had featured Harry, dressed as Voldemort, casting a spell that Draco was sure was
"Draco," Harry followed him again, and wrapped his arms around Draco's waist. "Is it normal to feel like I need to touch you or I'll die?"
Draco hummed something like ‘mwumf’ and sucked in a deep breath. Harry’s fingers gave a couple of final thrusts, then withdrew slowly, replaced by the warm roundness of the tip of Harry’s erect cock.
I know I keep changing how many chapters this is going to be, but I'm pretty sure I've settled on 4. Yeah, hopefully 4. Please do let me know if you have any feedback, I am trying to improve my writing so all comments are appreciated.
Potter's lips were watery and warm and their slick wet bodies were pressed against each other in a way that Draco had no hope of overcoming. Potter stepped forward slowly, pushing him roughly back against the wall of their cubicle. Draco had had no time to catch his breath, but he was kissing Potter back like his life depended on it. It was brutal and rough, not at all how Draco was used to being seduced, and there was an urgency in Potter's hands, lips, tongue and hips. Potter was rutting against him and Draco found it impossible to deny the action was getting him off.
After two weeks, Draco was feeling very waspish indeed. He'd passed Potter in the corridor last week after a meeting with some other Charms Masters, and had stared right through him, striding very normally past, and not acknowledging Potter with so much as a glance, even when he'd called out after him.
will take care of it, and love it, and teach it to fly, and - and whatever else we want. You can teach it French if you want."
Six weeks after the incident, Draco was sitting at home, totally at a loose end. The house was tidy - immaculate, even - and he'd finished all the work he needed to do. He'd have gone out to the pub, but it was a Tuesday, and no-one was ever available on a Tuesday except Blaise, who would just ask him 'How's Harry?' and then laugh at him the rest of the night.
"So? Most people have to submit a couple of proposals before they're accepted into a Mastery. It's how they wheedle out slack students."
“Oh Draco. She’s gorgeous. Our baby. Our daughter,” His voice hitched in his throat. “What are we going to do now?”
. Long story short, if you had told him five years ago that he’d be losing his virginity to Harry Potter and by way of a dodgy potion, he’d -
- and started pressing kisses up Draco's thigh. Draco's pants were stretched over a half-hard cock that Draco could feel twitching with every kiss Potter planted. Potter's lips danced over the top of Draco's thigh, landing on his belly instead. Grabbing Potter's ridiculous hair, Draco guided his lips to meet his own hungry mouth. He raked his nails up Potter's damned hard Quidditch-abs and gasped as Potter bit his lip.
"What now, Potter?" The idiot probably couldn't remember how to wash himself. Certainly he'd never washed his hair before.
He hadn't counted on Granger being an up-and-coming. He successfully avoided her for the first hour, opting instead to consume enough aged whisky to make the edges of the room blurry.
, and Harry would keep it safe, obviously. It was the only thing he knew about his own infancy. It was a tiny broom, just right for a toddler, that would only get a foot above the ground at best, but was just like the one in the photograph Harry had of his parents.
“I love you too, sweetheart, obviously. Infinitely, even.” And then Harry did the only really sensible thing and hoisted the heavily pregnant Draco up into his arms, and carried him toward the stairs.
Harry peered at the baby, who was a lot of things, including red, wrinkly, adorable, and apparently asleep, but decidedly
Harry's eyes found their way back to Draco's and he looked so lost and confused Draco's heart did that awful skippy thing, and suddenly he was too far away, so he joined Harry on the path and launched into his arms.
Afterwards, Harry lay curled around Draco, one arm draped over his beautiful fecundity, and felt slightly affronted. “You really didn’t come?”
Draco took a deep, steadying breath, which only caught a little bit at the end. With eyes squeezed shut he whispered slowly as though the words might break him.
As he made his way into the shower block (located conveniently close to the potions labs) Draco regretted not bringing in a second set of spare robes. The robes he'd picked out this morning were a stunning storm blue, which really accented his eyes and the paleness of his skin.  Those robes had gone up in flames when one of the moronic first year Mastery students had dropped -
Draco arched his back into Potter's chest, gasping as the fingers inside him stroked, stretched and slipped out.
"It's unreactive, Potter, I wouldn't worry your tiny head about it." Draco started to arrange his things on the shower shelf right beside Potter's - his favourite, stolen - stall. There was an urge to march back in there and demand Potter give up the shower instead, but frankly Draco couldn't bear to give the Auror any other reason to suspect him of anything, being so clearly an object of Potter's professional focus already.
“I did not. But it’s not your fault, obviously. I was close, sort of, but I also just don’t think I feel sexy anymore. Not like before.”
It was a good kiss - the kind that Harry had missed lately, the kind that said I know you want me, but you’re going to have to show me how much, and also hurry up because I want you, now.
Potter was still pressed inside him, apparently intent on torturing Draco until he came embarrassingly soon.
Draco moved forward slightly so his head was out of the torrent. There was still potion on his chest, but there was no real sense of urgency to wash it off. A perfectly harmless, incomplete potion would be unlikely to do much damage. Certainly, he couldn't feel anything untoward. His heart was thudding, but that was a natural reaction to shock, and it was certainly shocking to be sharing a potion disaster with Harry-fucking-Potter.
It didn't sound too bad, really, Draco was always on his own these days, trying to outlive his family's reputation, and some company would be good.
"Malfoy!" Potter had leapt back against the wall of the cubicle, but not before Malfoy had got a good view of... well, everything.
"Er. Well. For research, I suppose. You could come home with me and I can report any side-effects in my Mastery thesis."
Despite maintaining his cool exterior toward Potter he was having a fairly irritating couple of weeks. He'd gone out with Pansy and Blaise, and they'd naturally riled him up, asking if he was in love yet or not. He'd brushed it off, but it had spoilt the evening, and he'd felt physically ill towards the end of the night. It was unfortunate, because he was looking especially divine this evening, and a very handsome blond gentleman had just offered to buy him a drink, and Draco had briefly entertained the idea of having some fun with him before a wave of nausea swept over him and he had to excuse himself.
Draco's lips formed a little pink O and he seemed to be processing Harry's words in a way he hadn't last time.
Harry stopped making circles on Draco’s back and brought his hands up slowly to cup the damp face in front of him. “It’s okay, I promise.” Draco’s tears were warm under his thumb, and Harry made an effort to wipe them away. “What would you like to do?”
After a minute, Potter eased over so he was beside rather than directly on top of Draco, and flung a bulky arm round Draco's middle.
Late one evening, almost a month ago, Selwyn had caught up with Malfoy on his way home from St Mungo’s, where Draco had nearly finished his healer training. Draco had stumbled into the flat he shared with Harry much much later than he’d been expected, tight-lipped, bruised and bloody. Worst of all, he had a hunted look in his eye that Harry had noticed stuck around for most of a week, and still now would reappear if Harry startled him or was in any way rough.
Draco moaned and released his hand, wrapping both his arms around Harry. Harry tugged a little harder forcing Draco’s head back so he could attack his neck. The kisses were gentle then he added a lick and a bite. Draco stumbled back into his now open door. Harry was doing his wandless magic again. Damn that was hot.
Draco just sat there confused. Then he started replaying the things that had been happening. The fact that Draco could always calm his nightmares. The look on Harry’s face when he saw Draco. The grin that had been so prevalent lately. The laughter that had come back into the Gryffindors life. The way they always found a reason to be near each other. The smiles that Draco always felt when he saw Harry. The way he looked forward to seeing him anytime they actually had to separate for any reason. The way Draco felt watching Harry fall in front of him bleeding. The way his heart broke thinking that could be the end.
But their friendship was just that. A friendship. Even when they shared a bed it was never anything sexual. They just slept next to each other.
One beautiful Spring day they decided to go to Hogsmeade with their friends. The day went well they were talking and joking. Draco was able to get some new cloths at Gladrags. Harry got some treats from Honeydukes. While Hermione and Pansy were talking about some book they saw at Tombs and Scrolls. They had all just left Hogshead when Draco heard a voice.
Eventually Draco must have fallen asleep. Because he woke to the sunlight shining in. And something was different.
Hermione spoke. “We were in Hogsmeade ma’am. We had just left the Hogs Head where we had lunch when this man… he started calling Draco, like he knew him. But he sounded friendly at first so Draco stopped to see who it was. Then the man came up and he”
“Oh sweetie, like I said he is one of my boys. I may not have birthed him, but he was one of ours as soon as we met him. I know him as well as I do any of my children. I knew long before he did.”
“I had another nightmare. It was worse than the others. I didn’t think that was possible” Draco whispered to the ceiling. “I watched you die Harry. Please don’t do that. Please don’t die. I can’t…” Draco felt the tears slowly falling. “I need you. I love you.”
There was another pop and three more people in the hospital. Hermione, Pansy, and a tied-up man. Draco saw red and tried to rush the man. “You!” He would have killed him, he should have. There was a flash and an invisible barrier popped up.
“And? That gives you the right to attack?” Potter stepped forward as he spoke. Each word was asked with such anger Draco shivered. “You feel that you have right to attack anyone who’s sexual preference is different than your own? What about me? Am I next on your list?”
“I love you too.” Draco practically climbed into Harry’s lap before pulling him into a deep kiss. “Why would you want to live with someone like me?”
“I’m not sure Minerva. I have a faint heartbeat.” Pomfrey was casting spells Draco had never seen before. “The blades were poisoned. The wounds don’t want to close.”
A few hours later he woke with a cry and tears in his eyes. He slowly crawled out of his bed and quietly walked back to Harry. He climbed up on the far side of the bed and laid quietly next to him.
“You hit your head pretty hard Mr. Malfoy.  I’d suggest you take it easy.” Madam Pomfrey came over and looked into his eyes, shining her wand testing his vision or something like that.
There was Potter with a big grin. Damn even in his half-asleep state the bloody boy was gorgeous.  “Happy Christmas.”
The man made it within feet of him before Draco felt uneasy. “Your family ruined everything! Die!” The next second he flashed a pair of knives one in each hand and he jabbed forward. Draco saw it all in slow motion. He watched wide eyed as the blades aimed for his stomach, then he was shoved to the side. There was a bang and Draco hit the ground.
Draco looked down he was covered in Harry’s blood, he got up and found the closest sink and started scrubbing. He scrubbed so hard, but it was like the blood wouldn’t go away. Grief took over and he lost it with the bloody soap still in his fist he punched the mirror shattering it pain radiating through his fist.
“Sometimes ma’am I’m sure you are giving me some gross liquids calling them potions just to make me squirm.” Harry rasped out after taking the potions and sputtering.
Draco scooped up snow and threw it, he missed though and hit Weasel. Then it was a free for all. People were throwing snow balls back and forth. Running and dodging. Laughing and teasing.
“Stopping to snog isn’t going to save you!” She laughed as she ran away. Potter chased after her fussing and throwing a snowball.
At that Weasley outright laughed. “You’ve been nothing but good for him. Mind you, except for this” he paused thinking. “And the childish crap from before. The changes in him since you two started your ‘friendship’ have been astonishing.”
Pansy looked up at him sorrow in her eyes. “I can’t imagine how you must be feeling. I know how you feel about him.”
Draco sat there for a bit longer before trying to freshen up and manage his hair somewhat. There was a knock at the door and Pansy stepped in.
Draco’s head hit the ground and in the dust, he saw the other man had gone rigid. He was ecstatic, he lived! Then he saw Potter drop to his knees.
“They don’t hate you.” Potter reassured. Looking for some reason as if this was very important to him.
The kiss was more intense than any previous. There was a hunger there that scarred Draco slightly. Draco could feel Harry’s arousal, it matched his own. He wasn’t ready for this though. He pulled away ever so slightly “I’d like that, I want to be your boyfriend.” Harry smiled like it was the best news ever. Then he leaned into the kiss again. This time a quick peck before pulling back.
Weasley sat on the edge of Harry’s bed looking at Draco his face not of anger, not of anything really. “I don’t understand.”
“I…saw that you were coming up here. And I worried about you.” Potter replied. He could imagine the shrug the boy gave. Potter didn’t actually worry about Draco, not specifically, no he just had to play savior over and over again.
Behind Draco were his two closest friends Blaise and Pansy. Next to him Harry grinned. Harry’s best friends were behind him. Ron was holding Hermione’s hand, Hermione was crying softly. In between Harry and Draco was Luna, she was their officiant. And it was just as weird as you could imagine. It was perfect.
Harry was picking up pace. Merlin, he felt amazing. Draco whimpered slightly when Harry broke the kiss, releasing his head. Then before he could properly protest Harry had grasped Draco’s cock. His hand slightly slick from the lube slid up and down with ease. Draco felt the pleasure building, before he could warn Harry though Harry almost growled “Come for me.”
Draco worked in silence refusing to look up for a long time. When he did Potter was just sitting there doing his own homework. His dark hair falling into his eyes, he tried to push it back but seconds later it fell again. He should tie his hair back, stupid prat. Potter was biting his lip in confusion.
The dining hall could be so loud sometimes. Draco really wanted to avoid it, however Pansy flipped out on him for missing a few meals. So, he had to promise to come to the Great Hall. Draco tried to ignore the glares, the whispers. It would be much easier if his friends were here, they were probably off snogging again.
Draco looked at the boy sleeping next to him. He then felt his hand, at some point he must have grabbed Harry’s hand, because their fingers were intertwined.
“He’d never push it, he always said he knew you didn’t feel the same way. Lately he’s just been happy with the friendship.”  Weasley explained. “You really are oblivious, huh?”
“Budge up.” Draco said. Potter sat up pulling his legs up to him. “They were bad, huh?” Draco climbed up into Potter’s bed. Sitting cross legged in the middle.
“And because that dude is a bloody git.” Muttered the Weasel as he pulled Potter away. “Come on mate let’s get you to the hospital wing. Maybe we won’t miss much if we hurry. Love? Let the professor know where I went please.”
Within ten minutes Draco was bundled up and walking out the common room with Potter. Potter was giddy as a child. Draco always loved snow, but not as much as it appeared the Gryffindor next to him did. Once they were outside he wondered what they would do.
Potter snorted with laughter. Draco ignored the effect Potter’s smile had on him. “Slughorn thinks I have rainbows coming out my arse.” Potter laughed again. “I keep trying to tell him I only did so well his first year here because I had a good book. He doesn’t believe me though, he thinks I just need to ‘work out my kinks’.” He tried sounding like Slughorn, Draco rolled his eyes.
Luna was dancing near the radio with Molly. Charlie and his boyfriend Andre were debating something with Percy and Bill. Fleur was talking with Pansy. Ron and Blaise were playing chess again. Seriously is that all they know how to do? George was talking to his father about a muggle contraption. While Harry, Harry was missing.
That flipped a switch in Harry he reached one arm around Draco and promptly flipped him over on his back. With another trail of kisses Harry lowered one hand down gently passing Draco’s erection, past it to his arse. Harry must have cast the lubrication spell because one slickened finger was circling his opening. Harry hesitated again. “Please Harry.” He pushed his finger in and ever so gently started thrusting in and out.
“Oh, mate that wasn’t wise.” Weasley came up on the other side of Potter, also facing the attacker. Draco felt a hand touch his arm, ever so gently. He looked over and it was Granger. She also looked angry, but not at Draco. He was confused.
The sun was out and it was a beautiful day. Warm and comfortable. Other kids were running around and joking. Some were splashing in the lake. Some were playing with some sort of muggle ball, Harry told him it was a football.
“No! For fucks sake Draco, I just want you guys to not hate being around each other!” Harry turned away shoulders slumped.
“Help!” Draco screamed in the large hospital wing. “HELP! Please! Don’t you dare close your eyes Potter! We are here. We are safe. Stop moving.”
Draco thought she was talking to Harry, so he remained quiet. Then she turned though facing him. “Oh, dear you look ill too, you haven’t eaten, have you? Here love I have a few things.” Mrs. Weasley started pulling out biscuits and bacon and even a bowl of eggs from her purse. Draco wanted to turn it down, but his belly was a traitor and it chose that moment to growl loudly. “Here love, Harry is so very fond of you, he would hate to see you neglecting yourself.” She placed on the food on the table next to him and then produced a fork.
Potter’s green eyes searched locking on to his own eyes. “It’s going to be ok Potter, just calm down.” Draco looked down at Potter’s shirt it was soaked in blood. It had been white, the blood though, it was everywhere. Draco yanked off his shirt and pressed it into the wounds. He heard Granger try to cast the healing spell, but it wasn’t working something was strange about the blades.
That is when Draco finally noticed the blades had the dark mark on their handle. They were Death Eater Blades. The man was a death eater. Draco’s mind went back, he was there at the manor he came and went within the inner circle. The man was trying to kill Draco because of Voldemort’s fall.
Draco decided to go study in the library. At first his friends had joined him; however, they were now off snogging somewhere and Draco was alone again.
"Much better," Harry said, his hands holding Draco firmly by the hips so he could look at Draco's exposed chest.
"How long do we wait before we go?" Harry had stopped tugging on his hem, presumably because his pesky hands had achieved their ulterior motive, which transpired to be infiltrating the interior of Draco's clothing, where they were caressing his bare skin.
Harry chuckled and took a moment to admire how domestic they must look, with Draco's delicate ivory hand in his broad, coffee-caramel one. With a hand on the small of Draco's back he guided him round the coffee table and the cushions that had fallen to the floor.
Draco swallowed and nodded, holding out his arms for the blankets which Harry now realised were full of baby.
They carried on with the back and forth all through the week of workshops and all through the pub session at the end of Friday, and by the wee hours of Saturday, they were shagging.
is blond, Harry," Draco hissed. He looked up at Harry, a faint crease in his brow. "She’s yours. She’s
The breath caught in his throat. His lips were aching violently, and before he could think of anything to say, Potter had grabbed Draco roughly by the face and had leaned down to smash their mouths together.
Harry groaned into Draco’s mouth with the delicious pleasure of it, and Draco’s hands tightened on Harry’s t-shirt and then released him, only to reappear at the bottom of the shirt, pulling at the hem, working it up Harry’s broad chest. Harry broke from the kiss long enough to reach behind his head and yank the shirt off in one motion with his left hand and then his lips were back on Draco’s and he was less salty now, but just as soft as always.
"Hello, gorgeous," he said, nodding at Draco. "Darling," he said, kissing Pansy on the top of her head.
"Er," Draco considered the options. Neither sounded terrible so he went with his gut instinct. "Knees?"
drama. Last week: "You're importing too many Ashwinder eggs, Malfoy, I think you're up to something." Draco seethed. What an absolutely appalling waste of Auror time, investigating a Potions Mastery student.
Harry knelt at the edge of the bed, gently easing Draco’s legs apart so he could rest his chest between them and wrap his arms tenderly around Draco. His eyes prickled and he felt the corners of his mouth breaking into a grin, as the tears spilled over and left hot trails down his cheeks.
His heartbeat was really going ballistic at this point and Draco felt like he was in imminent danger of his face burning off, despite the cool water running down his back. It was impossible to think over the thundering in his chest and he really hoped for the world to end right now if possible.
"No, I - I know that we'll - we'll be fine, but," he rocked back on his heels, his eyes imploring Harry to understand. "But what if it doesn't look like me? What if - if all I can see is
It was red, which obviously had annoyed Draco because his en suite was themed in white, beige, and baby blue, and the red monstrosity had destroyed the aesthetic. Harry had just laughed at him, and kissed his nose and had left for work. In hindsight, it wasn't even Harry's actual toothbrush. The one at Harry's place was a faded orange, with horrifically worn down bristles. Draco had teased him about it mercilessly the first time they'd come home together. The next time Draco had visited Harry's, there was a new blue toothbrush, which Harry had used, and a green one which Harry had taken out of its packet for Draco to use. Which had always been there since.
Potter moved closer. "Your lips are so red, Malfoy." His eyes glinted dangerously. "Have you been eating ice lollies?"
Draco raked his eyes over Potter, who'd removed both their shirts and was tugging off Draco's trousers. "Like what you see, Potter?"
even, though not about anything so substantial as the fact they'd just had mind-fuckingly brilliant sex not an hour after wanking each other off in the ministry showers.
Draco closed his eyes. He couldn't look at Harry-fucking-Potter right now. Not after what was possibly the best orgasm he'd ever had. Not after Harry-fucking-Potter had just given him the best fucking orgasm of his entire fucking life.
It was the fault of the Ministry, Draco was sure about that. If the puffed-up, decrepit members of the British Wizarding Mastery Council hadn't rejected Potter's proposal for his Defence Against the Dark Arts Mastery, Harry would have been in a better mood that Thursday, and none of this would have happened.
Granger had looked at him oddly, quirking one eyebrow alarmingly high when she picked up the ticket stubs that Potter had affixed to Draco's fridge for no reason other than to clutter up the place.
Draco blinked. A smile slowly slid into place, and his cool fingers took Harry and guided him downwards.
Draco crossed his arms and stared him down. "The mighty Gryffindor, scared of a little potion? This is a change. Wait til the Prophet hears about this."
For a long time, they’d had just anal sex, first with Harry topping, but over time Draco brought out his strap-on and they explored each other differently. The first time Draco had asked Harry to finger him, Harry had been so startled he had stopped moving mid thrust - partially because he was surprised and partially because the thought of feeling Draco's most fiercely defended secret was enough to put him right on the brink of finishing. Unfortunately, Draco - who was straddling Harry at the time - was not privy to Harry's lust-drenched thoughts and had suddenly gone very white because he’d thought Harry didn’t want to. Harry had managed to kiss away all his fears and convince him that if Draco was ready, and wanted to try it then Harry was absolutely on board, actually, and nothing would make him happier than to oblige.
They met a bunch of other people down by the frozen lake. Someone had started a blue fire bon fire in and people were hovering around it. Talking and laughing.
McGonagall came in then with Pomfrey by her side. “Oh, good you are up and eating Mr. Malfoy. I was going to have breakfast sent up soon, looks like Mrs. Weasley beat me to it. Good Morning Molly.”
“Even after the war all he has done is worry about you. You were going to trial? He had to speak for you. You were going to have a hard time at school? He volunteered to be your roommate, even knowing you’d hate it. He heard rumor you were being hexed? He found the culprits and put the fear of Godric in them. The nightmares he has, all the time? Those are the ones where he is too late. The ones where he failed. Not us, not the world, you. He fears you being hurt. You dying.”
“I’m sorry Master Malfoy, I have to make sure this one gets the punishment he deserves. And my master would not approve of you getting in trouble over this…being.” The house elf bowed.
Harry did just that. He pulled out and slowly pushed back into him setting a slow but steady pace. Harry gripped Draco’s hips firmly for a moment before leaning down placing one hand beside Draco’s chest, the other he pulled Draco up towards him kissing him.
Draco watched as he slipped off into sleep. He was suddenly fearful that Harry wasn’t going to wake back up again. But then he heard the whisper “I really do love you.”
Before Draco could dwell on it though a snowball smacked into the side of Potter’s face almost dislodging his glasses. The shock on his face caused Draco to burst out laughing.
Draco didn’t give Potter a chance to reply. He went back towards the eighth-year dorms. Even though all the eighth years shared a common room they were at least granted individual rooms. Draco didn’t even look back to see if Potter followed. He didn’t care. Potter and his stupid friends always butting their noses into everything.
Harry pulled out his fingers and crawled back up kissing Draco deeply once before sitting up and positioning himself. “Tell me if it hurts.”
Draco really tried at first to continue his hatred of Potter. Potter just took it. Nothing seemed to aggravate him anymore. No jabs at his hair any of the usual taunts. Even Potters friends only had appeared mildly irritated when he teased them.
This time tomorrow the entire school would know, Hero Potter saved the poor little Death Eater from taking his own life.
Harry pulled his own pants off quickly and was pulling Draco back onto the bed. “Are you sure?” Draco was on top of him now their cocks pressed firmly against each other. Merlin, he could come just like this. He slowly moved against Harry, the friction was thrilling.
Eventually they started hanging around each other more, spending time with each other’s friends. They would study sometimes, they would just relax, or they would talk.
“No damn it! I want to spend time with you. And I do. All the time. I just feel like I’ve been neglecting them.” Harry sighed.
“Only Harry, he pushed Draco out of harm’s way. And I was too slow, I cast too slow.” Hermione was crying.
Then, a bit over a month ago, Draco had spent a good part of the evening warming Harry up and teasing him until he was rock hard and aching to fuck. He’d straddled Harry again, and had grabbed hold of Harry’s painfully-ready cock to direct it. When Harry reached round to starting working Draco open though, Draco had smacked his hands away. Instead of sitting on Harry’s absolutely throbbing penis, Draco had winked at him and had very carefully slipped it forward, into a wetter, silkier hole, and Harry’s eyes had widened, and he opened his mouth to check in with his boyfriend, but Draco had given a little wiggle of his hips and suddenly even though Harry was under Draco (let’s be real he weighed next to nothing) Harry felt himself losing control and thrusting as though his life was at stake. Though both of them had enjoyed it, they hadn’t yet got around to repeating the adventure.
"You're so gorgeous," he murmured against Draco's back. "So smooth." He ran his lips and scratchy chin up towards Draco's shoulder blades and whispered in his ear. "And so
"Mhmm." Potter was really very close now, and Draco's chest was doing the stupid jumpy thing it did when they got too close. "Can I play with you anyway?" Instead of waiting for Draco to respond - he would have said
They managed to collect the curry (Draco threw on a coat, for maximum speed and coverage, while Harry yanked on pants and trousers and greeted the muggle delivery boy shirtless) and eat at Draco's polished kitchen table without further incident.
"Mmm." And finally, Potter was easing into him. Potter was not his first, but still, after several months of this, he found Potter's cock particularly difficult. It was big, for one thing. Not quite as big as Blaise's, but an easy second largest Draco had ever experienced. It was somehow hotter too. Potter's cock seemed to double as a heating iron, he figured Pansy could use it to curl her hair if she ever changed her mind about being a lesbian. Draco figured the excess heat in both his cock and the rest of Potter's body was tied to his over-powered magic. Every movement of Potter inside him sent shivers up Draco's spine, and sent tingles through his own penis.
“Mmm. I think you’re very, very sexy.” Harry added a kiss to the back of Draco’s neck. “Plus I feel bad, I wanted you to enjoy it too.”
"Have you done this before?" Harry asked, tone light and conversational, as though he wasn't asking his arch-nemesis if he'd ever been fucked by the Saviour of the Wizarding World.
"Ouch!" The fingers vanished. "You little shit." Potter stuck the fingers in his own mouth and gave a gentle suck, looking woundedly at Draco. "I'm going to fuck you for that, Malfoy."
"Yes," Draco gulped at the low, gravelly tone Harry's voice had acquired, and moved the glasses to safety. "I suppose it is."
While Harry rummaged through the top drawer of Draco’s night stand, Draco attempted to slow his breathing and heart rate.
Now he thought about it, Harry's flat wasn't a total tip either, so the ticket stubs on Draco's fridge probably weren't an act of petty vandalism after all. In fact, now he thought about it, Harry's own fridge had lots of things stuck to it, mostly photographs and old receipts for things Harry had done with Ron and Hermione. Their wedding invitation was front and centre, all the Weasley's featured heavily, as did Neville and Luna.
time, I love you, and I want to be with you. This baby is your baby, but if you would - I don't know, get over yourself for a minute - I'd really like to be here for both of you, I want this baby as much as you do, I want this baby to - to be
Thursday wasn't their particular day - they didn't have anything like that - but Draco had found himself expecting Potter's visit nonetheless. They were more or less shagging twice a week now, and it hadn't got any less tantalising. There was something about the coarseness of Potter that Draco found intriguing. He was like sound, trapped in a bundle of person. He was hot, too, in every sense. He was fit, clearly, with thick muscles where Draco was lean and slim. His face was tanned and dark, with a strong nose and that frankly appalling mess of dark curls. It was such a contrast to Draco's own fine blond hair which never showed so much as a wave let alone curls. He was also warm, every part of his skin seemed to radiate heat, and Draco found himself touching his toasty skin compulsively.
"Muggle. But brilliant, nonetheless." Draco flicked his eyes down Harry's shirtless form and sighed before settling back into the index pages of his book. There was no reason not to look. If the Saviour wanted to flaunt his perfect six pack and bulging bloody pecks then why shouldn't he look? He chanced another quick glance at Harry, which was a mistake, but one that made Draco suddenly very pleased with the floor-to-ceiling bookshelf arrangement, because he was reaching for a book in Draco's muggle crime-thriller section and his arse looked fucking fantastic when he stood on his tip toes. Heat crept up the back of Draco's neck and he felt his mouth suddenly flooded with saliva.
explore his sexuality, between repressing feelings to hide from his classmates and family, joining the Death Eaters and the impossible mission to simply survive, followed by the constant repenting for his involvement ever since. Since leaving school, he’d thrown himself into his potions work and
"Oh sweetheart," Harry enveloped as much of Draco as he could. "Oh my sweet, sweet darling. This baby is not its father. Just like you are not your father, this baby is its own person, and we will love it because you made it. You.
Draco just nodded, breath caught in his throat, marvelling at the sensation of being stretched by Harry’s warm, thrusting fingers.
Oh god, he was drooling over Harry Potter. What an absurd predicament to be in. Obviously, Harry was fit. He was also a suspicious prat, a terrible Auror, and an idiot. So the potion was clearly very powerful, because Draco wanted nothing more than to go over and touch those incredible, chiseled abs. The thought of sliding his hands over Harry's chest, which would be hard, and warm, and scented with sweat and Ministry-provided all-in-one body/hair/face wash was doing complicated things to Draco's concentration, and was eliciting totally abnormal twitches from his pants.
Harry meant it, with every ounce of sincerity he had, he would love their baby as long as he was alive, because it was part of Draco and what was Harry's world if not all the parts of Draco? But that had obviously been the wrong thing to say, because Draco was sobbing again, and clinging to Harry's forearms like they were the only thing tethering him to the earth.
A week later, and Draco was feeling very antsy, suffering a bout of frustration that was both sexual and other, but was definitely unrelated to the Potter-love situation. Draco was still resolutely ignoring the incident, and had not contacted Potter beyond organising to leave three laundered hoodies, two pairs of socks, the book, a toothbrush, three Quidditch magazines, an umbrella, a scarf, a coat, a house elf-shaped mug, some ticket stubs from a gig they'd gone to at the pub they first shagged in, and a set of keys with a ridiculous hippogriff keychain and one key that Draco had never seen before, in Granger's office in the Department of Mysteries main office.
Harry slid the dressing gown off, and started to undo the buttons on the (emerald) silk pyjamas, plastering kisses across Draco’s cheekbone and down his neck.
Glancing down at himself, Draco realised he was in fact... shining. The parts of his shoulder and chest where the potion had soaked through his robes was glowing bright pink, much like Potter's hand.
“She's heavy," he cautioned, "definitely not premature. And she sure looks like her daddy, don’t she?” The healer winked at Harry as he placed the bundle carefully into Draco’s arms.
erection was pressed up against the taut brown skin covering Harry-fucking-Potter's exquisitely sculpted abdomen.
, you're lovely," Draco buried his face in Harry's shoulder, and held him as close as his bulging stomach would allow.
