“And that just corroborates the idea that some of you gentlemen are also being hypocritical, isn’t that right?” Harry attacked, referring to some wizards and witches who had supported the Dark Lord behind the scenes and that had escaped without being prosecuted.
“Is… is Seamus here?”
The happiest day of Draco’s life happened when Harry had agreed to live in Draco’s house instead of his apartment, which was not an appropriate place for such a large dog as Draco’s Saint Bernard. Brutus had stared at Harry the whole time and he had barked happily when he heard Harry’s positive answer. On the fifth day after Draco had gotten sick, Harry moved into Draco’s house with all of his stuff.
‘That’s because it is easy to irritate you,’ he retorted with a grin.
“He’s just recently graduated. I know you don’t think much of him, Harry, but he’s good.”
"Then you’re coming with me?"
“Daddy Drake is fine.”
‘I want you,’ I whispered.
So now he was torn between staying and going away forever.
Nathan nodded and Brutus barked. The dog raised his paw for Nathan to catch it. It was his way of saying goodbye to the child. Nathan smiled and even though Brutus was still dirty, he hugged him. While Draco led Nathan to the bathroom to watch his hands, Brutus did the same thing to Harry, who looked rather amused but also touched by the dog’s gesture.
“Oh, I’m feeling better already.” Draco looked down at his very alive manhood that was demanding for attention.
With small steps, he entered the living room quietly and stared at the five people with weird clothes surrounding a petrified Vernon Dursley. One of them had a stick pointed into his uncle’s red face. Nathan noticed that this man had the same untamed black hair that he had.
He stopped, but he didn’t look at me when he said, “It’s none of your business.”
It was almost as time had stopped. They kept staring at each other for a long time. Harry’s resolution of sending him away was diminishing against his better judgment. The truth was that he was confused by everything. He didn’t want Draco to walk out of his life, but at the same time he did. After all, he had seen Draco kissing another man.
“I guess this is the time to confess something.”
“It’s the same thing you do to me.”
“But...”
“That’s for him to decide, not you. If you love him, then fight for him. He still loves you.”
“I was. Our relationship is ruining your life, Harry.”
“The stuff we got from your secret room, or the little that was left after you had your fit, was really helpful.”
“I do, Harry,” Draco went back to the cold mode. “You do trust me, don’t you?”
Harry looked behind him and smiled feebly at the figure of his son with his thumb in his mouth. He knelt down on the floor as Nathan ran to him, and folded the little one protectively in his arms.
“Where’s my son?” Harry asked with a threatening look.
‘No! I don’t want to use the book to bring Slytherin back!’
Draco smiled. “The cute liar! He said he would be out of town on my birthday!”
Hunted was a strong word, but it was true. I felt chills down my spine.
“Then why don’t you leave me be? Why did you come to my aid?” I retorted like a brat.
“No, he won’t, sir.”
---------------------------
“Read properly. I wrote that we won’t be having sex with the same frequency as before. You know, for the baby’s welfare,” Harry explained kindly.
“He is and I love him,” Harry stated to make things very clear. He didn’t notice the flicker in Bob’s eyes when he said that.
“Did you sleep through my speech by any chance?” he asked, amused.
“But like I said,” Draco went on, “He didn’t do anything to me. I didn’t let him. And after I refused him, he stopped trying to have his way with me. I was very glad that he did. He looked just like you. It was very disturbing. Lucky for you I love you and I know your scent by heart. He couldn’t fool me because of that. But… Nostrums was really weird. I had the impression that he didn’t really care about conquering the wizarding world. I had the impression that he just wanted… I don’t know… recognition, perhaps? It seemed as if he was trying to prove that he was a very bad guy. He wanted to prove that to someone. And I also thought that he feared Nathan. I know it seems ridiculous, but that was what I thought. It was all so weird. I mean, why was he so worried about Nathan?”
“But why? What is it that they want?”
“Other father? And what’s goin’ on?”
“What we’ve just shared together was the most amazing thing I’ve ever experienced in my life.”
“I thought you were going to get rid of it,” I insisted.
"I want Drake and Brut to come."
“Yeah. Hi!” Seamus said with a cautious smile.
“It’s not your fault either!”
“Now I’m definitely feeling the energy,” Harry found strength to joke.
“You’re just saying that because he’s charming.”
“No. That was never my intention. When I locked you up, I thought I’d have time to make you realise how wrong you were, and how you behaved so horribly. But before I had the chance to teach you how to be human, I was killed... So it was a good thing I cast that spell before I died,” Nathan smiled sweetly, and Nostrums made a face. He hated to admit it, but that smile had always caused him trouble. That made him even angrier.
"I’ll keep the broom locked and he’ll only fly with me," Harry said, moody.
The reality was that the moment we arrived Harry took me in his arms – not in a romantic way – and we apparated to Madrid. On the upside, I could touch Harry without it being an issue. Unfortunately, apparating had its downsides. Even with Harry doing all the work, I still felt like throwing up as a side-effect.
“I’ll give you one more chance to answer me and then, if you insist on keeping your mouth shut, I’ll have to take some drastic measures,” Harry threatened him, taking his wand out of his robe.
And when the sun was up, and people all over town woke up and sang songs of joy, Draco didn't care much. He still found everything about Christmas annoying, but now he had he only thing he had missed the most in his life.
The stranger crawled into Harry’s direction and lay on top of him. The contact of their naked bodies was a shock for both of them.
‘What?’ I asked.
Harry laughed. “I kind of suspected that. Hermione is not very good at hiding secrets from Ron or me. I didn’t mind when she told me, and I don’t mind now. I’m glad you told me. And I’m glad that you went for it, otherwise we wouldn’t be here today, married.”
“We’re all guilty,” Hermione said sadly. “We should have been watching over him.”
Harry felt the anger rising at the thought. He scowled. “No, I don’t believe that. Even if that monster loved Toledo, I don’t think Toledo loved him. Toledo didn’t even hate him. Look at Nathan. He’s so peaceful. He couldn’t hate anybody. Toledo was just… doing his job by locking up Nostrums.”
“Oh, no! You’re not going to throw me out. You had me, too. We’re even in that matter. But we still have a lot to talk about. There’s a lot of unfinished business between us. And when I say a lot I really mean it.”
He easily deflected from all of them. In fact, at every spell I cast, Harry seemed to grow stronger while I was growing weaker.
“Never.”
“Never mind.” Nostrums gripped the Corona of Power in his hand. “You should keep this.”
"All right. Get Harry, then. See if he wants to be part of a threesome!" Seamus suggested.
Severus only nodded. “Very well. We must take care of a few things then. I will be following your pregnancy all the way. You won’t be in this alone, Draco.”
“I’m not going outside, Nat. Not right now anyway,” Harry assured him.
“All right.” And she whispered in his ear.
“No, I didn’t! Honestly, I wasn’t even in the building when it happened!” Lucius protested.
“Is Hagrid’s baby very big?” Remus asked, curious.
The train would soon be leaving. Nathan licked his lips and then turned to say goodbye to his family. He wasn’t surprised when he saw tears in Draco’s and Harry’s eyes. But he was surprised to realise that he also wanted to cry. He tried to hold back his tears the best he could because it wouldn’t look too good if he cried in front of all those boys and girls.
Draco didn’t like the way Fred seemed so keen to use physical or magical violence but said nothing about it. He understood what Fred must be feeling with the loss of Lee. He also had the feeling that Flint would make things very difficult for them, and Fred’s anger could be handy.
‘And when exactly will that be?’
“But he doesn’t know that. Besides, we were ordered to take care of him no matter what.”
“Since when are you so evil?” Draco asked, pouting. “We just wanted a few minutes alone to catch up...”
“I’m sorry, Harry. I’ll get you out of here, I promise you,” Ron assured him.
“I still remember quite fondly of that dragon cub you tried to bring from Romania, though,” he pointed out.
Harry smiled. “You’re the most understanding person I know. I wish I had your serenity.”
He was so surprised I felt quite offended.
“He means Draco,” Lucius cut him off. “And since you’re here, care to explain where my son is?”
Harry smiled. “Well, she was always the smartest one.”
‘Do you speak English?’ I asked her.
At his side, Brutus whined softly.
“I missed you so much,” Harry talked softly before kissing Draco’s fervent lips. “I couldn’t sleep all night because you weren’t by my side. I craved for you, my silver dragon.”
Harry felt a little uneasy after Draco’s inflamed speech. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
"Draco, what...?" Harry asked, his eyes lost in a daze. "What did I do wrong?"
‘You trust Potter.’
Mrs Weasley sighed. “Your father is having some trouble at the moment but he’ll return as soon as he can, dear. Your other father is taking care of it. Not to mention that the entire community is outraged by all that is going on.”
He made a face. “What’s up with you people and this bloody don’t-do-anything-stupid thing? I’m not a child! I can take care of myself.”
The fatidic day came. Harry dressed up in a beautiful dark green velvet cloak and wore a red mask with little diamonds in it so his emerald eyes were fully accentuated. He picked up the silly card invitation that Hermione prepared - which had two angels playing harps around a big red heart and a code so his match could recognize him - and he went to the party.
Another thing that Nathan was learning fast was that Mrs Weasley seemed to love feeding him every five minutes. He didn’t mind though. He loved everything about that house. The best thing of all was that they were the very opposite of the Dursleys and for that, he was extremely thankful.
"I’ll go," he decided, asking himself if he would come to regret his decision.
I closed my eyes and tried not to think of Harry, but that was as impossible as stop breathing. I let my feelings overtake me. You see, twenty years ago I had no idea that all that hatred was, in fact, love. I had always hated Harry Potter more than anything. And then, when my health had started to deteriorate and I had to look for professional help, the bastard made me realise that I had actually loved Harry Potter all along.
"The only way you could cheer me up was if you gave me a blow j..."
“Stop it, Harry! It isn’t funny!” Draco exclaimed angrily. After a few more seconds though, he joined Harry and laughed his heart out. They had tears in their eyes when they finally stopped. Draco lay in front of Harry beaming, their lips only inches apart. “Ok. It did sound funny.”
"Oh, my God."
“Well, you know how these things are. I think it won’t be but I’m not so sure. Besides, I have the feeling that there are more men hidden than the ones on the official want-list, and we won’t just arrest them all in a day. You know I’m their number one target. I can’t risk it.”
Angel got very interested in two plastic wands that were on top of the coffee table. I let Astoria take him by the hand and give him permission to touch them. Alfred was right beside me, watching everything as if waiting for the perfect moment to escape. Poor kid.
As for tomorrow... Well, tomorrow was another day.
"What if he wasn’t, Harry? What if the reason why they’d taken Nathan away wasn’t just for you to kill Voldemort, but also the fact that Nathan is special, more special than any wizard we’ve ever known?"
“You know, it’s ok if you want to stay here for the night. I understand.”
It took only five long minutes for the door to be open and the rounded and familiar figure of Vernon Dursley appeared in front of them.
"He won’t be a child forever." Lucius shrugged. "But I don’t feel like talking about this."
“Don’t worry, dad. I won’t,” Nathan assured them again, and by his angel face, it was hard not to trust him.
“I was only joking,” he said, grinning at Draco’s offended face. “Hagrid sent me a golden key that was found among Dumbledore’s stuff, and it was addressed to me. It’s a key to one of the Gringotts vaults. I wonder what’s in there. What do you think?”
“It was a scandal when it came out,” Severus began to explain. “It all started in the 70s, when Algernon Beecher, a sci-wizard, created a potion that would be able to get his lover Anton pregnant. He kept it secret at first, and when Anton gave birth to a boy, he told everyone about it. What happened was that other couples started to do the same thing, and most of them didn’t have the right guidance. Algernon forgot to mention that Anton had almost died giving birth, and so at least 10 men died giving birth to their children. It was a mess of huge proportions. In the 80s, a law was created and men’s conceiving was allowed only with a license of a renowned medi-wizard and a sci-wizard. The numbers of deaths decreased severely after that but sometimes it still happens.”
Of course it was. He couldn’t be rejecting me now of all times. We had come so far. That wasn’t what Harry meant, however. He was just worried about me and my health. I noticed that in his eyes.
I got pissed.
“Yes, we will,” Draco assured.
“Stop behaving like that, you two!” exclaimed Sirius. “You’re embarrassing Nathan!”
“Lucius is my responsibility.”
The letter finished abruptly as if something or someone had interrupted him. Five years had passed. Five long years... He wasn't sure what Harry's reaction would be after the first shock.
“That was because you provoked it,” Sirius said with a smile as if imagining the scene was amusing.
“Draco...” Harry said, his voice failing.
“I hate being apart from him,” Harry sighed.
“I’d love that, Harry, but only if you promise me not to babysit me all the time.”
“He did use some very dirty tricks,” Draco said in a whisper, his eyes filling up with tears again. “But that’s not why I’m crying. I’m pregnant. I’m afraid for my baby.”
“I’m not the devil, but thanks for the compliment. Does it really seem so strange that I want to be informed of what’s going on?”
“I belong to no one!” exclaimed the teenager, pointing his wand at Travers. He tried to hit Travers, but he was a beginner and all he managed to do was make a big hole in the wall in front of us.
I had fun thinking about Harry’s reaction when he finally realised that the Auror responsible for inspecting the raid in my house after the war - a man who was now retired – had been properly paid up by my mother to leave some things behind.
Even if their crazy story was real, Harry still didn’t trust their motives.
Ron and Harry started to talk about what was going on at the Ministry and Draco instantly cut it out. He hated when Harry talked about the office. The conversation always seemed to lead to a guy named Bob Stevenson and Draco had a tremendous jealous streak when it came to him. Not that he had any motives to feel jealous. He didn't even know the guy and Harry didn't talk about Bob with second intentions. He was only a 'guy from work'. But somehow he had the feeling that he wouldn't like him if they met.
Harry looked at him sceptically and so did Hermione.
“Who said I was punishing myself?” I retorted hoarsely. “It’s just music. Music is good for the soul, isn’t it?”
"Can I see the paper?"
“Yes, go ahead, Black! Go ahead and make a fool of yourself,” Snape provoked him. “Do go on! And perhaps I can add a few spicy details about my relationship with Lupin, and you–”
“Well, it is. But I promised to go back at night because...”
"So," Harry began.
Brutus barked at the raising of his owner’s voice.
He was about to take down the spell that was holding the magical dimension when he felt dizzy. He blinked a few times but everything seemed out of focus. His memories as Toledo were starting to fade away, and he was coming back to being just Nathan. He leaned against a tree and closed his eyes. He knew what would happen. His body was too young to handle such a strong power. It needed some rest.
“That information is highly classified, Potter! Or at least I thought it was... I think you really can’t trust anyone...”
"No one is going to take you away, Nat. No one." Draco kissed Nathan’s forehead.
“No, you weren’t.” Harry stroked Draco’s face and pulled him closer to him. “I’m sorry.”
“So you’ve come just because of me,” he provoked. Our eyes met and I wondered if his provocation was because things had always been like that between us, or if he was actually flirting with me. Of course, he wasn’t flirting. That would never happen. I was probably delusional.
Well, well, well. And what did that mean? Before I could say anything, however, Astoria showed up.
Harry moved on the couch uncomfortably. He didn’t like where the conversation was going.
Nathan took both of their hands and they went out to lunch.
"How do you know?" Draco raised an eyebrow.
-----------------------
"And what's that?"
“It’s not a trial. It’s just a preliminary hearing.”
“We decided to call your sister Hope,” Draco said. “What do you think?”
"NO! I won’t go! I won’t run off and that’s final."
-----------------------
He gave his back to Harry, still hurt by his previous comments, especially about the fact that Harry didn’t think he was good enough to raise Nathan. He knew Harry had said that in the heat of the moment, but he couldn’t help but think that deep inside Harry had meant it.
“That’s because he used a different name back then. Does Deadly Jo ring any bells?” Fred asked.
For Harry, it had been the last drop in his ocean of problems. His son had not only been taken away from him, but they also had the utter audacity to let the Dursleys raise him! The Dursleys, of all people! And not only that, but those horrible Muggles had made his son sleep in the very same cupboard under the stairs that he had been forced to sleep in years before.
I hate to admit it, but the sarcastic laughter he gave me left me very upset.
Nathan entered the room with a big grin and declared triumphally, “I beat him.”
“Bob.”
“I don’t care, Harry. That thing won’t be near our house! Besides, it’ll eat Brutus!”
“Everything ok?” his son asked.
“Well, maybe I don’t!” Harry shouted back.
"Shut up."
And so did my smile.
“C’mon, Nat! Let’s fly!” George said enthusiastically, taking Nathan to the garden.
He came even closer. Was he trying to distract me with his scent? I wouldn’t be that easily deceived. I wasn’t that vulnerable to his charms, at least not when my son’s life was at stake. Breathing, however, did become a little bit complicated.
A trip to Paris.
“This is all my fault,” Draco began. “If we hadn’t got married they wouldn’t be suspecting you.”
“What else?” Draco pushed himself further and Harry bit his lower lip.
“How long have you been living on the streets?” I asked more gently.
Draco was blaming himself for the attack at the Ministry of Justice, Harry realised that now. That was why he looked so distressed and nervous ever since it had happened.
Harry gulped. He shut his eyes tightly to prevent the tears from falling down his cheeks.
"For your protection. Don’t worry so much, Draco. You’re family. I just want to protect you."
“You have to subscribe to the Daily Prophet, Harry,” she said. “It’s important to keep yourself well informed about what’s going on in the community.”
“Don’t say it, Harry.”
“I want to change her name,” Draco stated seriously, looking at his baby carefully wrapped up in little white blanket adorned with two patchwork roses. He rocked her gently in his arms and smiled. “She’s so perfect.”
“How’s Angel?” I asked.
The doorbell rang over and over until Draco snapped, “HARRY! FOR MERLIN’S SAKE, THERE’S SOMEONE AT THE DOOR! I’M JUST ONE PERSON! WHY DO I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING AROUND HERE? IT’S ALWAYS ME, ME, ME! I WILL KICK YOUR ASS IF I HAVE TO ANSWER THE BLOODY DOOR!”
Draco felt relieved. “What about Harry, Lee? What are you hiding from me?”
“All right! But I definitely don’t want to hear the details. No way. Gee! Ginny will be so disappointed.”
‘What time is it?’ I asked.
“Nathan is just like you in every way. It’s impossible not to love him.”
“No, it’s all right, Harry. I just need to sleep.”
“What? Alive?” Draco nodded, and Harry sneered. “Yes, but barely. I’ve been using the Corona to suck his energy. Seamus was actually useful. You came after him. Things couldn’t be better. My slave has been following you for a while. You were very stupid, Draco. You fell into a childish trap. It wasn’t difficult to stun you and that stupid red-head.”
"Have you ever thought about adopting a kid, Harry?" Hermione asked gently.
Harry frowned. “Relationship?”
On Draco’s birthday, Harry decided to take him out to dinner, just the two of them. Then he would take Draco to a romantic cottage in the woods that he had bought. The place was all set for them to spend a magical and sensual night together. Harry had also bought a beautiful golden ring for Draco. He knew they had only been together a few months but he also knew he wanted to spend the rest of his life with Draco. He only hoped that Draco wanted the same thing.
He didn’t have to say twice. Brutus jumped on the bed and closed his eyes, pleased. Harry was still smiling when he fell asleep.
“I do!” Nathan answered. “I like Eerie! And I like the magical fountain, too, but I miss home.”
“Nathan… If McGonagall sends me a Howler, you’ll be grounded for the whole summer!”
Draco shot him a murderous look. “No Apparating! It’s dangerous for the baby!”
Harry didn’t have to wait for too long. In less than five minutes, Neville appeared at the door with a curious expression. He stared at father and son with amusement. He had read about Nathan on the newspapers, but he hadn’t seen him until that moment. Ana, his secretary, seemed enchanted by the child’s gaze, and now he could understand why. Indeed, the little boy looked very charismatic.
"Whatever." Harry shrugged, making Draco want to bash him in the head.
That was some news. Scorpius had never even mentioned Albus Potter. Then again, why would he have said something about it in the first place? The boy had grown up listening to his grandfather complaining about how insufferable Harry Potter was, and how much “daddy” hated him. I avoided talking about Harry in front of him. It wasn’t strange at all that Scorpius had decided not to tell us that his best friend was none other than Albus Potter.
“I... I can’t,” Harry stuttered.
It was impossible to control the hasty beating of my heart. I didn’t want to see Harry, but at the same time, I did. If he was there then it couldn’t be a good thing. I bet it had everything to do with the turn of events in Knockturn Alley. Somehow he had gotten word of it. Then again, Harry always knew everything that happened in the wizarding world. There were no exceptions. I still remembered how he knew exactly where to intercept my dragon’s cub and how amused he had been at my audacity.
"Harry, I'm warning you..." Draco muttered, knowing that the battle was already lost.
"Go to your side of the bed, Harry," Draco ordered, after all, he was still very pissed off.
“No. I… I’ll lead my own investigation.”
“We had sex,” he declared coldly. It was the Chief Auror speaking.
“You know what I mean...” There was a subtle insinuation in Nostrums’ voice.
“Now, hear me out, Weasley…” Draco said hissing.
I smirked. “Isn’t it obvious?”
Harry couldn’t believe that everyone was finally home. Draco was taking a shower, Nathan watching TV and he was checking if the wards were all activated around the house. By his side was Brutus, the most loyal of dogs, especially now that his position as the only dog in the house was at stake. Harry patted Brutus’ head and smiled. Brutus had taken very seriously his job as “patrol dog” and seemed very proud of his new position, so he kept following Harry everywhere he went.
I smiled so he knew I was ok. I was more than ok really. I was in cloud 9. What I needed was rest.
“Perhaps I should try to contact Lucius again,” Draco said thoughtfully.
“Don’t go thinking that they are nice, Potter,” I said.
“You mean... Nathan... You were...”
“Yeah, I know,” Jonas told Fred. “He was always talking to a tall, dark fellow named Casper.”
“That Horace guy seemed to like Harry. I think he’ll come back tonight. I don’t think they will have the guts to arrest Harry. I mean, he saved everyone in this goddamned community and he never complained about the task that was given to him. Those Hit Wizards should be helping him, not taking him away!”
“We have to find a member of his family that is alive,” Harry said thoughtfully. “We need to know exactly who opened the ark and for what purpose.”
“Fire.” Their foreheads touched.
"You’re right." Harry ran his hand through his hair. "I want to getaway. But you must understand something, Ron. I’m afraid that the people behind all this mess will take Nathan away from me again. I can’t allow that to happen!"
“Don’t get cocky. You’re not strong enough,” he muttered.
"Don’t get me started."
Astoria looked at me as if I was a lost cause. There was a reasonable explanation for that. My wife hated violence. She didn’t want Scorpius to get in trouble. She was of the idea that Scorpius should report whatever was wrong to McGonagall instead of doing justice with his bare hands. I agreed with her, but what she couldn’t understand was that sometimes a boy had to learn how to defend himself on his own.
“Hey!” Nostrums complained. “He didn’t kick my ass! I was almost winning that fight! If it wasn’t for...” Nostrums closed his mouth abruptly.
Harry sighed. “You know, it’s almost dawn. We should get some sleep. And you, more than ever, should get some rest! You’re pregnant now! Let’s leave Lucius and everything else for another time. Now let’s just rest and pretend that nothing is going on.”
“We haven’t seen you ever since the end of the war!” Ron said tapping Seamus’ back.
We got quiet for a while. I thought he would leave, but instead, he sat next to me. His eyes kept staring at me I could feel it. I felt my face burning. What was he seeing? The brat from the past turned into a delicate and sick man? His old enemy turned to nothing? I clutched my fists. I got mad at myself for not having the courage to turn around and face him.
"I’m confused. Weren’t we talking already?" Draco sneered.
“That’s the point, Potter. He did show up, but he’s probably weak, so he must be using someone to do his dirty work until he’s strong again.”
It should have sounded like a request, but it ended up like an order. I sat on the bed and sighed. Although I wanted to fight, the truth was that I had no strength. Harry had me whatever way he wanted to. I was his. I would do anything he asked me to at that point. Wasn’t I already risking my life for him? I was risking my father’s fury too, my mother’s disappointment, and even my son’s own contempt.
“It’s not your fault, Harry,” Ron cut him off. “And we didn’t know if it was really dangerous to stay here.”
"Harry, we’re going home," she said ignoring Ron’s angry face. "If you need us, just call!"
“What’s so bloody funny?” I asked angrily.
If Harry thought I would just let him go he was seriously mistaken. He had no right to just take away what was mine without an injunction from the Ministry. Without a care in the world, I cast a spell on the door and locked it before any of the Aurors outside could even realise what was going on.
Draco smiled, touched Harry’s forehead with his and moved his body up and down. All of a sudden, Draco stopped. Harry breathed loudly but didn’t complain. Draco was playing with him. He could play it, too.
He was sick and tired of all those people trying to lead his fate. First, it had been Dumbledore, then a legion of Professors and well-intentioned friends. Now his life was being commanded by a maniac demon and an even crazier father-in-law.
“You’ll have to break my face then, because I’m the boss. I own the place and three more others.”
He sat down again and hid his face in his hands. “I didn’t know any of this. I knew he’d been Lestrange’s lover and that he’d used that to find out about the Death Eaters’ plans, but I never really knew how deep the story went. He never told me. Why didn’t he tell me?”
“Can we really trust him?” Hermione asked doubtfully.
"You just cost me my best servant, Potter," Draco said.
“Well, he isn’t,” Lucius said, irritated. “Perhaps the kid knows. Ask him!”
A comfortable silence fell upon the room.
“Because you’re very precious and I don’t want to ruin this moment that was given to me as a blessing. I want to make this night the best night of our lives.”
“To do what?”
Harry just smirked. "Ok, Draco, our beautiful ice prince. What brings you to my humble home?"
“Of course there is, and a big one,” he said, closing his eyes. “Do you want me to leave?”
-----------------------
Harry growled.
I came to stand before him. “What exactly can’t you deal with? You can’t deal with the fact that you want me just as I want you? Is that it?” I pressed on. “Or is there more?”
food, too."
“Yes. You thought Brutus was a lover?”
“Are you tired?” Draco asked, smiling.
“All right then. I believe you. Now, tell me what’s bothering you.”
Draco and Harry argue. Draco makes a decision.
“You are so quiet I am starting to be afraid,” was the next typical Potter comment.
“No, he doesn’t. And by the look of things, no one knows you’re here, either,” Draco pointed out.
Harry looked straight into his eyes and repeated. “I love you. I’ve always loved you and I always will.”
“No, I can’t.”
Harry didn’t seem like he would listen to them, especially when Dursley told him to listen to his friends. But when he looked into Draco’s eyes, his anger faded and he place his wand inside his cloak.
“When are they going to burst into the place?” Harry asked.
Harry sighed. "We’ll see them again soon. We’re not going away forever, Nat."
“I feel responsible,” I shrugged.
Draco only nodded before pulling Harry on top of him and kissing him breathlessly. They were about to take off their clothes when someone knocked on the door. Harry sighed, frustrated. Draco didn’t look so happy about the interruption either. They talked about the possibility of not answering the door, but Harry was expecting news from the secret operation and so they stood up, rearranged their clothes and went to get the door.
I didn’t mean to postpone our conversation. I was just too afraid of what I was going to tell him.
“I know what the truth is, Mr Dursley,” Horace said in a cold tone of voice. “Unfortunately my personal judgment of the situation can’t help Harry at the moment, but the child will stay with his husband till further notice.”
“He’s your friend. Thank God he’s with you.”
Harry felt as if he was missing something, but because he didn’t want to think of his five-year-old son’s love life, he decided to shake his head and forget about it. The situation was weird enough as it was.
Ron reddened. "What was I supposed to think by hearing your conversation? Oh, it's huge, Harry. May I blow it?" Ron imitated Draco's voice. "It seemed obvious."
“But you’re pregnant.” Harry moaned.
“George is here, then?” Draco asked, his heart thumping. “What about Harry? Is he here, too?”
I looked at Scorpius and gave him a warm smile for the first time that morning. My son relaxed a little bit. I felt even guiltier for making him worry so much. What a lousy father I was.
“Isn’t it kind of obvious, Harry?” Ron pointed out. “Nostrums probably had followers of his own. You can always count on some stupid human who worships stupid things like demons… Someone must have stolen it from the Harvest family.”
"What do you think it is?" Hermione asked.
“Yes,” Harry muttered.
Draco gave his back at him. "I want you to go back to the couch."
‘Don’t do what?’
“Why don’t you find it weird?” Sirius asked, suspicious.
‘You can’t make me, Potter. I’m an adult. I’m not a fucking child!’ Although I wanted to make myself look fierce, I’m sad to say I coughed at the end of the speech and just looked feeble and pathetic.
Hermione shuddered. “An ex-lover maybe?”
His green eyes sparkled as he met mine. Did he notice my unhealthy desire for him? I shivered.
Draco caught the thing unwillingly and in reflex, and when he saw the green and gold sock in his hand he let out a yelp of disgust and tossed it in Dobby's direction. The house-elf caught the sock with teary eyes.
“No, I don’t think so. He had the keys and he looked really furtive. Something isn’t right, I can tell. My hunch is that you should listen to him, but don’t believe a word that he says. I don’t even think he’s Bob.”
"I will. Hey, why don’t you stay with Ron and Hermione? They have wards all over their house. You’d be safe there and I wouldn’t have to worry about you so much. Our house doesn’t have anything and now I wonder why. This place was supposed to have thousands of magic barrels! I’m an Auror, for Merlin’s sake!"
Draco wasn’t so sure. Nathan was very special. They didn’t know the real extent of his powers. Perhaps he could do something like that and much more. He didn’t understand Nathan’s reasons though. Draco didn’t understand anything anymore. Was Nathan the key to everything? In the few conversations Draco had had with Nostrums, he noticed how obsessed Nostrums seemed to be with Nathan. It was almost as if he feared Nathan more than he did Harry. But that wasn’t possible. Why would a demon-like Nostrums be afraid of a child?
"Oh, sorry love!" Harry pulled away. "It’s just that I’m so happy."
"What?" Harry looked at Ron in disbelief. "Why was that?"
‘I’m waiting, Malfoy.’
"Why? Well, let’s see why... First of all, you’d never told me that McGonagall had offered you a job! Second, we have never discussed it! Third, you made your decision without consulting me! What about me, Harry? Were you assuming that I would just go with you, no questions asked? Or are you planning on leaving me, is that it?"
“You know what you have to do. But you won’t do it, will you?” asked Draco with his eyes filled with expectation.
I hugged Scorpius for the last time without caring about what the others would think. All I wanted was for my son to know that he could count on me no matter what.
I could tell by his reaction he was not expecting me to say that. His eyes glinted with amusement. Making sure no one was around, he got closer. I licked my lips in anticipation.
He snorted, “And what do I know nowadays? Nothing! I have Aurors coming here once a month! I’ve lost a lot of clients because of them! And you, why don’t you ask your own kind about what’s been going on? Your father must know more than I do!”
Severus made a dramatic pause, probably because Draco looked like he was about to break.
“I don’t work here anymore.”
Harry grimaced.
“That’s all classified information!” I exclaimed in outrage. “How did you find out about it?”
I stood up this time. We became face to face, eye to eye. I was a little bit taller than him, which seems to irritate him. I felt something change between us. There was tension alright, but it wasn’t the same as it’d always been. I felt tempted to lean forward and touch my lips with his. Harry, however, seemed so strange. I was certain he would turn away. To my utter surprise, he got even closer. It seemed unintentional, like two opposite poles that could not help feeling attracted to each other.
“Oh, come one, tell me!”
“Till then, don’t say a word about this to anyone! We are still choosing the men for the task ahead.”
If Astoria had any idea about what had happened the night before between Harry and me she didn’t say. She just smiled as usual. I felt the worst of men. We didn’t love each other passionately, but that didn’t mean I could just sleep with someone else without telling her first. We were married and had a son together. Our rooms were in different wings of the castle, granted, but only because the wing I was in was warmer and Astoria would much rather have the room with the view to the lake.
Draco started to cry. He wanted to push Bob away, but he didn’t have the strength to do it. Bob was being strangely nice to him, and as Draco’s eyes met his, he noticed that this Bob didn’t have the same mad look like the other one. And it was then that Draco understood. He made a huge effort to stop crying. The pain ceased a little, and he sighed deeply.
“Why did I listen to Harry?” Sirius berated himself. “He told me that my presence wasn’t necessary at the hearing today, that nothing would go wrong... Yeah, right. Look at this mess! Lots of injured people and my grandson in a Hospital bed.”
“Then I guess she would appreciate some company, don’t you think?”
‘But there are two Aurors who also know the secret…’
“If it wasn’t, he wouldn’t have disappeared!”
‘Harry…’
"You looked scared."
“Yes, I was about to leave anyway,” Harry said. He was back to his old self. I envied his ability to quickly dismiss his embarrassment. “Malfoy,” he called my name looking straight at me. “Forget about everything.”
‘Are you going to tell me after all this time that what we had was a mistake?’ I asked quietly.
“Yes, you do. Whatever it is you think you deserve from me regarding last night, you probably do,” he conveyed, upset. “It wasn’t planned, Malfoy. It just happened. It was… unexpected and... great, but it doesn’t change anything. There are so many things happening right now, and they are so much bigger than us, that I will need time to process this… this thing… between us.”
“You sound like a jealous son, Harry,” Hermione pointed out.
"He’s being one now since he’s not looking at me," Draco stated.
“Why not? You have to, Harry. It’s safer there.”
His green eyes left mine for a minute to unfold and read the letter. I sighed. I supposed I could use a spell of my own to steal it back. It would be rather pathetic, though, if I suddenly felt down from exhaustion in front of him. I would never humiliate myself in such a way. So I let him read it even though I had no idea what was in it.
“Of course not!” I objected indignantly, though I shouldn’t have.
“How does he know?”
“Severus??? Do you call him by his first name? Since when?”
“So that’s really all you know?” he asked after a moment of silence.
“You knew he was a spy?” Fred questioned him.
“Because she didn’t want to scare you…” Harry said, careering around the corner.
Draco frowned. “You made a food list, Harry. And you arranged my entire schedule. Brutus will have to stay in the garden?” Draco looked at Brutus and the dog whined at Harry. “He won’t stay in the garden, Harry. He will stay here, with me, like always.”
I couldn’t blame him or his distrustful look.
“How is Nathan?”
Hermione wrote the address on a piece of paper and Harry shoved it inside the trousers’ pocket. He quickly went home to take a shower and then headed for the ice-cream parlour. The place was quite full. To his disappointment, he didn’t saw anyone with blonde hair and silver-blue eyes among the people that worked there.
‘Don’t tempt me.’
‘You can barely stand, Malfoy!’
But the “routine” procedure lasted a lot longer than Harry expected, and by the time Neville came to talk to him and Draco in the waiting room, Harry had almost bitten all his nails off. He cornered Neville immediately and Neville didn’t know if he should laugh or be afraid.
“Are you kidding me? Didn’t you feel something when I gave it back to you? I did.”
“I wasn’t scared!” Nathan protested, making the adults chuckle.
To hell with propriety, I just wanted to feel his cock against mine. As I touched his member under his jean, he moaned against my lips. He seemed about to explode.
‘There aren’t many Muggle things in my house, it’s true. I do admit I am a bit old-fashioned. However, I don’t despise Muggles, Potter.’ Not like before, anyway.
Draco, she noticed, seemed to be glowing and Hermione felt happy for him. After so many storms, he deserved to be happy, and so did Harry.
‘You give me no choice.’
‘You don’t really have to do anything, Malfoy. If you want to be forgiven for the past, just join the millions of social programs created after the war.’
“What are you waiting for?” Harry provoked him.
“Anyway,” Hermione began, “As Lucius is out of the picture at the moment, you’ll need a lawyer to assist you at the hearing, Harry. You should have thought about it before.”
‘Hey, would you two stop that? This talk is giving me the creeps…’ said Alfred staring at us with a strange look on his face.
“Vanished? What do you mean, they vanished?” Draco asked, his heart almost coming out of his mouth.
Nathan had a flash of himself with the age of sixteen and a boy with the age of eleven who kept walking after him, trying to make him lose his calm posture. Nathan’s friends made fun of the boy, but Nathan had ignored their attention and smiled at him. The boy looked away but smiled back, and Nathan felt his heart melting. He wondered if he was having a vision of the future.
“No, sweetie. I’m just saying–”
As time went by, Nostrums became quieter and quieter. The object of his affection didn’t seem to notice him at all. He became darker, sullen and moody, and he stopped working. One day he was expelled from the Temple. They told him he couldn’t stay anymore because he had a stain in his heart, and he had thought that the stain was love.
“Take off your mask,” he asked.
“Harry…” Draco took Harry’s hand. “They are the doctors here. Let them do their job.”
“That’s great news. Harry and I are taking Nathan home today,” Draco said cheerfully.
Knowing I was just a tool hadn’t hurt me as much in the beginning, after all, it had connected me with Harry again. It was an illusion that kept me going. It was all an illusion in fact. I was the biggest fool of all. I wondered if Harry had slept with me to keep me docile. Perhaps he was this type of man. What did I know? I didn’t know Harry Potter anymore. He may be the greatest pretender on earth.
“Then you’ll die faster,” Nostrums sneered. “But before you go, I’ll allow you to look into me, and see for yourself the things you missed, the things you couldn’t or didn’t wish to see within me.”
After a while I let Angel go. Our eyes met once more. His eyes seemed to know me inside out.
Draco pulled away slowly and the sadness and defeat that could be read in his eyes split his heart in two.
“Harry?” Draco called slowly.
“I guess.” Draco shrugged like he didn’t care, but Harry knew better.
“It’s none of your business!”
"I’m going back to work. Draco, if you need me, you know where to find me."
Draco smiled and they kissed one last time.
“You didn’t sleep well, my dear?” she asked softly.
Lucius smirked, “Please, there’s no need to flatter me.”
"No. I’m taking Nathan to his room."
“Ah!” Bob made a face. “This story gets better and better. It makes sense. Harry isn’t the evil type. I should have suspected something… Well, I’m kind of slow to get things… Ron was always joking about it. He said he didn’t know how I graduated as an Auror in the first place!” Bob winked at him.
“I don’t know. He only wants to talk to you. I don’t trust him anymore, Harry, and that was why I didn’t tell you this before. Bob isn’t the same jovial guy as he used to be. He seems so different... I can’t believe no one noticed this but me.”
“You’re a bloody liar! I saw your satisfaction when Nathan showed his powers!”
Bastard. I smiled involuntarily. As if by some miracle, Harry smiled too. It was getting harder and harder to leave the room. I wasn’t sure of what was going on between us, but there was definitely something there, and I didn’t want it to end so soon.
“Who said that?” Harry cut him off. “Of course I want this baby! He’s my son!”
But the young lad had dared to mistreat Draco when they first met, refusing to take Draco's hand when offered. Harry Potter had dared to ignore the Malfoy's prestige and reputation, and had instead mingled with the worst sort of people in the whole of Hogwarts – The Weasleys.
‘That’s the thing. He didn’t say anything, but kind of let me know he was aware of my connection with you. He knows we spoke in Matilda’s house,’ I cleared out just in case he thought I was talking about our sexual dalliance.
I bit his lower lip, then licked and sucked it to keep his taste for as long as possible. Harry sighed sweetly. To my despair, though, he pulled away.
"Bob will introduce us his new girlfriend and he invited me and Harry to have dinner with him tonight. Of course, you and Hermione are invited as well."
“Nathan won’t stay here,” Harry said.
“They can stay with me, Potter,” I said, surprising myself.
“Just go back to your husband. I bet he needs you. Tomorrow we will figure out what to do. Moony will know what to do. He always does.”
“Ah, but what an interesting choice of words, Potter. So you are torn between finding me devilishly handsome or just plain sexy,” I provoked him not knowing where I’d gotten the nerve to do it.
"I don't even want to see the parlour..."
The silence lasted longer than before. Was Harry worried?
Draco sighed, “Don’t do anything stupid, Harry.”
“Oh, so you were the one who screamed? That’s quite a nice hobby you have, Malfoy.”
‘You’ll hate me’ Draco’s voice echoed inside his head.
“Who are you?” asked Vernon with a look of suspicion.
“Harry, calm down,” Draco said, taking Harry’s hand and squeezing it. “Neville knows what he’s doing. He’s the doctor, not you.”
“Oh, I’m so sorry, Drake. It was the vodka, wasn’t it?” Harry put the tray aside.
Yes, he would. It didn’t matter what they had lived together the night before. It had been just one night. Just a magical night that should be pulled out of his memory for good.
Nathan lay down on his small bed inside the cupboard and closed his eyes with a sigh. One more miserable day had passed and nothing extraordinary had happened. The Dursleys were the most boring family in the world. They didn’t allow him to do anything, not even play with Dudley’s son, Peter Dursley, who was only a year younger than he was. Peter looked like he wanted to play with Nathan, but Vernon Dursley had never allowed them to play together. Nathan didn’t think there was a child in the whole world that was as miserable and unhappy as he was.
‘Conservative and prejudiced then,’ he went on.
“Seamus,” Draco informed calmly.
"That's because for them you will always be known as a Death Eater," Ron pointed out.
“Why is Nathan with you?”
“That’s not the issue here. I just don’t want to think of my son dating yet. He’s only five, Drake. He still sucks his thumb, for Merlin’s sake.”
“Oh, no. You’re now under my mercy.” Harry tried to look serious but failed.
Harry lay his head on Draco’s lap and let his husband caress his hair. “I need to get out,” he said with determination.
Harry cut Draco off before he could go any further. "Let's just open the damn thing, ok?"
“It was necessary. We didn’t know who we were dealing with. We still don’t, as a matter of fact.”
Nathan shook his head.
It was the first time that Harry ran away from a discussion and Draco didn’t like that. Harry took Nathan in his arms and climbed the stairs to the second floor. Brutus tried to go after him but Draco forbade him.
“I hope so,” Dean said shakily. “I’ll go with you, Hermione.”
‘I will.’
He crossed his arms, looking as angrily as I was.
More grumbling and swearing. “Dolohov, Carrow, Avery, Rowle... The usual lot.”
Draco stopped at the door of his room completely dazzled by the image of Harry Potter lying naked on his bed. He still had to pinch himself every now and then to convince his heart that Harry was actually there. When he saw Harry at his door, he thought the raven-haired man would beat the shit out of him. But instead, Harry had kissed him. He wanted Draco as much as Draco wanted him. The question was: for how long? Draco had been in love with him ever since he could remember. Could he cope with the fact that he could only have Harry’s body but not his heart? Could he face without falling apart the day Harry decided to walk out of his life because the desire he felt for Draco faded away?
We didn’t speak for a while. He didn’t look upset or edgy and neither did I. The silence we shared was the kind I liked to share with Astoria. It wasn’t bad at all. Just being together was enough. Angel seemed to understand. Having him near me made me feel calm.
He was right. If I had been arrested, I wouldn’t have survived a day in Azkaban. He knew that. My lawyers had managed a fair agreement with the Ministry of Justice Department to make sure I was kept out of prison.
“Yes, he did. Is it so hard to imagine him trusting me?”
And Lucius Malfoy was nowhere to be found.
Harry sighed, deciding not to discuss the matter with him. He didn’t want to make Draco even more upset.
“Don’t make excuses for him, Draco.”
“You know how my father is… Old habits die hard. But Saulus isn’t a bad guy. I mean, he does support the corruption scheme behind the Ministry, but he’s doing a good job as the Minister for Magic.”
Draco clenched his fist in Dean’s face. “Why, you!”
Many emotions filled him all at once. He felt suddenly exhilarated but at the same time very scared.
“What family thing?”
“Yes, but mostly, your child is a Malfoy and a Potter. Your child is a Malfoy’s heir. Are you following me?”
“I don’t know, Harry. But by the look of things, your son is quite special. He can see things we can’t, and he can capture other people’s feelings.”
‘Really? So I shouldn’t worry about my father getting in touch all of a sudden and speaking in codes?’
Harry didn’t know what to think, except that Horace had been right in his assumption. Colin looked like he was in pain, and Harry had a hard time trying to understand why Colin had been acting as if he was Bob. Colin was annoying, but sweet nonetheless. He’d never done anything to hurt him in any way. On the contrary, Colin had always treated Harry as if he was a god.
“Why?”
“Hey, Harry!”
“I know who you are,” Draco said.
“I can’t wait to meet him!” Sirius said.
I heard a scream of delight that made my eardrums hurt. Then the door was opened and a beautiful tall brunet threw herself in Harry’s arms. I was left speechless. I would have hexed her if I could. My blood boiled with rage and jealousy. Who did that woman think she was? My hand went straight to my wand.
Draco made a face. “Tell that to Hermione and let’s see what happens.”
“Why?”
“You don’t work here anymore, Mr Potter,” Elisabeth reminded him not so kindly.
As they entered Gringotts, some of the small creatures with swarthy faces, pointed beards and long hands stared at Draco with suspicion. They probably knew about his past and they were wondering what he was doing there with the great Harry Potter by his side. Draco smirked. It had been a while since he'd been to the wizard's bank. He had an account there but he didn't use it. He didn't feel the need to use their money – wizard money – since he had been living as a Muggle.
How could Harry ask Nathan without disturbing him? Nathan was too young to be caught in that situation. Still, Nathan could be the only one able to help them find Draco. Harry didn’t have to ask, though, for Nathan answered straight away that he didn’t know where Draco was.
“Yes, but he’s sleeping in a new house for the first time.”
“Hey! I was hurt, all right? In fact, I still am! Just because I never said out loud that I loved him, it doesn’t excuse his treachery! Of course I love him! How can he doubt that?”
Harry found him at the yard, stroking a very depressed Brutus. If only Brutus could talk...
Draco frowned. “Were you planning on using these devices on Jonas?”
“Well, this isn’t one, so I guess I'm not breaking any rules of good manners, eh?” his smile was as cynical as mine. “I think you know why I’m here.”
"Yes, of course I will."
I lay down after taking a sleeping potion. I wanted a dreamless sleep. Luckily, that is exactly what happened.
"And I need to discover more about the Minister of Magic."
Another point had to be clarified.
“That I want you,” Harry said, leaning forward to kiss Draco.
I bet he was. Harry had probably struggled not to laugh. The spoiled-brat Malfoy was a weak adult who could barely make use of magic without collapsing. It was humiliating.
“What has started again?” I asked. I was confused and irritated. “Why don’t you stop talking in riddles and just say what you really think, Potter?”
“Don’t come near me, Harry. Nostrums controls me. I’m just a pawn.”
“They didn’t let Granger in, did they?”
They kissed leisurely and only had to break it off when Nathan entered the room with Neville.
“Well, Nathan was an angel at her age!”
If he insisted on the matter, as flattering as it was, I would hex him. I didn’t want to delve into the subject any longer.
“You’re a bastard, Potter. You lied to me. You said what we had together wasn’t just about sex, but you lied. The bloody Harry Potter, always thinking he’s better than everybody else. You know what? I’m way too good for you. I deserve someone better. Someone that loves me back.”
The room looked as if it had suddenly been invaded by Dementors.
"Just go! And come back when you’re done!"
“But, sir, this is such a miracle!”
“Oh, I don’t know. I guess it was just female intuition,” she shrugged.
“We also agreed to be careful in our assumptions,” Horace said, seriously.
“Things like betrayal and murder.”
Harry noticed that the silver-blue eyes were glittering suspiciously as if the blond man was crying.
After the shower, feeling quite relaxed, Harry found Draco in the kitchen stroking Brutus’ ears and talking to him softly. At the table, there was a big meat sandwich and a glass of orange juice. Harry took a seat and devoured the meal in less than fifteen minutes.
“There will be another time.”
I made a face.
"I’m dying, Harry," Draco muttered.
Draco’s eyelids moved slightly. “Harry?”
----------------
“Sorry to bother you, Harry,” Bob excused himself.
“I’m losing my patience, Malfoy,” he gently warned me. I could see the fierceness in his eyes, though.
They stared at each other and Draco gave up.
It was then that Brutus appeared, covered in mud. Draco sighed. Brutus had been digging in the yard again. He saw Brutus stop and stare at Nathan, who stared back at the dog. After an initial inspection, Brutus started to walk in the direction of Nathan, but Draco held him by his collar.
“Don’t move. Otherwise I’ll stop.”
"He asked me if he could blow a balloon, Ron. You see, I bought this painting and there's a kid playing in a yard with balloons and stuff. It's a wizarding painting so the kid talks and moves around. One of his balloons wilted."
“How the bloody hell should I know? Just call Dr Jules! Do I have to do everything?”
There was a brief moment of silence. Harry turned to Louis and told him something that made the man leave the room. Alfred freaked out when he saw the Auror walking away.
“What did you do?” Draco asked, curious.
"All right," Harry said. "Jump in."
“Oh, my God! You are not in labour, are you?” Harry seemed terrified.
The line was cut off abruptly. It made me angrier than I thought possible. I knew my face was red when I threw the phone back to Grey.
‘And apart from Candelaria, not one knows you’re here,’ Harry said. ‘Good thing you coloured your hair. By the way, I like it, but I still prefer you blond,’ he muttered close to my ear.
All was lost. What would happen from now on was a complete mystery.
“You’re such a Drama–”
“What’s so bloody complicated?” Harry’s anger was rising fast.
“What about you? Are you going to remember this meeting?”
A shadow overcame Harry’s face for a moment, and then it was gone.
He glanced at his son behind him, whose eyes looked suddenly very mature and old.
‘And can you really take me with you on such a long trip? I mean, can you really do that? I don’t want to disintegrate along the way…’
“He was arrested but was set loose a year later for good behaviour. He’s on probation, though.”
“Shut up, Brutus! I’m trying to call Draco!” Harry complained, but Brutus didn’t stop barking. “Oh, no.” Harry got up quickly and took his wand. “He’s not here, is he? The stupid little... What the hell did he do?” Harry saw the empty glass of milk at the bedside table and frowned. “Could it be that he had the courage to drug me? The bastard! How could he? I knew it. I knew he was too soft today. Something wasn’t right.” He looked at Brutus, upset. “And you, dog! Why didn’t you do something to stop him?”
“I told you I can do that, Draco. You don’t have to.”
Almost right away, a little girl in a blue dress – that matched the exact colour of her eyes – appeared at the bottom of the stairs. She had the most innocent expression on her face. Her long silver-blonde hair was all messy as if she had been playing in the wind. At her back, her little hands were poorly concealing Harry’s wand.
Draco smiled triumphantly and announced, "I came to steal you away. That way, when the morning comes and people realise you're missing, their Christmas will be ruined."
“They’ll be safer in the Institution, Malfoy.”
At least I wasn’t so obsessed anymore. There were days and days. Like that day on Platform Nine ¾. That day had been a really bad one. Not only did I have to deal with Harry’s presence, but also Scorpius’ departure. When I arrived at the Mansion I was a nervous wreck. Astoria almost sent for our Healer. Eventually, though, I got better and felt proud of myself for my strong will.
“Well, yes. I don’t deny that,” Lucius said, smirking.
“I don’t know, Harry... I–”
“And not only that but ever since he got the job he’s been trying to get Harry in trouble.”
“Why not?”
"Hey, I’m not a kid. I don’t need supervision. I can pretty much take care of myself!"
“Yes, but what does that mean exactly?” Harry replied. “You said he abandoned Voldemort in the end because he had other plans. One of his plans was Nathan! Can’t you see? He’s as bad as Voldemort! Maybe he plans to kidnap my son!”
"So?" he asked, curious.
As a thought occurred to me suddenly, I went to find the Auror named Grey. I found him outside the Manor, at the back, and I asked him to get in touch with Harry right away.
My eyes went wide and my heart started beating like mad.
It was then that he realised Nathan had already said the word baby to him on two different occasions. One was just after the attack and the other in the hospital bed. Nathan knew even before he did that he was pregnant. Draco wondered how he hadn’t paid attention to it before. Then again, he would have never guessed that he was pregnant if Lucius hadn’t told him in person.
“I guess you could help us in the investigation,” Harry suggested, discarding his suspicions about him.
That line right there was not enough to appease me, but it was definitely enough to make me look forward to what was to come between us. Harry Potter had just flirted with me. That was a good sign, wasn’t it?
“It’s Nostrums!” Lucius corrected him angrily.
"I don’t know, Draco."
A beautiful and sad song echoed around the room. Harry could only see the stranger and no one else. The world around them seemed to disappear.
“May I ask how the hell you can just stop?” he asked, amused, the sweat covering his body.
Another explosion was heard and a curse hit Harry. Draco yelled and tried to get to where Harry was lying, but someone caught his arms.
He parked the car near the cemetery and walked through the graves until he spotted the one he was looking for. He sat in front of it and just stayed there until the nightfall. He had lied to Draco. He had a secret. He had many secrets in fact. One of them was the fact that Draco was the love of his life long before their sixth year. The other was that he had almost given up on his fight against Voldemort, and the reason was right in front of him.
"I’m happy, too." Draco kissed him again. "More than happy, actually."
“Ok.” He looked at Ginny and Fred. “Could you tell Harry that I took Nathan home?”
“According to Draco, no. But we’re talking about Lucius Malfoy. The guy is a natural-born liar! Draco seems to trust him, God only knows why. I don’t trust Lucius. If his intentions were good, he would help me at the Justice Department. He would stand up to testify on my behalf. But of course, he won’t. He’s hidden under Saulus’ wings like a bloody chicken.”
"You’ll have your answers by tomorrow, Draco. Do you want to stay here?" Saulus asked.
“What kind of answer is that?”
Draco’s smile died in his lips the moment he saw Harry’s serious face.
“Oh, Harry, I don’t know if I should tell you since he didn’t want you to know. I met him last week in an ice-cream parlour.  I was completely shocked when I saw him. I mean, I knew he’d spied for our side when the war exploded but at the time he was still the same spoiled brat as ever. But now he is so different. He told me about his feelings for you when I was Voldemort’s prisoner but I told him to back off if he wasn’t serious. He helped me escape. We became kind of… friends since then. He never tried anything with you because of the war; after all it was dangerous times. He left the wizarding world to live a simple life. He abandoned everything. I had lost contact with him for a year when I saw him by chance. We talked; he said he still loved you and then I tried to be the cupid. Obviously, it wasn’t one of my most brilliant ideas…”
I had forgotten about her for a second. I opened my eyes and nodded.
I wanted Harry back, even if for a few seconds. I needed him like I needed oxygen, if not more, for without Harry around it hurt to breathe.
Harry nodded. “He’s one of the missing people.”
“I have a question,” Harry said suddenly. “What happened to Fudge?”
“See? He needs me here,” Harry said, kissing Nathan’s hands. “I’m here, sweetie. I’m not going anywhere without you.”
Harry felt Nathan’s hand tugging at him and he knelt to listen to him.
“It’s all right, sweetie,” Draco said. “Just go to bed now, ok? Your father is just worried.”
“His name’s Angel. And could you please release me?”
I frowned.
Draco gave him a mysterious smile. Harry felt the excitement running all over his body.
“Of course not! You know how much I love you, don’t you?”
Luckily, Harry kept quiet. He just stared at me for a long time as if trying to know what was going through my head. He looked at me as if he had never seen me before; as if I was a puzzle to be solved. The Great Harry Potter was perplexed and I was the cause of it. I felt as though I had accomplished something very important.
"I know one, too. My cabin. I’m thinking about staying there for a while."
“Well, that’s my girl.” Ron smiled.
----------------------
“Harry?” he called.
“You won’t be imprisoned. Don’t you remember what happens?”
“He’s fine. It was just a scratch,” said Lucius, gripping Draco’s arms.
“He said something about me, right? I know he did,” Draco stated angrily.
Draco's mouth opened with surprise, and Harry took that opportunity to lean forward and capture those delicious pink lips on his. Draco protested at first and tried to break free from Harry's grip. But as the kiss went on, a pleasant tingle ran down his spine and made him all mushy inside.
"The makeup sex," he said, grinning, before sucking Draco again.
“Do you like the piano?”
Draco shook his head and smiled bitterly. “Those men could tell us what the hell happened to Nathan. It’s so damn convenient for you that they are all dead now, and there’s no one that can really tell us what they did to Cho Chang and Nathan.”
“I think this is between Draco and me,” Harry pointed out coldly.
I was starting to believe in my therapist, that is to say, that my condition had everything to do with my past. I had only collapsed after those unpleasant memories had washed over me. Harry was a big part of the problem, but not the only one. I was a haunted man.
“I don’t think this is neither the time nor the place to have this discussion,” Hermione pointed out.
She sighed but agreed. Seamus volunteered to help because he knew a few Death Eaters tricks and The Weasleys twin seemed very interested by that. As they headed to the front door, they traded tips about attacks and defences.
‘Don’t be so melodramatic!’
Harry smiled, biting his lower lip in anticipation.
“I hope you know what you’re doing, Draco!”
Harry noticed they were the same size and that the mysterious person was a man. He never felt attraction for another man before, except for one time - but he hated to think about it.
"You mean health food?"
“Matilda Junian. What’s she up to?” I asked.
Later on, when Nathan was sleeping in a bed that had belonged to Bill, Percy and then Ron when they had been kids, and leaving Brutus with Nathan, Harry went after Draco and found him at the attic immersed in a sea of papers. Draco was reading a very old parchment and Harry wondered what that was all about.
“Honestly, Harry, are you sure you saw Draco kissing another guy?”
There was despair in his voice. I smiled feebly and shrugged as if that did not affect me.
"I told you your deodorant sucks!" said the guy with the brown hat to the short one.
Some of the Hit Wizards giggled at their intimacy. Draco glared at them with hate.
“This is a Mage guide. I think you should read it,” he explained it. “By the look of things, I would say that Nathan is not a warrior but rather what they call a Shaman. You can tell by looking at him. He soothes people’s heart. That’s a great gift.”
He was afraid of using magic without his wand, so he just sat on the bed, desolate. Tears ran freely down his cheeks, but he quickly wiped them away. He wouldn’t cry. He had to be strong and find a way to escape so he could warn Harry about what was going on.
“What I had to! Angel was only two! It’s been difficult, but we’ve managed. We found others like us!”
"No, I don’t think so. If that was true, then your father helped to plot against Voldemort and as far I know, Lucius was one of the biggest supporters of the Dark Lord."
Remus looked at him embarrassed. “That’s your godfather’s... assumption. I don’t know where he got this idea that Severus and I are together!”
“THE BASTARD! I can’t believe he took part in such a hideous plan!” Harry stormed. “Oh my God, Draco. Is there something wrong with Nathan? Did he suffer from side effects or–”
Draco grumbled something and Harry simply smiled.
“Harry… Harry…”
"No. You and Nathan will go to the cabin. I’ll stay here," Harry said resolutely.
“Malfoy, are you okay? Were the drugs too strong?”
Harry suddenly noticed the bags under Draco’s eyes and how tired he looked.
“Yes.”
“Boo-hoo! How touching!” Nostrums snarled. “If you don’t mind, undo the spell you cast on me so I can puke!”
“Fuck you.” Draco stood up to leave and Harry held him in his arms. “Let me go.”
“Can’t sleep?” Harry asked. Nathan shook his head, laying his head on Harry’s shoulder. “What do you want me to do?”
“Honestly, Harry, it was a dumb thing to say. They took ages to do so!” Ron exclaimed.
The noise was so loud I was surprised nobody appeared at once. I thought the Aurors’ Squad patrolled the Alley. I didn’t have time to make any more conjectures. I didn’t have time to wait for the arrival of the good guys. Maybe, if I were smart, I would just deliver them the boys and go straight home. Unfortunately, I was done with that kind of bad boy life for good. Before an Unforgivable curse could hit us, I quickly pulled the other boy to my side and as I held him and his brother I ran. As soon as I saw myself in an area free from anti-apparation spells apparated to the Manor with both clutched to me. I did my best not to waver and kill us all in the process. The last thing I noticed was Goyle and Travers swearing out loud and the little one hanging on to me for his dear life.
“Harry, don’t you dare!” Draco called him back to reality, pinching him painfully.
“Do you think it’s going to be a boy or a girl?”
Harry stared at him sadly. Louis seemed about to strangle the boy.
Draco smiled softly. “The old me would certainly want to commit suicide.”
Harry stared at him with disgust. “You’re such a filthy snake!”
“I did what I had to, Harry. I went after Saulus, yes. I needed to know the truth. After all, he could have been my father. Lucius was a shitty father but he was my father. And I needed to know the truth about Nathan as well.”
“Why?”
Harry squeezed Draco’s hand looking for support and Draco kissed him on the forehead.
“I wish you had told me that sooner.” Harry sighed tiredly.
Lucius shrugged. “Too bad for you, then.”
‘Shut up!’
‘I’m fine, Potter. Let’s keep going.’ I opened my eyes and pretend to believe what I'd just said.
"Do you still want to steal me?" Harry asked as his nose touched Draco's tenderly.
There was a period of uncomfortable silence. Why had I brought Snape up?
Seamus’ eyes shone brightly at the sight of Dean. He reached out his hand to touch Dean’s face.
The next week passed by really slowly for Draco and Harry.
“Is this a joke?” I asked. House arrest? I didn’t even leave my house! “Oh, I get it. You’re doing this so I won’t follow you when you go after the Book of the Dead.  Good luck with that, Potter.”
“Harry... Harry...,” I sobbed over and over.
"If you say so... How’s your sex life with Harry?"
‘What truth?’ he seemed to challenge me.
“If you look on the bright side, you weren’t arrested as you should’ve been.”
"He wanted cocoa."
Lucius hung up before Harry could say anything else. Harry didn’t have a choice but to take the limo and meet Lucius. He tried to make the driver talk, but the weird man didn’t say a word. They arrived at Saulus’ Mansion half an hour later, and as soon as Harry got out of the car, he pulled out his wand and pointed at Lucius, who was waiting for him at the doorway. There he was, face to face with the father of his husband, a man that everyone thought was the next Dark Lord. Harry couldn’t care less. All he wanted was his son.
Harry messed his hair even more with his hands. I wish I were brave enough to close the distance between us and kiss him.
Harry smiled slyly. “Of course, not.”
“Daddy?”
Horace had been helping Harry and Ron a lot, feeding them information about how things were going. Horace believed in Harry’s innocence, so he didn’t see the point in hiding important things from Harry, who was one of the best Aurors he’d ever seen in action.
“Yeah, yeah. You know, sometimes I think you care more about your dog than about me.”
A hand touched his shoulder slightly and he glared at Harry over his shoulder.
Satisfied that his husband was on his way home, Harry was about to go upstairs to take a shower when he was interrupted by the ringing doorbell. Since it couldn’t be Draco, and the wards hadn’t pointed out anything unusual, he opened it while surreptitiously hiding his wand in his pocket. To his surprise, it was Bob.
“Well, you’d better start eating or I won’t take you to Egypt.”
It was hard to understand what was going on. Harry was very confused about everything. Colin was dead; he was talking to someone who looked exactly like himself and on top of it all Nathan had shown up out of nowhere. He was still trying to make sense of the world. His friends and colleagues from the Ministry were very close to him and yet he couldn’t reach them. A battle between the Aurors and Nostrums’ servants was taking place a few steps away from him, but it was as if he, Nathan and Nostrums were invisible.
Lucius rolled his eyes. “We started following her after she went out with you.”
"What’s wrong sweetie? What happened?" Draco whispered.
“I like that. A prey that struggles for life is always much more fun to play with,” Harry sneered. “I think humans are very interesting. They’re so contradictory. You, for example, used to hate Harry Potter, but then your feelings for him changed and now you love him. The same goes for him. Why is that? How can such hate become such passionate love?”
Draco frowned. “How did you know I would ask you that?”
I sneered even though my heart was beating like crazy. “Is it just me or have you been paying attention to my beautiful self?”
Draco got out of Harry’s lap and faced him fuming. “I don’t need your permission, Harry. If I wanted to go you wouldn’t be able to stop me. I have my connections with the Unspeakables as well. This is my family, too, and in case you don’t remember, I was a Death Eater, so I guess I know a little more about them than you do! I’m not taking part in this bloody mission because of personal reasons, but you wouldn’t be able to stop me if I wanted to go! I just thought you ought to know that.”
I felt exhausted, so I leaned against a wall for a moment. What happened next was completely unexpected. A boy came running out of nowhere and grabbed my robe. He looked about five years old. He was very small, with chestnut hair and big green eyes. His face was shaped like a heart, and he was all dirty. My disgust was as strong as my fatherly instinct. His dirty little hands made me nauseated, but his green eyes stopped me from getting away. His eyes looked so much like Harry’s...
‘Time for you to go back home,’ he replied harshly. ‘I’ve already had a chat with your wife. You have a flight to catch tomorrow.’
Draco looked up. “I know you don’t want this baby but–”
“Horace,” Harry saluted the man in front of him with a smirk, “Any problems?”
Harry looked at Draco, then at Seamus and then at Draco again. He was aghast at the whole thing.
They waited for Nathan to draw the name he was seeing at the bottom of the page eagerly. It took a while, but when Nathan was finally done, he looked at the adults with a victorious smile on his face. Harry and Draco smiled back at him.
All of the adults started to call for the little one, and search for him everywhere, but Nathan seemed to be nowhere. They divided themselves into three search groups but Draco, knowing that Nathan wanted to stay near Harry, went to the street alone. Indeed, he found Nathan in the middle of the turmoil with the thumb in his mouth but not at all scared.
“Go slow. I never did this before,” Harry said, his heart beating like crazy.
"What are you laughing at?" Draco asked with a snarl.
‘Potter,’ I called out feebly. How awful it was to feel so weak in front of him.
“That’s not true,” Harry protested.
“I’m quite fit, Malfoy! I have to be! It’s part of my job!”
"There’s more in life than just sex, Seamus."
Nostrums clapped his hands. “Congratulations! You finally understand!”
“Too old? He’s five!”
I gave them plenty of time to think about things. Angel’s decision was immediate and rather sweet. He put his arms around Astoria and hugged her as tightly as he could. My wife almost cried her heart out.
He also nodded, and cute dimples adorned his face when he smiled again.
“Of course you didn’t know,” Nostrums pointed out coldly. “How could you? You’re such a hypocrite. You accuse me of being afraid of love, but you, as a Mage, can’t fall in love. You’re forbidden to feel such a powerful emotion for someone. It would be distracting and dangerous... So you don’t really know what love feels like.”
“I’m fine,” I repeated, getting up quickly and almost knocking Harry down in the process. I felt like running away, but I was not well at all. Harry caught me in his arms again when I stumbled.
I arrived at St Pancras on October 31st trying not to think of what the date represented. Muggles thought the date was just a great excuse for a party – and it was. But there were some superstitions that were real and not at all fun. Nonetheless, I decided to risk it. I had a small suitcase in one hand with the absolutely necessary. I had put on an Armani suit with a heavy coat where I was keeping my wand safe. My second wand was in the suitcase in case of an emergency. Making use of them in my current state would be absolute madness, but what was a wizard without his wand. I glanced at my reflection on a window shop. I looked Muggle enough, I thought. I had even dyed my hair black in case I was being followed. I looked rich and sophisticated. I sneered.
“He’s taking a shower. He was so dirty, Draco! I fear to think of what these boys must have gone through till now...” she shivered. “He’s so cute. But he’s frightened, and I should go to where he is. I left him with Lara.”
“We have an agreement with the French government. You see, Malfoy, we’ve always been watching Lucius Malfoy. Do you think we’d just let him move out of the UK without doing anything? Your father knows that if he steps out of line he will go back to Azkaban, and this time he won’t have the right to an appeal.”
Ron extended his hand through the enchanted bars of the cell and held Harry’s hand.
It was a statement, not a real question. Even so, I decided to answer, “Not exactly. I know Astoria cares, and maybe another half a dozen. But I don’t think they called you here because they’re actually interested in your cause as noble as it is. Remember that these wizards and witches are anything but noble...”
"What are you talking about?"
Hermione came into the living room a few minutes later with John. The Weasley’s older son was quite different from his little brother and sister. Although he had red hair, he was a lot more like Hermione. He was as smart as she was and since he already knew how to read, he was always found with a children’s book in his hands.
Draco didn't reply, even though he felt his anger stick in his throat. He didn't want to ruin the night for Harry. But from that moment on, Draco had a hard time hiding his desire to break Bob's neck and Harry noticed it. It was obvious that Draco didn't like Bob at all and as Bob kept up the façade of the nice guy, Draco felt even more irritated than he already was.
“It’s hard, Draco.”
This time even Sirius was taken by surprise when Remus Lupin appeared in front of him.
“Don’t think you can get away with everything just because of your pretty face. There are certain rules you need to follow, Nat. I’m not mad but I bet that Harry and everybody else are worried about you. Do you want them worried? Do you want to get yourself in trouble?”
“This is so bloody unfair. I’m not in the mood, Harry,” he whispered.
I was mortified at my slip of the tongue. Luckily, Alfred didn’t point that out. I needed to be more careful or everybody would know I had feelings for Harry Potter.
‘In your dreams, Potter. But just so you know,’ I stopped as I suddenly realised Grey was still next to me and looked very interested in what I was saying.
“NO! It’s not what I want,” Harry cut him off. “Please, try to understand…”
‘You’d better get well,’ he muttered.
“I think he’s dead because he’s not arrested, that much I know. His name is Joe Partride. He was a Death Eater, but not a very important one. He stayed with my mother until Angel was born. Then, when Angel was 2, he scampered.”
“Ha-ha, Potter,” I replied in such a throaty voice I wondered if I was the one speaking at all.
"Definitely. Do you want to touch it?" Harry invited.
“Aren’t you going to say something about your saint father?”
“No buts.” Harry turned his attention to Nathan and asked the previous question again, “Do you want to come with me, Nathan?”
“I haven’t. But he’s sent a letter. He’s doing quite well in Hogwarts,” she smiled.
Draco wondered if the good friend was Remus Lupin.
“What about the boys?”
I grimaced.
"He’ll have to understand. I can’t lose my son. I won’t lose him again!"
“He didn’t rape me, if that’s what you’re afraid of,” Draco answered.
“They were mortal enemies in a previous life, then.” Draco also seemed lost in his thoughts. “Nostrums came back just to get even with Nathan for locking him away all those years ago. Do you think… do you think they were like us?”
“What is it?”
“Or perhaps he was just sparing you so you wouldn’t suffer,” Hermione said quietly.
Harry stared at his best friend’s serious expression as he talked to a calm Neville. Ginny was the one who looked rather embarrassed with the situation, and Hermione was trying her best to drag Ron away from there.
“Now listen, Draco! Listen because I’m tired of this discussion. I have better things to do!”
“Yeah! Are you a friend of his? He doesn’t talk about his private life much.”
“Husband? You’re a puff!?” He looked at Harry with aversion and then turned to talk to Horace, “How can you allow the kid to stay with them? Unless you’re one of their kind! I want you all out of my property! NOW! And the kid stays!”
“I’m going to take a shower. Care to join me?” Harry asked seductively when he noticed the way Draco was gazing at him with lust.
“Do you want to pretend nothing happened?” he insisted.
I fiddle with the bag of money making the coins clink. Burke wetted his dry lips with his tongue. I recoiled.
--------------
“Oh, right. I guess I was a little harsh with him. I was jealous, I confess. I didn’t think he was the right guy for you. I mean, he was a Death Eater and a Malfoy. All my life I was taught that the Malfoys were just a bunch of evil and corrupt bastards. I was led by my old prejudices and I’m sorry. I still don’t trust him, if I may say so. But maybe he’s a nice guy.”
In daylight, it was easier not to be afraid, but in the dark everything seemed scarier.
The surroundings were suddenly very quiet. Nathan seemed to be deep in thought; Harry was becoming more and more confused; and Nostrums just kept smiling bitterly, as if just suddenly realising something.
"What is it, Drake?" Harry whispered in Draco’s ear, stroking his face softly.
He really was pissed off. Was he really concerned about my welfare, or he was simply angry because he had to carry me to my room? Come to think of it, the almighty Potter could have just cast a spell instead of carrying me in his arms like a medieval knight.
He made a face.
He didn’t know what he should do. Before, when he’d found out about Seamus’ kidnapping, things looked a lot clearer. He wanted to be with Seamus. He loved him so much. He had had a glimpse of what his world without Seamus would be.
“Yes,” Harry whispered back.
“Yes.” Nathan smiled.
“I know, but I can’t tell them what I know, Harry. I’m not sure anyway. I just thought I should tell you so you would come with me to investigate.”
“Excuse me,” he said for a waitress who was passing by. “May I ask you if a blond, tall guy with a very peculiar eye colour - a mix of blue and grey - works here?”
I stopped talking as I literally was at a loss for words when my eyes got lost in his.
“Ok. This conversation is getting a little weird...,” Harry muttered.
“I don’t know what you know.”
They stayed quiet for a while, kissing each other every now and then.
She flushed. “Ask Harry to explain it to you. It’s embarrassing for me to talk about it.”
“I was a shitty father. I don’t deny that. I just want Draco to be happy.”
“How could you know I had a son even before I did?” Harry asked.
“The little freak knows I did...” Nostrums muttered bitterly.
“Just… Go to hell.”
“Lubricant.”
“He looks less like a ghost now,” said Alfred with his usual charms.
He sighed and was about to waken Harry when he saw Nathan with the corner of his eyes. He looked at the little child, who was sucking his thumb ferociously and realised that Nathan’s eyes were shining with tears. Draco quickly took him in his arms and held him tightly.
‘You are avoiding me,’ I muttered.
I clutched my fists.
Hermione took a deep breath to calm down. “I’m just saying that-”
“Get the hell out, Malfoy. I don’t want to see you ever again!”
Draco crossed his arms, vexed. “Dr Jules also said I can work as long as I don’t overdo it. He didn’t tell me to vegetate in my bed! He told me that a few exercises will actually be helpful.”
“I thought Draco had left us alone,” Dean scowled. “He really is a pain in the arse!”
"But you need protection of some kind! The magical barriers take a few weeks to be done so they’re out of the question for now. And face it, Draco; you haven’t used your wand properly in a long time. You need a bodyguard then!"
“Why are you crying, Gin?” Nat asked, his face becoming sad.
"They’ve fired you??" Ron asked a very upset Harry.
Harry almost laughed at Draco’s determination.
“Don’t start, Hermione!”
Draco didn’t even know where to begin with. There were so many issues stuck on his throat and all of them wanted to get out at once.
“He didn’t send me, Draco.”
‘What?’ I asked.
‘Do you think I’m going to die?’
With his heart constricted, he and Hermione watched Harry and Ron apparating with the Hit Wizards. Bob vanished from their sight.
My other concern was Harry in the other room. It wasn’t much as a concern as it was a torment. I glued my ear to the wall without even realising it. I thought I heard something, a kind of a soft moan. Or perhaps my imagination was just running too wild.
“Who’s your slave? Bob?”
Hmm... I have no idea how to write battles, so the battle in this chapter will be very, very weird. I won’t waste my time with long battle scenes because of my poor vocabulary. Hey, it’s hard to write in English! ^_^ I will also mix religious’ beliefs, but this is fiction! If anyone feels offended or insulted in any way, it was never my intention, and I apologise in advance. That said, enjoy the story!
“It’s almost impossible,” Harry was brutally honest.
"What does that mean, Draco? That Saulus Fimcyl was your father’s friend?"
By my side, Harry grinned.
“No. I like torturing you.” Draco gave him a look. “I like to have this power over you.”
“Oh, yeah. And I suppose Santa Claus exists!” Harry grimaced. “Why are you still so willing to trust his word? Hasn’t he done enough to convince you what a prick he is?”
“Are you alright, Angel?” I asked softly to make him feel more at ease.
“Should we arrest him, Mr Potter?” asked the pudgy one.
THE END
Harry went totally red, which made him incredibly adorable. He mumbled something I couldn’t get and left the room as if he was being chased away by demons. I was intrigued.
Harry nodded, smiling slightly. "It was almost midnight and I was going to send a letter to Sirius when I saw you in the hallways. You looked suspicious – well, you always looked suspicious – so I decided to follow you and see for myself what you were up to. My heart almost came out of my mouth when you stopped at the Slytherin dressing room of the Quidditch pitch and you started to take off your clothes. I felt like a voyeur, but somehow I couldn’t look away. You hypnotized me. Then, of course, I had to spoil everything by stumbling on something. You saw me; we fought, as usual, and then Filch appeared out of nowhere. You pushed me into the broom’s closet and we spent the entire night locked up in there because Filch’s cat wouldn’t leave the door."
“I know a lot of people that would love to do that.”
Two things made me relax when my anxiety attacked me and I felt like I was stuck inside myself, desperate to simply be free, and that would be walking around my property with my dogs or play the piano.
Harry came closer and I could see his eyes were stormy and the pupils dilated. The green of his eyes was incredibly dark. My lips parted slightly. What was I expecting exactly? I should run, go far away. But I just stood there, waiting…
She raised an eyebrow. “I know that. But a little caution never hurt anyone. Besides, Harry will be–”
Nothing was said. I wanted to verbalise whatever I was feeling but it was impossible. My vocal cords were paralysed. My uneven breath mixed with his. Emerald eyes glanced at my mouth for a second and then at my eyes.
Harry sighed. “All right.”
“I’m not sure you’ve realised it, but you’ve just called him Harry.”
Once upon a time, there was a child born with wonderful, talented and special magical skills. He was destined to be the hero of the wizarding world, the boy who would face evil over and over without knowing dread or desperation. He would grow up to do great things.
"Yeah, right. Look, stay at my place tonight. You can’t go back to your house. It’s not safe. I mean, your house doesn’t have any wards and Brutus is not a real threat to anyone. There’re plenty of rooms at home. Hermione will be delighted to have you there. She’s still angry with me..."
“Ha-ha.”
Things went by normally until lunch. I read the newspapers with their usual articles complaining about the Ministry and the way they had been handling the Death Gang. The group had been split in two according to them, and I could imagine the reason. The Daily Prophet, however, didn’t mention anything at all about The Almighty.
“How can you say that, Harry? Your godfather is dating my mother!”
“Not only I can but I will!”
Harry paled. “What?”
“Yes, you did!” Harry was about to reply when Draco suddenly let go of his hand and took a deep breath. “It’s gone! The pain is gone!” Draco smiled feebly as he rested his head back on the couch. “Phew. What a relief. I don’t think we need to call Dr Jules after all.”
That was a ridiculous idea. I wasn’t in any condition to duel with Harry Potter and he knew it.
“What did you feel, Potter?” I pretended not to care.
“He’s...,” Harry didn’t have the courage to finish the sentence. It was too much for him.
“I’ve been too moody. I lose patience easily and I tend to be unreasonable about everything. I yelled at Ron yesterday. And Draco… well, Draco is my favourite victim. I fight with him a lot. I don’t want to, but I do. And I know he’s hurt even if he doesn’t really say it.” Harry sighed. “So what can you prescribe for me?”
“Beauty? You still look like the living dead,” he declared.
“I won’t fall for that! Matthew wouldn’t trust you! You’re our enemy!”
“You’re right. They wouldn’t understand, because you’re a lunatic! Nathan is your mortal enemy? How can it be?”
Harry closed his eyes and he felt Draco holding him once again. He smiled.
He was the one who surprised me. He came to me, his steps unfaltering and his eyes burning like a lynx’s about to jump on its defenceless prey. He pulled my body towards him like I was made of paper. His arms wrapped around my waist. I moaned even before his lips covered mine in a spectacular kiss. His lips hurt, but what did I care? Mine was just as hungrier for his, giving it as good as it took. My hands clawed his robe to keep his body closer.
“What did you do?”
‘What I don’t understand is how no one has tried anything against us yet. The only explanation is that The Almighty is afraid of Potter. But if he is not here, then…’
‘You’re also a teaser, so I guess we’re even,’ Harry answered with a sad intonation.
“Draco!” Jonas said, grinning, his face full of scars lighting up. Now that they were alone he could be himself. “What’s up? I haven’t seen you in ages!”
The conversation was starting to get dangerous. Draco knew exactly where that was going to lead. Seamus would start remembering the old days and then he’d start to get closer and closer to Draco on the couch until a point where he would be all over him. Draco couldn’t allow that to happen.
Draco would have found the whole scene quite amusing if he wasn’t feeling suddenly very indisposed. His stomach was jolting like crazy and he was feeling weaker at each tick of the clock. He took advantage of the fact that Harry was busy trying to fix things with his boss while putting his clothes on, and he went out of Harry’s office with catlike footsteps. Unfortunately, Harry glanced at him that exact moment and gripped his arm.
“Well, actually, I was thinking…”
“Why?” Draco asked hurriedly.
Draco didn’t say anything. He was too busy thinking about it himself. Lucius had assured Draco that he wanted nothing to do with Nathan. But what if he had been lying? Lucius had been satisfied to see what had happened that day, almost as if that had been some sort of a test. If that was the truth, his father would have to pay.
“I have no idea. Maybe they’re trying to cover their asses. I mean, what they did to you and Nathan was a terrible thing! They should be arrested, not you! Ron took the papers that incriminate three members of the council. Those papers will be held in your defence. You’ll probably have to pay bail though for threatening Dursley and using magic against him,” Draco explained.
“Just take out your wand, Malfoy.”
“I’m Nathan. Nathan Malfoy Potter. Nice to meet you,” Nathan greeted with a smile.
“That was so profound coming from a person like you!” Dean exclaimed in a playful tone.
"Keep telling yourself that and one day it’ll turn out to be the truth."
Sighing, he watched Harry sleeping deeply on their bed. Again, Brutus whined.
“You trying to be evil is even worse than me trying to talk dirty,” Draco said smiling.
The stranger smiled, stroking Harry’s manhood in its full length. Harry moaned loudly.
“My dad... I don’t know,” Alfred finally said. I guess Harry’s sudden frailty got to him as much as it got to me. “He just disappeared. And my mum... She... She killed herself when I was eleven. You know how it is. The same old sad story. She didn’t have enough money to send me to school, and she didn’t want to accept anyone’s charity.”
“Malfoy, here’s the deal,” he said when he hung up the phone. “The boys can stay here until tomorrow. After that, they’ll be leaving with me. In the meantime, two of my men will stay here to protect them.”
Harry constantly fought with him over silly things such as uncapped toothpaste or the way Draco seemed to leave the wet towel on the bed. ‘It’s silk!’ he used to say referring to the sheets. Draco, to show his scorn, rolled his eyes. And Harry looked so unbelievably cute when he was irritated that Draco regularly did things to upset him only to make passionate love with him afterwards - on the wet expensive sheets.
"Thanks, Neville."
“Are you serious? That’s it?” I interrupted him. “You appreciate my help but you want me to step back?”
“That family thing!” he pointed to the house. “The Weasleys, Sirius, Remus, Hermione and you, gathering around like a big happy family, drooling over Nathan, who will probably be treated like a grandson to them, and a nephew. I’m not complaining about that, please. Far from it! I think it’s wonderful. But I’m not used to it and I felt out of place. Like I didn’t belong in there. I never had a family. That’s the reason why the Weasleys had always scared me so much when I was younger. They still do, in a way. I don’t belong there and I’m sorry.”
He disengaged his hand from Harry’s and left. Harry went back to the couch, knowing that if he went into the bedroom, Draco would accept him; but not wanting to do it because of the shame he was feeling. Draco was right. Harry wasn’t the only one facing a hard time but he acted like a selfish bastard. Draco was part of his life. Actually, Draco was his life. If only he had more time to work on their relationship…
“Malfoy? I don’t have all night,” his voice brought me back to our mundane problems.
“You don’t even know what’s going on,” I reminded her.
While Harry waited for his arrival, Sirius and Remus appeared through the fireplace with a worried expression on their faces. Harry immediately realised that something was wrong with Nathan, and as Sirius explained to him that Nathan was nowhere in the Mansion, Harry almost collapsed.
“You can’t be serious, Horace!” Ron exclaimed, fuming.
‘I ate breakfast, didn’t I?’ It was a poor defence, but the only one I had.
Hermione seemed to be in a state of shock when he told her about Lucius’ resurrection and the group he had gathered to transform Nathan into some sort of superman.
“Goodbye, Harry.”
Draco instantly turned around to face the one and only Lucius Malfoy. He looked at Saulus and then back at Lucius, wondering if he was having a nightmare.
“I don’t know. Maybe it’s someone that wants your relationship to end. Someone that is jealous of you or him, or maybe both.”
"Alive," Harry muttered as his body tensed and the paper fell off his hands.
“What is it, Harry? Just name it and I’ll do it.”
“I need to take Nathan away from here!” Draco said to Lucius.
Harry made Draco turned around to face him. “Are you jealous?” his tone of voice clearly indicated his astonishment.
Hermione didn’t like the sound of that. “Shouldn’t we call the Hit Wizards to help us, Harry? Bob is not reliable. And besides, you don’t know if Lucius is responsible for Nathan’s disappearance.”
He was definitely flirting. It made me wonder if I should continue to play the game and see how far things could go, but Angel and Alfred were there. The little one seemed not to notice what was happening. Alfred, however, was in a dangerous age. It was better to be careful.
Bob winked. “My mother used to sing it to me. She said it was the only song that put me to sleep when I was just a little two-year-old brat. My cousin’s husband used to sing to it to their kid when it wasn’t even born yet. It helped to calm both father and child.”
With my soul torn, I sat on the piano bench and started to play Rachmaninoff, concert n.2. I let the music flow and overtake me. I didn’t have an orchestra behind me, but I could hear it anyway. I could hear each and every instrument as if they were a part of me. I let myself go hoping that the music would make me forget about Harry and the fact that I knew absolutely nothing about the Book of the Dead apart from what I’d read in some muggle and wizarding books.
“Let’s go to bed,” said the stranger taking Harry in his arms.
“Is there something wrong with him?” Harry asked with a jolt in his stomach.
They had built a strong friendship as the days passed by after the war, enough for Draco to reveal some of his most intimate secrets, including his obsession for The-Boy-Who-Lived. When Draco decided to abandon the wizarding world, Seamus had supported him in every way he could. He helped him build a new life and a new identity.
I’d never be as good as new, but he didn’t need to know that.
It was an interesting proposition; one that Draco wasn't keen to let go easily. So he let himself be kissed and ravished until morning came.
“I thought all the Death Eaters were arrested.”
He remembered the time he fought against the Death Eaters in Voldemort’s war, and his mind drifted to Seamus. Was his friend all right? Seamus hadn’t been with Fred and Lee when they had saved Draco.
“I guess.”
“I guess they are in our trunks. You put them there, remember?”
She thought about it for a moment, her face turning all kinds of different shades of red. Draco was amused.
‘I’m fine.’
She kissed him tenderly. She knew her kiss had an extraordinary power over him.
Nathan took the thumb off his mouth and was about to say something when they heard a screech coming from the door. It was Petunia Dursley. At her feet, there were bags from the supermarket that she’d dropped from the shock. The food was spread on the floor and she was pale as a ghost. She thought she would never see her nephew again but there he was, right in front of her.
