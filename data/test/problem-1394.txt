"Go in the house, Teddy," Draco cuts in, and Teddy turns his pout on him.
The others fanned out as duels broke out all around the room.
"Never again," Harry's eyes overflow and he doesn't try to stop them, he can't.
"Yeah!" Teddy walked over to Draco and held out a hand, suddenly looking much older than his six years. "I'm Teddy. I'm very pleased to meet you."
Harry smiles awkwardly and passes the tickets over. “See you on Sunday?”
Draco shows him out, leaning against the door and taking a deep, steadying breath before going in search of Teddy, still playing happily in his room upstairs.
"So forever then," Draco repeated faintly as Harry kissed him again.
“Right.” Harry smiles at him, and Draco’s stomach does that stupid fluttering thing again. “See you.”
Harry sighs and closes his eyes again. “Can you tell me what happened?”
"Stalking me again, Potter?"
That draws a laugh out of her, as intended. She glances over at Draco and tilts her head.
Draco groans. “Don’t remind me. I was such an obnoxious little shit.”
"I WANNA COME! I WANT MY MOM! I WANNA SEE HARRY!"

me, Ron. He knows how to handle me when I'm in a dark mood and I don't know how to snap myself out of it, when to call me out and tell me to get over myself and when to be sweet—"
Draco shakes his head, and Harry leaves.
,' 'Mione," Harry responded. "Memories of when I'm a wolf are always a bit muddy, but they've been slowly coming back to me today. I was down. I tried to get up, but I couldn't. If Nadine hadn't intervened, I would be dead."
Just like it had on his first visit with his parents, the sign—explaining what the place is and why it's been left like this—rises from the ground.
"Come here."
not. Fuck.”
“Harry,” Draco speaks in a reassuring voice that comes out more gentle than even Draco himself has ever heard it before. “You’re Teddy’s godfather. Remus is gone, and I’m sure he’d love nothing more than for you to fill that role in his absence. You’ve

"You told me yourself that you wanted more with Draco. That you were going to ask him to dinner, that you wanted to try and change your relationship into something official. Something permanent. Why couldn't you still do that?"
Draco stares at him for a long moment before answering, color rising high on his cheeks. He looks good. Maybe a bit tired, but not nearly as heartbroken as Harry feels.
Draco groans and runs a hand over his face. He’s been trying to read in front of the fireplace for over an hour and he just can’t seem to focus. He’d taken Harry’s advice and planned a simple outing with Brandon and Teddy. They’ll go to the park and out for ice cream in the morning, but Draco still doesn’t feel overly comfortable with the situation. He’s seriously considering owling Brandon and cancelling the whole thing.
"Well, look who
"Do you
Draco’s stomach twists uncomfortably. It’s been two weeks since The-Night-That-Shall-Not-Be-Named, but the thought of it still stings and makes his face burn with shame. He’d tried to owl David and apologize the next day, but his letter had been returned unopened. He supposed he should just be grateful it hadn’t come back with a hex attached.

"Who did this?" Draco cut him off.
"Are you okay?" Harry asked gently, running a warm hand over Draco's back.
. Draco
Harry stands and rounds his desk, walking over to him. "It's a good thing I'm taken then, hm?"
Harry sends Teddy upstairs to put his bags in his bedroom at Draco’s house and finds him in the parlor.
Draco can only nod. George Apparates the three of them, and they land in the Emergency Department of the hospital, where the Healers immediately jump to action, taking Harry away and leaving Draco and George standing in the nearly-empty Waiting Room.
“What happened?” Draco asks.
"Yes! But...where are we going to find all of these specialists?"
The voice came from his left, and Harry looked up, surprised. His glamour must have slipped when he'd lost focus. "Yes?"
She sobbed against his shoulder.
channeling, then?"
Harry grinned at her. "Yeah. I realized I was being an idiot."
He wasn’t wrong; Diagon Alley is more crowded than any other time of year. The only advantage to the crowd is that everyone seems so caught up in their own holiday shopping frenzy that no one is paying much attention to them.
Lorcan turned and walked away without another word.
"I suppose it's my turn," a deeper voice spoke from the doorway.

Ron bristled. "My

“Skive off tonight. Just once.” Brandon presses a trail of kisses along his bare shoulder, sending a pleasant shiver down his spine, and Draco can feel his resolve wavering. “I’ll make it worth your while when we get back.”

“You’re an idiot, Potter,” he says, but the words come out strangely fond.
Ron stood and made his way to the door.

He was ready when the older wolf lunged at him. He leapt to the side and sank his teeth into its flank. The grey wolf howled in fury and threw him off. He landed a few feet away with a yelp, but he leapt back to his feet and began circling again immediately.
David yanks on his trousers, doing them up with more force than strictly necessary, his typical easygoing demeanor instantly shattered by Draco’s slip of the tongue.

"Arrest him and throw him back in Azkaban. Clearly seven years wasn't long enough."

"Yes, um, come in."
to be a less awkward term for that."
“Of course.”
Draco stretched languidly, kicking off the sheets and smiling up at him. "Hm. Better not. I'm still feeling a bit...
The kindness actually chokes him up a bit. “Thanks, Hermione.”
"Absolutely not. I can't do that, Gawain."
"What does that mean? The transition. What's happening to him?"
He summoned a couple of blankets from somewhere in the house and carefully draped one over the naked woman, not wanting her to be uncomfortable when she woke up.

said those things, Draco! Not me!"
“Because you’ve been sulking in a corner all night, and it’s a party, and you’re supposed to be having fun!”
“Merlin, is this the best you can do? It’s a wonder anyone has danced with you at all tonight.”
the day I’ve just had, love.”
Parker Davis stands before his desk a few minutes later, and Harry glares at him and casts a Silencing Charm over the door as Ron closes it behind them.
He glances around and spots him sitting at the desk he’s added to the corner of the room for his studies, asleep again, his face pressed against a textbook, his glasses digging into the side of his face, a parchment covered in notes beside it. His quill is still in his hand, the tip resting against his cheek, leaving a black smear of ink there.
“Yeah, see you.”
"Fine," Draco says firmly, glaring at Potter, daring him to disagree. "Where's Teddy now?"
Draco has to consciously keep his body relaxed as he turns his head to glance at Harry. Teddy looks up from where he, Rose, Victoire, Fred, and Hugo are all playing with toy cars on the floor.
"I'm not afraid of dying," Harry said softly, and Kasper, who had been facing partially away from him, jerked around to look at him. "I'm not risking the lives of anyone else with pack infighting. I'd rather be the one to die, if someone needs to."
"Yeah, I really wasn't planning to buy another—I mean, I wasn't sure if or when I'd ever be ready for another owl after I lost Hedwig, but then I found that little guy, and, well, I fell in love on sight."
"But I wanna come with you! I wanna see Harry!"
Draco grins. “Think you’ll be a Slytherin like me?”

"Yes, you do. It's already past your bedtime. Come on, pyjama time."
Harry’s eyes are shining at the memory. “It was,” he says sadly, clearing his throat. “They were in rough shape when the Ministry took them from their birth parents, but they couldn’t be in a better situation now. Paul and Spencer are great parents.” He smiles weakly before changing the subject. “How did today go? Did you and Violet get all your questions answered?”
Draco just smiled and kissed him again, then asked,  "Prep me?"
"Yes. The first was at St. Mungo's. He was there for a month while his bite healed. The second one was last week."
"Hm. Well, let's get you back to bed." Draco slid an arm around Harry and helped him to his feet. He hauled him all the way over to the bed and helped him under the covers.
"You mean Lorcan."
"Nadine should be the Alpha."
OH, I'LL KILL HIM! I'LL TEAR HIM TO SHREDS!"
"What's happening to him? Is he going to be okay?"
Draco nodded and sighed. "I'll try, love. I'm still a bit angry, but  in the spirit of that promise, I'll apologize to him for my outburst last night. For you."
“After lunch,” Harry smiles. “I’m getting hungry, aren’t you?”
"Yeah, too bad it doesn't do much for my own hair," he grinned for a moment before his expression turned serious again. "Don't worry. Just put Lorcan off until after the challenge, okay? Then you and Thomas will be okay, no matter what happens."
“Hungry?” Harry asks with a warm smile.
"I've been having these dreams, Draco," Harry said quickly as Draco was led to the door. "About the wolves. I need you to check on them. Please, Draco. Something's wrong. Please."
The train whistle sounds, and everyone jumps. “We’d better get you lot on the train,” Ron Weasley says from behind them. “Where’s Hugo? Hugo!”
He glanced around. Harry had certainly been busy—the house was decked in full Christmas splendor: A huge fresh wreath on the front door, garlands on the railings, smelling strongly of pine, decorated with shining red and gold ornaments that reflected the light of dozens of magical floating candles.
"Thanks for not blowing up the house," Harry teased, running a hand up his thigh affectionately.
"Oh shut up, Weasley," Draco rolls his eyes.
With a resigned sigh, Draco trudges up to the third floor and through the Eighth Year Common Room to his (and unofficially Harry's) bedroom and flops onto the bed, face-first, with a pathetic whine. He certainly doesn't

"Would it be alright if... Um. Could I introduce you to Marie? She's never met another werewolf before, and sometimes that makes her feel very alone, so I was hoping..."
Harry coughs uncomfortably. “Right. Yeah. So you’re Dudley’s…?”
“Draco! Are you decent? I have something to show you!”
"Why does it
Harry understood. "I'll send her out to you."
Draco looks down at himself, confused. "Oh...I thought I took those off."
"Draco, my love, my heart—" Harry whispered in his ear, and Draco moaned and writhed beneath him.
"His whole pack," Harry said, nodding solemnly. "From what he told us, they probably won't be the only ones. Our pack just grew by...a lot. They're in rough shape, they've been on the run from werewolf hunters for months."
. You insatiable beast."
"It's painful," Draco supplied.
He looked up to see Sofia looking down at him, twisting her hands nervously. "Can I speak to you for a moment? Privately?"
"Mhm."
Hermione chuckled. "Try a book. She'll like the ball, but she's been especially loving books lately."
"Thank you for coming, Christine," Harry said, reaching out to catch her hand. "I can't tell you what it means to me."
I bring a hand up to cover his, stilling the movement, and whisper, “Watch.”
"I'll owl Hermione and cancel our lunch today," Draco murmured as he perched on the edge of the bed, brushing Harry's dark hair away from his face with his fingers.
Harry finally breaks away to flip his best friend off. "As if
"You is missing Master Harry." This was a statement, not a question.
Well, except maybe to go get a few more tattoos.
"Got lucky?" Draco asked curiously, lifting his head to look at him. "Isn't that a Muggle term for...?"
for her next time."
"You didn't have to do anything to try and fix that though," Draco sighed.
Draco leans back to take another drink. “We’re okay. So...what’s next for you?”

"Hmm?" Draco opened his eyes and smiled. "Oh, hey. You're home."

"You know how hard this is for me, yet you
"Draco?"
"I love you, too," Draco managed to gasp. "Harry."
Draco stepped forward to shake Lewis's hand, while Harry smiled at the young girl, who stared at him with wide eyes. "Hello Marie, I'm Harry."
"'Course."
"No, wait!" Draco protested, as he was roughly hauled to his feet. "Harry, I—"
Sprawled on the floor and definitely
“What? Gin, seriously.
"Me?" McDougal grin was pure evil. "I just like killing the beasts."
"Harry—"
What a load of bullshit. His blood was as dirty as anyone's, it just wasn't
"I won't call him that again, promise."
Healer Gordon cleared her throat, and Harry startled, breaking away and flushing. "Sorry."
"Yes. Are you okay keeping it secret for now? At least, until we figure out how to tell people?"
Kasper? We either settled the terms for the Challenge today, or we initiated a full-on civil war within the pack within a month. Which is worse?"
okay?"
Harry takes his hand and pulls him toward their Common Room. "Come on!"
“Oh.”
Draco shook his head. "My ring is perfect, I love it." He hesitated for a second before asking, "Can I kiss you?"
not good enough for you. They all know It. This was a bad idea. Maybe we shouldn't—"
. Oh, no.
He finally turns his head to look at him, and Harry’s lips twitch into an involuntary smile. “It was.”
Harry swallowed nervously for what felt like the hundredth time. "I'll think about it. Okay?"
"You've been doing that a lot lately. Catching me. Saving me. Thanks." Harry cupped his cheek, eyes soft and loving, and Draco couldn't resist leaning down to kiss him again.
Harry turns and gives him a small smile, but there's a fire in his eyes that Draco doesn't quite understand. He looks intense, almost angry? But Draco has beaten him to the Snitch before in these little games, and he's never been upset, just frustrated with himself and more determined to win next time...
Draco runs a tentative hand over the back of Harry’s neck, then up into his surprisingly soft curls, stroking them in a way that he hopes is soothing, feeling uneasy at the thought that he’s just seen a side of Harry Potter that very few people have ever seen. It feels monumental, and Draco has the wild thought that things between them will never be the same after this, now that Harry has let him in.
"Oh, uh, are you sure you want to... Er, don't you want to talk about how it went tonight?"
good at that.”
His best friend sighed and walked over to the door. "Alright. I'll see you in the morning, okay? Ron and I are just up in the other guest room upstairs next to Thomas's if you need anything. We're on the right, he's on the left."
"I didn't
Harry's grin just broadened as he pulled the door open and swept a hand toward the short staircase. He clicked his fingers and lanterns along the walls flickered to life, lighting the stairs and the open room at the bottom.
“I didn’t see any boils…?”
“Well, I suppose that makes sense. It’s a bit smaller, and I imagine you’ve always been a bit smaller than Dudley, haven’t you?” Lottie continues in her friendly voice, blissfully ignorant.
Harry hummed in agreement, slotting their mouths together and deepening the kiss. His hand slid up the back of Draco's neck, his fingers sinking into the hair at the base of his braid. Draco tangled his own hands in Harry's thick, surprisingly soft curls, delighting in the way they slipped through his fingers.
"So, erm. That's everything." Harry finished, shrugging awkwardly.
Kasper still looked wary.
"Draco said they were giving you Wolfsbane?" Christine asked once she was in the room, already drawing her wand and casting a few different Diagnostic Spells.
Draco makes a hasty retreat back to his own home, leaving Harry to deal with that mess.
"Do I
Harry grins and brings a hand up to cup Draco's cheek, leaning back in and drawing out the kiss in a way that has Draco flushing down the back of his neck.
Not taking his eyes off the guard, Harry raised his other hand and blasted a hole in the wall of his cell, shaking the entire building with the force of the blast.
Seamus bursts out laughing. "Well, it wasn't their first
"I mean, maybe?" Harry laughs. "If you're willing."
Harry stares at him when he steps away, looking more stunned than if Draco had slapped him. He takes a shaky breath, then practically bolts from the room.
He stared at her. "So what do you see today, then?"
"Yeah," Harry kissed him again. "I'm just going back to sleep anyway."
"I have to."
"Harry?" Draco called out.
"Yes, sir." The house elf responded, looking relieved.
"Shall I compare thy...thine? Thine. Shall I compare thine arse to a summer's day?" Harry fought a smile as Draco burst out laughing, dropping his forehead to his chest, his whole body shaking. "Thine arse art more lovely, and naught shall taste as sweet—"
Ignoring the taunt, Harry bolted up the stairs to grab his wand from where he'd left it on the bedside table that morning.
"Are you okay, Draco?"
A few weeks later, Harry finds himself seeking comfort from his two best friends. Again. He groans and drops his head down onto his arms, accidentally knocking his drink aside. "I'm such an idiot. Why did I ever fall for him anyway? It's not like we didn't know what he was like."
•••••
"Mm. But I'm home now, so what are you going to do about it?"
Harry's plea for him and Weasley to get along seemed like a hopeless cause.

Draco stares blankly at him. “That’s not a thing.”
"Don't you?"

"I really am sorry," Ron said, and Draco heard footsteps and hands thumping against backs as the two men hugged. "I think I understand now. I'll do better next time, I promise."
"No, we'd need some kind of security."
Draco hates that Harry seems completely unaware of how much Draco hates him, asking about Draco’s job before licking away the ice cream that has dripped down his cone and onto his wrist with an embarrassed little smile while Draco’s insides slowly melt.
"Okay. Tell her we'll be right there," Draco sighed. "Take her to the Drawing Room."
“I’ll help you practice before your exams. I’m sure you’re better than you think,” Draco says gently, watching as Harry’s expression transforms from concern to pure relief.
Harry reached out and took his hand. "Hey, it's okay. I'm okay, kid."
"Sorry, but no."
Harry spent the rest of the day at Wolf's Hollow. He could feel the eyes of Kasper and Lorcan on him most of the time, but he purposely ignored them.

hates Harry Potter.
It’s hard to believe the three of them are back at Malfoy Manor again, celebrating Christmas with ‘Grandmother Narcissa,’ as Teddy calls her, for the second time. The mood walking up to the house is so very different from the year before. Harry has been to the house many times now, and he’s become disconcertingly close with Draco’s mother. In fact, Draco suspects them of meeting without him for tea when he has Teddy. It sounds crazy, and they both laughed when he asked them outright about it, and yet, he can’t shake the feeling that he’s right.
"Merlin, he really
A few days after that, Draco arrived at Grimmauld Place to find Harry still in bed, a barely-touched breakfast tray on the bedside table. His skin was tinged with grey, and dark circles had appeared beneath his eyes overnight.
“I— ”
Harry looked slightly dazed. "Try... Um, what?"
“Don’t
"Sofia." The blonde woman smiled brightly at him, her bright blue eyes glittering with unabashed desire that made Harry's stomach turn. Harry smiled weakly back. He probably would have found her attractive in the past, he supposed, but now he only had eyes for
Harry froze, his expression unreadable as he gazed back at Draco. He slowly ran a thumb over his own bottom lip, a move Draco knew meant he was subtly casting a Breath-Freshening Charm to remove the taste of the vile potion from his mouth. He swallowed hard and ran a hand through his hair before responding.
"Harry and Draco went up to Draco's room, I think," Dean drapes an arm over Seamus's shoulders. "Looked like they were about to have their first fight. Harry looked pretty mad."
"No."

"Did you want something, Harry?"

The past month has been a bit of a disaster, relationship-wise. The first month Draco had had Teddy when he and Brandon had begun dating had felt like torture, only seeing Brandon for the occasional date and never letting him sleep over with Teddy there, but this time Draco is grateful for the distance. The non-stop fighting is driving him mad and he knows that something has to change, he just isn’t sure what. How had he gone from thinking he was falling in love with Brandon to...
Draco hates that he knows what Harry’s mouth tastes like, how it feels to have his hot, solid weight pressing down on him, and he hates that he’ll never know it again, because Harry is just so very
"Draco?"
Draco Apparates from the front porch. He showers and changes into pyjamas before gratefully crawling into his bed and burying his face in his pillow.
"Where?"
A few hours later, Draco was surprised by the arrival of an owl carrying a small package at his window. The owl was only seven or eight inches tall, with brown and tan feathers and enormous yellow eyes. It hopped inside and regarded him with a curious tilt of its head as he carefully untied the package and opened the note on top.
"I wouldn't care if you

"You should keep your distance, you know. You could end up sick in bed beside me."
Teddy’s school purchases are still out, piles of boxes and bags sprawled over the floor, everything forgotten except Teddy’s new owl, a big brown barn owl he has yet to name, who he took upstairs with him.
“Onto your front,” he orders, his voice coming out low and raspy, raw with emotion.
Harry walked into the Auror Department on Monday morning with several dozen coffee cups for the entire department floating above his head and a cheerful smile on his face.
Harry shrugged. "I haven't really felt much since you put that Numbing Salve on it yesterday. It twinges a bit sometimes, but it's not bad."
"You really managed to keep it from him?" Hermione asked. She hugged Harry tightly, then let him go, stepping back but leaving a hand on his arm.
aunt.
He moved to gently brush his fingers over a bruised cheek. "Hi."
"Yes, that's Fenrir. Not what you remember, is he?"
,” Brandon sneers. “Teddy.”
The elf set to work and soon the room was partially lit by a cozy fire and beginning to warm up a bit. Draco sat on the edge of the bed and gently trailing his fingers over Harry's face, then pushed them through his dark hair. His jaw was scruffier than usual, and the dark circles under his eyes were so purple they looked almost like bruises. Draco glanced around for Harry's glasses, but couldn't seem to find them anywhere.
Draco helps him to the sofa and Harry lays down, throwing an arm over his eyes.

She kissed his cheek. "Remember what I said, Harry. About Draco. Make sure he knows that—" The sharp
Hermione laughed. "Her godfather may have stopped by with cookies a few days ago."
"That's not something I ever want you to see."
Draco runs a hand through his hair self-consciously, painfully aware that he’s still wearing pyjamas.
"Of course. Draco's happiness is my top priority. And you make him happy, Harry. I can tell."
"Fuck," Harry breathed, head tipping back and eyes fluttering closed as Draco pressed open-mouthed kisses down the side of his neck.
* * *
,” Harry says firmly, tilting his face up to kiss him chastely. “If you want it?”
"Good?"
“Draco, what are you…?”
As they danced, Harry thought about how far they'd come together, how lost he'd felt when he'd first been turned that awful night after fighting Greyback, how stupid he'd been to push Draco away back then, when Draco was the only one who could save him. Draco, who was smiling at him in that moment, his grey eyes alight with happiness. Draco was his salvation, Draco was his

"Go on, bring Teddy down to eat when he's done looking at his room."
"Kasper has requested to join us, as is his right as Beta, and I agreed."
"Isn't it nice?" Draco effused, "he's been working on it for years."
old!”
Draco shot him a nasty look, but was prevented from responding by Harry's return.
Harry attempted a weak smile. "S'pose not." He turned on the spot and Apparated away.
“Am I insane for thinking this might actually work?” He muses aloud.
"We could put his leg under a Stasis Charm and heal the smaller wounds? Wait for him to wake up?"
“I understand,” Harry says softly, reaching out to touch his arm. “You don’t have to tell me anything. But you know you can come to me, right? Anytime. I want to be there for you when you need me.”
Throwing the covers off his legs, he stumbled into the bathroom and stared at himself in the mirror. He didn't look
"Only the bondmate is allowed in," one of the guards said, looking over the Medical Release.
"Stop! This is my fault." Harry quickly interrupted Hermione's angry retort.

Hermione rolled her eyes at him. "Yes,
"That I'm sick." Harry pulled a face at Draco's expression. "What? I haven't used that one yet!"
Harry shook his head sharply, cutting him off.
The first time he'd been there, Draco had been surprised by the accents of deep forest green in the curtains, the bedspread, the two chairs flanking the fireplace, and the rug. Harry had laughed when he'd commented on it. "Gryffindors are allowed to like green, Draco," he'd teased.
that.
"For work! And I wouldn't have said yes!"
When Draco wakes up the second time he finds himself alone in Harry’s bed, bright afternoon sunlight flooding the room. For a moment he burrows deeper under the covers, reluctant to leave the bed’s warmth, until he hears voices coming from downstairs.
Harry, who'd been leaning against Draco's shoulder and fighting to keep his eyes open, startled fully awake. "Your what?"
Draco's blush deepened. "Panse,
Harry reached out and touched her hand again. "Nadine."
"He was
"Hawy! Dwaco!"
"A statement."
"They're all waiting for you downstairs, you know," Draco murmured.
"Thanks again for your help with that Potions paper," Harry says, fiddling with the strap on his bag. "I completely forgot about the varying effects of stewed Mandrake in Memory Potions, depending on maturity and how finely chopped they are..."
Potter's eyes drifted from Draco's face to the mess of shattered glass and blue potion spattered on the wall behind him, and Draco was torn between fury at Potter for showing up at the worst possible time, shame for what he had done, and resigned acceptance of his fate.
" Ron bellowed when Draco moaned into the kiss.
Harry manages to successfully ignore them for a few minutes, but it's impossible to do so when they're standing right in front of him, Ron and Hermione putting on polite expressions as Draco makes enthusiastic introductions.
"I love you, too. Now, let's go back upstairs and get some rest."
Draco followed her into the kitchen and helped prepare sandwiches for themselves, as well as a couple for Ron, and mashed up carrots for Rosie.
“Morgan got hold of Spencer’s wand and tried to turn Dorian into a deer, obviously,” Harry snickers. “Apparently they watched some Muggle children’s movie with them the night before…”
After eating quickly, Harry sits beside him and tentatively leans over to rest his head in Draco's lap, tucking his legs to curl up on the sofa. "Are you sure this is okay?"
"It's not because we
"Potter, are you asking me over for a

“Mmhm.”
did we try to pretend this was some sort of friends-with-benefits situation if we both just wanted to be together?"
Draco slams the door behind him.
"Reviewing the drastic policy shifts this year, I would say at least six months."
He almost didn't catch the whispered "okay," as he shut the door behind him.
Harry draws back with a breathless gasp, leaning against the pillows that have been propping him up. “Merlin, Draco. I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean for that to—”
“Yeah.
Davis looks terrified. "I, er, well I—"
"Hello Draco," Andromeda said softly, holding out a hand. "I'm your Aunt Andromeda."
Harry faced Laith and Mia-Rose next, reaching out to touch Laith's shoulder. "Laith," he said softly. "I'm so sorry about Mathias."
"Thanks."
"No! Just...noticing."
know how much better it is than that putrid swill they peddle at the hospital."
He hates the way he laughs with his whole body, tossing his head back and letting it roll out of him. He hates his face-splitting grin and mesmerizing eyes, a unique shade of emerald he’s never seen on anyone else. He hates his stupid new glasses and his stupid lightning bolt scar that cuts into his right eyebrow and his stupid just-fucked hair. He hates the way he carries Teddy on his shoulders and the warm affection the sight elicits inside of him against his will.
Oh, that's just ridiculous. You two are the stupidest, most stubborn

Ron and Hermione entered the room a short while later, shutting the door softly behind them.
“No,” Harry kisses his cheek. “Stay, please. Just to sleep? I won’t push you, I promise.”
“Well, this is the best I can do without stepping on anyone’s toes, which I’m sure they all appreciated.”
“My Healer said after he comes back for one more Vitals Check I should be able to go home. Would you...would you like to come over for some Butterbeer? Or hot cocoa? End this date on a happier note?”
"You're welcome," George said, looking even more uncomfortable as his wife looked over at him with adoring eyes.
Harry had been bitten
with him.
"Robards had to be the one who cast the Imperius Curse on Kingsley, right?" Ron asked in a hushed tone as he and Hermione entered the Ministry, walking through the atrium as casually as possible.
” He says it in a cheesy, over-the-top voice, making Violet laugh.
Harry flipped them over, lifting Draco's shirt and laving kisses over his lightly muscled stomach. "Good, because I can't seem to keep my hands off of you tonight."
"They were saying you fucked Davis!" Draco screams in his face.
"What can you do for me? Hmm. Mate with me, Harry. You don't need that pale human plaything. I'll take much better care of you than he ever could." Mathias spoke in a deep, sultry voice.
Ron spat in his face. "Fuck you."
“Do you want to stay for dinner with me and Teddy tonight?”
"They're
Harry's eyes widened and Draco gasped, looking horrified. "They did
The Healer smiled and nodded, and the man entered, leading a young girl by the hand.
Draco pulls back and glances around at the half-prepared meal around them.
The car ride home is silent. As soon as they make it through the door to Grimmauld Place, Harry sets the boxes down and drops to his knees, violent sobs wracking his entire body. Draco kneels too, wrapping his arms around him and pulling him against his chest, hoping that holding Harry while he cries will help ease the aching there, too.
Harry visibly cringed at the thought, but word about his transformation was out—the damage was already done. Might as well find out what they could now that discretion was no longer a concern.
"Swear it!"
"Helpful, thanks," Harry bit out sarcastically, letting Draco drag him by the hand to go downstairs and join his pack for breakfast.
Draco nodded again, and the elf put a small hand on top of his, patting it reassuringly. "He will be okay, sir. He will be back.
His former boss's face appeared in his memory, his expression cold and detached, "I'm sorry, Potter. We just can't have a werewolf on the Auror Force, I'm sure you understand. It's just not safe. How unfortunate, you were one of the best, you know, but..."
reason, then?" Ron turned to McDougal. Earthquake or not, Hermione still needed more time.
He's fully expecting Potter to pull the 'Savior of the Wizarding World' card, and, watching the warring expressions on his face, Draco would have wagered he was considering it, but Potter doesn't.
"Bugger
Harry stiffened, watching the other man closely.

” Draco says, voice heavy with sarcasm.
"Yeah," Draco whispers back. He gently takes Harry's hand off of his wrist, but that just means he ends up holding Harry's hand in his other hand. "I'm just going to go, okay?"
“What is it?” Draco doesn’t want to know, isn’t sure he can handle the mental image much less the real thing, but he can’t stop himself from asking.
"You don't wear your glasses anymore," Draco murmured into the dark mane, his tone questioning.
Fully-dressed and wands in hand, they make their way downstairs and open the front door to greet their mysterious late-night visitors.
"So? There've been rumors about those three for years. Who's to say there isn't some—"
Harry's eyes narrowed. "How much do you know about werewolves, Hermione?"
"It's possible it was inadvertent. Harry being an Auror determined to overpower and capture him...Fenrir could have believed him to be a challenger, activating the magic of a Werewolf Challenge, without either of them realizing it."
"Oh," Draco still didn't quite know how to respond to her, but he smiled awkwardly.
"Harry?"
Harry smiled awkwardly. "Well, you've come to the right place. Come in."
They separate at Teddy’s squeal of delight.
"Yes, Harry showed us everything!" Hermione crossed the room and pulled him into a hug.
“Oh Merlin,” the man groans as Harry sucks at his neck, tipping his head back against the wall. “Harry, baby,
Draco rolls his eyes at him. “No, they’re not. I’m not nearly drunk enough to process this. And no, I’m not going to hex anyone.”
Ginny squeezes his arm and says something in his ear. He shakes his head, and she presses his t-shirt into his hand, then releases his arm and walks away, giving me a hard, appraising look as she passes by.
Draco’s gaze drops to his mouth, and he feels himself nod. Harry tugs on his hand, pulling him closer. Draco finds himself cupping his cheek and leaning down, barely aware of his own movements. Harry slides a hand into his hair as their lips meet. They start slow, their lips brushing, pulling back, changing angles slightly, and touching again, until Draco lets out an impatient whine. Harry smiles against his mouth and leans in to deepen the kiss, running his tongue over Draco’s bottom lip, seeking entrance that he grants immediately, whimpering into Harry’s mouth as he plunges his tongue inside, exploring Draco’s mouth with a proprietary confidence that Draco can’t help finding hopelessly attractive.
They sat together in silence for a few minutes.
your cock," Draco murmured, voice hoarse, drawing Harry's gaze back to meet his own. "Love how fucking
"You seem more lucid than you've been all day," Draco commented, pushing his thoughts aside.
“Yes,” I conjure lube into my hand and begin working him open as gently as I can.
Harry lifted Draco off his lap and laid him gently on his back, leaning over him and pressing their foreheads together. "So, forever then?"
“Don’t,” I say. “Don’t run again.”
he told himself, accidentally lying a second time.

salad? Fancy for you,” Harry teases. “What’s the occasion?”
“Okay,” Draco agrees. “But just to sleep.”
She downs her own shot and watches expectantly until I do the same.
Ron tossed the card back to Harry without looking at it. Harry caught it and found his own face staring back at him. With a grimace and a flick of his hand, he sent it careening into the fireplace.
•••••
“I appreciate that,” Harry laughs.
"Yes, just long enough to have a bit of breakfast."
“What good would it do?” Harry sighs. “The people who were responsible are dead.”
Teddy cheers for them both on the ground, laughing and jumping up and down. The kid is already a Quidditch fanatic, and Draco blames Harry for that entirely. Marc looks immensely bored sitting beside him.
After a long moment, they heard stirring in the room.
She gave him an exasperated look. "
"No, I do. I do love you, too," Draco blurts. "I've been scared to say it, but I do. I love you too, Harry."
"We'll make it official in a few days when things settle down, but consider that a formal job offer. Now, all of you go home and get some rest. That's an order."
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know I'm only joking, love. Tell me what's on your mind."
My world seems to tilt back into place. It’s not fixed, not by a long shot, but suddenly everything makes sense. Except…
* * *
"I love you," Draco said softly, later. He trailed a hand through Harry's hair, and Harry made an appreciative noise, nuzzling against Draco's neck and pressing a kiss behind his ear. He draped an arm over Draco's chest and held him tight.
"Damn." Draco pulled Harry's arm over his shoulder, curled up against his side, and yawned. "Well, I'm sure there will be another one in the next ten minutes, if I know Gryffindors at all, and you three especially—just wake me up when it starts."
"Hey, it's me."
Everything Harry had made smelled heavenly, which was unusual, but Draco wasn't hungry. Not for food, anyway.
"Is it true?" Harry asks without preamble, "that you've been spreading rumors? Telling people that I had sex with you?"
Harry couldn't help being reminded of the Burrow. It all felt strangely comfortable and right. Like family. He liked it, but a voice in his head reminded him not to get too attached.
“Harry.” Draco rubs a hand over his shoulder and into his hair, carding his fingers through the thick curls until he starts to stir. “
"It's been building to this for days," Nadine murmured, her voice bitter. "She's been ranting, getting more and more unstable, and with no ruling Alpha, or even Beta, to check her..." Her eyes turned accusing as she glared up at him. "
Harry smiled and squeezed his hand tighter for a second. "I haven't been able to sleep either. It's been hell."
Harry tugged the tie from Draco's long hair and buried his hands in it, just as the two other teams of Aurors, who had secured the now-unnecessary perimeter, entered the building.
Draco slides in too, cuddling up against him. Harry gives him a soft goodnight kiss, but keeps to his word and doesn’t try to turn it into anything more.
blame him, but it still stings to see it—the physical evidence that he's moved on.
Draco glares at him from the bed. "I won't tell you anything."
“But Dudley—“
Weasley Apparated away without another word, leaving an awful silence behind.
She opened it and Draco caught sight of a familiar, untidy scrawl. Just one sentence. He was too far away to read it, but he knew the handwriting.
"She is," Harry smiled again. "Would you like to meet her?"
Harry doesn’t make it home until after Teddy and Violet have both already gone to bed, and Draco and Lottie are having tea again, talking quietly in the sitting room.
“Diagon Alley,” Draco supplies.
“How would

sorry," Draco promised, sliding into his lap and smiling triumphantly when Harry grabbed him by the hips to hold him there.
“Hey,” Harry pushes the door further open with his shoulder so that he can skirt around it as it falls closed again, carefully balancing two containers and two forks in his hands.
"I wanted to ask for your blessing," he blurted, "to propose to Draco. To marry him."
Draco's eyes widened. "From who?"
“Well, since you’re a recovering invalid,” Draco smirks. “I thought I’d ride you, if that’s alright with you?”
—don't doubt yourself so much."
, Ron."
. The sound of that never ceases to thrill Draco, even when he's sneezing into his elbow again, sniffling miserably.
The Eighth Year students aren't allowed to participate in school Quidditch games, but that hasn't stopped them from forming their own teams and playing Professor McGonagall-sanctioned games on Thursday evenings.
“My father. If I didn’t marry the Greengrass girl. He threatened to…to send someone to hurt you. I spat in his face. I didn’t believe he really had the resources to make that happen from Azkaban. But then you were attacked in Diagon Alley a few days later, and even though you were fine, I just couldn’t…everything I said that day, when I left, it was all a lie. I was trying to protect you. But when the time came I couldn’t go through with it. I couldn’t marry her.”
"Because he's
Draco softens despite himself. "See you at lunch?"
"Hey! Babies are
Harry turned and looked over at them, raising a disdainful eyebrow. "Stand down."
Draco shifted the tray of food into one hand and knocked softly before opening their bedroom door. "Harry?"
Harry's pronouncement was met with stunned silence. He glanced around at the gathered pack.
. He's been staying with me for the past two weeks. Maybe we should stick with what's familiar for the first month."
Harry's eyebrows shot up, and he immediately flushed crimson. "Er, no, no thanks, that's okay—"
going to ask you to leave."
Harry settles back down in Draco's lap.
Hermione really does show up a few minutes later, waking up a delighted Teddy and sending him through the Floo. She gives Draco a tight, sympathetic hug, kisses his cheek, and presses two vials of Hangover Potion into his hand. “I’ll bring Teddy home after dinner tomorrow, alright?”
As the evening began to wind down, Harry settled down at a table with his best friends and watched Draco dancing with his mother, both of them looking like they were barely holding back tears as they spoke softly to each other.
filling it for almost a year now, and you’ve always been a great father-figure to Teddy. It’s not surprising he’s been feeling a desire to make it more...official, in a way.”
"That's really not up to you to decide, Harry."

"Nothing, dinner smells excellent."
"Yes, that. I'm
Maybe there was hope of being on friendly terms with Weasley after all, as strange an idea as that was.
Potter's face gives nothing away, and he says nothing, awkwardly shifting from foot to foot, a folded piece of parchment in his hand.
When he didn't get a response, he slid a hand under Harry's chin and gently tipped his face up, forcing him to meet his gaze. Harry's typically bright eyes were dull, and they reflected doubt again, with a hint of self-loathing that made Draco want to scream.
Draco looks over at Harry, hesitant to leave, but knowing that someone definitely needs to pick up Teddy. Draco stands up to go, but Ron holds up a hand.
"Post-game party!" Dean shouts when they come through the portrait hole, just like he does every week no matter who wins the game, as they pass through the Common Room. "We're getting food and Butterbeer from the kitchens! You two coming?"
, Draco.
"I don't know how people will react—"
Harry turned around again and smiled. "Mathias."
Ron retorted with a scowl. "I'm surprised
Hermione continued. "And word
Draco said yes, and soon he found himself drifting off, Harry's warm body underneath him, his hands massaging over his scalp and running through the long strands of his hair, as the Quidditch match continued in the background through the radio. For the first time in a long time, he felt safe. Content and happy in a way he never imagined he could be.
"Right. So, you're smart. You're good at Quidditch—"
"We have time before you need to go. I would make you feel so good..."
Draco shook his head. "I know you lied to me. I know you've been lying all this time," he blurted. "I understand why you did, but Harry, please— be honest with me now. Don't leave like this, pretending everything's fine when we both know it's not."
"Recordatio Recreo," Hermione practiced the wand movement the next day, repeating the spell she'd found under her breath before turning her wand on her husband.
" Hermione had chided gently. "Draco really wants to do this, doesn't he?"
Draco waited while Harry took a quick shower, smiling fondly at the sight of his dripping curls when he emerged in clean, comfortable clothes, and then they made their way down to the kitchen.
Harry growled and grabbed him, deftly flipping Draco onto his back. "You're going to pay for that, Malfoy."
"She has a younger sister, you remember? Just a couple years younger than us. Astoria?"
Healer Gordon frowned. "I don't either. I'll hold him off as long as I can, but I'm not sure how long that will be. I'll keep my report on your injuries as vague as possible. Does that sound alright?"
“You introduced Marc to us after less than two months,” Harry says.
“I’m sorry, I wasn’t looking where I was going.”
Draco asked in an anguished whisper.
"I'll ah, I'll just go get us some drinks, Draco."
surname.
He pointed, and Hermione brought it to him. Harry pulled out the books Kasper had selected for her.
Smiling, he continued on his way to his and Draco's suite.
He steps back and presses a trio of tickets into Draco’s hand. They're for the Quidditch World Cup in August. Box seats, right at goal-height. They must have cost a small fortune.
he'd been expecting, but...this wasn't it.
"I hate this," Harry murmured, running a hand over Draco's hair, combing his fingers through it. "I understand why we're keeping our relationship quiet, I'm not mad about it, but I hate it."
An owl fluttered into the room and dropped a note into Hermione's outstretched hand, interrupting his brief reverie.
“Okay.” Draco glances at the clock. “We have two hours until Hermione sends Teddy home. I’m guessing you told her to send him here?”
"I'm glad you're feeling better," Harry said, before shoving half of the roll in his mouth.
And then the man glances over and notices Draco, his eyes widening, and Draco’s stomach twists painfully when he recognizes him from the papers: Derek Smathers.
Draco's warmth was solid and grounding, and Harry found himself wanting to lean into it. He turned over to look up into his boyfriend's face.
•••••
“Thanks. He’s over at Hermione and Ron’s until after dinner, but he insisted that he can’t go to bed tonight without them.”
It’s not the first time he’s thought about it; kissing Harry. Draco’s been going a bit insane thinking about it recently, in fact. When they’d stopped for Butterbeers to warm up between buying a pair of sapphire earrings for Draco’s mother and a new case of Quidditch balls for Ron, and Harry had licked a stray drop of the amber liquid from his lips, Draco had thought he might expire on the spot. Desire had flooded through him, his whole body aching with it. And Harry, the oblivious bastard, had just given him an embarrassed little smile and asked if he’d listened to the Quidditch match the previous night. Sometimes, Draco still hates him.
Hermione closed the door softly.
•••••
“Hello?” Draco calls into the Floo.
“I want you comfortable, sweet,” Draco chides. “Speaking of…”
He swallowed. "You look so much like..."
“Doesn’t matter,” George shrugs. “Being around you brings out a side of him I haven’t seen in a long time. None of us have. Gin tried after the war, really she did, but she wasn’t who he needed. You are.”
"Hello," Harry said. "Er, can we sit?"
Kasper shot him a sharp look. "The Granger girl? The one who works in the Department for Magical Beings at the Ministry?"
"That would be perfect. You know, we're going to need a Potions expert, too," Harry grinned. "Good thing I happen to know the very best one."
His hand continues running through Harry's curls, tugging on the ends and occasionally swirling one around a fingertip before letting it bounce back.
Harry shrugged. "I dunno. I should shower. And I suppose I
“Oh? Did she say why?”
Kasper nodded, breathing shakily, and closed his eyes, finally allowing himself to sleep.
"What?"
Harry stroked his cheek. "I know, I'm sorry, I'm only teasing."
Harry finally nodded and Apparated them up to the bedroom, where he set Draco on the bed and set about removing his clothes reverently, kissing over every inch of pale skin as it was revealed—worshiping, claiming, loving—Draco's name a broken litany on his lips, until their bond was undeniably sealed.
He glanced over at his boyfriend to see that he was doing the same. Although, Draco's clothes also got an Anti-Wrinkle Charm that Harry didn't know, and couldn't possibly be bothered to learn.
What is there to
The room had clearly been expanded slightly using magic, and it was extremely clean. There were cabinets on the upper half of the walls all around the room, and plenty of counter space beneath, and a stone dais in the center of the room with plenty of room for him to have multiple cauldrons going at once. Bright lights lit the room from every direction.
before you throw. The Keeper won’t know what hit ‘em!”
Harry grinned. "Not me, for once. But Draco here doesn't seem inclined to clear off for check ups, and most of the Healers don't like that much."
"I'm not convinced," Draco tugs at Harry's hair and leans down so that he can continue kissing his neck. "We're
you!"
“‘Course she does,” Harry chuckles. “
He set his hands on his boyfriend's hips and tugged him close, hugging him from behind and effectively cutting him off. "I told you. I don't sleep well without you in my bed," he murmured in Harry's ear, sending a shiver down his spine.
“Yes, they did,” Harry says simply, watching his face for something, Draco isn’t quite sure what.
I’m going to kiss him again, and I finally do. I try to keep it slow. I want him to know exactly how I’m feeling, how much I

"Hm. I'm sorry. I, er... I may have shouted at him through the Floo after you fell asleep."
Draco leans down for a messy kiss, propping his hands on either side of Harry’s head. “I’m really—really—glad you’re okay—oh
"What?"
Something inside of Draco snapped. With a scream of fury, he threw the vial. The glass shattered and the potion splattered satisfyingly against the wall. Draco picked up another and threw it too, and another, and another, until every vial was smashed.
Draco caught Harry's wrist before he could pull on a shirt, and kissed the back of his neck, relishing the shudder that ran through him.
“Sir, sir, you can’t be back here—“
She covered her mouth again. "Oh, I wasn't supposed to say that! Oh, no. I didn't mean to—it just slipped out. Please don't tell him I told you. I'm sure he'll show you when he's ready."

think he's lying?"
Harry turned off the stove top and waved a hand at the pot, presumably casting a stasis charm to prevent the curry from burning, but Draco didn't particularly care at the moment because now Harry's hands were free to run through his hair, and pull him tightly against him, which they did.

"It'll suffice."
"M'kay."
"Erm...yes?"
“Oh? Does Dave have work or something?”
“Would you like to join us for tea, son?”
did."
“A Hungarian Horntail,” Ginny giggles. “It’s from an old joke, from when we were sixteen. Someone asked me if it was true that he had a Hippogriff tattooed on his chest, and I told her it was a dragon instead. More macho, you know.”
"Yes. Well." Draco clears his throat. "I believe you were extolling my many non-Death Eater virtues, Potter. Do go on."
"I know. But you'll feel better if you do. Just some toast?" Draco cajoled, and Harry relented.
Harry shook his head sharply. "No. Please—please stay. Would you just...lie down with me? I promise I won't attack you like I did yesterday."
"Malfoy?"
"So, where's the ferret?"
“Now what?”
"As you wish, Mr. Malfoy-Potter."
Draco slides even closer, bringing a hand to Harry’s waist to stroke over his bare skin. “I love you, too. Merlin, so much.”
"What's that like? The enhanced senses?"
"Yes, he has a shop on Diagon Alley, but it's all legal, completely above board, I swear—"
This time, the kiss is softer, slower and sweeter, but it still sends heat coursing through my body. I'm clinging to him, my fingers twisting in his soft t-shirt, his hands dropping down to bracket my hips. He pulls me flush against him, hands sliding around to firmly cup my arse, and I realize he's just as hard as I am as we both groan at the contact.
One afternoon in December, a few months after that first meeting at the club, they found themselves in Harry's room back at Grimmauld Place.
Draco propped himself up on an elbow so he could lean over and kiss him affectionately before trailing his slender fingers over Harry's cheek. "I know, I just wanted to see you turn this
"Yeah," Harry sighed. "I appreciate what he's doing, but I've barely seen him all week. He was in the Potions lab before even I woke up this morning."
"Mr. Weasley, that's not—"
Ron shrugged awkwardly, and Draco grinned.
Back at St. Mungo's, Draco had been infuriating various Healers all day by refusing to leave Harry's side, much to Harry's amusement.

"I'm so sorry, Nadine," Harry whispered, his voice tinged with anger and pain. "The more I learn about Lorcan, the more I...I want to fix everything. I wish I could promise you that I can beat him so that I
Draco sits on the sofa, then turns to lie down on his back, lifting one hand over his head and looking up at Harry. “Finish what you started, Potter,” he says, voice rough, watching with satisfaction as Harry’s eyes flash in recognition.
"I am, but it's okay. Because Draco doesn't just tolerate my jagged edges like other people have before, hoping they'll go away, he understands them. He knows he can't fix them, and he doesn't try, he just
, but for the first time he wonders if maybe they could be...
Draco laughs at the expression on Harry’s face as he rolls Draco onto his back and pins him down, claiming Draco’s lips with his own.
"It was still the wrong decision," I add, and his eyes soften further. "I should have told you. We could have worked it out...I just...I panicked. I loved you
The house elf beamed at him as he ushered him out the front door.
Even Ron had to admit, they looked sweet.
"This is incredible! Can I read it?"
Harry
"I know!" Harry batted the newspaper away after the tenth or eleventh beating. "I know it was stupid, Panse, alright! I'm sorry."
"I love you." Draco whispers the words that have been beating against his lips for weeks now, demanding to be said.
"Damn it, Malfoy!" Harry slams a hand down on the hard stone floor, and immediately looks guilty when Draco flinches. He carefully lowers his voice to a normal volume. "You
She wiped at her eyes and brandished the tiny spoon at him. "Don't test me, Draco. I'm armed with puréed peas."
Harry was glancing between Draco's decidedly pink face and Pansy's wicked grin.
“Please don’t fight the bad guys anymore, Dad,” Teddy had begged. “
"HARRY! The Chudley Cannons are on the wall, Harry!" Teddy's voice carried down the hallway.

“Thanks, Ginny,” he says.

been punishable in the past, but it also can initiate a second Challenge between the two surviving wolves, which is what the pack in 1915 did. I intend to forgo that and simply abdicate to Nadine."

"Draco?" Hermione was back. She settled onto the other end of the sofa with her drink, turning to face him and brushing a few loose curls out of her eyes.
"Fourteen," Draco breathed, "you were dealing with

"And Draco, too," Harry added.
“So, you two got married?” Lottie asks when they’re all settled around the table, indicating the shining gold rings on Draco and Harry’s hands.
Smiling contentedly, he opens his eyes and rolls onto his side to wait. He watches as Harry steps into the semi-darkness of their bedroom in only a clean pair of boxers, turning and carefully pulling the bathroom door shut behind him. He drops his glasses and wand on the bedside table, then starts to crawl under the covers, jumping slightly when Draco whispers affectionately, “You’re home late.”

been having a hard time with his situation, with how much time Draco spends with Harry and Teddy and the fact that Draco hasn't let him meet either of them yet, and Draco knows that going with him tonight to meet his family will do a lot to assuage his discomfort. So he sets his resolve and makes the decision to follow through. It’s just one Sunday dinner, it’ll be fine.
“Yeah, and that worked out
"...Both?"
"He's incredible, Ron," Harry breathed. "He's good for me, and I like being around him. He makes me laugh, he listens to me, he makes me feel...I don't know how to put it into words, I've never felt like this before. And he's so smart. He reads as much as Hermione does, did you know that? He creates new Spells and Potions, do you know how difficult that is? That's what he does in the Department of Mysteries, all day long. That new Fracture-Healing Spell that we're using in the field now? The one that repairs broken bones in an instant with no additional pain or adverse side effects? All him. And he
Draco comes back from lunch with a sandwich for Harry and a new romantic interest.
"I'd love that," Draco sighed, catching Harry's hand and bringing it to his lips. "There wasn't much time for sightseeing with the intensity of the course and the stress of exams, but when I did go out on weekends, it was lovely. I saw some beautiful sights,and the food was fantastic. I'd never had sushi or ramen before."
“We’d better be getting this one home,” Harry says to Narcissa, and he’s determinedly not looking at Draco when he turns around. “It’s getting late.”
“Yes,” Potter interrupts Draco’s slightly hysterical train of thought. “But I actually do mean it. In regards to the
Draco sneezes and summons a tissue from the bathroom to wipe at his nose. "Not for longer than a few minutes! That's what
Harry. He misses their conversations, and the casual way Harry touches him, and how easy it had been between them for so long. And part of Draco hates himself for mucking that up, even though all he’d done was speak a truth that Harry hadn’t wanted to hear. It all feels so unfair, and he wants to scream. But instead he continues his work carefully stocking potions ingredients and trying not to fret about seeing Harry later that night.
It had started so unexpectedly. One moment, he was drinking alone at the bar, enjoying the burn in his throat and the loud music of the club pounding around him. The next, a slightly tipsy and startlingly handsome Harry Potter had settled into the stool beside him and started talking to him. Draco had been too shocked to even try to come up with anything scathing or snarky to say.
Harry hesitates, looking nervous. "I... I'm really glad we're friends."
Ron walked over to the other Senior Aurors to confer on the rest of the case wrap-up with Head Auror Robards, who was extremely pleased about the whole situation.
"Agobabado," Rosie babbled.
He followed Hermione down the hall and nearly made it the hospital Floo before his body started reacting to the distance from Harry. He clenched his fists and fought down the reaction, ignoring the tightening of his chest and breathing slowly.
“Teddy is screaming for you and I can’t get him to calm down. Any chance you can come through and talk to him? I’m really sorry to ask, I’m desperate. I’ve tried everything I can think of.”
,” she says in a forceful whisper. “And you being in a relationship is keeping him from doing anything about it.”
"Yeah, I did. I think I..." Harry hesitates, biting his lower lip before trying again. "No,
He turned and stood, smiling nervously. "Hello Mrs. Malfoy. He doesn't know I'm here, actually. I wanted to, well, I wanted to ask you, if I, er..."
Harry smiled, liking the newcomer more and more the longer he interacted with him. "Harry, please. And how could you? You've been on the run. Besides, all it means is that you can join the party, if you want. Or we can have some cake sent to your rooms, if you like. I think you'd better come with me for a moment though, your niece will be furious with me if I don't introduce you to her first."
He pulls the door shut and groans. "How are your Memory Charms?" He asks his two friends, who are standing behind him in stunned silence.
look, to have
“Me too,” Draco smiles back, forcing down the feelings of guilt that immediately rise up to choke him.
Hermione opened the door with an overly-bright smile. "Draco, Harry! Hi! Come on in!"
in this pickup game, Potter,” Draco chuckles good-naturedly, offering a hand to pull him back onto his broom.
"Always the hero," Draco sniffled. "You're a noble git, you know that?"
"Sure did."
“Damn,” Harry takes off his jacket and sprawls comfortably on Draco’s sofa. “You’re more mature than I am.”
Her words stung, the truth ringing sharply in them, and he hung his head in shame.
She Apparated away, and Potter turned his attention back to Draco.
at me, Harry?"
"Oh!" She turned her attention back to her baby. "It's nothing. I'm fine."
The wound in Harry's shoulder still looked horrific, even after nearly three months of healing. The bite marks were deep, leaving large chunks of flesh missing. While the skin had been healed over, the healing appeared to only be skin deep. Beneath the jagged but unbroken, skin, the flesh was mottled red and purple, with dark purple tendrils stretching out in every direction from the wound, the longest and darkest of them running down from his right shoulder all the way to his heart.
And then lied to Draco about it?" Harry winced and nodded, and Pansy grabbed the nearest object from the coffee table—a rolled-up newspaper—and whacked him over the head with it. "You imbecile! What the fuck is
. You—"
"Yeah."
“It’s alright, Harry,” Draco leans forward to help, reaching out and picking up the offending locks and pushing them back for him.
"I'm sorry."
try to— I will do anything to be with you. Do you understand me? Anything. I'll do the stupid health check in front of the every nosy reporter who wants to attend. Hell, I'll strip naked and do a lewd dance for Rita if that'll convince her to leave us alone. But I'm
Harry's grin turned suggestive, and Draco smacked him lightly on the arm. "You know what I meant, you arrogant sod."
And Merlin, his arse really
Harry was breathing heavily, his voice strained. "That way." He inclined his head.
Ron appeared in the doorway, Auror robes slung over his arm. "We will."
“It’s just not...it wouldn’t work. Things are good like this, we can’t risk messing that up. I know that’s hard to understand. I’m sorry.”
"Hi," Hermione whispered, "how is he?"
“I got him! We just finished the interrogation,” Ron says quickly. “I really need to speak to Harry’s Healer.”
"Good!" Harry and Draco chimed in unison.
Harry blushes and runs a hand through his hair. “Er, right. Yeah. That was a long time ago.”
“I know,” she winks.
“Not surprising,” Draco grins. “I’m sure they were
“Anyway,” she continues, “Harry lost and we went to the tattoo parlor the next day. It turned out
too much."
Pansy lit up and immediately launched into a nonstop update on her love life. Several hours later she left with a cheery, "I'll see you soon, darlings!"
They settled onto the sofa after that, and Draco found himself lying with his head pressed against Harry's solid chest, his steady heartbeat in his ear. Harry lightly tugged on his braid.
Draco deflates. "I trust you, too," he says softly.
thinks—"
After settling the terms of the upcoming challenge, Harry sat on the floor and played trains with Thomas again, making ridiculous choo-choo sounds and blatantly ignoring the dark looks Lorcan was sending his way.
Harry slid forward and buried his face in Draco's shirt, catching him off guard. He adjusted quickly, wrapping an arm around him, the other hand reaching up to card through his dark hair.
Draco leaned down to kiss him again, slow and sweet.

“Your

"Of course. Things are a bit complicated with the pack at the moment, but when things settle down I'll invite all of you to visit. How does that sound?"
Harry clicks his tongue sympathetically. "I'm sorry. D'you want to go to bed?"
Harry sits up, yawning widely. "Sorry. You're just so comfortable."
Narcissa smiled at her son, her pride and joy, her baby—and the devastated look in his eyes made her want to smash something. Instead, she said calmly, "Tell me everything."
"What?"
Harry winced, then nodded, feeling extraordinarily pathetic.
“Did you make coffee?”
“I think that’s a conversation for another day,” Harry answers quickly. “But it

"Can Harry have visitors?" Draco asked abruptly as she reached for the door handle. "I know he has some friends waiting who would really like to see him."
"The nausea and fever are finally gone after this last transformation," she smiled. "So I'm feeling much better. I feel a bit strange, though. Stronger, and I can tell what people are feeling. For example, you're missing Draco right now, you lovesick pup." She elbowed him and he yelped.

He took the steps two at a time and poked his head into the master bedroom, which was empty. "Harry? Where are you?"
Curly stopped putting Wolfsbane in Potter's food and drink.

"Is there a reason you're watching the time so closely?"
"You didn't," Harry kissed his cheek. "I was attracted to you long before that."
“I’m an
Draco pulled her into a hug. "That would be great, thank you."
"I can't even get anyone to answer my owl about it," Draco continued, "Not the Ministry, not St. Mungo's... No one can see that I've changed, that I want to be doing something good with my life. It's been four bloody years since the war! I need to be doing
The Minister of Magic was under the Imperius Curse.
Bag in hand, he finds himself once again stuck. Draco knows he can't stand on his own, having already tried. He's pretty sure his ankle is broken, or at least badly sprained.
"Do you need anything? Dreamless Sleep? I think Hermione was going to make some cocoa after Thomas goes to bed? One of us could bring you some?"
, but now Draco can see no difference at all. And if it made him so special and important, why hide it?
“Yes, I was hoping you could tell me more about the effects of Mandrakes on a potion that needs….”
He grinned at her knowing smile. "Teddy is doing great, from the sound of things. He likes his classes and he's making loads of friends. I think he loves Hogwarts as much as I did."
"I'm sorry," Harry smiled, kissing him again before turning back to their friend. "How are Lewis and Marie?"
"Okay," Harry breathes, looking relieved. His eyes fall closed again, seemingly against his will. "Okay."
"A werewolf?"
"Because I was thinking...getting married outside might be nice."
This time, Brandon doesn’t hesitate, scrambling for the door and slamming it behind himself.
how to get onto the platform.”
"So you've told me" Draco chuckles. "I'm starting to think you only befriended me for the free cuddles and hair petting."
"You're impossible," he says when he comes back to fetch him a few minutes later, and Draco wraps himself around him with a grip like Devil's Snare.
“In—in—

think I would have ever cheated on you? Draco, I would never do that!"
Harry nodded. "We can talk in the Library."
Draco stood abruptly and held out a hand to Weasley, immediately Apparating them both to Wolf's Hollow.
"I know you're already reading one of the books I borrowed, but Wolf's Hollow has a library—it's amazing. Tons of books, all different sizes and shapes, all handwritten by werewolves through the ages—one day I'm going to take you to see it. But for now..." He held the books out to her. "Kasper chose these two specifically for you to borrow. He said they'd be beneficial for your work at the Ministry"
Draco stares at him for a full ten seconds before he bursts out laughing. He laughs until he can’t breath. He leans against Harry’s side, his whole body shaking. Harry looks extremely pleased with himself as he chuckles softly along with him.
"My favorite," Draco smiled, reaching out to brush Harry's hair off his forehead. "If you don't mind?"
Harry shifted slightly behind him and buried his nose in the crook of Draco's neck, breathing in deeply.
“Yeah, spent too long bent over a boiling cauldron today.”
He does, and when he comes back, Harry is sitting on the edge of the sofa and he seems to be on the verge of tears.
Harry goes very still beside him, and Draco abruptly remembers the look on Harry's face as the walked past the cupboard, horror flooding through him as he makes the connection. He gasps softly, eyes going wide as Harry turns to look at him.
"Not when—" Harry sucked in a breath as Draco tugged his jeans and boxers down and tossed them aside, freeing his now fully-erect cock, "not when it's you."
She shook her head, biting the inside of her cheek. "No. But I wonder if werewolves have written books about it for themselves. And where you would find such a book if they had..." Hermione smiled brightly. "I'll see what I can find out. Maybe someone at work will know. I'll ask around."
•••••
An hour later, Draco was back, carrying a small case with a few potions from his personal store: Anti-Nausea, Fever-Reduction, and Pain-Reliever. None of them would fix the underlying issue causing Harry to feel sick, whatever it was, but they could lessen the symptoms for a while.
"No, you don't," Harry responded quickly. "It's not— Skeeter, she—"
She walks away and it barely registers because Draco is standing right in front of me now, his eyes traveling slowly over my chest and arms. When he looks into my eyes, I cross my arms self-consciously over my bare skin and force myself to speak.
now. Draco deserves much better than me. This version of me."
"I—" Harry doesn't seem to have words, he just pulls Draco into a crushing hug, holding him for a very long time.
"I'd have said yes."
Curly had been unable to keep himself from imagining his Alicia at home, and how he would feel if she
"Right. So the hospital Floo first, then?"
"I can't!"
"Hi," Draco greeted him with a kiss, "it's nice to see you cooking again. Where's Jenkins?"
have known that?"
"Don't ever do that again."
"No!" Draco screamed. He'd been stripped of his wand, and was being physically restrained between two Aurors.
“I hope this isn’t too forward,” the man asks, “but would you like to go get coffee sometime? Or tea, maybe? If you’re...I mean, I hope I haven’t misjudged here, if you’re...I mean like a date, not as friends. If you’re interested.”
A few minutes later, Ron, Hermione, Nadine, and Thomas entered the room.
That last bit is actually true. Marc has about as much personality as a flobberworm, but he’s reasonably good-looking, and nice, and he’s
"I know," she whispered, her eyes sympathetic. "Harry
"Yes, Harry, I'm really here."
When Draco returned a moment later, Harry downed the vial of potion immediately.
“Can I meet him?”
“I know,” Dudley’s eyes are on his feet, the tips of his ears a bright red.
Harry shakes his head, squeezing Draco’s hand again. “I won’t.”
“Yeah,” Draco answers, wide-eyed and horrified. “See you.”
Harry tips his head to one side, considering. “You know, since I’ve been here I’ve actually been thinking about becoming a Healer. There’s a program here at St. Mungo’s. It’ll take a few years, but I can be in class while Teddy is at school, and I have more than enough funds to live off of while I finish the program…”
“Why?”
"Weirder than Harry cheering for his
"Oh, I intend to earn an 'Outstanding,' tonight," Harry snickers, shamelessly groping Draco's arse. "Gorgeous boyfriend of mine, who got straight O's on his N.E.W.T.s."
“Draco.
Harry went to Nadine first, and she swept him into a hug. "Draco told us what happened. I'm so sorry, Harry, are you alright?"
. Unfamiliar and familiar, all at once.
“I wish you well.” Paul drops a couple of Sickles on the table to pay for his half of the meal, brushing a hand over Draco’s shoulder as he leaves.
Harry had lazily stretched his arms above his head and kissed Draco's shoulder. "Alright, then."
“‘M alright now,” Harry leans into his touch as Draco trails his fingers over a stubbled cheek and along his jaw.
Harry shakes his head to clear it and takes his bag from Draco with a smile and another kiss. "Thanks. Good luck on your Arithmancy exam this afternoon."
Harry hit his dirty laundry on the floor with a cleaning charm, then tugged on the worn jeans and t-shirt from the day before.
Draco inclined his head at the pot on the stove.
Draco loved Harry's bedroom. He didn't know what it had looked like before, but Harry had transformed the Master Bedroom of the old house into a place that was simultaneously cozy and bright. The walls were a soft, cream color. The floors throughout the house were all the original hardwood, but restored and stained a deep, chocolate brown.
“We’ll be in the kitchen if you need us,” Harry says kindly, and they close the door behind themselves.
“Or maybe he
Harry grinned. "And I love you for it, but it's better that you didn't."
"There is an obvious solution to some of your problems, you know."
"I don't want power. I never have, you know that." He inclined his head toward Draco. "Everything I need is right here. I just want to get married and live a quiet life with Draco. I don't want or need anything else."
Harry smiled back at her. "Yeah. I haven't seen Teddy since I turned. I miss him."
“Harryyyyy,” Ginny drops herself right into her ex-boyfriend’s lap, startling Marc from his nonstop droning. “I’m bored. Let's play a pickup match. Oliver and Ron can play Keeper. George, Angelina, Dean, Fleur, Bill, Charlie and I will be Chasers. You and Draco can both play Seeker. Mum’s insisting we play without Bludgers for
“Auror raid,” Harry repeats, “I guess I should be glad they all missed my face. Still just have the one, there.” His laugh is self-deprecating, and Draco absolutely hates it.
“Can’t,” Harry yawns. “I have an essay due in the morning and I’m still working on the outline,” he gestures at the notes. “I’ll go make some coffee and get back to it.”
He moans when Harry breaks the kiss to nip at his jaw, his mouth moving along his throat. “
"Let's get you all in some rooms to rest and I'll order for some food to be sent for all of you, alright?" Nadine said kindly. "Harry, you should get back to your party."
Harry shoved at him, and got a half-hearted shove in return. "You say that jokingly, but I know that this past year hasn't been easy on you and Hermione."
Harry gave her a weak smile. "Thanks."
•••••
"Your arse is a thing of beauty, did you know?" Harry ran a hand over Draco's backside, then pulled a quilt off the back of the sofa and draped it over them both, casting a wandless Cleaning Charm that tingled when it ran over Draco's bare skin. He settled on top of him and Harry set a hand on his back, absently tracing his fingers over it.
"What
to be fat!" Harry protests, laughing and looking a bit more like himself for a moment.
She slowly opened her eyes. "Harry? What—What happened?" She looked around. "How am I out here?"
"Do you have any idea how traumatic that was? It took months for him to fully recover afterward, no matter the brave face he put on so no one would know. The real Moody never would have done something like that—It was evil and cruel, not funny."
Harry slides his free hand between the sofa and Draco’s back and then down to grip his arse, pulling him tightly against him as he continues to ravage Draco’s mouth, and everything is perfect and Draco never wants the moment to end—
“Don’t expect me to do all the work next time,” Draco mutters as he cuddles closer.
After a long moment, Draco's shock started to abate. He stood abruptly and Apparated to the Granger-Weasleys living room.
“Paul seems nice,” Harry comments, stretching out to lie across Draco’s lap, yawning widely.
"I most certainly do
do you want me, love?" He drawled seductively, running a hand down Harry's spine and back up to his neck.

My eyes fall on the side of his neck again, where that first tattoo used to be.
"Couldn't sleep either?" Ron asked, running a tired hand over his face.
Potter frowned. "I'm a Junior Auror just like the others in my class. It's my job." He turned to the young woman beside him. "You can head back, Hyatt, I've got this one."
Harry steps into the other room to Apparate.
Draco nodded, shuddering, as Harry let out another tortured scream.
•••••
An hour later, Draco is staring down at a sleeping Harry Potter, but he’s so pale he barely looks like himself.
"I meant to
Harry grinned and tugged him closer. "A precautionary measure. If anyone is thinking about trying anything, hopefully that will give them pause."
She smiled softly. "No. And I think— I think you might be the only person who can get through to him right now, Draco."
“Leaving him? Getting divorced?” Her eyes brim with tears. “I don’t know.”
“Fine,” Brandon answers in a voice that tells Draco it’s anything
Harry looks over at him, a little startled. “Oh, yeah, I guess so.”
Harry grinned and shrugged. "If he's happy, I'm happy."
“Yes, it’s almost ready. I won’t bore you with the details, I know you don’t care.”
Harry carefully picked up his guitar and moved it to the ground. He sat in the chair and pulled Draco in front of him, between his legs, his back leaning against Harry's chest, Harry's arms wrapped around his waist.
She gave him a watery smile when he released her, and she wiped at her eyes with her fingers. "You're a good Alpha, Harry. I—I hope you win."
“Just friends, my arse,” he fumes, pulling on his shirt and quickly buttoning up the buttons. “I’m such an idiot.”
He's ashamed to remember it. He'd blathered on and on about going to Ginny and Luna's party while Harry got quieter and quieter, his back going rigid, his shoulders tense.
"Well, not everything. We left, of course. But we heard enough."
The two men flinched and turned away at Draco's scathing look, but said nothing. Draco turned his attention back to Harry, who was clinging to him and slowly becoming more coherent as the bond settled between them.
Harry ignored him and started tucking his book selections into a large tote bag that Kasper had loaned him.
There was the soft clink of metal-on-metal as a key turned in a lock, and Kasper emerged from his cell wearing a thick bathrobe.
"Wait just one second. You can't just—"
"But tonight we're celebrating our wedding, and that's what matters. Nadine and the others can handle it. No more distractions."
Draco really looked at him, then. Saw the circles under his eyes, and the haunted look in them, the hunched shoulders and pinched mouth that matched his own. "No, I imagine not."
like fucking Lockhart to you? I won’t. Give it to me.”
"That sounds acceptable," Draco grins wickedly, "Although, I won't be satisfied with anything less than an 'Exceeds Expectations.'"

"Good morning, sunshine!" Pansy laughs.

on the last turn before they finally stop and Draco lands sprawled on top of him. Harry is still laughing, although Draco’s pretty sure the tears leaking out of his eyes are from pain.
Christine Gordon returned the next day to speak with Harry and Draco, looking nervous. She wrung her hands as she spoke. "I'm afraid... One of the other Healers filed a report yesterday, and it made its way to the DMLE. An Auror named McDougal wants a detailed report from me about your injuries and how I think they were sustained. He also wants to speak with you, but I told him you weren't well enough for visitors yet."
He had a presence about him, especially at full strength just now, that made you
glasses? Or ask her to research a spell to fix your eyesight permanently? I’m sure they exist.”
Harry chuckled, unbuttoning Draco's shirt for him and tossing it over the back of his chair. Draco's trousers joined it a moment later, their owner still leaning heavily against Harry for support.
Harry took in his friendly, relaxed demeanor, and the pleasant expression on his face. "Thank you for coming."
"I shouldn't have done that, Harry. I didn't realize..."
Harry smiles into the kiss. "I've been off the market since the first time we kissed, Draco, over five years ago. I just haven't done a good enough job of showing it, apparently. But I will, starting now."
"Very."
" She whispered.
Harry had come home sometime in the early hours of the morning. Draco had awoken in his arms as he carried him to bed.
“Sir? Shall I…?”
He'd taught himself to play guitar two years ago, and had a surprisingly nice voice. Occasionally, if Draco was lucky, he could convince him to play something for him.
"Up here!"
"Well, no time like the present, then. Right?" Ron said cheerfully.
Harry smiled and shook his head. "I'm fine, thanks."
“Mhm.”
"I...what,
Harry sighs. “Shit. I really wanted to be wrong. I can stay here with Teddy while you go hex his face off. Or his balls. I mean, hex whatever you want, I don’t want to limit you.”
Potter turns his head to look at him, eyes widening in warning. Of course he doesn’t want Teddy to know about his

good timing!"
"Not today. Not until you're feeling better. C'mon, let's get you out of your school robes."
"I'm cold!"
"Oh! Yes, I'm fine!" A tearful voice responded immediately. "You can come in, Harry."
“I love you,” Draco says, and my brain stops working. My stomach lurches uncomfortably. “I’m still in love with you. I never
Harry kisses him again as they fumble at trousers and shirts and shoes and socks until they're down to their boxers, hands roving over previously unexplored bare skin.
. No one deserves this. Not you. Not anyone."
"I'm going to steal you one day," Draco cooed at Louis, gently stroking his fingers over the tiny owl's head while he hopped on his perch. Louis leaned into the touch and let out a happy little hoot.
"It doesn't matter," Harry sighed. "Let's talk about something else."
"You're just upset that he didn't swoon at the sight of you like you thought he would," Mathias scoffed.
Blushing, Draco picked up the tray of food and offered it to him, and Harry sat up to take it.
Harry feigned confusion. "Did I? I don't remember saying anything like that, and it certainly doesn't sound like me. I enjoy being the favorite
"Grandma says you and Harry are getting married."
Luna, who is the unofficial commentator of the games, let them know the Owls were still up, but only by twenty points.
"Does...I mean, who else knows?"
Anyone who might not have noticed the interaction before was certainly paying attention now, and Harry's stomach turned uncomfortably. Many of the onlookers were hostile, a few people had pity in their eyes, which was even worse somehow, and the rest were watching with interest, as if it were an exciting show.
"I could have hurt you. I could have, oh fuck Draco, I could have
And the upstairs neighbor complained about the noise the next day. Again.
"Yes! I would like that very much."
"I thought he just meant Ginny and everyone, but I wondered why...well, I would have thought, of all people, he'd listen to
“I don’t underst—”
Harry's words rattle around in his head for days, his guileless expression and the tremor in his voice when he'd forced himself, in his semi-coherent state, to ask, '
"What about Remus and Sirius? Or Remus and Tonks? They never saw things that way, and neither did you when it was them. Why is this different?" The soft response from his friend made him want to break down.
"How can I help you?"
Draco desperately wants to kiss him. Harry is, as usual, completely oblivious, still chattering on.
"Nothing magical, I'm afraid. There are a few Muggle remedies that can help, though. Cool rag on the forehead should feel nice, if nothing else. Could try some hot ginger tea as well. Gracie makes a mean cuppa when any of us are sick."
There was only one thing to do. Ron raised his wand and called out, "
“Probably,” Harry chuckles. “Now that the food’s ordered, I’d better go shower, too. You okay alone down here for a few minutes? I’m sure Teddy will be down soon.”
Ron and Draco, the appointed captains since this whole arrangement had been their idea in the first place, shake hands.
Draco gasps sharply and Harry, who has been watching the interaction passively up to this point, is on his feet with his wand in his hand in a flash. He’s shaking with fury as he asks in a low voice. “
...bloody evil fucking
"Thanks, 'Mione."
"I understand." Harry smiles kindly, and Draco feels a strange fluttering sensation in his stomach.
Draco crawled under the covers to slide up against him. "I love you, too. Rest now, sweet."
Harry nods.
“Hello,” Draco bites his lip over a smile as Harry opens his eyes and his expression brightens at the sight of him.
"I just...It's not what you think. I didn't sabotage my happiness with him, Harry. I just...I
Harry likes to say Draco’s name when he comes, Draco is learning, the two syllables rolling off his tongue in a rough voice as he lets himself go, and it’s the most beautiful thing Draco has ever heard. He swallows around him, and Harry curses at the ceiling, one hand tangled in the sheets, the other in his hair, clenching, then letting go to stroke through it as he comes back down.
moan, loudly, when Draco took him in his mouth as far as he could, until the head hit the back of his throat, swallowing around him.
getting, despite trying to live his life as much out of the spotlight as he possibly can for the past several years.
“I missed you,” I whisper, tracing one of the scars that slashes across his chest, and he clenches his eyes shut, a tear slipping out and trailing down his cheek. I wipe it away with a thumb and press a kiss to his cheek.
Draco turned around to see Potter staring at the wooden box that had held the potion vials, still sitting on the table where he'd left it. The
Harry looks around at the piles of boxes that fill the small but clean flat, heart so full he fears it might burst.
"Is it to do with the mysterious person you were seeing, who subsequently broke your heart?"
"Okay."
"She's exhausting," Harry yawned, and Draco laughed.
Harry laughed again, then leaned forward to kiss him. "If being a dick was a punishable offense, I'd lock him up this very second. Unfortunately, it's not."
They're both a few years younger than him and Harry, both extremely handsome, and both laughing
"See you tomorrow?" Draco asked helplessly as his best friend hauled him away.
Kasper put a hand on Harry's arm. "I'm not sure that was such a good idea, Harry."
Draco nodded. "That's fine, I can go—"
"—just saying. He tries to hide it, but he hasn't been himself lately. I feel bad for him. That's all."
Draco smiled and lightly touched Harry's burning forehead. "You're welcome. I'm going to run home and get a couple of potions that might help, okay?"
Harry shook his head. "We haven't seen him since you left together the night before last."
The babble of pleasant, cheerful voices is what has woken him, and he slowly opens his eyes to find himself surrounded by friends who are perched on nearby chairs, or in Ginny and Luna's case, the rug on ground.
," Draco retorted breathlessly, fingers sliding into Harry's hair of their own accord.
Draco turned to look at Harry, who was clearly very pleased with himself.
Harry wrapped his arms around him and kissed his forehead, already drifting off again himself.
"It was a cover story. To 'allow me to keep my dignity, out of respect for my years of service,'" Harry choked out.
The moment they stumble through the Floo, Draco is on him. Mouthing at Harry's jaw and tugging at the hem of his shirt.
"—at which time, the Alpha will determine how to proceed. Draco, go with them. If he struggles, I authorize you to Stun him."
you. You look like you're about to pass out, too. The name's Draco, you said?"
"Time for bed!" Hermione announced, and Thomas groaned.
•••••
Harry was quick with a smile, quick to laugh at Draco's jokes. Harry listened to him when he spoke, and seemed to genuinely care what he had to say, which was something Draco hadn't experienced in a very long time. As their friendship developed, he began to tease Draco back, and his sarcastic comments and quick wit made Draco laugh, too. He was easygoing, and Merlin help Draco, being around him was
“I don't know! Like I said, because you acted so strange about it! And we’ve really only done it a few times. It’s not, like,
They scream each time Ginny makes an impressive pass, or manages to get the Quaffle past the Cannon’s Keeper, fully aware that their voices will be hoarse in the morning.
Draco gives him a scrutinizing look, and Harry laughs. “I am, I promise. It was horrible being back there, and I had to contact my Mind Healer for the first time in years to work through it a bit, and well, I'm still meeting with her, but—”
"Yeah, your version of the event that caused a neighbor to call us to investigate. Do you, er, know? What might have startled them?"
, but I already knew that." She smiled at him, reaching out and brushing his hair off of his forehead affectionately. "I like you two together."
"I...
Harry sighs and walks back, confident persona shattered, reaching out for the strap. "Thanks."
"I stopped it before it could go to far."
"Oh," Potter breathed. "That's...big."
"Of course, darling," Nadine answered with a smile before turning to Harry and Draco, "you boys ready to try the best raspberries you've ever tasted?"
Harry followed the elf through the house until they arrived at a beautiful room. Beside a large window, sat a small table and two chairs. Across from them sat a large sofa. On another wall was an ornate fireplace. The sun was setting outside, giving the room a warm glow.
Ron groaned and slid down the sofa, taking an unnecessarily large swig of Firewhisky.
Healer Gordon smiled. "Of course. I'll be right back." She exited the room to quickly go check on another patient, closing the door behind her.
"We can, and we have. There are threats to wizardkind that aren't being dealt with properly, and McDougal here has been promoted to make sure these issues are taken care of. Minister Kingsley already signed off on it."
"I'll be up in a moment, okay?"
“You mean Potter and Malfoy,” Harry says, catching on.

enjoyed making his classmates laugh, and it hadn't been mean-spirited or unkind either, just fun and silly in a way he'd rarely allowed himself to be as a teenager.
Draco follows him up the stairs and watches gratefully from the doorway as Harry calms Teddy down, climbing onto his bed and pulling him into his arms. He rocks him gently while stroking his turquoise hair until his screams calm to hiccupping sobs, then silent tears, then stop altogether.
"At the kitchen table?" Draco asked, grinning.

, Teddy."
"I will, alright? Just don't rush me." Draco puts his hands up defensively. "This is still nerve-wracking! He still might not—"
"I know, sweetheart. I put Numbing and Stasis Charms on it, but we need to get you to a Healer soon. We wanted to make sure you were awake and stable before trying to Apparate."
"Yes, I do. You're a stupid, selfish, boorish arsehole who doesn't give a

"I nearly blew up the lab today. I vanished the potion just in time. That's why I'm up here going over the theory. I'm not sure exactly where I went wrong, but I'll figure it out."
...it doesn't change how you feel about him?"
“I’m interested,” Draco blurts, blushing immediately, “in going for coffee with you. As a date, not as friends.”
I don't

The wolf sat up, tried to shift positions on the bed, and whined loudly when he put a small amount of pressure on his left paw again.
His smile is incredibly bright as he glances over and Draco's heart leaps at the sight of it—green eyes sparkling at him behind his glasses as he lifts his goblet to his lips again, and Draco is so in love with him it physically hurts.
Draco looks relieved, then thoughtful. "We're both a sweaty mess from the game. Come take a shower with me, and I'll suck you off in there after we get washed up."
“I did something bad,” Harry murmurs after downing the potion.
"Yeah, er, is your husband home?"
"Draco's really good at telling me when I'm being an idiot," Harry laughed, rolling a train across the floor to Thomas. "I never stood a chance at resisting his charm."
Draco brought him off that way a few minutes later, relishing the look on Harry's face as he released down his throat, and the softness in his eyes when Harry sank to his knees to kiss him, cradling his face in his hands.
well, it’s bloody gorgeous—“
A smile played at the corner of Draco's lips as he responded, "Good. Now get back to kissing me."
"But you're all better now?"
“No, you stay with Harry. He’ll want to see you when he wakes up. I’ll go tell Hermione, and we’ll get Teddy and take him to the Burrow with our kids, and then we’ll come back.”
Harry winced. "You didn't."
They walked into the kitchen hand-in-hand, and Draco watched in awe as his boyfriend suddenly seemed right in his element, speaking amiably with the other werewolves that had unexpectedly become his charges.
Draco startles and turns. Ginny Weasley has come in as well and is standing beside him, watching him curiously.
"You're not an idiot," Hermione responds calmly, "but you can't pretend that Draco is the same as he was in school. You two would never have worked as a couple if you
"Do you
Draco looked up when the door creaked open and Hermione slipped inside, closing it softly behind her.
Harry looked at Draco for support, hands coming up to protect himself, but Draco simply shrugged and sipped his drink. "Don't look at me, I'm with her."
"Your concern for your boyfriend is admirable, Mr. Potter, but I'm afraid there's nothing more I can do. Give him the Pain-Relief Potion for his headache, no more than one vial every six hours, it might help a little bit, but the typical flu remedies just won't work. I'm sorry."
Potter gives Teddy one more hug before he leaves, giving Draco a tentative smile before walking away.
"And his Patronus has changed."
She nodded. "Good. Because I would be furious with him if he allowed you to put yourself in danger, but it seems we're of the same mind. So. Let's talk about something else. Tell me about your work. You said you've been getting a steady stream of orders recently?"
“He hasn’t seen me in a few weeks,” Potter shrugs. “I haven’t been the one taking him to school and making him go to bed and whatever else he doesn’t want to do. Listen, I found this Children’s Mind Healer last month. She was a huge help the last two weeks he was with me. I can owl you her information when I get home, if you like. That’s the other thing I wanted to tell you, but you wouldn’t let me.”
"'Course, love."
A thought struck Harry, and he looked into her face again.
“I DON’T WANT YOU!” Teddy screams, so loudly that Draco’s ears ring. “I WANT HARRY! I WANT MY OTHER DAD! I WANT
I reach out and touch his cheek, and I'm surprised again when he leans into it instead of shoving me away. I'd deserve it if he did.
sorry.”
"Harry, do you really need to—?"
"No."
“Absolutely. But we don’t have to wait until then to see each other again, yeah?”
"I'm glad. I'm nervous to send Thomas next year."
Harry closes his eyes and shakes his head slowly. “It’s not. I was acting like a complete arse, I’m sorry.”
Thank you, Harry! I'll read them and return them as quickly as possible."
We haven't even been on a date, and you would...with
Draco blinks at him. “That’s...a brilliant idea. You don’t mind? We usually spend Saturdays together when Teddy is with Harry.”
Harry panics and turns away, a hand on the door handle. "Sorry, I don't—I shouldn't have asked. Things have been so good between us, and now I've mucked it all up, haven't I? Fuck, Draco, I'm an
“Draco, this isn’t...I mean, my ex-husband leaving me for my best friend from Hogwarts after being married for ten years, now
Sometimes, Draco would swear Harry should have been in Slytherin.
"I was too hot and now I'm freezing! What the fuck is happening? I'm
Scrabbling away from the lifeless body, he leaned against a nearby tree trunk and tipped his head back, gazing at the bright full moon peeking out from between the branches.
He’s startled from his melancholy thoughts when the Floo rings. He’s not too surprised to see Harry when he answers, but the serious expression on his face makes him a little nervous.
"—still getting a final count, but it's over thirty-five this month. Jeffords got ten all on his own." McDougal sounded even smugger than normal, if that was even possible.
“I’ve wanted you like that, too,” Draco chokes out, and Harry closes his eyes, a pained expression crossing his features. “I’ve wanted—“
"Sorry," Harry groaned when he was done. "That was gross. You didn't need to—"
"Oh! Not so far, love," Harry groaned, tossing his head back and tangling his fingers in Draco's hair, trying to pull him back a bit. "Don't—don't hurt yourself—"
He looked at the box of neatly packaged vials, one for each week of the next three months. And the note resting on top:
The other guard, George, Harry thought was his name, regarded him curiously. His hand was on his holster, but he didn't draw his wand.
"Absolutely."
"Missed you."
Potter nods thoughtfully. “That’s a great idea, Malfoy.”
"Master Harry is crying."
Bound and forced to his knees, Harry bared his teeth at his captors as McDougal presented him to his former boss, Gawain Robards.
He smiled and nodded.
“I knew it!” He bursts into the room, startling them both. “I knew you were doing this—you—you
Draco climbed off the bed to take her hand, running a thumb over her knuckles as she looked tearfully up at him. "Hey, hey. It's okay. We'll figure this out. I'll come with you. What do you want to do?"
Dudley sets the boxes down, and Draco gets his first look at Harry’s cousin. The man is enormous, but well-built, as if he spends a fair amount of time at the gym. His blonde hair is smooth and starting to thin on top, his blue eyes intent on his cousin. He’s watching Harry nervously, waiting for him to ruin whatever story he and his parents have concocted to keep his wife from running away screaming in revulsion. But Harry doesn’t, he just stands and holds his hand out for his cousin to shake.
"Grandma!" Teddy came down the stairs two at a time, with Harry following at a much slower pace. "Grandma! My room is awesome! Harry made it so cool! It has toys, and Quidditch posters, and a Chudley Cannons bedspread!"
Christine bit her lip over a smile, focusing on her Diagnostic Spells as Harry leaned over to kiss Draco squarely on the mouth.
"Oh."
Teddy shrugs at him. “I wouldn’t know anything about that.”
Harry laughed. "It's okay, Hermione. I know how I look. At this point, I'm just happy to be alive. And I
Draco choked out a sound that's somewhere between a laugh and a sob. "But, Harry—"
Harry had thought remaining calm and ignoring his barbs would frustrate the other werewolf far more than lashing out in return, and he was right.
"Ah. Remind me to apply that again before I leave. Otherwise you'll be hit with some pretty excruciating pain in about, oh, six hours."
Hermione's eyes widened. The Healer would be twice-dead now, if looks could kill. The woman visibly recoiled when Draco's savage glare was directed at her a second time.
now, isn't he? Does he have her powers of persuasion, too? Is that how he made it into your bed? Into your
anything about it, you don't tell them to fuck off or—"
"Yeah, every day for about two weeks."
"I don't know how to explain it," Harry sighs, "I just do. You don't have to say it back though, it's okay if you don't—"
"Hi. My name is Harry Potter. Is Mrs. Malfoy in? I was hoping to speak with her."
Harry turned around to pull the roast chicken out of the oven and set the pan on the table. "It's the middle of the night in Japan, so I thought you'd still be asleep, for a while longer, at least—"
"I know I was late, darling, but yes, I
"The right choice? Not at all. But I hope it was. I really need to get over there, though, or I'll be late again. Leaving Draco was...hard."
"Good luck with that," Harry responded sharply. "Out."
"Would Harry lie to everyone? Would he lie to
"Alright, Harry! See you later!"
"Beauty takes
Harry blushed again. "You're pretty great yourself," he deflected.
She shook her head, speaking gently. "He'd have to be out of his mind not to want you."
When he woke, he managed to eat some of the dinner Jenkins provided and the color had come back to his face.
"Why not just let your henchmen do the dirty work, Malfoy?"
With a strangled sob, Draco rushed to his side. He carefully turned him over and began to cry in relief when he saw his chest rise and fall on its own.
Harry. Sleeping on his back. One arm tucked behind his head, the other thrown out to the side, fingers dangling off the edge of the mattress. He'd kicked the sheet down off of him, overheated in the sweltering summer air, leaving him exposed but for his Slytherin-green boxers. They suit him—match his eyes, Draco thought with a smile.
“I had to, Gin,” I mutter, and the pitying look in her eyes is back.
She sobers immediately, standing up and setting a gentle hand on his arm. “I’m sorry. I just don’t understand, darling. After all this time,
Harry gripped the edge of the counter tightly as Draco tugged his boxers down and took his rapidly-filling cock in hand. He stroked him slowly, pressing kisses to the head and teasing little licks along the shaft before abruptly taking as much as he could in his mouth, hollowing his cheeks, and sucking. Harry's deep groan was gratifying, and Draco looked up to see his white knuckles clutching onto the edge of the counter, his eyes fluttering closed and his mouth dropping open in a silent scream.

Harry laughed easily, and he was a good listener. He made Draco feel like anything and everything he had to say was important, and he found himself unexpectedly comfortable talking to Harry.
treated in his home, because of what you and your parents were…”
"Hurry back though. You still owe me a dance tonight." Ron winks at her, and Hermione gives him a besotted smile before she turns to follow their friend.
Draco fought to keep his expression neutral.
Harry feigned a loud gasp. "Since when?"
," Draco sighed.
man. Let's go to bed." Harry pushed at his chest, and Draco finally hauled himself up, pulling Harry after him.
Harry, what are you talking about?"
"Oh, you're doing it Draco, absolutely," she said seriously, "I hate this old house, you know that. If you can turn it into a place full of life, a place that can help people, you have my full support."
Draco cautiously moved closer, his eyes locked on Harry's.
"Merlin, is
"So he's been through two transformations?"

All of Draco's emotions came bubbling to the surface, his love for Harry, his jealousy, his frustration, his desire— it was all suddenly too much to contain.
Kingsley looked up from his desk and smiled vapidly. "Auror Weasley," he said in his deep, velvety voice, "what a pleasant surprise."
How is this supposed to work, exactly?"

"Ugh. Fine."
Harry woke abruptly and jolted upright, irrational fear still flooding through him. He was breathing hard, his wand already in his hand before he became aware of a tight grip on his wrist and a panicked voice speaking his name. He opened his eyes and his surroundings came into focus.
This mangy grey wolf wanted to hurt him, to make him submit, and then take his life.
of his Apparation startles everyone as Ron Weasley finally arrives, slightly short of breath.
"Come along, darling. It's all arranged for with your mother. Give Harry one more kiss and let's go."
•••••
He continued to watch him as they ate, all seated around a large rectangular table, watching Harry gesticulate wildly as he talked animatedly with Mathias about a recent professional Quidditch game they'd both caught on the radio. It was another quirk that he loved—when Harry was excited, or emotional in any way, he talked with his hands.
I force the word out.
“Oh?” Harry looks stunned.
"Harry?" A tentative voice interrupted.
“Dud’s already gone,” she says, accepting yet another cup of tea. “But that was really good. I think...Violet and I are going to go home. Tonight.”
"It's quite alright, Harry."
"Hermione!" Molly answered after a few long seconds. "Is everything alright?"
Harry smiled weakly back. "You're being extra bossy today."
"And you look
Draco popped back up onto his elbow, looking scandalized. "Did you just...Han Sodo me?"
