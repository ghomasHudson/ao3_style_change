"You betted that I liked him?" Harry accusingly asked.
When the music played, Harry assumed he'd be taking the first role as the other boy wasn't even looking at the lyrics- maybe this was a song he already knew. "
They laughed afterwards, in the car. Fred managed to drive them above the clouds and George hit the dashboard in celebration. “We knew something was up when you didn’t owl back.” Ron commented first, still grinning like a Cheshire cat, “I even got an owl from Malfoy, telling me you haven’t sent him a letter.”
This time, the flower Harry chose was a white tulip. "Tulips- as an umbrella term- mean passion, which the receiver can interpret in any way or the giver can explain. The colour of the tulip doesn't differ the meaning unless the giver tells it so." Abbott read aloud, but Draco stared at the letter mainly. It had to be the longest one yet.
"Harry? Harry! You need to get up Harry, it'll be ok." Draco whispered and Harry gulped, but walked anyway.
"Malfoy! What did you do- woah!" Ron trailed off at the end as he hit the barrier and fell back with a thud on the floor.
waist.
"we are to have the honour of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months, an event which has not been held for over a century. It is my very great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year,"
It was all over the Muggle Newspapers that a new and mysterious billionaire has been giving millions to charities out of the blue. There were theories (he stole all the money, he's an angel sent by God- Draco laughed hard at that one), but none told the truth quite so well as the Quibbler.
Gently, Fred lowered the car to the ground and parked it back in the same spot it was in. “Can’t believe we got away with it.” Fred said, unpacking Harry’s stuff from the back.
"I reiterate: you complete twat." Blaise smiled at him innocently, "Just go after him. He wants you; you want him. Just- kiss and make up!" Whined the Italian, "Him being jealous over She-weasel and that Chang girl who was obviously screwing Cedric behind you back was torture! You don't know how many he smoked, and the amount he cried on my shoulder being so utterly delusional."
The faint noises of the Aurors and the Healers were nothing more than background noise. The man he was holding was captivating every look, every sound of his attention.
The House-elf laughed, "You eat a salad a day, now you say you're hungry."
"Please, listen-"
The night sky is why people wished they could fly. Supinely, it was the most pulchritudinous of art, alive with the rawest of energy, a symphony of the eyes; promising life within the darkness, a warmness stroking from the cold. Giants of the earth, the snow-covered trees branched with multiple arms and given up shaking off the substance as they knew more would eventually cascade onto their leaves (who even knew if the trees were green underneath the suffocating weather?).
I thought my heart was too ruthless to break. That you could start a fire for heaven’s sake and I would follow you through it! That we won our own war because we found love! That to us we were saints, to the rest of the world we were sinners, but if we were sinners it felt like heaven to me.
But then he went up the stairs- no photos on the wall. When Harry and Draco moved into their own home, Draco captured photos and put them up. There was one of Harry kissing a smiling Draco on the cheek. Another with Harry soaked in water and the image panned so you could see Draco holding a hose pipe. But they weren't there too...
Hannah said she wanted to work at an Orphanage for abandoned little witches and wizards, because she knew someone who was orphaned because of the war and took them in.
“She’s
No answer.
"You're learning French, Monsieur Potter?" He smiled at Harry, "Thank you, it's really... warming." Draco said tenderly, planting another kiss to Harry's cheek. Before Harry could even talk, Draco was clinging tightly to his arm. "They're here! They're here!" He repeated until McGonagall walked over.
It's Gryffindor Draco, and it's a very large stretch considering Dean didn't live in Wiltshire. Please, keep that in mind x
“I is been told many stories about the Great Harry Potter sir!” The House-elf exclaimed, jumping out of the way from the broken chair Harry had pulled up.
“Do you believe me?” Whispered Harry, looking at Draco. The blonde brought a hand to Harry’s cheek, stroking it with his thumb. “Of course I believe you Harr.” He whispered back and removed his hand, turning to face the canopy again.
The pain will go. The pain will go. It has to go, right? Everyone leaves me.
The flower was an apple blossom. To the stem was a note, which Su read out loud to him and Abbott before he could see it.
Later that day, everyone was in the living room by the fire. The boys’ plus Ginny were playing exploding snap- minus Draco who preferred to be cuddled in a corner reading. Once the girl got over her initial shock, she would blush every time Harry spoke in her direction or to her.
(Draco believed in Wackspurts. Luna may be seen as 'loony' but she didn't care what anybody thought of her and was just herself. Many people probably believed in Wackspurts, dabberlimps, Nargles, etcetera. But they don't want to be judged. And Draco heavily respects her for not worrying over image.)
Ron crossed his arms over his chest, “What’s that supposed to mean?”
Molly was preparing and cooking dinner despite both Draco and Harry insisting to help (Harry out of habit and Draco because he felt like he was being lazy by not doing anything around the house).
"Draco," Harry cried his name. The rain tapping couldn't subdue the sob and crack of the mans voice. Without another word, Harry shakily grabbed a piece of parchment from his pocket. It was crumbled, drenched in rain water. But he could read the word resignation and his heart sored with hope.
When the two schools entered the Great Hall, the Beauxbatons Students automatically went to the Gryffindor table and they created space for the girls to sit easily. The boys moved over quickly, whereas, the girls had to be shoved.
Had it really been six months? Draco didn't know, didn't want to know, didn't care even. Everything so far had been floating endlessly in a limbo of numbness. No pain but no pleasure, no anger but no euphoria. Honestly, it may have been the best he'd felt for a while.
"You do not know what you're doing!"
And he was determined to get it back.
"Leave me alone Potter. I just came to the Party for the drugs. I'm not trying to make a friend or fall in love so just- just stop this faking." Before Harry had the chance to actually tell Draco the news, he received from his father- the dean of the collage he was accepted into- he was already gone to the bathroom.
Harry smirked and shook his head. "Thinking of going stag, this year mate. More action, ain't it?"
The blonde shrugged, "I think they'll age it to seventeen, but one can hope." He added when Terry's face fell.
"It was because of that album, that I lost the person I love. This song, will be the last song before my break from recording. Music is my passion and I love it, but it isn't worth sacrificing the person I love for." There were multiple awe's from behind the microphones.
Harry was now on eleven flowers, all with different meanings: red rose (love), apple blossom (trust), acanthus (The Finest of Art), Amaryllis (pride- not just in your potions work), borage (bluntness- which you have a lot of), a white camellia (You're adorable- Draco was tempted to punch him for that one), pink carnation (I'll never forget you- although sweet, Draco did feel the need to gag so he made the motion to Harry who laughed), Coriander (hidden worth- this had Draco blushing every time he looked at Harry that day), edelweiss (devotion- to your family and to your friends), Hyssop (sacrifice), Lily (beauty- Draco thought 'I know I am' in his head until he read the note talking about the inner beauty not outer).
One day, Draco was staying at Harry's house watching a movie on the sofa. It was peaceful until his phone began to ring. Looking up at him, Harry smiled, "Let me take this." Draco whispered, swiping the hair from Harry's forehead and making him sit up.
Meanwhile, Harry was saying hi to everyone, making casual Smalltalk. Most guys here he'd spoken to because of skiing, but other than that they were just strangers, people wondering about he greeted like they did in the 1960s. His best clothes consisted of tight-fit black jeans, an ironed-to-perfection red shirt, with a burgundy jacket over the top of that. It barely even fitted him- he was convinced it had to be his dad's.
"C'mon, Potter, help me a bit here." Draco hissed, his leg aching from Harry's weight all being on his side- he was not built to carry people. Potter didn't speak or resist his hold- Draco didn't know whether it was shock or terror or he was vexatious. Possibly all three, most likely even more.
It was them. When he caught Harry’s eye the fury in his gaze made Harry take a step back and Draco thought that was a damn good choice! While Molly was scolding Ron, Draco fumed while Dumbledore, McGonagall and Snape spoke to the two. They spoke on how stupid the boys had been and how to use a thing called common sense. Draco added a comment that they need to be told the definition first getting a small but quick smile from McGonagall and a warm look from Snape.
"It was... relaxing, for a change." Draco smiled (Harry saw it and his stomach did a little flip), "Father and I spent time on Quidditch, mother and I went shopping in Paris and New York, and we got a swimming pool installed inside and out. Father says it's going to be the next 'big thing', and I'm not going to disagree if I get to use a personal swimming pool.
Gilderoy Lockhart dragged Harry up to the front to take a picture for the prophet. He smiled a fake one, being let go with an entire set of his books that Molly took off him for Lockhart to sign.
"I'm ready." Harry's voice was strong- he's finally found true peace.
"Just because you want knew shoes and cufflinks." He rolled his eyes at his father's smirk as he bounded off to the hotel room.
It only stopped when Draco hit Harry and clipped a sharp bit on his glasses- Draco forgot to fix those earlier- and it ripped all over Potter's head. They both laughed, climbing into the magically built and held up Pillow Fort, sighing when their heads hit the double pillows and they lay on top of the duvets and the duvets below that one.
When they made it around the corner so people from the Great Hall couldn’t see, Draco sighed stopping where he was. “Seven hells, she is the definition of annoying.” He leant further into Harry as he sighed again.
Sitting at a bar somewhere in London, the man drank his third straight shot of vodka recalling how he fucked up so badly. Why
It was four years later, their second to last year in college, that Draco had finished the rehabilitation programme and had been clean for so long. "Hey." Draco whispered to Harry, holding him closely when he came back from his last session.
!” She carried on, flailing the towel around while she did. At one point, she accidently whipped it, making Ron jump back slightly.
“Oh, sorry.” She laughed slightly, “Green eyes, black hair... Harry?” Shyly Harry nodded still not used to the ‘famous Wizard Who Killed the Dark Lord’ title yet, “Draco talks about you all the time-”
But all was good, when moments later, Draco said, "You're not getting away with that, Potter!" And hit him again. For the next ten minutes or so, the Manor echoed childish giggling and thumps when pillows hit the other person. The white walls were brighter and the vibrant, yellow sofas became shields during their own little war.
"Well where are you going?" Harry asked.
Harry watched as the blonde walked off to get in the carriage. That was when Harry made a snap decision. "I'll ride with you!" But before Draco could say no, Harry was already climbing in the carriage seating himself beside the blonde so he was opposite Terry.
"Harry Potter... IS DEAD!" Shouted Voldemort with his followers cackling with him. Draco can't remember screaming at all, but he did feel the arms of Weasley securing his in a tight grip so he couldn't run to Harry's body. Even the silencing charm didn't register in him until Voldemort took it off.
"Don't take another step Potter." The flames grew stronger within the room, lighting it in a deep orange glow, "I can't think properly when around you- I can't trust myself not to throw myself at you and. And forgive you!"
However, he soon found out when faced with rows and rows of trays full with food for cooked dinners. The roasts looked coated in honey, making Harry’s mouth water. The golden glow of the Yorkshire puddings, right next to the luscious gravy. Almost a full chicken on the table that looked practically like the meat could fall off the bones. Harry thought that the food may be even better than the food at Hogwarts.
I tried apologising to everyone! I sent letters, I even got a muggle phone to try and call the non-pureblood prejudice people- the normal people. Only Potter even stayed to listen to the first word out of my mouth.
Chills spread through Draco wherever he stepped. No matter how many nights spent in that mansion with them, or the countless number of meetings he attended, Draco could never stop the permanent chill through his body.
Draco assumed it was the final day, because twelve flowers make a rose bouquet. There was no note with this, just a two-word piece of paper strapped to the side of a sunset purple orchid. It was definitely a weird looking plant was Draco's conclusion. It had a stem that looked like wood and two flower petals that looked like perfectly semi-circled leaves. 'Gryffindor Table' was what the note read and the girls grabbed onto an arm each, squeezing it tightly.
When they pulled apart, Draco said "I'll call you." He whispered. When Harry was about to protest, he said "You'll need to get your jacket back eventually, right?"
"He was a catcher. Half the cells in
He was in the Champions tent. Palms sweating, his hair falling in his face every few seconds. “Ppsst!” a voice hissed and Harry leant his ear against the tent, “Monsieur Harry? Is that you?” Draco. The other boy’s lips twitched up.
“Oh come on Perseus, you must have figured it out!” Fred stared wide eyed at Percy who had a raised eyebrow.
"Is this what will make you happy?" For the only time in his life, Harry went with his head. Firmly, he nodded and even saw the completely broken look on Draco's face as the man's hands shook as he used a wordless and wandless accio to summon a pen.
Pansy's flat was grand, in the middle of London. It cost at least one thousand a week to rent, but Pansy brought it and paid mortgage on the spot.
"Well where's the fun it that?" Harry cheekily smiled, folding his arms and crossing his legs.
When his ears were basically shredded in half by the harsh pull of the wires, Draco gasped. Shooting up like a kid having a terrible nightmare, Draco gasped at his mom. "Why? The song was almost done!" He complained.
"For this reason the ministry has seen fit to impose a new rule. To explain all this we have the head of the department of international magic cooperation Mister Bartimus Crouch."
Firstly, he got rid of the old, Malfoy treasured furniture (
"Potter, what do you think you are doing? Let go of me this instant."
Draco tried to lean in to kiss Harry feeling- knowing- Harry would kiss him back, "No." He held a tanned finger to the pink lips, "I want to kiss you and not have you taste like tar. So, you get yourself clean, or this," he let go of Draco's arm to gesture back and forth between them, "will not happen."
They were out Horcrux hunting when Ron and Harry fought. Ron brought up Draco... and the mission. He shouted at Draco telling him the reason Harry was with him in the first place. It was later that night when Draco packed a bag and ran off to then not be seen for a week.
"I'm very aware of that."
"I reread Shakespeare's works, and Lockhart's. Knowing he is a fraud doesn't take away from the magnificent tales- those are someone's past, after all." Finished, Draco returned the question to Terry.
They both squealed, excited to see who this mystery man was. Harry coughed, standing on top of the Gryffindor table. He looked around awkwardly, knowing now it wasn't as easy doing this in front of everyone instead of his dorm mates plus Hermione.
" the grey-eyed boy sang, and it was so, so beautiful Harry almost missed the next line. He could listen to that boy sing for hours and hours on end- he didn't even know the darling’s name.
All the boys groaned, but Neville was the first up. He heard the blonde's excitement and decided to wake to smile at the rabbit-like boy. Seamus and Ron didn't shake, but Dean and Harry woke after with loud yawns to a frustrated cry.
“He’s polite, funny, interesting,” Without realising, Harry continued, “and his accents thick too. I’ve never seen hair as blonde as his before” Harry carried on walking, but stopped when he realised his best friends had too.
Once again, Dean found them, “Is this how they’ll start every year?” Dean mumbled to himself and shook his head fondly. Being Draco’s closest friend, he was so happy for him having a place he loved and someone other than himself who loved him so much.
Confused Draco had no idea who that was, "Err, who?"
He and Draco had a very long, very overdue talk about trust and how Harry should have told Draco the minute he realised he had feelings for the other boy. Harry promised that in the future he would tell Draco everything first.
"Well, I'm not voting for him to become Minister."
If Draco was being honest, he only brought the engagement ring thinking Harry would stay. With the ring fiddling between his fingers, Draco reconsidered...
It's Gryffindor Draco, and it's a very large stretch considering Dean didn't live in Wiltshire. Please, keep that in mind x
"Well thank you, Hermione. That's kind of you." He smiled, then turned to the boys, "How rude of me! I'm Draco Malfoy, almost Black- that is, until the divorce is properly through." He said, gesturing for the boys to sit. Ron sat by Hermione, and Harry next to the very, very attractive French male.
Sensing people looking at him, Draco put the headphones around his neck. Ron and Harry were staring at him in wonder. "Is- is something wrong?" He enquired.
To get this out of his mind, Draco turned on the TV to see the news was about him: he sighed again. Turning the channel over, Draco intently watched Eastenders for the next hour and a half long special, possibly shedding a tear at the end. But nobody needs to know that.
(See the end of the chapter for
, Draco thought. She had a hat on, with shorts, appropriate black socks and a baggy, black tank top with purple streaks. He had freed them all, but they decided to stay. Thankfully, all the House-elves agreed that if anyone Draco hadn't invited over popped up, they had to get on their old potato sacks.
A song came on the radio that Draco made him and Harry dance to, because 'I never got my chance during the Yule ball'.
"It was a mistake!" Harry shouted louder than Draco, his voice cracking. Silence surrounded the room, the flames growing weak from no letter in a while. "I've only ever loved you-"
They threw his trunk on, and Harry carefully passed over Hedwig in her cage. His hands shook as he did, trying to be quick but careful as he heard and felt the thudding of Vernon’s elephant-size feet on the floor. He stood on the windowsill, shaking with fear, excitement or nerves he had no idea. But he didn’t get time to dwell on his emotions, because Vernon had finished on the locks, barging through the door be barely fit though to try and grab Harry.
"What took it so long mate?" Ron asked once everyone was sorted. Cautious to not knock anything over, Draco lowered his goblet and licked his lips, "The hat wanted me in Slytherin. However, I am not like my father. Therefore, I was very persistent about being in any house but Slytherin." Explained Draco, moreover, Harry saw that as a thing they had in common- choosing Gryffindor over Slytherin.
They had won. But at what cost?
(Draco was sitting on the train reading a Shakespeare play when Terry bursted through the door "That's my favourite!" He exclaimed, then they became friends. Later on, Justin walked in with a hand buzzer shaking Terry's hand and they all laughed it off. Then they became friends.)
"Come here, I'll show you if you don't believe me."
Meanwhile, over at the Gryffindor table, there was uproar. Uproar as in 'boycott Hogwarts' uproar from the avid Quidditch supporters and the team players. However, Harry would never admit this, he was more focused on Draco Malfoy talking with his friend (Tony? Turnip?) normally.
Admittedly, Draco had to give him an answer because at least he didn't use the word 'little' in that description. "That 'shy, adorable Ravenclaw' would prefer for you to leave him alone." Harry still smiled at him, like he was an oblivious idiot. Wait, no, he is. "But thank you for the ego boost, Potter."
The 'Re-blossom of Forbidden Romance' was displayed across the front page of The Daily Prophet. An interview from Blaise, Harry, Draco and Ron making up the two-page spread.
"Hey Malfoy, why did you leave?" Harry found him in a carriage on his own, peacefully with his knees drawn on the seating and a book braced on his upper legs. Upon Potter's entry, Draco lowered his legs to sit properly.
When he lowered Draco, his hands were still on the others thin waist, and Draco had his comfortably lapped around Harry's neck. Without thinking of consequences, Harry leant in not noticing Draco was doing the same. The two met halfway and moved perfectly.
this that student must survive three tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks." Dumbledore explained.
that.
“You seem to be in a bit of a predicament though, eh?” George smiled, then nudged Fred to bring the car closer to the window.
Acidy turned to Potter, "Of course, Mister Harry Potter. Whatever would you like?"
"But seriously, you have an amazing voice. You’re a singer, right?" Harry was very enthusiastic, more so than he was about basketball.
The two stared confused at the note for a second. But Hannah rushed off, calling out: "I have a book in my trunk about Victoria flower meanings!".
"We kept it secret, because we knew how everyone would look down at us. That our emotions didn't count, because they would only see the Son of a Death Eater, a Slytherin and the Golden Boy. The world would've disapproved, but you were my world Potter. You were everything I ever had- that the silver lining was golden instead.
"So... you're- elated? To see your friends again? And... sorry, I'm lost at your last sentence."
“How do you know my name?” Harry asked, walking cautiously to his bed. He didn’t take his eyes off Dobby either, reaching for the book on his table in case it was needed.
Harry jumped down from the table, almost knocking a saucer of milk to the floor but Dean quickly moved it from the way. Sue and Hannah were looking on fondly at Draco; happy that their knew-found friend was going to finally be out of his mopey stage.
"Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!" Draco repeated, bouncing about the dorm room at six am. He forgot grace all together, due to the fact that Beauxbatons was arriving in four hours! All lessons were cancelled for that day and the next, so the two schools can settle in.
The week flew by and today, everyone was coming back to Hogwarts! Yes, he would miss the quiet of the halls and his relaxing nights in the fresh air. But he’s also excited to see everyone again: see Blaise, Theo, Neville and Seamus who he hasn’t seen in the Holidays.
Tears couldn’t stop following. Harry's world had ended. His soul split in two. His heart broken into twenty four. His life stolen... and now he's lost Draco... forever.
Because of the height difference, Ron put the glasses on but instantly wanted to throw them off.
"I was packing in a rush." Harry tried to defend himself.
' Read the headline of the Daily Prophet one morning. It was an image of Draco and Harry kissing each other behind a statue, and then pulling away, smiling at each other.
"He's incredible, and I'm not revealing his name because, he doesn't want to be in the spotlight." Gasps surrounded the studio at the first pronoun used, nobody expecting Draco Malfoy to be in love with a male.
“Bed- both of you: I’m going to freshen,” Draco commanded. Seeing the state of his best friend, Ron nodded saying a goodnight to Harry and leaving.
"Oh, shut it you blond tosser." Abbott giggled, plopping herself down opposite Draco. She snatched the book from his already weak grasp and flicked it to the page with a colourful, very square and small piece of parchment sticking out that she called a 'posted note'.
"I'm done with you, Harry Potter!" Screamed Romilda Vein. Harry rolled his eyes, not even having the courtesy to pretend to care.
"Yes, thank you for pointing out the obvious Zabini: brilliant!" He hung his head ready to give up the chance of romance.
"Your father, it's Lucius Malfoy." Ron spat, yelping after when Hermione stomped on his foot.
Hermione timidly raised her hand half way, "Three, sir."
“He seems alright- not like any of us when we first met you mate.” He nudged Harry’s arm with his elbow, “Reminds me of a Zabini crossed with Herm: Pure bloodedness bookworm.” He mused, laughing at his own joke.
"Give him a chance?" Scoffed Terry. "We did that in second year. Draco made chaser and when Gryffindor won Draco, Justin and I went to congratulate them and Potter ignored us."
He didn't wear black, because even though Draco wore that colour the most, the boy was a bright spark in Harry's life. His white suite was the dimmest of the shade at best. In his hands was the panflet you get at funerals: Draco's face when he was nineteen was splayed across the front. It was extracted from Blaise's memory; the only time Draco laughed a genuine laugh that year.
"Porcupine!" Exclaimed Draco to Terry, "Mouse!" He hugged Justin just as closely. He had missed them both so deeply over the summer. Since his family had moved to France, Draco wasn't able to travel back and forth as much as he liked. Furthermore, his mother was still trying to get him to go to Beauxbatons. Thankfully, his father was determined for him to stay at Hogwarts arguing 'you wanted him at that school in the first place' and 'he has a life there' and 'he's happy!'
All the first years had either wide mouths or wide eyes as they looked around the Great Hall. Some whispered "It's Harry Potter!" When they spotted him. It was like a curse: as soon as one says his name, everyone else follows.
want to stop staring at those wonderful, rare grey irises’ that dazzled and dazed him. "Er- do you want my erm- my jacket?' He asked, suddenly lost for words at how gorgeous this boy was. Silently, Draco nodded, using a delicate wrist to pluck the material from between Harry's fingers and gently put it on. It looked massive. He heard the other boy laugh at how big it was, and his cheeks turned the brightest shade of pink.
However, the boy quickly suckered Draco back in by twirling him on the small space that Draco almost laughed as he did. Was it weird he felt giddy right now?
“Oh shove off Zabini” Warned Harry, tugging Draco’s arm to turn him, but Draco gave Harry a look and he let go.
“Oi! Watch where you’re going with that thing!” A Muggle scolded them, kicking a case closer to the boys. Harry blushed from embarrassment, apologising and saying they lost control of the carts.
"Draco, I hope you know that I-" Harry gulped and Draco watched his Adams apple bob, "I really miss you." He whispered, the sound moulding together like bits of clay with the spinner as the wind.
“Hello boys” said Dumbledore stopping at the end of the hallway to the exit of the castle. Walking around Snape, Draco got a look at hopefully Harry and Ron.
Nodding so small Draco could have imagined it, Harry's hands came down around the rim of his shirt and lingered there for a while just running his hands around it wondering what to do. Eventually, gently as he could, Potter lifted the fabric over his head peeling off the disgusting, torn shirt to reveal scars, cuts and bruises littering his chest.
"And why is that, boy?" He tried hard to cover a scowl, like he wanted to keep Potter as a slave as well.
"You look gorgeous Draco." Gasped Harry.
"Could this be true?"
Draco paced back and forth outside of the Great Hall refusing to go in without his two best friends- if he ever told Ron that, he would obliviate him on the spot. Every possible outcome ran through his mind and every one of them was negative.
Out of the shadows, a strange man emerged from the corner. His clothes baggy, hair thin and one eye missing, replaced with one that follows you everywhere. "Bloody hell, it's Mad-eye Moody!" Said Ron.
“RON!” Called Draco and he threw the glasses at the red-haired boy who caught them easily.
Gloomily, Harry sat at the window looking between the iron bars. His glasses reflecting the poisoned night sky so no stars shone. The amount of times Draco had made him sit at the Gryffindor windowsill and look at the stars with him, Harry was sure he could draw constellations in the air to show everyone how beautiful the sky can be when seen.
shorts (Draco almost threw up then and there in the shop), but they were very comfortable still. And, underneath those, were some very light pink tights that could be mistaken for beige in dark lighting. His shoes, that he was extremely grateful for, were red Doc Martins and a perfectly matching belt down to the loops that were (finally) shiny black.
She cleared her throat and made Abbott restrain Draco's arm as a joke as the blonde groaned, tossing his head on the table.
Harry looked at it with curiosity and uncertainty but nodded. Draco gave Harry the headphones and their hands brushed briefly. Harry had never felt anything so electrifying in his life. Cautiously, Harry put it on and he jumped as sound starting playing in his ears.
The raven edged closer to Malfoy, "What if I want to stop this feud?" It wasn't a rhetorical question, but Malfoy treated it like one in complete silence until his body remembered movement was a thing.
"Everyone!" He called and all the students paid attention only small whispers littering the Great Hall. McGonagall knew what he was doing, so looked at him with a large grin. "Whenever I think of you, my head feels like its underwater, but I'm breathing fine. You are incredibly crazy and sometimes? I feel like I am out of my mind. You are my end, my beginning and everything in between. When the word was beating you down, you've found your way back up." Everyone stared in awe at Harry, some people putting all the puzzle pieces together. Next to Draco the two Hufflepuff girls had and their arms squeezed his until there was little to no circulation.
From behind her back, Narcissa pulled out a book that had a strap wrapped around the centre of the green cover, spine and back with blotches of other styles of green. “I missed your birthday...” she handed it for Draco to take, “It’s a dairy, but one where someone can talk back to you if you need any help with anything.”
Ding dong! The doorbell went and before Harry could be hit over the head with a hand, he ran upstairs to his room and closed the door behind him- not looking up from the ground yet.
"oh tu parles français! Je pensais que je serais seul! merci Merlin!" He smiled and Harry's lips twitched at the blondes bright expression, "excusez ma grossièreté. Je suis Draco, Draco Malfoy."
"I'm here." Managing just fine! Harry found his way to Draco holding him by the elbows, "to talk to you. My father called me when I was driving here- he said there's a slot free in my dorm and on my team for my choosing at collage." He heard the intake of breath and was slightly thankful for his nose not being so abused, "I'd like you to join me."
No, they were not a couple (even if Draco desperately wanted them to be). They were extremely close friends, but on a level he wasn't with Pansy and Blaise- it was different between them. However, life drove them to different paths: Harry wanted a quiet life, whereas, Draco wished for the limelight- but who can blame someone for wanting to be recognised for their talents?
Draco gazed at the Black Lake from the crumbling Bridge. He marvelled in the sunset and the free wind blowing through his hair that needed washing. He felt someone walk up beside him, and Draco put his hand on the person's. They looked out to the Black Lake together, ready to face the next step in grieving, in surviving and- most importantly- in living. They were going to face this together, no matter the lies or distrust they've had together. This was now and that was then.
The corners of Dumbledore's mouth twitched.
"FIVE!" They looked up at each other, pulling apart slightly to get more comfortable. "FOUR!"
Harry heard it on his way to college one evening. Unconsciously so, he bobbed his head and tapped his foot along to the song. "That was Draco Malfoy's new song! And here is the man himself, with the inside scoop on the lyrics. Tell me, Draco, what was your inspiration behind the song that has immediately reached number one only a day after its release."
"You're very appropriately named, you know that?"
Finally, when up on stage, Draco tried pulling down his shirt when he felt a finger gently tap his shoulder. Nervous, scared, uncomfortable, Draco turned to see a boy with bright, green eyes that screamed to be looked at because of how special they were.
When Harry lunged forwards going on tip-toes crushing Draco's mouth to his. When Draco got over the initial shock, he put a hand on Harry's waist and the other on his shoulder. Harry's hands stayed on Draco's face, but one moved down to angle the blondes neck lower so he could deepen the kiss further.
"But where do you live?" He shouted out, but Draco ignored him. Choosing to walk off and not turn around, hiding his smirk and red cheeks.
“You will stay at that stove all day and cook for our guests later. Am I clear?” It was Petunia, his aunt, who spoke. Her shrill tone wasn’t surprising to Harry because she’s never spoken to him in any other way.
"The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be staying with us for the greater part of this year. I know that you will all extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with us, and will give your whole-hearted support to the Hogwarts champion when he or she is selected.
"You forfeit all right to my heart, the place in that bed. You can sleep in your office instead!" That was when Harry realised, it wasn't
Minutes and minutes (although it felt like hours) of rapidly bobbing his leg, the doors opened and the first years with the addition of Draco walked through the hall. The French transfer student stood out due to his height- the boy was a couple inches shy of Ron's height.
"Oui, oui, désolé!" The blonde exclaimed. Retract the statement of banning French, because it already sounds illegal coming from the blonde. The boy lifted his luggage from the seating to the railings and lifted his feet from the seat, "Je ne m'attendais pas à ce que quelqu'un me rejoigne!"
"Er - but maybe this is not the time... no..." said Dumbledore. "Where was I? Ah, yes, the Triwizard Tournament... well, some of you will not know what this tournament involves, so I hope those who do know will forgive me for giving a short explanation, and allow their attention to wander freely. The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years ago, as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of wizardry - Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the Tournament once every five years and it was generally agreed to be the a most excellent way of establishing ties between young witch's and wizards of different nationalities - until, that is, the death toll mounted so high that the Tournament was discontinued."
Potter gasped as a pillow collided with the side of his face. Actually giggling, Draco wasn't prepared for one to hit him back and he gasped as well. A tense silence overwhelmed Potter-
"Glad to know you are familiar with your place in society, Potter." Superiority enveloped Draco's personality so well Harry snorted a laugh.
“Oi! I’m not that bad!” Harry nudged his right arm hard, close to knocking Draco off his shoulder. Whining, Draco made a noise he wouldn’t admit to later, also brining his head back to Harry’s shoulder that the raven-haired boy couldn’t refuse.
"H-heal me, p-please?" Mumbled Potter as he rested the shirt he had on in his lap, forcing his hands to not cover his body up. Nodding, Draco took his wand, watching the skin reform and the cut disappear like nothing had happened. The whole process took about an hour to do. It was in silence since Potter was reluctant to speak, but it wasn't a thick silence at all.
and an
"So," Harry started off and slid closer to Draco. Eying him with concern, Draco shut his book and didn't move even an inch. "How come I've never spoke to you before, gorgeous?"
“On the cheek.” Added Fred, the two teasing him. Harry’s blush couldn’t be more red if he tried, but he couldn’t focus on why he was blushing so much at a... a kiss. They’ve done that before, on the cheek and the forehead. So why was he blushing?
"You published the letters she wrote you. You published every single letter Weaslette, your best friend’s youngest sister, wrote you." He had a thought, "And you’re saying you hate the media. The irony.
"Can't believe you are friends with Ronald Weasley." Terry screwed his nose in disgusted as he glanced behind him to see Weasley devouring a pork chop.
"No." Harry stated, looking at all the people before him. "I'm not letting you guys get hurt because of me."
Granger, who was on the far right, had hair cut like Pansy's. It was short, some natural curling to the bottom, but it was chunky, uneven, forced. Blood was seeping from her wrists and her cheek and soaking deeply into her khaki trousers.
At one am, there was a knock at his door, one that had a jingle to it Harry couldn't refuse. Stumbling off the settee, Harry's blurry and sluggish demeanor remained the same as he heavy-handedly opened the door with a crash when it hit the wall. Standing, pristine and proper as always, outside his door was Draco Malfoy.
"Trying to clear your name of which something two, maybe a few knew, has ruined our life. You, single handed, ruined this families life." Draco couldn't think of what Teddy, James, Scorpius or Ruby thought about this. He didn't want to incision them hating Harry, but part of him didn't care.
The whole day he walked around with a smile on his lips, a blush on his face, and a cloud under his feet.
"Miss Delacour, give the boy a chance to breathe." The tall woman spoke in English, walking up to Draco. He hugged the Headmistress; she patted him on the head.
. The twins grinned, explaining how they scare their little sister Ginny by pretending she doesn’t exist, and had Lee around quite a lot to commentate Quidditch games and to just mess around. Ron said it was good, but boring without Harry. For a few days he had Draco around, but the boy would mostly talk to Percy (“It was like Percy is his favourite Weasley or something!” Ron would exclaim).
"Alright, whatever. Well, I'm going back to my hotel room." Laughed the blonde boy, kissing Harry on the cheek and leaving with the jacket still firmly on his slim frame and tall figure.
"Have you heard?"
"Did too!" Retaliated the younger girl. "I made the team before you did!"
At one point, Draco regained his confidence. He took off Harry's jacket, throwing it into the crowed and he didn't even hear their cheers and clapping because he was just so focused on them, together. At the high note, Draco closed his eyes, swaying his hips to the song and he took a step back, almost falling straight into the crowd. He felt people push him up, and that was when the trance was broken.
The flower actually came with about two blossomed, and two still as little buds. Two leaves with zig-zag outlines perfectly moulded the flowers into their pond-flower shape.
"Ok, like this?" Unprepared, James watched as Harry faked left then perfectly sunk a two pointer. Harry smiled. No matter the pressure he felt, he still loved this sport. It was always
"Me too, Monsieur Harry” he chuckled and exited the compartment to make his way to the boats.
Like this unavoidable, severe injury in his chest; one cut so deep that it would never fully heal and he would live with that reminding, remaining, regretful scar for the rest of his miserable life. The heaviness, the shortness of breathe, the dizziness that is unavoidable. That the more he focused on it the more his once flaming green eyes of passion stung and stung and stung. Their story of passion, romance, comedy, action, growth, was not finished. But the author gave up.
Soon, Harry was smothered by Draco who squeezed him tightly. “I’m so glad you’re alright.” Whispered Draco, breathing in the comfortable and safe sent of his best friend.
"And father, Sirius, Remus, even Snape is there love. Everyone who loved us." The train pulled up with the letting of steam from the top.
Draco and practically all the other stoners in their school normally indulged in their addictions in the abandoned school bathroom. You would get the occasional sports player in their too but the main, blonde sports star would be there at least four times a week.
Rolling his eyes, Draco barely had the patience for this. "Ravenclaw Tower, obviously."
“Er- thank you... I-I think your smile is beautiful too.” Draco leant over and kissed the boy on the cheek again. Distracted by his emotions, Draco was able to take Harry’s glasses from him.
"And this one," Ron pointed to Harry, "talks about you frequently."
There was the tapping of an owl at the window. Well, Errol crashed into the window thinking it was open. Instantly, Molly was up and rushing to the bird. “You silly owl- can’t you see the window isn’t open?” Percy scolded.
Was it worth it though? His soul was split in two. One half carelessly casted aside while the other got to experience all the wonders of humanity: the
Suddenly, the noise in the kitchen stopped. “Dinner’s ready!” Called Molly from the kitchen/dining room. Like the word ‘dinner’ was some sort of trigger, Draco seemed wide awake, which Harry couldn’t understand because the blonde didn’t each much anyway.
It wasn’t long until the invisibility mode stopped working and Ron panicked. He swerved the wheel, took his foot off the pedal and was sure they were seen but that was after the fact. They managed to make it on the rail track, hovering atop the lines wondering where the train was.
"That, was incredible!" Ron jumped up and down, giving Draco a one-armed hug in which he returned.
. There was no one else of board, so the boat carried on sailing further and further away, getting smaller and smaller as it went.
"Two Sunday Dinners, if you may."
Being dismissed, both boys knew it was Draco’s turn to shout at them, but this was the worst. “I-I’m disappointed, in both of you.” He confessed when reaching the dorm (Dean was with Seamus and Neville on the floor down, wishing to spend the night with his two best friends he hasn’t seen), “I was so, so worried... I thought you died or-or were taken. I was so... so scared for both of you I just-” he closed his eyes, slowly breathing in to calm down his emotions.
He made his way down the steps, passing Blaise who just stuffed a piece of paper in his pocket. They exchanged a nod in greeting, because Draco saw Blaise’s mother and his sisters (one older, the twins at the age of 9 and a toddler).
Draco shook his head, still smiling contagiously, "Unless being alone in my bedroom counts, and singing to my old teddies?" They both laughed, moving slightly closer together.
clothes going in the bag, but
Sitting in his house with his two sons and two daughters just outside the glass window having a water fight, Harry smiled. "You alright darling?" Asked Draco, bringing in two glasses of fresh Coca-Cola from the fridge. Gently, Draco put down the drinks and sat next to Harry, throwing an arm around his long-term husband so said husband could lean into him.
“I do not involve myself in... girly conversation with my other upper class men. It is very unprofessional.” He smoothed down his napkin that was in his lap, then neatly cut a piece of the chicken.
Draco said that the light thing given to him by Dumbledore (Hermione receiving a book, Ron getting the Sword of Gryffindor, and Harry the first snitch he ever caught) led him back to the group; back to Harry.
Draco could not believe what he heard. "Are we talking about the same Weasley? Are you sure you're not talking about the twins when using the adjective funny?
His eyes lit up at that, because there was something he needed advice on (something, or someone). “If you tell anyone I gave it to you, they’ll take it away because they think I’m like him, okay?” Draco nodded, knowing what his mother was referring to and promised to tell no one.
"Now that," Draco used his fork to point at the animal, "is cannibalism.”
That song had to be his all-time favourite; nothing could change his mind. Dressed in black ripped jeans, Draco tapped his boot-clad heals against the arm of the sofa and rested his old MP3 on his chest that was a black crop-top. It was striped white and black along the arms and in the centre was a detailed skull with a rose being held by its decaying teeth.
Seamus broke it just before the blonde was about to leave, Harry could tell. "Sure, Malfoy. There's only a space by Harry though, a bit busy here lad." He threw a bean at Dean and it landed in his mouth. "Get in!" He cheered. Malfoy chuckled, attracting Harry's attention even more than he already did.
Instead of giving up, Harry did the same back to Draco when they were walking away. Both Terry and Justin wailed in laughter, barely being able to make it up the steps without clutching their sides every two seconds.
“You prefects know all the gossip!”
"You've got a true fight for Seeker next year." And Harry didn't really mind.
"It may have not crossed your sickle-sized brain considering you didn't even know my name before today- don't talk Potter, I'm a Ravenclaw, I know things- but I do have friends and a life and you have never been a part of it. Now," Draco stood straight, sticking his nose in the air and dismissing Harry. "I am leaving, do not follow me."
thinking of his promotion had Harry realising it was his own fault for their distance. The one million miles, the difference between them, was all his fault. The thousands of calls Draco used to leave him during the day, all the hellos he managed if Draco awoke the same time as Harry.
The month leading to the Tri-Wizard Tournament, Harry and Draco grew very close. Quickly, Harry got over his denial for crushing on Draco Malfoy at the mock-Quidditch game set up by Oliver Wood (Gryffindor Quidditch Captain) and Bradly Summers (Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain). Harry didn't feel like participating after seeing Draco ask Wood if he could play Seeker. It was a month into the school year when it happened- by then, Harry knew he really, really liked Draco but hadn't quite come to terms with it yet.
Malfoy slapped him across the face, hard. Possibly the hardest slap Harry had ever felt. His hand came to touch his burning cheek but he moved it away immediately when he felt it sting from touch.
Weasley ignored him while Granger did acknowledge him but just by a slight glance out of the corner of her eye. On the other hand, there was Harry Potter: who gazed at him with so many emotions that it made Draco blush. These new people in the carriage, Draco didn't have anyone to talk to because they didn't talk to him. So, he got up and took his trunk with him. While Draco left, it was silent in the carriage until Harry told them he needed the bathroom.
"No, we betted when you'd admit it. I said Christmas." Sighed Dean and opened his bedside table to chuck Seamus five galleons across the bedroom.
"Hello?" He spread his hands out in the air, "eternal glory." Terry's smile was so contagious Draco couldn't help his lips twitching.
Next to Draco, Luna Lovegood chatted away happily to him about her holiday and her time with the Weasley's. Especially mentioning Ginny on more than ten occasions. But the male blonde saw no point in telling her that, as Luna would brush it off deciding to talk about the many Wackspurts that buzzed around the first years.
“Hello? Draco Malfoy speaking.” He knew who it was. It really wasn’t very hard to deduce.
This is an AU.
!" Malfoy made many frustrated hand gestures.
"Why are you still reading that? The transfer student might not even talk to us!" Exclaimed Ron as they walked down the Isles to find a compartment.
"Draco-"
Was the entire crowds reaction, and the players, as Draco leapt off his broom- fifty feet in the air- and clutched the glittering ball in his left hand. Without looking worried (the opposite could be said for Harry), Draco let himself drop a meter or so before he was sat back on his broom like nothing happened. In a flash, Draco was on the ground surrounded by the entire Gryffindor house, but Harry being the first person to hug Draco. He lifted the boy off the ground, spinning him in a circle as the Blonde giggled, placing hands either side of Harry's shoulders.
Draco chuckled and turned to them, having to tilt his head up a bit to look them in the eye, "I'm here for the drugs, idiot." The other two could understand that: being on the football team gave them many privileges, apparently, one of those privileged allowed them to smoke on school grounds or at school parties.
Instead, Harry landed in a shop he came to learn as Borgin and Burkes. The green interior screamed Slytherin and the artefacts wailed cursed, especially that book which trapped Harry’s hand. Two people walked through the door, both of them with straight posture and matching platinum hair.
When Harry left, he returned to the common room where everyone was in stunned silence. Many (if not everyone) shot him hatred and distasteful looks- he was glad when Draco stood up and walked Harry to their dorm. “Does everyone hate me?” Harry grumbled, flopping onto his bed and Draco stalked over, leaning against the post with his arms folded.
Scrolling through his Instagram feed, Draco found an image of himself and Harry the other boy had just posted. Draco's heart fluttered slightly at the image of Harry smiling, leaning his head on the blonde's shoulder at Devon beach and the sun setting.
"Alastor Moody? The Auror." she said, like that gives him any incentive.
“Dray?” He looked up to see the moon glittering with stars; Harry was so close he could see craters on the cold spheres, “shh, Dray, shh. I’m here, so is Ron. We’re fine now.” Harry soothed, bringing a hand to Draco’s cheek to wipe away some tears.
"Because, Ronald, I want to make them feel welcome!" She hit him lightly on the arm, but looked up from her book for the first time since the morning.
"Seems nobody has asked Perfect Potter, unless Weasel is your date?" He raised an eyebrow and one corner of his mouth. Harry wanted to wipe that smirk off his face, but not in the conventional way the saying was taken.
Harry and Ron shrunk in on themselves a lot seeing the state of their best friend. Ron had never seen Draco so vulnerable, and Harry wouldn’t have done if he didn’t wonder into that corridor.
"He acts more Slytherin than Gryffindor."
"Impressive Draco!" Said a Weasley- Fred, Draco came to learn.
"Why are you waitin' around?" That annoying little twerp asked him.
Draco was walking down a hallway back from the Black Lake when four people came up to him, giving him Narcissus Flowers. By the time he reached the Gryffindor common room, he was one flower short of a bouquet. Finally, he opened the door to see people in a circle, giving Harry room, who was holding the last flower. "Draco Lucius Malfoy," Draco could tell how nervous Harry was, and it was incredibly cute, "Will you go to the ball with me?" He asked and Draco forgot the flowers existed when he dropped the bouquet and launched himself in Harry's arms.
He turned his head, and the blonde removed Harry’s glasses to place them atop his own platinum head. One arm was thrown over him but Draco didn’t mind. In fact, he looked at Ginny directly to see her with a frown on her face at the display and smirked.
"MR. JORDAN!" Scolded McGonagall as she tried to not laugh. She approved this game along with Flitwick, so she decided to watch.
Harry couldn't stop staring.
Looking on, the older Weasley’s besides Arthur (who was just as clueless as Ron) smiled. Fred and George exchanged knowing glances, mentally preparing themselves for the things they’ll have to witness in the future. Percy was happy for them. Surprisingly, he was very fond of Draco, it seemed they were on a similar level of intellect and maturity.
"I do, so follow my lead. I'll be the male roll first, then you can try." He said, a sweet smile on his face. The lesson was more fun than an actual lessons. Throughout the hour, the boys laughed and joked while dancing elegantly; Draco even led Harry as the female, even though ne didn't actually mind.
Moving his hand down, Malfoy quickly grabbed his wrist that Harry's breath hitched. The other boy laughed, relaxing Harry slightly. "You almost poked her in the eye you oaf." Draco moved his hand gently to the top of the Thestrals head. "I best get going, or my friends will kill me for making them late."
"Wildcat jacket?" Draco smirked. "And this is your best clothing?"
"Why are you sitting with me again?" He asked, because he had never spoken to Li and never had any classes with her. Always with the Gryffindor's or Ravenclaw's.
"DRACO!" Pansy squealed, crushing him in a hug so tight Draco's body guards were afraid of his lack of access to oxygen.
Without a second thought, Harry jumped from the opened window to grab tightly on to Ron’s hands. Ron tried hard to haul him up, but Vernon was evidently stronger by the way Ron was half falling out of the window. Next was George, who latched onto Ron’s shoulders. It helped, but Harry was definitely going to fall into the prickly bushes if either let go.
Terry's skin was darker than his natural mixed colour because he went to Spain for about a month (what you can do in Spain for a month Draco had no clue) and Justin's hair had grown a lot longer so it could now be tied up in a bun. It looked quite good.
"I'm burning the letters you wrote me and if  you want to stand there, then so be it." He waved a careless hand, chucking quite a few into the already molten flames and felt a brick lift off his shoulders with every letter, but a feather be replaced instead. "I don't know who you are anymore... my Harry would never do this." He shook his head, maybe that would clear his thoughts, "I have so much to learn." He chuckled dryly, finding his voice as well as his balance.
you been!” Molly shouted, stopping all four boys in their tracks. “No note, car gone!” Fred, George and Ron still held the bread in their hands looking at Molly with wide eyes while Harry stuffed the food in his back pocket, “You could have died! You could have been
“Woah, all of Lockhart’s books!” Exclaimed Ron.
When arriving at the school, the boys could not hurry to exit quick enough. Draco, being polite, allowed Terry and Justin to go first. Just as he stood to exit, Harry got there first. His heavy feet thudded down the three steps and held out his hand for Draco to take to help him down.
“And what about you, boy?” His uncle asked- more like demanded.
Ron had the brilliant idea to drive the Ford Angela to Hogwarts using the flying and invisibility mode. Above the sky, Ron travelled a bumpy ride, defending himself by saying ‘Fred and George only started teaching me!’
Eyes just dropped closed, when there was a tapping at the window. “Ron?” Harry gasped, peering between the bars at the floating, blue Ford Angola. Inside the car at the wheel was Fred and sitting beside Fred at the front was George. They were both grinning like crazy and had their hair grown out slightly.
"Yes, but I've got to go- I'll call you when I land." He held the phone closer to his ear to be able to hear them properly.
That's why, on the train ride, Draco sat with Luna, Neville (after a very long and over-due apology) and Dean and Seamus who had just come out (he praised them for it, being able to be so open about themselves). It was midway through that the carriage door opened revealing none other than the Golden Trio.
“Shut that bloody owl up, boy.” Vernon said, shaking his head along with the fat that barely clung to his face and connected his head and shoulders like he had no neck.
“Hiya Harry.” Ron replied, looking at the bars on Harry’s windows.
“Be quiet!” Yelled Percy, banging his fist on his door that made Fred and George laugh.
He saw Ginny Weasley and although he disliked her he had a question, “Were Harry and Ron on the train?” She was worried, shaking her head. The other first years looked at him and whispered when recognising who he was. Happily, Draco would say he enjoyed the attention and drowned joyously in the fame he had and Harry had brought him. Not that he was with Harry as a friend for the fame, because he wasn’t.
At the Battle, although Draco didn't fight doesn't mean he wasn't there. Not fighting meant he didn't fire a spell, but he was so very tempted.
One day, Malfoy grabbed Harry by the sleeve and dragged him in an abandoned classroom. "
“You two looked comfortable during that chess match.” Fred pointed out, gesturing his fork in Harry and Draco’s direction, who were sitting beside each other.
There weren't many at the funeral, which Harry found frustrating but he understood. He hoped that now the blonde would at least get the recognised he deserved with his new potions and spells all written down in notebooks and the like in the Manor.
Draco stood up, like he was in a trance. The entire world faded to Harry Potter. Not 'The Boy Who Lived' or 'The Chosen One', just Harry. Just Harry who declared his love to Just Draco in front of the entire school and the Wizarding World who would know by tomorrow.
"After much deliberation the ministry has concluded that for their own safety no student under the age of seventeen shall be allowed to put forth their name for the tri-wizard tournament. This decision is final." Barty Crouch announced. And like someone screamed murder, the Great Hall was in uproar, including the underage students from the other school.
"Ready, Dragon?" She asked Draco, them both standing a meter or so away from the Black House. It belonged to nobody at the moment. Sirius Black was in jail for murdering the Potter's, Walburger died, Andromeda hasn't been seen in forever, Aunt Bella is in Azkaban (and rightfully so) and Regulus past. The only person eligible to be at the Black residence is Narcissa and Draco Malfoy.
“Maria please!” Whined Draco, stomping his food on the ground like a child.
Half an hour later, the room was again, full of excitement the moment Draco swung the door open. This time, Harry was properly up. His mouth dropped open when his eyes landed on Draco. The boy had his hair braided in a beautiful fish braid: it curling over his shoulder and not a hair was out of place. "Does it look good? Patil said it did, as well as Brown..." he worried.
Leaning into the hands, Harry closed his eyes, his smile growing wider if that was possible, “I’d like that too.”
He had gotten to know Su Li and Hannah Abbot during that time. Since all the eighth years had their main classes together, they would sit with him. This year though, Draco had taken Herbology, Arithmancy and Muggle Studies so he could become a healer or a potions business owner.
"No." His confident voice was not how he felt inside, "The man I love is dead because of the people like you. Why would I join a group of blindsided cowards who are too narrow minded to see the world around them?" Neville continued off Draco’s speech.
Throughout the journey, Harry tried a variety of pick-up lines on Draco which Harry thought succeeded. Draco's cheeks were constantly flushed and he could barely splutter or mumble a reply most of the time.
He opened the folded paper, and a red rose fell from it. His eyes fell to the wonderful flower in his lap. The heavy fragrance wafted in the air around him and Draco couldn't help but take a deep breathe in. It's long, spiky, green stem as fragile as glass. The petals as fragile as broken glass fixed together like puzzle pieces.
They brought Draco to their dorm early with The Prefects approval. The boy seemed to like and respect Draco compared to the others, because he didn’t scowl when Draco spoke to him. Passing the table, Draco was stopped by Lavender who was red in the cheeks and shy. “H-hi Draco,” She stuttered, her friends giggling around her and Draco sent a smile to them all, “I’m Lavender Brown. If you need anyone to show you around, you can ask me.” Her voice went higher at the end. Draco bowed, grabbing one of her hands in his and kissed the top of it.
). He liked it when he was a kid, but now, seeing it all reminds him of a worse time. This house- the part that wasn't blocked off- was his safe place, his silence, his solitary confinement.
The room immediately illuminated in chatter like a wildfire. "The Tri-Wizard Tournament, can you believe it!" Terry excitabily exclaimed. "Imagine being chosen to represent the school?" Dreamily, Terry sighed.
"Would you like to stand with us, Mister Malfoy?" He jumped at the chance, hugging Harry tightly then bouncing off with a smiling McGonagall. The moment the girls excited the carriage, they sped to Draco, trying to act properly but pushing on the borders. That border was pushed when they enveloped him in a breath-taking embrace. "C'est incroyable de te revoir Draco! Comment va Poudlard? N'est-ce pas mieux que Beauxbatons?" Fleur Delacour said, cupping the boy's cheeks, examining his features, "Oh comment tu as grandi ... tu es encore plus beau que l'année dernière Draco."
Stressed, Harry re-entered the bedroom. The sheets pristine clean, but that wasn't what Harry was focused on. The last thing he wanted to do was sleep.
Finally, his gaze was drawn to a glistening golden ring atop a piece of parchment. Harry picked the ring up, looking at the engravings. There was a Dragon on the inside and a raven on the out.
The twins had run inside already and had bumped and pushed their way through many people to see what was going on. Standing outside the shop was Maria and Dean who Draco eagerly dragged Harry to; they were still hand-in-hand as Draco was determined to not let Harry go again.
They met in the middle after a hypnotically dazed walk to the centre of the hall. For a while they just held each other. With shaky hands, Draco reached out to brush Harry's cheek and the smaller boy did the same with the other. Their breathing mingled also making it the first time since their last kiss for them to be this close. Draco was the first to lean in, gently brushing their lips together to pull back after the sweetness of the kiss had been kept sacred.
“I’d like to be with you” Draco said with confidence, hands cupping Harry’s cheeks.
"That's so incredible Draco! Oh I can't wait for you to begin." Sighed Harry with it muffled by Draco's jumper (that he stole back off Harry). "But," Harry began when Draco and he pulled away, "what does that mean for us?"
“I saved him, and I get hit!” Exasperated Ron after he had finished his piece of bread.
"M'kay, don't take too long though." Yawned Harry and Draco chuckled knowing the other man won't stay up till the end of the film.
Harry could tell Draco was scowling right now, "The record label decided I would have a larger audience if I told the world I was straight- because they were aiming for the market of females."
She gasped and did not see Draco's face saying do not say anything! "Ze 'Arry? The v'one you 'ave been writing to me about?"
The blonde turned to him with a sparkling smile, “I’ve known them since I was small. Our mothers are close, childhood friends.” harry nodded, still not very pleased with it. Even more so when Zabini called for Draco- in French, nonetheless. “Qu'est-ce que ça fait de rencontrer ton idole, Draco?” His tone was teasing and Harry assumed it was an insult at the French-boy’s scowl.
Harry stared around the room, trying to find a quiet place or at least somebody he had gotten along with on this skiing holiday. But then, his eyes landed on a person with the brightest blonde hair in Britain. Just as he took a step out towards the blonde beauty, the burning light brought only blindness then yellow dots to his face. There were people pushing him forwards and he kept saying "No, guys no... I-I can't sing! Look, I really can't-" But by then he was forced on stage.
"Draco?" Harry called, entering their shared bedroom... to find one of two wardrobes open, and the top draw of Draco's dresser exposed. No clothes. "DRACO!" Panicked Harry, calling and calling his name as he searched the house.
Today, the owl swooped in with Li and Abbot even more excited than he was! Its majestic, infinitesimal figure dropped another letter and flower to Draco. Putting the gifts on his table instead of in his lap due to the two girls at his side.
Harry knew who wrote that article, anyone who knew Draco's best friends (which was very few) would know who wrote that article. Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini had co-written it, just to spite him. Could Harry really blame them? He deserved it.
broke it.
One week to the task is when Harry snapped at Draco. “Why can’t we find anything? We are in a library, where are the useful spell books?”
Finally, he also visited Maria and Dean- and obviously the Weasley’s. With Dean he felt a sense of family and familiarity he didn’t know he missed until he had it back. Baking with Dean and his mother, having a water fight in Dean’s back garden, sitting and watching TV like they were a family.
That is what Harry wished happened if he actually plucked up any Gryffindor courage he was supposed to have. Instead, he backed out the hug not seeing the boy's expression change as Draco turned to celebrate with everyone else.
"Whenever I had free time, I should've spent it with you, I should've held your hand more and brought you flowers- thank fully I'm making up for that now. My righteous- I know, big word for me-" he smirked in Draco's direction, "thinking caused a good, strong, impeccable man like you to walk out my life." That caused more gasps and talking but their friends quietened them down to listen on, "The mess I made haunts me every time I close my eyes and I thank you for letting me clean up the mess I made.
“What’s the time mate?” Harry asked Ron for the fifth time since they walked down the stairs.
"What I'm hearing is I can still enter, with my birthday being in September."
I've dedicated my life to you, and I could never regret that. The D.L.B is still in full swing, selling your potions, receiving billions of galleons a year. The memorial they made for you, as a fallen war hero, is still up at Hogwarts. I go back every so often, speaking to some of the teachers, but I never had gotten used to the place without McGonagall, Sprout, Flitwick, Hagrid," his voice cracked at the giants name, "and even Trelawney.
On Tuesday he was sent a flower with no note. It was a Freesia flower. He understood the meaning: trust. The white ombre to pink showed the flush of colour on his face perfectly. Small hints of yellow decorated the white like a captivatingly burning blanket.
"Don't you dare think you can talk your way into my arms." He sharply bit, throwing another timber log into the flames listening to it as it crackled and sizzled.
Despite that, they were happy. They could begin a life, without a threat over their heads. "Nous avons gagné." Whispered Draco.
"Evening, Harry." Dumbledore said, his voice as wise as Harry had always heard it.
Smiling too, Harry almost wanted to feel guilty for it even if it wasn’t his doing, but he pushed that aside and imagined Draco’s reaction to it when he found out they actually did it.
If that was what Harry wanted, then Draco would obey his wishes. He left.
Draco sighed (
"You're actually here." Harry cupped Draco's face, suddenly noticing how un-wrinkled his hands were and he brought one hand to his face to feel no wrinkles there either. He let out a delightful laugh, brining Draco into a kiss that shone golden lines around them.
"Very mature, dad." Mumbled Harry as he walked towards his mum.
"I'm erasing myself from this inexorable narrative." He stated almost too softly to be human, "Let the Daily Prophet wonder how I reacted when you broke my heart."
Now, it was up to Draco. Should he say yes? Or... no?
Su Li wanted to be the first Asian female in English Wizarding World politics. He found that incredibly ambitious for Hufflepuff's, but greatly welcomed some more diversity in politics other than white. Kingsley didn't count to Draco, because Potter is the reason he is in power.
But Harry didn't care how everyone else was feeling as he brought the blonde closer to him. Cradling Draco's head in his hands pushed against his chest. Those lifeless, unique eyes still as can be. His once tinted pink cheeks in cold weather gone white. His platinum hair stained with the blood from his head. Crying and crying, Harry couldn't let go. He refused to let go.
Sighing, Harry opened a compartment door with only one person in it. He must admit, the blonde sitting in the corner was rather attractive. The boy had defined features, light skin, the brightest blonde ever and it was in a thin pony, curling at the ends. Not to even mention the silver, glowing eyes.
"No Potter, for once you are going to listen." He flicked his wand at the door successfully locking it with his own locking charm, "Our lives were planned before we were even born. I was going to be a good little Death Eater while you were going to be the Vanquisher of the Dark Lord. None of the stories pointed to a silver lining of us being together.
First to arrive was Durmstrang. Their boat emerging from the water, large enough to stretch from one end of the black lake to the other. Their coats were made of fur, looking extremely heavy, but all the boys carrying them like it was as light as the Hogwarts robes.
"Er- what is that erm..?" Sheepishly, the ginger pointed at the headphones then drew a diagonal line to indicate the wire finishing it off with a rectangle.
“We’ve been going for three hours Weasley, and I was awoken at 3am by you and the twins.” He yawned once more, moving so he was cuddled fully into Harry’s side.
"No. No I do not. Fleur, shut it." He ordered: Hermione, Ron, Harry and Fleur chuckled. This time, Harry kissed Draco on the cheek, making his redder than before.
Potter wanted to grin, but his stomach grumbled so loudly his cheeks and ears-tinged pink from embarrassment. "C-Can I have some-something, please?"
George sighed, “must be some crazed fan-girl as our defence teacher then.”
There was a letter too, even though Harry had not done magic! He would definitely tell Draco about this to see if he had any politely view. “’
asked for that divorce. Silent sadness in the night had began to dissipate, and the volcanoes simmered to dormant. He may not be living, but at least he's surviving.
"You know, it's a yearly tradition to kiss someone on New Year's." Whispered Harry.
“It makes you uncomfortable? I might die, because you’re no help at all, and you’re complaining that it makes you uncomfortable?” Draco’s face hardened and he packed his bag, “Draco- I didn’t mean-” But he couldn’t finish because Draco was already gone. One week to the task, and Harry drove his only help away. For that time, the blonde hung around with Zabini and Nott- Harry felt incredibly guilty.
James laughed, "You forgot about the party. Oh, have fun, lad." He patted Harry's shoulder while laughing.
"Draco!" Harry called out, waving his hand in the air. "Hey! Dray!" He called again, this time Draco stood still. Taking that as a win, Harry jogged to catch up. "So... you excited for the tournament?" He smiled.
When the cosy blankets, thick duvets and fluffed pillows arrived, there were many of them. Acidy, when Draco asked why there were so many, whispered to him, "So Mister Harry Potter feels comfortable."
Loudly, Draco complained. So, they settled on a dark, lacy read that still covered everything that needed to be covered but made Draco feel like him. Then, there was a pair of...
That was what led the two to stand on the Bridge to Hogwarts. Harry with his head leant on Draco's shoulder, Draco with his head rested on Harry's. During the war, Draco lost his father and his mother killed his Aunt Bellatrix defending Draco.
"I saved every letter you wrote me..." Draco whispered, knowing Harry could hear him even through the crackling of the fire he knelt by. But he shrugged, carelessly tossing one into the all-consuming flames, swallowing the meaningless words on the sinning pages.
Surprisingly, it was crowded with people, mostly middle-aged women. There was a line outside of the door, also all women, also all carrying books. The exact same books used for Defence that year too. “It’s a bit crowded in there Arthur; do you think we should look in the normal shop instead?” Asked Molly, keeping Ginny close.
Having enough of this, Draco took out his wand casting a weak flipendo. "Nice one Dray." Terry laughed. Justin did too, but still went over and helped Harry to his feet.
"Come get your pamphlets!" Shouted a man with slicked back brown hair who managed to snag all the free copies from a newspaper stand- Terry Boot.
At night, Draco was finally stumped on what to do. "I don't have another bedroom set up, Potter, and I suppose you wouldn't want to sleep in my room..." he paused, pondering over what to do when a quiet voice popped up.
"You know what Luna said, when she and Rolf came back?" He looked up, gaze focusing on the flames making his cheeks stiff from the dried tears. The fire had a burst of flames, "That I married an Icarus- and they flew too close to the sun."
