Potter followed behind Malfoy. At least he believed so. He ran up to someone and placed his hand on their shoulder, making them turn with a jerk.
Harry leaned forward to kiss Malfoy passionately. Malfoy released Harry's hand, now slowly working his fingers up to Harry's hair, clinging to it lightly.
"Potter, I think I should go-" Draco ducked his head into his dress shirt, avoiding any eye contact. "I'm not welcome in this bloody place. This was a mistake." Malfoy sucked in a breath, unable to even properly breathe in front of the students.
His eyes immediately cracked open, not waiting for another second to adjust to the lights as he turned his head to face Potter.
Another year, and what of it? It was just another agonizing year and everyone else would assume it meant a
The student stiffened immediately against the ground. Potter turned to face Malfoy that was sobbing on the ground, whimpering weak
incident, Malfoy's form now had scars upon his bare stomach. He never dared anyone to come close to him in his ferret form anyway, he didn't want anyone to see those scars and know who it was.
Malfoy's face started heating up. He couldn't exactly pinpoint if it was from anger or embarrassment; perhaps it was both. More like what are
Malfoy got a cube of sugar and began to stir it into his tea. Delicately, he blew on it slightly before taking a sip. The sounds of his dress shoes tapping against the floor echoed the quiet room.
Potter pulled at his sleeve to show his wristwatch before looking back up at Malfoy. "I've made my choice, Malfoy. This isn't a mistake. Don't be such a prat, alright? Just today, please?"
"It's a boy. You can actually tell just by the looks of it." Luna began to pet Malfoy, which he flinched away from her, small hissing could be heard if anyone listened hard enough.
He was a snow-white ferret, perfectly like an Albino as his hues were a perfect shade of grey to match his own. His small snout with a perfect shade of pink for his nose, his fur perfectly smooth like his perfect usual hair. He was mainly unregistered due to how- poorly he barely managed to pass it. Without a doubt, he didn't need any help, he did it on his own from start to finish.
"Draco Lucius Malfoy, the moment you saved my arse during the battle, I had a lot of time thinking about you. There wasn't a moment in my life where I regretted loving you. You were a sodding git the first I met you, but over time, you proved yourself to be much more than that. Much better. I want to be with you for the rest of my life. I just think you'd have a better last name as Potter if you ask me. You can gladly be Draco Lucius Malfoy-Potter."
"That's actually my pet ferret you got there. Ran away from me again." The man held out his arms to retrieve Malfoy.
Potter grabbed a hold of Malfoy's unbroken hand, placing his wand in it before making Malfoy curl his fingers around it.
"Pardon me. I must get going. If you could just-" He tried to pass them, only to be shoved roughly. For once in a while, he flinched away from them.
However, he got pushed away. Malfoy cupped his cheeks, tilted his head from left to right before laughing softly.
"You were chasing a ferret with your wands. Why is that? Have you gone mad?" Potter's brows knitted together, actually shaming them like a bloody
“What’s a bloke like you doing here?” He leaned closer to Potter. The smell of alcohol grew stronger from the man.
“Yeah. We weren’t really hitting it off. The Daily Prophet is going crazy about it as of now. Hence why I’m here in the Muggle world a lot. But we’re still friends.” Potter reached down to grab a cookbook as Malfoy continued to put books away like he does most days.
Malfoy wiggled his wrist out of his grasp, holding his wrist to his chest as if he got burnt, expression flattening like he was a kicked puppy. "I don't even know what the holiday is." He mumbled, mostly to himself. "You don't want to be with someone like me, Potter. I'm an arse."
Another second with Potter and he would've talked his ears off and Malfoy would never hear the end of it.
Draco sighed in relief and looked over at Harry, who had somehow gotten under his covers and was pretending to sleep. Draco smiled at him amusedly, Harry opened one eye and looked over at Draco. Draco had to put a hand over his mouth at the bizarreness of the situation they were now in.
Ron nods, his eyes seem a little watery but he smiles, not too wide but just enough to show me that this really is something that he is serious about. I sigh inwardly, hoping that this will work out this time and smile outwardly just because I'm a little happy.
"Ahh, okay then," Harry slowly maneuvered himself out of his bed and Draco shuffled over hiding his face a little. Was Harry really about to cuddle him to warm him up?
I open the library door and make my way to the back of the library, Draco is sitting by the window, looking outside.
"And you know what'll happen if you do it again?" I ask. I watch as his expression lights up as he reads into what I'm saying.
Blaise was lying as one of the unconscious bodies while a barely conscious Ron was now looking for his pulse. He relaxed and passed out from exhaustion once he located it through his panicked brain.
really Pansy? i have a mind to go tell potter that you have a crush on his best friend if you dont shut the F UP
We head to the Quidditch pitch first because we're already outside, after twenty minutes we conclude he isn't there, so we head to the owlery and he isn't there either.
"I think it says, 'I'm with Harry (Pansy) we think Blaise was under the imperious curse and tricked Draco into coming in here.' then there's a drawing of an arrow pointing to our left, indicating they wen that way I'm guessing," Hermione reads out.
has anyone seen harry or draco? I havent seen either of them since I found Harry in the ROR and told him to find Draco
The homemade heart-shaped chocolates were clutched in left my hand and a basket filled with picnic snacks, plus a few other supplies were in my right hand.
"Sorry I interrupted your sleep, I should get going now," Theo said stepping away from the bed, realising he still had his arm raised he let it drop awkwardly to his side.
"I think Blaise was under the imperious curse," Pansy says as a short explanation to me. "the person who put him under the imperious curse is not likely in the castle so we're going to the forbidden forest as that is most likely where they are," her reasoning could rival Hermione, they would make great friends... or a couple? hmmm... its weird not think of Ron and Hermione as together but I guess they really needed the breakup.
He probably started in the denial stage because he'd noticed when Harry's had looked at Cho, the Ravenclaw seeker, it had made him so jealous but he had hidden it pretty well behind a few snide remarks.
"what happened," I knew I probably wasn't much better, I knew Harry hadn't meant to make me think of the reasons as to why I wasn't able to cast a Patronus, the simple explanation was obvious, I had never had a happy enough memory, however, there was more to it.
Luna and Ginny were hugging each other both in relief that the fighting was over and using each other to prevent themselves from collapsing onto the ground and passing out from exhaustion.
I got back to the eighth year dorm late and found Blaise in my room, there hadn't been anyone else up when I'd arrived in the common room, the time being 1 am. Blaise was on my bed, just laying there looking up at the ceiling, his face was blank but I could tell he was hurting by the way his fists were slightly clenched, and his gaze was fixed solidly on the roof.
"I was right, I told you ages ago that your unhealthy obsession with one another was because you guys were unable to admit to each other that you had crushes on the other!" Pansy says excitedly.
Maybe Blaise was being considerate of his image? But that didn't make sense, he had only cared about his image earlier due to the instinct not to appear weak that had been ingrained in him via his father, usually, he didn't care what people thought of him anymore.
There’s another noise coming from outside, something like whispered arguments and hushed fragments of sentences that Harry can’t quite make out. Yellow light seeps out from under the crack in the doorway of the bathroom. He approaches slowly, unwilling to be heard.
“I’m not sure,” Narcissa says. “He’s not exactly in a state right now to be focusing on such things. That, I am certain of.”
“I don’t know if I’d call British foods blasphemous, but they are certainly not superior to Chinese.” Harry laughed, tucking a dumpling into his mouth and moaning at the taste. “So damn good.”
She offered a laugh, clearing the contents of his stomach with a flick of her wand. “Some people need to be reminded.”
Another day of June had passed, and Harry was still left with a whole summer ahead of him. His favourite season would be spent entirely alone if he couldn’t find a way to convince Draco to stay with him.
Harry clambers out of the trapdoor and approaches him as one might slowly inch toward an animal prone to spooking. Carefully, and without much noise at all.
“Er-I guessed?” Harry lied through his teeth, but oddly Malfoy did not push it. He was growing interested in the expanse around him.
“How the fuck do you do this every day?” Draco asked, bending down to tie his trainers. He ended up sitting down for a rest anyway, cross-legged on the concrete pavement.
It was rare that he envied other people, but she and Pansy were the picture-perfect couple amongst their group of friends. Only Ron and Hermione competed for that spot in the nauseatingly domestic haven they’d created. “The Burrow 2.0” was what Draco had called it, as though it were an insult.
“You wish, Potter.” Malfoy shook his head, putting the chart down “So, how was the night? Did you adjust to the new painkillers alright?” he asked
“A happy master is much easier to serve. Maybe there’s more Gryffindor stubbornness in you than I thought.” Soup sighed, sending the dishes to clean themselves.
“Much, much cooler.” Dana nodded, jotting down a few notes on Harry’s chart. Harry couldn’t find it in himself to argue that point.
Harry packed light for his trip to Amritsar. Hermione had arranged a long distance Floo trip from the consulate to Jahwar, and from there a Portkey to Amritsar would be on standby after they checked in with the magical community. He hadn't planned to take Malfoy along, but the man had his own business to take care of in the city so he doubted he'd be an annoyance, and if something was indeed wrong in Jahwar, it would be useful to have a Healer on hand.
He almost forgot Malfoy was there at all as they chanted the puja in front of the decorated stack of wood and dry palm leaves. His heart beat to the tempo of the chanting. The wood was set ablaze and he smiled as the night was lit up by the warm light of the fire, its heat licking at his face as he slowly walked around it.
Draco caved rather easily and pulled out his own cock, slicking it up quickly, and taking just a moment to enjoy in the incredible sight of his cock cradled between Harry's cheeks, sliding smoothly up his crack.
By popular request there is now a reading group on discord if you don't want to take the trip alone.
Between recovering from his latest near-death, wrapping up the case, setting up his transfer, and getting the proper training, Harry did end up missing the arrival of the new Auror recruits, but he made up for it by promising to join their training retreat in June.
“I want to try, I always learned better by doing anyway,” Harry replied. He probably couldn’t take another trip inside Malfoy’s mind after what he just saw.
“I would much rather have had a less interesting one,” Malfoy replied darkly. “I never seem to be able to stop working, a sensation you might be familiar with,” he added, setting up the pensieve next to the bed. “Alright, Potter, since I’m on babysitting duty again today we may as well put you to work,” he decreed.
“Looks like you had an interesting night,” Harry commented, getting busy with his breakfast while Malfoy ran his diagnostics.
“Well, I’m certain Andrews will understand that the department can’t always keep up with demands,” he commented casually, watching the poor boy start to sweat under the pressure. He would almost feel bad for it if it wasn’t so damn thrilling to watch him break. And he needed him to break, this wasn’t for fun, after all. He needed inside that room.
Draco had to take a second for his brain to catch up with the fact that Harry was actually saying he might like to be dominated, that Draco wasn’t imagining it. He saved all the enticing images that sprang forth in his mind to indulge in later, in private, maybe in the shower.
“You weren’t the only one, chéri,” Draco hummed, leaning down to give him a brief kiss, hoping to distract Harry from his admission. No such luck. Harry grabbed his hand, keeping him from leaving.
“Top notch investigative work there, Potter, what of it?” Malfoy asked, a hint of… annoyance? In his voice, Harry realized that his reply had absolutely nothing to do with the question that was asked.
Harry followed, wondering, not for the first time, why people insisted on bringing him along while they dealt with business he had nothing to do with.
“They are all signed by Healer Dana or Nurse Roberts as well, so unless you’re investigating them for falsifying medical records I’d say they stand.” Blaise waved the objection away with a casual swipe of his hand. That seemed to give the committee a moment of pause, some very pointed looks were exchanged. Draco felt a cold chill run down his back, were they going to disregard the reports and base their judgment on spotty testimonial evidence? But Andrews nodded “Fair enough, we’ll expedite the proceeding. The reports are still very incriminating” He pointed out, relaxing back in his chair.
Potter finally looked at him, meeting his eyes with something that wasn't hatred. Whatever it was, though, it burned just as hot, threatening to consume Draco if he got to close.
Harry's eyes kept wandering towards Malfoy's exposed forearm, the dark lines of the tattoo shifting under the light of street lamps. The staff cutting through the middle of the dark mark kept interrogating Harry on his judgement. Malfoy wasn't trying to hide who he'd been, but he was making a vow to be something different, and for a moment Harry wondered if he could be the serpent in the hand of Asclepius.
Harry woke up to a very intense game of chess being played over him, he doubted either of them noticed he woke up and for once he could appreciate just how intense Ron got over chess without being the one to get utterly destroyed on the board. They were both so into it, Ron hunched over the board and Malfoy sitting even stiffer than usual, the tension between them was palpable as they stared at the pieces calculating and strategizing before each move. He’d never seen the pieces be so quiet during a game, when he played they were very opinionated about his choices. He tried very hard not to resent tiny chess pieces for the blind trust they put in other people, Malfoy he could understand, he must have played a million games on that board, but Ron? Why were they so trusting of Ron?
He looked down at Malfoy’s hands, the small silver band sitting on his finger looked a lot heavier now. Those hands never got to hold his baby.
He still chuckled to himself when the git blasted himself in the face. If he was going to spend the morning knee-deep in mud, he was going to take any childish joy he was afforded by the universe.
I don't think any particular warning applies here, except the usual impending death but I believe at this point it goes without saying.
"I promised you, didn't I? Whatever you need from me. Somehow I doubt this one is going to be that much of a chore."
Out of all the people involved in the issue, the one who still seemed unsatisfied by the arrangement was Potter.
Draco brought out the good bottle of Ogden’s Old firewhisky and two glasses, setting everything out on the coffee table before curling up on the couch with the last update from the research on potion-based memory manipulation going on in northern France, he may never be able to do his own research but he could damn well follow the strides being made somewhere else.
Harry kept waking up through the night. Every time he fell asleep he’d start having weird dreams about dark rooms and boxes and odd smells and then jerk awake disoriented. At some point he gave up trying, he wasn’t sure what time it was but there was sunlight coming in from the window, aggravating his splitting headache, wasn’t he supposed to be under painkillers?
“Tragic sacrifice?” She laughed. “I’ll show you tragic.” She folded the paper back and pointed at the picture of the scene, a woman bent over Harry, casting the stasis.
He steepled his fingers in front of his face, his indexes resting on his lips as he mentally went over every test and its results again, Potter’s eyes on him kept him grounded somehow “I tested you for every possible trauma that could reasonably still be affecting you.” He started slowly, speaking his reasoning out lout usually helped and Potter just nodded along as he did.
Draco looked up at that and glanced at the small window on the side of the structure to see the light of day fading as the sun started to set. How many hours had he been working?
"I… Actually, I don't," Hermione told him sheepishly. Somehow it had been more important to find where he was rather than where he technically owned a house.
“Weren’t you off duty?” Harry teased him, an amused smile tugging at his lips. Apparently that was the wrong thing to say because the comfort and relaxation immediately left Malfoy’s stance, his expression closing off in the blink of an eye. It was like being hit with a bucket of ice water, he hit a switch and the warmth was entirely gone, like it had never been there in the first place.
“You know how it goes: they’ll pick through the records, interview your patient a little bit, make you sit through a hearing and then let you get back to work. You should be used to it by now, we’ve been doing this dance for almost ten years,” Blaise listed off how the procedure went. There was never anything of substance to it, just the desire to make Draco’s life difficult, and show the public how conscientious they were overseeing the deplorable element in their ranks.
(During his visit to Narcissa Draco reflects on the death of his child, the circumstances aren't explained. He considers the nature of a parent's grief, the fact that it would be the year they started hogwarts if they were alive, and how time can't really heal that loss.)
Harry dragged his hand up, through the nest of blond curls, to rest low on Draco’s belly as he placed a gentle kiss on his shoulder, listening to his breath gradually even out. The breeze from the window cooled down the sweat on their bodies and, as they lay together, sprawled naked on a massive bed with the afternoon sun making the warm tones that much more vivid, it sunk in how big Draco’s actions were.
“You will have to ask me again then, won’t you? And maybe do it properly,” There was the tiniest hint of a smile on Malfoy’s face as he started the spell again and all Harry could do was grit his teeth against the pain.
“Unless you have any more delightful surprises for us looks like it,” Malfoy replied with a small smile. “I’ll leave you to your breakfast, make sure to eat plenty, you don’t want to start on an empty stomach, the procedure is unpleasant enough as is,” he recommended.
"Which is explosively, horribly bad I imagine," Draco sighed, pushing off and walking closer to the window.
"You'll find out soon enough," Harry replied, too delighted to have such an easy way to get on his nerves.
"Oh, right." He fumbled with the light cotton until Harry finished tying his own head covering and took pity on him. Harry knew he shouldn't be finding Malfoy cute, but he was helpless and utterly lost and Harry was honestly having a good time watching him flail but try nonetheless.
The Weasley siblings, at least, seemed just as baffled as he was about the new developments. Everyone except for Ron, who all of a sudden seemed awfully chummy with Malfoy, talking in hushed tones in the corner, over mulled wine. Ginny was the first to come around when Malfoy mentioned Teddy making the team thanks to her training. From then on, he charmed the entire family in the span of one night, leaving Harry full of conflicting feelings of jealousy and warm sweet aching as he nursed the one glass of spiced wine he’d been allowed to drink. It was enough to make him a bit tipsy, mixed with the multitude of potions working in his body. He was sulking on the armchair near the fire, watching Percy discuss animatedly some ministerial policy or other with Malfoy on the couch when Charlie came around and leaned against the back, seamlessly joining the discussion, giving Malfoy that dashing smile of his. That was when Harry realized what was going on, what that twist in his guts was, the same he’d felt seeing Teddy launch himself into his arms. He was jealous, he was jealous and yet he didn’t want it to stop. He wanted to see more of Malfoy in soft sweaters sitting on the couch at the Burrow debating Percy. He liked the warm ache that filled his chest as he laughed with Ginny about the outrageous rumours spread by the press. He wanted more of it, he wanted it not to stop. He wanted Malfoy in his life, warm and at ease like Harry had seen him be in long-gone memories.
“Magical cores are akin to living things,” Ethel explains, wonder in her eyes at the subject. “They have desires, likes, dislikes, passions, if you will. If your core knows its pair, and you refuse to give it what it wants, it’ll destroy you.”
“So you can have a piece of your mother with you when you go, well, wherever it is you go.” Harry says aloud to no one in particular. He imagines Draco’s spirit standing behind him, putting a hand on his shoulder. That or maybe smacking him across the head for accidentally offing him in the Slytherin bathrooms. Probably a mix of both.
“Imperioserum is a suggestibility potion. While its effects are not as extreme as those of the Imperius Curse, one can still utilise it to control the desired subject. You cannot necessarily order someone to do something for you, but the potion amplifies instructions in the user’s mind, who then fixates on them until the task is complete. Long-term use is likely to cause erratic and paranoid behavior in dosed individuals, though we still do not know if there are other side effects,” Hermione said, her voice grave. “There is extensive information in your write-ups about this potion, and you are expected to brief yourselves in private, as it is too risky to do so within the Ministry at the time. None of this information should be shared with anyone outside of this room. We must keep this as quiet as possible until we are absolutely sure the situation is under control.” She looked to the group in question.
There’s something about the Manor at Christmas that looks entirely too cosy for Harry’s liking. Warm and inviting yellow lights glow from large bay windows, and Harry can see a Christmas tree, decorated with embellished bulbs, just inside. The estate seems alive in a way that it hadn’t been to Harry when he’d been here during the war. There is colour and life to the whole place that makes him uneasy. He thinks it's unfair that Malfoy lives in what appears to be a welcoming and enchanting home while Harry’s place is so cold that it looks like it belongs to someone else completely.
Harry crosses his arms over his chest, shivering at the name, and to warm himself more in the early October breeze. He shifts his weight, yellow and burnt orange leaves crunching beneath his feet.
“Oh,” is all Harry can muster, feeling distinctly out of his element and like he’s certain the last thing he wants to do is encounter either Draco or Pansy in the morning. “Pansy stays here?”
“Theo, he,” Draco pauses, clearing his throat before going on. “He didn’t have to, but he practically served my house arrest with me. I know it was only a year, and honestly, I deserved a far worse sentence, but he stayed the whole time. People have forgiven us now, mostly because they’ll do anything for free booze and parties, but it wasn’t so easy in the beginning, winning everyone over. We had to find ways to cope.”
“Biscuits,” Harry asks instead, pulling a plastic container out of the cupboard and placing a few on a plate in front of them. He waves his wand, and the kettle pours scorching hot water into a Chudley Cannons mug courtesy of Ron.
Lyra stretched out a wing languidly, letting the cold chill of October settle over it. The owl knocked at the windowpane a couple times with her beak, the glass letting out noises of annoyance at her inquiry.
Draco was silent, but he seemed to consider the words that had been said to him. He didn’t appear angry or hurt, but rather somewhat intrigued that Harry had taken such a stand. He wore a wry smile on his features. Harry could have marveled at him like that forever.
He realised he could probably ask Draco to do anything for him. And Draco would do it without hesitation.
He remembered the love in their garden. The way Draco’s gelled hair used to curl in the humidity of countryside summers. How little mites used to peck at their ankles until they were raw and itchy. Harry would pick at the scabs until they were red, even when Draco would bat his hands away and smooth aloe over his aching legs with the most delicate of fingers. Harry loved those moments, when he and Draco spread out a blanket in the grass and rested after a day of giving life to the plants around him.
Harry’s head snapped up, and he tore his hands away from his chest. Harry gathered a blanket from the foot of the bed and wrapped it around Draco, laying down next to him and easing him into his arms.
The potions classroom was clammy and uncomfortable as always. The heat rose even further when Malfoy entered with what Harry could only identify as his entourage. Zabini stood by his side, only slightly taller than Malfoy himself, but Parkinson and Goyle trailed behind. Oddly enough, Crabbe’s absence was almost tangible. The group seemed unusually disjointed without him.
Draco swallowed him whole and then eased back out again, flicking his tongue teasingly across the tip and meeting Harry’s gaze ardently. He hollowed his cheeks, sucking at Harry like it was his life’s purpose. Harry began to move, slowly at first, but increasing his pace and relishing how it looked to have Draco’s pink lips wrapped so beautifully around the length of him.
“Er, yes, he’s my husband, yes,” Harry said, finding odd words coming out of his mouth before he could stop them.
“Harry, please, I don’t think he’s breathing,” she gasps. Her legs have gone wobbly and unsure, and she leans her weight heavily into Theo’s body.
Harry’s surprised Draco hadn’t reacted much to the scalding coffee on his skin, but if he’s in pain he doesn’t show it.
“I’m assuming, since you’re here, you know at least the bare bones of this program,” Ethel says warmly. She waves her wand and a large, ancient-looking leather book appears on her desk. She licks her finger before heaving it open and turning a few pages.
Eventually, after promising himself to take a shower later, Draco dressed and exited the bedroom. Lyra followed happily behind. When he saw Harry’s back turned at the stovetop, something bubbled uncomfortably in his stomach. He couldn’t place the feeling, but it tugged at him incessantly as he sat down.
Draco pauses for a moment, tearing his eyes reluctantly away from the night sky to meet Harry’s. Harry finds himself feeling suffocated under the gaze, as though it burns him to hold contact for too long.
“There are charms, you know,” Harry says carefully. “To keep it alive, if it means something to you.”
In an instant, Draco had shucked away his trousers and flipped Harry onto his back. He watched as Draco pulled Harry’s own pants down to reveal himself already hard and leaking. Draco was red and flushed, and Harry was so painfully turned on at the sight of how disheveled he was. He never got to see Draco like this, and it was doing wonders for his imagination.
was quite obviously more dependable. It retained the added benefit of lacking in mention of Harry or himself respectively. Still, the breaking headlines stood out to Draco like fiendfyre, and he wondered how neither of them had caught a glimpse of it at the breakfast table. Maybe Harry had and declined to mention it. To be fair, their minds had been elsewhere.
Blindingly so. A kind of white that made one have to squint their eyes when being faced by it. The kind of white that was disconcerting and clinical and too bright to be natural or comforting.
Harry wanted to cry too, but the strength to do so had dissipated. Instead, he felt like a shell of himself, a ghost, sitting in his bedroom and letting Draco throw away the only thing he really had left.
Harry knew this was his chance to tell them what had happened. And it would test the strengths of his and Ron’s friendship once more. But Harry was aware that if he couldn’t open up with them now, he never would. He took a deep breath into his chest and told them what transpired the night before.
“I love you, you know?” Harry said, intensity written across his features. “I’m difficult because I love you.”
“I think I do,” Malfoy said softly, unable to tear bright eyes away from the mess of colors on canvas. He was lit up like Harry had never seen before. “It’s different.”
As Harry noticed, Malfoy had cleverly apparated them to the back, so they walked around the front to the entrance of the museum. The structure was even more imposing from the front, but Malfoy appeared uninterested in the exterior. They entered the museum, which was thankfully free of charge. Harry hadn’t thought to bring or even acquire Muggle money, but he was sure Malfoy had somehow already thought through that.
Draco is sprawled out on the sofa, his blonde hair matted unpleasantly to his slick forehead. He has a finger curled loosely around Theo’s hand, and his mouth is slack and open. Harry has a horrible vision that this is what Draco might look like in a coffin.
“I’m not,” Draco said firmly. “I’m a good person. I’ve changed,” he tried, hoping he was convincing his subconscious more than himself.
He was through both plates, a few teacups, and had moved on to scrubbing the counters when he felt hands press into his sides, and a head rest on his shoulder. Draco breathed a sigh onto him that made the hair on the back of Harry’s neck creep up unpleasantly.
Harry did, effortlessly lifting Draco into his arms, feeling the soft press of his erection into the gentle crease between Draco’s arse. Harry groaned at the sensation, rubbing slowly against him as he brought them to the table. He laid Draco out, more delicious than any meal served on its surface before.
Draco frowned, but shot Harry with a playful smile. “Then it's probably best that you do all the work, right?”
Harry couldn’t tell if Draco had spouted that from the potion, but he wanted to believe it more than anything. So he did.
“I don’t think that’s how the saying goes, mate.” Ron crouched next to him, and Harry jumped. Ron reached out, clapping a hand on Harry’s back. “Garden looks great, though!”
“You should have stopped,” Draco said, his tone dry. He wasn’t sure he could bring himself to be emotional about the situation. In the moment, he’d focused more on beating the voice than his husband anyway.
“Are you sure you’re alright?” Harry asked nervously, fidgeting with his wedding ring as he always did when he was uneasy. Draco wondered why a headache, of all things, would make him anxious.
He opened the envelope and quickly scanned the paper inside, as expected it was about his operation on Potter.
Healer Gupta remained to let the trainees watch Draco cast a Structural Support Charm and Deeper Vision Charm. Draco did his best to explain what he was doing and hoped Miss Rana could translate well enough to the trainees.
"Potter, am I happy to see you again. Ready to wrangle this bunch of excitable bureaucrats?" she asked with a smile that stank of dread.
“You have to use it for good sometimes. Can’t always be political scheming and manipulation of public opinion,” Draco replied casually with a half-smile, reaching for his wand and then hesitating when he realised both hands were covered in bodily fluids.
“Oh, no… I didn’t mean to imply… it’s just an honour to meet you in person, that’s all.” The man replied, stumbling through an apology.
“I hate lying to his face, the deceit, the—” he kicked his foot over the armrest of Blaise’s couch, settling his head better in his lap. “The performance of it all.”
“Not much. It’s like… a phantom sensation? Like when you can still feel it after something touched you?” he tried to explain it as best he could, while Malfoy traced his palm and his wrist with his fingers in a way that seemed designed to derail any coherent train of thoughts Harry might try to have.
"I'll never forget what you did. You're a bloody Death Eater. And you always will be-!" They watched Malfoy slowly reach for his wand, immediately taking action before he does, "
"This is humiliating." Malfoy peeled the sheets away from his skin and pocketed his wand. Getting up from the bed, he stumbled from the dizziness.
Potter grabbed a hold of the student, shoving them roughly off of Malfoy. Winding his fist back, he threw a hard punch against their nose. Grabbing their robes, he pulled them close to him. "Touch him again and I
"Bloody hell!" The person jerked back. Malfoy stumbled, regaining his balance as he scuttled back and away. And what were the odds that it was Harry bloody Potter?
Over time, people had gotten used to it. Mainly because of how protective Potter was when it came to the Daily Prophet and how he kept things hidden from them. Any other story about Malfoy and he would've punched the publisher right in the face himself.
Potter got up from his knee and kissed Malfoy deeply while people around the two began whooping for their proposal.
, he had dropped the book that was in his grasp. “Sorry. I-” he cleared his throat, retrieving the book with clumsy hands. “Dinner? With me?”
No one was very accepting of the two of them being a couple. Not because they were two blokes dating, but rather than the famous Harry Potter was dating a Death Eater.
Malfoy stiffened, sucking in a breath as he stopped his motion with his finger as his spoon idly fell. With a small hum, he closed his eyes.
Of course, Potter knew about this holiday. He spent most of his life around Muggles. Malfoy couldn't tell if he felt more bad for Potter or those Muggles who had to
With a shaky, yet, stiffened inhale, Malfoy turned to face Potter. Potter's eyes widened, being surprised by his own action. "Malfoy. I'm serious. I wanted to be with you before the next year starts."
With a shrug, Potter finally took a long drink of his Butterbeer. That was enough for him for the day.
Malfoy didn’t respond. Bringing his tea up to his lips, he continued to take small sips. Without his wand, he levitated the spoon and stirred once more, making circular motions with his finger. The spoon followed with the motion.
“Well, if he left and gave up his flat to be with you, most likely he’s with his Mother. You can send an owl.”
Out of anyone, Potter would rather spend his time with him? This was a joke. Someone set him up to this, act all friendly towards him, and laugh at his face once it's all over. He didn't want to be
"I owe you an apology. I didn't mean to scare you away. I wouldn't ever want to humiliate you like that. I was really in the moment and I shouldn't have snogged you like that. Hell, I didn't think anyone would notice or react like that."
Leaning away, he played it cool. “I’m just waiting for someone to return.” He yelled over the loud music.
Finally, with his free hand, Malfoy leaned over to run his fingers through Potter's sad excuse of hair. He began to style it with his fingers, making sure all hairs sticking up was flat.
Malfoy would comb his fingers through his hair, taming Potter’s messy hair. His fingers would delicately run over Potter’s stubble. He gave his cheek a light kiss before giving it a tap.
Malfoy laid flatly in the bed of the Hospital Wing, staring straight up at the ceiling as he clutched the bedsheets until knuckles went white.
Slowly, Malfoy relaxed his shoulders, feeling more tired than he already was as he seemed defeated. He didn't have the strength to argue anymore. "Is someone putting you up to this? To just humiliate me?" His voice was weak, now unable to look at Potter.
"We wait until the countdown to twelve and when it hits twelve, we just celebrate the new year. It's not much, really, think of it more as a tradition." Potter went to grab Malfoy's wand from the ground and gave it back. "Come with me to the Great Hall? We're celebrating it there." Potter held out a hand for Malfoy to take.
“Not what it-“ He scoffed, “what else does it bloody look like!?” Malfoy shook his head, tucking his hair behind his ear, and held up his hands.
With nothing coming out from either of their mouths, Malfoy sat across from Potter silently. Opening his lips, Potter was going to speak first, until the kettle announced itself.
“What does it look like, Potter?” He flicked his wand towards more clothes in their drawer. “I’m going back home.”
“Is that not what I said?” Potter’s lips twitched into a joking smile. That bloody smile. Malfoy’s heart swelled. He swore he was just having a heart attack.
Draco Malfoy was lucky enough to be alive and have the privilege to finish his year at Hogwarts. Others? Not so much. No one could bear to step foot in Hogwarts again.
Draco Malfoy's Animagus was a ferret. What were the odds of that? It was such a disgrace to be a sodding ferret. Malfoy would've guessed anything better. He would've even taken a
Quickly looking at the students, he found his answer. Mouths dropped wide open and many furrowed brows, all eyes landed on him. A handful of them even pointed and
With many dates between the two, Malfoy agreed to live with Potter in his own flat in the Muggle world. He had his main room, study room, and even a guest room. It was very welcoming to him, and Potter allowed him to take the guest room if he felt more comfortable. But Malfoy insisted they could share the same room. Thankfully, Malfoy didn’t own many things that could make their room crowded. And he was a very clean person; he would even clean the messes Potter had.
Potter moved away from the large crowd and sat himself down near the bar, waiting for his boyfriend to return.
“Do you think you’d like to get some dinner sometime?” Potter placed the book back, not entirely wanting to buy a book for today.
Potter slowly stood up, rounding himself to the other side of the table, and softly placed his hands upon Malfoy’s cheeks. Angling his head to the side, he pulled Malfoy close to kiss him.
So he did; as of now. Potter wasn't going to let this go. This was his business now. But, he didn't want to scare Malfoy off. "So, yes or no?"
"Well, the potion reacts with your brain so that you remain sane during the transformation..." Draco goes on to explain more about the effects and how often you have to take it, I blank out and start staring at his lips.
"He broke free! Get him!" one of the Death Eater's shout, I have no clue which, I'm too stressed out
Harry pulled her into a hug and whispered assurances in her ear which did little to stop her crying. He petted her head and tried to calm her with words such as 'I won't leave you' and 'it'll be alright'. He wished someone did this for him when he cried, which wasn't much anymore, he'd cried every night after the war for almost three whole months, no one had been there to see or help him through it.
Preposterous Potter. You are making me prepare for a date in less than an hour? why do you have to be so... arghhhgh. fine. Half an hour.
"Thank you, but we ought to be going, thank you for the message, by the way, Hermione, very informative," Luna says formally, catching Hermione off guard.
"Long enough to notice that you look adorable when you sleep, I couldn't bear to wake you." Harry blushed and ducked his head under the covers to hide his reddening face.
The group neared the edge of the forest, their eyes searching across the ground, in the trees, everywhere for just a trace of any of their missing friends. They saw nothing obvious.
Harry woke up to the sudden movement of Draco beside him, Draco was looking at Harry as he adjusted to his surroundings a small smile present on his face.
We go into the common room then up the stairs to Draco's room, there aren't many people but when they see me they bombard me with questions about where I have been, I shrug them off and hurry inside Draco's room.
Harry turned to go back to the dormitory, and a silver-grey glint caught his eye before disappearing.
Harry didn't cry, but his eyes dulled and he went blank, no emotion showed on his face, instead, he turned away toward the shower. He undressed and stepped into it, he didn't bother turning on both taps, just one on full blast. He didn't even notice whether it was hot or cold, he was numb, inside and out.
According to Luna, it was unlikely that they were in the castle and for some reason they had decided to trust her judgment, she had a sixth sense for this sort of things. Luna and Ginny had gone off to the right and Hermione and her group had gone left. They kept tabs on each other through their phones. Hermione had tried to use a few tracking spells but for some reason, none had worked.
As that death eater dies I hear a noise and with dread I let my gaze fall to a spot behind the men I'm fighting. Three more figures in dark cloaks and horrible masks stand behind them.
The moment he had heard that Neville and a few others were in the hospital wing he had decided that he was going to sneak in later that night. He wasn't going just because of his crush on Neville though, he was worried about Blaise and Draco. Despite having been distant with them from the start of the year, Theodore still cared about his old friends and didn't wish for them to be harmed in any way.
The 'mobile device' flashed sitting innocently on his bedside table and a new message appeared on the screen.
Draco shivered and hugged his arms around himself, and he watched as an owl flew away from its perch outside the window, somehow able to hear the swoosh of its wings through the thick glass. He continued to gaze through the window looking at the stars,  he can just make out his constellation shining down at Hogwarts and it reminds him of when he'd been told to memorise its whereabouts by his mother, she'd said it'd be a good way to make girls like him. He scoffed at it now, he had told Harry he didn't know his sexuality but in truth, he was gay, he has pretty much always known he was gay, from the moment Crab and Goyle had started talking about how pretty girls looked and whether they prefered bust or booty, whenever a similar topic had come up between them Draco had pretended to care, nodding in the appropriate places while lusting after the unattainable Harry Potter.
I'm pacing around my room trying to think where he is, but my mind keeps trying to think the worst and I don't know how to get the horrible idea of him being dead out of my head. last year during the battle at Hogwarts I remember when Hagrid carried Harry up to Hogwarts, proclaiming him to be dead, it took all my effort not to just cry right then and there, but my mum came to get me, I was too numb to argue. I will never forget that feeling, I had felt so lost, Harry was practically a rock in my life, he stayed the same, bickering every year.
"ahh, right," I had known he was getting to this question, "I told you about, the Patronus thing last summer yeah? you know there an assignment on is in DADA on it, I met up with, that person, in the library and he offered to help, it brought a rush of memories back and well, I ran, cowardly I know, and I feel bad now but I don't know how to fix that sort of thing, I'm not good at apologizing."
Draco fell to the leaf-strewn ground in a heap, his wand falling from his grasp, he'd only just been able to take in out of his pocket before the spell stuck him.
I watch Draco approach, he has a nervous smile on his face that is probably mirroring my own expression. Draco's carrying his broom and I'm glad he brought his, mine is lying to one side of the picnic blanket.
"You know," Luna says in her dreamy voice, "stars are kinda like love, they can shine so brightly sometimes that they're nearly blinding but you can't see them in the day just like how sometimes people lose track of what they love or like how some people are blinded by it," I smiled though it wasn't a perfect explanation I understood a bit of what she was trying to say.
"You have the most beautiful green eyes you know? It's really hard to see them properly with your glasses on." I blush and look down but he uses the hand still holding my glasses to tilt my head back up to look at him.
I haven't seen Pansy or Blaise either. not since i saw Blaise coming out of the forbidden forest earlier, it was weird he kinda looked unnatural, idk...
Madam Pomfrey shuffled around the room, checking on who was awake and seeing how they were doing after the ordeal they had all been through. She came around to where Harry and Draco were and they both greeted her. She told them to stay still while she cast a quick spell to check on how their bodies were holding up, she smiled and told them they could both leave and that they just needed to rest well over the next few nights.
Harry paused as he attempted to formulate a sentence that made sense in his head. "I can't say that I've liked you for a lot of years but I can say that I like you now. I was probably attracted to you at some point during my years here at Hogwarts, I mean I did spend all of sixth year following you around like a lost puppy," Harry laughed nervously, still holding onto Draco's arm.
"What! why would someone put Blaise under the imperious curse? and to take Draco?" I say, I'm getting frustrated now, what the hell is happening?
Harry thought about his eyes, he had beautiful eyes, the colour wasn't associated with evil yet green, green was a different matter. A dull ache entered his brain, he squeezed his eyes tightly closed, trying to shut out the pain. He shook himself, he deserved the pain, after what he'd done, those innocent people, lost, gone, all his fault. He opened his eyes and walked back into the dormitory.
"They're fine, they've been through a lot to get this far so I'm sure they can get through a date too," I say slightly annoyed.
Theo noticed that everyone seemed paired up with someone except Neville. Though the way the rest were paired was subtle, compared to Draco and Potter's way of showing it.
Blaise stands a few metres from the mess. His eyes blank, focusing on nothing. Pansy is trying desperately to figure out a way to get to Blaise and Draco without any of us being killed.
"Congratulations, I guess?" Neville says to the new couple before continuing on to himself, "seems like everyone has been paired off with someone except me..."
Blaise was leading him out the front doors while Draco thought things over, Harry was okay, it was fine, everything was fine. Except, it wasn't.
Cloaked-man numero(number) two steps forward he wears , "The dark lord is dead, and we will hunt down all those who betrayed him, oh, isn't revenge sweet," he draws the last word out and licks his lips as though he could taste it, then the man cackles crazily, his voice turning high pitched for a moment before turning into a hacking cough.
I need to find Harry and fix things with him, I could text him but I left the device thing that I still haven't named (hehe) yet back on my bedside table and I'm nowhere near there, I have potions soon though so I should see him there.
Draco thought back through the time he'd been with Blaise for the past twenty or so minutes, he really was acting weird, usually, he'd be more talkative and less uptight.
There are way too many emotions running through me, panic, excitement, nervousness, impatience and probably more.
"You were never a good son to your father, you disobeyed him, you disobeyed the dark lord. You're a useless and idiotic pawn who doesn't even know how to be loyal to anyone!" the man with the wolf mask hits Draco sending him sprawling across the damp forest floor.
"We have to find him, first I go missing now he goes missing, why can't I have a normal school year?" I ask myself in irritation.
Cedric, Sirius, Hedwig, Dobby, Fred, Tonks, Remus, Mad-eye and so many others, with unknown names, their families, broken after the war, incomplete.
They got out of their respective beds and waved to the other occupants. As soon as they left they looked at each other awkwardly, the medical wing had felt like a sanctuary where they could do whatever they felt, but now, standing outside its protective doors they were at a loss.
Draco's kiss isn't like any of that, it is hard and demanding yet it has a softness to it that feels completely right.
Draco looked up at Harry, his eyes conveyed something that Harry found impossible to read a combination of relief, fear and something else that He couldn't understand or comprehend.
"I brought you a green apple just because I remember you eating them all the time," I chuckle and hold out a green apple I brought just for fun.
It didn't take more than a few seconds and a well-executed Diagnostic Spell to find out the entirety of the girl's left lung had been Vanished and with it, a good chunk of the right. Draco weaved a strong Stasis and overlaid a Containment Spell before filling it with oxygen to help whatever was left of her lungs support her while Draco worked.
“Why don’t you go to France, Draco?” he murmured, aching tenderness bleeding into his voice as he watched the bone deep exhaustion coming to the surface on Draco’s body. “I know Laennec Hospital has offered you a position as a potion master there. You could do good work without having to fight every step of the way. You would have an actual career instead of being stuck in trauma for eternity.” He carefully picked the glass out of his loose fingers before Draco could think of refilling it again.
"I didn't try to off myself today, I suppose that must have saved me a lot of effort," Harry replied, unable to pass on the chance to make fun of him.
“You look like you have some news,” Malfoy commented. “Finally feeling good enough to venture outside your room?” He gave Harry a small smile, he looked pleased with the development.
“I’ve always cared about appropriate,” Malfoy argued, a slight twitch of his lip gave Harry a spark of hope, he was playing, wasn’t he? Harry just needed to figure out the rules.
Potter didn't answer. He just sat down on the bench in front of Draco and stared out towards the rapidly approaching coast of the island.
“I already said I’m sorry, and I’m going to fix it as soon as I can,” Ron defended himself to Harry who was desperately trying not to laugh.
“You’re complaining about boring dreams?” Malfoy asked him, an eyebrow raised making Harry burn under his implicit judgment.
The following week was excruciating, Harry barely got a glimpse of Malfoy. Hanson informed him the hospital had been hit with several cases of poisoning, which only worsened the ordinary chaos. To add to the general frenzy, the onslaught of accidental magic mishaps that normally hit around the end of September had come early this year. It kept the whole staff very busy. Harry was stable so he became a secondary priority. Healer Dana checked in on him daily but it was more making sure he was still alive than anything else.
“I’ll be there, I swear, and I’ll send a note to Pansy as soon as I get home, I just have to talk to Dana first.” Draco reassured him, apparently that was enough to convince Blaise to leave.
“Oh. Uhm. Would you mind if we spoke English, professor? My colleague’s French is a little rusty.” He asked.
“I do want to be a Healer, I can’t imagine being anything else,” he started, his thumb twisting the ring on his finger. “And being a trauma healer isn’t all that bad, but where I am now, professionally, is as far as I’m ever going to get here in London. I have a spot in France, I could be a potionist, do research… Blaise and my mother have been telling me to go ever since I trained there.”
“No…” Harry mumbled, looking away, he could swear he’d only seen him use his left hand to cast, but he couldn’t very well say that.
“You have horrible bedside manners” Harry told him “Especially first thing in the morning” He added, and that got Malfoy to look up at him finally, a familiar smirk on his face, warming Harry up under that look.
.” He explained, slowly hovering the plant over Potter’s feet and moving it up gradually, taking note of the changes in its foliage as it picked up on all that he already knew Potter to have been through, when it started giving up the ghost the closer it got to the point of impact of one of the killing curses Draco pulled it away. No point in burning it pointlessly, black walnut saplings like this were rare and valuable.
Harry huffed, Malfoy had tricked him again, Harry’d fallen for his misdirection and ended right in the trap.
“I kind of gathered that by the uniform and the fact that you are on the clock right now technically.”
“I’ll leave you in his capable hands,” she told Harry, then she turned to Malfoy. “Call if anything goes wrong and don’t overwork him,” she recommended.
"It feels like yesterday he could fit in the palm of my hand, and look at him now, already making questionable friends." He nodded towards the first step up the gazebo where Scorpius was trying to test his new broom with Hugo Weasley of all people.
There is almost no pain at all in this one. It's just cute and adorable and... I lied, even the fluff is painful, I don't know what's wrong with me, but it's mostly nice.
“I’d have to think about it.” He settled on, images of new research programmes already swirling in his head. As department head he’d have influence on the BOH, and with Moreschi at his side as CMO and Aadhya in trauma he could really affect some change in the profession.
It happened especially after sex. Harry wasn’t sure it had been an actual conscious decision on either of their parts, but he never found Draco’s walls up when he nudged his mental boundaries, basking in their combined afterglow. He never really thought about it until one day right before he left for the training retreat. They were at Draco’s, and Harry was floating on a cloud of warm bliss after getting the fuck of his life. He’d insisted Draco not heal the rope burns and, right then, he was cuddled up against Draco’s side, their legs tangled with the sheets. Draco’s arm was wrapped around his shoulders, his fingers drawing light patterns on his arm, probably following the imprint of the rope, luxuriating in the mark he left on Harry’s body. Harry reached out, slowly tracing the flower on Draco’s sternum, right in front of his face where he was resting his head on Draco’s chest. He felt the hitch in Draco’s breath at the first contact of his fingers and then slowly even out. He could feel the contentment and satisfaction radiating out of Draco, the undercurrent of pride soothing Harry’s mind, settling over his body like a blanket, pushing every doubt and shred of self-consciousness out and away.
“I think a kiss might do the trick.” Harry grinned, lifting his chin, waiting for Draco to close the distance.
I hope you had/are having a great Christmas day, if you celebrate it, and to all of you who don't, happy holidays.
“He’s got a direct line to the man making the supply, he’s got to be in touch with whoever’s running the operation. Harry can be our man in the inside,” Ron explained.
Hermione nodded, “Yes, I imagine dating a patient wouldn’t do much good with your standing with the disciplinary committee,” she agreed.
"Two days. Three and she'll be here with a rescue team. We might as well get comfortable. How long can you hold this up?" Harry nodded towards the ceiling.
“But he won’t come in and see me?” Draco said, unsuccessful in his attempt to conceal the sadness of his tone.
The question lingers in the space between them for a moment before Harry really lets it sink in. Because honestly, he can’t be sure. It’s easy to say that he’s only doing all of this for his soulmate because that is, truthfully, what he’s been told is required of him. Though now, he’s not so sure. It’s not that he pictures something romantic with Draco, but he can’t deny that there is some semblance of attraction there. Harry feels protective in a way that he's not sure is only a result of their shared connection, and it's beginning to scare him.
“They weren’t always terrible. They never put their hands on me, you know, physically.” Harry looked at Draco, but he only looked away. “Even then, though, they locked me in a cupboard for the first ten years of my life. That did hurt. My back would always ache the next day, and when it would finally stop, I’d be back in the cupboard after supper.”
The statement had been one he’d come to repeat often in the weeks following New Year’s Eve. Draco had practically moved into Grimmauld Place, and with him, he brought light and joy to both Harry and the home itself.
it’s not an ideal situation, but it’s not my fault Malfoy.” He felt his ears go a little red and realized he hadn’t meant to be so defensive.
He dresses quickly and with purpose, knowing exactly how he’s going to spend the day and feeling entirely too good about it. He considers taking the Floo or Apparating, but something about the Tube on a cold day seems far more appealing. Harry likes a train ride and to be alone with his thoughts for a quiet minute.
Professor Dumbledore sits unobtrusively in front of Harry but does not speak. When he glances up and meets the older man’s eyes, his expression is impassive and unreadable. Harry isn’t quite sure what is going on, but something inside of him prevents him from asking.
“Look at you, Christ,” Harry breathed, snapping his hips up in quick succession, and the fabric between his teeth muffled Draco’s whimper. “All mine.”
He’d thought about killing himself, ending his suffering, for ages by the time he actually attempted to. But earth-shattering headaches kept him from acting upon those impulses. He knew it was the worst pain he would ever feel in his life. Something far worse than the most terrible kind of torture imaginable.
“Hello,” Harry said cautiously, reaching out to greet the pair across the coffee table. He withdrew it hastily when neither of the two offered anything back. “I’m so sorry for your loss,” he said with an earnest and searing resolve, hoping the family would understand how truly he meant it.
“Ah,” Harry responds, feeling stupid for having questioned him. He bites his tongue, unable to stop thinking about how irresponsible it is for Draco to come to the Ministry wired out. He must still be feeling the effects from the night before.
It instilled a sense into him that she wouldn’t lie. This wouldn’t be some Skeeter nonsense to mislead the public after all.
A porcelain teacup sat lonely on the coffee table, and Harry’s books scattered in a display across its surface. Clearly, he had spent the latter portion of the afternoon working through a new stack. For someone so uninterested in his studies at school, Draco wondered how Harry managed to sit through the monotony of Muggle nonfiction.
A heavy tension settled over Harry’s head like a cloud as he and the rest of the room came to terms with what was at stake. Failure to solve this case could mean another war, another Voldemort.
Harry knew the look in Ginny’s eyes. He had dated her fleetingly but had spent hours observing her during the time. Her inquisitivity was never genuinely innocent; rather, it was coated in a layer of suspicion and distrust.
Harry pulls up a barstool at the island, and Hermione stands across from him, her arms folded over the length of her torso.
“Yes, and so does Ron.” He steadied himself next to Draco at the trunk of the tree. “But the reason they know is because I’m serious about this, like really serious. I panicked because I thought we’d made a mistake. But that should be proof enough to you that I want you.”
Draco, dozing at his side, was breathing softly into a pillow. He’d thrown the comforter from his upper body, which was uncharacteristic of him. It was rare that, even in the throes of sleep, he would let himself lie so visible like that. It was why he locked the door when he bathed. It was why whenever they were naked, it was always in the dark. Always,
“Hello,” he said politely, accepting the drink with a nod of acknowledgement. He spared a glance at Harry, who nursed a stout at the bar without any intention of leaving.
“According to witness reports, she did it right here in front of everyone. Floo’d directly into the Gringotts lobby, walked outside, and then it happened.” Ron eyed the scene warily as wrinkles creased his forehead.
Harry shrugged his shoulders, hoping it hid rising panic. He bit at the inside of his cheeks, feeling the soft skin turn rubbery and raw underneath the press of his teeth. It wasn’t long before a bitter and metallic taste spread over his tongue. Even still, his voice wavered. “I can’t lose you.”
“Good morning, Mr Malfoy,” she said, the perfect picture of an imperious Healer when Narcissa was around. She shot him a wink anyway when Narcissa greeted the others in the room.
The Mind Healer, a lovely woman in her mid-forties, had given him a pitiful smile and a shoulder squeeze. “He can be both depressed and Draco at the same time.”
“I mean you practically were,” Harry says, thinking back to Hogwarts when he was entirely taken aback at Draco ranking second best in their year to Hermione. But if there was one thing he knew for sure at the time, it was that Draco Malfoy was never unintelligent.
“It’s so very nice to meet you, Harry.” Portrait Draco says back, puffing his shoulders out dramatically. Pureblood kids are such a type, he chuckles to himself.
Harry wonders when everyone has begun to accept him as Draco and not Malfoy. And while he’s certain he knows why he’s never been invited to one of these events, he can’t help but feel a stab of jealousy at the fact that everyone has been getting together without him. If Luna and Neville know, Harry guesses that Ron and Hermione might as well.
He looked away, face reddening, hoping that his wool coat, which was arguably two sizes too large, was concealing most of his frame. And maybe the knitted cap that Molly had gifted him for Christmas the year before was covering up a shock of platinum blond hair. Really,
“There’s no need to apologise,” Malfoy says with a wry smile. He perches on the chocolate settee, across from Harry, and a Glencairn glass appears atop the surface of a wooden-bound book. Malfoy swirls the amber liquid around inside, giving it a tentative inhale, before placing it back down on its perch. “Although, I wouldn’t mind an explanation if there’s one you would be willing to offer.”
He stands quickly, the chair rattling against the floor as he pushes it aside, and a crazed laugh escapes his lips.
Harry’s egg is just starting to brown when Draco pulls him into his arms. He’s taller and longer than Harry is, but much smaller, somehow. He still has so much weight to gain back but seeing colour in his face for the first time since they’ve met is enough for Harry to feel a bit better about the whole affair.
Harry puffed out a laugh and set to preparing breakfast, something even a potion-dosed Draco did not care to do.
It had probably been an hour or two after Draco had left him alone that Harry noticed. He listened for the crack of a twig, the soft crunch of a leaf jostling underneath the blanket, but there was nothing. The air around him was eerily silent.
“He does, you know!” Seamus defends, sliding a drink smoothly into Harry’s open hand. He can already smell how strong it is without putting it to his nose at all. “He’s changed a lot since the war.”
Harry knows he pauses for a moment too long before answering, but he’s never been able to lie well to Luna, no one really can. “I’m fine.”
Harry felt himself light up at the statement. He’d always loved a possessive man, but Draco was always another level. It was comforting and painfully arousing, to see him eye Pansy’s touch like a personal challenge.
Now that Harry’s come to think of it, he hasn’t seen Blaise interact with his friends from school much at all. He recalls that Blaise and Pansy used to be very close, and wonders what happened to all that. But people grow out of people and that was the way things went sometimes.
“I’m just saying next time you should probably be a bit more careful about accepting mystery pills from your school bully slash soulmate,” Ginny points out.
Azalea sits in the front row flashing both Harry and Draco a genuine smile. While she’s still a closed, reserved kind of woman, she cares for Draco in the way that Narcissa hadn’t much when he was a child. She’s the reason why Draco’s managed to be sober for so many years. The wedding wouldn’t be complete without her there.
“A friend of mine at the Ministry. She’s not affiliated with my department, but I think she could really help you,” Harry says earnestly.
Draco barely startled, always a heavy sleeper. Instead, he burrowed into Harry’s chest like he was coming home. Harry carried him to bed, but didn’t take his clothes off. Draco would be upset if he did. Instead, he tucked him comfortably onto one side of the bed, and Harry climbed as softly as he could into the other.
“I want you to be able to tell me anything, without thinking I’m going to resent you or get mad.” Ron said firmly, “I want you to know that”
“Stuffed peppers for dinner?” Harry mused, reaching a hand out for the vegetables. They hadn’t eaten something creative like that in a while.
Usually, Draco anticipated anger and frustration to characterise the beginnings of his days, but something in his mind had clicked into place. He, or something inside of him, was determined to break a typical cycle.
“You don’t have to pretend,” Lavender chuckles, looking down at Dean with affection. “We all have our priorities.”
“Your boyfriend, then?” Carrow scowled, angling back to Draco, who had attempted to put space between himself and the increasingly strained situation. Carrow took a slow step forward anyway to close the gap.
He’s taken aback when he opens the front door to reveal Draco bundled in an oversized coat with a cosy maroon scarf wrapped multiple times around his neck. Flecks of white snow dot the knit cap and strands of blonde hair that peek out from beneath. His face is a flushed pink, as though he’s been out in the cold for much longer than is ideal.
He’d thought about the idea of turning Harry in, because, well, what he’d done had been all kinds of profoundly illegal and manipulative. But Draco couldn’t bear the thought. Harry was sick. He didn’t deserve punishment; he needed help. And Draco would only be stooping down to his level if he were petty enough to play the revenge game.
Blaise slowly ran his hand down Draco’s spine. “Draco, Potter knows perfectly well what kind of man you actually are. I don’t think he has any illusions about you, he’s seen the good and the bad and he still wants to trust you, after witnessing you at your worst. And he’s right to do so because you
"Oh, no, Sādā Sāpa has property to oversee," Taranjit told him, taking out a folder from a messenger bag. "All the paperwork is in order and the restorations were made according to direction," he told Draco, handing it over.
Harry was left with a small smile, wondering whether she liked him or not. She did spend her break with him, keeping him company, but she’d been full of fire about the inconvenience he was causing by being there and attracting attention. He managed to catch a nap until lunch, blessedly void of nightmares and keeping him from dying of boredom. Malfoy had promised a chessboard but had never come back… He did have other patients to attend to. He just wished he’d come back.
Who somehow had slithered his way into a friendship with Hermione and by extension with Ron when Harry hadn’t been paying attention.
“How does that just come up in casual discussion?” Harry asked once he managed to get his breathing under control.
EDIT (08/01/2020): As I prepare to post the last few chapters of this work I'm coming back to do minor edits.
Saturday night he couldn’t sleep. It was too hot and humid; something must have been wrong with the weather control spells in his room. It couldn’t be by design unless they planned to sweat his ailment away, and what was it with the smell of pond? Was St.Mungo’s that close to the river? When he finally managed to sleep a little, he dreamt.
“And you’re still convinced it’s a bond?” he asked unconvinced. Harry nodded confident in his assessment of the situation, it was just a very boring one.
“I wasn’t sure you were even listening,” Harry admitted, looping a finger in Draco’s belt loop, pulling him closer, “or that you actually cared.”
“If I didn’t put everything in the reports they would call it falsification of medical record and have my job.” Draco reminded him “But it’s ok, it’s done. I will invest these three days into taking care of myself and get back to doing my job once they decide how they’re going to deal with my transgression.” Draco sat on one of the plastic chairs outside the conference room “There is no real damage done, Potter’s with Dana either way, and with you at my back I always land on my feet.” He gave Blaise a small smile, but he still looked unconvinced.
Hanson walked in not too long after, bringing him breakfast and the latest news. Lately, Fashion Week was the main interest of all the news outlets, and today was no different. Apparently, someone collapsed last night on the runway, causing a commotion.
Departing the following morning was surprisingly emotional. Griffith in particular insisted on thanking him for the guidance in the past few months and asked for Draco to put in a good word for him with Wizards Outside Nations.
That got Malfoy to raise an eyebrow and sneer at him in a way that finally felt familiar. "You're one to talk to me about having a saviour complex? You, Saint Potter, martyr for us all? Come off it!"
"Draco ji, I hope you're ready to work," she replied with a polite smile. Today's hijab was tucked tightly around her face, utilitarian, in a light sand colour with little decoration, a garment for a woman indeed ready to get to work right next to him.
Harry laughed at the utter outrage on Malfoy's face at the idea that Harry would bend his entire life to avoid him.
Draco looked up and frowned at McReary’s smiling face at the window. For some reason, he was convinced Murphy would be in. He shrugged, McReary was better. He was fresh out of training, eager to please, still not used to being a full-fledged healer, easy to manipulate.
“But you’re afraid Potter’s not going to see it that way.” It wasn’t a question “You’re afraid he’s not going to forgive you once he finds out.”
Harry tore his eyes away from the entrancing sight of Draco’s pink cock disappearing in his fist, and looked up to see the way Draco’s blush travelled down to his neck. His pupils were blown wide with arousal and Harry’s hand stuttered when Draco’s eyes fluttered shut and he tilted his head back, baring his neck.
Malfoy had the presence of mind to catch the boy in his arms as he crashed into him, his robes enveloping Teddy almost completely as he took a step back to absorb the force of Teddy’s impact. What happened next sent Harry spinning. Malfoy smiled, like an actual human being, upturned lips and crinkling eyes as his face filled with warmth, his hands rubbing Teddy’s back “hello, Edward.” He even nuzzled his hair a little with a familiar intimacy that left Harry filled with confusion and strange unnameable feelings all twisted up inside him.
“I know, but I don’t think I really knew what I wanted back then, I went into law enforcement because it was the path of least resistance. People expected it of me and I didn’t hate it,” Harry replied, pushing the chessboard aside, this wasn’t a conversation to have with barriers in the middle.
"I'm sure you will," Draco replied, pride filling his chest. He glossed over the fact that his own father had bought his way onto the team. Scorpius wasn't paying attention to him anymore anyway, already running off with Hugo, offering him a turn on the broom. Pansy joined him under the magnolia, she brushed a hand down Astoria’s back as she headed to the gazebo to take over hostess duties.
After leaving Potter’s room Draco went back to his office. He had a report to write to the Auror department, detailing Potter’s status and the estimated time he was going to be unfit for duty. Threading the line of patient confidentiality on those was always a delicate balance, especially given the fact that if he didn’t make it stringent enough Potter would try to work around it and get back in the field before he was ready. On the other hand if he gave out too many details it would most definitely get leaked to the press and make a pr mess for him to deal with.
The press of Draco’s lips at the small of his back distracted Harry from the tingling of a deep Cleansing Spell, leaving him empty, fresh, and alight with the energy of Draco’s magic lingering in the air.
Draco held back when they were joined by the rest of the delegation in the elevator. There was another Healer that came along from St Mungo's, an old Charms teacher, specialised in "exotic" magical practices, and one other Auror forming the bare necessary security detail for any journey abroad with an ambassador of England. All of them were quite happy to let Draco pretend they didn't exist and return the favour. Not Granger, though. She was dead set on making him bond with everyone as soon as possible, which was probably a good idea for the successful completion of the mission, but Draco was still lagging after the Portkey jump and entrenched in a defensive position, which wasn't the best for making friends.
Struggling through the bit of Hindi Harry had picked up from the Patils and Healer Gupta's considerably better English, aided by Yuvarani's intervention when needed, Harry learned more details about the situation they were facing with the splintering of the magical community.
The silence stretched between the group broken only by the muffled sound of strings coming in from the main hall.
Malfoy glanced up when he heard the girl behind him address Harry and waved his free hand in a placating manner.
“Still. It made my job easier.” Draco replied, shaking his hand and walking him out. In the morning he would start experimenting on Potter. If it wasn’t tragic and put his career on the line of complete annihilation it would be hilarious. A completely new case to study, it would be the opportunity of a lifetime for anyone whose name wasn’t Draco Malfoy.
“I hear we’re short stocked,” Draco mentioned casually. “I’ve got a list here from Andrews, mind if I take a look and see what I can substitute?” he asked, the lie falling easily from his lips, smooth and casual enough not to be questioned. Dropping Andrews’ name instead of Ross’ upped the stakes just enough for the boy to feel the pressure.
"Well, now I'm sorry for a different thing, Malfoy, it's my job to keep smugglers and less than reputable dealers from getting into hospitals, you see?" Harry retorted.
“I’m going to become an Auror like my mum and my godfather.” He announced, puffing out his chest. Dana chuckled.
“You can’t hurt me with anything you find in there, Potter,” he replied softly, like there was something Harry couldn’t possibly understand. “I know who I am and I’m not hiding, not from you, not from anyone else.” He gave him a smile so kind, Harry felt crushed under it.
It was on, then. They chased each other around the square, gradually turning into unrecognisable rainbows, until they were out of breath and giggly, looking at each other with powder smeared everywhere. Malfoy shook his head and a multicoloured cloud fell from his hair, prompting more giggles from the both of them.
"Who are you?" a man draped in light linen clothes asked as soon as they approached the outermost structures.
"Draco, you're turning twenty-eight this summer," Pansy told him softly, refilling his glass with something that definitely wasn't lemonade. She offered him a piece of ice cream cake as if that could in any way sweeten the bitterness of the truth.
“A little past noon, late enough for the Prophet to have come out with a special edition about the sting yesterday,” Draco replied, slapping said paper against Ron’s chest and going to sit on the chair next to Harry’s bed.
Malfoy looked so peaceful, still asleep next to him, the gentle sweep of his eyelashes on his cheeks inviting Harry closer.
"Do you really think I don't know that? I've seen it, I've been living alongside poverty and hunger for years." Draco frowned, Potter knew this already, "I reconstructed a child's lungs just last month, Potter."
“How do we work around that though, we still need to get rid of the residue to operate on the patient?” Dana asked.
Harry was only too happy to oblige the desperate plea with a messy wet kiss. It didn’t take more than a couple more strokes for Draco to spill over both of their hands, with a grunt that Harry greedily swallowed, pulling back only when he felt Draco’s cock start softening.
“I’m sorry,” Harry murmured. It seemed too little, but he couldn’t not say anything, let that pain lie.
“What are we working on, Healer Malfoy?” Brown was the first to catch up to him, a bright young Hufflepuff, hardworking and good at taking directions, slightly lacking in leadership skills, but that was relatively easy to fix, unlike Bingley’s many flaws.
“We’ve done some fucked up things to each other, haven’t we?” Draco whispered, giving Harry a bitter smile.
Draco had done what none of them could, always just a smidge too late for it to matter, never in the way they wanted him to. He’d gotten Harry Potter to kneel at his feet, achieved Voldemort’s most secret desire.
Before Harry could ask for more or get lost in the indescribable feeling written on the planes and lines of Malfoy’s face, Healer Dana walked in with a set of vials and a bright smile.
"I've been thinking about it ever since we went to Gharapuri Island. It's not the land connecting everything, it's the water; the rivers run across India carrying life from the mountains to the ocean. My father had these mirrors, a pair, made and polished together, that he used to speak with Sirius when they were away from each other."
After a while he seemed to grow annoyed with his hair, constantly getting in his way. He produced a long pin carved in dark wood and pinned it up. For a split second, Harry thought it was his wand but that would have been a step too far into the absurd. It was something Harry would have done, Mr I-carry-my-wand-in-my-back-pocket, not prim and proper Malfoy, who apparently carried hairpins in his uniform pocket and could do his hair up perfectly without even looking into a mirror.
Draco sighed, setting the mug down. Soup was a clever little creature, ambushing him with cutting questions in the morning before he’d even finished his coffee “We’re not having this discussion again, Soup. I picked my battle and I’m seeing it through to the end. Sometimes my job is hard but it’s what I want.” He told him with no harshness behind his voice.
After a few minutes the wrinkly face of Charles Bonhomme appeared in the mirror, his dark eyes glinting behind wire rimmed glasses as he smiled at them from a high-backed armchair.
Malfoy didn't argue, bending down to remove his footwear just as readily as Harry did, but the way his toes curled at the contact with the cold floor betrayed his discomfort.
Draco hummed, tilting his head back like a cat when Harry ran his fingers through his hair, trying to mess with the curated perfection of its styling.
“She was here earlier, said everything looked fine and then went on to do her rounds.” He replied. Malfoy nodded in thanks.
That was how they ended up, the three of them, standing right outside of the wards of Grimmauld Place. Volatile was a very euphemistic way to describe it. It looked like a storm in a snowglobe, the house seemed turned almost liquid on the other side of the ward, warping and changing with every second they looked at it. Harry didn’t know what to say or to think. He had never been overly fond of the house, there were a lot of painful memories there, the shadow of war in every corner, but it had also been a safe haven. It had been the fleeting dream of freedom from the Dursleys when Sirius offered to take him in, a roof over him, Ron, and Hermione while they were on the run, a house to welcome Teddy in. And they’d worked so much to make it a home. Despite everything, or maybe because of it, Harry felt a clench in his heart at the thought of losing it.
Pansy gave him that look like he was missing the obvious, that small tilt of her head and twitch of her lips that spoke volumes. She shrugged off the light summer robes and revealed the corset underneath. It was paired with a skirt with a dizzyingly high slit showing off her legs and thigh high boots with way too many laces to be practical.
His hand went up to rub his chest, his wand abandoned next to him on the bed. It felt hollow now, like the feelings he’d been filled with had left him empty now that they were gone. There was something missing.
They grabbed their food and found a nice spot on the beach to eat, looking out to the sea, gently lapping at the sand.
Pansy smiled at him when he walked out of the fireplace. “you thinking about coming out like that?” She asked, sizing him up as if she hadn’t dressed him herself in the morning. “It suits you but you’re not taking the robes out to a club before I debut them on a runway.”
“Go out with me.” Harry hadn’t been sure what he was about to say until it was out of his mouth and by then it was too late to take it back. He expected the silence to stretch tense and awkward between them for time infinite but instead, Malfoy’s answer came quick and unforgiving.
“Take a wild guess who's name isn’t mentioned,” she asked him, folding the paper back up. Harry didn’t need to. “I suppose ‘
He looked up and saw the towering arches of the Gateway of India. A cold shiver ran down his spine as his eyes followed the cut stone up to the plaque.
Harry delicately pushed deeper inside Draco’s mind. He found no resistance as he waded past the haze of fondness and affection that coloured Draco’s thoughts in that moment.
What concerned him, now that he’d inspected the latest addition to his body, was a strong itch to take a walk. He’d been cooped up inside his room too long.
He slowly became a fixture at the weekly tea at Malfoy Manor, and Draco did the same for monthly dinner at the Burrow. Harry suspected it was less about him and more about having an excuse to hang out with the children. Draco was steadily climbing the chart of Dominique’s favourite babysitter, him speaking French was an unfair advantage, but Harry was still Rose’s favourite, and that was all that mattered.
"Do you have an answer?" he asked softly, the crash of rain and wind right outside filling the silence between them.
"Then keep me awake," he grumbled, pushing himself up to sit straighter. "Tell me about Amritsar. Have you been before?"
He used his free hand to quickly unbutton his shirt, stopping when he realised he couldn't undo his cuffs one-handed.
