Draco doesn’t say a word. He’s got his shield back up as the emotions run wild in his body. The look of Harry when he fell was true. It fuels Draco’s nightmares. Until he screams himself awake. Draco wishes he could erase them from his mind. Those final moments when Harry fell. If only he could have held on to Harry a little longer. Adrian was close by. They could both have survived that accident. Nobody would have blamed him for saving Harry, or questioned his alliance. Everyone knows the Dark Lord had wanted to be to one to take Harry down. It would have been wise to make sure Harry survived the accident.
“He has my mother,” Draco says is a soft voice. Harry smiles at him and then leans in. His lips gently brush against Draco’s mouth. “I can’t let her die because of this,” Draco continues when Harry rests his forehead against Draco’s.
“You two are unbelievable,” a voice says from behind them. Harry lifts his hand and shows Neville his middle finger.
“You love me,” Malfoy whispers. He sounds so small and frightened and Harry has to look at him as he confirms it once more.
The manager of Flourish and Blotts wasn’t happy that he had to get two more Monster Book of Monsters for Hermione and Draco. I found out that I already have it, it was Hagrid’s birthday present for me. The manager had to put on a pair of very thick gloves and used a large, knobbly walking stick to get the books out of their cage. He was happy that he only had to catch two and not three. All three of us also bought Unfogging the future for Divination and Draco got the books he needs for Ancient Ruins. Hermione had to buy so many books and she loved them. She’s taking Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination, Ancient Runes and Muggle Studies. Draco said that was impossible, but Hermione showed us her book list from Hogwarts and the books were really on there.
“No, finish it,” Hermione says. “Why would I shorten it? I need to have all the information in here.”
Hagrid showed us some shining silvery stuff on the ground. It was unicorn blood, meaning a unicorn was hurt and we had to go look for it. He said he found a dead unicorn last weekend. Draco was afraid that whatever had killed the unicorn would find us first. But Hagrid said we would be fine if we were with him or Fang. We were split into two groups. I was going with Draco and Fang, while Hermione and Nott went with Hagrid.
“They are your favourite,” Draco stutters. Draco never stutters. He’s always sure of himself, composed and calculated.
On my way up the stairs, I was called to the side by Fred and George Weasley. I talk to them now and then. They are pretty fun and I haven’t forgotten how they were the only ones last year that didn’t buy for a minute that I was the heir of Slytherin. They had an early Christmas gift for me. I don’t know why they gave it to me, but I’m really grateful. Fred said that they had decided that my need was greater than ours. Something about not wanting a moping Draco to ruin their time in the Three Broomsticks. And that they know it by heart by now and don’t really need it anymore anyway. I don’t know what they were on about, but what they gave me was amazing.
Harry looks down at his hands. Of course, his dad is going to be upset about the game. It’s the first game Gryffindor has lost since Harry joined the team.
The next day Nott followed me around the castle and I was afraid to go to Myrtle’s bathroom to talk to her. She was the only one left in the castle I could talk to. Isn’t that pathetic, Hermione is away for the holidays and I’m left with only a ghost of a dead moaning girl to hang out with. Nott tried to hex me all day and I used the Expelliarmus charm on him a couple of time with success, stopping him from tripping me with his leg-bind jinxes.
“Then tell me,” Hermione says. “What’s so special about this criminal? I know he’s the one responsible for Sirius’ injury. But that alone doesn’t make him the most wanted man in the world.”
"I don't know, Ron. It's why he started abusing them in the first place, to escape his pain and guilt." And Harry is sure that Draco is blaming himself for losing their child and not conceiving again. It’s just in his nature. Harry tells him all the time this is not on him, but the words seem to get lost before they reach Draco.
And the first so-called dangerous creatures he showed us were Cornish pixies. There is nothing dangerous about them, they’re just annoying. And they proved that when professor Lockhart set them free. They seized Neville and hong him on an iron chandelier until the chandelier gave way and Neville almost fell on top of Professor Lockhart, who had tried to stop the pixies from making a mess with some spell that did absolutely nothing. And worst of all, Hermione, Ron, Neville and I had to go and round them all up after class had already ended. It’s clear that the professor has no clue of what he’s doing. I just wished Hermione would see that as well, she just thinks he’s amazing.
“You need help,” Harry says. “I know you don’t want to. I know you think it will do nothing. But I need you to get help. I need you to be yourself again. I can’t stand seeing you like this. I fucking love you, Draco. I will always love you. But I won’t let you destroy us both. If you’re dead set on wasting away, I’m going to need to leave. You’ll make me break my promise. But I need to take care of myself. I can’t crash again. Teddy needs at least one of us. He wants to come home again. Andromeda struggles more and more each day when she picks him up from school. He wants to come home. He said he wants to spend time with his dads. He calls us his dads, Draco. So if you can’t do this for me, please do it for him. He misses you. And he’s angry. Andromeda said he’d put Teddy-bear in the bin because he didn’t make you happy again. Fuck, I don’t even know why I tell you this. It’s not like you care. Just like you didn’t care that your boss fired you two weeks ago. You used to love that job, and you just let it slip out of your fingers by not showing up anymore. It’s not healthy, Draco. Fuck, do even register anymore what’s happing around you? Have you even noticed that Teddy hasn’t been here since Christmas? Don’t you miss him? Don’t you miss us?”
“Some things are more important than Quidditch,” Harry says. Why can’t they see it? They know how hard it is for Uncle Sirius from time to time. Surely, they will understand that Malfoy is off even worse and that he needs their help.
And then both teams were introduced and the game was happening right in front of us. It was an amazing game. The speed of the players was incredible and I missed the first goal because I slowed my omnioculars down and was watching in slow motion. The Irish chasers were superb, they worked as a seamless team and Draco told me he wanted to try out some of their moves with the Slytherin team this year. He was sure that he and Adrian would be able to pull some of those moves off. They scored a couple of times before the Bulgarians made their first goal. And then the Irish seeker crashed to the floor when Krum did the Wronksi defensive feint. I looked at it in slow motion when the medi-wizard took care of Lynch (the Irish seeker) and was amazed by Krum’s flying skills. He makes it look like he’s unsupported and weightless in the sky.
“Not a chance at all, I would guess,” Neville spurts out between his laughter. Harry and he lock eyes for a second, and Harry can’t help but smile at his brother. Of course, Neville already knows. It’s not as if Harry has ever been able to keep a secret from him.
Harry puts his arm around Hermione’s shoulders. “You’re the best,” he says as they leave the classroom. Ron and Neville follow them. They walk down the stairs and make their way outside. The weather is just too nice to stay inside.
Later that day I was allowed to go to the end-of-year feast. Madam Pomfrey had held me up with her fussing, so the great hall was already full when I got there. It was decorated in the Gryffindor colours of gold and scarlet and a huge banner showing the Gryffindor lion covered the wall behind the High Table. For the first time in seven years, Slytherin hadn’t won the house cup and people still blamed me for it. I could see it on my housemates’ faces when I walked in, so I silently slipped into a seat next to Draco. He had saved me a place on his right side, and as soon as I sat down he grabbed my left hand with his right, so we would both still have or dominant hand free to eat. He smiled at me and I just had to smile back. I was still alive, and even after performing the body-bind curse on Draco, he was still my friend.
And then Victor Krum joined us and we were surprised to see who his date was. Hermione looked amazing. She had done something with her hair that made it sleek and shiny. I later learnt that she had asked Draco for help to tame her hair. Her dress was made of a floaty, periwinkle-blue material, and she was smiling at us as soon as she saw us. Draco complimented her on her hair, said that it looked amazing.
Healer Burke just makes a note on the file and smiles at them. “Okay, well there isn’t anything else I can do for you. Well, maybe there is. There is this test Draco could take once a week to see when he’s most fertile. I could prescribe that, to help you both pinpoint the moments the sex will be most effective. But I must warn you. This can put a strain on your love life.”
It was then that uncle Vernon came upstairs and I hit Dobby in the closet. Uncle Vernon was very upset and told me to keep quiet, or else I would wish I was never born. And he is right, I kind of wish that now. After uncle Vernon had left I told Dobby I had to go back because it is horrible here and that I think I’ve got friends at Hogwarts. And then I found out that Dobby had been stopping their letters from reaching me. He had them with him and I could see letters with Hermione’s handwriting, with Hagrid’s and Ron’s untidy scrawl. I didn’t see any letters from Draco.
The best thing is when Malfoy shows up for DADA and motions to Neville that he needs to go find a different spot.
Our last exam was History of Magic and I was grateful for all the time I had spent studying with Hermione and her call cards because I remember most of the dates and everything about the battles and rebellions we had discussed this year in class. I was really looking forward to the week off after the exams, two weeks of them is hard. So I cheered with everyone else when Professor Binns told us to put down our quills.
Draco stares at Harry. Sometimes he’s a mystery to Draco. Even after all this time they’ve spent together, getting to know each other more and more each day. A beautiful, wonderful mystery. But nonetheless a mystery.
Harry looks back at the castle. “Uncle Sirius says all Malfoys are egocentric,” he says. “But I don’t think Malfoy is. He’s mostly just alone.”
Harry ignores her and just walks away. She can’t see him, so there is no way she will be able to rat him out.
Our house won the house cup. Mainly because of how good we did with Quidditch and Draco and I got treads from a lot of housemates during the end of year feast. Marcus even thank us for making his dream come true to go out as a winning Quidditch captain. Adrian and Miles laughed like two lunatics when that happened. We also had a vote as a team to pick our new captain and Draco won that easily. He’s up in the clouds about that, still can’t believe it half of the time, asking me if it’s really true. I’m really proud of him. He deserves the position, he’s the best player on our team.
The Auror’s eyes flash around the room, and his lip trembles a little. Harry points his wand at the man and Draco closes his eyes. He doesn’t need to see what Harry will do to defend Draco’s honour.
“Okay,” Hermione says. Her brow furrows and her jaw is set. She makes eye contact with Neville. “We’re going to catch that rat as soon as possible.”
I promise I will write again soon and I’m sure everything will be better by than. It has to be. I hate school like this. I hate my life if it’s always going to be like this.
Draco gets up from his seat and moves around Neville. He pushes against Neville’s back while Harry pulls. Neville takes an involuntary step forward.
But back to my conversation with Professor Snape. I told him that I don’t dance, but that was not an option. All champions would open the first dance, so I would just have to learn how to. He was sure that Draco could help me with that, just as finding me a proper girl to take to the ball. I countered back that if I had to dance and all, that the only way I would do it was with Draco. I don’t want to pretend we’re not a couple. He’s my one and only, and if the world can’t handle that, that’s their problem, not mine. Professor Snape shook his head and told me fine, as long as we would behave during the ball.
It turns out the Knight Bus can take stranded wizards and witches anywhere they need. I didn’t want to put too much attention on me so I pretended my name was Greg Goyle. I’m sure Greg won’t mind, I’m sure he will find this story funny once Draco tells him when he goes back to school. It would take me 14 Sickles to get to Malfoy Manor in Wiltshire, so I looked for my last coins and paid Stan. He helped me get my trunk into the bus and off we were. Stan wanted to know why I wanted to go to the Malfoy’s and I told him that I knew Draco Malfoy from Hogwarts and that I was going to stay with them for a while because my mother wasn’t feeling well. Luckily they believed my story and didn’t ask any other questions.
The rest of the next two weeks went by in a blur. We went to class and I either studied with Draco or Hermione for our exams. The days were getting hotter and I was happy that the dungeon stayed nice and cool, making it easier to study there. I told Hermione, Ron and Neville and they just complained that the west tower was sweltering hot.
Harry closes his eyes and shakes his head. He doesn’t have a crush, he’s in love. It’s different. More painful than he ever thought it could be.
“Dad probably didn’t tell, to keep Sirius and himself out of trouble,” Harry continues. “Or put attention on Remus’ condition.”
“Are you two just going to stand there and let them bury me in snow?” Ron yells when he gets hit with another two snowballs. His coat is white from all the snow and his hair seems to be soaking by now.
Harry doesn’t feel like eating crickets. He prefers something a little sweeter. Or would crickets be sweet? He has no idea what they taste like. “Did you have any crickets?” he asks.
“Ron and Hermione,” Harry says. He tries to be excited. It’s amazing that they will go to the final. He just needs to remember that he dreamed of this from the moment he knew that the Quidditch World Cup would be in England this year. It’s amazing. And expensive. An amazing gift from his parents. And together with Ron and Hermione, it will be fun. They will stay overnight and have fun. Just as they used to do before Harry fell in love with Draco. It will be great. Even without Draco there. Harry will love it. He has to love it. Somehow. His parents spent a lot of their savings to give this to Harry. He can’t be ungrateful, just because he can’t share it with Draco. That’s not their fault.
A laugh escapes Harry. “Yeah, him and Voldemort. I’m sure you will get promoted for making it happen.”
On our last Hogsmeade weekend, I bought a ton of socks for Dobby. Draco and I figured he deserved them after giving me the Gillyweed. If he hadn’t, I wouldn’t have been able to perform the second tasks. Dobby thanked us and said it was nothing, that he had to help me save master Draco. Dobby also complimented my nails, he likes the green colour I like to wear. He says it suits me. And Draco agrees with him. Every weekend Draco fixes my nails after I’ve braided his hair. Blaise has started to complain we start to look like girls, always busy with our nails and hair. It was funny, Draco wanted to open his mouth and say something about it to Blaise, but Greg, Daphne, Millicent and Luna all told him to shut up and do his studies. Draco and I laughed at him when he gives them all an angry look and then turned back to his homework.
“Thank you, Draco. My house is not big enough to contain the inventory of an entire toy shop. Now, could you take little Rose so I can see this hideous stuffed animal?”
I wandered around the castle before I decided to go the Owlery to see Hedwig. Only I never made it. Professor Lupin called out to me from his office when I passed by. He asked me where Draco was and I told him that he was at Hogsmeade with the rest of our friends. And then Professor Lupin showed me a Grindylow to cheer me up. A Grindylow is a sickly green creature with sharp little horns and long spindly fingers. The professor explained that they are water demons and that they were easier to handle than the Kappas we studied in the lessons before that.
“Ron is going to kill you,” Harry says. “No doubt about that. He’s too protective about his little sister.”
The hallway of this carriage isn’t empty. At the other end, Malfoy just steps out of one of the bathrooms. He looks at Harry and his friends without moving. Harry shakes his head and looks in the first compartment. His sister isn’t there either.
James shakes his head and then closes the door behind him. He takes one of the desk chairs and sits in front of the boys. “Neville, I understand. I hate him too,” he says. “Because of him, we lost some pretty awesome people. Fuck, we almost lost Sirius. He’d been my friend for years. All through school and then in the few years after. I want him dead. It takes a lot of effort not to just go after him and put myself in danger. But I don’t. Because I’ve got both of you, and Iris and Lily. And Sirius will hunt my ghost down and torture me even after I’m dead if I do anything that stupid.”
“Lucius, please calm down. Of course, Draco will produce an heir,” Narcissa says. She still sits in her favourite chair. A cup of tea held graceful in her hand.
Harry is glad the topic has changed. He takes the quill from Draco and writes: ‘That’s cool. Uncle Sirius is fun. He hates being deaf. He misses sounds. Do you also miss them?’
Draco suggested we go back to the castle to get help, but Hermione didn’t want to go. She was afraid the dog would eat Ron and she still has this thing for him. I understood her, if it had been Draco, I wouldn’t have left but would have tried to follow him. So, in the end, we sent Neville back to the castle to go get help and Draco, Hermione and I tried to figure out a way to get to the roots of the Whomping Willow. Crookshanks was the one that showed us, the cat darted between the battering branches and place his front paws upon a knot on the trunk. The Whomping Willow stopped moving and Draco, Hermione and I ran towards the trunk and we all slid down the gap.
“Yes, I wasn’t of course. It’s Voldemort who’s a descended from Slytherin. He was the one who set the Basilisk out to kill,” Harry says.
I think that’s all for now. It’s been a good couple of weeks and I’m doing much better than before. I write again soon.
“Father will be upset,” Draco signs. “And I’ll have nobody to help me at home. None of the other elves are like Dobby.”
Professor Snape escorted us both to the castle, all the way to the hospital wing. He said something about giving us some privacy, that today was already hard enough for me. Madam Pomfrey followed us and checked us out at the hospital wing. Later I heard that I came second in the task, this because the Mer-people had explained to the Headmaster that I had arrived second at the statue but had been to upset to act when reunited with my hostage. Blaise told me that the Merpeople had been furious with headmaster Dumbledore. I asked Professor Snape if he knows why and he explained that the Mer-people had sensed what he had suspected, that Draco and I are connected in a way that is more than just love.
Harry and Draco both laugh. “We love you too, Lily,” Harry tells her as Nathan tries to climb on his leg. Harry takes him in his hands and lifts him in the air as he stands up.
Not long after that, we took a break from dancing to sit down with our friends and to have some drinks. Sometime later we were joined by Seamus, Dean and Ron (who had lost his date somewhere during the night because apparently, he couldn’t stop complaining about Hermione being at the dance with Viktor Krum). All three of them were a bit cranky and when Draco told them to lighten up and enjoy the evening they all looked at the dance floor and signed. Luna told us to leave them be, that love was being hard on them. I asked why, and both Seamus and Dean simultaneous said it was all my fault. I didn’t understand, so they were so kind to elaborate. It turns out that Dean is bisexual and that he has a massive crush on Neville, who he knows is gay but apparently in love with me. And then Seamus has the hots for Ginny, who also has been crushing on me for as long as Ron can remember. Draco was all like ‘I told you so’ about Neville being in love with me. I still can’t believe it, it’s already a mystery most of the time why Draco loves me, but that others feel that way about me, who think of me that way, it’s strange.
Draco steps out of the shower and takes his robes from his locker. He’s half-dressed when his teammates enter and get ready to take a shower.
The dog attacked again and this time it went straight for Ron. Its jaws fastened around Ron’s arm and it dragged Ron away. Hermione was screaming and Neville tried to catch the dog but it was no use.
Harry treads down the stairs and picks his wallet and keys from the little bowl next to the front door. Draco left his key at the bottom of the bowl. Just the key. He took the fluffy key chain that used to decorate it. A gift from Harry when they just started dating. Harry doesn’t know what he should think of that. He left all the pictures, the furniture they bought together. He only took his clothes, his expensive food and the stupid key chain. Won at a fair. When they still remembered how to have fun together.
“Ew, gross,” Teddy says. He struggles to get out of Harry’s lap and then walks towards the door. “I’m opening my presents,” he tells them.
“I hate both of you, just so you know,” Harry says as he sits back down. “We can’t just let him be. Not now that we know he’s deaf.”
Well, at least I now know what I’m supposed to do for the second task. Not that we have any idea how I’m going to do it. But we still have a couple of weeks before the task, and Hermione and Draco are sure we will find a way for me to breath underwater.
Ron Weasley was also at the campsite, together with his brothers, his little sister, his father and Neville Longbottom. Fred and George greeted us with big smiles on their faces and Ginny was all shy around me. Ron said that she worshipped me still, even though it was clear I would never love her back. But more interesting were the older brothers, Bill and Charlie. Bill is a curse breaker with long hair and earrings and Charlie works with Dragons in Roumania. He’s got tattoos and burn marks all over his body. I think Ron didn’t like that we had more attention for his brothers than for him.
Harry pushes his shoulder against Draco. “I’m glad I didn’t,” he says. “And your father is wrong. You can talk. We’re having a conversation right now. And you see things, notice things that others don’t. You hear with your eyes and that is amazing.”
I don’t have that much more to tell you. I’m doing good, even after all the heartache of the second task. I’m happy and school is going good. Having so many friends to study with really helps.
I have to go now, Draco is here and he is going to quiz me on Potions, to make sure I don’t mess up our practical exam on Monday.
Draco does his silent chuckle. The corners of his mouth lift for a second and his eyes drop a little. Then he looks back at Harry. “I’m sure you did fine,” he signs.
“Yes,” Draco says. “He’s the only other person I told besides you and father. You don’t have to worry. Nobody else knows.”
Sirius was at the train station to pick me up. He made sure nobody got close to me to ask me any nasty questions. And as I said, Mr and Mrs Tonks were there to get Draco, but he came home with me. I’m glad he’s still here. I have nightmares every night, and it helps to wake up in Draco’s arms and to hear the sweet words he whispers in my ear to get me to calm down. I’m a very lucky guy for having him as my boyfriend.
Hope. It’s a strange concept. Draco sits at a table, surrounded by Death Eaters. The Dark Lord sits beside him. And he’s just been told that he and his mother will both die at the start of the coming summer. Draco will die by Dumbledore’s hand. Harry always spoke highly of Dumbledore. Said that he was a good man. Will Dumbledore be willing to listen to Draco? Could he be the help Draco needs? He is powerful enough to save both Draco and his mother. Harry trusted him. When he finds out that Draco and Harry were in love, he won’t let Draco down. Dumbledore is the hope Harry mentioned.
And in Defence against the Dark Arts, we are supposed to be learning about Doxies, Gnomes, Snails and Imps at the moments according to our book, but professor Quirrell only talks about vampires and how to fight them off. We are also supposed to learn spells, like shooting green and red sparks and a wand-lighting charm. Ron has shown me how to make the sparks come from my wand when we were reading through our DADA book. It was very easy and I feel like I could be good at DADA if the professor would just stop obsessing about vampires. I’m glad some of the charms are also part of the charms curriculum, like the wand-lighting charm.
“I survived the family,” Ron says when he steps back into the room. “I think we have about five minutes before mom arrives and maybe ten more before my entire family thinks they need to see Rose.”
“Please, Neville, I don’t want to bury you next to your parents,” James says. “You’re too young to die. I promised them I would look after you if anything would happen to them, make sure you have a good life. Don’t make me break that promise.” He puts his hand on Neville’s shoulder. “You’re my son and I love you. We all love you.”
Sorry for the long wait everyone, moving countries takes up more time and stresses you out more than I expected. I'm back on the writing wagon now and hope to post a new chapter at least every two weeks. But I can't promise a regular schedule, real life still takes priority.
And then headmaster Dumbledore said the worst. He said the Chamber of Secrets war indeed opened AGAIN!
Harry shakes his head and turns to face Hermione and Neville. He scrapes his throat. “You know what to do?” he asks Hermione.
“Ask your best friends, they’ve just scarred me for life,” Draco tells him. He opens one of the cupboards and starts to take out the champagne glasses. Harry takes a couple and kisses Draco on his cheek.
Draco made it his mission to become just as skilled at potions as his father, hoping to one day join him in his efforts to finding the perfect potion to end a Muggles life. One that would inflict pain and suffering on the useless beings. If only he could get into the restricted section in the library. Draco was sure he would be able to learn tons about poisonous potions from those books.
Harry looks around for his quill. He has to search through his bag to find it. It gives him time to think of what to answer. Will he be honest and say he’s here because he wants to help Malfoy? Or will he annoy him? That last is more prone to get a reaction from Malfoy.
I think that’s all for now. I still need to finish some homework for our lessons tomorrow, so I better start working on that.
Draco wants to tell Harry that he shouldn’t, that he’s an idiot for loving him. But instead, he just drops his head and keeps silent. Harry won’t hear him, he never has and he never will when it comes to this.
Draco showed me the passage in a book about the Basilisk and it all made sense. Hagrid had said something had been killing roosters, and the crowing of the rooster is fatal to a Basilisk. We only took some time to figure out how the Basilisk got around the castle. But after some brainstorming we knew, it was using the pipes. The voice I heard was inside the walls.
They sit in silence. Draco rests his head on Harry’s shoulder. A young man walks past the waiting area, a newborn baby in his arms. Draco follows him with his eyes. Watches as the man softly sings to the baby. It stings in his heart. He hates the jealousy that grows inside him every time he sees someone with a baby.
Harry drops his bag and shakes his head. “You didn’t. The miscarriage wasn’t your fault. I never blamed you for it, nobody did.”
This morning I saw that I have a bruise on my abdomen. I stayed in bed all day, reading one of the books I took from home. It’s called On My Honour and is about a boy that loses his friend when he drowns in a river. It was a sad book but I felt a little less lonely reading it. I’ve finished it in a day and now I’m writing to you. I’ll have to go to dinner tonight because I haven’t eaten all day and I’m getting a bit hungry. I wish I could sit with the Gryffindor’s again, but I’m sure Nott is going to hurt me even worse if I do. Nott and his friends haven’t really been in the dormitory today, so it was nice and quiet. Only Malfoy came in once, but he didn’t say anything to me. I hope next week is going to be better.
I was still crying by the time Malfoy came into the dormitory a little before dinner. He didn’t say a word, just opened his own trunk and search for something all the way at the bottom. I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw what he dug up. He was holding my notebook and cloak. He placed them on the ground next to me and walked out of the dormitory again. I didn’t go to dinner that night; I just curled on my bed, holding the cloak and notebook to my chest.
But enough about that, life is good and in a couple of days, I’ll turn 14 and have a real party for the first time in my life. All my friends are going to come and we’ll have cake and music and maybe even some proper drinks. And Draco will stay with here afterwards, until the end of the holiday. And on top of all that, the Ministry has offered Sirius multiple tickets for the Quidditch World Cup final to make up for all the years they locked him up while being innocent. I know it doesn’t make it right, but I’m going to the Quidditch World Cup final!!!!
“Both of you are doing nothing,” James says. Neville and Harry both sit up quickly and see James standing in the doorway. His hand trembles on the doorknob and his face is pale. “No matter how much you two want to take revenge, you are not allowed to go looking for Wormtail.”
“Look, it’s silly Malfoy,” Neville says. “Do you think he will find us worthy of his words this year?”
“He’s dead, mother,” Draco says as he sits up a little straighter. He reaches for his wand and closes the door. The silencing wards go up and then the wand drops to the floor. Draco watches it roll against the bedside table. The dark wood almost invisible on the wooden floor.
Harry blushes. This is the moment. If only Madam Pomfrey would just leave. But she fusses over Harry. Asking him some questions. She wants to know if he’s still in pain and if he’s dizzy at all. Harry answers but keeps his eyes on his father who’s taken a seat next to his bed. They will talk in a little while and it will be okay. Even if it means admitting Harry is head over heels for a straight boy from Slytherin.
Hogwarts is not as nice as I thought it would be. I’m sitting now in my bed and wished I was back in my cupboard. At least there I was left alone. Dudley had been afraid to be in the same room as me and Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia acted like I wasn’t even there. But it was better than this.
“You’re at the wrong table,” Ron tells her. He points his fork towards the Ravenclaw table and then takes another bite of his eggs.
Oh, and this is also when I discovered the location of the Gryffindor common room, the portrait of the fat lady is their entrance. Hermione made me swear not to tell anyone since I’m not supposed to know. And I won’t, she’s my only friend in this school, I would never want to get her into trouble.
Harry parks his bike in the shed and moves back into the garden. The one tree they have is leafless and cold, just like the last two months. Harry can't wait for spring to begin, watch the first flowers spring from the ground and sit outside to enjoy the late sunshine. A glass of wine and a good book in his hands. Draco close by with his papers and his quill stuck behind his ear, trying to make sense of the mess his clients present him with. A monitor spell hovering close to keep an eye on the sleeping Teddy.
This afternoon I went with Ron, Fred and George up the hill to a small paddock and we went flying. Ron and I had to take turns on his broom. I told Ron I’m planning on buying my own broom tomorrow and we talked about the latest models. Ron dreamed of having a better broom, but the Weasleys don’t have a lot of money and they would already struggle with just getting the normal school supplies. I feel a bit bad about that, knowing I have plenty of money thanks to you two.
I went up to the hospital wing during my lunch break and see how Ron’s new friend Longbottom was doing. Ron said Neville was going to be fine. I told him I was going to visit Hagrid and asked him to come along. Ron agreed, so after a double lesson of Transfiguration, we made our way across the grounds to Hagrid’s small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. Hagrid asked how my first week had been. I said it had been fine, but Ron then told Hagrid that Malfoy and his friend had been bullying me all week. Hagrid told me I should try to stand up to them, let them know that I will not be messed with. I nodded, but I’m not sure how I’m supposed to stand up to them. Hagrid then changed the subject to Ron’s brother Charlie, like he knew that I didn’t really want to talk about Malfoy and his friends. I didn’t really listen, because I saw a small cutting from the Daily Prophet about the break-in of Gringotts that Ron told me about on the train ride to Hogwarts. The robbery was on the same date as Hagrid and I had been at the bank. And when I asked Hagrid about it he grunted and offered me another rock cake. Which are horrible by the way, but I didn’t want to be impolite so I took one and stuffed it in my pocket. But what was most interesting was that the vault had been emptied earlier that day and that Hagrid had taken something from a vault that day, emptying it. I think Hagrid had collected the package just in time. But where is it now?
After breakfast I took Hermione apart and told her about the voice I heard during detention. She doesn’t know what it is and that I shouldn’t worry about it. That maybe it was just me being tired. That he hadn’t been sleeping well, and that it was probably nothing. And maybe she is right, but I don’t know. It sounded real. And I don’t want to go crazy. Life is already hard enough without voices in my head.
“None of your business, brother. Just like it’s none of Angela’s business if it’s true or not,” George answers.
Right now we are hanging out with the Slytherin Quidditch team. It’s Terence his last week at Hogwarts and he just wanted to play around on a broom for a while. Woods, the Gryffindor Quidditch captain is trying to get his team together to do an impromptu match against our team this Saturday, just to end off the year with a nice match. The seventh years have missed Quidditch this year and are peeved that they didn’t have the chance to win the cup one last time. Only Marcus Flint will get another shot. He failed some of his N.E.W.T.’s he needs for his choice of profession, so he’s going to repeat seventh year next year.
Harry snaps his head around and looks at Draco. Draco looks straight at Harry and repeats his words. “This is not a fluke. I mend it when I just told you that I love you. Just because I’m not ready to switch sides in this war, doesn’t mean I didn’t mean them. Because I do. Harry, I mean them. I love you and, Salazar, I’m scared of what that means.”
Riddle looked at me with an angry look. He said I disappointed him. He had been so curious about me ever since Draco had told him that I had defeated the Dark Lord twice in my short life. And then I tried to kill myself, like a helpless little child. He just had to meet me, and seeing how much Draco and I care about each other, he just knew that I would come to his rescue if Draco would be in danger. So Riddle had made Draco write his own farewell on the wall and come down here. Draco cried at first, Riddle said, he thinks Draco finally realised that had been him all along. Only it was already too late, he had put too much of himself in the diary, into Riddle, so much so that Riddle could leave the pages of his diary, slowly killing Draco while he was waiting for me.
They had talked some more. About Black and Harry’s father. Both Animagus. That night Draco learned where the shape of Harry’s Patronus came from. His father’s Animagus form accompanied him during the darkest times. And Black was the dog. The dog which the Dark Lord hunts for. Draco has no idea why the Dark Lord wants Sirius Black. Why would that man be important? He’s a fugitive, on the run from the Ministry and the Death Eaters. What use could the Dark Lord have for him?
And the silence. Harry never thought he would love silence. But it’s one of the things he likes the most when he’s with Draco. There’s no need to talk or to do anything at all. They can just sit and do nothing. Well, Harry does nothing. Draco reads or works on some essays they have to do during the summer break. Harry will get to them when he feels like it. Exams are done. Now is the time to relax. Not the time to think about more things he needs to do for school. Only Draco, Hermione and Iris are sad the year is over. Neville likes to tease Harry that he found himself a male Hermione. Not that Harry minds. He knows how different Hermione and Draco are. Just because they both like to study, doesn’t make them the same person.
“Yes, you need to make the broom hover,” Harry says. “That’s the hard part. You control the broom with the movements of your body. You lean forward when you want to speed up, or backwards when you want to slow down. It’s easy.
Ron also has a younger sister, named Ginny. She seems to have a crush on me. Every time she sees me she turns red turns around and walks out of the room. Or she knocks things over whenever I enter a room. It’s kind of cute. Ron said she had been talking about me all summer. Fred is surprised she hasn’t asked for my autograph jet.
“Because you love her,” Harry says. It’s unfair. James and Lily got to be together and in love. Sirius has Remus. And Ron and Hermione are getting closer by the day. Why can’t Harry have that? Why doesn’t the person that he loves, love him back? He should stop his thoughts from drifting to Draco all the time. Maybe then he will be able to enjoy his family a little before he has to go back to school. “I’m getting my broom and going for a short fly before dinner,” he says. He stands and turns towards the shed, leaving his father alone on the bench, hoping he won’t worry too much about Harry’s broken heart.
“Evanesco,” he whispers. The pictures on the mantle disappear, only leaving the one of Harry and Teddy, the only picture that doesn’t include Draco.
The maze was dark. The hedges were enormous and cast dark shadows onto the path. And all sounds were blocked by them. I couldn’t hear the crowd anymore. Luckily, it didn’t stop me from feeling Draco, like when he was enchanted during the second task. I knew he was close and that he was rooting for me. And that was enough to be brave and walk onward.
Within seconds, Harry is pulled back against Remus’ chest. “Don’t you listen to that man for one second,” Remus says. “He’s wrong. He was scared and a coward. He still is. He would have faced us by now if he wasn’t. He needs to tell himself something to make right what he did. But nothing he says will ever be true. He was our friend, and for years he didn’t mind that Sirius and I were together. It’s not our fault he fell for Voldemort’s lies. It’s nobody’s fault but his own.”
“You’re forgetting that not every seventh year takes Herbology. You and Dean both have different subjects. We need to find out which students only have subjects that aren’t outside. So every student taking Care of Magical Creatures or Herbology is out.” Dean says.
Draco stayed at Hogwarts this Easter holiday. He said I would need him more than his mother would need him. It’s nice to have him around. We are not allowed to go outside the Slytherin common room because of the attacks so we spent most of our time just hanging around in our dormitory, talking and playing with magic. It’s nice. I’ve missed this, just the easy simple time with Draco.
Harry pushes his hand through his hair. “I’ll try,” he says. “Not sure if Malfoy wants me to be his friend.” And that is the whole problem. Harry wants to help him, wants to be close to him. But he has no idea how.
“Yeah, you got a point. A little bug then? You want me to get you anything from the pharmacy?” Harry starts to pet Draco’s hair and he closes his eyes for a second.
Harry turns so he can look at the Shrieking Shack. “No, I don’t think they ever considered that friends could do something like that,” he says. Wormtail used to join them on the nights Remus needed his friends. He was one of them. He was supposed to fight on their side and help keep Neville and Harry safe. Harry will never understand what could have made Pettigrew betray all his friends and side with Voldemort. Nothing is more important than friends and family.
Harry looks back at Neville. “Please don’t. He’s not gay. And I don’t want to lose him as a friend.”
Oh, I need to tell you about the awkward conversation I had with Sirius the day before my birthday. He said that he had a talk with Moony and that realised that it was pointless to try to keep me and Draco apart at night, that if even Snivellus can’t make it happen it would be hopeless. It took me a couple of seconds to understand Sirius mend Professor Snape with that. I wanted to say something about that but didn’t get the chance and the topic Sirius started was so horrifying it slipped my mind for some time.
My heart did some somersaults when I saw who had stepped into the shop. My dreams had done his sharp pointed features no justice. His hair was even lighter than I could remember and was styled sleekly to the back. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a person that beautiful and couldn’t help but smile. I wanted to step out of the cabinet to greet him when I saw that he was not alone. A man with the same pale, pointed face and identical grey eyes followed Draco into the shop. I think it was his father. He snapped at Draco to touch nothing and Draco turned away from him. I don’t think Draco’s father would be kind to me if I would show myself so I stayed hidden.
Harry, Ron, Neville and Hermione eat and joke around. Ron complains about his little sister and how she keeps interfering with his life. Harry ignores Lavender’s advances and Hermione is excited about all the subjects she’s taking this year. Before they even know it the meal has come to a close, Dumbledore has given his final warnings and they are off towards Gryffindor tower.
The next thing I know is waking up here in the hospital wing, Draco next to me, his trembling hand in mine. Marcus, Adrian en Miles from the team were also there, just like Hermione, Blaise, Greg and Daphne. I fainted again and had fallen to the ground. If the headmaster hadn’t slowed down my fall I might have died. Draco won’t leave my side at the moment. Even Madam Pomfrey has given up on trying to make him leave. He slept here with me last night. He had another nightmare about me dying. He’s really shaken up. I haven’t told him that I also saw the Grim, I think it would only upset him more.
Harry feels Draco come inside him and for a second he hopes that Draco would also release his neck and make him forget about the blood. Only Draco grabs Harry’s head and sucks more desperate. Harry his head starts to hurt and he feels dizzy. He tries to lift his body with his hands to turn around and make Draco stop, only Draco is stronger and keeps Harry in place.
“You want to hook up with someone during break?” Neville asks as he shakes his head. “To forget about Draco? And you think that will work?”
“Harry, give me back the Prophet,” Hermione says. She holds out her hand. Her mouth is a tin line. It won’t be long before she starts giving a lecture, so Harry gives back the paper.
It’s close to dinner time when Neville’s wand starts to shake. Harry sits up quickly and pulls the map out of his pocket. “I solemnly swear that I’m up to no good,” he whispers and Hogwarts appears on the parchment. Neville and Harry search the map for one name, Peter Pettigrew. The rat has managed to stay hidden for the entire year. He has to be in the castle. Only a human small enough to pass through the places where Neville and Harry set up detection charms could have set them off. And they know of nobody else who can turn into a rat and therefore fit through any of the holes.
Harry’s hand squeezes into a fist, and he jerks his knee in a fast rhythm. Draco places his hand on the fist and looks Harry in the eyes. They’ve learnt that silence is the best course of actions when it comes to this, but it is hard today. Don’t these people see the pain they are in already? Do they think it’s okay to make it even worse? Like Draco doesn’t know that he never deserved happiness. He remembers all the horrible things he did during the war. How his actions hurt and sometimes even killed others.
I should probably tell you how I ended up there. Well, this morning Mrs Weasley woke us up very early to go to Diagon Alley. We had to use Floo powder, but I had never done that before. Mrs Weasley was a bit worried about that, but Fred said I would be alright. Well, Mrs Weasley was right to worry, because it didn’t go as smoothly as it is supposed to be. But it is amazing that we can just travel somewhere by throwing some powder into the heart, stepping into it and shouting where you want to go. And that is where it went wrong for me. I didn’t say my destination clearly. But it was difficult, as soon as I stepped into the flames I swallowed a lot of hot ash and coughed my destination. And then I was off, spinning very fast through the green flames. It made me feel sick, so I closed my eyes and tucked in my elbows as Ron had suggested. My bacon sandwiches were churning inside me and I wished it would stop. And it did, I fell face forward onto cold stone. The bridge of my glasses snapped so I had to hold them up to my eyes to see where I was.
Malfoy sits at their usual spot. He doesn’t even look up when Harry slides onto the chair next to him. He just pushes a book towards Harry and then continues his scribbles. Harry picks up the book and laughs when he sees it’s about potions. He leafs through it and sighs. It’s mostly text. A lot of text.
I took my cloak that afternoon and made my way to Myrtle’s bathroom. I told her about what had happened and that I had nobody left. Draco hates me, Hermione is petrified, Hagrid is in jail and headmaster Dumbledore is fired. Who’s going to believe now that I didn’t do this?
“Oh, that,” Lily says. She rolls her eyes. “And you two are willing to destroy our savings and give up on holidays overseas for the coming five years or so?”
Draco is okay now. He was released of the hospital wing on Sunday. Pansy is pampering him ever since. I don’t think he really likes it, he keeps pushing her hand away every time she tries to stroke his hair. His watery eyes from the hospital wing have been hunting me. I see them every time I close my eyes. They looked so hopeless and sad. I think something bad is going on with Draco. What if my dreams are coming true? What if he is ill? So ill he might die? Mom, I’m scared. How do I get him to talk to me, to tell me what is wrong? I need to help him, need to be with him.
“Harry,” Lily says. She turns him around with her hand and places her other hand on his other shoulder. It won’t be long, and Harry will be the same height as her. She hardly has to look down at Harry. Her face morphs into one of compassion when she looks at him. She pulls him against her and circles her hands around Harry.
“No, we're not,” Harry says. He gives Neville a dark look. “And you should both remember that.” He picks up the plates and walks to the kitchen. He can hear his dad tell Iris and Neville to behave. Lily must have instructed him to be considerate of Harry’s wishes to keep his massive crush on Draco a secret.
“I’m not dead,” Harry assures her. “Just a little dizzy, that’s all.” And in pain, but Harry won’t say that until Iris has left this room. He will ask Draco to get Madam Pomfrey when the others are gone.
“Fine, if you want to know so badly,” Harry says. “I love you. That’s what’s going on. I’m in love with you. And I just wondered. I don’t want to assume anything. It’s just, I don’t know if you love me too.”
At the welcome feast, Hermione and Luna had to part with us to go sit at their own house tables for the rest of the evening. Ron, Neville, Seamus and Dean greeted us when they came into the Great Hall, soaked because Peeves had been throwing water balloons in the entrance hall. But their state was better than the first years who looked like they had swum across the lake instead of sailed. The hat sang a song about the founders and then the first years were sorted. I seemed to go on forever and Greg was complaining that he was hungry and that the hat should hurry up.
“Don’t eat too much, you might fall off your broom again,” Parkinson jokes. The people around her laugh. Harry just shakes his head and continues his breakfast.
“We’ll tell Uncle Remus,” Harry says. He’s still got Neville’s arm in his hand. “We’ll hand him the map so they can keep an eye on Pettigrew while the proper people get here to arrest him,” Harry says.
Draco nods his head against Harry’s chest. He’s not sure if he’ll be able to wait, but Burke doesn’t need to know this.
Hagrid has lost all his confidence when it comes to teaching. After the incident with Buckbeak, we’ve only learnt about Flobberworms. And let me tell you, those are the most boring creatures in existence. It’s really sad to see, and Nott and Crabbe like to point out all the time how crappy Hagrid is at teaching. Draco almost got into a fight with them last week. If Blaise and I hadn’t pulled him back to the castle I’m sure he would have been suspended to play Quidditch and that would make our loss even worse since Draco had scored all of the points we got that game.
By the time the sun makes an appearance on the horizon, Harry makes his way back to the dormitory. Neville is awake when he comes back.
“What’s up with you this morning. First, the staring at the door and now you stand there like the world is ending any minute now. Please don’t tell me if it is, I would like to stay ignorant to the very end,” Malfoy jokes.
“He doesn’t want anyone to know,” Harry says. He looks around again, but there seems to be no other students in sight. This part of the library hardly ever gets used.
That last Saturday, Draco and I also had a party for our birthdays in the evening. It was a big success. All our friends came and Terence had enchanted a gramophone to play music non-stop. Fred and George had somehow managed to steal food from the kitchens and we danced and eat till it was time to go back to our common rooms because of curfew. We also took the time to open up all the presents our friends had gotten us. Hermione had gotten me a Broomstick Servicing Kit, with a large jar of Fleetwood’s High-Finish Handle Polish, a pair of gleaming silver Tail-Twig Clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip on our broom for long journeys and a Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broom-care.  I know Draco was a bit jealous when he saw how happy I was with that present. The others had gotten me books about Quidditch or writing supplies. And Daphne had gotten me a scarf in Slytherin colours. Draco was also happy with his gifts that also included books about Quidditch, an identical scarf as mine and hair products. We ended with the gifts we had gotten each other and I was very nervous when I handed mine to Draco. He unpacked it and just stared at it for a long time without saying anything and I was afraid he didn’t like it until he looked at me with tears in his eyes saying it was perfect. According to Hermione, it was so cute to see us smile at each other like the world was perfect.
I hit my head pretty hard on one of the falls and struggled to get up after that. I tried to crawl to the door. I screamed for help. But nobody heard me, and they just kept going. I was crying by then and I was so afraid. When would they stop? Would they keep going until I was dead?
When I was secured professor Quirrell turned back to a big mirror standing in the room. It was the Mirror of Erised, the one I had discovered during Christmas break. Quirrell was examining it and I tried to distract him from it by saying I had seen him and Professor Snape in the forest. Quirrell told me that professor Snape was onto him by that time and that he tried to frighten him. But that it hadn’t worked because Quirrell had Lord Voldemort on his side.
“Oh, Harry, they will be so glad you smiled at them,” Hermione says in a mocking voice. “I will be hearing all about it tonight, how they will conquer your heart this year with their beautiful looks and perfect smiles. A Quidditch champion like you would be unable to resist them.”
Not long after that, Draco’s father and mother arrived. They took places just behind me and Draco. Draco hugged his mother shortly and said a formal hello to his father. I also greeted them, in the hope that one day they would consider me worthy enough for their son. At that moment I understood why Draco was trying so hard when it came to Sirius. I know Draco kind of hates his father at the moment, but he’s still his father and I want him to like me. Not that Sirius was any help with that. He and Lucius greeted each other with a look of dismay. Draco’s mother made a little more effort and said it was nice to see Sirius again. She did the same with Mr Tonks and she introduced herself to Tonks, saying it was good to finally meet her. Tonks just nodded and turned back around in her seat, not interested in her aunt at all. She later told Draco she’s glad he’s not as narrow-minded as his parents. I know Draco struggled with this, he really loves his mother and I agree with him, she’s lovely. She really helped me last year when I had run away from the Dursleys.
“Did I tell you all about the food in Egypt?” Ron asks. “It was good, as long as they didn’t tell you what was in it. They eat crickets as snacks. Can you believe that?”
Harry is rooted to his spot as Draco turns and walks away from him. The spinning motion of the word ‘ever’ was clearly there. It wasn’t a mix-up, it was deliberate. It’s not just now. Draco never wants to talk to Harry again. The sausage from that morning tries to come up again as Harry stares at the hallway Draco disappeared in. The colour drains from his face and then he hunches over.
“Nobody gets it,” Neville says. “But it’s starting to take its toll. She yells at Ron more and more. This way they are never getting together.”
Harry bites his lips. “I hope so,” he says. He doesn’t want to think about how he won’t be able to look after her if she’s not in the same dorms as them. Not with Pettigrew on the loose.
The next DADA lesson starts without Malfoy present. Harry keeps checking the door, expecting it to open any second now. Only Malfoy never shows.
Draco. He’s still here. Still alive. And still held firmly by Pettigrew. Pettigrew has his wand pointed towards Harry now. Harry looks at him. He’s going to die. He wishes Draco could see him now. That Harry could at least sign that Harry loves him.
It’s strange to think that it was the last thing his father said to him before the Dark Lord returned. During the summer nobody said a word about Draco’s sexuality. Lucius had first been too broken and then too scared. The Dark Lord won’t take it lightly. Homosexuality won’t fit into his plan to expand the number of purebloods. Draco looks at the Dark Lord, who eats his eggs with great delight. How would he react if he learned that Draco was in love with Harry Potter, his greatest enemy? Would he be disgusted, or would he find it fitting that Draco was the one that killed him? The perfect punishment for his betrayal.
Marcus really wants to win the Quidditch cup this year, since it will be his last chance to win it. It doesn’t count that he had won it already a couple of times in his younger years. He wasn’t captain back then, just a player. He’s really uptight about it. Blaming it all on bad luck, and stupid cancellation of tournaments because of some crazy snake. When he said that, Draco murmured in my ear that it was a bit more than a crazy snake. We both remember the massive Basilisk in the Chamber that had almost cost us both our lives. Of course, that made Marcus tell us off again for being a tacky couple and that we should leave all the lovely dovely stuff out of the team and focus on scoring points and catching snitches. That just made Adrian and Miles laugh, joking that Marcus wanted the impossible to happen. And we do keep the PDA down in public and during Quidditch practice, really. We both know that Derrick and Bole aren’t really a fan of the gays and we do have to play together with them. They are good beaters, well up to a good match against Fred and George of the Gryffindor team. So, Draco and I are good boys during practice and try to focus as much as possible on Quidditch and not on each other.
We spent the morning in the common room with our friends, close to the fire. I was sitting in Draco’s lap and Adrian shouted we should go cool down in the snow outside. He and his friends had just come back from a massive snow fight. And after lunch we took his advise and went for a stroll in the cold. Close to the castle, the snow was a mess, but the farther away we walked around the lake, the more untouched snow was around us. It was a nice afternoon, until Draco insisted we go back because he had to get ready (like three hours before the ball even started). He made me put a very elaborate braid in his hair, which took me like four tries to get right. But it made him look so beautiful, it was worth all the effort.
Harry looks at Draco who smiles at him. It’s hard to believe how okay Draco is with being deaf. They have been over this before. That Draco has always been deaf and thinks that sound will be distracting. Still, Harry can’t believe it. How is it that Draco never complains about not being able to hear? It’s so normal for Draco that he doesn’t even know what he’s missing. And maybe that is better than what happened to Uncle Sirius. He used to hear just fine, loved the sound of his own voice a little too much if Harry believes the stories Lily and Uncle Remus tell them. And then one single spell took it all away. It must be so different for them both. Harry hadn’t even thought about that. Draco’s never known anything else. For him, the world is a silent place. Harry wonders what that is like. Would he be okay to know he misses something that others have?
Some Hufflepuff first years come up the stairs. They are laughing. Harry hates them for it. Don’t they understand that they are all in danger at the moment? Most of all his family. His brother.
“Draco, Teddy isn’t ours either. Doesn’t mean I don’t see him as my own. He’s our boy. I know you feel that way too. There isn’t a thing in the world you won’t do for him. And all I want is to extend our little family. I don’t care how, as long as I can do it with you” Harry says.
It was worst between Marcus and Wood, the captain of the Gryffindor team. They throw hexes at each other every time they saw each other. At one moment Wood treated to hurt me or Draco and ever since then Marcus made sure there were always people protection us. It made it hard to show up to classes on time.
Most surprised is Harry about Iris. She doesn’t say a thing about Harry’s crush, or about the fact that he told her that he’s gay. She just said she didn’t care and that was it. But she did take Draco apart one morning to teach him signs that are related to personal hygiene. When Harry asked her about it, she declared that someone had to teach him. That if that was up to Harry, Draco would never know how to communicate about his hair struggles. And it would be a shame if his beautiful golden hair would suffer because of Harry’s lack of interest in taking care of his own. Harry wanted to be offended, but he agreed with how beautiful Draco’s hair is and that it would be a shame if Draco wouldn’t learn how to communicate about it.
I decided to turn around, walk back to the road and call for the Knight Bus again and go to London. I could wait till morning and then get my money and disappear. I would write to Draco and tell him what happened and maybe meet up with him somewhere to say goodbye.
I didn’t really look where I was going and walked straight into Hagrid when I turned around a corridor on my way back to Myrtle’s bathroom. He was on his way to the headmaster to get permission to put a charm around the hen coop since something was killing the roosters. It was either foxes or a Blood-Suckin’ Bugbear, whatever that may be. And then Hagrid took another look at me and could see that I was crying. He asked me again if I was sure that I was alright. I quickly pulled the sleeve of my rope over my eyes and told him it was nothing and that I had to get my books for my Defence Against the Dark Arts class I had next.
Hogwarts is the same as always. Other students greet Harry as he walks to the Gryffindor table and sits down with his friends. He looks over at the Slytherin table and spots Malfoy at the very end. Harry can only see his platinum blond hair as his back is turned to Harry. Some older students sit around Malfoy. They don’t pay Malfoy any attention. Harry wonders if this bothers Malfoy. It would bother Harry, to be ignored by everyone around him. If only Harry could see Malfoy’s face, then he could see if Malfoy is upset or not. He probably is, isn’t he? How could he not be?
Draco pulls Harry into another kiss and it isn’t until someone pounces on the compartment door that they break apart. They can’t stay here much longer. The train is probably almost empty by now. Harry takes Draco’s hand and together they go and get their trunks. They drag them out of the train and then get assaulted by Lily, who pulls Harry into a hug.
The next morning Draco was already up and out in the Great Hall having breakfast by the time I got out of bed. I dressed quickly and went to find him. He was sitting with Pansy and Daphne on either side of him like he was making sure I couldn’t sit down next to him. I walked up to him and greeted him, but he didn’t respond at all, didn’t even look at me. I begged him to please talk to me, but he wouldn’t. Nott was grinning on the other side of the table. He most think it’s really funny that Draco is ignoring me. When it was clear he wouldn’t speak to me I just walked over to the Gryffindor table and sat down next to Hermione to have my breakfast.
Harry doesn’t know what to say. In a way, Neville is right. Why do you have to come out as gay, but not as straight? It is kind of unfair. As if it isn’t hard enough to figure it all out, and then you have to announce it too. He looks at Neville, at his soft smile and accepting eyes. Harry moves without thinking. He pulls Neville in a quick hug and whispers a thank you before letting him go.
The wards around Draco’s room fall. Draco jumps upright and quickly wipes some tears out of his eyes. Not that it will do him any good. His eyes must be pussy and red and his cheeks are still wet from the tears. Everyone will know he’s been crying as soon as they see him.
“You’ve got Quidditch practise this afternoon?” Hermione asks. She still has a piece of parchment in front of her and her quill hovers above it. Her essay is longer than it’s supposed to be. She will lose points because of it. But Hermione will never understand that.
“I don’t want to die,” Potter said when the screams of the Mudblood had stopped. Aunt Bella had laughed and we’d had known, she was dead and gone.
Nobody answers. Nobody will ever answer him again. Not in the way Draco would do when Harry would lose it. When the pain and wounds of the war would open him up at random moments. When Harry would think life would never get any better.
Draco took it upon himself to inform his father about his success in potions. He was top of his class for this subject, he made sure the Mudblood wouldn’t beat him there. His father praised his good grades, but he didn’t invite Draco to join him in his dungeon. It was a disappointment and Draco sulked in his room for hours.
“Thank you,” Draco tells her. He doesn’t think it will do anything. His mother won’t come rushing to his side to help him. They’ve hardly spoken in the last couple of months. Draco doesn’t know what to say to her anymore since she didn’t even bother to show up to his wedding.
“He betrayed all of us, Neville,” James says. His voice is small and Harry spots moisture in his eyes. Harry can’t look away from them. He’s never seen his father like this. He’s always the brave one, never scared of anything. But today, he looks frightened.
I also showed Hermione the get well card I had received from Professor Lockhart. She thought it was amazing. I still think it’s too much. He was wishing me a speedy recovery as a concerned teacher. And the way he signed off is just ridiculous, as Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defence League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly’s Most-Charming-Smile Award. Who cared that he won the most-charming-smile award. That doesn’t say anything about his abilities as a wizard, or as a teacher. So I gave the card to Hermione. It made her happy and I enjoyed that at least one of us was still finding the strength to smile.
Last week, Draco and I had to come to Professor Snape’s office for a short talk. Nothing to worry about, he just wanted to make sure that we are both doing okay. I think we scared him good with almost dying a couple of times. He complimented me on my good marks for potions. And then he brought up our sleeping arrangements. It seems that Nott has been complaining. We had to promise Professor Snape that we would start using our own beds for now. We promised, but haven’t really kept to that promise. Now Draco just waits for everyone to fall asleep before he makes his way over to my bed. I’m glad he does that. I just sleep so much better with his arms around me.
“Ron assures me they never did it on our dining table, so please can we keep it?” Harry whispers in Draco’s ear.
They both look back at Malfoy. He still eats the chocolate Remus had given him. He doesn’t look at them but just stares out of the window where the landscape is again speeding by. Malfoy seems calmer now. More like the boy he normally is. Quiet and unaware of the world around him.
It started as soon as the other students were gone. On Sunday morning I found a dead rat in my bed and when I screamed from the shock, Nott and Crabbe doubled over in laughter. I throw the rat at Crabbe’s face and he ducked away with a frightened look. Luckily he’s scared that I would go after him next with my monster I keep hidden in the Chamber of Secrets.
It turns out she saw the grim in my cup. Draco with completely white at the word, Nott laughed and Crabbe yelled it was about time I would die for real. I first didn’t understand, until the professor explained that the grim is the omen of death. It’s shaped like a large black dog. I’ve seen it before when I ran away from home and on a book in Flourish and Blotts. And now it showed up again. Hermione said she thought it didn’t look like the Grim at all, trying to calm me down. And Greg tried to help with saying it only looks like the grim when you squeeze your eyes almost entirely shut, that it looks more like a monkey. But all that didn’t really help, Draco was looking at me like he was going to lose me, for real this time.
In slow motion, he walks up the stairs. He turns into the bedroom and looks at the bed. The sheets are made of silk. Normal cotton wouldn’t do for Draco. Harry pulls them off the bed and throws them in the corner. He’ll get some simple cotton bedding this afternoon. Once that don’t remind him of the emptiness of the house. The emptiness in his heart.
“I’m not asking Dumbledore. I’m going to kill the man, not ask him to risk everything to save my mother,” Draco says.
Malfoy writes that’s still stupid. Then they go over a couple of more words. Harry teaches Malfoy the signs for understand, don’t understand and goodbye. Malfoy makes notes of the movements and they practice all the signs one more time before they pack away the parchment and go down to dinner. Malfoy goes to sit at the Slytherin table, while Harry joins his friends at the Gryffindor table. He watches how Malfoy eats his meal in solitude. None of the other Slytherins pay him any attention.
After dinner one of the prefects led us to the dungeon, where at the bare stretch of the wall a doorway appears when you speak the password. Inside is the Slytherin common room. The room is long and has rough stone walls. Round, greenish lamps hang on chains. It’s furnished with lots of low backed black and dark green button-tufted, leather sofas, skulls and dark wood cupboards. On the walls are tapestries with wizards on it. One side of the common room has windows so we can look into the lake. It’s a bit weird to stay underground like this.
Neville pats Harry on his shoulder and then closes the curtain again. The door of the dorm opens and then it’s all silent around Harry. He doesn’t plan to get out of his bed today. He might not be able to stay in his dorm for the rest of the year, but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to.
Draco lifts his last finger and watches the dark clouds above him become smaller. The wind rushes around his face. His hair stays in place. Slicked back by Sleekeazy's Hair Potion. So different from the way Harry loves Draco’s hair. It should be flying loose and soften Draco’s features. Draco closes his eyes and pictures Harry in his mind. He opens his arms and is ready to welcome death.
“Yes, I do,” Iris says. “They called mum and dad. For a moment we all thought you were dead. I don’t want you to be dead.”
“Okay,” Neville says. They both stare at the ceiling again. Harry tries not to think of what it would mean if Draco rejects him as a friend because Harry is gay. He doesn’t want to lose him. Is that selfish of Harry, to keep his sexuality from the one boy he’s falling in love with? Because he is. He does not doubt that this is what it feels like to fall in love. His heart skips beats when he looks at Draco’s smile. His stomach is filled with butterflies and he blushes more and more when someone mentions Draco. The feeling is scary and great at the same time. And Harry has no idea what to do with it because he knows that Draco will never feel the same about him.
That was the only good thing about being in the papers though. Draco’s father has sent an angry letter to Draco, about how he’s disgracing the Malfoy name and how he wished he had a better son, one that would behave like a real man instead of the girl he’s stuck with now. Draco cried that night. He pretends he doesn’t care that his father hates him in front of everyone else, but he can’t lie to me. I can see how upset he was and I wish I could make this easier for him. All he ever wanted was his father to be proud of him and the fact that he knows that will never happen hurts.
After that, we were allowed to go and Hermione pulled me into an empty classroom as soon as we were far enough away from Professor Lockhart’s office. I know she is worried, about me hearing voices and she said it was a good choice not to tell them, it would only make me look guilty. She also explained to me what a Squid is, it’s someone born into a wizarding family without any magic, but I’m sure you would have already known that.
But like I said, I had been out flying my broom. It was raining and I was wet and dirty when I came back into the castle. I took the stairs down to the dungeons and ran into Nearly Headless Nick. He’s the Gryffindor ghost. He said I looked troubled and I responded that he looked troubled too. He told me he had wanted to join the Headless Hunt but was denied. It’s because his head is still attached to his body by an inch of skin and sinew. He also asked me what was bothering me and if he could help me. I was just in the process in asking him if he could mend a broken heart when Mrs Norris showed up, followed closely by Filth. I had to come with him because I had left a muddy puddle on the floor. In his office, he started to fill out a form with my name and crime. He was just about to write down my punishment when we were interrupted by a loud bang coming from the floor above. Filch ran out of the office screaming Peeves’ name, saying he would get him this time.
“Yes, fuck, of course, I’m angry. I was told our baby will never get born, and then they tell us we have to sit around for another week just so that they can cover their asses. So yes, I’m angry,” Harry screams.
Remus stops in his tracks and looks out over the grounds. The sun is hidden behind some clouds and the air gets colder by the minute. “He comes from a proud family,” he says.
“Draco, I’ve been wondering. And I think I need this, need to know that this isn’t something Voldemort did to me by turning me into his final Horcrux,” Harry continues.
Harry sighs. “What is wrong with you all?” he says. “What if mum and dad had just decided to do nothing when Uncle Sirius lost his hearing?”
Draco is silent. Harry thinks he hasn't spoken to anyone at all since they arrived. Blaise tried to ask him how he was doing when they had just arrived, but Draco hadn't responded. He stared at his hand, just like now. He watches as his finger scratches open his left forearm again. Harry wants to reach out and stop him from hurting himself.
Draco and Neville search the map. Harry wants to join in, but that will mean he’ll have to lean over Draco. And no matter how much Harry would love to do nothing else, it’s too dangerous. What if Harry does something stupid? He can’t control himself if he tempts faith. Instead, he picks up a sandwich and eats and just watches as Draco and Neville pore over the map.
Harry raises his shoulders. He doesn’t care what Neville and Ron think about this all. Aren’t they curious about Malfoy? Why doesn’t he want any help? Did Harry do something to him, and is that why he doesn’t want to be seen with them? Is it because they are in Gryffindor and he’s a Slytherin? Harry just needs to know. He needs to find out why Malfoy’s grey eyes are like thunder clouds when he spots Harry looking at him.
And it’s not only the mean words of Malfoy and the beatings from Nott, Crabbe and Goyle anymore. Malfoy and Nott also decided to start practising jinxes on me. They enjoy making me trip in the hallways using the trip jinx. And Malfoy locked my legs together with the leg-locker curse just outside the library the other day. Malfoy had waited until Hermione had gone and I was alone. Malfoy joked that he had been looking for someone to practice that on. I didn’t know the counter curse so I had to bunny hop all the way to the hospital wing to get Madam Pomfrey to help me. She asked me who did that to me, but I didn’t tell her. I don’t want any more trouble then I’m already in. When I told Hermione, Ron and Neville what had happened they said I should stand up to him and that Malfoy is used to walking all over people, but that’s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier. I told them I’m not as brave as them, if I was I would have been in Gryffindor with them. Malfoy said the same to me. That even though I hang around Gryffindor’s, it won’t turn me into a brave idiot like them; it only showed how stupid I was thinking they would stand by me when it would really matter. Didn’t I know that Gryffindor’s can’t be trusted? He said I must have damaged my head badly when the Dark Lord came for me. And maybe he’s right, it’s not like I’m any good in school. Every time I have to use my wand I get scared and then I mess everything up.
Draco hates how Harry points the blame to himself. Like he could be at fault for all this. He’s perfect, why would he be the reason Draco can’t get pregnant. It’s so mixed up. Draco wants to open his mouth and tell Harry that he could never be at fault. He sacrificed himself to save everyone else. Why would he be punished for that? He’s not like Draco, who helped that mad man, who let Death Eaters into Hogwarts, who tortured others to save his own life. So many people died because of Draco’s cowardly actions. If anyone is at fault, it is him, not Harry.
They both don’t say anything else. Harry is glad Hermione doesn’t push the subject. It’s clear that she suspects. And Harry can’t blame her. Neville also thinks it’s not just because Malfoy is deaf that Harry can’t leave him alone. And maybe it’s crazy to keep it a secret. Only Harry doesn’t want anyone to know yet. People will look at him differently. What if they won’t like him anymore? Or what if Wood kicks him off the Quidditch team? Harry can’t risk that. And it’s not as if there are a lot of gay students walking around Hogwarts, are they? It’s not common. And still frowned upon by many.
We also started our lessons with Professor Lupin. He still looks ill and Draco said it wasn’t that strange. He didn’t want to tell me why, but I know he and Hermione figured something out that I haven’t. It’s really annoying. But Draco says it’s not for him to tell and that I can figure it out for myself if I would just think about it some more.
Hermione and Neville both look at him as if he'd grown another head. “What?” Harry snaps. “Is it so wrong of me to want to help Malfoy?”
After that headmaster Dumbledore awarded Ron and I both Special Awards for Services to the School and he gave out points for the house cup. Neville got 100 points for finding help, Ron got 150 points for facing danger to save a friend and he gave me 200 points for bravery and courage to face the Basilisk to save the boy I love. Professor McGonagall escorted Ron and Neville back to their own common room and Professor Snape took Professor Lockhart to the hospital wing, leaving me alone with the headmaster. He first thanked me for showing real loyalty to him and then he told me something disturbing. The only reason why I can speak Parseltongue is because Lord Voldemort can, as a last remaining descendant of Salazar Slytherin. Headmaster Dumbledore thinks that Voldemort has transferred some of his own powers into me the night he killed you. I don’t know what to think of that. It scares me. I wondered if I was only Slytherin because of that part in Voldemort inside me since you both had been Gryffindors. Headmaster Dumbledore assured me that the hat would see more than just the little part of Voldemort that is inside me and that I myself had qualities that Salazar himself valued in his students, like my determination and cleverness. He also said that I cherish the once I love abidingly and unconditionally and that that was very Slytherin of me. And then he continued that I could have also been in Gryffindor because I also have a lot of traits that are part of that house, like my bravery (even though I don’t feel brave most of the time) and my heroic actions last year and now. And the fact that I had pulled Gryffindor’s sword out of the head should tell me that house placements aren’t as black and white as we would like to pretend. And that I shouldn’t worry about the small part of Voldemort inside me because that was not what made me the person that I am or determent my placement in Slytherin.
“Oh, fuck,” Harry says. He turns around and grins at Wood. “I’ll be right there, Wood. Family emergency,” Harry tells him.
Harry gets a hold of Malfoy’s arms and keeps them in front of his chest. He looks Malfoy in the eyes. “It’s okay,” he says.
At some point, a Bludger hit Krum who broke his nose, but the referee didn’t see because his broom was on fire and Krum just continued the game with a bleeding nose. At that moment the Irish Seeker suddenly went into a dive, he’d seen the snitch. Krum sped after him and they drawled level while they hurtled towards the ground. Lynch smashed into the ground and Krum rose up into the air, his fist held high, a glint of gold in his hand. He’d caught the snitch. The final score was 160 points for Bulgaria and 170 for Ireland. Remus asks why Krum had cot the Snitch and both me, Draco and Tonks explained to him that it was clear that Bulgaria was never going to catch up to the Irish.
After seeing Draco do it so successfully, I was sure I could do it too. So I tried again. Only I fainted again. This time I could hear dad shouting: ‘lily, take Harry and go! It’s him! Go! Run! I’ll hold him off.’ When I woke up again I said that I heard dad and Draco hugged me close. I was crying and Professor Lupin suggested now might be a good time to stop. Only I wanted to try again. And the third time still wasn’t perfect, I only made a huge, silver shadow come out of my wand, but it stopped me from fainting, so that was a good thing. Draco said he was proud of me and Professor Lupin gave us a large bar of Honeydukes’ best chocolate to eat.
Everyone was very excited to learn more about this Chamber, but professor Binns said it was all nonsense. That the school had been searched and that no such chamber excited. I didn’t really listen to all the questions the other students threw at professor Binns. I was more worried about Draco’s pale face. He had been looking out the window since the chamber had been brought up. The whole subject made him feel uncomfortable and that worries me. What if he knows something about all this? What if he’s the one who wrote that message on the wall and petrified Mrs Norris? Would Draco really be capable of doing that?
Harry doesn’t say a word. He just stares at the front of the class where Binns has started his lecture. Not that Harry hears a word that is being said. Sometimes he hates his friends. What’s good about Malfoy struggling with school for no good reason? And why doesn’t he want to be helped by Harry? Harry would be grateful if someone would help him if he couldn’t hear a single thing. Even now, when Harry wishes he couldn’t hear his friends move on to the next topic as if Malfoy isn’t important, he’s glad he can hear them. And maybe they are right. Maybe Malfoy isn’t that important. He did manage to pass the last two years without any help from Harry and his friends. And what does Harry know about him anyway? He only knows he’s deaf and doesn’t speak. It doesn’t mean he’s an okay guy. Or worth Harry’s time. Maybe Harry should just forget about him and focus on the upcoming Quidditch match.
“We’ll have to adjust our plan,” Harry says. “Check the map more often, and stuff like that. Maybe place some detecting charms inside the castle, just to be sure.” His jaw is set and he makes strong eye contact with Neville. “But catching Pettigrew isn’t stupid,” he says. “You’re the Chosen One. I’m sure that means you are supposed to go after him. Just as you were the one who had to protect the stone, and be the one to save Ginny from Tom Riddle’s memory.”
It will happen tonight. The Dark Lord lies alone and friendless, abandoned by his followers. His servant has been chained these twelve years. Tonight, before midnight the servant will break free and set out to rejoin his master. The Dark Lord will rise again with his servant’s aid, greater and more terrible than ever he was. Tonight before midnight the servant will set out to rejoin his master.
In the end, Draco wasn’t capable of killing another person. He froze when he had Dumbledore at wand point. And he hesitated when the Dark Lord ordered him to kill an insubordinate Death Eater. As punishment, he had to give his father’s potion to his mother. He was chained to the wall as he watched her wither away in pain. Her body slowly dissolving into nothing more than bones. It hadn’t been as exciting as when Draco had been a child. This was not some insignificant Muggle, this was his mother, a pure-blood witch.
Draco laughs and tells Hermione they will. They say their goodbyes and Draco puts his phone away. He rests his head on Harry’s shoulder and watches the telly with him in silence. His mind races and he can still feel the hole in his heart, but the strong arm around his shoulders helps, and maybe soon the pain will be replaced by the joy of a new little miracle of their own.
And then they arrived. Man in black cloaks and masked. They approached Voldemort on their knees and kissed the hem of his robe, calling him master. Then they would back up and stand. A circle formed around Voldemort, with gaps in between, like more people should still come. But Voldemort started to talk. He was not happy with the Death Eaters. Went on and on about how they never went looking for him and help him. One of the men asked for forgiveness and was punished by receiving the Curcio curse. Voldemort told them they should all serve them for thirteen years before he would even think of forgiving them. He then rewarded Wormtail for his help by giving him a silver hand that took the place of the hand he had chopped off.
The sun is bright today and there is hardly a cloud in sight as Harry and Draco make their way to the Quidditch field. Last weekend was the match against Ravenclaw. Gryffindor won without any issue. Harry waited to catch the Snitch until his team was over two hundred points ahead. It was kind of sad to see the Ravenclaw team get smashed like that, but Slytherin still has to play against them and they are sure to keep on going until they have enough points to beat Gryffindor for the cup. Gryffindor’s only hope is the Hufflepuff team. Maybe they will be able to beat Slytherin. That will be the only way Gryffindor can hold onto the cup this year.
As soon as Madam Hooch was out of sight Malfoy and Nott started laughing and making fun of Neville. One of the Gryffindor girls told them to shut up, and that made Parkinson snap at her. I was afraid they were going to fight, but then Malfoy picked up a glass ball from the ground and said it was the stupid thing Longbottom’s gran had sent him. Ron told him to give it to him, but Malfoy refused and said he would leave it in a tree. Ron yelled at him to give it back. And then Malfoy got on his broom and took off. He hovered level with the topmost branches of an oak and called for Ron to come and get it. Ron took his broom and was planning to take off when Hermione pulled on his arm and told him he couldn’t, that he would get them all in trouble. But Ron pushed her to the side and flew into the air after Malfoy. But Malfoy was a better flyer than Ron, so he moved away from him quickly, manoeuvring like a practice flyer. He smiled while moving around, lighting up his whole face. And Ron just became redder and redder while he tried to catch up with Malfoy. After a while, Malfoy threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground. He landed with grace and stepped off his broom like it was nothing. Ron stumbled to the ground next to him, but I wasn’t really looking at him, and Malfoy noticed that my eyes were on him and shouted at me to stop staring with my stupid face. When Madam Hooch came back she cancelled the rest of the lesson and told us we will continue next week. That saddened me because I wanted to try to fly like Malfoy had done. It looks like it’s a lot of fun.
Oh, and then Dumbledore gave away even more points. And I think they were the most deserved points. He said that there are all kinds of courage. That it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. And therefore he awarded 25 points to Draco. It still wasn’t enough to win, but Draco was so happy to get points for bravery that I didn’t care at all that we didn’t win the house cup.
And it isn’t only the students and teachers that make school suck. I had to go to this crazy wand weighing ceremony for the tournament. And that would have been fine if just Rita Skeeter hadn’t been there. She’s a journalist and she wanted to interview me. Mr Bagman said it was fine, so I kind of had no choice than go along with it. She took me into a broom closet so the others wouldn’t disturb us. And then she took out her Quick-Quotes Quill and started asking me questions. Only the quill didn’t write down anything I said. It just made up things, like that my eyes were filling up with tears when we talked about my parents. We didn’t even really talk about you, so why would I get teary-eyed. And she kept asking me why I entered. I said I hadn’t but she didn’t believe me.
Oh, and because Draco’s birthday was in the middle of exams we are going to celebrate it this Saturday. We are having a party in one of the unused classrooms in the dungeon to celebrate his and my birthday (since mine is during the summer and we are not sure if we can celebrate it together). All our friends are coming and Marcus and Terence have arranged that there will be music. Fred and George have promised to supply the food. It’s going to be amazing. I even got Draco a present. First I thought of buying him a new notebook to write in, but he’s afraid to write down any of his thoughts and feelings right now, so I lost that idea quickly. It’s hard to find a present for him because he already has everything. But I think I have found the perfect present. I will tell you what it is and if he liked it when I’m back at the Dursleys. Now I just want to enjoy the little time we still have left here at school since there is a big change that Draco won’t be coming back next year. But we will make it work somehow. We love each other and nobody is going to stop us from being together anymore.
Draco lifts his lips and kisses Harry’s skin. “We’ll be together forever,” he whispers. “It won’t hurt, I promise. And I’ll be here when you wake up.” He puts his mouth over the wounds again and drinks more of Harry’s blood.
"The test is positive, " Draco says as he walks back into the bedroom. Harry hums without looking up and resumes to read his book. It’s not the reaction Draco hoped for. It’s the reaction he’d expected. Harry hasn’t initiated anything intimate in a while. It’s like he doesn’t care anymore if Draco falls pregnant or not. Maybe he already found another person that might be easier, one who can give Harry the family he so badly wants. Only the thought of losing Harry, having to face this world alone again, Draco doesn’t know if he can do it. So it will be up to him to make sure they at least try. Maybe, as long as Harry believes it’s still possible he won’t leave. So Draco takes off his t-shirt and pants and lays down on the bed next to Harry.
But back to Sirius his love life. He’s struggling. He pretends he’s okay with Professor Lupin moving on. And he said he’s glad that Remus is happy. Doesn’t change the fact that I’ve heard him cry a couple of times now when he thinks we are asleep. He’s been talking to you, dad. I’ve heard him, telling you he wished you were here to make him see that everything will be alright, just like you used to do when you were younger. He misses you. He needs his best friend now that the man he loves has moved on. I know you would be here if you could, that you didn’t want to die on us. But we do miss you and we still love you. I wish I could ask you what I do to make Sirius feel better, to get him to smile more. He hardly smiles anymore. I’m truly worried.
Pansy puts her glass of wine down on the table. Her hands wring together on her lap. “I don’t know how to tell you. But Blaise and Ginny were right. I can’t keep hiding this from you.”
‘I’m sorry,’ Harry writes. ‘I won’t do it again.’ He wants to change the subject, forget that the boy he’s falling for will never love him back. ‘So, what is the sign you came up with?’ he asks.
At that moment Malfoy stirs. He blinks with his eyes and then sits up a little straighter. He looks at Harry and then towards Remus. Harry smiles at him, in the hope Malfoy understands that everything is okay. Remus fishes another bar of chocolate from his pocket and hands it to Malfoy.
It’s a lovely day today. Exams are over and the results are in. I’ve done okay this year. My potions mark is an Exceeds Expectations and I still can’t believe it. I’ve got Acceptable on most of my exams and an Outstanding for Defence Against the Dark Arts. Draco’s marks are all Outstanding and he’s top of our class in all subjects except Charms where Hermione managed to beat him by a couple of points.
Harry brings a piece of sausage to his mouth. He chews on it without tasting it. Hermione leans against him for a second in comfort and then changes the subject. Plans are getting made for the day. Harry doesn’t listen to them. He just focuses on getting some food past his lips. He’s hungry, but on the other hand, he doesn’t want to eat. And all the while people keep staring at him. Is this how it always feels like for Neville? The looks and whispers are a pain, only reminding Harry how one little kiss ruined everything.
A massive smile breaks out on Harry’s face. He leans in and kisses Draco again. “I’ll make sure he knows how important it is that we safe her,” he promises. Draco lets him take his hand and guide him out of the room towards Dumbledore’s office.
Also, I'll be going on holiday in a view days and will be without internet for most of the trip so it will be at least two weeks before I'll be able to update this story again.
But I will get to that because after Hagrid had come in he made a knot in uncle Vernon’s rifle and then he gave me a birthday cake. It was the first cake I ever had; at least that I can remember. I’m sure you would have made me a birthday cake for my first birthday. Hagrid turned on the fire and made tea and sausages. I didn’t really know who he was and why he was there so I asked. He got very angry at uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. I was very confused. Hagrid said you were famous, that I was famous and he talked about our world until he realized I really didn’t know. He screamed at uncle Vernon some more and uncle Vernon forbade him to tell me. But he didn’t listen and told me I’m a wizard and gave me my letter. It was a letter to inform me that I have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Then Hagrid sends out an owl to a Professor Dumbledore before uncle Vernon told him I wasn’t going. That’s when I found out they had known all along that I was a wizard. Aunt Petunia started screaming about you, mom, and that you ran off with dad and then got yourselves blown up. I got angry then; they always told me that you had died in a car crash. Hagrid also got very angry, saying that it was an outrage. So I asked him what had happened. He became very nervous but told me about the wizard who went bad, named Voldemort. And that this wizard was becoming very powerful. And Hagrid told me that when Voldemort came after you ten years ago on Halloween, he killed you both and tried to kill me. But that I lived and that is why I have the lighting scar on my forehead. It made me very sad. Hagrid said that Voldemort is probably still out there somewhere, without his powers. I hope he’s wrong and that the evil man is dead.
Harry wants to ask Malfoy how he communicates with his family, but he doesn’t know how. Not if Malfoy doesn’t know sign language. Why didn’t he ever learn? Just getting by with lip reading is impossible. Uncle Sirius once told Harry how hard it is. That it takes a lot of practice and energy. And even then, he can only pick up half of the words. Is this why Malfoy is always on his own. Because he can’t communicate with others? He must be extremely lonely. Harry wouldn’t survive if he couldn’t be part of his social group. His friends are what makes school fun. And not just that. If it wasn’t for Hermione Harry wouldn’t be able to get proper grades. He will never be motivated enough.
The car stops on the driveway, and Neville and Luna step out. Luna moves the car seat so Draco can get out.
When we came out of the tunnel Snape and Neville just arrived at the Whomping Willow. Professor Snape pointed his wand at Black right away and said he knew that Lupin would help him, that Dumbledore should have listened to him. Lupin tried to explain, but Snape wouldn’t listen. It was Draco who calmed down professor Snape and convinced him that it had all been Peter Pettigrew. Snape looked at Pettigrew in surprise and shook his head. Then he turned back to Lupin. It seemed that Lupin hadn’t had his potion yet that evening and Snape was just handing it to him when a cloud shifted and we were all bathed in moonlight.
So we asked Hagrid about the night he won Norbert and found out that the stranger wouldn’t take off his cloak, so Hagrid had no idea who it had been. But that was not the worsted of it, Hagrid had told the stranger about Fluffy to prove that he could handle a dragon and by doing so he had given away how to get past Fluffy. You just have to play it a little music to make it sleep.
Draco stares at his left forearm. The Dark Mark is black and stands out from his pale skin. A tear tracks over Draco’s cheek. He should get up, take his wand and ward his room. Others might hear him cry. Or scream Harry’s name in his sleep, just before he wakes up from another nightmare. Only Draco can’t find the energy needed to get up. The only thing he can do is stare at the betrayal on his arm.
Malfoy presses his lips together and his eyes narrow. The grey in them darkens and Harry swallows at the sight. Malfoy pulls the parchment away from Harry and pushes his quill onto it. When Harry gets the parchment back the writing is bolder than before. The words ‘you didn’t’ hit home. Harry wants to reach out and touch Malfoy, to let him know that Harry never meant to make it worse.
“You think he’s?” Neville asks from the side. Harry nods. Malfoy has to be. Harry doesn’t know why he never noticed before. There is a completely different reason why Malfoy never speaks. It’s not because the boy is a pure-blood git who thinks he’s better than everyone. He probably doesn’t have a clue what others have said and just doesn’t know what to answer. If Harry is right, Malfoy can’t hear a single sound around him.
When she was done with Neville, she checked over Harry and when she was satisfied with the results of her diagnostics she moved to Draco. Snape was still with him and helped to translate Madam Pomfrey’s words. And then he had a discussion with Malfoy about the need to inform Draco’s parents about the events that took place this night. Draco begged him not to, and in the end, Snape agreed. Draco was not hurt or in any trouble, there was no reason to involve his parents. Draco teared up and signed a thank you at Snape.
Draco takes a deep breath and continues his story. “Harry also came to the Astronomy tower to get away. We were both messed up. With the Dark Lord taking resident here, and Harry having witnessed the death of Cedric Diggory. We talked. Most nights we just talked. About everything. And somehow, along the way, I fell in love with him and he with me.”
I don’t know what to do now. I have no way to contact anyone who could help me. And I still don’t have my letters. No kind words of Hermione telling me summer will be over before I know it. No funny stories from Ron about his crazy family. No words from Draco to ease my mind. And even if I had the letters, I’m sure there weren’t any letters from Draco between them. I would have recognized his handwriting. And that is one of the things that keep me up at night. Why didn’t he write to me? I thought that the kiss he gave on my cheek when we arrived at King Cross mend something. And I had hoped that maybe we could become boyfriends. Why would he kiss me and then change his mind?
Harry makes a fist with one of his hands. His nails bite into his palm. Then he sighs and picks up his quill again. ‘Why would your father be angry?’ he writes. ‘He should have told the Headmaster the moment you started school. It’s unfair to let you struggle as you did.’
We caught up with them at the top of the stairs and Draco forced his sock into his father’s hands, telling him that he would still be his father no matter how much he would try to pretend he wasn’t. Mr Malfoy was looking at his son in disbelief, pulled the sock from the diary, throwing it towards Dobby and looked furiously from the ruined book to Draco. I had to swallow away the no I wanted to shout at Draco’s father’s response to it all. He said that Draco would be going to Durmstrang next year, to teach him some respect for his elders. And then he just walked off calling for Dobby to follow him.
Harry nods his head. Calling Remus uncle in class also feels wrong. He’ll just have to get used to the fact that his uncle is now his teacher. Something moves in a big tank at the back of the office. Harry points at it. “What’s in there?” he asks.
Harry turns quickly and picks up his quill. His heart reaches in his chest and a smile forms on his face. Malfoy has beautiful eyes when he gets angry. Harry should get him riled up more often.
On the day of the match, I was very nervous and woke up very early. I stayed in bed with Draco’s arms around me and tried to relax. I think I didn’t do a good job because I woke up Draco. We kissed for a long time until I felt a little better. We went down to breakfast and I just tried to eat some porridge, while Draco started to make us both toast. The rest of the team joined us not much later. Everyone was kind of nervous, which made me feel a little better.
The rush of wind around him stops. A strong arm grabs him around the waist and he’s hoisted onto Adrian’s broom.
I had to clean the kitchen and uncle Vernon promised to flay me when the Masons had left and I had hoped it wouldn’t get any worse than this, but it did. Only an owl came to deliver a letter from the improper use of magic office of the ministry of magic. It turned out that Mrs Mason is mortally afraid of birds and the Masons left, making uncle Vernon lose the deal he wanted to make with Mr Mason. Uncle Vernon then locked me in my room with a mad gleam dancing in his eyes. He laughed about that I was never going back to Hogwarts, and that I would get expelled if I would try to magic myself out of my room.
“I would have been a good big brother,” Teddy states. He looks determent with his head held high, and his arms crossed in front of his chest.
Something hits Harry. It’s not the ground and he starts to slow down. He opens his eyes and spots the stands in the distance. He can see Draco’s blond hair next to Hermione’s big bush of curls. They must be so scared. Harry wants to shout that it will all be okay. But when he opens his mouth, the ground collides with him. His head bounces on the grass and then the world goes black.
Draco shakes his head. It’s not good news at all. It’s just confirmation of what he’s thought all this time. He’s getting punished for his mistakes, and Harry gets to pay the price for it.
Harry laughs beside him and lifts his head. The smile on his face is beautiful. Draco still can’t believe it’s all real. That for the last five months he’s been allowed to introduce himself as Draco Potter, the famous Harry Potter’s husband. And now they are having a baby, expending their little family one small piece at a time.
A new couple walks into the waiting room. The man looks at Draco and Harry and shakes his head. “It’s a shame,”  he mutters at his wife, who pulls him to some chairs one row away.
The first day back to class was hard. It seems like everyone knows what I did and Nott and Crabbe make fun of it every chance they get. Draco told them to shut up, but they don’t really listen to him. I told him it’s okay, but Draco gets upset when people talk about what I did. I think I scared him and I feel bad about that. I never thought he would care about what happened to me. I hate that his father had forbidden him from even looking at me the wrong way.
They reach Dumbledore’s office and Draco is surprised to see Granger, Chang and one of the younger Beauxbatons students. He has no clue why he would be summoned to a meeting with these three. It’s not like they have anything in common.
Harry blinks the last tears away, glad for the change of subject as he doesn’t want to think about how he’s hurt Draco by falling in love with him. “I still don’t get how she can get to all her classes,” he says.
“No, Ron, fuck, it’s worse, okay. Just, please, I need to… Draco, he’s a mess. It’s all a mess right now. I promise I’ll explain tomorrow.”
I ran away from home yesterday. Don’t get mad, please. It’s just that Aunt Marge came to visit. She’s a horrible person. And I kind of lost my temper when she insulted you both. The week had started off so good. On the night of my birthday, I received a letter from Draco, the first one this summer. He was okay and still allowed to go to Hogwarts the coming school year. He said it had helped that Hermione hadn’t had enough time to study for her exams, making it possible for him to become the top of our class. It had helped his mother to convince his father. Not that they are on speaking turns. Draco says they are fighting all the time. He hides away in his wing of the house (I still can’t believe he has his own wing, I’m already glad I finally have my own room) to avoid them the best he can.
The grounds outside are busy. It seems that every student in the school has decided to celebrate the end of exams in the fresh air. Harry and his friends walk around the lake and in the end sit down close to the forest. The trees give some nice shade, which is welcomed by Ron and Neville, who tend to turn red when the sun is out.
Harry snaps his head to Neville for a second. He stands with his chest out and his shoulders pulled back. “What about me?” he says. “Scared yet of the boy who destroyed your lord?”
Neville shakes his head. “Do you think they ever thought Wormtail would betray them as he did?” he asks.
When the exams started Fluffy was still growling behind the door on the third-floor corridor, so the stone was still safe. I tried not to think of it too much, so I could concentrate on my exams.
Teddy nods and then pulls his little backpack off his back. “I’ve packed my own bag,” he announces proudly.
"Thanks, mate." Harry smiles softly. When all else fails, he knows he’ll always have Ron and Hermione to help him out.
Ron looks at Neville and Harry. “I don’t believe you,” he says. “If it was nothing serious, you wouldn’t mind telling me.”
With dread, Harry pulls a piece of parchment out of his bag and starts to write. ‘You want me to read this?’ he asks.
It’s that thought that gets Harry out of bed in the end. With slow movements, he brushes his hair and cleans his teeth. He pulls on a comfortable sweater and some jeans. He takes a deep breath and stares at the door. Once he steps out of the dorm it will all be real. Harry shivers and he feels a little sick. He knows that all the people that matter are okay with him being gay. Well, almost all of them. There is one that didn’t seem to be okay with it at all. Why did that one person have to be Draco? Why couldn’t it have been someone like Seamus or Dean? They are just some dorm mates, and Harry doesn’t care about them in the same way he cares about Draco. He could have dealt with their disapproval of his sexuality.
And then Christmas day arrived. I woke up to Draco screaming. It’s not the most pleasant way to wake up. Draco was telling Dobby off for scaring him by hovering over them. I muttered that Draco scared me but they both didn’t bother to respond. Dobby was telling Draco he was sorry, that he was only in our room to wish both Draco and me a Merry Christmas and give us our presents. For a moment Dobby was scared that Draco hadn’t meant it when he told Dobby that he could visit us, so Draco hurried to assure Dobby that off course he was and that Draco was happy to see him. I just thought it was quite awkward since Draco and I were both naked under our sheets. This because Christmas Eve was spent. Well, it was different now that we had switched roles, but still so amazing. If it was up to me we would never leave our bed again.
The Dark Lord gets up from his seat when Draco enters the dining room. It’s a big deal, Draco knows this. The others look at him with contempt. He’s done the one thing that even the Dark Lord couldn’t manage. He’d killed Harry Potter. And now they all hate him. But they won’t say it. Unless the Dark Lord turns against Draco and kills him for taking his prey.
“I would think you didn’t care about my favourites anymore. Since you packed up all your stuff and left without saying a word.”
And then the entire Great Hall became silent. It was time to find out who would be the Hogwarts champion. We all hoped it would be one of the Slytherins who had put their name in the goblet. Adrian and Miles were clearly nervous. They both looked scared while we waited for the goblet to light up again. I must say we were all a little disappointed when Dumbledore told us that the Hogwarts champion was Cedric Diggory from Hufflepuff. The Hufflepuff table went crazy and Cedric was grinning while he walked to the other room.
‘I want to,’ Harry pens down. ‘The weekend after the game we can go out to the field and I’ll show you what it feels like to fly.’
The next day I spent a lot of time on braiding Draco’s hair. I was so nervous that the hair kept slipping through my shaking fingers. When it was finally done we went down to the Great Hall as a team. The Slytherin table applauded us on our entrance. It was nice to see how the entire house was supporting us, especially because the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs had cheered for the Gryffindor team when they walked in. Only Luna had touched up her outfit with the Slytherin colours. She smiled at us when we left the Great Hall.
