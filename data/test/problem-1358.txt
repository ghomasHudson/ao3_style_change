"Freeze, Missy."
At the far end of the infirmary was a curtain enshrouded cot and behind it Severus heard soft breathing in the otherwise unearthly silence of the normally bustling room.
She released Draco's hand as soon as they landed, just in case anyone saw them and got the wrong idea.
"I can't believe you," Blaise said. "That is too terribly tedious. I mean, you're in love with the boy of your dreams, and he's in love back and you can't give me one bit of titillating information? Haven't I regaled you with endless tales of my exciting and romantic sex life?"
"What's so bad about the manor Draco? Scared of a bunch of girls?"
"Unfortunately," Draco said, using a damp towel to snuff out the last smouldering bits of his shirt, "we got there after they moved the weapon and now we don't know where it went."
curse or his fit of temper.
The air inside the tent filled with a loud whining noise and Draco heard a shout behind him. He turned and saw that there was a cloak-covered body on the floor of the tent and Voldemort was moving towards him , a curse on his lips.
"Then maybe I'm getting sick."
"Sorry, I had to grab the diaper bags. What was Harry doing here?"
Paige felt the pink heat of a blush rise up on her face and she turned towards her sister who had been giggling the entire time in the hopes that Severus wouldn't notice.
"Severus? You're awake?"
Harry shook his head to try and clear it before looking at the clock on the wall and wincing. He, Ron, Hermione, and Neville had a strict policy on checking in and he had violated it by a lot. He was glad to have survived the attack, of course, but now he was pretty sure his friends were going to kill him.
"Nephew? I didn't know you had any family, besides Angelu—"
The first chance he had, Severus ran.
He grabbed the boy, a dead weight in his arms, and half carried, half dragged him towards the doorway, but as he heard the liquid bubbling behind him, he cursed himself, he should have stopped the flame. Pushing Blaise to the floor as gently as he could, he spread his robe and lay on top of the pregnant Slytherin.
Severus smiled gently, "I know. I must be over tired."
As Paige watched, the robe was cut away from the man to reveal a pair of jeans and a midnight blue sweater, both burned in patches, revealing livid red skin beneath.
Severus pushed his wand a little harder into the flesh of the were in front of him, pulling the man's focus back before the infernal giggling started again. Looking over the tan shoulder at Spike, Snape arched an eyebrow, "William, I reiterate, where the hell have you brought us?"
Harry let Ron answer the Medi-witch, focusing on holding Draco as still as the blond boy had held him on the battlefield, hoping he wouldn't hurt himself.
A low giggle came from the lightly clad figure, the towel still covering his face. Severus reached his free hand forward and snatched the towel away, and the giggling became louder still, carrying a sharp edge that raised the hairs on Severus's neck.
She turned and dragged Phoebe away from the baby. "I'm running over to P3 with Harry. I thought it might be nice to have a toast and we don't keep the hard stuff in the house."
She took time to study his still form.
Blaise before that and Pansy alone the time previous? You know, he has a lot of stamina for a Griffindor."
It had been over two months since Harry heard that laugh, and even then it was a rare and magical thing. He felt drawn towards the merry blond like a magnet until he found himself only a few inches away.
Practically purring under the sensation of strong fingers running over his scalp, Harry said, "It's worse than you think. He's going to the Slytherin party. Truly, we are doomed."
Paige dived behind the kitchen island and looked for something to orb. Kitchens were full of weapons.
Spike rushed forward, pushing the other two over so he could get closer to the blond boy. His vamp face flickered in and out as he turned to Piper, "What happened?"
Moving towards the tent, Draco looked for an opening of some sort. Not seeing one, as he got closer, he pulled out his pocket knife. The Swiss Army knife was a death day gift from Spike and it had a knife blade and a saw. Draco picked the knife blade and pushed it through the thick canvas wall of the tent. It slipped in easily enough, and he switched to the saw blade to cut through the fabric and open a hole big enough to get into.
"I did, mate. The next generation of Weasleys is on its way and it will be half-Slytherin."
Severus looked back at the picture, his eyes widening as he felt Paige press a kiss against his cheek.
Luckily he spotted Paige standing next to her sisters and managed to catch the red head's gaze, hoping she would read his plea for help in his eyes.
Blaise reddened and pressed a soft kiss to the baby's forehead. "Ah well, he's asleep. Chances are good he didn't hear anything, and if he did he's too little to remember it," Blaise said.
At Harry's insistence Draco rode behind him on a proud raven charger, the bag held between their bodies. It was a long ride and as the adrenaline of the chase wore off Draco found himself drooping over his possessions. He heard Harry and Ron speaking about the weather and the existence of wood elves, but paid their words no mind. There was no point in it now.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry smiled, "I don't know why. I never minded."
"Oh Draco, you look wonderful. So handsome at this age," she said, pinching his cheeks firmly.
Draco dozed slightly, waking as Harry pulled onto the shoulder of the road in a abandoned area. He turned to his boyfriend and saw Harry pointing a wand at him.
Well hidden again Draco went about his duties with a light heart. He had been to a ball, and danced. It was something to dream about.
The blond snorted lightly, and shifted, but didn't wake.
Embarrassment.
His arguments defused, Blaise took a careful seat on one of the high stools that lined the long oak work table.
"Did you see that?"
"No, no. I don't disagree that they would, though I'd rather not think about it, but that- it didn't sound right."
"Piper, Draco's over there."
The boy's tear-filled eyes met hers and again Paige was struck by a sense of déjà vu. It drifted away as the blond spoke, "Maybe you're right. But you'll stay with him, in case he wakes up?"
"I learned a few things." Harry took a chance and dropped his shoulder, tucking it and turning sideways so he was away from the were. Alex was between Harry and the door, so he put his back against the wall and brought his wand up again.
Severus found himself hemmed in by the stairwell, Hermione and the two young men and he was starting to attract attention from the other party guests. He wanted to turn and run away, but though he may consider himself a coward now, he didn't want to be obvious about it.
Alex turned, the glass in his hand swinging heavily and spraying some water over Harry's legs. "Dammit Spike, this is not the time. We have more trouble on our hands than I wanted to deal with again and I—"
Paige smiled, "If you'd like I can do it on purpose so next time you'll know the difference." She drew back her fist, aiming carefully.
"Stop staring. I'm dead and I know it. What's worse is I look it. Creepy, huh?"
Unfortunately the moment they reached the zoo Jamie began to wail and when they went through the standard unhappy baby checklist- hungry, cold, hot, toilet- they discovered that his diaper bag had been left behind. Piper went to get hers, but it was gone as well.
Harry stood up carefully as the floor shifted beneath his feet and spotted Hermione in the crowd, waving her over to where Draco now lay on the floor, unconscious.
If this was Draco's idea of a joke, it wasn't funny. Reaching out, Severus found his wand where he would have left it, on the bedside table, and pointed it at the stranger, at least three very painful hexes fighting for space on his tongue.
Breath wheezing in his chest he ran faster, hearing the men and animals approach. As they came closer the voices were more distinctive.
Phoebe was unconscious, and a bump was already rising on her forehead. Paige focused her healing ability on the forming bruise and the color and swelling receded slightly. Phoebe stirred slightly, opening her eyes, and Paige stood up slowly, offering her older sister a helping hand and assistance to the overstuffed armchair next to the couch.
"Grey? Come here Grey."
Now that more than half of the bottle was gone, and the room and the view it contained were pleasantly blurry, Blaise and Pansy had turned their attention to a more vital issue.
"Oh, how so?" Draco's body was filling with happiness, at Harrys touch.
Harry felt tingles in his fingertips. "The hospital, you’re alright, but you're going to come stay with me for a little while." Draco released Harry's hand without realizing he was holding it and jolted up.
"Yeah. Sorry I can’t help it. I just find you so sexy." Harry said.
"Good Boy." Draco said as he patted Harry's cheek. He moved away from Harry leaving him craving more, and sat back down in his chair. "On your knees in front of me." Draco ordered gesturing to the space in front of him. Harry obeyed immediately, and Draco had to fight not to smile at the sight. "Here are the ground rules; you will refer to me as master, nothing else, and you must say yes master after every order."
"I'm looking for someone." Before Miguel could speak or even move Harry pulled out his wand stupefied the two bounces in the room, apparated behind Miguel and held it to his throat.
"I'll be back soon to prep him for surgery." She gave Harry a nod and left the room.
I let my head fall against the back of my arm chair for a moment as I ran through a list of everything that I needed to do, but my thoughts were soon interrupted by muffled screaming. I jumped from my chair and ran to Harry's room. I was by his side in minutes.
"Thank you, sweetheart. I hope work goes well today." Harry smiled. Then the both flooed away.
"Come with me, baby!" As I said that we both came undone. Shaking in each other's arms as we rode out our highs.
Again, once he'd relaxed the tingling sensation was back but this time, he felt something new. Draco's tongue on the head of his cock.
"Well, I'm not him, and I'll never be like him. I want to take care of you, Draco." He brushed Draco's cheek and felt Draco flinch at first but then melt into the soft touch.
"That's perfect!" Draco exclaimed. He gave Harry his address Then they bid each other goodnight and went to bed.
He stood before Draco and stoked his huge cock.
"Draco?" he waited for blue eyes to meet his. "I really do love you."
The day they had to let Griffin go was the worst day of they're lives. He was 15 years old and was suffering for kidney failure. He laid on the table, both Draco and Harry petting him and crying, purring away because he knew he was loved and that he'd see his friends again someday.
"holy shit." I whispered.
He felt strong arms pull him close to a tight chest. He moaned when he felt warm breath on his ear.
"Umm... I can hire a male?" Harry was intrigued.
"Well, we at least made some progress." Harry smiled. It felt so good to have Draco hold him after a long day.
A tear slid down Harry's cheek. He knew how my Draco loves Griffin and he knew that Draco must be a mess right now.
"I'm going to miss your purrs and your dances, my big boy." Draco cried as he kissed his furry little head.
"Good boy. You've earned a reward." Draco said as he undid his tie and slipped out of his suit jacket. he folded them and sat them on the chair, then undid just the first few buttons of his shirt, and rolled up his sleeves. He leaned down on the bed and got up close to Harry's ear. Harry was expecting to be touched, but instead Draco whispered, "But for teasing me I'm not going to touch you yet. First, I'm going to tie you down and use a few spells on you and you're not going to cum until I tell you to. If you do, you'll be punished some more."
"OH, HELL NO!" Harry and I said in unison. And we both laughed at our fantastic parenting.
Harry caressed Draco's face, "You make me the happiest man in the universe."
"Harry?" He heard Draco whisper from his shoulder.
"Can harry come?" Scorpius asked.
"So did you." Harry kissed Draco's head, as he reached for his wand and waved a quick cleaning spell. Then they both fell asleep in each other’s arms.
"Fuck." Harry whispered as he felt his pants grow a little tighter.
He shook his thoughts away and continued to look down the table. He noticed all the chair were filled except the one right next to him. Where was the new defense against the dark arts teacher? His stomach began to turn even more as he began to think about who it might be. There was only one wizard he could think of that he thought would be perfect for the job and he hoped McGonagall didn't think the same.
" okay." Draco said, "Can you lay next to me?"
"H-harry, it's ok. It's in the past. I forgave your years ago. If anything, you saved me." He pulled back and wiped some of the tears from my cheeks as he gazed into my eyes. "In more ways than one." There sincerity in his eyes calmed something in me and I fell back into his embrace.
"Surprise, I come with food!" Harry said, "How does tacos sound?"
"Well, I love you." I said as I ran a thumb over his jaw.
"D-did you mean what you said?" Draco couldn't take his eyes off the floor.
Harry reached between them and started to pump Draco in time with his thrust.
"Can I ask you something odd?" Harry asked as he stroked Draco's legs that were thrown over his lap.
"Mm good! how about you go take a shower? I'm going to go call into work and make us some breakfast."
"Master..." Draco interrupted him before he could finish his sentence.
"Harry you're going to make me cum!" Draco yelled.
"Well I work here, duh. Still a little slow, I see, Potter." Draco said but there was no malice in his voice like there used to be.
"Oh really? What are we doing in those dreams?" Draco asked flirtatiously.
"No, I took a few months off. This is more important to me and it's not like I can't afford it." I smirked but I know sadness still showed in my eyes.
"Whatever I'm going to bed!" Ginny shouted as she stormed to the room and slammed the door. Harry laid on the couch and grabbed the throw blanket. He didn't feel like dealing with Ginny. He was too tired and sore. He closed his eyes and fell asleep.
Harry almost dropped the table he was levitating. "I'm not going to listen to you complain tomorrow about how bad the couch felt." Harry chuckled and continued his work. Draco swung around on the couch and leaned on the back so he could watch. Something felt strange though. He started staring at Harry's incredibly sexy figure and he'd be lying if he said he'd never done that before, but this time felt different. He almost felt more desire, like a strange primal urge. He'd never wanted someone so bad. he watched as little beads of sweat dripped down Harry's forehead and neck then he noticed he was starting to sweat too.
"Fuck yes!" Draco said losing his cool again. "Move." He ordered.
"What are we going to do?" Draco sobbed.
"Daddy you're kissing Harry!?" A little gleeful voice interrupted.
"Scorpius this is my godson, Teddy. Teddy these are your cousins Draco and Scorpius." Harry said gesturing to Draco then Scorpius.
Harry's POV
"Please move, Harry!" Harry started thrusting in and out slowly and first but gradually picking up speed. Soon he was pounding Draco's sensitive spot, making him scream in pleasure.
"Well what would you like to eat? I'll get you anything you'd like." Draco nuzzled his face into Harry's hair and smiled at the sent.
"H-harry?"
"Is this death?" I asked myself. It's nothing like last time. It’s just darkness. I couldn't feel my body and I kind of like that. There was no pain just complete darkness. Suddenly there as a small pin prick of light, and I found myself afraid of it. I reached out anyways and touched it. It started to grow, and I could feel tingles and warmth cover me. I was now trying to run from it. I knew what it was. It was life.
"I hope those are your hand prints" Draco giggled. Harry just hummed in response, “You have two flour hand prints on your ass dear."  Draco laughed as harry went in a circle trying to see the mess on his butt. "I'll get it." Draco said brushing Harry’s arse off.
After they were both dressed, Draco took Harry out the back entrance and
"Oh, I’m sure you do." harry laughed.
"fuck." Harry moaned, "Are you sure you want this?"
"Shhhhh its nothing serious just a few lacerations they need to fix. There’s no permanent damage. Everything’s going to be ok. I'll be here when you get out." Harry soothed.
Draco glared at him as he reached back into his pocket and held down the button. The vibration intensified and didn't stop. Harry leaned forward and gripped the counter trying to suppress a moan.
We sat there for about two hours till a healer finally came out to speak with us. "He's finally stable, we've decided to keep him in a magically induce coma for a few days, just to be on the safe side."
"Well you're seeing me now." He giggled and wrapped his arms around my neck again.
"If you don't want to talk about it it’s okay, sweetheart." Harry said.
"Draco! Draco!" I yelled. "You have to get up! Please!"
Draco leaned back and gently pulled Harry's face towards him so he could whisper in his ear. "Touch me."
"I love you so much, Harry." Draco whisper against Harry's lips.
"You're awfully quiet now." Harry said. shaking Draco from his thoughts.
"What's wrong, my angel?" He looked surprised at my words.
"I follow Pansy on Instagram. She posted a couple things confirming it." Hermione shrugged.
"No this can't be!" He said out loud. The cat got up and began nudging his legs. He noticed he was wearing a collie with a tag so he picked the cat up and read it. "Griffin"
"Yes!" Harry exclaimed.
"You're such a flirt." Draco teased.
"With all my heart." Draco said looking deep into Harry's green eyes.
"Thank you. He's in room 202." Granger said then hung up the phone.
Harry blushed "Was it really that good?"
They both slid into a booth and ordered their drinks. "So, Dray," Draco beamed at that nick name, he only liked hearing it from Harry, "What did you do after the trials? That was the last time we saw each other, right?"
"you can cook?" He chuckled sniffling back the tears.
" I think three should do it." Draco said as he accioed a paddle.
"I promise." Harry said as he wiped away his tears.
Draco turned his head in refusal, but he was smacked hard. Miguel took his wand out and placed it to Draco’s neck "suck!!" He yelled as he pressed his dick to Draco’s mouth. Draco opened and began to suck reluctantly. Miguel began to fuck his face rough and hard. Going deep into his throat and making him gag. He soon pulled out and came all over Draco’s face.
Draco just nodded.
"You know I'm a healer, right?" Draco said through his tears.
"I'll take that." Harry smiled big; He was so happy to know Draco at least cared about him enough to have feelings. "Draco, love, can I kiss..." Before he could finish his sentence, Draco closed the space between them and gently crashed their lips together. It was a soft and sweet kiss. Draco's hand found its way into Harry's hair, as Harry cupped his face. His other hand slid around to the small of Draco's back pulling him closer.
I lead them in and offered them something to drink Ron and Hermione both politely decline Harry stayed completely salient.
"As long as I can remember I guess." Draco said. Harry noticed a slight blush on his cheeks. "Is the feeling mutual?" He looked and Harry with hope in his eyes.
"Come in." He froze for a minute at the sound of the voice that came from the room. It sounded so familiar. He slowly opened the door to reveal a large room with a beautiful four-post bed with velvet curtains, what he assumed was a bathroom to the left and a small sitting area in front of a mighty fireplace. Sitting in a high backed arm chair drinking a glass of what Harry assumed was fire-whiskey was a man dressed in a completely black suit with long platinum blond hair wearing a shear lace mask that hid his eyes.
"You want me to sleep with you again?" Harry was surprised.
"Draco?" He said quietly.
"Yes, love, where are you?" Harry yelled back.
"Thank you, so much, Harry." Draco smiled even bigger. They untangled themselves from Scorpius, letting him sleep, and did as Harry suggested.
"I love Red's! Their wine selection is amazing!"
He sat under the dim lamb light contemplating calling the number on the card. He finally gave in and dialed the number.
"He called you cute! I love things that are cute, like our cat Griffin! He's cute and I love him!" Scorpius was beaming.
Hermione's POV
"Granger?" I asked gently.
"Harry," he said as he carded his fingers through my hair, "They plan on hospitalize you." He said with a sigh. I shot up knowing exactly what he meant.
When they got back to Draco's flat Harry apparated back to his place and changed and grabbed his things for tomorrow just in case Draco wanted him to stay the night again. When he got back to Draco's flat Draco was still doing his hair.
"I agree." Draco rolled over and laid his head on Harry's chest. "You felt so good!"
"I love your cock so much, master. You feel so good!" Harry yelled. Draco grabbed him tightly and threw him to the mattress, fucking him hard.
Harry laughed and kissed his cheek, "literally right in front of you!"
"I don't care as long as I get to spend the day with you." Draco smiled.
Draco tells Harry what happened between him and Ommin, bringing them closer together.
"Holy fuck!" Draco whispered when Harry pulled away five minutes later.
Draco awoke with harry curled up in asleep in his arms. He was so happy in that moment, but then he remembered the tentacles. He looked under the covers and they were completely gone. Nothing there but his plain old cock. He gave a sigh of relief and a little bit of sadness. they felt great but he'd rather have his own dick.
"Demoted?" Harry's stomach dropped. He didn't understand what that meant but the way Miguel said it worried him.
"Everyone I tell doesn't believe me." Draco wept.
"How'd it go?" He asked.
"Mm you've gotten better." Draco tilted his head back and wrapped his fingers in Harry's hair. He started thrusting at a slow steady pace trying not to go too deep so he wouldn't make Harry gag. Soon pleasure took over though and his thrust got faster and deeper. Harry took all of it, drool running down his chin and tears pooling in his eyes.
"I'm looking for Miguel. Tell him Harry Potter is looking for him." Harry said over the loud music.
"Harry you don't have to say it back just because I said it. Please don't say it unless you mean it. Your silence right now won't hurt me, I promise. I'd rather you not say it if you don't mean it than have you lie to me to make me feel good." He smiled and brushed my cheek one last time.
Three weeks after the back to school dinner Draco was on his way to collect herbs from Professor Longbottom when he turned a corner and crashed into someone, making them land on top of him. He could feel how firm and strong the body was and instantly knew who it was. His eyes went wide and caught the gaze of the bright green ones that had been haunting him for days, "H-harry?" He whispered.
Draco had just got out of the shower when his phone buzzed.
"By far the best sleep I've ever got in my life!" Harry exclaimed. as he walked over and poured himself a cup of coffee. "You?"
"If you can't take it how will you take my cock?"  Harry whispered leaning across Draco's back. Draco sat up and stared at Harry as he slowly slipped out of his trousers and boxers revealing a massive 9-inch girthy cock.
"You may." Narcissa looked over at her husband without saying anything. Lucius gave an annoyed look to Harry then got up and left the room.
"Yes master." Harry started slowly bouncing up and down. He moaned loudly and clawed at Draco's chest. Draco bent his knees placing his feet to the mattress and started thrusting upward into Harry.
Harry's POV
Harry POV
"Good morning, love." Harry smiled.
"Of course, Harry. What is it?" Narcissa said sweetly. Lucius was still looking very stern.
"Shhhh, I have an idea." Harry said wiping Draco tears away again. "Let's put you to bed, then tomorrow after Teddy's in bed I'll come by and, since you told me your story, I'll tell you the story about a boy who lived in a cupboard. Maybe then you'll trust me more. Is that ok." Draco looked puzzled but nodded his head in agreement. Then he led Harry to his room. Harry cast a spell changing Draco’s clothes into pajamas, then tucked him into bed.
Harry's POV
"Malfoy?" Harry responded.
"Well he has multiple lacerations in his rectal cavity, one big enough we'll have to do surgery to repair. We'll also need to test him for HIV in a few months. Other than that, he'll be fine with no permanent damage. I'm worried about his mind though. I'm going to recommend a few mind healers for him to see. He'll also need the support of all his friends and loved ones." She replied.
"Who?" Hemione asked.
Ommin glared for a moment but then let his face relax. "We need to talk."
"Of course."
Being a male escort wasn't so bad. At Least he had a high price and only high-class people could afford him. Although he did get the occasional older person, he could usually tough it out. He mostly had ministry officials and celebrities. The type of people he was used to associating with. That’s why the underground company he worked for was happy to hire him.
"So, now you face your death. I wonder if you will be as brave as your mother…"
"Hidden away?" Draco's voice was steady and cold, his tears completely dried up. "You would have hidden him from me? He's my charge, my—"
It looked tempting, but Harry had his own breakfast regimen. First course would be a piece of toast and a few slices of bacon. Hedwig usually came with the mail early in the meal, and if he had any more than that on his plate, he'd have to tithe it over. Once she left, he could get more food. Maybe some of the melon, or the green grapes that gleamed wetly in the artificial sunlight of the enchanted ceiling.
Severus muttered something and Blaise's grip relaxed slightly, enough for Paige to pull her fingers free and try to shake some sensation back into them.
Paige felt Severus return to her side before she saw him. "It's a healthy baby boy," the man said. "If he has Zabini's brains and Weasley's mouth we're all done for."
"Yes, I plan to snuff out our dear Severus's life like a candle."
She convinced him to pose in front of a stone gargoyle, to 'take advantage of his dark and mysterious nature' she said. His hair was longer then, tied back into a queue at the back of his neck, and he was wearing his muggle uniform, black denims and a black sweater.
At another time, in another world, Severus might give in to the urge to comfort. But that was not his way, he was more bracing than that. He took a seat on the cot, absently noticing that Harry was just a bit taller than him now.
Phoebe made the introductions and Paige nodded at Harry when she heard her name.
For a moment, Draco was bemused, seeing the woman so fiercely angry with him.
Next was a suit like the depths of the night sky. Draco thought this would be safe because the description as so vague, but the king obtained the entirety of an indigo crop an had his staff work night and day to tint the cloth to match the night sky exactly. When the suit was presented to the prince he could have wept. It was perfect. In fact he did shed one tear that he told the king was due to joy and it glittered on the fabric like a star. There were six months to go.
Then Harry downed his glass as quickly as he could before refilling it and pouring the sparking liquor over Ron's head.
"I'm so proud of you," she said, moving over and wrapping her arms around Draco.
(See the end of the chapter for
Paige turned to what had Severus's attention and found herself face to face with something she very much didn't want to be so close to.
"Well, there's a bit of a lump, but there was no concussion, thank goodness. We're lucky whitelighters are a hardy breed, huh?"
"This is some of you guys magic, isn't it," she asked, miming a wand gesture in the air.
"Don't call me that, Shannon," Draco said from his seat on the couch, eyes still tracing the words of his letter from Harry. "I'm not a baby."
Draco looked confused and walked out of the house into the garden, sunlight shining off of loose and wavy platinum blond hair. "Harry, are you okay?"
Draco's urge to panic was quieted as Harry turned to him and smiled, seeming to notice his upset. Speaking quietly and in a soothing tone, Harry said, "I'm not sure where we can put you, Bearskin. Do you have any skills?"
"So what," Draco replied, yawning.
Harry nodded.
As the man reached towards Harry's face, Draco used his grip on the Gryffindor to tug him closer to his side. Glaring at the tattooed bastard behind the counter, he said, "You know what love, let's go somewhere else. I don't think I like this place." the last words were spat out with sharp venom.
Draco froze, not sure whether to run or stand his ground, but before he could make up his mind Harry was there in front of him, offering his hand.
The screaming continued and Ron's shouted encouragements warred with Blaise's hoarsely screamed profanity and Severus's instructions. Harry covered his face with his hands, thankful that he had switched to contact lenses in the early months of the war and he was now able to completely cover his face. He tried to hum quietly and block out the sounds of pain and panic, but they remained as present in his ears as the sight of the tortured Blaise did in his memory.
"You didn't?"
Harry just wanted to get out. He brushed away the hand that had never stopped rubbing his back and headed for the first door he saw, hoping there would be an escape on the other side.
Looking up with gentle laughter in his eyes, Harry said, "I have always been told stories of the wood elves that live in my forest. Are you one of those come to dance with me on my birthday?"
The older man shuddered lightly, his voice thin. "You could have died, Draco."
Draco bit his tongue on the resounding 'yes' that wanted to leap from his throat. Sarcasm would not be appreciated.
Paige heard arguing from the living room, and then Draco walked into the kitchen, still pale, grabbed several herbs and a small cauldron, and disappeared into the bathroom.
There was Lily, at sixteen and possibly the most beautiful thing he'd seen at that point. And she was smiling that same crooked smile that she saved just for him.
Draco paused. He didn't know what to do next, what was possible. He had his responsibility to his charges and to he Elders, and Harry had a war to fight.
Leaning over the sink, Draco splashed some water over his face and rubbed it with one of the hand towels that hung over a bar by the basin. He pulled it away, then gasped as he saw the rusty stains on the pale peach surface.
Draco was confused for a moment, then it came back to him. "You know?"
Then she linked her arm through his, careful not to jostle either of their drinks and half-led, half-dragged him over to the table.
"Isn't it wonderful, Professo- I mean, Severus," the girl giggled.
"We can take this. I like to drive when I'm just on regular errands, it makes me feel like a normal person for a change."
"Potter, I'll drink anything you put in front of me."
There was no evidence that the owner/manager of the club was involved and as Harry liked the man he hoped it remained so, but Ron was convinced that where there was smoke, there was fire.
"Okay kid. River. You need a break and I can give it to you." Alex smiled again, a loose goofy grin, and said, "After all, I was in the same position once myself."
Severus could have cried at the look in those eyes, Lily's eyes, but he bit it back. His emotions were nothing right now. Only Harry's mattered.
Paige heard her sister exclaiming over the baby and she held his breath as the tiny creature yawned and opened his eyes to reveal vivid blue eyes to match his still-blushing father's.
Draco was thrown away from Harry and the others, landing on one of the heavy benches that lined the long House tables. The study wood crumpled under the force of the collision. He was stunned, head spinning as the stones flew down around him and the air began to fill with a thick choking dust. Acting quickly he stood and moved to the wall, pressing himself into a niche in the stones to wait out the worst of the fall. He took the time to examine his condition. There were some minor bruises and cuts from the flying shards of stone and as he took a deep breath he felt the deep scrape of broken ribs inside his chest.
Spike nodded, then his face softened. "Take good care of him, yeah? He's had a hard couple of days."
"It's a bear, leave it be."
Biting her tongue, she said, "Does he have any friends?"
No matter that they had fought on the same side in the end, Draco and Weasley had become no closer, no friendlier. And that was fine with Draco. He pushed past the red head and headed for the doors.
"Apparently he's still tied to me. If I'm in danger he knows. According to Chris it's like an emergency button."
Harry followed the wavering voice out onto the balcony, to find the pale, shivering form of his love.
He heard a quiet creaking, and the door swung open. Severus saw Paige walk in, her eyes widening when she took in the scene, then softening as she nodded gently before she set some clothes on the chair in the corner of the room and left as silently as she had entered.
But that breath came and went, as did the one after that, and another, and so on until the sensation of almost dying became, as it must for anyone who felt it to go on with life, a distant and muted thing.
"I meant it, you lot. Shut it up."
As the green light fell on them Draco felt a horrible tearing sensation in his back. He screamed out in pain.
Paige smiled, "Thanks Mom, but I'm good."
"Tell us what you're doing here."
He was broken out of his thoughts by the sound of Harry clearing his throat.
"I'm sorry Draco. I just don't appreciate everything you do for me," Harry said softly.
And then he stole the frosting.
The blond had moved off of Paige and was now sniffling heavily, his eyes on the ground and his shoulders hunched.
Paige grinned, "So what, you couldn't buy plants, big deal. I really lost out. They were amazing with silk. I haven't been able to find anyone as good."
Draco smiled, looking relieved, and held out the plate. "I'm glad to hear that. Now eat something. Your stomach was growling so loudly I thought you had an animal down there."
Harry felt a cold chill run down his back and he shivered reflexively.
Without turning around Piper replied, "Wart remover."
Harry cast a mild Glamour over himself. Voldemort had finally given up on wanting a personal confrontation a few weeks previous and issued a 'kill on sight' order. Taking off from a hidden door in the castle he moved towards the thick brush that edged the battlefield. There was some open space between the castle and the cover of the bushes, so he ran.
Beside him, from the corner of his eye, he could just barely see Harry flushing.
Harry saw a cloud of blue light from the corner of his eye, but ignored it as he raised his own wand.
Harry turned in Draco's grip and pressed a soft kiss against the Slytherin's cheek, saying, "I like this place, baby." The Gryffindor leaned closer and whispered, "Ignore him. Red heads aren't my type, remember?"
"I'm not trying to. Is that what you want? Do you want me to tell you fairy stories? Once upon a time there was a boy named Harry Potter, who fell in love with his Guardian Angel. Against all logic, his angel loved him back, and the two of them lived happily ever after. The end."
With a light blush, his hands still caressing the mound of his stomach, the boy replied, "Blaise Zabini."
Harry POV
Lucius turned o the door and saw Severus Snape, one of his most trusted advisors, standing there.
In one picture a young and rather awkward looking Lucius Malfoy stood with all the dignity a fourteen year old can maintain in front of the Whomping Willow, though well out of reach of the writhing tentacles.
"-precious castle and everyone inside."
Unfortunately the person on the other side of the door was a very agitated Hermione Granger, who had never found him very scary in the first place.
Together she and her sisters herded the boy into the empty kitchen chair in the corner. There was no escape now.
Watching the otherwise easy-going cook slowly unravel, Draco did the one thing he had been avoiding.
The last time she saw them they were both asleep on the living room couches, Severus looking worn to the bone and faintly green, and Draco still with traces of his own blood dried onto his face that a damp washcloth couldn't quite get rid of.
"Free, Severus? And why should my son be free of me?"
Closing his eyes as he rested his head on his folded arms, Harry didn't notice the Hall getting quieter, until it was completely silent.
"Together," Severus asked and Paige nodded. "Well I suppose it was inevitable. Those two have always had a complicated relationship."
The oldest Charmed One looked up at Paige and smiled slightly, "Fine and dandy, except for being attacked by demons and Draco having another seizure after I blasted them."
Slowly moving past the battle, Harry jumped back when a Death Eater came crashing through the shrubbery to collapse at his feet. The man's mask had split down the middle, and as he fell it dropped to the ground, exposing a young and unfamiliar face. The man was pale, his skin visibly grey in the dim spell-light cast over the field. As Harry watched the man groaned and curled around his left arm. Harry looked away from the man and off into the corner where the weapon was hidden, seeing a blue glow flare around the small tent.
The last was said in a whisper. Draco remembered now, those first few quiet moments where he could observe Harry and refix the image of him in his head, then when he woke up and they were Harry and Draco, friends and maybe more, before everything fell apart, again.
"So Draco," she said, holding up the bag of doughy delights, "want a bagel?"
"Right, Seamus."
Both men winced at the sharp, "Spike!" that echoed down the stairs. Even Wyatt wrinkled his tiny brow at his mother's voice.
"You have to come, Professor. It's Harry!"
He wasn't conventionally pretty like most of the other men she had dated. His nose was too large, and his skin too weathered. But there was power in his dark eyes, and a sense of strength in the soft flesh of his mouth…
Harry heard the other man curse before he was knocked to the ground again.
The two friends moved the Slytherin boy towards their camp as quickly as they could. An emergency portkey had been created linking them to the Hogwarts infirmary, and the staff there might be the only ones capable of figuring out what had happened.
Before him stood the three high Elders, forbidding expressions on their faces. Just behind them stood Shannon, looking apologetic and sorrowful, and just beyond them stood the forces of Hogwarts.
"Welcome, Mr. Potter."
"It looks like it," Piper said, offering Chris a towel.
"Do we have to go over this every time? I," Chris pointed to himself, "am from the future. You," now he pointed to Spike, "are a vampire, and therefore still alive on the future when many other people are not. You, surprisingly enough, are working for the side of good, as long as it serves your interests."
Draco looked at his hands, now folded tidily in his lap, "I'm afraid I can't do much about that, Leo. This is the age I died at."
The man was flushed and panting, but the cause was not passion as he was gripping his forearm, his body wrapped fetally around the source of the pain that tinged his already pale face a sickly grey.
Turning to the woman who had been by his side since the day he was born, Draco said, "Are you sure you want to do this, Pomphrey? He will kill you."
"You weren't complaining last week when that L'Or'Eal demon shot goo in your hair," Phoebe countered, grinning broadly.
Blaise smiled. "No, he'll have his godfathers to take care of him. Uncle Draco will protect his little Jamie from all of the emotional scars his two horny fathers inflict on him, won't he," Blaise asked, grinning wickedly at Draco. "Ah," he went on, "But who will protect poor Jamie from being emotionally scarred by his two horny godfathe-"
When both boys pulled away Harry saw that Draco's eyes were hazy and his cheeks bright pink, and he assumed he looked the same. Suddenly shy, Harry stepped away, rubbing the back of his neck as his eyes trailed around the moonlit garden.
"I know it has. Chris-" Draco had to stop, a sob caught in his throat.
Draco cut the other boy off before he could break into song. "I'm fifteen, Blaise."
Draco's laughter faded into harsh breaths that Harry felt against his skin and they stood there in silence faces only inches from one another.
Resolved, he went to the pumphouse and changed. He took extra pains to be more beautiful as he dressed in his suit that rivaled the stars in the skies. His hair flowed like pure water down his back, and the silver light of his clothes was rivaled by the shine of his eyes.
Unsure whether to take his lucky break and run, Draco stood frozen in the hallway.
The blond broke into harsh sobs and Severus watched as Paige got down off of the couch and sat next Draco, wrapping her arms around him and half pulling him into her lap to cry against her chest.
He sighed, "Look, what do you expect, for me to run off and find him and declare my eternal love? Or even better, the enduring fidelity of my genitalia?"
Still, they hadn't much choice. Their target was The Fabulous Ladies Night Club, in some godforsaken hole in California . It was a known information gathering place, open to elements from both the magical and demon world.
Chris jumped in. "It's actually interesting. The weapon has the power to amplify a witch or wizards power by draining it off of others."
The king shook his head sorrowfully, but Draco could still see that shine in his eyes. Slowly the king gestured to his guards and a metallic ring filled the room as the swords were pulled free.
Paige led Blaise to the table and settled him in a chair, orbing a small bottle of apple juice from the fridge and offering it to the boy.
"I want to help, to fight. Let me fight."
Turning he saw Paige standing in the hallway.
Bright orange sunset was streaming through the kitchen inches from his feet and Paige could see pale twists of smoke rise off of the vampire's boots, but he didn't back away.
Together, Paige and Phoebe carried Draco to the living room couch, laying him on top of some heavy towels as a precautionary measure, though the bleeding had stopped. Piper settled Wyatt in his room, then came back downstairs and the sisters sat vigil in the living room.
"A vampire, Chris? You brought that evil thing into our house? My house? Your brother is here, and he is a baby. Do you care at all? I can't believe you were so irresponsible!"
Whitelighters are a form of angel. People who died doing heroic acts or who lived in a heroic fashion were called into service protecting young witches. They are largely impervious to injury but can be poisoned by the arrows of a Darklighter, their evil counterpart.
"Goodness, Malfoy looks like hell."
Phoebe snorted, then winced, pressing a hand to the back of her head. "What did they look like to you?"
Draco heard Severus gasp in shock. After an endless moment of silence, he man spoke. "What you intend to do is wrong, Your Majesty. Your son will not wish it, and your wife would not wish it. To do this will dishonor your family, and disgrace her memory."
"…Blaise?"
The vampire curled up around his bits and crumpled to the floor, cursing faintly.
"Oh, yes. It is definitely time," Severus said. " I'm going to need some clean towels, and possibly a blanket."
They shaped the words carefully, with a delicate precision, "So, I'm gay. And you danced on a pole."
"What got him into such a strop anyway," Blaise asked, but a glare from Severus sent the other boy scurrying out in Draco's wake.
A pink blush rose on the boy's cheeks as he nodded. "I- yeah, I do. But it doesn't really matter does it?"
A high pitched ringing surrounded the men. It pressed against the back of Severus' ears and he knew he would have a head ache later. Spike, with his more sensitive hearing, had his hands pressed to the side of his head and his shoulders hunched as though that would keep the noise out. Chris seemed unaffected by the noise, but Severus assumed that was either a whitelighter trait or a teenager one.
With a few dull thumps, Spike enticed the last man standing to trip over his fellow dark wizards and he knocked himself unconscious on the stone floor of the cave. Brushing his hands together though they didn't get dirty in the fight, Spike sauntered over to Severus and Chris.
Draco finished chewing the tidbit he had chosen before swallowing and saying. "How did what go?"
"For your safety and theirs, you have to stay here. Would you like to be responsible for Harry's death?"
Draco shook his head again. After the events of those two days, when the baby was born and he and Harry had- done what they had, his head was a muddle of thoughts and events and feelings.
Paige ran to the chair in the corner of the room and pulled some crystals from her bag. She set them around Severus and muttered an incantation that Harry couldn't quite make out and a sparkling net of light sprang into being around the man.
Paige wasn't surprised, Phoebe was turning green as she watched Blaise panting and grimacing.
An emergency kit had been arranged on the tables. It contained four vials of different banishing potions, some grounding crystals if they needed to keep a demon or sorcerer alive for questioning, and herbs for protection or healing. All of this was packed into a daffodil yellow basket and Paige stayed in the attic only long enough to grab it before streaming back down to the living room.
The battlefield was a fog of curses and robe-clad bodies. Draco could see something that looked like a tent at the far end of the fight, but he knew there was no way he would be able to reach trying to go through the masses.
"Well, what about the time you forced me to visit every opticians office in Muggle London, looking for the perfect pair of Buddy Holly frames, despite the fact that I thought they would look terrible on you?"
He hadn't really meant it.
As he disappeared in a shower of blue sparks, Harry could swear he heard Draco say, "I wish I could stay," but he couldn't be sure over the sound of his heart breaking.
Harry stood up and walked over, offering a finger for the infant to grab. "Wow. Sorry I had to leave, but you know how I am."
"You have a plan."
"It's for your own good, Draco. People are hard enough on you already. What would happen if they knew about us? They would think you had bespelled me, or blackmailed me, or something like that, and they would never leave us- you alone."
After some arguing among the extended family, it was decided that Ron would stay in California with Blaise and Piper. Chris had his responsibilities to Piper and Wyatt, and Phoebe had to stay behind to fulfill the duties of the Charmed Ones so Paige was the only one that would be accompanying Draco to Scotland.
As the hit the floor, Harry caught sight of something just past where the man had been standing, a large metallic contraption, and crouching near it was a shadowy figure. But Harry thought he saw, the light caught on pale blond hair.
Ron nodded, grinning. "Me and Blaise have been talking about it for months. Figured it only made sense to name the kid after our best friends. James Narcissus if it was a boy, and Jean Parker if it was a girl."
Harry sat with Severus for a while, grilling him on events with Hogwarts and Blaise, and Draco, and in turn Harry was interrogated on the progress of his mission. At one point Alex popped his head in the door and winked at Severus before nodding at Harry and walking back out again.
"You're going to see Draco, aren't you?"
The red head walked into the room and lifted James from Blaise's arms, returning the baby to his cradle before slipping into the bed next to his love. The two leaned into each other and Draco felt a pang at Harry's absence at the same time he was relieved by Ron's distracting Blaise.
Taking a deep breath, Paige started.
Severus flinched at the cold tone in Harry's voice. The boy was broken, completely broken. Perhaps there was no way to get him back now.
Pomphrey smiled, but Draco could see the sorrow that traced her lips. "Yes, I may live. The king has been merciful in the past." Embracing the prince, she said, "We will meet again." She released him. "Now go. There is no time to waste. Run, and hide, and be free and joyous in the world."
So he was completely surprised when a gentle hand lifted his chin and he found himself face to face with Harry Potter.
They stood there for a moment, frozen, until Paige felt Draco take a shuddering breath. Looking up, but still holding on to her, Draco said, "I made him cry, Paige. I didn't mean to make him cry." Tears shone in the pale grey eyes and slowly spilled over his dark lashes. Paige guided his head back to her shoulder, and then looked at Severus, mouthing, 'Go see about Harry.'
"You… You talk to him?" Harry's voice was low and weak. It felt like those first few hours after his return all over again.
His tone was dry, almost scathing, but Harry saw a sparkle deep in the black eyes.
Draco's smirk became a grin as he said, "There are no chairs out here."
Paige wasn't sure what to say, not knowing what the green eyed boy heard that made him leave without a word, so she just shook her head. "He just gave me this bag and left."
He felt a sharp elbow thrust into his side and sat up, startled, to shout at Ron who had been sitting to his left at the time. But when he turned he saw that his friend had been replaced by the softly smirking Draco Malfoy.
Harry found himself alone in the kitchen with the woman, but not for long as the red headed woman and the other brunette walked into the room.
Mentally Severus reminded himself to return Paige's camera when they got back to the house. And that brought back thoughts of the breakfast table, and how soft her skin felt under his stained and calloused fingertips.
He dressed carefully for the meeting in Muggle jeans and an aubergine sweater Draco had given him and made his way to the Potion's Master's quarters by 2:45.
Still, Harry couldn't help himself, "I'm surprised Snape didn't give him a hangover potion. I mean, Malfoy is his favorite?" His voice trailed off as the surprised and disappointed glares of his friends centered on him. He sighed in relief when shouting broke out at the Slytherin table, distracting them, and everyone else from him.
"It's not over, is it," Harry asked in a low voice and Severus shook his head.
Severus felt his back tighten. It was Alex's voice and sure enough the brunet was behind him, about two inches too close for any comfort and moving closer every second.
Draco nodded, wiping the tears roughly from his cheeks and rising to his feet with Hagid's help. Once he regained his footing he bowed to Harry, then again to Severus.
I saw it on television a few months ago, a special on ghosts, and I thought, "Damn, this would make a great angst story."
Draco considered Harry his friend, and admired the Gryffindor prince's ability to make even the lowest scullery maid feel like an equal, and he wanted to honor the only person he considered a friend, so as the plates of soup were being prepared for the table, Draco dropped the tiny golden spinning wheel he had received into the bowl.
Harry walked closer until he was standing over Draco.
Severus' breath caught in his throat, with those words he had shocked himself into silence, "Oh Draco, you were dead and I never knew, never noticed something was wrong. For three years, you didn't change, and I was buried too deep in a cauldron to see."
"James?"
Harry stepped back and tried to get his bearings, "You're drunk. One drink, well one bottle and you're drunk."
"Severus? Are you in here?"
She did and soon the sound of shimmering bells heralded her entrance.
"I don't know, Blondie Bear. I think it's cute."
Draco opened his mouth to speak, then stood frozen before his eyelids drooped and he leaned in.
Panting, Harry leaned his forehead against Draco's.
Draco had come back, after he said he couldn't.
And so he took to his second life, openly working for the forces of the Order and becoming an initially unwilling den mother of sorts for some of his students, past and present.
Harry walked around the couch and settled on the floor, leaning back against warm legs. Closing his eyes, he answered, "I had to wait for Seamus to leave."
Paige snorted, "I'm not sure your angelic ass is covered Chris, so you might want to watch the attitude. So, he's a vampire, but non-dangerous, he can bunk in the cellar. Chris, show him the camp bed."
The blond boy seemed to be drifting in and out of consciousness. Harry gathered him up in his arms, jostling him gently to keep him awake.
Paige heard a moan and waved over her shoulder. "You okay, Sev?"
Pulling one hand away from where they were clasped around his knees, Draco checked his watch again. it was almost a quarter past three, and though Draco's body felt exhausted, his mind was spinning.
They were quickly wrapped in an aura of blue light and the battlefield around them disappeared.
Paige set Wyatt to the playpen in the corner before taking a seat next to the boy, settling gently so she wouldn't jostle him.
"Harry wait, maybe they're…"
His heart stuttered in his chest and Severs staggered to the old velvet couch.
He was definitely gay for Potter.
The were moved forward slowly, his hips shifting gently in the few steps worth of space they had before he was in front of Severus, the wand tip pressed firmly into the tan flesh of his stomach. Meeting Severus's eyes with his one, the man grinned brightly and said over his shoulder to Spike, "I didn't know you were into group scenes, honey. You should have said something."
He wandered around the attic for a while, studying the dusty remnants of other people's lives and speculating on what the Charmed Ones and their family must have been like. Anything to keep a specific image out of his mind.
After a few seconds, as she felt the level of tension in the room rising, she began to revise her opinion. Both men looked at her, Draco cross and Severus scathing, but that was their default setting for the morning anyway so she didn't think too much of it. Tossing her emergency pouch lightly from hand to hand, she turned to Blaise, "Where's the emergency?"
"Stands to reason, love. An empathic whitelighter with a crush on his charge is probably guaranteed to have this reaction. So, if Potter is alive and well, then Dragon should be on the mend as well."
"I expected better from the Boy Who Lived. Didn't they teach you anything at that fancy school of yours?"
Longbottom nodded. "I know, but I can't stop myself. You're still scary, Professor Sna- Severus."
"I'm your boss. Nothing more, nothing less," the man said. Then he started to laugh, and the laughter had a mad edge that Harry had never noticed before.
Chris rubbed a hand over his, admittedly pretty, face. Looking close, Paige could see the thick lines of exhaustion traced under her nephew's hazel eyes.
"Hello? Is anyone there?"
It was harder than he thought.
"Isn't that better," Harry asked, a laughing smile on his face.
"Welcome back, darling," Shannon said, jumping off the desk and glomping Draco.
The vampire grinned up at him, and pushed ahead until they found themselves in front of a large door. Severus watched Spike wave at it and with a shudder the door opened.
After Spike and the others left Draco started convulsions that only stopped when the last traces of orb energy were gone from the room. One experimental spell from Piper left the young whitelighter writhing in agony on the kitchen floor, so the Charmed Ones decided to stop any and all magic until they could figure out what was happening.
Severus didn't want to push, but as the days were turning into a week he felt he had to do something to get Harry to snap out of it. Emotional turmoil or no, there was war on and it wouldn't wait for angsty crises.
"I thought you couldn't bite anyone, Spike," Chris said.
"I told her I didn't want a lifetime with Harry. Oh Merlin. I told her that, but I didn't mean it. I was… she asked me and I didn't think I could have it. I told her not to give me hope, to let me think I could have it, have him. I want a lifetime. I want forever."
His friend grinned crookedly at him. "Harry, it's the only way. You know that. Come on, even Neville is participating." The red head waved at their friend and the boy waved hesitantly back from his position in the DJ booth.
Paige stood up and walked to the attic door. As Severus stood to follow she turned and said, "Still are," before blushing and walking out of the room.
This wasn't a new situation; in fact it had become depressingly common over the past few years. So instead of reacting with panic he took a few deep breaths to keep the edge of the pain at bay and took stock of his condition.
"Yeah. In a blue light."
But now Severus was unconscious. He had obtained severe chemical burns externally, and internally from the smoke; with the delay in his healing, Chris and Paige weren't sure there would be anything they could do. But every time Paige looked away from the man, she saw Draco's grey eyes staring between her, her hands, and his godfather, the only family he had left according to Blaise.
The first time she'd done it, she'd made an idle remark about 'keeping him in his place.' When he suggested jokingly that she just use the cruciatus as his father had done, her brown eyes filled to the brim with tears and she'd hugged him harder, so hard he thought he'd be absorbed into her.
Draco opened his mouth to answer, then bit his tongue as Harry said, "This is Bearskin, Hagrid. We're going to give him a job and a place to live."
"They're wings, baby boy," she said, her eyes sad and tired.
Severus hated to hear it, but maybe this meant he could fix the problem this time.
Draco shook his head, feeling his hair come loose from its weak hold at the back of his head and fall across his cheeks. "If you know the whole story then you know I died at fifteen. I only look this way because it was necessary for the job. I am fifteen, and that's how I will remain."
Again Severus looked to Paige for help, but she just held up her hands. "Sorry Severus, nothing I can do here. She's a force of nature."
As he spoke Draco saw a fiery blush rise on Harry's face, "Merlin, love. That is hot. You have to see it"
Head down, Draco didn't see the sad look that passed between Leo and Shannon, but he could sense it and it irritated him. He knew he was dead, technically everyone in the room was dead, but there was no call to make an opera out of it.
"Harry?"
"What is it," she asked.
Severus was shifting slightly, Paige moved to adjust the blanket that had drifted down his chest, and a cold hand gripped her wrist in a steely hold.
"So, it went well?"
The man laughed, releasing the younger man's hand and leading him to a small table by the bar. "Sure you're happy to be here. Come on, kid. You're as nervous as a long-tailed cat in a room full of hedge clippers."
Harry gulped thickly, "So what can we do? I mean, if he was bitten."
She watched Harry pale, but he swallowed hard and opened his mouth to introduce himself. Before he got a word out Phoebe cut him off.
"Those kids, Draco and Harry and the others. They're your family, your children."
Harry moved slowly away from the wall. The note of resignation in the man's voice sounded very familiar and Harry wondered for a moment if that's how he would sound in ten years.
The vampire nodded. "Not only is nephew upset, but Potter is making it worse unintentionally. If we keep them together with Harry as angry as he is we could be dealing with a lot of trouble."
Draco shook his head. "No, doesn't matter. We have to fight." he stood, but just as quickly fell again.
When the food was gone, Severus gazed at Draco in silence, waiting. After a few moments, the boy began to squirm, cheeks pinking. Eventually, the young whitelighter broke. "I got upset. They were yelling, and I didn't do anything, it was Spike, and I couldn't handle it and I left."
Releasing the vampire, Xander walked closer to Paige and Draco, a small grin at the corners of his mouth, but his eye shining with sincerity as he offered a hand to shake.
Ron found them there a few hours later, with a team of Aurors, just in case that 'bloody Malfoy' had done something. The medi-witch in the troop took over with the former Slytherin, but it was no good.
"Me too."
"You don't mean to say you… and Mr. Malfoy," Snape questioned, feeling distinctly uncomfortable. This was information he never wanted to know about his godson.
Draco dabbed at his mouth with a linen napkin before looking at the bushy-haired brunette. "I hardly think that's any of your business, Granger."
Still, that, like everything else, reminded Harry of Draco. It had been two months since the blond Slytherin disappeared. Harry knew Snape had searched earth and ether, but apparently white lighters were protected, or shielded, or something, and the boy was impossible to find.
Harry, rose from his chair and rushed from the hall, ignoring his friends calls.
Draco smiled. "Entertain you how? I don't dance and I refuse to sing. Little Jamie could never stand it," he said, looking over to the bassinet that had been placed next to the bed.
Thinking quickly, Draco threw himself in front of his uncle. "My Lord! Please, for me do not do this. Severus has been my friend and teacher and I would not see him dead."
Blaise gave him a look Draco had grown to quite dislike over the last few months of their cohabitation of the Halliwell Manor. It was a mixture of laughter and confusion, as if the brunet couldn't fathom Draco's behavior, but did find it quite amusing. It was a very smug look, and Draco didn't care for it at all.
The next day the kitchens were full of stories about the mysterious blond who had danced with the prince but Draco didn't hear any of them, too caught in his own daydreams and the rhythm of the turning spit.
"And I'm going to use the magical core of your favorite spy to do it."
"You have to help me, Harry."
When she left, closing the door behind her, Severus looked at Draco again, "What happened?"
There was one final scream, then the room went silent. Several agonized seconds later the room was filled with the lusty wails of a baby, echoed by teary laughter from more than one of the adults.
The tension of the moment was broken as Draco heard the tinkling of tiny bells and a stream of blue light appeared in the hallway
The brewing of potions was a delicate, time consuming process best done in complete solitude.
Harry and Draco walked over to Ron and Severus strained his ears to hear the conversation but they were drowning out by Phoebe and Paige's squealing. After they were done speaking the three young men embraced and Ron turned to the room again.
"So do you want a lifetime with Harry or not," a woman asked. It didn't sound like one of the sisters, but Harry was more focused on Draco's response than who else was in the room.
"Draco, my love, this is your new assignment." She waved to the man to stand, and
Draco maneuvered Harry so he was standing facing the counter and the binder with his back pressed tightly against the Gryffindor's front. He held Harry's arms wrapped tightly around his stomach as he flipped through he binder of piercing and tattoo photos.
"Harry James Potter! Where have you been?"
"I won't ask how it happened, but I'm glad you recovered from your unfortunate 'juicing.'"
The mumbled profanity drew Paige out of her thoughts.
Paige snorted, hard and Draco glared at her before returning to his letter, now slightly crumpled.
I hope the folks reading this story are enjoying it. I have, I believe, 40 chapters total. It's maybe 1 or 2 chapters shy of finished so fingers crossed by the time I get there I will have thise written
He didn't see the boy so at the first opportunity he asked Piper where the blond was.
He dropped his outer robe on the desk and made his way to his chair, an idle wave sending sparks into the fireplace.
Draco and Severus looked at each other, and then at Blaise, who colored and stuffed half a slice of heavily buttered toast in his mouth. From the corner of her eye Paige saw Severus shudder at the display, but all three of them waited in silence until the brunet was done eating.
The green eyed boy had a photo and a crumpled piece of parchment in his hand, but all Draco really noticed were those lips, so close to his.
Draco, unable to help himself, laughed. Heads turned at the sound but he only had eyes for the man in front of him. "My Lord, your birthday is not for two more days. Tonight is merely a precursor for the main event."
The boy turned away again, returning his gaze to the wall. "No. I heard him- heard him talking to someone. I was so happy Severus."
Severus heard stories about the green eyed boy's temper from Hermione and Ginny and others when they came to pick up potions or order more, but it wasn't until after a raid that went badly that he saw it for himself.
Ron's grin turned sheepish as he said, "Well, didn't figure 'Pansy' were really fair to the kid, so this was the closest we could agree on."
She represented hope to him. When his family was dark and falling apart Lily was there as a symbol that someone on Earth could look at him and smile, could care about him at his worst.
