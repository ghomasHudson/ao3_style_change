"But I mean it." Draco said, squeezing Harry's hand, voice low. "I'm sorry I tried to tell you that you shouldn't feel like this."
"It's beautiful Pansy, thank you." Hermione said. Pansy blushed slightly and squeezed Blaise's hand before the two of them made their way over to Draco.
"And your pessimism is cute." Harry said, kissing his cheek. "We're hanging out with our friends and that's final."
"Harry please, what brought this on." Hermione said. Harry wasn't even ashamed anymore. He didn't think he ever really was ashamed of Draco. Harry took a deep breath took a step back so he look both of them in eye and said,
"I'll think about it." Harry said with a laugh. The Headmistress nodded and turned to leave. "Umm.. McGonagall?" Harry asked. She glanced back at him. "Earlier, when I was in the corridor... Did someone run past you. I thought I saw...." Harry stopped, feeling stupid.
"You could tell him to fuck the absolute hell off." Ron said. Harry said nothing. Ron's mood had been... Sour ever since the party. Nobody really knew how to help or what to say. No matter what they did, everything seemed to set Ron off.
Harry was wandering the halls of Hogwarts without his invisibility cloak. He wasn't sure why exactly. He could still fit under it fairly well with sometimes only the tops or sides of his shoes showing and it's not like he didn't forget to grab it as he walked out of his room in nothing but pajamas and his Gryffindor robe. Harry just honestly didn't see the point in trying to hide from the Professors who might be roaming the halls looking for kids up past curfew. What was the worst the professors could do anyways? The worst thing Harry had experienced so far was death. Detention was nothing.
"Maybe later idiot. Right now I think we should head down to the Great Hall. They should be serving dinner soon." Harry glanced out the window of the tower to see how low the sun had set. He hadn't even noticed.
"Who says we don't?" Ron produced  a flask from his pocket. "I have a bottle stashed here in the room but I didn't want to show you because you drink that stuff faster than a catholic drinks wine at church." Harry snorted.
. All you have to do is say those words loudly in your head. Almost as if you're speaking them out loud. Your inner voice is just as commanding as your actual voice. Your wand should recognize this." Draco said.
"Hestia. It's a pretty name." Draco nodded and as Blaise walked away, Pansy fell into the couch in a slump. It was very un-Pansy like and Draco would have asked her what was wrong but her posture told him to shove it. So Draco said nothing.
"Anything for you ex-boyfriend." Ginny said. Harry chuckled and slowly, the conversation drifted away from Harry and how unbelievably smiley he was at the moment. Harry slowly raised his head and looked out across to the Slytherin table. He locked eyes with Draco who looked like he had seen and heard everything by the smirk on his face. Harry almost waved but then decided that might look stupid. He settled for smiling instead and across the hall, Draco's heart skipped a beat.
WHOEVER PUT TOGETHER DEATHLY HALLOWS PT 2 AND DECIDED TO CUT THAT SCENE WHERE DRACO RUNS BACK ACROSS THE COURTYARD SHOUTING "POTTER" NEEDS TO FUCKING SQUARE UP.  HOW DARE THEY. HOW DARE. DRACO DESERVED EVEN THIS TINY BIT OF REDEMPTION. HE DESERVED THE WORLD. ANYONE WHO DOESN'T THINK SO CAN FIGHT ME.
Harry had three classes with Draco. He didn't even have that many with Ron or Hermione but then again, this was Draco. Wherever Harry went, he could feel Draco's looming presence. Except... His presence wasn't very looming anymore. Draco was like a ghost.
"No." Harry interrupted. "I've known this for a while because Ron and I actually thought about pulling a prank on you that involved raspberry jam and a laxative in Year five." Harry said.
"Well tell her I said hi and, thank you. I'm really glad she didn't give me up. It's because of her that we were able to stop Voldemort."
"I'll tell him. He probably won't say anything though." Harry said, stealing a glance across the dining hall. Draco was pushing his food around on his plate as Blaise and Pansy talked around him. Harry pursed his lips, wondering if he should abide by Draco's warning to not go to the tower tonight. Harry wasn't sure why but... Every time he talked to Draco he got this weird rush of adrenaline. It was that same rush he used to get when they would fight but somehow... This felt different. In a good way.
"I don't complain." He said, smoke wafting around the two of them. "I just..." Harry and Draco had almost forgotten that Ron was there with them.
"Well, this was a nice chat. Now leave me alone." Draco said, turning away from Harry and walking to the other end of the room where an assortment of boxes sat.
"Yeah, I know. Bye Draco." Draco half raised his hand in a goodbye gesture, not bothering to turn around. When he heard the tower door close, he exhaled quickly, the tension in his shoulders dropping. He hadn't realized he had been holding his breath. And as Harry headed down the stairs, he tried to figure out why exactly his heart was racing in his chest. It used to be because Draco was a big anxiety to him but Harry had gotten over that feeling. This must have been something else. Shaking his head, Harry chalked it up to the excitement of learning a new spell.
Draco climbed the stairs two at a time, a million and a half things on his mind like how was he supposed to look at Harry without feeling the urge to... I mean could he really just.... What would Harry even think about... God he felt so stupid. All of this was so stupid. It's not like they could ever be together in some shape or form. His parents would definitely not a approve and if Harry's parents were alive... They'd probably curse Draco into the next century and be done with it. But Draco didn't really care. I mean, he kind of did but at the same time...
." Ginny said with complete revulsion in her voice. Harry laughed. He knew his friends were just surprised and being slightly over dramatic. This would all pass.
"All I'm saying is, I want to make sure that whoever this girl is, they have Harry's best intentions and they're not dating him simply because he was the Chosen One." Ginny said with a nod of her head. Harry sighed.
"Umm... Yeah, I guess." Draco said. He had to change out of his uniform and into his pajamas anyways. Draco slowly unbuttoned his shirt and Harry came and undid the rest of the buttons for him, slowly peeling the fabric off of Draco's shoulders. Harry could see the small, faint scars doting his skin. He touched one by Draco's collarbone lightly.
"Really? Could've sworn I heard a hollow knocking sound when you did that." Laughter bubbled out of Harry and Draco found himself smiling as he watched him laugh in the middle of the Forbidden Forest.
before I could stop him and then Blaise and I watched him fall." It was so quiet. There didn't even seem to be the whistle of a breeze through the tower. "I thought I would die. I had almost accepted it before I heard Blaise shout something at me and there you fucking were with your bloody heroes complex."
"Because this is impossible!" Draco finally snapped at Harry. "Me? You like kissing me? You want to form some sort of bloody deeper relationship with me of all people?" Draco shouted, throwing his arms in the air. Harry set his jaw.
Harry was leaning up against a wall, staring out the open window of the tower when Draco walked in. Draco half laughed. "Well isn't this a sight to see. Harry Potter, actually thinking for once. " Draco said. Harry didn't look over at him which made Draco a little nervous.
"You were edging each other on." Hermione said gently. "Pansy's a nasty piece of work but so were you that night. You basically... It was like you were accusing them of...
"Come on Potter just tell us who she is. We're not going to badger her or anything." Dean said. Harry half rolled his eyes. That was a load of shit. They most certainly would bug anyone Harry was dating.
"How could I forget?" Harry said, jumping off the log and landing right in front of Draco, leaving hardly any room between them. "You ran off you bastard."
. Sorry I wasn't in the right head space." Ron and Hermione paused, surprised that Draco had so openly admitted that he loves Harry. They raced down the hill after him again and didn't ask anymore questions as their once hated enemy led them into the Forbidden Forest.
"Can we not?" Ron demanded. "What's with you all and being so crass?" Ron said. Ginny pried her brothers hands away from her mouth.
"Yeah well Harry can fuck off for all I care. I'm not going to apologize for hating Malfoy or any of them." Ron said.
"We just... Draco we've looked everywhere for him. It's been two days and we're worried. Is there anywhere you can think of that he would be? Places you would meet?"
"Yeah well... I feel like my hands are always shaking now." Harry said, closing his hands into fists over and over to try to steady himself. The blueberry flavored cigarette rolled around in his palm.
"Weasley is always looking for a fight these days." Draco said, standing. "What are we doing out here. Let's go to the Common Room." Draco said.
"Anyways, as I was saying. I'm not surprised because I thought you had a thing for Cedric. He was super fit after all. Beautiful grey eyes, bronzed curls." Ginny grinned. "Like some kind of greek god." That's exactly how Draco had described him and Harry was also realizing... Maybe he had a thing for boys with gray eyes.
"No. I love you Draco. How many times do you want me to say it before you believe me?" Harry said. Draco looked around the room, swallowing hard. Everyone had left. Even Professor Potswell looked like she was heading towards her office in the back, leaving the two boys alone in the potions room.
"It was good that I did anyways. I didn't want people to know I had been gone anyways." Harry said with a shrug.
"Malfoy I swear..." Pansy began. Draco muttered something Harry couldn't hear and Pansy scoffed before taking three steps back and taking slow even breaths. Blaise swallowed hard as he did the same. Malfoy turned around and stepped away from the golden trio. His face was void of all emotion.
"No, it's definitely what I want." Harry breathed out, pulling back slightly so he could press his forehead against Draco's. Draco was bright pink.
"Well it's a wonder any of them learned anything. Do it again." Draco said. The motion took longer for Harry to grasp but eventually Draco was satisfied. He stepped closer to the green eyed boy and held out his hand that wasn't holding his wand. "Alright, try it then and please don't paralyze my whole body unless you're going to stop me from falling."
"Well, it's not like he's wrong. We're notoriously bad people." Draco said. Harry could tell Draco was trying to lighten the mood, get him to laugh. It was sort of working. Harry smirked.
fit." Harry said with a smirk. Draco was going to argue with him but he ended up almost choking on the roll when he looked up at Harry. That smirk he was wearing almost killed Draco.
"Voldemort used to threaten my family, saying he would send Greyback after me, turn me into a..." Draco swallowed hard. "He would pace outside our house, howl all night to keep us up."
"Because you died?" Draco said. Harry was so surprised he took a step back. The lemon scent in the air felt too thick and heavy. "You did die that day right? Voldemort seemed pretty convinced."
"You looked way too happy to be discussing potions and I can't believe I just thought you looked happy talking to Draco of all people." Ginny said. Harry shrugged.
"Weasley just needs some time. He lost his brother. He still hasn't processed all of it properly. Eventually he'll stop acting so much... Like me." Draco said with a smirk. Harry didn't smile though.
"Draco can't we just... Draco." Harry said, following after the blond boy whose hair was still a mess.
"I was not rambling I was telling you how I felt and you interrupted me." Draco said with a frown as Harry finished cleaning up the tea. Harry chuckled again.
"Why would you want to go to bloody America. The food there is atrocious." Pansy said with a scoff, shaking her head. She was pacing now. Draco only saw her pace when she was anxious and Pansy was rarely anxious. She's always been confident, so sure of herself.
They had checked two locations and came up empty. One was a meadow where the grass was dry and dead, all plant life withering thanks to the cold temperatures. Draco stared at the dead grass and dirt long and hard, as if trying to conjure Harry up from it but that didn't happen. The next place they went was a pond that was frozen over partly with thin ice. Draco had left almost immediately as he came upon the scene. "Draco..." Hermione said.
"Why else would I be asking?" Draco shrugged. They had only gone on one date and that had only been this past Saturday. Unless... did making out in random hallways and hanging out in this tower count as dates to Harry? Draco wasn't sure what to consider any of this honestly. He still hadn't convinced himself that this was all happening. It just seemed... Weird sometimes.
"I just... I mean I wish things had happened differently. I wish..." Harry didn't really know what he wished for. Ginny smiled at him sadly, touching his cheek lightly.
"Well are you shagging someone?" Blaise asked. Draco shot Pansy a look. She knew about Draco's preferences but Blaise didn't. Draco didn't think Blaise could handle that much... Change in one year.
"This." Draco said, gesturing between the two of them. "I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of being the bad guy. I'm just... Tired." Draco said and suddenly Harry could see it in his face. He could see the haunted eyes, the dark circles, the sallow cheeks and the tension in Draco's shoulders. Harry wondered how he hadn't seen it all before. "I just want to finish this eighth year without trying to kill you, myself, or anyone else. Okay?"
"I wish I had just taken the cup when Cedric offered. I wish I had been alone in that graveyard. If I was... Cedric would still be here." Harry didn't realize he was crying until Draco rubbed at his cheeks.
"I mean, sure. If you want to paralyze someone's whole body. Honestly Potter, you taught people Defense Against the Dark Arts?" Harry snickered. He didn't know how Draco was able to make him laugh. Sometimes even his friends couldn't do that.
"It's as stiff as a starched shirt Draco." For emphasis, Harry reached up and dragged his fingers through the top of Draco's hair, bringing all of it down to fall in front of his face. "See, that's better." Draco was glaring at Harry through his hair.
us! I was twelve!" Pansy screamed, clawing at Blaise's arms. Blaise's grip on her was strong though and his face stony. Harry was hit with a sudden memory of Pansy, she had been one of the first kids in line to get sorted. He remembered how Fred and George booed. How a lot of people laughed at every single Slytherin kid who got sorted. He remembered it happening every year. There wasn't much the teachers could do. They could never pinpoint who started the taunting first.
"He's not here?" Ginny said in front of him, turning to look around. The attention of Harry's friends shifted to the Slytherin table where Pansy and Blaise were now shooting daggers at them. Harry guessed he would too though if a bunch of Slytherins were randomly staring at them.
Dark Curse on us Potter? We're unarmed." Pansy snarled at him. The tension in Harry's shoulders immediately dropped and the color drained from his face. Draco shot Pansy a look but she was glaring at Harry. "What? Scared? Just
"Remember when we had to come in here for detention?" Draco said. Harry started to laugh again. For some reason, Harry's laugh sounded even better out here in the dark forest than it did in the tower.
any of us could do to stop Voldemort because you were supposed to be the one to defeat him, you. Nobody else." Draco said, half shoving Harry's shoulder.
"Don't follow me Potter, I mean it. I swear to god." Harry paused at the top of the stairs, seeing the savage look in Draco's eyes.
"I've noticed." Harry said with a smile and after that, they slowly eased back into their usual banter which made both of them sigh in relief. Draco had been unsure if this... Whatever this was... Could hold up when they weren't flirting with one another and testing boundaries and snogging in dark towers and hallways. Draco was worried the actual "date" aspect of this might ruin what they had but so far... So good.
"Is it true that you used to sleep under the stairs? In a closet?" Draco asked almost as soon as the bottle left his lips. Harry shrugged.
"And what did you expect it to be?" Mr. Weasley asked as he began to slowly eat his fish. Ginny looked to Harry. It was his turn.
"That's the nice part. Who cares about me? At least you know how much your mom loves you." Harry said. Draco, touched Harry's hand lightly as he began to fold the letter back up.
Draco had tried as best as he could to explain the feelings and emotions that had washed over him when he saw that Harry was alive but... He didn't know how to talk about it without almost completely revealing his true feelings to Harry. Sure, Draco had run back across that courtyard because he loved this school, hated Voldemort, had regained some sense of hope but... The main reason was... If Harry Potter was alive, Draco would be damned if he let anyone try to kill that boy with his stupid lightning scar. If Draco ever got the chance, he would kill Harry himself for giving him such a scare honestly.
how you would put the people in here in danger. I shouldn't blame you but I did." Draco took a step back and licked his lips. "What do I fucking know anyways? I used to think that Voldemort would stop killing, leave everyone alone if he just got what he wanted."
"Nothing. I was trying to wake you up. I kept poking you." Harry said. Draco yawned as Harry spoke and nearly made Harry yawn as well.
"Yes but you're the one who probably put it in their heads that they should come. This is a house full of fuckin Gryffindors." Draco said.
"Hey, you're late." Draco laughed as he stared down at Harry who was lying on the ground. The two of them had slowly made this tower into their own little space. Harry had started bringing (stealing Draco called it) different items from god only knows where and putting it into the room to make it a little more comfortable. The first couple of things were small, a rug for the floor and some pillows so they weren't always sitting on the cold hard ground but Draco said if they were going to spruce this place up, they might as well do it correctly.
"What? Yes you have. What year was it... You and Ron pretended to be Goyle and Crabbe?" Harry stared at Draco in surprise.
"Would we ever wave?" Draco asked, putting his hand back into his pocket, not bothering to fix his hair that was hanging in his eyes. He kind of liked the idea of having his hair messed up in this way and have no one but Harry be the wiser as to why. "Usually, we'd be fighting at this point."
"So you two really don't think that..." Hermione paused. "I mean you'd only been together a couple months before we left and..." She stopped.
"I... I refuse to be an experiment Harry." Harry cocked his head, giving Draco his signature look of complete confusion. "I'm not going to be your gay experiment Harry. I'm a god damn human being. I don't want you to try to figure yourself out with me and then reject me because you realize this isn't for you."
"I don't know." Draco said which clearly wasn't the right answer because Harry huffed and sunk into his chair, turning away from Draco. The Slytherin slowly busied himself by making tea for the two of them. Draco absolutely hated black tea but it was all Harry would drink so that's all they had up here in the tower because apparently Harry had a stash of it and Draco hadn't been brave enough to go back into the Hufflepuff corridors to steal more food from the kitchen. He knew Carter would be lying in wait for him after that last stunt he had pulled.
But clearly, Draco cared. Harry trailed after Draco, the two boys walking in silence for quite some time. Harry grimaced, feeling like he had soured the whole day before it had even started. Draco huffed and stopped and Harry nearly ran into him. "Will you stop pouting and hold my hand Potter." Draco said, glancing back at the dark haired boy over his shoulder.
"That's exactly what someone who has taken a love potion would say." Seamus said. "We need to get McGonagall to remove Draco's spell." Harry laughed.
. Happier than I've seen him in a long time and I couldn't figure out why and then suddenly... He's back to his old self and I don't
"Would he have turned you to mush then? That's what spiders do with their food you know." Draco said.
Harry ran down the hallway again, determined to catch up or get a closer look at the person to see if it really was Draco or not. Instead, when he turned the corner, he found Headmistress McGonagall standing in the middle of the hallway, orbs of light floating around her as she moved through the corridor. She locked eyes with him immediately and Harry paused, wondering if she would yell at him. McGonagall came to a stop in front of him. "Well, Mr. Potter?" The Headmistress asked. Harry sighed and looked away.
"It's my fault." Harry said, looking beyond them, over toward the exit for the library. "Remember our fight sixth year? Remember how I used a Dark Curse on him?" Neither of them said anything. "It's still cutting him open. Snape didn't reverse the Curse like we thought."
fit Draco." Harry said before kissing him. Draco could feel butterflies in his stomach as he kissed Harry back. When they pulled back, Draco ran his thumb lightly over the jagged scar above Harry's eyebrow. Harry always wondered why he did that but he hadn't asked yet.
"I did hate you Harry and I couldn't believe that... I scared you enough to make you use..." Draco bit his bottom lip. "I tried to use that as fuel to help me get over you. I kept thinking...
"Finding someone smarter than you wouldn't be that hard and..." Before Draco could continue, Harry kissed him and Draco melted into it. Draco never tried to hold himself back in his dreams. Reality though was a little different. Harry had already guessed that Draco had a long standing crush on him. Harry just didn't know how long and Draco intended to keep it that way.
it. I don't want you to say it and then realize you didn't mean it." Draco said. Harry was just staring at him.
"You can't just forgive me like that. Don't you hate me?" Harry demanded, gesturing at himself exaggeratedly.
"I didn't want Blaise to walk in." Harry said to Draco as they continued down the busy hallway together. People parted for them like they were diseased, everyone surprised to see the pair of them conversing, walking side by side.
"Aren't they though? Didn't all of them try to help me? Weren't they around me just because of my parents sacrifice? Because of this fucking scar?" Harry demanded, pointing at his forehead. "Sometimes I just want to..." Hermione stood swiftly.
"Can't." Harry said. "I just wanted to know what gave you that cute concentrated look on your face." Draco tried not to blush. Even though they had been together for quite some time now, Harry could still make Draco blush harder than anyone he had ever known. How was that possible? Usually, nothing embarrassed Draco.
The letter continued on for a bit more before she signed off. Harry looked up with a smile. "How nice." Harry said. Draco chuckled.
"Shut up. You know if that's what I was going to do, I would be all over the place." Harry said. Draco shrugged.
Draco sat down next to harry at the table in the library and placed an opened letter in front of him. Harry looked up at Draco quizzically. "My mother asked about you."
"That good huh?" Harry said. Draco half shoved Harry away from him feeling like the blood in his veins was on fire. Draco always knew Harry made him feel like this but Draco just thought this feeling was anger not... The other thing. It's what he had thought for a long time before he sorted through his emotions a little.
"I'm not spelled!" He said with a shake of his head. "I promise. I... I told you guys I was bisexual."
"Yes, it was." Ginny said. Harry smiled at her. "But so long as Draco doesn't try to ruin our final year together at Hogwarts, then... He's alright in my books." Ginny put her head on Harry's shoulder and he sighed, comforted by her gesture.
"Weasley looks like he wants to fight you." Blaise said, though Draco wasn't sure how he could tell if he was supposedly reading his book. Draco looked back up. Hermione was holding Ron's robe, hardly looking up from her own book and Harry was standing directly in front of Ron, as if blocking him from moving forward but Draco could see Ron glaring at him over the top of Harry's messy hair.
"Why do you think?" Draco said with a scoff before tossing the butt of the cigarette onto the stone ground and then jumping off the window ledge. Harry watched him grind the cigarette butt under his heel before casting a small spell to close the window.
"How would you know Potter." Harry sighed slightly. Draco was going to insult him, he could feel it. "Can you even see anything with your stupid hair in your face?" Then Draco did something neither of them expected. He pushed Harry's hair out of his face so that it swept back lazily across his head, exposing his large lightning shaped scar. "Besides that, you have awful vision Harry."
"Nice? She said she wasn't sure why she saved you Harry. According to her, she did this all for me." Harry shrugged.
"Please don't look at me like that." Harry didn't know what to say. Draco his... Boyfriend? Was staring at him like he was about to cry. Harry didn't want to make him cry. He just couldn't understand this. He couldn't understand
"You have good taste." Pansy said, scanning the room. "I'm assuming you decorated Granger. Ron couldn't have done this."
"Why the hell not? He's our best friend. What are we supposed to do? Just let him stay fuckin' miserable." Ron said.
." Hermione begged. "You're scaring me."  Harry looked up at her and saw that Hermione was on the verge of tears. Ron was so thunderstruck all he could do was hold her hand, squeezing it tightly. He didn't know what to say to Harry. His best friend had never sounded so... Empty before.
"Don't say you're sorry. Show me how sorry you are." Draco said. Harry's eyes went a little wide but he eventually grinned and kissed Draco.
"He's shagged somebody." Ginny said. Ron choked on his food as Dean and Seamus howled with laughter. Neville blushed up a storm as Harry's jaw dropped at Ginny's comment.
Also, I've gotten comments on this before (as the story is posted elsewhere) that Snape was able to fully reverse the curse Harry sued on Draco but in my headcanon, he only managed to heal it, not reverse it. Just in case people were confused.
"We know, we know." Ginny said, throwing her arm around Harry's shoulders even though she was too a bit too short for it to be comfortable. "You keep reminding us of this fact." Harry laughed with his her as Ginny changed the subject. Harry tried not to wonder if Hermione's silence meant that she was over analyzing his and Draco's relationship. He was too afraid of what everyone might say if they found out about them and he wasn't ready yet for that kind of confession.
"Why don't we go tell the Headmistress huh? She'll be able to help you." The girl continued to cry and Draco sighed, pushing his robe back and taking his wand out. Harry watched Draco began to undo the spell placed on her hair before he picked up her robe and dusted it off. "Come on, I'll take you. It's not far." Draco said, holding his hand out to her as he held her robe in one hand. Amazingly, Harry watched the girl take his hand and the two of them walked away.
But no matter how pretty Harry thought her smile was, that spark they thought they had was no longer there and they both knew it.
." Draco heard a voice behind him say softly.  Draco immediately panicked, knowing what the spell meant.  He would be stuck to this chair or the table for the next five minutes or so which could only mean... Harry had finally caught him. Draco was scowling when Harry came and sat in the chair next to Draco, careful to not touch the table.  He watched Draco strain to pull his arms up off of the wood but it wouldn't work. "Stop avoiding me." Harry said.
All throughout Charms class, he expected Draco to make some jab at him. Draco was sitting behind Harry after all but no such teasing or taunting ever came. In fact, Draco was so quiet Harry swore he wasn't even breathing at one point. Harry had briefly glanced over his shoulder to make sure the blond boy was still there which, he was, his head on his arms on his desk looking uninterested in what the professor was saying.
"I will but I still want to know what's making you so goddamn happy." Blaise said. Draco swallowed hard as his best friend finished getting ready for bed. All Draco could was think,
." Harry interrupted. "And this has nothing to do with that anyways. Why are you being so difficult?"
"Did she ever tell you what happened out here?" Draco slowly shook his head no, perplexed. He knew his parents were out here when Voldemort attempted to kill Harry but that's all his parents said about that. "She saved me." Draco nearly spit out the firewhiskey.
"I'm going to have a sister." Blaise said, startling Pansy out of her seat and making Draco's eyebrows rise in surprise. Blaise continued to stare out at the lake. The plants swayed in the water as merpeople zipped around them, fish swimming by lazily.
"I have to tell you something Blaise." The taller boy barely looked over at him. "Blaise." Draco said, more insistent this time.
"I'm fine." Draco said through his teeth. He didn't want to argue with Harry. He just wanted to kiss his stupid lips and get the image out of his head of Harry standing over him in that bathroom. Even after all this time, Draco hadn't been able to decide what kind of expression Harry had been wearing as he watched Draco bleed out.
"Yeah, probably but... I mean I never really knew them but I think if I told them how you'd changed they might be open to the idea of us. My mum apparently didn't really like my father when they first met." Draco cocked his head.
"If I was afraid of snakes, I would make a piss poor Slytherin." Harry shrugged a little. "Can you do that thing still... Talk to snakes?"
"Okay but you also know how traditional both she and him are. They're not going to accept me if I tell them about myself. They'll try to... I mean they just might..." Draco couldn't finish the sentences. He didn't even want to think about what his parents might do if he told them he's gay. They would lament about how they would never have a heir, how Draco had soiled their family name and if Draco could prolong their embarrassment of him, he would. He wasn't sure what eh would do if his parents stopped loving him.
But he didn't get a chance to say any of that because a soft voice called out, "Harry." Draco turned around and found Hermione at the bottom of the moving staircase, staring up at them quizzically. Her nose was scrunched up and her wild dark hair was falling in her eyes. "Are you... Okay?" She looked at Draco not with... Hate or fear or anything just... Confusion.
"Oh and everyone that attacks Hogwarts is somehow after you?" Draco demanded, running one hand through Harry's hair lightly, his other hand tracing the lightening scar from the root of Harry's hair to his eyebrow.
"Less time than it took you." Harry rolled his eyes and put his wand back into the pocket of his fleece pants. "Are we done here then? Are you satisfied with my lesson Potter?"
"Nothing." Harry said at the same moment that Draco motioned for Harry to meet him by the doors. Harry glanced towards the front where all the teachers sat. Headmistress McGonagall was standing, eyeing the two boys curiously. Hagrid had even stopped eating, fork poised halfway between his plate and his open mouth.
"Kiss me, please." He said. That's all Harry had been thinking about honestly but he wasn't sure if Draco wanted to kiss him. Harry leaned in and kissed him slowly. "I still love you." Draco whispered. "Nothings going to change that."
"What?" Blaise said. Draco huffed, crossing his arms over his chest. "Did I walk in on something?" Blaise said. Draco was still clothed, the buttons of his shirt were undone and his hair was slightly askew but nothing looked out of sorts. "Don't worry. I won't be here for long."
"It's just... Little things that I noticed about you or started to realize more of when we started to become friends." Harry said slowly. "At first, I didn't really know how to feel about you and then it was like... I was thinking about you all the time again except in a different way. Then I noticed the way you looked at me and.. I just knew I had to do something about it."
"Honestly boys." Hermione said, interrupting their shouting. "Must we berate him? Harry's allowed his privacy." Hermione said, gesturing to him.
"God is this going to be a regular thing. I think I need to blind myself or become deaf." A voice said behind them. Draco half stiffened.
"Thanks I guess." Draco said. He mumbled, looking up at Pansy who was tapping her foot and trying hard not to give Harry a death glare. Draco sighed, stood and gathered his things. Without another word to Harry, the Slytherins left the room. Harry left too, so confused by the three simple words that had fallen out of Draco's mouth,
"I can't wait to go back to Hogwarts next week. I need to see our other friends, not just you two nimrods." Hermione said.
"Babe, she never thought she would ever hear you say you were sorry. When she said she appreciated you apologizing, it was her saying that she forgives you. She's seen how much you've changed. She's told me so herself." Draco frowned, not believing him. "She apologized for punching you in the face didn't she?" Draco shrugged.
"I would say I'm impressed but I'm not. Twelve year old Americans can learn that spell in their sleep." Harry snorted.
"I told Reg not to invite us." Draco said, running one hand through his hair. "I knew once Pansy found out about it she would want to go out of spite, Blaise too."
"When I was six I called my Aunt 'mum' once and she went ballistic." Draco snorted. "What?" Harry asked, watching Draco try to stifle his laugh with his hand.
"What?" Harry said, looking at his friends. Ginny was eyeing him funny, eyes half narrowed as she chewed on a bite of bread. Harry hadn't realized how wide his smile was.
"It's fine Draco." Harry said softly, kissing the side of his face. Draco said nothing. "Draco." Harry insisted, touching Draco's chin lightly so the blond boy could turn his head and look at him. "Come on, let's go to sleep babe." Harry said with a small smile. He kissed Draco's lips lightly and Draco sighed, the tension leaving his shoulders. Harry took Draco's hands and they both stood. Harry kicked off his shoes before pulling back the sheets of Draco's bed and slipping under them, pulling Draco with him. The two boys laid down facing one another and Harry lightly pushed some of Draco's hair out of his eyes. "Don't have nightmares tonight." Harry whispered.
"Bastard." Draco retorted. The two of them stared at one another for a beat before Draco grinned and sat down next to Harry. "So guess what."
"Harry!" Hermione exclaimed, rushing after him, Ron right behind her as someone from the rows of books hushed them.
"Shut up. Let me do this." Harry said, looking up at Draco. Draco shut his mouth as Harry kissed down his chest. Draco was breathing fast, chest rising and falling quickly as he ran his hands through Harry's wild, dark hair.
"Ah, must be Pansy." Hermione said. "I can feel Blaise's agitated magic from out here." She said. Draco glared at Harry.
Draco wasn't sure if he was having a nightmare or not.It certainly didn't feel like one. Harry was in it but that was nothing new. Draco found himself dreaming about Harry often, even before they started to become friends. Usually they would be fighting but sometimes... Sometimes they would be dreams like this where Harry was actually giving Draco one of his honest to god, ear to ear smiles. "That's a silly thing to say." Draco said. Had he ever said the word silly out loud before now?
"Okay well... I'm good at keeping my own secrets." Harry said, pushing his food around on his plate.
"You can call me whatever you want Harry. I think I prefer hearing you call me Draco though." Harry smiled and kissed his cheek.
"It's fine Draco." Harry said softly, sitting down on Draco's bed. "I just think... I mean don't you want to tell them? Doesn't it eat you up inside?" Harry said.
"Fine. You'll have three minutes." Harry muttered. Draco breathed out a sigh of relief and instead of paying attention to Professor Potswell, he began to craft his apology to Harry in his head.
The third area they stumbled on, they found him. At first, Hermione thought it was just another dead end. It was just a fallen log and a pile of rocks. But Draco picked up speed and shouted. "Harry!" That's when Ron and Hermione spotted him as well, lying on the ground beneath the fallen log. He was motionless. Hermione feared the worst as Draco skidded to the ground on his knees and shook Harry's shoulder. The temperatures at night hit bellow freezing. Harry could be... Hermione heard Draco mutter a warming spell over him and that's when Harry reached up and hit Draco's hand lightly, opening his eyes.
things." Ginny said, crossing her arms over her chest. Harry blushed harder. Had Harry given any indication to Ginny that he might like guys? Is that why she thought it might be best if they broke up? God, Harry hoped not. He did really like Ginny, just not in that way anymore.
"Well... I usually only come up here when I can't sleep." Draco put the cigarette in his mouth and pulled his wand out from where he had tucked it into his sock. Harry nearly grabbed his own wand, worried Draco might try to hex him but Draco simply waved his wrist, muttering a spell under his breath. The rest of the candles in the tower lit by themselves and Harry could see Draco more clearly now. He looked even more hollow and tired somehow in this candlelight.
"Now he tells me." Harry said with a laugh and shake of his head. "So I didn't have to sneak out of the room at five in the morning?"
Harry was running his hands through his hair nervously and pacing just on the outskirts of the Forbidden Forest when Draco walked up. Harry had been so consumed with his own thoughts that he didn't even notice Draco until the smell of his cologne wafted over towards him in the small breeze. Harry looked up to find Draco striding towards him with a backpack on his back that Harry had never seen before. He was wearing a black turtleneck sweater and dark jeans. His cheeks were red from the wind and cold. Harry found himself surging forward to meet him. "Hi." Harry said breathlessly.
There was a knock at the door and Draco glanced over at it, running one hand through his blonde hair. Blaise never knocked, neither did Pansy. They would always shout at him through the wood door. That could only mean one thing. Draco stood, opened his bedroom door and saw nothing. He smiled and held out his hand. A disembodied arm appeared and took Draco's hand. Draco dragged Harry into his room and Harry flung back the cloak with an air of finesse. "Ta-da." Harry said lightly. Draco rolled his eyes and pulled Harry in for a kiss. Harry kissed him back happily before saying,
"God, don't remind me. Our house elf walked in on us remember? God I'm positive he ran and told my father after he saw us. Father couldn't look at me proper for
"Yes it is. You're in a sour mood, he's in a sour mood. He's happy, you're happy. Honestly, if you two aren't fucking behind everyone's backs then I think..."
"Well... They smoke this magical cigarettes. I like the blueberry flavored ones. They like lemon." Ron nodded.
"My father was there... When Voldemort returned." Draco said his voice sounding far away even though he was right next to Harry. "I asked him once if... If he felt sorry for what had happened to Cedric. He wouldn't answer me."
"Are we... I mean we're dating... Right?" Harry said. Draco looked over at Harry as the kettle startled to whistle. Draco undid the spell and the sound slowly died.
"Oh... I don't really know who the Prefects are this year." Harry said with a small frown. Draco shrugged.
"Oh yeah." Seamus said, standing with him. "See you lot later." Seamus smiled as he and Dean said goodbye, the two boys walking off together and talking about their Herbology class.
Draco's ears were ringing so he couldn't hear what Blaise was saying but he knew his friend was trying to help him as he said spells Draco couldn't hear and covered him with a blanket. When Draco finally began to regain feeling in his arms and legs and the world stopped spinning, he slowly uncurled. Blaise shoved a cup of tea in his face. "Where did you get this from?" Draco said, confused as he stared up at his friend. Blaise nodded to the door where Pansy stood, a troubled look on her face.
"What are you reading babe?" Harry asked. Draco's heart fluttered in his chest as he looked past his blonde hair at his stupidly good looking boyfriend.
"Then tell me why you can't just let me forgive you. What's so terrible about forgiveness?" Draco demanded. Harry slowly adjusted his sitting position, putting the cigarette to his lips and taking a long drag as he crossed his legs. Draco did the same.
It used to be natural for Draco to search for Harry in a crowd of people. The reason used to be so Draco could taunt or tease Harry in some way but now... Draco was looking for him because he desperately wanted to talk to him at all hours or the day and the thought absolutely horrified him. The knowledge that Harry wanted to talk to Draco too didn't comfort him though.
"Shut up! Shut up! shut up! You're both horrid! I hate you!" Pansy exclaimed. Draco nearly fell to the ground with laughter, he was so happy. Draco decided right then and there that if he could tell Blaise, then he could certainly tell his parents. What was the worst that could happen after all? Draco couldn't wait to talk to Harry about this.
"It's not rumor if it's true." Pansy said. Harry ground his teeth and threw his hands in the air, walking away from her.
"Wh-what does that mean Harry?" Hermione said. Lately, a lot of the deaths of his friends, his family had been weighing on him. His parents had died to protect him and everyone after that... Had died because they believed he was the Chosen One. They believed he would defeat Voldemort. And while he did, it had come at a price. A price Harry was now realizing might have been too high.
"I was surprised he didn't try to kill Pans..." Draco murmured. "If I was him I would have." Harry pursed his lips.
Harry had been robotically spreading butter on some rolls. Some, as in four. He had put butter on four rolls now and hadn't eaten a single one. He was just, putting butter on them. Hermione was about to tell him he was going to have high cholesterol if he ate that much butter but the doors to the dining hall opened, long after everyone was supposed to be in their seats, at their tables. So when it opened, everyone stopped and stared.
"Well it's a very big bridge." He muttered. "I bet he's hiding something. I bet him and the other two are plotting something against us right now. You know my mum's worried the Death Eaters might try something, even with Voldemort gone."
"Fine, Potter. Come to my room tonight." Draco said. Harry looked at Draco with evident surprise and Draco rolled his eyes. "Now look who is..."
"A sister. I'm going to have a sister." Blaise said, looking up at Pansy and then at Draco. "My mum told me over the summer. I think she's six months along now."
"Harry are you... Is this some kind of prank you're pulling on us?" Ron said, putting his hand on the door so Harry wouldn't be able to open it. Harry cocked his head.
"Well, if he's expecting an apology from Pansy, he's going to have to wait for the rest of his life. Pansy is never sorry about anything." Draco said. Harry sighed.
"Fuck the eggs!" Dean exclaimed, nearly knocking his entire plate onto the floor. "What in the bloody hell was that!"
"Especially you." Harry said. Draco put his quill down and looked to Harry with a solemn expression.
"Even when I was here, I swore I could hear him howling in the night, pacing outside my bedroom door."
"Look me in the eyes and say that Potter and if I think you're telling the truth then..." Amazingly, Harry watched Pansy's eyes begin to water. "Then I don't know what I'll do." God, she even sounded choked up. Harry looked Pansy dead in the eyes and couldn't bring himself to say a damn word. He had broken up with Draco in his mind but his heart still refused to believe it. It wouldn't let him speak. "I knew it." Pansy whispered and then suddenly, Pansy was hugging him, her arms wrapped around Harry tightly.
"We're not going after Malfoy." Hermione said, in a commanding voice. "If what Harry told them is true... If Harry broke up with Draco because of the Curse that's still inflicted upon him then... Draco and Harry probably haven't talked in
"It's not that it's just.." Draco scoffed at himself. "It's weird. I just can't believe you're into me sometimes." Draco muttered. Harry cocked his head and watched Draco cross his arms over his chest. Harry stood, placed his teacup down and moved to stand in front of Draco. He placed his hands on the armrests of Draco's chair and leaned in, smirking slightly. Draco leaned away from Harry, surprised.
Harry had closed his eyes when he kissed Draco and as soon as he felt Draco's warmth leave, his weight disappearing from on top of him, he opened his eyes. Draco was breathing heavily, staring at Harry with a wild look in his eyes. The bottle of firewhiskey was slowly dribbling out onto the stone. Draco must have knocked it over when he threw himself practically five feet away. Draco didn't know what to say and Harry didn't either so the silence stretched between them.
"I... Yeah I guess it would." Harry said as Draco turned back around in his seat and looked down at his parchment paper and books again. Slowly, Draco gathered his things and began to stand. Harry had forgotten that Draco was taller than him. Harry stepped back.
"They're just sitting there Ron. Keep your voice down. Don't start something." Harry said. Ron had been drinking nonstop since they arrived. He was pissed that they were here "ruining" everything even though they hadn't done anything except arrive.
"Mostly we did this and... Other things in our rooms." Draco said. Harry looked away, blushed even harder.
"It wasn't where you died was it?" Draco said. Harry laughed as Draco pulled out a familiar bottle of alcohol.
"No it's not. I'm not leaving the two of them with you. You don't need them badgering about something that's
"Someone wants their best friend to come with him to a party." Harry looked up at Ron and saw how serious was. With a sigh, Harry finally relented.
"These aren't as addictive as muggle cigarettes and not as harsh." Draco said. Harry looked up at him skeptically. "They have different flavors too." Slowly, Harry reached out and took one. "That one's blueberry." Draco muttered, before taking out one that was tinted yellow and putting it between his teeth.
"I have other friends." Draco said with a small yawn. Harry could tell he was going to fall asleep soon.
"N-not in a while. Not since we've been together!" Draco stammered out. Harry swallowed hard and put his hood up, disappearing completely. "Harry wait!" But Draco grabbed empty air. His bedroom door opened and closed and Harry was gone. Draco could feel himself beginning to panic, his hands going numb. He sat down on the ground next to his bed and tried to remember how to breathe but he was so dizzy. So goddamn dizzy. He drew his knees in and wrapped his arms around his legs and thats how Blaise found him some time later.
"Insult you. It's what I do best." Draco said, grabbing up the vial of lake water and dumping it into the concoction. Harry watched as Draco expertly dumped in one item after the other, barely even looking at what he was picking up and placing into the cauldron. Slowly, the black mixture turned a dark violet and then an almost galaxy blue.
"Okay." Harry said, suddenly feeling more confident. He marched over to Draco who tried not to move a muscle. If he leaned in, Harry would know how badly Draco wanted to kiss him. Harry's eyes searched Draco's expressionless face, trying to find some hint that he was messing with Harry or some form of revulsion but there was nothing. Harry sighed.
"Because I'm not used to us not talking, even if we are just at each others throats." Harry said.  Draco looked over at Harry in half surprise. Is that really how the
"Are you gonna drag my grade down?" Harry tried not to blush. "I'm fairly certain that's why the Professor put us together." Draco said, looking away. "I'm the best in the class and you're the worst."
"Adelaide Murton was a friend of mine before she left two years back." Luna said lightly. "She cursed out some rather... Ruder older boys from her house so they would leave me alone." Ron didn't look impressed.
"I didn't even think about it until Hermione brought it up actually." Harry said with a shake of his head. "He was a good looking guy." Harry said with a soft smile.
"That." Harry licked his lips and then copied Draco. He expected the smoke to hurt, that it would make him want to cough out his lungs. But a weird warm feeling spread through his chest and everything tasted like fresh, ripe blueberries. Harry slowly exhaled, feeling a little calmer.
"It's eight o'two." Harry said. Draco chuckled and plopped down onto one of the chairs, smirking at Harry.
"Well tick tock Potter. You're going to die fairly soon. You better start complaining." Draco said. Harry snorted.
"You go." Harry was already walking away. "Keep up with Harry." Ron was torn between his best friend and his girlfriend. "Draco, please." Hermione begged. Draco finally looked up and locked eyes with her. Her brown eyes were warm and pleading. Hermione had never looked at him like that before. Clenching his jaw and then his fists, Draco slowly began to walk towards them. Hermione kept waiting for him to catch up to her and Ron or go ahead of them to catch up to Harry but he always stayed several feet back and when they got back into the Castle, Draco disappeared completely.
Draco could feel Harry begin to undo the buttons of his shirt and Draco was still trying to decide where he wanted this to go, if anywhere. Why else would he invite Harry into his room? What did Harry think about why Draco invited him? Before Draco could pull back and ask though, a sound caught his attention. Someone was running down the corridor. "Stop." Draco said, pushing Harry back and in the same swift motion, throwing Harry's invisibility cloak around him and not a second too soon because Blaise burst through the door and Draco blushed hard. "Blaise what the fuck." Blaise gave him a funny look.
"Fine." Harry cleared his throat dramatically and Draco glanced down at him. He was smirking at Draco, that mischievous glint in his green eyes. "I'm sorry Draco." Draco was just staring at Harry, who could feel his heart beating fast in his chest. This was a very compromising position they managed to put themselves in and Harry hadn't quite yet decided if he liked it or not.
"If you must know... I was dating Draco and we broke up." Harry said. Hermione's eyebrows shot up and Ron's jaw dropped.
"I have resources Harry, you know this by now." Draco said. Harry rolled his eyes. Despite being reluctant at first, Draco had really come around to the idea of them being friends. Almost every night now, the two boys had been meeting up in their tower talking for hours on end. Hermione and Ron kept commenting on how tired he always seemed and Harry just shrugged off their concerns. He was tired sure but he was actually having a lot of fun learning about the boy he thought was his arch enemy.
"Oh... Hello Malfoy." Draco blew out smoke slowly, staring at him. Harry realized he was probably waiting for him to say something more but... Harry didn't know what to say. What was Draco doing up here? How did he know about this place? Draco turned away from him with a slight shake of his head. Then, Harry did something dumb. "You smoke?" Harry asked, watching Draco put the cigarette to his lips again. The end of it burned a bright orange as Draco inhaled.
"Well we must go back and check. I volunteer you to be spider food." Draco said with a cheeky grin at Harry.
"I'm going to be sick." Ron said, clutching his stomach. Harry has never seen Ron throw up food, he considers it a waste so Harry was very surprised to see that Ron was looking a little green.
"Draco, come on." Hermione said. Draco looked frozen to his spot, staring at the ground. "Draco we're not leaving you out here. Now come here now. Pansy will kill us if we leave the forest without you."
"Oh." He wasn't sure exactly what to say. How should they go about this? They couldn't exactly stroll through the castle holding hands right? Harry wasn't sure either of them were comfortable enough for that. "How about... We just go on a picnic... In the forbidden forest." Draco burst out laughing and Harry felt stupid.
"Don't come to the tower tonight. I would like to be alone." The two boys had never really established a schedule of who should get the tower when. And even though Draco had seemed pretty adamant that he didn't want to share it with Harry, he had been constantly telling him when he
Draco's hands were in Harry's hair because despite him always complaining about how messy it was, he loved his dark, wild hair. Harry's hands meanwhile were... Roaming. He was pulling Draco's shirt out of his pants again and just barely touching the bare skin of his back. For some reason, Harry loved touching Draco with his ice cold hands. It always made a shiver go up Draco's spine.
. I'm sorry. Will you let me explain?" Draco said. Harry looked up at him. Draco wasn't someone Harry would characterize as someone who would beg but right now that's exactly what he was doing, pleading for Harry to talk to him. There was this fragility and softness in his grey eyes that Harry didn't want to say no too. So he didn't.
"I can't even do that. It's too awkward for Harry." Harry started to laugh and Ron joined him. Hermione rolled her eyes at her idiot friends.
"Yeah, you can actually." Pansy said with an air of snark. "You need to apologize to Draco and shag him if necessary if he refuses to accept it." Harry's jaw dropped wide open as his brain tried to restart itself. What did she just say? Harry knew he had told Hermione and Ron  but... Nobody else should know about his relationship with Draco unless... Draco had told Pansy himself. Draco never said he had done that though. Then again... When was the last time Harry had talked to Draco? "Do I need to repeat myself? Pansy said.
"Whenever Draco feels like that he takes a walk in the Forbidden Forest." Harry said. Ron snorted and didn't ask why Harry knew that.
"Luna said she saw you... Run across the courtyard when I showed everyone I wasn't dead." Harry said. Draco stopped pacing, his back to Harry. He was tense all over. Nobody had brought up what had happened before now, though Draco was sure for weeks afterwards that word was spreading about his shout of joy at seeing Harry still alive. The only ones who had talked to him about it were his parents who tried not to accuse him of utterly betraying them when he ran back to fight for Hogwarts, to fight against them and Voldemort.
"Hello Blaise." Draco said lightly as the taller boy came to walk beside them on Harry's right side.
"I will tell the Headmistress you're harassing me then." Draco said. Harry laughed and shook his head, stepping back again.
Had they really been together for over a month? It didn't seem real sometimes, at least not to Draco. Sometimes he expected to wake up from some crazily long dream and be completely devastated if Harry treated him with cold, unwavering indifference. Harry was good at that. And Draco wasn't entirely sure if he could say that they were "together" if their relationship consisted mostly of them sneaking around at odd hours of the night and day. It was especially hard for Draco to consider that they were "together" because they had barely been friends for three months. Harry couldn't just decide to like Draco now after years of them hating each other. It was just... It didn't sound right at all.
"You called me Harry." Draco's jaw clenched. "Also that's the first time you've yelled at me since we've been back here."
"What? What did I say?" Harry said, touching Draco's shoulder lightly as Draco covered his face with his hands. Didn't Draco say he wanted this? No... He said he just wanted to sleep next to Harry he was just... Teasing him earlier. "I'm sorry." Harry said. Draco uncovered his face and looked over at Harry whose glasses were askew, hair looking like they had just fucked even though they hadn't. God why was his hair so soft.
"We have to talk to him." Ron hissed to Hermione as they side-eyed Draco and Pansy across the quad. Blaise was nowhere in sight and that was good. Neither of them wanted to confront three Slytherins, let alone Draco and Pansy. "We have to do it now."
time. Can't be much of a Chosen One if you loose to someone like me." Draco said. Harry shook his head.
"Well I'm a bloody wizard so I'll use my magic how I want." Draco said. From his pants pocket, Draco pulled out a pack of cigarettes. He took one out for himself and then held the pack out to Harry who stared at it confused. "Do you want one or not?" Draco said.
"I just came to get something then I'm going back to Pansy's." Draco ignored him. "You can get back to your wank when I'm done."
"He was one of the best." Hermione said lightly. Closing her book, she hugged Harry tightly and with a sigh, Harry slowly wrapped his arms around her too.
"I don't know why Ron's so bent out of shape." Dean said. "He was your archenemy." He nudged Harry who tried to smile. "Anyways, let's go Seamus we have to..."
"I just... I still don't get it. I know my mom loves me but..." Draco didn't want to say it but he had thought about it on several occasions. He had thought his parents fear of Voldemort, trumped their love for him.
. Let's do it." Draco was smiling at him in such a way that Harry could see his dimple. It made Harry smile back at him.
"Well it was well deserved. Honestly, the state of your hair sometimes Potter." Draco said, trying to think up excuses.
"You had a thing with Harris didn't you?" Blaise said. Draco sucked in a deep breath of air and his cheeks flared pink. Pansy looked almost aghast.
"Then who am I acting like?" Draco said, eyebrows half arching down, the corners of his lips tugging down slightly. It wasn't a mean look though. It was
"Sorry I'm late. Carter was giving me hell about stealing food." Draco said. Harry cocked his head, unsure who Carter was. "Jeremy Carter? The Hufflepuff Prefect?" How did Draco know more of the students at Hogwarts than Harry did?
"It's been almost two months since you started dating this person and somehow, we still don't know who it is." Ron said, stabbing his fork into his eggs. "How are you keeping her a secret? I don't get it. You're horrible with secrets."
"I can't believe you took all of this for me though." Harry said. Draco clenched his jaw. Damnit Harry had such a cute smile.
"I'll come." Harry said before Draco could finish his sentence. "Just... How? The Slytherin's dormitory has always been... Hidden." Draco shrugged.
"Maria Zhang?" Ron said. "She's from Ravenclaw." Harry shrugged. He didn't even know who that was. "Fauna Thompson?" Harry shook his head.
"You don't seem suspicious about Malfoy at all and you certainly aren't trying to follow him around anymore. Right?" Harry smirked.
"Shut the hell up Potter. Don't talk to me about anxiety. Your hands are shaking right now." Draco said. They were and Harry hadn't even noticed.
"Yes we are." Harry said, smoke curling out from his mouth. "Got any more of these?" He asked. Draco slowly pulled the packet out from his pants and despised how the only thing he could think about was the fact that Harry and him had indirectly kissed.
"We wait for Harry to come back." Hermione said. "That's all we're going to do for now and then..." And then she wasn't so sure.
Draco took another step back, holding his hand out so Harry wouldn't come closer. "What?" Harry said.
"Because I love you and I don't care what happened between us. Why do you?" Draco shouted at him. Harry said nothing, just stared into Draco's grey eyes and knew that part of him was lying. A Part of Draco
"It just felt like a good time. Neville's speech was over, he pulled the sword out of the sorting hat..." Harry paused. "I didn't want him to get hurt."
Harry listened as Draco murmured a spell under his breath. The spell sounded familiar but it wasn't one of the normal healing spells. In awe, Harry watched the wounds on Draco's chest slowly close up until they were nothing but faint pink scars all over his upper body. Harry breathed a sigh of relief. He hadn't realized he had been holding his breath. "Draco are you okay?" Harry asked softly. Draco wouldn't look him in the eyes. "What was that?" Still nothing. "Draco."
"Shut up. No it's not." Harry said. He was staring at the scars on Draco's chest with fear and almost... Anger. "I
"Ghosts." McGonagall said. Harry pursed his lips as she touched his shoulder gingerly. "It's going to be a tough year Harry and I'm sorry but you know the rules. Let's get you back to bed shall we?" Harry nodded and Headmistress McGonagall personally escorted him back to the Gryffindor Dorms. The two of them talked lightly about their summers and what they did.
"It is. Could you please scurry back to your friends and leave me alone. I need to study." Draco said. Harry glanced behind him. Had he walked right past Ron and Hermione? He hadn't noticed. His best friends were staring at him confused.
"Yeah, I know." Harry said, closing the door to the tower behind him. Draco continued to place, slower this time. Lemon smoke drifted around him lazily. "Can I ask you something?" Harry said.
"No but... I've noticed you're not here sometimes when I wake up in the middle of the night. I've also heard you... Sneak out before. I just want to know where you're going." Ron said.
close to that spiteful look Draco would always get when talking to Harry. It was more like slight annoyance or displeasure.
"Where's Malfoy?" Harry didn't mean to say it out loud but now that it was out there, he couldn't exactly take it back. Harry could feel Ron and Hermione's eyes on him as well as Dean's and Seamus'.
"What? It's true isn't it." Pansy said looking at Harry with part innocence, part know-it-all attitude.
"If anyone is being weird Potter, it's you." Draco said. Harry could feel a slight blush creeping up his cheeks.
"All I had left to say it, that I don't like thinking about how you could be with anyone other than me." Draco said. Harry smirked as he stood back up. He lightly brushed back Draco's hair.
"What about me?" He said, sliding his hand down the railing to touch Draco's arm lightly. Draco put his hand on the railing, over Harry's and watched him smile. Draco shrugged.
"Thanks." Draco swallowed hard and Harry could just make out in the moonlight that he was blushing red.
"I know a couple people who have talked to me about it. Harry makes six." Neville said, nodding to his friends.
"Hey Malfoy." Harry said before cringing at his stupidly overly cheerful greeting. Draco glanced over at him, tucking his books under his arm.
"Of course it does." Draco said, sitting next to Harry. "But the fear of what my friends, my parents might say to me is
"Being pushy." Harry said. "I should have stopped when you said it the first time. You said you just wanted to sleep next to me right? Let's do that." Harry said, tugging on his shoulder so Draco would turn to look back at him.
"You're not really Harry Potter are you?" Harry started to laugh as Ginny said this. "I'm serious. There's no way you're Harry. Who are you? Why aren't you complaining about how much hair gel Malfoy uses or how he's always so rude and sarcastic?"
The tower was a wreck. The table and chairs were overturned, partly smashed or stomped on. The tea set was in shattered against one wall and Draco had even gone as far as breaking all the glass out of the windows, letting in the cold night air. Draco himself was lying on his back on the ground, eyes closed with a blueberry cigarette between his fingers. "Is lemon not your favorite anymore?" Draco shot up, startled. His eyes were wide as he stared at Harry, wondering if the dark haired boy would disappear.
"I can't believe..." Draco had goosebumps up and down his arm. He wasn't sure if he was simply shocked or scared. Why would his mother do that? Is that why they were trying to hustle him away when Harry jumped back to life? Voldemort would know she lied and then... "Why would she do that! Voldemort could have..."
don't freak out." Draco begged. He wasn't exactly sure why he himself wasn't freaking out. Maybe seeing how stressed Harry was calmed him but... Barely.
"I'm pretty sure if everyone knew I was gay, they would think I was into you." Draco murmured, burying his face in Harry's neck. God why did his hair smell so good? Harry grinned.
"I will be just... I need a moment to think." Draco said. Harry could see that Draco was serious so with another heavy sigh, Harry stood up and walked out of the library. As soon as Draco was sure Harry wasn't watching, he slumped down into his seat a little, wanting to slam his head into the wooden table. Why was Harry so goddamn insistent?
"To hell I don't. I was his last girlfriend. I need to know who it is first so I can smack him upside the head and tell him to find someone else." Ginny said, taking a bite out of her roll, chewing thoughtfully. "Were you going around snogging Harry when..."
"No... But I always wanted some. A little sister, perhaps or a brother. Maybe both." Harry was surprised by this. "I'd make an awful big brother though."
"Oh but you do. Like I said, Draco's my best friend and..." Harry grabbed Pansy's hand and dragged her down a different, empty hallway and she yelped as Harry pulled her into a deserted classroom. "Don't get any funny ideas Potter! You're not going to convince me you're not shagging Draco if you try to kiss me!" Harry was stunned.
"I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm actually excited to go back to school too." Ron admitted. "I'm ready for a nice, relaxing eighth year without any complications or problems now that nothing is trying to kill us or attack the school or anything."
"I mean... You kept telling me in the beginning that... You didn't know who you were anymore. That you can't decide if you're still supposed to be the savior, the Chosen One or if that was ever who you were in the first place. You said you weren't even sure if you were... Harry Potter sometimes." Draco said.  Harry nodded thoughtfully, licking his lips.
"Only because that's how they wanted us to be. That's what I became because it's what they expected. How could we be anything but? I never had a bloody choice in the matter." Pansy said. Draco swallowed hard, knowing where she was coming from. He had known he would be a Slytherin long before he had even been accepted at Hogwarts. It was just... A given.
"Ah yes, all us former Death Eaters and the Chosen One all in one room for a fuckin Christmas party. God the room had some much tension you could have cut into it and served it for dessert." Harry laughed and plopped down onto the couch next to Draco.
had gone through... He might have still been killed." Draco kissed his cheek. "He told me to take the cup for myself but I... I insisted we go together, win together." Harry smiled. "He was laughing when we landed in that graveyard. We both were. We thought we were back. We didn't know..." Harry ground his teeth.
"Boo." Harry jumped in his seat, slightly startled and heard Draco laugh above him.Harry turned with a frown to look at the blond Slytherin.
Two days later, Harry was still missing and nobody at Hogwarts had any idea as to where he might be.
What Hermione had said didn't necessarily bug Harry it just... Surprised him. Had everyone thought that he had a thing for Cedric? I mean, he did have that picture of Cedric still tucked into his wallet. He even occasionally looked at it. The photo was frayed around the edges but Harry liked seeing Cedric break out into a wide smile.
"But nothing." Ron hissed. "You heard what she said. Everyone heard what she fucking said." Ron spat out.
"Harry and I would come out here together. Well, I used to do it by myself and he followed me one night because he thought I might be doing something horrible but... The castle is suffocating and I told Harry I wanted to get lost in the Forbidden Forest and die." Draco said. Hermione and Ron shared a look. "We came out here often and never died. If he's been out here for two days though... Alone..." Draco didn't even want to think about it.
"I don't know you're just... Different." Draco was staring at him with a blank look on his face, making Harry nervous. "You don't antagonize me anymore. Wasn't that your favorite hobby? And you certainly aren't acting like you're the best thing to happen to the world since sliced bread." Harry was rambling, he knew that but he couldn't stop. "So what's wrong? Why are you being weird?"
"Positive." Luna said. She pushed her hair behind her ears. "I think after Goyle died... Well, it changed him." Harry felt his body warm, as if he could still feel the heat from the
"Probably." Harry said. Draco snorted and shifted around in the windowsill so he was no longer hanging all the way out of it. He put one leg back into the tower and then the other. Harry backed away from him a little as Draco stood up.
"Well... What brought this on all of a sudden?" Mrs. Weasley asked, nervously passing around some dinner rolls. "I mean... You two seemed fine over the summer." Harry looked to Ginny.
"Well I... Uhh...." Harry said, unsure of how to proceed. He slowly blushed all the way to his ears.
"Leave him alone. Eat your own food." Hermione chastised. Harry half smiled at her and Hermione turned his smile warily. Harry tried to zone back in on the conversations around him but he found it difficult. His mind was suddenly elsewhere.
When they had watched the sorting ceremony not long ago, Harry wasn't sure if he should feel excited for the young students or worried. Voldemort was gone after all and soon, Harry would be too. There would be no immediate threat to the school anymore. If Voldemort (if he managed to claw his way back to the world of the living that is) or anyone else tried to attack Harry, he wouldn't be here at Hogwarts necessarily. Unless he completely failed his eighth year and kept coming back but then where would that leave him?
"You couldn't warn me mate? I have to find out in the great hall with everyone else that you're shagging the Chosen one?" Blaise demanded in a tone of voice Harry couldn't decipher.
"Why do you ask?" Draco said. His eyes scanned the horizon. From this high up and at this time of night, he couldn't even see the ground. He knew it must have been about fifty or so feet bellow though.
"But she liked you before any of us did. You used to tease her and she would say that it didn't matter. She would just brush it off."
It was well past curfew but per usual, Harry couldn't sleep. Everything was far too loud and Harry needed to get his head space cleared out. He certainly couldn't do that with the other Gryffindor boys snoring up a storm. Just being in a room full of sleeping people, wishing you were one of them, was torture for Harry. He needed to get out. He needed to go somewhere quiet. And so Harry went where he always did, the mostly abandoned North Tower.
"I heard you shuffling around outside. Honestly Harry there's no need to be so nervous. It's just me." Draco said.
"We've met in the library a couple of times and we talk in class all the time." Harry said, pursing his lips. "I think both of us find this a little weird so we don't really talk to one another when there's a lot of people around." Harry locked eyes with Draco across the yard. The blond boy was smirking, like he could hear their conversation. "Anyways it's not really a big deal. We just talk. At least we're not trying to kill one another." Harry said.
"Hello Harry, Draco. Come in." Hermione said with a pleasant smile, kissing Harry's cheek. She smiled warmly at Draco who kind of wanted to run back down the hall and disappear. Ron and Hermione were having a house warming party. The two of them had just moved into a posh new apartment thanks to Hermione and Ron's new jobs with the Ministry. They were both finally making enough money to get their own place together and the pair couldn't be happier.
"We were discreet. I do have an invisibility cloak after all." Ron made a retching noise, though nothing actually came out.
"Hermione hated what I did to you." Harry said, surprising Draco. "I mean, I already hated myself. I thought I was going to watch you bleed out and I was just... Petrified with fear. I didn't even try to help you Draco I was so fucking scared that I had just killed you. I... I had never seen you cry before." Harry said lightly. "Hermione called me a monster. She said I was like Voldemort after I explained what happened."
"No but... I used a Dark Curse." Harry said. "She had asked me what kind of spells you were throwing and she... She went ballistic after I listed them off.
"I've been coming here since year one. I've never seen you up here." Draco said. Harry scratched the back of his neck.
It was used mainly for storage now but from one of the windows, you could see out across all of Hogwarts and that's what Harry liked about it. It was a nice place to sit, get some fresh air and just think about life. It's a place Harry had told nobody about. Not Hermione or Ron and not even Ginny. It was a place that was all his own, a place where he could get away from everyone. It had been a place he had found late one night a long time ago when he couldn't sleep. It might just be his favorite room in the entire castle.
"Come on mate, let's get out of here. It's fucking freezing." Ron said, rubbing Hermione's back lightly. Harry nodded and the three friends turned to leave. But Hermione paused.
"What are you worrin' about now?" Harry asked from across the table. Draco looked up from his still blank parchment paper.
"I'm defending nobody." Harry said, half glaring at Blaise. Harry's eyes slid to Draco who had a vacant look on his face. Why wasn't
a liar." Draco said. Harry pursed his lips and made a slight sweeping motion with his wand. Draco picked his arms off the table and began to gather his things. "Just... go wait for me in our tower. I'll be right there."
"You've been mortal enemies for years now Harry." Ron snapped, making Harry lose his smile. "And now you're what? Friends? Bloody mates?"
"Am I interrupting something boys?" Professor Potswell said from the front of the room. Everyone turned to look at Harry and Draco. If the rest of the students knew better, they would have assumed that Draco was turning red with embarrassment, not anger. But knowing who Draco and Harry are and how they act around one another, everyone simply assumed, that a fight was about to break out between the two boys.
at George sometimes! I don't know how he does it, how he looks in the mirror and just..." Ron shook his head, wiping at his tears angrily.
"Not a bad thing?" Ron demanded, standing and glaring at his friends. "He's an asshole. All of them are assholes." He said through his teeth. Ron had been more... Volatile as of late. Ginny was constantly sending owls out to their parents about his behavior and everyone kept urging him to talk to someone, anyone about how he was feeling but Ron always... Shut down.
"I'm glad you are." Harry said. "The Chosen one and his arch-nemesis deserve a happy ending after all right?" Draco laughed.
"Well good, now we can set you up with someone that isn't my sister." Hermione threw a pillow at Ron. "What! I can't talk to Harry about girls if he's dating my sister. That's gross." Ron said.
Harry and sometimes the feeling of hope is stronger than the feeling of loyalty." Harry said nothing and it made Draco uncomfortable. Harry slowly held his hand out to Draco. He arched an eyebrow at Harry confused before he realized what the Chosen One wanted. Harry wanted to shake Draco's hand. Draco's hand was warmer than Harry expected and it was also very soft. Meanwhile, Draco was off put by the scars on Harry's knuckles and how unnaturally cold his hand was in his own. Draco squeezed Harry's hand lightly as they shook hands.
with excitement." Draco heard Harry snicker. Has it always been this easy to make Harry laugh? Draco couldn't tell. He had never really tried to make Harry laugh. He had always just tried to make him mad.
"Draco, I wouldn't stay with you for months if you were just a warm body. I wouldn't move in with someone if all I wanted to do was shag them." Harry said, going back to the kitchen.
"Nothing." Harry said quickly. "I mean... We just started talking one night. Apparently we both have the same... Hiding place. That's where I go every night... To see them." Ron grabbed his shoulder and shook him lightly.
"I'm gay Harry." Draco said. Harry's arms fell to his sides and he looked over at Draco with surprise. "Oh don't look so surprised. " Draco said nervously, waving away the dumb look on Harry's face.
"Can I see your scars?" Draco's eyebrows arched up slightly in surprise. That wasn't what he thought Harry would say.
As most dreams though, this one melted away completely into nothingness and the next thing Draco knew, he was waking up to someone kissing his cheek and saying, "Hey I know you're barely awake but I gotta run babe." Draco wanted to tell Harry to shut up, to come back to bed. His side of the mattress was already going cold. Harry chuckled which led Draco to believe he had said some sort of coherent sentence. "I know. I'm sorry but I gotta go back to the Gryffindor tower and pretend I've been there all night."
"I'm not obsessed with him. He's a prat." Draco said in a calm voice. Pansy snorted, rolling her eyes a little. Blaise didn't even look at her.
"Up until I was nine, I had a stuffed sock monkey that Dudley didn't want and he was called Mr. Monk."
"I mean if that's not what..." Harry cut him off with a kiss. Draco could still feel the tears on his face.
"One good Slytherin out of the fucking lot of you? Should I be impressed?" Ron said. Pansy screamed and looked like she was ready to throw herself at Ron and tear him to ribbons. The only thing that stopped her from doing so was Blaise who had stood quietly, grabbed her around the waist and kept her in place.
"I thought she had too. Apparently, she's been dating my soon to be step father since last year." He laughed a little darkly. "That's longer than most of the men she's been with." Pansy and Draco didn't know what to say and Blaise's smile fell.
"There's no need to shout Potter." Harry clenched his jaw. "Look, all I'm saying is..." Pansy sighed. "I was the first one Draco told when he realized he was gay. It was while we were still dating so it kind of hurt but I got over it. I could tell he wasn't that into me." Harry huffed.
"Wouldn't you go too?" Luna said. "If your parents were crying and calling for you?" Neville looked away.
"You sure you don't want me to hold your hand while we walk?" Harry teased as they continued. Draco snorted out a laugh. The thought was tempting though.
"No but... I've had Voldemort breathing down my neck for years and... So have you so I'm sorry." Harry said. Draco rolled his eyes.
"Oh don't take her side." Draco said with a scoff. "I liked it better when you were neutral about everything." Draco said with a shake of his head. Blaise smirked.
Hermione and Ron were frantic. After Harry's dramatic declaration about him and Draco, how Draco was still cursed, how Harry wanted to die, the two had gone off to search for their friend but had come up empty handed. The two of them still couldn't wrap their heads around... Everything.
"What more is there to say? You can't lie to me Draco. I know you haven't fully forgiven me. Why else wouldn't you want to tell me?" Draco said nothing. "Do you have nightmares about me?" Draco said nothing. Harry put on his cloak.
"Oh no you won't. We're adopting Harry whether you like it or not." Harry was grinning at him madly.
"We'll be right there." Ginny said with a small smile. Ron nodded and turned away from his sister and best friend, heading downstairs without them. When he left, Harry sighed heavily.
"I... I don't know. It's weird hearing you say sorry to me. It's weird feeling like you pity me." Harry said. Draco half shook his head, smirking a little.
"It is though. She knew I was alive Draco. She knew that once Voldemort realized she lied, she might be killed but she had hope that she would see you again. She risked everything for you. I can't even imagine what she would have done if I didn't know you were okay." Draco looked baffled.
was if he got even just one kiss from you. One kiss and he felt that... All of his troubles would melt away." The tension in Harry's shoulders fell and the expression on his face became one of bewilderment.
"Feeling better?" Harry said. Draco suddenly realized they were still touching. Harry's hand was on his shoulder and Draco was holding Harry's arm in a death grip. Draco let go of him and Harry dropped his hand. Harry wasn't sure why he was breathing so hard or why it felt like butterflies were swarming his stomach. It had to just be nerves right. He thought to himself as he stared up at Draco's cloudy grey eyes.
"Ron, you're drunk." Harry said, standing and walking towards his friends. "Let's go." Harry grabbed his arm but Ron just glared at him.
than us." Ron said with a scowl. "Why did they even come back? Why did McGonagall allow this?" Nobody had any good answers. "The Slytherins are bad.
"That would be funny to see." Harry whispered to Draco, sending a shiver down his spine. God, Harry hadn't even really said anything and he had Draco squirming.
"No I think you look pretty cute when you orgasm too." Draco shoved Harry's shoulder as the dark haired boy laughed, his tea sloshing out of the cup a little. "Hey, this rug is nice Draco."
"No, I just came up here to think." Harry said. Draco flicked the ashes of his cigarette out the window and arched one eyebrow at Harry.
"Jesus Ron!" Harry shouted at him in a whisper. "Are you trying to scare me to death?" Ron frowned slightly.
kissing Draco. It felt way different than kissing Ginny but a good different. Draco tried not to kiss Harry back but her couldn't stop himself.  As Harry put his left hand up to Draco's face, Draco put his arms around Harry's waist, under his stupid Gryffindor robe. When the two of them finally broke apart the first words out of Draco's mouth were,
“Sober as a child. Here, mind if I…?” he pointed his wand at Harry inquisitively. Harry nodded, so Draco cast the sobriety spell. The world clicked into clarity, except where Harry needed it, because when he looked at Draco all he could feel was a desperate, heady longing, that paid no heed to reason.
“I’m perfectly happy with my work, thanks,” said Harry, although he wasn’t happy at all, with anything, really.
“Look, between you and me, Harry, your house is the only place where he’ll be safe. Anyone else will turn him over to the Department. I won’t deny that, from the Department’s point of view, Draco surviving that mission is an unexpected inconvenience.”
“I crossed it off because it was stupid,” said Draco. “Words are cheap. It’s much better to show that sort of thing. Merlin, can we change the subject?”
It wasn’t exactly that Draco was anti-wallowing. Frankly, he was quite pro-wallowing. But he knew without a doubt that there would come moments when he would be unable to keep his spirits up, and so it was imperative not to give in until then.
“Thanks. I had a bit of help with it.” Harry paused. “I’ve been spending a lot of time with Draco Malfoy.”
Blaise looked away. Draco reflected that expensive cigarettes really did taste better than cheap ones.
“No, because she’s right. I hate it, but she’s right. It’s too much angst and talk, not enough action. But I
Draco crawled over to him, straddled his lap. Harry’s hands went to Draco’s hips and eased him down. He looked up into Draco’s face, and there was nothing casual about this, there couldn’t be, and he knew Draco could see that too. He was frowning, looking rather frightened, and he bit his lower lip before lowering his face to Harry’s.
“Are you… are you seriously telling me… that house elves can apparate in and out of Hogwarts?” he asked her.
“No, I know. Just… these people who keep attacking him… do you know who they are? He always insists we can’t tell the police, but after last spring…”
“I don’t usually like these things,” said Potter, looking around at the other guests. He seemed a little nervous, which Draco found unnerving. “Everyone always expects me to be interesting.”
It was getting harder to do that. To turn off his thoughts. Something was thawing, and as the numbness ebbed away, pain came to replace it. He knew it was because of Harry. Or Ginny. Both, probably. And Hermione had healed the sting on his face so quickly that afternoon, as if she didn’t want him to be in pain a second longer than he had to be…
He left before Potter could point his wand at him again, went home, and had a little panic. Just a little one.
“Scared of you? No, why would you say that?” said Blaise. His eyes darted around the room. He wasn’t a good liar, although he seemed like someone who would be.
Harry could hardly concentrate at work that day. His mind strayed to Draco’s hitched breath, his pliant fingers, the way he had said
It was a frustrating way to be deliriously happy. Harry knew love didn’t stay at this pitch forever, that one day it would no longer feel like a terrible ordeal to go to bed without Draco, but for now it was dreadful and perfect at once.
He walked out of the office that evening feeling strangely blank. He did not apparate home. He simply wandered out of Wizarding London into muggle London, letting his feet guide him. His mind was empty.
“No, no, Malfoy, that… I overheard you and Pansy… she said that you should date me to improve your social standing…I was
Teddy scrunched up his face. Draco lay on the sofa and Teddy knelt on the floor beside him. Although there had definitely been an uptick in boringness since he told Andromeda about the curse (he kept catching her looking at him, misty-eyed), there were some advantages. He had stopped making himself go on excursions with Teddy. It was hard enough to leave his bed nowadays. His whole body felt heavy as lead.
“Don’t you dare move out,” said Pansy. “Oh, fucking fuck, Draco. I snagged my tights climbing over that gate.”
It was at that moment, that moment there, when all his friends and all of Harry’s friends lifted their glasses and toasted them, that Draco had tasted happiness for the first time. Full, true happiness. He had looked at his life and been satisfied.
Harry didn’t remark on it when Draco called Ron and Hermione by their first names. He never did it to their faces. It made Harry want to kiss Draco’s head off, but so did everything.
“If you ask me, Harry, this crush has gone on a bit too long. I think you ought to ask someone else out. You know you’re wasting your time with Malfoy.”
“What I’m getting at,” said Harry, “is that you should think of yourself more as a housemate, than a house guest. You don’t need to be so
The package, it transpired, was recurring. Every three weeks, Malfoy sent him a bottle of potion, with a short note asking Harry to let him know if he had any questions.
“It’s done,” he called out to Draco. Draco turned around and limped back to them without lifting his eyes from his feet. When he reached Harry, he finally looked at the headstone.
The first day, Draco had come out of Arithmancy only to be immediately accosted by the Gryffindor seeker, Steven Hodges, who had dragged him into the nearest bathroom and kicked the shit out of him. Draco had tried to hit back, but he was no match for him, not when he couldn't use magic. Draco had been so sure Harry would come and stop it, but he hadn’t. He forgot about Draco, as if Draco were a chore he hadn’t fancied doing, anyway.
“Let me give you his number,” said Harry. “Don’t reach out until I’ve checked it’s okay with him, though.”
“Order! Order! Mr. Potter, a prisoner’s bond would ensure that Mr. Malfoy would have to obey any instructions you gave him. He would also not be able to stray further from you than fifteen metres without your express permission. He would be banned from performing magic. You would, in essence, become his jailer.”
“It’s the least I can do,” he said. “I’ll send Scorpius via floo tomorrow morning at ten. He’ll need to change some muggle money into Galleons. Do they let you into Gringotts, after everything?”
“Of course it bothers me. It’s a bloody pain having to cast glamours all over the house to make it look as if we have electricity. And washing up by hand. I don’t know how they do it. No house elves, even.”
Draco stopped, too. They looked at each other in the slanting moonlight. There was always something vitalising about Potter’s attention; it was half the reason Draco had spent his whole life antagonising him. But Potter didn’t seem hostile, now. He seemed cautious.
“I know,” said Hermione, looking suddenly haughty. “I’ve thought of that. I’ve put it around that we’re having an affair.”
“I’m just saying. I’m not the same, angry, fucked up teenager I was when I said all those things to you. My opinions have changed, and—”
Chief was found guilty of conspiring to plant evidence less than a week after Draco went to Azkaban. He was dismissed with a warning, and Hermione was promoted to Executive Head of Recruits. It was obvious she would be Chief of the Department by the time she was thirty-five.
They had sex again, then fell asleep, and when Draco woke up, it was five in the morning. He kissed Harry awake.
Scorpius dragged his feet all the way to Florian’s, and when they arrived he looked determinedly at the floor.
He couldn’t find Ron or Hermione or Ginny. Instead, he found what appeared to be an impromptu court room. On one side of the great hall were half a dozen Death Eaters, heavily bound and guarded. On the other, a pile of bodies, including that of Lucius Malfoy. The crowd bayed murderously for revenge. Mundungus Fletcher, turned Supreme Judge, had his wand pointed at Draco Malfoy.
“I think they’re wonderful,” said Cassie reverently. “Can you imagine if Sasha’s dad saw you? He’d probably faint.”
,” said Harry, trying to get away. But it was no use, and anyway, the fact that they were freezing barely weighed against the fact that they were
“That was good, wasn’t it?” said Astoria. She leaned forward and kissed him gently on the lips. Draco’s eyes snapped open.
“Your father was killed as well,” said the judge, with what Harry thought was a little too much enthusiasm for the truth. “They are both dead. You were
“Go on,” said Harry. “Then I referenced the Death Eaters and probably confirmed all your worst fears.”
“Let’s agree never to talk about it. You won’t have to deal with my embarrassing lack of decorum again.”
Draco got out his wallet. He had a fifty pound note and a twenty pound note. He gave them both to Seven, who beamed.
“Please. Nothing you tell a Slytherin is in confidence,” said Harry. “Not unless explicitly stated.”
“…I just blubbed and blubbed. Everyone stared. So embarrassing, you know? But never mind. It’s important to be cheerful.”
“It’s always been Cassie and me vs. the world,” he said, finally. “Allies, and enemies. I suspect she doesn’t know where to place you.” He brushed down his robes. “If you like me, you’re an ally. If not, you’re an enemy. But she doesn’t want you to be an enemy. So she feels conflicted.”
“Yeah,” said Lamorak. “Listen, maybe you should go on a date with Draco. See if there’s anything there.”
He was furious, actually. More angry than he had been the summer after fourth year, when Ron and Hermione had been together, in the loop, while he was stuck in Privet Drive, isolated, unimportant. Everyone else had got their happy ending, while, Harry, who had died in the war, had nothing.
Who did you share secrets with? People you trusted, surely. How betrayed would Harry feel, when he realised that Draco wasn’t worthy of that trust?
“It’s been almost a year,” said Hermione. “In wizard law, that’s when he can be declared legally dead.”
was there, and earnestly entreated Harry to come visit his new lake house in Bulgaria any time Harry liked.
“What?” asked Potter. Black eyes with a sliver of green around the edge. His hair looked as it always did; perennial sex hair, it was truly enviable. The jar of lube came whistling into the room, and Potter caught it, plucked it out of the air like it was nothing.
“Oh, they’ll live forever, like those starving lab rats who live three times longer than normal,” said Timothy.
“God, I dreamt you were in bed with me the other night, and I turned over to touch you and the bed was empty—”
The more they hurt him, the more he found himself touching Harry. The fact was, Draco missed his mother. He missed being loved. When he put his head in Harry’s lap and Harry stroked his hair, he could close his eyes and imagine a world where he hadn’t made his mistakes yet, and everything was still possible.
Malfoy turned back into a human a few hours later. When he came to, he was asleep in Ron’s lap. Ron poked him in the ear.
“Of course it is!” Scorpius paused, looking suddenly serious. “You will take care of him, won’t you?”
“It feels better without the bond,” said Harry. “I hated accidentally ordering you around all the time.”
“She won’t do it again,” said Draco. “She was just a bit upset. Can you get her back to Pansy’s safely?”
Ginny’s humour grew nastier. Pansy’s grew softer. Hermione stopped moisturising her hands and the skin on her knuckles went ashy. Ron worked late every night and went into the office on weekends. Mrs. Weasley kept crying on Draco’s shoulder at Sunday lunch. Luna gave him a strange feathery contraption “to help him communicate with people beyond the veil”. Greg left badly-baked cupcakes on his doorstep. Blaise not-very-subtly implied that he would be happy to let Draco fuck him if he got too lonely.
“Yeah. Er. There’s not really a good way to say this.” He took a deep breath. “I think we should get married.”
. He realised that it was exactly what he had been doing, since Hogwarts: trying desperately to be happy.
“But you married me anyway? That’s fucked up,” said Harry. And another note in the symphony of pain was that Draco
Draco’s therapist said he could only control himself, that he could only do his best. Draco thought his therapist wasn’t all that intelligent. He only went because Adelaide refused to go to hers if he wasn’t also seeing someone.
to see him, so he made sure Dean came to Draco’s shows every once in a while. Dean and Draco were quiet around each other; wistful.
It was so easy, just to call Draco when he got home, and put him on speaker phone, and amble around his kitchen getting dinner, chatting about absolutely nothing.
“It was just that: a reaction. It wasn’t how I actually felt, when I thought about it. I was just… surprised. I mean, it doesn’t excuse it, but suddenly I could only see you as you were at school, not as you really are—”
“Really?” Blaise looked suddenly earnest. It was so like Draco that Harry startled. The abrupt dropping of the veil, the flickering between laconic charm and sincerity— it was like a glimpse into a parallel universe. Blaise was who Draco might have been, if he hadn’t been a Death Eater. Confident. Well-dressed. Hitting on Harry in a wizarding bar.
The rehab facility was very clean and very new. The teenagers smoking in the courtyard looked Adelaide up and down with mild curiosity. Her face closed. Draco wished, sometimes, that she hadn’t become beautiful until she was grown.
. To me, you’re only ever going be the person who used to give Draco panic attacks after you fucked him.”
“Thank you,” said Draco, taking it. “That was very considerate. Next, ah. Well, are you familiar with burlesque?”
, his mother had said, all those years ago. Now here was Ginny, saying more or less the same thing. It was an aching sort of joy, and Draco closed his eyes, trying not to smile.
Harry’s heart twisted with reluctant sympathy that was chased immediately by suspicion. Maybe Malfoy was doing this so Harry would pity him.
She leant gently into his body and Harry was seized by a startlingly strong desire to embrace her. She had stepped into the fireplace before he could consider this further, however. He followed her into the hearth.
“Oh,” said Draco, going pink. He opened the box and stared. Harry hadn’t spent all that long picking it out that morning—he hadn’t had to. It had jumped out at him. It was a glittering emerald set in buttery yellow gold.
Harry had a shower. He stared at his unmade bed for a bit. He got dressed. He made a fresh cup of tea, and drank it. He wished Timothy would come home for lunch early. He wished Draco was in his bed. He wished he was wherever Draco was.
“Because no one does,” said Draco lightly. “I told you. Us vs. them. There’s Blaise and Pansy, who treat me like a person, and make Cassie feel safe, and then there are all the people who spit at me in the street. Which sort do you think Cassie prefers? Can’t you see how distressing it is for her to know that you revile the person she trusts most? She’s too young and loyal to understand
Draco stared at him in astonishment. Potter wasn’t looking at him properly. He was running his quick hands through his thick, dark hair. It made Draco want to
“He likes you because he can help you,” she said. “And Ron told me what you said at his trial; you called him
“It was almost impossible not to admire you during the war,” said Draco, his gaze fixed somewhere around Harry’s right ear. “You were so bold, and no one could catch you, and it was obvious that you were powerful enough to frighten the Dark Lord—sorry, I
“This was hard for you,” said Harry, still moving his hand over Draco’s body. “I think it was brave.”
Malfoy lay down on his wire cot. Harry wanted to sit beside him, but he didn’t know Malfoy anymore. He’d never known him, really.
He went about his search without much interest. His mind was always on other things. The war, mainly, but underneath it all ran that hideous, unstable loneliness that had surfaced when Timothy kissed him.
He peered down at the Cloisters. He could see just where he would land, on the cobbles near the flower patch Potter had made. The flowers never drooped, even now that frost came every morning and coated them with crisp ice crystals.
Harry decided against summarising the conversation he’d had with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, in which he had found himself earnestly listing all the things he liked about Draco until Ron put a hand on his arm and said “I think they’ve got it, mate.”
He always woke up with the sun and went back to his own bed. They never spoke about it, not even when they lay in bed. Instead, they talked about quidditch, or they bitched about Ron and Hermione.
It was a horrible break up. He had always known it would be. Ginny cried. Harry cried. Harry begged Ginny to promise to stay his friend. Ginny said she needed space. Ginny implied that Harry had been leading her on. Harry tried to explain that if anything, he had been leading
The chocolate warded away the clinging, icy misery for almost twenty minutes. As he ate, he remembered that he would get out one day, and there would be trees, and sunrises, and wide open skies, even if there was nothing else. He thought, then, of Potter’s strong reaction to Dementors in school. He wondered if Potter had known what effect the chocolate would have. It was kind of Potter, if so—it was kind either way.
“Surely that was obvious?” frowned Hermione. “It was obvious to me he had changed, because he was trying to include me in his humour, rather than using it as a weapon against me.”
Harry slumped in his chair, bowled over by Hermione’s argument. He wanted to believe it so badly that it was very difficult to know whether it was actually, rationally convincing or not.
“Course he is,” said Ron, with his mouth full. Draco had stopped sitting with them at meals, now that he and Astoria had made up. “He’s like you and me, combined.”
Adelaide took off her school blazer, sank into the seat opposite him, and rummaged around in her rucksack for her wand.
Distantly, Draco thought of the way Harry had gently stroked his Mark, as if it was just ordinary skin. He hadn’t hesitated, either. He had touched Draco quickly and easily, as if Draco were clean.
Harry bought Malfoy’s share of the house, and asked Hermione to ask Malfoy what he wanted to do about the furniture. He had no idea where Malfoy was staying.
“Potter, I owe you about a million years worth of favours. The least I can do is find someone for you to fuck.”
I wanted, why can’t you see… oh, fucking hell, I should never have…I can’t…you’re breaking my heart…”
Draco turned away and went to stand by his desk, his hand resting on a small pile of Penguin Classics.
Harry should have known Malfoy wouldn’t give up on his plan so easily. He was on his way to the library when Malfoy ducked out of a an alcove and dragged him behind the statue of Borg the Brainless.
They went to the manor on a Sunday afternoon, around teatime. Harry asked Draco for advice on what to wear, and Draco was strangely unforthcoming.
“Promised Scorpius I’d check on you once a week,” he said, because it was an appropriate thing to say and that was what Harry wanted to be; appropriate.
Harry paused, his quill in the air. He couldn’t stop thinking about Malfoy’s strange, clipped speech from the night before, when he’d practically told Harry that Scorpius would be better off if Malfoy were dead.
Draco closed his eyes and listened. Harry told him about the miracle of getting to Hogwarts. About the troll in the bathroom, and becoming friends with Hermione. About seeing the Dark Lord drinking unicorn blood in the forest, about the philosopher’s stone.
The second time he ran away was when he realised that Tertius’ little anger problem was going to kill either him or Adelaide, and that the only question was who would go first. This time, there could have been no doubt that Draco had done a runner: he stayed away for two nights, sleeping on benches and trying to figure out what to do. He ended up at a Muggle homeless shelter, but he didn’t understand any of the questions they asked him, things like Did he have a National Insurance Number? and Was he registered with a GP?
“No, really. He’s handsome, funny, well-dressed. Just the right amount of bad. Lives in the real world with you.” Draco was looking at him intently, but again, he didn’t seem hurt or closed off. He seemed… concerned. “I’m serious. You could do worse. If anyone could make you happy, he could.”
“Fool! Dost thou mistake me deliberately? ’Tis I who am thankless, guilty wretch that I am, for my father did wish only one thing of me—”
“I know what you’re thinking, and it’s not like that,” said Timothy. “I don’t know what you think you saw, but he’s never forced—I’m very
He could tell Tertius was still upset about whatever had happened with the drop, because he didn’t heal Draco for three days, just nursed him, wand in pocket, as if he were cleaning up after some faceless monster who had blacked Draco’s eyes and broken his collarbone, not himself.
. He had seemed perfectly unsurprised to see Harry, had smiled as if there was nothing for them to do but start afresh.
“What if you—” L stopped, frustrated. Harry tried to hold him. L peeled away. He opened his mouth to say something, but was clearly prevented by the spell. “Fuck,” he said, finally. “Honestly, fuck this!”
Scorpius nodded, cast one more bald look of misery at his father, then wiped his face clean of emotion.
“That was mental, with—oh!” said Ron, coming into the dorm with Dean and Seamus. “Are you two shagging, then?”
“So, I don’t know, I had heard about it somewhere, I don’t even remember where. And I was drunk in my bedroom. And I thought, fuck it.”
“You seem well,” Harry told Pansy, when Blaise went to talk to Mipsy about dinner. “Compared to the last time I saw you.”
not to be a sore loser. I don’t fancy nursing a black eye all week because  losing your queen made you feel emasculated.”
“Now that he knows you’re sick, won’t Potter notice that Lamorak has all the same symptoms?” asked Astoria.
“There aren’t enough hours in the day,” said Lamorak. He put his head between his wrists and pressed. “Sorry. Ahhh. Okay, I’m back.”
“Do you have many friends?” asked Draco. He had been quiet and preoccupied all session, and they hadn’t done anything sexual yet. Actually, they’d been having sex less and less, which made Harry feel all sorts of things. Principally, it made him feel as if he was getting through to the hidden parts of Draco. Draco had a pronounced tendency to deflect using sex. The idea that Draco was allowing Harry in beneath his armour made Harry feel a strange, guilty sort of rapture.
“No,” said Draco, sinking into the couch and idly plucking at the stupid plastic plant on the side table. “No, obviously it doesn’t feel as if he likes me. It feels as if he despises me.”
“They weren’t self-pitying,” said Harry, who was struggling to speak. “They were…” He had tears in his throat. He swallowed them down.
“She’s probably worried about tomorrow,” said Draco. He looked nervous himself. He was chewing on the inside of his cheek, and his fingers were red from where he had gnawed at the nails.
“Anyway, that’s all,” said Draco. He turned sharply on his heel and walked back down the garden path. Harry watched him go, completely baffled.
“That fucking afternoon you came back to my office to try on the cat collar and you wanted me to kiss you… didn’t you.”
“Dumbledore offered to help you, and you turned him down,” said Harry coldly. Something churned in his stomach at Malfoy’s crushed expression. It was reassuring to feel something that wasn’t anger for once, even though it was equally unpleasant. Guilt? Was it guilt? But Harry didn’t owe Draco anything, certainly didn’t owe him help rehabilitating his reputation. He didn’t even know if Malfoy had changed since the war.
A week went by before Harry understood what Draco had told him, that day at lunch. A week of losing whole hours (he would startle and realise he had been staring unseeingly at something and wasn’t sure how long it had been), of going to the bathroom just to gasp, of Colin Creevey begging Harry not to leave in his dreams. One day, he was visited by such a brutal and nameless rage that he could barely keep his teeth from chattering as he handed his mended cursed objects to the archives. When he got home, he swept all the books from the shelves, threw half of them in the fire—for no reason, what had the
"We don't know that. But what we do know is that we would do anything for each other. I don't want you to do
"Potions." Harry and Draco said at the same time, making Ron rolls his eyes. What the fuck was happening? They were talking in sync now? Ron's hands shook slightly. Draco wasn't surprised to smell smoke, Ron's anger coupled with his magical power was probably sparking something nearby.
"You think I haven't already checked?" Draco said, finally looking Hermione in the eye. "I've checked and
A flash of movement caught Harry's eye. He lifted his wand higher and saw a streak of blonde hair and dark robes flit around a corner not far in front of him. Harry cocked his head. Did he just see Malfoy? Harry ran down the hall after the boy and reached the end of the corridor just in time to see that same person, quickly move around the corner on Harry's left. Harry almost wanted to shout at them, call out Draco's name but.. If it wasn't Draco then he would feel a little weird.
"You mean you don't remember?" Draco said, his voice void of all emotion. "Sixth year. Our fight in the bathroom." Harry cringed.
"I have other friends." Harry said indignantly. "All you have is Parkinson and Zabini." Draco's arm tightened around Harry's middle.
hated him for laughing at me." There was a collective gasp around the room. The color completely drained from Ron's face.
"I'll say it forever if I have too." Harry said. Draco's heart skipped a beat in his chest and Harry watched him turn bright red.
"I like babe better." Harry said, going to sit back down and picking his teacup up. Draco rolled his eyes, blushing the whole time.
But Draco knows that she didn't. Harry never even met his mother. Harry is eying him quizzically. Draco clears his throat. "Anyways, please leave."
Draco glanced over his shoulder at Harry whose hair hung messily over his glasses and in his eyes. He was wearing a gray jumper and brown trousers and his cheeks were red with cold and probably from anger. Draco usually notices when Harry is following him, the younger boy isn't very subtle after all but Draco had been so wrapped up in his own thoughts, he didn't even consider that Harry might be following him right now. "Hello Potter, fancy seeing you out." Harry wasn't in a joking mood though. He looked royally pissed off.
"Well, I'm taking it as a compliment." Draco picked himself up off the side of the wall and walked forward. "I'm a rubbish teacher."
With Draco absent from Hogwarts, Harry almost felt like there was a piece of him missing. The first week of classes was a complete disaster. Harry couldn't focus, let alone do his homework. Hermione, Ron, Luna, Neville, etc. were all obviously worried about him. everyone asking him if he was okay, if he was feeling alright. Harry always answered with, "Yeah, what could be wrong?" Nobody had figured out how to answer that yet and once they did, Harry knew he would have to find something else to say. He was glad his friends weren't trying to pry very much. He wouldn't know how to talk about his feelings even if they asked.
"Well... It's one of Hagrid's pets. He's a giant spider and he lives out in the forest. He tried to eat Ron and I once." Harry said. Draco put the cigarette to his lips thoughtfully.
"Put that away Potter. I'm not going to fight you." Hermione and Ron also had their wands out and Harry slowly realized that none of the Slytherins in front of them had theirs out. "We'll leave since that's clearly what you all want." Draco said. Ron's hands were shaking. "Pansy won't say it so I will. I'm sorry Ron, about your brother and about what she said. That was a horrible thing for her to say." Ron wouldn't look at Draco. He ground his teeth instead. Nobody said anything  else. Draco moved forward, towards the door. Harry stiffened, his grip on his wand tightening.
"Everything will be okay." Harry said softly. "Come here." Draco wasn't sure what Harry wanted until Harry pulled on his hand. He wanted them to be closer. Draco laid his head down on Harry's chest and wrapped one arm around him, feeling Harry wrap his arms securely around his back. "We're not going to have nightmares tonight." Harry said and he kept repeating it several times over and eventually, Draco fell asleep.
"Well fuck Ron! I was kind of trying to fucking deal with the fact that the only guy I've ever loved
"I have." Harry said indignantly, reaching up and running one hand through Draco's hair. It was so soft without the product in it. Harry liked it better like this. Draco's hands stilled slightly as he stared at the concentrated look on Harry's face. Draco could tell from constantly staring at his face, that Harry was trying to decide what to do. "I'm just shit at it." Harry said before he leaned in to kiss him again. Draco cupped Harry's face in his hands, shifting closer to him.
"I know but shut up." Harry sighed and wiped at the tears on his cheeks with her handkerchief. "I found out he still liked you... Not that long after the incident and when I asked him why he just... Shook his head and said,
"Never knew you liked taking it up the..." Dean put his hands over Seamus' mouth and smiled apologetically.
"Harry Potter." Draco said again. Harry looked back to Draco, trying not to smile. "Come. Here." But he didn't need to say that, Harry was already stepping over the bench, running one hand through his hair nervously.
"Well I don't like secrets." Ginny said, getting back to the matter at hand. "Tell us who you're seeing or else Harry Potter." She threatened. Harry laughed.
That night, in Draco's room as the two of them sat against the headboard for Draco's bed, Harry found himself fiddling with the loose strands of his boyfriend's hair as Draco leaned heavily against his side, reading a book. "Did you ever think that I had a thing for Cedric?" Draco groaned and sat up. Harry smiled a little as he looked at Draco.
"I wasn't ready." Draco rolled his eyes and walked forward. Harry was smirking at him. Draco clenched his jaw and muttered an undoing spell under his breath, tapping Harry's hand with his wand. Harry immediately regained use of his hand. He rubbed his wrist with his left hand, the blood rushing back to his fingers.
"Something more magical than it really was. I guess I've been hyped up too much by Rita Skeeter." Harry said. Ginny snickered and Harry smiled at her lightly.
you. You're still in pain. You said this is going to happen for the rest of your goddamn life." Harry said.
"Don't leave." Draco finally said, sitting up and frowning at Harry. His hair was even messier from sleep and his eyes were barely open. Harry thought he looked completely adorable as he pouted.
It seemed like Harry and Draco were moving in opposite directions as of late. Not that that was necessarily a bad thing but... They did miss one another and they weren't exactly not talking to one another, they just weren't visiting the tower at all the past couple of nights. Draco still had nightmares, as did Harry, but they were a little less frequent and anyways, Draco said their late night's out together was causing him to fall behind in classes. Harry hadn't noticed Draco lagging in any areas but he decided not to argue with Draco.
"You touch me again and I'll tear off your arm and beat you with it and when the Headmistress tries to expel me, I'll tell you that you were just
"I guess she had hope in me too Draco." Draco looked up at Harry who was smiling wider than Draco anticipated. Draco slowly found himself smiling back.
"Don't I always?" Harry murmured against Draco's skin. How was he always so warm? It was early December. Draco's skin should have been just as icy as Harry's but it wasn't. How could someone as pale as Draco retain so much heat? That's something that always bothering Ginny.
"I... I don't know how did it work with... Other guys?" Harry asked sheepishly, blushed red. He didn't like thinking about Draco with other people. Draco shrugged.
"Hey, it's fine." Harry said in a soft voice, reaching across and taking Draco's hand. "I hope you're not mad she saved me." Harry said with a cheeky grin. Draco scoffed.
"Want to hang out tonight?" Harry said. Draco almost laughed out loud and then he looked over at Harry and realized the dark haired boy was serious. Draco frowned as he stared at the lighting shaped mark on Harry's forehead. It was just visible through his bangs. It started at the root of his hair and jaggedly fell down toward his eyebrow. The scar was pale in comparison to Harry's skin and it marred what was actually...
"Liar. You have 0 intentions of finding another tower." Draco said, turning away from Harry to look back out the window again.
"I won't leave then." Harry said softly. "But if Blaise is going to find out, we might as well tell everyone." Draco snorted.
"Someone is eventually going to see Potter, especially if you keep trying to kiss me in places that aren't our goddamn tower." Draco siad. Harry currently had Draco pinned up against one of the hallways that led to the eighth year floor for Slytherins and his heart fluttered when he heard Draco say
me." Draco said, voice cold and hard. Harry couldn't believe this. He thought... He at least thought Draco might say it back but... This was the worst case scenario. Harry had wished he had prepared himself for this.
"My mum?" Draco said, confused. Harry nodded as Draco reached for the bottle of alcohol. He twisted off the cap with one hand and took a drink.
"Three Gryffindor boys." Draco said, his tone un-accusatory. "Apparently they're a bunch of troublemakers."
"If you wont talk to me..." Harry said, his voice quiet at first. "Then I'll be forced to talk louder and louder and-" Draco hushed him as students from the surrounding couple of tables looked over at them, confused. Harry frowned at Draco. "Talk to me Draco, please. This is just as bad as our first month back here."
"No. She felt my pulse and then she asked me if you were alive, if you were okay, and as far as I knew, you were so I said yes and she told everyone that I was dead." Harry said.
"Why not!" Harry said a bit too loudly, flabbergasted. Draco shook his head and turned back to face Harry.
"Would you have ever told me?" Harry asked. Draco said nothing and Harry knew that meant Draco had never really planned on telling Harry about it. Harry slowly backed away from Draco. "How can you even
"Yes." Harry said before Hermione could reply. "I don't think I deserve to be happy anymore after all I've done."
"I guess I still don't really know. I mean... I haven't really figured out what I'm supposed to do now that Voldemort is dead and we're no longer fighting. I don't even have hobbies or anything Draco or aspirations or dreams. I have... Nothing." Draco frowned at his tea. "Actually that's a lie. I know one thing about myself which is the only reason I'm sure you asked this question." Draco looked up to see Harry smirking lightly. Draco blushed.
"Does it matter what I say?" Draco said. "You'll ask your question anyways. So just say it." Harry sighed and took a deep breath.
"We've known each other for years Draco. I can tell how you're feeling from a mile away probably." Harry said, finally looking up and adjusting his glasses. "You forget I know what your magic feels like when you're angry." Draco swallowed hard. "This isn't exactly a skin burning reaction but it's... Prickly. I know you're agitated." Draco scowled a little, hating how well Harry could read him (not that he couldn't do the same). "Just tell me what's wrong." Harry said.
"I would rather be here with you but yes, I was heading somewhere." Harry leaned in quickly and kissed Draco much to his surprise. Draco was about to say goodbye but Harry spoke first. "Hey, I love you Draco." Draco froze instantly and Harry cringed as Draco took a step down away from him.
"Hush up." Pansy said. Harry rolled his eyes. "Draco needed to let some things out and I don't know how we got on the subject exactly but..." Pansy paused. "Harry, Draco basically told me that he believed the only way he could ever be happy
"Yeah well... My scar hurt." Harry said, touching it on reflex. Draco almost reached out and did the same. He had always wondered how it would feel under his fingertips.
to be Pansy. Suddenly everyone was shouting, up out of their seats, practically rioting. Harry laughed, pulling back but Draco just leaned in again and kissed his lips lightly and then his cheeks and forehead.
"It's the only way they'll all find out at once. It might be a bit awkward at dinner but... At least we can get it out of the way right?" Harry sighed but nodded. Ginny was right, as usual.
"You know how I told my parents about... Myself. Last week." Harry nodded. "Well I've just been thinking about that and you and how... They wouldn't approve and neither would your parents if we're being honest. They'd probably want to kill me." Harry laughed.
"What did you want me to do Draco? Potter was staring at us. He's always staring at us. I'm trying to send a message." Pansy said. Draco shook his head.
"Well if it wasn't... The other thing." Ginny said with a grin. "Then it's gotta be that you've just kissed someone. You had that same dumb look on your face after we kissed the first time." Ginny said. Harry didn't know what to say.
"Did you make toothpaste?" Harry said, putting down the salamander arm and leaning over the cauldron. "Because that's what it smells like."
"R-right here? You want to do this in front of the whole school?" Harry said, voice still quiet, gesturing to the gaping audience in front of them.
"I said you weren't on Tuesday and you still came." Draco said. "Why would it being a Thursday night stop you?" Harry grinned.
Draco was frowning at Harry. "Don't make that face." Harry said, shaking his head. The two boys were currently standing in Draco's room and Harry was pacing in front of Draco. Harry had just told the older boy how he had come out to his friends and Draco was excited for him, happy even, that is until Harry suggested that Draco come out to his friends as well.
Pansy followed his gaze and when she saw Harry staring at them with a stupid look on his face, she flipped him off and stuck out her tongue. "Childish." Draco said. Pansy turned, tongue still out to flip Draco off too. Blaise looked up from his book and grinned.
guilty for the longest time because... I don't know. Even if Cedric and I hadn't agreed to touch the cup together.. If only
"I cant think of one." Draco rolled his eyes, spinning his wand between his fingers. "You're not gonna try and hex me right?" Draco didn't seem amused by Harry's comment.
"Well, when you do have kids Mr. Potter, please don't name one after your dad." Harry eyed her quizzically. "Another James Potter around here might just kill me." Harry snorted and started to laugh. He hadn't done that in quite some time.
"My parents. Sirius. Cedric. Mad Eye. Hedwig. Dobby. Dumbledore. Remus. Fred." Harry choked out. Ron had looked away.
"I'm busy." Harry said, taking Draco's hand again. If he didn't keep an eye on his boyfriend, he might just leave the party.
"Well why are we even discussing him? I'd rather not talk about Malfoy thanks. I wish he wasn't even here. He officially ruined my year when he showed up at breakfast last week." Ron grumbled.
At the end of class, Draco touched Harry's hand and nearly intertwined their fingers as Harry began to stand and put his things away. "What?" Harry hissed out. Draco pursed his lips, waiting for the rest of their classmates to disperse out the doors. "Your time is ticking." Mrs. Potswell was busying herself up front, not paying attention to them and as the last classmate headed out the door, Draco turned to Harry.
"It was after Neville's speech about courage and how our friends aren't really gone." Luna said. Neville blushed red. "You jumped up out of Hagrid's arms, fired a spell at Nagini and Draco ran back across the courtyard shouting your name."
"No it's... It's okay. I... I do think about him a lot. About what kind of life he would have now, you know?" Hermione nodded. Harry sighed and sat down. "Maybe I did like him." Harry said after a pause. "I remember being pissed that he was with Cho at the Yule Ball but... Maybe I was just jealous." Hermione smirked.
Draco was pacing up in the tower, wondering if Harry would still come tonight despite them sort of getting into a fight earlier today. It made Draco angry that he was thinking about Harry. Harry certainly wouldn't be thinking about him. The bastard was probably sound asleep in bed and didn't give two shits if... "Trying to burn a trench in the floor?" Harry said. Malfoy stopped abruptly and glanced over at Harry. He hoped his hands didn't shake as he pulled the cigarette out of his mouth.
"Yeah, that's what you think. I bet he's plotting our downfall as we speak." Ron grumbled. Harry sighed as Ron began to gather his things and leave the courtyard. Harry ran one hand through his dark hair and sighed. He knew telling his friends about his and Draco's... New found friendship would be hard but he didn't think it would be
"I know. I'm sorry for... Pushing. I was just happy and I wanted you to feel the same way." Harry said. Draco exhaled heavily and squeezed Harry's hand.
"What are you talking about Potter?" Draco said in that same listless tone he's been using on everyone. It unnerved Harry a little. Where was that spark, that fire that burned deep inside Draco? What had happened?
"I.. I..." Draco stammered out. "Harry can we..." Harry stood though and stepped away from Draco. Harry looked to Hermione and Ron and then at Draco who still hadn't stood.
"Actually he didn't see me take all of this. He only caught me stealing some pie. I had already packed everything else away." Draco said. Harry grinned at him.
"Ron..." Hermione said softly. Without another word though, Ron ran out of the room. Harry swallowed hard as he and Hermione chased after him.
"Not particularly. I mean... I won't really be around the kid much right? There's going to be eighteen years between us. I'm planning on getting as far away from this place as soon as I finish the year. Maybe I'll go to America." Draco had never heard Blaise say that before.
"Potter and Malfoy." Everyone in the room stiffened except for the Professor. She carried on down the list as if nothing had occurred. She had to know about the rivalry between the two boys right? She is a new Professor but there was no way that she shouldn't have known. Harry looked to Draco now who appeared bored with the idea instead of angry. When the professor told the class to sit with their new partners, Harry stood, gathered his things and walked to Draco's table. He sat down at the stool and Draco sighed.
"God, can't you ever just shut up?" Draco groaned as Harry kissed him heatedly, trying to tug Draco's shirt out of his pants where he had had it neatly tucked in. "Stop kissing me. I'm trying to argue with you." Draco said. Harry chuckled.
Harry could hear someone crying and he was trying to find out who it was. Harry had a free period and was on his way to the library but the moment he heard someone crying, he turned around and followed the sound. "It's going to be okay little one." Harry heard a soft voice say.
"No but that's not the point. Whose side are you both on. Are we defending Draco Malfoy? Malfoy? Seriously?" Ron said, looking to Harry.
"Finally. I've had enough of this ruddy fresh air." Pansy said, pushing back her short hair and pulling Blaise up to his feet. Blaise barely looked up as Pansy looped her arm through his. Draco slowly trailed after them as Pansy started to talk to Blaise, even though he might not be listening. They hadn't exactly told Draco but... He knew that his two friends were dating or at the very least, messing around with one another. It wasn't that hard to guess. They seemed to be attached at the hip now-a-days. Draco wished he and Harry could be the same.
"Did you want a bad grade?" Draco said, arching an eyebrow at him. Harry shook his head and pushed his glasses back up to the bridge of his nose. "Well shut up then Potter."
"Seriously Draco? I know you like me. You've liked me for a while haven't you?" Harry said. For the first time, Harry watched Draco blush red all the way to his ears. It was a good color on him.
