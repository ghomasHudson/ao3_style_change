Draco knew his face must have looked a picture because Potter laughed at his expression. He had called him Draco.
It was a while before he found Malfoy, tucked away at the top of the astronomy tower. His name paced around the tower, as if he were lost in thought.
“What?” Harry asked, glancing between the three of them.
Andromeda sighed. “I apologise Draco, that must have been an awful way to wake up.”
Draco feigned offence. “Give up?” he asked. “
“You never know,” Harry sniggered. “Maybe she’ll talk about the wonderfulness of Muggle toothbrushes.”
Remus then said that Voldemort had shown up, expecting to find Harry, but instead finding the Minister for Magic and Dumbledore. Harry took a few seconds to process what Remus had said, but knew that meant only one thing – the Ministry knew Voldemort was back.
Harry grinned. “Everything’s
There was an awkward silence that fell between the two as they skirted around directly talking about the kiss. The light faded from the sky and the stars began to appear, covering the grounds in a silver light.
The hat chuckled.
“Teddy would be more than happy to spend the holidays with you Harry,” Andromeda said, and Harry snapped his head up to look at her.
“’Course they do,” Ron exclaimed, and Harry looked ashamed, as if he had asked something he shouldn’t. “Fred and George are on the Gryffindor team, and my other brother, Charlie, he was their seeker, but he left last year.”

“And don’t forget to actually
“That didn’t mean ask him out on a lunch date,” she sighed. “Merlin Draco.”
“That’s a pawprint,” Draco replied, raising an eyebrow at Pansy.
“That

– darn…” he added, smiling sheepishly at Andromeda’s glare. “We need to go, otherwise Moody
“I’m no expert, but I know it’s a Celtic/Pagan festival that relates to Halloween,” Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck with a smile.
Draco rolled his eyes, smiling. “Your inner Slytherin is showing again,” he said, smiling when Harry laughed.
“Some people are easier to read,” Harry shrugged. “I’m glad though because I am starving, and I can’t eat and interview.”
Muttering a hello in return, Draco continued to stare at the fire, glancing at Cedric to see that he was also watching the fire.
“I’d like to keep that card.”
Harry smiled. “Me too,” he said, even though it had only been a week. “And just because you’re slightly taller than me,” he joked, but he didn’t make any effort to remove Draco’s head.
“I get it, Molly’s the same,” Harry shrugged. “You should have seen her reaction when George was late to Sunday dinner, I thought she was about to
“Don’t miss me too much,” Draco returned, watching Harry roll his eyes. Before he left, Draco could have sworn he saw Harry blush.
“I’ll – look, I’ll explain it to you some other time, I’m tired and I’d really like tell you about what just happened between me and Malfoy,” he stressed, hoping this would divert their attention for a bit, and it did.
” she spat, her voice tired and cold as she set her teacup down on the garden table with such force, it rocked slightly from side to side. “You can’t do this to him,” she said, and Harry knew she was right. Andromeda was rarely wrong.
idiot,” Parkinson sighed, and Zabini laughed. “But he’s quite taken with you Potter,” she said, and Harry felt himself blush.
After a moment of stunned silence, Sirius placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder, forcing him to stand still. Draco watched as Harry glowered, still, at the floor, but took deep breaths in the presence of his Godfather.
It had been almost twelve years since the war, and Harry had been an Auror for eight of those years. However, he had managed to stay hidden behind small cases relating to missing pets and shop break-ins. No one in the department questioned his ‘odd’ choice of cases, probably because he was
Harry nodded with such vigour, Draco was surprised his head didn’t roll off. “Exactly!” he exclaimed, sitting straight. “Like, he expects me to be completely okay with the fact he tried to isolate me for the
“Honestly, I expected you to hex me on sight, or punch me,” Draco said, rubbing his neck.
“I’ve not come to accuse you of anything!” Harry exclaimed, raising his hands in surrender. “I was wandering about and I was thirsty. I didn’t even know you were still in London and I certainly didn’t know you would be working in a teashop.”
Harry pulled away, using his thumb to wipe away the tears Draco had tried to hide. “I know,” he said, his expression sombre.
“Thinking I’m kind,” Draco smirked.
Draco waved his hand dismissively. “Then I must educate you on such matters,
“My names Cedric,” he said, his smile never-wavering. “I haven’t seen you around before, are you one of the first-years?” he asked.
Harry decided against discussing his run-ins with dragons throughout his teenage years. “A friend of mine works on a reserve in Romania, and he has a habit of bringing his work home with him,” Harry chuckled, remembering the time Charlie walked into the Burrow with three baby dragons and Molly almost fainted at the sight of them. Fred and George found it hilarious because Molly had been in the middle of reprimanding them but stopped mid-sentence and never got around to telling the twins to de-gnome the garden, as she had been hinting.
Scorpius looked contemplative for a moment. “Then Harry can stay with us,” he proposed, as if he was announcing the meaning of life.
Harry felt cold relieve corse through his veins as he heard that no one died. He was also glad to hear that the Order managed to arrest some of the Death Eater who were there. However, when Harry asked who had been arrested, Sirius went rigid and Remus looked somewhat pained. Remus asked if Draco was with him, and Harry watched as Draco stiffened too, looking sickly pale as Harry nodded slowly, piecing it together.
“I mean, his mother’s a Black, Sirius told me, so I’m not surprised he knows Kreacher exists.” Harry looked at Ron and Hermione, who looked at him expectantly. “But I don’t think it matters if he does,” Harry replied, seeing Ron raise his eyebrows in disbelief. Harry then told the two about the rest of the conversation, leaving out anything related to the kiss. “He seemed, reluctant, maybe scared, either way he was doing something he
that you already own
“Are you going to tell me what book you picked up earlier?” Harry asked, and Draco smiled.
“The only other person I’ve met who could feel residual magic was Regulus,” Sirius reminisced, smiling to himself. “My brother,” he clarified. “He would always mention if something felt wrong; sometimes the feeling would make him a little giddy.”
Harry nodded. “It’s, he hasn’t lived with me for years, and if he finds out I’m seeing someone who has a kid that I see
-----
Remus didn’t answer him. “Does anyone else know?”
“I don’t,” Harry said, and Draco could tell Harry wasn’t going to elaborate.
“Honestly, Potter,
“It truly is my biggest flaw,” Draco sighed with a sombre nod as he raised a hand to his chest.
He had been intercepted by people he didn’t know, asking if his father could verify Harry’s claims, as he was ‘
Harry kneeled in front of Scorpius. “I don’t think you’d forget her Scorp’, I haven’t forgotten my Mum, and I’m almost thirty,” Harry pointed out, hoping to ease Scorpius’ fears.
“I hope so, Harry.”
“Good,” Malfoy sniffed. “And don’t forget it Scarhead.”
“Is there anything wrong with my wand?” Draco asked, wondering what Potter felt the need to explain.
“Of course,” Draco grinned. “And I’m sure Auntie,” he nodded, looking at his things and then at Lupin. “Besides, someone has to make sure Harry doesn’t hurt himself,” he offered, shrugging as Lupin chuckled.
“It does,” Draco said, leaning his head against the window as he looked at Harry. “How long have you been awake?”
much harder their lessons would become in the next year. Pansy pulled a deck of exploding snap cards from her pocket, and they almost began to play a game, before Blaise reminded them that grass was flammable, and he didn’t want to risk spending the last few weeks of the term in detention for almost burning down the school.
Harry sighed. “He doesn’t need me Andie, he’s happier here. Besides, I’m not his father.”
“I think we’ve got a right to be,” Harry shrugged, linking his pinkie with Draco’s.
“Harry –“
“Andromeda’s grandson?” asked Draco, watching as Harry nodded with a grin.
Lucius Malfoy was among those arrested.
Harry rolled his eyes. “When have
“You know,” Harry said, smirking at Draco. “You might be better at charms, but there is one thing I’m good at,” he said, sitting up straight. He muttered an incantation under his breath and a stag burst forth from his wand.
With a spluttered laugh, Harry nodded. “I suppose it does,” he smiled, running a hand through his hair.
“In that case, I’ll have whatever you recommend,” Harry grinned, and Malfoy shook his head with a smile as he walked back towards the counter “Oh, and Malfoy?”
Returning to his book, Draco got lost in the pages.
, of course he was not OK. “I’m fine,” he said through gritted teeth.
Draco nodded, “Don’t sound so shocked Potter.”
“Daddy taught me what to do,” Scorpius said proudly. “He’s the best,” he said, and Harry noticed Draco’s expression soften as he pulled his son into a side hug, lightly kissing his temple.
“Don’t miss me too much Potter,” Draco replied with a playful smirk as they walked out the door.
“I have a Muggle deck of cards in my room, do you know any games?” Harry asked, already guiding the way.
close friends’.”
“That’s what Scorpius said.” Harry smiled at the bright sparkle in Draco’s eyes. “
!” Draco exclaimed, sitting up, bolt right.
They heard a soft thud in reply, followed by a quick, “I’m okay!”
“Believe me, I wanted to,” Malfoy said, sighing. “I’ve learnt to accept it though,” he added, looking out of the tower.
“OK, so
his Dad.”
He screamed; his scream was sharp like a dagger and jagged like a cliff side. It startled the surrounding wildlife, and it most definitely startled Draco.
Draco stiffened under Remus and Sirius’ amused gaze and smoothed his robes instinctively. “Hello Professor Lupin,” Draco said calmly, his expression devoid of any emotion. “Mr Black,” he nodded at Sirius who flinched.
There was nothing he could do.
“Excuse me?” he squeaked, still trying not to choke on the tea.
“You’re as good as,” she said, staring at Harry with an intensity as strong as Fiendfyre that chilled his bones. Harry had no idea she felt that way. He had assumed she didn’t want him to try and replace Remus or Tonks. She took a deep breath and smiled softly at Harry’s bewildered expression. “You practically raised the boy, and now you see him once a month. Do you know how difficult that is for him? – he really missed you Harry.”
Once Draco pulled himself from Harry’s arms, trying to assure Harry he was all right, but Harry knew he wasn't. Harry also knew it was not a subject that he should pry his way into and the best thing he could do for Draco in that moment was let him know he was there. Begrudgingly, Harry returned to Sirius and Remus, however he made sure to keep his fingers entwined with Draco’s.
if someone is around and I highly doubt anyone
Blinking multiple times, Harry forced himself to look away from Draco, and as he got past the fact that Draco had taken Harry’s suggestion of having emerald green hair, he managed to form a reply. “I’m sure we’ve already established somewhere that I’m not the brightest,” he joked, and heard Draco chuckle.
When they re-joined the other two in conversation, Draco leaned into Harry and smiled.
Harry nodded. “I mean, there wasn’t much they could say against me really, but there was this one woman,” he paused, and Draco could practically see the thoughts fly through his mind before he shook his head. “I was found not guilty, and now I’m exhausted,” Harry yawned.
Climbing out of bed with the blanket, Draco sat opposite Harry, their feet just touching. He wrapped the blanket tightly around himself.
” Pansy said, clearly also tired of asking him to go.
As Harry was sat at his desk, he found his mind drifting to Malfoy and his teashop. He thought about what tea Malfoy would get him to try next.
“No problem Harry.”
He shook his head. “Emerald green would suit you more,” Harry said, leaning in, the corners of his mouth pulling upwards when he noticed Malfoy turn a faint reddish hue. “Or maybe fir tree green.”
Despite the events that took place leading up the their O.W.L’s, Harry and Draco always found time to continue their late night meetings on the Astronomy Tower. Sometimes Draco would talk, sometimes Harry would talk, other times they would simply enjoy each other’s presence. Draco insisted some of these meetings be study sessions – not that Harry was complaining, Draco’s thinking face was adorable. Harry always made a trip to the kitchens before he arrived (especially after discovering Draco had a soft spot for anything sweet and knowing that if he brought along jam tarts or chocolate eclairs, Draco would be more inclined to help him with his potions essay’s).
Harry shook his head in disbelief. “But you’re, basically the
Teddy had started at Hogwarts this year, and never failed to send a letter to Harry, explaining the intricacies of modern life at Hogwarts (from what Teddy had said so far, Harry couldn’t see much of a difference from when he had attended).
? Everyone knows Harry and him hate each other – or, used to. If I wanted someone to get close to Harry and get information, Malfoy would not be the first to come to mind.”
they say?” Harry asked, concerned.
“Keeping up the Black traditions then?” Harry grinned.
“Did you know they can breathe fire over
It seemed like a wonderful place to escape. The rest of the house was dreary, grey and dark, but this library felt lighter, easy to breathe in – Draco knew this was partially due to the window, but he also could feel a comfort from the magic of the library itself.
“It’s only ghosts,” Pansy whispered to him, sounding annoyed. “They made it sound as if they’d been attacked,” she said, and Blaise nodded his head.
He hated it.
Sirius laughed, shaking his head. “I can’t say no, can I?” he asked, sitting on the floor, as the other two shuffled about to make space.
Looking at Harry to see if he were being serious, Draco wondered whether that would be a good idea. “I wouldn’t want to intrude or anything -“
“They’re just like us, but without magic?” he asked, confused as to why his father would tell him differently.
bad, surely,” Harry replied, raising his eyebrows at Draco who raised one back.
Draco reached out his hand, hesitantly, unsure how Harry would react. He grabbed Draco’s hand. “Harry?” he asked, as Harry’s grasp on his hand got tighter.
. Either way, they had decided that anything important would be discussed via the Mirror and pseudonyms would be used when writing letters, just in case.
“Did you insult me? I feel like I've been insulted,” Harry said, almost making Draco’s heart jump from his chest as he linked his finger’s with Draco’s.
“Then she’ll leave you alone,” Ron shrugged. “She did with Charlie anyway.”
Harry grinned. “Because you like me,” he said, poking Draco’s face as a pink blush crawled onto it.
“So we just,” Harry began.
Everyone had been surprised when Malfoy vanished from the wizarding world, but they had been more surprised when he began donating hefty amounts of the Malfoy fortune to every charity possible. The Prophet had claimed it was a weak grasp at redeeming the Malfoy family name, but Harry had always suspected that wasn’t really the case. If it
Potter sighed and shook his head. “I’m going to personally
Draco gave a short wave and a small smile, and he once again noticed that Harry looked as if he might make a run for it.
“So how long has this been going on?” Evelyn asked, her eyes shining with amusement.
With a soft chuckle, Draco sat up and gestured for Scorpius to sit between him and Harry. “Would you like to make some icing mon cœur?” he asked, brushing his fingers through his son’s hair.
of kindness, you’re delusional Potter,” he huffed, his cheeks rosy.
Harry braced himself as he nodded. “How do you feel about me dating someone?” he asked.
“But...?”
“The third book is about the social etiquette of tea, which arguably should be the first book you read, but you shouldn’t even
With a small wave, Sirius retreated to the corridor, glancing once more at Draco when he was at the door. Draco grinned at the man and waved. Sirius reminded him of Andromeda in some respects, also of his mother in other’s.
Remus appeared to have a realisation and his hand slid from Sirius’ shoulder to his hand as the word ‘
With a shrug, Teddy continued eating his toast. “Then I guess it’s okay,” he said. “But dating is weird, being friends seems so much easier,” he explained.
quiet?” he suggested, with a pleading smile.
“Even if I wanted to Potter I can’t. For multiple different reasons,” he said, causing Potter to raise an eyebrow.
“Ted taught me a few games,” Draco shrugged, grinning. “I bet I can beat you at go-fish,” he challenged, glancing at Harry who chuckled.
“You’re not –“ Harry began.
“Anytime kiddo,” Harry said softly with a smile, ruffling Scorpius’ hair.
He tried to take a deep breath, but it didn’t feel possible.
like it if you could make it,” Draco corrected.
his comment about Snape and everyone flooded into the room. There was an unheard groan when the classroom was somehow colder than the corridor, and despite Hermione’s warming charm, he could still feel the change in temperature. They took their usual seats at the back of the classroom and began to set up the basics.
Rubbing his eyes, as if that would clarify his thoughts, he tried to figure out how it was best to phrase his question as he was sat in the back of the library with Blaise and Pansy. He didn’t think his mother would appreciate it being said so bluntly, but there were only so many ways to ask if your father was a part of a terrorist organisation.
“That’s the plan,” Harry said, smiling as Teddy jumped from the stone pavement to the tarmac one as they rounded the corner, deciding to hold Harry’s hand.
“Git,” he muttered. “But I will,” Draco said, the corners of his mouth twitching as he tried not to smile.
“Then I suppose I’m willing to meet new people,” Teddy grinned. Harry rolled his eyes, ruffling the boy’s hair, making him laugh.
“It is,” Harry said, holding Teddy’s hand as they crossed the road. He knocked on the door at the side of the shop.
!” he exclaimed, making Draco chuckle.
Harry sighed, flicking at a stick, protruding from the dirt of the bank. “He was –“ and then it was Harry’s turn for his words to falter. “He was there,” he said.
“Ginny! Tell me you’ve still got the fireworks,” Ron interrupted.
“How are you so good with children?” Draco whispered, leaning towards Harry as Scorpius was patiently scooping the mixture into the cupcake cases.
Scorpius shook his head. “No thank you Daddy, I have Ladon and my crayons,” he assured, in the way that made an eight-year-old seem to be an old soul.
Perhaps that was
Splashing water on his face to cool him down, he then continued on his way to the kitchen. Only this time he found himself staring at a door which was slightly ajar.
“My name is Draco Malfoy,” he said, and Ron chuckled, amused that Draco’s go to in every situation appeared to be to reveal his name. Draco scowled at Ron who instantly flattened his expression. “Son of Narcissa Black,” he said, looking at Ron who suddenly seemed to understand why he said it. Harry watched over Draco’s shoulder as Kreacher stiffened.
“Because I ran after you, you bloody, insufferable git,” Malfoy snapped, his eyes widening when he realised what he said, and Harry felt himself blush. “For Merlin’s sake, I ran after you to make sure you weren’t going to do anything stupid,” he explained, rubbing the bridge of his nose.
“It’s nice to know my efforts are appreciated,” Draco grinned, taking the whisk from Scorpius. “I’ll take it from here mon cœur, why don’t you go and put the cupcake cases in the tray.”
Hermione scrunched up her nose. “Maybe an advisor to the Minister,” she pondered. “But Kingsley is actually rather a good Minister.”
Harry shrugged. “I don’t like grudges,” he sighed. “Besides,” he added with a small smile. “If I play my cards right, I think Ron might purposefully lose at chess and Hermione might help me with the summer potions work.”
Malfoy blinked at Harry, but before he could ask Harry to elaborate, Harry grinned.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Yes, Potter, I do happen to still exist.” Draco tried his best to hide how uncomfortable he felt in Potter’s presence, especially as he was gawking at him.
Lifting the pillow off his head, Harry felt the guilt tugging at his body, trying to drag him out of bed. He had a nice, stable job and he was complaining about it. Outstretching his arms to his bedside table, he tried to grab his wand. Once he managed to grab it, he cast a quick
Harry tilted his head. “So what you’re saying,” he began. “Is this house has skeletons in the closet?” he joked, giggling as Draco groaned.
“Just as it’s difficult to be in awe of someone when you’ve seen their first time on a broom,” Draco smirked.
Harry smiled at the letter. He had been incredibly thankful when Draco had understood the need for Harry to spend some time with Teddy. Even though it was something that should be expected in a relationship, he was still relieved. Although he missed Draco too, he was never sure how to bring up the subject of who he was dating with Teddy.
leave me alone,” he hissed.
Raising an eyebrow, Remus smiled at Harry who blushed under the amused gaze of his Godfather. “The cloak, I presume?” he asked, knowing the answer. Remus sighed, his smile widening as Sirius’ head flicked between Harry and Remus and then around the empty space surround them, standing close to Harry, who felt his blush darken when he realised that Sirius was being a protective guardian.
“It’s the worst,” Ron agreed, catching Harry’s foul mood as if it were contagious.
“It might as well be,” Malfoy groaned.
-----
“So did I,” Mr Weasley replied, rubbing the bridge of his nose as he sat next to Ms Weasley. “
Ron’s eyes bulged. “Malfoy?” he exclaimed, horrified.
,” she complained, dragging him into a compartment. She was a similar height to him, and for as long as he had known her, she had short, pin-straight hair with a fringe that was always perfectly level – somehow.
“Exactly, so I know better than anyone that our charm is irresistible,” he said, and Harry not-so-subtly rolled his eyes. “But I approve,” Sirius said, looking at his husband and the blond Slytherin.
“You can call me Blaise, but don’t expect me to call you Harry,” Blaise added, and Harry snorted.
Surprisingly, Malfoy hadn’t joined in on Snape’s commentary, which only put Harry on edge. He had glanced over at Malfoy a few times out of curiosity (expecting that the lack of snide comments was due to silent death stares) but he saw that Malfoy looked almost bored with the lesson, and was just staring at his own potion as it boiled, as if expecting something miraculous to appear.
“It’s an easy read,” Draco shrugged. “Plus, it’s got illustrations,” he grinned as Harry rolled his eyes. “I promise, it’s a really sweet story, my mother used to read me the original French before I went to sleep,” Draco explained, and Harry felt his chest swell at the idea of a little Draco enthusing over this Little Prince. “It’s not very long, so your attention span should manage,” he teased, and Harry rolled his eyes.
Teddy nodded into his chest, sniffling.
Harry smiled to himself. “Thank Merlin, I had hoped I did,” he chuckled.
Blaise tutted at the pair. “You’re both so
“But what if, it’s a plan to get close to you.”
“I don’t think it would affect my position if they knew,” Draco shrugged with a sigh. “But only if you want to.”
Mortified, he could only nod, and Draco simply chuckled.
“I don’t think I’m that desperate Potter,” he joked, smirking.
“You’ll have to wait,” Draco teased. “It’s a book even someone with a short attention span should be able to read, rest assured,” he grinned as Harry huffed.
“Always,” Harry grinned, standing up, almost stumbling over as he did.
“Don’t play dumb with me Malfoy, I’m not in the mood,” he said, glaring at Malfoy’s smirk.
Harry chuckled. “Sorry,” he said, lifting their linked hands. “I forget I do it sometimes,” he said, rubbing the back of his neck. “I’ll let go if-”
was on the train. “Honestly Draco,” Pansy sighed, shaking her head with a smile.
“I didn’t know it was common for families to be in the same house,” Draco muttered, more to himself than anyone else.
“See you tomorrow.” Harry waved as he walked away, and Draco waved back.
“You do have a sweet tooth Potter,” Malfoy retorted. Nonetheless, he grabbed a plate from beneath the counter and placed it on top.
“What are we?” Harry asked.
Draco thought, forgetting about the expectations of him being in Slytherin. ‘
“Don’t remind me,” Malfoy complained, rubbing the bridge of his nose.
Blaise nodded. “He’s got a point Pans,” he agreed, making Pansy roll her eyes.
Nothing, however, distracted from Umbridge’s tyranny. As much as they tried to ignore her existence, as soon as Fred and George left, the atmosphere became chaotic and depressing, with everyone trying their hardest to get rid of Umbridge but no one having the same planning expertise. These careless pranks were one of the reasons it was difficult to sneak to the Astronomy Tower.
“Hello,” Draco said to the lady opposite his mother, who he assumed to be his aunt. She had a face almost identical to his mothers, but where Narcissa’s expression was stoic and blank, this woman’s face was warm and inviting. Whilst Narcissa had straight platinum hair, Andromeda had long brown curls, similar to the blond ones Draco had when his mother didn’t brush his hair back. The curls were soft and neat, not unruly and Draco was instantly soothed by her presence.
Draco froze.
Harry nodded. “Scorpius,” he said. “He’s rather sweet, Draco said he was more excited that we were dating than he was,” he laughed, remembering Draco showing him the crayon wedding invitations. It was a little embarrassing but they both let it slide because it was adorable. “I just hope they both get on with Teddy,” Harry said, voicing this thought aloud.
over Christmas, but he wasn’t surprised, he had been expecting it all year,” she said, her eyes flickering to Harry to watch his reaction.
“Is it good?” Harry asked, directing his head towards the book on Draco’s lap.
“Draco?” Harry said, his voice only just audible. Draco hummed, the sound resonating within Harry. “We’ll talk again right? At some point,” he asked, a sudden absence of warmth on his forehead. And he opened his eyes to see Draco had leaned away.
“Do you think Snape’s going to be in a bad or awful mood today?” Ron asked Harry with a nudge, forcing him to look away from Malfoy.
When he was certain he was alone, he braced himself for the sound of his father’s voice as he opened the letter.
“Okay, okay, I’ll leave you be,” Harry said, biting back a smile as Malfoy sighed.
They both knew that this was not the end.
“It’s the one thing that I don’t think will ever change,” he admitted. He hoped it was true.
, you’re on.”
“Thanks,” he said, shaking his head as if that would remove the sad feelings. He changed the topic very quickly. “Do you know what form your Patronus takes?” he asked, and Draco sighed.
“Does this mean we’re already family?” Scorpius asked bouncing up and down.
However, instead of hearing the click of the door closing, Harry heard a sigh. “This bloody potion,” Malfoy muttered under his breath, just loud enough for Harry to hear. Harry could hear the door opening again and span around to see Malfoy standing in the doorframe, looking as if he didn’t have a care in the world, but his eyes were filled with concern, and looked misplaced on Malfoy’s face. “Potter, I know I’m the last person you will want to see at the moment, but I recommend you talk to someone. Someone who could help with your, unstable state,” he said, going to close the door once more.
It’s strange how grief can bring two people together.
“I overheard some sixth-years in the Hufflepuff common room talking about it,” Teddy said. “It seems weirdly complicated,” he said, scrunching up his nose.
Harry grinned sheepishly. “I’m not the most ‘
“Yes,” Draco interrupted. Harry’s head snapped up to meet Draco’s eyes. “But after my exams if that’s alright.”
“Emotional abuse is just as bad as physical abuse Harry,” Sirius interrupted, his expression the same as when he first found out about the Dursley’s abusive behaviour. “Just because they never hit you doesn’t mean they’ve never harmed you.” Sirius had a firm grip on Harry’s shoulders, and Harry didn’t know how to respond.
“Cool,” Draco said to himself, smiling. He liked Sirius. “A tradition of saying fuck tradition, I like it,” Draco said, his eyes widening when he realised, he swore. “
. The bulb of bright light illuminated his face, making his hair look white instead of blond. “How is your hair still perfect?” Harry asked, casting a
“Sorry,” the boy muttered.
“Slytherin’s Ice Prince, obviously,” he drawled, raising his nose in the air. Harry snorted.
His laugh made Harry realise how close they were as he could feel Draco’s body shake.
Seeming to decide that changing the topic of conversation was the best course of action, Harry asked, “have you thought about your future plans after you become a Healer?”
"I think I actually have an idea of what wand would suit you,” he said, making Draco raise an eyebrow.
“You’ve been wallowing in self-pity since you split up with Ginny,” Hermione said nonchalantly.
you and I; is there an
“They do?” Harry asked. He hadn’t questioned why the cloak worked; he just knew it did. “Well anyway, this should let us walk around Hogsmeade unnoticed, or at least, you don’t have to worry about being seen with me.”
It was now Thursday, and Harry loved his unusually placed weekend, because nowhere was particularly busy, but it did make it difficult to meet up with anyone.
“You wanted to live with Sirius?” Draco asked, trying to remember if Harry had mentioned that before and he had forgotten.
He knew Draco was going to find it very amusing, and the thought of it made him chuckle a little.
“Pretty much,” he grinned. “And is this your son?” he asked, noticing the smaller Malfoy who waved excitedly.
“So, you were acquitted?” Draco asked, his hands in his pockets. He cursed himself for asking a question he already knew the answer to.
Harry shook his head. “Besides Dudley and his gang occasionally using me as a punching bag,” he shrugged, as if it wasn’t a big deal. “Dumbledore knows too, I think,” Harry added after a moment of thought. “He knows I hate it there; he must have known about the cupboard; my Hogwarts letter was addressed there.”
Harry chuckled nervously. “A few months?” he said, coming out as more of a question than an answer.
to talk about
Harry shrugged. “A few nightmares,” he shrugged, and Draco nodded, as the dog rested its head on the bed. Harry smiled at the dog, rubbing its head. “
“Tiring?” Harry chuckled.
There was a faint hum of magic emanating from the teashop, and Harry hoped that was due to it being owned by and visited by magic folk, rather than the tea being made by magic. Harry had only tried once to make tea with magic, and it was the second most disgusting drink he ever had to drink. It would have been the worst, but nothing has ever, or will ever be more disgusting than the Polyjuice potion he drank in his second year. Although, as it seemed that Malfoy would be the one making his tea, he was certain that it wouldn’t be made with magic – he had a feeling Malfoy was a stickler when it came to making tea.
“Gin, we’ll explain but now isn’t –“ Ron began.
“You’re still an arsehole Harry,” Malfoy smiled, shaking his head. “And if I have to call you Harry, you’re going to suffer too.”
“You can use the floo in the back if you want,” Potter offered.
He noticed that everyone, including the Slytherins, was staring at him in a mixture of shock and concern. Ron was standing, as if he were ready to pounce, prepared to fight, and prepared to drag Harry out of the classroom if he needed to. Hermione’s eyes were darting between Harry and the door, as if she were calculating the risks of grabbing him and running out of the door.
, just knowing you’re OK,” Ron trailed off, trying to find the words to convey what he wanted to. “You’ve never been the kind of bloke to talk about feeling, and we’ve never minded because you still told us what was going on,” Ron sighed, moving his hand from Hermione's shoulder to Harry's. “We want to know what’s happening with you.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “There’s that Gryffindor spirit,” he joked, and Harry rolled his eyes.
, I’m going to have words with you,” she muttered to herself. “Well, that makes this less difficult already,” she said, sipping her tea, which Draco was certain must be cold by now.
“My Dad,” Harry said softly, catching Draco’s attention. “He was an illegal Animagus,” he said.
“Why?” Harry asked.
“And if we’re going to get there before nightfall, you’ll have to say goodbye to your new friend Scorpius,” Malfoy interrupted, smiling softly at his son, who looked very conflicted.
As soon as he reached the Astronomy Tower, his breath became shallow and the room began to spin. He sat next to the door and tried his best to breathe but it was hard, he couldn’t focus on anything and his thoughts were racing out of control.
the one asking you to join,” Draco said pointedly.
Harry hummed in recognition.
Harry wondered how long he’d be able to hear the ringing in his ears this time.
“Malfoy, Draco,” the Professor called out, and there was a small whisper of voices, which dissipated as soon as they began. It was then, that Draco realised how nervous he felt and was glad to see his friends offering him smiles of encouragement as the hat was placed upon his head.
“She was,” Draco admitted. “She’s Scorpius’ mother,” he explained, and suddenly the use of past tense made sense.
Harry chuckled nervously, his hand running through his hair. “I haven’t told him anything about the Order ‘Mione.”
“Does this mean you’ve quit being an Auror?” Teddy asked, his eyes alight.
“So, what’s this ingenious plan of yours?” Draco asked, sounding nervous despite the smirk that was etched into his features. Harry pulled them further into the shrubbery of the edge of the forest, hoping to placate his nerves.
to be honest – don’t let anyone tell you how you should feel about it,” Sirius said, his eyes shining.
“You had just told everyone you sleep in a cupboard, forgive me if I had doubts.” Malfoy drawled, and leaned against one of the few remaining desks opposite where Harry stood. Now that Malfoy had mentioned running after Harry, he could see a few stray strands of hair and Harry noticed his robes were noticeably dishevelled compared to the last time he had seen Malfoy.
“Okay,” Harry hummed, turning away slightly. Draco could still see him blush a little. “By the way, I saw Remus in the kitchen.”
Draco saw Harry smile.
, I will poison your tea.”
“Do you think it gets easier?” Draco asked, staring at their hands. “The feeling of missing someone?”
“Anytime,” Cedric smiled. “Are you feeling any better?” he asked.
The shop was filled with fabrics, from lime greens to shimmering silvers to an odd translucent material that fascinated Draco. It had a fluffy red carpet, no doubt so that if someone was barefoot, they wouldn’t damage their feet, and the walls were a deep shade of purple, making the shop feel almost a little
“That’s incredibly complex magic,” Harry said in awe. “It’s brilliant,” he grinned.
Not that he was complaining, as it meant Harry would bring him a hot chocolate and sit with him whilst he rambled about the book he was reading.
“Just here,” Harry said, smiling as she turned her head to see him removing the kettle from the stove. “Still only one sugar?” he asked, pouring the boiling water through into two cups. Whilst he may have become Draco’s tea-taster, Harry still had no idea how to make tea in the fancy way he did and tended to stick to tea bags.
“Well it certainly wouldn’t be
Sirius shook his head. “I’m not leaving you there Harry,” he insisted, his words never wavering. “Do you need me to visit?”
Harry wasn’t a too dissimilar shade of pink either. “Oh, er, thank you Draco,” he said, unable to contain his smile. He had thought about what it was that Harry would want to remember – his family.
“Yes,
Harry had become quite the regular at
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “I swear he got his obsession with creatures from Luna,” he muttered with a smile.
No one had taken the news well, especially the Hufflepuffs, especially Cho and especially Draco. Everyone knew that Cedric had taken the role of a protective older brother to Draco, not too soon after his arrival into Hufflepuff. Draco had found it odd at first that Cedric would always ask how he was finding his lessons, how he was finding Hufflepuff, but it wasn’t until he received his first letter from his father after his sorting that he realised that Cedric would be his family outside of blood.
Without Teddy to visit, and with Andromeda visiting a friend in France, Harry took to the streets once more. This time out of boredom more than curiosity.
Draco shook his head, taking a deep breath. “Nothing,” he said, smiling a smile that he knew didn’t reach his eyes. “It was nice to see you Harry,” he smiled, waving as he left the bathroom.
“All right Potter,” Draco grinned, squeezing Harry’s hands with his own. “I’ll allow you to be graced by my presence on a date,” he drawled, grinning when Harry rolled his eyes at his theatrics. “I expect chocolates.”
It told him to expect the worst.
“Are you all right dear?  That was quite a noise you made, and you look very pale,” the invigilator asked, a frown pulling onto her face as Harry’s eyes darted around the room. Harry realised he was on the floor.
“Yeah,” Harry admitted, his breath hitching as he brought his hands to his head. “I’m sorry,” he whispered.
“I’m insulted,” Harry deadpanned, trying to think of a distraction where he would be able to grab the book. A smile tugged on the corners of his mouth.
That caught Harry’s attention. “A link?”
Harry stared at Draco for a moment, watching as a blush creeped up the back of his neck.
where and you snap at everyone and everything and -"
Blaise’s eyes widened as he looked back at Harry. “
With a timid glance at the sky, Malfoy cast a
“Or maybe you were born to be a professional tea taster, and that’s why,” Draco suggested, grinning as Harry laughed.
Even though Harry had said he didn’t mind returning to the Dursley’s, he felt his stomach drop when they confirmed that he had no choice but to return. “It’s really not that bad, you don’t –“
reaction,” muttered Harry, who chuckled afterwards.
“I know you don’t like Malfoy very much, from what you’ve told me about him, I don’t either, but if he really wants a way out, if he wants to change…”
“Yeah you know, that meal you have in the evening, usually after lunch,” Harry joked, talking rapidly and making Draco roll his eyes.
“I suppose so,” Harry said sleepily, leaning into Draco’s touch.
there for you when you need the –“
The next few hours were spent wandering the park, listening to Scorpius explain each duck’s backstory and Malfoy tried not to laugh at Harry, who looked as if someone was explaining Muggle astrophysics to him; his eyes widened as he began to lose his understanding of the conversation. Harry couldn’t remember how many secret glares he had shot towards Malfoy, but his expression instantly disintegrated as he saw Malfoy’s blue hair fall over his eyes as he tried to contain his laughter.
“Yes, well, we’ve already established that you have the observational skills of a brick wall Harry,” Draco smirked, bringing Harry’s hand to his lips. “You always have,” he said, lightly kissing the back of Harry’s hand.
Draco shook his hands, taking a deep breath.
Harry shook his head, his chest beginning to ache.
Swatting away Harry’s hand, the corners of his mouth twitched. “I have a reputation Potter,
Draco blinked. “A date?” he asked, as if he had misheard.
It was a few days after Teddy had asked Harry if he could call him Dad, most of the time spent decorating Teddy’s room to his liking, and he was still trying not to smile like a lunatic every time Teddy called him Dad. Teddy had, had so many ideas for his room at Grimmauld Place, that Harry was certain the boy was overestimating his magical abilities, but when an eleven-year-old looks at you and asks you to bewitch the ceiling to look like the night sky so he can track the moon cycle, it’s difficult to say no. Teddy had also asked if he could paint the walls and they were both still finding paint in their hair.
“That’s because
Malfoy stared blankly at Harry, as if he had been caught red handed stealing from Snapes personal store cupboard. He sighed before he spoke. “The same reason you are,” he said, and Harry raised his eyebrows, doubtful that Malfoy spent the first eleven years of his life sleeping in a cupboard. “Not the
“Sorry darling, but we can’t,” Narcissa said, her eyes narrowing on Andromeda.
,” he chastised, pulling on the sleeve of her robes to turn her back around. “He’s really shy,” he explained, looking at Harry to see if he had noticed.
Harry chuckled before he too pondered the idea of waiting for the cakes to be iced. “I don’t think I can wait, can you?” he grinned, watching as Scorpius grinned at him too.
“My boyfriend,” Harry said. ‘
Unsure if it were from anger or tiredness, Draco felt Harry tremble. “You’re okay Harry,” Draco whispered softly, his voice only audible to them. “And the Ministry are a bunch of arseholes,” he added, smiling when he heard Harry chuckle, feeling his shoulders shake against his own.
Death Eater,” Potter said, picking the wand back up. “How long has it been acting up?”
“Maybe after a bit of Befuddlement Draught, but not on a daily basis,” Harry pointed out with a smile.
The robes were incredibly itchy, and Draco was worried about getting a needle stabbed into his arm. It wasn’t that he didn’t trust Madam Malkin’s skills as a seamstress, but rather that he didn’t think he would be able to stand still for the time it took to make the robes.
“I – I was wondering if this will be a common occurrence is all,” Malfoy dismissed, regaining his composure.
, instead of sending an owl,” Draco chuckled, despite trying not to.
When it was Harry’s turn, he stretched his hands and took a deep breath before Hermione passed him the phial.
“He’s a little stuck-up still, but that’s probably the pureblood upbringing,” Harry grinned at Sirius who ruffled his hair.
Harry chuckled. “I don’t have much of a memory now, to be honest,” he joked.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows, darting his eyes between the two adults, trying to understand what that meant. Andromeda went still. She went to ask a question, but with a glance at Draco she drew her lips into a thin line.
could get him in a lot of trouble, and I think it would be the same if the Ministry got involved in his life.”

He threw himself into his schoolwork when he returned to Hogwarts, but nothing was louder than the words of his father.
,” he muttered again, his grasp on the stone becoming painful, as the smooth ridges began to push at his palms. “
Draco continued to stare at the fire, hugging his knees close to him. “But they shouldn’t have to deal with
Once he was pre-occupied with the cupcake cases, Draco turned to look at Harry. “I know what you’re doing Potter,” he muttered, suppressing a smile.
he muttered to himself, shaking his head. His knee was bouncing. “It’s just – he’s already been through so much.”
“It’s okay, I’ll help you,” Scorpius said wisely, and Harry bit back his laughter, replacing it with a cough when he noticed Draco glaring at him, as if challenging him to laugh at his son.
– dreams are like,” Ron added, shivering at the thought.
“Do you have the Queen of Hearts?” Draco asked.
Draco had loved it.
Harry chuckled. “Looks like you’ve got your hands full there,” he said, gesturing to Rose and Hugo who were leaning over Ron.
“You don’t have to,” Draco assured. “We don’t have to talk at all if you don’t want to –“
Draco tried not to laugh at the reaction. “That bad huh?”
“I’m very capable of taking care of myself thank you,” Harry retorted, and Draco snorted.
“It’s seven aside,” Draco smiled. “And the players fly on broomsticks –“
“If I’m honest, he might have done, but he didn’t like talking about his family,” Harry shrugged, and Draco nodded.
“Please Sirius,” Harry insisted, his eyes still avoiding Sirius’ own.
“Very much so, yes,” Draco said with a small smile. “But I’m happy I can take them.”
“That’s what you chose to take from that?” Andromeda asked, amused. “In simple terms, I suppose I am,” she said, taking a final sip of tea. “Anyway, did you hear about Teddy’s broken tooth?”
Mrs Weasley would be just as upset as Sirius and was probably wondering why Harry never told her anything.
“Honestly Potter, I’m not surprised,” Malfoy sniffed. “We’ve already agreed that you know nothing of the etiquette surrounding tea so…” he trailed off, gesturing at Harry.
“You did
I haven’t laughed this much in
’ meant ‘
Harry grabbed Draco’s collar and pulled him closer, standing on the balls of his feet to meet Draco’s lips with his own as Draco tipped his head forwards, cupping Harry’s face with his hands. As their lips met, it was like when a wave crashes upon the sand; chaotic, intense, awe inspiring and yet somehow, incredibly natural, as if they had done this for thousands of years. It was strange to think they had once been enemies. Harry couldn’t imagine doing anything with Draco other than snogging him senseless in the corner of bookshop.
“Next week,” Harry said, smiling. “So, I’m staying at the Burrow for a week, and then, I’ll move to the Black Manor, I think. Sirius hates the place, but I’m not sure if they have anywhere else at the moment.”
Harry laughed, making Draco’s stomach flip. It was a soft laugh, not like the one’s he had heard from the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall, the kind of laugh only ever really heard by friends. “I’m single if that’s what you’re asking,” he grinned as Draco’s ears turned pink.
Harry nodded. “Yeah, Dumbledore wanted to see him,” he replied, still brushing the dog’s fur. The dog pushed at Harry’s hand with its head and Harry began muttering to the dog. “
“I suppose I did,” he sighed once more.
whoever said that, it makes my life so much harder,” he muttered, making Draco smile. This was the Potter he remembered. “Right, well I might as well explain it to you.” He gave Draco back his wand and gestured for Draco to take a seat next to him on the window seat.
“It must do,” Harry said, shuffling on his seat. “I don’t think it goes away, but I think it does get easier.”
Draco nodded frantically, but it as it slowed, he frowned. “But I can’t be seen with you.”
“Why’s that?” Harry asked, and Teddy looked at him as if the answer was obvious. They were heading to the shops because Harry realised that in his haste to make the house welcoming, he forgot to buy enough food for the both of them – he may have been trying to be a responsible adult, but he was, still, a little forgetful.
Draco shrugged, giving a small nod. “I have no idea how to play, so you won’t do worse than me,” he joked, and Harry shot him a fond, exasperated look.
in Merlin’s name would they –?” Sirius got more irritated with every word, his expression only souring.
“Oh,” she said, appearing a little startled. “You –“
“Merlin knows why,” Draco said under his breath. “You’ll never let me live that down.”
“You look happier than usual,” she said bluntly, and Harry rolled his eyes.
might die. Life won’t be the same after.”
“The fact that Malfoy would warn
“We probably won’t get a choice in this Draco,” Ted said. “Your Aunt will probably explain this to you as well, but anything Dumbledore asks you to do, don’t do it, not unless you know it is absolutely the right thing to do.”
“Doesn’t answer the question,” Harry pointed out, feeling his heart quicken as a smile appeared on Malfoy’s face instead of a sneer. “Why would you care if I did do something stupid?” he asked, and once again Malfoy looked like a deer in headlights.
in Potions?” he asked, raising an eyebrow.
Harry wished he could share Remus’ faith in Dumbledore.
he kissed you?” Sirius asked with an amused smile, making Harry blush.
Ted waved a hand dismissively. “Not at all my dear, it just threw me is all,” he admitted. “I never would have expected Sirius Black, of
“What do you mean?” Draco asked, joining Harry in staring at the ceiling.
Later, he would curse himself for being disappointed when Malfoy pulled away.
“Still too posh to swear,” Harry chuckled, yawning again. “And I’m just tired really,” he shrugged, smiling as Draco glanced sideways at Harry. “
When Harry knew he was alone, he took the Marauders Map out of his bag, and examined it for any signs of Malfoy.
“You don’t
Ron nodded as Draco tried to process that flying broomsticks were unusual for some people. “Don’t worry about it, I guess it is kind of cool,” Draco grinned, elated when Harry gave him a small smile in response. “There are four types of players.”
“An amazing observation Potter, I can see why you’re an Auror,” Draco drawled.
It was impossible
,” Harry insisted. They’d had this conversation many times over the past few hours. Draco had never pushed Harry, although his opinion on the matter was exceedingly clear.
“I’ve been meaning to go to Hogsmeade for a while now,” Remus added, his eyes flickering to Sirius. “Been putting it off actually. Order business.”
,” Harry groaned, running his hand through his hair. Sirius whined at Harry for using his awful nickname.
Harry found himself taking a step closer to Malfoy. “I want to know,” he said, surprised at the lack of ferocity in his voice. He wasn’t demanding an answer, but encouraging Malfoy to tell him, something he had never done – although neither of them needed much encouragement to talk in this state.
He shivered again, pulling his knees up to his chest.
“It’s no problem,” Sirius said, still smiling softly. “And just so you know, the offer of a hug still stands, we’re family after all,” Sirius shrugged, causing Draco to chuckle despite still being a little teary.
“Harry,” Hermione said, her eyes firmly watching Harry’s. “Is this,
“Really?” Harry asked, still amazed at how much Scorpius knew about dragons. “Hang on Scorpius, we should wait for your Dad,” Harry said, as Scorpius hadn’t yet stopped.
“Try not to move dear,” Madam Malkin told him softly.
Sirius glared at the two of them, before smiling at Draco. “Wonderful to meet you Draco, I believe you might now be the only family I have” he said, offering Draco his hand, ignoring Lupin and Andromeda laughing in the background.
about magic, so I definitely didn’t know I was a Parseltongue,” he explained, rubbing the back of his neck. “We went to the zoo for my cousin’s birthday, he wasn’t the nicest bloke,” Harry said. He didn’t speak about the Dursley’s much anymore; it felt weird to relive this memory. “Anyway, to cut the story short, I was speaking to this snake and my cousin made me angry, next thing I knew, the glass had vanished, and the snake was snapping at my cousin’s ankles,” he shrugged.
“Harry!” Scorpius exclaimed, pushing past Draco to tackle Harry in a hug, though he was only small, so it wasn’t much of a tackle.
(See the end of the chapter for
is back, as if my father would tell me in a letter,” he sighed, rubbing at his temples. “It’s nice in the common room though,” he admitted.
Draco sighed and pulled out some Galleons anyway. “This should be enough.”
“I don’t have much of a choice now,” Draco said, a small smile dancing on his lips. “Sadly, I rather like talking to you,” he sighed as Harry rolled his eyes with a grin.
and his heart was pounding in his chest as if it were about to explode.
Even though Harry wanted to see them both, he knew it was a bad idea, that they would get caught. Remus would get accused of plotting against the Ministry, and Sirius would get sent to Azkaban.
“That you’re incredibly boring,” Teddy replied, and Harry couldn’t help but laugh, his nerves dissipating. “But that you’re also really nice and I’m glad you’re my Dad, even if we’re not related,” Teddy said with a shrug and a small smile.
“Do you want to use it or not?” Potter asked, standing up.
“You, young man, know exactly how to flatter an old woman,” she said, passing him one of the cinnamon buns, instead of passing them both to Harry. Draco stuck his tongue out at Harry who rolled his eyes.
Sirius sighed with a smile. “You don’t have to forgive him Cub, and you can be confused about the kiss because I know I would be, but you should talk to him.”
“It would be impressive though,” she said, shrugging off their criticisms.
“Oh sod off you prat, I was
Shrugging, Harry sat on the sofa. “Same as normal,” he said. Hermione frowned, pursing her lips. She looked as if she wanted to say something but was weighing up the pros and cons of speaking her mind. “Don’t look at me like that ‘Mione, just say what’s on your mind.”
cup of tea,” Draco explained. “Which is why this book is first,” he said, showing it to Harry. “This one is about the correct way to drink tea.”
“Finally, the twit leaves,” Malfoy drawled.
“You mean it?” Harry asked, as if there was a joke he had missed.
The shop was creatively called, Wands (Draco wondered how long it had taken Potter to come up with that name) but besides a different sign, it looked the same. The windows were tinted so you couldn’t see inside the shop, and it was painted a dark shade of purple.
Harry sighed and decided he didn’t want to walk the rest of the way home, so as soon as he was sure he wouldn’t be seen, he apparated to Grimmauld place.
Potter chuckled, “you were definitely a complete prat but that was years ago.”
It was a home where a family lived.
The other two looked at him with matching raised eyebrows.
Draco saw Harry glance at his wristwatch and his face fell, but Draco was sure he was seeing things. “I should get back to the shop.”
“Don’t run!” Draco and Harry called out at the same time, bursting into laughter afterwards. “Merlin, tu seras ma mort,” Draco muttered, a grin plastered on his face as he looked at Harry, who felt his stomach flip at the warmth in the Malfoy’s eyes.
However, Harry noticed that Draco would glance at Remus, as if to ask him something, before looking down at his lap. He nudged Draco, encouraging him to tell Remus what he told Harry. Somewhat reluctantly, Draco asked if he could speak to Remus for a moment. Remus looked shocked but agreed, nonetheless.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows and Harry grinned at him.
Potter tilted his head slightly, making Draco smile.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck. “Officially, about two days.”
“Hey!” Harry laughed. “I’ll have you know; I’ve been a wonderful influence on all
“It happened twice then, doesn’t mean –“
He didn’t notice that he was no longer alone until he saw a shadow in the corner of his eye.
“Hello,” he greeted cheerfully. “Hogwarts too?” Draco asked, and when he got no response, he turned his head to see the other boy nod his head slowly. Draco tilted his head at the quiet response. He tried to think of what he could talk about. “Do you know what Hogwarts house you’ll be in?”
Harry’s eyes widened and it looked as if he had just had all the air sucked out of him. “Shit, I’m sorr-“
“He didn’t?” Harry asked, surprised.
Harry blinked. “Are you, I wouldn’t be intruding?”
“Really?” Harry chuckled. “I thought you did it to be overly dramatic.”
“I won't,” Draco whispered, blinking rapidly.
“But where do you want to go?” The boy asked, his eyes not leaving Draco’s face.
“I’ll teach you,” Harry smiled, before looking back at Sirius. “So?”
Once the two boys reached the safety of the trees on the path to the village, Harry stepped out from beneath the cloak. He missed the comfort of the blond’s hand in his own and as they walked down the path, he suddenly understood how strange it must have been for Ron and Hermione to talk to him whilst he was under the cloak.
“Yes, well, Master Sirius asked me to tell you that Mister Potter has arrived,” Kreacher muttered, still squinting at Draco.
“Yes,” Harry said, looking at the ground and he scraped the sole of his shoe on the floor.
The boy looked at Draco for the first time since he’d entered, and Draco found himself looking into curious emerald eyes. Then the boy shrugged. “Alright.”
“Yes,” Draco nodded. “Hiding makes it seem childish,
. “But everyone has their own traits, outside of the binary of this sorting system, which makes it, actually kind of nice,’ Cedric admitted, smiling at Draco.
They froze.
” Harry exclaimed, opening the door for Draco. “Who was the Gryffindor?” he asked, raising his eyebrows.
“As soon as we realised why she was upset,” Hermione continued. “We made sure to assure her that just because Hugo was around, it didn’t mean we loved her any less, and now, they’re inseparable,” she grinned, looking at her children as Rose helped Hugo up after he had fallen over.
“I forget sometimes,” Blaise said, as the ghosts stopped to talk to some students. “That people haven’t grown up with magic, it seems like such an odd way to grow up,” he shuddered, and Draco couldn’t help but agree.
family life is hunky-dory. It’s fucked up by the sounds of things,” he muttered, and the snow on the ground swished, being kicked around by an invisible foot. “Besides, at least I can say with certainty that my family does care for me – in a way,” Draco said, and whilst it was not meant to be jab at his own home life, Harry felt defensive.
As if being summoned, Harry stumbled, again, out of the forest and Scorpius looked at his dad to ask if this was Mr Potter. Draco nodded in reply, standing up to say hello as Scorpius scrunched his face slightly in thought, as if trying to figure out how to ask about the forest.
“I don’t feel any different,” Harry said, trying to figure out if he just hadn’t noticed a difference.
impatient,” Draco huffed, with a smile.
“You what?” Ron squeaked; his voice two octaves higher than normal.
Teddy looked up at Harry. “Will it be better this time?” he asked.
“My boyfriend,” Harry clarified, smiling softly at Teddy. “You don’t have to if you don’t want to,” he said, watching at Teddy nibbled at his toast.
“It’s quiet here, when Myrtle isn’t around,” Harry shrugged, and Draco laughed, his eyes tearing up again.
“Honestly Pansy, you can be nicer,” Zabini muttered, shaking his head as she huffed, still glaring at Harry who shifted on his feet. “Lovely to meet you properly Potter,” he said, flashing Harry as grin. Harry blinked, baffled at the difference in response and nodded at Zabini, shaking his outstretched hand. “Draco told us everything, so you don’t have to worry.”
Professor Lupin laughed, obviously expecting the confusion. “Feel free to call me Remus, Draco, I’m no longer your Professor.” Draco had already decided he would not do that. “It’s lovely to see you Andie, how long has it been?” he asked, as she grinned.
“I’ll try not to take that as an insult,” Harry muttered, rolling his eyes as he smiled.
Scorpius mouthed an ‘oh’, turning back to his book. “Like how I feel for you,” he said, making Draco’s heart swell.
“Harry,” Draco whispered softly. When Harry hummed in acknowledgement, Draco continued. “Your hands are shaking, are you cold?” he asked, and Harry glanced down at his hands (which felt perfectly fine) and noticed they were indeed shaking.
However, after a moment, he frowned.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck again, grinning nervously at Hermione and Ron. “Harry, who is it?” she asked softly.
Harry feigned innocence. “I have no idea what you’re talking about,” he lied, shooting a smile at Draco as he leaned against the counter.
“You know,” Draco began, absentmindedly playing with Harry’s curls. “My Aunt gave me this
Harry nodded, not trusting his words to tell the truth.
When Snape appeared to judge his potion, Harry shouldn’t have been surprised when Snape’s nose upturned, and he cleared the cauldron without any further inspection. “It seems that even celebrities can’t tell the difference between scurvy grass and sneezewort,” he sneered, a smirk appearing on his face, making Harry’s stomach drop. “Perhaps you mistook them on purpose Mr Potter? To avoid testing the potion. After all, it’s a
The hatch opened and Sirius climbed into the attic, brushing his hands on his trousers. “What are you boys doing, hiding up here?” he asked, smiling as Harry began to deal cards for Draco and himself.
Harry whisper exclaimed, biting his lip so hard, it was almost bleeding.
“I’ll pass it on,” he grinned. “My names Harry, by the way,” he said, waving as he left.
“I know,
of Hufflepuff,” he said.
With the noise of rustling papers and coats, Remus appeared just behind Sirius’ shoulder and glanced between the two of them. “How are you Harry?” he asked, his voice gentle, as if he was scared Harry was about to destroy the entire Gryffindor Tower.
Harry nodded.
Only eight people (including Hermione) made a potion that Snape deemed worthy enough of testing. Each person brought a phial of their potion up to the front and drank its contents, before having to explain the sensations caused by the potion. Probably wanting to prolong his suffering, Snape had decided that Harry would be the last person to test a potion.
A part of Harry hated to admit it, but Draco was extremely handsome. His hair was styled almost exactly as it had been at Hogwarts, but with a lot less hair gel and it was the colour of the
Harry had to be in one of these compartments.
“Hi Remus,” Harry said, as Draco let go of his fingers.
really boring…” Rose sighed.
“What about that is simple?” Harry asked with a small laugh.
“He came to visit?” Draco asked, still mildly confused at how disturbingly human this dog appeared to be.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck with an apologetic smile. “Fashionably late?” he offered, making Draco laugh, letting them step inside for a moment. He quickly wrapped Harry in a hug.
The two men sighed. “We knew you hadn’t noticed,” Sirius said softly, biting back a smile. “Remus is my husband Harry.”
“Do you want a wand or not you prat?” Harry said, rolling his eyes with a smile. He opened up another box and passed the wand to Draco. “Elms wood, thirteen and a half inches, dragon heart string.” Draco held it lightly this time, not wanting splinters in his hand. Nothing happened.
“Will you be staying there with me?” Draco asked. He wasn’t too keen on staying in a place he didn’t know by himself.
Andromeda looked at Draco who shook his head, and then looked back at Lupin. “Time for a trip down memory lane.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy sighed and flung his arms over the arms of the armchair and leaned back. “Not yet,” he said. “It needs to be autumnal, obviously, or else it will clash with the colours of the season,” he explained, and Harry nodded.
,” he insisted, not having the strength to argue with her over this. He had been studying for his Healer exam that was coming up, though he wasn’t sure how he’d ever pass at this rate. It took him a few years but when he was accepted onto the Healer apprenticeship scheme, he was so happy he almost cried as he told Pansy – though she still swears dying would be less painful than letting Draco give her medical attention.
“What?” Harry asked, certain he’d misheard. Sirius had never corrected Harry when he said he only had one Godfather.
As they pulled away from each other, Harry couldn’t help but grin as Draco blinked repeatedly, apparently speechless. He raised his finger, as if about to speak, but Harry beat him to it. “Should I go pay for these?” he asked, gesturing to the books floating a few feet from them.
His father had always scoffed at his mother’s insistence that he learn the constellations; she said it was a Black tradition and she’d be damned if it was going to die with the family name.
“That’s why I used to hate it, it seemed so
- I’m sure -
“It’s great for healing but also curses,” he elaborated. “And Unicorn Hair cores can disintegrate if they are forced to do any form of darker magic. Basically, your wand shouldn’t exist.”
“It’s still – still, une très, très longue distance,” Scorpius nodded, grabbing Draco’s hand as they opened the door and the bell dinged.
!” Harry bit his lip, trying not to grin. “It seemed logical at the time,” he muttered.
This made Ted smile. “You’re a smart lad,” he said, clapping Draco on the back. “That’s exactly the question to ask.”
As he was glancing around the shop’s interior, he saw a small boy with curly black hair. His skin was a warm brown, but was a little ashen, as if he was overwhelmed, or hadn’t been outside much lately. The boy pushed open the door – hopefully Draco would be able to talk with him and distract himself from his own nervous itching. The boy’s hair fell just above his eyes, and he looked like he wanted to hide behind it. Draco, however, failed to notice this.
?” Draco asked, pretending to be shocked. Of course, he already knew this information, but he wanted to make his son believe he didn’t. “And you learnt all of this yesterday?”
Draco snorted. “
“Being surrounded by like-minded people helps,” Harry agreed. “It helps,” he muttered, quickly shaking his head. “So, tell me, what
“Then there’s Hufflepuff,” Draco continued. “Their house colours are yellow and black, and they’re known for valuing patience, hard-work, loyalty but also for being the house that accept anyone,” he said, watching the boy as he looked fascinated by what Draco was saying. “Then, there’s Slytherin,” Draco said, with a sigh. “It’s probably where I’ll go – my whole family has been in this house for generations – anyway, they wear green and silver and they value ambition, resourcefulness and cunning.”
“I told him he’d have to obliviate me,” Harry grinned. “Also, it happened after the Befuddlement Draught. He was just as shocked as I was, I think.”
“Don’t be so dramatic,” Harry smiled.
Scorpius grabbed the whisk with both hands and slowly began to stir the mixture. “Ah, I see,” Harry nodded. “You’re very good at that,” Harry said, smiling at the blond child.
Draco, after a moment of hesitation, shook Sirius’ hand. “Not if you’re going to hug me,” he replied, making Sirius laugh.
“Pretty much,” Harry shrugged, still smiling. He rarely noticed how much he would smile around Draco. “How is Scorpius anyway?” he asked, despite only having seen him two day’s prior.
Lupin rubbed the back of his neck. “I can’t say for sure, perhaps to feed into the crazed idea they want the media to have of him?” he offered, apprehensively. Draco couldn’t tell if it was due to a lack of confidence in the idea, or because of the presence of Harry.
Harry shook his head. “It’s better if he stays with you Andie,” Harry said. He wanted to take Teddy in, but he also knew he was in no position to raise a child, and it would be unfair to Teddy. “But I really will visit more, I promise.”
Except this time, it was different – he wanted to get to know Malfoy, not figure out if he was connected to some evil scheme. He wanted to make Malfoy laugh or see him smile or start a petty argument about whether or not seven teaspoons of sugar is too much for a single cup, just so that Malfoy would give his speech on the correct sugar to tea ratio.
and I didn’t know -"
“It looks so calm outside,” Harry sighed, leaning his head against the window.
“You’re
“And remember to pronounce where you want to go, properly,” Teddy added, giggling as Harry glared playfully at him.
Harry sighed. “I’m not going to tell you everything Draco’s told me, but,” he paused, thinking. “There’s a lot that he’s
He wasn’t able to finish his sentence as Pansy leaped out of her seat to smother him with her arms so he would be unable to continue his sentence. Blaise was currently helping neither of them, he had decided to sit in a fit of laughter.
“Who’s it from?” Teddy asked, a mouth full of toast.
Harry shook his head. “I’m not alone,” he replied, wondering how far Draco had wandered and whether he decided to give the three of them some space for a moment.
This only made Draco laugh harder. “Who knew you were so easily flustered Potter,” he teased, and Harry now saw this, as a challenge.
“You do,” Sirius replied. “But it’s still unfair,” he said, his eyes filled with the same look his aunt had given him. “And it’s confusing, messy, a downright
“Apparate!” he exclaimed, jumping up in the air. “Grandma never lets me side-along,” Teddy complained.
find you intolerable Harry, never mind Snape,” Draco smirked as Harry opened his mouth to protest, but grinned instead.
, he added in his head, but he wasn’t sure that was something he should tell either of them. Not only was Harry uncertain about his sexuality, but it was with
“But I thought you hated me!” Harry exclaimed, still trying to wrap his head around this.
“Dad! Daddy!” Scorpius exclaimed, trying his best not to jump up and down. “Are they ready yet?” he asked, his eyes so filled with excitement, that his father laughed.
“I appreciate the concern Draco, but well,” Harry said with amusement as he caught up with the man. “Do you think
“Can I kiss you?” he asked, unable to stop himself. He saw a blush creep across Harry’s face. “I’m sorry, that was inapprop-“
” he said, finding it harder and harder to look at Harry, who seemed to be rather unfazed.
It turned out that the entrance to the back of the shop was just a seemingly random door in between trees. The back room was filled with boxes of all different sizes and a workbench. To the right-hand side was a fireplace.
“Hey!” Harry exclaimed. “I seem to remember that lesson led to me being the youngest seeker in just over a century,” he said.
have to point out that you’re wrong,” Andromeda challenged, raising an eyebrow. “I’d say the two of you are rather moonstruck with each other.”
The odd thing about the Black Manor was that it seemed to guide you to where it believed you should be. The walk from the kitchen to his room earlier that day had felt incredibly short to Draco, but when he wished to find the kitchen again, he found himself in the bathroom.
Harry shrugged, a smile tugging at his lips. “You’ll see,” he said. Harry had spent a good while trying to figure out where to go on a date with Draco. His denial to give Draco the satisfaction of knowing where they were going
He should have known it wouldn’t stay secret.
Thankfully, Draco appeared to have an idea to distract him. “The cupcakes should have cooled by now mon cœur, do you want to go and get one?”
Draco lifted Scorpius off his lap and sat him back down on the window seat. “So, which one will I be trying first?” he asked with a small smirk as Harry fumbled to open the box.
“Yes, thank you,” she said, smiling as Harry placed the two cups of tea on the side, before enveloping Harry in a warm hug. “It’s good to see you Harry,” she said.
Ron shook his head. “That’s, somehow not as surprising as I thought it would be.”
Still in a bit of a daze, Draco nodded. “Yes,” he managed to say. “Yes we – books,” he said, and Harry chuckled.
“To win, you have to get a run and a set,” Sirius began to explain. “A run is three or four consecutive cards of the same suit, and a set is three or four cards of the same value, but different suits.” Sirius flipped over the card on the top of the deck, placing it between the three of them. “When it’s your turn, if you find the card in the middle useful, you can switch it for a card in your hand, if not, you can pick up from the deck, and either switch for one in your hand, or discard it to the middle.”
Draco flicked Harry’s forehead.
Which was when Draco turned his head and caught Harry staring. They both went slightly pink, but Draco (‘the git,’ Harry thought to himself) smirked, ignoring Harry and turning his attention back to Scorpius, who had decided that practising his magic by levitating small objects on the coffee table was more interesting than kitchen safety (Harry couldn’t blame him).
The branches of the Willow froze.
“Thank you, Harry,” Draco said sincerely. They held eye contact for a minute, but it felt like longer, until Scorpius came bounding into the kitchen, holding a stuffed dragon that was almost half the size of him.
“Don’t knock it till you’ve tried it Malfoy,” Harry said, wagging a finger at Malfoy who waved his hand dismissively.
Sirius sighed again. “I’ll talk to you later Cub, after I’ve talked to the Order about this, but stay at Hogwarts,” he instructed. “
Draco paused, sipping his hot chocolate. “I guess it feels like a living being,” he said. “There's a small pulse, like a heartbeat, and a warmth in some rooms, but a bone-chilling coldness in others.”
Draco sighed, deciding to give up on understanding why Potter was acting as he was. “No, a wizard is only supposed to own one wand for the duration of their life.” He looked back at Potter, who now seemed to be performing some spells over his wand. “And for what it’s worth, I’m sorry.”
His legs felt like he’d been hit with the
Harry sighed, nodding. “He told me,” Harry admitted, and this was the first time both of the Slytherin’s lost their composure.
“That’s nice,” Potter said sincerely, a small smile pulling at the corners of his mouth. “Could you perform some basic magic? So, I can see what’s wrong.”
Draco smiled at his son. “It’s something that was unplanned and sudden ma petite étoile,” he whispered back, kissing the top of his head before turning back to Pansy. “Besides, you like this job.”
“He insisted that
“What do you want me to say Ron?” Harry snapped, glad for the loud buzz of activity in the common room. “That every summer I’m
?” Pansy asked as Draco ordered some tea.
Harry rolled his eyes. “You can’t put apples in cinnamon buns, it affects the texture of the pastry and it doesn’t rise in the oven correctly,” Harry said, blushing when Draco looked at him, in impressed confusion. “But I suppose you could add it to the cinnamon mix; it might still affect the pastry.”
“Harry!” someone exclaimed as he stepped through the portrait to the Gryffindor common room, practically tackling him to the ground with a hug. “You never came back to the lesson and Snape, the evil bastard, he wouldn’t let us look for you,” Ron, the apparent assailant, explained, talking almost as quickly as Hermione, the worry etched into his face. “Then
'coda
Harry shrugged, knowing Remus would see right through his lies.
“If you’re a Malfoy,” he sighed, and Harry felt his heart thump in his chest.
“You probably do without even noticing,” Draco said. “Have you ever been to the third floor?” he asked, his breath catching in his throat when he turned to look at Harry and realised how close they were.
“Ok,” Scorpius said, jumping from the stepping stool and skipping across the kitchen.
He felt his chest tighten.
you knocked him over?” she asked, kneeling in front of her daughter, and Rose pouted.
“I don’t mean it like that Harry, I just – you don’t look as tired,” she explained, and Harry furrowed his eyebrows.
Nodding, Draco picked up the book he was reading, waving it at Sirius. “It won’t read itself,” he joked, causing Sirius to smile and shake his head.
tried to see Harry, to confirm if the rumours were true, but he didn’t remember it, not really.
Harry froze halfway up the stairs to the boy’s dormitory.
“I’m glad to see you two are having fun,” Draco said behind Harry, almost scaring him out of his chair. “Your tea Harry,” he smiled softly, making Harry’s legs feel numb.
London was having an unusual spell of sunny weather, which meant that Harry had taken to walking home through the Muggle parts of London, revelling in the late afternoon sun. Harry enjoyed walking through the streets of London, particularly the Muggle streets of London, where he wouldn’t get recognised. Despite being almost thirty and managing to avoid being in the papers for the past five years, he still got recognised and praised by everyone he came across.
“It’s not just a gem?” Harry asked in disbelief, lifting his head.
Draco leaned over and read the passage. “It says ‘
werewolves are dangerous and evil.”
The trio spent the rest of the journey theorising about the Hogwarts feast, as well as the sorting ceremony. So far, they had come up with multiple theories, including (but not limited to)
“You read Muggle literature?” Harry asked, surprised Draco had never mentioned it.
“Don’t listen to them Harry,” Hermione insisted. Harry was still staring at the paper.
“Your father?” Harry asked, although it wasn’t much of a question. His head turned from the lake to look at Draco as he brushed at his face with the sleeves of his robes.
“It’s my fault,” Harry mumbled, choking on his words. “I couldn’t save him.”
“Are you asking me out for lunch Malfoy?” he asked with a sly grin as Draco rolled his eyes.
“Do you want to talk about it?” Draco asked, able to see Harry from the small amount of moonlight which poured in through the window.
“It’s all right,” Harry shrugged. “I’m sure I’ll hear enough about the books you read to know the story of some practically by heart,” he teased, and Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco chewed his thumb, before sighing. “Auntie Andie thinks it’s part of his plan, and I’m inclined to agree, although, what that plan is, I have
Draco nodded, the smirk widening into a smile. “He really tried not to tell me, but he was so excited,” he chuckled, and Harry couldn’t help but join in. “I’ve always wanted to go here,” Draco added. “It’s supposedly got everything,” he said, scanning his eyes over the building. It was an old Victorian building with ornate engravings on the stone and the brick. Harry had heard Hermione gush over the shop before, enthusing about its incredible collection.
He considered denying it, but he also had hoped to ask Draco to join him in Hogsmeade, if he was willing. “What do you know about my Godfather?”
“I can tell you really love him,” Harry smiled. Draco thought for a moment this meant Harry assumed he wouldn’t have loved his own son, but upon looking at Harry’s face, he can tell that’s not what Harry meant at all.
discrimination – it’s ridiculous that people fire them because they miss two days a month due to something, they have no control over,” Hermione explained with a sigh. “Then there’s the fact that even though the war was more than a decade ago, people still believe
“Yeah,” Draco said.
Sirius smiled softly. “So back to this kiss, did you really enjoy it
“I’d never break the sacred secrecy of tea.”
The noise deafened the sound of his own cries.
He blinked, “about what?”
“No, it’s not you either,” he assured before removing his glasses and rubbing the bridge of his nose. “Merlin,
“Will you take us sometime?” she asked, and Harry nodded.
“Can I look at it?” he asked, gesturing to the wand.
Harry watched as Draco's eyebrows furrowed. “You don’t seem happy about that.”
“Unable to act or think normally as a result of love, and the way both of you act when the other’s name is only so much as mentioned –
Harry nodded, smiling. “I might have not known her, but I believe she would be,” he grinned, feeling light in his chest as Draco grinned back.
– Harry.” Draco said with a small smile before flooing over to his mother’s place.
Before Harry could respond, Draco picked up another book and was suddenly enthralled by its contents. Harry had ensued many conversations about books in the past, but Hermione was more interested in factual books, and so this conversation was not one Harry had ever had before. He found himself falling for Draco’s passion.
“You’re insufferable.”
Taking a breath, Draco looked at Harry, to find him now staring at the lake. “Harry,” he said again, his words catching in his throat, then tasting sour on his tongue. “Can I –“ he began. “I need to know,” he breathed out, his breath hitching as his vision went hazy.
The memory of what Draco heard in the East Wing of the Manor was inescapable.
It wasn’t long before Malfoy returned, carrying a small tray. Upon the tray was a rather unusual looking teapot, covered in a mass of painted swirling leaves, curving around the handle, and a matching teacup with a silver tea strainer delicately balanced on top. There was also a tiny pot of a golden liquid Harry assumed was honey.
I’m fine,” he said, waving his hand and returning to his thoughts. His aunt gave him another look that he couldn’t figure out.
The boy sat, staring at his book for a moment with his eyebrows drawn together, before he stood, still clutching his book and walked towards Malfoy, who turned upon the arrival of the small boy at the counter. Malfoy smiled softly as the boy outstretched his arms, offering the book to Malfoy and pointing at its pages. Swiftly lifting who Harry believed he could safely assume was Malfoy’s son, onto the edge of the counter, Malfoy smiled again as the boy passed the book to him. Harry couldn’t hear the conversation, but he was guessing that the boy had come across a word he didn’t recognise.
“There actually
I’m a bit clumsy,” Harry said sheepishly as they traipsed their way down the steps of the tower.
They sat in silence for a minute, and Harry watched as Sirius struggled to give Harry the answer he wanted. Harry knew Sirius hated being trapped in Grimmauld place, but he needed to know Sirius was safe.
“Draco!” Pansy exclaimed, tackling him in a hug in the corridor. “It’s been
Draco couldn’t help but laugh. “
,” Draco let out an exasperated sigh as Pansy forced her way into his apartment, again – he had just managed to have a moment of time to relax and brew his tea too.
After a second of hesitation, Draco removed the cloak and folded it, passing it back to Harry. “Git,” he muttered with a smirk as Harry took the cloak.
Warily, Draco held her hands. “It isn’t?” he asked.
“They did what?” Sirius asked darkly, turning to Mr Weasley, who nodded. “I thought it was a simple underaged Wizardry charge?”
“I think we’ve found your wand,” Harry said, amused.
Draco waved his hand dismissively and he opened the box to check nothing was broken. “I’m fine, probably just distracted,” he said, though unsure. He didn’t feel any different but his connection to his wand suddenly felt weaker and he couldn’t come up with an explanation as to why.
“About the same,” Draco said, shrinking into his seat. “I still haven’t actually heard from my parents, and people keep asking me if – if
“Well, I’m going to pay you somehow Harry,” Draco protested.
The volume within the shop had gone up tenfold, however it took a while for Harry to notice as Scorpius was showing Harry the multiple drawings he had done. As Scorpius was showing him a drawing that he had done of the three of them (which melted his heart), Harry realised, that Draco – the stubborn bastard – was not going to ask for help, despite being on the verge of being unable to cope with the amount of work he had to do.
“We love you too Pans,” Blaise grinned.
“Exactly, my young pupil,” Draco said with smile, putting that book at the start of the collection. “Then, the second book is this one,” he said, pulling another book off the shelf. “This is about the correct ways to brew tea, and how to brew each individual type of tea,” he explained further, and Harry nodded along, finding himself enticed by Draco’s passion for tea as well as books.
“What’s basketball?” Ron asked, looking between Draco and Harry.
“Alright,” Hermione said, sipping from her coffee mug. “But just know that if Molly hears about this, she won’t let it go,” she smiled.
“I’ve been meaning to read this,” Draco said, his eyes scanning over the cover slowly. “It appears I have a thing for books with subtle gay undertones so this book always seemed like an appropriate choice,” he joked, and Harry couldn’t help but laugh.
, so the blond git who insults my glasses doesn’t seem like the worst of my problems. You were more of a nuisance.”
Harry knew what Sirius was telling him.
When Malfoy joined them again, his face was a deep crimson. Harry tilted his head, opening his mouth only to be interrupted by Malfoy. “No,” he said, pointing a finger at Harry, who raised his hands.
There was little Draco could clearly remember from his third year at Hogwarts, but there was something peaceful on that day by the lake. Blaise and Draco had just finished their end of year exams, Pansy had finished a few days prior, and they celebrated by raiding the kitchens and taking a picnic down to the lake. There was a spot, just by the wooden pier, that was filled with flowers in spring, and well hidden from sight in summer, when the leaves were their brightest shade of green.
Draco suddenly made a connection. “And you just want to be included,” he said, watching as Harry threw his head back into the sofa.
Malfoy took a deep breath, trying to regain some composure as they approached the pond. Scorpius looked at Harry, mirroring his confusion. “It’s the Nargles,” Scorpius said, completely convinced. Harry covered his spluttered laugh with a cough.
“Subtle?” Draco asked. “Subtle? Potter everyone in the Wizarding World knows I’m gay,” he said, looking at Harry accusingly.
Draco felt his heart sink. “So, it’s me then,” he muttered to himself, sinking into the pillows.
“We should do this again,” Harry said with a warmth in his smile.
“It doesn’t change anything,” Harry assuring with a curt nod.
Draco tried not to laugh (he truly did), but he couldn’t help himself. “Honestly Harry. You face the Wizengamot, and your thoughts are on Treacle tart?” he asked, raising an eyebrow.
“It’s good to know we have a dragon expert if we ever need one,” Draco said, earning a wide grin from Scorpius.
“Yes?” Draco asked, with an air of innocence.
Ron raised an eyebrow again, as if Draco might be tricking him. After a minute, he shrugged. “I guess you’re all right.”
“Mr Potter has
“If it’s not, we don’t ever have to apparate again,” Harry promised, watching as Teddy looked relieved at the promise.
“Harry,
“Besides you being able to use it, no, none,” he said, turning his head to glance out the window. “You’re not going to listen to anything else I say, are you?”
Scorpius glanced between the two of them, with a dramatic flair known only to those related to the Black family. “Have you come to see the ducks too?” he asked Harry, startling the two of them. Harry didn’t have the heart to say no.
“Board game, board game!” Hugo chanted, clapping his hands together.
“’Course you will,” Harry grinned.
to have someone
“Thank Merlin,” Harry muttered, pulling himself to his feet, making sure to pick up the book he had found as he did.
“Potter, are you listening?” Draco asked, grinning. Harry realised he had been staring at Draco with a positively lovestruck expression on his face.
“En effet ça l’est,” Draco said, smiling as Scorpius slipped into French.
Lupin sighed, a painful expression flickering on his face, like a candle flickers in the wind. “You know how he is; he
Draco blinked at the darkness, just about seeing a figure, edging its way towards his bed. The bed sank as Harry sat next to Draco, who offered his hand.
Draco knew there was nothing to be said about his parents outside of hollow promises, and he was grateful Cedric hadn’t assured him of something he would have no knowledge on. “Thank you,” he sniffed, rubbing his eyes with the hem of his robes.
“How old is he?” Harry asked, adding another spoonful of sugar to his tea.
Harry raised his eyebrows, but Ron spoke before he could. “Then
Harry nodded. “Promise,” he repeated, and Teddy let go of him so he could make them hot chocolate.
-----
Once they were outside, Harry felt Draco slip his hand back into Harry’s. “So, we’re in a relationship, are we?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow with a smile plastered on his face.
“Fair enough,” Sirius shrugged. “It’s nice to see the family tradition keeps going,” he grinned, running his fingers through his hair as Lupin guided them to the kitchen.
He rooted through his pocket, finding a photo. “I’m
-----
Even though tomorrow was the thirty-first of October, Harry felt at peace as he walked along the pavement, admiring the scattered Halloween decorations on the houses. Harry remembered when he spent Halloween in America and he was baffled by the frenzy that was caused by Halloween, but it was oddly charming. No one in London is particularly crazed about Halloween except the children who ran from house to house to get free sweets.
“Is that technically a board game?” Harry asked Hermione in a whisper, hoping she’d say no so he wouldn’t have to play it.
“J’ai besoin de parler à Potter pendant
He felt it shatter.
Draco snorted. “Good luck to anyone who thinks they can stop Harry,” he smirked, as Sirius raised an eyebrow at the comment. “If he thinks Madam Pomfrey won’t tie him to a bed in the hospital wing, he is a terrifying opponent.”
“You… tried to visit me?” Harry asked, puzzled.
“Ta petite étoile,” Scorpius added, heading back to the window seat, repeating the French nickname to himself.
Before Harry had to try Hermione’s potion, Malfoy tested his own potion, which only made Harry more anxious as Malfoy explained what the potion felt like. He described it as being as if his mind had been disconnected from his actions. The idea of having no control over his action worsened Harry’s fears.
With a laugh, Harry said, “Yeah, there is.” He fixed his glasses. “It’s incredibly difficult to argue with an enthusiastic eight-year-old,” he grinned.
,” Harry responded.
“Yes?” The boy said, daring Draco to make fun of him with his stare.
He opened his mouth to ask what the tea was, but Draco, once again, replied before he could ask. “Apple, rosemary and cinnamon.”
“Harry, one of my biggest regrets is that I didn’t help Regulus,” Sirius was staring intently at Harry. “He came to me with a cry for help and I ignored it.”
Except it was eerily quiet.
“Sirius,” Teddy repeated, pausing for thought. “
“I know I’m handsome but do show some decorum Harry,” he teased, before once again, wandering further into the shop. Harry was beginning to wonder just how big this shop truly was.
Brushing the soil off of his robes, Harry stood up and adjusted his glasses, noticing Draco had already cast a
Harry perked up. “Rummy is relatively easy,” he said, glancing at Sirius who nodded.
Harry smiled. “All right then,” he said, kissing Draco on the cheek. “It doesn’t change how I feel. We can figure it out, together.”
No, I don’t,” he said, scrunching his nose and looking horrified at the notion.
“I don’t know Auntie,” Draco admitted. He liked staying with Andromeda. “You’ll visit sometimes, right?” he asked, unwilling to admit that he would miss her too much if she didn’t.
“My body does not represent me in this case,” Draco shrugged, folding his arms and looking away from Harry. He hoped Harry couldn’t see his faint blush.
Draco nodded. “So, I shouldn’t ask about it?”
“Family tradition?” Draco asked, as he sat down at a table in the kitchen. The kitchen was much brighter than the corridor and had less of a blue hue. Draco assumed that due to the screaming portrait, they were unable to make changes to the corridor, but that didn’t stop them from making everywhere else in the house a nice place to live.
“It looks like those two are already best friends,” Draco joked, intertwining his fingers with Harry’s. Harry chuckled, rubbing his thumb over Draco’s hand.
He squeezed his eyes tight. “Personally, I was relieved,” she replied, and Draco peeked out of one of his eyes to see her smiling at him. “I left of my own fruition, and to receive that letter let me know the family wouldn’t ‘
“My dear Moony, I don’t believe we do.”

Draco shrugged. “It’s okay,” he said, sincerely meaning it. “So, do I have to go to a safe house?” he asked, and Andromeda sighed once more.
“The special ones from the silver tin?” Harry asked, trying to ignore the smile that tugged at his face as Scorpius’ eyes went wide.

Draco squeezed Harry’s hand tight and turned to face him. “And I’d miss another lesson if I needed to,” he said, staring at Harry with a ferocity that rivalled Hermione’s. “Harry, you are
“I was
He felt as if his ribs were trying to crush his lungs and he gripped the sides of the sink as if without them he would die.
“I can see,” Harry said, looking at Malfoy, amused. He already knew that Hagrid would love Scorpius when he went to Hogwarts.
“It is,” Harry replied, holding Draco tighter. “But we have each other.”
With a shrug, Harry brought his knees to his chest. “No point,” he mumbled, resting his head on his knees.
so he didn’t blind Draco, and stood on the tip of his toes to kiss the blond on the cheek. “You’re adorable,” he grinned, watching Draco go from pink to red.
“By that logic, you’re also my least favourite,” Harry replied, laughing as Sirius rolled his eyes.
The walk from the docks to outside the Great Hall was not as long as Draco would have assumed it to be, looking at the outside of the castle. The trio continued the walk with their arms linked, smiling and laughing, buzzing from the magic that emanated from within the very foundations of Hogwarts itself.
Draco cringed at the mixture of Harry’s casual mention of
Scorpius scrunched up his nose. “No, you’re not, you said Harry was annoying, but
He looked like he was about to faint or be sick.
“So where are we going on this mystery date?” Draco asked, as they wandered down the street, Harry’s fingers brushing against Draco’s. He wasn’t yet sure of how Draco would feel about holding hands in public yet.
He was lucky he didn’t wake Walburga’s portrait, as he flew down the stairs, almost slipping and gripping the bannister tight for balance.
and I never expected to not want to strangle him when we’re in the same room but also,” he paused, unsure of how to phrase his next thought. “I’d never thought about kissing a guy before and now,” he trailed off, hoping Sirius would understand what he was saying.
There was a loud crack which almost made Draco fall out of his seat,
“Don’t forget about the threats Potter,” Blaise called out, just as Harry reached for the door handle, and Harry bit back his laughter.
Draco thought it was cute.
“Do you want me to distract you? Tell you a story?” Draco asked, brushing his fingers through Harry’s hair.
“I also – I wanted to have more time to be able to spend with Teddy and, I was wondering – well, it was more like I had an idea and –“ he muttered, tripping over his words, unable to say what was on his mind.
“Good,” Andromeda nodded. “My nephew has taken quite a liking with you,” she added, sipping her tea as Harry felt his cheeks flush.
“Suit yourself, but you’re missing out,” Harry shrugged as he took a sip of what Draco could only assume was sugar water by this point. “You said you had Healer exams coming up?”
With a wide grin, Scorpius shook his head. “
“Are you trying to get rid of me Potter?”
Malfoy blinked at Harry; his eyebrows furrowed. However, it only lasted for a moment before he gently shook his head and passed Harry a teacup. “Peppermint tea,” he replied.
“If I promise to make a visit, will you leave me alone?” Draco asked hopefully.
“Apparently, this safe house is the same safe house that Harry’s been staying in, which means you’ll be able to greet him after his trial,” Andromeda said, finishing her tea.
The cry made Draco flinch, and his muscles tense, but then he saw a small smile on Harry’s face which, for some reason, made Draco want to cry.
“Why did Dumbledore bring you here?” Harry asked, as they sat on one of the sofas, where Draco could see the book he was reading earlier, perched on the table.
Harry had a lump form in his throat and nodded, heading straight to the sofa, feeling incredibly awkward. He wasn’t sure why he stayed, but a part of him believed it would be rude to walk in, see Malfoy, and then leave. Harry didn’t have anything else to do anyway.
Turning to look at Harry, Draco furrowed his eyebrows as they made eye contact. “Are you alright?” he asked, his concern only succeeding in making Harry’s realisation hit harder.
“It was bloody terrifying mate, especially when you know that’s what your –
“He’s a
“That’s irrelevant,” Sirius said, waving a hand dismissively. “But that’s also exactly why I’m your favourite.”
“I missed you mon amour,” Draco said softly, kissing Harry’s cheek.
Draco shook his head, supressing a smile. “Some people have never seen ghosts before Pansy,” he reminded her, folding his arms with a small smile. “Not everyone has a ghost in their attic.”
Realising his blunder, Sirius shook his head and Draco could feel Sirius’ eyes on him. “It means she has a plan; a plan she believes will result in the best outcome for
“And some chocolate cake,” Harry added with a smile. “I enjoyed it the last time.”
After crawling out of bed, he tip-toed across the landing and down the stairs, where he sat, trying to listen in. He could see Ted in the lounge, who caught his eye and brought a finger to his lips, before gesturing for Draco to join him.
“Yes!” he exclaimed, his face grimacing as he thought about what he just said. “And it’s Malfoy! Bloody
“I think it’s wonderful that you’ve spoken to someone besides us two,” Hermione said, a smile pulling at her lips as she looked at Ron, as if silently communicating with him.
The two spent another hour together in the café, neither noticing Pansy’s bemused glances at them. After they ate, they began to talk about everything the other didn’t know. Harry explained how he ended up being Ollivander’s apprentice and what it was like to raise Teddy whilst Draco talked about his life post war and raising Scorpius. They exchanged parenting tips and went into extensive detail about the annoyances of single parenting. The two made each other laugh without really trying, lighting up the café with smiles and warm feelings and once they began to feel more comfortable around each other, they began to return to old habits.
“Yes,” Harry said, with a solemn nod.
As soon as she left, a hum ran through the students as they discussed how they were to be sorted. Draco glanced at his friends to see Pansy was still advocating for her owl theory whilst Blaise was growing frustrated. Before he could intervene however, there was a scream, drawing their attention.
Draco shook his head. “As in, Professor Lupin?” he asked.
“Regretfully, yes I am.” Draco refused to look at the amusement on Potter’s face. “For professional reasons of course, I desperately need a wand if I’m to pass,” he clarified.
Draco nodded, still curled up, but his head now resting on his knees rather than hiding behind them.
Harry chuckled. “Well, I missed you too Ladon,” he told the plushie with a smile.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows and began to laugh, biting his lip to try and stop himself. “Do you pay attention
“Where am I taking this?” Harry interrupted, a small smile tugging at the corner of his mouth when Draco looked visibly relieved.
“Besides the outburst that made it into the Prophet, no,” Harry said, examining his hands in his lap as if he’d never seen them before.
When Teddy had first left for Hogwarts, Harry had been left feeling lost, alone and unsure of what he should be doing. A few weeks after Teddy’s departure, Ron noticed that Harry was drifting, slowly, into a zombie-like state and his lack of, well, anything, scared everyone for a moment.
“I wondered too ‘Mione, but he hasn’t asked me about
“That was not at all what I was asking Potter,” he replied, suddenly very interesting in his forgotten teacup.
“Honestly, some people,” Hermione sighed. “Did he seriously think you wouldn’t ask any questions?”
It always left Harry’s ears ringing for the next few hours.
“What?” Harry asked, concerned.
,” he whispered, knocking his head against the window.
“Not as much as it used to,” Harry replied, hugging his knees.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Git,” he muttered, smiling. “Just tell me if the essay's any good.”
“You’re an idiot Potter, you should have known. My mother is a Black, and Black’s are French,
Harry was surprised. “Really?”
Ron waved him off dismissively. “No, not that. Now
Draco rolled his eyes before turning to his son. “It’s because I’m a star mon petitou,” he replied, causing Harry to laugh that soft laugh again. Scorpius clapped his hands together.
“Aren’t I too old to be called that?” Teddy groaned.
Once Sirius pulled away from Harry, he heard Draco whisper in his ear, almost inaudible, “Cub?” teasingly, and Harry elbowed the empty space, smirking when he felt his elbow connect with Draco under the cloak. “Merlin’s Mother Potter, you’ve got sharp elbows,” Draco groaned, still under the cloak. Sirius and Remus both raised their eyebrows at the sound of another voice, and Harry knew they had already guessed who it was.
“Sap,” Draco muttered, picking another tart from the box.
Remus’ eyes widened. “Surely he –
“Gripping,” Harry said, biting his lip.
Using the little self-restraint he could, Draco waited for Harry to react before hugging him, and when he rested his head on Draco’s shoulder, he froze, for a split second, but then he wrapped his arms around the boy. The boy who had gone through so much the past few weeks, and, by the looks of it, was yet to express a real emotion about it.
Harry felt another scream bubbling in his throat at the accusation. Now he wasn’t sure that he would be able to stop himself from punching Malfoy, much less destroying the classroom. “I wouldn’t kill anyone,” he growled, directing his wand at Malfoy.
,” he chuckled nervously, and Harry raised an eyebrow at Malfoy. “Fine, Potter, yes. Merlin, you are the most annoy –“
“Why would that –“ Harry’s words were interrupted by his thoughts as he realised what Malfoy was saying. “You
Draco pulled Harry into a hug. “There was
what he said); he told Sirius about Malfoy’s strange behaviour; he told Sirius about the kiss and he told Sirius about Malfoy’s warning.
“I get the feeling it’s impossible to say no to Scorpius,” Harry chuckled, feeling his heart skip a beat as Malfoy laughed too. “Besides, I have never once visited the ducks, they must be feeling bloody
“Ron, please, I don’t want to have to explain myself again,” Harry insisted with a sigh.
Harry shook his head at Draco, furrowing his eyebrows as he let out a shaky laugh. “Aren’t you the Hufflepuff?” he asked, making Draco groan again.
“Table six, in the far corner,” Draco said, pointing in the direction Harry needed to take it.
“It’s only been three months Pansy, let him breathe,” Blaise scolded, but he was smiling. “Excited?” he asked.
“Apologise then, I don’t care!” She threw her hands up in frustration. “You can’t go on like this,
Hermione rolled her eyes, her face heating up. “Well, if either of you paid attention in charms, you’d realise we learnt that warming spell last Tuesday,” she scolded.
“I promise I’ll visit more,” he replied. It was the same hollow promise Harry had been making for the past two years.
“But I’ll let you know, somehow,” he smiled, and Harry felt his heart skip a beat.
The blond nodded. “That

Harry started to blink furiously, whether to stop himself from crying or because he couldn’t understand Draco’s sentiment, he didn’t know. Draco hadn’t ever considered that Harry was at fault, which made him wonder who had.
Harry blinked. “Remus’,” he grinned, as the dog seemed to protest that answer (at least Draco

Harry couldn’t help the laugh that escaped his lips as he placed the Sickles on the table. “I’ll see you soon I guess,” Harry smiled, waving at Scorpius as he stood to leave. Scorpius waved back enthusiastically. “It was weirdly
Scorpius nodded, turning to look at Harry. “But every day,” he said, smiling. “Because you’re nice and you make Daddy smile,” he added with an adorable innocence that melted Harry’s heart.
“Some days more than others I’ll admit,” he sighed. “The times I miss her the most are when I see her in Scorpius. The way he finds the good in everyone, how he thinks animals are better company than people, the way he smiles.”
“I hope he didn’t bother you ma’am,” Malfoy smiled, charming the old lady on the bench, who blushed.
They spoke about quidditch and the ministry and tea and growing old despite not even being thirty. The ease of the conversation should have worried or at the least concerned Harry, but he couldn’t bring himself to care.
“Sounds like a keeper then,” Ron grinned, and Hermione elbowed him in the stomach.
He hummed in recognition. “So, you’re just an idiot?” Draco deadpanned, a smirk twitching at the corner of his mouth.
They spent the next hour combing through that bookshelf, in the hopes of finding the book of tea, stealing glances at each other. Draco’s pile of books had grown from two, to five in the space of ten minutes and Harry was beginning to wonder if all book lovers were as mad as each other. With a groan, Harry flopped onto the floor, stretching his back. He had been crouched to look at the lower shelves for too long. “There are too many books,” Harry complained, and Draco looked at him, very clearly amused.
Hermione smiled and whilst Ron looked confused, he did appear to be amused at Harry’s smitten behaviour. “What about, his
“It’s not all right,” Harry insisted, also waving to Scorpius. “You’ve done so much since the war to become a better person,” Harry said, glancing at Malfoy, and they both blushed a faint pink as they made eye contact. Harry coughed, looking away. “And I’m sure anyone who knows Scorpius would agree.”
Taken off guard, Draco scrambled to his feet, just reaching Harry as he began to laugh. It was the sort of laughter that made your blood run cold, your bones rattle inside you.
Harry shook his head. “You’ve mentioned him before but nothing else.”
Blaise laughed as Pansy groaned. “You’re a sap Draco, honestly,” she complained, grinning, nonetheless. “Wait a minute,” she said, stealing a quick glance behind her, and Draco knew she had seen his scar as Harry brushed his fingers through his fringe. “
“Me neither,” Draco replied, watching the lake, occasionally flickering his eyes towards Harry, who was staring right at Draco.
Harry felt sick and dizzy, his vision spotty. He knocked his glasses off as he pressed the heels of his palms into his eyes, hoping that would fix his vision. He could just about hear the door opening and someone calling his name.
“And apparently if Norwegian Ridgeback’s scales start to turn a different colour, it means that they need to spend more time in the sun, but that can be really difficult because –“
, no” Harry interrupted, smiling into his hand. “Sorry, it’s just, I don’t think you know how effortlessly attractive you are,” he admitted, biting back a smile as Draco looked bemused. He watched as the realisation dawned upon his face and his cheeks went rosy.
Draco smirked. “You’re standing in the middle of the shop, looking rather perplexed.”
Harry chuckled and left Malfoy to his own devices, walking to his seat and taking in the faint scent of cardamom and apples, which Harry had learnt was Malfoy’s favourite tea, as he was constantly sipping on a cup – that and the teashop always smelt faintly of apples or cardamom.
“I need some air,” Harry said, picking up his bags, he hadn’t had a chance to put them in the Boy’s Dormitory yet, and he didn’t want to leave them there.
Malfoy hummed, turning back around.
Draco chuckled. “I’ll come to you if I need any help then,” he smirked, letting go of Harry’s hand to return to the counter.
Draco chuckled, “of course.”
“The twelfth?” Draco asked. “That’s Harry’s trial,” he said, now wondering if he’d be able to talk to Harry at all before school began.

Hermione's face softened. “And what did you say?”
Harry felt a smile push at his lips at thought of Teddy as he stared at his ceiling.
in contact with each other.
“That makes sense,” he muttered.
Sirius raised an eyebrow. “Not yet, Moony’s late, probably due to the full moon in a few days,” he muttered, shaking his head. “Has the Prophet written an article about you again?” he asked his voice filled with concern. He knew Harry was quite resilient with the Prophet’s articles, but no one is invincible.
Trying to calm his nerves, he took a deep breath, swallowing as much pride and fear as he could before he walked into the shop. A little bell dinged over his head as he entered, and to his delight, he wasn’t hexed or asked to leave the moment he stepped foot in the shop. In fact, he had no greeting as he entered the shop, it looked deserted. He almost yelped in surprise when he saw a tree branch in front of him. Potter had appeared to turn his shop into a mini forest.

Harry wrapped the silky fabric around his body, and chuckled as Draco’s jaw went slack, his lips parting and his eyes shining. “Holy Salazar and Merlin,” he whispered, pausing to choose what question to ask first. “And this was your Dad’s?”
“Do you ever think about life after this oncoming war?” Harry asked, leaning back into the sofa, staring at the ceiling.
Harry smiled, kneeling down to accepting Scorpius’ handshake.
Harry copied Draco, doing as he instructed until he no longer felt as if he was going to pass out and his breathing felt easier than before. He picked up his glasses and Draco was no longer a blurry blob.
are a good person Malfoy, that’s why I forgave you – you bettered yourself.”
he wouldn’t make you go back there if he knew?”
He flinched as he heard a voice begin to speak.
“I told asked him to meet me here for lunch – oh don’t look at me like that Pansy,
“Yeah,” Harry called back, shuffling the deck.
Sirius raised an eyebrow. “You can

but Dumbledore…”
“But we love you so much and we can’t wait to see you at Christmas and hear all about it.”
“Golden boy Potter,” Draco said with a small smile, shaking his head.
“You know Mum’s going to invite him to the Burrow now,” Ron told him. “And there’s no avoiding it.”
Draco hummed, his hand still running through Harry’s hair. “At least you won’t be with those arseholes who
Harry,” he emphasised, smiling back.
The two walked in silence, with the occasional chuckle as they stumbled over roots or Draco bumped his head on the roots hanging from above. The tunnel was smaller than Harry remembered it being, perhaps he had grown more than he realised over the past two years. It was still uncomfortably damp and dirty, but thankfully, Draco knew a cleaning spell ‘
“She’d be so happy with the man you’ve become, and with the way you’ve raised Scorpius,” Harry said strongly.
Harry tried to persuade Draco to go eat, but he refused to leave Harry by himself – “You’re a hazard Harry, you attract trouble. I’m staying with you.”
Teddy shook his head, sitting at the kitchen table. “I don’t think you have,” he said, glancing around the kitchen and at the teapot on the side.
“You wish,” he replied, stepping into the hole, and disappearing. Harry quickly followed suit and was thankful Draco had moved out of the way as he landed in a heap at the bottom of the hole.
“Yes well, if you want the
Harry felt his heart melt. “He’s technically only made of smoke,
“My cousin, Sirius Black,” she said, preparing for Draco to panic and exclaim that this was ridiculous.
“Tell me that doesn’t look like a dragon on a broomstick,” Blaise challenged, making Draco burst into a fit of giggles, turning his head to look at Pansy who appeared to be using every bit of self-restraint not to throttle him, or at the very least, scream.
, which meant he had to uphold the traditions.” Harry wondered why he was talking to him about this. “But he didn’t want to,” Sirius grinned.
Harry took it, squeezing tight.
Harry was an Auror.
“Much more important,” Harry grinned, unable to stop himself. “Is that what your Dad wanted you to show me?” he asked, certain that it wasn’t.
“Ah, yeah, that,” Harry said, unable to come up with a way to respond. He sighed. “Some people seem to be unable to move on.”
“Florean?” Draco asked, curious.
“My nephew, Draco, how long have you been visiting his shop?” she asked again, grinning as Harry felt himself blush.
“Is it already lunchtime?” Draco exclaimed, scrambling to his feet. “Sorry Harry, I promised my friends I wouldn’t be long,” he apologised, his heart sinking as Harry’s face dropped. “But it was nice to talk to you both, I hope we can be friends,” Draco smiled, waving goodbye as he squeezed past the trolly lady, quickly making his way back up the train.
“The first time always is,” Harry assured him, giving him a once over to see if he was physically hurt or splinched. “You made it in one piece though,” Harry grinned, as Teddy stuck his tongue out at Harry.
“You, Potter, are a right git, you know that?” he said, sounding annoyed, but his expression showed a fondness that made his knees weak, so much so, that Harry was glad he was sat down.
“I will fight you,” he said, his eyes lit with the same fire Draco had seen in their first year. “Now play, give me the Queen of Diamonds,” he commanded.
Potter nodded, “I like to know my customers to make sure they get the right wand.”
Before Draco could answer, there was a tapping at the hatch to the attic. “Is that you Harry?” a voice called.
“You actually fly on brooms!” Harry exclaimed; his eyes wide. “Sorry,” he replied, instantaneously.
Taking a shaky breath, Harry willed his body to climb the rest of the stairs and rooted around the bottom of his trunk for the mirror shard.
“And you can tell me tomorrow when you’re not as tired,” Harry assured, watching as Teddy’s hair slowly turned back to its natural colour – a sandy brown, almost exactly the same colour as Remus’ hair – which was an indication of how tired he was. “How about I order take-out and we watch TV,” he suggested. “Then tomorrow you can tell me
It was then, that there was a knock on the compartment door, followed by someone calling out to them. “Anything off the trolly dears?” the old lady asked, and Harry’s eyes lit up like the stars on a clear night.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows. “Why?” he asked, flinching as Andromeda yelled something about how Dumbledore hasn’t cared for the boy once in the past decade. Draco had no idea who that boy was, but he could take a guess. He had mentioned to Andromeda about Harry’s isolation over the past month.
“Er – right, sorry,” Harry said, quickly stepping inside and closing the door behind him.
“Really!” Teddy exclaimed, leaning forwards over the table. “Grandma won’t let me anywhere near there.”
He felt his stomach flutter, as if he had swallowed a Golden Snitch.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Doesn’t mean
“Do you know what Samhain is about Harry?” Draco asked, handing him the teacup.
“I – I know that,” Draco sniffed, turning his head from Harry’s amused gaze.
With a wide grin, Harry linked his finger’s with Draco’s, who hadn’t noticed they were holding hands yet. “I did,” he replied. “I’ve been finding excuses for years, but I’m
“No, it’s OK,” Draco said, with a tentative smile. “We should have talked about it.”
“Who?” Teddy asked, furrowing his eyebrows.
“Remus is coming too?” Hermione asked, astonished.
Once, Harry got catapulted into the ceiling after setting off one of these pranks and Draco told him that he had, had similar experiences.
Harry grinned. “I’m glad you don’t feel sick,” he said, and Teddy nodded.
“Would Sirius be a better person to ask?”
been an attempt to redeem the family name, why disappear from the wizarding world?
Harry pulled at his hair. “You can’t just –“ he bit back a frustrated cry and forced himself to look at Malfoy, who was leaning against the wall that framed an open air archway, an air of nonchalance surrounding him. “
,” he told the peacocks, who stared intently back at Draco. It was what he’d spent his whole life waiting to learn. He was sat underneath a tree near the peacock housing.

,” Draco said, noticeably dishevelled, as if he ran here. “When you fell to the floor I – I wanted to leave but she wouldn’t allow it, not after Weasley and Granger. Are you all right, what happened?” he asked, one hand on Harry’s shoulder as the other brushed Harry’s hair from his eyes, resting on Harry’s cheek.
Harry sat up, alert. “OK,” he nodded, and Draco took a deep breath.
Harry shrugged. “Better than the Auror life,” he admitted, and George let out a bark of laughter.
came up with that idea,” Pansy grinned, shaking her head. “
Harry shrugged, rubbing the back of his neck. “I mean, it seemed like you
“Hello,” Draco said, smiling at the Healer. “What if I promise to be
“Of course, you sod, you’ll go spare without me,” Draco smirked, kissing Harry’s cheek. “You’ll trip over everything in a five-foot radius,” he joked, and Harry tried to act offended but part of him knew it was true.
“Hey, hey, take a breath Cub,” Sirius said, placing down whatever it was he was holding. “As you can see, I’m not at the Ministry, however that dream…” he muttered, his eyebrows drawing together.
In front of the Professor’s table was a stool, and atop the stool was a dusty, old hat. Draco tilted his head as he stared at the hat, and saw he wasn’t the only first year to be confused.
“I’m distracting, am I?” Harry grinned, leaning towards Draco, who looked at Harry, exasperated.
Draco nodded returning to his book before he processed what Kreacher said. “What!?” he exclaimed, running from the library. “Thank you Kreacher!” he called out as he left, skidding on the floorboards.
Draco thought for a moment. He had briefly wondered what his life would be like when he became a Healer, but he hadn’t gone into great detail. “I’m going to spend more time with Scorpius, and probably my mother. I want him to know that in my life, he always comes first,” he said slowly, not sure if he should go into much more detail.
“Much to my disappointment you are indeed,” Malfoy said lazily. “If you’d like your tea at some point today you prat, I suggest you go and sit down.”
“I was going to say it was good but I guess that works too,” Harry teased making Draco gasp.
Diagon Alley was less crowded than it once had been, but Draco could see that Scorpius still wanted to be on his shoulders and it was difficult to resist his son’s pleading expression. As they walked back up to the Leaky Cauldron, Draco realised he would have to tell Pansy that she was right – a conversation he wasn’t looking forward too.
Harry grinned. “Why? Will you miss me if I say no?” he teased, biting back a chuckle as Malfoy rolled his eyes.
Normally, this would have pleased Harry – in fact, a week ago, he would have given anything for Malfoy to leave him alone, but when he wanted to talk to the git, it was infuriating.
Feeling his own anger rise, Draco took a deep breath as he noticed Harry pressed at his side, leaning on him ever so slightly.
As he was waiting, Harry took another look at the decorations. “Preparing for Halloween tomorrow?” he asked, wondering what the Malfoy Halloween traditions were.
“But it’ll be dangerous for you Sirius!” Harry insisted. “And you too Remus.”
“There’s a war arriving,” Draco muttered. “And I won’t know if she’s okay, all because my parents are too cowardly to choose me over some lunatic,” he spat, curling up into a ball on his chair. His aunt had already written to him. He wasn’t sure how she knew what was happening, perhaps his mother had written to her instead of to him. She wrote that if he needed her, all he had to do was write a letter and she’d pick him up from the platform.
“They were all in Gryffindor?” Draco asked, curious to see it wasn’t just a theme within Slytherin. This question made Harry jerk his head up to look at Ron.
mistake,” Snape continued, earning a few sniggers from the other side of the classroom where the Slytherins resided. “You can test Miss Grangers potion, after a blatant attempt to avoid it.” Harry glared at Snape, wanting to tell him where he can shove his comments, but Ron stomped on his foot, yet again.
He looked so peaceful.
“Harry –“
“I’m not sure how spontaneous it would be if you’re here talking about it,” Draco added, not even glancing at her as he stacked away plates with the flick of his wrist. Pansy was about to flip him off until she remembered Scorpius and settled on a glare.
When he noticed a flickering of blond hair, Harry signalled the other boy over.
Draco nodded. “I get that too,” he said, and Sirius chuckled.
“I see you met Hilda and Beth,” Draco said, sipping his tea.
“My family was not happy with the hat’s decision,” he said with a shrug, smiling sheepishly at Harry. He scratched at the back of his hand, pretending to be really interested in it.
“I figured that if you ever quit your job as an Auror, you’d want to spend more time with Teddy,” she grinned. “Honestly Harry, I’ve been telling you for years he wants to live with you, his Dad,” Andromeda said, exasperated.
With an amused shrug, Harry said, “I blame the Hogwarts treacle tart.”
The lack of any answer from Harry, lead to an audible sigh from Draco and Harry felt something curl around his fingers. He glanced down at his hand, but couldn’t see anything. “Yes Potter, I’m holding your hand,” Draco whispered, sounding exasperated, but Harry was certain he was blushing. “You clearly have too much pride to admit you’re nervous about this.”
Harry waited a moment before he said, “I think he overheard something.”
-----
“If that’s still all right with you,” Harry grinned, tousling Teddy’s hair.
-----
Sirius shook his head, his grin staying firmly on his face. “Told me so himself in my seventh year, he cornered me in-between lessons and told me everything. He pretended to be everything our parents wanted because he knew it would be bad if he didn’t. Then he told me that they expected him to take the mark,” he said solemnly.
Sirius gave Draco a brief tour of the house, showing him to his room, the bathroom – Draco didn’t feel the need to know where anything else was; if he needed it, he’d find it.
“Master Sirius has a call, sir,” Kreacher said as he appeared in the same room as Sirius, tossing the mirror shard to the ground, but thankfully Sirius caught it before it landed.
He brought his hand up to his mouth as he choked back a sob, which echoed off the walls of the bathroom.
“I’m teasing,” he said, messing with the end of Harry’s hair.
. He was wearing a white button-up shirt with the sleeves rolled to his elbows, his dark mark on display. However, it was surrounded by a flower Harry couldn’t name, and the flowers circled the mark, as if trying to replace it or suffocate it. Harry assumed that was the point. Malfoy looked healthy, not anything like the sickly pale boy he had seen during the trials. If it had been anyone other than Malfoy, Harry would have smiled.
“Really?” Draco asked, his eyes snapping up to meet Harry’s.
“You won’t have to go back there Cub,” Remus assured. “Just because we don’t have custody of you doesn’t mean you can’t live with us,” he smiled, and Sirius’ head perked up.
is wrong, why are you so unfocused?”
“For purely selfish reasons,” Draco admitted. He may not remember trying, but he knew his reasoning. If anyone knew about his father, it would have been Harry, and the curiosity had been eating at his stomach.
Malfoy looked at Harry with an amused glint in his eye. “We accept Galleons Potter,” he said. “The tea is seven Sickles.”
“I’m not sure,” he said honestly. “And if I did? Would that be bad?” Harry challenged, and Ron shook his head.
That is, until Teddy had been sent a letter. Andromeda had insisted afterwards that they keep their regular meetings, completely unrelated to Harry’s emotional state, supposedly – though Harry knew that wasn’t the case.
“I haven’t,” Harry shrugged. “Doesn’t mean I can’t bake,” he grinned, taking another bite from his cinnamon bun.
, I will find a way to kill that man one of these days,” she muttered, rubbing the bridge of her nose, and then her temples. “I assume you two overheard that?” she asked, bracing herself for the answer.
“And 200 feet is like,” he paused, thinking. “That’s like miles and miles and
“It’s lovely to see you again Draco, I hope those books I gave you didn’t get you in any trouble, I haven’t seen you at all since your third year,” Remus smiled, placing a hand on Draco’s shoulder.
“Blaise, darling,” Pansy giggled. “Are you sure it isn’t just that you are
He poked his head around the door and found that it was the library. There was a giant window opposite the door, and the bookshelves were built into the walls of the room. It was two stories, with a staircase from the door down into the centre of the room, where a few tables stood, as well as sofas.
“I hope you don’t mind that I brought him along, my mother only just told me she couldn’t take him today,” Draco replied.
“Well it’s in the correct order now so yes, yes I am,” he grinned, picking up the books from Harry and, seemingly without hesitation, holding Harry’s hand again – it took everything within him not to grin like a lunatic, but Harry was pretty sure he was failing at it. “Oh for Merlin’s sake!” Draco exclaimed rather suddenly, almost causing Harry to jump out of his skin.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy, suck up that
Draco raised an eyebrow at him.
much?” Sirius teased and Harry buried his face in his pillow.
The rest of the day was filled with apple and cinnamon cupcakes and laughter. Harry couldn’t help but stare at Draco and he also couldn’t help smiling whenever he got caught. He noticed that Draco couldn’t help but smile either. Scorpius began to hum a tune that Harry vaguely recognised, and Draco, noticing that they were both humming along to each other, pulled out a record and began to play the song. The three of them danced around the living room and Scorpius’ giggles mixed with Draco’s carefree laughter made Harry realise how at home he felt.
“No one,” Harry said, sighing. “And then, I had that outburst in Potions and now it’s in the bloody papers and,” he paused, trying to control his breathing. “They can’t
Harry felt his mouth go dry. “I – I’m not – it’s,” he said, stumbling over his words.
Nodding, Harry drifted closer to Draco. “They’re incredibly beautiful,” Harry said, trying not to grin as he saw Draco’s eyes widen and he looked away.
“What about Granger and Weasley?” Draco asked, confused.
“I can’t imagine sending Moody would have been the best idea,” Lupin shrugged with a smile. “And he did offer.”
Potter,” Draco said, waving his hand dismissively. “Anyway, what I’m asking is, would you like to join us?” he asked.

“I don’t,” Harry smiled, sipping his tea as Scorpius grinned.
“For Merlin’s sake Draco, you haven’t cast any spells properly in over a
Deciding he would wake Harry in a moment, Draco closed his eyes – just for a second.
“Narcissa,” Andromeda glared. “Was that truly necessary?” she asked, placing a hand on Draco’s shoulder.
Harry nodded. “I think he’s mad at Dumbledore.”
“Sure Teddy Bear,” Harry said, laughing as Teddy stuck his tongue out at him.
“I’ll call you Harry on my death bed,” Parkinson deadpanned, and Zabini nodded. “And don’t you dare call me Pansy, there may not be any distain between us but it’s weird.”
He brought his hand up over his head and hurtled it towards the lake.
Scorpius groaned. “Mrs Drooble is – she’s,” he paused for a moment. “She’s – elle est si
, Mr Harry doesn’t mind, now –“
The shop really was nothing like it used to be. There was no lingering dust in the air and as Draco slowly walked further into the shop, he noticed it felt more inviting, like the feeling he got when he walked into the café Pansy worked at. Balls of orange light floated below the ceiling, just visible through the tops of the trees, somehow giving the entire shop a bright golden glow. There were window seats decked in red and gold cushions. ‘Still a Gryffindor at heart I see,” Draco thought to himself, amused. He looked into the forest to see if he could see the back wall, but all he could see was more trees. He wondered if Potter had put an extension charm on the shop to fit the forest in the shop.
Draco couldn’t help but smile at his aunt’s calm demeanour. He had noticed that she wasn’t pleased with the Order’s presence.
“It was nice meeting you too Scorpius,” Harry said, ruffling his hair and making Scorpius giggle. “And I’ll see you soon,” he said, looking at Draco with a small smile.
“I don’t
Harry nodded as if that made perfect sense, still biting back a smile.
“Harry, Harry!” Scorpius exclaimed, distracting Harry from Malfoy’s conversation. “Did you know that dragons don’t like ducks?” Scorpius explained as he began to head towards the pond.

“He’s decided to test your baking ability,” Draco explained, the corner of his mouth twitching upward.
Harry shook his head as he took the cup.
“What about if I do it with you?” Draco asked. “All you need to do is breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 7 and out for 8, can you do that with me?”
“I am,” Harry smiled back.
“Only with you, Draco,” Harry said in earnest, smiling when he saw Draco was now a similar shade of red.
“Hermione’s not wrong,” Harry muttered with a forced laugh. “And that sounds, actually that sounds great,” he grinned.
, stop pestering me and leave me be you git,” Malfoy shooed, making Harry roll his eyes.
Draco hummed in response. “That too. Anyway, you were saying?”
“Don’t thank

“Are we apparating again?” Teddy asked, wobbling on one foot as he jumped to another square stone. Harry placed a hand on Teddy’s shoulder to balance him.
“A bit?” Draco asked, a smirk still on his face.
,” Andromeda said, shaking her head with a tired smile. “How
Harry offered an arm to Teddy, who held on tight to Harry’s arm, bouncing on the heels of his feet. They apparated with a loud crack, drowned out by the whistles of the trains in the station. The two of them landed in the kitchen of Grimmauld Place, Harry grabbing Teddy’s arm as he almost slipped on the kitchen tiles.
Remus raised an eyebrow at the mention of the Malfoy’s name, and turned to Sirius who shrugged, indicating he would explain later.
, you nitwit, drinking the potion.”
The rest of their supermarket trip was filled with Harry relaying what he could remember about the Marauders pranks. He told Teddy about the least problematic ones (as he didn’t think a Muggle supermarket was the best place to explain why there was such a heavy prejudice against Slytherin in the 70s), which included ones where Remus and James charmed the portraits to sing David Bowie songs on repeat and where Sirius decided it would be fantastic to charm James’ shampoo to dye his hair bright pink, leading to the following Marauder’s prank war of 1976.
“I’m –“ Harry was going to say he was fine. “Have you read the Prophet yet?” he said instead.
“Obviously,” Harry said, having no idea what Malfoy was on about.
This made Draco pause.
“I can tolerate you more than others Potter,” he said, making the other blush. “Also, you were eaves dropping?” he said, raising an eyebrow as Harry once again tried to justify himself.
on someone,” Draco interrupted, ignoring Harry, who continued to shrink into the sofa as Scorpius giggled. “Thank Merlin we weren’t friends before now, you would have been a terrible influence on Scorpius.”
’ ma petite étoile,” he said, and when Scorpius still looked confused, he added, “which means deep love and respect.”
They wandered around the shelves, trying to find their way out. What they hadn’t realised as they walked to the back of the shop, was how many twists and turns the shop seemed to have. Draco’s laughter as they came to another dead-end added to the fluttery feeling in Harry’s chest and he was struck with an idea.
With a nod, Draco tried to find his voice. “No problem,” he said, cursing himself when he felt his face flush light pink. “Ergh, I can’t be sentimental anymore,” Draco groaned, shaking his head.
His mother would take him to the greenhouse, and they’d lie down on the benches by the fountain with blankets and pillows and she would point to each star, each pattern and tell him the stories behind them.
“I’m not going to lie, I think he might be planning the wedding already,” Draco added with an apologetic shrug, rubbing his forearm.
,” he explained, as if there was nothing worse that could happen at this moment in time.
it said, not sounding sorry at all.
Harry looked at him curiously, inching closer to Draco and placing a hand on his arm. “You’re right,” he said, his eyes filled with a similar fire that Draco had seen in the robe shop, though for entirely different reasons.
-“ he began, only to be cut off by a cough from Mrs Weasley.
-----
Draco softly shushed him. “It’s not your fault,” he said, stroking the back of Harry’s head. “There was nothing -
Harry raised an eyebrow back at him. “No, it’s a hippogriff,” he deadpanned, causing Draco to let out a bark of laughter. “I thought you’d know what a book looked like,” he teased, and Draco looked at him like he was an idiot.
Yet, he was sat at the table in the kitchen chewing at his fingernails.
Sirius and Harry, however, were neck and neck, and Draco couldn’t help but find their competitiveness amusing. It was like watching a stubborn father and son, battle for the right to say they won – Draco assumed it was the Gryffindor spirit Harry refused to admit he had earlier.
“She won’t let me into the school as much as she wouldn’t let you,” Remus bit his thumb as he thought. “When is your next Hogsmeade trip?”
” Sirius laughed, which encouraged Draco to drop his defences, and he closed the book. “I felt like I’d been knocked in the stomach by a hippogriff,” he admitted, leaning back against the sofa.
. The cashier glanced between the two of them, very amused, but she didn’t say anything. “You’re a right git, you know that?” Draco scowled, causing Harry to chuckle.
Harry blushed, stumbling for a reply. “I – well, you see – I
talk about it. It was as if every time he tried to bring it up in conversation, there were a million reasons not to.
,” she exclaimed, her voice stern.
This made Draco roll his eyes. “Probably none,” Draco said, not voicing the fact he didn’t really want to be in Slytherin. “Where did you go on holiday?” Draco asked, making Blaise grin as he admired his own tan.
to see me…” Harry said.
Which was why he was now walking with the two Malfoy’s on their way to the pond. He walked next to Malfoy as Scorpius ran ahead of them, occasionally calling back to them about how incredibly slow they walked.
Andromeda chuckled, a laugh which was similar to his mother’s but richer and deeper. “I do,” she replied. “Your Uncle is a Muggleborn, you see,” she told him, watching as his eyes widened, filled with millions of questions.
Draco was incredibly worried. He had tried not to be, but Harry was not wrong when he had said he wouldn’t be able to contact him.
Forgetting about his tea for a moment, Draco said, “no one else then?”
“Nothing, nothing,” Draco replied dismissively, letting go of Harry’s hand to dig in his pocket for his wand. “I’m just an idiot,” he sighed, casting a levitating charm over the books, so that they now were floating alongside them.

“Don’t get my hopes up Potter.”
“Stop what?” he asked, bemused.
to her –“
Harry bit back a chuckle, stumbling slightly as the eight-year-old bounced up and down. Before he could respond, Scorpius continued, “I’m glad you said you’d celebrate with us,” Scorpius grinned. “Dad gets lonely during Samhain, he thinks he’s great at hiding it, but he’s not.” He suddenly came to a halt, and once again, Harry stumbled, trying not to fall over Scorpius. “Shoes!” he exclaimed, dragging Harry back to the door.
to tell you, before it becomes something I
Yet, here he was, staring at the front cover the Daily Prophet, a few weeks after his outburst, using his shitty excuse of a childhood to explain away his accusations about Voldemort’s return.
“We’ll be there at about eleven.”
“Well then, being reckless must just be second nature to you Potter,” Snape commented with a smirk, a few sniggers were heard throughout the room. “Perhaps this is what happens if you grow up a celebrity, being waited on hand and foot.”
Shaking his head, Harry could just about see Sirius and Remus exchange looks.
“No shit,” Harry replied.
Harry feigned innocence, grinning at Malfoy. Scorpius interrupted them, shushing the two of them, as if he were the adult.
After a moment of silence, where Harry was certain his heartbeat was audible to both of the Malfoy’s, he decided to break the silence. “So, when are we going to bake this cake?”
Harry chuckled. “Of course,” he nodded. “I was thinking about thanking you with a kiss and,” he paused, watching as one of Draco's eyebrows twitched upwards. “The jam tarts I got from the kitchens earlier,” he sighed, forcing himself not to laugh as Draco's hand froze, “Oh well, I’ll just have to -"
“Again,” Harry began. “Why would that matter?” he asked, raising an eyebrow.
“This is where I first met Sirius,” Harry said, looking around the shack with an out of place fondness in his eyes. The room was still covered in dust and the boarded-up windows forced the sunlight in strange directions, making the room seem almost prison-like. “That was an –
“Don’t mind Pansy, she tends to opt for the dramatics,” Zabini chuckled as Parkinson squatted his arm. “The sentiment still holds of course – Slytherins protect their own,” he explained, still flashing a dazzling smile. This unnerved Harry more than Parkinson’s direct threat. “But she means well.”
“He’s part of your family,” Harry states, raising an eyebrow at his Godfather, who nodded.
,” she said, pointing her wand at the two. Harry instantly felt a warmth spread through his body and sighed in relief; Ron had a similar reaction.
The door chimed and Malfoy glanced up, sighing as he caught sight of who entered. Following his line of sight, Harry glanced at who had just entered and noticed a familiar, little old lady.
“I’ll keep you safer,” Draco said, smirking as Harry raised an eyebrow.
“I pay for this date, and you can pay for the next one,” Harry smiled, squeezing Draco’s hand with his own, kissing the man’s cheek without even thinking about it. “I was almost in Slytherin you know?”
“Both?” Harry shrugged. “I think he’s trying to find a way to make Sirius a freeman, but…” he trailed off, an expression Draco couldn't quite place, edging its way onto his face. He shook his head. “He told me once, Remus, that he would find a way for Sirius to keep his promise, so I could live with him.”
Blaise and Pansy both raised an eyebrow but seemed to decide to ask about it when he returned. “Don’t forget about us,” Blaise teased, and Draco stuck his tongue out at him.
“He doesn’t want to date anyone,” Harry explained, and Teddy nodded slowly.
He wasn’t sure how much time had passed until his breathing evened out and his grip loosened on the sink, but the sun was shining through the stain glass windows, suggesting it was setting.
“No,” Harry said again. “No one is killing anyone,” Harry chuckled as Draco sighed dramatically.
“Why would I
Potter glanced sheepishly at Draco before saying, “I might be able to explain it, but just don’t hex me if it gets personal alright?” he warned.
Frowning, Draco pushing himself from the wall and turned to Harry. “Yes – I thought it was obvious?”
“But it’s only three types of coin,” Draco insisted. “Twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, seventeen Sickles to a Galleon, simple,” he shrugged, as if it was memorable.
Draco scoffed. “I thought Gryffindor’s were supposed to be competitive?”
Hermione raised an eyebrow and Harry smiled.
Draco shot Harry a look, making him chuckle. “Of course I want to perform magic Potter, that’s why I’m here.”
He enjoyed talking to Draco Malfoy.
Then, an unpleasant feeling grew in his stomach, climbing through his chest and squeezing at his throat. He wasn’t scared, but uncomfortable; it was the same feeling he got before he spoke to Sirius after the article in the Prophet. It was an itchiness and a restlessness that made him want to deny that there was anything wrong, because if he did, the feeling would disappear, as it had done when Draco was distracting him in the tunnel.
The streets on the outskirts of London, where Grimmauld place was, were rather quiet, as everyone was at work or school. Harry listened as birds chirped in the trees and the low buzz from central London distracted his mind from his boredom. It was times like this that he missed Ron being an Auror the most, and he hated himself for it.
Instead, he lent forward and slightly kissed the end of Draco's nose, then proceeding to tackle the blond to the floor in a hug.
“Kreacher!” Harry exclaimed, catching the attention of those in the room with him. “Kreacher, I need to know, is Sirius there?” he asked, holding his breath.
As he reached his table, he looked over at Harry’s, and Harry smiled as the boy tilted his head, placing his book on his table. Slowly, he made his way to Harry’s table, and stopped by the armchair next to Harry. “I haven’t seen you here before,” the boy said, albeit apprehensively.
“So, she’s choosing to stay there, and not with me,” Draco said, feeling worse than before.
“Yes!” he exclaimed. “How’d you know?” he asked, sceptical.
Malfoy went bright red. “I – well – I don’t – I hope you win,” he said, stumbling over his words.
“Because Professor Longbottom told me that it’s hanging in his office,” Teddy explained. Harry didn’t know that. “He said that it seems to rather like him,” he shrugged, looking disappointed with himself as he lost balance and had to step on one of the cracks to not fall over, Harry gripping onto Teddy’s hand tightly to truly make sure he didn’t fall.
Draco blinked, “Since the end of March, I think. Look Potter, I don’t quite think you understand what I’m –“
Malfoy blinked at Harry, staring at him in a way that implied complete bewilderment. “I wanted to raise him the way I wish I had been.”
“Pansy, you know it has nothing to do with pride,” he said, feeling a throbbing at the back of his skull.
three copies of that book,” Harry said, baffled as to why you would need multiple of the same book.
?” Scorpius said, leaning forwards on his dad’s shoulders to see his reaction.
He ran, hoping whoever was there hadn’t heard the Howler.
If Malfoy didn’t think Harry had lost his sanity before, he did now. “Potter, have you lost your mind? What are you even –“
“Do you mean like a sleepover Scorpius?” Harry asked, hoping to avoid some confusion and possible embarrassment.
“Alone, please,” Harry reiterated, refusing to look at Ron.
“It’s not really haunted Draco, you’ll be fine,” Harry chuckled, as Draco lost his usual cool demeanour.
He smiled as he read the letter, understanding what Teddy was feeling. He missed him too.
“Yes,” Harry chuckled. He had raised this boy right.
“I used to spend most of my time in here,” Sirius said, making Draco almost fall off the sofa as he slammed the book shut. With a chuckle, Sirius said, “Sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you.”
rub the place she had hit him, smiling sheepishly. “Sorry ‘Dromeda, it’s just been
the one who forced me to see him to begin with,” Draco said, rolling his eyes at her theatrics.
Draco saw the man –
Blaise shrugged. “Suppose I am,” he said, helping Draco store his trunk.
Harry laughed. “I really was the only one who didn’t know.”
“Anytime Teddy Bear,” Harry smiled, feeling relieved when Teddy smiled back, even though his eyes were a little red. “Would you like a hot chocolate?” he asked, and Teddy nodded, still sniffling a little.
Harry shook his head. “I’m not cold,” he muttered, his eyebrows furrowing as his hands continued to tremble.
light in the sky,” Draco began, unconsciously brushing his fingers through Harry’s hair. “But he
“In a bookshop?” Draco asked, biting his lip, as if to stop himself from laughing.
Harry felt a smile tug at his lips, relief flooding his body when he knew Draco wouldn’t push him for answers. “
He could practically hear Harry rolling his eyes, when he noticed the library door begin to move. There was a flash of ginger and two voices.
“Thanks for not being a prick about it,” Ron said, chuckling. “I just want a slow life you know? I talked to ‘Mione about it and she said I should just – go for it,” Ron explained. “Stop with a job I hate,” he sighed, shoving his hands in his empty pockets. “And maybe I’ll take up a part-time job eventually, help George out or something.”
Harry shook his head. “I don’t think so,” he said, needing to check on Sirius and explain the article before Sirius did something he’d regret.
Blaise and Pansy saddled up next to him as they walked into the castle, glancing back at Harry and Ron. “Is that Harry?” Pansy asked, glancing at them again.
“Do you like him Daddy?” Scorpius asked.
With Teddy hidden under a bundle of blankets and a hat, the two of them left for the teashop to meet Draco and Scorpius before heading to the Christmas Market. Teddy was jumping from square to square on the pavement, avoiding the cracks as Harry wrapped his own scarf around his neck. They were a little late because Harry couldn’t find his wallet, and then he couldn’t find his wand, and then he couldn’t remember where he’d placed his scarf.
way,” the boy said, his eyes widening when he realised, he almost slipped up.
With a hum, Andromeda poured herself some more tea. “Strange indeed,” she replied, her eyes shining. “So how long have you been frequenting my nephew’s teashop?” she asked, and Harry tried his best to not choke on his tea.
don’t apologise. Whilst I appreciate the thought, it’s not your fault.” Draco placed his teacup down on the table. “I’ve had my time to grieve, I’d rather move on and remember her in how I raise my son,” he said, looking into Harry’s eyes, expecting to see pity but he see’s something else. It seems like admiration, but Draco shakes the thought. “Anyway, what about you? Are you still seeing the Weasley?” he asked, curious. Harry was somehow very good at keeping his love life out of the papers.
disowned?” he asked, scrunching his face as he hid behind the book.
“If that’s what you want,” Harry grinned. “I ended up in Knockturn Alley, I was too nervous to say Diagon Alley right” he said, putting milk in a pan on the stove and retrieving the hot chocolate powder from the cupboard.
Teddy nodded. “He’s really cool, and he always has the best stories,” he grinned. “Besides Uncle George, but his are funnier.”
Quickly clasping at the other boy’s hand, Draco shook his momentary shock and grinned widely at Harry. “Pleasure to meet you Harry, for a second time,” he joked. He was glad to see Harry’s shoulders drop and the smile return to his face.
“Really? We’ve barely spoken for twenty minutes,” Draco noted.
“Is Scorpius enthusing about dragons again?” Malfoy asked, placing a hand on the armchair Scorpius was sat on, smiling. “I apologise if he’s talked your ear off Potter,” he joked, and Harry shook his head as Scorpius grumbled at being interrupted.
Malfoy caught Harry trying not to laugh and glared at him. “She’s a powerful witch too, I can’t even pretend to have a kitchen emergency because I can charm the utensils,” he said. “Even if I couldn’t, she would insist on doing it for me.”
“Why do you think I kept going?” Harry joked. “It’s actually really good tea.”
“I’m so sorry Harry,” Hermione said as Harry dragged the two into the boys’ dormitory, which he knew would be empty. “You mentioned something before, but I had no idea it was so – “
with my emotions I suppose,” he joked. Draco had mentioned that Harry couldn’t tell a smile from a frown. “Although maybe it’s the peppermint tea,” he said, reliving the memory in his mind with a chuckle.
Harry grinned, biting back a laugh. “Terrific,” he deadpanned. “Tons of fun,” he said, throwing a grin at Draco. “You know, it’s strange, but what I
The two boys would sneak glances at each other when the other wasn’t looking, looking away before either of them realised what was happening.
“I’ll need to mentally prepare myself if I’m to be subjected to your presence regularly Potter,” Malfoy drawled, the pink hue of his face deepening.
It didn’t matter, not really.
you also talk a lot about the books that you’re currently reading, so I guessed that you are a book lover and… well, when Hermione is one of your best friends –“
“It is, I can’t believe I now
tells me off when I forget to,” he whispered.
“Don’t thank me yet Potter,” Malfoy replied, wincing at his own thoughts. “There’s not much more I can tell you,” he said quietly, sounding sincere.
“Nightmares?” Draco asked, turning to face Harry completely.
“Forgive me for doubting that you actually knew what you were doing,” Draco drawled. “You have a record of being a quite thoughtless on these matters,” he shrugged as Harry elbowed his arm.
come here Teddy Bear,” Harry murmured, pulling Teddy in for another hug, letting him cry into his shirt. “Have you been worrying about this?”
“He failed to mention
As September arrived, Lucius had taken it upon himself to instil his expectations upon Draco, constantly reminding him of the family traditions. “As the Malfoy Heir, you hold the continuation and reputation of our name upon your shoulders,” his father explained to him. As he was unable to go with Draco to the platform, Lucius was his goodbyes on his way to the Ministry that morning. “As well as that of the Noble House of Black, now that your mother’s family either went mad or got themselves killed,” he sneered, slamming his cane into the ground, causing Draco to flinch.
Draco gently cupped Harry’s face in his hands, forcing Harry to look at his eyes. “You’ve never elaborated on your home life, and I have never asked because if you want to tell me, you will,” Draco’s eyes were alight, and Harry knew he meant every word he was saying. “But that doesn’t mean I can’t see how badly it affects you. I’ve noticed how you eat, how you interact with certain people, how you think you
Harry rolled his eyes. “You underestimate me Draco,” he drawled. “I think I’m strong enough to hold a teapot,” he said pointedly.
“I hate to agree with Weasley Harry but, how are you planning to check that Sirius
a surprise if I tell you now, is it Potter?”
“At least I punched him in the face,” Harry pointed out with a grin, making Draco laugh.
“I love you too Mother,” Draco whispered, hugging her tightly.
Harry chuckled, ruffling Scorpius’ hair. “Hey Scorp’,” he said, placing his arm over Teddy’s shoulders, hoping he wasn’t feeling overwhelmed. “This is my son, Teddy,” he introduced, watching as Teddy beamed at being referred to as Harry’s son.
“You haven’t seen the common room when there’s only one slice of bakewell tart left,” Draco muttered, deciding to hand over the card. “Can I have the Queen of Spades?”
“I’ll be right back,” Draco said, standing up to find Harry, he had promised.
“They look wonderful ma petite étoile,” Draco said with a smile, picking up the tray. “I’m sure these will taste amazing,” he said, putting them in the oven. “I’ll call you when they’re done, if you’d like to go play.”
There was always a possibility he hadn’t read the Prophet yet if Remus was late for his daily check-in – though he knew it didn’t really make a difference, he would prefer it if
“Is he any good at it?” Ron asked, forcing Harry to budge up the sofa so Hermione could sit next to him.
“Just –
“And then, Holly and Luke managed to sneak into McGona-
“Merlin Potter,” Draco said, using his other hand to mess with Harry’s hair. “Your hair’s tickling my neck.”
“Bloody lucky indeed,” Draco muttered under his breath, getting elbowed in the stomach by Harry. “Oi you prat! You said it first,” he said, rubbing his stomach.
“I needed to see if you knew, before I told you what’s on my mind, otherwise it might have been a bit much.” Harry turned his body to face Draco fully, watching as the concern flickered on and off his face. “I’m meeting with my Godparents tomorrow, in Hogsmeade.”
“Yes?” Draco asked as he stood next to Harry.
Draco smiled, not opening his eyes. “You’re the one who says it’s a cat,” he yawned. “Wake me if you need to hide a body Pansy dear,” he said, hearing a squeal and the sound of heavy footsteps as Blaise ran from Pansy.
himself. He smiled as Draco subconsciously held his hand, linking their fingers together.
“It is,” she answered. “Tell Draco we hope he keeps you,” she said, and Harry couldn’t help but laugh.
Harry smiled, sipping his tea. “Well, I’ve never been here before,” he said, watching as the boy’s eyes lit up.
Harry shook his head. “No… no I don’t think I did, did I?” Harry said, a meek smile toying with his mouth. He sighed, pushing his glasses up to rub the bridge of his nose. “I just – I truly hate it there, I feel like I’m stagnant and nothing’s going to come and change that, so I decided I – well, that I may as well quit and do something I actually enjoy,” Harry said, taking a deep breath as he finished.
this is it, the end of the story.
to see you Malfoy.”
He had arrived early, mainly because if he spent another second staring at his notes, he would have bashed his head against a wall.
“Draco,” Harry interrupted, instantly getting Malfoy to stop talking. “If I didn’t like it, you would know.”
“I already told you both my name,” Ron shrugged, smiling slightly. “But it is nice to meet you I guess,” he said, specifically to Draco. “My dad told me about your family, he knows your dad, but you’re all right,” Ron said, nodding.
“Potter,” Parkinson greeted coldly. Zabini rolled his eyes and rubbed the bridge of his nose as Harry rubbed the back of his neck, a tentative smile tugging at his mouth.
Once, when he was little, Andromeda had shown up at the Manor to talk to his mother. Lucius had
Now he had begun to speak, he didn’t want to hear their responses, their disappointment and anger and pity.
“Potter!” Harry heard someone exclaim as he walked into them, turning the corner. Everyone except the Trio stiffened, poising for a fight.
“Don’t be rude Draco,” he scolded, lightly flicking his forehead.
Even though it was June, it appeared the weather itself had decided to reflect the atmosphere within Hogwarts, but the sun… the sun would worm its way through the clouds, only to boast with its warm glow and orange light.
“I’ve never actually seen a photo of him before,” Draco mentioned, and realisation spread across Harry’s face.
“Is he friends with Remus Lupin?” he asked, Andromeda looked at Ted who shook his head, shrugging his shoulders. She nodded. “And he’s Harry’s Godfather, he somehow managed to escape Azkaban,“ he muttered to himself, and prepared to ask a question that might seem strange. “Is he, by any chance, an Animagus, specifically a big, black dog?”
“Really? Because I was told the only reason we’re here is because my Aunt confronted you on the matter,” Draco grinned, walking past Harry into the store, as Harry scrunched his nose.
The dread that Harry had been feeling all day was at its peak. They were going to be brewing a Befuddlement Draught, a potion which makes the drinker reckless and hostile and, knowing Snape, Harry would at some point, be forced to try one of the potions. He was not looking forward to seeing just how reckless this potion made you – what if he mentioned Sirius? Or the DA? He hoped it wasn’t going to be as bad as he was imagining.
