It turned out that Zabini asked the other Slytherins to help carry the boxes, and from the joyful expression of Crabbe and Goyle, it was probable that he would ask for help eating them as well. "He doesn't even like chocolate," mumbled Parkinson as she passed by Harry carrying three boxes.
“Yeah,” said Harry, not wanting to tell Ron what he’d rather do with that time. “Hermione, what was the correct weight of Griffith claw? Ten or- You
Draco hummed, “Well, you still won,” he resolved, grinning when Harry looked at him. “Did you forget? You are still the Champion.” His eyes crinkled, as he rested his arms around Harry’s neck. “The first one in two centuries,” he added.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Don’t flatter yourself, Weasley. Your brothers gave her something that worsened it, according to Lovegood."
A loud clatter broke through the mostly quiet room when Neville accidentally pushed the recipient over the edge. As clockwork, Snape was on them.
Ron let out a startled laugh. "Oh, did he?" He turned towards Harry with an amused smile. "Are you giving them preferential treatment, Harry?"
Draco tilted up his chin. “Sometimes he would dance with me,” he said, then looking at Harry as if daring him to laugh.
"He broke up with me," said Harry, feeling it sink further. Luna gave him a sad smile but didn't say anything.
“Not even in You-Know-Who?” asked Ron, making both of them laugh. “Can you imagine him just opening the damn thing, putting it on his eye and then-” He gestured a punch to his own face. “
He lets go of the grip on Malfoy’s wrists as he does so, and the blond immediately cradles one of them with his other hand. “And then what?”
But someone else was. Nott ducked his head when Harry caught him looking at him, and quickened his steps out of the Hall- No. Harry felt his heart spike when he realised Nott was trying to catch up to Draco. He ground his teeth. What the fuck was Nott doing?
Rumours about the competition, possible challenges and champions, impressions on the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students, complaints about the age limitation, and more. Overall excitement ran through the different discussions going on at the late hour, the chatter never seeming to die down but becoming bigger and noisier, probably due to the bottles of Butterbeer and Firewhiskey that had appeared at some point.
“I should hate you,” said Draco in a quiet voice, dropping his arms. “For my family, I should hate you, but I can’t even do that for them.” He hung his head and let out another laugh that sounded more like a sob. “Even after all this, I still feel the same.”
During the first half-hour of the class, Umbridge did nothing but take notes on her clipboard, posing no problem for Harry. But once she stood up to approach Snape and pester him, it became increasingly difficult to pay attention to the potion.
Harry glanced at his side, where Sirius had joined him and was too looking at the tapestry. The expression on his face was hard to describe, the same one that appeared whenever his family was brought up, a complex mix of hostility and resignation.
“Well, I have to see that. Come on, Moony.” Sirius started making his way among the crowd but Remus paused to look at them one last time.
“Harry,” said Draco and Harry’s world halted at the change of tone. It was low and pleading, not unlike the one Hermione had used before. She had been scared, and it was clear now that Draco was too. “Trust me.”
Harry was rooted on his spot, feeling troubled, because for a moment he had wanted to go after him, but that was
“The Department of Mysteries,” said Harry, jumping back to his feet. “What is in the Department of Mysteries?"
“Because you will be bleeding until you shrivel up,” said George. “We haven’t found and antidote yet."
,” said a posh voice that made Harry crack a smile and turn around. Draco had his blue scarf on, the colour bringing out his eyes perfectly as he gave Harry a white grin. “Hi."
Parkinson looked around the room. “Not a bad place, Potter," she mused, giving him an approving nod.
Draco sighed. "So thick. Listen, Harry, if you keep antagonizing the woman you are just going to keep getting the same result. Which is deducted House Points and…?"
“But, as I said, Harry explained it to us, and I trust him,” said Hermione, giving Harry a firm nod. “Furthermore, Malfoy refrained from saying anything to us since they started talking. He’s actually been rather polite."
They could hear the numerous footsteps of the students as they filled the stands, and Harry started to get feel nervous about the match, maybe not as much as Ron, but a bit more than usual. When it was time, the team shouldered their brooms and marched outside the room in line, being welcomed by the cheers of the crowd and the cold daylight.  The Slytherin team was waiting for them, standing in line with their usual arrogance. Crabbe and Goyle looked uncomfortable in their uniforms, but the solid grip on their bats was menacing, and Montague seemed determined to crush Angelina’s fingers when they shook hands.
And Narcissa was not looking at her son with confusion nor anger, but concern. “Do you need a moment, dear?” she asked in a hushed voice, her gaze flickering to Harry again, and there was something in it that told him all he needed to know.
“I’m afraid your owner isn’t here,” answered Draco, and something about the way his voice sounded made Harry take the final steps.
He saw him during Potions on Tuesday. Snape had been especially bitter, probably due to Harry turning in another good essay, and had them all brewing Weedosoros. Surely in hopes Harry accidentally drank it and died.
Draco’s expression was nothing but indifferent at first glance, but the hint of wariness in his silver eyes and the slight tension on his jaw gave him away. He returned Harry’s gaze, eyebrows raised as if expecting him to answer a question, then falling when he didn’t. “I must say,” he started, voice carefully neutral as he turned to look at Hermione. “Perhaps you should have given Harry a bit more of a warning.”
Harry felt his throat dry, and took a deep breath, summoning all his Gryffindor bravery. But when he looked into the pretty grey eyes he had come to like so much, the words he had wanted to say for a long time finally slipped out easily.
“And that’s okay, sometimes people don’t talk,” continued Sirius, giving him an awkward pat on the arm. “But it will be fine, alright? I’m sure it will, just give him some time now-”
And then there's the second thing, which makes him feel bad about his long-time enemy. Lupin had once told him that sometimes children get bitten to punish their parents. Werewolves are under Voldemort's control at the moment, that much Harry knows, which means that after failing at the Ministry, Lucius Malfoy had to be punished.
Hermione and Ron were still awake and stood up from their seats on the couch as he walked into the room, looking equally upset.
As he waited for the exam to begin, Harry tapped his fingers on the desk and glanced around. Draco was sitting near the wall, fiddling with his quill, and happened to turn around just as Harry looked at him. The blond blinked and raised an eyebrow.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “He would do that?” Draco’s grimace told him enough, so Harry let out a sigh and nodded. “I’ll see you later?”
“What?” he asked warily. Sirius was trying not to laugh, and that couldn’t be good. Especially next to a serious Lupin. “Did I do something?”
“Harry! Where were you, mate?” Ron turned towards the mirror again, fiddling with the frilly collar of his outdated robes.
“Nevermind,” sighed Harry. He tussled with his hair a bit more before giving up and stepping back from the mirror, going back into the room.
Classroom eleven, out of God knows how many others, was one of the unused rooms at the ground floor and had been recently appointed for Divination since Firenze couldn't climb the stairs up to the previous one. The centaur had made a few changes, meaning that now the room had been turned into a replica of a forest clearing, so real that if it weren't for the door one could forget they were inside the castle.
Harry winced at that, looking apologetically at the owls that flew back in. “I really am dreadful company.”
Once his feet were back on steady ground, Harry decided that he didn’t like Apparating at all. His ears buzzed again and he had to shake his head a bit before taking in his surroundings, and then he felt his heart skip.
Shit. Perhaps Harry should have waited until after the class to say that. He grimaced. “Yeah, sorry, it’s not Remedial anything," he confessed.
And Draco wrapped his arms around his neck and melted with a whimper, letting him explore his mouth. His permission made Harry's blood rush, pooling into his stomach almost uncomfortably, and then Draco was pulling him closer and one of Harry's legs came to rest between his, moving up when their tongues met.
Instead of being affronted, the man let out a laugh. “They are always guessing where I am, I’m sure they have no idea."
Before Harry could open his mouth to ask, in a very alarmed voice, what had happened, the answer came flying around the corner just a few meters behind Draco. Made of red, orange and yellow fireworks, a dragon was on his boyfriend's tail, intangible jaws opening and closing as if wanting to swallow him whole.
And he had come to some conclusions. First of all, he was completely sure that Draco’s handwriting was slightly messier than usual - Harry had even compared it with previous letters. And second of all, he had no idea what the message meant.
“It’s to see the screen better,” said Harry simply, he didn’t know much about movies, really, but if he was to start talking about the projectors or electricity, he would rather do so sitting down and not standing up in a cupboard.
Sirius, as expected, didn’t buy it as quickly. “Oh, really?” he said viciously. “So what is dear Draco doing to help?”
“Do you have a better idea?” asked Harry. “You should because you had plenty of them when I opened it at the owlery."
"Honestly, Harry." Hermione rolled her eyes in exasperation, then crossing her arms and shaking her head at him. However, when she spoke there was clear amusement in her voice. "He just bats his eyelashes and you go with his every whim."
The Slytherin seemed ready to reply, but choked on her words when the Durmstrang boy started walking over.
Malfoy frowned. “Bastard didn’t tell me.” Grey eyes looked at Harry in suspicion. “What’s up with the Gryffindors? I feel like they have been weird for a while now.” He pointed an accusing finger at Harry. “And
“I’m afraid I haven’t been told yet,” said Skeeter, her grin stretching even wider. “Little Miss Perfect here was about to tell me.” She leaned in, a dangerous glint in her eyes. “So Draco, how are you feeling with the news of the breakout? Lestrange is your aunt, isn’t she? How-?”
But Draco had always had a knack for ruining his plans. His silver gaze flickered from the parchment to Harry, making both freeze until Draco let the quill down and sat straight. "Harry," he let out in surprise, as if Harry could have done something besides going after him.
“Ah, so concerned with my well-being,” mused Draco. He smiled up at Harry and sighed after he kissed him one last time. “And a goodnight kiss, how thoughtful. Consider me wooed.” He shook his head and placed his book and wand on the table by his bed. “Alright, I’ll go to sleep. Happy?”
Myrtle let out a sigh. “Yes, handsome Cedric Diggory. It took him so long to figure it out that the bubbles disappeared... You should try it too, Harry."
“An essay on giant wars from Binns, one on uses of moonstones from Snape, and now a dream journal? This year is going to suck,” groaned Ron as they left the Divination Tower. “That Umbridge woman better not leave us anything."
“She’s not listening, is she?” said Draco. He reached up to pass his fingers through Harry’s hair, humming in appreciation, “You look dashing today."
Draco leaned forwards and hid his face on Harry's shoulder. "You can't just ask that,” he mumbled against it. “It's not fair."
His friends called for him but Harry didn’t stop, eyes fixed on the front window. He made his way through the crowd, many people voicing their protests and receiving only half mumbled apologies he wasn’t even sure he had said aloud because all he could think about, all he had been thinking about for a month, was just outside the store.
Harry hummed. “Sprout didn’t leave homework today, so no." The professor was probably going to leave a big assignment tomorrow, though.
; the neutral tone that wasn’t normal, the blank look in his face and the stillness of his eyes that were so unlike him as the dark circles under them-
Harry felt his jaw clench. If it were for him, he would already be gone, but it was the start of term and he needed the stupid class schedule, which meant he was stuck at Gryffindor’s table, hearing others go on about his life.
The last ones to arrive were the Creevey brothers, Fred, George, Lee Jordan and Luna, who wandered in with her usual dreamy look. If she hadn’t told Harry she planned to come, he would have wondered if she had gotten lost.
His trunk bounced on the steps as he ran down the stairs, Hedwig chirping in protest from the swinging cage on his other hand. The ruckus alerted Sirius and Remus, making them stop their hushed conversation at the bottom of the stairs.
“Is in Azkaban because of you!” completed Nott, lips curling up in sadistic pleasure when Draco fell quiet. “You sent your own father to Azkaban, Draco, and mine might end up there as well! Are you happy now?” He let out a dark laugh. “You betrayed your people, and why did you do it?”
Harry blinked, noticing that Draco was now standing near the middle of the room, looking very satisfied with himself. “I was just thinking that you must be infested with Nargles too."
The first time Harry woke up, it was to a loud discussion, as Fudge and McGonagall barged in the Hospital Wing. Despite Dumbledore’s words, Fudge was unrelenting, not listening to the Headmaster, nor Harry, not even Snape. In the end, the Minister stormed off after disregarding all the events that transpired last night, and Dumbledore was quick to start making arrangements. Harry went to sleep again, feeling even more tired.
“We’ll tell you later,” interrupted Harry. It wasn’t something they should speak about freely when they were surrounded by people. “But first tell us, what happened?”
“Because it says here that it could be a good change, or fear of change, like moving on after something bad happens.” Ron actually seemed invested now. “Or it could also be about going back to something after changing it."
Harry couldn't help but frown. “No, Hermione, I didn’t. He just saw me with the dog and thought he should tell me."
Malfoy grinned at that and Harry felt like singing. Then the blond looked down at his ingredients and frowned.
"Slytherins know everything," said Draco. He grinned when Harry rolled his eyes at him and added, "And Pansy is a force to reckon when it comes to gossiping. Especially if it's something she finds funny."
Harry opened his mouth to protest, to tell Cedric he should grab it, or that they should grab it together. But, “I promised someone I would win,” he confessed, feeling uncertain “Are you sure it’s alright?”
Zabini sighed. "Do you really think he will? He keeps brooding all day." His eyes flickered to Harry’s briefly, and a sly grin grew on his lips. “Pansy, remind me again what he said when you told him you had caught Skeeter?"
His interactions with his friends were tense. He could tell Hermione and Ron were as lost as he was.
"And I'm just helping you," said Harry, watching how the wand returned to the dummy. He gave Draco's back a light pat. "Go on."
“Yeah, he is.” Ginny sighed and looked at him with a thin smile. “Malfoy isn’t bad either. I do have to admit that at the start I thought you had gone crazy, but,” She shrugged, “He really seems different now.”
Harry caught him by the hand and spun him around. He couldn’t help but laugh at the others surprised expression, receiving a shove for his efforts. Harry refused to let go, and after struggling a bit, Draco let out a theatrical sigh and stilled. His pretty grey eyes studied Harry for a moment.
“You saw?” asked Harry. He wasn’t worried about Draco seeing him leave with Hagrid, but the possibility someone else did.
Startled by the sudden interruption, Harry looked behind him to find Dudley peeking into his room, his big face slack as he looked at scattered things on the floor.
The wolf doesn't answer. Harry watches as it paces around the Shack, sniffing the air, then sometimes stopping to look at Harry before continuing, as if to make sure he is still there.
"Uh oh," said Ron from his seat next to Harry. The boy had preferred the fudge over the tart and had his face stuffed with it, to Hermione’s visible disapproval.
“Harry,” called Hermione, making him stop staring and follow Ron and her across the crowded station. Many people stared, whispers following after them, but he paid it no mind as he searched for familiar faces.
The match went on, and Harry’s search grew frantic as Ron let through two other goals and the crown groaned, but the snitch was nowhere in sight as he circled the field again. He crossed paths with Draco, who had been doing the same, receiving a grin that would have made him linger if it weren’t for the new goal Pucey had scored.
"I think they might be working for someone that is, so maybe." Harry shrugged, Dementors were the least of his worries right now. "But I'll be fine, I can drive them away."
date. Out of Hogwarts and just the two of them. The last time he had been this close to Draco Malfoy in Hogsmeade, Harry had been under his cloak and dragging him on the snow while the boy screamed in terror. “It is nice,” said Harry sincerely, bumping his knee into Draco’s and smiling. “Maybe next time we could go to the Hog’s Head.”
When he finished, he realized that he had been rubbing circles on Draco’s arms and shoulders absentmindedly, and his eyes went back to the blond’s face. He was worrying at his lower lip, face looking too pale.
“That’s brilliant,” said Harry, noticing how his friend seemed relieved by that. “Wish I could go watch the tryouts, but, you know..."
Harry nodded and looked at the room again, snorting when he found the boys sending daggers at Zabini when a nervous Katie gave him a box of sweets. Ignoring the rest, Cho and Cedric were talking to each other by a corner, happily sharing a box of chocolates that the boy had brought looking the perfect picture of a sappy couple.
Harry turned around to find Ron and Seamus passing by, the former glancing between him and Malfoy, looking confused for a moment before his frown deepened and he glared at them.
“The sensation is quite unpleasant, I’m afraid,” said Dumbledore as Harry let go of his arm to rub his head. “Are you alright?”
“Very funny.” Hermione sat across from them. She placed her bag on the bench and served herself some mashed potatoes as she explain, “Professor Vector just left us an essay for Wednesday, and I’ll be damned if I don’t start it right this second because I have to present one for Runes that day as well, and we also have Snape’s assignment for Thursday-”
Draco shrugged. “What can I say, you are rather eye-catching.” He grinned at him, rolling his eyes when Harry didn’t grin back. “She didn’t see you leave, but you should be more careful, you know.” He wasn’t asking why he left, just as he never asked anything, and Harry should feel relieved by that but only felt bitter.
The blond snickered at Harry’s bad attempt to repress a laugh, which resulted in Harry laughing anyway. There were more weird looks sent towards them, but Harry didn’t mind at all.
“Now, this.” He raised the opened letter. “Molly wrote to me. She and her clan are coming over for dinner, Moony too, and we have to make a good impression or else they will keep saying I’m not responsible enough.”
"She is getting sacked," said a posh voice, whose owner was almost hit in the nose when Harry turned around quickly to look at him. "Careful, Scarhead," hissed Draco, still accepting his hand into his own.
It didn't work either. “I screwed up, I let every goal in.” Ron let out a sigh and hunched further, his voice was small when he spoke again, “If it weren’t for you we would have lost, Harry."
The warning whistle of the train went off, making the rest of the students in the platform hurry onto the train.
But Draco hadn’t done anything. Harry was sure that if Draco had wanted to sabotage the interview, he would have found the way. But he hadn’t even asked Harry not to do it. And neither had he crossed the street to the tea shop where Umbridge might or not be. Even now that he had gone to Hogwarts, Harry was sure he wouldn’t do anything either.
“That’s a question,” comes the answer and Harry is tempted to turn around and look at him but he doesn’t. He hears the creak of the bed as Malfoy stands up, probably putting on his trousers now, and then a sigh. “Which you already know the answer to.”
After a blink of surprise, Draco's silver eyes narrowed in suspicion. “Who told you that? Was it Vincent?”
Draco grinned, eyes flickering to Harry's hair. “Of course it did. Only magic can tame that beast,” he said, reaching up to fix said beast a bit. “What else?”
“Harry, you didn’t tell him anything, right?” whispered Hermione, sounding concerned “About Sirius?"
“You have quite a collection, Harry,” commented Draco easily as he examined the parchment, calm and perfectly unaware of Hermione's words. “There are some names here I don’t know."
“Yes, I have been rather busy.” Draco’s voice sounded steady, but he still paused and took a deep breath before going on. “I have done some thinking too.”
The man’s eyebrows furrowed. “Harry, what would you have done if I told you?” The question caught Harry off guard and the man continued, ”Would you have gone to the dungeons and told him?”
Harry smiled to himself as they started talking, resting his head on his arms as he watched over them. Of course, like any reasonable person listening to a conversation about numbers, he quickly fell asleep.
With an apologetic look at Draco, Harry hurried to the Great Hall entrance. Ron stood by the stairs, backing up them slowly as Hermione advanced, face twisted in anger. Ron looked up at him, making Hermione notice him too.
Snape’s eyes flashed dangerously. “Out,” he said through gritted teeth, and Harry had never seen the man so angry before. “Now.”
Harry held his arms, squeezing them lightly. "I am taking this seriously, I promise. I'll ask Neville tonight, I'm sure he will be happy to help and bring out all the books he has and won't let me sleep until he tells me all about Mandrakes."
They both turned to look at him, making him freeze mid chewing a piece of his turkey sandwich. He gulped it down, glancing between their expectant looks.
Harry frowned, “You were doing well before, Ron. Trust me, it’s just the nerves." He eyed the field, checking that he still had time, “I make a fool of myself when I’m nervous too, you know. I mean, last year I ended up opening the Golden Egg in the middle of the owlery because I didn’t come up with a good way to explain it to Draco."
It had taken a few minutes to convince Neville that he was not under any sort of spell, and even after that, he kept sending them nervous furtive glances.
Remus hushed them into the car. “Don’t bother the Aurors, Sirius,” he said sternly as he helped Harry place Hedwig’s cage next to him on the seat. It had been magically enlarged to fit more people, to the point it now resembled a modern sofa.
There were still a few that remained put off by the idea. Seamus kept his startled gaze flickering back and forth from the speakers to Dean, who just laughed at every confession. Cormac McLaggen had a look of disgust on his face, openly staring at every speaker and shaking his head in disapproval. And Ron- Harry had to repress a snort because if Ron had pearls like his aunt did, he would certainly be clutching them. He seemed startled into silence, freckled face going pale, looking as if he were facing Voldemort and Aragog at the same time.
thought Harry as he skipped the second question. And Draco wasn’t planning to continue it either, unlike Hermione, who, as usual, was ready to take as many classes as she could.
“I would have done the same,” said a smooth voice. Blaise gave Ginny a wink before turning to Harry with a smile. “Harry, my friend, how have you been?”
Harry had seen truffles before, delivered to his aunt by his uncle quite often, always shared with Dudley and obviously never with him, but these looked
“Well, bye,” said Harry hastily, only pausing on his steps after Dumbledore when Dudley approached with an extended big hand.
thought Harry. He didn’t understand why Dumbledore couldn’t do it, but once again the Headmaster had been ignoring him all year.
Hermione immediately turned to give Harry a serious look. "That is true, they should sign," she said, the words 'Unlike someone' unsaid but still understood by Harry, who turned towards the Slytherins.
“I don’t care,” said Harry but Draco didn’t meet his eyes. Harry clicked his tongue and slid to the floor, kneeling before him. “Draco, look at me,” he said, taking his hands into his. “I don’t care.”
“Bill and I are getting married!” announced Fleur, raising a hand to show Harry the silver band on one of her fingers.
“That was weird.” Ron let out a weird laugh, one hand going to rub his neck as he turned to Harry. “She said I’m funny, right?”
“Career advice,” sighed Harry, his head resting against the stone wall of the alcove. He had felt reluctant to use the map at first; it was his father’s and Harry didn’t know what to think about the man now, or Sirius, or Remus. But it had been worth it, because thanks to it he had found the alcove, hidden behind a large tapestry on the sixth floor, and now he and Draco could study together in peace.
The smile on the ginger’s face dropped, as he looked down at the board. Harry asked Ron if he was glad to finally have someone to play against and a pawn flew towards his face.
But Draco gave him a silent nod and slowly placed the towel on Harry’s hair. He seemed to take in a little breath, his chest puffing just so slightly before he started pressing down gently, carefully squeezing tufts of dark hair with the towel.
. He stands up and shrugs off his jacket, pointedly not looking at Malfoy as he places it over his shoulders. “Wait here,” he says and runs out of the room before the other can answer.
But the letter stayed the same. His name, a single line, no signature. No signature! Harry clenched his teeth, left the letter on the bed before he could crush it and paced in circles around his room, now that he had the room to do so. “Damn it, Draco,” he muttered, feeling angry for a hot second. He glared at Hedwig. “And damn you too!”
Draco shook his head. “Nonsense, I understand." It really sounded like he meant it, but Harry wasn't convinced.
type,” said Ron, waving his fork as carelessly as his words. Then, when Hermione scowled at him, he tried to explain himself, “I mean, you aren’t that kind of girl, you know? Like the one that has dates- I mean, you are not like
Harry isn’t deterred. “You don’t owe him any respect. You shouldn’t feel anything but anger at him. Hatred,” he says, his voice so smooth he is surprised it’s not parseltongue. “Don’t you want vengeance?” he continues but Malfoy isn’t looking at him and Harry opens his mouth, “Draco.”
“No! Master Draco, don’t ask Kreacher!” The elf was on the verge of tears, his voice trembling noticeably. “The half-blood will hear! It’s against Miss Cissy’s orders, against Master Lucius’ orders-”
Hermione gaped at him as if looking for something to say, but when she and Harry crossed gazes she let out a laugh, that turned into a fit the other two joined in. The rest of the table gave them weird looks and Neville silently pushed a glass of water towards them when Ron started coughing, having started laughing in the middle of a bite.
The silence on the table became uncomfortable, so Harry, who had kept wisely out of the conversation, passed his bite of treacle tart and cleared his throat. “So,” he asked Ginny, because Ron was brooding and Hermione strangely quiet. “Dean Thomas? When did that happen?”
“But I’m telling the truth!” protested Harry, sitting up to look at him. “Voldemort is out there, and the Ministry keeps feeding lies to everyone, and now they aren’t even going to teach us how to defend ourselves!"
He blinked and frowned a Ron, who retreated his hand to grab a scone. “What is it?” he asked, picking at his own food. The sudden revelation had left him less hungry, somehow.
“Don’t be daft. Two times per week will suffice,” said Draco, fixing his scarf. He leaned in to give Harry another peck on the lips, to Ron’s dismay. “See you next term, Scarhead,” he said before he was dragged away by his friends. Harry watched him go.
They walked out of the Hog’s Head an hour later, with a smiling Hermione and a list signed by the everyone that had shown up, including Zacharias Smith.
Harry reluctantly handed them to her, rolling his eyes when she carefully examined them. “They are fine, Hermione. Just normal pufferfish spines.”
“Monday, it’s the fifth,” mused Hermione. “The fifth of June. And if it’s Zabini then this has to be about
” retorted Draco, with a hint of bitterness on his voice. For a brief moment he paused, eerily still, and when he turned to smile at Harry there was an intensity in his silver eyes. “Sleep easy, love,” he said, the wish sounding like a promise.
Sirius didn't shut up, his grin growing even wider. “Maybe we could invite my little cousin for dinner, I’m sure Kreacher would be delighted."
“Your little Defense group,” finished Sirius, startling the other two. “By the way, Ron, your mother says you are not allowed to take part in any
“Ah, I see,” said Draco simply, turning his gaze towards the carriage, where everyone else was already seated. Something made him pause briefly, and then he extended a hand to Harry without taking his eyes off the carriage. “Help me up, will you?"
Draco frowned. “Surely you know there must be a reason you were given three months to prepare, Potter.”
to know the truth and have everyone call me a liar. Not only that toad and Fudge but also the rest of the school."
The moon eyes open again to meet his frown and the wolf lets out another whimper. "Don't look at me like that," says Harry sternly. "You don't like me, you will be angry that I saw you like this."
Feeling his own eyes starting to burn, Harry hugged him back tightly, shuffling closer between his legs to press them together. “I will have your back,” he whispered against his ear, feeling how Draco shuddered. “I promise, I will do everything I can, you know how I feel about you.”
Draco managed a small smile. “I appreciate it, but I already know what the verdict will be. I just hope we get to see him before” his voice faltered and he cleared his throat, “before he is sent off. Excuse me for a moment,” he said as he stood up to leave the compartment.
Harry watched as he shuffled further into the tavern until he disappeared behind a crowd and Harry turned to look at Draco. “Do you think the thestrals did," he gestured at his own face, "that?”
She met his gaze with serene yellow eyes and chirped, in an almost chastising tone that made Harry look down to the book again, placing it on the pile before grabbing his bundle of old letters.
PD: Just a little advertising, but in case you didn't know, this is the second part of a series! Please make sure to check the first part as well!
“I’m sure he would,” said Hermione suddenly, and Harry and Ron turned to look at her to make sure she hadn’t gone crazy.
“I figured that out when she stormed off and he stood there looking like a stricken baboon,” said Malfoy with an amused grin. “But I don’t blame her for thinking he was joking. A Slytherin with a Gryffindor?
“I see,” said Angelina, pausing to think for a brief moment before frowning at Harry. “This better not affect your performance, Potter. The first match is against Slytherin and
. “He is pretty amazing.” Harry looked at his glass, tapping his fingers against it slowly. The treacle tart didn’t look that appetising now.
"Oh, alright. Well, you are way better at this than me. Potions, not crushing." Harry cleared his throat. "Well, as I was saying I'm glad she said yes because McGonagall would have had my head otherwise."
“That’s not what I asked,” cut off Harry. He searched for his eyes again, trying to read what was in them. Because he would do anything for Draco if he asked, even something as painful as letting him go, but he needed to know. “Do you want to end this?”
It was faster this time, the spell hitting the dummy even before it was fully uttered, the wand snatched away by an invisible force. Harry turned to Draco with a grin, finding the blond looking at him sternly. "Do you teach everyone like this?" Harry looked down at his hand, still resting on Draco's back. Now that he was aware of it, the softness of the shirt was rather captivating. "Because if you do, we are going to have a problem, Potter."
He was halfway to the Dungeons when he heard the discussion, loud enough to be heard down the hallway and make Harry rush over.
“If he needs to listen to it underwater, he only needs to get his head in,” said Draco. His cheeks were slightly pink as he added, “There’s no need for anything else."
“You are surprisingly superficial.” Despite his words, Draco smiled smugly. “But yes, it would be. And there have been incidents before, so only my father tends to them."
Harry drummed his fingers on the short stone wall by the entrance to Hogsmeade as he waited. Steps on the snow reached his ears, making him look up again to see a familiar group of Slytherins passing-by, throwing him amused looks.
“I was hoping for an O in Potions." Harry sighed. There went the only career he had considered following.
“How did he get you?” asked Harry. It was clear that everyone invited apart from her was somehow related to an influential person, which left the question of why Slughorn snatched her as well.
He went back to watching the blond as he studied, noticing that the blush hadn’t disappeared, and fell asleep after a while, waking up to fingers absentmindedly threading through his hair while their owner read about Charms under his breath.
Ron shrugged. “Aren’t you dating Dean now? And last year it was Corner, right? Look, I’m not saying it’s a
Harry nodded. “Works perfectly,” he said, but then looked at his crestfallen godfather. “But, uh, I could use a new pair of gloves, maybe? Mine don’t fit so well anymore.”
Sirius snorted. “Yeah, yeah." He passed an arm around Harry's shoulders. "Well, let’s get downstairs now, let’s show everyone what your
"Have you come up with a way to stay underwater for that long?" asked Draco. "There's less than a week left, now."
The blond looked away, grabbing the towel off his shoulder and fiddling with it. He cleared his throat, “We should leave before a Prefect decides to take a bath,” he said, making way to the door. Before exiting, he added, “I’ll keep an eye out.”
On Sunday, Harry spent the day following Draco around the library. The blond had turned out to be quite studious, maybe as much as Hermione, and wanted to get ahead before classes began.
“Professor?” Harry was the first on his feet. The Headmaster was wearing a purple robe, his half-moon glasses and a serious expression. However, the latter turned to one of tranquillity when he saw them.
“Listen, I’ll pester Snivellus about it next time I see him, alright?” Sirius spoke up again, giving Harry’s shoulder a squeeze. “I’ll mention that Draco hasn’t been in contact, but if you want my opinion, I think it’s probably because of Narcissa.”
“It’s Sirius,” said Harry urgently. He didn’t care that Nott and Parkinson were there to listen, there was no time for discretion. “He is in danger, I have to go to the Department of Mysteries.”
“Oh, aren’t you?” Draco shoved at him, making him step back. “Everything is going great for you now, isn’t it? Fudge lost his power, Dumbledore is back, everyone knows the Dark Lord has returned. Merlin, I think even Black might be cleared out soon!” Draco let out a mirthless laugh, his silver eyes starting to well up in frustration. “Everything always goes well for you! Always! But now I can’t even blame Dumbledore, no-” His voice cracked as he clenched his own shirt. “I did this.
“Is being bossy a Black trait?” murmured Harry, grinning when Sirius looked offended. “Yeah, yeah, I’m going.” He climbed the stairs two steps at the time, noticing how the house looked much cleaner than last time. It seemed that Sirius had been as excited to live with him as Harry had.
“That’s not even how the saying goes, Ron,” said Hermione. “And you can’t just ask Harry to forget everything like that. You are so insensitive!”
Draco paused, looking at him carefully, for long enough that they became the only two people standing in the hall. Then he smiled, a small curve of his lips that didn't really reach his eyes. “Yes, everything’s fine."
“That’s one way of putting it”, huffed Ron. “It was a disaster, and then a complete dramatic tale with those two."
Draco scrunched his nose. "That sounds boring." He leaned closer to Harry to examine his parchment. "What else are you planning?"
Lucius Malfoy stopped his conversation with Fudge, turning to look at them with disdain. The resemblance to his son was striking and Harry didn’t know how to feel about that.
His back was against the wall, his head slightly crooked forwards from the low ceiling. There was a pink tint on his face, not out of place because they were very close, chests pressing into each other. It felt like a standstill again, Draco blinking at him and Harry not moving from when he had him pinned
Sirius grimaced. “What can I say? I definitely don’t see him running around with you and your illegal group, for starters."
“No, I meant to ask a question on the course aims,” said Hermione. “There’s no mention of defensive spells."
Sirius only spared him a cold glance before looking at Harry. “Your father would be very disappointed in you."
The inside of the owlery wasn't warm in any way, but at least the walls offered protection from the raging wind. A familiar chirp brought his attention up, towards the spot on the wall where Hedwig was nestled between two other owls.
Harry found himself hurrying up the slippery stairs, not really sure of what he was doing. Even if Malfoy had gone to the owlery instead of the dungeons, it had been more than an hour since Moody humiliated him. He would probably be gone by now.
He stopped to address the other Slytherins before exiting. “I can only hope you three are smarter than him,” he said coolly, and then slammed the door shut.
The blond was in the middle of writing an essay for Arithmancy, and Harry, who had already finished his essay for Transfiguration, just watched him in silence. Judging from the complicated charts Draco was consulting and the slight frown on his face, the essay was no easy task.
Harry carefully followed their voices, coming to stand in the pathway of shelves behind theirs, the books hiding him from view.
“I warned them that signing meant they weren’t going to tell,” said Hermione. “If they abide by their word, nothing will happen to them."
." Draco looked a bit pink, and Harry wondered if it had been something he had said. Then he licked his lips and Harry didn’t think about much.
Harry stared as the Slytherins settled around a table at the other corner of the room. Slughorn stood by them, but he only had eyes for Zabini, ignoring Parkinson, Nott and Draco in the same fashion he had ignored Ron and Hermione.
“I think that’s for me to decide, isn’t it?” A surge of anger made Harry drag his eyes off the tapestry to glare at his startled godfather. “Or are there more things you have decided are not
Malfoy scrunched up his nose in graceful disgust, and it spoke of Harry's loneliness that he felt comforted by that.
“You certainly didn’t,” said Draco, sounding slightly impressed. “But that will have to wait until after the Task.” He grinned at him. “I wanted to wish you good luck, but it seems like you won’t need it. You are going to win, right?”
Neville gave him a nervous smile, making Harry feel a bit less guilty about his plan. He passed by Parkinson on his way to the front, the girl throwing him a nasty glare before planting herself beside Neville, who looked terrified
Harry ignored her, just like he ignored the many eyes looking at him through glass planes. All he cared about was ahead, and apparently at the very end of the train because just as they were about to reach the final compartments, Blaise slipped past him and stood on his way.
“I’m still here, you know,” called a shrill voice, which quickly rose to the top of the list of Harry’s most hated things in the world.
They watched from the stairs how the stubbly hand of Umbridge kept searching around, as if sure there had been something there.
The fur is soft and alive under his fingers, and without as much difficulty as he first expected, Harry falls asleep with the sound of another breathing next to his.
“Just making sure,” said Draco, smiling at him again. He then paused, and glanced away briefly before speaking again, “I can ask you something else now if you’d like."
Ron nodded. “Just by the register,” he said, pointing behind him. “Mum’s there too, she’s buying Ginny this weird thing called a Pygmy Puff. It’s this fuzzy ball that barely moves.”
Around the room, murmurs filled the silence as fingers were raised to chins and eyebrows were furrowed. Harry could almost hear the minds of his housemates working.
“We should get out of here before he returns,” says Harry, but he doesn’t move from where he is standing. There is
meant to ask Harry, but at that moment he caught view of Draco standing just by the stone wall and talking with Parkinson and Luna.
“He isn’t!” retorted Ron with not concealed disgust, looking around for support. To his surprise, only Seamus and a group of the guys agreed loudly. Others, like Harry himself, chose to stay quiet, watching the others as if they were a play.
Hermione gave him a soft smile. "He said that two people that look at each other the way you do shouldn't be kept apart."
It works. Surprise makes Malfoy snap his gaze to him and Harry sees it, a spark of intense anger in his grey eyes, and that makes him grin because that is
Seemingly calmed by his answer, Draco smiled at him. “Open the entire ballroom just for that? No, the drawing-room was enough for us."
It was too late; three stunning spells hit her right in the chest. Warrington and Bulstrode jumped in alarm and turned towards Draco, Crabbe and Goyle, but Parkinson and -to Harry’s puzzlement- a reluctant Nott already had their wands raised. "I'd rather not do the same to you," said Parkinson but her wand didn't lower an inch.
“I do know,” said Draco in a low voice. He was still looking at Hagrid’s bruises and cuts. “Did the thestrals do that?” he asked carefully, as if afraid of the answer.
“He can walk on his own, thank you,” said Sirius in a haughty tone as he pushed Harry across the barrier.
As the days passed, Harry discovered that Draco Malfoy sent letters home twice a week, which was more than most students did. Hermione wrote to his parents once a month, and Ron only did it during Holidays or special circumstances. Harry…, well, Harry wished he could write to Sirius as often. But it wasn’t as simple as that. His godfather had yet to answer his first letter.
Ron seemed scandalised, and last night’s mental picture of him clutching his pearls made Harry snort into his juice. “What are you talking about?” Ron whispered harshly, looking from side to side and if scared of others hearing. “Hermione, they are
“Er, I knew about this,” explained Harry. “Not from Ron and Hermione,” he added when there were frowns directed at his friends.
Harry had to stop looking at the exchange when he was tackled from behind by the rest of the team and pushed into a loud celebration. He quickly noticed the absence of Ron, who was making his way out of the field alone.
Harry hadn’t wiped the smile off his face when people started pouring into the room, covered in snow and carrying what they had bought. Some looked at him weirdly, Seamus straight out asked him if he was okay, but he couldn’t be bothered but to raise his hand in a vague greeting.
“Ah, it’s Harry,” said Goyle. Harry hadn’t noticed him, just like he hadn’t noticed Theodore Nott, who sat in front of Draco and was now staring at him with wide eyes. But Harry couldn’t even muster the question of
They walked back to the castle, parting ways near the entrance. Harry watched him disappear down a corridor, and then headed to the Gryffindor Tower.
. Harry rubs his neck, feeling less angry now. The wolf had acted scared, sad, had recognized Harry and let him stay with him. Was that all wolf, or was it Malfoy?
Draco immediately frowned at him. “You are a git,” he deadpanned. "I’ll beat you next year, you will see."
“What did you say?" asked Ron, bringing a hand to his wet chin to clean the drops rolling down from it as he looked at the person responsible for his outburst.
“Are you done now?” asked Ron, lowering the hand he had fakely coughed into. “Because I think Neville is about to faint," he added, jerking his head towards the shocked boy, who kept rubbing his eyes as if he had just woken up.
The moon eyes are still fixed on his, in an almost cautious manner, and the nose twitches, like Aunt Marge's dog's did whenever food was nearby, only there isn't any food now. Harry's wand is still on his hand, a certain spell on his head, and he is just getting ready to use it when the wolf takes a sudden step forwards and presses its snout against Harry's neck.
“- now, do you know everyone, Harry?” Slughorn was smiling at him. “Of course, Blaise is in your year so you must have seen each other.”
The final match of Quidditch season found a Gryffindor team that had suffered great losses. Fred and George's final prank had earned them admiration and raised the spirits of the entire castle, but their leave now meant that Gryffindor had lost their beaters, in addition to the Seeker. With Dumbledore gone, there was no one to stop Umbridge from banning Harry from playing.
“Harry, it’s nice to see you,” said Bill with a smile, reaching out a hand for Harry to shake. There was a ring Harry hadn’t seen before on his finger. “Happy birthday!”
“He’s too useful,” continued Remus, turning back to the street. “That’s good for him, if not for us. But Florean…” He sighed. “We can only hope.”
“Look who's back,” mused Hermione when he plopped down on the couch next to her. She had three different books open on her lap, and a piece of parchment on her hands.
The grey eyes were as pretty as ever, even from all the way across the hall, but they weren’t smiling at him. Their corners had fallen when they saw him, and Harry wanted to run across the hall and hold their owner close to him.
“The Tales of Beedle the Bard,” read Hermione, already opening it to the first page. She must have seen the dedication, because she immediately gave Harry a little grin.
Draco placed a finger on his lips, “I know” he said. His hand cupped Harry’s face as he looked sadly into his eyes. “I know it’s not going to be easy, Harry, but I want to try.” He gave him an uncertain look. “Do you?”
Harry crossed his arms and leaned against the door. “Can you do that later? We won’t see each other for a while and I’d rather spend as much time as I can with you.”
“But Malfoy is a pointy faced bastard! He looks like a pointy albino goblin-troll,” finished Ron, angrily biting a piece of bread.
"Yes," said Harry, eyes tracing the parchment. "You should be able to get to the Tower without any problem."
she had explained during a D.A meeting to an interested Goyle, who had been convinced and now read The Quibbler as gospel. The same magazine where Harry would accuse his father along with Crabbe’s and Draco’s.
“He- What?” Sirius seemed confused. “So your boyfriend is mad at you and you get mad at me? The fuck did I do?”
Draco stopped for a moment, before laughing even harder. “What the hell? That’s just weird,” he said between chuckles. It was a glorious sound, bright in the middle of the awful day. Harry would miss it terribly during summer, but he didn’t want to bring that up again.
Harry gripped his parchment a bit tighter. With his luck, a gale of wind could snatch it away from him and he would have to go all the way back to the common room for more. Apart from the long way being a hassle, Harry didn't really want to be there.
But Skeeter’s article hadn’t come out on Monday, nor Tuesday, nor Wednesday. And now it had been more than a week and the woman was nowhere to be seen, which only made Harry feel that whatever she was planning grew worse by the day.
“Oh, shut up,” said Harry. He started pushing his laughing friends towards the exit. “Now leave, will you?"
But Harry’s biggest problem stood to the side, hair gleaming under the sunlight, looking paler than usual in a contrast with his dark green and black robes that came out as striking. Their eyes met and Harry’s nerves completely vanished because Draco was looking at him the same way he had done a year ago, a challenge issued on his clever eyes and a white smirk on his lips. It was a boastful look that sent a rush through Harry and made him grin in return.
A hand gently pulled his face forwards, until most of his field of vision was made of Draco’s mesmerizing silver eyes. “I told you you could try to get more,” he murmured, so close Harry felt the movement.
He was looking out the window, chin resting in one hand that seemed even paler under the dark sleeve of his suit. Harry couldn’t see his face, but he saw the quiet slump of his shoulders, one that would be slight in anyone else but in Draco made Harry’s blood run cold.
“Well,” said Draco finally, calling his attention back to him. He let out another sigh, dropped his gaze from the ceiling to Harry and flashed him an enigmatic white grin. “That’s for me to know, and for you to find out, isn’t it?”
“Plenty,” said Malfoy, his grin turning malicious. “But I’m not sharing, Potter, as payback for disrupting the peace of the owls.”
A hand fell on his shoulder, and time started running again. Draco stepped back, turning heel and doubling the corner again, Harry’s half-raised hand not enough to stop him. Zabini visibly sighed, throwing Harry an annoyed look before following after his friend. But Parkinson stood there, glaring darkly at him, hand clenching around her wand.
“Stop trying to distract us, Weasley,” cut in Draco. “It’s your move.” The blond watched as Ron made to move a piece. “Oh,
“I can’t believe even McGonagall knows,” said Harry as they headed back to the Gryffindor Tower for their free period.
“Just because,” replied Draco coolly, and his eyes didn’t show a sliver of doubt before he turned around to face the door. “Let’s just leave this here.”
“Flattery,” mused Draco. He directed Harry a white grin. “Keep it up. Do you agree with what they said?”
Harry could only look at him. Malfoy had put himself together again, hair and uniform neatly in place, but he looked uncharacteristically defeated, and that made Harry even more guilty about not doing anything.
“Oh,” said Draco, reaching up to touch them. After a pause, the blond cleared his throat. “Thank you, Harry."
As winter progressed, the snow atop of the stairs kept increasing, the grey stone almost completely covered by the whiteness, and the biting cold made one want to rush up them, all care thrown to the air.
“He does, Hermione, but,” Ron shrugged. “I don’t know, he's still his dad, and Draco- Merlin, he doesn’t deserve all this shit.”
The man licked his lips. “But they don’t know we know, which means we can turn this to our advantage,” he let out a snicker that still managed to sound like a dog’s, “Oh, Mad-Eye is going to love this. He will probably let me go along too!”
“Potter,” hissed a voice and Harry’s attention was pulled back to the group. Moody was studying him, following Harry’s former line of sight and frowning.
But he didn’t, because he saw the way Draco sucked in a breath as if hurt, and then he felt even more disheartened when Draco’s voice trembled when he spoke. "I'm not a-"
Lupin's eyebrows furrowed in a frown. "Harry, surely you understand why we might feel troubled by this."
Surely enough, the robes are still in the same place Malfoy had left them after shrugging them off. It was a smart move, all things considered, as Harry supposed one wouldn’t want to wake up to destroyed clothes every morning.
Despite it having been asked before, this time the question caught Harry off guard. Because instead of demanding and expectant, it had been asked with the fear of a person that already knew the answer and didn’t want to hear it.
your fault, Potter. And yes, I said gone. Staying at the castle after what they just pulled would be a deathwish. If not expelled, Umbridge would have them in detention for the rest of the year.”
Harry had rushed to write back, a tight feeling on his chest as he whispered several curses. He hated it all. Hated Voldemort for creating this hateful war, Lucius for getting involved, the Ministry just because, and also himself for not being able to be there when Draco needed him.
Harry shrugged. “I’m still on first place.” Technically, he was tied with Cedric for it, but that didn’t sound as good.
Harry scowled. “Just get out of here, Zacharias.” Smith attempted to do so, but Draco’s wand remained where it was, pressing into the Hufflepuff’s skin. “Draco,” said Harry, bringing a hand to lower the other’s arm.
Draco had frozen as well. “Hello, professor,” he offered politely, grey eyes stopping on the fresh cuts on his face and widening slightly.
to the wall. The blond tilted his head slightly, his lips pursed in consideration, his silver eyes studying Harry, who just looked back at him, unsure of what he was doing.
“I just got hit with a Jelly-Leg Curse, but Pomfrey refused to let me out of her watch in case I got hit with something else.” Draco sighed. “I got lucky, really. Did you see Pansy’s antlers? She was so upset about them. Vincent didn’t really mind the flippers, but Greg kept scratching his blisters so Pomfrey had to give him a Sleeping Draught.” He looked at another bed further away. “And Theo got hit with a Tongue-Tying curse, quite painful.”
"You filthy-" muttered Malfoy, face flushed as he angrily fumbled for his wand. Harry panicked and reached out to stop him from hexing Ron, but a sudden loud yell and the blazing light of a spell startled him back.
“Molly!” cut in Mr Weasley. He gave his wife a meaningful look and then looked at the teenagers around the table. “Well, if we are all done-”
The git scoffed and went back into the building. Happy for a small victory at the end, Harry walked down the remaining slippery steps.
He couldn’t help but groan at the sudden loss, reluctantly opening his eyes again and finding a view that made him blink twice. Draco’s face was completely red, weakly frowning down at Harry as he covered his mouth with a hand. The other one was on Harry's chest, keeping a small distance between them, and Harry finally noticed Draco's back was pressed against the wall.
Monday finally came and Harry found himself in a good mood. He felt well-rested after a long night of dreaming of constellations and soft words. Seamus left the room before Harry had even left the bed as usual, as he had been avoiding him after their discussion, but that didn’t sour his mood. Neither did the way other students seemed to open a way for him as he walked down the halls towards the Great Hall.
Luna shook her head, making the Eagle on top of her hat wobble along. "Not today, but if you want my Slytherin hat I could bring it for you."
Mundungus opened and closed his mouth like a fish, switching from looking at Remus, Sirius and Harry. Then, "Well, how was I supposed to know that?! No one told me anything! The last-" He hiccuped again "-The last time I was here, he was still a-"
It puzzled Harry and made him rethink his answer. The reason he had omitted three names hadn't been pity, as Skeeter viciously suggested, nor fear of Draco breaking up with him, like Hermione did. No, back at the Three Broomsticks Harry had only been thinking about Draco's face whenever he received a letter from home, or when he spoke about his childhood.
The four students seemed to share a telepathic conversation via a single look, and after a few moments and short nods, Zabini stepped forward, steps sure and chin raised so elegantly Harry was expecting him to knight someone.
Moody nodded, before letting out another roar when the ferret tried to run away. “Oh, I don’t think so!” He brought up his wand again and the ferret flew ten feet up the air before dropping down to the floor and bouncing up again, and again. “Attacking someone with their back turned, you coward, sneaky-”
“Here goes nothing,” said Harry, and opened the egg. The shrill didn’t come, instead, there was a pretty golden glow and a muffled voice. He looked at Draco, before submerging his head, the hand on his back gently supporting him.
Draco did look at him this time, turning around to meet his angry glare with a neutral one. Then the blond looked down, worrying his lower lip with his teeth as he frowned at the floor for a moment before returning to Harry. He took a deep breath and said, “Just call the house.”
Harry nodded, gesture pointless because Draco’s attention was solely focused on the silver stag as if it were telling him a very important secret. Harry shuffled on his feet, nervous but transfixed by the odd scene, and the way the light seemed to reflect on Draco’s eyes.
Harry did as he asked and sat down next to him while he examined the cloak. “Merlin, I wanted one of these but my father didn’t budge,” said Draco, rubbing the fabric between his fingers. “What is it made of? Demiguise?”
“Oh, right. You mentioned something like that at the Ministry too,” said Mr Weasley, sitting down again.
The last rays of sunshine filtered into the room through the old blue curtains, as Harry contemplated the mess of all his things on the floor. Knowing he would be leaving the Durselys, and this time forever, in a week, he hadn’t bothered to unpack when he first arrived. Yet now that the day had finally come, he found himself restless and, perhaps for the first time in his life, fully emptied his trunk.
Harry snorted. “Don’t worry, there won’t be any more visits in the near future,” he said, thinking back to that particular trainwreck. An idea popped up in his head. “You know,” he added, keeping an eye on Draco. “The cave is still open."
“Her face!” he cried, holding onto Harry as he succumbed to a fit of laughter, his head falling against his shoulder. “Oh, Merlin.”
Harry wasn’t convinced, and it must have shown on his face because his godfather sighed and squeezed his shoulders. “No one thinks it’s your fault, Harry. We will figure it out, don’t worry about it. I’m sure it will be fine." Sirius smiled at him. “Plus, it’s thanks to your connection that Arthur is now sitting with his family, and not, well..., you know."
At least until Dumbledore showed up, with an entrance Draco called extremely dramatic under his breath. The great oak doors to the Entrance Hall had opened, making everyone fall silent as the Headmaster walked in the circle. Umbridge looked a second away from snapping her own wand when Dumbledore brought up the authority that remained with the Headmaster and asked McGonagall to escort Trelawney to her rooms again.
“You weren’t.” Harry was starting to feel irritated. “It’s hard to explain and I don’t have much time, but he didn’t betray me or the D.A. He is just making Umbridge believe he did.”
Harry glanced at the bench the blond was sitting on, noticing the now empty bottle of ink. He then looked down at the almost finished Transfiguration essay he had been working on and scrunched his nose.
“It would have been fun to be prefects together,” said Draco. “But maybe this way I can make sure you don’t do anything stupid. You better behave, Harry, I can deduct points, you know."
Sirius pursed his lips, then smirking mischievously. “Well, then I-" He broke off suddenly, looking at the wall of the fireplace in alarm and vanishing just before a hand appeared, startling the three of them into stepping away.
“Yeah,” said Harry, looking down at it for a second. It was warm. Then he looked up and returned the smile. “Yeah, thank you,” he said, reaching to hold Draco’s hand in his. It was warm too and Harry couldn’t resist the impulse to bring it to his lips and kiss it.
“They tried to help him,” muttered Nott, jerking his head towards Ron, and Harry had never wanted to punch him in the nose so much, but he was quickly distracted from his anger when Draco walked in along Crabbe and Goyle. The blond's eyes widened when he saw Harry on the floor and Umbridge towering over him, but he remained behind with the rest of the Squad while the woman started questioning Harry again.
The team was already inside the changing rooms, listening to Angelina as she gave the last instructions. Fred and George shared a look with Harry when Ron kept putting on his uniform backwards, then approaching his brother to pat his back. “They have new beaters this year,” was saying Angelina, checking from a piece of parchment. “Two blokes called Crabbe and Goyle. Haven’t heard of them before, but they don’t look bright enough to tell one end of the broom from another."
Harry smiled. “As long as he doesn’t predict my death every class, I’m good.” He offered Draco his hand again, now that there was no one around. “Library?”
"But I can't be with you, Harry," said the blond, unshed tears threatening to spill from his eyes. "I have duties as a son, and I can't leave them behind."
They were among the last to arrive at the Common Room, but Harry was the first to the dorm. While everyone had stayed downstairs to catch up with their friends, he had walked up the stairs and closed the door behind him.
Harry sighed and looked around the room. It was as decadent as the rest of the house, the green wallpaper starting to peel off. “So, how have-."
Harry stared at him, wondering if something had gone wrong with the universe because it sounded like Malfoy was trying to comfort him.
“I suppose I owe him as well,” mumbled Draco, making Harry’s eyes flicker to him again. Draco met his gaze, a faint blush spreading on his cheeks. He cleared his throat. “Anyway. He can’t be worse than Trelawney.”
“Amortentia!” said Hermione. “The most powerful love potion in the world. It is supposed to smell different for everyone, according to the things that attract us the most. For example-”
An idea popped into Harry’s head, so ridiculous he almost dismissed it immediately. But, again, the whole situation was ridiculous, so maybe the idea that Malfoy felt jealous of his friends wasn’t that far fetched.
With a sigh, Harry broke apart from the mirror and walked up the stairs towards his room. Hedwig was still in her open cage, and blinked slowly at him in greeting before letting out a soft hoot.
thought Harry, eyeing a customer whose face was fully covered by bandages. He turned to look at Hermione, who was moving chairs to open space by a corner of the room. “How many people are we expecting, exactly?"
Hermione hummed. "Actually, Harry, there is someone that is quite good at Defense, and has actual experience."
They stared at each other while recovering their breath, Harry basking in the shine over Draco’s lips and then the smile he cracked before speaking to him, “Get off me, you oaf."
Hermione put her hands on his shoulders. "Harry, if someone can find a way to overcome all this, it's you" she smiled. "With our help, of course."
“Snakes do have their own language, after all,” added Draco, tracing a finger on the side of his tankard absentmindedly.
“You should hear Molly,” mumbled Lupin, but his face seemed more relaxed now. At least as much as it could, because the man always looked tired.
"No," said Draco, taking a moment to take a deep breath before looking at Harry. He seemed to have recovered some of his composure, because his voice sounded haughty when he spoke up again, "But what I did mind was being kissed inside a
“You heard?” Draco tilted his head, then blinking. “Ah, right, you left just after the match began.”
A bit of a short chapter today! I'll see you on Thursday (as long as my work doesn't catch up to me, that is haha...ugh. I'll do my best!)
buying a new Firebolt, Padfoot.” Remus ignored Sirius’ long whine and turned to Harry. “Yours works well, right?”
“Don’t be scared mom, he does this at Hogwarts too,” laughed Ron, biting into a sandwich. “Every day."
“But I did, and then at the office, with Dumbledore- Sirius, I felt so angry at him, as if I wanted to hurt him too." Harry was almost afraid to utter the next words, "What if Voldemort it’s making me like him? What if I’m going bad?"
“Say anything about me. Call me a traitor, or tell me that my father would hate me. Whatever you want,” Harry raised a finger at his godfather. “But don’t ever say anything about him. You don't know
“Liar!” yelled Umbridge, violently throwing him to the floor. Harry's head hit the desk painfully, but now he could see the office clearly. Umbridge was standing in front of him, pointing her wand at him in a clear threat, and in a corner of the room stood Parkinson, holding Hermione by the arm while her dark eyes were fixed on Harry in annoyment. The door opened seconds later, and in walked more members of the Squad. Warrington dragged Ron inside by the shoulder and was followed by Nott and Bulstrode pointing their wands at the backs of Neville and Ginny.
It didn’t fool Harry for a second. He could tell that under that misleading neutrality was a storm brewing. So he snapped himself out of it and crossed the room, avoiding the clusters of customers and catching the door just before it closed. The rain had turned into a downpour and there was no one outside but the shop-hoppers getting from one shelter to another. The clouds had darkened the sky and its raindrops splattered on Harry’s glasses, blurring his vision as he went after his boyfriend as fast as he could without running, getting soaked in the process.
Sirius laughed against the rim of his cup of wine. "You won't once you hear this; Snivellus is taking over as the Defense teacher."
It appeared that the harshness of his tone had startled not only Harry, because Draco flinched too, lips twisting in a grimace. “I’m sorry,” said Draco, and now that he spoke again Harry could see how off his voice had been before. “I’m alright. I apologize for not writing.”
The cold breeze of the exterior hit them both, and Harry cast a warming charm on them as they made way to the rose garden.
“If you keep this attitude you are going to fail,” chastised Hermione, finally reaching the end of the table and catching up to them as they left the Great Hall.
His voice startled Harry, because it sounded completely pissed, as if he was outraged at having to say anything in the first place, as if he expected the elf to already be there. He called Kreacher like Lucius had once called Dobby and Harry could only stare.
After a way-too-brief explanation, Snape had them pair up to practice. Harry followed his trail around the room, watching as he stopped to speak with Parkinson, most likely to give her the advice he reserved for his House. Parkinson listened and nodded, then made to try again. In front of her, Draco prepared to shield himself. His posture was stiff.
Before Harry could make his presence known, the blond turned around, and their eyes met again, startling both of them.
Bletchley, the Slytherin Keeper, stopped the course of the Quaffle Angelina threw, immediately passing it to Warrington, who zoomed past Alicia and Katie towards the small figure of Ron. Harry clenched his teeth as the Chaser drew nearer.
It seemed like every student of Hogwarts was either openly sneering at him or giving him the cold shoulder. Harry was used to it from the Slytherins, but today a
It was as if a dam was broken. The room was possibly noisier as apparently, half the people in the room had a secret crush on a member of their rival house.
“Thank you,” said Harry, walking towards him to look at the chandelier too, as if it were what they were talking about. “What else did you do there, apart from looking around?"
Draco looked at him as if in disbelief. “I’m not going to sit there, watching as you tell that wretched woman what she needs to know to taint my father’s name,” his voice grew angrier as he spoke, “You can’t just ask me to watch as you-”
Draco trailed behind them, making sure no one strayed from the group. He grinned at Harry as they passed by them.
“I wasn’t going to,” protested Harry, despite having been a second away from proposing the very same thing. He drummed his fingers on the table, lasting exactly ten seconds before leaning in and asking Hermione, “What do you think he wants?"
They sat down on a stone bench, Harry casting a warming charm over the both of them when he noticed the pink flush on Malfoy’s pale face. He seemed very sensible to the cold. The blond gave him an easy smile and proceeded to tell Harry that he had been confusing the terms of the textbook, and that he had to rewrite his whole essay. One hour later, Harry smiled down at his finished work as Malfoy got ready to leave.
So Harry thinks about what he can do, his eyes fixed on Malfoy’s for any sign but only seeing his own doubts reflected in them. Malfoy’s new condition can’t be taken away, nor can their past, but the future is something else.
“I like it,” said Harry. Malfoy snapped his gaze back at him and Harry felt his cheeks heating. “I mean, I like it here,” he stammered, looking away towards a wall. “The owlery. It’s very, er, comfy,” he tried, immediately wanting to smack himself. The owlery was a stone-cold freezer, in no way comfortable.
“Flattery,” mused Draco. He took another half step, placed a hand on the railing and leaned up to brush his lips against Harry’s, softly, like the caress of a snitch’s wings in one’s hand. The blond then pulled back, enough to look at Harry in the eyes and whisper, “Goodnight, Scarhead."
Being careful to not crush anything, Harry closed the trunk with a heavy thud and turned to give his cousin an incredulous look. Dudley seemed nervous, which added to the other instances of strange behaviour his cousin had exhibited the past few days.
“What do you mean you have to go see him?” Harry turned around, finding Ginny giving him an incredulous look. “Harry, don’t tell me- After all he did?!” she asked harshly.  “Shouldn’t you be happy he got what he deserved?”
“It’s Hagrid's." Harry's voice came out muffled. "He and Buckbeak say hi. Apparently, he is planning to use him for lessons again.”
Draco met his gaze with a sneer. “Got anything to say, Scarhead?” he said, the barest intonation in the nickname almost making Harry lose the battle with the smile tugging at his lips.
Harry raised his eyebrows. “Maybe instead of me teaching you Defense, you could teach me how to dance."
Harry rolled his eyes humorously. “I’ll get lines anyway, it’s called ageing. You will get them as well."
There was a loud laugh coming from the stands, and Harry didn’t have to look to know it was Parkinson. He still did and saw Draco trying not to laugh, while Parkinson was doubled over from laughter and Zabini snickered discreetly behind a hand. “Good catch, Harry!” called Luna and Parkinson laughed even louder.
The day after the task, Harry woke up with a good mood for the first time in a long time. Despite not having wanted to be part of the Tournament, he couldn’t help feeling proud and excited after tying for first place with Viktor Krum, after flying against a dragon.
“Me?” said Hermione. When Lupin nodded, she sat up a bit straighter. “Well, Malfoy has been an awful person to us in the past-"
Harry looked at the circle again. "Is she really getting fired?" he asked, watching as Umbridge smiled sweetly at the pleading woman.
And Harry had tried to answer. Because he felt bad. Because he was curious. Because he was afraid. And because how couldn't he.
Draco didn’t look up when Harry sat next to him, frown still directed towards yet another book. After a moment he sighed, closing it and reaching for another, finally noticing Hermione sitting in front of him. “Granger,” he greeted tersely, sitting straighter.
The odd moment of civility was broken like that, as Harry was reminded of just who he was talking to. "I can still tell who's the wrong sort, Malfoy."
Harry tries to shift away, but the mouth curls up to bare its teeth and the wolf growls. "I can't sleep here," protests Harry harshly. Ron would probably freak out when he doesn't see him in the morning, Snape would probably come by early, the bed was old and dusty, and, "You will jinx me if I stay here!"
They looked at each other until someone cleared their throat and Draco took a step back, looking away.
Ron cut in, "We are running out of time." He looked at the four Slytherins. "Is this all of you?" he asked, glancing towards Harry curiously.
“Turn over your papers.” His voice had definitely been subjected to a Sonorous to reach the entire Hall, since the man was quite small. “You might begin now.” Just as he finished saying that, there was a massive shuffle of papers as everyone did so.
“I don’t think there’s any need to remind you not to leave the shop, right?” he said, smiling when Hermione nodded eagerly. Appeased, the man left, leaving the three of them to wander the place freely.
, Harry," he said, voice open in a way that cooled Harry down better than the freezing rain. "You can't ask me to stand still and watch something that will damage him, knowing I did
Draco always gave them a wide berth, silver eyes purposely never passing over them, as if repelled by their very existence. The Room hadn’t wheeled them closer again since their first meeting, and Harry wasn’t sure if it was due to Draco or himself.
They approached the group, finding Draco looking at Luna with a confused expression as the girl talked about something. “And these,” was Draco slowly saying, “
The sudden rattle of a door made them all pause. Crabbe was standing two compartments behind Blaise, already in his robes and carrying two trunks. “Oh, hullo,” he said carelessly, before leaning inside the compartment to take out another one.
Before Harry could even say hi, the blond had crossed the space and sat next to him, giving Harry only time enough to register that the grey eyes were actually silver before pulling him into a kiss. Harry forgot about the hour he had to wait and lost himself to the soft and warm sensation, wondering how he could have gone so long without it.
“Well, who doesn’t,” said Draco, then leaving his side. His steps echoed around the room as he wandered around it, studying the Christmas decorations that had appeared a few days ago. Something near the ceiling caught his eyes, and he turned towards Harry curiously. “Mistletoe."
Dumbledore’s hand on his shoulder left, and another grabbed Harry by the arm, its owner dragging him away from the chaos and limping towards his office.
"They?" asked a hushed voice, the only warning Harry got before there were hands circling his arm. "What did he say liked the dark?"
Harry walked towards the wall and all but plopped down to the floor, letting out a sigh. Hedwig glided down, perching on his knee and chirping at him.
The door to Umbridge’s office opened as quickly as it did the first time, and Harry ran in even quicker, his knees hitting the stone just as the green flames lit up and he yelled the name. His head was across it in a second and he was now looking at the dusty carpet floor of Grimmaul’s Place living room.
“Is it him?” asked Hermione from her seat on the bed once Harry plopped down next to her face-first with a letter in hand.
There was another hiccup. “What goes around, right?” Mundungus leaned over and tapped the photo with his stubby finger. Tapped Draco’s face with his
It made Harry’s anger waver, giving way to confusion and a deep pang of betrayal. "What?" He took a step back. Kreacher had disappeared during that time, but if he had gone to Draco's house, to his parents…
“No,” admitted Harry, who would have preferred him to ask for another kiss. “I’ll do it anyway, but why?"
The drawing room was captivating. Even with its tattered wallpaper and unevenly repaired iron chandeliers, it managed to catch Harry’s attention, breath and heart, seize them all in an unforgiving grip and not let go until he
Draco fixed his shirt, “And I expect you to return it safely,” he said sternly. “It’s quite valuable for me.”
“Really?” said Harry. Fay and he didn’t really talk outside of Quidditch practice, so he was a bit surprised.
“I’ll wake you up for lunch, and don’t worry, I won’t open any letter that arrives.” Sirius gave him a wink. “Especially not my cousin’s.”
“Thank you,” he said, entirely conscious of the dumb smile he had on his face as he looked at Draco again. “But where are my flowers?"
Sirius dropped his attempt at a smile. “You don’t need to be concerned about me, I can take care of myself."
“Surely my cursed cousin will be contacting you soon,” said Draco as he fixed his hair and robes. “And Salazar knows I don’t want to hear whatever he has to say. So I’m leaving.” He looked at Ron and Hermione. “Weasley, Granger-”
’ thought Harry, then wondering if he had said it aloud because Angelina suddenly turned towards him with a sharp look.
“He was there, Draco,” said Harry, feeling himself getting angrier in a sudden way, as if the anger had been there all along. Anger that most likely wasn't even his, and he cursed Voldemort once again.
January came and went quickly, along with bad news and loads of homework. After the Death Eater breakout from Azkaban that had shaken the magical community, the D.A members had become even more determined to learn. Which was good, but the breakout also gave place to an odd tension between the Slytherin members and the rest. Harry had been worried about a possible conflict, but the matter had been solved rather quickly by Zabini.
“It doesn’t matter what I called her,” cut in Hermione. She let out a sigh, “I don’t want to talk about it, alright? Let’s talk about something pleasant. Ron, if you may."
“What happened?” repeated Draco, sounding irritated but still accepting Harry’s hand and letting him guide him closer. “The Weasleys happened! One moment I’m about to tell you to get your ass in the Great Hall before Umbridge noticed you are not there, and the next those accursed twins are zooming in with their brooms and unleashing a bloody dragon after me!”
Ron laughed and hugged her back. “And did you see her catch? She left Cho in the dust! She was so angry she threw her broom!” He raised a finger at Harry. “You better watch out, your spot is not so sure anymore.”
Hermione had said to remain objective, so Harry stifled his irritation, driven by the mere sight of the bastard, and tried to do just that. Be objective.
"Nonsense," said Draco immediately, watching as the dummy wheeled back to the proper distance for duelling. "It's just a doll."
Parkinson snarled at him. “This is your fault! Your fault only!” she yelled, not caring about the attention they were drawing, about how Mcgonagall was making her way from the High Table. “If you hadn’t drawn him into your stupidity-!”
“I didn’t tell you about what I was doing that evening,” finished Harry, rubbing the back of his neck. Of course hiding stuff from each other would lead to this and could have led to worse if Draco hadn’t said anything now. Things would have been resolved so much quicker if they had been more open with each other.
His eyes flickered to a corner of the room, where the peacock had stopped once again, with its tail opened like a silver fan. The bird started to vanish under his watch, the white mist thinning into nothingness, but before it was fully gone, warm hands cupped Harry’s face and turned it towards a long kiss.
Platform nine and three quarters didn’t look any more cheerful than the rest of the Station, but was definitely more crowded. It was thanks to the Weasley’s number and distinct red hair that they managed to find them among the mass, but despite how easy it was to spot as well, Harry didn’t see any shock of white-blond hair nearby.
Today, he sat in the library, doing his Potions essay along with Ron and under Hermione’s supervision. He couldn’t help but miss the posh voice and unrelenting teasing that usually came with the process, and he found out that Potions had become his most hated class once again.
“Are you serious, Lavender?” exclaimed Parvati. “He is a jerk! He made Neville trip yesterday after class!”
"There's the birthday boy!" greeted Sirius when Harry walked into the kitchen. It was fairly early and they were still in their pyjamas, but his godfather was as energetic as usual as he kicked back a chair for him to sit on. It was only when he passed Harry a fresh cup of coffee that he did a double-take, and his smile turned into a frown. "Godric, did you even sleep?"
Instead, he pressed a kiss on his face, just by his ear, and was shoved back lightly by a red-faced Draco, who held a hand to his ear and tried to frown at Harry.
"Yeah!" cheered Harry, clapping loudly. He turned to his friends with a wide smile. "Brilliant. Isn't he brilliant?"
"No, Scarhead," said Draco, grinning at him. "It's a matter of picking your fights instead of jumping in every single one. And that’s what you have to do."
Harry nodded and stood up, trying to not convey how eager he was to leave the table. Ron and Hermione were already following after him, but he turned on the door to look at the table again, where Ginny kept seated. “You are not coming?” he asked.
“Hello, Harry,” she said. “Would you like to go find seats with us, or is obstructing the corridor something Gryffindors like to do?”
. This entire thing might just be the result of the connection you have. Like your scar, right? It’s probably due to the Dark Lord being more active now."
Harry crushed the bean. Immediately, the juice he needed poured out. He let it fall on the cauldron and grinned when it turned into the shade of lilac the book described. After that, he figured he might as well just do as the annotations said. He added the ingredients, stirred just like suggested-
“If you treat them like they are evil, then yes, they might start acting that way. People are influenced by expectations. Haven’t you heard of the Pygmalion effect?”
“That’s a disaster just waiting to happen,” said Kingsley. Then he seemed to remember Harry, “I mean- No, kid. It
Harry refrained from accepting at that very instant. “Listen, we could at least do the basics, but we have to do them. We can start with-" His words died when Draco leaned in, noses touching as he rested his forehead on Harry’s. There was nowhere to look but him.
“I’m not sure of what you are talking about, but thank you,” said Ron. Then he saw Hermione nod towards the Slytherin table and grinned. “Ah, yes. Completely insufferable.”
“I don’t have to explain myself to you, Granger,” said Draco coldly. The expression he had on his face was a familiar one and Harry wasn't surprised when his next words were,  “I’m taking my leave now, I’ll see you later, Harry." And with that, the blond spun on his heel and walked away.
Concentrating during lessons had become almost impossible due to all of this. Today he had finally felt better during Potions, actually managing to not burn his cauldron in the first hour. But because the world seemed to hate him, Colin Creevey had been sent to call him for
“Don’t fucking say that!” cuts him off Harry, hardening his grip on Malfoy’s wrist until the blond winces again, because he is not just insulting himself, but also Lupin.
might know things he doesn’t realize are important. Even things that are part of his daily routine could be useful for us,” huffed Moody. He turned to Harry, his glass eye fixed on him again. “Tell us then, Potter."
He was pulled into a hug as soon as he crossed the door by an anxious Hermione. Harry was surprised to see her and Ron there. His surprise grew to irritation when he discovered that not only had they been there for a while, they also knew about The Order.
Ginny’s eyes went comically wide, while her parents, Sirius and Lupin only stared at Harry, without saying anything.
“So I’ve been told." Fingers drummed on the table. “Is there a reason you want to make one yourself?"
thought Harry as his hand closed around the struggling ball. Catching his breath, he looked at Draco, not sure of what he would find. His boyfriend's pale face was flushed, his blond hair in disarray and his silver eyes fixed on Harry with annoyment. “No hard feelings, right?” said Harry, then grinning as he stretched his arm upwards, showing the snitch as the crowd cheered and the final whistle was blown.
Draco seemed to take Harry’s silence as acceptance. “I’ll see you later,” he said, taking three steps back before turning around. Harry let him walk away, watching quietly as he paused next to the poster of his aunt for a brief moment. He couldn’t see his expression, but he saw how Draco’s steps grew quicker on his way to the castle afterwards.
For the few weeks he had before the Task, Harry would spend his afternoons practising spells with Hermione and Ron, or, unexpectedly, running laps around the school with Krum. The older student had offered to help, through Hermione, but he had also told Harry that he wouldn't make things easier for him.
“I hate you,” said Ron, studying the board. “Alright, so he is here because you will miss him for some unknown reason. I get that. But why are
“I don’t know- I mean, no, nothing.” Harry shrugged him off and walked past him towards the living room. “Everything is fine, I was just hoping to get his reply to my last letter.”
Harry rounded him with his arms. “As much as you need,” he promised and he felt hot tears fall on his shirt. He tightened his hold on Draco as he started shaking and looked up at the ceiling and cursed Voldemort for all the pain he had brought.
Draco straightened up, passing a hand through his hair to fix it again. “Not as rude as pushing me down."
Harry smiled. “Just with the points, really, neither he nor the others are giving much detention, so what’s the damage?” No one was getting hurt, and there were bigger things to worry about than the House Cup.
“Alright!” came Slughorn’s voice. The man was standing in the doorway, looking breathless. ”I’m probably mad, but I’ll take it!”
Malfoy glared at him before giving him a nasty smile that made Harry feel a familiar pang of irritation and anticipate harsh words. “I suppose congratulations are in order, right?” mocked Malfoy. “I would have thought you would have enough with all the Gryffindors grovelling at your feet, but perhaps that wasn’t enough for you-”
Harry looked at his hands, so empty at the moment. “I love him,” he said as he flexed his fingers, and wasn’t even surprised by how natural the words sounded to him. After all, he had already said them aloud before, just not to anyone else. His eyes flickered up and met Hermione’s again, and then he did feel slightly embarrassed.
thing to do, but as he looked at Draco trembling due to the coldness of the rain and the raw emotion of his words, he learned that there are no
Harry watched as she walked away, catching up to Parkinson, who had stopped to wait for her with a curious expression. Luna seemed as tranquil as ever when Parkinson started talking, so Harry was more intrigued than worried about the odd combination.
After finding out that mandrake properties change drastically depending on if they were cut with silver or iron knives, Harry knew he had to ask Malfoy to sum it up. The textbook was too confusing, and he kept getting distracted by the conversations around him.
The door slammed closed behind him, as Harry stormed into the room, fuming. With a loud curse, he kicked the bed, which instead of making him feel better ended up just startling Hedwig and making him feel guilty. He apologized and sat down on the bed.
,” said Draco, sounding relieved. Then he bit his lower lip, that had wobbled a bit. Harry had seen him do that before and wasn’t surprised when it didn’t hold a second longer. The blond first lost the fight with the smile tugging at his lips and then broke into a laugh. “Because it was hilarious.”
She let out a sigh and went back to her chart. "I already told you you should leave it," she said sternly. "If he isn't telling you it must be for a reason." Harry scrunched his nose, and Hermione must have a sixth sense because she immediately looked up again and gave him a chiding look. "You have to respect that, Harry."
Viktor came to walk beside him, and his serious eyes shone when they noticed the pin on Harry’s shirt. He clasped a hand on his shoulder, giving him a strong squeeze. “Good,” he grunted. “Very good.”
“Of course,” said Mr Weasley in a gentle tone. He cleared his throat and smiled. “Well, if you have finished eating dinner, you are excused from the table,” he said to the teenagers. “I’m sure you will be wanting to catch up without us bugging in.”
"I didn't tell her," cut in Harry, not able to take the way Draco had been speaking, refined and distant and overall not fitting the trembling of his hand.
His godfather nodded. “Yeah, I get it, you don’t have to make excuses for him. I’m not sorry that Lucius Malfoy will rot in Azkaban, but I’m sure that my dear cousin is greatly saddened and all that, if he's anything like Narcissa.” The man raised a hand to scratch his ear in a dog-like way. “That’s one terrible family, but they are undeniably obsessed with each other, which is why I was so surprised to hear he did what he did.” Sirius smiled. “I was wrong about him, he really did end up choosing the right side.”
“Good,” huffed Angelina. She pointed her thumb at the door in clear dismissal. “Now, get out of my face."
Harry paused for a moment, not liking how worried the blond looked. “Yes,” he resolved. “Just, you know, a lot of homework and I’m quite behind because of detention."
Draco nodded against his shoulder and pulled back with a sob, switching one hand to hold Harry’s face while the other wiped away his own tears. “Shit, look at me. I'm acting like Myrtle,” he said with a small laugh. “You better not tell anyone, Scarhead.”
Harry and I debated what to do on this occasion for a long time, but I ended up liking this path and where it leads. Hopefully, you will like it as well haha.
Harry’s head snapped back towards the Floor, finding Sirius concerned eyes on him. His face was made of fire, but it was completely unharmed, no trail of blood nor the other signs of injury Harry had seen on his vision. A wave of relief coursed over him, so strong he was surprised it didn’t tumble him over. “Sirius, you are alright,” he breathed out.
But then Fay had approached them at the common room that same night. She gave them an uncertain smile when they looked up at her.
Zabini laughed loudly, startling the nearby Slytherins. Draco swatted him in the arm but kept his lower face hidden behind a pale hand, his shoulders trembling. Harry hurried to wipe the juice from his chin and looked away before he embarrassed himself any further.
“Then, Dumbledore would know if Snape was lying, right? Especially about this, Harry.” Sirius’ expression turned more serious. "We all know what Draco did. We all know what we owe him. If you, if any of us had gone blind into the Ministry, there’s a pretty high chance things would have gone to shit. And I mean it. Even knowing what to expect, the fight was not an easy one. Who knows what could have happened if we hadn’t known.”
“Fainting, tears, tantrums…” continued Fred. He then snapped his fingers and smiled. “Which is why you might be interested in our
Harry grimaced. That made him think about Ron. It was true that he had been getting better at playing Keeper, but there were still
“I got your letter,” said Sirius, once the three of them checked the room was empty and knelt before the fireplace. Harry ignored Hermione’s glare and told Sirius about his scar. The man hummed, “I doubt it’s anything to worry about. Didn’t it hurt last year as well? Must hurt more often now that he is up and running again."
Harry took it back. “I didn’t want to open it." He looked at Ron with a grimace. “What if he is mad at me?"
Harry had considered dropping his bowl of ingredients, or his entire cauldron if it meant to stand by him again. But it wouldn’t do any good, for neither of them. So he kept his ingredients safe and tried to keep up. He wondered if Snape knew or had a vague idea, because the man looked especially sour, not even pleased with Harry’s flawed essay.
“You shouldn’t have,” said Draco, scrunching his nose. “But I do understand why you might have thought so." He glanced at Harry and sighed, “I’m just trying to stay on her good side, that’s all."
Hello again! Thank you all for your comments! I'll make sure to answer all of them! Just wanted to let you know that from now on I'll update every Monday and Thursday.
“I will, once this thing is over.” Harry sighed, finding himself quite annoyed at Dumbledore. “I just hope it doesn’t take long.”
Ron and Hermione protested, but Harry refused to say anything else. Instead, he pointed out that lunch would be over soon. It worked with Ron, who immediately doubled over his easy.
each other.” Harry smiled at the memory. Those times seemed so far away now. “And that’s putting it mildly.”
“Not about you not being worth it, of course,” said Ron. “But Harry, you know how things are. First of all, he and his family are a bunch of blood purists, and you are a half-blood. So it wouldn’t go anywhere.”
The Requirement Room had not been decorated with pink flowers, red hearts or anything of the sort, but that didn't stop some of the D.A members from celebrating Valentine's.
Harry looked towards the alley again, but there was no sign of Draco, only impenetrable darkness that seemed to hide terrible things.
Sirius went on with his story, and Harry listened without really doing so. Part of the weight from the past days had been lifted from his shoulders, but now it sat heavy on his chest.
She had come out with a schedule, because of course she did, for practising spells and running laps around the school.
Before giving Malfoy a chance to say something that would make him kick him off the tower, Harry lifted a finger and sent him a dark glare. "I can't deal with you right now, Malfoy. Stay quiet or so help me God."
“Since when do you need my backup?” retorted Draco, rubbing his leg. “If I find a single bruise, you are dead to me."
“I see.” Hermione looked a bit embarrassed, but just for a brief moment, before her gaze flickered from Draco to Harry, lips pursed in a way that usually meant she was considering something. After another flicker, Harry caught the idea and almost gaped. She certainly wouldn’t- “Harry’s behind on his homework, you know, yet he insists on leaving it for later."
Snape seemed delighted to insult him and tell him that no, Legilimency wasn’t mind reading because the mind was complex and couldn't be opened like a book. But Harry didn’t really listen, because it sounded an awful lot like mind-reading and he definitely didn’t like that.
“Theo!” hissed Parkinson, but her voice trembled and she reached to grab on Goyle’s arm like she needed something to hold onto. “Just leave him alone.”
Ginny blinked, dropping her guarded expression for a second. “If you insist,” she said, leaving her glass on the table before standing up to follow the trio upstairs.
“Hi, uh, I’m supposed to deliver this to Neville Longbottom and Harry Po…” Her voice went quieter and her face redder as she stared at Harry. He had definitely seen her before, but when?
Harry gaped, his eyes going back towards the beetle. It was black and big and had unusual markings around the front that looked like glasses.
“Hello, Harry,” said Dumbledore with a nod, then turning towards Ron and Hermione. “And Mr Weasley and Miss Granger. It’s always a pleasure, but not much of a surprise, to see you three together in places you shouldn’t be at,” the man glanced around the office, then at the broken portrait on the floor and raising his eyebrows in amusement.
Harry wasn’t surprised when he found Malfoy already there, because he was always there, but he was surprised when the blond turned towards him and scowled darkly, killing Harry’s greeting before it could cross his lips.
Hermione grinned. “Let’s just say it will make Eloise Midgen’s acne look like a couple of cute freckles."
“Yeah?” Harry eyed them as Remus sat down on the chair in front of him, while Sirius kept leaning against a wall nearby. “So?”
The stag came forth again, giving a throttle around the room before stopping near them, as if aware of their presence now. It was big, tall and imposing even in its misty appearance as its non-defined eyes looked at them.
Harry hummed. He hadn’t seen the thestrals, and they were classified as dangerous, but the idea buggered him. He didn't quite believe it was them the ones that had done it.
The halls of Hogwarts were still mostly empty, as the first and second years mostly remained in their common rooms and the older students hadn’t returned from Hogsmeade yet. Harry’s steps echoed around him as he made way to the library, shaking off the remaining drops of water from his clothes. The Impervius Charm had made most of them bounce off, but some had grouped together in the creases, making small pools.
