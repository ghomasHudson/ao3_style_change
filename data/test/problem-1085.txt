‘Hm?’
The look Harry sent him was unimpressed.
‘Thanks for the breather,’ Harry chuckled against his lips.
Draco swallowed, then forced out a weak laugh.
The Tapestry corridor.
Draco smirked, trailing his hand down to Harry’s hip.
He finally picked up the pace into something ruthless and frantic, tight, like he found Harry liked best, bringing him right over the edge. And Harry - wonderful, beautiful Harry - did just as asked:
'I'm fucking
'Malfoy? Don't you want to use the loo?'
‘You fell on it. On purpose. I saw.’
‘Perhaps you should go back to hating me, then,’ Draco sniped back, and it didn’t even feel like he was trying to hurt Harry - he was hurting
'Well, that can't be helped; he's friends with everybody,' she scorned, picking a new lock to fiddle with.
‘Yes, I do.’
Harry snorted. ‘Not like you were giving me another option.’
‘The least offensive version of honest.’
, bleeding warmth into each other. He wanted to reach out and check Harry’s arm; he wanted to kiss his forehead and adjust his glasses; he wanted to be
‘He wanted to know why you didn’t tell him where you were. I’d rather like to know as well.’
‘I look forward to it,’ Draco murmured, trying to sound less emotional than he felt. He failed: the words came out all quiet and sweet and ever patient, the humble loyalty of the lovesick. Harry, the twat, smiled something crooked and amused, like he
He began to stroke Harry in earnest; full, firm movements with a little flick of his wrist, a gentle thumb teasing the slit just to make Harry hiss, to make his thighs convulse so prettily at each side of Draco's waist. Draco himself was beginning to feel a little desperate, spurred on by the sounds, the sensations, the bloody sinful sight of Harry in that position, all spread for him, welcoming him between the curve of his legs, squeezing around him… hadn't he said, just a moment ago, back at the pub, that he figured Draco would fuck him first? Did he think about it often? Did he know the answer as soon as Pansy had asked the question? Would he seem just as wanton, just as open when Draco was inching inside him? Would he keep his hands still by his sides, not touching his weeping cock, if Draco promised him a reward?
'There's no one at the castle, you know. You could just wait in the library,' Pansy pulled on a thread of his hair, 'He's not there. I checked.'
They were vague words, yes. Harry’s eyes, brimming with fondness - and how strange was it still that it was directed at
‘We’d just do some research beforehand. Slughorn wouldn’t know.’
‘Sure,’ Ron shrugged.
‘Seamus,’ was Neville’s answer.
Draco simply smirked.
'Not that we mind,' Finnigan's face broke into a lopsided smile, and he slipped down until he was half laying, his head propped on the back of the seat. 'Gotta cheer for the team, after all.'
‘If you liked it, then that’s a shot
'I didn't expect the loo to be so nice,' he commented. It made Draco a little dizzy, the way he was still speaking so normally, like he and Draco regularly engaged in idle chat. It made him dizzy, and it also made him utterly, completely speechless.
‘When did you leave?’
Once they’d dismounted, Blaise ushered them inside of Kettle Bottom. The place was cramped as usual. On one of the small tables sat Rowena, her hair in rich brown braids, dripping of classic romanticism. She was the sort of serene one practises in the mirror - Draco suspected Blaise fancied her all the more for it - and, when they ordered their drinks, she got a lean glass of Daisyroot and drank in measured sips.
'Does Potter know?'
to do - but he didn’t
‘Finnigan hasn’t done anything
‘No,' Harry murmured. Every shred of humour had been swept off his face. His eyes, without the glasses, were eerily intense, 'I thought… with what Snape did, I thought it would be small.'
The words  made something very warm and dangerously sweet bloom in Draco's chest. He couldn't help but find Harry's lips again, diving his tongue deep into his mouth this time, needy and possessive and fucking
Harry swept the hair out of his forehead. When he laughed, it was a frustrated, disbelieving thing. Draco didn’t like it at all. ‘Is that what this is, then? You’ve got your feelings hurt, Malfoy?’
‘You know I won’t.’
'I'm going,' he uttered, even though he was firmly rooted to the ground, and the crowd was so dense around him he couldn't move, and all he could do was search in a frenzy for that familiar - fucking
Hated the word pulsing in the forefront of his mind. Harry had called him ‘mate’.
But Harry didn’t humour him, which Draco really thought was quite cruel. What was Madam Puddifoot’s for, in all its pink frills and rose water, if not for unapologetic, saccharine confessions of love?
Draco frowned. ‘You do understand those are both reasons
, and Draco couldn’t bear it. ‘Up, up, Potter, come on,’ he urged, voice ragged, pulling Harry up by the hair. Harry dropped his cock with the most unbelievable reluctant noise, and Draco caught him for a desperate kiss.
‘Perhaps you should allow them to love you back,’ Draco said, because, yes, Potter did everything for his friends, and Potter’s friends would surely do anything for him, but he didn’t
And then he was walking to the Fat Lady, who looked quite affronted by the whole thing, and murmuring some word Draco couldn’t hear over the rushing of blood in his ears, and stepping through the narrow passage uncovered behind the canvas.
Draco very primly pretended that he hadn’t been staring at Harry’s back all class, and that his presence there at least
'Fuck off,' Ron said, a high crack in his voice, and he drank from the bottle again.
‘It’s the second time you’ve bought me these,’ Harry remarked. Color had risen back to his cheeks, and he sat up straighter, smiling, holding onto the sickly treat with his bruised arm.
‘Me, I assume?’
‘D’you need help with your books?’ he asked, fit into the narrow space between their desks, fingers thrumming on the edge of Draco’s.
‘You never pay attention anyway.’
‘You’re no bloody fun.’
a life composed of perfect first times. Maybe every other first time would belong to someone other than Draco: the morning would come, and Harry would be properly hungover and sensible, and tell him to forget the whole thing, and keep nothing more of this drunken memory except for a newfound confidence - because he'd had Draco Malfoy on his knees, swallowing around his dick - that he'd use to charm a string of girls who'd be more than willing to fill in for Draco in all the next first times. This one, however, belonged exclusively to Draco, and Draco was going to make it unforgettable. He was going to make it so all those flimsy girls could slobber over Harry's cock and Harry would only think of him, on his knees, taking him to the root in the bathroom of the Three Broomsticks.
‘Are you done with your drink, Fletchley? No? Good. No one’s done? Alright, mates, we’re playing, come on, I want to play.’
Like he expected, Ron and Hermione both settled on him pairs of awkward eyes, wavering between friendly and unsure. Little did it matter, though. Harry smiled, and Draco could focus on nothing else.
He shrugged. ‘I’m realistic. It just so happens that reality’s been good recently,’ he said - but he could hear the wistful lightness in his tone. There was nothing realistic in him left: he was all elegant rings and wedding chapels, distant wonderings of domesticity, casual kisses and serene promises of eternity.
so he could watch them come together - and then again and again, a careful rhythm which Harry seemed to take in stride. Seemed to
Harry laughed, idly nuzzling his cock. At this point, Draco was considering just stroking himself over the edge - just twice, all it would take - and coming all over Harry’s soft, pretty face.
And he’d asked it in a taunting tone, but the very thought of it made him falter. Harry on his knees for him: he didn’t really know if he could cope.
Draco smiled, unperturbed, as if he hadn’t been on the verge of a coughing fit a millisecond ago.
'I've never seen you like this,' Harry remarked. He didn't seem particularly shy about the situation: his legs were still slightly parted, showing a flash of a dusting of fur around a pink hole, just enough to drive Draco crazy with the possibility that he might get to be inside it that night.
‘Alright, mates, I have a good one,’ Dean Thomas said, and Harry leaned over the table to hear him better. Draco missed the warmth of his arm, and stared in ill-disguised fondness as he toyed with his glass. ‘Never have I ever hid a kink from a partner.’
, made him, in turn, feel weak.
‘You’re covered in snow.’
'You're scared I'll be fucking
‘I won’t be a selfless tutor,’ Draco indulged himself by kissing those lewd lips softly, almost reverently, swiping his thumbs over sore hips. ‘I’ll expect you to suck up to me.’
'Turned out a gentleman, did you?'
returned to the group, and Draco turned to Harry with an incredulous ‘Did you know about this?’, while Blaise, from behind him and in a much lower tone, pointedly intended to Rowena, said, ‘Figures it’d be the Ravenclaw.’
- he wrapped his fingers around Harry's cock and stroked it fully, firm and slow, feeling the flesh twitch in his hand.
something. He’d been growing an inkling of hope all night, fragile and tentative, after years of heartbreak - and there was no excuse, and he should have known better, because he was the unlikeable Draco Malfoy and Harry was the marvelous Harry Potter, and maybe he’d been extended an invitation, because Harry was simply too friendly and kind and
all the time. I was a fucking kid, it’s not because I was in love that I knew what to do with it. If my father told me I should hate Harry, why wouldn’t I believe him?’
Pansy gave him a discomfited smile, raising her shot high. 'Cheers,' she said, and downed it. It convulsed in her neck, twitched in her lips, and Draco followed suit, letting the liquid burn acid in his mouth. When he put down the empty glass, there was a throbbing between his eyebrows, and Pansy was definitely too close, everything else blurry.
‘If you’d studied in the slightest, we wouldn’t have to do this at all.’
And he said it so calmly, like the easiest of solutions, and the
Harry could convince himself otherwise, but at that moment his voice was nothing if not a whine.
‘Morning, mate, how are you holding up?’ said Neville. His eyes were squinting compulsively, even in the tame winter sunlight. The trio sprawled in the seats next to Draco, all with their sighs of discomfort
A hand pressed slightly at Draco’s chest as Harry pushed himself up to regard him better. He looked serious now - had probably picked up on the pitifully frightened note in Draco’s tone.
Harry's eyes were moving wildly across Draco's face, excited, restless, pupils blown - and what the fuck did that mean? How the hell was it conceivable in any fucking universe that Harry was like this, beautiful and flushed and
He buttoned up his shirt. The situation figured to him as this: everyone else, according to what Harry had told him, thought he’d felt ill and left. A nice, tight lie courtesy of Hermione Granger, who, he now remembered with a sudden weight in his throat, was aware of Draco’s feelings for Harry. He was still, therefore, in the same despairing hole from before; only now, if - when - Hermione told Harry, Harry would be able to look back at Draco on his
Come yell at me on discord, at autumn#2451
‘If you hadn’t hidden it, we wouldn’t be as curious,’ Blaise said, all faux reason, a small smirk betraying his amusement.
Do that again. Do that
- he hadn’t understood, he’d never understand, because Draco had wished his love away for so long that he’d made it invisible.
And the words froze on his tongue, but his hips were already snapping forward and Harry crumbled on his forearms with a drawn out sound, something
‘I did want to kiss you before,’ Harry went on. His eyes had taken on a reminiscent twinkle. ‘Remember that night with the veritaserum? You left in such a hurry, and I found myself thinking - I should have pushed him against the shelves and kissed him.’
Neville nodded. His eyes really were frightening, charmed red like that. ‘In my calf, almost from knee to ankle. It’s nasty.’
‘He’s too much of a flower to play hungover.’
‘Is it meant to look quite so pink?’
Second class was Potions, and they spent half an hour tittering in the cold classroom while Professor Slughorn gave them a lengthy speech - one, in fact, that he made a point of reciting to every year that day.
He left with a twirl of his wet robes, umbrella unfolding over his head. As Draco watched him go further and further into the rain, he seemed to blur in the softest watercolours, until he was nothing but a blot of grey and black.
‘You’re the potions geek, Malfoy. What could Slughorn open on the first floor?’
Because his words, everything about them… he hated Draco. Oh, Draco heard them and he hated
‘I don’t need
‘And when did you realize the other thing?’
we do it?'
Not that it had worked. Because he closed his eyes and he saw neon flashes. He turned corners in the cold corridors, glimpsed at a red and golden tie, and could only think of the pale skin of Harry’s neck under his grey coat. He ate and he felt the sickly sweet taste of treacle tarts on his tongue.
Draco huffed, a smirk creeping on his face. ‘You fell, Potter?’
‘Not that it’s the end of the world.’
Harry huffed. To their right, the teams were finally beginning to settle. Harper had stormed out, taking a seat in the stands. Draco was fully expecting a row with her - he quite deserved it.
Draco, meanwhile, was staring at the keys with one calm eyebrow raised on his forehead. He was beginning to realize why they were in the Tapestry Corridor.
‘It’s not!’
‘The rum,’ Harry said, though his attention was still mostly on the wardrobe. ‘Share.’
‘You’ve always known that, Potter.’
do that, right?’
‘Oh. Yes, well, I can’t bloody remember now, can I?’ Draco sighed, loosely encircling one of Harry’s wrists with his hand to pull him a bit closer. ‘You have distracting lips.’
‘I believe I’ll pass.’
In the end, he chose to gather the necessary ingredients, placing them, after some consideration, on Harry’s desk. He ran a finger through the wood - the same wood he’d held onto as Harry swallowed around him - and smiled.
alright?’
‘If you keep paying for everything, you’ll end up begging for change outside of Gringotts,’ he managed, taking some money out of his own pocket with one slow, stunted hand.
,’ Finnigan sniggered. He was being wonderfully effective at killing Draco’s erection, all harsh consonants and high pitchings of his voice, none of Harry’s soft, tilting snark - and he could see, through the sliver between the door and the stall, Harry’s back as he moved towards the sink and began washing his hands; his shirt was creased, and Draco had done that, because he’d blown him, he’d blown Harry fucking Potter and he would have bloody
more. Something in humble words, yes, but that resembled eternity.
‘That’s what you’re for,’ Pansy remarked, an eyebrow cocked pointely. ‘Make them easier.’
you.'
‘Well, how d’you know?’
‘Would you hand me Luna’s bag?’
‘He hurt his arm. You’ll kill him next.’
Then, his body came, and with it torment.
Around them the game went on with shrill laughter and the clinking of glasses. The lights were flashing in a hideous mix of white and blue, colouring everyone’s face, and the music was now something with lyrics, a repetitive string of verses in a husky tone, the type of thing that tingles in drunken minds, and it didn’t seem, the entire environment inside the Three Broomsticks, much conducive to serious, tedious conversations. Draco had never been one to apologize. Not in formal, fanciful words, at least - he would have preferred to make amends with Granger through some form of organic gesture, and the prospect of saying sorry now, in the least appropriate scenario, surrounded by people, was considerably unappealing.
It was evident, after all, that Harry wasn’t receptive to more.
With a snort, Harry walked away to sit gingerly on the bed. A cloud of dust lifted as the frayed mattress dipped down, swaying like fog in the chilly air.
‘Why do you think he wanted Ginny?’ Hermione asked.
He found him at last alone in one of the corridors, inspecting a box of treacle tarts with a furrowed brow.
Draco nodded absently. Thomas was eager to leave him and disappear in the circle of Gryffindors. They were all so huddled together, backs curved and arms over each other, that he couldn’t even see Harry on the grass.
‘Rowena,’ Blaise said with something triumphant in his tone. Pike was still fussing over the upturned brims of his sleeves.
Hermione was an instant from firing back; then, something caught up with her, and her lips pressed together at comical speed. She regarded him now not like he was some pesky child trying to pick a fight, but as if he was an object of study.
his tie after a long day, to kiss him gentle and share his stress, his pain, his happiness. He deserved to let himself be loved.
Idly, he wondered if Leanne was somewhere in the stands to support Potter. He'd nearly forgotten about her.
‘Something happened. With him.’
. That Harry had stepped down willingly was one thing, but for him to have reached up… no, he figured he’d have died of frustration first.
This time Harry laughed fully. He looked
into his mind - mess of black hair, and he was awful sure he would suffocate in but a moment.
. Not that he didn't love the sight of glorious Potter writhing between graffitied walls; he just wanted it to mean more. He wanted to be able to do it, and to tuck Harry back into his jeans afterwards, to kiss him warmly, to get back to Harry's friends' table and sit there with his arm around him, Harry's official, stupidly smitten and bloody
He really wasn’t in the disposition for inquiries. His head was cracking, dry like a prune, yet overflowing, overstuffed, bursting with crumpled tissues and old liquor - a very cramped desert, it seemed, loud though there was no sound, and aching for darkness. He wanted to go back to sleep. He wanted Saturday banished by unconsciousness; Sunday, maybe, as well. He could stand on Monday, he was fairly sure. By Tuesday he was positive he’d be able to think.
‘You’re flying a little crooked there, Potter.’
‘What?’
‘Standard potioning water; add some wormwood until it’s mint green.’
'Your legs will freeze.'
‘What?’
‘Precisely,’ Draco purred. ‘Have you any idea-’ he dipped lower, sucking at the lovely skin below his jaw, drunk on the thought that he got to explore, that he got to
‘Most of them, yes.’
‘Who were you with then, that Pike felt he had to cover for you?’
‘Yes, I know, you’ve said that twice already. No one’s debating that she’s perfectly nice. Do you think she suits him, though?’
Harry’s laugh was breathless. ‘I guess so. You answer, I’m a bit-’ he brought a hand to his cock, stroking it once. ‘-Yeah, busy.’
‘It’s a bloody childish party, Potter.’
‘Yeah,’ Harry prolonged the word. Draco wondered if Seamus would be able to hear the hint of nervousness in it. ‘You know how I get when I drink too much.’
for Draco.
Draco snorted. If he focused past the heady fuzz of arousal, he could hear intermittent spurts of laughter from outside, sometimes a louder voice from downstairs.
'Sure, Weasley. You're welcome.'
new was this kind of proximity to Harry, friendly and lighthearted, without any urgency or alcohol or lily-white confidence from the moon.
Because the War could have resulted in many things, but it sure hadn't brought down prejudice with it. It sure hadn't brought down the past. And those who had fought on the wrong side were not quite forgiven, and just shy of forgotten. Hanging in the edges of the school, reserved and quick-footed, all the outcasts like Draco spent their days pretending they weren't there.
He gingerly took Harry's cock out. It glistened red and swollen between his fingers, twitching a little. Harry did a broken little noise, nails ruthless on the back of Draco's neck. Not that Draco minded - rather, he hoped that, if he twisted enough in front of a mirror the next day, he'd be able to see the imprints.
‘Do what?’
Harry, who had seemed to be weighing his choices, ended up tilting his chin up in that daring way that was so characteristic of him - that Draco had seen countlessly, with soft eyes, from across the room, for years.
to see.
-, the limber fit that had endured so much and was yet so fragile, lean and small, perfect to be held; and then that fire, paradoxical with his appearance, fueling his spirit into a restless frenzy; that drive to fight for what was right, that little smirk from jokes in his own head, that kindness he’d never learnt how to shield; strength and vulnerability more virtuous than in any other soul; and that laugh, when he laughed free and private; and the little moans that spilled from his lips, when someone kissed him right… Draco reckoned he’d fit anyone’s taste.
Harry nodded. ‘Hermione’s going there. You did say you’d apologize.’
‘Are you going to tell me not to dance with Seamus?’
do this.
Harry impatiently picked a bean - wet dirt, it turned out - and drank his shot without batting an eye. The game progressed. Harry jabbed him in the thigh.
‘He advised me to do it sooner rather than later. I planned to do it regardless.’
impulsivity, that saw it as a fucking point of honour; like they weren’t there dangling from their broomsticks and laughing over it, like they didn’t see their life as currency for fun, like they hadn’t gone through their entire childhood thinking themselves invincible, all because when he was a bloody baby he'd… Reckless, they were - all of them, and they shouldn’t be trusted on matters of
‘That horrid green thing?’
Draco snorted and moved closer, holding himself over Harry with one hand while trailing a teasing trail down to Harry's navel with the other. The slide of their skin together, warm and absolute, was much better than all those times they'd frotted urgently against fabric. Feeling indulgent - feeling the most hopeless urge to
And Draco
Harry bit his lip. He was fiddling with the zipper of the bag, all of him a mess of unbridled energy - and Draco was coming to find that Harry took on a dangerous level of restless when he drank, when the shred of sense within him was gone and he was nothing but that ridiculous, nonsensically charming urge to
‘Oh, come on.’
‘Will you stop making a scene, Malfoy?’ Ginny sniped. ‘Harper’s already prepped.’
Harry’s smile bloomed slow and mesmerizingly wide.
Enjoy~
Harry chuckled. ‘Because,’ his eyes took on a mischievous twinkle. ‘No one likes to go about in the dungeons. Plus, after Ron threw that helmet in it, anyone who’s caught there again will be screwed.’
Pansy's smirk was positively devilish.
‘Just hoping you’ll save me the trouble of looking for the Snitch, Potter.’
‘Good,’ Harry smiled. ‘We should meet, then. In the Potions classroom.’
‘Would you quit squirming? It’s not like you’re unacquainted with my saliva.’
'No,' and still, feigning casual, like he did this often, like it was fucking
‘What are we having then?’ Harry asked them, planting his elbows excitedly on the bartop.
‘D’you know it in the first place?’
He’d finally managed to put such thoughts away and concentrate on transplanting his infant Bouncing Bulb into a fresh pot when Ron walked up to him.
The sudden suction made him muffle a sound deep in his throat, a low and primitive thing akin to a growl; and the way his fingers worked in tandem with his mouth in a frenzy of stimulation, the sight of him red-faced and eager to please, the entire ecstasy of the situation pushed him right up to brink of his climax - pushed Harry too, because he was getting loud, or trying to, tears perfectly round in the corners of his eyes and neck tendons straining as he moaned long and desperate around Draco’s cock.
‘No, I’m not hard. I kind of...’ he waved a hand around. ‘...took care of it myself.’
in his chest, that he might have
‘They don’t taste any different at all?’
‘No, I mean she’s too focused on
Seeing as he couldn’t quite convey his feelings through the kiss, Draco thought to balance it out by moving to cover Harry’s body with his own, pinning him against the godawful moth-eaten mattress. Harry did a little noise - a bloody
lips to notice yours,’ Draco retorted. He stepped closer to him, putting his own hand on the bag. ‘Let me put it on you. Please.’
After around five minutes, the door opened with a low creak. Harry peered out.
'Why then?' Harry's brows raised, disappearing under tousled black hair, 'Was it my looks?'
‘You should have led with that, darling. Being hungover isn’t a pass for rudeness.’
'He's talked to you before. He asked you for help in
'Good?'
to do this. Sober and sharp he could do it, could face Harry, could pretend not to know how his lips - how his cock - tasted; hungover, on the other hand, mouth dry and eyes teary, hair unstyled, head pounding, too raw to conjure spite or indifference, awfully human, in short, and too honest in his discomfort, he’d crumble under Harry’s gaze
'None,' Harry smiled. 'Well, one: you're too fucking far.'
The light flickered again. For one moment, they were plunged in darkness, and the situation felt to Draco then, somehow, much less innocent than before. He couldn’t help picture the most stereotypical activities that were bound to occur between two students in a cramped closet at night; picture himself crowding Harry against the shelves, kissing him, running his fingers through the bare skin of his arms and the dark strands of his hair. Making him moan, because he’d been imaging that sound ever since Pansy, in third year, in a chilly night by the common room’s fireplace, had filled him in on all the graphic details of sex.
He was off before Harry could even say a word.
He was quite obviously drunk, and at once Draco was reminded of that surreal night at Hogsmeade, and something in him ran very cold.
Draco narrowed his eyes. He wondered - he
Potter would know. Right now, in ten, twenty seconds, he'd know. He'd surely look at Draco, and Draco daredn't look at him, which meant he'd be with his back turned as he was subjected to the brief scrutiny, and Potter would see only the grey of his peacoat and the slick silver in his hair - and with no chance to show him any warmth, any mildness through a stare or a tweak of lips, what could Potter ever think besides Malfoy, dark, death?
Harry sent him a wry look. Something in Draco’s demeanour must have concerned him, because he asked:
‘Yes,’ Goyle repeated, waving one hand around. ‘Yes, well- sorry about… everything. Yes.’
Draco had absolutely no idea how that was possible. Even in the midst of the world’s end, he’d had plenty of time to think about Harry.
And as always:
‘You’d look good in it.’
‘Don’t you?’ Harry droned, staring at him pointedly. And Draco really didn’t, wasn’t at all bothered with the possibility of someone catching him as he disgraced the Boy Who Lived, thought it actually had the potential to be quite satisfying - cathartic, in a way, after years of discretion - if only Harry didn’t throw a fit about it. But it seemed quite clear that Harry wouldn’t like that answer. He most likely wanted to keep it a secret: screaming his name in a vacant bathroom with music deafening the crowd beyond the walls was one thing; having one of his close friends
smile on his lips, and Draco wasted no time in looping an arm around his waist and kissing his cheek warmly. He primly ignored Blaise’s smirk.
‘If only we were all as heartless as the Malfoys.’
, anyway,’ Draco scoffed. ‘Just a lot of bullshit ones.’
to talk to us?’ she retorted, a cold sharpness in her stance, ‘This is none of your business, Malfoy. We’ve done this before, and we were fine.’
‘Not having fun?’
Harry was at his side, and Draco could do little else than glimpse out those windows and picture his past self in the street, desperately in love and bitterly jealous, and feel that the universe, despite its infuriating workings, had truly been impossibly kind.
‘I wasn’t asking you, dear, you’d never say anything else.’
‘What, was I supposed to
‘When did
‘No,’ Draco huffed, still reeling,
‘Wanted to find your bloody common room, see if it’d changed since…’
Draco laughed, though it died out bitter in his tongue. Someone pushed him roughly to the side in an attempt to get closer to the bar, and Draco pressed against Pansy as he spoke:
‘You do look a little green, Draco,’ Neville interjected, eyes so wide, so bloody eager to help that it chipped at Draco’s resolve.
‘Actually, I was-’ he sighed, ‘What do you need?’
Selfish, they were.
'You've had your tongue in there.'
So yes, Draco loved him, but that didn't necessarily mean he wanted to
‘No. He will be, though. Can I go n-’ the telltale sound of stone scraping on stone behind Draco signaled that the stairs were changing paths once more. Ron’s sigh was too tired to be properly angry. ‘You absolute fucking prick.’
‘By all means, then: discuss,’ Pansy smirked.
‘Well, good luck with that,’ Harry snorted; then, with something amused twinkling in his eyes, ‘Oh, and watch out for Ginny. She really is cross.’
Pike nodded absently. He was fiddling with the sleeves of his cloak, which was a care he seldom took.
call me ‘mate’ again, I am much,
‘What are you laughing about?’
The group, like one sentient beast, began walking in synchronicity. Draco could spot Lovegood a few steps ahead, talking to some girl; Thomas and Finnigan, even further up, far from the crowd and whispering lamely in each other's ears between fits of laughter; in the center, a cluster of swaying heads, where Hermione and Ron were headed, that was most likely harbouring Potter. All these people, this well-oiled machine that walked with the surety of a millipede, inside which each cog and gear was invaluable in its dynamic with the others, where every component worked in a well-practised harmony - a few feet behind, Draco and Pansy, sharp-faced and dark-clothed, foreign, clashing, slowing the rhythm and staining the joy.
The man, unimpressed, narrowed his eyes. ‘Do you not know the rules of the party, boy? Don’t tell me. Show me.’
The warmth was short-lived, then. Draco didn't much care, in all honesty; he was much more preoccupied with easing the tension growing in Harry's impatient body - or maybe winding it tighter and tighter until it broke. So he let Blaise's smirk be, let it hang all pleased on his face, and stepped away without another word. Let him feel like he'd won - Draco was very clearly leaving with the prize.
Draco stayed quite far from the infirmary, but Pansy passed by and told him it was littered with nosy twits. Visits had been cancelled, yet they loitered by the door all the same.
‘Do you want me to say please, is that it? D’you want me to beg for you to fuck me?’
Malfoy, I think I know where it is,’ Harry urged. Draco flattened against one of the walls with his eyebrows raised, and watched as Harry fiddled with the wooden ladder before climbing up to peer at the higher shelves. He was short; he had to climb quite high, his feet sliding restless on the rung, and Draco had half a mind to steady him with a hand on his calf, but he couldn’t bring himself to close the distance.
‘Slughorn’s keys?’
'Oh,' Draco snapped back to life, gaze quickly darting away from Potter's confused expression, 'Yes.'
‘Have you and Finnigan never learnt to walk?’ said Draco, steadying himself against the wall. The thought came to him when he caught the lingering scent of Gillyweed in Thomas’s robes. ‘How did Slughorn’s test go?’
That surely explained why Weasley had been so relatively tame towards him. Sometimes, Draco suspected the ginger hated him more than Harry did.
Draco was overwhelmed with the urge to follow them. He felt like a child - why shouldn’t he, when they were playing a game, and Harry had broken the rules? Did it mean he had that particular kink? No? A worse one, or one even more common? When he’d been with Ginny, what had he thought of them doing? What did he like? What brought him to the edge?
‘Of course not. Why’d you lash out at Hermione, then?’
“If this all goes to hell and we both die, I will come back as a ghost to haunt you, Headmistress McGonagall,“ Draco said.
“Because I think someone should know what happened to you.”
“Yeah? How so?”
“Because people don’t know I fancy boys as well?”
“And I love it, obviously I love it. I love your mouth on me Draco.”
Well, Harry thought not very charitable, it had been Lerch and Malcier, who had let Goyle die. Harry’s charge was still alive and well.
“The wards on that house are very strong, the ones on the studio even stronger,” Harry said.
“I’m a vampire, seduction is in our make-up,” Draco answered.
Draco stretched. “Yes, that would be fun. I haven’t been on a broom in some time.”
“I don’t know,” Draco replied. “Maybe a life and death situation?”
“Rescued you,” Harry said.
“Out of that list with thirty names on them? Ten, two are bubbling messes in nursing homes,” Astra replied. “We’re looking for the whereabouts of the other eight. But they seemed to have left the country.”
“It’s nothing Potter, I don’t need a hero.”
“I don’t know what you did to Harry, but it stops now, Malfoy,” Weasley said. Granger was looking unhappy as well. Her wand ready in her hand.
“That came out wrong,” he ran a hand through his hair.
“What will you do then?” Antoine repeated.
Potter smiled wryly. “I didn’t know what it was about you, not back then. We didn’t know much about non-hetero relationships back then, did we?”
“Zabini never took the mark,” Harry said, because he had seen it. Blaise had shown him his unmarked skin. “Draco was forced to do it.”
“I don’t know,” Draco answered. He reached out and touched painting-Harry's scar, then snapped his hand back as if burned. He cocked his head, then walked over to an empty canvas. He looked normal, but his movements were slow and graceful—like ballet.
Harry didn't like it, but he knew that Antoine was right. They had been lucky with ruling out the other facilities, but Harry couldn’t even remember how big that place was, how many guards, how much staff. They knew nothing.
“Because I had to,” Draco answered.
“Then you will be risking your life, my life and possibly the lives of others, including Goyle and his family and a few Aurors,” Potter answered.
Harry nodded. He didn’t want anyone local if he could help it. The rumours would fly. He was Harry Potter, and no one had set foot in Malfoy Manor for years, and there was also that well-kept secret of Draco Malfoy being a Seer.
He leaned over so he was nearly touching Harry and whispered, “If she starts with ‘I feel a dark presence’ I might have to throw her out.”
“Lying to me?”
Curse him, Draco thought, but he was getting used to it. Worse yet, he liked it.
“Give my thanks to Julien,” Harry said.
“A real poet, aren’t you?”
Harry had cast the strongest Muffliato charm he could manage, because he didn’t want Draco to hear any of this if Draco should have felt so inclined to listen in on their conversation. He was self-aware enough to know that he was way over the line in regards to professionalism when it came to Draco, but as long as no one knew about – how they spent their nights he hoped he could somehow get through this assignment and then it wouldn’t matter. Once they caught whoever had it out for Draco and the other former Deatheaters and war criminals Harry could ask Draco out.
Harry smiled and handed the papers over. While Draco was reading, Harry was drinking his tea, eating a piece of cake and watching Draco.
“Once I've unpacked, we should talk,” Potter said as he followed Draco up the stairs to the guest room.
“Wait a second,” Bears said. “If I read this correctly, and I think I did, then the ritual is only complete when there is one survivor. It was only ever intended to have one survivor.”
“No pity, Harry. I knew what I was doing,” Draco cut in.
“Fair enough: I didn’t know much about it. I probably didn’t want to know much about it, because it made me even more alien.”
“I like to exchange first names at least before getting up close and personnel,” he said.
“The name I think. It’s a flower,“ Harry said.
“What?”
Blaise nodded. “Yes, it was. But he always bent the rules and did reckless things. This time he did it for himself. There is, I always thought so, a bit of Slytherin inside him.”
“It’s the best solution, you could try to dig up some dirt on your dirtbag of a former publisher, but that will take time and the sooner you deal with this the better Draco. But of course, that is only my humble opinion,” Pansy said and handed him another petit Fours. Draco took that one too.
“I've done it before,” Potter replied.
“No...in general.”
“You weren’t worthy, Joel, but I was, so it brought me back and it gave me power. Whatever I imagine will happen,” he said softly. The cube he had Joel contained in was getting smaller and smaller.
“But no one else,” Draco said, firmly.
He wanted to say something or ask more questions, because for some reason he intrigued by Blaise Zabini and his sexuality, but his stomach chose that moment to make an embarrassing noise. She laughed. “You should really order some food Harry.“
“Is that why you described every single hot detail of Ivar fucking Basil?” Pansy asked.
“Harry Potter, hero of the Wizarding world,” Blaise said, he was smiling, but there was something sharp in his mile, something calculating in his eyes. Maybe it was a Slytherin trait.
Draco’s praise was music to his ears and Draco wasn’t stingy with it. “Enough,” he said after a few minutes and pulled on Harry’s hair. Harry pulled off with an obscene sounding pop.
Sincerely,
That was an unpleasant realization.
“Just this room left, let’s go,” Draco replied and found himself a few moments later at 12 Grimmauld Place. He fell to his knees: sweat was running down his spine and his heart was beating too hard in his chest.
She gave Draco a look, like he should have known that. Draco ignored it. It wasn’t uncommon to swallow a Polyjuice poison or don a mask once one was inside. Draco had worn a mask his first few times there as well. He didn’t bother with it anymore. And he might just quit his membership anyway now that he and Potter were in love and in a relationship. Potter was intrigued by a lot of things, but Draco instinctively knew that he wasn’t the sharing type. Draco might have shared in the past, but there was no way in hell anyone was getting their hands on Potter’s perfect naked body except him.
Draco rolled to the side and got rid of the condom. Harry grabbed a handful of Draco’s shirt. “That was good, we should do it again and again and again. Soon.”
“While you were looking for us, we were watching you, Mister Potter,” Antoine replied.
“That doesn’t mean anyone can just waltz in as they please,” Draco replied.
Draco gladly complied.
“We have a plan, everything will be fine, and I don’t care what people think about me dating Draco Malfoy, infamous erotica writer. They can think what they want, if someone should say something to my face, well… we will see how that will go.”
Draco shook his head. “Not yet, but will be soon. This is very powerful magic, Harry.”
“I’m too tired to fuck, Harry,” Draco said.
“Did it turn you on?” Draco asked, as his fingers slipped down Harry’s neck.
Harry had no doubt whatsoever that Draco cared for him, that he might even be falling for Harry as well, so he waited Draco out.
Harry had never wondered about that.
“We usually don't feed from wizards, it's the magic in their blood, it does funny things to our systems.”
Draco raised an eyebrow at him in question.
It was a real possibility.
Harry laughed. “Good fucking luck with that. Besides I don’t think you can get a more secure place than this one. The wards are so attuned to him it’s scary. They are like veins, running in the walls, the floors, the gardens and the street outside.”
“I think you need to get naked now too, Draco,” Harry said.
“You didn’t deserve this,” Harry whispered.
“You’re not good enough for him Malfoy. You were never good enough for him,” Weasley spat, cradling his hand. Granger was keeping silent.
“Should have known, you would be the one to save me. It’s what you do,” Draco said, ignoring Harry’s question.
“You told me a lot of things. What do you remember?”
It wasn’t like he could just walk up to Draco Malfoy and ask him for a date. He didn’t even know if Draco was even a little bit interested in him or men in general. The last few times Harry had shown up at the gates of the Manor Draco hadn’t let him in, had barely talked to him at all.
“Don't you know it already?” The boy asked. “Want to get out of here?”
“More Muggle-born than witch, I assume?” Draco asked.
“He made another one,” Luna yelled back. She too used a spell for that, but her own milder version of it. Pansy would probably hear it as if Luna was standing next to her in the kitchen and whispering into her ear. Why had he ever agreed to live with them?
“So, who is still alive?” Harry wanted to know.
“Bed now?” Harry asked.
“I don’t sign them with my real name,” Draco said.
“Maybe, if you, your kind, want me to. If Draco wants me to,” Harry answered. “I know people who will print it.” Harry knew that Luna would believe him.
Harry grinned at him. They knew each other just too well. “Yeah, I think I will keep doing it.”
Neville gave him a look. “Who says he has no friends, Harry?”
“No need, I know what I need to know,” Harry replied, looking up and into Draco’s grey stormy eyes.
“Are you afraid?” Draco asked, leaning closer. The table was a flimsy barrier if you could do the things Draco could with just a thought.
“I’ve never seen anyone use magic like you do it, not even Dumbledore,” Potter said. “It’s like you don’t even have to think about it.”
“It’s a good thing he was such a saint, or otherwise we wouldn’t be here now. You wouldn’t be able to express yourself by writing scandalous pornographic novels.”
“Yes,” Draco replied. Like the freedom to fuck someone for example, he thought, but didn’t voice.
“Yes,” Harry said, because now that he had Draco back there was no way in hell he was going to let him slip away.
Harry laughed. “I bet that’s the first time you said that to someone.”
“I am not a specialist on these things, but I do have my strengths, and I am pretty sure the problem is that the ritual is not finished and that Mr. Malfoy’s body is in a state of flux.”
“How did you get those files?” Harry wondered.
“Why did you do it then?” Had it been curiosity?
“Shut up for a second, Harry,” Draco cut in. He needed to calm down.
Draco kissed his shoulder. “It is. Sleep now, Harry. You earned it and you will need your strength.”
“Right, I must have confused you with some other Harry James Potter,” Neville teased.
“Out!” she repeated. She sounded like a snake, an angry one that was ready to strike. He nodded and left the attic.
“I just wanted—"
Harry shrugged like it was all fine. “Nothing we can do about it. She will come around, like everyone else had come around the last few months.” He stopped in the middle of the hallway and then grabbed Draco’s hand, pulled him into a corner.
“Maybe someday soon. I’m paying that witch a fortune for the curse to be broken, after all,” Draco said. “In the meantime, I think we have a killer to catch.”
“You are a great teacher,” Harry replied and looked at Draco as he slowly withdrew his finger. “Another one, I think?” It was only half a question, by now he knew Draco’s body well after all.
“You wrote it, so-“ Harry shrugged.
“This place, it offers professionals?” Potter asked.
Harry had never really thought about that, but Ivan was of course right. The Dark Mark was a stain, and even with his excellent grades it would have been hard for Draco Malfoy to find employment in Britain.
Draco shrugged. “It seems this is the moment.”
“You should call me Harry,” Potter said and held out his hand, “That is my name.”
Hell, Harry thought, he had imagined that scene from Draco’s book, but having Draco play it out with him was so much better, so much more arousing.
Luna nodded. “Well, maybe he’s only mine.”
“Why are you congratulating me then?”
Pansy looked pissed, but she didn’t leave the table. She also wasn’t making any kind of conversation with anyone, so lunch would have been a pretty silent affair if it hadn’t been for Luna and her talent to talk any awkward silence to death. After they were done and Draco had banished the remains and plates to the kitchen, he looked at Potter. Potter looked steadily at him over the wide expense of the old mahogany dining table. Luna touched Potter’s hair gently, then grabbed Pansy’s hand. They disappeared up the stairs.
“Could be your next clue then, Potter,” Draco said.
Potter of course ignored it. “How did you know? We kept most of the gruesome details to ourselves, because we don’t want to risk a panic.”
“Well, I also bound you to mine, I can feel your magic in the wards, mingling with my own,” Harry said. “It’s a rather pleasant feeling.”
“You’re not going to tell me anything else about it, are you?” Harry asked.
“They know you can be killed, Harry.”
Ivan looked at him. “Are you working on a new case? Because I should know that, as your partner and all.”
“Why am I here?” Potter interrupted. He folded his hands on the table. They were good hands, Draco noted, big and strong. Clean, too. Draco had always liked big hands on him, well...before.
Harry swallowed. “And can I fuck you?”
“A what?” Potter asked.
Harry wasn’t really used to being interrupted anymore, except maybe by Hermione. He was an accomplished Auror and an expert in his field.
“You're working with Potter on a murder case,” Pansy repeated.
“Like you should have, because you were a child wizard raised amongst wizards and witches,” Harry said. “It’s funny, because I am still discovering new and exciting things about this world.”
Draco looked up at him. “I did.”
Well then, Draco thought and summoned his quill, parchment and ink.
“Yes, the writer, Harry,” Draco answered.
“And why is that?” Harry asked in a teasing tone.
“So?” Draco asked with a raised eyebrow.
“You never seemed the artistic type at school,” Harry said.
“Have you been with a lot of people?” Harry asked. They were in what Draco had come to think of as their classroom. Harry was sitting on a desk and looking up at Draco who was standing between his legs. Harry’s lips were a bit puffy and shiny from kissing. Draco imagined that his didn’t look much different. Kissing Harry had fast become an addiction.
“And now you’re an artist and a Seer,” Harry said.
“I don’t know,” Harry answered, because he didn’t. He looked at Antoine.
“As I was saying,” Harry continued as if she hadn’t interrupted him, “the Manor is really very secure. You couldn’t even step anywhere else. You came through the hall and then directly to this library, which are the only two rooms without extensive wards on them.” And the wards were really good. With variations Harry hadn’t seen on any other house or Manor before. He was pretty sure Malfoy had invented them himself.
“But it went wrong and it killed everyone, and brought me back.”
Harry’s eyes snapped to Blaise’s face. “Oh, good.” It was stupid how relieved he felt by that little yes. Just because Draco was into men, it didn’t mean he would be into Harry. That was not how attraction worked after all.
“I am glad you chose a dark alley with no witnesses around,” Draco replied. There weren’t many spells he could do wandlessly, but he had learned some on his travels. He had no time to play around. Harry was waiting for him at home. He drew the sigil in the air and heard Julien gasp a second later. The wand at his throat wavered and then fell to the ground. Draco stepped away and looked at the man who had killed his friend, who had marked little Krabat for life. Anger and hatred were rising up inside him.
Besides he didn’t want to tell Harry no, he wanted to feel Harry’s lips pressed against his. “First time kissing a boy?” Draco asked.
“You know very well I read all of your books,” Harry said, as he got up from his chair and walked over to where Draco was sitting.
“Some higher ups, also frequent that club,” Bain said. “Things at the Ministry are crashing down, so far we’re keeping it from the public, but Minister Winters is pissed off. We haven’t seen anything like this since Shacklebolt became Minister of Magic and cleaned it all up.”
“Come up then, Mr. Potter,” Draco said, and turned on the stairs.
“I did and still do. In fact, I was thinking maybe we could use some of that knowledge tonight,” Harry replied, and Draco had to kiss him. Just thinking about Harry tied up to their bed made him hard.
“Be curious somewhere else,” Draco replied. “And stop stalking me.”
“I love you too,” Harry said, because he knew that this was Draco’s declaration and his claim, and he wanted to state his own in return.
“I’ve been on some of the cases you helped solve,” Harry replied. "It seems odd that I wouldn't turn up until now.”
They were in the sitting room. Draco found that he liked having people over again. Maybe his mood was improving because he was having regular orgasms with another person now, but he didn’t hate Bears and his professionalism. Bears was probably aware that Draco and Potter were hooking up. He seemed like a smart guy, once you got to know him better.
“Thank you for letting me see it again,” Harry said.
“Well, fuck,” Harry said and ran a hand through his unruly hair.
Harry sighed. He had felt the tension whenever he had talked about Draco with the people who had claimed to be his friends. Really only Luna seemed like she was fine with it. Neville was slowly coming around, but Ron never had a good word to say about Draco.
Draco’s fingers found his nape and then he started to stroke that spot at the base of Harry’s skull that made him feel boneless.
“Someone like Julien,” Harry said.
“Come down then and have dinner. Blaise will be here in a few weeks to keep you company and get you out of your head so you don't lose your mind.”
“Do you think Belladonna is a woman?”
“Yes, but more specifically being fucked by a man,” Draco said. “Because you see I am-“
“That is exactly what I’m saying, Mr. Malfoy.”
Harry was careful and took his time, pressing in one finger and then another, and Draco was oddly touched but also impatient. His hands were trembling and he pressed them more firmly against the wall. His prick was rock hard and leaking and he needed Harry to stop being careful and get inside him already.
“Cunning,” Potter said.
“I hurt you too, countless times in countless ways,” Draco said. “I think we’re even.”
“You look nervous, Draco. Are you going to propose?” Harry joked.
Neville took his time re-potting a small plant and then looked at Harry. “Is there a boy you like, Harry?”
“Draco!” Potter said and sounded to Draco’s amusement scandalized.
Harry didn’t know if Antoine meant Draco’s taste or Harry’s in Draco’s mouth and he didn’t care. Watching them kiss was – odd, because he knew he should have felt jealousy, probably, but there wasn’t any to find anywhere inside him.
“I lost a lot of people in the war,” Harry said. “None of them were killed by Draco Malfoy.”
“Truthfully?” Harry asked and Blaise smiled again, like he was proud.
Harry looked at him sharply. “What would you have done in his situation? He was sixteen, his home had been invaded, he couldn’t tell anyone, he lived with a madman who killed people just for the fun of it in front of him. He was in danger, his parents were in danger, the people he cared about, his friends were in danger.”
Once she was gone, Harry sat down on the very comfortable leather armchair and stared into the flames of the fireplace. He knew he had to tell Draco about Goyle, but he was also selfish. He knew that now that one of Draco’s own had been murdered, he wouldn’t be so docile anymore. If Draco liked to admit it or not, there was a bit of a hero buried deep inside him too.
Auror Bain nodded. “Granger looked into Lerch’s past too. He was in his fourth year when the Deatheaters took over the school. He was also tortured by Grabbe and Goyle.”
“Because everything is water under the bridge now?” Draco asked, anger slipping into his tone. He didn't like how Potter always got a rise out of him. On the other hand: it went both ways. It was only a small comfort. He didn't give Potter time to answer before he continued. “It seems to me that it's not. Not for everyone. If it were, we wouldn't be here right now, would we? This,” he pushed the sleeve of his shirt up and showed Potter the Dark Mark, a bit faded for sure, but still so visibly there and a reminder of his, of their past. “this still seems to matter to some people.”
“It was personal for me the moment I was told Draco Malfoy is the Seer,” Harry replied.
“Jealous? Really? You had everything. At least in the first few years we went to school,” Harry replied.
“What will I do? What will Draco do? He’s been declared dead. The last Malfoy heir, gone. His mother has left the country… what will the Ministry do once he shows up? They’ll see him as a threat, Antoine.”
“Because I’m halfway there, Draco. You were so willing the first time.”
Draco nodded, flopping down into what Harry by now considered Draco’s chair. Draco hardly spent any time at his own little flat anymore.
The Manor was clean once they got inside. Just because no one lives here anymore doesn’t mean that no one takes care of it, Potter, he could almost hear Draco saying.
“Someone?” Draco asked, there was amusement in his voice.
“Eat your breakfast,“ Blaise said.
“I don’t want to live there anymore and I can’t imagine anyone else wanting to live there, but using it as a work space, yes I can see that happening.”
“I could use some fun. Hermione was teaching me ‘Wingardium Leviosa’ today,” Harry said.
“Not the time or place, Malfoy, we’re trying to save your life-“
Antoine looked out of the window and at the darkness outside, that wasn't really darkness in the city, Harry thought. “You have seen him.”
Antoine smiled. “Come on now, don’t be mean.”
Harry nodded and because he was on the topic anyway, he asked; “I know you need blood to survive-”
Draco smiled. “Cunning,” he repeated.
“To be fair, I approached him,” Antoine said calmly. “Mister Potter was looking for you. And I was
“You want to steal me away, Harry?” Draco asked, there was amusement in his voice.
It was so weird to Draco that Potter and Blaise weren’t only friendly, but on their way to becoming friends.
“And here we are now,” Draco said.
“What you’re doing is called stalking, Potter,” Draco said. He had been very aware of Potter sitting outside the gates. The wards had told him that. He had ignored it in hopes that Potter would get bored staring at the manor and just leave, but that was three hours ago.
He sunk to his knees and took a breath. He had done this before, not that many times. He had some experience, but his sexual exploration and education had pretty much stopped his sixth year.
“But they are meant to make me feel better, right? And I want the same thing for you, Harry. I want us both to be better than we were.”
“Yes, Harry, today.”
“Are you going to tell him before you fuck him?” Blaise asked.
“You could buy in with the manor,” Harry said.
She smiled at him. “Well, I love you too. Now come down; I don’t want to be in the same room as this thing.”
“Get lost before I call the Aurors on you.”
“But it’s not a vision,” Potter said. It was kind of a question too.
“Decent enough for pillow or dirty talk,” Draco said and thrust in hard.
Harry nodded. “Yes, good. I want it destroyed. I don’t need it and I don’t want anyone to have evidence of what I did. Not even myself.”
“Harry will protect him. When it comes to protecting Draco he has a very good track record, Pansy,” Luna said.
“Various reasons for that. One of them is how you got all that money in such a short time, when the Ministry seized pretty much all the Malfoy fortune, your lands and assents.”
“Well, I don’t think so, but if you want to know if I will have kids, probably not.”
“How did you know about that?”
That was the question, wasn’t it? What did Harry want? “Just curious I guess.”
She snatched her hand back. “Of course, sorry. I never...when? They look old.”
“I heard he went to France for a while with his mother,” Harry said, but now wondered if that had been true or not. He hadn’t cared at all back then. He'd had his own life to live for the first time.
Draco stared at the point where their bodies were joined, and Harry stared at Draco’s face. Then Draco looked up. “Move,” he demanded, and Harry did, because Draco using that tone in bed made Harry forget any reason.
“I’ll take my breakfast in the garden,” Potter said.
It was a rather pleasant feeling. “So, what now? Because I think someone at the Ministry or Aurors’ office fucked up. I mean, they came at us with no warning.”
“Yes, I believe you do, Mister Potter,” Antoine said.
“I’m going to stay over here and you will tell me about that painting.”
“I think you should call me Harry,” Potter said.
“Get lost, Potter.”
“Gloriously fucking,” Draco added and made Harry laugh. It was a good sound, Harry’s laugh, Draco decided, he wanted to hear it more often.
“Yes, you did. But nothing about little Krabat being marked up for the rest of his fucking life!” Draco exploded.
Draco nodded, because this was an excellent idea.
Harry grinned and got up from the chair. “Thanks for the tea.”
The honest answer would be yes. Yes, he was scared because this reckless, impulsive thing with Malfoy could destroy what he has built over the last ten years. Harry had no intention to answer Draco honestly. After all there was a history of big and small lies between them, why should this moment be different?
“I mean, you’re not in pain,” Harry said. His hand was on Draco’s hip and he liked it there. He also liked that he could reach out and bury his fingers in Harry’s hair.
Harry nodded. He didn't even feel offended. There was always the possibility that a wizard would use that knowledge for their own selfish reasons.
“Leave the past in the past,” Draco said.
“We can’t let him have these powers, Mr. Malfoy,” Henri said.
“At the beginning yes, but then we realized that you were after something else.”
“Well, the old and old fashioned pureblood families will never admit they have anyone like that, because it’s all about heirs and blood lines, but of course there are queer people living amongst us. Blaise Zabini likes both women and men,“ she answered.
“That is a horrible idea,” Pansy said. “It’s like he doesn’t even listen to me,” she added, looking at Luna.
“Don’t you?” Harry shot back.
“Thank you, Ms. Lovegood, you can go now,” Head Auror Thompson said.
“I went back when I was trying to find the other Horcruxes,” Harry said.
And Draco laughed.
“You think I’m brave?”
They were finally in front of the guest room. It was the one the farthest away from Draco's own bedroom. It was better for his sanity that way. Because there was something about Potter, there had always been something about Potter.
“Belladonna sure has a way with words,” the witch sighed. She was clearly a fan, Draco thought.
“I promise, you will enjoy the show,” Draco said and Harry’s dick made an attempt to get hard again, once the implications registered in his brain.
“It’s a good ploy to lure him out of hiding,” Draco admitted as he and Harry watched the announcement together. Weasley was in the other room, because it was his turn as their bodyguard. He and Weasley probably never would be friends, but Draco could admit that Weasley was a capable Auror. And what was even more important of course was the fact that he cared deeply about Harry.
“Because I had to,” Draco repeated.
“It will be fine, Astra,” Harry said and then took a sip of coffee. Draco watched his throat work and then put his wand down on the table. He needed to get a grip. He had never felt like this before. Well, yes, back in the day when he had been obsessing about Harry Potter and funny enough now he knew that Harry had been obsessing about him in return, but this was more, this was deeper. And it was frightening as well. He’s been here before in a way: on the edge of losing everything and he had made it through. It had cost him dearly, but he had made it. He could feel Harry’s eyes on him and looked up. Their eyes locked and as cliché as it was, everything inside Draco clicked into place.
“You look like shit Potter,” Draco said.
Draco nodded. It was a nice place, for a Muggle restaurant, with its clean lines and warm wood accents. Draco liked it. Being here gave him a sense of freedom and escapism. These days Draco didn’t feel like going out to Wizarding restaurants much. It was weird of course, how still the newspapers were and it was weird how people dressed and it was weird to see same sex couples holding hands on the street like it was the most normal thing in the world.
“Are you sure about this, Mr. Malfoy?” Henri asked. “I know this is hard for you and I know you can’t remember all of it, but you heard a voice in that forest.”
“The scar,” Antoine answered, with a slight nod to Harry's chest. “Is it not a nearly exact replica of the one you gave young Mister Malfoy when you were both schoolboy's?”
“We need to be naked and we need lube,” Draco replied and waved his fingers.
“Is it justice if I let you kill him? Or is it vengeance?”
Draco cursed, but kept silent while Harry pleasured himself until he came all over his fingers. And then Draco was right there: kissing Harry.
“I never interpret them myself. I mean, except for the first two; that was when I realised that they were visions. You know, I went to the Ministry five times before anyone deemed it important enough to hear me out? And then, only after McGonagall had seen the paintings and called in some favours.”
“You want to throw away all we did together, everything we suffered, seven years of friendship for Malfoy?” Ron asked, outraged.
“You and me, Blaise, we didn’t fucking start that war either,“ Draco said. He was slowly coming to the realization that his father had been blind to anything except power. That he had sacrificed the manor, his marriage and his son to get that power. Anger was like a living thing inside him. It was a blood red snake in his veins.
“Was I a good person?” He asked Draco a week later after their lesson was over. The headmistress had given them a room for the private lessons and Harry came to think of this room as theirs.
Harry had started three letters to let Draco know that he didn’t have to go to dinner with Harry and then crumbled them all up. He wanted to go to dinner with Draco. Selfishly he didn’t want to give Draco an out now that he had finally agreed.
“You’re too far gone to be afraid,” Antoine replied, amused.
“Draco thinks the murderer might have me in his sight as well – precisely because of that.”
“I figured,” Draco replied.
“Well, I can be touched, but it hurts like hell and doesn’t seem worth the trouble.”
Potter rattled a list of truly boring books about the history of the wizarding world. “And of course some of the first year school books,” Potter added.
“I don’t think this is all you are, Draco,” Potter said and brushed his hair aside, so the lightning bolt shaped scar was visible, “like this isn’t all I am.”
“What look?”
Potter stopped and looked at him.
“Mind if Blaise joins us?” Draco asked.
Draco looked at him. “What?”
Draco had half a mind to decline such an expensive gift, but it was a gift worthy of a prince, wasn’t it? He thought, as a smile curled up his lips.
Harry wasn't so sure, but – the way Antoine said 'Draco', how it rolled from his tongue. Similar to how it rolled from Harry's. That meant something and it was stupid that Harry was realizing it just now.
“Let me finish, okay?” Harry asked and when Draco nodded, he continued, “I think I am in love with you, I can’t remember if I was ever in love before, people keep telling me I was, but really, it doesn’t matter. I was told these people are my friends, but to be honest, I can’t really remember all the things we supposedly did together. I like them, mostly, but I don’t feel that deep connection to them. And I feel guilty for it, because they do feel it, but I just – I think I can’t be their friend out of guilt, that isn’t a good basis for anything. And I would rather break it off with Ron and Hermione than be without you and if Ron hurt you, Draco, I will hurt him.” He could feel Draco relax.
“Looking at you, I want to crawl over there and suck your dick, Potter, but I also want to live and solving this as fast as possible is very high on my agenda,” he replied and Harry groaned.
“Excellent,” Blaise replied. “Just let me read this once more. Why didn’t we try anything like that when we used to fuck?”
“Well, if you want me on my knees at all, then we should get married,” Harry replied.
Maybe he craved all that space and the light that streamed through the big windows so much because he had spent his first eleven years in a cupboard under the stairs. Thinking back, the way he was raised – used and mistreated – still made him angry sometimes.
“Luna spotted him, and by then she had already sent the picture to Henri,” Draco said.
“You don’t have to marry the guy, but wouldn’t that be delightfully scandalous? Just fuck his brains out and be done with it.”
“For being a good friend.”
Spells like the one Draco had described to him, the one he had seen in the painting, didn’t work so well with pureblood Muggles, but they could work on Muggles born with magic blood. Maybe the killer thought he could do it with diluted blood, so to speak, and once those attempts failed he moved to witches and wizards.
Draco was well aware that Potter had saved his life years ago. “Are we keeping score?”
His first bird wasn’t as nice looking as Draco’s but it wasn’t bad either.
It had always irritated Draco that Potter could so casually call him by his first name when they weren’t even friends.
“I would,” Harry replied.
“Maybe you are,” Draco admitted.
“We kept the details from the public,” Thompson said.
Over the last ten years, the Wizarding world had adopted a few of the handier electronic devices that Muggles made, and portable phones were on the top of that list. Draco hadn’t bothered, because it was fun to listen to Luna’s stories about dealing with the art dealers in London and beyond.
Henri nodded. “Yes.”
“You do have a reputation as a bit of a thrill-seeker, no?” Antoine asked.
Harry swallowed. He tried not to think about that. With time, what had happened to him in the Forbidden Forest had become a hazy dream. Maybe he hadn’t really been dead. Maybe it had been some kind of coma.
“Does it really matter?” Antoine asked.
“I don’t care,” Harry repeated. “Let them speculate about who is fucking who and how.”
“We don’t know if Joel is the one who is alive,” Potter said.
And wasn’t that a punch to the gut? “So, this is the moment?”
He shook his head, but it wasn’t a no. “It would be stupid to get involved with anyone at this point.”
“I figured,” Pansy said. “Now that he’s stalking you, are you going to act on any of it?”
Suddenly he felt like he needed to be away from Potter and his too green, too sincere eyes. He had the insane urge to bow but caught himself in time and just nodded at Potter and then made his way down the stairs and into his study. Once he was behind solid wood doors, he took a shaky breath. This was not going like he had thought it would go. His heart was beating too fast in his chest and there was something like fear coursing through his veins. But really, what else was new? Potter had always been bad for his health.
“Yes, you are.”
“We need to stall then,” Harry said. “Write him back, don’t sign anything.”
“Yes, I know,” he said with a glance at Antoine. “But there is something about you. I don’t think I would have remembered anyone else. It has always been you. I was obsessed with you at school.”
Harry had half a mind to tell Draco his family had been killed by Voldemort, but Draco knew that, and it hadn’t been what Draco meant, anyway.
“It’s nothing. I get impatient when I think I’m close to figuring something out.”
Astra nodded. “Don’t do anything stupid.”
“You didn’t mean it.”
“I really, really shouldn’t,” Draco replied, remembering how easy it had been to kill Joel. And he had loved Joel at one point in his life.
“Go out with him. It won’t be easy, and you might get a bloody nose for your troubles, but you might also get Harry Potter.”
“Good to see you too,” Harry replied as he let Blaise inside. Pansy Parkinson followed.
“We found nearly everyone on the list with Malfoy’s enemies or former business rivals like he likes to call them, and a lot of them are dead, Harry,” Astra said. “Died over the years – some under suspicious circumstances. A lot of them had been Deatheaters or war criminals as well, so there weren’t many investigations launched.”
Neville leaned in and looked at Harry. “It’s not too late, you know?”
“Which ones did she give you?” Draco asked despite himself. He wanted to hate it, but it was hard to hate the thing you always wanted and now had a chance to get.
“So what are you doing now? I mean, you aren’t employed anywhere,” Harry asked.
Draco pretended to think about it.
“You’re not alien here,” Draco said.
Not him that was for sure. Draco had been fully prepared to hate Potter for the rest of his life after Potter had declined his friendship. But the rest of his life was a long time. And it had turned out there were worse things than not having Harry Potter as a friend.
Harry blinked. “What about Antoine, do I love him too? Do you love him too? Why didn’t you tell me about Antoine?”
“Find out what he wants to keep a secret then,” Pansy said.
Bloody hell, Draco thought. That mix of innocent and bold really did it for Draco. “I want to suck your cock, Harry.” He had been thinking about it for days in fact and it seemed that Harry was ready to take the next step now too.
“I think what you saw and had to do in that house while he was there with all of you,” Harry said and meant it, “was punishment enough.”
“Harry Potter just asked me if I wanted to go to Hogsmeade with him,” Draco said and sat down hard on one of the sofas.
“Ah,” Blaise said.
“I don’t like that it’s been so silent,” Ivan said.
“It’s a simple enough spell. I learned it when I was eleven,” Draco replied and conjured a stack of colorful paper. “We start with the basics,” he said and then proceeded to show Harry how to fold an Origami crane. Harry watched Draco’s hands, his fingers. He had nice fingers, long and slender, a bit boney with fine round nails that looked like polished glass.
“He’s not up to no good,” Ron said and made a face. “Never thought those words would come over my lips.”
Maybe it was the sheer will to live and go back to Harry that made his heart beat calmly in his chest.
“Good,” Draco said.
“He’s probably a virgin,” Draco said.
“Something about you makes me want to misbehave, Draco,” Potter answered.
“I am still alive, am I not?”
Harry stripped out of his clothes and sat down. His cock was definitely into this whole thing. He glanced over at Draco, but Draco was back to studying the papers Astra had brought over. He closed his eyes and replayed the hottest of his encounters with Draco in his mind. It was a filthy little porn movie in his head, staring himself and Draco, he moaned even before he started to stroke his cock.
“I'm here, aren't I?”
She narrowed her eyes. “He had lovers before you came along.”
“Well, at least this one is tamer than ‘Knots’,” Harry said.
“Or us, Draco,” Harry reminded him gently and then kissed him.
Potter shook his head. “I didn’t mean that. I believe you when you say you woke up to body parts everywhere, but what if it wasn’t the ritual that killed those people?”
“Morning,” Potter said, running a hand through his unruly hair. He was wearing muggle clothes: a tight dark green t-shirt and jeans. His feet were bare, but that was alright, because the marble floors had a heating charm on them of course. He was holding a mug of coffee and he smiled at Draco.
Blaise looked up from the parchment and arched a brow. “Can you even write that?” he asked.
“Or would that not be okay? I honestly don’t know how these things are handled in the Wizarding world,“ he confessed.
“The word you’re not using, Potter, is ‘lovers’,” Draco said. “Not so brave after all?”
“I think you want to misbehave all the time."
“What?”
It was crazy and impulsive, but on the other hand it wasn’t like Draco was a stranger, and he had always wanted Draco to—well, notice him, pay him attention. He had always wanted to help Draco as well, and now he could have it all. Was it wise? Probably not, but it felt right. He nodded.
Draco gave her a look that hopefully conveyed eloquently how much that wasn’t helping him. She rolled her eyes at him and handed him a Petit Fours.
“We can, but everything pales in comparison to the real thing,” he smiled again. It was a nice smile, a smile that invited you in. That made you want to be closer. Nothing like Draco's smile and exactly like Draco’s smile, Harry thought. “And I don't think I need to make the effort with you Mister Potter, do I?”
“Someone would for sure,” Blaise said.
~Prologue~
Harry nodded. They hadn’t had another incident for over ten days. He also hadn’t spoken to Draco Malfoy in over ten days, though he also hadn't tried to contact him. Luna had informed him that Draco wasn’t taking any visitors.
“I want to see all of you,” Harry cut him off. “I think it’s hot when you fuck me with all your clothes still on while I am naked, but I also want to feel all of you against my skin, Draco. You don’t have to hide whatever it is you’re hiding.”
“Harry, you’re spending time with Malfoy and Blaise Zabini, both of them former Death Eaters,” Hermione said gently.
Harry gave him a look and then smiled. “I like this side of yours.”
“Still alive, but are being moved to more secure locations. Higher ups want to move Malfoy as well,” Astra said.
Astra nodded. “The poor kid, I mean he’s only three. This is seriously messed up. It will be all over the media soon enough. You know we can’t keep that under wraps for too long. Someone at St. Mungo’s will talk to the press.”
Draco nodded. Usually, they didn’t bother. The only one who ever came to look at the paintings was Henri, but this one had Potter involved, so Draco was pretty sure that someone from the Ministry would pay them a visit soon.
“Sixth year,” Draco answered.
“But you still want to do it?”
“The formalities are nearly dealt with, Zabini Publishing will be up and running soon. Once it’s all finalized, I will let Pansy design a raunchy mysterious cover for your new book,” Blaise said.
“Because it’s Potter?”
“Are you kidding me?” Harry asked.
~Four~
For what, Harry wondered. Because despite everything, he was still in love with Draco. He wouldn’t be here if not for Draco. He -
It was strange how fast it became routine, to wake up, check on the wards, brush his teeth, put on clothes and go down to the kitchen to have breakfast with Harry James Potter. It hadn’t been even a week and Draco was already mostly used to it. He didn’t even mind that much that they had to cook for themselves, as Draco had to sent his staff away for the time being.
“You had a backup plan, how very Slytherin of you,” Draco said and there was approval in his voice. Harry liked it when Draco was pleased with him, it made angry butterflies invade his stomach, and his cock even harder. Just thinking back to Draco teaching him how to suck cock: how Draco had praised him when he got it just right, made Harry shiver in a good way. “Where did you just go, Harry?”
“But they did,” Draco said, looking away from Harry’s face to the canvas.
“I’m not going to answer that.”
Draco laughed. Hell, was Potter flirting with him? It certainly sounded like it. “You think I’m dangerous because I’m powerful?”
Being naked with two vampires in the room should have been scary, but all Harry could feel was the blood in his veins, the rush of excitement and the throbbing of his dick.
“No, I won't,” Antoine said.
“It can be, but ultimately we are all human too,” Antoine answered.
Pansy snorted. “As if you don’t know. How long did you have those thoughts about Potter, Draco?”
Draco leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms over his chest. “What do I want to do, Potter?”
“If you change a wizard, do they use their magic?”
Ivan was silent for a long moment, and then he nodded. He had made a decision and Harry was pretty sure he would help him.
“It doesn’t feel like a vision. I was in full control when I did this...” His eyes flickered to the painting again, to this young, carefree, stupid, weak version of himself. “I thought I loved him, you know?”
“Yes, at the tender age of sixteen,” Harry replied. In hindsight, he felt sorry for the boy Draco had been, the impossible position he had been forced into.
“Just show me to my room, Malfoy,” Potter said.
They had just finished breakfast when Granger, Weasley and Auror Bain arrived at their door. At least Draco felt somewhat human again after he had eaten.
“No.” Draco said.
“Yes, but we both know this is different,” Harry said.
“What are you going to do about the manor?” Potter asked, closing the book and standing up. He was nearly as tall as Draco now, he always used to be smaller. Draco had enjoyed looking down on Potter. He had filled out too. He was broader than Draco, who was still slim and made up of sharp angles.
“Keep me updated please,” Harry said.
“How you say my name,” Harry answered.
“You know me,” Draco said, but Harry recognized the challenge there.
“Slytherin were always a loyal bunch, Harry. We didn’t always get what they were about, or what they valued in their friendships but it isn’t less strong for it. I see it now with the younger kids. Slytherin values aren’t bad, they’re just different. Suited to certain people, they complement other houses’ strengths and values as well.”
“Draco- “
Draco rolled his eyes. “Of course I won’t sign anything with him. I already signed a contract with Blaise.”
Harry looked at him. Draco’s eyes had always fascinated Harry. They were so expressive. “You want to fuck me?”
“Potter,” he said. “The headmistress thinks it’s a good idea for me to teach you about the wizarding world.”
“I told you about Goyle, Draco,” Harry said mildly.
“Just fucking ask him, he might tell you. In detail,” Draco replied and then left, his eyes still trained on Granger and Weasley.
“Since when are you so optimistic?” Draco asked.
“Lucius, after my father,” Draco said. “I might have it changed or removed altogether.”
“There are some things I should take care off, once Draco is feeling better.”
“I’m going to call it ‘The Artist in Agony’," Draco said.
There was sweat on Draco’s pale chest and the scar was even paler still. It matched his own and that had been the reason Draco had made it look like this.
Draco shrugged. At this point he didn’t even really care if it got published, this one felt different. He was self-aware enough to know that all of his characters were pieces of himself in a way, but this one was – this one was a whole other deal.
But Luna had said that Blaise Zabini liked both men and women and he was still friends with Draco, so Draco probably wasn’t in any way disgusted by homosexuality.
“But we don’t do that anymore,” Harry said, gently.
Draco reached out to the wards of Grimmauld Place tentatively and found them strong and welcoming. He felt instantly calmer.
“I heard-“
“You are a very powerful wizard, Mr. Malfoy, one of the most powerful your line has ever seen, and it seems your blood-magic is trying to...well, make you reconsider. The ironic part is that before you died, you weren’t that powerful. Still a powerful wizard yes, but—" She shook her head.
“Because all we’re going to do is fucking, eating, napping and fucking again,” Draco replied matter of fact.
“I’m doomed if you bring him in,” Draco replied. He began to strip.
“I could ask a favor from a few Auror friends,” Harry continued.
She looked at him with kindness in her eyes. “It’s not hopeless.”
“Your manor?” Harry asked.
“Yes, back to the task at hand,” Antoine said.
“You shouldn’t have touched him,” Luna said. There was something sad and furious and protective in her eyes, like Draco was a defenseless, naked, small thing that needed to be protected at all costs.
“I will see you later,” Antoine said and left them alone. Harry listened to the door click shut and then leaned his head on Draco’s bony shoulder.
“Okay,” Harry said. “Okay, so maybe the whole no touching thing is just a side product. Maybe something at Malfoy Manor triggered it.”
Draco looked up at him. It probably was the first time he had ever said those words to someone. “We need to end this. I am tired of hiding and running.”
“I’m never a git,” Draco said.
“Harry,” Blaise said and Harry knew it was an invitation to call Blaise by his first name too. They entered a spacious living room and sat down. Blaise offered him tea and a maid served it.
“And Malfoy let the Death Eaters into the school. He didn’t ever apologize for that-“
Pansy snorted and Blaise gave her a look, and then continued, “Maybe we can combine it with the release of your new book.”
“We should hit them all in one night,” Harry said.
“Merlin,” Draco hissed and got up, he made himself at home in Potter’s lap, his fingers in Potter’s unruly hair. “You think you are a convenience fuck for me?”
After spending a weekend reading bits and pieces of these books he was pretty sure that it was him and Draco and not the sensual writing of one H.J. Belladonna. But the Belladonna books had set Harry on this little adventure of self-discovery.
“Because we need to talk about this?” Harry answered. Draco had an excellent point: why was he using his mouth to talk when he could be kissing Draco.
“Exceptions can me made,” Antoine said.
“No, we don’t do that anymore,” Draco said. It was sometimes too easy to forget that Harry had killed Voldemort. Granted, it was kind of an accident, but Draco was sure that it still weighted on Harry.
The denial was on his tongue, but he was pretty sure that Blaise was right. There have been signs after all. Harry Potter was many things, but subtle he was not.
When he arrived in the dining room, Potter was already there. He hadn’t started on his food yet, and Draco was strangely touched by it.
“It’s not my death—well, it’s not my future death,” Draco corrected himself.
“Look at you, so eager,” Draco whispered and got up. He was standing over Harry now and Harry had to look up at him. He was in the perfect position to lean in and nuzzle at Draco’s cock. So he did just that and was rewarded with Draco’s fingers in his hair and Draco’s moan. “You’re really good at that, but Harry, I want you naked.”
“And the Boy who lived,” Draco said.
“But, they will bring me there. You know it!”
“You’re still Harry James Potter, hero of the wizarding world.”
Potter leaned on the table, his face in his hands and looked at Draco. “This will be dangerous, Draco and it is my job, my literal job, to protect you.”
“But you let the Death Eaters into the school,” Harry said.
“Don’t be nervous, you’ve fucked people before,” Draco said.
“It’s Malfoy,” Ron said again. “Malfoy who let the Death Eaters into the school, Harry!”
His lips were soft and cool and there was steel in his voice, Harry grabbed him by his shirt and puled him down, so he could press his lips against Antoine's. For a moment nothing happened and then Antoine was in Harry's lap, and Harry didn't even know how they had ended up in the armchair but it didn't matter, because the kiss was becoming heady fast.
“But you watched me.”
“Not anymore?” Draco realized that they had both leaned forward over the table while they had been talking. The edge of the wood was digging into Draco’s stomach, but he didn’t much care.
“True, so why start now, right?” Ron replied.
“In the mood, Potter?”
“Me,” Harry said, because he knew exactly what Draco felt right now.
Draco snorted. “I did, Potter.”
“We can’t trust anyone at this point, Astra.”
“He was in their house. He killed Goyle and marked a three-year-old kid! And where the hell were your Aurors Potter when that was happening?” Draco yelled and then stepped away from Potter, because he needed all his anger now. All his anger and his fear, like he had needed it all those years ago, when he had tried to repair that curse Vanishing Cabinet for the Dark Lord.
“Fine,” Pansy replied. “Still, come over and look at the ones I already prepared, okay? We want to get this book out there. The sooner the better.”
“I don’t think it has anything to do with the Manor. It was more that the spells of the ritual were finding new pathways to work and it took some time and this—condition, is a side effect of that.”
The little owl made a noise that Draco interpreted as: how should I know. Get a move on. I’m waiting.
“Where?” Draco asked. The canvas was still wet and some of the paint was dripping, moving like it was alive.
Blaise nodded and then his face became serious. “There is something I need to talk to you about, and it concerns Harry. I wasn’t sure I should tell you, but you are in love with him. He is in love with you and it might help you-“
Good riddance too.
“Can you stand?”
“I’m sorry about that,” Harry said. He was sorry; it had been an accident. He hadn’t really known what that spell would do to Draco.
“You should sell it,” Blaise said.
“Good, because I am so over having people in our place all the time,” Draco replied.
Harry shook his head. “No.”
“You didn’t mean to,” Draco said, because of that he was absolutely sure. He could still remember the shock on Harry’s face when he saw what the hex had done.
“Not when someone is trying to kill me, no,” Draco replied sharply and hated himself for it a second later. He had ruined the mood. Whatever the mood had been. He poured himself tea and added cream and sugar.
“He is worth it,” Draco said.
Blaise nodded. “Fair. I didn’t think you would share details. It’s not how we are built after all.”
“What do you think, Draco?”
And what did that even mean for them now? It was all in the past. Except of course that it wasn’t because here they were again.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Fine, I accept your invitation to dinner.”
“You are and looking radiant as ever,” Harry answered and Draco knew that it was kind of meant as a joke, but his heart did this thing again, where it just stuttered and then beat double like it was racing toward something or making up for lost time.
“You want to make it public?”
“It was different,“ Harry answered.
“I sent copies of the photos over to Blaise’s mother, and am waiting for her reply now,” Draco replied. “Can I have a look at your findings, Auror Potter?”
“Yes,” Harry said. Because he had been trying to invite Draco to dinner for the past week. In fact he had invited Draco and Draco had refused every single one of his invitations.
“I call it ‘The Artist in Agony’,” Draco said.
“For better, I think it’s definitely for better,” Harry said and sat down.
“I didn’t use to be,” Potter replied, “But something about Belladonna sucks you in, it’s intoxicating.”
“He’s back,” Neville said, handing him a cup of tea.
“I think that is because, despite everything, you kept your childlike wonder,” Draco said. Draco hadn’t kept any of his, he was sure, after he let the Deatheaters into Hogwarts. He had to live every day with that. It had been a safe place until Draco had fixed the Vanishing Cabinet.
He was pretty secure in his knowledge of only liking men now. Had come to terms with his sexuality years ago. And he had to thank again Blaise and Pansy for it.
“Just because you are ready to sacrifice things for the greater good, it doesn’t mean you’re a good person or that those sacrifices will be yours,” Potter replied.
Draco smiled. “Richer,” he corrected.
“You did,” Draco said and took Harry’s hands in his. He pulled them to the bed and sat them down.
“Don’t mess with me Malfoy,” Weasley hissed and then left.
“Yes, you do and food. Go and make yourself presentable and then I’m going to take you out for breakfast,“ Blaise said.
“You made the Black House yours instead,” Draco said.
“It’s not sixth year all over again,” Harry said groaning and Blaise laughed again. He had a good laugh, melodic and welcoming. Inviting you in to join him.
“I want these people behind bars, so I can live my life undisturbed again. So that the only things we have to think about are: eating, sleeping, and a lot of that glorious fucking we do so well. Maybe work as well.” He turned to Harry and kissed him gently. “Besides I am not worried.”
But honestly, after twenty-seven years he kind of got attached to it.
“For round two?” Potter asked and Draco laughed.
Harry watched fascinated as Antoine’s thrusts got faster and harder. In that moment when he came, he didn’t look like a boy at all. Nothing sweet about him, just pure sexual energy and power.
“I called you by your first name before,” Potter answered.
It seemed that as Draco was part of the investigation now, Auror Bain didn’t bother with a Muffliato charm anymore.
“Well, what else are friends for?” Pansy asked.
“Well,” Draco said. “Thompson it is, then.”
Draco pulled it away. Blaise sighed.
Harry had thought about it all long and hard over the last few weeks he had been working with Draco and Blaise. He couldn’t really remember his feelings for Cho, or Ginny for that matter, and it probably should have troubled him, but didn’t. He could however still appreciate their beauty, he still found them interesting and arousing. “I still like girls, but there is something about boys – some of them are pretty. I mean, Blaise is really good looking,” Harry explained.
“I guess they chose their pen-name well,” Harry said.
Antoine smiled, showing his fangs. “You smell delicious and I haven’t fed.”
“Does it hurt?” Draco asked. He wasn’t moving, was just looking down at Harry.
“He might have just made a mistake,” she said.
Draco kissed him. “Yes, it was them.”
Harry nodded; he knew that. He told Ivan about the assault and murder; it was still murder in Harry’s book, even if Draco was alive. He told Ivan about the new painting too.
Draco ran his hands over Harry’s stomach and higher: he brushed his fingers against Harry’s nipples and then pinched them.
“Fuck,” Harry said again.
“Well, I wanted to hurt pretty much everyone and couldn’t back then. I was utterly powerless and maybe realizing it for the very first time in that bathroom.” He didn’t like to think about it, but that moment in particular had somehow cemented that he would never feel so powerless again.
“Yes, you do,” Draco replied. Draco had been desperate, and the book had been done. It had written itself really in those desperate hours he felt like he would never get his life back on track again.
“Yes," Draco said. "Five out of thirty-two, and now this one."
“By all means, go. I haven’t chained you to the table, have I?”
“You always had magic. Strong magic.”
He finished his tea and Draco led him up the stairs to his studio. With a flick of his finger, he uncovered it. He didn’t look at Potter’s face as he took in the painting.
“They are old. I got them on the same night I got the visions and the magic,” Draco replied.
Antoine smiled again. “That much is obvious.”
Harry groaned as he took his first sip of blessed coffee.
“How did the murderer get to him?” Harry wanted to know.
“Right,” he said to no one and then pushed away from the door. He missed it at his back for some weird, unexplainable reason. He needed to get a move on. He needed to unpack, and he needed something to eat and coffee, because coffee made everything better and then he needed to talk with Malfoy about all the people he thought might want to kill him.
“Off,” Draco said and sat up. There were spells and charms for it, but it seemed that Draco preferred to do this the old-fashioned way. He pulled first Harry’s shirt off and then the rest of his clothes, until Harry was naked in front of him.
“Show me,” Harry insisted, and Draco let the glamour drop. Harry stared.
Harry frowned, but let it slide. Draco wasn’t ready to tell him, wasn’t ready to confide in him and that was fine. They weren’t that close yet.
“No, not the Manor,” Draco replied. “After he had lived there, after all the things that have happened there, it wasn’t my childhood home anymore.”
“You missed dinner!” Luna said. He hadn't heard her come in. Her eyes moved from him to the painting. “Oh,” she said.
He had first picked it up because Luna had said the main character was an Animagi, a wolf shifter and something nostalgic had pierced Harry’s heart, the longing to see Sirius again maybe, to have some kind of piece of him back. The wolf character was nothing like Sirius, but the whole story had sucked Harry in anyway.
“You’re right. We should set a trap.”
And why, Harry thought, and why then do I want to kiss you so badly when I’m in love with Draco? He swallowed and looked away.
Draco wanted to reply with something witty but bit his lip instead and concentrated on his wards. “I want to seal the house.”
Dinner had fast become the time they were talking about serious stuff, Draco thought. Not that he minded.
Draco pushed him onto the bed in answer. It was big and soft and had of course a canopy, with tiny embroidered twinkling stars on it.
She crossed her arms over her chest. “I think it’s connected to the current case. Potter’s current case, Draco.”
Draco looked up from the papers. “If you keep that up, we won’t solve any crime at all. Ever.”
“Didn’t expect it to be with bloody Malfoy, but that’s life,” Ron added.
“A banished, disgraced prince?” Draco interrupted.
He slept in the studio that night. He had vivid dreams, but no visions. When he woke up it was still dark outside, and the moon shone directly onto that golden scar. Draco got out of bed and sat down, naked, in front of the two canvases. He had dreamed about that place again, about that night that had changed everything for him, giving him the visions, the power, and the inability to stand human touch. He could feel his heart beating faster and faster in his chest the longer he stared at the canvases in the dark. And then he fell inside.
“One I know of,” Draco said.
~Five~
“Are you sure this is an expert?” Draco asked a few days later. There was no new murder and that was good of course, but also Harry could feel himself getting restless. He daydreamed sometimes about taking Draco to a nice restaurant, about holding his hand while they walked through a park and kissing him passionately behind a bar.
“You didn’t get it removed,” Potter said. “I know pretty much everyone had theirs removed.”
Draco ran a hand through his hair. “What am I supposed to do with that now? Tell the Headmistress so no one worries anymore about that attacker?”
“And we suddenly trust Malfoy’s sources more because you’re fucking him?”
“Of course, I was, I am not stupid, Harry,” Draco said.
“Is that a kink of yours?” Draco asked after he was finished.
“This will be an awkward conversation with Hermione and Astra,” Harry said.
“Harry.”
“Why now?”
“Draco,” Harry whispered.
He had done some research with his mobile phone on same-sex romance books and had ordered a bunch from a London Muggle bookstore.
“I don’t know why I did it. Probably because it was you,” Harry said and took another sip of his wine. It wasn’t a bad wine, he decided, not bad at all.
“Draco-“
Harry shook his head. He didn’t mind, he liked Blaise well enough, he was witty, funny and wicked smart. But Harry was hoping that he would be able to grow a pair soon and ask Draco out to Hogsmeade for a drink, a walk, something.
Harry smiled. “Yes, I did, and I hope Draco and I can count on you two to have our backs this time too?”
“I’m not afraid because I know you won't hurt me – in a bad way,” Harry gasped. Draco was so good at this and he was so close, but he needed more. He needed to taste Antoine’s lips.
This time it was Potter who kissed him. He could feel Potter hard against his own cock. “Fuck me,” Potter said.
“Excellent point, Harry. I think you should take that advice as well,” Draco cut in.
“Harry,” Blaise said, “good to see you.”
“If my whole career comes crashing down after this book, I might need to sell the manor,” Draco replied. He might do it anyway. He had gotten out of it what he could. He hadn’t been able to banish the ghosts and demons of that horrific year yet and he didn’t think he wanted to try any longer. He could live anywhere, really. Maybe one day soon he and Harry could move in together. Once this whole thing blew over, he could even assume a new pen name and start anew with Blaise’s help. He knew now that he had talent and will to make it as a writer. The future wasn’t bleak this time around, he wasn’t desperate for money or recognition.
“He made it look that way. Anyhow. They should be on their way far, far away from here, which means I would be the best high value target as I am staying here,” Draco said. He had spent hours in communication with Pansy and Blaise this morning to convince them to leave the country. It would be harder to hunt them down and murder them if they weren’t even in Great Britain. Not impossible, but so far, the murderer had been only killing close to home, so to speak.
Her companion scoffed. “It’s all pornography.”
Malfoy nodded. “Yes, but not everyone is as kindhearted as you are Potter.”
“Who would have it helped to let you die?” Antoine cut in sharply. “You? Draco?”
“It’s just a matter of days now,” Harry said.
“Why didn’t you say anything?”
“Let’s go on a vacation then,” Harry said.
“So, what are you going to do now?” Harry asked once they had showered and made it to bed.Draco was running his fingers in random patterns over Harry’s skin. Harry had his fair share of scars as well, and Draco delighted in being able to map them all out.
Why isn't it smooth? he wondered. Had Henri made a note of it? The white space looked nearly violent in the dark. He dragged a stool near and climbed up on it so he could examine the top of the painting closely. The edges were smooth around the blank space, not like he hadn’t finished it, but like it was meant to be this way. Draco frowned. All his other paintings had always reached the edges of the canvas. He didn’t like blank spaces.
He got up from the floor and walked over to it, his bare feet making no sound on the wood. He grabbed for the tarp and pulled it down. Vision No. 33 looked different in this light. The gold of the scar seemed like it was beckoning, like it was shining. He reached out and rubbed it, feeling the unusual sandy texture.
“Are any of the leads worth anything?” Draco asked to get them back on track.
“You feel so good around my cock, Harry,” Draco said and it went straight to Harry’s heart and cock.
That was a frightening possibility that Harry hadn’t even though off yet.  “I don’t know.”
“I don’t want you to duel him for my fucking honor Harry,” Draco said.
Harry wasn’t going to confirm that, because he knew better than admit to it. “Mrs. Zabini is very knowledgeable, Astra, and you know it. Something doesn’t add up. You visited Krabat?”
“I didn’t know. Didn’t notice,” Draco said.
“I don’t think you will like it,” Draco said.
“What?” Harry asked.
“So what were we then?” Harry wanted to know.
“Why did you agree to do it Draco?” Harry interrupted him.
“Mister Malfoy,” Astra replied and then with a last look at Harry left.
Antoine smiled. “Tempting, it really is, Harry, but I think we should both be as clear headed the next few days as we can be. Drinking from you would be very unwise.”
“He buys the house and moves in with Pansy Parkinson, and later, Luna Lovegood.”
A highly inappropriate comment was at the tip of Draco’s tongue, but he let it go.
“It’s Harry and I don’t want to be a hero. Honestly I have no idea how to be one, or how a seventeen year old kid even survived what I have been through,” Harry answered. He had been talking to various people, a lot of them had been his friends in the past. There was evidence of that. A lot of evidence. People cared about him. He knew he didn’t have any real family anymore, except a muggle aunt and her family, but they weren’t close. He knew that he hadn’t known he had been a wizard until he turned elven years old. He knew that his friends were worried that he was spending time with Draco Malfoy and by extension with Blaise Zabini.
He took it as the peace offering it probably was.
“Of course. Joel.”
“Not for ten years now. And the first time I offered it to you, you threw it in my face,” Draco said. He wasn’t sure why he still remembered that day at Madame Malkin’s but he did.
“I’ll just start a publishing house, should have done that from the start to be honest. You could have made me rich. Been playing with the idea for a while now,” Blaise said.
“Thank you, these are my favorite,” Potter said.
“I worked for it, Potter. Hard I might add,” he said. He wasn’t going to get into the things he had done to get by at first or how he and his mother had to sell pretty much everything of value that they had managed to hide from the Ministry of Magic. He wasn’t going to tell Potter about the less savory things he’s done with the less than savory people he had done them with. It didn’t matter, most of them were dead anyway.
“Yes, I see,” Mrs. Bellke said.
“Did you have full on sex too?”
“If we spin this a bit further, then it must be someone who was there that night, or who knows about this kind of ritual,” Draco said. “Which makes me the only witness.”
“I have a bed you know?”
During those luxurious and sensual explorations of their bodies, Harry had made a few discoveries about Draco and about himself.
“Touch yourself, please, Draco. I’m close and want to see you come,” Harry gave in.
“Is that so?” Antoine asked.
Astra nodded. “What are you going to do about Goyle?”
“Draco didn't feed from me either-”
“You knew and I had to find out through the fucking Prophet!” Draco hissed.
“I didn’t know you were unhinged the first time. I thought you loved me.”
“We should finish our dinner,” Harry said, “and then we should go upstairs and do some of that glorious fucking, Draco.”
“Can I come again?” Potter asked.
Harry kissed him again. “I will tell Ron and Hermione to leave you alone. Blaise too.”
Bloody hell, Draco thought. He was going to be Potter’s bodyguard and not only his teacher in all things wizard. Great, just great.
“I think you should call me ‘Harry’ now that we’re getting naked together,” Harry said.
“You can be cursed, so you can most likely profit from this as well,” Harry replied. “You do drink water, so…is this going to be a problem?”
Laughter soon turned to screams. His screams, loud and echoing and horrendous, until the silence came.
“Yes, there is definitely a connection there,” Ivan said. He looked at Harry. “You want to keep this to yourself for now, don’t you?”
Harry dug his nails into Draco’s back and Draco hissed, but did it again and again and again. Harry never came without a hand on his cock before, but he did now. It took him by surprise. Draco didn’t stop fucking into him, now harder and faster, racing toward his own orgasm.
“I know,” Harry replied. “And I love him.”
“They will know that  it was you then.”
“Yes,” Potter said, but didn’t elaborate on it. He didn’t need to.
Harry blinked. He had never masturbated with anyone else in the room. Even at Hogwarts he had always found somewhere else to do it, not that he had had time to explore his sexuality much when he had been fighting for his life. His heart was beating fast and his cock surely was interested in it. The idea to be naked in this chair, pleasuring himself while Draco was just sitting there and ignoring it, or trying to ignore it was really a turn on for Harry.
Draco let that one slide. “It is important to me. After all people like me are being hunted down and murdered, Potter.” He put an emphasis on the last word.
“Not like this."
“It’s not my birthday or anything,” Draco replied.
“Yes, I did and now I have a successful business, bought nearly everything back I could and wanted-“
“And why is that, Mr. Malfoy?”
“Tasteful pornography,” Draco corrected.
“You could live there rent-free, you know?” Blaise said.
And that was the truth too. “Can you imagine what Weasley will do to me and my face when he finds out I want to fuck Harry Potter?”
Ivan nodded. “Good luck.”
“I didn’t think you’d come out to eat with me,” Potter said.
“Yes,” Antoine answered.
“It’s not a vision, it’s...a memory,” Draco replied. His skin felt itchy now, though he didn’t know why. It was such an irritating fucking feeling he stripped off his shirt.
Harry nodded. “Yes.”
It was like Hogwarts all over again. That one year he had been endlessly obsessing about what Draco Malfoy had been doing.
“Yes, I probably could,” Harry said softly.
He sighed. Hell would not be any help. He took a breath, it wasn’t like he didn’t know how to write these kinds of letters. His father had taught him well after all.
He was not in the slightest surprised that he really wanted Potter to kiss him or do even more than that.
~Two ~
The sound made Harry reach for his wand on instinct.
“They will,” Harry said. “Believe me, they will.”
Harry looked at him sharply. “Are you holding them in place right now?”
“The heart?” Luna asked.
Blaise just shrugged. “Because she liked to talk about you.“ He looked at Draco and Draco didn’t like that look. “I mean I knew for some time now that you aren’t interested in girls, but I think she liked you, Draco. You just didn’t notice.“
Harry took the hint.
“It wasn’t like anyone would have hired me or trained me in a profession here either,” Draco continued. “It was either leave or poverty.” Draco looked him in the eyes then. “I don’t think I would have liked poverty.”
“Yes and no, I booked a room for different days, different weekends, I was hoping it would be today, but if for some reason I wasn’t ready or you didn’t want to-“
“Still no naked men, Pansy,” Draco replied, long suffering.
“You were always dangerous for me, Draco,” Potter replied.
“I loved your pain, and I loved your long and proud and pure bloodline, Draco. You were so fucking perfect for me.”
Draco kissed him hard. “Merlin help you Potter.”
“You talk like it’s a done deal,” Draco objected.
“I don’t intend to hurt him, but this is new to me. I might mess up along the way. More than once. Often in fact,” Harry replied.
“At that time? No, I don’t think I did. But maybe I deserved this for what I did after,” Draco said.
“Yes,” Draco answered. “If you want to.”
“Then we’re halfway there, now strip,” Draco said, and it was the tone that made Harry’s cock pay attention, so he stripped, because it made Draco happy. And because Harry really loved it when Draco took charge like this.
“Now…we’re going to sleep and then tomorrow we can talk about it all,” Harry said.
“I don’t care what people think. I make my own decisions, I make up my own mind about my friends and my lovers, Draco.”
“We also found one of the assailants stuck in the sandpit in the garden, Mr. Malfoy. Nice touch,” Bain said.
Once an idea took roots, it was really hard to rip it out or ignore it. That was why Harry found himself looking at year old newspapers and cashing in favors.
Harry nodded. “I am.”
Potter sucked in a sharp breath and then he stood up and told Draco he was going to bed.
“Well, I didn’t, I couldn’t let on what I was up to, but I think about it often,” Draco said.
Draco looked from her to Potter. “Potter.”
Blaise laughed. “You love Harry. You can say it in front of me.”
“I haven’t tasted you in years, Draco,” he whispered and it sent a shiver down Harry’s spine.
“Did I ever tell you that I love when you do research for your books? We always learn so much,” Harry continued once Draco stopped devouring his mouth.
Harry groaned. “I-“
“Well, I always wanted to be bait,” Draco said.
“That said, please be careful? We don’t know what he has been up to the last ten years, or what he has been through,” Neville continued.
“I love you,” Harry said, as he collapsed half on Draco.
It had taken time to get where he was now. Dating Harry Potter, being an established and successful author and business owner. He still liked to shock his readers with the things he wrote about, but he drew the line at horrid cover art.
“You were afraid they would have blamed you, would have sent you to prison,” Harry said.
“Because I love you, Harry, that is why.” It wasn’t even hard to say the words because they were the truth.
Draco’s heart missed a beat. Was Potter on to him? Was his fledgling writing career going to crash down around him? Was Potter fucking playing with him?
“What brings you here, Harry. Your letter didn’t make that really clear.”
“Congratulations,” Blaise said.
“It was curiosity, I guess,” Draco eventually answered the question. “You didn’t wear me down, Potter. Maybe I want to know who you are now too.”
“Yes, I felt them too, but only because I knew he has them. They are very subtle,” Astra said.
“I bet you were tempted to set in on fire when you spotted Potter there in that corner.”
Potter looked at him for a long hard moment but said nothing, for which Draco was grateful. Something inside him was stirring at seeing Potter, at smelling him. Something like resentment and excitement and—something else he didn’t want to name, but knew. Fear had a strangely sweet scent for him these days.
“I’ve done this a few times and was told I’m quite good at it,” Harry said proudly.
Just thinking about it made Draco mad as hell again.
So Harry sat down. Draco was tempted to pace, but then he sat down too. “I’m Belladonna.”
“Do you think he could be into me?”
“He thinks it would make great offices, just a bit of remodeling and he could build his empire from there.”
“What if that look had to do with Malfoy?”
“Right,” Harry said.
“Okay,” Harry said.
“He sent two tins, so you are golden, Harry,” she replied with a wink.
“I will make a production out of it,” Draco said. “Down the line and you will say yes. We will talk about it beforehand like real adults and –“
“So, we have been having sexual relations for weeks now but we haven’t had real sex.”
“Draco. Are you asking me to move in with you?” Harry asked. He sounded shocked.
“Thank you for having me,” Potter said. His eyes were smiling. He was amused—that made one of them, at least. Draco hadn’t been able to sleep for days because dreams and memories were haunting him. He probably looked like death warmed over, not that it mattered. It wasn’t like he could—he cut that thought short. It was no use; even holy fucking Potter wasn’t able to touch him. In fact, it had felt worse with Potter than with anyone else who had ever tried before.
“The heart. Henri says he doesn’t know what it means.”
He grabbed Draco by the neck and crashed his mouth ho his. There was a brief moment of hesitation, but then Draco was on him. Draco’s fingers were digging into his hips and he was backing Harry into a wall and maybe that was a good thing because he needed something solid at his back. His knees were kind of weak.
“I did.”
“Spit it out, Blaise,” Draco said.
“Well, things are changing, you are right,” Blaise replied. He looked at Draco, it always felt to Draco like Blaise could look right inside you, he wouldn’t always share what he saw there, but he saw things you didn’t even want to look at yourself.
Harry swallowed. He wondered how transparent his feelings for Draco were. “I don't know if-”
Well, Draco had to admit that it could be, but it usually wasn’t for him. “I think you pick the wrong places to pick people up, Potter.”
“They look like they would be good for nibbling and biting,” Draco heard himself say.
Blaise shrugged, but his dark eyes were shining. “Why not? It will surely be a scandal, yes, but it will also promote the book. I think the people who really liked your books, would still buy them, and you being, well you, might get you new readers.”
“Fly?” Harry asked. He and Ron had been flying, but he heard that Draco had been an excellent Seeker, like Harry had and he was sure that flying with Draco would be a whole other experience.
“I like that.”
Draco smiled into his coffee.
A week later he found himself at the gates of the manor again. They were closed. A soft push did nothing to gain him access and when he tried magic the gates flared a cold blue and he stepped away. He looked up at the manor. In the light of day it didn’t look any friendlier. The windows were dark holes and the whole place looked unwelcoming. He wondered why Draco had claimed it, why he had returned to it. He looked away from the house and to the gardens behind it. In daylight they looked even more beautiful.
“Scared Potter?” Draco said and it shouldn’t have, it really shouldn’t have, but it did push all of Harry’s buttons. Just like they had been kids.
“You haven’t seen or spoken to him for ten years, Harry and been cooped up here with him only two weeks, so I don’t think you know him either.”
“I’ve been trying to make him do that.” Harry said.
“Is it good or bad?” Draco asked surprised.
“Fine.” Draco said and took his leg away but let Harry keep holding his hand. Harry kissed his cheek.
Harry had been in his office looking up at the clock every thirty seconds. None of the solutions for his chair situation at Mrs. McGonagall’s had worked so he ended up calling Luna to bring him a new pair of trousers. The benefit had ended by the time he got out of the chair that he just headed home.
“It’s lovely.” Blaise said letting Luna drape it around his neck and tucking it into his coat. “I’m sure Harry will appreciate it when he sees it on me. Thank you.”
Narcissa knew that meant she wanted Harry to stay away until she calmed down.  But also James will definitely get an earful and maybe a hex. Being friends with Lily was so amusing to her.
“Can I come back later?” Harry asked before grabbing some floo powder.
“I admit I’m starting to lose faith in having you promoted.” Mrs. McGonagall said with a sniff. “We’ll speak on this later, when you’ve come to your senses.”
Harry had been so ecstatic to be back that when he got home and saw Malfoy he hugged the blond, asked him out to dinner, and then kissed him all in the span of two minutes. He abruptly pulled away when he felt the blond shaking and was worried he had just ruined everything. It turned out Malfoy was laughing. The blond just said yes to dinner and pulled him back into their second kiss.
If you’re not familiar with sable it’s a type of animal who’s fur is extremely valuable. Like starting price for a full sable coat is $55k. The species isn’t listed as endangered.
“Why?” Draco asked curiously.
“I don’t want anyone denying me that.” Harry said wrapping his arms around Draco.
“Think of it as a countdown to Christmas. Are you saying you don’t want to open it?” Harry asked with a cheeky smile. Draco rolled his eyes as he picked the gift up.
“For the present of the thing that I always wanted, what was it?” Father asked him.
“Try praying.” Blaise said. He walked next to Harry next to the fireplace as the man shut his eyes tight. After a minute Harry opened his eyes and turned to where Blaise had been standing he started to get happy but turned a little more and saw Blaise standing there.
“Seriously? That over me?” Harry asked.
They both sat down on the couch. The blond took his time unwrapping the deep emerald wrapping paper. He folded the paper and set it off to the side, along with the maroon bow. Harry watched Draco’s face intently as the blond slowly opened the black box. There was a slight inhale of surprise as Draco lifted the item out.
Draco trailed after his teenage son, thinking of how much his boy had grown. His son had always been quiet but thanks to his friend, Albus Potter, he really came out of his shell. Draco had been terrified for his son going to Hogwarts but Scorpius was becoming a wonderful young man.
“You’re up to something.” Draco stated when they got back to the blond’s flat from having Christmas brunch with Narcissa, Andromeda, and Teddy.
“You got me Harry Potter visiting for my birthday?” Draco asked blandly.
He dabbed at his lips after licking the last of the syrup and blueberry jam off his fork. He was sad that the meal was over but he may have over ate. A cup of tea was held out to him and he took a sip, savoring his favorite tea made just the way he liked it. He froze when he remembered Potter was sitting next to him. He slowly looked over and saw the other man watching him.
He walked into the room, taking his jacket off, and then throwing it on the closest table. He then squared up and stared Blaise down. Blaise watched him the whole time but didn’t say anything.
“I’m sorry, Luna. I didn’t mean to startle you.” Blaise said as Luna stared at him wide eyed.
A platinum mine was a bit much so I went with a platinum necklace.
“No.” He eventually got out. “Not technically.”
“No. Him and Harry have gone to make house calls.” Luna explained.
“I have one more present for you.” Harry said quietly.
“Should have known.” Harry said annoyed.
“Alright. That’s understandable.” Harry said. “But you’re ok? With this?”
“I thought you wanted to keep this hidden.” Draco said pinching Harry’s side. Harry jerked but didn’t let go.
“Yes Seamus?” Harry asked. He cuddled against Draco when the blond placed an arm over his shoulder.
“Oh my gods Draco!” Harry said trying to sound scandalized but ended up laughing.
Harry headed up the stairs and opened James’ door first. His room was dark and he seemed to be sleeping fitfully so Harry quietly shut the door. He headed to Albus’ room next. He opened the door and Al looked up at him from his messaging parchment. It looked like the boy had some clay or mud smeared on his neck.
“If you glare any harder he might light on fire.” Ron said glancing in the direction Harry was staring and then immediately went back to his food.
“I really can’t. I need to get home. I should...” Draco started but looked st Blaise. “Perhaps for a few minutes.”
“Come sit.” Harry said taking his seat on the couch. Draco sat next to him looking expectant.
“Yes of course. This is Blaise.” Draco said.
“No, Harry. You were praying for guidance. That has been given to you.” Blaise said. Harry walked over to the painting running a hand through his hair. Blaise looked up and said, “Yes just a minute please.”
“Of course I am.” Draco said and then pointed at something behind Harry.”Did you get that for Lily?”
“Blaise can represent you at the meetings. Couldn’t you?” Draco suggested.
With that Draco hurried up the stairs without looking back at Harry. Harry stared up the stairs sadly and then ran a hand through his hair. He walked back into his office and saw Blaise looking through the money pledges.
“You should.” Draco said breathlessly.
“With pleasure.” Harry said as he got off the bed and walked over to the blond. He then hefted Draco over his shoulder, getting an undignified squawk, walked back over to the bed, and gently dropped the blond on the bed. Draco looked at him so disgruntled.
“So you know him?” Remus asked getting a nod from Draco. “In that case why don’t you two stop by my humble abode for some Yuletide cheer?”
“Well, it’s not just any old Saturday.” Scorpius said as he sat on the bed next to Draco. Draco sat up and propped his pillows up behind him.
“I believe the first few times left a lasting impression. And, I trust, that after our extensive talks of proper and safe sex and contraception, that we’ll have nothing to worry about.” Lucius said. “Although there’s nothing wrong with having grandchildren early.”
“You can open your eyes, love.” Harry said. He knew the moment Draco realized where they were when the hand he had been holding to lead the blond squeezed his hand in surprise.
Blaise looked at the cards in his hand and headed back into the office. He glanced out the office window and then walked back to the card catalogue. He tossed the cards into the air and instead of them scattering they hovered above the catalogue. Blaise waved his hands and pointed out where certain cards were supposed to go. He finished organizing in five seconds flat.
“I’m never taking my ring off. I’ll fight anyone that tells me to.” Harry said. He then grabbed Draco’s hand and lifted it up, kissing the knuckle above the ring in a copy of what Draco did earlier.
“Let’s tell everyone.” Harry said and then pouted when Draco stopped kissing down his neck.
“Draco.” Mrs. McGonagall said kindly as she walked over to the blond and kissed his cheek. “How nice of you to come see me. And Harry! A Merry Christmas. Come let’s go to the drawing room.”
Harry tried to catch his breath as he stopped at the threshold into the Owlery. He inhaled and regretted it since he was facing in towards the main room. He quickly turned and took in a few breaths of fresh air.
“You know it’s true love when I let you wrinkle my shirt with no complaints.” Draco said looking down at his shirt before stepping out the door. The last thing he heard was Harry’s delighted laugh.
“Really?” Al asked excited as he sat up then grimaced and laid back down.
Santa cutie, and fill my stocking with a duplex and checks
“Well, early congrats.” Harry said with a grin. Ginny scrunched her face up at him while Luna smiled serenely.
“What are your plans for the day?” Po- Harry asked him.
“As long as your issue is with my cousin and James Potter then all is well.” Narcissa said. “Look at how happy they are.”
Harry kept it extremely casual but couldn’t stop himself from little things like physically being close to Malfoy. The blond let him, which made him extremely happy. They had casually gone out a few times, making the gossip mill speculate on whether they were going out or not. Malfoy would sneer at the more pushy reporters while politely telling the nicer reporters that they were just checking Harry’s progress to see if he could physically be around people. He then plugged his physiotherapy business, which was not what the reporters wanted. There was always still a tiny write up about it but it wasn’t front page news.
———————————-
“Yup.” Harry said as he draped an arm over Draco’s shoulder.
“Oh yes. Did you have a profitable afternoon, Harry?” Blaise fired back. Harry looked down at the scarf around Blaise’s neck.
“I can only promise most of that. How about you sit with me, Ron and Hermione.” Harry said perking up at the idea. Draco looked unsure. “I heard Hermione muttering about a problem in Arithmancy.”
Draco frowned in annoyance that Harry used Urgent to get him here but he stepped closer to get a clearer view. It was a beautifully carved wooden box made from a dark wood, the Black family crest had been burned into the center. Draco reaches forward to open the hinged box, his breath hitching at what he saw.
“I did. From scratch.” Potter said. “Even made the blueberry preserve myself.”
Without straightening his appearance he quickly walked into the room. He stopped short at seeing Harry standing a few feet from the door with his hands behind his back. Draco quickly shut the door and activated the wards that made this room their safe place.
Blaise sauntered over to Draco and saw him watching the snowball fight.
“Uh Yes, it is me.” Remus said befuddled as he tried to sidestep the man.
“Hey!” James squawked.
“Chatty one, aren’t you?” Draco said.
I seem to like putting Drarry in holiday situations. I blame the tone of the movies. Very Christmas leaning.
“Indeed. Bright and early.” Blaise said. Draco turned his attention to Harry.
Draco was some what sneaking through the hallways to get to his and Harry’s meet up room. He probably wasn’t doing a great job of sneaking though because he was trying to get to the room quickly.
“Stop the car here.” Draco said in a more demanding tone. “Let’s go ice skating.”
“I asked Draco to marry me.” Harry told Ron. Ron stared at him. And kept staring at him. “Ron?”
Mrs. Mcgonagall walked in wearing an elegant dress that was not something Harry thought was meant to be worn just around the house. But the woman did keep busy with her many committees and events. It wasn’t his place to know what the woman did.
“I wish so too. The boys told me all about the snow fight.” Harry said.
“Is that bad?” Harry asked worried.
“Yes. He’s...” Lucius started and tried to think of the right word. “He’s wonderful.”
“I’m sorry, what?” Draco asked somehow even more startled. “You? Don’t deserve me? Don’t be daft, Potter.”
Albus and a red faced Scorpius followed him a little bit away. They then squatted down when Blaise squatted down.
There’s an unofficial tradition for professional Quidditch players and their significant others. There have been revelations and celebrations for some. For others, fights have broken out, reflecting very poorly on the Quidditch player caught in the middle. The fans loved the tradition and when Harry became an official Quidditch player, the fans were excited to see him partake in this tradition. What tradition is this? The wearing of the jersey. Not just any jersey, of course, like the ones sold at games or in Quidditch shops. Actual official player jerseys.
“You don’t recognize me?” The handsome man asked. Remus properly looked at him.
Blaise hailed a taxi and turned to see Draco walking away looking distressed. The jacket the blond had been eyeing was being taken out of the display. Blaise looked at the cabdriver for a second and then back at Draco.
“If you sent me to represent you I would have done it. You didn’t. So I represented you with your husband.” Blaise said cheekily.
Draco quickly walked passed Blaise and left the drawing room to quickly head upstairs. Draco didn’t even hear Harry calling out to him. Harry had just entered the front door when he saw Draco run up the stairs. When he looked in the drawing room he saw Blaise standing next to a Christmas tree.
“That’s very kind of your father.” Blaise said with a smile.
“As long as it’s you proposing in a romantic way then it doesn’t really matter where.” Draco said snootily. “In this case I’d prefer substance over style.”
“To help you.” Blaise said.
“Gone where?” Draco asked curiously.
“No thank you.” Harry said politely but Remus had already set the glasses down.
“Ah. One last push for funds, eh?” Blaise asked. “Tell the boys I’ll see them later. First I have some work to do.”
“It’s been so long since I’ve been on the ice.” Draco said as they were putting their ice skates on. Blaise helped Draco with his laces and then offered him a hand up but didn’t release his hand as they walked to the ponds edge.
“Wait, were you up front?” Harry asked startled.
“After that last comment? No. I have arithmancy.” Draco said shuffling to the door with Harry still attached to him.
“The children are.” Luna said.
“I love it.” Draco said as he pulled Harry back down for more kissing.
“It’s late.” Was the first thing he said when he exited his office.
“I should go.” Harry said gruffly, staring at Draco’s lips.
“James and Al were stupid.” Scorpius said with a shrug. Mr. Potter just let out a sigh.
“You want to earn it on your own.” Harry said. The blond nodded. “I know. That’s why I left it up to you. If you wanted you could sell it for my autograph alone. Just void the cheque first.” He smiled when Draco chuckled.
He glanced up and put the sheet music back in the box after giving it a once over. He made sure to lock the box once more. He quickly walked over to the harp, sat in the seat, pulling the harp to him and starting to strum.
“I’m crazy about it.” Draco said.
“I’ll be right back.” Lily said and disappeared. Narcissa waited patiently and smiled at the annoyed look on the red head’s face when she returned. “I can plead innocent for killing my husband for his annoyance, right?”
Best. Idea. Ever.
“Zabini.” Harry said darkly. Draco just held him more tightly as he read the paragraph. He couldn’t help it and laughed.
“You might as well go home now.” Harry said staring down at his crowded desk.
They were in the room they made to get away from the world just to be together. They were shirtless and rolling around on the bed that was on the luxurious side, thanks to Draco’s talent with transfiguration.
“I know. Your soup will keep warm. You asked for help.” The man said. Harry stared at him wide eyed.
“You know... that’s actually not that surprising when you think about it.” Ron said slowly. “Wait! Is that why you were pissed this morning? Because of Zabini’s PDA.”

Harry rushed over and opened the door. There was no one there. Harry looked up the stairs as he heard footsteps. Draco headed down.

“I like that you’re inelegant. Makes it easier to hear you coming.” Draco said as he sat up and stared at all the presents. “You know, you keep giving me all these gifts. I don’t know if I can reciprocate.”
“Are you saying you’re getting too much?” Harry asked with a raised eyebrow.
“Ahh remember that we are even interested in the lowliest sparrow.” Blaise said.
“Boys.” Hermione said when Ron retaliated.
“That a girl.” Blaise said cheekily earning a small laugh. “Just go out and greet them in your usual warm hearted manner.” Blaise encouraged as he guided her to the door, the butler walking in to announce Harry and Draco’s arrival.
—————————-
When they broke apart for air, Draco was clinging to Harry. He wasn’t sure if he was off balance because his legs had turned to jelly or because he was dizzy from lack of air. He gasped when Harry shifted. Apparently he was also very aroused. So he could be dizzy from that. He tried to shift away but Harry just grabbed his arse and pressed against him. Draco moaned lowly at the answering hardness against his thigh.
Harry was full of confidence and had molded himself to be as cool as a cucumber over the years of being a Quidditch star. Emotions made him act like a fool. Specifically romantic and sexual emotions. Malfoy definitely picked up on it considering he had been around Harry daily for a few months. Harry was glad Malfoy kept it professional but now he was extremely conscious of how much the blond actually had to touch him.
“You know Santa doesn’t look like that.” Blaise said.
“I’m leaving.” Draco said. Harry hugged him from behind.
“What does it look like?” Draco asked a little annoyed at losing his train of thought and being called a nerd.
“That’s the Black side of me.” Narcissa said as she ran her hand up and down his arm. She caught herself as Lucius leaned against her more with a groan.
“Oh, I see. James Potter.” Narcissa said and laughed at the pained look on Lucius’s face. “I’m glad you’re heterosexual otherwise I’d worry you’d be like our son with certain Potters.”
“Draco.” Severus said with a hint of warmth in his tone.
“Oh, yes, that too.” Lucius said. At the glare he received he said, “I don’t care that Lily is muggleborn.”
“Just felt like having a chat.” Narcissa said lightly getting a suspicious look.
“You know what? Let him stay there. I need to have a chat with his father. It will involve a lot of yelling. And me hexing his arse.” Lily said. Narcissa nodded in understanding.
“Are you nervous, love?” Draco asked worriedly.
“I may have needed some help.” Harry said while looking off to the side.
“James’ is a jerk!” Albus said. Draco’s tense shoulders relaxed.
“Whatever you say, dear husband. I have an engagement party to plan for.” Narcissa said as she left the study.
“Thanks for saying you’d help me get a date with him but I’m good on that.” Harry said. Ron’s eyebrows shot up in surprise.
“I... I understand. Even if that annoys me.” Harry said with a flash of irritation. “Just, please don’t hurt him.”
“You’ve been very obvious, Harry.” Hermione said patting his arm. “It doesn’t upset me. Besides, I don’t believe he’s dating Zabini.”
“It must be the new varnish.” The butler said.
“You do?” Blaise asked surprised.
“Scorpius.” His father said happily as he walked toward him. Scorpius was a little surprised to see him looking slightly disheveled, as if he had just rolled out of bed. Mr. Potter appeared behind them, wearing the clothes that he had on yesterday.
“Mrs. McGonagall, this is a place that is meant to garner peace for the people.” Harry pointed out. “Having your husband be the main focal point tells people ‘this is for the wealthy and well off.’”
“I’m going to trust my mother when it comes to being fashionable more than you.” Draco said. Harry pouted.
They walked out of the small room that they had been waiting in, Harry holding the door open for them. Harry looked back into the room as if he was looking for answers to this bizarre situation. Draco stared perplexed as Mrs. McGonagall looped her arm through his to walk with him to the drawing room.
“I understand but... Yes, I get that... But... Alright. I’ll come to the board meeting tomorrow at 11.” Harry confirmed tiredly on the phone in his office.
“I was going to say perfect but that works.” Narcissa said while side eyeing her husband.
“Mind if I join you?” Blaise asked. He was at the local park outside the city, which was a winter wonderland. There were plenty of children out enjoying the day, judging from all the happy yelling and screaming.
Thanks for reading!
“What do you intend to do today?” Harry asked suspiciously.
“Fugitive, Potter?” Draco asked as Harry hid his blushing face in the pillow and groaned.
“Do yours?” Harry asked. Draco shrugged a shoulder.
“No.” Draco said quietly and then stronger said, “you must leave. You have to go now. Never come back.”
“Of course.” Severus said sounding bored as he walked out to the tree in question leaving Draco and Remus alone.
———————————-
“Out? And do what?” Draco asked curiously.
“Harry is grounded! James told me he made that clear to our son!” Lily ranted. “Apparently not clear enough! Since James is conveniently out with the boys and my son, and his supposedly under lock and key, broom are gone!” She panted and then pitched her voice low in a mockery of James’, “These lock charms are impervious, love.”
Draco was standing in the drawing room with Luna, who was fluffing the tinsel in the tree. He had just returned home and immediately went to see what was giving off a glow from the drawing room. Luna had taken his coat and jacket and explained that Blaise had decorated the tree. She said that she had gone to speak to the children and when she came back it was decorated.
“You’re taking this a whole lot better than I thought you would.” Harry said.
“Good evening.” The man said.
“You make me happy.” Draco said making Harry feel all warm and tingly. “This, just makes me want to...”
“Dumb dare mixed with science?” Harry asked.
“How about a massage?” Harry asked.
Draco had checked in on the boys, satisfied they were all asleep he headed to his room. He checked on Lily in her crib, the little baby fast asleep. Draco couldn’t help it so he leaned down and gently kissed her head. Draco stood up quickly when Harry rushed in saying his name.
“Our allotted time for being away is up.” Draco pointed out. He stopped teasing when he saw the wild look in Harry’s eyes.
As uncomfortable as a place like this would be for Harry, the appreciation and approval from his blond made it more bearable. Harry had decided to take Draco to the poshest, fanciest, and most exclusive restaurant wizarding England had to offer. He had wanted to take him to a posh, fancy, exclusive restaurant in France but they were stricter with their reservations. Also his name wasn’t as impressive over there.
“My name is Blaise.” Blaise said as he joined her on the couch. “Now tell me about the man who wrote that music.”
“First of all, it’s not that terrible considering.” Hermione said as she handed him the Prophet. It had a picture of him looking awkward and a blurry picture of his hand with his ring on it next to it.
“You haven’t done very much to help it.” Harry snapped back.
“Black.” Lucius said. Narcissa laughed and covered her face when she snorted. “You’re reveling in my pain.”
“Fine. But if anything untoward happens...” Draco said dropping his arms from around Harry.
“Oh. Yes. It just sort of happened.” Draco said relaxing. Blaise patted him on the shoulder as Draco turned back to his notes. “Let me work.”
“The Professor knows me well. University of Vienna.” Blaise said.
“We are friends.” Harry stated.
“I meant we were expecting you to date. But I guess you two already did that.” Blaise said.
“I wasn’t aware Harry was visiting.” Lucius said taking her hand and lifting it up to kiss it.
“Harry, love.” Draco said getting Harry to look at him. “You can’t kill my best friend.”
“Oh, Draco? What about him?” Remus asked perplexed.
——————-
Harry reached forward and shook the tree lightly. Besides rustling from the animated dragon and soft clinking of the few ornaments another rustling came from the tree. A small wooden box fell out of the bottom with a small thunk. He grabbed it before Draco could and turned to face the blond properly.
Harry stood in the very extravagantly furnished East Drawing Room in the McGonagall stately mansion. It wasn’t the first time he’d been to the mansion, of course, but this was the first time he didn’t take any notice of the room he was in. He was too busy thinking of that man with his husband.
“I hurt you,” Harry said.
“Yes, he does, doesn’t he?”
“I’m fond of her because she’s clearly off her rockers and because you are disgustingly in love with her,” Draco replied.
“Not the time or place for making out, Harry,” Draco warned.
“The man who brought me to that forest. I thought I loved him,” Draco replied. He looked into Potter’s eyes again. “I’m pretty sure I died there.”
Harry shook his head. “No. It’s not Blaise.”
Harry nearly chocked on his sip of coffee. Draco had delivered that compliment in such a serious and grievous tone he knew that Draco meant it.
Blaise just looked at him. And then looked some more. The silence was nearly unbearable. “What about Granger and Weasley or hell anyone else. Longbottom even.“
“You have anything to eat?“
“Fine,” Draco said.
“No. You will be my first. As strange as it sounds, I’m glad it will be you.”
Draco interlocked his fingers on the mahogany top of his desk and studied Potter. He had seen Potter here and there. On the streets sometimes, they ran into each other at parties and functions, but he hadn't been alone with Potter in a room in a very long time, they hadn’t spoken to each other in ten years if you didn’t count a curt hello. Of course, Draco had noticed that Potter had grown up. But that had happened to all of them.
“Well, there are months upon months where no one knew where you were. I mean, you were with Granger and Weasley. Granger is quite good looking. I wouldn’t touch Weasley with a ten-foot pole.”
He kind of hated that tone, it usually meant she was pretty sure what he was doing or even knew something he hadn’t figured out for himself yet.
“You could write on it,” Harry said.
Harry laughed. It burst out of him, because holy hell, what was Malfoy thinking? “No, can’t say that it crossed my mind. Me being the hero who defeated Voldemort and all.”
“So, did you do me?” Harry asked. He couldn’t remember. Hadn’t ever thought about having a dick up his ass, but he wanted Draco to fill him out. Wanted Draco to crawl into all the spaces that were empty. He looked at Antoine. Maybe it wasn’t only Draco he wanted in those spaces.
“I genuinely think that we were all kids, and didn’t always make the best decisions,” Harry said. He had been thinking about it all in the ten years since. “Ron, Hermione and I were such righteous shits.”
“You know him well,” Harry said.
“I think you like that about me,” Draco answered and leaned into the barrier. “Want to feel the heat of my cock touching yours as well?”
Draco smiled at him. “Even the broom closet. I think I might love to suck you off in that dark tight space.”
“Blaise said that secrets between us never ended well,” Draco replied.
“No,” Draco said, gently. “I don’t doubt you for a second, Harry.”
Draco nodded. Of course, Blaise had his back. Blaise was the reason, Draco was even here right now, holding Harry’s hand in public. Not that anyone was around just yet, but that would change.
“I know,” Draco replied, he grabbed Harry by the neck and pulled him down, so they could kiss.
Harry shook his head. It wasn’t as big a shock as he had thought it should be. There had been signs after all. “But I figured he was interested in your rescue on a personal level.”
Blaise looked at him. “Would you go back to the place where people have been murdered? I don’t see you living in Godric’s Hollow.”
“That’s how I beat Voldemort, Astra. It’s a trademark by now.”
“But you think Belladonna is a man,” Harry said. “Why?”
Of course once they were in, they would use the invisibility cloak, but it would still be risky. So it was important to know as much as possible about the building and the comings and goings there.
“Probably, but I wonder sometimes if things enfolded as they did because Dumbledore was really good at scheming. If my parents had to die for people to believe that I was the Chosen One, for Voldemort to believe and fear it.”
“Did you ever wish you didn’t take the mark? Didn’t help get Death Eaters into the school? Didn’t—"
Blaise winked at him when Draco wasn’t looking. He should probably meet up with Blaise soon, have a beer, catch up, entertain thoughts of retribution.
“Merlin, I don’t know Potter? Everything that could be helpful in this investigation? I know that the Ministry doesn’t trust me-“
He was pretty sure that tonight was going to be the night Draco would tell Harry to fuck him. Draco opened his eyes and smiled at Harry lazily. “You want to fuck me, Harry?”
“How can you be so sure?” Harry wanted to know.
“Good.”
Harry nodded. He was nervous and excited. He trusted Draco not to hurt him – in more ways than one. He got up and took off his clothes until he was naked in front of Draco. Draco pulled him against his body and kissed him gently. “You can say no, anytime.”
Draco groaned. “I need to do a better job of wearing you out next time then.”
“It won’t be easy.”
Harry nodded. He came to the realization that he liked spending time with Draco and Blaise as much as he liked spending time with Neville, Luna, Hermione or Ron, but there was something about the time he and Draco spent alone that was different, that somehow weighed more.
“I can contact someone from home to consult on your curse problem. I bet you don’t want anyone from around here,” Ivan said.
He had realized that he probably never loved his father, not like a child should have. He craved the recognition and approval, but had known deep down that his father had seen him as an heir to his own achievements, so they could live on. He had never seen Draco.
A shiver ran down Harry’s spine. He liked it, he discovered, when Draco called him ‘Auror Potter’, especially while he was naked. “You should be naked too,” Harry said.
“But – Draco wasn't a vampire. Back in school when I knew him.” But did he, Harry wondered now. Did he really know Draco? If he had to be honest with himself he had to say no. He hadn't known Draco at all and he hadn't really cared to know him either.
“We had reasons,“ Draco said eventually.
“Auror Thompson,” the bulky man beside Potter cut in.
“I would hate muggle London,” Draco said. But Blaise was right, he would do it. For Harry.
“Because,“ she replied, “for some reason Mr. Potter took to you like a duckling to water, Mr. Malfoy.“ She rubbed the bridge of her nose. “He is safe here as long as he stays in Hogwarts, but as you should know by now: Mr. Potter had lost all memories of being a wizard or the wizarding world. It doesn’t mean he isn’t a wizard, it just means that he has to learn everything from scratch and you, Mr. Malfoy will help him do it.“
Not for them of course, but for anyone who would want to stand in their way.
“Draco,” Luna said with a sigh.
“Potter!” Draco said sharply.
“I guess it is. It has no other use than to make a child happy,” Draco replied.
“I think,” Pansy said, “Ivar is a version of you and Basil is a version of Potter.” She put the parchment on the coffee table and looked at him.
“Do you really want to know the answers to those questions Harry?”
“It’s a Glamour,” Draco answered.
“You just do whatever you want, don’t you? Come hell or high water.”
“You’d marry me just so you can fuck me?” Draco asked.
“Then you decided to go back to England,” Harry started, because he was still trying to put the pieces together. “Did you know about your new powers by then?”
“We're hooking up,” Draco said, because they were. Not in the traditional sense where they could touch each other, but the magic barrier he made the first time had come in handy again. And again and again, over the last few weeks. There had been no new victim, for which both Harry and Draco were thankful, and in the meantime Draco was remembering bits and pieces from that night; faces, wands, and other details that could help identify the people who had been there. He had been sketching pretty much every free second he got and handing the sketches and drawings to Potter, Henri, and Bears.
It seemed like Potter wanted to say something else, but his phone rang and he excused himself.
If anything, Harry thought, Draco being a vampire made him stronger. Made his magic stronger. But it was true, it felt different, a vampire-wizard's magic.
“Who?” Potter asked softly.
“Yes, but she is also hoping to be the next candidate for Mrs. Potter,” Draco said.
“Have you?”
The kiss left Harry hard and breathless. “Why is it that I always get hard like a teenager who has never been kissed before when I kiss one of you?”
Harry smiled. “Did you leave me at least half of it?”
“You think he wanted to hurt me?”
“Don’t worry, I am not. You might be.”
“It has wings and you did well,” Draco said. “Next time just make the corners a bit sharper.”
“Blaise wants to buy the manor,” Draco said two weeks later. The book was finished, the revisions were done and it was being edited right now. Draco and Pansy had finally agreed on a cover and Draco was probably feeling the pressure of the release date. Which was two months from now.
“Draco Malfoy,” Draco said and took that offered hand. It was warm and firm and bigger than Draco’s.
Draco gave him a look. “She wasn’t exactly pleased with me or Blaise or you.”
“Harry, how lovely to hear from you again,” Luna said.
Harry nodded, the boy grabbed his wrist and dragged him gently out of the club. The night air hit Harry like a bucket of cold water. They were behind the club and they were alone, the boy was crowding Harry against the wall. He refused to panic.
“It’s called growing up, Potter,” Draco said. He looked at Harry, a smile curving his lips. It made him look dangerous and inviting at the same time. “Or maybe you’re just noticing all these things about me now because you want me so badly.”
She shook her head. “I’m afraid not, but I might be able to break the curse anyway.”
“You came back,” Draco said, stepping into the living room and then falling into one of the mismatched chairs. Antoine was hovering nearby like he didn’t know what to do with himself. It was so unlike him, Harry thought. He would have to talk to Antoine later too.
“I know,” Harry said, because he did know that. He had no idea what would happen afterward, but he knew as much. They would get Draco out of there.
“What do you call this?” Draco asked, but now he didn’t seem so hostile anymore. He seemed a bit amused.
“What do you intend to do?”
Harry kissed him. “I think we already are. We are terrifying and invincible together, Draco.”
“Well, I don’t think you did it Harry. I mean you helped some of them to get free or get a reduced sentence. You spoke up for Goyle at his trial.”
“I’m appreciating,” Draco answered.
“As I'm a wizard and everything,” Harry said.
Draco shrugged. “I don’t really care, but I do want to touch you, and I want you to touch me.”
“I guess it would be useless to ask if it does look familiar?” Antoine wanted to know.
“Yes, see you soon, Potter,” Draco replied.
Luna was waiting for him at the stairs with a mug of hot tea and a black cat. He took the mug gratefully but couldn’t make himself drink the tea.
Harry blinked up at him. “Are you going to fuck or torture me?”
“And you trust me? Why?”
Draco knew that Blaise had a point. It seemed Harry hated secrets, hated being lied to, too. Draco could understand, after all they had both been manipulated from a young age by the gown ups in their lives.
“I am a predator, Harry,” Antoine replied.
Draco laid down next to him. “Yeah?”
“You could out yourself,” Blaise said.
“Well, lucky you to be born into a nice and sane family,” Luna said, and Harry smiled at her. She didn’t say much, but when she did it had impact.
“Who can we trust then?” Draco asked.
“Yes, but it’s in the past now.”
“I rather like Draco,” Potter said.
Draco could feel a headache coming, probably because he hadn’t slept like a real person for days and hadn’t eaten like one either.
~One~
Malfoy smiled. It was a tiny, thin thing. “I know.”
Harry just looked at him. “The writer?”
“You really shouldn’t be telling me this,” Potter said.
Draco looked at him. “You think the ritual is unfinished somehow, that is why I am the way I am.”
“It is hot then?”
“Yes, but there weren’t any traces of defensive spells on it,” Blaise replied. “You can check for yourself. I haven’t done anything to it. Kept it sealed in fact.”
“Don’t you have work or something?” Draco asked. His eyes wandered to Potter’s hands holding the book.
“I assumed as much, you two being Aurors and all,” Draco replied.
“I bet not all of your colleagues think that way.”
“You didn’t really think we were done yet, did you?” Draco asked.
“Scared Draco?” Harry asked.
“None of your business, Auror Bears,” Harry said, sitting down at his desk. “I need a curse expert. A really good one.”
“That look that promises trouble, Harry,” Neville said and then smiled. “I haven’t seen that look on your face since you lost all your memories of being a wizard.”
“Not all of them. Lovegood and Longbottom are still his friends, so are a lot of other people. He is in love. He finally has someone who will never betray him. Who will love him until he dies. Because I know you, you will die by his side, follow him to the ends of the world. Would probably settle with him in muggle London.”
Draco nodded. He would do just that.
Draco nodded. Their fortune had been seized pretty much right away. After the trial he and his mother had spent two years abroad, but the Malfoy name and the things his father had done had followed them like a curse. It had been a shitty few years.
“We?” Harry asked.
“Never do what you are told, do you?” Antoine teased.
Harry liked how it became gradually easier for Draco to call him by his first name. “For your life?”
Draco ran his hands over Harry’s chest, his sides and then cupped his ass. Harry shivered and groaned. It felt so good. Draco slipped a finger into his crease and Harry’s breath hitched.
“You shouldn’t tell me I look awful then, Potter.”
The small owl Harry had rought to Neville, who was a teacher at Hogwarts now, made happy noises as she flew around to get familiar with her new surroundings.
“It really is,” Antoine answered.
It had been such a simple spell for Draco, his mother had taught him that one pretty early on. But for Harry it was of course something he had never seen before.
Draco smiled, and this time it wasn’t a nice smile at all. “Of course. We might be pariahs now, but we won’t be poor pariahs.”
“Blaise and Pansy think it would be best if I took this matter in my own hands. If I came out to the world on my own terms. Blaise thinks Lovegood could help me with that too.”
Potter smiled. “Maybe.”
“Still there. So are the scars, if you’re wondering,” Draco answered.
“Yes, I think so,” Draco replied.
“Yes, you did,” he looked at Harry then. “Did he tell you that he was the one who made me?”
The heart in Vision No. 33 had been bothering Draco a lot lately. Before he and Potter started whatever they were doing, he had thought the heart was a symbol for the next victim. Now he wasn't so sure. Maybe it was his heart on the line now, or even Potter’s.
Draco nodded. “Yes.”
“I didn’t have any coffee yet,” Potter said and proceeded to stalk over to the coffee pot, Draco grabbed his arm hard and pushed him against the nearest sturdy furniture, which happened to be the table. His teacup and cutlery made unhappy noises, but Draco ignored it in favor of pinning Potter down. He liked pinning Potter down and it turned out that it got Potter going when he was being pinned down. Not now of course.
Hermione exchanged a look with her husband. “You were right back then. But what is this about? So Malfoy claimed his family home, so what?”
Draco laughed. “I acted…like the little princeling I had been raised to believe I was. And look at me now? Barely a Knut to my name. My mother had to sell pretty much everything we had so I could finish my education. Everything that hadn’t been seized by the Ministry of Magic.”
She nodded; her face grim. “Yes, something is going on with the boy and his magic. It seems it’s been siphoned away. The mark can’t be removed by any means the healers at St. Mungo’s tried so far. His condition is getting worse.” She rubbed at her temples. “Yes, I know something doesn’t add up and that the Goyle’s condition had been kept a secret from us, by the people who are working on this case is not a good sign, Harry.”  She looked at him then. “I don’t want the kid to die. He already lost his father. We let his father die.”
“As in?”
Harry shook his head. “You could be in danger, Draco. I know you are more powerful than pretty much any other wizard, but most people don’t know that. This person might think you’re hiding because you’re broken.”
“It makes you more you,” Neville answered.
Which was true of course. “People close to you didn’t notice either.”
They watched the facility for another two weeks, in which Harry's thoughts were jumping between Draco inside there and Antoine right here, beside him. Not one of them Harry could touch right now.
“Good. Was just making sure,” Blaise said.
Harry could feel him hot inside him. Draco kissed his jaw sloppily once he finished.
“They will find out, Harry.”
“I hope you have a better solution, because I’m inclined to leave, if all you can come up with is: let Harry Potter handle it.”
“Pansy is not allowed to name anything, not even her own children,” Draco replied and made himself at home in Harry’s lap. Now that the new book was done and had a title it was out of his hands. He would have to fight with Pansy over covers soon, but for now he was done. The voices in his head were gone and he felt hungry for Harry.
Harry got on the bed on his back and spread his legs in invitation. He had used his own fingers a few times, but the angle was never right and the first touch to his rim was always such a shock that he stopped right there more often than not. It felt too good.
“Draco,“ Blaise said gently and put his hand over Draco’s.
“And…the visions?” He wanted to ask about the touching, but he would get there soon enough. The visions were important too.
“We had a thing,” Harry replied. “Didn’t go anywhere, really, but we hooked up a few times.”
Joel had come along and swept him away, and now here they were and Draco knew it was going to be the night. He had some experience, but he had never let anyone fuck him before. He was nervous and excited, and Joel, well...was Joel. He pressed Draco against the car and kissed him breathless and hard, then told him to get in. He had a surprise for Draco, he said.
Draco smiled, he knew it wasn’t a nice smile. “I want to hunt them down myself, but I can’t do that while being confined to my own home.”
“Because he’s part of my life, because he gave me permission to tell you and because he’s going to reveal his true identity at the book signing next week.”
Which would be a terrifying prospect in any other situation, Harry thought, but wasn’t now. So what came out of his mouth was “Do it, do it, do it.”
He had, hadn’t he? He'd let Potter not only into his house, but maybe into his heart as well.
“No,” Antoine hissed.
“Did you ever think that this whole sorting thing was just bullshit? I mean, how can someone be just one thing and none of the others?” Draco asked, partly because he was curious and partly because he wanted to change the topic.
“Doesn’t Henri always know everything?” Pansy asked. Pansy didn’t like Henri much, but Pansy didn’t like anyone much.
“Merlin, you might be right,” Harry said.
“No,” Draco replied. “But I’ve seen it used on others and it had been used on me once.”
“You don’t mind if I get completely naked, do you, Draco?”
Draco’s eyes were like daggers. “Get lost Potter,” he said and then just turned around and started walking.
“I did, but we didn’t know each other well,” Harry said, suddenly realising it was the truth. He had thought he knew Draco Malfoy, but he had had his own version of Draco that had also been influenced by the people he had loved, but he was older now and understood that there were different sides to people.
Harry was on vacation and sending cheerful letters to his friends about all the amazing things he was doing and seeing, and the people he was meeting. Hermione probably thought he was being sarcastic. As long as she didn’t suspect anything, Harry was fine with that.
“Did someone mess with you again?” Harry asked.
“That voice,” Harry said. “Was it a man or a woman?”
With a little help from his not so straight and narrow friends Harry got a list of everyone who had been involved in the medical facility that had held Draco captive and he oblivated them all. It took him less than a week, because Draco was there to help him.
Harry collapsed into the very comfortable armchair in Neville’s study.
“It’s probably better, I want you to feel pleasure and not pain when I fuck you, Harry,” Draco replied.
“And the saliva only works on other people,” Harry said.
Blaise smiled. “Yes, you would.”
Harry had suspected that. It was in the way Draco sometimes got lost in the pleasure he was giving Harry, how he sometimes just stared as Harry was coming apart under his fingers and mouth.
“He sent another owl. Hell made her displeasure known,” Draco replied with a smile. “He’s getting impatient with my silence.”
Draco nodded. “Yes.”
“That’s not the popular opinion,” Draco replied.
“People change,” Harry cut in. He couldn’t tell her that he had always felt drawn to Malfoy, that now he was pretty sure that this was meant to be, because Astra wouldn’t understand it. Hell, he barely understood it. But it was there, and it was real, and it had been in the making since that day at Madame Malkin’s.
“You don’t know him like I do.”
His first book had been like that. A weird mix of imagined Muggle, old magic and wizard tradition, what had made it stand out was that the romance subplot had been about two women. Growing up Draco hadn’t understood the obsession he had with some people, now looking back at it, he knew that he had been crushing on those people. Had been crushing hard on Cedric and well, hell yes, on bloody Potter too.
She grinned at him.
“You mind?” Draco replied.
“I think I will do a bit of both,” Draco replied. “Don’t worry, it’s the fun and sexy kind of torture. And I mastered the art of it.”
“Now you Harry,” Draco said, and Harry looked up from his hands. He fought a blush for some reason and took a piece of paper.
“We will get Draco out, Harry.”
“If you have to know, I didn't trust anyone else with this,” Potter said.
“Will you let me in?” Potter rephrased and smiled, like it was something they did.
“Teach?” He asked once he had his wits back.
“Are there any others?” Harry wanted to know.
“Are you sterile?” she asked.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, sinking down to his knees so he was level with Draco, who was panting now.
Astra shrugged. “It’s only been ten years.”
And who was Draco to tell the boy who lived no?
“Came to the dark side at last,” Draco teased.
“So you became a Gryffindor,” Draco said. He hadn’t even imagined you could argue with the Sorting Hat. He wouldn’t have anyway, because like Potter he too had been biased.
Antoine nodded and they went back to the plan.
Harry nodded. “You want to do this alone.”
“I wanted to see you, and Luna might or might not have dropped a hint about your new painting,” Potter answered. “But really the painting thing was just an excuse. It seems I didn’t need it because you let me in.”
Draco grinned like he just read Harry’s mind, but didn’t comment on it, as he continued, “But I want to be able to leave my house at my own free will and I want to kiss you senseless in a crowded restaurant, so everyone knows that you are mine now.”
“The prophetic ones?”
“Want to touch me that badly?”
Draco made a dismayed sound. “Why are you talking?”
Draco knew he should say no, but he nodded instead. These days he didn’t have much company except for Luna and Pansy, and despite everything, he had enjoyed talking to Potter.
“Well, good to know,” Ivan said. “I can work with that, but you need to let me in, Harry.”
Draco smiled. “Our empire?”
“I do wonder sometimes what would have happened if you had taken my hand that first time we met when we were eleven,” Draco added.
“I wore him out,” Draco replied. He could feel her displeasure about the situation, but she didn’t say anything. Draco hated that she was here, that anyone was here with them, really. He put tea leaves in the kettle and turned around to look at her while the water boiled. “He is never going to be yours,” he stated.
looking for you. It was only natural to pool our resources.”
Harry nodded, realizing something else in that moment: Blaise and Draco had been together at one point and Blaise still had strong feelings for Draco. He believed Blaise that he would end Harry if Harry hurt Draco. He also believed that Blaise would get away with it.
“Harry,” Antoine said gently.
“No, not hurt, but drink your blood? Yes, I am sure of it,” Antoine answered.
“So, how is Harry?” Blaise asked, out of nowhere. Draco should have seen it coming, really.
“Yes, thank you,” she answered.
“The critiques will tear me apart,” Draco said.
“They might start to speculate on our sex life too, Harry,” Draco warned. The connection from writing to real life was just too easy to make for some people after all. Especially if they wanted to cause drama or wanted exposure.
Harry grinned, fighting the impulse to lean into Draco and stepping away instead while taking a deep calming breath.
“No one knows. Their minds are blank. His wife and son had seen it happen. They were also marked. Which is a new one,” Astra said and showed him photographs.
“And then he just vanished for three years, no trace of him whatsoever," Ivan continued.
“How does one become a vampire?” Harry asked, because there wasn't anything about that in Voyages with Vampires.
“You are very welcome, Draco,” she replied, pouring him more tea.
Draco pointed to the painting. “This is what happened to me. Yes, I am a wizard and more resilient than a Muggle, but this should have killed me.”
“I did in fact do you, Harry. Once, when I slit your chest open and left you with this,” he stroked a finger over the scar on Harry’s chest.
Potter swallowed. Draco was watching him do it, was watching his Adam’s apple, was watching his neck, before he looked up again and into Potter’s cursed green eyes. There was something there, Draco knew that something. It was a spark of interest, with a dash of dangerous recklessness.
Draco kissed him. “Well, to answer your question I will not kick you to the curb. I could have just ignored your offer of well, yourself,” he said. “I could have ignored it and just called the Club and arranged a playdate for myself, Potter, but I didn’t. I took you up on that offer, because I wanted you and because I knew that you wanted me too.”
James laughed. “Oh yeah! Well, he’s –”
what I mean.”
The owl gave a hoot as if it agreed with his statement, but Draco thought that ‘majestic’ was a far cry from what it actually was. The thing was a ball of fluff, so small it could probably fit in the palm of Draco’s hand. He doubted it was even strong enough to carry a letter, let alone anything else.
Draco stepped across the threshold and found himself in a narrow hallway. He opened his mouth to comment on the absence of the troll leg umbrella stand he remembered from his last visit, but Potter hurriedly hushed him. He gestured wildly and Draco got the gist that he was to remain silent and follow Potter. Compliantly he did so, and Potter led him to the first floor where they entered what looked like a sitting room. Only after he had shut the door firmly behind him, did Potter finally let out the breath that he’d been holding.
Draco made sure his face was completely neutral when he turned to face him. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.” he said, and if he said so himself, he was playing the clueless innocent like a pro.
,” George said in hushed voice.
“We’re over here Dad.” James yelled, so loudly he put a
“Calm down,” he says soothingly and places a gentle kiss on Draco’s quivering lips. “I’ll just go check the fuse box. Do you want to come with me?”
“The things I do for you, Ginevra.”
“Yes Mother?” he asked her innocently now. “Is something the matter?”
“What you did to me?” Potter tilted his head and his forehead furrowed. “You didn’t do anything.”
Pansy’s eyebrows disappeared into her fringe. “That is most certainly a move.”
“Plus, he won’t shut up about you,” Weasley added, silent until now. “It’s like sixth year all over again.”
“Not proud perse,” Draco admitted. “But I don’t see what all the fuss is about. Potter didn’t seem to mind.”
“Act natural!” he hissed at the still smiling Bob and then looked around frantically, wondering for a mad second if he could hide. Finally getting a good look at the shop he realised that he’d dashed into Eeylop’s Owl Emporium in his haste to avoid Potter. He wasn’t sure why he was avoiding him in the first place but considering their somewhat unpleasant encounter the night before, he was sure it was for the best.
Blimpy cleared his throat pointedly. “Mistress says that if Master Draco is finished attacking Mr Potter, you both is to join her for tea.”
“Wait, so let me get this straight,” Ginny finally spoke up, shaking her head vigorously as if water had gotten in to her ears. “You thought. Harry and I. Were dating.
his cryptic behaviour made sense. It seemed Potter’s hero complex extended to exonerated mini Death Eaters as well.
“And I suppose this is why you haven’t been around these days?” Potter continued with a frown. “You somehow think this is your fault?” Draco nodded jerkily and everything began to spill out at once.
George nodded. “They got married a few months after Harry. It was splashed all over the papers and it came as a bit of a surprise as we’d thought Parkinson was madly in love with
to happen!” Draco whisper-shouts back at him.
“Uh oh. She’s gonna start crying.” James put in, rather unnecessarily in Draco’s opinion.
“What in Merlin’s name just happened?” Weasley asked in a faint voice.
When they were both standing on the porch, Draco turned to Potter. “I had a wonderful time today.” he said somewhat awkward. No matter how much time they spent together, the goodbyes always ended up stilted and awkward “And again, thank you for dinner.”
“Fine!”
Potter blinked a few times, and when his eyes finally focused on Draco, his whole face lit up. “You’re here!”
They stay like that for a long time, but eventually Harry feels Draco pulling back so he backs away a little, allowing him more room. Draco settles against the wall again and wipes at his cheeks, no longer crying but his eyes remain red and moist. He then reaches to take Harry’s face in his hands and leans in to place a trembling kiss on Harry’s lips, and it is so tender that Harry can’t help letting out a small whimper.
“What are you all talking about?” Percy asked as he came up to them, and then stared in confusion as Ginny and Charlie hurriedly said “Nothing!” while the rest studiously looked anywhere but at him.
Harry looked even less convinced now. “Draco, something is very wrong here.” He took a step closer and Draco took two steps back. “Why won’t you let me touch you?”
“Why did you leave in the first place?” Potter’s next question was, and Draco considered how best to answer.
Draco shut his mouth with an audible click. Harry looked like a man possessed and would likely go through with any threats he made now.
“Oh. I guess I’ll see you tomorrow then.”
Draco! Merlin’s fucking balls, are you alright?”
He flung a spoonful of his sundae at Potter’s grinning face.
Potter gave him a sardonic look. “I’m not lying though. It really was planning on Sorting me with you lot. I just asked it not to.”
“You too, Charlie. Tell Ginny I had a wonderful time and that I have her to thank for it.”
Six years and Harry still wouldn’t let it go.
“You should come for the Easter party on Saturday.” he said in voice devoid of emotion, and what Draco wouldn’t do to get the warmth back into his voice. “The children would love it if you came.”
Oblivious to his inner turmoil Mrs Spencer prattled on, “It was dreadfully elite wasn’t it?”
Draco’s mouth fell open. In all his life, he’d never seen his mother cook. They had house elves for that, she’d say and truth be told, he sometimes wondered if she’d ever set foot in the Manor kitchen.
