‘It’s okay… I’m here…’ Harry sat down next to Draco and placed a hand in the small of Draco’s back. ‘Just tell me what you need, okay?’
“No! No, not yet... it’s just...” She glanced outside the window, where Harry and Molly were once again attacking the garden gnomes with all their might and lowered her voice. “Arthur and Molly had a fight over it.”
“I don’t think that is what you really want,” Draco countered as gently as he could. “You love Sirius.”
‘I’d be willing to do that,’ Harry offered, ‘if you are okay with that too, Draco? And we’ll have to ask Molly for permission, of course.’
Harry took the lead, and Draco tiredly trailed behind. When they were close enough, both Alpha and Omega paused to look at the company gathered: Remus, Hermione, and a woman Draco did not recognise, but, by the look in her eyes as she took in Draco, knew Draco somehow. Maybe she had been in his parents’ circles.
‘It’s less scary than the lift.’ Harry dragged him along and stepped onto the staircase. Draco stayed close, like Harry had told him to, but felt a bit awkward when he noticed that some people were staring at them.
Draco looked at Adelaide, whose eyes were huge in surprise. She bent towards Draco, ‘an intimate courtship means that while you formally court, you are also together... intimately.’ It was a mere whisper, but judging by the way Mrs Weasley and Harry both tensed up, they’d heard it.
“The labour-alarm tripped at Sunny Springs. Healer Roberts believes you’re going into labour.” Hermione’s tone was low and supposed to be soothing, but it was a weak imitation of Harry’s low, soothing tones, and did nothing for Draco.
“So, uhm, anyway,” Draco awkwardly started, “Harry and I need to talk about it and I feel like we need a mediator.” He looked away, mumbling, “we need you.”
Draco reluctantly moved away from her to pick up the book he’d been reading, “A pregnancy guide” and dropped it, opened, on her lap. He’d burrowed it from Adelaide, because Crossroads hadn’t carried the sort of thing he was looking for.
“Just give me a scoop of those,” Draco decided. He turned back towards the woman to ask her about the newspaper and suddenly found himself face to face with...
‘Molly told me that you wanted to talk to me about some things, and that I was supposed to come in official capacity,’ Hermione immediately tackled her reason for being at the Burrow. ‘So what did you want to talk about?’
She smiled at him and took the paper away from him. Breakfast went by undisturbed after their conversation. The same maid that had woken him this morning cleaned up after them.
Draco thought about how wonderful the last four weeks had been while he packed a suitcase for him and Harry. Tomorrow morning, they would leave for the private fertility clinic in Edinburgh. Harry hadn’t wanted to go to St Mungo’s because of the negative experiences he’d had there and Draco had readily agreed. St Mungo’s hadn’t seemed particularly attractive to him anyway.
I'm still very grateful that you all still want to read my story, it makes me feel so happy to see that so many people read it and like it!
Draco shrugged. Saying he missed Harry was out of the question, it would make him look pathetic. Actually, he wasn’t
The dark hideout was lit up by spellfire in all colours, red, purple, yellow and orange from Harry’s coworkers, green, black and blue from the other side. It was chaotic, and Draco could not tell who was duelling who - or if that was even what he was supposed to be seeing.
(We're taking a little break from investigating the cases and moving over to the improvement of the relationship between Draco and Harry. Next chapter, we'll continue on the cases)
After wandering around to prevent himself from looking too suspicious, (because even though he felt welcome, he didn’t want to bolt into the Omega section right away), Draco carefully set foot in the ‘Omega’ section of the bookstore. It was currently an empty aisle, which made him feel more comfortable immediately.
Draco stared at the table, determined not to look at Hermione. ‘I don’t – I wanted – I had no idea Harry had been with others.’
– feeling subdued, Draco pressed a slow kiss against Harry’s neck. Harry made a soft noise that Draco recognised as approval so he let his lips travel further, eventually pushing Harry’s shirt aside so he could kiss the indent right below his collar bone. First, Harry made that noise again, but when Draco pressed his body closer against Harry’s, Harry stepped out of the embrace in one smooth motion.
As he dressed, Mr Potter scribbled more things down on his clipboard. When he looked up, Draco was properly dressed again. He offered Mr Potter one of his special, submissive smiles, the one where he would smile, allow his gaze to linger a little, as if he wanted to submit to Mr Potter.
It took Draco a few days to recover. Part of his recovery process were constant cuddles, attentive compliments, tons and tons of food and general pampering.
‘Is she your family?’ Draco questioned, because this was a subject that they hadn’t spoken about much at all. He knew that Harry was orphaned at a young age, but that was about it.
Draco had heard about Ron and Ginny before, he knew that they were two of the seven Weasley children, but had never met them. ‘If they are your family, I’d love to meet them.’
“No,” Harry said firmly, “no protesting. I agree that preparing a little is a good idea – I wouldn’t want you to experience nest-panic – but there is no need to panic about this now. We have time, we’re only doing this when you’re ready for it.”
Mrs Weasley smiled briefly, ‘yes, of course, Hermione had owled me she would visit for that.’ She was brought her wand back up, as if to continue her work, and then back down again. ‘Did you want me to come downstairs with you?’ She eyed him cautiously.
“We quickly realised that Riddle had escaped his cell - he had bribed a guard into polyjuice into him, and swapped them.”
“I’m not saying you need to mate with her,” Draco said with a sigh. “I’m saying… she cares for you. It’s okay to let someone care about you.” He waited a beat before adding, “it’s okay to enjoy it when someone cares for you.”
“Seems like your babies decided to come a little early,” she said, foregoing any formal greeting as she took her place next to Draco’s bed. “How are the contractions?”
Draco placed the tea set in front of her and sat down next to her. “I still can’t believe you chose Alexander over David.” He stretched his arms out and took Alexander from her, carefully supporting his little head and holding him close.
On day five, however, he awoke before she had come in his room to wake him up (as she had done every day prior). He sat up and looked around. The room wasn’t really big, but it was cosy. It was a bit cluttered and the wardrobe didn’t quite close, he noticed, but it smelled nice and Alpha-y, combined with something else he couldn’t quite make out. The weird tube-thing was still is his nose and he touched it carefully, wondering what it was and why it was there.
‘Good boy,’ Harry praised him and suddenly Draco couldn’t hold back anymore. He cried out, shuddering when he came. Harry kept on grazing that spot inside him, making Draco gasp for breath and come until he thought he would faint from it.
“She married a muggle, but she was always friendly towards us.” Remus stoppp tapping the table, leaning back and looking out the window, a million miles away. “She harboured us for a few months after we mated. I couldn’t go back to my family and his wasn’t exactly accommodating either. We lost touch after Sirius got arrested.”
“Oh, Merlin, no!” Draco laughed. “I was at the Burrow for a long time, recovering. But of course, I went into an irregular heat, so… Harry helped. After that, he asked for permission to court me. It was pretty awkward at first. I think I once told him he looked like a weird fish.”
In short, a courtship was supposed to last anywhere from three months to one-and-a-half years, depending on what the Alpha and Omega wanted themselves. The couple would go on planned outings regularly to get to know each other better, meet family and friends and see if they would be compatible. It was common to be chaperoned when going on these outings, and usually the Omega would pick the chaperones.
‘It is also a surprise to see you’ve brought another old student of mine with you,’ she said whilst looking at Adelaide.
‘He’s nice. I like him a lot,’ Draco repeated what he had told Astoria a few days ago. It had gotten him somewhere with her so it might work in Neville too.
eyes, Harry, he’s barely surviving. His body has barely healed from a miscarriage that was likely induced by the lack of contact with his mate, he can’t keep his weight on, he’s anemic, he’s weak like this. He doesn’t have to be like this. If we just let him see his mate, he’ll be better.”
Did you notice that this time, Draco came to Harry all by himself? It's a big thing for him to admit he's into Harry, but and even bigger thing to seek his attention/company when he needs it/wants it.
“Harry, Adelaide is my friend, don’t hurt her,” Draco murmured whilst squeezing Harry’s thigh firmly.
“What about that special announcement you promised, ma?” one of the Weasley twins asked - Draco could never tell them apart from each other.
A knee slid in between his legs and Draco spread them eagerly, leaning into his Alpha, pushing his face against Harry’s shoulder. ‘Good boy, good boy…’ Harry moved them a little more, until he more or less lay down, pillows in his back to support him as Draco lay draped across his body. ‘Spread your legs… Yes… like that…’
“I think taking a leave of absence was a great decision, Harry,” Hermione gently interjected. “The whole situation around the abuse and your bonding hasn’t exactly been a walk on the park. You both need time, together.”
he thought and he retreated again to his comfortable window seat, only to hear his mother cry out. ‘NO!’
“We’ll be fine,” Harry promised as he stepped closer. He placed a gentle arm around Draco’s waist and let his hand curl around his hip, making Draco sigh and lean into his mate a little more. “You really think so?”
Harry lifted his hand, wiping away the tears from his eyes roughly. “Yeah.” His voice was heavy with emotion. “I’m just… really happy.” He pressed his lips against Draco’s for a gentle, quick kiss, and lingered close after that. Draco stretched up a little, allowing Harry to bury his head in the crook of his neck. He ran his fingers through Harry’s hair in a soothing gesture, murmuring a low, “me too.”
“What – you didn’t need the book!”  Draco accused when he saw functioning fairy lights strung around the posters of their bed and along the walls.
He leaned into the soft touch, feeling a bit better already. Being touched made him feel better instantly, made him feel as if he wasn’t a failure.
‘Although, I think it’s maybe a bit odd that a lot of the Omegas that enrol here are promised to someone, but the prospected owners all wish to remain anonymous… Normally, they have some wishes, some things they want to see their Omegas trained in. We can only teach those Omegas basis things, not things that are specifically catered towards their prospected owner.’ Blaise looked at Draco and smiled, ‘Draco was one of them, if I remember correctly. Why didn’t you want your identity known?’
Raising his head to find the owner of this voice, Draco found himself eye to eye with a pale, tall man. His skin was so pale that it was almost translucent. He had dark, short hair, and his eyes wear dark blue, carrying a cold depth within them. An objective eye might say that the stranger was attractive - albeit in an unusual way.
Draco hummed again, but remained quiet otherwise, wondering how much information Lupin would volunteer today.
‘Don’t you think that’s a bit crude? She’s probably still heartbroken, you acting this way towards here isn’t going to better the situation,’ Hermione pointed out.
“I’m tired,” Draco complained as he stepped towards the bath. It was filled with hot water and he hissed as he stepped into it, holding onto Harry’s hand for support.
The memory faded and Hermione pulled Draco back up again. ‘The next one you’ll go in alone, okay?’ she asked.
“I think she’s out in the garden. We’ve got gnomes,” Adelaide told him as she sat down. He could hear the shifting of clothing and then the soft, familiar sounds of her trying to make the baby burp. “Come on Alexander,” she murmured, and when he burped, cooing, “there’s my good boy, such a cutie…”
Harry remained quiet for a while, but then batted Draco’s hand away from his groin. ‘Fine. On the bed. On your back. Be good now, or I won’t do anything to you.’
Harry placed his hand on Draco’s back, gently stroking downwards towards his arse. ‘I know, but it’s just not possible to keep in all in. It won’t do anything for you or your body – ’ meaning that doing this wouldn’t make him pregnant ‘ – and there will be another heat soon enough. So come on. We’ll take a shower and get you dressed before Arthur and Molly come back.’
With Draco’s heat over again, Harry brought him back to the Burrow. He spoke to Mrs Weasley about not being able to visit for a week or two. Draco stepped away from Harry as soon as they arrived, standing next to Mrs Weasley now, his safe haven.
Mr Potter had been right. A cold bath had calmed him for as long as the water was colder than he was. They’d – well, Mr Potter had – refreshed the water twice before it wasn’t enough anymore.
Not finding what he was looking for, he finished with a murmur, barely audible. “Even with a successful pregnancy, permanent deformation can only rarely be prevented.”
Draco stood up and extended his hand towards Remus. “Come on. We’ll write out requests in the kitchen and send them out immediately.”
. At least she had finished the job they’d brought her. The overall tone of it was friendly, but somehow Draco doubted that she had even tried to help Remus. He placed the letter back in the center of the paper it had come in, and took out the other piece of paper, thinking that its contents could not possibly improve the situation. It was a contract. The letters all danced in front of his eyes, and he closed them for a minute to help regain his focus. Upon opening them again, he searched for the gender clause in the contract. It was a well-known clause that was added to many contracts - it limited Omegas from being able to sign contracts without their Alpha’s permission. This contract did not have a gender clause. Had they forgotten to add it? Or had Hermione helped them out after all?
Harry remained ruthless, though, digging his fingernails deeper into Draco’s hips and pulling his mate into a position that under other circumstances would have been uncomfortable. Now, the Omega complied easily, eager to obey. Even more so, Draco placed his hands over Harry’s, keeping them in place, afraid he wouldn’t be able to continue standing upright without Harry’s support as the alpha worked to get his knot inside. Draco’s head lulled further back, against Harry’s shoulder.
He was wrong however, and within seconds he was being crushed against the body of his Alpha. “Ahh… I missed you,” Harry said and he kissed Draco’s neck.
‘I said no.’ It sounded firm but not angry and Draco soon forgot his protests. Mr Potter used a fresh towel to dry and clean Draco’s arse thoroughly. Draco moaned as the rough material rubbed over his hole and leaned into his Alpha heavily. ‘Shit, Draco, christ…’
‘I’d love to join you,’ Adelaide interrupted. ‘Thank you for asking. It’ll have to be something that is pregnancy-friendly though.’
It turned out Mr Potter wanted to see him as well. He wanted to come over that same afternoon, to which Mrs Weasley had agreed.
Harry hoisted up Draco’s legs over his shoulders. ‘Sweet Merlin,’ he whispered, ‘look at you, Draco still stretched and open, so ready…’
“Six in the morning.” Harry yawned and stretched. Draco jealously watched him make the motion, and stubbornly stretched his own legs and arms a little even though it hurt.
“Fifteen,” Lupin chuckled. “Freshly presented, too. I had no idea how to handle my life, how to handle the knowledge of what I was. My parents had always treated me like any other, and the switch from that to being perceived as weak and vulnerable was awful. It was part of the reason I ran away.” He sighed, but it didn’t sound heavy. It sounded nostalgic. “It was a great summer.”
“They told us probably nothing will happen the first few weeks. By the time my heat hits, we should be good to go,” he answered slowly. “But if it doesn’t work in one go, they’ll be giving me heat-inducing potions on top of these so I’ll go into heat about every two to four weeks until we succeed.”
‘Draco darling, I’d like you to meet Mr Harry Potter. He would just like to talk to you for a few minutes, if that is all right. I will be right next door so if there is anything you need…’
He had no idea how he ended up in his own bed, but supposed that at some point he passed out trying to obey his Alpha’s commands, after which a servant would have probably brought him to his chambers.
“I’m not mated to Tonks.” With slow, measured movements, Lupin poured himself another mug of tea, curling his fingers around the too-hot porcelain. “My mate’s in Azkaban. We were permitted one visit every month, and had an arrangement for heats.”
Draco could barely comprehend that Harry had been the one to kill the villain. Instead, he asked, suddenly panicked, “Tori and Lizzie, are- are they-”
“You’re good, you’re good,” Harry promised again, and he set his hips in motion, slowly at first but soon responding to his mate’s needy whines and pleas. Draco scratched against the wall, scrambling to get a grip on the slippery tiles when his Alpha became rougher. He let Harry cover him as much as the Alpha wanted, submitting fully.
Harry stopped in his tracks, quiet in an instant. “I should…” He stepped back towards the door as if to leave the room, but stopped when Draco whined. “Please… stay…”
Luna sat down next to him, while Harry and Mr Lovegood sat at the other end of the table. By the looks of it, they were already deep in conversation, Harry pulling parchment out of his satchel as Mr Lovegood spoke and then making haphazard notes.
So Draco turned away from Hermione and watched Ginny step out the door. Now that he paid more attention, he noticed how she stiffened when she saw how close the memory-Draco and Harry were. She did the whole greeting thing, complimented Draco and then dropped the bomb, making his memory-self flee.
‘He was,’ Draco carefully confirmed. ‘And erm – it makes me feel off and uncomfortable. I don’t really remember what went down and then Harry dropped me off here and left and I…’ Tears welled up in his eyes and he tried to push them away,
Next week's chapter will bring some action into the mix! I know it doesn't seem like it yet, but we're in the home stretch now. Just a few more chapters to go!
“I turned off the alarm and locked the house away. Are you okay?” She remained on the other side of the door without opening it, and Draco appreciated the gesture.
So... How was it? No big confrontation with Riddle (I really wouldn't know how to write that anyway...) but I do feel like all the loose ends are tucked away nicely.
A few days passed. Remus kept up with his correspondence, but Draco didn’t ask about it. It felt private.
Draco took a few more sips of the hangover cure, trying to remember exactly what they’d been talking about. “I think so.”
Draco watched as he obeyed and rolled back over to Harry. It was a strange thing, to see him and Harry together from another person’s point of view, especially since he had suppressed memories of this.
Neither of them had patience for tenderness now, and when Harry set his hips in motion, it knocked the breath out of Draco. He barely had time to suck in some precious breath before Harry thrusted deep in again. It was hard to keep himself from crashing into the wall. The muscles in his legs trembled. With effort, he bent his head back, let it fall against Harry’s shoulder, who only momentarily slowed his pace to bite back down on their bond mark again. It was too much for Draco - he came with a weak moan, without even touching himself. Harry growled, and Draco more felt the noise than heard it. “Knot me,” he weakly breathed. He could feel that Harry wanted it, and even though he knew he’d be sore from it, he wanted it too.
‘You can write your questions down if it’s too hard to ask them out loud,’ Mrs Weasley offered. ‘Write them down over the course of today and I’ll provide you with a written answer on whatever questions you have.’
“Mrs Malfoy.” Harry greeted coldly, having moved quickly back to Draco as soon as he had heard her voice. When Draco felt his Alpha’s hand on his shoulder, reassuring, he managed to breathe in and he relaxed a little.
“I’ll write you in as one of my safehouse guests,” Harry offered. “You can stay as long as you need to.” After some hesitation, he added, “and see Tonks as much as you want, of course.”
“Hmmm, really?” Draco moved his head back a little, exposing their bond mark, despite knowing it was a futile attempt – Harry rarely ever bit him outside of heat.
“Of course,” Hermione said without missing a beat. “Andromeda and I will be over tomorrow afternoon to discuss matters. Please do not feel obligated to join the discussion. We all understand that your health and comfort is of utmost importance now.”
“We should move you to Sunny Springs just to be sure,” Hermione persisted and she offered Draco her hand. “Can you stand?”
“We’ll ask in a few hours, okay? It’s too early for them to be up. Just try to sleep a little more.” He petted Elizabeth’s soft, blonde curls.
The first few weeks of the courtship consisted of Harry visiting Draco at least three times a week, but sometimes more. Harry tried to come over for longer periods of time or sometimes even the whole day at least twice a week, but often visited for lunch or dinner, and sometimes visited right after dinner. He and Draco would then usually go on a walk. Because Draco had expressed his preference for Adelaide joining them as a chaperone, they couldn’t often go that far, but no-one complained about that.
“When the summer was over, Sirius asked me to come with him. I did. Been together ever since.” He absentmindedly placed two fingers over the faded bond mark at the side of his throat.
‘That’s okay,’ Adelaide murmured. She stepped away from him and smiled once more. ‘Arthur and I went to Diagon Alley and we bought so many things for the baby!’ She held up a bag.
‘THEY ALL WENT TO MYRION!’ Hermione shouted triumphantly as she stumbled out of the floo, carrying a stack of file folders and looking more dishevelled than Draco had ever seen her. She threw the stack of folders on Harry’s desk and sank down on the couch next to Draco. ‘I think this might be the breakthrough we’ve been looking for.’ It sounded like she couldn’t quite believe it yet.
Draco whined impatiently. At this point, he couldn’t care less about tearing. He ached for his mate.
‘It’s not, really…’ Draco moved a little bit, again, ‘I still need you to…’ He ended the sentence in a moan when he felt Harry come for the umpteenth time.
With a deep breath, he leaned forward, opening his eyes again and trying to make sense out of Lupin’s work. “What are you working on today?” Lupin’s projects varied from week to week, and he kept detailed records of what he did in his notebooks. Both Harry and Draco understood and accepted that they would not be involved in whatever Lupin was doing unless he asked for their explicit help.
Harry slowly let him go and sighed. ‘I guess we’ll have to go back then.’ He looked lost and a bit disappointed, so Draco bent his head down again, just a little bit, and pressed his lips against Harry’s for a quick kiss. Harry grinned, Draco could feel, and he revelled in the marvellous feel of feeling Harry smile against his lips, before pulling back. ‘We should really go upstairs,’ Draco said, trying to look strict, making Harry laugh. It sounded a bit hoarse and Draco suppressed a shudder, feeling that tinge of arousal come back up. Knowing that he had the skill to turn Harry on
“I can imagine.” Lupin seemed to crawl back into his shell. Out of embarrassment or discomfort, Draco couldn’t tell. If he had to hazard a guess, he’d say a combination of both.
Again, Draco could hardly register the words. “I need Harry.” He could still feel his mate through their bond, but it was a numb, far-away feeling. He couldn’t tell if it was because of the literal distance between them, or because Harry closed himself off when he was out in the field.
Under Mara’s guidance, they picked out two matching cribs, a commode with a changing table attached to it, plushies, bedding, mobiles and more. When they walked to the cash register, they passed a display with dino plushies. Without thinking, Draco broke free from Harry, darting to the display and picking up one of the plushies. It satisfyingly roared when he touched it. He held it up to his face, testing the softness against his cheek and found it more than soft enough.
‘He might’ve mentioned something like that.’ Hermione seemed to hesitate, but decidedly asked, ‘do you feel like you’re lacking in something because you’re not able to do certain things with Harry outside of your heat?’
A soft brush of lips against his own, then a whisper, ‘money’s no objection, Draco. Now go find something that you like.’ He stepped away from Draco, smiling gently.
Draco reached behind him to grab Harry’s arm and pull it back around him. “Shush,” he grumbled. The sun wasn’t even up yet, there was no reason for Harry to be awake and next to that Draco wasn’t going to give up his warm, comfortable position as the little spoon.
“You and the children are in good health,” Healer Roberts announced. “We’ll prepare you and a room for the c-section. I estimate that we can start within an hour or so.”
‘Maybe Harry could escort you, instead of me,’ Mrs Weasley suggested. Draco almost jumped, having forgotten that she was also in the kitchen.
‘Harry don’t – ’ Molly started but then Draco made a soft, keening noise. It shocked him that he could make such a noise but –
‘I understand,’ Harry nodded. ‘I was just wondering, doesn’t it hurt the school that there has been so much attention for Omega abuse lately?’
“Draco – I…” Harry shook his head and the air in the room became a bit lighter. “I don’t want to hurt you.”
“I do.” Harry sighed. “I just… I don’t know - I like working, and having a job, but I want to make a choice that’s good for
Just as he placed his feet on the cold floor, Harry came into the bedroom. A breakfast tray floated in behind him. Quickly, Draco pulled his feet up, back into the bed and pulled up the covers.
Draco bend his head back, offering his throat again. ‘Bite me, please…’ His voice was unlike anything he’d ever heard, it was somewhat of a purr, combined with a whimper.
“I’ll get the prescription in order.” Healer Roberts stood up and waved them towards the door, shaking Harry’s hand and granting the smallest of bows to Draco. “You can pick it up at the front desk, Bella will have it all ready for you.”
He was just about to ask about the thing, when Harry entered the living room, bringing a bottle of wine and three wine glasses. “Adelaide,” he said and while he hid his surprise well, Draco could feel the start through the bond.
‘Good.’ And in one firm thrust, Harry pushed in to the hilt. Draco yelped and moaned. It was one thing being filled up slowly, getting your arse stuffed within mere seconds was an entirely different thing. Harry must’ve known, because he waited patiently for Draco to initiate movement before he started to thrust. Even though they were shallow thrusts, Draco’s eyes rolled back in his head and he bared his neck again. ‘More, please,’ Draco choked out and Harry willingly upped the game of his thrusts.
‘Harry, your report is abhorrent,’ Hermione complained, making Draco look up from his book and study the two. Harry glanced at Draco and he suppressed a smile.
A soft tug on his hair made Draco tilt his head back, giving Harry access to his throat. Before he was even aware of it, teeth grazed over his pulse point, biting down hard. ‘Harry,’ he breathed, making his Alpha growl and placing his weight over Draco, pinning him down onto the matrass and biting down firmer.
“I was thinking we could maybe watch a movie,” Draco suggested quickly, afraid Harry might want to talk already.
Draco shrugged into the matching blazer, revelling in the soft feel of the fabric and how well it fit him. ‘Maybe I could convince Harry to take me out for dinner some time.’
“I wish we could do more for him,” Draco mumbled, feeling drowsy now that the pain went down a little.
‘Owned by Alpha Lucius Malfoy, paternal relationship, no prospects of switching owner within the upcoming six months, sir.’
Draco’s interest was piqued, but he was afraid to ask for more, so he asked her to read the rest of the paper to him while he ate all the sweets she’d brought him and drank an obscene amount of coffee.
I'm still figuring out where to do with this, but the story is coming together in my mind. I can't say how many more chapters are coming, but I'm hoping it'll be around 20 chapters total. We'll see where my mind brings me haha.
And also sorry for the short chapter, but I wanted to keep the suspence in there so this was the perfect way to end this chapter.
Harry looked at Draco. Draco shook his head lightly. He wasn’t going to let that woman near Lupin again until he was absolutely sure that he would be safe with her.
“Do you want your friend to join you if Harry is unable to?” Healer Roberts’ eyes flitted over to Remus, who had gone a little paler than he usually.
“We’re having twins,” Draco shyly revealed, patting his bump gently. “The nursery is yellow.” Before he could stop himself, he added, “I need everything to fit.” The compulsion to make everything fit, to ensure that everything would match, would be well-planned and coordinated was sharply embedded in him. “But I can’t… It's so much.”
It took a while for Draco to find strength to speak again; with the pain of their rough coupling now weaning, a deep weariness settled in his bones. “I can’t imagine having to do this several times,” he sighed, “what a frenzy.”
‘Oh god yes, bite me,’ Draco immediately mindlessly begged, ‘bite me, Harry.’ He pushed his head back further, hoping to entice Harry into finally biting him.
Draco smiled and sat down next to Harry, whilst still gently cradling Alexander. It was quiet for a long time, with Harry having returned to reading his book and Draco being completely absorbed in the cutest baby he’d ever held, so when Harry suddenly asked, “do you want kids?” Draco didn’t immediately responded. Harry nudged Draco’s side with his elbow. “Draco.”
‘Oh, good,’ Draco said relieved. ‘Because I also wanted to ask you to chaperone me and Harry when we go out… I mean, he hasn’t visited yet and I don’t know how long it takes before he can visit, but I understand that the Omega can usually pick the chaperones to take with them on outings and I – ’
Draco stumbled out of the floo and felt Harry’s hands steadying him quickly. ‘You okay?’ the Alpha asked and Draco nodded. ‘It’s much better than apparition.’
The clothes were coarse, not as soft as he was used to. They also were a few sizes too big, as she had said they would be. The fresh change of pants however, fit him perfectly and he blushed, thinking that she must’ve helped him in and out of fresh clothes at least a few times by now. The fact that he had burrowed clothing meant that he had nothing of his own so someone had to have gone out to but him new pants… Right?
“Draco, Harry, are you in there?” Ron knocked loudly on the kitchen door and Draco could feel Harry tense up behind him. Draco sighed. This hadn’t been the first time that Ron had intruded during their love-making – although doing it in the kitchen maybe hadn’t been the smartest thing to do.
With more time on his hands than he could handle he often found himself discussing weird things like that… with himself.
Draco quickly turned around, scarf still in hand, and tried not to look guilty. “I’m just... I feel like it’s time now. I need a... a...”  He looked away, at his feet, feeling confused and embarrassed. A nest was not supposed to consist of things of anyone other than the Alpha and Omega
Draco’s day started like any other day would start ever since he’d presented as an Omega. He was awoken by a moderately pretty maid, who would tell him his bath was ready and breakfast would be served in an hour. He got up sleepily and the maid draped his dressing gown around his body. She gently guided him towards the bathroom. He took the dressing gown off again and pushed his black briefs down. The maid picked them up before he could do anything about it. She gestured towards the bath.
Harry chuckled, kissing Draco’s neck, pulling him close, cuddling a little, ‘whatever you want, hmm…’
“If Azkaban is safe enough for other Omegas to visit their mates, it’s safe enough for me,” Draco replied, now looking at Harry. His choice was made. Even if his mate did not agree, he would do this. “Remus is my friend. I want to help him.”
Draco grumbled his dissatisfaction. As he let himself sink down into the hot bath, his grumble turned into a purr of relief. Being in the water was an overall alleviating experience; it helped his sore, cramped joints relax and helped ease the insane muscle tension that came with his pregnancy anxiety. With a sigh, he leaned his head against the soft cushioned headrest. He closed his eyes and breathed out slowly.
“Your father and I were led to believe you were still residing in a safe house,” his mother continued as if he hadn’t said anything.
“The bond sickness is the worst,” Lupin murmured, voice now equally low. “One afternoon a month isn’t enough to keep it away. But it was all they were willing to give.”
She knew exactly what he meant and smiled, he could feel her smile even though he couldn’t see it. ‘I’m so proud of you, honey, you’ve been so good… just go to sleep now, hmmm? I’ll still be here… good boy…’
Mere seconds later, Draco clung to Harry’s arm as if his life depended on it and he was awkwardly conscious of the fact that he was doing it. A part of him found it horrifying how much he’d become dependent on Harry, but a different part argued it was quite nice to be navigated through Diagon Alley by his strong Alpha.
“I’m going to be completely safe. I will make sure that I, and our babies are safe. I will not allow anyone to hurt me. Okay?”
Draco waited a beat, wanting to be sure that Lupin wanted him to read the letter. The other man nodded at him when Draco sought eye contact. He picked up the letter, folding it open again, eyes scanning the contents before letting out a low sigh. “I can’t believe they’re doing this.”
“Hey,” he murmured, stretching his hand out, offering his wrist to the other Omega. The man looked up, and his eyes were filled with tears and fear. His breathing remained erratic.
The lady took his plate away, replaced it with a cup of tea and sat down next to him. She lifted his feet and placed them in her lap. He immediately curled his toes and smiled, so happy that he could still touch the Alpha.
“That’s fast,” Lupin commented. “Are you sure everything is alright?” His eyes slid over Draco’s form, assessing the situation.
“Yes,” Harry murmured, his voice full of promise. “You’re so good for me, so perfect, so -” he pressed his lips against Draco’s neck, humming. Draco’s muscles trembled, trying to stay still like his Alpha had told him, but wanting - needing more, more than this.
This chapter is a little on the short side guys, I'm sorry. I basically panic-wrote this at 2 am last night (lol).
Hermione, Ron and Remus were still in the living room. He could hear them talking as he entered the kitchen and grabbed himself a cup of tea. Then, he gracelessly waddled into the living room, standing still as he crossed the threshold and breathing for a few seconds to counter another trill of pain passing between his hips, cramping up every muscle it encountered between.
‘Yes,’ Harry confirmed. ‘I had no idea he’d been released though. The date was supposed to be… a few years ahead.’
Their room was nice, continuing the trend of being nicer than expected. Draco let himself flop down onto the bed unceremoniously. He let Harry take care of their luggage - it wasn’t much anyway - and the bag of potions and information leaflets they’d gotten at Sunny Springs.
Draco looked up. Maids usually didn’t talk to him unless it was the usual things. His father carefully instructed everyone that came into contact with Draco not to speak to him. ‘Yes, of course. You may leave now.’ He waved his hand in the direction of the door. She left.
In the meantime, I and my writing style have grown in changed, so even though I'll try to keep everything in the same style and 'feel', I can't promise it'll be exactly the same as before.
“Look at me,” Draco requested, placing a hand on Harry’s cheek as he turned his head. “I’m going to help my friend.”
Ginny did not make an appearance at dinner, nor did Ron. It was just Harry, Hermione, Draco and Adelaide.
Draco rose as well and found himself nose to nose with Mr Potter. He wanted to step away from the Alpha, to show obedience, but somehow found himself unable to move. Mr Potter moved a tiny bit forward and Draco closed his eyes, expectantly…
‘Wet for you,’ Draco nodded diligently against the crook of Harry’s neck, and he pushed back on Harry’s fingers once more. Harry gently added a third one and made a gesture Draco couldn’t quite place, until it hit home.
A third finger was added and Draco whimpered, pushing back on them, needing more, so much more.  This time however, Harry moved his fingers for an agonising amount of time before carefully adding a fourth finger.
‘That’s great, honey.’ She petted his check softly and he held back a purr. ‘Is there anything I can do for you? Are you hungry?’
‘I never realised…’ Hermione considered out loud, ‘but did your parents know that the list only stated recommendations?’
Hermione silently flipped through the book and eventually commented, “I had no idea you and Harry were trying to conceive.”
‘I know!’ Hermione squeaked excitedly, ‘and look, he’s going to own most of the Omegas we thought were abused! And did you see where he lives?’
‘Well, let’s go in then.’ Harry pushed Draco forwards a little bit and Draco hesitantly opened the door. It was more formal to let Harry do this, because he was the Alpha, but if this was a shop meant for Omegas…
Harry laughed. “I’m sorry, baby.” He sank down next to Draco and looked over to where their children were playing. “Maybe we need to teach Elizabeth how to say no to her sister.”
“I have no doubt. Come on.” With a light push against his hip, Harry made Draco turn towards him. Draco meekly complied, allowing the Alpha to undress him further.
“First time was when I was 26. It didn’t hold.” Lupin looked down at his mug. His voice lowered to a whisper. “Most recently… five months ago.”
. It’s fishy. I just know something’s wrong. And that principle – she’s involved. I don’t have any evidence but… she is.’
‘It’s not over yet.’ Harry wrapped his arms firmer around Draco. ‘If you keep doing that you’ll be stuck with me forever.’
“I was five. Old enough to remember…” his voice faded away, and he cleared his throat before continuing, “There were two flashes of green, first for my father, and then my mother.”
It was eerie how he could switch from being a loving, concerned mate, to this goal-oriented, combat-ready machine within seconds. Seeing the switch happen in front of his own eyes unsettled Draco. “Come back to me alive.” It wasn’t an order - and even if it had been, as an Omega, Draco held no such power over an Alpha - but something clicked in place behind Harry’s eyes and he nodded sharply, before disapparating with a loud
If you see/find any typo's, grammar errors or weird English, please do tell me and I will fix it right away!
His mother looked away, still not showing any signs of emotion, but still, Draco knew that saying that would’ve hurt her.
“Sirius has an aunt… she may be willing to advocate for him,” Remus murmured, tapping his fingers on the wooden table in an irregular pattern. It seemed to ground him.
Draco sat down next to Harry and took the list from him. ‘I know a few… Neville Longbottom was in my year, Astoria Greengrass, Luna Lovegood and Zacharias Smith were one year below and the I know that those three,’ Draco pointed out some other names, ‘were in the lowest year, but I wasn’t acquainted with them very well.’ He waited for a sew second and then asked, ‘so why did you want to know that?’
‘Oh.’ Draco turned a little bit, biting his lip and looking at Harry. ‘But what if I… don’t want to do certain things?’
They hadn’t told anyone about his pregnancy yet - they were waiting for the 12-week mark, because the chances of a healthy, sustained pregnancy were much larger then. “Um. Yeah. Just… a little worried about Harry going back to work.” With careful motions, he turned around, following Adelaide around with his eyes.
Draco grinned, unable to suppress this weird, happy, sated feeling that washed over him, ‘no, knowing where you just put your mouth. Brush your teeth first.’
Despite not getting much sunshine these days, Harry’s skin was still tinted a warm brown. He’d been working out almost daily now that he was on the clock again, and even though Draco liked Harry no matter what his body shape, he had to be honest - Harry looked like a snack. He pushed himself away from the doorpost and walked up to his mate, letting Harry catch him in his arms. Harry pressed his nose against Draco’s hair, sniffing up his scent with a low hum. “You smell nice,” he murmured, making Draco laugh quietly. “Don’t I always?”
‘Yes.’ Harry sounded hoarse when he added, ‘I’ve never heard of a male Omega getting wet like that outside of heat.’
‘Oh my...’ Adelaide got up, with some effort, and put her arms around Draco. He leaned into her, feeling stupid that he had ever thought he would find an Alpha to be with. Of course he wouldn’t find anyone – his father had told him time and time again that he was a useless Omega, dysfunctional, only desired by idiots and lunatics.
‘I’m right here…’ Harry slowly started to retract his hand again, whilst using his other hand to rub soothing circles across Draco’s lower back.
‘Oh my, a sensitive Omega,’ Ginny snorted. ‘Harry, really, I don’t understand how you can go from dating an Alpha to courting such a sensitive little doll in just a few weeks!’
It was mundane, and slightly disgusting to pie on a stick, Draco felt, but short of floo-ing to Edinburgh for a magical test, there was nothing easier.
Draco looked away, feeling awkward, wanting to answer but knowing full well that Mrs Weasley was Ginny’s mother and how that could complicate things. ‘It was about Ginny and Harry,’ he mumbled.
‘Draco suggested that he could come with you when you inspect the houses and living circumstances and see if he could talk to the Omegas without their owners, maybe he can pry some information out of them!’ Hermione spoke so fast it was hard to follow.
“My parents trusted him.” Harry’s voice was quiet and constrained, like he was forcing the words out, like someone was pushing the words out with a metal dowel. “He broke their trust. And then they died.”
Behind him, the Alpha growled and Draco didn’t dare to say more, especially when a finger breached his entrance and slid in. His breath hitched and he let out a needy moan, ‘please…’
So far, he felt relatively stable despite taking the hormone potions. Sure, he couldn’t handle Harry being away farther from him than about twenty feet or so, but since Harry’s leave of absence, Draco always wanted him near. He hadn’t
A silence fell over them, and it remained quiet for a few minutes. Draco eventually broke the silence, and asked, “and you? How did you meet your mate?”
Harry smiled at his sleeping Omega and closed his eyes too, for a few minutes. Draco prepared to be sucked out of the memory again, but when nothing happened he stepped a bit closer to study the couple. They looked good together, but eventually it was mostly Harry he looked at.
He walked out of the kitchen, into the living room and after that up the stairs. He found Mrs Weasley in the bathroom, spelling a mop and a few pieces of cloth to do the cleaning.
Draco shot up, wide awake at the sounds of their home alarm going off. Next to him, Harry did the same, stumbling out of bed to wrestle himself into some clothes and grab his wand. Just as he was about to cast the spell to dispel the alarm so that he could go look for what it had been that tripped it, the alarm stopped. Harry blinked rapidly before turning to Draco. “It’s work. I need to come in.”
The visits were good for Remus. He gained some weight. Life returned to his eyes. He seemed so much more animated than before. It was a slow process, but Draco was happy to see it happening. Even if it was sometimes a little awkward to drag a touch-drunk Remus home.
‘Copies of the records are kept at the Ministry,’ Draco remembered from his school time, ‘so it should be something you can easily verify.’
‘Oh, yes, so I was digging the hole for the flutterby bush and then I dove my shovel straight into a snake, chopping its head off… Pretty cool.’
“Why didn’t you want me to take you in our bed?” Harry then asked, laughter still in his warm voice.
“I’d like to go for the hormone potions though,”  Draco attempted to be serious again, but Adelaide had such a laughing fit it was hard to be. He took his teacup and raised it for a sip when the kitchen floo roared to life and Harry came through.
‘Almost a year,’ Draco answered, not sure where this was going, ‘you never came along anymore when your parents visited me.’
“I know, I’m sorry.” Harry slowly started to move, bringing Draco up along with him. “I can send you home, now.”
Harry ordered for them, and Draco, uncaring, went to sit outside. The sun shone unusually bright for this time of the year, and Draco cursed it under his breath. Today was no day for sunshine. He wished it would rain.
“Uhu…” She seemed to be occupied with Alexander for a few minutes and then continued, “Molly and Arthur sort of wanted me out and I figured Draco never minds my company, or, well, actually, Alexander’s…” As she sat down, she handed the baby over to Draco. He carefully accepted his favourite child and, feeling awkward but still wanting to do it, kissed Alexander’s head briefly, making him squeal happily.
‘That’s not quite right, Draco.’ Miss Fawley sounded friendly. She was really nice, actually. She never shouted at him, or raised her voice, like some of his other tutors did. Sometimes she allowed him to do things he really wasn’t supposed to, like read a book that had not been approved as appropriate literature for Omegas, drink coffee or sit inappropriately. Occasionally, she’d read the paper to him. The fact that he wasn’t allowed to read it, didn’t mean he couldn’t listen to someone else reading it.
Please don't ask me where I'm going with this - I can feel the story spinning in my head but I'm still tugging on different strands to unravel it. I know that Lupin's appearance is a little sudden, and I hadn't really planned for it, but I had so much fun writing this chapter, and it feels good to have him appear in the story. So... I guess we'll see where the muses take me for next week's chapter, haha.
Hermione’s eyes slid over Draco in an obvious manner. For the first time, the Alpha’s eyes felt intrusive, and it made Draco cross an arm in front of his stomach.
Draco did so and found warm hands on his arse, opening him up. He moaned when a finger slid in and moved back on it a little.
But Draco leaned into Harry, letting himself fall into the bed. It was awkward at first, because he half laid into the bed and half on top of Harry, but then Harry moved and pulled the duvet over the both of them, covering Draco in the welcoming heat of Harry’s bed. He sniffed up the air a little, smelling only his Alphas wonderful scent. He relaxed.
Healer Roberts snorted. “I can’t believe they still publish that crap. That system is outdated and based on archaic texts. I can’t say all of it is fake, but it certainly won’t be of any importance when it comes to whether or not you can have a baby, so please don’t worry about that. You can have a baby – regardless of the situation, I can help you realise a pregnancy and how easy or difficult it is going to be depends mostly on how strong Draco's magical core is.”
“You two are so disgustingly cute,” Adelaide commented and Draco huffed out a laugh. “Excuse us for being in a loving relationship,” he retorted. Harry chuckled and, keeping a firm grip on Draco’s arm, lifted him out of his chair. “On that note, let’s go home,
Draco leaned against Harry, placing his head against the Alpha’s shoulder. “I’m… Yeah… I’d like to have kids…” He wasn’t even sure if he was fertile yet, because it took most male Omegas four or five heats to become fully fertile and even then it was hard to conceive. Miscarriages were more the rule then they were the exception.
“... nesting. But I understand that that is not an option anymore. So why don’t we start with something small?” Mara took a list and a pencil from one of her pockets. “I could lead you to the plushies. We’ve just gotten in an order of heatable ones, they’re very convenient.”
Once safely out of the department, Harry slid his arm around Draco’s waist. He was going towards the exit when Draco jerked to the right, in the direction of the ORO. Harry said nothing and followed Draco’s lead as he led them to Hermione’s office.
“Permission granted,” Harry chuckled as he let himself slide down. He pressed slow, soft kisses onto Draco’s skin as he went, pausing to give special attention to the c-section scar. It made Draco clench his muscles, and he whined impatiently. Harry could not be rushed, though, and he leisurely continued, pressing his lips to milky white skin and continuing to skip the one place where Draco wanted his lips - on his cock.
Or actually, I wanted to write it all in one go (Draco meeting the gang) but wanted to write it perfectly. I wanted to describe Grimmauld Place and many other things as well, because I felt that if I would "just" throw Harry's family in the mix it would feel awkward and strained.
She stiffened. ‘There are none. I just stopped taking the suppressants. My Alpha ordered me to do so and gave me this explanation.’
During day six and seven, he completed the last two floors, including huge Christmas trees in the office and both the living rooms. After a fiery discussion with Hermione, he allowed her and Ron to do the Christmas tree in their own living room. Everything else, though, was firmly in his grip.
“Sometimes you are,” Draco sniffed, feeling suddenly offended at his own joke. “I see you look at me and think all you see is a broodmare.”
Draco bit back the tears, trying to form the words, trying to tell Harry what he needed but all he could manage was, ‘please, Harry.’
“Compared to what he’s been through, I’ll gladly take it,” Remus said with a chuckle. “I feel reasonably optimistic.”
It took Adelaide effort to not squeal, but she kept her tone low as she whispered her felicitations: “that’s amazing! How long now?”
The woman - Draco could now smell she was an Alpha, and he was unsurprised - made a frustrated, desperate noise. “Please.”
“We’re helping him plenty,” Harry said, his tone falling dangerously low. It made Draco wonder if Harry would physically prevent him from going with Remus.
Tonight, though, they’d have at least a change of scenery: after a few weeks of reduced contact, this was the first Friday where they were welcome for the usual weekly family dinner at the Burrow. Draco could guess why they hadn’t been welcome for a few weeks, and why the Weasleys had kept their floo guarded, and while he changed into loose-fitting trousers - he knew better than to wear anything tight to dinner at the Burrow - he wondered if Adelaide was pregnant yet.
Hermione placed a tentative arm on his hand. ‘I’ll see if I can find anything, but I do think you should tell Harry how you feel.’
“Oh, heavens.” Adelaide got up, jerked open one of the cabinets and took out two wine-glasses, which she then filled with a generous amount of white wine. “Here.” She gave one to Draco and held up her own. “Here’s to an awful party and horrible Alphas.”
Harry wanted to protest, but Draco jerked on his arm hard enough to make him swallow it. They made their way to the entrance of Diagon Alley instead.
“Yet here we are,” Draco repeated. “I don’t know - it was… Harry was the first one to treat me like I was a person. Molly treated me like a porcelain doll, but Harry just… respected my choices, and was - is always honest to me, and cares about what I have to say. Like he listens when I say something. He’s been really good to me.” He paused for a moment, considering his next words, “maybe I wouldn’t have fallen for him if I had been a beta, but thinking about things like that is useless. I love him now, and that’s what matters most to me.”
‘Yes, I do. I’m currently involved in the abuse cases.’ Hermione said it neutrally. ‘Harry helps me with that, too.’
Miss Fawley smiled at him. ‘Of course it is possible for you to do, even in your attire today. Just scoot your right foot backwards, your left foot to the right and then turn to sit facing forward. After that, place your feet next to each other and sit up straight.’
Gasping for breath he pulled away from Harry’s lips, letting out a wanton moan, “Harry, I need you, I need you, please.”
Keep in mind that this chapter and all chapters until chapter 10 have been written over the course of these last three years, and I've proofread them for consistency - but as I said, my writing style has evolved over this time so I can't promise 100% consistency when it comes to
Sirius grinned a quick, confident smile that melted off his face almost immediately. If Draco hadn’t spent all that time with him, he would have interpreted it as a grimace instead of a smile.
‘I already have the bathwater running for you. Come on.’ Harry took his memory-self with him. Draco could see now how concerned Harry was. He tried to follow the pair back up, but felt the pulling sensation wash over him as he was pushed out of the memory.
It took Harry and Draco a few more weeks to get the entire nursery in order. Draco was fussier about it than Harry, finding his mate’s lack of understanding frustrating at times. Why was it so hard for Harry to understand that the cribs needed to be perfectly centered, perfectly across one another and that their position in the nursery needed to ensure both children would get equal amounts of daylight? It irked Draco. Yet he could not explain why it needed to be like that to Harry. Explaining what his instincts told him was impossible. He could never find the words.
“Can we bring them with?” Draco could not part from his children so shortly after having them back in his arms.
his hole slick up some more. ‘I need it,’ Draco said shyly, but needy still. ‘I need you. I need to be filled, I’m so ready for it, please, Harry, please.’
“I only want our stuff near us,” Draco pushed his nose against Harry’s neck and sniffed his scent up. It was fresh and maybe a bit watery now that Harry was just out of the shower. “Their things would be... far away...”
Two weeks into Harry’s leave of absence, Draco was finally ready to share Harry with the world again... sort off.
“Work, mostly. Arthur’s getting promoted to manager of his division, and Ron told me they might be hiring some new employees for the store. It’s getting busier every week and they need to spend more time making their products, which means they can’t be on the shop floor as much.” Harry’s tone was quiet but even.
“Good.” Harry was silent for a moment, then stepped closer to Draco to take Victoria from him, who immediately quieted upon her papa’s touch. It made Draco feel jealous, considering Elizabeth was still screaming her lungs out.
Harry wordlessly followed along, pushing down his own trousers and positioning himself behind the Omega. He once again gripped Draco’s hips, holding them in place.
Draco’s body went rigid for a split-second, but then lax and he rolled back to his Alpha, his mind only filled with the urge to obey
Draco wasn’t so sure they had been lucky. He deemed it more likely that Harry had pulled some strings. With a sigh, he pulled out a chair and sat down on it, trying to find a way to sit that didn’t hurt his back.
Mrs Weasley gave Draco a cup of tea and a chocolate cookie first. He knew that she was trying to comfort him, make it easier to talk.
Draco shook his head. “No I’m… I’m okay.” They’d untangled a little while ago, but the uneasiness between them was still there. “What did you tell Ron and Hermione?”
Hermione’s face softened. ‘I am sorry about that, Draco. I don’t know what came over me. I feel very protective about the relationship you and Harry have and I was afraid a misunderstanding would ruin it for the both of you. I will better myself in the future and not use my Alphaness you order you – or any other Omega – around.’
“You’re so good for me,” Harry murmured, his breath hot on Draco’s throat. “Stay still.” He stabilised Draco with one hand on his hip while the other found its place low on Draco’s stomach, cradling the light swell there as he pressed in. Draco gasped, saw stars and squeezed his eyes shut. “Yes,” he hissed, eagerly pressing back against Harry.
‘Two more to go,’ Hermione said in a supportive manner as she patted Draco on the back. He nodded and watched fascinatedly how Harry put the next memory in the pensieve. ‘This one’s from the heat,’ Harry mumbled, not looking at either Draco or Hermione.
‘I know.’ The Alpha wrapped a strong arm around Draco’s waist, half lifting, half dragging him back into the bedroom. Draco whimpered as he felt slick trickle down his thighs. When Harry let go of him, he stumbled into the bed and whined, again, ‘please, Harry…’
“Okay.” Draco meekly allowed Harry to guide him out of the office and in the direction of his nest room. It was an unspoken agreement between the two of them that day-time naps and cuddle sessions were now always taken in Draco’s nest. The nest was an incredible safe space for him, and he could hardly imagine living without one anymore. Sometimes he wished he could sleep in it at night, too, but the need for his mate was often greater than the need for his nest.
‘Blaise. I already thought you were acting weird.’ Draco hooked his leg behind Harry’s and pushed himself over to the other man’s lap, feeling bold. ‘There’s nothing between me and Blaise. Next to that, he’s a Beta, and why would I want a Beta when I have a perfectly functioning Alpha at my beckon and call?’ He couldn’t withhold a smirk.
‘Yeah… We used to be friends when we were younger, but Augusta made him cut all ties with his friends when he presented as Omega,’ Harry told him.
‘I’ve been saying your name for about a minute now,’ Harry said, ‘I hope you’re not thinking about another man.’ It was supposed to be a joke, Draco was sure, but it sounded more like a warning.
‘It’s okay,’ Harry managed, and then, ‘I’ll take care of you…’ He moved his hand a little and pushed his pinkie in as well, using his hand to stretch his Omega as well as he could, and then drew his hand back, moaning at the wet, squelching sound that came with the movement.
Trying to push his anxiety down, he thought of his children. At least they had only taken him, and not the twins. At least they were safe with Remus.
In the end, the Aurors never caught Riddle. Pansy Parkinson was arrested and while she first claimed to have been under the Imperious curse, she eventually confessed to have hidden Riddle after his escape from Azkaban. She was also the one to bribe several Ministry officials to “lose” Riddle’s file and helped him gain ownership of more Omegas than was legal.
“Remus, Ron and I are going to make some tea and sit in the living room. Would you like to join us?”
Well, there we have it. The end of the series. I hope it satisfies you all - I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.
The need to submit slowly but surely became a problem again and this time the lists with chores Harry left him with, weren’t enough.
Draco pawed at his handsome mate, pushing him down on his back without a conscious thought. He settled on Harry’s lap, spreading his own legs just far enough to let Harry back in, sighing out his relief as soon as he’d found the right position. One hand to support him behind him, the other on his lower stomach, he let Harry hold onto him as he began to move, first slowly, adjusting his pace to the fire burning in his veins, but quickly growing more antsy, upping his pace until he was effectively riding his mate, using his cock for his own pleasure.
‘Don’t. Bare. Your. Neck,’ Harry gritted out. Draco immediately stopped but whimpered again in need.
“Of course they didn’t find anything upon their first visit, but after that happened, things got… less pleasant.” Draco joined Lupin, mimicking his movements with the paint roller, loading it and then applying it to the wall. The roller was heavier than he had anticipated. “One of my teachers eventually anonymously reported it. Harry carried me out as I was pretty much dying.”
‘Come on, just start with something,’ she encouraged him in that cooing, coaxing voice she used whenever he didn’t want to talk.
It was incredible, and kind of beautiful in a sick, twisted way. Draco had never seen a wizarding duel, let alone the siege that was taking place in front of his eyes.
Miss Fawley again smiled that tentative smile. ‘And for today you can be the king of my blanket fort kingdom.’
‘Harry…’ Hermione sighed, ‘do I really need to lecture you on how stupid it is to summon hot water?’
‘Come on, lay down. It’s all pre-heated you know,’ Harry invited, sneaking an arm around his waist and pulling gently, but giving him enough space to pull back if he didn’t want to.
From his peripheral vision, he could see Harry exchange some money for the keys to their room, and he quickly joined his mate again. It gave him a weird feeling of pride and satisfaction when Harry placed his arm around his waist, pulling the Omega closer.
“Yeah… it was a slow day today so…” Harry didn’t finish the sentence and Draco could feel an uneasy feeling slip through the bond.
He was back in Harry’s room. The light was dim, but he could see the outline of the two of them beneath the sheets. They lay face-to-face and his memory-self had snuggled up close to Harry.
‘Uhm, well, not really,’ Draco tried to temper Hermione’s enthusiasm, ‘but I think as someone who has been subjected to similar situations, I might recognise things you won’t. I mean, do any of you know what it looks like when we can’t answer a question due to the fact that our Alpha has ordered us not to talk about it? Those are things I can see but you probably won’t pick up on.’
Hi there, here's another chapter! Because I definitely know how to schedule things (not), this is a Christmas chapter.
“Is that all?” Harry asked. His voice was low, a near growl. He usually wasn’t this way, only let his urge for dominance over the Omega come out during Draco’s heats.
He looked up, only to find Harry looking at him worriedly. With some effort, he focussed on their bond and was surprised to find a mixture of shock, worry and some other emotions he couldn’t name.
He and Harry were feeding the girls in the nursery when he complained about it again. “I don’t get it. We can do all this weird and fantastic stuff with magic, but they couldn’t heal up my c-section with it. It
Remus took his hand and got up too, following Draco into the kitchen. As he sat down, Draco made another pot of tea.
It wasn’t nearly enough to make him feel clean again and he turned the water even hotter. He  took the bar of soap from the listel in the shower and washed his body.
For a split-second, it felt like falling, ben then the sensation turned into the gentle downward flutter, like it was when traveling via portkey. He’d only travelled by portkey twice, but knew that pointing your weight downwards made the descent easier. Hermione still had a hold on his arm and they landed on the ground without any crashing.
‘I didn’t want you to trip. And we’re not going to do the entire route through the store. We only need a wardrobe, so we’re going to the “sleeping and living” section.’
‘No, that’s true,’ Neville chuckled, ‘I did behead a snake once though. I was digging a hole for a new flutterby bush – they only bloom once a century you know, so if you want to keep a colourful garden and attract the Eden butterfly you need to keep planting new ones and – what was I talking about?’
“I know,” Draco replied with a yawn. “They’re coming to install air conditioning next week, remember? We just need to hold out for a little while longer.”
The nest - his nest, although it was hard for him to think of it that way - was dusty. Draco preferred sleeping in a bed, with Harry. He wasn’t even sure what he was supposed to do with the nest now that he wasn’t in heat, trying to conceive. During that time, it had made him feel safe, and kept. A limited area, a limited amount of space where he would be safe. If anything had happened during his heat, he would’ve been prepared to fight for his nest and his mate tooth and nail. Now, it was just a room with a stinky mattress and loads of pillows. He felt strangely unattached to it.
Harry just grunted something affirmative, and Draco laughed quietly. He’d always been somewhat of a morning person. Being raised the way he was, with a daily rhythm ingrained into every fibre of him, he supposed that it was inevitable to be a morning person. Of course, when Harry still worked, he got up with him every morning and as such, the rhythm has stayed in place.
‘All right, turn your head,’ Harry ordered and Draco complied, turning his head a little. Before he knew it, Harry’s lips pressed against his own. It was clumsy and messy due to the weird angle, but Draco liked it. Harry’s lips were chapped, but careful and it was a soft, almost chaste kiss. ‘Hmmm,’ Harry hummed and he gently pushed Draco into opening his mouth. At first he wasn’t sure where this was going, but he still did as Harry wanted. He tasted fresh, like toothpaste and when Draco carefully participated in the open-mouthed kiss, he found Harry had clean teeth, which was nice. It still was weird, though, but luckily Harry was very soft and gentle, giving Draco all the time he needed to get used it.
“We live on Ministry property,” Harry interjected, “please send everything to the Ministry sorting service. They’ll ensure everything will end up at our home.” He slid forward a business card with his name, function, and the address Mara had to use.
I manage to write that, it won't be any time soon - I just started a new Twilight story, so if it happens, it'll have to be after that.
Harry burned through his energy like a madman. He was often grumpy, and even though he tried to hide it beneath gentle smiles and loads of coffee, he was not okay. So Draco wasn’t okay either. But he didn’t not know how to breach the subject. He was afraid that if he suggested Harry’d stop working again, it would drive his mate over the edge - whatever that might entail. And so Draco kept quiet, keeping a close eye on his mate, tugging on their bond several times a day to check if he needed to keep the Alpha company to mitigate his stress and frustration, and silently thought about what kind of options they had.
“How’s the Sirius Task Force doing?” Draco eventually asked, allowing curiosity to take the better of him.
‘Okay…’ Draco slowly agreed, because it was reasonable and last time Harry hadn’t abused his power over him at all. ‘I think we need to be able to speak freely, at all times.’
Next week's chapter is chapter is "Round two". I'm sure you can guess what that's about, haha. Hope to see y'all again next week!
Head Auror Robards swiped his hand over his face and sighed. “I don’t really have much of a choice, do I?”
“I’d like that.” Draco waited a beat before adding, “thank you. For offering.” It broke the stalemate between them, and Lupin lifted his head again, meeting Draco’s eyes. In them, Draco could read anxiety and confusion, but also a spark of happiness. “Of course,” he murmured, before turning back to his books.
, her name tag read. She was a few inches shorter than Draco, and had a friendly face, framed by chestnut-coloured hair.
Something in Draco snapped, making him forget about his boundaries and embarrassment. ‘Please, Harry, please, all of it, please, fist me, I need it, please…’
Draco moved his chair so he could lean into Harry, though Harry’s lap would really be his preferred sitting place. “Edinburg.”
Draco hesitated, but Harry didn’t. “Is it really that easy? I read all this stuff about different types of bonds and it seemed pretty complicated.”
“Do you think it is possible to get our heat visits back?” Sirius’ tone was low and careful, as if he was afraid about breaching the subject with Draco.
‘Yes, sir, on what name?’ The Beta started flipping through a book, just as Adelaide also stepped inside.
It was quiet on the other side of the door for a few minutes, but then Harry opened the door for them, letting Draco back into their illuminated bedroom.
Hermione poured some sort of liquid into the pensieve and muttered a spell to activate it. Draco watched the process curiously, having never seen it before. Questions arose in his head and he mentally filed them away, to ask about sometime later.
‘Remind me that I should thank Hermione for sending me to that shop.’ Harry stepped closer to Draco and hugged him quickly.
Before people start asking, in this verse female Alphas are very prevalent (much more than male Alphas). I felt like Hermione has such a strong personality that she
‘Not yet,’ Harry answered and he pressed his lips against Draco’s temple. ‘Come on, let’s get you dried off.’ He got up, helped Draco out of the tub and towelled him dry.
Leave me a comment if you'd like, they make me so happy! (Tell me what you think, your thoughts on "Roots of a new life" in general, how you feel about Riddle and whatever else you'd like to share!)
There was no window in the room where he was held, and after a few hours, Draco gave up on trying to tell time. He averted his attention to other things. Crabbe had left the light on, and it was unpleasantly sharp. It was one of those cheap tube lights that muggles used in many schools. Every now and then, it flickered.
Harry laughed softly and bent towards Draco’s throat, biting at their bond mark lightly and then kissing Draco gently.
He walked back over to Emma and took her by the hand, leading her to the swings. ‘Come on, I talked to them and now you can go on the swing too.’
Draco flipped the page in his book, inwardly happy that it hadn’t come to a confrontation. He spent a lot of time with the two Alphas, visiting Grimmauld Place five days out of the week during office hours. Harry visited on the weekends, so he saw his Alpha daily. He saw Hermione almost as frequently as Harry and confrontations between the two made him feel uneasy. Harry had been more dominant the last week or so and even though he wasn’t the type of Alpha that always wanted to be right (which was impossible with Hermione near), Draco had noticed that Harry actively contested Hermione. His presence seemed to both help, and make it worse. Harry was calmer with Draco near, but at the same time easily agitated and somewhat overprotective. Is was because of this that Mrs Weasley had decided it was better for Draco to visit Grimmauld Place more.
Just as Draco poked his head out the door, Harry was there. He smiled at Draco and Draco smiled back automatically, stepping outside and into Harry’s embrace.
“We do,”  Harry slowly said, “my house is a fortress. No one can get in or out without my permission.” It wasn’t a threat, but the implication was clear.
Without needing to be prompted much, he tipped his head back when he felt Harry’s lips seek their bond mark, making an urgent noise of need, but Harry didn’t need much encouragement. He closed his teeth over the mark and bit down firmly, aggressive enough that Draco came without further stimulation.
‘Holy fuck Draco, when did you get this brave?’ Harry asked, but he still pushed two fingers in, just like Draco had asked.
‘Oh sorry!’ Neville flushed. ‘I keep forgetting that not everyone knows… I don’t think I’m supposed to tell new people though… but it was like a secret group of people that fought against a dark wizard, so… I think it’s pretty cool.’
He hesitated. He wasn’t supposed to read, but he did take a look at the headline, mostly because his mother wanted to discuss it with him. ‘Mother showed me the headline about the new abuse case, miss Fawley.’
Draco shrugged. “Not all of them. And the book explicitly stated that especially the hoarding, nesting and hostility are symptoms of this specific case. I don’t have any of those.”
Draco went downstairs again, to the kitchen, where Hermione stood ready by the pensieve. Walking up to it, he started to feel more nervous.
Harry frowned. ‘A little over forty-six galleons, I think. But it’s okay, I’ve got enough pounds on me.’
He had other ideas, too, ones that he wasn’t sure he wanted to talk about yet. Despite the fact that Harry always stressed that they could always talk, he still wasn’t talkative when it came to things he found difficult. Ideas he hadn’t worked out quite yet were difficult, so most remained in his head.
“Piecing together some family history.” Lupin placed his pen down and reached for one of the books, “this one’s just a genealogy book, listing who was born and when, marriages, deaths and any other event that is of relevance to the bloodline.” Moving over to a much smaller, newer book, he explained, “this one outlines how to read and use magical genealogy books.” He slid his fingers carefully over to the last two books. “This one’s magical law, the other is kind of an appendix. It explains the origin and practical applications of the more vague laws.”
He could hear Harry moving and felt fingers slip through his own. ‘Lying here is fine as well,’ Harry eventually whispered. ‘Are you comfortable?’
“You just need to tell us what you want,” Draco said. “We want what you want.” He gazed over at Harry before looking back to Lupin. “We won’t do anything… let anything happen without your consent.”
Draco joined him, looking at the yellows they had on offer. “I think… this one?” He took out two of the smaller cans, comparing them. “Maybe a brighter one, and a pastel one. The bright for the accents, pastel for the base colour?” He looked at Lupin, waiting for his opinion.
Two days later, Draco wandered up the stairs in Grimmauld Place, carrying a tray with tea for three and cookies, towards the office. The door was left open by just a creek, and Draco pushed against it with his shoulder to open it. ‘This was a one-time thing,’ he announced, ‘I’m not a maid. Next time you two can fetch your own tea.’
For a few minutes, the kitchen was veiled in a heavy silence. Then, Lupin opened his eyes. Just like Draco had pushed a teacup in his direction just a moment ago, he now pushed the package and its contents towards Draco.
‘You look so good in that outfit,’ Adelaide said as she stepped closer to Draco, tugging on the cuffs of his new dress shirt. ‘It’s too good to just wear at home.’
‘Wait, wait, I don’t get it,’ Adelaide shook her head and Harry paused the film. ‘So what, they just change into
Draco hadn’t picked up on such a desire from Adelaide and apparently, Harry hadn’t either as he looked a bit puzzled. ‘If that’s what you want, Adelaide…?’
The gaping emptiness and burning fire in his veins woke him up. He was alone, he could sense the absence of his Alpha.
“I can’t. Work meeting starts in 5.” Harry withdrew himself and almost immediately, Draco keenly felt the loss of his mate.
‘Do you think they painted the school?’ Adelaide asked, standing just a few steps behind Harry and Draco.
‘I’d like that,’ Draco agreed and let Harry take him to the kitchen, where they found Adelaide who was happily occupied with tea and cookies. Draco turned towards Harry and raised his eyebrows.
When they stepped inside, Draco had to admit Harry was right; the shop was nearly empty save for one woman with white blonde hair sitting in the corner. Her face was obscured by the Daily Prophet, but Draco could see she sat with a straight back, perching on the edge of her chair like she was ready to leave any minute now. He sank down at a vacant table, leaving the ice cream-ordering to Harry. The women moved, her newspaper rustling and Draco was just about to ask her if he could have the review section, when Harry called out, “Draco, what do you want?”
Harry didn’t need any more encouragement. He let his teeth fall in the ridges of Draco’s bond mark, biting down. Draco moaned weakly, pressing his hands into the wall to help him keep upright. Harry drove his knee in between Draco’s thighs, and Draco obediently spread his legs. He kept his teeth on Draco’s throat as he pressed a hand between them, prepping Draco quickly, impatiently, pressing one finger into his wet hole, then two, spreading them to ensure that he wouldn’t make his mate tear.
“I read all the cases that come in, assign people to them and keep track of all the reports that they hand in. When the case is closed, I’m the one that officially closes it. If different departments work together, I’m the contact point.”
‘They – my parents have a grave. Neville still visits his is St Mungo’s. It’s not – you don’t have to do that.’ Harry struggled to get the words out, Draco noted, and he bend forwards to kiss the other man, trying to comfort him with a soft touch of lips. ‘Whatever you want, Harry,’ he whispered.
‘Excuse me, please,’ Draco choked out and Hermione let him go just as fast as she had grabbed onto him.
Harry lifted his head, seeking eye contact with his mate, and finally, Draco granted him it. He unfolded his legs and made space for Harry on the couch, allowing him to join Draco. They were quiet for a few moments as Harry settled close to Draco, hands gliding over his body, patting him down carefully, stroking over available skin and smoothing down clothes to ensure his mate was okay. Draco allowed it, closing his eyes and letting the soothing feeling that came from Harry’s touch settle in his skin, his muscles, his bones, before gently returning the gesture. He didn’t stop until he heard and felt Harry’s breathing even out. It took a few more moments before he spoke, murmuring, “I understand that you can’t keep him here.”
Draco studied the screen, eventually seeing the little squares, but finding it hard to distinguish them when the images kept on moving. ‘I think I get it…’
More pressure and he whimpered again, as slowly Harry started to push his fist inside. As soon as Draco realised what he was doing, he moaned and tried to relax his muscles, allowing Harry to do it. His instincts told him Harry was preparing him to be knotted and suddenly that was all the wanted, all he needed.
Draco laughed breathlessly, mindlessly pushing himself up, closer to Harry, working in unison with his Alpha to gain that sweet relief he so ached for.
Diagon alley was nearly empty. Just a few people doing their shopping on a Monday afternoon. Fortescue’s was abandoned, the employee sitting behind the counter with a book.
“I’ll do that,” he hastily offered and he side-stepped around her, scurrying around until he found the kettle and put it on. “Where’s Molly?” A few weeks ago, he’d finally gotten over the need to call Molly, Mrs Weasley all the time. It was still difficult to think of Mr Weasley as Arthur though.
“You’re not helping, Harry.” Draco turned away from the mirror and towards his partner. “The thought we’ll be parents within a few weeks is…” he felt anxiety soar in his stomach and ride up into his throat, making him feel like he needed to throw up. “... terrifying,” he finished his sentence in a whisper.
“Shut up,” Draco retorted, although his voice held no conviction. “I carried children for you. Allow me a little possessiveness.” He lifted his hips when Harry tugged on his trousers and pants.
I'm really planning on taking my time in describing the courtship, because it's such a lovely addition to this universe. As you will read further along in the chapter, there are several types of courtship (but they all lead to bonding/switching owners).
‘Ahem. Yes.’ Mr Potter was very close all of a sudden and Draco looked to his mother for support. Her lips were firmly pressed together. She kept a close eye on Mr Potter and Draco could breathe again, felt much safer now that he realised his mother would never allow a stranger to touch him.
He dressed in light clothes, soft cottons that didn’t hurt his oversensitive skin, and used the stupid donut pillow Bella had given him when they sat down in the kitchen.
‘Therefore I will not bring you two back to the Burrow unless you allow Harry to explain. If you still want to go home after that, I will personally bring you. Agreed?’
‘Mhw, you make me do it…’ Draco responded and he wriggled his hips a little, hoping to lure another orgasm out of Harry. Harry maybe thought that it was embarrassing that he could come over and over again when he’d knotted Draco, but Draco secretly liked it. A lot.
Also, can you guess who this lady is? Tell me in the comments, I'm curious to hear your guesses (although I think it is super obvious)
Draco dropped the towel on the floor and walked to the bedroom with jerky motions. He let himself fall on the bed. The soft sheets had a cooling effect on his body and he sighed, because the need dwindled a bit.
Harry did not need any more encouragement. He gripped Draco’s arm harder than was necessary and disapparated them home.
‘They’re hiding the school from view, only Omegas can enter,’ Harry started, ‘and they allow prospected owners to remain anonymous. From what I gathered, only the principle knows to whom the Omegas are promised.’
“Of course,” Harry said, placing a heavy hand on Remus’ shoulder to indicate that he wanted the Omega to come with him. He was worried about Draco, and was eager to get both Omegas home, to safety. “Shall we?”
Ginny smiled and bowed quickly. It seemed unpractised to Draco, but it wasn’t really his place to say anything about that so he bowed back.
He bit his lip. It seemed like something that was only possible for ladies to achieve. He didn’t wear a skirt like hers. Some Omegas did, he knew, but he usually wore fitted trousers and a long tunic.
Remus and Sirius shuffled in a little awkwardly; Sirius had a death grip on Remus’ waist, his fingers digging into the material of his sweater and beneath it, his flesh. They settled on the other couch - Remus flopped down with familiar ease, while Sirius sat down carefully, hovering on the edge. His body language lacked hostility, though.
I couldn't help but wanting to put a bit of good-hearted banter in, some fluff as well as some smut.
Eventually, Draco picked four pairs of trousers, six tunics, three long-sleeved and three short-sleeved shirts (Harry had insisted), a jacket, a blazer, four more pairs of those lovely lace frilly socks and a new pair of shoes. Adelaide had picked two maternity dresses and a pair of trousers with a lovely silk blouse to match. Nothing had had any price tags on them, so Draco had no idea what all this had cost, but it seemed like a rather expensive gift.
When Draco did not reply, the stranger smiled. His teeth were white and straight, yet somehow they felt fake to Draco. Maybe it was the insincerity behind his smile. “No comment?”
Draco thought as he bend his leg around Harry’s hip and pushed closer. They were both quiet and had been for a while. Sometimes they cuddled for hours without saying anything. It wasn’t necessary anymore, now that their bond had matured. If something was wrong, Draco could feel this weirdness in the back of his mind that made him feel like he needed to ask Harry about… something. If Harry had any strong emotions, like anger or frustration, Draco felt similar feelings seep in through the weird spot in the back of his mind. Harry had told him he felt similar things.
awkward and conflicted. He wanted Harry to stay, he didn’t want to have to do without his Alpha for another two weeks, but he also didn’t want to disappoint Mrs Weasley. ‘I don’t think so,’ he whispered, ‘but – erm – what is an intimate courtship?’
‘But I want to…’ Draco complained again. ‘I want to…’ He felt too embarrassed to finish the sentence.
Draco let it happen, closing his eyes and lifting his hips against Harry’s, grinding slowly. Not that either of them needed the stimulation to get going - they were both already hard - but it felt good. It felt good to want his mate again, and it felt good to have a semblance of sex again.
Draco thought. The heat hadn’t kicked in fully yet and he was still capable of coherent thought, even though it was getting harder now.
Draco blinked slowly. His eyelids were still heavy. He breathed in through his nose, only to find it obstructed by a tube. He moved to touch it, to try and pull it out when a gentle hand stopped him. ‘Just leave it in there, okay?’
“I’m not sure.” Draco blinked and reassessed Remus, letting his eyes slide over the other Omega, trying to estimate
Inside, Draco stripped of his – now wet and icky – pyjamas, dropped them where he stood and dove into the nest, landing on the soft mattress and letting out a happy, bubbly laugh. He made himself comfortable as he watched Harry, who stood at the edge of the nest, still dressed. “Aren’t you gonna take that off?” Draco asked in his sweetest voice, enjoying the visible excitement his little act gave his Alpha.
“We will, thank you.” Draco took the pillow, paid with the money Harry had given him earlier and joined his mate again. While Bella and Healer Roberts were kind and helpful, he’d rather not stick around.
“Hello, I’m Prudence Roberts,” the healer eventually broke the silence. She stepped around Bella and moved towards them. Harry stood up and shook her hand, but Draco remained seated. He was getting nervous and hiding behind Harry made him feel a lot safer. Healer Roberts just smiled at him and bowed anyway, to which he responded with small nod.
Adelaide had permanently moved in with the Weasleys. Draco wasn’t sure what her relationship with Mr and Mrs Weasley was, and he was fairly certain he didn’t want to know the details either.
His father, however, had forced such habits out of him in a harsh way. He was surprised that he somehow did it now.
The experience was something he could only describe as completely weird. He felt tugging on his stomach for a few solid minutes, but everything was completely soundless until he heard Healer Roberts murmur something to Bella, quickly followed by a loudly wailing baby. From the corner of his eyes, Draco could see Bella wrap the child in a white piece of cloth, before moving past the screen and showing the child to Draco and Harry. “Would you like to hold her?”
“He told me he lived with Sirius’ aunt for a while after he and Sirius bonded, but lost contact when Sirius got arrested.”
‘Most of them, I think so, yes…’ Draco became hesitant now that Harry and Hermione both asked rapid questions, as if they were on to something.
“O-okay.” Draco looked at Harry, who seemed to be as baffled as he was. He squeezed his hand, and Harry squeezed back. “We can do twins,” he said, but it sounded like he was trying to convince himself as much as Draco.
Harry made a soft noise of approval and wrapped his arms around his lithe Omega. “Do you want to start assembling yet?”
‘There’s a good boy…’ Harry panted and he grabbed Draco’s wrist, pulling him forwards and into an embrace while he used his other hand to push Draco’s arse down, trying to bury himself inside as deep as possible.
“We…” Lupin fell silent almost immediately, and Draco was afraid he’d pushed too far, but then he continued, “it was a dark night. He asked for a lighter. I don’t think he realised we were both magical.”
“Technique.” Harry said quickly, turning away from it. “I was wondering if we could learn something from it.”
Draco was still on the ground searching for the missing foxglove and growing more and more frustrated by the sound of it. Harry could hear him growling at Crabbe and Goyle for their carelessness. Holding the slightly crushed purple flowers out, Harry tapped Draco on the shoulder.
They danced mostly in silence, which made Harry anxious. He wasn’t sure if he should attempt to fill the void, to make Draco laugh as the boy from earlier had, or if he should just savour the moment. By the end of the dance, he had only trod on Draco’s foot once, and he had managed not to topple over, so he decided that he should count the dance as a success.
“Hermione is coming over!” Ron hissed, straightening the frightful ruffle on the front of his robes.
“I might not be in love with Christoffer, but at least he likes me. And that is more than I can say for you. So stop. Just stop.” Draco finished, yanking his hand out of Harry’s.
Ron followed him, still muttering about Malfoy. “I swear, if he so much as turns up his nose at one thing!”
“Serve the pompous pureblood right,” Dean said with satisfaction. “Keep him in line while he’s slumming it with us. If he says nothing, then he’s at least got a smidge of decency in him.”
They both settled in against the cushions, their breath slowing as they gradually relaxed. Their feet tangled automatically, pressing against each other for warmth. And perhaps just for the soothing contact that came with knowing that someone else was there.
Swallowing hard, he lowered himself over the railing as he heard the classroom door open. Clinging to the bars, arm muscles already burning with the exertion of holding his entire body weight, he peered up to watch for Harry to come out of the classroom, whereupon Draco would begin screaming for help in his most rescuable fashion. Harry would have to come dashing over and pull Draco up. The motion would throw him into Harry’s arms and the contact would send that delightfully painful jolt through his stomach that was just like . . . like . . .
Harry sat upright, biting back a curse at the pain crawling across his ribs, sure to leave a bruise in its wake. He fumbled for his glasses.
“Fine,” she said, slumping forward to rest her chin in her hands. “So how is ‘Potter’s saviour complex’ advantageous to you?”
“He was better than you, Potter,” Draco sneered. “You wouldn’t be able to keep up with me.” He bit rather viciously into a chocolate frog, as if to punctuate the words.
Draco had come to retrieve his scarf. Harry wanted to turn and run, as if the simple act of being interested in something Draco had created could reveal that he had an interest in him beyond their rivalry. However, it was too late to flee now, Draco had clearly spotted them.
“No,” Goyle said simply. “You’ll just start talking about Potter again. We’re done. You’re going to do something, now.”
“Well,” Goyle said slowly, eyes still fixated on Crabbe, who seemed to be shaking his head again. “Maybe your father doesn’t want you home for the break because of how much you talk about Potter.” Goyle seemed to have to pause and think between each word, so it took him a few minutes to get the entire sentence out, so long that Draco had nearly forgotten what the beginning of it had been by the time it was over.
“What?” Ron asked. “Harry, did something happen while we were gone? What about this snowman do you find so interesting?”
Harry nodded, before turning and heading back to his table, where Weasley was frantically stirring their own cauldron, which was smoking out orange rings.
Ah. So that was it. Malfoy was as distressed by their interactions as Ron was himself. There was a simple answer to this question, but Ron didn’t feel that telling Malfoy that he had done it for Harry was quite fair to Harry, who wasn’t there to speak for himself. “I… because I’m a Gryffindor.” Ron managed.
Harry nodded, extending his hand, watching as Draco’s pale, slender fingers folded into Harry’s own. His hand fit perfectly in Harry’s, and all the dizzying nausea that had come with seeing him dance with the boy was gone, swept away by Draco’s proximity.
“Harry, what are you doing?” Ron yelped, as Harry stepped directly on his feet. All of the concentration he’d had when he’d danced with Draco was gone.
They shrugged, expressions blank. Draco suppressed a groan, raking an exasperated hand through his hair. “Honestly, you two, any sort of response will do!”
Draco’s eyes widened as Harry approached. He nodded a hello, and pretended to be busy with the arrangement of drinks on the refreshment table. “Malfoy.” Harry said, trying desperately to figure out what he should say. They hadn’t actually spoken since the incident. His mind scrambling, Harry said the first thing that he thought of that actually resembled an English sentence. “Saw you dancing. Can’t get a better partner than that? He had two left feet.”
The group of them moved away after that, leaving their snowman standing alone. Harry, unable to help himself, got to his feet and made his way over. He wasn’t sure why, but he felt a need to see it up close. Ron and Hermione rejoined him at that point, and walked with him, Ron loudly complaining that Hermione had broken his nose. Harry glanced at him quickly, and once he had ascertained that Ron was fine, continued to ignore him.
Stomach sinking, Draco finally looked at the Gryffindor list. Sure enough, there was his name, the letters seeming to taunt him.
The dull sound of a Tempus charm rang in Draco’s ears and he rolled over, intending to shove his pillow over his head, but instead suddenly falling. Tangled in his duvet, pillow slipping down on top of him, Draco found himself on the cold, hard floor of the Gryffindor Common room, looking up at the couch where Potter was still sound asleep, even through the piercing alarm.
Harry didn’t find it even remotely amusing. Hagrid was frantically pulling the kneazles off Draco, one after another, his movements becoming more frenzied as it became apparent that they were just rejoining the fray as soon as Hagrid released them. No one moved to help Hagrid, everyone was too shocked to assist. Harry, realizing that something had to be done, took off running.
“Well it behaves like a cat,” Ron said. “Here comes Malfoy now. Let’s see if he can find a way to get injured this time.”
Shocked, Draco glanced up to see Harry Potter staring at him, their noses barely two inches apart as the Gryffindor wrapped his arms more firmly around Draco’s middle, holding him above the ice. Automatically, Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck, barely breathing as he stared up into his green eyes. His glasses were smudged with melted snowflakes, but even with the obstruction, his beautiful eyes shone through.
A wave of panic coursed through Harry's veins, poisoning him, sending a sudden paralysis through his legs. He felt rooted to the spot, unable to move, and unable to help even if he could. Draco was out of reach. He was going to plummet to the ground to lie there shattered on the stones far below. He was going to die, and Harry couldn't do a thing about it.
So this was how it was going to be. Back to cool steady enmity like last night never happened. Like they hadn’t slept curled up against each other for most of the night. Like their sleepy civility had never existed.
A list of things that he had been too stupid to tell Draco attacked Harry like Cornish pixies, pinching and poking at his soul with sharp jabs. Harry had never told him he was sorry for all the cruel things he’d said, though they had mainly been in retaliation. Harry had never told him that he liked him, though Draco hadn’t given him much of a chance. Harry had never told Draco that he would do anything for him. Though that couldn’t be true because here they were, and he was unable to save him. Draco would die, and Harry would be left with a list of unspoken truths. Things that he should have said before it was too late.
“Excuse me?” He said, incredulous, heart racing dangerously. He turned to face the other two boys head on, their group blocking almost the entire span of the hallway, forcing other students to squeeze past uncomfortably, limbs and textbooks knocking into the group of Slytherins.
So when the day of the Yule Ball arrived, Draco had his entire dormitory to himself to slowly go through the well-practiced motions of clothing himself in the dress-robes he usually wore for fancy dinners his mother held at the Manor, dinners where he was expected to be charming and witty and to be the model of a perfect son who would someday make a perfect husband to one of their friends’ perfect pureblood daughters, with whom he was expected to breed perfect pureblood children.
“Who, Krum? Don’t tell me you’ve fallen for him too.” Ron said, angrily watching Hermione and Krum waltz past.
Slytherins seemed to have a different approach to building snowmen than Gryffindors. Harry had built snowmen with his friends before, and it was a lot of yelling and laughing, falling over, dropping bits, and eventually ending up with a slightly lopsided, but impressively large construction. Slytherins on the other hand, seemed to hand out roles and to take it far too seriously. Harry could see Crabbe and Goyle rolling a base, while Pansy Parkinson made them stop periodically so that she could measure it. Draco was standing nearby, and though Harry couldn’t make out what he was saying, it was obvious that he was directing the others.
Under Harry’s guidance, Draco drank some water, ate a few grapes and a power bar and washed himself off with heavy reluctance. The fabric of the washcloth felt too rough against his skin, and he was so hot that it felt as if the water evaporated against his skin. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he knew drinking, eating, upkeeping basic hygiene was important but - all he wanted was to dive back into the nest and let Harry fuck him silly again.
They were quiet in a comfortable silence for a while, in which time Draco drank another three glasses of wine.
‘Do you realise that this encompasses I also need to see if there has been any form of physical abuse?’ Mr Potter looked straight at Draco as he said so. Draco could feel the colour drain from his face. ‘I am not allowed to undress in the presence of someone else without explicit permission, sir,’ he said uncomfortably.
Softly, Hermione placed her arm back on his shoulders. “Do you have any questions about it? I’m not an expert but there is someone at the ORO I could ask to provide some leaflets. And if you’re really serious I could reach out to St Mungo’s to see if they have information, too.”
His legs felt like they were made out of cooked spaghetti, and he dangerously swung from side to side as he got up. Still not processing what was happening, he meekly allowed Hermione to support him and move him towards the fireplace.
‘I don’t know, he never claimed me.’ Draco stepped into the shower cabin and relaxed his muscles. ‘Oh sweet Merlin,’ he whimpered as he felt himself leaking, the mixture of cum and slick trickling down his thighs. It was an oddly arousing sensation.
Harry blinked. “I’m… we’re going to be parents.” He sounded astonished, and Draco laughed a light, bubbly laugh. “We are.” Bending his knees a little so he came down to Harry’s height, he ran his fingers through the Alpha’s hair. Harry’s eyes were glassy.
‘Yes…’ Draco muttered, realising that he would not be able to persuade her to do otherwise. Underneath the table, Adelaide grabbed his hand and squeezed it supportively. ‘That sounds like a good plan,’ she softly said.
From that moment onwards, everything happened in a blur. They entered the OR and Healer Roberts put up a screen with Bella, explaining that it would be better if Draco didn’t see how they were going to cut him open.
Draco patted his ever-flat stomach and downed his glass, which magically refilled itself. “Nope. Lotsa sex, though.”
Nothing was said whilst they waited, although Harry glanced at Draco a few times. Draco felt his mates gaze, but kept his eyes firmly on the tempus. When it hit zero, he cast his eyes down to the table, looking at the test.
‘No!’ Adelaide and Draco said un unison, making Draco add, ‘I think we need to make teams. I’m team werewolf.’
Draco remembered the burning need in his blood, the itch, the pain, how much he needed to be filled… ‘Okay… I can… understand why you did that…’
Draco shifted his hips, thinking about what Harry had done so far. ‘I think so.’ He shifted again and moaned a little.
‘Don’t be,’ he interrupted. ‘I would have kept on refusing of you hadn’t… It could have ended badly.’
“Thank you.” Her tone remained low, but she sounded happy. “When all the paperwork comes through and everything is official, Molly promised we’re going to try…” She shifted her gaze across the room, to Alexander, and Draco understood. “It would be lovely for Alexander to have a little sister,” he said, lowering his tone even more. It was clear to him that Adelaide did not want anyone else to hear - Arthur was obviously aware of the situation, but Draco assumed Adelaide felt awkward with Ron around.
‘I have it,’ Hermione waved with the paper. Draco stepped to her and accepted the paper from her with trembling hands.
Healer Roberts nodded again. “It sounds to me like you are fertile, though of course I can’t conclude that with certainty without further research.” She nodded once more, as if agreeing with a plan she hadn’t spoken out yet. “So unless you have any questions I’d like to test you two on both fertility and the strength of your magical core and depending on the outcome of those tests we can decide what to do next.”
“I’ll drop you off at Crossroads and pick you up again in two hours, okay?” Harry asked and he turned his head a little to look at Draco, eyeing him worriedly.
But if Harry had such plans, it wasn’t visible. He got up and plugged in the TV. “What do you want to see?”
Life had changed and was still changing and even though it wasn’t perfect – no real life was perfect anyway – it was enough for him.
Just as Harry began to relax again, he spotted a boy heading in Draco’s direction. A tall, muscular boy, in dress robes with a Durmstrang crest on his sleeve. Harry would have assumed that the boy was one of Krum’s friends, making his way over to say hello. But the boy didn’t stop to talk to Krum, instead he made his way over to Draco.
Malfoy opened his mouth, looking as though he had a thousand words he wanted to toss in Harry’s face, but changed his mind. “Oh, screw that,” he muttered, and tugged Harry against him into a first kiss that was worth all the jinxed beds in the world.
“Hermione does not have extra, because she measured the right amount to take out of the supply cupboard.” Hermione hissed back from where she and Neville were stirring their potion. She kept having to intervene when Neville tried to add incorrect ingredients. “Go get it yourself, since the two of you were too incompetent to measure the correct amount.”
If Harry had been able to look away, he would have taken a moment to collect himself. Instead, he stayed there, watching, absorbing the sight and wanting to melt away more than he had ever wanted anything in his life. Finally, the last, torturously slow notes of the song faded away. The boy took Draco’s arm and led him back to the refreshments table. Harry waited, his breath catching in his throat, praying that the boy would walk away.
“What the hell, Malfoy?” Potter said, his tone oddly soft, as though he was saying “Do you love me?”, a comparison Draco hastily shoved to the side, for fear that yet again he would speak aloud his thoughts and he didn’t think that even he wanted to know what his answer would be to such a question.
“I’m going to dance with him again.” Harry said firmly, as if he could make it happen through sheer conviction. “Just wait and see.”
So Draco just stood there, breath slowly slipping away from him as he was swallowed by Potter’s green gaze, as words slowly began to spin out of his mouth in an almost dream-like haze. “I was wondering, well, you see, what I want is, well, what I’ve actually wanted for a very long time, odd as though it may seem, and believe me, I have tried to make it seem less odd, but it really never won’t be, because it’s you and me, and you’re, well, you, and I’m definitely me, although maybe perhaps not at this minute, even though I always feel the most myself when I’m around you, Potter, which is why I want you to come to the Yule Ball with me, so we can be around each other without killing each other for once and I can just stand there and look at you without feeling guilty and my insides being twisted up in knots, except they probably still will be, because you’re gorgeous and I’m- oh, shit,” Draco faltered, whispering the ending obscenity to himself as he realized that he had speaking aloud for the past minute and that, yes, that frozen look on Potter’s beautiful face was because he had heard absolutely everything Draco had just said.
“How are you, Harry?” Ron asked loudly, hoping to break the silence. He didn’t think he had ever been this uncomfortable in his life.
“I like you.” Harry wanted to say. Instead he finally lost the battle to his sarcastic streak. “That’s a first.” He snorted.
“I’ve never seen a more pathetic excuse for a Slytherin in my life.” An upper year Gryffindor said, loud enough for Harry, and probably the entire Hall to hear.
“They’re classified at an XXX by the ministry. They’ll only attack if they sense ill will.” Hagrid said. “No need to fret, Mr. Malfoy. Yer perfectly safe.” He picked up one of the kneazles as if to illustrate his point, cradling it gently to his broad chest. “Why don’t yeh come up here and hold one?” He offered.
Hagrid began the lesson shortly afterwards, and Harry quickly forgot about Draco as he listened to Hagrid’s awkward explanation of kneazle mating rituals. It wasn’t until Hagrid was explaining ministry classifications to them that Harry was reminded of Draco and his newfound fear of magical creatures.
And so Draco attempted to focus on Christoffer, laughing when he made a joke and even coming up with a few of his own witticisms. He tried to ask polite questions about his family, and apologized when he slipped off into thought and missed one of Christoffer’s own questions about Draco, something which occurred far more often than Draco liked to admit. Although he liked to admit even less that the thoughts he was slipping into always seemed to circulate around a certain messy haired Gryffindor.
“We haven’t danced into anything yet,” Draco said, “and you miraculously haven’t stepped on my toes either. Perhaps you’re a better dancer than I gave you credit for.”
“I knew Potter would ask him eventually.” McGonagall said, ignoring Snape’s comment. “He’s got too much Gryffindor courage to avoid it. It was bound to drive him to action.”
“What are you doing?” Harry whispered furiously. He was caught between wanting to hex Malfoy within an inch of his life and lie back down and curl up against his shoulder. It all made him feel terribly dizzy.
As the students at the desks around him rose, Harry joined them, hastily gathering books from the desk and starting towards the door while Hermione called after him to wait up. He ignored her. If he waited for Hermione, he'd be there all day.
After the incident in the snow, Harry had been avoiding the subject of Draco Malfoy at all costs. It was becoming impossible to ignore the fact that he had a crush, and the last thing he needed was for Ron or Hermione to comment on the incident. As much as Harry relished the idea of being Draco’s Knight in Shining Armor, it was not a reputation that he currently wanted to have.
“Who knows?” Ron said darkly. “I wouldn’t put it past him to do it on purpose just so he could get to you. Honestly, Harry, it’s for your own protection! If he’s being poked and prodded, then he’ll be too preoccupied to come after you!”
They were both so caught up in the discussion that they didn’t notice a third figure creeping up on them. Dumbledore stealthily intruded on the conversation, listening in until he realized what they were talking about. “Kiss? What kiss?” He
Harry grumbled an apology, sneaking a glance over his shoulder at Draco. Draco was focused on his potion, stirring it while Crabbe and Goyle hunted the surrounding desks for something.
“Kneazles, Ron,” Hermione said happily, bending to stroke one of the creatures on the head. It squinted and pushed its head up into her hand, purring appreciatively. “Not cats.”
“Well, you’ll never have to put up with my terrible dancing again.” Harry said, hoping that Draco would correct him. He’d tell him that he didn’t mind the terrible dancing, no matter how crushed his toes might be by the end of the night.
They dipped their heads, not daring to meet his burning gaze, muttering something unintelligible from the Slytherin table.
Harry turned his attentions back to Draco after that. He didn’t even notice when Parvati got up to dance with a Beauxbatons student. He didn’t notice that she never came back to sit with him either. The next thing he was conscious of other than Draco was a strangled noise from Ron.
Harry wasn’t jealous of Pansy. He didn’t have any reason to be. He didn’t like Draco, and Draco didn’t like him, so neither of them could possibly be jealous. Nevertheless, Harry decided he would keep an eye on the couple. That way if they were dancing too close, or tried to sneak off somewhere, he could get them in trouble. He was pretty sure he had spotted Filch lurking by the entrance, periodically yelling at students who tried to sneak out of the hall past him.
Harry’s eyes slowly fluttered open. The sun was only just starting to creep over the horizon and the room was still mostly dark. Luxuriating in the realization that he still had a few hours of sleep, Harry turned over, curling into the warmth of his bed.
The space between him and the desk closed rapidly. Snape turned to look at him, frowning down his nose at Harry. “What is it, Potter?”
He felt his grip loosening even further and he closed his eyes tightly, preparing to fall away into oblivion.
“It’s nice to meet you, Remus,” Draco answered, keeping his town quiet and light. It felt like anything might tick the other man off again, and if he could prevent Lupin from fleeing, he would. “Can you stand?” He slowly pulled back his hand and opened the arm loosely curled around Lupin even more.
So, how was it? I my opinion, this was sort off fluffy. I'm still really struggling to write Draco properly because there are so many aspects to his personality. He wants to be really proper, but at the same time, his body (instincts) tell him that there is really no reason to be like that because Harry already is his Alpha, so why bother with the formalities? Molly is still super protective though.
The first two weeks were fun, because Harry took Draco out into Muggle London all the time and Draco loved sleeping in Harry’s bed and waking up intertwined with his Alpha.
Not in the mood for talking - his throat felt like sandpaper - he eyed Harry warily as the Alpha flitted around the kitchen, making tea, oatmeal, and finally setting down a new test in front of Draco.
Every muscle in his body ached. Even moving his fingers made him moan in pain. He wanted to lie in bed forever and die here. Right now would be a great time to die. No-one wanted him. He was alone and he would be forever.
Day five was the day he made lists on everything else he needed for the bottom two floors and forced Ron and Hermione to shop for everything.
‘Yes. But now she’s tainted. No-one will have her now,’ his mother responded coolly. The threat in it was clear: whoever was going to own Draco, he was not to make such a mess as Adelaide had made.
Draco twisted his body, pressing down against Harry’s fingers. “All for you,” he panted, “all for you.”
Harry slowed his fingers a little and kept on sucking, making soft, eager noises as he milked Draco dry. He very slowly pulled his fingers back and moved back up. When Harry made to kiss Draco, he moved his head away, so that Harry’s lips ended up on his cheek.
Harry add his last finger to the mix and stretching his hole wide. ‘Please please please,’ Draco breathed. Harry didn’t respond, kept on moving his fingers gently and Draco, not knowing what else to do to entice his Alpha into
“Robards has been hounding me to come back. They’re short on hands.” Harry shifted, slinging his arm around Draco’s waist and keeping him close. “It’s been great, being at home with you, but…”
He tried to open his eyes. ‘Sorry… so sorry…’ he mumbled with difficulty. He wanted to be better, he wanted to be better for his Alpha, even for the beta that stood next to his bed.
Draco lifted Alexander against his chest protectively. “No,” he said defensively. “Adelaide dropped by. She’s downstairs. She needed some sleep and asked me to watch Alexander for a few hours.”
‘I told you, it’s Ikea,’ Harry said. He grabbed onto Draco’s hand. ‘It’s pretty big and I don’t want you to get lost, so just stay close to me okay?’
She touched him gently, in a motherly fashion. ‘Oh dear, are you still tired? You can go back to sleep if you want to, honey, I’ll be right here when you awake again, okay?’
Draco stood in front of the bathroom mirror in Harry’s bathroom, pressing his fingers over the fading bite mark on his throat, trying to hide his disappointment. It had been horrifying to tell Mrs Weasley about Harry’s biting kink, but when he’d gotten home with a bite mark that would not fade, there hadn’t been much of a choice other than telling her.
‘Oh,’ Draco said, surprised. Alphas usually weren’t the type for domestic duties, but then again, the only Beta in their household was Ron. ‘Don’t you have house elves?’
Harry sat back down and Draco followed suit, not bothering with the complicated sitting technique Miss Fawley had taught him, but still gracefully so.
‘Do you think so?’ Draco mused, ‘I don’t think most Omegas know their Alpha very well at all, even when they do have children.’
“Maybe I am,” Harry admitted with a wide, uncaring smile, before bending down and finally sucking Draco’s cock into his mouth. It made Draco gasp for breath and his hips stuttered forward with a moan. Harry’s fingers held his hips in place though, and he slowly set a tempo.
The witch thumbed through a notebook on the counter, mumbling to herself. Draco took the time to assess the establishment a bit more, noting the aged look of the exposed brick and the heavy use of velvet for the furniture. He would never use velvet upholstery for his house, even though it could work in some rooms in Grimmauld Place. It was too tacky.
Draco looked at his mother for help. How was he supposed to explain those? It was one of the forbidden subjects. His Alpha had ordered him to never talk of it.
I can't reveal the title of next week's chapter (it would give you too much information) but I promise it'll be juicy.
“I love you so much, Draco,” Harry managed in between his pants. Draco brought himself back upright again, moving with more force, straining his already tired muscles, now working towards his climax more than paying attention to his partner. Harry happily accommodated this and grabbed onto Draco’s hips, helping him make more momentum and they moved in unison.
‘Uhm, not that many,’ Draco remembered. ‘We were put together at age. I think there were eight in my class, six in the one below and… nine or ten in the youngest group. Why?’
Draco could read the love and warmth Molly felt for Adelaide by just looking at her, and he squeezed Harry’s hand. The rest of the room remained quiet for what felt like too long. He cleared his throat. “That’s wonderful, I’m so happy for you.”
Draco looked at her, remembering that she, too, had ordered him around, even if it was only once. ‘Well, I…’ He hesitated. Heats were definitely one of the things you were not supposed to talk about with other Alphas and he’d already committed a sort-off crime when he told Mrs Weasley. ‘When I stayed over the other night and Harry and I got in a fight…’
Quickly, before he’d lose courage, Draco snatched the thing from the kitchen table, uncorked it and downed the potion. He swallowed it quickly, without tasting much, but made a face anyway. “It tastes green.”
It was dark in the memory wherein Draco had landed and he needed a minute to realise he stood in Harry’s bedroom. A strip of light shone into the room via the door, that was open just a bit.
‘We’re going upstairs now,’ Hermione told Draco and she placed her hand in his back, giving a gentle push towards the stairs. They followed the memory-trio up to the floor where Hermione and Ron lived, and then up to Ginny’s floor. ‘Pay attention,’ Hermione said, ‘this is important.’
The crowd around Harry had been shouting, crying out at the sight. Suddenly they went very quiet, the atmosphere shifting. They seemed to be collectively holding their breath as a figure appeared above Draco, somebody carefully climbing over the side of the stairs to reach him. Harry held his breath with them, watching as his best friend joined Draco on the precipice, cautiously holding on to the outside of the railing at an angle that allowed them to help Draco.
Draco fought to retain his composure, wanting to display his usual sneer, say something biting, and walk away before he lost his head completely and allowed himself to get caught on Potter’s gaze. Which is of course what happened, because apparently Draco had done something to offend some deity up above who had now decided to make his life as painful as possible.
If Ron fell too, then Harry would never be able to forgive himself. His lungs were burning in rebellion against him, demanding that he let in oxygen again. His legs were shaking so badly he thought he might collapse. Two of the most important people in his life were about to die. Their safety relied on Ron’s ability to hold them both up, and Harry felt this was a slim hope.
“Ask him,” Goyle boomed and picked Draco up by the back of his robes and fairly flung him into the nearing group of Gryffindors. Draco smacked into Potter’s shoulder and grabbed a fistful of his robes in order to avoid completely losing his balance and falling onto the ground. Which meant that he was soon face to face with Harry Potter himself and his sidekicks, all of whom had drawn their wands and were now pointing them menacingly at Draco.
Ron couldn’t contain himself any longer. Here was Draco Malfoy fussing over Harry Potter’s papercut, while Harry just let him do it. They were both idiots. “Well.” He said, setting down the piece of toast he had been clutching. “I can see I’m not needed here. I’ll leave you two to it.”
“I thought Slytherins valued leadership and cunning, not nepotism and whining. Imagine running home with every little complaint. It’s a miracle he’s survived this many years of school with that approach.” Someone else chimed in.
The same nauseous tingle crept up through Harry’s midriff to engulf his heart. He was spared from having to respond by Ron’s strangled: “What? Who the hell are you going with?”
Inside the dorm, Malfoy was already dressed in his uniform, and knotting his tie with expert hands. Harry felt an odd pang seeing Malfoy’s hair tamed from its adorable bedhead and coiffed back as properly as always.
“I told you why.” Harry snapped, throwing a random ingredient into the cauldron without bothering to look at the instructions Snape had given them.
Gradually, everyone quieted down, the room filled with only the soft sounds of breathing and slight snores from Longbottom.
“Well, the professors said we can’t directly cast spells on them, but what if we did something to the bed?”
Ron pulled away from her as if burnt. “Viktor?” He hissed. “I’m surprised he hasn't asked you to call him Vicky yet.”
“I always knew Slytherins were bloody cowards, but I thought they had a little more self respect than to be as much of a snivelling coward as he is. I suppose that comes with being a
Draco’s heart was pounding furiously, although whether it was from the adrenaline brought on by his near fall or Harry’s achingly close proximity, he didn’t like to venture a guess.
As Draco peered over the side of the staircase, he wondered if this had been such a good idea. Yes, Crabbe and Goyle were waiting right below him with a charmed mattress, so that if he did happen to fall, he would be perfectly fine, but it still felt rather wrong to be about to climb over the rail of a staircase to hang over a twenty foot drop. Hormones, Draco decided, were very dangerous things.
