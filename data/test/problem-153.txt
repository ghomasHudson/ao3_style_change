Draco coughed, sitting up a little and playing with the glass in his hands. “Blaise” He spoke with fake ease.

“I’m sure”
Harry glanced at Malfoy and saw his cheeks were tinted pink and his neck was flushed but Harry couldn’t understand why. Complete the bond? He was about to ask when Dumbledore continued, “For now we must talk about what this all means for the two of you. We have set up a private room- “
Draco was struggling too. More so than Harry. Any time that thought entered his head it was immediately attacked with strong denial and shoved into the farthest corner of Draco’s mind. It was just the bond making him want Potter, nothing else. Not the sparkle in Harry’s eyes or the fullness of Harry’s bottom lip. No.
Draco nodded. “I think I know why you felt like that and I didn’t”
Thirty feet.

Harry sighed but kept walking, entering their rooms. “It’s nothing Draco, come on”
“Merlin. Yes, Potter, it was a joke” said Malfoy with a roll of his eyes.
Harry gasped quietly, his eyes fluttering as he pressed his lips to Draco's. It was a soft but firm kiss, just lips on lips. Draco broke away first, his thumb running over Harry's bottom lip once more. He then smiled softly.
“Damn it Malfoy! Why is it every time you get close to finally trusting me you close yourself off? Talk to me” Harry demanded.
The silence was starting to drive Harry mad, yet he didn’t want to talk to Malfoy. Every time they seemed to be making some type of progress something would go wrong. Just a glance at the wrong time could start something and despite only having spent about 24 hours by Malfoy’s side, Harry was sick of feeling on edge.
“So” Harry sipped at his butterbeer, “getting to know each other” he smiled.
Harry shrugged, “Must be important. Maybe he’s found something helpful about the bond” he spoke as he grabbed his school robe from his trunk and threw it on.
“I’m not lying” Draco defended himself, “Pansy and I put on a front, we never dated” He smirked at Harry’s surprised face. “So” he continued “Never have I ever kissed a Weasley”
“Wait, I didn’t mean to upset you” Harry tried again, standing up quickly.
Draco’s eyes locked onto Harry’s. He saw everything he needed and more. Draco leaned forward slowly, eyes dropping to Harry’s lips before he captured them carefully with his own. The kiss was soft, the gentle push of lips against lips. Draco was testing the waters.
“Of course. You see, many generations ago there was a ritual that the Malfoy family would perform in which they would bond to their partners. They would brew a potion of devotion until close to completion but instead of adding the final few ingredients they would pour the blood of the
Harry visibly grimaced, “That’s a long story that one” he tried to cover up with a soft laugh. “Probably best for another day”
They both took their wands and put them on the table before Harry picked up the scalpel and released Draco’s hand. He sliced down the middle of his palm and passed Draco the knife who did the same with a slight wince.
“Harry, we should… you know” he trailed off, blushing under the scrutiny of Harry’s gaze.
They summoned a house-elf and ate lunch in comfortable silence, only broken by the sounds of cutlery on their plates.
“You really want to?” Draco asked with a small tilt of his head.
Harry came back and smiled. “We can go. Madam Pomfrey told me about a passage that leads to our rooms. Should be empty”
“Come in boys, come in” Dumbledore called when Harry knocked on the office door. “Lemon drop?” He offered. Both boys politely refused.
Harry had to think for a moment, there were a few comments this morning. None of them were pleasant but Harry knew which one Draco was talking about.
Connected to the bedroom was a genuinely nice bathroom, almost as good as the prefect bathroom but not nearly as big, a more condensed version if you will. The house-elves arrived with Harry and Malfoy’s trunks during their tour and the realisation hit Harry hard. It was like the air had been squeezed from his lungs when he realised that his late nights playing exploding snap or wizard’s chess with Ron were over. This was his life now. A life now glued to Malfoy’s side.
“What did Granger want?” Asked Malfoy, his book resting on his knees.
“Sorry, I don’t…”
Draco could see Harry stood staring out of the corner of his eye. “Like what you see?” He teased.
Harry looked over Malfoy. He looked exhausted, most likely how Harry looked. His eyes were red, and he had a faint purple mark on his right cheek. The sight made Harry feel incredibly guilty which surprised him. It wasn’t like Malfoy didn’t give as good as he got. But despite the bruise being almost fully healed, the mark was large and most likely very painful.
“I’d still like to know” said Harry.
“What did you do?” Malfoy asked having heard Potter gasp beside him.
Thank you for reading! <3
“Because you don’t get it!” Draco suddenly shouted. “You don’t! You want to know why the bond isn’t driving me mad with the thought of you? Because I’ve had years of practice!”
“Like they’ll care” Draco muttered, tugging gently at his hair.
He sighed, “That wasn’t all” Draco said quietly.
And when he looked up at Harry, an onslaught of emotions attacked him. Relief, joy, excitement, lust. It consumed Draco and he let it and when he saw Harry’s eyes widen, he knew Harry felt it too. Harry could feel the emotions rolling off of Draco and hitting him like a strong wave. He couldn’t think straight. Harry didn’t know how he knew that these were Draco’s feelings and not his own. But he did.
“No as long as the bond is strong it should be fine… I think” The last two words were mumbled but Harry caught them.
“Potter” Malfoy called, coming into the bedroom. “Potter! You need to get up” He tried again but instead of making any attempt at waking up, Harry just grunted and rolled onto his stomach. Malfoy considered leaving and letting their guest wake him up but suddenly had a better idea. With a sharp tug, Malfoy ripped the duvet off of Harry. What Malfoy hadn’t realised was just how tangled Harry was and so ended being flipped off the bed with force.
“Who?” Immediately fell from Harry's lips, sounding too eager but he couldn’t deny that he wanted to know.
“Because Potter, unlike you, I would like to stay on top of work and not treat this as if it were a holiday” Draco shifted, his skin tingling with Harry so close beside him.
“I, um, I thought maybe teaching. I don’t know if I could take being out there anymore. I don’t want to fight. But I would be happy to train people, teach what I could about what I know. I learnt a lot while on the run” Harry had never said it out loud before, speaking only solidified more to himself how much he wanted it.
“Shut up Malfoy, she cares. I don’t expect you to understand that”
Thank you to those who have commented! It really means a lot. Here is chapter two. Enjoy :)
“So that’s how you managed to get around without being caught all these years” Draco stated when they were walking down the path that lead to Hogsmeade. “I always did wonder”
Glancing at Malfoy, Harry took a chance at conversation “How long have you been up?”
“I thought you’d prefer me without them” Harry muttered, looking at his feet.
“You should” He sat down next to Draco, taking his book from him. “You should treat it as a holiday. At least a little. I don’t want to fall behind either but come on, at least relax a little”
Draco tore his eyes away from his book and fixed Harry with a steady glare. “I am not here for your entertainment Potter. Go find something to do”
Once he had calmed down, he left the bathroom and searched for a quill, ink, and some parchment to write to his mother. Draco knew she had most likely been already told but he knew she would want to hear it from him. So, he wrote. And wrote. He wrote until his wrist began to hurt. Once he started, he couldn’t stop. He ranted and raved about how unfair life was, how he couldn’t believe his bad luck, how out of all the people it just had to have been Saint Potter. But in the end, he felt clearer. Felt calmer. He ripped up the letter, not wanting his mother to worry and wrote another. This one was shorter and when he read it back to himself, he sounded almost confident, letting his mother know not to worry and that he would try to keep her updated.
Draco tugged at Harry’s hair gently and was rewarded with a sweet moan. The slow dance of their tongues was slowly becoming a battle for control. Harry’s hands slid up Draco’s back and pulled him closer, gripping his waist firmly. Draco tugged at Harry’s hair just a little harder and Harry groaned louder, breaking off the kiss and placing open mouthed kisses down Draco’s throat.
To Harry’s shock, Malfoy found himself blushing “That’s because they are” Draco managed to say calmly but then stuttered his way through the rest “Strengthening the bond will involve us having to spend time in close quarters and getting along whereas, um, completing the, um, bond… Well that involves a more intimate act” Draco refused to look Potter in the eye instead, he was picking at the rug under them both.
Disappearing into the bedroom, Harry wrote a letter back. He didn’t want them to worry and he told them that. It wasn’t that bad he guessed, compared to other things he'd been through and he told them that. He promised he would write when he needed to talk and that he would try to see them soon. He also thanked Hermione for the research and Ron too because he knew that Ron would be just as deep in those books as Hermione if it meant helping Harry. He did love his friends.
“Don’t sound so shocked” Draco almost snapped.
“Potter, I swear to Salazar” Draco stormed in after Harry. “Just tell me!”
The snitch, having got annoyed at being ignored, flew right above Draco's shoulder and off to the left and Harry was gone. His heart was beating loudly, his hands were clammy, and he was unbelievably frustrated. Draco’s taunting was driving him insane. How was he so calm?
With that Harry released the snitch and mounted his broom. He was gone before Draco could even release the breath he’d been holding.
“Draco-“
Draco hesitated but took Harry’s hand, shaking it firmly. He gave Harry a small smile “Might as well try”
Draco smiled to himself. He could definitely get used to the power of ruffling Potter up like that. He took a seat and looked over to find Harry where he left him. “Well, are you going to stand there all day or are you going to join me and get some work done?”
Draco chuckled, “Yes it was” and Harry blushed. Draco traced his finger along Harry’s bottom lip slowly, “It’s nice to know you aren’t completely unaffected by me” he teased.
“It was my dad’s. Dumbledore gave it to me my first Christmas at Hogwarts” Harry said, smiling as he remembered his first proper Christmas.
With a smile, Draco turned away from the mirror and looked at Harry. “Wow” he chuckled, “You clean up good”
Being in the air always made Draco feel free. Even during his darkest moments, when he flew, he could forget it all. Even if it was only for an hour or so.
Harry felt optimistic. His good mood still hadn’t left him, and he couldn’t lie that he’d enjoyed working with Draco all morning. Draco was a good teacher. He had tested Harry on topics and happily read over his notes, helping correct mistakes or, surprisingly, praise Harry for good work. And Harry didn’t mind it one bit. He offered to read Draco’s work too but after he read the first piece, he realised that Draco didn’t need anyone to check his writing. His work was beautifully written, and Harry realised just how intelligent Draco was.
Oh, Merlin. Harry bloody Potter. Draco couldn’t stop thinking about him. ‘It’s the bond’ Draco repeatedly tried to convince himself whilst dressing in the bathroom. ‘The bond is forcing you to look at him differently. That is all. Of course, you don’t like Potter.’ But Draco knew the truth. He knew how the bond worked. It only amplified feelings already there. Still, it didn’t stop him from trying to convince himself otherwise.
“How about a game?”
“On the first day?” Harry asked, confused.
Harry smirked and leaned in to close the gap, but Draco had other plans and had Harry on his back, pinned to the sofa in seconds. Harry gasped. He bit his lip to hold back a moan at being manhandled so easily.
Now Harry was ready, the nerves kicked in. This could go very wrong on many different levels.
Draco nodded slowly. He knew Ha-Potter was right, but he was still afraid.
Harry sat there; shell shocked. He knew he should have been feeling rejected, hurt even. But he didn’t. He didn’t think that was a rejection. Something told him it wasn’t. It didn’t feel like one. He felt his adrenaline slowly leaving his system and he lent back, covering his eyes with his forearm, and remembering Draco’s soft blush, his slight breathlessness, and his lingering gaze on Harry’s lips. No. It wasn’t a rejection, Harry concluded with a smile.
“Theodore?” Draco shook his head “No. Definitely not Theo” He almost laughed at the idea.
There was no teasing or judging in Harry’s tone and Draco fought back that ridiculous jealousy. “It’s dumb”
Harry quickly brushed his shirt back down and Draco could feel himself burning up when Madame Pomfrey slowly entered.
Malfoy didn’t feel good. His chest felt tight. His head started to swim. His breath was too short, too quick. He was panicking. The news had hit him now. Hearing that he was bonded to Potter for life and seeing the evidence were two very different things. What little respect the wizarding world still had for him would be gone once the news spread. He could see the Prophet now. ‘Death Eater Bonded to the Chosen One.’ People would think of it as some sort of plot, revenge maybe. Their poor Golden Boy condemned to a life of misery by his side. Pomfrey asked them to get along. That was impossible. Malfoy tried many years ago to be friends, but Potter made it very clear where his loyalty lay. Still, what was he going to do? Spend every minute of his life sneering? Draco was good but not that good. He would crumble eventually and then what? Potter would see through his facade. This wasn’t going to work, he couldn’t do this, he-
Luckily, Madame Pomfrey did leave rather swiftly, just giving some last-minute advice on how to get through the next few days while the bond settled down. Harry hardly listened.
Draco shook his head, “You can’t expect yourself to be able to control it”
“You had every right to” muttered Draco, feeling incredibly nauseous.
Soft light filled the main room from the closed window by the bookshelf and Harry’s heart jumped into his throat, remembering where he was. That’s when he noticed the damp spot on the back of his neck due to a very hot, shallow breath behind him and something hard pushing into his lower back.
Harry felt a rush of confidence and took a sudden step forward. “I will. Once you say my name”
“What’s wrong?” He asked, finishing his glass of water.
“Fuck” Draco muttered; his body exhausted after such a powerful orgasm.
“I’m not” Harry smiled, gently taking Draco’s hand. “You’d be amazing. I mean, with a brain like yours, you could do anything you wanted.”
“Harry” Harry corrected, only an inch between them.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So, this is your plan then? Sit here until you crisp like bacon?” Malfoy sneered “We need to…” He faltered. What did they need to do? Talk? He almost scoffed at the idea. Draco had stormed in here with no plan of action, he just felt he had to do… something. He sighed and tried to think logically again, tried clearing his head like he had when he was in the bedroom.
Harry blushed, tugging at his sleeves gently. He had chosen a blue button up shirt with grey pants and a matching blazer. In comparison to Draco, he felt very self-conscious indeed. Draco looked incredible.
“Mr Potter, where is your wand?” Madam Pomfrey suddenly asked.
Harry sat himself down and began to think long and hard. There was only one way they could get themselves past this bit. They had to be completely honest with each other. Harry understood now how much effort it must have taken for Malfoy to come and talk to him and Harry had essentially shot him down. He felt incredibly guilty. Draco was trying and Harry knew that whatever it took for Malfoy to start that conversation was gone after Harry’s little speech. This time it was up to Harry.
“Let’s go to bed”
This just made Draco laugh harder. It took a while for him to gain composure, to catch his breath. “You prude” Draco chuckled.
“Not much. It isn’t a particularly hard ritual”
Draco gently gripped Harry’s chin and placed a soft kiss on Harry’s jaw. Then another. He began peppering soft, slow kisses along Harry’s jaw, burning a slow trail up to his cheek. Draco did the same to the other side of Harry’s face.
“I then spent this morning speaking to both Madame Pomfrey and Professor McGonagall, and we have decided that the best course of action from here is to have you both reperform the bonding ritual correctly. This should hopefully right the bonding process”
“Draco I’m bored” he whined, throwing his head back dramatically.
“Harry boy I know-“
(See the end of the chapter for
Once back in the confides of their private rooms, Harry placed both their brooms by the door and gently pulled Draco over to one of the sofas. He muttered a spell, so the fire lit and began gently warming the room.
Harry smiled to himself in the mirror. He didn’t look half bad. He had found some of his nicer clothes at the bottom of his still unpacked trunk and managed to straighten them out with a quick spell. Harry had considered wearing robes but even after eight years in the magical community, robes still confused him.
Harry was still looking over him, concern written in his eyes.
The walk back was quiet. Neither spoke but it was a comfortable silence, one that didn’t need filling. Draco felt content and Harry was very pleased with how the night had gone.
“I’m sorry but bonds cannot be broken unless one of the pair dies,” Pomfrey told Harry sympathetically. “And it means I must speak to Professor Dumbledore to see if there is any way to speed up this part of the bonding to make you both feel more comfortable. A bond this weak won’t be pleasant for very long” She took a moment to think and waved her wand, removing the spell that revealed their magical auras. “I’m going to have to ask both of you to use as little magic as possible for the time being. Using it when your core is so unstable could be dangerous. And you two need to make more of a conscious effort to get along now. Arguing or even ignoring each other will only make matters worse. Have a house-elf summon me if you need to. I will be back in a day or two for another examination” Harry gave her a short nod and with that, she left.
“Here I stand, and I do so bind myself to you. Here I stand, and I place myself in your hands. I give myself to you freely. I bind myself to you.”
The next day was not what the boys had expected or wanted. They had both woken up in a good mood, happily working through assignments in a comfortable silence until about noon when Madame Pomfrey sent a house elf to summon them to the hospital wing.
The potion began to change colour. No longer the deep purple, but now a beautiful strong silver that started flowing upwards. Up out of the cauldron and around Draco’s wrist, followed by Harry’s in a figure of eight. Harry looked at Draco and their eyes locked.
“Back off Potter” Draco shouted back when Harry had almost caught up with him.
Harry woke up early that morning and felt different. As he shifted onto his back, he noticed he felt good. Happy. It had been a while since Harry had woken up in a good mood. He smiled to himself, looking over to see Draco’s empty bed. Harry knew Draco would probably try to avoid him at all costs today and Harry knew that he should just let him. But he didn’t want to. He had got a glimpse at something new last night in Draco and he was greedy for more.
“What’s wrong?” Harry put down his papers and looked at Malfoy. He was stressed. That much was obvious, and Harry was suddenly quite concerned.
“But there are so many other things between us” Draco couldn’t stop himself from countering.
Draco attempted pulling his arm from Harry’s grasp. “Let go of me” his voice was low and cold, and it only angered Harry.
“We’re fine” Harry smiled and turned to Draco, trying to encourage him to come over.
Harry jumped a little, startled to see Malfoy sat with him. “I’d like to-“ Draco stopped again and sighed, rubbing his eyes.
“You” Harry breathed, grinding back. He felt like he had in his dream. He was growing desperate, the pressure behind him wasn’t enough. He needed relief so bad and Draco’s hand was so teasingly close, driving him insane. “This”

“Well, what is it doing to you?” Harry turned his body, so he was facing Draco and tucked one knee under himself.
“I’ve wanted to talk to you since the start of the year” Draco spoke, surprising Harry. “When the war ended, I swore to make things right, to fix what I could. I managed to sort out a lot of issues with people but you… I wanted to mend things between us, but the moment never seemed right and I didn’t know if you even cared”
Draco smiled softly and tugged Harry close again, their faces inches apart.
All the tables had been pushed to the sides of the classroom except one. It stood in the middle of the room and held a single, medium-sized cauldron that was lightly bubbling and a deep purple. Harry took a deep breath and was the first to approach the cauldron while Draco seemed frozen by the door. Without a word, Harry offered his hand to Draco who eyes were flitting from Harry to the table.
“Ron and I were saving it for the end of the year but I’m sure we could convince George to send over another” Harry grabbed two empty glasses from the dining table and brought them over. He took the bottle from Malfoy and sat beside him. “I was thinking that maybe a little liquid courage couldn’t hurt” He poured a small amount into both glasses. “So, simple rules. I’m sure you’ve played before. Every time you’ve done something, you take a shot of the firewhisky” Harry explained, leaning back comfortably.
“Very much” Harry answered without a hesitation, “You look great”
It took a second for the lump in Harry’s throat to leave. The letter nearly brought tears to his eyes, but he swallowed them down. Harry could just imagine Hermione in a mountain of books right now. She was always there to help. He knew Ron would be there too. Sometimes it still shocked Harry how incredible his friends were.
“It’s real simple Draco” Harry spoke with purpose. It was strange, Harry could see how Draco was feeling but it was almost like he could feel it too. It was almost like the hot and cold run of magic through his core.
Harry pulled a face and then suddenly remembered the young, confident blonde when he was getting robes for Hogwarts. “I completely forgot about that”
“Yes, I know the rules Potter” Draco picked up his glass and tucked his legs under himself. “Okay then. Never have I ever cheated on a test”
Without a word, Malfoy took a seat and began helping himself to the roast beef and potatoes in front of him. Harry took this as a very good sign and started eating too. Malfoy was out of the bedroom and now eating with Harry. The easy bit was done, now for the hard part.
“Hello? Draco, what are we going to do?” Harry repeated, quickly catching up.
Draco wasn’t unaffected by the bond by any means. However, he had spent years learning how to repress feelings and emotions. He managed to push down the bonds demands better than Harry had so far.
“I’m not sure. I think we may have pissed off the bond, I think it was trying to stop us fighting” Draco glanced at Harry, a strange look in his eyes. He opened his mouth to speak but the hospital doors suddenly opened, and Malfoy stopped himself, looking up to see Dumbledore approaching their beds.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry stood up easily and closed Draco’s book.
Harry stopped talking when Draco’s face inched closer. “I don’t like her touching you” he repeated.
Harry suddenly went very red and it wasn’t due to the heat from the fire. “Oh,” he said stupidly. That was the very last thing he expected Malfoy to say. “D-do we have to?”
Draco smiled. Harry was too interested in staring at his thumbs to see it. “You definitely proved you're not a lost cause” Draco teased before letting himself open up a little, “But I’ve enjoyed it too. It’s shocking but we do work well together”
“Dumbledore gave it to you!” Draco couldn’t believe it. “Did he know you used it?”
Harry had to break away to catch his breath, but Draco didn’t let him go far, burning a trail across Harry’s jaw with his lips before nipping gently at Harry’s ear, rewarding him with a deep groan.
Draco was, once again, at war with himself. He spent another hour in the bedroom having a mental battle. There were so many things Draco wanted to say and so many ways it could go wrong. How could Draco possibly explain to Potter that he wanted to stop fighting? That he wanted to move on from their past? He had wanted to do this since the start of eighth year but had never found the courage despite promising himself he would be braver after the war. Draco had never been brave when it came to Potter. Even after all these years, Potter was still his weak spot. But Draco knew he needed to do this. Dumbledore was right, this wasn’t about their childhood rivalry anymore.
Reality seemed to suddenly hit Harry and he blushed hard. He sat up quickly, his face and neck burning. “Shit, um, sorry. I got a bit caught up”
Two chapters in one day, enjoy :)
Draco came to a stop and huffed, looking around. His cheeks were already dusted pink, his hair had been blown out of place and Harry swore he had never seen anything so stunning. Harry expected flying to have distracted him from Draco but what it really did was make him more aware of Draco. Draco was now about ten feet above Harry and the bond was making it clear that it wasn’t happy. That pulling sensation was back and so while Harry tried to focus on locating the snitch, the bond was busy making sure Harry knew exactly where Draco was. It was very off-putting, especially when Draco seemed so unaffected.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I guess after the war was over, I did, yeah. I wanted my happily ever after. But life isn’t that nice. Mine especially. But this is the hand we’ve been dealt and now we have two options. We spend the rest of our life hating each other, arguing, and most likely feeling like crap forever with an unstable bond. Or we could try and work this out. Try to get along. Try to have the most normal life we can like this” Harry sounded more confident this time.
“You don’t” Harry cut Dumbledore off. He didn’t want to hear it. He couldn’t hear it. Especially not with him sat no more than six feet away. Dumbledore sighed and put his hands on the desk in front of him.
“Would you be interested in going to dinner with me tonight? Be ready for six?” Harry chuckled at Draco’s confused face.
After their last exchanging of words, they had finished lunch and Draco had decided to spend the rest of the evening reading a potions book. Harry had no idea how someone could sit for nearly four hours reading about potions. Instead, Harry had taken a seat by the fire, deep in thought. It was around this time yesterday that Harry had been sat in Dumbledore’s office and told that he and Malfoy were stuck for life.
“Are you being serious? You do know that bonds can’t form between people not sexually compatible, right?” Draco said slowly, guessing Harry was messing with him.
Draco opened and closed his mouth a few times, but no sound came out. He thought he was. It took a lot of strength to come and ask Harry for this. A lump formed in his throat and Draco felt a sudden rush of disappointment. He knew talking to Potter wouldn’t work. How could he have been so stupid? Why did he think Harry would want to listen? Maybe because Potter had acted like he cared last night and for a moment Draco wanted to believe he did.
Draco cast a quick ‘Tempus’. “We should go to bed. It’s almost midnight”
“Merlin” Harry muttered, jaw dropping and eyes raking up the tall blonde.
Harry nodded, looking better “Yeah, I guess you’re right”
Malfoy wanted to say no but he was starving and Potter wanted to talk. His curiosity got the better of his stubbornness. He wanted to know what Potter had to say.
Harry shrugged, kicking off his shoes and crossing his legs. “I’m not sure…” He looked around the room before he had an idea.
Harry sighed, gently running his fingers through Draco’s hair. “What did you need to see us for Madam?” Harry asked when she returned with a blue vile.
Harry could feel Draco. Could feel his fear, his nerves, his wavering hope and his frustration. It was an odd, detached sort of feeling. Harry knew what Draco’s emotions were, he could feel them, but they weren’t his. Yet, the more he concentrated on them, the more they became his own. And so, with a deep breath and suddenly sweaty palms, he approached Draco like approaching a wild lion.
It took Harry a second to realise Draco had even spoke, he was so caught up in the way Draco was looking at him. “Um, what?”
“Harry” Hermione was suddenly serious. “Of course, I’m alright with it. And so is Ron and anyone else who cares about you. All that matters to us is that you’re happy”
Harry stepped forward, “And you didn’t want to tell me now either. Because you were scared I hated you? Because you feared I’d reject you?”
Harry didn’t know what to think about this piece of information and neither did Draco. They both stood looking slightly confused before Dumbledore took pity and continued to speak.
Classes were smaller than usual, but Harry liked it that way. He put his head down and really tried to copy Hermione with her study habits. He managed for a while until Ron convinced him back onto the pitch. They started playing simple games out on the field together until it got competitive. It distracted them. Gave them time to let go and so Hermione didn’t bother scolding them about missing study sessions when she saw their wind blow hair. She knew that flying lifted their spirits like nothing else could.
With an encouraging smile, Harry stood and offered Draco his hand. “Are you coming?”
“That comment made by an ignorant child this morning made me angry. I care about you Draco. More than I care to admit and more than you’d believe. I wanted to shout in your defence and hex every idiot there. And again, I didn’t mean to worry you about what Pomfrey said. I don’t like her prying. I know she needs to know to make sure everything is going smoothly but it annoyed me. What happens between us is ours. And Hermione is a friend, an incredible friend but just a friend. No more, no less”
“Let’s go then”
Write to us if you can.
“Tell me” he demanded.
“A lot of work just for a date” Draco muttered, picking up his menu.
“No, fuck you” Malfoy pushed Harry down by his shoulders and kneed him in the stomach hard. With the wind knocked out of Potter, Draco tackled him to the ground and pinned Harry’s hands under his knees. “Fuck” Malfoy landed a third punch Harry’s face, splitting his lip. “You” Then a fourth to his cheekbone, breaking his glasses.
A smile broke out across Harry’s face at Draco using his first name. “Then let’s do it”
Harry gripped onto the edge of the table, his knuckles turning white with the effort to keep himself standing. He couldn’t understand how he could feel so drained, so exhausted, and yet so full of energy. Harry could feel his magical core bursting with renewed strength, it felt more secure. Before it had felt odd, just a few streaks of Draco’s magic rubbing uncomfortably against his own. Now it was coursing through him, feeling lighter yet stronger and new.
The corridor was almost packed with fourth and fifth year students with the odd third and sixth year. The excited chatter died immediately when Harry and Draco walked out. Harry cursed under his breath. Those damn third years, Harry thought when he saw the same group in the crowd.
Harry scowled. This was ridiculous. He couldn’t even do something he was good at because all he could think about was dragging Draco back to the ground and snogging him within an inch of his life.
“Losing your tack, Potter?” teased Draco, hovering beside him.
“What did Madam Pomfrey say?” Draco tried for what felt like the one hundredth time. Before Harry could response with ‘Nothing’ again, Draco spoke. “Potter just tell me. You’ve worried me”
“Sounds like fun,” Harry said sarcastically.
Let me know what you think! Feedback is always welcome. Hope you enjoyed the chapter :)
Malfoy sighed and turned his head, so he was once again looking at the ceiling.
Meanwhile, Harry was a mess of trembling need and emotions beneath Draco. Harry had never felt like this before. He and Ginny had done things, but nothing had ignited him the way Draco could. Harry felt almost desperate with need and yet, somehow also felt calm and safe. He felt cared for and it only drove him further insane with want.
“Good” Draco growled, “Because I don’t share”
Draco went quiet, thinking to himself. After a few minutes, they had arrived at the edge of Hogsmeade. It was quiet, of course. None of the students were out and there weren’t many locals, but Harry cast a glamour anyway and Draco threw the invisibility cloak over himself.
“No. I didn’t” Harry gently placed his forefinger under Draco’s chin, pulling Draco’s eyes up. “It was uncalled for. The bond may be affecting me but letting it take over how I feel isn’t fair when I take it out on you”
Harry sat down on the table right in front of Draco, making him lean back a little. He looked him dead in the eye and spoke.
“What do we do?” He asked. After that conversation, he had so many questions, but Draco just kept walking down the stairs.
A knowing smirk spread across Draco’s face. “Distracted?” he edged a little closer, tipping his head to the side. Harry’s eyes were drawn to Draco’s lips as Darco slowly and purposefully dragged his tongue along his bottom lip. Harry’s breathing was shallow, and it wasn’t due to flying.
"Potter?" Draco asked uncertainly, watching Harry storm off in the direction of the castle. “What’s wrong?” Draco could feel the anger radiating from Potter and walked carefully behind him.
“What? No, no. We’re not together. I think. We went on a date and sure, we’ve kissed. But nothing’s official” Harry chuckled, feeling as if a weight had been lifted. She was happy for him. “And what do you mean ‘obviously’?”
Harry kissed his was across to Draco’s pulse point before sucking it gently, causing Draco to let out a strangled whimper which only made Harry suck harder.
“So, are you ready?” Draco asked.
“Ah! There you are!” The booming voice of Slughorn had both Harry and Draco nearly jumping out of their skin. “I didn’t think you were coming but never mind, here you are. Well, it’s all set for you two, I did it all myself” Slughorn was almost beaming and it bothered Draco immensely. “Don’t worry about anything once you’re done. Just head straight back to your rooms. Now go on, go on”
“Draco” Harry whispered; he was close to begging, but he didn’t have to. Draco finally closed the distance between them and kissed Harry firmly this time. His lips began gliding smoothly against Harry’s and his hands travelled their way up into Harry’s thick, dark locks.
“What’s got you all keyed up? It couldn’t possibly be… me, could it? My, my” Draco tutted with a small shake of his head, “You should pay more attention-“
Harry took his head from his hands and looked up at Draco whose face was suddenly much closer than he remembered it being. Draco realised it too. He had lent in while speaking and for some reason, didn’t move when Harry lifted his head.
“But you haven’t been” Harry pointed out. “You’re not hurt. I’m not rejecting you. I told you, I want this too. You just need to start believing me”
“Professor, just one more time, how did this happen?” Harry asked, desperate that Dumbledore would see a mistake, a flaw, a reason that this couldn’t be true.
“Really? Hm, I would have guessed Nott” Harry mused out loud.
Both watched in fascinated horror as that bright ball of light slowly faded away to reveal both the blue and red band had begun to intertwine with one another.
“The article was released this morning. I think it would be best if you two didn’t read it. You mustn’t worry yourselves over that nonsense. However, since then you have both had one too many letters sent which I have intercepted. I do not believe it would be any good letting you read those either so I would like a list of people you would like to allow to send you letters Mr. Malfoy” Dumbledore spoke with such an air of calm that did nothing to settle either boy. “Harry created one of these a while back and I would like to do the same for you to protect you both”
A soft sigh escaped Draco and he buried his head into side of Harry’s neck. “Just once” he mumbled and let himself be coaxed in a deep sleep.
Harry tried to suppress his smile, “Draco it was awful!” he insisted. “She started giving me advice!”
“If you think, for one second, that you can moan and grind against me like that and walk away you are sorely mistaken” Draco’s voice was low and Harry couldn’t tell if it was due to just waking up or how turned on he was but it sent a shiver through Harry.
“I am trying!” Draco insisted.
Harry looked slightly confused. “Of course, I meant it. I don’t say things like that just for the fun of it”
“I said I was sorry!” Harry tried to look apologetic, but he couldn’t help the smile that took over his face.
“Now Professor Dumbledore is on his way to speak to the two of you, but it won’t be for long. You need to rest. And don’t expect to be going back to your rooms tonight” Pomfrey told the boys, adjusting Malfoy’s sheets and leaving with the tray of vials to tend to other patients.
And with that thought, Draco joined Harry in the main room.
Once the door to Dumbledore’s office was closed, Harry turned to Draco.
Harry hit him again and laughed light-heartedly.
Harry took a moment to assess himself. “I feel fine now. I can still feel the buzz, but it is gentle and if I concentrate, I can feel your emotions. Other than that, I feel almost normal”
Harry nodded, “Thanks for coming Hermione. How did you find us by the way? I thought you said that Dumbledore wouldn’t tell you”
Slowly, Draco turned his hand palm up and clasped Harry’s hand, almost experimentally. It was warm and heavy, rough in places and yet so smooth in others. And it felt ridiculously right in Draco’s hand.
“Draco, are you sure-“
This, of course, didn’t help Harry’s predicament. He tried not to linger on the thought too long when it entered his head, but he was slowly starting to accept the truth in it. He liked Draco. A lot. Harry had always noticed Draco throughout the years but now, he knew it wasn’t solely because Harry had been suspicious of him. And now living with Draco had only amplified these feelings of attraction. Sure, it was the bond too, but Harry couldn’t say the bond was forcing him to feel this way. It just wasn’t true. Those feelings had always been there. Lingering in the back of his mind.
“Harry” Harry corrected again.
“Fuck” Draco slowly dipped a second finger past Harry’s waistband and Harry pushed into his touched.
We wanted to visit but Dumbledore said you needed time, something about us being there would affect the bonding. He refused to even tell us where your rooms are. You can still write to us though.
Harry looked over the menu, “I’m starving”
“I surrender who I’ve been for who you are” Harry nearly choked on the words when that same red light burst from his chest and the icy blue from Draco’s. “I tether my self and soul to you” The lights drifted towards each other and when the touched, a bright light encased Harry and Draco.
Hi! Sorry again that this took so long but here it is. Hope you all enjoy! :)
“Well that’s good” Harry nodded, still smiling happily.
“Nothing” Harry muttered, nursing his bleeding finger that was suddenly snatched from him. “Hey!”
Harry sunk down deeper, casting a warming spell over them both and raking his hand through Draco’s hair, massaging his head. “You can leave if you really want to” Harry spoke softly, trying to lull Draco in with gentle tugs of his hair and soothing strokes up and down his neck.
“See you soon ‘mione” Harry closed the door behind her and turned back to Draco.
The two worked amicably for a few hours, neither one mentioning earlier or the night before and keeping a safe distance between each other. Though this didn’t stop the odd lingering gaze and the shy smiles from Harry when he was caught or the light blush when Draco was.
Harry rolled his eyes and laughed, feeling more comfortable than he had in a long time.
“You know, as crazy as this might sound Malfoy, you can clean without the use of house-elves or magic” he was teasing but Malfoy made a very displeased face and poured himself a glass of tomato juice.
Draco was wearing a pair of black pants that hugged him perfectly in all the right places, a white button up shirt with the top two buttons undone and a black blazer. Harry had never seen Draco in something so casual yet so formal and so… muggle. But what shocked Harry most was Draco’s hair. Instead of his perfectly parted and combed hair, it was loose and free, ruffled in front of his face, brushing the tops of his eyes. It screamed to be touched.
Madam Pomfrey handed Draco the blue potion, “Here. Drink this. It should help calm you down”
Harry nodded, “You know ‘mione. I am okay. Really” He insisted when she raised an eyebrow. “It’s been difficult, don’t get me wrong. But for the first time in a while, I think I’m happy”
Harry had opted not to wear them. After all the years of Draco’s comments on them, he assumed he would look best without them so had cast a spell that would help him see. It only worked for a few hours and honestly, Harry wasn’t brilliant at the spell at best.
“Did you mean what you said last night?” Draco asked as calmly as he could.
“But you can”
It took Draco a moment to understand what Potter was asking him. He was more shocked at the civil, almost gentle tone Potter had used. After removing his robe and casting it onto the closest sofa, he joined Harry on the floor.
Most of Harry’s anger had dissipated during his rant and all that was left was honest confusion. Draco hadn’t realised, hadn’t even thought for a second about how the bond was affecting Harry.
“I don’t want you in my head” Muttered Harry, more to himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You can’t blame me too much. I was brought up to impress people with what I had. Father always said that was how to make friends and strong allies” he rolled his eyes.
Harry pushed himself up off the floor and sat on the sofa behind him. “What about?” he asked.
It took a few moments. Draco was fighting himself. He hurt. But it wasn’t physical pain anymore. His heart ached. And all Draco wanted to do was talk to Potter, but he couldn’t because what if he didn’t listen? Didn’t care?
“Well?” He asked impatiently.
“God” Harry breathed, closing his eyes for a moment “What happened? What was…” He didn’t finish his question, memories of that searing agony coming back full force.
“Behind us Draco. Nothing is between us unless we let it get there. The past is the past”
“-our auras?” Malfoy finished, looking how Harry felt.
Harry narrowed his eyes a little, “Don’t call her that”
“My name is Harry and you can have this back when you learn how to say it” Harry smirked, quickly jumping back when Draco tried lunging for the book.
Are you okay? Ron’s worried sick. He freaked when you disappeared from the hospital wing and didn’t come back to the dorm last night. He almost broke down Dumbledore’s office door to find out what was happening.
“Is there a way to undo it?” Harry asked, turning to look Malfoy in the eye.
“Don’t play words with me. Drink” Harry laughed.
Harry felt fear and wonder course through him, and Draco suddenly took his hand and they looked at each other once again.
Harry looked around casually, faking surprise when he caught Draco’s eye. “Oh, sorry! Were you talking to me?” He smirked, taking a step back.
“I was going to check up on your bond, make sure you are both progressing. From the looks of things, I’d say you are getting closer” She commented causing Harry to blush, but he didn’t move from Draco’s side. Instead, he summoned a chair and sat down.
During this particular lesson, Harry had been trying to cut up frog legs while looking for the dragon powder he had misplaced when he managed to slice his finger wide open with the knife.
With the old attitude of Malfoy, Draco swung open the door and leaned against the frame. “Struggling to find the exit, Granger?” he sneered.
“No. I don’t” Draco replied curtly and left for their bedroom, slamming the door behind him.
Harry sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose and when he removed his hand, Draco could see his cheeks had gone red. “Alright fine. She just wanted to ask some questions”
“Agreed” Harry’s smile widened. Now, this felt like progress.
Harry was excited. He hadn’t been on a broom in almost a year and a good game was what he needed.
Harry smiled brightly, walking up to Draco and cupping his cheeks. "I would love to"
Gently, Draco lifted Harry’s hand higher and let go, leaving both their hands placed palm down a few inches above the potion. Harry shakily took out his wand and placed it on Draco’s wrist. “Here I stand, and I do so bind myself to you. Here I stand, and I place myself in your hands. I give myself to you freely. I bind myself to you.”
“After how you reacted this morning, I freaked and thought you were just pretending, just putting up with me. Then when you wouldn’t tell me what Pomfrey said and how happy you were to see Granger… it all just kind of all exploded in my head”
Harry and Draco split the bill before Draco threw on the invisibility cloak once more and Harry cast his glamour. Harry thanked Madam Rosmerta and walked quickly out of Hogsmeade so Draco could remove the cloak.
Twenty feet.
“I know. I have missed you too. How are you? Both of you” She spoke, acknowledging Draco.
“Now Professor” Pomfrey began but Dumbledore held up his hands in mock surrender.
“I mean it Potter” Draco advanced.
“Trying to get me into bed already Potter?” Malfoy’s tone was harsh but the edge to it was obvious. Being snappy must be his way of dealing with this, Harry thought and without a word, he left.
Harry thought he had died and gone to a heaven. Draco’s lips where paradise. His weight was grounding. His hands were hypnotising. Harry rested his hands on Draco’s hips and kissed back slowly, gaining confidence with Draco. It was too much and not enough all at the same time. Harry was overwhelmed by Draco, yet he wanted more.
“If you insist” Harry chuckled, going to the bathroom to clean himself up.
Harry nodded, unsure of what to say. Draco spoke instead, “You never talk about those muggles you lived with. What was that like?”
“But I said-“
“What you said about there being something” he gestured between the two of them and forced out the words, “between us, I-I think you’re right.” He swallowed hard; Harry found it almost painful to watch Draco stumble across his words when he was always so sure of himself. “And I think I would be OK, only if you wanted to, if we maybe, I don’t know. Acted on that” Draco emphasised the last word, trying to make it clear what he wanted without saying it and without looking at Harry. Instead, Draco seemed to find that his hands were suddenly of great interest.
Draco took a deep breath to steady himself. He uncrossed his arms and stepped closer, closing the gap between himself and Harry. “Fine. I’d like my book back Harry”
“I cannot force all the blame on you two though. Some new information has come to light whilst you were both recovering” This caught Malfoy’s interest and he looked up too. “While Madame Pomfrey was checking over your bonds this morning, she discovered some information. Explaining how is much too complicated so I shall just skip to what she found” Dumbledore smiled at the two, almost as if for dramatic effect and all Draco wanted to do was tell him to get on with it.
Draco’s breath caught in his throat and he had to force himself to stay focused on the conversation. It was easier when Potter let go of his chin.
Their food arrived then, and Harry tucked in causing Draco to roll his eyes. “You would swear you’d never eaten before”
Light exploded from every angle, chasing away every shadow in the room and wrapping up Harry and Draco. Harry felt a warm, tight squeeze around his chest, and it took his breath away. Draco gripped Harry’s hand tighter, feeling the air being forced out of his lungs by the sudden tight force around his upper body.
“Fuck, Draco, please, I’m-“ Harry came so hard he stopped breathing for a moment. He gasped and his hips thrust on their own. It was the most powerful orgasm Harry had ever experienced and he didn’t know if it would end as wave after wave of pleasure rippled through him.
Draco looked a little nervous now, “Only if you do”
Harry put all this down to habit though, of course. Through sixth year Harry watched Malfoy like a hawk and with good reason, so he was bound to notice things. It’s just a habit, Harry would convince himself, a habit he’d yet to shake. That is the only reason Harry's eye was drawn to the Slytherin table at almost every meal and why Harry would sometimes struggle to concentrate in potions with Malfoy so close.
“Who’s that from?” Malfoy asked, putting his book down.
“Good afternoon more like Mr. Potter.” Pomfrey shook her head and continued, “I just wanted to check up on the two of you and see how the bond is fairing compared to yesterday. Anything new to report?” She asked as she pulled her wand from her sleeve and began what seemed to be a very intricate spell.
“Well, alright, I do have a talent for it, and I’d like to use it. To help people. Find new medicines, cure the ill. I’d like that” Draco spoke to his glass, glancing up at Harry now and then.
“Some would call it that,” he said quietly, extremely uncomfortable. If someone had told him at the start of the year that he would be in a shared room having this conversation with the chosen one, then he would have suggested they get themselves checked into St Mungo's.
“Well” Harry laughed, smiling shyly, “That was unexpected”
“Okay fine” Harry laughed, “What do I need to know then?”
Harry froze.
These were the reasons why they had spent the past few hours in their rooms trying to avoid each other. Harry had had a ridiculously long shower in which he got extremely bored, but he stayed until his fingers pruned. And it was why Malfoy did the same and had managed to drag out drying and brushing his hair for another hour. And yet, despite trying to stay out of each other’s way, it was as if the bond was trying to pull them back together. Whenever Malfoy would leave the bedroom, Harry would be entering which always resulted in a very awkward little dance, lots of blushing, and mumbled apologies.
Draco squirmed uncomfortably, “I guess I’m so used to suppressing things that I hadn’t noticed I was doing it to the bond.”
“The Saviour cleaning? I couldn’t imagine” Malfoy knew once the words were out that he’d made a mistake. Potter’s eyes flashed with some unknown emotion before being replaced with anger.
“How could you betray us like this Harry? He’s a death eater” The pure genuine confusion and disgust made Harry feel sick. He couldn’t believe that people were still so cruel months after the war had finished. He would have given anything to have been able to drag Draco away from it all but he knew they needed to get through this.
“Oh? And why’s that?” Draco knew this wouldn’t end well. He couldn’t understand why he didn’t just keep his mouth shut but Potter got under his skin and Draco had never been one to back down first.
“Ah and there it is” Harry shook his head looking disappointed but not surprised. He slipped back onto the floor and got back to organising Hermione’s notes.
“It was after that when it started acting up but I’m not sure why. I couldn’t concentrate on anything. I kept rereading the same line over and over again. I kept losing track of what I was doing. I-I couldn’t get you out of my head” Harry ran a self-conscious hand through his already messy hair. “I thought going to the pitch would help but it made things worse. It felt like the bond was trying to pull me back to you. I was trying to focus on finding the snitch, but the bond wanted me to focus on where you were. It was getting on my nerves. And then you seemed so calm and in control, like you weren’t feeling anything I was… I got angry”
Draco’s hand slipped under Harry’s top, teasing the skin at the top of his pelvis and began nibbling Harry’s ear. He was rewarded with a broken whimper. Harry didn’t know if he could take this. The dream was intense, but the real thing was even better.
They shared a smile and Harry glanced away, nervously rubbing the back of his neck. “So…” he said with no actual idea on where he was going.
Draco’s jaw dropped but he quickly hid his shock. “You want to go on a date? Us?”
Draco felt something bleeding into him, something new and wonderful creeping through his being. And he realised it was Harry. It was Harry’s essence, his core, his magic, and mind taking him over and he suddenly spoke with ease. “I surrender who I’ve been for who you are. I tether my self and soul to you”
Sorry about the delay on this chapter. I really wanted to get this as close to what I imagined as possible which took some time. I also used one of my absolute favourite Sleeping At Last song lyrics in this chapter because I just had to. Hope you enjoyed this one :)
Draco nodded, “Alright then. Let’s begin”
Draco was immediately pissed off and ready to attack when the words were stolen from his mouth by Harry’s lips. The kiss was sweet but firm and pushed Draco up against the arm of the sofa with Harry up against his front.
“Is that all?” Draco nodded in response. “Very well.”
Harry sighed, hiding his face with one hand. “Questions about us. Some embarrassingly, overly personal, way too intimate questions about us” Harry groaned, clearly reliving the awful experience.
Draco cleared his throat and looked up at Harry, "Would you like to, perhaps, do it again?"
Draco sighed and let Harry take his things. “Okay fine. We can take a break” he agreed.
Harry smirked, “I thought you didn’t do compliments”
Draco smiled, “Of course I’m right”
Hermione tipped her head to the side before a smile broke out, “You’re… together! Are you official?” She suddenly exclaimed. “So, you like him? Of course, you do, it’s written all over your face. He obviously likes you back-“
“Well it came in use, didn’t it?” Draco raised an eyebrow, smirking.
And of course, Draco looked because Potter said his name, his actual name as if it were a prayer and he wanted to hear it again. But when he looked into Potter’s eyes, those bright, shining, innocent green eyes, he caved.
“But this is different. This time it wouldn’t be an accident. This time we are willingly choosing it” Draco said, looking down at his clasped hands.
“Almost done” He smiled at her once more “Gentlemen, I need you to understand the seriousness of the situation now. This is no longer about your childhood rivalry. This is about your safety. The bond reacted the way it did because you aren’t acting the way you should. Like it or not, the bond demands closeness and affection. Fighting could kill you both. Please listen to what I’m telling you and get some rest, you need it” Dumbledore nodded to them both and Pomfrey, before leaving.
Harry was so distracted that he missed the snitch which flew right by his face.
“You know, I’ve always hated potions” Draco gave him a ‘no shit’ expression which made Harry chuckle. “Well, um, since we started this year it’s been, sort of, enjoyable”
Draco gave a particularly hard thrust and Harry grasped Draco’s arm as an anchor, “Tell me” Draco ordered, nipping at the exposed skin of Harry’s neck.
“Fuck you” Harry practically spat at Malfoy.
Harry was gone in a split second.
About an hour later, Harry and Draco were studying. It was only Tuesday, and Harry was ready for the weekend. He would have just blown off studying if it wasn’t for Draco who insisted that they should keep up to date with work.
“Prat” Draco scowled, throwing a pillow at him.
Thank you for all the comments! I love hearing what you guys think and of course, thank you for reading :)
Draco flushed and without a word, took a shot.
“Hm” Was all he got in response. “Here Mr. Malfoy, it’s about time you had another” Pomfrey handed Malfoy a vial with the same purple potion.
Luckily, the hallways weren’t as busy as they normally were at this time. They weren’t sure why but were both relieved to avoid the staring and whispering as they began to descend the stairs that lead to the dungeons. Their steps began to echo off the walls of the empty corridor, the only sound breaking the silence. Harry felt awkward but kept quiet. He was aware that this wasn’t the time to break out the small talk.
When they had made it through the crowds and to the hospital wing, Harry took a deep shuddering breath.
“What the hell are you doing here, Granger?” Draco snapped.
With a step back, Harry smiled.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t stress yourself out over it. Trust me, it isn’t worth it” Draco wasn’t particularly good at the whole comforting thing, but he tried. “It shouldn’t matter to people. To be honest, it’s very acceptable in the wizarding community. But to those it does matter to, well they clearly aren’t worth your time anymore. Besides, you know Granger and Weasley are okay with it. If they weren’t, they wouldn’t have written to you”
“She is putting her nose where it doesn’t belong actually” he corrected.
“You do?” Harry asked, surprised but thankful to have them back on. “But you always used to tease me”
“Through light and dark”
Harry took Draco’s free hand with his own instead and stepped closer to him.
Harry smiled softly, “I’m sorry too. About everything. I didn’t mean what I said yesterday” and to Harry’s surprise, Draco smiled back.
Draco struggled to sleep that night. Every few hours he would awake in a cold sweat, breathless and unbelievably aroused. His dreams were torturing him. No matter how many times he went back to sleep, the same scene would replay in his dreams. Harry’s lingering gaze, his dark features, and plump lips slowly edging closer. Only, in his dream, Draco didn’t pull away. Dream after dream of Harry kissing Draco breathless on the sofa or grinding against one another with Draco’s back to a wall or Harry pinned under Draco on the floor by the fire. Each dream seeming to drive Draco crazier than the last. A couple of times, he was so worked up, Draco had to quietly sneak into the bathroom to deal with his arousal.
Harry got out of bed and stretched, not missing Draco’s wandering eyes before he turned quickly back to his trunk. “I just wanted to know if you were going to be awkward about last night” Harry shrugged. He was surprised by the sudden ease he felt.
Warm lips burned a fiery path down Harry’s throat, nipping at sensitive skin. Harry tipped his head back, giving Draco more access and couldn’t hold back the whimper that escaped his lips when Draco’s teeth sunk into the skin where his neck met his shoulder and began sucking in a deep bruise.
Harry had worried about what would happen when they got back, especially with Ron and Hermione now an official couple. But if anything, things were better. The trio had never been closer. They leaned on each other and eighth year was passing by smoothly. Until this.
Harry did a quick self-assessment, mentally going through to see if he felt any aches or anything different. He had to learn how to do this pretty quickly whilst on the run. Not like he had a lot of time to stop and make sure he was in one piece every time something happened. Going from his toes to his head, he felt fine.
“Work” Draco replied shortly, flicking through one of his books.
Draco couldn’t help but smile. He put a hand on his hip and cocked his head. “Only if you’re ready to lose” Draco challenged, his heart already starting to beat faster.
With some sort of newfound determination, Draco went back to the main room to see Potter hadn’t moved an inch. He had this sort of glazed over expression and his cheeks were bright red from being so close to the fire for so long.
Harry thought for a minute before answering. “No” he said nothing else, distracting Draco from another question by dragging him down a small passage between two suits of armour.
Draco was searching to find the right words. He pulled his hand back and started playing with his fingers in his lap. After a few minutes, it was apparent that Draco wasn’t going to speak first so Harry took over.
I know this must sound impossible and you’re most likely sick of hearing this but please, try to get along. At least try.
Harry found himself pressed flush against the door with warm lips attacking his own. A strong pair of hands were pushing his hips into the door and a knee pushed between his legs to stop him from moving. It didn’t take long for Harry to respond, kissing Draco, lightly tugging at his hair while Draco sucked possessively on his bottom lip.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” He retorted.
Even with the bond telling him the opposite, the crippling doubt that Draco would never be enough was back. Apparently not even time with Potter could get rid of it.
“I’m sorry” he whispered causing Potter’s brow to furrow. “I’m sorry about the fight and what I said”
Draco took a deep breath and schooled his emotions, slipping into a much more formal manner. “Potter, I’d like to talk”
Harry just looked at Draco for a moment, considering his next go. Then, with genuine curiosity, he said, “Never have I ever kissed a guy”
On the sofa, by the dimly lit fire, sat a rather nervous looking Draco Malfoy. And that was when Harry felt it. It wasn’t terribly strong at first, but the more Harry focused on it, the stronger it grew.
Harry placed his finger and thumb under Draco’s chin and gently lifted it, forcing them to lock eyes. “Then what is it about?”
Flying started getting remarkably interesting though when he twelve. His first match against Harry Potter. It was intense.
“What’s wrong?” Harry began walking towards Draco who backed up, fear rising in his throat. “I’ll tell you what’s wrong, Malfoy” Harry tried not to growl the words, but he was pissed off. He knew it was unreasonable to be angry at Malfoy. He knew the problem was really the bond. But he didn’t care.
Harry and Draco left the castle under the invisibility cloak. It was mutual decision. They knew the halls would be busy what with students leaving the Great Hall after dinner and didn’t want to be stared at or seen at all, especially dressed up and leaving the castle together. Once they had made it to the grounds gate, they removed the cloak and pocketed it.
“Well if that’s all it is. You two do look a little off but I suspect that is due to the bonding ritual. Come, I will walk you back to your rooms”
“Forget it” Draco stood up, heading for their bedroom.
“The bond you two share is extremely weak, and it wants to be strong. Therefore, it is acting on its own to heighten your emotions. In a regular bonded pair, this would bring the two closer but what with this being you two…” Dumbledore shook his head sadly “The bond is pushing your emotions to the extreme which is why I’m guessing you have both been much more frustrated with the other and most likely the main reason this fight even occurred. I think I’d be correct in assuming it was over something rather silly looking back.”
“Alright, I’ll start then” Harry spoke, breaking the silence and catching Draco’s attention. “When this started the bond felt odd. Uncomfortable in a way. Your magic felt almost like an intruder in my magical core. And we both know how strongly the bond messed with our emotions” Harry laughed softly causing Draco to smile and nod.
“No, no. In Madame Malkin’s, I didn’t realise it was you until late into first year”
Draco opened his eyes and ran his thumb gently over Harry’s bottom lip, causing Harry to suck in a sharp breath, his tongue following Draco's finger on instinct. Draco seemed to be thinking long and hard about something before he came to an obvious decision and sat back on his hunches, letting Harry up.
“So why Zabini? How did that happen?” Harry asked, sounding maybe a little too interested.
Harry coughed, “Um… Hi Hermione”
Malfoy struggled not to look away. All of Potter’s attention was on him and it felt intimidating, but Draco knew he had to get this out. “I want this to work. I think this can work if we try” Harry nodded, the nervous look in his eye being replaced with something softer. “And so, if you wanted to, I would like to start fresh. Forgetting our past is impossible but we can work from here. A clean slate if you will” Draco kept a formal tone and let nothing but cool indifference show on his face.
“W-what?”
“Yes Draco” Harry laughed again but Draco didn’t feel like he was being laughed at. It only made him feel better. “I want to go on a date with you. I want to do this as much as you do. Trust me”
“Draco” Draco corrected without thinking causing Harry’s smile to widen.
Harry snapped his fingers and a house-elf appeared immediately by his side, bowing its head politely. “Could you bring us some lunch, please? Anything will do” Harry smiled at the little elf who bowed deeper and nodded its head enthusiastically.
“I wanted to apologise for just walking in. This is as much your place as it is Harry’s and I didn’t think. I’m sorry” Draco rolled his eyes. “Okay, well I’ll see you soon Harry” Hermione hugged Harry goodbye and Harry felt something flash through the bond, a strong emotion, but he wasn’t sure what.
“Nonsense” Draco entered the bathroom to retrieve them. He brought them back and slid them onto his face. “I like your glasses”
“Excellent. Well, I have a few things to tell you both” he paused, shifting in his seat. “I’m sorry to inform you that someone has spoken to the Prophet”
Comments and Kudos are really appreciated! Thank you for reading!
But their first time flying against each other was something entirely different. It was exhilarating. The whole world seemed to melt away and all that was left was Draco, Harry, and the snitch. Maybe it was then that Draco’s crush had begun. It would make sense. After that first match, Draco felt obsessed. His friends certainly thought he was. Every match would turn Draco into a nervous ball of energy which, of course, he hid behind his mask of arrogance.
Draco shook his head as if the thoughts would just tumble out of his ears if he tried hard enough, which didn’t escape Harry’s notice.
And now, stood in the field with a broom in hand, he knew Harry could feel his nerves. They were gathering more and more as they walked to the centre of the pitch and Harry thankfully hadn’t commented.
“Former death eater” Harry pointed out.
This brought Draco back. They both began to walk through the crowd, forcing the students to move. The whispering began then, and Harry did his best not to listen while Draco almost strained his ears trying to figure out what was being said.
“You’re alright with it?” he couldn’t help asking.
Harry found himself chuckling “Good one” and felt the mood shift to something lighter, something much easier to manage. “What time is it?”
“Stop being ridiculous” Harry stood, and Draco followed, holding out his hand. “Give me my book”
Hope you enjoyed this first chapter. This is my first ever fic so please review and be nice :) <3
“Good morning” Harry spoke with a lightness to his voice, his good mood evident.
Harry smiled, "Me too"
“Upset me? I’d have to care about your opinion for it to upset me Potter” Draco sneered, slamming the bedroom door behind him.
Both boys were startled when there was a sudden tapping on the window on the far wall. A small brown owl was perched on the window ledge with a roll of parchment tied to its leg. Harry jumped up when he realised, it was Ron’s new owl. “Sorry girl, I have no treats” He spoke quietly, taking the scroll and petting the bird.
“Hey” Harry moved and crouched in front of Draco. “It’s fine. We don’t have to, but I thought it would be nice. Neither of us have been on the pitch in a long time. If you’re worried about being seen, no one is out. Trust me, it’ll be fine”
“What?” Malfoy sounded confused; he was. What was Potter doing?
Draco sucked in a harsh breath, and gently put his hands on Harry’s shoulders, leaning back. His cheeks were red, his heart was racing, and his breathing was shallow.
Returning to their rooms the next morning had been a very awkward affair. Draco was mortified. He had cried in front of Potter, Harry Potter. He even apologised to the prat. He was shocked at himself, slightly angry too for allowing himself to be so open. So vulnerable. Yet he couldn’t rid himself of the image. The image of Harry’s bright eyes in the dark room and the whisper of Draco’s name, so soft on his lips. Draco shivered at the thought alone.
“Can we stop the process then?” Harry jumped in.
Harry turned back to the fire. He was starting to think he’d stay here all night. Hell, he might as well. He was still trying to process what Dumbledore had told him. The fact was he was now bonded to Draco Malfoy, a boy he had hated for years, a boy he had argued with and fought many times, a boy who he could never seem to get out of his head no matter how hard he tried. He was bonded to said boy and there was nothing they could do to undo the magic. This brought him on to the next fact, he was going to have to spend the rest of his life with Draco Malfoy. Harry had spent several years trying to escape a life tied to one man just to be tied to another only months later. He knew it wasn’t fair to compare Malfoy to Voldemort, but he couldn’t help feeling immensely sorry for himself at the moment. He also understood that at some point he and Malfoy would have to figure out how this would work. They couldn’t spend their life hating each other or constantly at the other’s throat. At least Harry knew he couldn’t. He was done with fighting.
“Don’t panic, it’s fine. If you don’t want to talk about something just tell me but…”
White-hot pain seared through both of them. It started in their chest and spread like a wildfire, coursing through their veins. It was searing. As if every nerve ending, every cell in their bodies were burning. Harry tried to move but it only seemed to make it worse. The pressure was building, growing, trying to escape him. His head was pounding. It was scolding, so hot it almost felt cold. He couldn’t take it anymore. It was everywhere. And just when he thought it couldn’t last any longer, a fresh wave attacked, and he fainted.
“Expected of you? Screw that. What do you want to do?” Draco asked. It surprised Harry, no one had ever asked before.
“Oh great" Harry laughed sourly. "So, while I’m suffering through it, you’re ignoring it. Fantastic. Nice to see you trying Draco” Harry turned to walk away but Draco quickly blocked his path.
“It depends really” Draco began slowly “On the bond type that is. Different bonds have different effects. What I understand about the one my ancestors created is this is at its simplest a magical bond, but my father told me about some cases where the bond has been more than that. It…” He picked his words carefully here, “A magical bond allows the magic of the two bonded to join and become one stronger magical core shared by both. And in those rare cases, a stronger bond is formed in which the bonded pair could feel each other’s aura both magical and not.” Draco glanced at Harry who looked very pale now and very confused.
“How did you get it? Father tried everything he could to get his hands on one”
As always, it didn’t take Harry long to finish up in the bathroom and get dressed. He ruffled his hair, pulling at a few strands and managing to make it look less insane due to it’s damp state before going searching for Draco.
Draco released Harry’s abused skin and placed a soft kiss to the mark before returning to Harry’s lips. Harry looked incredible. His hair thrown back against the sofa cushion and the flush of his cheeks with his pupils blown, and lips parted as he took quick, shallow breaths.
Draco sat simmering by the fire. Today hadn’t gone very well. The comment that student had made earlier, and Harry’s reaction still rolled around his head and made him feel sick. Draco’s curiosity burned and anxiety heightened every time he wondered what Madam Pomfrey had said, despite Harry insisting it was nothing. And then Granger. He hadn’t meant to react to her like that, but she felt like an intruder in this space Draco was beginning to love. And when she touched Harry. Draco tried not to drown in the wave of jealousy that overcame him when he remembered how Harry had smiled when he saw her and how he’d wrapped her up in such a loving embrace. Logically he knew that Granger was with the Weasel and that Harry was gay, but that didn’t stop the bond burning at the thought.
Hermione had sent over a bunch of class notes she had already made for the week commencing to help Harry. And it was after the third time Harry and Malfoy had walked into each other, that Harry decided to sit down and read through the notes. He laid them all out on the table by the sofas and sat on the floor organising them into piles. Charms, potions, defence, etc. And then he worked through each pile, putting any notes he knew he would spend the most time reading on top.
“The bond is acting up” Draco sighed, sitting up and looking down at Harry who was slouched with his feet up on the table.
Thank you for reading :)
“Sex Potter” Draco spat out, burying his head in his hands. “We have to have sex to complete the bond”
Harry shook his head. He couldn’t speak. He was mortified that Draco had heard him moaning from a bloody dream. But Merlin, Harry wasn’t sure if he cared if this was the outcome.
“Hey” Harry hit his arm gently. “I am not a prude. I just would rather talk to you about us than bloody Madam Pomfrey or anyone else for that matter. But I am sorry for worrying you, it wasn’t my intention”
“Draco” Harry repeated and put out his hand. “You in?”
Harry didn’t speak, couldn’t breathe.
That’s when it hit Harry. When he realised what he felt through the bond.
And just when the pressure around them grew too much. It began to release them. The light began to fade. The potion changed back to purple. The room grew quiet and still once again. Everything was as it was.
The boys were given a booth at the back of the pub, away from prying eyes and given two menus. Draco removed the cloak when he knew it was clear and Harry dropped the glamour. Then they had to cast a silencing spell around the table.
“Never,” said Draco, looking quite proud of himself.
Harry stayed perfectly still, except for one hand which rested on Draco’s cheek, caressing Draco with the pad of his thumb. Draco pulled back slowly, his breath a little shallower than it should have been for such a simple kiss and he was a little too flushed.
“I said let go of me!” Draco’s voice rose and he pushed Harry hard on the chest.
Harry,
Harry paused, “I-I hadn’t thought about it that way but, I mean, does it matter? Everyone so far has told us that this bond can’t be broken so it isn’t like we are choosing to solidify something that could go away. We would be doing it to help ourselves. That’s all. Right?”
“Wow Draco, that’s a really good idea. Really… nice”
Draco had always been easily bored by the people around him. Slytherins may be cunning but when you’re around them all the time, they become predictable. And it wasn’t like he had friends in other houses, his father wouldn’t have approved of that. And honestly, everyone seemed as dull as the other. Potter had been different though. He sparked an interest in Draco from the moment he refused his hand in first year. No one had stood up to him before.
“Did I say that?” Harry snapped and turned back to the fire. He was content to spend the rest of the night sulking when he remembered something. “Once the bond is strong will it be complete? Dumbledore made it sound like strengthening and completing the bond were two different things.”
“You see Malfoy, you may think you’re ready to start fresh but you’re not because you don’t know how to let down your guard. I ask a simple question and instead of an honest answer, you once again opt for sarcasm to hide behind.” Harry didn’t look up and tried to use the same formal tone Malfoy used with him. “And while I would like to start a friendship, I can’t until you let me in”
“I-I can’t control it exactly. I think the bond has been affecting us differently. Yes, I have managed to suppress some of the after affects of us fully bonding but I’m not completely unaffected. And I’m also not affected the way you are” Draco squirmed. Harry started to realise Draco fidgeted a lot when he was uncomfortable.
Madam Pomfrey nodded, casting a few spells. “He’ll be fine, although his anxiety levels seem too high. Especially unconscious. I’ll have a potion ready for when he wakes”
“Fighting the bond isn’t trying Draco. You said you wanted something but how is that ever meant to happen if you’re acting like the prat you used to be and fighting this every step of the way?”
“No seriously. When? Because I can’t think of anything. Your whole life has been about how you can end up on top. You believe you’re better than us all when you’re not. It’s pathetic and weak and-“
Draco opened his mouth but quickly closed it and smiled instead. He couldn’t say that. Ever.
With a deep breath, Draco tried to get Potter’s attention by saying his name once, twice, three times but with absolutely no response. “Oh, for the sake of Merlin Potter, get a grip!” Snapped Malfoy stalking right up to Harry’s side, determined to drag him to his feet. He could deal with a moody Potter or an angry Potter, but this unresponsiveness was starting to grate on him. But Malfoy hardly had one hand on Potter’s arm before he got a response.
Professor Dumbledore told us about you and Malfoy. I’m sorry about all this. I know it may seem bad, but we’ll figure something out. I’ve borrowed as many books on bonding from the library as I can and am hoping to find some useful information for you. Breaking the bond seems impossible but I’ll look, I promise. Even if I only find how the bond works, it’s something, right?
“You have been acting so damn calm like nothing is wrong. Are you really unaffected?” The question was genuine, but Harry didn’t wait for a response. “How can you be so casual? You’re up there taunting me as if it’s a normal game and it isn’t! None of this is normal! The bond is dragging me in circles, it is driving me mad and then you come along acting like nothing has happened. How?”
I certainly enjoyed writing this chapter so I hope you enjoy reading it :)
“This should help chase away any last aches and will help you both sleep” Pomfrey handed both boys a different vial which they drank silently. “Get some rest”
“He’s just getting dressed,” he said just as Harry walked out of the bedroom, in a pair of what seemed to be loose muggle jeans and a tight fitted top, and flashed Malfoy a small smile. Draco narrowed his eyes and turned back to Pomfrey.
(See the end of the chapter for
“How does it work then?” Asked Harry the previous anger having left him, effectively snapping Malfoy out of his thoughts. He elaborated when Malfoy continued to stare at him. “The bond? How does it work? How will it affect us once it’s strong?”
Clearing his throat, Draco began “Potter can…” He stopped, the words dying on his tongue.
“What…” Breathed Harry. He couldn’t think straight. His eyes were glued to where the two bands joined. “Are these-“
“It’s a manor” Draco corrected with a smirk.
Harry had no idea what time it was when he woke up, but he would have guessed about two or three in the morning. The hospital wing was dark and empty, any patients Pomfrey had having been dealt with and able to leave before curfew. Harry wasn’t sure what woke him up, but he realised with delight that he didn’t feel so weak anymore. That second potion Pomfrey gave him did the trick. He felt good.
“Draco” Harry whined, and this was all he needed. Draco slipped his hand into Harry’s underwear, fingers gently teasingly the hard, throbbing skin before he wrapped a hand around Harry’s cock and gave him firm pump.
Gingerly, he pushed himself up to sit against the back of the hospital bed, cringing when his body protested such a move. He slid on his glasses in time to see Madame Pomfrey hurrying over with a small tray.
Definitely not.
Draco knew Potter was there, stood watching him, assessing him. But he couldn’t bare looking up. The onslaught of emotions was too strong, and he knew Potter could feel it. Harry was going to ask what was wrong and Draco knew he had to say something to explain how he felt. Yet, despite having spent the past two hours planning and re-planning what he was going to say, the words didn’t feel right anymore. They didn’t mean enough, or maybe they meant too much. Draco felt cornered but after what Potter had said last night, he needed to do something.
Harry paused, “You don’t talk much about your father”
Draco’s blood ran cold. He knew it would happen but not so soon. Possible crazy headlines began to flood his mind again and he had to clench his fists to stop his hands from trembling.
“Through peace and wars”
Draco cursed and jumped on his broom, quickly ascending. Draco scanned the air, watching for that flash of gold when Harry appeared beside him, smirking. He opened his mouth to speak but his eyes locked on something in the distance over Draco's shoulder and Draco wasted no time.
They talked a little while longer before Hermione needed leave. Harry knocked on the bedroom door, “Draco? Could you come out please?”
But Draco wasn’t easily distracted. He was busy mapping out the contours of Harry’s face with his lips and tongue, trying to memorise every inch. Harry was beautiful. So strong and brave. His face seemed sculpted by gods. His jaw and chin, his cheeks and forehead. Draco traced it all, returning a few times to Harry’s ear and nibbling, drawing delicious moans.
“I do want something with you Draco. Whether that be friendship” Harry could feel the attack of sudden disappointment and quickly put his hand over one of Draco’s. “Or whether that be a relationship. I want what you’ll let me have.”
Sorry about the delay with this chapter! Enjoy and let me know what you think :)
They ate in silence and once Harry knew Malfoy was finished, he suggested they move to the sofas. Once there Harry had nowhere to go. It was time to talk.
The walk back was more uncomfortable than the walk to the potions room. Harry was a ball of nervous energy after Draco’s kiss. Adrenaline was pumping through him still and he had to keep telling himself to relax but he couldn't. How could he? Draco bloody Malfoy had kissed him. He couldn’t even believe it, that had to be the best kiss he had ever received by far. And it was from Draco. Merlin, could that guy kiss.
Harry was careful in his moves, knowing Draco was still testing this, testing Harry.
“I’m sure we have done more than enough for today Draco” Harry was close to begging at this point. They had gone over the work for today twice and already done most of their homework that had been set last week. Yet, every time Harry said he was done, Draco would find something else for him to do. “Let’s at least take a break. We could have lunch, play a game of wizards chess?” Harry suggested, gently closing Draco’s book, and taking his quill from his hand.
“I’d give yourself more credit than that” Harry commented.
“What you said last night when we got back. Did you mean it?” Draco repeated while his heart thudded loudly against his chest.
They climbed out the other side a corridor away from their rooms and the halls were thankfully empty. “We’ll have to use that again” Harry smiled.
Malfoy shrugged “There’s also option three” He lifted a hand and pointed “I could push you out that window” he suggested with a sideways glance at Harry and a smirk.
Draco’s stomach turned in unease and Harry could feel the slight anxiety suddenly creeping into Draco.
“You know you don’t have to be so polite to them, it’s their job” Malfoy informed Harry whilst moving to sit on the sofa behind him.
Draco looked away from Harry’s intense stare and smiled. “Thank you. Well, what about you?”
The walk was quiet and quick. An alcove near Dumbledore’s office seemed to have gathered a few third years and the stares received made Draco greatly uncomfortable. It was a relief when they got to the door, both muttering the password and disappearing up the staircase.
"Goodnight Draco"
“Hm… Never have I ever broke a bone” Draco said while refilling his glass.
Harry checked the time, “Well we don’t have long”
The conversation ended rather quickly after that. Neither of them spoke for a long while but neither of them moved either. Instead, they shared a slightly tense silence, wrapped up in their own worries and thoughts about how this could ever work between them. During their silence, a house-elf arrived asking if either of them wanted dinner since it was getting late. Both boys felt too uneasy to eat so after a polite refusal from Harry and a sharp “No” from Draco, the house-elf left.
A slow, almost wicked grin spread across his face.
Draco’s eyes flashed. “I don’t, that’s just a fact”
“Harry, we would get through this a lot swifter if you would refrain yourself from interrupting me. I know this is shocking, but I think Mr. Malfoy would appreciate this meeting being over with so if you would please” Dumbledore gestured to Harry’s seat which he sat back in and mumbled his apology. “Thank you. Now as I was saying, a private room has been set up for the two of you to allow the bond to settle, being around a lot of people will be counter-productive so I would prefer it if you stayed in your rooms for meals and I will be excusing you from classes for the first week. Madame Pomfrey will continue to check up on you and we will reassess the situation as the bond continues to develop. There will be house-elves for you to summon when you would like to eat and if you need anything else do not hesitate to ask. I would like you to also call on either me or Madame Pomfrey if you discover any developments whether that be good or bad. Understand?”
“Yes. You and me. Let’s go flying. Everyone will be in lessons now and the field will be empty. Come on, I am sick of these rooms” Harry pleaded. He needed to get out and clear his head before the bond made him do something stupid.
“So, do you plan on ignoring me all day or trying to avoid me?” Harry couldn’t help himself. Despite his teasing tone, he wanted to know which Draco he was getting today. And Draco felt his defenses go up immediately.
They ate, chatting as they did over easy topics. Harry learnt that Draco and his Mother had moved out of the manor for the time being and were staying in a flat nearby, Harry didn’t ask too much about it. Draco told Harry about is love for potions, to no one’s surprise and how he had always wanted to be a doctor until recently. Harry talked about how odd it was to find out he was a wizard and how he and Ron had met at the train station in first year.
Harry laughed softly. “Well yeah. That’s what happens. You go on a date, get to know the person and decide if there is an attraction there. Decide if you want to go out again”
“I guess” Draco wasn’t so sure.
Harry stood. “I want to know what you thought.”
“So” Harry smirked, taking a few steps forward. “What was that all about?” He asked. He knew he was teasing but he couldn’t help it, watching Draco fidget was so unlike him and it made Harry feel slightly giddy with power.
“Make me Malfoy” Harry smirked and in that moment of exchange, the snitch was gone.
“What would you like to know?” Draco tried to sound calm, but he was worried about what Potter would ask him.
“So” Draco repeated and found himself laughing softly. “Where do we go from here?”
Draco stood still and crossed his arms, glaring at Harry. “Give it to me” He repeated.
“I’ve just always been thin” Harry said with a shrug.
“I want to talk, and I think it’d be better on a full stomach” Harry smiled encouragingly, pulling out a seat for Draco then pulling out his own. “Care to join me?”
“I may have thought something alone those lines” Harry smiled.
Draco took his shot, reveling in the sharp taste and the burning slide down his throat. Potter was right, a bit of liquid courage never hurt anyone.
“Leave it Potter” Draco turned to storm off but Harry grabbed his arm.
“Of course, I’m free tonight. Why are you being weird?”
Harry had a plan. It had many holes, but it was something. The first part was getting Draco out of the bedroom.
“A what?!” Harry almost jumped out of his seat while Malfoy paled, almost resembling Professor Binns.
“Wow, thanks Draco” Harry chuckled.
“Shit!” Harry threw his head back against Draco’s shoulder, thrusting into his curled fingers. Harry already felt so close. Draco began stroking Harry, drawing up slowly, running his thumb over the tip and pulling the skin back as he drove back down.
Dumbledore didn’t linger long. He bid them both a nice evening and left swiftly with that ever so annoying twinkle in his eye.
Harry looked far away for a moment and then turned back to Draco. “I have a question for you. Why did Hermione bother you so much?”
This couldn’t be this difficult. There had to be something easier, a way to make things simpler. Harry was wracking his brain for ideas. Maybe he could sneak into the potions office and steal some Veritaserum. No. That wouldn’t go down well at all. Or maybe he could just shake Malfoy until he let Harry in. Somehow Harry thought that would go down worse than slipping Draco a truth serum.
“Do you miss him?” Harry probably should have left it, but he couldn’t.
“Exactly” Draco took a breath to calm himself down. “You don’t understand”
Harry wanted to know how Draco felt. He must feel something. Harry was sure he did, but he didn’t know how Draco would react if Harry acted on his own growing feelings. Twice Draco had pulled away now. It didn’t upset Harry as much as it frustrated him. He couldn’t figure out if Draco was playing with him or nervous. He would have guessed the latter.
“Hey. We’ve got this” Harry’s voice was a near whisper to avoid disturbing the air. His face wasn’t masked or smiling, it was raw and honest and everything Draco needed to let himself firmly take Harry’s hand.
“Really? Why?”
“Shhh” Harry hushed.
Ah, the mask is back then, thought Harry, that didn’t take long. “Good morning Madame Pomfrey,” he said politely.
Harry was immediately cut off by Draco’s lips on his own. They were rough and demanding yet sweet and soft and edging on desperate. He kissed Harry as if it were the last thing he would ever do, firmly holding Harry's face. Harry stood frozen for a moment, but only a moment before he responded. He wrapped his arms tightly around Draco’s waist and pulled him closer, kissing Draco with equal enthusiasm while Draco began winding his fingers through Harry’s thick locks.
Draco swooped in, capturing Harry’s lips. Harry opened his mouth, welcoming Draco in and their tongues met, slowly exploring each other’s mouths. The kiss was long and leisurely but came to an end when Harry shifted and cringed at the drying wetness in his underwear.
“I know but it doesn’t hurt to be nice,” Harry said simply, sitting on the opposite sofa and grabbing a sandwich from the table. “Besides,” he said with a chuckle “Hermione would have my head if she caught me even using a house-elf, never mind being rude to one” He smiled fondly.
He gently pressed his forehead against Harry’s and closed his eyes, breathing him in before casually asking, “Yes?”
“Right” Draco ran a hand through his hair and sat up a bit straighter. “Every wizard and witch have a unique magical core. We had that one lesson in charms where we were asked to try and feel for our own if you remember. This bond is going to mix our magical cores so instead of us both having a core that is unique to one of us, it will become a completely new core unique to us both.” Potter nodded, still very pale.
There was nothing wrong with the room they had been given, both boys would have even appreciated them if it hadn’t been for the circumstances that they had been gifted them. It was like their own dormitory. The main room was lovely with two large sofas, a table between and a roaring fire which was already warming the room quite nicely. Dumbledore even had a dining table and several large, stocked bookshelves to be added so the room felt comfier. What neither boys liked was the single bedroom. Harry had hoped they would at least be given separate rooms but that wasn’t the case, however, they had been graced with two beds. The room was decorated in an attempt to keep both of them happy. This was clear through the odd mix of red and green sheets and pillows.
Harry shook his head. “No, but it could be an easy way for us to start getting to know each other”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What did you dream about?” Draco muttered, his hand now teasing the waistband of Harry’s pants, one finger slipping in to brush his skin.
