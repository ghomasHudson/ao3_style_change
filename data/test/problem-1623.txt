Where Harry had never seen Astoria without painted fingernails, even if they were chipped most of the time, Daphne had very beautiful, long nails which were held at a practical length. The only makeup she was wearing was a deep red lip and a faint dark eyeliner. There was neither glitter in her face nor had she styled her hair in a particular manner. It just hung loose unto her chin, being parted slightly more on the right side of her face. It was definitely died a few nuances brighter than her natural colour as far as he could remember.
Sometimes he still wondered if a part of him had stayed dead back then.
Until Draco leant forward again and touched his hands softly. Both.
Harry had assumed that this would also happen to the card by Molly when it had arrived. Draco seemed to be rather confused when he received the envelop and turned his back towards Harry while reading it. He could only assume it was the invitation because of the owl which had brought it and automatically was sure it would end in the bin. Imagine how shook he was when a grinning Draco had pinned it on top of the other invitations, throwing away the invitation for the Great Christmas Dinner from the Society of Queer Witches and Wizards instead.
Maybe, his erection already painfully pressing against his own jeans whispered into his mind, this was a game he could play as well.
Today it somehow felt a bit different as is this half-conscious state he realized the aching of his heart was replaced by a slight shimmer of happiness. The awareness that in fact the person he was so desperately searching for was at his own place, hopefully sleeping peacefully.
There was genuine interest flickering in his eyes, overlaying something which was harder to read. A dare? Hope? His voice had the same smooth tone as usual, not displaying many emotions but Harry had known the other man for a while now to read the tinier signals, the leaning in the conversation, the rubbing together of his fingers, to understand that the answer to this question was of utter importance and would be a main factor determining how their relationship would continue from this moment on an which direction it would take.
He decided Friday was as good a day as any other as they would have the next day off and Teddy was supposed to go to Mrs. Malfoy. And he even managed to get there just in time, neither too early nor too late.
“I am ready, let’s do this.”
The former Slytherin was just about to start telling the as he called it ‘dramatic story of how Blaise Zabini conquered and broke my tiny precious heart for the first time’ when a glimpse at the clock behind him made him stop talking and frowning for a moment.
“I have been there. I cannot do this again. Even I am not willing to be the one in the shadows anymore.”
There was something Draco did not dare to say. It would be only logical if it were an invitation. Their messaging had led into no other direction. Harry grinned like a mad man and decided to open an own bottle of beer. He even took a (rather bad to be honest) picture of it standing on the kitchen counter and sent it to Draco with the caption “Cheers to you Draco.”
Which brought him back to wondering why it always was the same time slot. They were meeting each other for casual drinks for over two months now. The days tended to differ; the time of the days however always stayed the same. Before leaving first, the former Slytherin always suggested a date for their next meeting “at the usual time”.  So far, Harry did not have the guts to ask the other man if there was a reason for that. He could already imagine plenty such as Malfoy not wanting to be seen with him or the blond aristocrat attending fancy balls and other high society gatherings in the evenings. Maybe it was as simple as Malfoy not wanting him to feel like they were dating. Which they were not! Harry could never imagine actually dating a man, particularly not Draco Malfoy! In fact, he could hardly imagine himself ever dating someone.
Of course, it was her who grabbed his hand, caressed it and made him look at her. She was so strong, even with tears in his eyes. They looked at each other for a long time without saying anything. In the end they hugged goodbye and she whispered into his ear.
It was not that he did not love her. He still had genuine feelings for her, like for a sister. With Draco it was different. There was a constant pulling and longing in his chest, a desire to be close to him. They hadn’t seen each other for a week now and other than the Howler and the explanation of what he was expected to do, Harry hadn’t heard from Draco either. Which normally would not trouble him as he was used to not hear from people quite much (what happens when one of your closest friends is Luna Lovegood). This time however he was almost dying as he hated the tension between them so much.
“Imagine me having to suffer through those evenings by myself before Hermione decided to side with me,” Ginny begged for pity. “You know, you will have to suffer through this every year from now on, making a happy face around those sappy people?”, she asked.
He definitely had not expected Draco to pick him up without any Glamour.
Harry started feeling quite bad for himself. Were his looks really that much of a disaster that he needed saving? With a slowly raised eyebrow Draco looked at him and their eyes met. He could have sworn there was a mischievous spark in them, as if the other man knew something she did not see.
“See, I really suck at this! The whole dating thing. I mean I normally do not even let it get that far. A guy starts liking me because of my looks and the way I behave outside but as soon as it gets more intimate, like getting to know each other intimate, not the plainly physical stuff, they automatically get bored. They realize I am not what they were expecting and then they loose interest. But then there was you and we were friends before and I thought it would maybe be different because you knew me but I still tried everything to impress you with offering drinks and bringing pizza and dressing up. I mean, who goes to someone else’s house wearing pants so tight you can barely sit in them? I am trying so hard to impress you that I completely forgot this is not about making you think I am hot and easy to go but interesting but actually showing who I am. But I somehow am still not sure you will like who I am. And then I forced myself to do everything that normally works to impress you like bringing food, acting comfortable around your kitchen, lounging on your couch to invite you to just well touch me and nothing works. And right now, I am really frustrated and I thought about just leaving as I normally do when dates do not work out. And then I looked around and noticed how hard you were trying, not only with the food but with how this place looks like and everything and I suddenly realized that maybe you are just trying to impress me as hard as I do and this might be the reason why we are stuck in this loop of forcefully trying to show of our best side when actually I want nothing more than to sit with you on that tiny couch, eating all the food and watching a series we both know by heart and sharing awkward side-glances and feel my skin prickle everytime we accidentally touch until the tension gets unbearable and I cannot help myself but toss down the pizza box and snog you senseless!”
He sat in front of the fireplace – if you consider a five-year-old shifting from his knees to his bum without any rest ‘sitting’ and grinned at Harry. The expression on his face reminded the elder so much of his own god father, he could not help but feel a short pain in his chest, the feeling of being reminded that there is someone missing from your life and it still hurts when you remember them. For the first time however, Harry managed to not only see Sirius in the boy but also a hint of Draco. Maybe it was the self-confidence that seemed to be running in the family.
“So, Potter, why me?”, he just asked instead of greeting the other man first. It was a very simply and logical question to ask concerning the situation. Still, Harry was not sure how to answer, how to start. Deep down inside of him the one voice kept screaming that Malfoy only wanted to make fun of him, embarrass him, use his weaknesses against him.
“So, you thought that the old queen Draco had nothing else to do than teach you how to be a proper poof?”, he asked, the familiar snarl in his voice. But it was accompanied by something else. If you listened carefully, you could notice a soft undertone in the voice, something playful and almost caring. Harry however had never been quite sensitive to undertones and this is why no one at this point should be surprised by him not getting the hint that Malfoy was indeed just joking.
Harry was already consumed by how he planned to make an entrance, explaining his case to Draco, showing off how impossible the other man had reacted, when the phone in his hands rang once. A text-message.
”If I tell you, he swings the other way round, he does, even though me might not have realized it himself!”, Draco explained to Harry very excitedly. They were once again meeting at “their” bar, coffeeshop or however you would like to call it. Harry himself wasn’t sure about that either. The products sold there ranged from drinks to food and even shirts so a definite decision about the actual purpose of the store was hard to make. However, there was one thing he was sure about: It was a trendy place!
This message resulted in Teddy squeaking happily when Harry read it to him. It also reminded the two boys that it was time to go back home. Before Teddy went to school, he had no friends outside the wizarding world but this had changed a lot until now. Andromeda would be home in about ten minutes to escort the boy to a playdate he had arranged himself. So, this meant that Harry’s time with him would be over pretty soon. When Teddy still had been a toddler, he would always cry when Harry left. Now it was Harry feeling a bit empty when he dropped of his godson and realized that he had a long day of doing nothing ahead of him. With a shrug of his shoulders he took out his phone again and replied to Astoria.
His heart skipped more than one beat while he was reading that. It was so Draco to tell him what to do and not allow Harry to not write and put effort into their friendship but he was more than happy. In the back of his mind he had actually considered their relationship to be over and the pink-haired man never speaking to him. With a tiny grin on his face Harry decided maybe he should for once do exactly what Draco told him to and buy presents.
Exactly five days later at around 6.30 pm, which was a Saturday (which is important to know because it would have been one of the Saturdays Teddy normally spent with Harry), Teddy firecalled his godfather, some thing he only was allowed to do when he got so excited he would refuse to go to sleep for hours if he could not tell Harry every detail of his adventures.
Harry had always wondered what exactly had drawn Hermione towards Ron in the first place. But now as they had gotten married shortly before baby Hugo was born (and only because pregnancy hormones had made Hermione finally give in to Ron’s pleading to become his wife she had explained later, dreamingly petting her wedding bouquet) and were still going strong as a couple he started to finally understand. Their whole living room told their story.
Of course, they had been! Back then they were children just as much as he himself and his friends. The prejudice that the other house was constantly plotting evil schemes against him was something he thought he had overcome a long time ago. Wasn’t it obvious, Draco was not the tiny Malfoy brat anymore?
“Oh, quite on the contrary. Mother would love to announce the two of us were dating or at least fucking.” The expression coming from his lips sounded vulgar and tempting at the same time. “However, I calmly explained to her that neither of this was the case. I mean, you are not even sure if you are into men at all, despite I would definitely not be a suitable option at all.”
“Bad enough, that I am living with a man who is definitely not going to marry me!”, she sighted dramatically while getting comfortable on the small dark brown couch. Harry decided to keep her company as it really started to feel weird standing in the middle of a room, holding a cup of tea. She put her legs on the cushions as well and Harry noticed she was actually wearing comfortable sweat pants. Somehow, he did not expect her to even own such a piece of clothing. At the same moment when he scolded himself for this silly thought he wondered if that could mean Draco also wore comfortable clothes at home. He could definitely not imagine that at all!
The other body moved away slowly and all that remain was the lingering scent of a promise which never fulfilled. Draco had gone towards the kitchen, making the space between them bigger.
Some conversations become especially had when you have to have them with your mother. Or someone who is like a mother to you. In Harry’s case this would be Molly Weasley, the woman who brought him to the train on his first year at Hogwarts, the person sending him Christmas gifts every year, the one human being whose anger would always scare him to death. For a long time, Harry had argued with himself that he could not simply replace his real mother with the head of the Weasley house (I am sorry Arthur, but we all know this is true!) but finally he had come to a conclusion: One could feel towards more than one person like they were your mother. It was not blood binding them but the love only a mother could have for her children.
Interestingly enough, Malfoy had very well established himself as one of the most demanded and successful consultants the Ministry of Magic worked with. Furthermore, he had explicitly refused to directly work for them, stating that he wanted to remain his own boss with nobody to push him around. It had been quite a surprise after the war that he did not try to leave all of his past behind and simply pretend to have moved on. Nor did he strictly follow every old tradition. He decided to go his very own way, as he explained himself to the press, by serving the Ministry as freelancing consultant in an area where they had been lacking expertise for ages as no other wizard actually connected to the Dark Arts would have ever considered working for the government. Sometimes Harry wondered if such a job decision would also be an option for him. It was not that he was unhappy at his office and having someone else to decide for you when you had to work, what times you had to take off and what jobs you should take surely had its upsides…
“Harry Dear, can you give me your phone number in case Draco misses another rendezvous? You know, just in case we have to start a nationwide search once again,” she explained while attempting to keep a straight face. Without even waiting for his answer, she stuffed her phone into his hands and let him no other choice than add his number to her contacts. The phone lay heavy in his hands. It was one of the brand-new ones, no less than 2 months old Harry would assume. Had he only been given the phone and the task to spot the owner of it in the room without any further piece of information, he would have still known it belonged to Astoria, he thought. The case was pitch black and featured all kinds of cute but creepy animals on them. It was on the very verge of still being stylish and not considered corny, but somehow it fit her.
“Oh boy, you definitely are. I mean you had good intentions but has it never occurred to you that you might violate Malfoy’s pride by deciding to interfere in his business life over his head?”
His mouth went dry thinking about the implication of when he would look at them again. He felt his cheeks heating up as well as his groin aching with desire and knew the answer. Anyhow it would have definitely been Draco he would think about while touching himself. Now he did not need to only use his imagination but had the chance to look at the real thing.
He could do nothing else but raise his voice in this situation. Why was Draco giving him such a hard time and did not believe he was gay? This again reminded him so much of the teasing and provocations they had during school. He knew he had to stay calm but boy, did he want to shake Draco right now!
Harry literarily felt himself sink into his chair and grown at least three inches smaller.
Without looking up he sat up on the couch and therefore added more distance between them.
When he turned towards Draco to finally answer the question, their noses almost bumped together. The other man was still leaning in closely, probably to make it easier for him to answer without having to scream against the loud music. For a moment their faces were so close, their lips were almost in kissing distance. Then luckily their drinks came and Harry had the opportunity to change the subject. They were sticking to the same cocktail as they had before and it almost tasted the same as the ones Draco had made back at home.
From the very first day on Draco of course has claimed the one old, gigantic wooden chair in the garden for himself and spends huge amounts of time there reading. Harry was more than pleasantly surprised to find his boyfriend sitting there completely at peace with himself when he returned from work on a Friday afternoon. Carefully not to disturb the other man, he walks closer only to be greeted by a warm smile twitching around the corners of the pink-haired’s mouth. A clear sign, Draco is up to something.
The pink haired man started shaking his head and it became obvious Hugo was fascinated by the colour of his hair. He managed to get up and touch the neatly combed back strands, destroying the presumably two hours of work Draco had spent on perfecting his hair style. Hermione instantly tried to grab her boy and force him to stop but instead Draco supported little Hugo with one arm, conspiratorially smirking at her.
With a grin on his face he turns towards the backseat where Daphne eagerly flics through a giant old-fashioned CD-collection, unsure what to choose. Finally, she pulls out one with a triumphant grin on her face and hands it over towards Harry.
Returning back home to Grimaulde Place made him realize how much he grew to hating Sundays by himself. He so much had gotten used to hanging around with his new friends that now the idea of being on his own on a day he had nothing to do quite scared him. So, after a warm shower he decided to text Astoria and ask her to send him the pictures of the night before. He knew her well enough to know such a request would automatically lead to longer texting. Also, he needed to know if it was ok for her to show Teddy a picture of her outfit.
“Gosh, can’t the two of you stop being that adorable and get a room instead?”, Ginny ended the awkward silence, smirking at both of them while Harry wrapped an arm around his boyfriend, whispering to him that blue indeed was his colour. Somehow this whole evening turned out better than he had ever dared to dream of.
“But we are who we are and therefore can’t be anyone else.”
“Yes, Potter,” Draco broke into an embarrassed little laughter which Harry later on would only describe as utterly sweet, something Draco would always hate him say. Indeed, when they later told the story of how they got together Draco’s version would be him being way more confident, smart and cool and Harry would add a ton of sappy details on how bright the grey eyes were glowing, how electrifying their touches were and everyone around would roll their eyes, listening to the same story for probably the hundredth time while trying to remember really hard that those two who obviously were meant to be together from the beginning had not always been the nauseously sweet couple who would after years still send longing gazes over the room.
And not because he could not come up with any reason. In fact, it were too many so he did not know where to start. Maybe because the other man was very real, maybe because he was funny, maybe because he had grown so much as a person or his tendencies to fight his battles on his own without relying on anyone else. Maybe it was because he cared for his friends, maybe it was the save space he offered Harry, the open ear, his secret world. Or maybe it was because he was smoking hot and confident in his body – something Harry still had to learn. Maybe it was his whole attitude, his charm and self-confidence or the fact that he did not put Harry on any pedestal and put him above all other living beings but saw him as equal. Maybe it was because he exactly knew which buttons to push, where to touch him, to make him willing to do anything within mere seconds – but we are skipping ahead again.
Not Charlie, not Molly, not even Ron or Hermione. He was too scared of them asking uncomfortable questions, forcing him to explore his - maybe - true sexuality.
Harry had to stop reading at this point. Well, this was not that bad, was it? One could read it like Draco was only trying to protect him and that was a good thing, wasn’t it? Unfortunately, we all know our favourite Gryffindor has always had a hard time accepting people deciding what was good for him over his head. Maybe, a tiny little voice in his head told him, he had secretly hoped Draco would simply out him so he would not have to do this by himself.
Draco returned his smile and nodded.
And then the bell rang and his confidence was gone.
Everything went so well, Harry once again wondered where into his name wouldn’t open him any door. Misses Imogen Algherion was more than happy to finally hear from someone “capable”. It was a pleasure, such a pleasure to receive a message from Harry Potter himself, the renown expert in everything concerning Dark Magic. Her husband and her would have reached out to him long time ago wouldn’t it have been pretentious to assume the hero of the wizarding world had time for their case. But now that he let the Ministry call them, they were more than glad, so delighted to hear from Mr. Potter.
“And this is something you could not simply have texted me? Instead you decided to stalk on me while I was having a lovely time over some drinks with a – friend?” It was only at the very last part of the sentence that Malfoy looked at him once again, an unasked question between them. While Harry was still wondering if he really considered himself and his former school rival actual friends now, Astoria Greengrass (whom he now finally remembered as the rather timid Slytherin girl two years below them) asked the exact same question:
He smiled lazily while starting to mix a drink they would share while talking about anything else but their feelings. Harry knew he would leave after this drink and again not return to the apartment for a long time.
There was only one way to find out and his godson had already been bagging him to send her a picture of his masterpiece, needing to know if she approved of his fashion choices. This was not a test if Teddy had nailed her outfit but rather him wanting to know if she understood his concept of how to dress. Harry ruffled through the little boy’s hair after having taken the picture and added a “
“I think it helped a bit.”
Harry Potter had never been the tallest guy, neither in his class nor in the Quidditch team. Even Ginny was only an inch smaller than himself which forced her to always wear flats when they were out together. Until today he had never considered his height an actual problem but when he thought about Draco and how much the other man towered him, he suddenly felt insecure. Maybe the beautiful pink haired was not into smaller men at all. Was there any hex to make him grow a foot?
Maybe this was why he had decided to tell Andromeda last. Because she had to know the full truth as well as it would hurt her the most.
“Actually, we do not have that much time left Draco. My Glamour has already started fading and I am not so sure about yours either.”, she explained to him, brushing through his hair with a concentrated look, as if she was searching for something on his scalp. Again, that Glamour thing. Harry started wondering what this was supposed to mean. Malfoy – Draco! – looked like always, what reasons could he possibly have to enchant his appearance?
When they left the restaurant, Draco quickly squeezed his upper right arm and gave him a genuine smile.
But it did not seem like Draco was in any mood to talk about what happened last night. Instead he stopped at the opposite side of the couch as Astoria had and made a slow gesture with his hand, implying that Harry should move. Without a word he let himself crush on the couch as well and turned on the telly. All of this happened so naturally that our favourite Gryffindor wondered if it was part of their Sunday routine?
Harry just had finished his masterpiece with a last clean-up glamour and carefully placed the vegetable sticks on the table in the living room when the doorbell rang. All over sudden his palms became sweaty and he could already feel his blood pressure rising. Hopefully, this night would be better. Hopefully he did not screw up again.
He had been dreaming of Draco, searching for him, needing him in his life somehow but could not get a grip of him because in the dream reality he did not exist.
They were watching a sitcom Harry did not know but still had no problem following as the plot was rather light hearted. He noticed Astoria dozing of every so often. Draco also did not really pay attention to what was happening on the screen but rather starred at it blankly. Somehow it was both weird to sit next to each other and not talk and at the same time Harry was eternally grateful to not be forced to discuss the night before right now. His head still hurt and the silly TV-program helped over the silence between them. When Astoria was touching his feet, leaning on them while taking a nap, Draco managed to avoid touching him at all. Harry wondered if the other man was afraid, he had given away the wrong impression and was scared now, he had fallen for him.
Harry loved both of them if love was an expression fitting to describe the range of emotions. He was so proud of how they managed to keep up, impressed by how they made things work, amazed by ideas and projects they did, fascinated with how they worked as a functioning family and most importantly glad to have them.
Waking up he felt an overwhelming sadness inside of him as if something had been stolen. Someone.
With fury in her eyes she quickly walked in front of him, drilling her long finger into his chest.
He really did not try to be seductive or anything. For the first time he just simply did what his guts told him to and it seemed to be a whole success as suddenly there was a hand gripping his collar and soft but eager lips pressing against his in such a forceful manner their noses bumped into one another the first second before they figured out placement. Harry immediately leant into the kiss, tightening his grip around the waistband, now pulling so hard, their hips actually touched, his hand between them, feeling the precious softness of unknown skin below the fabric.
“Harry, darling, you can’t be serious!”
Harry’s eyes wandered from pictures of Draco together with Oliver Wood over to Blaise Zabini and other men accompanying him to various events. All had in common that the stood a bit too close to the other man while their picture had been taken and all of them made sure their outfits would match. In none of them Draco was actually smiling, even though his face clearly showed a self-confident expression. Oh, he somehow did not like where this was going.
“Potter, this isn’t a joke to you, is it?”, he carefully asked. His voice was much quieter than before as if he wanted to make sure this conversation stayed between the two of them. The smirk around his face was gone. It had been replaced by a faint frown. When Harry finally found the courage to look up again his gaze was met by very earnest looking grey eyes. The atmosphere of this conversation had changed completely.
Harry’s anger and confusion that had built up in the last half an hour together with the fear of being a burden really wanted to get out, he was trying his best to provoke a fight but Draco’s next response ended the topic immediately.
Giving up on that particular move he instead practiced raising a single eyebrow to look witty, which he also could not manage to do. He really put force into the muscles on his forehead but it did not help, his stupid bushy eyebrows refused to move one by itself and rather stick together like a giant caterpillar. Maybe he should thin out his brows to soften his face. The weary hands touched his own chin, pushing the stubbles forward while he pulled a face. A beard could help cover up his strong chin and the small chip in it. Or was a harsh jawline considered attractive in men? Critically he moved his face from one side to another pushing his lips around.
The next day Harry got up as usually around 6.30, stumbled into the kitchen to prepare his coffee and the slurp into the bathroom. Every morning he was wondering how he even managed to find his mouth with his toothbrush. Since he had been living on his own, getting up in the morning was way less stressful as he did not have to talk to people anymore. Luckily. He hated talking before coffee.
Ginny was as pretty as always, her read hair radiating with sunlight, her sun-kissed forearms covered with the most beautiful set of freckles. She watched him curiously from over the tip of her mug. Her fingers curled around the yellow piece of porcelain as naturally as she fit into his kitchen. Her presence here made so much sense that for a moment Harry had no words but simply missed the time when she would be spending her nights here.
Another thing Harry James Potter certainly was very wrong about was the maximum of nervousness his body could survive. It had been only yesterday when he was certain he could not stomach more than the anxiety of having to face dozens of press people at once while revealing such a private thing to the world as his sexuality. He guessed wrong.
“Well, everyone decides how they want to be seen in public, do they not?”, he answers cryptically. This is the one thing that had been frustrating Harry for weeks now. Whenever he tried to address how his outing had actually affected Malfoy, the other man always managed to either be cryptic or change subjects completely. But this time he would not give up so easily.
He prepared himself to re-enter the club when he finally realized that someone had been following him. Someone with a very distinctive pink head of hair, currently standing a few feet away, a lit cigarette in his mouth. The long, elegant fingers grabbed the small thing and pushed it away from the lips slowly, watching Harry carefully. Draco did not really smile nor did he not. There was a tiny twitching at the outer corner of his lips but nothing more when he decided to come closer.
He managed to use his famous name to help someone who was important to him and that felt great. Harry still grinned a bit like a maniac even long after he had put away the letter. It was all to easy. One call at the ministry to ask for the head inspector working on the Algherion case. A quick three minute chat with someone called Firsesteen, a really nervous looking woman in her thirties who would have never expected to talk to Harry Potter this morning other wise she….(this was where he had interrupted her). He plain simply told her he was interested in the case personally and she would do him a favour if she convinced the Algherions Draco Malfoy was their best choice.
“Was you shagging another guy the reason you and the Weaslette broke up?”, Malfoy curiously asked, forcing all the colour to drop from Harry’s face at once. He eagerly shook his head, maybe a bit to forceful and returned to staring at the table in front of him. Noticing the shift in the atmosphere between them, Malfoy leaned in once again and lowered his voice quite a bit.
“If you were anyone else in the world I would maybe reconsider because”, Soft fingertips were brushing over his cheek and he wanted to lean in. They were already gone after a second, “I would hopelessly fall for you.”
He was afraid of the silence that followed his confession. Maybe he had misread the situation once more and this was not Draco showing him, he appreciated the big gesture. The other man leant even more towards the table, putting his elbows on it so that their hands almost touch. Something inside Harry thought this was a great imagery, the hands being a symbol for the distance between them, close but still a large step to go.
And for a few seconds this perfect image took over Harry’s mind: Draco getting up in the morning, all ruffled up, hair undone and still half asleep while he himself would already be waiting in the kitchen with two steaming hot cups of Draco’s favourite tea in the old, chipped mugs. Draco would sit not opposite but directly next to him at the small kitchen table, so close that pasts of their body would always touch. There would not be a lot of talking but small gestures like Draco holding up his hand, waiting for the milk. Draco’s leg hooking in with Harry’s. Draco putting the mugs into the sink when they were finished. Draco yawning carelessly and wrapping his stretched arms around Harry, pressing a kiss onto his lips.
It was Draco who interfered. Watching the whole discussion and immediately recognizing Harry’s discomfort he discouraged her very effectively:
“This terrible home décor decision, pressed upon my beautiful apartment by two malevolent witches illustrates the colourful story of how I tried to express my inner unicorn through different hair colours,” he managed to explain with a straight face, sounding more than stern. Had it not been for Astoria who broke out in laughter, Harry may have thought the other man was serious.
Whenever they had this type of serious conversation Draco tended to end it with something that was actually helpful. He, however, always paired it with a tiny insult – even if it was just going back to last names. Still, Harry thought, he had a point.  Do not rush it. When Hermione had given him the very same advice, he had simply shrugged it off. From Draco it seemed to carry more weight. “Maybe because he knows the feeling of being unsure”, she had explained with a knowing smile. Harry hated it when she gave him that look as if she knew a secret, he should be obvious about as well but wouldn’t want to ruin the moment of enlightenment for him.
They sat there in silence for a few moments, both obviously uncertain how to proceed, the food in between them before Draco tried his best to give Harry an encouraging smile and explained to him, he should not let the dish get waisted.
And there he was, Draco Malfoy in a giant blue self-made knitted pullover, featuring a huge white “D” across his chest, grinning sheepishly at his boyfriend while Molly Weasley could not be prouder of herself. Draco Malfoy was wearing a Weasely Christmas sweater and he seemed to be pretty fond of it, obviously still waiting for an answer.
‘Weird’, Harry thought to himself, ‘in the beginning he used to talk so much about himself, trying to impress me but he stopped that. Not the impressing but the talking.’ Did Draco consider his deeds done? Or was it maybe because our favourite Gryffindor essentially never gave away anything about himself nor asked about details when being told some information. He definitely had to step up his game if he wanted to get closer to Draco. As soon as he had decided
After a while Draco decided to address the elephant in the room.
“So, should we just meet up again here in let’s say a week or so? I mean, you still owe me drinks!”
Silence.
“But not the eyeliner thing. I tried that but it made my eyes pop out even more.”
With that she turned towards Harry now facing him.
Harry did in fact receive one more picture that evening. This time Draco’s face was not in the picture. Neither was his torso. However, the bulge in his towel, giving away a rather concrete impression of what was hidden beneath, was indeed interesting as well.
Draco gives him this adorable half smile he fell for the first second he ever saw it and lazily traces the lines of his face with his fingers: the jaw, the bridge of his nose, over his bottom lip. And all Harry can think of is that sometimes, only sometimes life cannot be more perfect than is these moments. He almost leans into the kiss when Draco leans back at him and nods towards the open backdoor.
This was definitely to much. Harry jumped to his feet and ran out of the living room, leaving Charlie behind who was shrugging his shoulders and mumbling he just had tried to be helpful.
“Harry, if it is just a crush, why are you here? And if it could be more you should definitely make up you mind about it. Getting closer to Draco will for sure cost a lot of effort and won’t be easy. Before you overthink what he might find attractive about you, find out what you like about him and how deep this feelings go.”
Which brings us to the morning that Harry would later often refer to as the moment he knew he had to do something if he wanted to win Draco’s heart. If you asked Draco on that matter he would smirk lazily and explain he did it simply to be presentable in society again, not to force Harry into action. But if you looked closely you would notice that not a single time they were asked about this incident, Draco managed to not look at Harry with this loving expression in his eyes that makes his knees weak until today.
I feel like it is time to show Draco's perspective at this point of the story, so keep an eye open in the next few days for a Fic titled "Draco Malfoy has a broken heart" ;)
Minutes past like hours as he was starring at the words he had tipped into his phone. A simple message, light conversation, an easy start. But there was no response and Harry started wondering if he had made a mistake. Did Draco even have his number or would he just assume it was a stranger texting him? Maybe he thought the message came from a past shag trying to get in touch again.
Fumbling with the fabric of his boxy old pair of jeans, he was sitting in her kitchen – the place he maybe loved the most in the world (except for Draco’s couch!) – unable to look her in the eye while he was searching for words. It had been hard enough to ask her to meet up, this seemed close to impossible. He definitely did not know how to start.
Draco obviously did so. Meeting them in the living room his hair still a bit wet and undone he took quite a while looking up and down Harry’s outfit, something the latter would have been embarrassed about a few weeks ago but he had gotten used to Draco’s judgemental stare when it came to fashion and somehow even felt proud because this was the very first time he had ever gotten one of those. This maybe was the greatest validation of all.
Draco shrugged a bit.
Automatically, Harry scolded himself. Of course, Draco’s ‘guests’ would normally not stay on his couch but rather in his bed. Thinking back, he noticed that Draco did not really seem to be the guy to kiss and tell. In fact, the other man had not mentioned any detail about his current dating life. But maybe that was just normal. He reached for the hang over potion, took a long sip and leaned back onto the couch, letting the slight drowsiness carry him back to sleep.
“I have never been in a situation where as much as I wanted to get into someone’s pants, I also really want to get to know them. So, can I just maybe stay over night and we try to take things slowly as we kind of started dating just now and then see if you indeed want to have something more with me in any kind of relationship manner and not only because of the physical stuff? If that is ok with you?”
The response turned out to be a bit different to what he had expected. Instead of simply sending the pictures she had added him to a group chat and uploaded them there. The chat had two more members, two unfamiliar numbers. Luckily, he realized, both members had added a nickname. One was “The one and Daphne”, the other one simply said “D.M.”. Somehow Harry could feel how much Draco would have wanted his signature to be spelled cursive. Then he finally took a look at the pictures.
Were his lips supposed to be so thin? His upper lip was almost invisible and the bottom one not really any taller. Those lips in the mirror did not really scream “kiss me”, did they? They looked scratchy and dry and brittle. He should definitely work on that if he ever wanted to kiss Draco again. Rubbing the stubbles on his cheeks again he focused his gaze on his hair.
With every moment Harry knows he falls more and more in love with this weird, arrogant, extravagant beautiful person. He is completely lost by now, he knows. And he could not care less. With every quirk he discovers this warm thing inside of him, that screams ‘Draco’ from the top of his lungs and seems to cover almost every inch of his insides, just grows and grows.
And as simply as that she sent him a picture with the actual address of her or let’s be honest Draco’s apartment. To Harry’s surprise, the street was not anywhere near muggle London but in the very heart of the city centre. Maybe this was the reason Malf – Draco was so secretive about his address. When Harry thought about it, nobody seemed to know where the blond man actually lived as all written conversation took place via owls which were discretely sent to an owling station. Obviously, Draco did not like surprise visits so Harry definitely would not simply go there without the other man’s permission.
“I ordered steaks as a main.”
With what can only be described as a very theatrical sob, Malfoy took a sip from his drink. It smelled like herbs and citrus, something Harry would not have expected the other man to drink. Staring blankly at the glass in the other man’s hand, our beloved Gryffindor decided it was time to make his former house pride and finally find the courage to talk.
Introduction: Astoria Greengrass, bane of Draco's very existence ;)
“Yes, it is,” he simply said, taking another sip from his drink and starring in the opposite direction. And with that their fight was over and Harry decided that from now on he should maybe better mind his own business. If Draco preferred to spent his evenings going out with friends that was totally fine to him. At this very moment he was not capable of admitting his heart had skipped a bit at the thought of him being important in the other man’s life.
He found him sitting outside the house, sitting on the bench at the backdoor together with Ginny and Hermione. They did not notice Harry as the three were occupied with smoking what seemed to be cigars and sharing something out of a flask, each of them shuddering with every sip. Ginny was shaking her head when he found them and after another sip continued a conversation that seemed to have started already:
“I assumed you might have questions on gay sex you felt insecure talking to you boyfriend about because you did not want to seem so inexperienced. Therefore, I am here now.”
“You know that it is impossible to have a conversation with me if you refuse to even talk to me!”
Some friendships develop just naturally. This was how hanging around with Astoria felt like for Harry. It was very easy and somehow reminded him of when things had not been weird between Ginny and him, the time before they were official. He kept wondering if that was what had ruined their friendship. When he was with Astoria, he felt more confident and from time to time even managed to be witty. In all her extravaganza she made a really good friend for Harry, who forced him out of his comfort zone.
He took a deep breath without breaking eye contact and scrapped together all the famous Gryffindor braveness he had in heart and just answered the most honest way he could:
Draco spent the rest of dinner playing with Hugo, giving Hermione quite some chance to catch up with all the others and he even seemed to rather enjoy himself until the little boy fell asleep, cuddled into his side.
“Why didn’t you two hook up? Isn’t he exactly your type?”
Maybe this girl would lead him back into life, maybe she was just another escape route young Harry Potter had to take before finding his own way, she thought to herself while they were silently sitting opposite of each other, keeping company. For her, it was her duty to stay here, rebuild the school and fill it with her very own spirit, but Harry on the other hand deserved to be free of his past even if that meant forcing him to leave – for now.
Which Harry did quite a lot, imagining his hands on the other mans body, touching the sensitive skin, licking over the pale pink nipples, scratching his teeth over the sharp hipbone.  Again, those grey eyes were prominently featured but this time his fantasies revolved around the actual Draco and not some nebulous man. He at least came imagining how it would feel like touching Draco’s cock, rubbing their errections together to create friction.
What followed next were a few of the rather worst minutes of his life. Draco did not answer. Therefore, Harry decided to do something else like cleaning up the kitchen. Which took only about ten minutes as his constant gaze on the phone told him. He started watching telly, which did not work out, he noticed as he caught himself checking his phone every minute.
“No, nothing about it is weird. It all makes sense, the apartment, your hair. I like all of it”, he mumbled in response. The moment he noticed what he had just said, the Saviour of the Wizarding World could have slapped himself. In the face. Very hard. In comparison to Draco he was so unbelievable clumsy with words. He wondered, why the other two would not make fun of him.
“Oh my, for Sirius it was hard to be out, especially in his own family. The rest of the world did not care much but his brother – how mad he was at him. You know that he always had a hard time with his family but he never even dreamt of them accepting him. This was why he only told me about his relationship with Remus back then.”
Soon, his discomfort around the blond guy got less and less and he actually managed to go as far as emitting that he was maybe staring at Cedric Diggory’s butt from time to time which only made Malfoy throw one hand into the air, melodramatically commenting “well who on earth hasn’t, I mean this arse was made to be stared at!” It was still mainly the former Slytherin talking when it came to sensitive subjects such as sexual orientation, however, they did not exclusively stick to that topic but also had lively discussions about Quidditch (Where Malfoy tended to make fun of the awful colour combinations of some teams), the current reorganization processes going on at the Ministry (Where Malfoy kept complaining about the pour choices of fabric being made when it came to redecoration) and any current rumours that did or did not directly concern them (“Honestly Potter, how could anyone assume I would even touch that creepy old guy! I am way to rich and good looking to be a gold digger!”). To make it short, they were actually getting along quite well, surely avoiding difficult topics such as their past on different sides of the war but looking at Draco Malfoy now, Harry had a hard time finding any resemblance to the scared and broken boy who suffered under Voldemort and was raised to be a part of this dark cult.
For today he is happy with how close Draco automatically shifts again when he finally asks “What exactly is Ostara?”. To his own surprise the answer is not a length long excurse into Celtic Paganism and rituals but a peck on the check followed by “You will find out when we get there. You have 15 minutes to pack before we leave. And be sure to bring something warm with you. A warming spell is not the same as cuddling into one of your disgustingly comfortable but hideous sweaters.”
They had of course stayed in contact while Harry was trying to impress the Dragon with gifts. Astoria explained to him that she would be furious if he dared to pull her into this. Also, Daphne was already fed up with her hyperenergetic sister. They had agreed to not meet in the apartment as long as Draco was angry with Harry but maybe this was over now? At least it read like that.
“You really want to send your own godchild into that snake pit?”
The next morning she broke up with him, just before breakfast. It was as simple as starting their relationship. She talked, he listened. Her reasons were logical. It was too easy. They never argued. They just were together and it was alright. But she did not feel desired.
In Molly’s simple but beautiful and practical handwriting she had addressed Draco as if they had been close friends for quite a while. As if their families had not been enemies for a long time.
They had been together for about two months when the owl had arrived. It was neatly addressed directly to Draco, not like the ones before that simply had asked Harry if he had a plus one for Christmas. Not that their relationship was a secret. They had been out from the very beginning and maybe that had helped his family to accept it very fast. Draco was willing to commit to him, it was obvious. If this commitment however included a family dinner at the Burrow was a totally different question; one Harry had not intended to ask this soon.
The next picture was taken from above and showed Draco raising one eyebrow and half-smiling into the camera, showing of his whole body from top to bottom, the free hand pulling down the towel a bit further. What followed was another text-message.
And what did she tell you to do? To dress up in my clothes and play the fucking coy guy?”
“Yes, mother told me, cousin Theodore was really found of the show. He never misses a single episode and insists on recounting them to her.”
The head of the Weasley family continued his praise for his children, congratulated Charlie on his latest dragon habitat, encouraged Billy to keep on fighting against racism in the Wizarding community, thanked Fleur for being so patient with her starry-eyed idealist and rebellious offspring. For Percy he had inspirational words concerning his new position as Defense against the Dark Arts teacher his boy just had started. When he came to George, he gratulated the newly wed man on handling both his business and a gorgeous wife, Angelina he praised for her effort in their family business.
Harry had really tried his best, preparing 7 different vegetarian snacks to be sure there would be something Draco liked. There was grilled cheese, eggplants, a mushroom Bolognese, baked cauliflower, bruschetta, sweets peppers filled with vegetables and – just to be safe – vegetable sticks with three kinds of dip. Hermione came in handy with a lot of tips on vegetarian options. So many indeed, he could not settle for one and prepared them all.
Cuddled in their Weasley sweaters they had settled in the living room and Harry once again on that day had to face one of his greatest fears: The moment when Draco and Hermione had to talk to each other for the first time after finishing school. He had imagined the situation countless times from the moment on he and Draco had become friends, fearing the awkwardness, the tension between them, the unspoken years of hatred for each other. It turned out he had misjudged the situation pretty much.
Indeed, he had a thousand plans even after being told he should not become a teacher. Opening a bookstore. Breeding owls. Starting a bakery. Becoming a healer. Working as an unspeakable. Joining Charlie in studying dragons. Qualifying for the national Quidditch League. Becoming an Auror. Restoring old magical houses. Opening a restaurant.
Never underestimate the stubbornness of a Slytherin! Most of them are gifted with a silver tongue and not afraid to extensively use it to get what they want. In this case it was Harry’s company. He still wondered how she had gotten him to come over while he was waiting in front of the apartment door, already in the building. It had taken her several more messages (if you count five as a lot, for Harry who never received texts this number obviously was) to convince him it would be a great idea to swing by. She had also ensured him Draco was absolutely fine with it.
They were fighting the sweetest most desperate fight, pulling, pushing, needing air but being uncapable of letting go. There was nothing more important than to not lose the physical contact between them. While one hand still played with the pink hair, making sure Draco had no chance to get away, the other had started to wander across the body in front of him, trying to conquer the unknown territory, feeling victorious when he finally managed to get under the shirt and touch naked skin.
Also, the shape of the glasses added to the feline structure of his face, but maybe that impression comes from Draco licking his lips hungrily whenever he looks at Harry thinking nobody is watching.
The following two weeks Harry mainly spent doing one of those three things:
They both looked at each other surprised. Then they burst out in laughter.
“Well, our first attempt at dinner didn’t go well, also, so let’s call it even?”
Backstage he was greeted by his family, a lot of shoulder pads and reassuring words and for the first time in a very long while he felt free and light hearted.
Harry turned towards the other man, starring at him in frustration.
He was brought back into reality by the other man who closed his almost rant on how people would not see how obviously gay Tanner van Burm was in his opinion. “Of course, being out there in the open changes a lot for you…”, he closed his monologue which gave Harry the perfect opportunity to change the subject onto a matter he had wanted to discuss for quite a while now.
“Bloody hell, are you expecting guest?”
When she broke it of with a laugh and turned towards Harry, the alcohol in his brain left him no other choice as to mumble “Me too.” She smiled at him softly, cupping his hips with her free hand and pushed him closer. Their kiss was short and sweet and light. He could taste the cocktail, smell the sweet odour of her sweat and perfume and feel her body having fun. This was definitely not a lover’s kiss but he liked it.
This simple message hit him harder than it should have. Indeed, he had never asked for Draco’s number. The first few weeks they always arranged a next meeting before they parted. It was only Astoria who asked for his contact. After coming over to the apartment, it was Astoria who texted him or he was invited there again. There never was a need to write to Draco.
“Hey aren’t those your button down and pants?”, he curiously asked Draco. “I mean not the one’s you are wearing right now but haven’t I seen you in a similar outfit? Immediately Draco was blushing, his gaze wandering between the telly and Harry. He sat up a bit and straightened his shirt, covering the lines of the chest tattoo up again – which was nearly as disappointing to Harry as having lost the feeling of another man’s – Draco’s – body on top of him.
“You are the only gay wizard I know who is like really out.”
Astoria seemed to be aware of the unspoken pieces of information between them of which she would not become a part of. Shaking her head, she returned her attention towards Draco and brushed her hand through his hair, careful not to bring any strand out of place.
“Andromeda, they are his family as well, he only one he has except for us and he keeps asking about them. Do you really want him to never meet them?”
Grimaud Place had never looked like this before ever. Every inch was cleaned at least twice, every cushion freshly washed, every carpet magically scrubbed, every piece of cutlery polished to perfection and every dark corner enlightened. It looked like another house. A house out of a prospect, ready for people to bring life into it and use all the carefully placed props.
“Because this”, he looked at Harry and pointed between them, “makes me crazy. You kissing me, flirting with me. Looking like this. As if you did not know what this does to me.”
"Well Potter," he said while nonchalantly pulling out the chair opposite of Harry, "I know it has been quite some time since you last had the chance to lust after me across the tables but what special occasion did I miss today that forces you back into old habits?" While still talking he let himself glide into the chair, not breaking eye contact with the former Gryffindor for just a split second.
“Well, Ginevra, luckily your training indeed paid of as ridiculous as I thought it to be in first place. You should be happy your father does not longer insist on you getting married and that I took that burden of your shoulder.”
When he arrived at the apartment about half an hour later, Draco somehow already managed to stand inside the open door, coyishly smiling at him and Harry had a hard time resisting the urge to simply kiss the other man on the spot. Instead they greeted each other awkwardly without touching. Draco looked a bit tired but nevertheless breathtakingly handsome in a simple long sleeve shirt and stylish fabric pants. His hair was loosely combed back and a few strands hung into his face. Harry had stopped asking himself how someone could look so good without any effort a long time ago.
He looked back from the lips towards the eyes and saw how soft they had become before the fluttered shut and he could feel the soft sensation of warm lips on his own, could smell the amazing fragrance, luxurious pink hair brushing over his own cheek, a nice contrast to the cold metal ring touching his own lip. There was a firmness in the touch and at the same time it felt incredibly gentle, teasing, testing. And absolutely perfect.
On the one side of the card, Malfoy had carefully written down the address of the pub, including a date and time, the other side contained his business information.
“Shit, I got to go, I almost lost track of time. Look, Potter, I am not sure if that was helpful at all…,” he started while asking the waiter for the cheque and without even thinking about it twice paying for both their drinks. Already getting up from the chair, he once again looked at Harry. Who of course was not sure how to react once again? To be fair, he had quite enjoyed the former Slytherin talking about first crushes. Harry had to admit that Malfoy was rather entertaining.
While picking him up to bring him to bed Hermione whispered just loud enough that Harry could still hear her: “And I thought you did not like children.”
“But I mean, you did not become another person, you still look the same,” he managed to say while noticing that the blond was staring at the door behind him, a horrified expression on his face.
He had to clench his jaws together in order not to scream out loudly. How could they dare to write such bullshit! Draco was absolutely right, this article was a direct attack on his reputation, taking away all the credit he had earned for his hard work so far. He did not deserve that! And all of it was Harry’s fault.
The unexpected answer was a picture of two whiskey glasses, one still containing a bit of fluid, the other one clean and empty. And maybe, just maybe this was indeed an invitation.
“Sometimes we simply fall for someone,” she finished her thought, still searching for an answer in his eyes. “Is there someone who made you reconsider your sexuality, dear? Do you have a special someone?”
“Well, having another man’s dick in your mouth or up your ass clearly is a good indicator,” Malfoy replied very calmly as this was the most normal thing to say. His face stayed still, only one eyebrow twitching ever so slightly. Again, the heat rose into Harry’s cheeks and he had to look away. How could he say that and keep a straight face as if it was the most common thing to talk about with your former enemy.
Leaning back a bit, Malfoy obviously tried to give our dear black-haired wonder boy some time to calm down once again. Taking in a deep breath Harry tried to relax a bit. There was absolutely no reason to be so warry. Malfoy was behaving way better than he had even dared to dream of. Nothing to be scared of, he told himself, we are not the ignorant children we used to be anymore.
Something inside Harry twisted in a way that made him feel really good as he realized, Draco had actually really tried to impress him with his looks. He wanted to look nice. For Harry.
“Potter, I was joking! There is nothing wrong with being a poof. I am one myself and I am proud of that!”, he explained with a very light hearted voice. The elbow remained on the table; the hand however was being moved away from the face and instead placed on the table between them. He even moved closer towards our Golden Boy and leaned towards him, lowering his voice as if they were sharing a secret between friend or planning on playing tricks on their teachers.
Instead of an answer, Harry decided to do what he was best at: Listening to his guts.
One, all of Draco’s tattoos were done in black and white. Two, there were more hiding behind the white shirt the other man refused to take of because he was not willing to “let the sun burn away my delicate skin so you terrible people can make fun of me later on. And now leave me alone in my demise!” Three, even though Draco looked rather pitiful with the white sunscreen covering his whole face and bare skin and he seemed to hate the mere thought of touching sand or salt water, which made him appear as more of a whiny baby than his usual elegance, Harry could not stop thinking about how cute he was with all that special wishes. Even unpolished and in anything else than his best shape he found the other man utterly handsome, not because of his appearance but because Draco well was Draco.
After returning to Hogwarts for his eighth year he had considered staying there even after the reparations on the castle had been done and become a professor or help Hagrid with the caretaking. It had urged him for quite a while to stay where he had felt home for the first time. But somehow his initial decision of becoming a permanent resident at Hogwarts did not make him as happy as he thought it would.
And she had been fine with it. She did not care with her other son so why should it be different with him?
Harry takes a seat, unsure whether he wants to inspect every inch of the perfectly preserved interior or study Draco’s face. It is rare his boyfriend ever brings up something connected to his family and Harry is sure this car used to belong to Lucius Malfoy, a topic they carefully avoided until now. But the look on Draco’s face tells him that right now the day is just to beautiful for such sinister thoughts and he leans back into the comfortable cushions as Astoria starts the motor.
Turning around and letting out the Gryffindor he was – always finding a solution – Harry quickly spotted a young man obviously waiting for his date, as his gaze was anxiously switching between the entrance of the restaurant and the menu, clearly terrified by the food prices. Harry waved at the waiter and calmly explained they had to leave early but it would be his pleasure if the prepaid menu would not go to waste.
“You are really willing to be part of this sappy mess even though the sheer thought of playing the perfect boyfriend to bring home for Christmas turns your stomach?”
Andromeda handed him a mug – his favourite one of course, the one with the chipped rim she originally wanted to throw away ages ago but he insisted on keeping. Of course, it was his favourite tea as well – a rather boring blend of black tea and cinnamon which always somehow reminded him of the Gryffindor common room and times where his life felt easier (even despite a maniac dark wizard trying to kill him and the world expecting wonders from a small boy).
“And now you are afraid to tell me because you don’t think I will like your choice?”
“Potter, you make me feel like a two-headed unicorn at a child’s birthday party,” the pink haired man finally managed to comment. His voice lacked a bit of the usual sharpness and if Harry had believed it was even possible, he could have sworn it sounded vulnerable. (Which obviously was true, I mean, how would you react if your best kept secret was being exposed to someone whom you just started considering being your friends a few weeks ago? But we have not arrived at that part of the story where Harry notices Draco is, in fact, a human being.)
“’Toria, what do you want from me? May I assume that there is any other reason you do not even let me spend a few single, wholesome hours a day without your constant babbling than to drive me crazy?”
Which leads us to right now where Harry was sitting at the round kitchen table in Andromeda’s house, starring at the little pile of presents he got for Draco, unsure how to proceed. And the clock was ticking. He knew on the other end of this conversation a pink-haired man was eagerly awaiting his response. Draco had reached out (if you consider a Howler reaching out) twice already after Harry had screwed up so it was definitely his time to do something, to send a meaningful gesture. If he only knew how to handle such a situation.
A few minutes later Harry would receive an answer as to where the other man currently was in the form of a selfie in front of a very expensive looking tapestry, a round glass without a stem. His left eyebrow was raised and critically and he was staring into the camera as if he tried to evoke pity while still looking fabulous.
Speaking of extravaganza: then there was Draco. Handsome, sharp tongued, flirty Draco who always seemed like he knew what to say. Who loved making Harry blush when referring to his tattoos, especially when it was about the ones covered by clothes. “If you already like this arrangement, I am sure my thighs would excite you even more”, he had explained to Harry when the dark-haired man had tried to inspect upon Draco’s arms a bit closer. When Astoria had become quite touchy the opposite had happened to her roommate. Not that he was being unfriendly or unwelcoming – more than once Draco had believably expressed how happy he was that they finally got along – but he definitely kept physical distance.
After waiting for what felt like ages, but really might have been 90 seconds Malfoy started talking again.
Well at least that was Harry’s plan. Look great, show of your place, play it cool, make it up for yesterday. He really wanted to make a great impression and he had everything planned out. What to say, what to do, how to act.
With a shake of his head he returned back to reality but not without having to think about Hermione. If he later told her about his thoughts, she would definitely smile at him knowingly and say something like “I think you have your answer”. And maybe she would be right. Maybe it was as simple as that. He wanted Draco. Not purely physically (which he did as well, there was no need to even question that, believe me) but also emotionally. He wanted intimate conversations, playful flirting, lazy days, busy days. Harry sighted without a sound. Of all people – men to be more precise – he wanted to be with this one more than he ever wanted anyone else. If only he knew how Draco felt.
“But for you, not much has changed. I mean, you do not act different now than to how you did before!”, he brought himself back into the conversation. The man sitting opposite oh him carefully raised a single eyebrow and seemed to be having a hard time finding an accurate answer. Instead he asked a question:
“You don’t have to tell me who he is but my boy, I think it would help you a lot to say it out loud, get it out of the system.”
She carefully padded his shoulder, both sitting there stiffly, unfamiliar with the intimate gesture but she saw her message had arrived as Harry nodded slowly, glimpsing to his left where Ginevra Weasley was currently chatting with Neville Longbottom.
“Technically, I do not do dates. But this is not a no. If you really – really want to do this, do it properly. Plan something. Ask me out properly. With picking up and everything. Like a real date. Then I will say yes.”
“Oh, has Draco been annoying you with his work stories, Harry?”, she asked, now ignoring Malfoy completely herself. “He can be such an attention seeker from time to time, completely unlike his roommate.”, she jokingly explained to our favourite Gryffindor. The way she kept talking and how easy it was for her to force Malfoy into complete silence impressed Harry and he instantly decided, that he could become friends with this loud girl.
“Teddy, if you like a girl you will also like kissing her,” he explained to the boy who was shaking his head wildly and sticking out his tongue. Well, maybe it would still take quite a while before Teddy would like kissing.
Astoria got up as well, grinning at the dark-haired man. She leaned a bit towards him and while fluttering her eyelashes asked something Harry would not have expected from a pureblood witch, but who was he to still make assumptions about people based on their past.
I am so sorry, holidays make me feel lazy. Also I had to catch up on so many things. But as soon as I will be back at work I promise to use every single train ride to continue writing. Until then enjoy this chapter.
like them. And you do, otherwise you would have just called the press and not shown up at our place to get advice. And I don’t get how or why it is that git and how you manage to no hate him anymore but I want you to know, I’m ok with that. Even though you screwed up big times, Harry.”
Before Harry could react in any way, Draco took a deep breath and started something like an angry apology monologue:
Draco stands directly behind him, compliments Astoria sarcastically on her sophisticated choice of wardrobe which she simply counters by offering him a matching pair of glasses, shaped in a teardrop form. Draco looks at them with distrust for a second before he puts them on. Automatically, the tint becomes several degrees lighter and turns into a soft purple fading into pink – a colour that matches Draco’s hair magnificently. He tips the edge of the frame with one finger and one side of his mouth curls into a victorious grin.
She had always been the voice of the relationship. Because she understood how to handle situations. How to handle Harry. She just knew him better than he did himself. Maybe that was the reason she knew just when to end things with him.
“Can I kiss you?”, he carefully whispered not capable of looking anywhere else than the handsome face. The dark grey eyes now filled with relief and amusement, framed with long, bright lashes, contrasting with the dark brows, the tiny freckles on the straight nose, a full, soft bottom lip, a mouth currently curled up into a feline smile, slightly higher on the right side. The smell became overwhelming and Harry noticed the hand on his hip moving towards his lower back, caressing it slowly but steadily pulling him in closer.
She did not even give him the chance to reply before extinguishing the fire but the faint traces of her smile transmitted to his face. That finally sounded like a good start.
He let go of Draco’s neck and brushed the loose stands away from the face behind the ear, caressing his cheek with his palm for a moment.  From there on his hand moved along the sides of the other man’s torso, feeling the bones and muscles under the soft fabric. As well as a sweet shuddering under his breath. More, more, more! He wanted so much more of this. How on earth could he ever do anything else again that did not imply touching Draco.
Some part of him desperately wished Draco would one day casually swing by to tell him how he spent lazy Sunday afternoons playing in the garden and the big rooms on the top floor. Stories of how a little, mischievous boys once wandered through these halls and played tricks on his family. But somehow Harry knew, this would never happen. When Draco was born this house had already had it’s fair share of history and the resistance used to live here.
I decided to try publishing a bit differently and will now upload smaller bits of the chapters but more frequently (at least  hope so)
Actually, he was, he noticed while he once more pushed Teddy who was sitting on his swing, his favourite thing to do outside right now. Harry’s action resulted in a very happy squeak coming from the little boy with the purple hair. It would be foolish to assume Teddy always wore his hair in that colour but as he insisted on attending a muggle school before going to Hogwarts, Andromeda had taught him a spell to glamour his hair into a specific colour. This enchantment made sure Teddy’s hair stayed the same during the day. As his grandmother strongly believed in the power of free will and making own choices, Teddy was allowed to decide which colour his glamoured hair should have. He went with purple (after all, he IS Tonks’s son, so what else did you expect?).
This was the moment Draco forced himself to look up again and give Harry a smile so soft and sad his heart almost immediately broke.
“Harry, good to see you. Come on in. Leave your jacket, shoes and glamours at the door!” With that words she gestured him to come inside and closed the door behind herself. Without waiting for him to take of his shoes she already went back inside the apartment which gave Harry the chance to take a look around. The hall was bright and the only thing in there were five cloak hooks, for of them currently empty. It did not seem as if Draco actually was at home. Harry did not like that thought at all. Still, he put his shoes on the shelf below the hooks and hung his old jacket next to Astoria’s which seemed to be a rather formal blazer with glittering pinstripes. He carefully made his way further into the apartment. After only a few steps he felt the tingling sensation of magic.
There suddenly was this ice cold, hard thing in Harry’s stomach, making him realize this was actually not only not going well but a complete disaster. He nodded silently, looking down to his feet, unsure what else to say.
This is only the first part of the chapter but I did not want you guys to have to wait forever. I am very busily working on this chapter as well as a very fluffy Christmas special, therefore I can only present you the first part of chapter 4 but I will do my best to finish the second part before Christmas ;)
Astoria and Daphne were both enjoying the sun shining on their oily legs, wearing giant sunglasses and sipping from exotic drinks. Both of them were wearing swim suits so fancy they for sure were designer. Astoria had stuck to a rather cute design with a lot of flowers at the bottom and frill on top whereas her sister’s bikini was more on the practical side, a deep blue triangle top and a rather sporty bottom. The colour contrasted nicely with her bright hair and rather light skin as well as her right arm. It was the first time Harry had ever gotten the chance to look at her Tattoos. There were several, a stylized sunrise in a cameo, a flower next to it, a tiny rat holding a red suitcase on the back of her upper arm and of course her Dark Mark with a neat arrangement of red circular forms in the background.
Harry put away the newspaper wondering as well. One could read this as a sign or was he delusional? A few moments he got the answer in form of a text message.
“What’cha looking for?”
Harry somehow felt as if there was more behind the delayed response than showering even though the thought of a very naked Draco made his cheeks flush quite a lot.
He looked like the advertisement of a man you would love to introduce to your parents as well as pull into a dark corner and snog senseless at the same time and for the first time in his life he could understand why for some people their clothes were their armour. He felt strong and confident, knowing he was looking his best.
By the look in her face he knew, he almost got her. He had to play his cards well now.
And then something clicked. Draco started moving his lips, a curious tongue playfully asking for entrance into his mouth to ravish it only seconds later. There were hands all over his body, searching, needing him. The touch on his back had turned into a strong grip, holding him securely while a long leg was pushing him backwards against a wall. The kiss grew from innocence into quite the opposite and Harry heard himself moan loudly when he could feel Draco pressing hard against his hips, clearly wanting this as much he did.
Still, telling her scared her maybe the most. Maybe even more than telling Ginny.
Life definitely had changed for all of them after the Great War. They had all changed. Especially Hermione – well in certain ways. Opposite of him the woman who was considered to be the brightest witch of her generation and once had nothing else in her mind than studying and surpassing her own goals was currently sitting on the floor and trying to convince a one year old that is was alright to pass her the toy broccoli. She failed miserably. Patting baby Hugo on his head she returned her attention towards Harry.
“Well, as far as I know your experience with men only goes as far as kissing a random bloke and snogging me to get rid of another one. Therefore, I assume you are experimenting in a safe space right now. You were also kissing Astoria so who should know. In addition, you were a bit intoxicated in those situations. Alcohol makes us do things our sober mind would protect us from.”
“Am I right to believe Potter that I am the only gay person you know?”
Harry smiled to himself. It needed someone like Draco Malfoy to wear bright pink hair and look sociable. It actually suited him well. He seemed more natural, not as if he was holding back anything anymore. Harry wondered if it had been the fact, that Draco was glamoured all the time that had given the impression of slight discomfort.
“We should get the pizza then”, he simply said, feeling a certain rush of adrenaline as well as confidence streaming through his veins while he tilted his head a bit forward, almost touching Draco’s collarbone with his lips while still pulling the other man closer with his left hand securely wrapped around the waistband of the sweatpants, careful not to touch the skin below. “If you insist on the chronological order.”
With a raised eyebrow Draco sat in the chair next to him.
Could not breath.
“Would it be so bad for her if you actually were involved with me?”
She returned the smile and handed him her empty mug. Still, both went into the direction of the kitchen and he could hear her tell him about the book on Scottish magic through the centuries she was currently reading and his promise to lend her one of the diaries the Malfoy family had treasured over the centuries that was featuring the stories of a young witch exploring potions together with Shakespeare himself.
Everything was as it should be.
surrounded by a very classy flower background. A smirk stole itself onto Harry’s face as he unfolded the sheet of paper, carefully trying not to break the seal. One could say this way of messaging was pretentious but it was so Malfoy-style he found it kind of adorable.
Being new to idea of being into blokes was one thing. Confronting yourself with the question of what would possibly be considered attractive about you quite another.
But for now, he had to deal with another very special spouse of the Black family who demanded his full attention while roaming through his grandmother’s drawers in order to locate the perfect piece of fabric. Harry wondered – not for the first time – if this attention seeking thing was a character trait which ran in the family.
The result of his painting by the way was definitely not a photorealistic drawing (we are talking about a five-year-old boy in love!) but a really cute picture of stick man Teddy holding hands with a fairy. She was a bit taller than him as “she is a grown-up Harry and I like large girls; they can reach the top shelf with the candy!” Her hair was very long and ended in something that resembled snake heads. Teddy loved snakes. The outfit was very colourful as she was wearing bright orange tights, a pink fluffy skirt and a blue top which showed her navel. Teddy was very proud of his work and Harry indeed wondered if Astoria would wear this outfit.
“You are definitely dressed better than my sister,” she casually explained while clearly meaning it as half a compliment for him, half an insult on her. Still, she smiled when she looked at him and gave him a silent thumbs up when Astoria dramatically slide towards the door and gave away a theatrical “Ohhhhhh”. But to be honest, her outfit was more of a surprise than his own. He could not stop himself from grinning when he saw her.
He moved his face in front of Draco’s to press a sweet little kiss on the already swollen lips before whispering in the other man’s ear: “We can take it as slow as you want to, Draco, but there is one thing you have to accept. I do not only want to date you, Draco bloody Malfoy, I want nothing more than officially be your boyfriend.”
Somehow the boys need to get to know each other. I heard that talking might help!
Sitting in the soft afternoon light that hit the armchair just right, a steaming hot cup of tea in his two hands and a squeaking toddler at his feet playing with miniature versions of cooking supply already helped a lot. The world had not suddenly started spinning around him feeling more or less attractive or being unsure about his looks. Since the Triwizarding Ball back in grade four had he not waisted this amount of thoughts on his looks. I mean, how could he? A war had happened after that year. There certainly were other things on Harry’s mind back then.
“Picture time”, she announced and put an arm around Harry. Daphne stepped closer as well, grinning into the camera. Draco shook his head but did not refused even though he stayed in the background. Harry had always wondered why all three of them were so obsessed with taking pictures but then he remembered the end of his first year in Hogwarts when Hagrid had given him the photo album and how much he had treasured it, still holding it high up until today. Sometime pictures help making a moment last a bit.
“This comes as a surprise after all – after all that history you share. All you did, he did – all the war. But I am certain there is a reason why you feel like you feel today. I mean people can change. And if I can believe my sister can overcome her darkness and be a part of my family again then of course her son, who had been nothing but a child during war, can become a man worthy of being loved by you.”
Harry had always known that Draco Malfoy knew his way around fashion and today was the living prove for that. The pink haired man was dressed in a black button-down shirt that had a round neck closing directly below his Adam’s apple. Over that he wore a short, rather casual waistcoat. All of that would have been bearable had it not been for those skin tight black pants that hugged ever inch of Draco’s lower body and left very little to the imagination and ended in very elegant boots. Together with the loose bun he looked like the perfect mixture between an old school dandy and a modern rebel. The sleeves were rolled up unto the elbows, showing of the tattoo covered arms which Harry still felt the desire to inspect more closely.
Ron looked at him and could not help but grin.
“You know, there had been several studies – Muggle as well as Wizarding – on what makes people attractive in general. I never considered you were interested in that kind of research,” she carefully mentioned, blowing some lose strands of her bushy hair out of her eyes. Pregnancy, Harry had to admit, had made Hermione prettier than she had ever been. She had gained a few pounds which she never had tried to get rid of again and it suited her very well. Her face had lost the sharp edges and her general expression had gotten much softer in the year Hugo was already part of their little family.
His assumption became even more clear as the waiter arrived with their first dish – a combination of fried mussels and fine meats. Draco’s face immediately turned at least one shade paler (and yes this was possible) and he seemed to be rather disgusted by the sight and prospect of eating that. Maybe it was because he was not into sharing food? Some people had a problem with eating from the same platter.
“So, Harry, you and Draco are friends now?”
Felt his heart stop.
“Well Potter, I do tend to cause this reaction in men. Look at me, who would not want to share their bed with me. So, is this your reason to ask me such a question?”, the blond man responded with a witty tone in his voice. It had taken Malfoy quite a while to regain his cool and laid-back mannerisms. Now he was leaning back in his chair, casually stretching his long legs a bit and looking at poor Harry with one eyebrow slightly raised, twitching in amusement while a smug half smile was playing around his lips.
“Well, I got here by apparating, if you wanted to know that specific thing. I also was surprised I came first and that you did not consider picking me up and maybe walking here together. Anything else you want to know about my rather boring arrival and way here?”
He is uncertain what to expect as the CD is clearly a mix put together by any of the three but the dot above the I being transformed into a flower dates towards Astoria who seems to be as exited about the music choice as her sister. Meanwhile Draco watches them through the back mirror, one eyebrow raised.
Sleeping in the warm Asian sun indeed was a wonderful cure for hangovers he had noticed a few hours later when they had made their way back to way to cold and nippy London. Harry was still kind of confused on what time it actually was as they had ported to the beach at around 4 am and spend a whole day there even if it still was bright day when they came back to England. All this ‘seven hours ahead’ and back math thing hurt his head right now. They had spent about eight hours in total at the beach, having lunch, sleeping, swimming and three of them enjoying the warm sun so when they came back it was only noon at home.
Draco’s hand was covered in sauce and he had a hard time not staining himself while cleaning it and at the same time excusing himself for the wasted food.
liking.
The final stage of the plan was of course Malfoy's big entry. Dressed in a form fitting three-piece suit he attended his family's traditional Beltane celebrations not only by himself but also making a point nobody could overlook. It was a number of rather subtle changes that left a deep impression.
“Wait, did you text Parkinson before when you were pretending to watch the movie?”
After school, everyone seemed to be so eager to start their lives. Their real lives. They all seemed to have a plan. All except for Harry, the Boy There Had Always Been A Plan For. When asked what he wanted to do with his life now that he was finally free, he just grinned knowingly and people somehow assumed he thought they were joking. That is was obvious.
Believe me it would not be an exaggeration if I told you Harry was ready to go and grabbing his keys only a minute after receiving this message. Finally!
‘As if you did not know what this does to me!’
An early update today as I will be busy until tomorrow
Instead of insulting him for the suspicion of lying to him Draco had chosen to simply proof his point by sending a picture of himself. Obviously coming out of the shower. His skin and hair still wet from the water. His chest naked. Him wearing nothing else but a towel around his waist, or at least one could guess so. And Harry was lost.
“But tell me, Harry, why did you decide to tell me now?”
“No! But we could hold hands. But only once! What else did she write?”
The universe decided to give him a more than unusual chance to do so the next weekend. When you think about our favourite Slytherin on the beach, curing his hangover in luxurious loungers, drinking fresh fruit juices and from time to time cool down in the ocean you are not wrong. This was exactly what the group of four was doing after a rather extravagant night of partying, knowing they somehow had to get fit until the very same night to attend the annual birthday party of their favourite club.
Even though it did not feel like that.
Maybe the time to hide really was over for both of them.
From that very evening on Harry became a constant member of the party and was normally not even invited to join them as they all would simply assume he was coming with them anyways. He had been afraid that things between him and Draco might have become weird after the kiss but no such thing did happen. Harry refrained from doing so again and Draco was his usual flirty self towards him, always making sure, he still had something to drink and was feeling alright.
“And a reminder for you who I was and that we share a history none of us could ever forget!”
“Harry darling,” she started, settling close to him, “you can tell me anything you need to, don’t worry. It will be alright.”
Again, he could have hit himself on the head very hard for this stupid message. Why would someone be lying about taking a shower. The response however made him reconsider his ability in texting.
“What do you mean by copying? What exactly?
“Well, it slowly but certainly it becoming winter.”
The sky above them is bright and when Harry looks back, he can see the soft orange tones of a beautiful sunset. Right now everything is just fine. And he is really looking forward for things to come!
It was bright red, gigantic and unmistakably something he had not seen in ages. A very pretty eagle owl had managed to get into Grimmauld place and had dropped a very intimidating looking letter in front of him. It was nothing else but a Howler.
He never felt uncomfortable with her. But he also never felt uncomfortable without her. When she was gone, he sure was wondering what she was up to but it was never her he missed, it was solemnly the company.
Draco gave him a very short crooked smile and Harry noticed how well placed the piercing actually was, moving just the lightest bit to enforce the expression. All of the piercings and the extravagant hair colour really made Draco look more approachable. And handsome. Which Harry only noticed because he was still figuring out if he was gay and automatically checked out every guy. Not that Draco was his type. Definitely not, he did not even have a type! And even if it could never be someone who stood out from any crowd so much!
With a surprised expression Draco left the kitchen, not saying a word and Harry immediately regretted being emotional about such a tiny matter. He focused back on the vegetables, slowly simmering in the pan in front of him. Therefore, it took him a moment to notice Draco had returned shortly after, this time without his coat. Instead, he was holding two fancy looking glasses in his hands, both filled with a liquid that was translucent at the top, slowly turning into bright red at the bottom of the glass. A single, deep red cherry was placed at the edge of it.
Draco starred at the burning cigarette as if he had only noticed what he was doing just now before once again inhaling the smoke slowly, making sure none of it would hit Harry. Then he pulled his eyebrows together and starred into the sky absently.
He left the stage without waiting for the questions to come for he had already planned to do an interview with Luna on the topics of partners and so on. That was something he would want someone he trusted to talk about, not a reporter who simply wanted the most scandalous version of the story.
But still, somehow today it was he himself who got plenty of attention from other men in the club. Two guys had already sent some shots into his direction, the guy across the room was winking at him whenever their gazes met and another man a few years older was currently approaching him, a sincere look in his eyes. He stopped way too close in front of Harry to be comfortable and forced him to step back, away from the dance floor. The other guy was obviously a bit more drunk than himself and had quite obvious intentions.
Harry could feel the heat raising in his cheeks. Somehow, he loved the idea of him and Draco being a strong power couple out there for the world and having a secret together at home. He liked the idea of spending lazy days with the other man as well as his company would make official dates bearable or even enjoyable. He liked the idea of having more than a friendship with Draco. By Merlin, he could almost hear his snarking comments to the press, the slightly arrogant but witty comments as well as he could feel his hand in his hair, strong fingers touching, him gripping him…
She opened the one eye that was not currently covered by her own hand and looked at Harry. In that moment he wondered where his phone was. Looking around the room he spotted it carefully plugged in next to the telly. It took him ages to get up from the couch and to his device even though it were merely a few feet. However, this had felt like the hardest thing ever. As soon as he managed to crawl back to the couch, Astoria grabbed the phone and searched for a pizza delivery service. She did not even bother to ask what he wanted, but simply ordered what looked like a ton of food.
Opening it Harry was greeted by a happily grinning young woman clearly dressed in what she thought was “driving attire”. As we are still talking about Astoria who has a bit of a different understanding of fashion and appropriateness, her attire of course consists of deep red gloves, leopard-print sunglasses, a giant white hat and a white thin scarf. She resembles one of those vintage commercials Harry has been gifting Arthur Weasley whenever he cannot come up with a proper present.
Harry was well aware that this might had come out of nowhere. However, this had been the chance he so desperately had been looking for since the breakup. He didn't know many openly gay people - actually only Charlie Weasley and he was obliviously not a suitable choice to discuss such a delicate matter. Not after the breakup. The Weasleys were his family but still...as long as he was not sure whether Ginny's suspicion contained the smallest notch of truth, he didn't want them to know.
I was for a long time. I still am from time to time because this all feels very new to me. But I am certain now that I am fed up with hiding. I am not ashamed for who I am and I had enough of people assuming something about me therefore I decided to come here today to tell you the truth about me.
Biting his lower lip Harry once again looked down at the table, uncapable of reacting to the other man. A theatrical moan came from the blond man. Harry noticed the sound of parchment taken out of a bag. Pale hands with carefully manicured fingernails put something in front of him which looked a lot like a formal agreement he knew from work.
at least it is really adorable
“You look different …,” the dark-haired mess with words commented on the obvious. Harry had never been great at expressing himself but that was a low, even for him. Draco still reacted, brushing back some loose hair behind the left ear. With that he exposed the earrings. It were in fact four tiny silver rings and a larger black tunnel. With a bit of surprise, Harry noticed he could actually look through the hole. “…but not in like a bad way”, he desperately tried to finish his sentence on a more positive and not so darn obvious note.
With a sort of bow, waving his hand as if he were an artist waiting for applause, the blond man fully got up and looked Harry death in the eyes.
He simply nodded.
Luckily, he had prepared himself for this moment of speechless fear by writing down what he was going to say word by word and again with the help of not only Hermione but also Andromeda (Luna he could not ask because that would have been unfair to other magazines). He reached for the sheet of paper in front of him and began reading, paying no attention to the people starring at him.
And the clients. Well, they could be difficult to put it nicely. Those who were never officially connected to Dark Magic tried their best to hide cursed artefacts and such things to make sure nobody got the wrong impression. Those who had followed the Dark Lord were not keen on Aurors entering what bit was left of their privacy and therefore not really cooperative.
Therefore, he joins the singing girls and it takes only a short time until all for of them sing. Draco’s voice is different to what he had expected. He does not hit all the notes and he is not as loud as the others but he obvious enjoys himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
All over sudden Harry had to sit up immediately. ‘Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap!’ What by Merlin and Salazar had he done? He knew very little about being friends with a gay man but running around and kissing them without their permission was certainly something you should not do. His first instinct was to grab his glasses as soon as he found them and run home as long as everybody was still asleep. But where were those darn things anyways?
When his curious fingers reached for the seam of Draco’s – his – pants, he surprisingly was stopped by long fingers. Breaking away from the kiss he looked at Draco in surprise.
Well why would one make rules if they did not leave room for exceptions. If I will be every willing to date someone again I for sure will let this person know personally.
Harry really tried hard to focus on the words instead of the sensation of having another man being so close to him. He could feel Draco’s breath on his skin, tingling all the way down to his spine. It was an irritation, odd and new sensation. Even in the crowded room he could smell the faint remains of his perfume. It was light and herbal with a distinctive sweetness to it. ‘How strange’, he thought, ‘I always assumed Malfoy would smell like citrus.’
He almost did not manage to find words at all, he was to preoccupied with the hands still touching his, fingers caressing the sensitive skin. Then Draco leant in closer, their heads only a few inches apart.
Harry wordlessly pointed the way to the kitchen where his over-eagerness was on display, already knowing it were only mere seconds before he would make a fool of himself the second day in a row.
“Potter”, Draco started a sentence which already sounded so wrong. Harry’s heart stopped racing in his chest for a second. An icy lump formed in his stomach. This was not good; this definitely was not good.
“Astoria, Astoria Greengrass, in case you can’t remember,” she added with a witty wink. Harry shook her hand, still a bit confused if he was obligated to introduce himself now even though she obviously already knew who he was. She did not seem to mind him being quiet at all, as she simply continued talking.
“Well, we can for sure change my order. I do not see the problem here.”
“Well, why did you not do it then for the last few weeks? Because I stayed on your couch? Is it really that important to you what I think about you?”
Maybe this is why those little gestures tend to mean the world to Harry whenever they happen.
“But I don’t ask you to. Can’t we for one moment stop thinking about what will happen in the future and live now? I mean there is something between you and me!”
Harry had to listen to the message twice as Draco’s voice definitely sounded like the wine glasses were working and he maybe had one to many. Which maybe was quite a lot as far as he could judge the other man’s ability to hold his liquor. A lot of questions still arose and Harry decided it would be best to just simply ask all of them.
It took me a while to figure out what to say but as I tend to not find the right words, I decided to make it as quick as possible: I, Harry Potter, am gay and I am not ashamed of it. I think we live in a society where we have overcome judging people by differences and started accepting them for who they are. So, this is me, the man I have always been. And I am not hiding anything anymore. Thank you.”
“So, you do not think I have changed at all?”
“I think that creepy dude is gone.”
And he was overthinking it again instead of just simply writing.
On any other occasion there would have been nothing else on Harry’s mind than to slide his fingers under the beautiful fabric, touching the exclusive skin in that forbidden area right where the pair of trousers loosely clung to the hipbones. Oh, he loved that sensitive part of Draco’s body. But this was definitely not the time to think about ravishing your boyfriend. Not as long as the latter was in the kitchen joking with Molly Weasley while helping her prepare the legendary Weasley Christmas Punch.
In the first place he had not even intended on asking Draco to accompany him. This between them was brand new and it would have felt strange to force his boyfriend into spending Christmas with his family when the term “boyfriend” still felt kind of weird whenever he thought about it. Weird, but in a good way, like a new sensation, similar to the nervous tingle he still got whenever he was kissing Draco or when they were making out. There was something oddly pleasing about knowing he was allowed to call the other man something he had never been before. Draco Malfoy was not only his first boyfriend; this was also true the other way around. Something which made Harry grin like a mad man whenever he thought about it.
While sliding over the business card which now contained an address, Malfoy got up from his seat and attempted to leave Harry alone. Our favourite Gryffindor was almost tempted to think of this meeting as surprisingly pleasant had the blond man not turned around at the last moment to loudly and announced: “Oh, and you pay! However, you shall not confuse this meeting with a date or any similar activity of such kind! What would the people think of my loss of taste! See you, Scarhead!”
“So now that you have heard all about my magical hair story, is it still weird to you?”, Draco asked with a half-smile on his lips once again and Harry could not stop wondering how anyone could be fooled by a Glamour if he looked way more natural like this.
And both had Teddy in their lives.
When Harry first fell for Draco, he was sure this was it, the absolute maximum of how much you could feel for another person. So much longing, desire, needing to be close. But boy, was he wrong.
He luckily lost that thought a moment later when two witches crossed their path, greeting Draco by calling him his first name and politely addressing himself as “Mr. Potter” before moving on. Draco once again gave him his characteristic one-sided smile.
All of them did so well. They sometimes talked about the war, with him, about him. Asked for his advice. But they became fewer quickly. And one day he even heard someone whisper that they should not ask him for help because he had done enough already.
“But not like you do with Draco. You should see yourself. Your eyes get dreamy and you grin like a moron.”
When she loosened her grip on him and he opened his eyes once again, he noticed the guy from before was not gone as he assumed but still dancing closely, this time giving Harry his full attention. It might have been the adrenaline rush but our favorite Gryffindor felt as courageous as any member of his house ever did and let go of Astoria’s hand to turn towards the other man and dance. The blond guy grinned as Harry approached him, but instead of dancing, he gripped the front of the orange shirt and pulled him closer.
“Well, you can imagine Mother’s reaction to the article. She was quite upset and had a lot of questions concerning my private life therefor I thought it best if I simply went straight to her and explained the whole situation.”
Turning around in the mirror his next sceptical thoughts concerned his buttocks. Those old jeans he kept wearing all the time, did they do anything for his behind? Was there anything worth doing something for? What kind of butt did other man consider attractive anyway?
Again, the man sitting opposite of him changed his position, now leaning on the table with both his elbows. The frown on his forehead had increased and now he definitely seemed to be rather confused than amused or in the mood to make some jokes. This could be the first glimpse Harry could ever have at the Draco Malfoy that stood in for something. The young wizard who refused to be treated differently because of his sexuality. The man who stood up and fought for something. Someone from whom Harry maybe could learn something.
“Well you see,” she began, taking a seat next to him but looking in the distance, “there is not only black and white out there. Sometimes you cannot be sure if you are only one thing or the other or if you are attracted to only one gender or –“ She moved her gaze towards him, facing him directly now and he knew he had to keep eye contact as she was searching for an answer in his look.
Molly Weasley on the other hand had definitely planned to do so. Her letter was more of an invitation card. Nothing alike the ones Harry had seen on Draco’s bedroom wall. Actually, the former Slytherin tended to have a bit of a nostalgic spleen as he was saving each and every invitation he went to. They were all pinned on top of each other above Draco’s desk. The ones he did not care to attend usually landed directly in the trash bin.
As every year the next guest could not actually be there that evening but still Arthur raised his glass to honor Fred, a hero of a righteous war and Harry noticed just how much Draco wanted to leave the room in this moment but he stayed. Taking in a deep breath Arthur turned to Ron, telling his boy how proud he was to have an actual Auror in his family. Then it was Hermione’s turn.
“I know you like this whole idea of snogging me senseless in hidden corners, kissing me in secret and exploring a male body for the first time without having to fear anyone will know but I cannot do this.”
Harry did not have it in his heart to tell he, he was typing as fast as he could right now while Teddy was sitting on his lap and helping him to sound ‘cooler’. He in fact had to admit that the boy was better in that small talk thing than himself. Still, Harry was not willing to ask Astoria what her favourite dinosaur was or what was her favourite toy. Especially the last one could sound wrong. Very wrong. Not that Teddy cared.
Although Harry had already suggested Draco was not unfamiliar to hooking up with guys, the actual notion of the pink haired man doing so still was uncomfortable for him. Really trying not to sigh audibly he turned his attention away from the pale mass of limbs and sunscreen and focused on the two girls. Friends talked about their friend’s sex life. This was totally normal and as far as it concerned Draco and him, they were no more than friends.
“I heard what you did first this morning when I got into the department to fill in my paperwork. All of the Aurors were talking about Malfoy and how it could be possible the filthy Death Eater had managed to dig his claws into your flesh. Sounds like a secret investigation is planned. They want to blow his private life up completely to assure he has not cursed you into anything,” he explained while he carelessly managed to keep Rosie occupied.
Had it not been for the slightly amused tone in the other man’s voice, Harry might have wondered if Draco was indeed complaining. What he actually wondered was if this whole situation would have been less tense if he actually had picked up Draco and they had walked here together. Well, at least the other man would not have to wait for his arrival all by himself. He definitely was not good at this dating thing at all.
Spending time with children had always been something Harry loved doing. It was easier to interact with them than with adults. Children tended to say what they actually meant and did not conceal their feelings in order to protect you. As far as it concerned Harry, it had never been a good idea to do something to protect him. Usually this resulted in people getting into big danger or even dying. He hated being protected. He was not broken. Not special.
It was as if the flat was trying to slide any enchantment off of him. Was this what Astoria had meant by leaving glamours outside? He began to wonder if she was wearing any. Stepping around the corner he found himself in a very large room with bright white walls. It featured an elegant and modern dining table with four chairs as well as a couch and to his big surprise a telly. To be specific a brand-new flat screen which had been placed on a small sideboard. While the room itself was very bright, featuring huge window fronts to two sides, the furniture was held in dark earthy tones. Here and there a tiny bit of decoration was added such as a small plant on the coffee table or a few photographs on the wall behind the telly.
Did anyone guess which TV show I am talking about?
“When you say for the first time, do you mean-?”
His fingers traced along the black and silver he had also gotten. It’s simple but intricate design had reminded him of Draco quite a lot. Maybe this was the right idea. He searched for a clean piece of parchment and wrote what got into his mind.
“Astoria, if I enter the living room to find you snogging another random bloke on my favourite couch without warning me first, I am going to kill you with a plastic spoon!”, Draco explained calmly while coming around the corner.
You can of course imagine how hurt he had felt the couple of days after this conversation but in the aftermath, Harry registered it had been a very wise move of his former teacher. All by himself he would have never left Hogwarts and with that his past.
“Charlie, thank you for the offer but I really don’t want to talk about this today!”
But something inside Harry knew it was just his desire to keep things easy and the blurring of memories that told him everything would be so much better with Ginny around once again. The bittersweet tugging in his heart was the one of longing for a memory not a possibility. He even felt ashamed noticing how little this feeling revolved around Ginny herself but centred on having a part of his family around him. Maybe Ron was right and he would have dated any Weasley – just to be with them.
Taking another deep breath, Harry carefully knocked at the door, still feeling like he was about to do something very intimate. ‘Don’t be silly’, he told himself, ‘people visit each other all the time! Also, I was definitely invited!’ The door opened and Astoria’s smiling face greeted him, she was obviously glad to see him. For a brief moment Harry thought that she looked different to when he last met her. He could have sworn, there was something glittering in her face once again.
I am sorry for the long delay! I am forced to work from home and somehow I totally got used to writing solemly when I was taking a train. And secondly, I share my office with two attention loving bunnies. Try to resist them, I dare you
“So, do you want to, like, haveadatetonight?”
Boom. Harry’s heart fell into his knees, leaving a terrible dark wound. This was not what he had expected to hear. He knew he did not well but…this sounded wrong.
Also, Harry was not really attractive in any kind of way. His face was boring, his eyes were of a solid green colour, the hair a giant mess, lips always chapped no matter what he did to them. And then there was the lightning bolt scar on his forehead which had become even more visible now that he had sort of a tan. His skin colour also was nothing to be exited about. Even though he was not that ashy anymore, his skin did not have this luxurious bronze undertone to it he would have loved to have. His upper body was not that muscular or anything despite all training efforts, his knees still looked weird and his legs were quite hairy. He was not sure if a gay man was suspected to trim his hair. He was really not that special. Not like that beautiful Clive guy.
Texting with Draco turned out to be different to what Harry had expected. And on the same side it was absolutely like he had imagined. It was a lot about teasing, taunting but never directly addressing something. It felt like a dance whose move set he still had to learn but he could enjoy it from the very beginning.
“Sorry,” he mumbled just loud enough to be understandable, “but this one is with me.” His tone was very calm and an amused grin was playing around his lips while he quickly raised his eyebrows, looking at Harry. Merlin, Draco was obviously marking his territory and Harry could feel his own Heart in his stomach. Even if this was only to help him get rid off the other guy, he enjoyed it so much. Somehow the other man still did not get it.
Draco looked him straight in the eyes with what could only be described as a smug smile and leaned a bit towards him. Even though they were still a few feet apart Harry could feel the heat rushing into his cheeks. He suddenly realized that the other man was quite a few centimetres taller than himself, looking down at him with a lot more confidence than Harry had ever owned himself. He looked so poised and at peace with himself.
With a loud breath out Draco sat up and put away his phone, looking at Harry expectantly.
Again, no response.
Shaking his head Harry tried to get rid of that thought. He would neither cut his hair nor change his height, that would be to drastic. Pressing his lips together he instead focused on his torso, lifting his shirt a bit to reveal his stomach. By no means could he be considered fat or overweight. The skin stretched over flat muscles and showed of his defined abdomen. He could be confident about that if it were nor for the sheer lack of any signs of a six pack. He could work on that.
Draco’s hand slightly brushed over the old wooden cabinets and he carefully turned around in the kitchen a few times, as if he was sucking in the details of it. Suddenly, Harry noticed he had not put away his collection of small trinkets from times with his friends, such as the photographs on the fridge. And yes, he had a fridge in his kitchen because Molly Weasley had told him so. Something about magically preserved food always tasting a bit odd (which was not the point. The point was when Molly told you how to do something in your kitchen, she definitely had good reasons and would not stop nagging you until you gave in. Therefore, he had bought a fridge even before he had really moved in). On the wall next to it several paintings gifted from Teddy were displayed as well as the scarf Ron had bought them at the last Quidditch World Tournament or the tickets of the Wyrd Witches show he and Luna went to last year. He was insecure of how Draco who obviously refused to store such sentiments at his apartment would react but all he got was a short nod before the other man moved on exploring his surroundings.
“Thank you for the kind offer but I will have to decline. Maybe you forgot about this or did not know but I indeed do not eat any dead animals at all. I am sorry for the inconvenience.”
She gave away a deep sigh. Lowered her finger as well as her shoulders in defeat. Her left eyebrow was still twitching when she turned on her heel and stomped away, mumbling more towards herself than him: “Fine, but I will go with him – just in case!”
They often went to take out places and had their dinner at the apartment but sometimes Astoria more felt like “fancy food” as she declared and they went to a muggle restaurant in walkable distance. As their place was located in Soho, they had plenty of choice. And they always seemed searching for just the next weird dish to try. Astoria had been joking about that quite some times, referring to Draco as “easily bored, always looking for the next adventure” which had led to the pink-haired not talking to her for the rest o the evening and Harry wondering if that was true for his sexual partners as well.
This already was awkward! A thought he would have coming up quite a lot throughout the whole evening.
Since his coming out, the world did not change for Draco Malfoy. He was still the same, dressed the same, had the same job and friends. He just simply dated man. And that was exactly what Harry wanted for himself. Enough things had chance in his young life. He had lost what he would call a family not only once. He had been special long enough. If Ginny was in fact right and he was gay, he didn't want it to be special. He wanted to be normal. And as strange as this might sound, Draco Malfoy managed to stay normal.
After hearing this speech Harry felt the moisture in his eyes like every year. But something still was different this time. Instead of the nagging question in the back of his head that kept him wondering if he would still talk about Ginny with so many loving emotions after all those years together he felt a warmth in his guts while imagining how it would feel one day to look back at thirty years together with Draco.
They are not going away using any magical form of transportation it seems as Daphne is already seated on the passenger seat of a mint green to grey convertible old timer which by the looks of it costs more than most people earn in a year or two. For a moment, Harry admires the beautiful form of the car. He has always had a thing for old cars but never really considered buying one for himself – I mean he has magic, why bother driving.
