He couldn't help but smile.
So began a rather mad, spontaneous, absurd, and impossible new year.
"You could say that again." Astoria, like Draco, wasn't used to being around children looped up on sugar. She watched from afar instead of getting into the fray. That was excitement enough for her. She looked over at Harry. "Alright, Harry?"
"Oh? What's the wrong impression?"
Ginny pursed her lips dramatically and leaned in close to glare at Harry. "Who is she, Harry James Potter?" She kept leaning in until her nose was squished against his and they were both cross-eyed. "You have a lot of nerve. A
"I think if they got to know you, they would like you too. I like you. Mum likes you. Because you're a good person. That's that."
... and licked the sweet syrup off the spoon as he was brought back to the present. He tried to listen to the last of Hermione's rant.
"I'm sorry to sound insensitive, Harry," Hermione said. "But you need to take into account the reactions you'll be getting from people who aren't as forgiving as your friends. Like your work, for instance. Have you thought of that?"
Scorpius didn't fancy crowds. The photographs were packed with people. This was definitely a different kind of family, something Scorpius wasn't used to. They were fun to look at. So many redheads. He had never seen this many people with orange hair before in his life, only in picture books. And he liked the way Teddy talked about them, with so much exclamations. Scorpius had never talked with anyone Teddy's age before. In fact, the only people he interacted with were children his own age and adults his father's age.
"I wouldn't put it that way." Draco dropped his gaze, playing with the spoon on the table. "It's been bizarre. Brings back a lot of..." He shook his head as he trailed off.
"I panicked."
"I want some too," Scorpius demanded as they stomped back up the stairs.
"What's that supposed to mean?" Harry frowned at her as she left the hospital room to get back to the work she had abandoned in her hurry. Ron scurried after her.
As much as it pained him to admit, she was right and he couldn't deny it. They had been happy together, just the two of them, for a time. The pregnancy had driven a wedge between them, and the crack couldn't be repaired. There was too much resentment there, too many hurtful words, ugly emotions buried under a carefully constructed layer of amicability they had built over the years since their separation.
In the meantime, Draco had finally caught up to the excitement at his front door, and he appeared just as shocked as his son.
"Can you teach me to fly?"
"Do you miss having house elves clean up after you?"
"Where?"
Draco shifted in his seat as he turned his attention back to his book. "No."
That evening, Harry watched from the large front doors of the school as Scorpius walked along the length of the stairs one at a time with deliberate slowness. He would occasionally look up to scan the quiet street and, when he saw no one, would go back to watching his feet as he walked. Almost all the children had gone home by then, the few stragglers meeting up with parents at the front wrought iron gate. Scorpius, however, had yet to be claimed.
Scorpius looked up at Draco and asked, "Did you ever lose?"
The potions were really starting to kick in when Harry got to Malfoy Manor. He was finding it hard to walk straight as he began to move almost weightlessly. He hadn't talked much since they left the hospital. He was preoccupied with keeping his wits about him. He sat down as soon as he could to keep the world from swimming. "I think I'm going to be sick."
He looked at Harry again. Harry was now watching him very plainly, as though expecting him to say something. Draco was dumbfounded. "She will eat you alive." As Harry's brows knit together, Draco thought it best to explain further. "I'm biased, since she's my ex-wife. But I've known her for almost a decade and I've known you for longer." Harry seemed like someone who needed a nurturing relationship. Astoria could barely provide that for her own son, let alone another man. "She comes from money. Wizard money. Nothing wrong with that, of course. I grew up the same way. It's just that if she doesn't get her-"
"Enough?" Draco finally echoed.
"Waitâ€¦ Does he have a mother and father?" All this laughing from Theo and scowling from Draco confounded Scorpius. He wasn't sure now. Maybe Harry did have a mother and father.
Scorpius and Teddy shot up to their feet, then stumbled about a few times as dizziness took their feet this way and that. "Cookies are done!"
"I do. I went to school with them, remember?"
Teddy was regaling them with stories from the Potter archives he kept in his head, exalting the moment his godfather had 'tamed a dragon in Gringotts, freed it, and then flown atop it to safety'. Scorpius was listening intently, mouth agape, dinner forgotten. Any meal with Teddy present often ended in Harry's embarrassment. Scorpius had so many questions, all of them directed at Harry, who answered begrudgingly while leaving out gory details. After dinner, Scorpius learned the hard way that adding more cocoa to his hot chocolate only made the drink more bitter. They played dice and card games for a couple of hours, Teddy managing to win most of them. A few mugs of hot chocolate and eggnog later, the clock struck eleven. The boys had run upstairs to continue their shenanigans since Teddy was sleeping over. Harry was thoroughly exhausted. He flopped onto the couch in the living room and marveled at the enormous Christmas tree from his vantage point. Malfoys sure knew how to decorate for the holidays. The tree had to be at least twelve feet tall, all the ornaments matched, silver twinkling lights shone between the needles, perfectly wrapped presents lay under it, and there were stockings filled to the brim hanging at the mantle. "You've been busy."
Draco was surprised that he wasn't met with a snappy comeback. "Do you want me to care?" he asked quietly.
"Yes, let's!" Scorpius threw his arms around Draco's legs. "Bye, Dad! Love you! I'll see you after school!" He zoomed out the house without waiting for a response.
Draco kept his eyes on his cards and said, "You're easy to read."
"You're starting to look a bit ugly too. He's probably rubbing off on you."
Scorpius knew he wouldn't win this argument. "It just is," he muttered. "Tell him, Harry."
"How?"
Harry slapped a hand to his face, forcing himself to keep his words even. "The nurse has suggested that he spend the day resting his leg, so it would be best for him to do that at home," he said with marked irritation and deliberation. "Which is why I'm asking you to come take a look and decide on what to do, as per school protocol. He can stand on his foot but I think it hurts him too much to walk. He is a little distressed. The best thing-"
"Of course, I did." Teddy snatched the wrapped gift out of Harry's hand while at the same time being dragged into the great room by Scorpius.
"Take some responsibility for your actions-"
," she grinned impishly with a chorus of laughter behind her before disappearing from the flames.
"You can borrow this, if you want," Teddy offered. "It's a fun read. This one has Spiderman kicking a bunch of different villain butts."
"But I won't be able to stop myself from eating it every day," Scorpius lamented. "It's so good! How do
Draco whipped his head to the side to find Harry sitting up beside him. Sunlight streamed around them. "Damn," they swore in unison.
tell him
. It was, by far, the creepiest thing he had ever seen. His eyes squeezed shut on their own accord. Potter was going to kill him. Potter was going to pull out a dagger, slit his throat, and then watch him bleed to death. Just a matter of time. Any second now.
He finally snapped in the common room one night.
"You're sure?" Draco wanted to make certain.
Harry was still marveling the festive decorations that adorned Malfoy Manor. Garlands twisted around the balustrade of the grand staircase, two ornamental trees stood on either side of the foyer, adorned in sparkling gold and silver ornaments, twinkling lights floated around the chandelier, homemade wall-hangings of little green elves and fairies hung in strands across doorways, and everything smelt of cinnamon. "It's all a little extravagant, don't you think?" he commented while taking off his coat.
"I see."
"To the wine cellar."
"Okay," Scorpius stammered, gripping the broom with all his might.
In the manor, Scorpius was running circles around the kitchen, recounting his newest trick to Patricia. He only stopped when she uncovered the casserole and a heavenly waft of roasted potatoes, melted cheese, and sweet ham made his stomach rumble something fierce. "I'm so hungry." He pawed at Patricia. "Is it dinnertime yet?"
"Did you tuck me in?"
"It's tough," Harry warned. "Think you're up for it?"
"I doubt that very much. He is quite stubborn."
"My father says that all the time." Scorpius squinted down at Harry's deft fingers. "He says it really quiet, so I can't hear him. But I still do." Tying shoelaces always looked like magic to him.
Scorpius set his jaw firmly. "Fine. If you're going home, then I'm going home too."
Apparently so because there was no response to the prompt.
"That's just how my face is," Draco frowned back.
Draco didn't lift his eyes off of the baked fish he was carefully plating as he said, "What do you need me for?"
"It's okay. I don't mind."
"What's that supposed to mean?" Harry prodded.
Draco staggered back. How was he supposed to be in all these places at once? "COMING!" he called to his son, but his eyes stayed on Harry. "You..." In the next instant he realized that he didn't have time for this. "Use the Floo, Potter." He snapped his fingers and pointed downstairs.
"You don't care if I spend time with her?"
Theo huffed. "You've had the Golden Boy in your pocket for
Draco rested his cheek against her blonde curls and let out a sigh. "Yes. I think so too."
embarrassed.
Okay, he had most likely gone mad.
An hour later, Scorpius stumbled out of bed with an errant thought in his head - Harry had slept over. He blearily padded down the cold stairs and into the kitchen where he heard sounds of breakfast. He was disappointed when he saw his father alone in there, puttering around, cooking eggs. "Where's Harry?" Scorpius complained.
"Five thirty?"
Patricia paused for a moment from her bed-making to glance at her charge who was blinking at her in all seriousness. She turned back to the bed to conceal her smile. "You know what? I don't think he is, Scorpius," she answered. "Why do you ask?"
"It's nothing."
"But you say that all the time," Scorpius complained. "And I know you're lying."
Draco tossed the damp towel over the boy's head again. "I don't want anything for Christmas." He began drying Scorpius off.
"Ah, Scorpius?" she called out.
"Let's see." Harry thought about it. "I love to sleep. I play with Rose and Hugo, have lunches and dinners with friends. If Teddy's around, he always wants to do things. Usually we fly in the evenings and have picnics. Recently I've been trying to grow some plants, but that hasn't been going well. I also do prep work for school. Sometimes I visit the Burrow. I like weekends."
"... He sprained his ankle?"
"But now they are all grown up," Scorpius reasoned. "And they need to be nice. That's how it works. When you grow up, you can't be rude anymore."
Harry hesitated. Then he shrugged. Then he said, "Something like that," his words muffled behind his hand.
"I could spare a spoon, I suppose."
The Malfoys spent the next few minutes examining crafts and drawings. Scorpius stood between his mother and father, clutching their hands tight. He was just too embarrassed to do anything but mope. He had been so prepared for this day and he had wanted to impress them. Astoria had come all this way to see him in the pageant. She had never seen him sing like this before. He was supposed to impress her with how much he had learned. Instead, he had choked and looked like a big baby in front of everyone. He hated this. He didn't ever want to come back to school ever again.
"You will not be arranging anything!" Harry realized that this was quickly getting out of hand. He had to put an end to it before it spun out of his control. "A handful of pictures, Percy. I haven't murdered anyone. I haven't stolen anything. I went to a goddamn carnival."
"Alright, alright," Teddy laughed as Scorpius' whine carried into his spine. "I had fun too. And now I'm hungry."
"Tell me."
"Burrow?"
Harry flicked invisible lint off his trousers. "Pets?"
"I'm painting!" Scorpius perked up excitedly. "I forgot to tell you! My class is doing a play and I'm making the trees and the castle. I have so many gold stars now."
When Harry arrived at the Malfoy Manor for the second night in a row, Draco had enough energy to let him in and then promptly fall back into bed. But Scorpius was very glad for the welcome interruption. He was getting bored with sleeping.
Harry had to smile. He shut his eyes and took a deep breath. "Only a little." This was turning out to be a rather complicated day. "Knowing that you care makes me feel loads better."
Before long, the two men were seated on the bench of a long banquet table in the middle of an enormous kitchen, mugs of steaming tea and plates of toast with eggs in front of them. Draco kept his eyes on his cup as he clutched it between his hands, letting the heat warm him. Breakfast was a quiet affair. It was also a hurried affair. Draco stopped eating as soon as he figured he had eaten enough to appease his host. Harry ate very quickly to make sure he was finished before Malfoy.
Harry shrugged as he took a swig from the bottle.
Draco held back his groan. The last thing he wanted was another scene, this time at school. He ducked his head so he could meet Scorpius' down-turned eyes. "You have to promise me you won't be anything but polite to him."
Harry hadn't realized they were getting to those questions this soon. The answer was simple. "Yes."
He gingerly did as he was told. The music stopped abruptly. Draco didn't think much of music. He wasn't a very musical or rhythmic person. It was just smooth noise to him, and he could do without it. He did notice that Harry liked to listen to music. Muggle records, mostly. "Where did you get this from?" Draco gestured at the gramophone.
"Because he can do whatever he wants. He's Harry Potter. He's really cool."
"Who told you that?"
"But they died. Right?" Scorpius finished.
And so, a few hours later, Draco found himself with Theo, waiting by the gates of the school and watching the front steps that were bustling with children. It took a few minutes before they spotted the little guy amidst all the other students. Scorpius nearly tripped over his feet when he saw that his father had come to pick him up
"I want to know."
Harry vaguely recalled being down here a few months ago, when he had had too much to drink. The cellar looked quite different when bathed in warm lantern glow. Opulent, one might say. The wine racks had expensive dust on them to show the valuable age of the wine nestled between them. The floors were rustic stone and the air was damp, cool. Wine wrapped around two of the walls, and there were a few barrels standing scattered on the floor. The lanterns were either affixed to the walls or simply floated near the rafted ceiling. There was a fortune down here, hidden under the Malfoy Manor. Harry gingerly pulled a bottle off the rack. The label was in Portuguese, something he couldn't read. Perhaps a Port wine, if he had to guess by the stenciled pictogram above the words.
Draco didn't know what to do. He just stood there, lost for words.
"Except when cooking," Teddy groaned. He scrambled up onto his feet and ran for the door.
Standing in front of the Malfoys was a young boy in a purple jumper and green overalls, with mussed-up brown hair, freckled cheeks, and an ear-splitting grin revealing brilliant white teeth.
. "You know,
Draco had felt his small black heart grow three times in size that day as he watched his son with friends skipping around the park on the most beautiful spring day. This was a side of Scorpius he rarely witnessed - a rambunctious, playful, excited schoolboy. What more could any father ask for? He looked down at Harry laying beside him, as flushed as the children at the party, mud staining his pants, eyes squeezed shut against the bright sun that was high above them, blades of grass stuck in his hair. Draco reached down and began picking the grass off, to restore some semblance of civility. His fingers twisted between Harry's black locks, a stark contrast of light and dark.
"But it's-"
"Well, this is how
Draco found his voice to say, "Yes." Next thing he knew, he was in his dark bedroom, being pushed against the wall as flighty, chilled fingers ran up his back and hungry kisses laced across his neck. It was like a dream. As if he was floating. He willed his hand to move, and it did, pressed up against Harry's chest.
"That's what I said."
Astoria tsked sympathetically. "Holiday buzz getting to you, perhaps." She walked out of the kitchen and left the men alone once again.
A minute later, Scorpius had his head by Draco's chest and they were reading the dragon book slowly. Draco wove his fingers into Scorpius' hair, massaging his scalp like his mother used to. Scorpius tugged at his ear for comfort. He wanted to forget about the creepy spiders and keep thinking about the white dragon. His eyes drooped shut not long after and he was asleep before he could get past page three. Draco didn't realize that until he was on the fifth page. He tilted his head down to find his son sleeping soundly. He put the book away. As tired as he was at the moment, he wouldn't be able to sleep. Not when Scorpius was like this.
Much was left unsaid.
"Between Ginny and me," Harry clarified.
"The Healer said I should regain almost full range of motion after a good night's rest."
Scorpius laid his head back down on Draco's chest without comment.
"No. They don't."
Harry didn't even have to think twice. "First door on the right," he said as Draco rushed past him. He cringed when he heard retching in the bathroom. He wandered into the drawing room, leaving Malfoy to his business.
"Oh, but why stop there?"
Draco stared at the gramophone. "How?" He leaned forward with a frown, trying to figure out how it worked.
Hermione did see. She saw a photo of Teddy and Scorpius eating blue cotton candy. There was one with Harry beside Scorpius, pointing at something off frame that made them laugh. She didn't really understand
"Pardon?"
"You were so cute," Astoria gushed as she picked her son up and hugged him tight. "I'm so proud of you, honey."
"Because, you know, I think Harry likes you a lot too. You shouldn't worry about what other people think, especially if they are bullies." Scorpius also knew something else. Sometimes it was hard to talk without knowing where to begin. Lucky for Draco, Scorpius knew exactly where to begin.
"I don't know," Scorpius mumbled as he quickly finished up his sweet and stuffed the pouch into his pocket. "What is it?"
Draco rolled his eyes. "Not as difficult as you'd think if you have a donkey carrying your pack."
Draco looked back, thinking that maybe the boys had snuck down for a snack. But there was no one there. He frowned and turned forward.
"For me?" Scorpius asked from behind his hand.
someone else," he corrected himself, "would you tell Scorpius?"
"He's put them up in his study!"
"Language." Draco threw a cursory stern look at his son before returning to his work.
wand."
Behind him, he heard Draco turn his exasperation at his ex-wife instead. "It's eleven, Astoria."
you, doesn't it? Nothing is ever your fault, is it? You are absolved from the mess because it's all his doing? Let others handle your shit for you, isn't that right?" She stormed forward and slammed her hands on the desk. "Grow the
"Look," he said through clenched teeth. "I've been telling you for years now, and I'm going to keep telling you the same thing - I am not part of the Dark Army anymore."
Harry realized that he really needed to learn to put a sock in it next time he felt like arguing with Malfoy. Lately it seemed to end with him wanting to take back his words. He cleared his throat. "Sorry. That was uncalled for."
Scorpius swept his eyes across all of them. "Good morning."
She came to his rescue without batting an eye. "I'm all out." She snatched the remaining candy from Harry's basket. "There's more candy canes in the classroom. Grab them for me?" She jerked her thumb at the door behind them, giving him a 'smooth' exit strategy.
"I was being honest," Harry said. "I don't have one." Draco opened his mouth to retort, but Harry interjected, saying, "I know you don't believe me. Or maybe it's hard for you to believe that someone would walk into Malfoy Manor without an ulterior motive." He shrugged. "I don't want to hold grudges anymore, not if it stops Teddy from being around Scorpius." He then nodded once. "There you go. Scorpius is your ulterior motive. Teddy is mine. Happy?"
"What are you doing?" Draco hissed as he slapped Theo's hand down. "Are you insane?"
Draco rolled over and pushed Harry back against the bed, straddling his hips, and taking him by surprise. "Why?" He studied Harry intently. "Is there more?" He kissed Harry hard without waiting for an answer.
Harry gave the stew a final taste before setting the spoon down and sitting beside Draco again. "I'm the exception."
"You're more Muggle than wizard." Draco pulled some ice out of Harry's hair. "You never have your wand on you."
"Where are you going?" Scorpius wanted to know.
"Five more minutes." Draco turned his back to Harry and sank into the pillows again. His exposed skin was flawless and creamy, faint musculature visible when he shifted in his sleep. Harry slid a hand down his spine, eliciting a shiver. He tsked and arched away.
"I have to go to the bathroom," he said haltingly. He really was going to cry now. He slipped away despite mild protests from Draco and Astoria, and ran out of the classroom.
"Yummy, right?"
Draco forced out an exhale. He was determined not to be happy. He picked up the shuddering kettle and began pouring steaming water over the coffee grounds by hand. He found Potter absolutely baffling. Especially at this moment, gloating in his kitchen, pretending to know everything, barging into his life. "You could have said no to Scorpius."
"I know, I know."
"Hey."
"We don't."
Harry understood what the worst part was. The worst part was that Draco had no one to blame but himself. Worst part was that Scorpius could be associated with those crimes, just as Draco has been associated with Lucius'. There was no running away from that and no one else to blame for it.
"You could say that," Draco murmured as he joined Harry on the couch. He took another look at the mantle above the fireplace, this time from afar. Potter's life was different from his. The mantle was a good depiction of it. Cluttered with photographs, curious memorabilia, disorder, and dust bunnies. In contrast, all the mantles at Draco's manor was either stark bare or had some antique baubles that his mother had placed ages ago. He had never thought himself to be the sentimental sort. These days, though, he couldn't be so sure. It wouldn't be so bad if he had a photograph of Scorpius on his writing desk.
"Breakfast?"
" Scorpius and Louis skipped around the kitchen, cookie in hand. They bumped into Harry by the fireplace, stuffed the cookie in their mouth, and held their palms out for another.
"Thank you."
In the meantime, Draco sidled up to Harry. Theo pretended not to hear the following mutterings.
Harry dumped the sliced mushrooms into the stew, then tossed the knife and cutting board into the sink. "Dinner will be ready in about an hour, if you can wait."
Draco carted his fingers through his son's soft hair. Scorpius had reduced that difficult conversation to such simple and decisive words. Was it really that easy? Draco couldn't believe it. "Scorpius?"
"When we get home, you need to sing it for me, okay? Just by yourself."
Scorpius' shoulders slumped. "Oh Dad..." he groaned.
"No surprises there."
"Old fashioned way, then." He felt his way down the stone stairs, dragging his hand over the rough wall as he ventured into the unlit cellar. Once he reached level ground, he started searching blindly for the lanterns his father had kept around the place.
"That sounds like a wonderful way to spend your Christmas break."
"Harry Potter?"
"Never mind who my sources are. Tell me," Theo prodded.
Scorpius smiled slyly. "Well, Harry says-"
Harry flipped the letter to reveal Scorpius' drawing of the three of them on broomsticks, flying in the clouds with the manor beneath them.
Scorpius pretended not to hear him. He brought the letter up to his eyes. "Her name is Ginny Weasley." He smiled triumphantly at his father. "
"There we go. I'm sure he appreciates that." Harry grabbed a chair and dragged it towards the bed so he could sit down next to the Scorpius. The nurse seemed to have tended to the small scrapes on Scorpius' hands and elbows already. Everything looked as good as new except for his healed ankle that still seemed a bit swollen. "Are you aching anywhere else, Scorpius?"
He slid to the ground with his head in his hands. "What the hell?" he exhaled in disbelief. Potter had finally gone mad!
"Did you fight with him again?"
Harry tightened his hold on the books as a spark of guilt jolted through him. "I'm not pretending."
Draco sat next to Scorpius and handed over the leaves he had collected. "I found them near work. I thought you might like them," he said. "Do you?"
That evening after school let out, Scorpius stayed in the classroom while all the other children left the premises. He watched Harry tidy up the tables and chairs with Gabrielle cleaning the blackboard and putting away all the books. In the back of his mind, he felt a nagging worry pulling his attention away but he pushed it back. He didn't mind visiting Harry's house again. He hadn't explored it yet and it looked like a house that had a lot of secrets. He was just a bit confused as to why his father would send a message to Harry.
A small knot twisted in Draco's stomach. Now that Scorpius had started proper school, he had been invited over for many playdates and even a few sleepovers by his friends. That was all well and good. Patricia would handle it without a hitch. Draco didn't have to meddle one bit. However, what sane parent would send their child to a birthday party in the Malfoy Manor? This wasn't a two way street. "Don't you want to keep celebrating with your mother and me?"
"No." Draco felt like a broken record. "I already told you, I am
"But you just said it's nothing to worry about."
A cool breeze rustled the leaves above them. He titled his head up and shut his eyes. Even behind his lids, he sensed beams of light flickering through the branches of the old tree. He breathed in the scent of autumn around him. It was a beautiful day. He cracked his eyes open and looked at Draco, near enough to make out faint wrinkles at the corner of his eye, watching him pretend to read.
"Protective," Harry repeated firmly, despite Draco's pointed side-eye. "I wanted to make sure he was alright with us before we came over. He assured me he was. Give him some time."
Across the top ran a flashing red headline that read, 'A PICTURE PERFECT DAY FOR THE BOY-WHO-LIVED'.
Draco reached out to stop Harry. When Harry glanced back, Draco, almost subconsciously, went in for another kiss.
Harry looked up in surprise when Draco also knelt down. His eyes widened still when Draco moved towards him, prompting him to back away. Before he could catch himself, he lost his balance and fell on his butt. He bumped against the bookshelf with nowhere to go, Draco closing the gap in an instant. Harry gulped and brought the books in his hands up between them, forcing Draco to stop barely an inch away. He waited for Draco to say something, or do something. But nothing happened. Draco stayed as he was, his disconcerting pale eyes boring a hole through Harry. That was almost as bad as doing something. Draco was too close for comfort and appeared rather determined to not move another inch until he heard what he wanted to hear. Flustered, Harry said, "Sorry...?"
He let out a quiet sigh before rolling over onto his side. The setting sun cast a red hue in his bedroom. He studied Draco's sleeping face, disheveled fair hair fanning the pillow, lips parted to make way for quiet breaths, an arm thrown over his eyes, revealing the faint Dark Mark. Harry lifted his hand from under the sheets and brought it up, stopping just short of Draco's cheek. He let his hand land on Draco's shoulder instead and shook him awake.
"I don't knowâ€¦ Something." It's just that Scorpius was starting to like Harry because he was being so nice to him. Then maybe being nice wasn't as bad as he had thought.
Harry was shaken by the point-blank answer, but he tried not to show it. "I see." He realized that he was being too nosy and getting into personal affairs. That answer was definitely not a typical one. "So if you
Scorpius spun around to face Harry fully, his eyes as wide as saucers and his mouth agape.
"What pictures?" Teddy asked excitedly. He loved drama and there seemed to be a whole lot of it brewing in the foyer. He wasted no time in bounding down the stairs and snatched the magazine out of Harry's grasp. "Cool! Whoa! Look at that!" He held the Witch Weekly out for Scorpius to see. Scorpius had ventured into the foyer, slinking between Ron and Hermione. "It's us, Scorp! We look grand," Teddy declared. His eyes popped out when he saw more pictures. "Did you even know they were taking these? I had no idea."
"All this talk about being friends, it's rubbish, isn't it?"
Patricia laughed at his eagerness. "Yes, sweetheart. Dinner is ready."
He grabbed Draco by the arm and swung him around. "Argh!" Draco cried out while shielding his eyes against the blazing orange sun that blinded him in an instant. In the meantime, Harry had already left him in the dust, diving straight downward in a tight spiral towards the grass for a 'graceful' win as the Snitch made contact with his awaiting palm. Behind him, he heard an enraged, "POTTER!"
"Yes?" Harry asked as he gestured for the two to come in.
After the tumble in the wine cellar last night, Draco had managed to herd Harry up the stairs towards one of the many guest bedrooms. "I'm fine," Harry had kept repeating while tripping over his own feet on the way down the long hallways of the mansion. "Bossy as always, Malfoy." Draco had rolled his eyes instead of responding. Then Harry had stopped, turned to face Draco and asked, "Hey. Can I say something?"
"What would you like to know?" Theo relished this more than he cared to admit. A whole new generation of Malfoys. Absolutely delightful.
having all this." She smiled at Draco. "I'm happy like this. Are you?"
Harry laughed at Scorpius' enthusiastic answer. He had a feeling that, despite Draco's tough looks, he would cave to Scorpius' ask in a few years yet, malaria or not. "You and Astoria are quite the jet-setters, it seems," Harry told Theo.
"Does that matter?"
Scorpius scowled at his father. "Go away," he snubbed. "I'm busy. I can't play with you right now."
"No."
"Oh wow." Scorpius was amazed. "Then? Then what happened?"
"You don't have to," Harry admitted. "What's there to say, right?"
Harry jerked his hand away with a frown. "It's the kitchen. It's haunted or something."
"Right, that is clear enough. But what's the plan
"I'm free. No plans."
"Have you spoken to him?"
"I've been practicing with Dad almost every night," Scorpius told Harry at school, by the playground. Scorpius was on the monkey bars, swinging with ease between the rungs, while Harry helped a little girl near the swings with her coat zipper that had gotten stuck.
Scorpius giggled as Harry and Teddy scowled at each other. Those two were silly. He gulped down his juice really quick because he wanted to show Teddy the peacock he had almost caught a few days ago. As soon as Teddy was finished with his cereal, the two boys ran out the backdoor into the warm sunny morning, promising to be back in a jiffy because Teddy had a lunch date with his grandmother at noon.
"Don't do that." Draco nudged Scorpius' chin.
"I'm a metamorphmagus," Teddy explained. "I can change into whoever I want to be. I've been practicing Harry for years and years. I'm pretty good, huh?"
Draco was still trying to comprehend what had happened. His knuckles were white as they gripped the edge of the marble counter, his eyes blinked fast in an attempt to decipher reality, and his jaw was agape, no sound escaping him.
Downstairs, Draco was setting out bowls, cereal, and milk on the table when Harry walked into the kitchen, asking, "Got any sugar?" Draco pointed out the sugar bowl on the countertop. After Harry had hunted down a spoon, he added some much needed sweetness to his coffee while enjoying the warmth beaming through the enormous windows. He tossed the spoon in the sink and turned to find Draco watching him. "What?"
Draco tilted his head and muttered, "That's what I thought." He pulled away, slapped the books out of Harry's hands, and stood up, paying no mind to the indignant exclamation that followed him on his way out the study.
"Don't tell me shut up." Draco got up and grabbed Harry by the arm to spin him around so they were facing each other. "This isn't about you. You are used to this. You can handle this. This is about me. It's about Scorpius."
"Oh. I
have a problem?" he ventured to ask.
"Oh my," Astoria Greengrass exclaimed.
"We will," she whispered back as she struggled to get her bag and her son through the door.
"Here," Draco said as he pulled the backpack away from Scorpius' shoulders. "No need to act so thrilled."
"I'm not brave. If I was brave, I wouldn't cry."
Scorpius didn't say anything to that.
Draco didn't lift his eyes off the page as he answered, "And skip your nap? No."
He blinked away the sunlight and pressed a few fingers to his eyes. "Oh," he moaned. He felt like death had washed over him. It was horrid.
"Hey, Harry."
Harry was frowning by now. "I understand."
"Well? Aren't you going to read it?" Teddy followed close behind.
"I was saying that Draco has made sure of it," Harry mumbled. "Protecting Scorpius, I mean. From the past."
Draco was just about to shut the door when their eyes met.
"This summer for that Quidditch game. He can come over to the Burrow with me," Harry said. "All the kids play and he won't be the youngest either. It's a great time."
to be alone. I like having people over. It's fun, something different."
Harry was baffled. "What?"
"I should go back to bed and eat more oranges," Scorpius answered dutifully.
A little while later, Scorpius slipped and skidded his way to Theo and Draco real quick when he saw them standing at the front gates after school. "Uncle Theo!" he cheered. "Happy New Year!"
"Quite."
Their light banter was interrupted by a loud and long knock on their door. In fact, the knocking didn't stop. It was steady and full of purpose. Draco and Scorpius were puzzled. Who could that be? They moved as one towards the kitchen window and craned their necks to peer at the front landing.
"Now, just to be
Harry shrugged again. "I was just trying to clear things up."
Harry ruffled the boy's soft blonde hair and stood up. Scorpius watched his teacher move to the table next to him and kneel down next to little Lucy and speak with her in a low voice, no doubt saying nice things to her too. But he didn't mind that. It was just so strange to see someone who was so caring and kind to everyone. He looked down at his half-done worksheet. Whenever Harry encouraged him, he felt like trying even harder. He pressed his pencil to the paper and carefully traced the triangle. He wanted Harry to keep saying nice things to him, even if he said those things to all the children.
Another hour went by for Draco. An hour of pacing the small room bathed in yellow light, worrying about Scorpius even though he was perfectly fine with Patricia, cursing the Ministry, for whatever that was worth. An hour before the door to the interrogation room was opened by the Hit wizard. Draco stopped his pacing.
so bad," Scorpius sobbed. "I practiced so hard and I was still so bad. I really practiced."
Draco pushed open the door an inch and peeked into the dimly lit bedroom. He rested his aching head against the cold doorjamb as he watched his son sleep soundly, curled up near Harry, who lay atop the blanket with a careless arm thrown over Scorpius. The scene was incredibly laughable and straight out of a storybook. Draco's life was rather surreal at the moment, and the fever wasn't helping his case. He flicked his wand above the bed to cast a gentle stream of cold air across the room. Huddled this close together, it would be wonder if the two didn't wake up drenched in sweat. He shut the door behind him and walked downstairs where his work was spread out in the study yet again.
More than anything, he wanted this.
"You two are quite close, huh?"
"Are you asking me if I've been with a man?"
"Harry?" He could barely whisper through his dry throat.
That shut Draco up quick.
"Hmm. I wasn't in the mood either."
"I don't think the world is ready for that," Harry snickered.
"That's awfully nice of you. Then I suppose I will just have to share my secret star technique with you."
Their banter was interrupted when the fire whooshed unexpectedly, turning bright green and causing the children to fall backwards, away from the heat and light. Out stepped a rather sooty Hermione and Ron, practically tripping over Teddy and Scorpius in their excitement to get out of the fireplace. Scorpius coughed as he inhaled some of the black smoke while Teddy frantically swatted at his singed hair.
"Are you destroying my son's clothes?!" Draco gasped.
Ron was beginning to read between the lines now. "Then, isn't this for the best?" he asked gently. "Wasn't this the wake-up call you were waiting for? All of you?" He sat down next to Harry. "Over the past year, we've been seeing less of you. You hardly talk to us. I doubt you talk to them about us. It must be tiring, living two lives. The new year will be here soon. It's time for a fresh start."
"Harry doesn't treat me special." Scorpius shook his head to emphasize his point. "He's nice to everyone. Really. And maybe he didn't know
"Mhm," Scorpius mumbled with reluctance.
Astoria laughed again, surprised by Draco's candid comment. Instead of pressing further, she decided to enjoy her fantasy for a bit longer. She wrapped an arm around his elbow, snuggling up close to him as a cold breeze blew over them, and waved at Scorpius who was emphatically gesturing at the cotton candy vendor.
And that's how Harry ended up spending a Saturday morning at the grounds of Malfoy Manor with Scorpius, a dish full of bird seed, and a large metal cage with a stick propping up the door. The two of them camped out behind a tree until lunchtime before giving up because they couldn't feel their toes and their stomachs were rumbling. When they trudged back into the manor, they were met with Draco, who had on an I-told-you-so expression, which was entirely unhelpful, and bowls of piping hot beef stew, which was entirely helpful. The cold bird hunters slurped up their lunch with gusto. An hour later, the three of them went back out to the orchard to find an empty dish, an upside down cage, and disturbed mud. Scorpius was ecstatic.
Sunlight filtered through a crack in the thick maroon curtain, striking him. He tried to blink against it, but it was difficult. He brought a hand up to his swollen eye, then to his painfully dry lips.
"Antagonizing," Harry said deliberately.
"I am
"Of course I care!" Scorpius pulled away from Harry. He looked a mess. Tears streaked his flushed face, he had a snotty nose, and his lips were turned down into the saddest frown. "I know what Daddy did when he was a kid," he began, stumbling over his words between sobs. "I know that no one likes him. I know your not-so-proper family doesn't like him. I know
"He never lies to me about stuff like this."
"Cry a bit, if you want."
Scorpius didn't think it was all that great because his father was looking rather awful at the moment. "Dad? Are you alright?"
He came to an stumbling halt when he was met with Harry, who was sitting outside the booking office. They blinked at each other, but Draco quickly gathered his wits. "Potter."
Patricia knew that she was making Draco uncomfortable. It was one of those rare occasions for her and she didn't let the opportunity slip by. "Scorpius has been acting strangely."
Harry raced down the grand staircase three steps at a time, nearly twisting his ankle on the last hop. He slashed his wand at the fireplace just as he heard the front door open. He had disappeared from the manor right when Patricia walked in.
Harry, to his credit, didn't laugh out loud. "Don't worry, I haven't forgotten your name." He then shrugged. "It's just something I call you kids, I suppose. Don't want me to?"
Draco didn't say.
This was a cruel dream.
"So?"
Harry's attention wandered when he heard his name being mentioned in the passing.
to say it because he doesn't have a mother. Right?"
"Dad?"
"Mhm. I want to draw
Scorpius lifted his head up a bit to reveal his pale eyes over his father's shoulder. He stared at Harry for a moment.
Harry stepped up to Draco, eyes narrowed, and asked, "Are you going to pick these up?" He gestured at the books on the floor.
"You can talk about him." Ron added a curt nod as further permission.
Draco stilled his quill with his eyes downcast.
Draco's heart was suddenly racing as he blinked into the blindness. Before he could speak, he felt a hand on his arm and heard Harry say, "Does it matter?" The touch moved up, brushing against his shoulder and stopping at the crook of his neck. A disembodied caress. "I could be anyone right now, couldn't I?" Draco shut his eyes and drew a breath. The room smelt of old casks, faint rot, and damp stone. "You could be anyone." Or no one. The touch glided down his chest, over his stomach, and came to a rest at his thigh. He exhaled. "Man, woman. What's the difference?" The air was stifling now. "What does it matter?"
Draco brushed his cheek with the back of his hand, wiping away the grit. "Pleased with yourself?"
"It is after lunch." Astoria flicked her wand at the presents to sweep them into the manor. Draco had to swiftly sidestep to move out of the way of the flying bags and boxes. "Is Scorpius inside?" She carefully walked up the icy stairs.
Draco snorted in derision. Yet another thing to worry about. "As you so eloquently put it, 'when everything inevitably goes to shit', what do I tell Scorpius?" he asked. "That you've decided to pursue more lucrative pastimes than giving him free flying lessons?"
"Weasleys?" Astoria let out a short laugh. "That would be the day."
But nothing happened.
"It's just past six," Harry said.
"Is this typical conversation to have with your students, Potter?"
Three days to keep lying to each other. Why spoil it with truths?
He stumbled to a halt the moment he clapped eyes on Harry and Ron.
"I'm just tired," Draco said. "You don't have to-"
"I like the excitement too." She lounged back against the cushions and gestured for Harry to hand her Rose. He carefully placed the little girl into Ginny's arms. Once they were settled down, she laid her head on his shoulder and they listened to Bill's quiet words that retold an ominous tale.
Harry cocked his head to the side.
A few moments later, when Harry arrived upstairs with a couple mugs of hot tea, he found Draco warming up by the fire. Despite using charms to ward off the snow, he had still managed to get splashes of water on him. He ruffled the rain out of his hair and was rolling up his damp sleeves when Harry handed him the tea. "I don't have coffee in the house." The freezing rain had started an hour ago and showed no signs of letting up, with wind gusting raindrops straight into the windowpane, a steady drumming.
Draco didn't speak as he continued to examine his son's drawings.
"On no!" Scorpius squeaked as Draco's jaw dropped.
Scorpius whooped. "I gotta tell Nanna." He zoomed off to the manor so Patricia could hear all about the neat trick he had learned.
Scorpius startled and the book that had been held in his hand fell to the ground with a resounding thud, waking him up. He sat up suddenly. "Dad?"
"I'm going upstairs too." Scorpius ran after Teddy.
"Hello, Rose."
cousin!"
Harry was, quite frankly, terrified to leave the crying child alone with this man. But he really had no grounds to stay. He all but stumbled out the door. However, instead of closing it behind him, he stood with a hand over the doorknob, leaving the door slightly ajar so he could barge in if needed.
being careful. Stop embarrassing me'. When Draco returned his attention to Harry, he realized that Harry was waiting patiently for him to continue talking. "Oh." It wasn't often that anyone wanted to hear him speak about work. "We handle small settlements. Mostly marital disputes and inheritance issues." He trailed off. "Nothing interesting."
Harry snapped his teeth together, now positively fuming as he glared at Draco. "No," he said deliberately. "Your problem is that you try to protect Scorpius to such an extent that it suffocates him."
"You haven't. I like you just the way you are," Luna decided.
Astoria gasped. "Oh dear, how improper of me." She began to get up. "How about a cup of coffee? Draco just brewed a fresh pot."
"Sure."
Draco hated to admit that this was fun, whatever this was. Since Scorpius came into his life, his idea of fun had changed drastically. Fun as a father was helping his son with homework, worrying as he took flight, listening to him excitedly talk about his friends, and hunting for peacocks. Being a single father was tiring. It left him drained at night, ready to welcome a few hours of quiet rest. Fun with Potter was different.
"About what?"
"Where are we going?" Scorpius asked Harry for the umpteenth time.
"Then you haven't."
Harry sat down on the bed and rubbed his sandy eyes with his fist. In the background, doors opened and shut , water ran steady, and there were quiet footsteps. He laid down on the cool mattress. He was aware of lights being extinguished and the mattress dipping beside him. He drifted off to a heavy sleep a breath later, just as Draco pulled him close.
Definitely cheating, Harry decided.
Harry didn't press Draco. He stood up, gesturing for Draco to lead the way. Some whispers followed them along the unmarked, winding corridors. Harry hung back on purpose, his eyes trained on the back of Draco's head. Draco refused to show his lethargy in front of those Ministry officials. He'd be damned if he let them break him. Once they had turned towards the elevators, the stares started to lessen, which made Draco relax more. After they were on the elevator and on the way out of the Ministry, no one looked twice.
"What would you rather be doing?"
"I believe you," Harry said.
"He wasn't very nice."
Scorpius stiffened.
An hour later, Draco, who had just walked into the kitchen after putting Scorpius down for a much needed afternoon nap, stopped short when he saw Harry, who was leaning against the counter, sipping on a cup of tea he had helped himself to after having cleared the table. "I really am quite famous, you know?"
Harry was mildly surprised by how candid Draco was being. "And what's the big picture?"
"Do you know what he told me when I asked him if he could take care of you?" Draco continued. "He said, 'Of course. He's family, isn't he?' If you are ever in a bind, he would help you out, no matter what. Even after all that's happened, he would help. Family is
Harry gnashed his teeth together. He wasn't going to give Draco the satisfaction. "You're not nearly as smooth as you think you are," he mumbled under his breath. He crouched down to pick the books up.
"No." Then, without another word and in the blink of an eye, Harry had grasped Draco's wrist and pulled his arm forward.
Draco dug his fingers into his knees. Anything but the truth serum. "Harry Potter."
"I'm sure you will."
The doorbell rang. He glanced at the clock. Ten. While Draco plated the bacon, he heard the front door open followed by muffled conversation. Harry had arrived to pick up Ted for the day. Christmas Eve. Draco gathered up the bacon and eggs, floating them ahead of him. As he exited the kitchen, Astoria and Harry entered the dining room.
"With me."
it," she gushed. "You were brilliant. I had eyes for no one else." She pulled back to kiss her son's cheek. Then she handed him the long-stemmed red rose that she had been holding onto. "For you."
Scorpius hadn't realized that he was pouting until then. He quickly pulled his lower lip back in and attempted to put on a pleasant expression. "It's okay," he said with a small smile. He was now sitting on the island countertop in the kitchen, watching Draco get his after-school snack ready. "Sometimes it's okay to be a baby."
"Stop that, Scorpius. It's absolutely undignified."
Harry's smile faltered. "I... Uh, yeah. You're welcome."
up! For the sake of Scorpius, grow up."
Draco looked up to find Scorpius standing by the doorway, half-hidden by the wall. He rearranged his expression and managed a weak smile. He gestured for his son to come closer. Scorpius shook his head and dropped his gaze to his socked feet. That made Draco's smile disappear. "Scorpius?"
Draco shot up to his feet, both affronted and humiliated by this whole affair that he had been determined to put behind him for the past three days. "Just forget it." He set his cup of tea down with a clatter on the table, sloshing half of it over the scuffed wood, and spun on his heel to leave.
"He is being
Draco got up, fixed his shirt, seemed to think about having the last word, then thought better of it before walking away without a second glance.
"Ginny. Who. Wrote. It?"
"Twenty minutes." Harry grabbed Draco by the arm again and pulled him along while disapparating.
"That's that?"
Harry knew pressing Scorpius would get him nowhere. So he said, "Alright, it's nothing." He let go of Scorpius, who looked relieved. But before he could turn to leave, Harry asked, "Are you doing anything fun for the holidays?"
Harry waved goodbye.
The Aurors glanced at each other with a loaded look, as though they had been expecting such an upheaval. Draco felt panic rise up in him in an enormous wave. They had 'evidence' against him. Now they would want to look at his memories and feed him that blasted truth serum and-
"Of course."
"What's Malfoy like?" a disembodied voice finally asked.
"You don't know what you're missing," Teddy garbled.
Draco rubbed the back of his neck, privately wishing Scorpius had inherited his discreet nature instead of Astoria's precociousness. He decided on responding with a nonchalant, "So what?"
"Hey, where's mine?" Theo complained while holding up his hand.
He set about doing just that, now using both hands to smoosh peanut butter into an egghead with mismatched hollow eyes and a pointy nose. "I'm not very good at it." He showed his sad attempt to Harry.
"If Potter hadn't decided to romp around town-"
Harry wrenched the magazine open and hurriedly flipped to the middle where the feature spread was printed for all to see. There were many more pictures inside, three pages of them.
Draco hung his head in defeat.
"Worst is you, of course."
She winked at him cheekily. "I just wanted you to have some more excitement in your life, darling. All you do is sleep and work. Your life revolves around Scorpius. Harry Potter is just the right kind of drama â€“ nothing too sensational but just enough scuffles. Theo's told me all about it."
Harry dragged a hand through his hair in exasperation. "Look, I... It's not that I've forgotten all of that. But why does Scorpius have to pay for it?"
"You know my father?" Scorpius asked during recess. He was sat next to Harry on the grass with his sore leg stretched out in front of him and a picture book nestled on his lap.
"What are you doing?" Draco asked weakly.
"Okay, hypothetically, if you were dating someone else, would you-"
"I've got to get back." Hermione glared at her husband. Then she turned to Harry. "I'll see you later, okay? Tomorrow for lunch? You'll need your rest tonight. And please do as the Mediwizard tells you."
"Let's sing like we practiced yesterday," Harry told them. "I'll be standing there." He pointed to the back of the room. "Watch Gabrielle or me if you get nervous or don't know the next words. We know all the songs, so we'll help you out. Remember to smile! Have fun!"
"We can't spend Christmas with you."
"Leaves?"
"... What are you talking about?"
Draco leaned forward to meet Theo's glower with a scathing look of his own. "The least I could do is tell him how much of your mother's money you've gambled away playing in goblin stocks."
Draco and Astoria had reconnected through mutual friends a few years after the war. After just five months of dating, they had gotten engaged and married. They were lovestruck and young. They had gone through so much in the war, they understood each other's dreams and nightmares. They were happy. But only for three years. Only until Scorpius' unannounced arrival.
need to go," Draco groaned as he tried to shove Harry down the stairs.
"But it's not hard," Scorpius cried. "It's not hard. Everyone else can do it, so why can't I?"
"But I don't have plans."
"Oh!" That was all the explanation the adults provided before they scurried out of the living room, evidently in search of Harry.
"Oof," she grunted and dropped her luggage on the floor dramatically, all the while keeping her eyes on her ex-husband from over their child's shoulder. He didn't move away from the banister he was leaning against. She scowled at him and pushed her bag forward with her foot. He arched a brow in contempt.
?" Draco made a show of thinking hard, then began reciting word for word, "
Most of them glanced at each other, pursing their lips to indicate that they had nothing at all to say, whatever gave him that idea? Silence dragged on for a bit of time, making Teddy more and more irritable. If no one had anything to say, he just wished they would stop bugging him. Or start bugging him. Anything but what he had been put through for the past two months.
"Hey, buddy. How are you feeling?" he asked Scorpius, who was lying down on the small cot with his foot elevated by pillows. The nurse left them alone in the room.
," he said. This was the sort of nonsense he was trying to shield his son from. "You are his teacher. You have no right digging into his personal life, filling his head with fancy tales, playing mind games. He is a child. You have no right over him!" He snapped his teeth shut. He realized that he had gone overboard, let his emotions best him.
"I'm fine," Harry replied quickly while struggling to get up.
"Bye, Scorpius," Harry called out.
"Do you want to stay over at ours?"
Harry interrupted before Draco could finish. "I won't say anything. But how long is a moment?"
Draco remembered, of course. He folded his arms across his chest. "Have you figured it out?"
"He's changed, you know."
Ginny shook her head at him. "I knew something was up with you." She stood up and headed for the door. "Turns out you're just in luuuuurve."
Draco knew there was no stopping this storm, yet he couldn't help but try... "I don't know why he said that. I'll talk to him-"
"But Harry's okay, right?" Scorpius wanted to know.
The two of them stood that way for a little while. Draco had time to compose himself and Harry didn't rush him. He remembered that Scorpius had cried on his shoulder over a year ago, after the winter pageant. Draco eventually dried his eyes on Harry's shirt before stepping away. Like father, like son. Harry smiled as he placed the back of his hand on Draco's forehead. Just as he had suspected. "You've got a fever too."
He practically stumbled all the way to his mum and dad as the children dispersed after Gabrielle's short 'thank you' talk. He just wanted to sit in Astoria's lap and cry, but he couldn't possibly do that in front of all his classmates and their parents. He would have to wait until he had gone home.
"That's very kind, Scorpius. I'm looking forward to it."
owling that letter for you," Draco scoffed.
"Why?"
Scorpius didn't fancy having a pretty name. But he wasn't about to have an argument with this girl he had just met. "Thank you," he said dutifully. "You have a pretty name as well, Rose. Like a flower."
"I didn't have much else to do," Harry said. "How are you?"
Harry swallowed hard and nervously rolled up the magazine in his hands. "They're rather good pictures," he said in an attempt to lighten the mood. "Have you taken a look at them?"
"Have you asked him?"
"It's... Harry Potter."
"Not until you get an Outstanding on your O.W.L.s, you little scamp." Their voices disappeared further into the manor, leaving Harry and Draco alone in the wine cellar, in silent thought and glad for the welcome interruption.
"Stupid Harry. Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid." Scorpius' squeaky name calling was muffled.
Harry laughed and nodded. "Just be careful when you go upstairs, okay? Some of the rooms are strange."
"You could stay hereâ€¦?"
"Fine," he mumbled as he poured himself some orange juice. "Scorpius upstairs?"
"Wait."
Harry's grin faltered when he recognized Astoria and Draco standing behind Scorpius. It had been a couple of weeks since the incident with the collarbone. Harry could tell by the way Draco was staring at him that he was waiting for the right time to say something. Harry averted his gaze and turned his attention to Scorpius instead. "How was your play, Prancer?"
Harry tapped the banquet table with the edge of his wand distractedly, lost in thought. "Hypothetically." He paused and raised his brows at Draco to indicate that he was speaking very hypothetically.
"What book?"
Draco scowled at Harry as he gathered the bits of scrap paper left behind from Teddy and Scorpius' crafting session. "Don't be crass, Potter."
"He can come over with me."
"They make sense," Draco said.
"Get off of my property."
big." He pretended to hold baby Teddy in his arms. "And now look at you! Almost thirteen. Time flies."
Scorpius eyed the brown goop with some doubt before digging a finger into the blob and pulling off a small piece. It didn't feel like play dough. He ate it. It didn't taste like play dough.
"He had to be taken to St. Mungo's."
"Then you haven't seen him bossing Draco around the house," Theo declared. Scorpius responded by harrumphing.
Scorpius clambered through the front door while frantically kicking off his boots and throwing his mittens on the ground. "Hi, Dad!" he shouted as he sprinted to the loo, zooming past Draco who was sitting at the dining table, writing up some court documents. It was February and Scorpius had absolutely insisted on flying. Both he and Harry were chilled to the bone. Harry tugged his scarf loose as he wandered into the dining room, the only room in the manor that was lit that evening.
"Sure!" Scorpius didn't have to be told twice for a chance to jump on the swings. He dumped his backpack with Draco and raced away, melting into the crowd of children leaving for the day.
The next morning, Patricia and Draco were in the kitchen, the former preparing breakfast and lunch for the day while the latter sipped on his first cup of coffee. Upstairs they heard all sorts of commotion. Patricia had to stifle a laugh when she heard a third crash of what could only be drawers slamming shut. Draco rolled his eyes and said, "We already picked out his clothes last night. I don't know what to do with him." Patricia didn't bother stifling her laughter when she heard that.
Harry bristled. "Well, it's the truth, isn't it?" he argued. "Teddy has been asking about-"
The two of them sat back with mirroring disgruntled grunts and started stabbing their dinner while Harry and Scorpius shared a smile.
Harry seemed committed to keeping his eyes on the flames. He blew on the steaming tea a few times, then sipped it, his gaze unwavering from the fire licking at the glowing logs. "All of it?" he eventually asked.
She kicked the bag at him, hitting him in the shins. "Ow!" he snipped. "What did you pack in there? Bricks?"
With a defeated sigh, Draco kissed him hard, knowing full well they were going to regret this.
These thoughts had been running wild circles in Draco's mind all day and well into the night. Astoria had left for one of her holiday soirees, the boys were full of sweets and passed out upstairs in Scorpius' room, and Draco was still nursing his whiskey in an attempt to quiet his thoughts when there was a knock at the door.
"Of course he is. He's only seven. Still a ways to go."
He pulled the door open. "What do you want?"
"Yes."
"Especially not your father," Harry pressed a finger to his lips.
Scorpius was quick to come to Harry's defense. "Harry helped me so much," he told Astoria. "We practiced, me and him and Michael and Lisa. Could you tell?"
"Don't interrupt my pitch."
"Don't be a spoilsport," Scorpius chided. He set about inspecting the ground, poking it with a stick, taking care not to smudge the tracks.
Ron and Hermione were still trying to get their bearings. Teddy was gushing over the photographs. Scorpius wasn't sure what to think yet. He stuck close to Teddy, his eyes round and his mouth open as he took in his fifteen minutes of fame.
"Okay! Sprinkles and marshmallows and brownie and fudge and..."
Harry shrugged modestly. "Well, I wasn't the one singing up there. The real stars of the show are the children."
"I think they've played a mean joke on you," Scorpius bemoaned.
"We have witnesses placing you at the scene."
"Quite a lot." Harry pointed at his lightning scar. "In case you hadn't noticed."
Harry pretended not to notice Draco's gaze from the front gates of the school as he helped his students with their backpacks. He didn't stop Draco from taming his wild hair. When the perfect mug of tea was placed in his hands, he would mumble his thanks.
"See?" Harry smirked knowingly at the Weasleys. "He fits right in."
After much coaxing, Draco sullenly followed his son, Teddy, and Harry through a busy and narrow cobblestone street. The magical shops were bursting with customers, no doubt hunting for last minute presents. He shoved his cold hands into his pockets and watched his feet as he walked on the slick sidewalk. He didn't much care to meet anyone's eye, a habit he had gotten into since after the war. It just wasn't worth the effort.
Harry polished off the drink and leaned forward to place the empty bottle on the table.
"I don't want to hear
"Ah, that can be a problem." Harry knelt down beside Scorpius and pulled his foot forward. "Shall I show you?"
The stew began to sputter, interrupting their conversation. Harry swished his wand at the hob to lower the flames. He got up to give the stew a stir and taste. It was missing a touch of salt. He added a pinch and gave it another stir. "When everything inevitably goes to shit between us-"
The three of them glanced back to where the real Harry Potter stood, looking eerily like a taller version of Teddy's impression, complete with a sour expression and his hands at his hips.
Ginny pulled her legs up onto the couch and flicked through the magazine while Harry cried into his hands as the gravity of the situation kept hitting up to him no matter how far he fled. Draco had been right. He had been selfish, entitled, childish, and so ignorant to not expect things to end this way. He wished he could take it all back. He would use that Time-Turner in a heartbeat. Every time he shut his eyes, he heard a dozen voices telling him he was a mess, asking him what he had been thinking, jeering at him. The worst part of it all was how upset Scorpius had been when he had left the house that day. He had never meant for this.
"NEVER!" Teddy shouted. His arm shot out through the snow pile he was buried in and he grabbed Scorpius by the ankle. Scorpius yelped as his leg was pulled out from under him. He landed with a thump onto the soft ground, hardly getting a moment to grunt before he was being buried in the snow by Teddy's furious digging.
"Where are we going?"
Scorpius clicked his tongue. "I know I'm supposed to eat vegetables to grow big and strong. It's not because I'll turn into a goblin. That's just a fairy tale. Right?"
"Now will you show me your paintings?" Astoria urged.
"-spontaneous."
Draco yanked Harry forward by the shirt before he could finish his gloating. Harry, caught off guard, yelped when he suddenly found himself way too close to Draco and likely due for an oncoming punch. He flinched in anticipation.
"Mhm. I had ice-cream."
Draco hid his face against Harry's shoulder. "He had nightmares last night. I didn't know what to do. I'm fucking useless."
Scorpius pulled at an unraveled thread on Draco's shirt.
"Have you figured it out?"
Harry really wished he could call Hermione.
He got up from his perch on the bench when Harry pulled on his coat and shouldered his messenger bag. "Ready to go?" Harry held out a hand. Scorpius took it without a word. Harry's hand was warm unlike his father's. It wasn't as soft as his father's either. He clutched it tight as they walked out of the school grounds and onto the street. Harry's house was close to school, so he didn't apparate. It was a nice day out, all the ice was melting from the pavement. Scorpius didn't like ice. He had slipped more than a handful of times already this winter season. It wasn't fun.
"Dad?"
Harry's smile faded.
Draco didn't lift a finger to help.
Draco caught the pillow and threw it back at Harry, smacking him straight in the face. "I'll see you around, Potter." He walked away with a smile.
Harry lifted his head. "What?"
The kitchen door flew open with a loud proclamation of, "We've had a spill," followed by, "AAAHHHH!!!!" From Teddy, of course.
be the same as Harry. He was a Malfoy, not some orphan being hidden out of sight. He should be making a fuss like a spoilt Malfoy would. He should be threatening to sue the school. He should be loudly blaming Harry for his bum ankle. He should be raising hell. Harry smirked at the thought of Scorpius raising his voice even the tiniest bit. Seemed impossible.
Scorpius kept his eyes on his teachers. Even though his chest ached from nervousness, it wasn't the same scary feeling as the Christmas pageant. He had tried very hard to grow up since then. He felt a rush of adrenaline, making him giddy somehow. His voice wasn't loud, but he wasn't mouthing the words either. His gestures weren't wild, but he wasn't forgetting them either. He wasn't smiling, but he wasn't crying either. He was concentrating so hard, in fact, that Draco and Astoria could practically see the gears turning in their child's mind. When Draco glanced at Astoria, she seemed to be close to proud tears.
Harry's heart sank when he heard this. "You're welcome," he said. "Of course I have to be nice to you. Imagine what Teddy would do if I wasn't?" Scorpius laughed and nodded in agreement at Harry's exaggerated terrified expression. Harry smiled after and ruffled Scorpius's hair. "You are a very special person, Scorp. Thank you for being nice to me too." He conjured a couple of cups of water as they walked back into the spacious master bedroom. Draco was still fast asleep. Scorpius crawled back into bed and Harry placed the water on the bedside table. "Lights on or off?"
important to him. More important than anything else." Draco patted Scorpius' back. "Have I confused you enough?"
"Ah, no." Draco shook out of his surprise and stepped aside. "It's never a bad time."
Oh, the uproar that statement caused was enormous.
"Yes."
"I'm sorry. I forgot for a while."
"It's okay," Scorpius said with a wise nod. "He's just a little baby. Babies don't know anything yet, so it's okay."
"What will you tell him?" Theo asked. He could barely hide his gleeful smirk.
Yesterday's kiss certainly didn't clear things up for him either.
Harry made an exasperated noise blowing air through his nose. "Shut up."
"Huh?" Harry frowned quizzically. Draco turned his head to the side, motioning for Harry to come along. "Oh, um." Harry stood up as well.
Draco knew Harry knew that meant 'no'.
Scorpius scuffed his foot on the floor and tugged Draco's sleeve. "Last year Harry practiced with me at school, remember?" he hummed.
"Today, at recess, he broke his neck!"
A loud bang snapped Draco out of his dreamless sleep and he bolted upright.
She squeezed Scorpius in her arms. "He's a champ, isn't he? He's changed."
"Is that what's wrong?"
Harry stilled. Here's the reason Draco had asked him to tag along. "What isn't?" he asked and turned to Draco who was perched atop a barrel, wand in hand.
"It doesn't matter
"Good morning," Astoria offered.
"I hear they make for a good roast."
"I could manage," Harry said under his breath, much to Arthur's amusement. After some coaxing, Arthur managed to get his wife to let go of Harry. The two said their goodbyes and left.
"And then what?" Scorpius asked his mother, prompting her to continue with her story that had been interrupted by Harry.
The things he put up withâ€¦ Harry resisted rolling his eyes. "Yes. Hadn't you heard?" He waved his arms around him. "Harry Potterâ€™s Home for Knocked Down Death Eaters." He scowled at Malfoy. "Look, this is between you and me. I don't want anyone to know either. God knows I don't need that kind of trouble." He added, "Besides, you should stay away from your place until you know itâ€™s safe. Iâ€™ll look into it." Logic and survival strategies should work on Malfoy. He was a Slytherin after all. "I don't want your untimely death on my conscience."
"Teddy, you're really good at this," Scorpius beamed.
"Serves them right..."
"Yeah," Scorpius said eagerly.
"You're welcome."
"No, help me understand," Ron interrupted. "Until I know what it is, I won't ever be on your side in this situation."
Scorpius opened his mouth, but he couldn't get his words out.
Draco looked up from his work to find Scorpius standing by the entrance of the study. "Yes?" He put his quill down. It was a chilly Sunday evening. Draco was in the middle of finishing some paperwork, and he hadn't heard from Scorpius since lunch. That wasn't strange for the Malfoys. They liked their solitary time, both of them.
Harry smiled, confused. "Um. Thank you." He took the lunchbox from Scorpius' hands. "You didn't have to do that."
"Why?" Harry glared at the offensive magazine sitting on the coffee table between them. "It's another intrusion into my life. I went to a carnival with Teddy, and I brought Scorpius with me. That's all this is."
At first Draco was so taken aback that he didn't know what to say. If that wasn't the most outrageous thing he had heard... "If you want to show off a trophy, you're barking up the wrong tree."
drawing."
Just for a moment.
Teddy sat up in a flash. "I'm allowed to be alright with him. Got it?"
He swept his hand over the fallen grounds, pushing them onto the floor. "No." He tapped his wand on the kettle. It rose and slowly poured hot water over the coffee in the press in hypnotizing circles.
"Right," Ron replied.
"Would I lie?"
Harry patted Scorpius' back. "I didn't think you were bad. Your parents didn't think you were bad, either."
to..." he echoed.
"Not particularly. I can't skate."
"Alright, show's over." Harry grabbed a dish towel and tossed it over Teddy's head. "What have you spilled?" He ushered the boys out the kitchen, but not before casting a curious look at Draco.
"I have everything going for me. I love my job, I've got a creepy haunted house, I have a family who keeps me overfed, I have you and Teddy. What more could I possibly need?" Now with Teddy gone for almost four months, things would fall back into a routine of teaching, spending evenings at home, and weekends with friends. The summer had been busier than ever for him. With fall approaching, life would calm down.
Draco smirked at Teddy's comments as he resorted to forcefully grabbing Harry's wrist and pressing the tip of his wand against the saucy hand. The skin melded together easily so that not even a faint scar remained. "Twice a month, hmm?"
Harry plucked the wand out of Draco's hands and flicked it once.
Andromeda laughed with him as they followed the crowd of parents exiting the platform. "Whatever will you do when that time comes, Harry?" She shook her head at him. "You're a lost cause."
"Cellar," Draco said. "Want to come?"
up?" Scorpius lamented. "I can't take back what I said. I wish I could, but I just can't."
"We read a lot. Usually he has to work for a bit in the library. And we paint. Or we go outside in the yard and explore if it's not snowing out. When Nanna is here, I go out with her. We go shopping for groceries and she lets me feed the birds at the park. What do you do, Harry?"
The corners of Draco's mouth twitched for just a moment, right as he got up and began clearing the table. "Why do you think you did anything?" He started floating the dishes to the sink.
"Nothing." Harry slid an arm under the pillow and got comfortable. "You may continue."
"Whoa, I'm okay, buddy," Harry rushed to say.
"I think you might want to try a little harder," Patricia suggested lightly. "Clear the air. It was nice having Harry around. Scorpius thought it was nice too."
Harry shifted his weight uncomfortably as he slid his cold hands into his pockets. "Next Friday is the winter pageant. Scorpius told you about that, right?"
Harry examined him for a beat. All those years spent in Hogwarts with Malfoy and he had seen this expression on him once and only once. This defeated, depressed and embarrassed expression had been very apparent on Malfoy's face just before Ron knocked him out with a punch after calling him a 'two-faced bastard'. All those years ago, Harry had reveled in that expression. Malfoy had deserved every bit of humiliation for what he and his family had done. Back then, Harry didn't think twice of leaving the boy to fend for himself in the Battle of Hogwarts.
Ron waited a beat. When Harry didn't continue, he knew why. He prodded with, "Draco has what?"
"Leftovers. It's just leftovers."
The boys wanted to make a snowman. The four of them spent the last of the daylight rolling up snow into the likeness of a snowman, three huge snowballs stacked on top of each other, complete with Teddy's scarf, Scorpius' mittens, pebbles for eyes and a stick for a nose. Satisfied and thoroughly drenched, they headed inside the Malfoy Manor for some well-earned hot chocolate and dinner.
Draco looked at Harry in disbelief. Scorpius had the same look on his face too as he stepped closer to his father's leg.
Draco hadn't realized he would get such a ready response. Not knowing how to react, he said, "Oh."
"What sorts of adventures?"
Draco decided brutal honesty wasn't the way to go in this case. "Everyone's a bit excited right now. That's alright. Excitement gets forgotten soon enough. If anyone says anything to upset you at school, you have to tell me right away."
"Do them up."
The class worked on their alphabets for the first half of the day, which was a chore in itself. Then it was time to get ready for their winter pageant. There was organized chaos in nearly every corner of the room. Gabrielle helped some of them with their costumes while others practiced their singing loud and proud. There was loads of shouting and giggling going on. Harry had a few of the quieter children help him set up the classroom. Scorpius diligently pasted drawings on the wall by the blackboard. He hoped his mother would love his drawings. He had worked quite hard. She had liked everything he had shown her so far. He couldn't wait for her to hear him sing. Gabrielle said he had a lovely singing voice, but he just needed to be louder. He had been practicing in his bathroom where his voice sounded
Harry stepped back and turned away while bringing the bottle of Port wine up, pretending to study it as Theo waltzed in with Scorpius in tow, because he would prefer to be in a spooky cellar with everybody else rather than in the huge manor all alone. "Yeah," the boy echoed loudly. "What's taking you two so long?"
"And has he spoken to you?"
"Me too!" Teddy chimed in as he threw a casual arm over Scorpius' shoulders.
Harry was brushing crumbs off of his hands, having sent the boys off to the dining room to decorate the cookies. He was caught off guard by the question. "No?" He was hesitant because he was unsure if that was the right answer.
Draco tried the thick beefy stew with the slightly undercooked potato and onions. "It's good," he said. He had never imagined himself getting caught up in another serious relationship after going through his disastrous marriage. "I suppose I would tell him if I was certain."
"Just shut up for a second. I need to think-"
Draco didn't know what to say. "What...?" He could cry.
"OF COURSE I'M BEING DEFENSIVE!"
bother her?" he realized with a shock. "Did she say something? I've never-"
"We most certainly are."
"Just an accident," Harry reassured Scorpius. "I was trying to catch one of my boys who took a tumble and I got hurt. People make a big deal when I hurt myself. I didn't break my neck, so don't worry anymore. They mended me in a jiffy. I'm feeling much better now."
"Yes."
"Your father often says silly things, I've noticed."
wanted to say was that he had had a good time and that he wanted to have more sleepovers. But that would be too embarrassing. So he whined instead.
"What are you doing here?" Draco bristled at his ex-wife.
Scorpius was the last one out, purposefully straggling so that no one else was around. Gabrielle was called away, so Harry was left to gift the final present. He smiled warmly as he handed Scorpius the red gift bag, saying, "Have a great holiday, Scorpius."
"What is it?" he asked his friends who were sprawled across the cushions on the floor. "Spit it out."
"Wait." Harry hurried after him. Draco was striding up the narrow stone stairs with purpose, heading straight for the front door. "Malfoy, wait." He grabbed Draco by the arm and forced him to stop. "Where were you last night?" He peered into the pale man's face, trying to make out an answer.
Ginny set the magazine aside and sighed. "What's the plan, Harry?" she asked again.
"No way," Scorpius grumbled what Draco was thinking.
But, before he could move too far, he was jerked forward by the arm and shoved against the wall. The wand was twisted out of his hand, leaving him defenseless. It would be months before anyone found his body. No one would miss him. This was such a pathetic way to die.
"Hmm."
"The pot exploded! It's not my fault!"
"No... You told me your teacher's name is
"It didn't cost me anything!" Ginny answered cheerily. "I got it at the World Cup. I want you to have it."
"Hmm."
After he had explored for a good while, he went down to Harry and they raided Teddy's library. They took lots of picture books with them. Scorpius sat on the couch with the books beside him and one open on his lap. Harry was sitting beside him against the arm of the couch with his legs crossed, reading his own grown-up book. Scorpius thought Harry looked very funny when he was reading. The man sat hunched over with a hand pushed into his cheek and the other holding the pages down. His hair fell over his eyes and he would brush it away every few minutes. When his back ached, he would sit up and arch it with a quiet groan before going back to hunching over.
Draco waited a moment for him to speak. Harry didn't. So Draco prompted, "Is that what you meant?"
"What? No gratitude?"
Harry hid his smile.
Harry didn't say.
Harry fiddled with the strap of his messenger bag. "Sorry, I was hoping to meet with you at school, but you never-"
Harry turned away from his conversation with George to find Ginny at the stairs, beckoning him up. He tried to wave her off, because George was fascinating him with a marvelous new invention in the Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes â€“ a jewel pouch that dispensed miniature dancing pixies who would nick any knut-sized shiny object in plain sight. He felt a hand grabbing his collar from behind and he had no choice but to stagger up the stairs, much to the amusement of the handful of people who witnessed this.
"It always is a simple misunderstanding."
Teddy stopped his yammering when he felt Harry jerk in his sleep. He tried to shake Harry awake. "Wake up?" Harry kept sleeping. "Well, if you were so tired, you shouldn't have come over." Teddy eased a thin sheet over his godfather and tucked him in.
Scorpius fiddled with the bag in his hands. "Mum and I might go visit the ice castles one day. And... and maybe if it snows, we'll play outside with Dad?"
Draco stifled a sigh. That had been cathartic. He sat down on the stiff chair, exhausted and troubled. He pushed down the wave of guilt building up in him. Harry deserved to hear every word of that. This was his fault, all of this. Surely.
"How sorry?"
Harry snatched the fallen parchment off the ground. "Why are you opening my mail?" He grabbed the rest of the Christmas correspondences out of Teddy's grasp. "What are you on about?" He glared at the elegant handwriting in the highly offensive letter Teddy wanted nothing to do with. His expression softened when he recognized the script. "Oh." It was from Draco.
"Oh dear," Astoria sniffed. Draco had a handkerchief ready for her and she snatched it without another word to quickly dab her overflowing eyes.
"Whoa, wait just a minute," Harry interrupted, holding up his hands. "I was just... I was making conversation."
"I'm sure it does." Draco finally bumped against a lantern on the table and started struggling to light it.
"Yes?"
Draco returned his attention to the dishes, swishing his wand to clean them while his mind continued to wander as it had last night and this morning. He had been lying. Potter
"Do you like ice?" he asked Harry.
"I need a tie."
"What do you want me to do about it?"
"Okay?" Harry urged.
"Yes."
No, he didn't like that.
Harry walked them into his favourite busy pub and got a spot almost at once, being the celebrity he was. They ended up in a booth by the window. Teddy and Scorpius sat near the glass while Harry and Draco took the aisle. The boys stared out at all the sparkling holiday decorations and crowd in fascination, letting their breaths fog up the glass and then using their sleeves to wipe it off when they couldn't see outside any longer. Harry and Draco kept their gazes on the menus. Scorpius let his father order for him without fussing. He was sure that he would like
Once again there was silence. Harry might have asked the question more for his sake than anything else. He drew distracted lines on Draco, his fingers moving over pale skin in time with the pulse. This was something that had been on his mind for a while now.
," he added, "she plays Quidditch for the... Ho-Holeye... Holeyeheed Harps. She plays for the Holeyeheed Harps."
The two boys nearly jumped out of their skin when a loud shatter echoed through the house.
"I'll let Scorpius get a piece of it," Draco corrected Theo. "I don't want
"Don't be crass." What a mess. Draco felt filthy. With good reason too. He looked down at his white button-down shirt that was streaked with dust and grime. What the hell was Potter up to all day? Literally rolling around in this grubby house in his spare time? In fifteen minutes, Draco would have to sit down for dinner with his son, pretend to be perfectly normal. This was not something a normal person did.
Harry and Scorpius stayed up for a while. Harry had brought over some homework from the Year 1 teacher and Scorpius was
"I suppose even teachers can go wild when they're on summer break."
At some point, he remembered Draco stooping down over him and asking if he wanted supper. He must have answered no because the next thing he saw when he opened his eyes was darkness. The sun had set. He looked out the windows in some confusion before lifting his gaze up at Draco, who had woken him.
Harry was dismayed. What was that supposed to mean? "Why shouldn't I be nice to you?" he asked.
Brunch was ready less than an hour later and all the sweaty, grass-stained children swarmed the large table Arthur had set up outside in the yard. Teddy, being the mature lad he was, knew that Scorpius would be comfortable if he sat next to Harry, so the young Malfoy found himself wedged between his cousin and his teacher, feeling happy as a peach to be where he was. The food in front of him looked incredible and smelt delicious. His stomach rumbled, but it was hardly heard over all the rambunctious chatter going on around him. From what he had learnt so far, the Weasleys met at least once every two months for such occasions. They celebrated birthdays, anniversaries, and promotions as a big family this way. That was why there were at least three cakes spread across the table in addition to pancakes, syrup, fruits, eggs, cheese, and sausages. Scorpius could just barely see over the big bowl of hash browns from where he sat. He let Harry fill up his plate for him, not saying a word even though he knew he would have a tough time finishing everything on that plate.
"Thank you," he said shyly after accepting the flower.
Astoria frowned back at him. "Because I know you'd just complain that it wasn't brewed right."
doing
Draco did. "It's what I've been expecting."
What, exactly, did Potter want with them?
Draco was confused. "What?"
"That's a relief," Draco grumbled. He was sitting in the library with his work piled up in front of him. His head ached, his nose was stuffy, his throat was sandy, and he felt awful. It didn't help that stupid Potter was sitting across from him with a stupid patronizing grin on his stupid smug face. "Go away."
Harry rubbed the back of his neck when he saw horror wash over Malfoy's face. He had figured as much. He shrugged and said, "I'm just as surprised as you are."
Harry held up his thumb, showing the blue icing that he had brushed off of Draco's ear. "Did you help too?" he asked with a smile.
"Spent Christmas with Potter, did you?"
It became abundantly obvious to Harry that Draco was being obtuse on purpose, so he responded with an unimpressed glare, which made Draco laugh. "Forget it," Harry grumbled.
scoops," Scorpius demanded.
Scorpius, who was now seated between Theo and Draco, raised his hand.
"Scorpius was so excited when he met Teddy a few months ago, so happy to have a big brother, he said." Astoria smiled wistfully. "I am truly glad for everything you have done for him, Harry. You didn't have to, but you did. And now that school is almost over, I think Scorpius will be sad to leave your class."
Scorpius' smile quickly turned into a scowl. "Well, if you don't want it, I'll take it." He snatched the note out of Draco's hand.
"Oh..."
"Yeah, right." Scorpius scoffed. Highly unlikely. "Do you think I'll get to see Teddy for Christmas?"
"Did you see me?" Scorpius asked excitedly. "What did you think, Harry?" He dismounted from his Firebolt, but kept bouncing on the balls of his feet. He couldn't believe he had accomplished such a maneuver.
"First the graham cracker," Teddy said, "then the chocolate, then the marshmallow."
"Nothing. It's inevitable."
"You're staring."
Harry shrugged modestly and answered, "I suppose."
"You don't have any money."
And so the two Malfoys began setting the table for dinner. Scorpius was spacing out the fork from the knife evenly while Draco folded the napkins, watching his son for a few moments. The kid was impossible. "Hey."
Harry poured a healthy cup for the both of them and then lined up two pieces of bread on each plate.He gestured for Scorpius to hop up onto the bench at the dining table. Scorpius narrowed his eyes at the empty slices of bread. Maybe Harry didn't know how to make sandwichesâ€¦
"You also need Harry to grow up."
"Of course," said Draco with an affected sniff.
Draco glanced into the classroom to find Astoria and Scorpius standing in front of the window. "Want to meet Stori?"
Harry could tell that Scorpius had immense reservations. At his age, Teddy would have jumped at the chance to have a play date with anyone who would have him, by hook or by crook. In fact, Teddy had run away that one time because Andromeda had told him no to a sleepover, much to Harry's fright. But Scorpius was nothing like Teddy.
"Teddy!" Scorpius exclaimed and took a running leap at his cousin. "Yay!"
know how to get under my skin," Harry muttered. Teddy was already at the top of the hill, clutching his stomach and laughing at the scene he was privy to. "I don't want either of you whining for the next two hours. Got it?"
Harry checked the time on his watch. "We should get going, actually," he told her apologetically. "We need to be at the Burrow before eleven."
Teddy shifted into a defensive stance, his hands at his hips and feet planted squarely on the rug. "I thought you two weren't going out anymore," he retorted.
"Go home? How can I go home when you're like this?" Ron could hardly believe his eyes. "A kid fell on you and you're in
Harry faltered. "What?"
"It doesn't help the matter."
"Yes, please," Scorpius said even though he didn't like to drink milk. He was trying to make a good impression.
Harry was caught off-guard by the innocent question and tried to think up an appropriate response in the spur of the moment. "We... uh-" He glanced at Gabrielle.
"Take him to the Healer tomorrow. Both of you need to go. I'm sure they'll give him something for his throat. I'll stop by after school, check in on you."
Draco had figured as much. Again, no skin off his back, he thought to himself. Or maybe he lied to himself.
The men jumped when they heard Scorpius yell, "DAD!"
to his classmates?! All I am trying to do is bring him out of his shell and all you are doing is pushing him back in. I don't care about your misery. But don't you dare make him miserable with you. You say I have no right?! Well, I
Scorpius chewed on the side of his cheek while dutifully letting his father wash all the way up to his shoulders, even though the toad didn't go up his sleeves. "I'm sorry," he mumbled.
"Isn't it easier that way?"
"Really?" Scorpius gawked at Theo. "I didn't know you climbed mountains."
Harry froze while trying hard to wipe a guilty expression off his face. "I wasn't going anywhere," he said, lying through his teeth.
Teddy picked one out of his collection. "It's a Muggle picture book, so it doesn't move. Harry gets them for me. He used to read them when he was kid, you know? He would steal them from Dudley's bookshelf." He sat on the furry rug and pulled Scorpius down with him. "I especially like the superhero ones. Do you like superheros? My favorite is Spiderman."
"Ask me tomorrow."
Draco shrugged as he walked over to inspect the stew bubbling away in the pot on the hob. "No one was home. Scorpius has a play date."
"Of course."
"Okay. I will eat a sandwich with you."
"Do you love me more than anything?" Scorpius asked.
Scorpius huffed.
"Teddy. Edward Lupin. Andromeda's grandson?"
"As you should be. What are you doing for the year-end pageant this year? Singing again?"
"He did!" Scorpius said before Draco could speak. "He helped!"
"It's been interesting," Harry said abruptly. "Scorpius and Teddy get along. Then again, Teddy gets along with everyone. When I brought Scorpius to the Burrow, I was nervous. But they took him along with them the whole day. And now I've been teaching Scorp to fly. He got a new broom a month ago. So... it's been interesting." He dropped his gaze to his scone and started to spread jam on it.
Harry had much to be preoccupied with. Ginny was right, he didn't often keep secrets these days. And this one was a whopper of a secret.
"Shut up, Potter."
"Because." Harry stretched his arms above him and yawned. They were in his bedroom at 12 Grimmauld Place, and they had been up to no good. Sleep felt great. He had been in the middle of a marvelous dream when he had been rudely awoken. "Listen."
"Harry, are you... um..." Hermione trailed off, gesturing vaguely instead of finishing her question.
Harry sipped on the hot beverage with relish. "Sorry about yesterday," he apologized. The smell of coffee started to perk him up. "I don't drink very often." He got up to his feet gingerly, his head still swirling. "Did I do anything stupid?"
Now there they were, five years later, in the manor surrounded by books, toys, and drawings. They never reconciled their marital differences, but they did bond over their beautiful son. Scorpius stayed with Draco, Astoria was free to pursue her life. She would fly back a few times a year to spoil Scorpius rotten. Theirs wasn't a typical family life, but it worked. At least for now, it worked. Scorpius had fallen asleep in Astoria's arms, as he often did when they were together. He held very still when he slept. He was the sweetest boy any mother could ask for. She watched him sleep for a long while, cradled against her safe and sound. He tried so hard, bless his little heart. Astoria kissed his hair for the hundredth time that night. Then she looked up at Draco properly.
"Hmph... You always look so sad," Scorpius frowned.
Draco searched Harry's expression to try to discern what he was actually trying to say. Before Draco to read into it, Scorpius asked, "Can my father come too? He can play with us, right? He's really good."
Is this enough or is there more?
helpful," he stated firmly. "Thank you."
Draco clicked his tongue in defeat. "It's okay, Scorpius." He had most certainly overreacted, but he would rather overreact than have a boy with warty hands running amok in his home. "You need to be careful picking around in the dirt. You never know what kind of diseases are around."
Draco still didn't lift his eyes, but the filet did topple over, crispy skin down, over the rice. Scorpius didn't reveal his sly smile. He knew exactly what he was doing. Just a bit more. "I practice on my own all the time, but my teacher says it helps to have someone listen. Then I won't get as nervous," he explained. "I want to be even better than I was as last year's pageant. This time Harry can't help me like he did last time. I'm 'lacking confidence', my teacher says-"
Astoria said, "Of course, I could tell! Harry has been teaching you well, hasn't he?"
"What's so cool about him?"
"Ah." She nodded a few times with a smirk. "A peace offering. He's too sweet for words." She popped the top off the container to get a better look at the jam sandwich. "Are you going to eat it?"
"I just think that if you're feeling bad or sad, you should tell someone instead of keeping it in. Sure, I cry when I'm sad. Besides, it's fun when everyone's being
"You and me," Draco clarified.
"You promise?"
. Like, the Unforgivable Curses. They've almost gotten themselves killed too. Can you believe it? Harry's the coolest godfather ever, Scorpius. He's the best wizard in all of history."
"Even if Scorpius would get stuck in the middle?"
Having these bizarre conversations with Draco was thrilling for Harry. It was a thrill he rarely felt, and he was both unnerved and intrigued enough to keep at it. He took a few steps forward, stopping in front of Draco. "No," he said, "I've never been with a man."
Rose wiggled off of Fleur's lap as soon as she got bored and scurried under the table to the other side, peering up at Harry and Scorpius with an impish grin. The children seemed to do that often â€“ get out of their seats and run around to visit different adults around the table. Rose was one of the few who could fit under the table. Harry helped her out of there and sat her on his lap. She immediately turned to the strange face beside her and said, "Hello."
"Inside voice."
"I know it's not poison," Scorpius said under his breath as he took a piece of rough candy out of the bag. It was colored pale blue and felt warm to the touch. He popped it in his mouth and let his tongue get accustomed to the taste.
"Don't you want your dad to teach you?"
It wasn't easy, not for Draco. "Have you ever taken Veritaserum?" he asked.
"AH!" Teddy staggered back. The magazine dropped from his hands and fluttered to the ground dramatically. He pointed an accusatory finger at Harry and Draco. "Y-you-you-y-you-you-you're-you're
Scorpius opened his mouth and pushed his tongue against his bottom row of teeth. The lower incisors started wiggling.
Harry let out a loud sigh. "Do you think you should be seen at St. Mungo's?" he tried again. That was an innocuous enough question. Malfoy shook his head. Harry wanted to insist that he go because he was definitely not confident in his first-aid skills. But if Malfoy was feeling alright, who was he to argue? "Right thenâ€¦" He drummed his fingers on the table. He had done everything he could do, he figured. "You can go home, if you want?"
Draco shook his head. Impossible. "Trust me, Potter. She is not your type."
"No. But he wouldn't care."
"Can you teach me?"
"Holyhead Harpies."
"-just that you need to let him be a brat once in-"
"Are you deliberately attempting to provoke me, Potter?"
Scorpius' words had gotten to him after all.
Harry had caught up to him by then, panting from the exertion of pushing his broom. "I think that's cheating," he said while catching his breath. He meant the fancy Japanese broom pitted against his nearly twenty-year-old relic.
Harry had passed out in bed not a minute later.
Harry waved him off. "How about a nice stroll outside? Get some fresh air?" he proposed.
"Of course he did."
Harry smirked when he saw Draco freeze. "Bye, Scorpius."
Draco had been having a bizarre few weeks. After suddenly being thrust into the public light once again after years of hiding, he had been expecting picketing at the gates, angry graffiti on the walls, mobs even. That was how it had been after the war. He had been expecting his life to be mayhem. However, none of that transpired in the aftermath of the Witch Weekly article. Work was much the same except that none of his coworkers or clients met his eye. Everyone quit talking as soon as he walked into the room. And, once ignored on the streets, he now received many double-takes and puzzled stares. But there was no vulgar confrontation with strangers or badgering from reporters.
Harry bowled over with laughter.
"GAH!" he screamed when he ran headfirst into Ginny, who seemed to have materialized out of thin air into his living room. "What the hell are you doing here?!"
Harry smiled. He knew Draco's feelings about his 'celebrity status'. Not interested. "You could have just used magic," he said once the tie was fastened on him. He tilted his chin down to meet Draco's eye.
But, four hours into her contractions, she was sobbing for him. Screaming for him.
Draco kissed Harry's cold lips.
Draco was standing by the door, leaning against the jamb, arms folded at his chest, watching Harry go through a minor existential crisis.
Draco snatched the bottles away. "I think you've had enough to drink."
"In fact, why are you still here?"
Scorpius whined and fluttered his heavy eyes open. "Dad?"
Ginny looked up at Harry and asked, "You're happy, aren't you?"
Teddy nodded big. "Oh, yeah. He's definitely a Slytherin. No doubt about that. A better Slytherin than his father too."
"I did." Scorpius sat up as well and wiped the side of his mouth before smacking his tongue to the roof of his mouth.
"You've turned his life upside down-"
things," Draco corrected Harry. "He's still entitled."
Scorpius was amazed. "Really? What did he say?"
"Say, are you picking up Scorpius from school today?"
"I do."
"Dad!"
"No one asked you, Vicky," Teddy barked.
On the day Astoria went into labor, she refused to call Draco. She couldn't stand looking at him, not for another second. She had deluded herself in thinking that they would have a happy marriage. She hated him for what he was making her go through, with this child. He didn't deserve her.
"You should come with me, Dad. We'll meet Teddy together."
"Oh, so you're drawing these for your mother?"
Draco snapped out of his midday reverie. He snatched his hand back.
"I'll see you then, Scorpius."
"No, he already left. He said not to bother you." Scorpius rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "Are you still angry with him?"
He was yanked back without warning. "Stay." Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's waist and pulled him into an embrace. Harry felt a steady drumming at his back, fingers twisting his shirt, radiating heat enveloping him, a shiver fluttering through him, his resolve weakening as he tilted his head to the side to let Draco's lips glide over his neck and up to his ear.
"You know, for not knowing he existed," Harry explained.
Scorpius nodded in understanding. "You're
"Hello!" Teddy Lupin crowed. He grabbed Scorpius by the elbow and pulled him into the house. "Let's go upstairs." Scorpius looked back pleadingly at his father, but Teddy was already dragging him up the steps, leaving Draco and Harry alone in the foyer.
"Be that as it may..." Harry didn't let the comment provoke him, because he was in a rather good mood today. "Instead of concerning myself with what others might be saying or my own expectations, I want to think about what you might be feeling. Because maybe I haven't been letting things happen, but rather making things happen."
"They're exchanging letters now, I believe."
"Fine by us," Theo decided. "We will see you in an hour." Pleased with himself, he turned to the Malfoys. "Shall we be off?" Then he tsked at Scorpius. "Why aren't you zipped up?" He knelt down to zip up Scorpius' coat and force mittens and a cap on him, despite the boy's loud protests.
By six, Malfoy Manor was bustling with conversation, laughter, and clinks of cutlery. Theo was a conversationalist who quite enjoyed talking about his favourite topic of interest - himself.
He steeled himself with a hand at the doorknob. Damn Astoria and her sly remarks. He opened the door.
Harry waited. Scorpius didn't move to leave like the rest of the children had the moment they had received their first present of the season. Instead, he seemed as though he wanted to say something more. But he kept his eyes on his shoes, evidently second-guessing himself. "What's up?" Harry prompted.
Harry kept his hand on the Firebolt to reassure Scorpius that he would be fine. "How about a quick flight around those trees?" he asked, pointing at the large poplars ahead of them.
"In the drawing room."
"Lie down," Draco told him. They were in the living room. "You might feel better."
Harry simpered at Draco to gloat before graciously bowing to Scorpius. "Thank you, thank you." He straightened up. "I have a ball to attend tonight."
He had to look his best for his mother. He had already laid out all his schoolwork on the dining table in the right order. His father didn't help one bit. Scorpius knew that Draco didn't like all the fuss. But his mother was coming to visit, so he wanted to fuss as much as he could. He made sure his room was tidy and that his playthings were put away in the right shelves. He had his books ready to show Astoria how well he could read now. He even cleaned the living room, fluffing up pillows and making sure everything was straight.
The kitchen door swung open, Astoria poked her head in, and found Harry and Draco where she had left them, the former looking at her expectantly and the latter apparently having seen a ghost. She ignored Draco's dramatics, didn't even bat an eye, and asked Harry, "When do you and Teddy have to leave? Scorpius asked if there's time for a play in the snow."
"He is not a distraction," Draco snapped.
"Just imagine the clout. 'Endorsed by Harry Potter'," Theo declared. "We could make a killing-"
"Dad! Why are you always mean?" Scorpius lamented. "This is why nobody likes you!"
When Draco brought up the uncomfortable conversation with Harry, he wasn't expecting a laugh and a ready solution.
"That sounds delicious!" Harry gushed.
nervous too. Next time, all four of us can practice together. We'll try something different next time. There's always a next time, buddy. And you will get better and better."
Scorpius closed his eyes and went over the argument he had heard in the classroom, even behind closed doors. He didn't understand what was happening. He had
"Malfoy."
He had wanted to do this for so long.
said he wasn't allowed to see his cousin. What are you insinuating?"
"Mount Kilimanjaro. That's very impressive." Harry nodded in appreciation. "You must have trained a bit before that climb. I've heard the altitude changes are nothing to balk at."
doing?"
glad for it. He had been worried that he would fall behind, although it would be quite hard to fall behind in a Year 1 class. As they ate dinner together, Harry told him how children often get sick this time of year. Flu season, he said. All of them had to keep washing their hands and covering their coughs to make sure they weren't spreading germs. Scorpius felt a bit embarrassed as he wondered whether he had gotten his friends sick.
"He's looked past Malfoy's history, hasn't he?" Victoire reasoned. "And if he thinks Draco Malfoy has turned over a new page, reformed, become a productive member of society, I'm sure he has valid reasons."
Draco finally resorted to pinching Scorpius' nose to keep him quiet. "Go to sleep."
His attention now turned to Astoria. At the start of the day, she had been the picture of elegance, her blonde curls hanging by her shoulders, wearing a pale blue skirt with a thin white blouse, inconvenient white heels, and done up with some breezy makeup. Now, a couple of hours later, her hair was plopped up in a messy bun atop her head because the sun and sweat had frizzed it, freckles showing through faded powder, she was sipping on a drink from a bright pink crazy straw, and barefoot because she kept twisting her ankles on the soft grass. Never would Draco have imagined Astoria wearing a party hat and enormous green sunglasses that flashed yellow whenever someone shrieked. "Wow," was all he could say.
"I already know Scorpius," Harry said with a grin. "You don't have to fret about introducing me to him."
He looked up from his workbook to find Harry kneeling beside him, looking quite serious.
Scorpius nodded solemnly. He took in Harry's incapacitated arm and bruised eye. He finally convinced himself that Harry was going to alright. "What happened at school today?"
When asked to comment on Harry's plight, Draco's response was, "He's too ugly."
"Think of Teddy, what he's got to go through at Hogwarts," Ron interjected. "Those kids are ruthless. You know that better than anyone else. Would you sit back and watch if Ginny did something like this?"
Ron handed Harry a mug of hot cider and sat opposite him on the long dining table in the middle of the bustling activity. "Looks like we're starting holiday celebrations early this year."
"When I get home, I'll have lots of chocolate ice-cream."
Draco made his way back to the kitchen after gesturing at Harry to follow him, and asked, "How was he?"
"All everyone's asking is what Draco Malfoy's like, Teddy." Victoire smiled sweetly.
Winter break meant no school for ten days. Harry and Gabrielle sent the children on their way with little goodie bags filled with cookies and small presents, wishing them 'Happy Holidays'. The kids were excited to have time off from school. Bundled in their winter clothes, they skipped away, chattering among themselves and saying their goodbyes until the New Year.
"I don't
"And you're not pitching in my house."
"And what's the right impression?"
Scorpius didn't know how to respond to that. Teddy laid the book on Scorpius' lap. Scorpius picked it up and held it as though it was the most precious thing. "Thank you."
He stared out the window at the upside down rain. Ridiculous.
As Draco watched the three of them squabble, he thought back to a few years ago, when the holidays were a quiet and happy affair. Astoria would put soft music on and the manor would be dressed in the most elegant ornaments and garlands. Scorpius would be sticking close to her, helping her primp the tree or carry mugs of hot cocoa precariously. Draco never participated in the decorating. He knew he never did it the way Astoria wanted it to be done, so it was better left untouched. He simply enjoyed the way his son lit up during Christmas - in anticipation of the presents, spending time walking in the snow, lazing in front of a sweet-smelling fire, and falling asleep after feasts for lunch and dinner.
"How did you expect it to end?"
"I didn't intend to drag you into all this, Ted," Harry said quietly.
Draco kept his eyes on the grand staircase. "Is he-"
"What are you talking about?" Draco retorted.
They sat in silence for a moment, although the greenhouse itself was anything but. Chirps, croaks, snorts, rustling, squelching, squawking-
"Down for a visit?" Harry asked Theo.
"Sure, but I won't fault you."
"Shwell!" Scorpius had already stuck one end of the candy cane in his mouth. "May I have two more, pleash?" He held out his hand again. "For Mum and Dad."
Draco had half a mind to walk out of there, fed up with whatever game Potter was playing. He didn't want tea. But accepting defeat wasn't in his blood. He stalked forward instead, grabbed the cup none too gently, then tossed its contents into the sink. "I prefer coffee," he muttered while filling the kettle with boiling water. After that confrontation in the study, his thoughts had been a mess. It made his actions frantic as he spilled some freshly ground coffee beans on the marble countertop. Just an absolute mess.
Back in the great room, Scorpius had snuck in without making a sound. Draco caught him looking intently at The Quibbler that Theo had conveniently left behind on the coffee table. Draco walked over and picked up the magazine off the table, startling Scorpius. The boy nearly jumped out of his skin and attempted to wipe the guilty look off his face. "Bed." Draco motioned for Scorpius to scurry along.
"Dad says they're silly, but I like them. I like stars."
"Definitely not."
Draco couldn't get that drunken proclamation out of his head. It was irritating, Potter living in his fantasy where everything was perfect, the past was the past, nothing bleeding into the present or the future. Good people? Him? In what sane world?
Harry pushed off the wall and strolled over to Scorpius as nonchalantly as possible. "Hey, buddy."
Scorpius perked up when he heard the passing whisper. He was eating his snack in the mess hall with his friends and whoever had spoken was sitting at the table behind him. He was used to listening in on other people's conversations. It's how he gathered most of the gossip in the school. He knew all about how pretty nine-year-old Lacey twisted Pip's nose because he was bullying her, and then kissed his cheek by the back of the school, much to her admirer's elation. He knew Margaret's friends were planning a sleepover with popcorn and sweets. He knew what sort of pranks were going to be played on Mr. McGillis, the meanest teacher in the whole wide world.
His eyes fluttered open as he fell out of the maze.
"I can't wait for tomorrow!" Scorpius exclaimed as he snuggled into bed. Tomorrow would be the first day of 'real school'. He would see his friends and tell them all about his summer. He was looking forward to hearing about their adventures too. He beamed up at Draco. "I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight. This is all too much!"
Scorpius wailed even louder and brought his balled fists down, repeatedly banging them against his knees. "I don't like you," he sobbed. "I'm hurt and you're being mean and you're supposed to be
These feelings had built up gradually, so slowly that Harry didn't even realize anything had changed until it was too late. Sitting together under the large oak tree after Scorpius' first flight, near enough to see the faint crinkles at the corner of his eye, worrying his lip with barely masked concern, pale fingers flipping through a page of the book that he clearly wasn't reading, a faint scent of cologne wafting in the autumn breeze, that was when Harry was struck with an intense clarity. In the library that same day, the Dark Mark didn't have quite the same impact on Harry as the feel of Draco's wrist in his hand. His skin was soft and cold. And, after lunch, when Draco angrily poured the tea down the drain, Harry had been surprised by a twinge in his chest, something akin to... fondness?
At lunch, Scorpius wanted to know all about Harry becoming the youngest Seeker at Hogwarts, flying around on a cursed broomstick, chased by Dementors. He was enthralled with the stories of elusive Snitches and rogue Bludgers. He couldn't believe how such a dangerous sport could be played in school, of all places, but he couldn't wait to try it out. "Harry," he said, "are you famous?"
"Yes!"
Harry didn't know what to say. He cradled the bird figurine in his palm, studying the intricate feathers, gleaming sheen, and stunning beauty of a Snidget. "It's so... I mean..." He gasped as a sudden thought occurred to him. "How much did this cost?! Are you insane?!"
"You can go home, Potter."
"No, that's what you have to look at." Scorpius knelt down and carefully began doing up his laces, crossing them over, pulling one end under the other, making loops and twisting them together into a pretty bow. "I did it." He beamed up at Draco, waiting to be praised.
one," he said, pointing at Harry's star.
"There was no plan."
Molly and Arthur sat beside each other, their lips pursed into a thin line, and they let their children argue with Harry. Percy, Bill and Ron were the most vocal. Hermione tried to mediate the 'conversation', but that generally meant yelling over belligerent comments. "You have reporters hounding you day and night," Percy exclaimed. "How else are you going to stop them? Classic formula is to issue a public apology. They get what they want and this fiasco is brushed under the rug. I can arrange-"
"Ah, so he doesn't like me much." Draco rubbed the back of his neck. "Not too obvious, no. He was acting strangely yesterday around me. He hardly spoke to me. Which is very unusual for him. He is usually talking my ear off."
"Potter's teaching Scorpius. That's all," Draco told him.
"You would think so, won't you? And then you try to go to the loo, slipping and sliding your way out of the banquet hall," Astoria said. The boys cracked up. "My heels were this tall." She moved her hands apart an exaggerated ten inches. "Can you imagine?"
"It was too late then too." Astoria finished sipping the last of the wine and set the empty glass on the parapet. "No matter how much we talked or tried, I think it was too late then too. And that's okay." She turned to face him, draping her arms over his shoulders. "I never imagined my life at thirty to be like this - a mother, divorced, spending months abroad, writing. I never imagined this, but now I can't imagine
He shuffled forward, still blinking away the sleep from his eyes. He sidled past the huddled figure to get to the open door where the storm raged outside. He gripped the door jamb and peered at the dimly lit street. Empty. The torrential downpour had caused rivulets to run beside and around the gutters. A person would be mad to get caught in this unusual storm. There seemed to be no sign of the rain letting up either. He stepped back and shut the front door, muffling the pitter-patter of raindrops behind it.
Patricia looked back again, this time to make sure it was just the two of them in the room. Then she turned around to face Scorpius as she sat down on the edge of his bed. She beckoned him forward. Once they were huddled close, she whispered, "I'll tell you a secret."
Scorpius furrowed his brows at Harry. "That wouldn't make sense."
Harry walked up to the table by the window, peeking over his students' heads to look at some drawings. There really was no structure to this assignment, of course. It was simply to gauge each student's level. He noticed that many of the children just scribbled on the paper with no purpose while others tried to impress each other and their teachers with their grown-up painting skills.
