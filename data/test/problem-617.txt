The healer took one glance at the injury and promptly asked about the treatment they’d already applied. Draco answered her succinctly, naming the potions he’d used.
They climbed into bed together, Harry laying on his back and Draco curled up against his side. It was still early evening, the sun shining bright and hot through the windows. But Harry’s foot needed to heal and they needed to rest before their dinner tonight. Draco gulped. This would be an important event and they couldn’t screw it up.
Heart beating fast and stomach fluttering, Harry pulled out the oysters from his bag— including the one he had specially prepared.
He said this, but Harry saw the way Draco was fussing with his hair and, was that makeup? His cheekbones did seem to be sparkling a bit.
“Why are you asking me? You’re the one who wanted to catch them in the first place,” Draco replied, exasperated.
“Mhmmm. Not as good as yours, I think. You were out like a light after lunch. Just like a baby,” Draco teased.
“Well, I suppose I’ll just have to find another fit celebrity to advertise my newest invention,” Draco said. “In the meantime, however…”, he quickly whipped out his wand, “The crabs are waiting.”
“And the loser has to wear a t-shirt that says ‘My Boyfriend Is Sexier’ to the Quidditch Cup Finals,” Draco decided.
In a swift motion, Draco swung his leg over Harry and reached up to pin Harry’s hands down. With his other hand, he slid down to the base of Harry’s shirt, slowly pushing the fabric up to his chest. As Draco’s hands grazed over his stomach, Harry arched his back with a sharp inhale.
“Elke, you’re drinking a margarita right now,” replied another girl. So, the first girl is called Elke?
“Well, alright then. Now that we’re finally alone. Spill. How many drinks did you get?” Draco asked, suddenly all business.
“Ah, what do we have here? Is this just for me? Why, I’m flattered,” Draco’s voice lowered in pitch and took on a firm tone, “I suppose I’ll reward you for being such a good boy.”
“Everything you do impresses me, Draco,” Harry responded, sounding heart-wrenchingly sincere. Of course, he had to ruin it by adding, “But you’re right, the crab castle is one of your better ideas. Loads better than the talking watch.”
Lips roamed to Harry’s cheek and to his ear. The warmth of Draco’s breath tickled him as he kept kissing.
The German girls had firmly latched onto his status as a bread baker and the people at the resort now referred to him as Mr. Baker. Even Antonello and Luca, who he’d introduced himself to beforehand, called him by his new nickname. Harry felt like he was shedding his old identity as The Boy Who Lived and rapidly becoming Mr. Baker— the resort’s favorite boy toy. He’d drunk three margaritas and four fruity cocktails that he couldn’t name but tasted delicious.
It was Draco and his damn tongue, running up Harry’s chest. Leaving the gentlest kisses as he traveled up. But they were slow and wet, and Draco watched Harry melt in his hands. When Draco stopped and came back to his face, Harry shook his head.
The hotel muffins didn’t beat his, but they were still moist, chocolatey, and delicious— just like a muffin should be.
“Of course, love. You know I will,” Draco choked out. He reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a small velvet box, “You are such a fucking prick though. I can’t believe you stole my elaborately planned proposal.” He opened the box and held it out towards Harry, who was still bent at the knee.
It was mid-afternoon, the sun was beaming hotter than ever, and the pair finally spent some quality time amongst the warm, salty waves. There were teeny little sardines swimming around them and Harry kept trying to catch one with his hands— he had been unsuccessful so far.
Harry grinned at him and Draco couldn’t help but return the smile. Harry had never been to the beach before. He had never gone on holiday. He had never even had a real childhood. Draco was determined to bring as much joy into Harry’s life as he possibly could, whatever it took. Even if it involved crabs.
“Please kiss me,” Harry said, squirming under Draco’s touch. All the teasing was clearly driving him insane.
“Merlin’s fucking balls, Harry. He’s buying from me because of my superb business sense and negotiation skills, not to mention Malfoy Tech’s sterling reputation,” Draco responded, indignant. He then sighed in resignation, “However, he’s likely buying ten-thousand without having even seen the product first hand because of my nipples, yes. And the mimosas.”
“But what if both your hands are busy? What if you’re blind? What if you’re paralyzed? What if you’re brewing an extremely finicky potion which requires you to add an ingredient at precisely the right time, and just as the clock is ticking your neck cramps up? The potion would be ruined! Someone’s life could be hanging in the balance!” He grabbed both of Harry’s shoulders to emphasize his point, “The talking watch can change everything, Harry.”
The sun had gone down by the time Harry woke up from his nap. He felt extremely relaxed and he had a really fun time at the pool that afternoon, but he was still a bit disappointed that he hadn’t been able to swim with his boyfriend. He supposed they had the rest of the week for that. As his thoughts wandered to the small velvet box in his mokeskin pouch, he frowned. Today’s antics had not been very conducive to an unforgettably romantic proposal. He was determined to do a brilliant job because Draco deserved nothing but Harry’s absolute best effort. Tomorrow, he would definitely do it. Then they would spend the rest of the week celebrating. It was perfect timing— he just had to gather up the courage to actually go through with it.
“Umm, I sort of had this custom made. It has a bunch of enchantments on it, both for your safety and because I thought it’d be fun. The pearls are normally white but they change to other natural pearl colours if you’re near a dangerous substance. When they are near a cursed object, the pearls will turn purple. When they’re near a poison, they turn green, and blue near sedatives. I don’t understand all the details about the charmwork myself, but Mr. Newitt wrote a pamphlet I can show you and you can always go to him with any questions…” Harry trailed off, realizing he was probably rambling at this point.
“Now, we keep doing what we’ve been doing— working, babysitting Teddy, running from reporters. But we get to do it with the knowledge that whatever happens, whatever disaster may come our way, we’ll always be together,” Harry spoke softly.
all right!” Draco huffed. He began gesturing wildly, a sign that he was completely losing control, “I’m sitting here in
He waved his wand to unstick the ring from the shell and placed it on Draco’s left ring finger, the cluster of white pearls adorning his pale hand beautifully.
Harry felt something bubbling within his chest, filling him with a warm glow. He couldn’t believe this was actually happening.
The oysters were carefully placed at the foot of the castle. Maybe they could represent the school carriages? It was a stretch but he didn’t care much at this point. The special oyster was hidden in his mokeskin pouch.
we discussed,” Draco said, “In addition to what I already mentioned, Mr. Hoffman will be partnering with Malfoy Industries so that we may provide the technology to support his many business ventures. He’s starting with an order of ten-thousand mobile phones. I’m sure he means for me to sign the contract at the dinner he invited us to tomorrow evening.”
“It’s quite simple, really. I discreetly asked the bartender to make virgin mimosas after the third,” Draco replied, “Frankly, I’m more worried about the state you’re in. How could you possibly have four cocktails in a row?”
“No, Harry. It means that I am going to consult on their designs and wear their clothes to events. And get paid handsomely for it,” Draco replied.
After rinsing the shampoo out of his hair and applying a dollop of conditioner, Harry waved him off to finish bathing on his own. Draco sat against the side of the tub, just in case Harry needed any help with his foot. His assistance wasn’t needed in the end, but it was still pleasant spending this time together. He almost felt back to normal afterwards.
“Harry, I told you, I don’t like oysters. Raw fish can be infected with bacteria and I just find oysters unpleasant on principle because you eat them while they’re still alive—” Draco protested.
“Hello, love,” Harry said, sitting on the edge of the chaise, “I just came to fetch you to join me for a swim. Is everything alright?” He refrained from touching Draco, as he knew it was very likely that he was about to get his head chewed off.
“That was a brilliant idea and you’re just jealous because you didn’t think of it first,” Draco huffed.
“And a borderline pornographic photoshoot for your new ad campaign,” Draco added. “You’ll revolutionize the baking industry.”
After they finished eating, they began to get ready for the pool. Harry quickly brushed his teeth and switched out his boxer briefs for a pair of swimming trunks. He laid down on the bed with his hands behind his head, waiting for Draco to finish his morning routine. As he observed Draco walking back and forth between the bedroom and the bathroom, he remembered to grab his watch off the nightstand and check that the time was accurate. He cast a
Draco leaned in, his face an inch away from Harry’s and whispered, “They’re lovely profiteroles, Potter.” He closed the gap between them and their lips finally connected.
Harry nodded eagerly, and agreed that they’d see each other soon. They exchanged information and shook hands, before the Italians walked back in the direction they came from.
The photoshoot had been utterly outrageous and absolutely spectacular. Harry’s expression had been one of childlike delight and Draco couldn’t ask for a better memory of their trip. The idiot kept the last crab from the bucket and posed with it— placing it on his head, on his shoulder, and even kissing it. There was one shot of Harry holding the crab over the starfish with a fierce expression on his face, pretending the crab was battling the starfish. Harry insisted that Draco take a selfie with him and the crab. Right as he was clicking the shutter button, Harry turned and kissed his cheek like the disgusting sap he was. He’d probably planned it all along, the fucker.
They walked along and Draco realized that he was being led to the spot where Harry had been collecting shells this morning. Draco could see clusters of large rocks and colorful blurry shapes under the water, which was about mid-thigh.
“Those sprays are rubbish, Harry. They don’t cover your skin enough to actually work,” Draco was looking in the mirror as he closed the clasp of his necklace, “Trust me, this is the best way to protect your skin. I won’t have you dying of cancer in twenty years because nobody taught you proper skin care.”
Draco diligently applied the sunscreen all over his back, and other areas that were not completely covered. His hands were surprisingly firm as they moved across his body.
Harry smiled. Draco had come such a long way from the spoiled brat he met at Madame Malkin’s all those years ago. He became a fine young man, kind, generous, driven, and open-minded. Harry had so much respect for him, because he knew it took a lot of insight and soul-searching to turn his life around.
He was beginning to grow impatient when suddenly Draco walked into the bedroom stark naked. Harry raised his eyebrows as the blond sat on the edge of the bed and began rubbing some white lotion all over his body. It had a strong chemical smell, so Harry guessed it was sunscreen. He watched, mesmerized, as Draco spread the lotion all over his pale white thighs. Disappointingly, he continued down his legs all the way to his feet.
He was currently laying on a cot, spread out on the sand under shade provided by the tent. There was a towel wrapped around him like a blanket, to shield him from the cool breeze. Harry was snoozing on the cot next to him and Draco was heading that way himself.
“Not after I inform the twins about your little fanclub,” Draco replied, climbing into the bed with Harry.
“Anyway, he recognized me from the paper, and complemented my choice of robes for the Ministry Ball last April—”
All of a sudden, Harry stood and started shuffling around in a nervous little circle. He then spoke in an enthusiastic tone, “Hey Draco, I have a good feeling about this o-
“I think I shall have to receive Mediwizard training if I’m to hang around you much longer,” Draco replied, washing his hands at the sink.
“Of course, I drank them, why wouldn’t I? That was the competition, wasn’t it?” Harry asked, confused. Something wasn’t right. Draco wasn’t wailing in defeat yet.
“Of fucking course it was planned! I was sure you had figured me out when you gave me that look as I was accepting the dinner invite,” Draco replied, “And you just completely stole my thunder, as always. I had a speech planned and everything. I hope you’re sorry,” Draco sniffed.
“Have a good sleep, babe?” Harry asked, gripping his torso even tighter as he stroked his side with his fingers.
“Hold on,” Harry said, “I never saw anyone hanging all over you. Where are all your admirers? Someone had to buy you all those mimosas, virgin or otherwise,” Harry asked, frustrated.
“Yup. Starting…...now!” Harry ran over to the pool and made a spectacular dive, headfirst into the water. As he came up for air, he noticed the German girls he was talking to earlier sitting at the edge of the pool and giggling. This was his moment.
They leaned on the railing, watching the lights on the shore grow smaller and smaller. The salty sea breeze was cooling and helped to counteract the humid night air. Moonlight shone down on the water and helped to break up the endless black void before them. There was something unsettling about the ocean at night. The waiter returned with their drinks, some fancy white wine that Harry surely couldn’t pronounce. They took sips as they chatted and enjoyed the fresh air.
“Good boy,” Draco said, in a sultry tone. Harry immediately straightened, heart beating a bit faster.
“Your nipples landed you an amazing business deal! You’re the hottest boyfriend in the whole world!” Harry exclaimed. He draped himself all over Draco’s front and wrapped his hands around his lower back, “My boyfriend really
They stood from the table, and out of the corner of his eye he saw Draco sneaking what was sure to be a hefty tip into the waiter’s hand.
“That doesn’t count! You’re the Saviour of the Wizarding World, you could be half-troll and your sycophants would still sing your praises as if you were Merlin himself,” Draco responded, “
“That man… that man bought you twelve drinks… from this fancy, overpriced hotel bar? How the fuck did you pull that off? Did you have to suck him off in the mens’???” Harry asked, sarcastically, but with genuine astonishment.
“Yes, you’re the very picture of masculinity, darling,” Draco replied, indulgently, “I’ve always wanted to be with a man who can pitch his own tent. Did you see that the beach has tiny crabs?”
A furious blush spread across Harry’s face. He grew redder and redder as Draco moved away and resumed at Harry’s neck, sucking at the spot right below his jaw. Leaving fluttery kisses that caused Harry to squirm more.
Draco smiled to himself as Harry excitedly ran over to see the tiny crabs. He knew him far too well.
“I don’t have to pretend anything,” Draco said, counting off on his fingers, “You drink your cereal milk straight from the bowl, you won’t throw away pants with holes in them, you thought Mozart’s
an objective thing to measure. How about… Whoever can get the most drinks bought for them in the next two hours?” Draco suggested.
There were a million ways to answer such a vague question. Harry smirked, closing both of his hands over Draco’s.
“Why, if it isn’t the famous Mr. Baker?” Draco drawled, in his typical fashion, “It’s about time you graced us with your presence. I was starting to believe you’d abandon me for your merry band of hooligans.” Draco took a calm sip of his drink as the older man chuckled.
The mysteries of the universe were largely attributed to magic by wizardkind. Experience had taught him that this was a short-sighted approach to understanding their world, as the Muggles found scientific explanations for just about everything. He learned a lot about Muggles as he had been developing Malfoy Technologies over the past few years. There was so much information they collected over centuries that had never made it to wizarding Britain, since the split between their societies and the implementation of the Statute of Secrecy. So many scientific advancements had completely changed the Muggle world and yet wizarding Britain was stuck in the past. He made it his mission to integrate Muggle science with magical research in order to bring wizarding Britain into a new technological age. Granger was determined to change their society through legislation. Draco aimed to do it through good old capitalism.
“You know, you still haven’t said what you want after winning our bet yesterday,” Harry said, crossing his arms over his chest, “Other than the embarrassing T-shirt thing. I only hope it’s not something else that’s going to put me on the front page of The Prophet.”
“I run the largest magical tech company in all of Europe and this is what impresses you? A crab castle?” Draco replied, in a sarcastic tone.
“I haven’t told you the story yet. I got this ring from my mother. It originally belonged to Phineas Black around 1895. I don’t know if you’ve heard about him before, but he was disowned by his father, Phineas Nigellus Black, for supporting Muggle rights. He’s one of the scorch marks on that hideous Black family tapestry,” Draco looked up into Harry’s eyes, face still red and grey eyes blazing with emotion.
“You’re a war hero, not bloody Britney Spears. Of course they don’t know who you are,” Draco rolled his eyes.
As the afternoon wore on, Harry got more and more intoxicated. But he was feeling fantastic! Draco was right, it seemed as though every available adult at the resort wanted to get in Harry’s pants. Elke and her friends. Antonello and Luca. An American pilot named Steve… He couldn’t remember the names after that because he’d been too pissed. But safe to say, he’d been teased, complemented, and groped by any number of people of both genders.
Draco took a shower, washing off the sand that managed to wedge its way into every nook and cranny. Harry wanted one too, but he couldn’t get his injured foot wet. He settled for a bath with his leg sticking out of the side of the tub. Draco was still feeling a bit stressed and he noticed Harry was looking rather dismal, so he offered to wash his hair for him. The water was warm and Harry’s inky black hair was soft underneath his fingers. He probably spent more time rubbing the coconut-scented shampoo into his scalp than he strictly needed to, but Harry wasn’t complaining. In fact, he looked totally relaxed, almost making Draco wonder if he was falling asleep. It was nice.
He was ready to end the night relaxing in a pool under the stars with his favorite person in the world.
It had already been a couple of minutes and there was no reply from the hotel. Draco assumed that they hadn’t gotten their message.
They finished their meal and the table was cleared for dessert. Harry was feeling nervous and excited so he ordered them one of everything. Draco rolled his eyes but didn’t say anything.
Harry looked over at him now, and admired his appearance. He had styled his hair back tonight, accentuating his bone structure and giving those expressive eyebrows a chance to shine. He was dressed in a pale pink suit with a white shirt and silk lavender tie. Despite his stylistic choices and slim figure, Draco’s confidence and commanding attitude gave him a strong, masculine look.
That is, until he noticed that he was not the only person ogling his boyfriend, who was currently getting out of the pool and being approached by a group of young women. They were wearing the most scandalously small bikinis he’d ever seen. Harry was friendly and good-natured, but the girls quickly left him alone, causing Draco to breathe a sigh of relief. This was short-lived, however, as there were suddenly two very attractive men talking to Harry and they were
- bloody horse?” Harry asked, gasping for breath. He began holding his breath again, and was determined to hold it this time.
Draco reached further down and Harry wasn’t able to give a coherent reply. He supposed sunscreen wasn’t so bad after all.
“Bullshit, I’ll have you know I was asked out by four different men at the Lupin Charity Gala!” Draco cried.
Totally distracted by gushy romantic thoughts, Harry lost all desire to argue and obediently began applying the sunscreen. When he finished with the areas he could reach, he asked for Draco’s help with his back.
“It’s true. My bad boy image and checkered past make you that much more alluring. Not to mention my impeccable fashion sense. I read an article about it in Witch Weekly,” Draco said.
- my body instead of all the shit I did as a literal child soldier. Baker’s not a bad name either. Much cooler than -
Eyes shining with eagerness, Harry clearly knew exactly what Draco was going for. Usually Draco took charge, making it his business to get him turned on through teasing and pushing boundaries with foreplay.
“Don’t worry about it. You know better than anyone that I have more money than I know what to do with. Besides, Mr. Newitt was a super nice guy and he gave me a generous discount on account of saving the world and all,” Harry replied nonchalantly. Seriously, did Draco think he was going to bankrupt himself over an engagement ring? He wasn’t
“It’s brilliant. You’ll be an international baking sensation. Men everywhere will question their sexuality. Women will name their children after you.” Draco replied, continuing in a wistful tone.
He lowered his lips to press a kiss to Harry’s collarbone. A hunger flared within Draco as he kissed down to Harry’s chest. He nipped at the patch of skin under Harry’s right collarbone and sucked at the redness to leave his mark. A rolling moan left Harry as a small
“They invited me to a match! And they said we could hang out later. That they were looking for someone to play with,” Harry said.
look like a work of art. All lean and graceful. Miles of milky white skin. Sharp collar bones and rosy pink nipples… Harry huffed, thinking about Mr. Hoffman seeing Draco like this.
“Yeah, that sounds brilliant. I’d love to see a match sometime,” Harry responded, “In the meantime, maybe you guys want to mess around on the pitch later? Race a couple laps? Or play some footie if you’d rather have a change of pace. I’m up for whatever.”
“Of course not, Potter. You don’t seem to understand lecherous old men very well. They’ll move heaven and Earth just for the miniscule
“All right, I’m going to Side-Along you to the tent, are you ready?” Draco asked in an authoritative voice.
Harry raised his injured foot over his left knee and Draco kneeled down to inspect it. The sole of his foot was swollen and red, blue rings around each spine that pierced the skin. He took a calming breath and gently guided the spines out with his wand. Once the spines had all been removed, Draco conjured a bucket and filled it with warm water.
Draco was obsessive about taking care of his skin. Harry had never met anyone who used so many lotions,creams, and ointments. He didn’t fully understand it, but if it helped preserve Draco’s gorgeous skin then Harry was all for it.
“I’m lucky you’re a natural, then,” he replied. He stared down at his foot, which was slowly beginning to heal, “The charter boat was scheduled to pick us up in… two hours? D’you reckon somebody’ll come before that?” Harry asked.
“I promise it won’t be awful like my mirror, who is possibly both jealous of you and horrified by your grooming skills,” Draco pleaded, “It’s fashioned after Muggle technology, so it will be very practical and straightforward. The watch won’t develop its own personality. If anything it’ll be more similar to those charms that read books aloud to you.”
A few minutes later, they were seated at the table awaiting a meal that Draco ordered for them. Harry didn’t know too much about food unless it involved dough. Cooking just wasn’t his thing. He was excited to see what they had for dessert, though.
After five minutes had passed, Harry pulled himself out of the pool and was about to head over to Draco when he was suddenly surrounded by four bikini-clad girls. They looked to be about 18, definitely quite young and excitable. In fact, Harry was having a bit of a hard time following what they were saying due to all the giggling. He was having flashbacks to being mobbed by fans in Diagon Alley. After a moment, he realized that the girls had a German accent and hadn’t mentioned his name, so it was possible that they didn’t recognize him. He sighed in relief and his smile became much brighter. When one of the girls asked if he wanted to play pool volleyball with them, he politely declined— saying he’d love to see them another time. The girls quickly left, giggling and speaking rapid-fire German on their way.
Harry dug into the tiramisu, crème brûlée, Black Forest cake, éclair, and tres leches. His favorite was the crème brûlée— his just never seemed to turn out quite this flavorful. He could see the fresh vanilla beans, maybe that was the secret? He was meaning to find a supplier of fresh vanilla for ages. Hmmm. Maybe Neville could help him with that? He’d never thought to ask before.
Harry rolled his eyes and sighed. Draco was being bitchy about it but he probably had a point. He usually did, when it came to these kinds of things. Harry still refused to give in though.
Kissing down his stomach, Draco stopped above his belly button and glanced up at Harry with a sly smile. His lips left his skin as his hands moved to Harry’s hips. Fingers danced at the hem of his swim trunks, teasing as he slipped in to brush Harry’s hipbone.
It was the weekend, my weekend, anyhow, and I was swiping my way through Grindr, looking to release some stress following the heinous practice schedule McLeod had adopted following our narrow win over the Falmouth Falcons
, Harry,” I ground out, pumping my hips into him, eyes snapping shut at the impossibly tight, slippery heat of him.
“I usually got punished for it. Once I ended up on the roof of the school kitchens because I was trying to get away from Dudley and his friends chasing me. And once, when we were at the zoo, I set a boa constrictor loose on Dudley,” Harry sniggered.
Draco sighed and began to suck my dick in earnest, and I was completely lost in the sight and feel of him swallowing and licking at me.
I managed, fingers finally curling themselves into soft cashmere, tugging upwards, urging the luxurious barrier that stood between Draco’s smooth skin and my seeking hands out of the way.
“Also, I might have made you forget a few seconds here and there,” he added, taking a sip of his drink and looking the slightest bit sorry at my pointed stare.
I was broken from my musings to find a very impish-looking Harry kneeling between my knees, eyes focused on my cock, which had, apparently, been very aware of what Harry was up to, given its current semi-hard state.
“I am,” I countered, still alternating between lascivious licks of my tongue and slow slides in and out with my cock.
Gryffindor,” albeit inadvertently, when the bloke in question suddenly stumbled and went flying, just barely catching himself on the edge of another table, and we all looked at Pansy.
He let out a chuckle, head tilting down to place a gentle kiss on one of my thighs, still wrapped loosely around his neck.
This earned me a teasing smack from Alice but was completely worth it for the belly laugh Harry gave, head tossed back, leaning against Draco for support.
In any case, I hope you enjoy it. It does move a bit slowly, but it's got TONS of information that may be useful later :)
An urgent moan tore itself from my throat as I leaned in to give Harry’s sweet opening a frenzied lick, returning almost immediately to swirl round the pulsing, pink pucker, mouth fastening to it, tongue pushing forward, seeking the delicious heat of him.
“Harry, really,” I sighed, licking into him again, taking care not to call him ‘kitten’ aloud quite yet.
and flip about until a giant opening appeared on a narrow, cobbled path lined with shops that twisted and turned far as the eye could see.
“I really hope this shitbag gets caught soon,” she informed us, glaring at each one of us in turn, as though we were somehow personally responsible for this.
“Look at yourself the way I would see you,” I instructed, reaching my hand around to wrap around his cock once more and Harry moaned quietly above me,
“I mean, I don’t ever want a repeat, but I’d say the rest of the morning went nicely enough,” I reasoned, giving him a one-shouldered shrug.
Harry, Ron, Hermione, Charlie, Ginny, and Micah were all sitting at the table, laughing at something Harry had just said or did, and I couldn’t help but smirk as I imagined Harry navigating conversation and appearing normal before his mates with his new toy nestled up his arse.
“When are we going to see your wand?” Alfie demanded, putting us back on track, and Draco switched his drink to his right hand and held out his left, the familiar hawthorn wand zooming into it.
“We’re getting my Harry all caught up, then?” Draco’s voice suddenly appeared as he sat on the stool beside me, setting another round of pints on the table.
blaring from the speakers and I stood on the foot bar of my barstool as did Hermione and we began to dance and sing:
immediately with our Muggle counterparts? Or is more research needed? Will we be working together internationally? What is your advice?”
You know the sort, where you can see it coming and know you’ve no hope of stopping it before it’s there, barrelling through you with such an intensity that you get swept up and dragged along with it.
“Why would someone be using Ben to come after you?” Blaise asked, steering us back on topic. “We need to find possible answers to that question if we’re going to figure anything out.”
Apparently my face had given me away because next second Malfoy snorted with laughter and smirked again.
“So,” Hermione continued, clearly trying to make Tristan feel at ease. “Any plans to see our boy Harry again anytime soon?”
“Course we are,” Pansy answered, holding her glass out towards Blaise for a refill. “There’s quite the jackpot at stake.”
Honestly, I’d briefly considered obliterating all the memories of Harry but hadn’t quite been able to bring myself to do it.
“We’ll take two of the shirako,” Draco interrupted smoothly, reaching over to grasp each of my hands, which were still waving towards our chef, in each one of his own.
Students began their day at the centre, where they enjoyed games and socialising over breakfast before they made their way to Chiswick House & Gardens for their outdoor adventures.
I stared down at him, unable to even process how fucking incredible Harry, his request, and everything about this moment was.
“I dunno,” Draco answered, taking my hand once more as we strolled along the path. “I know you need to take your shoes off before entering a home in Japan, so it’s probably something similar. You’re entering someone else’s space and you don’t want to disrespect it by traipsing your nasty shoes all over it.”
“There’ll be champagne,” Draco was saying, a knowing little smile tugging at his lips as he gathered me into his arms, tilting my face up towards his for a kiss.
There was a brief silence as Charlie, Hagrid, and I processed this, then my mobile pinged, and I jumped.
Ridiculous and gifted with an incredibly talented mouth, I amended silently, as Harry began to lick and suck at my cock, looking for all the world as though this were his ideal morning routine.
Violet giggled as Draco rolled his eyes and shook his head down at her and Alfie as though negating Blaise’s comment and all of our grunts of disbelief.
“I’ve got proof,” I added, allowing my eyes to drop down to stare at that mouth again before shutting my eyes at the memory of Harry’s mouth sliding willingly around my cock.
Harry began to walk me backwards towards the bedroom, an almost crazed urgency emanating from him that told me now was not the time for teasing.
“Not to mention he defeated He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named when he was only seventeen,” another witch seated next to us chimed in. “And that, after he made him lose all his power as a wee babe.”
“What’d I miss?” Gin asked, sitting beside me and stealing a sip of my coffee. “What are we talking about?”
“Spread open, like a fucking feast,” he continued, bending down to give a few gentle swipes of his tongue at my opening, and I couldn’t help but groan, fingers reaching back into his hair, encouraging him to continue licking and swirling.
,” he finished with a smirk, and I couldn’t help licking my lips in anticipation as I glanced over at the bed.
to his side, Blaise at my heels, and bent down to offer the injured wizard my hand, then gasped as he tilted his head up to look at me, a look of panic written all over his face.
Merlin, if he continued like this, I’d not be seeing straight and crying in no time, I thought, as my eyes slid shut, relishing the onslaught of Draco’s words almost as much as his hands and mouth, still taunting me with teasing touches and kisses.
Blaise caught on immediately and guffawed, heaving himself upright and bending nearly in half, he was laughing so hard.
Harry had just sent a barrage of pebbles in his direction but when they got to about three inches from Draco’s face, they ricocheted off an invisible barrier surrounding Draco.
“We need a bath,” he declared, turning, grasping my hand in his own, and all but dragging me towards the hallway opposite his front door that I’d noted earlier.
My cock was already filling out nicely, and I lazily flicked my wand to have my mobile snap some shots while I was stroking my cock as it continued to grow.
He turned his attention back to Vernon with an evil smirk and I screamed again as Vernon slowly began to rotate until he was turned upside down on the wall.
“You really think there’s some bloke who’s been obsessed with Draco for the past six years?” Harry asked.
I didn’t... couldn’t respond, and hoped the question was rhetorical as I pushed back, silently (ok, silently, aside from the now nearly constant moaning) asking for more.
“An hour or more?” I echoed once again, just to be sure, stopping in my tracks. “To put slimy, raw fish in our mouths?”
And I’d be lying if I said Potter, on his knees, mouth stretched wide around my cock, wasn’t one of the top ones.
The song mentioned in the chapter is "Laid" by a band called James that were popular in the 90s that I found on a "90s Anthem" mix on Spotify.
n’t drunk, I’d kiss you,” I blurted out, again, spewing forth such gems that I would have most likely rather kept hidden.
“How do you want me to get you ready, love?” I asked, threading my fingers through his hair, still avoiding his kisses, knowing it drove him crazy.
“Sure you do, kitten,” I reasoned, allowing myself to swirl my tongue into his mouth, tangling with his own, before darting out again.
I can’t even imagine the picture I made for Malfoy, prostrate between his knees, greedily slurping up and down his cock, blindfolded, hands bound, humping back wantonly onto a dildo he’d charmed to fuck my arse.
“No,” he admitted, shaking his head slowly. “I bet you wash your own hair like that all the time. Told you you were a poncy prat.”
the song continued and Micah let out a whoop and hopped off her chair, walking around the table to grab Draco.
“I just assume sometime in the past, one of our ancestors were born non-wizard from a wizard family.”
“Are you sure, Potter?” he countered, eyes slanting down at me teasingly as he pushed a red button, about the size of a credit card, at the far end of his counter space. “I’ve heard seven months is a record for you.”
“Gods, I’ve missed you,” Harry sighed, arms reaching up to wrap around my neck, fingers tangling in my hair as I pulled his body up against mine, meeting him for a frantic kiss.
“Where did you end up?” Williams asked, eyes flitting up towards Draco as he scooted his chair closer to Davies to peer at the stack of parchment covered in Draco’s neat handwriting.
My Draco, who would alternately frown and give triumphant cries of glee as he filled out the Daily Telegraph’s cryptic each morning — in ink, no less — it was a competition he and Hermione had, which was fine with me so long as it kept him occupied during breakfast so I could eat my toast in silence and just stare at how pretty he was.
Micah laughed and ran towards Draco, closing the distance to fling her arms round his neck as he grabbed her up and swung her around, both of them giggling with glee.
“Severus,” I managed around a forced smile, taking in my godfather’s ghost with its ghastly gash across his neck, and I seethed inwardly that a man as wonderful as my godfather
“That you’re an incorrigible slut?” I taunted, looking anywhere but at those impossibly earnest, open, green eyes. “Absolutely.”
Hermione, bless her heart, looked as though she’d just died and gone to heaven, and I had a feeling Harry and I would be spending a lot of time lounging on the very comfy-looking sofas while Draco and Hermione did research or read a history book for fun, or whatever.
! Gin!” Micah squealed, grabbing onto Ginny’s hand and jumping excitedly. “I wanna throw an apple peel!”
Just kept staring at some point above Ron’s head, jaw working slightly, his right eyebrow twitching, as though he were straining to keep himself from hexing Blaise… well, all three of us, really.
“Really, Harry?” Draco demanded, glaring down at Harry. “Give us some warning, next time. Poor girl’s still new to magic.”
off by the whistle of a firework soaring up and bursting above us, and we turned our attention skywards to enjoy the show.
There is most definitely a connection between the victims and discovering that connection will be a key step in solving the case.
“You’re fucking serious, Potter. You wouldn’t give a damn about me if it weren’t for my cock. Are you fucking kidding me?”
“I suppose so,” he agreed, still cutting flowers, and I got the impression he was purposely avoiding my gaze.
,” I replied, grinning at the thought of my father popping up every weekend to play with all the Muggle appliances our new home would surely have.
“In the most extreme sense of both words,” he added, a rueful grin on his face as I raised my head to kiss him once more.
“You think I didn’t put a protective spell around all of my devices the day I learnt of that stupid app?” he demanded haughtily. “Put one on his, too. Not taking any chances.”
“You don’t?” I questioned, managing, somehow, to raise an eyebrow and smirk, despite half my face still being hidden by the luscious globes of Harry’s arse.
A smack resounded in the silent flat as Malfoy swatted my arse with, what felt to be, a thin, wooden paddle.
“Yeah, get over it, already,” Hugo was shouting at the telly and shaking a fist angrily, proving that my son was going to be one of
“Oh, right, about that…” I interjected with another wince. “He can’t do magic at home during the breaks. Not until he’s seventeen.”
“Especially you,” I snorted, grinning up at Draco. “I don’t think I’ve seen another blond head here yet!”
“Oh. Erm. I suppose some ice would be nice,” I clarified, then watched as Malfoy reached out to grab two rocks glasses and placed a giant cube of ice in each.
I rolled my eyes and decided to get a whole clove, and insist on a post-ramen snog, just to annoy him.
Honestly, it was still new for me – this feeling of disappointment and anxiousness whenever the Ministry summoned me.
“Well,” he grinned down at me as I nuzzled his neck, “I think it’s safe to say I’ve converted you to the world of edging.”
“And, my guess is that you two continued, because Harry, Luv, you were in a ‘certain mood,’ and Draco, having that… how did you put it?... That bloody
Draco seemed to find this bit of information amusing, and he looked as though he had just found an important missing piece to a puzzle.
that thing where he stared at me as though I’d sprouted another head, then he frowned off to the side, and I just knew the wheels in his head were spinning in overdrive.
“You’re the one who’s all about edging,” I reminded him, pulling off again and raising myself up to kiss him softly on the mouth.
They’ve got sofas and comfortable chairs instead of regular theatre seats… erm, kind of like what the Wizengamot sit it. Too close together and upright and uncomfortable.
“No problem, Harry,” he grinned, then motioned to the stunning woman standing beside him. “This is my wife,
He traced one hand up to fondle my balls gently, still sliding that incredible mouth of his up and down, looking, for all the world, like this was his absolute happy place.
Bessie arrived just then, carrying a tiered tray laden with sandwiches, scones, and cakes that would have rivalled any offered in all of England.
“So… you’re saying that, to some effect, you protected your privacy, as well as that of someone else, but now you’re worried that, in doing so, you’ve violated the trust of a friend.”
“What did you mean by cupboard?” he’d asked again, very slowly, which, in Draco-speak, meant this was my last chance.
moment, I wondered whether all this hospitality towards Father was being done out of the honest-to-goodness purity of the Weasley’s hearts or to shove in his face how they could be hospitable and kind and he’d
My gaze continued lower, taking in how the superb tailoring of the trousers showed off his thighs and hugged the curve of his arse in a way that made me bloody jealous, wishing it was my
Draco was suddenly jerked up into the air, and the next second was sitting high up on one of the branches of another tree.
I breathed an inward sigh of relief and looked at Tristan with, what I hoped, was a bemused expression.
“Potter!” Draco hissed, and I could have sworn they’d been playing but he actually sounded angry as he continued to stare at Harry, his eyes flashing,
“Better,” Ginny replied. “But… he’s Harry, and he’ll probably have worked himself back up by the time he gets back to the flat or as soon as Draco… I dunno… accidentally ignores him in his haste to get a glass of water to chase his hangover or something.”
The events of the day were whirling in my brain as I sat sprawled across my sofa, staring at the wall, trying to make sense of it.
“Shall we ring Pierre-Yves for some food?” I suggested, pulling his face back towards me for another kiss.
Harry’s eyes were riveted to me, licking and sucking at the glass head, knowing I was tasting him, watching my eyes flutter shut as I moaned quietly.
There was also the international aspect to consider — I knew that Shacklebot and his team had been in several meetings with the ministries, cabinets, and various governing bodies of several other countries to discuss the growing movement.
“Ben,” she greeted with a smile so natural despite the situation, I immediately understood why Harry and Hermione called her ‘Mummy Draco.’
“Well, he does things that you really have trouble rationalising,” Dudley explained, talking at the table, brow furrowed in thought.
doing here?” I demanded, eyes blazing so furiously I knew if it had been anyone else they wouldn’t have dared return my gaze.
“Sorry,” I apologised, quickly shoving my mobile into my pocket as I hurried to catch up. “Just a text from work.”
We made our way down the long hallway that ran alongside the reception and family room, passing through the Zabini’s gorgeous, gigantic kitchen and dining area — honestly, I was positively jealous every time I came over and had considered trading the flat for a proper house
Draco reached down to wrap his hand around my cock, jerking me off in time, and all too soon, I heard him cry out. Felt him shooting up inside of me, eyes squeezing shut, hand still working my cock until I, too, shot over that edge, collapsing onto him, biting at the juncture of his neck and shoulder, marking him with an absolutely feral growl.
“Treacle?” I asked, perking up immediately, and both the server and Draco couldn’t help but chuckle.
It had been so long since I’d seen this side of Harry — all business and ready to take on the world — that it actually startled me, and I allowed myself a
“You’re always starving,” he reminded me, twining his fingers through mine and lifting my hand to his mouth to brush my knuckles with a kiss.
Draco flipped the placard to “occupied,” swept the curtains aside, opened the door, and we entered a small tiled space that was dominated by a large wooden tub.
Perhaps urging him to buy the suit had been a mistake, I reckoned, appreciating the narrow cut of the jacket that highlighted Harry’s slim build, his heather-grey t-shirt making the suit more casual.
“Why not?” he asked, setting his mobile down and looking back at me. “She can handle it. She’s not a prude, you know.”
“How’d you convince it otherwise?” he asked, interested, and I wondered if anyone else had ever convinced the Sorting Hat to put them in a different house.
“I thought you just were entertaining Victoire and Dominique,” I said, taking a sip of wine, and remembering the ridiculous faces Draco had pulled all throughout Samhain weekend.
“Gods, how the fuck are you so tight?” I whispered against the perfect swell of his arse, watching my finger slide slowly in and out.
“No, it’s not,” he argued, tongue still battling with mine as his hands reached down to cover my own and keep them from pulling his jumper further up.
“Yeah, that’s him. He’s an Auror, and that’s more or less like a detective… but with more training. Years more.”
Then I was back at his hole, slurping and kissing into it because my Harry moaned so fucking sweetly when I kissed him there.
The two departed, and Jack was kind enough to rewind the movie so we could watch the happy ending uninterrupted.
“Does he?” Mum countered, raising an eyebrow. “The scene I walked in on this morning positively begs otherwise.”
“A most special wand,” Ollivander was murmuring, taking the wand from Callum and placing it gently in its box, then heading towards the little counter set up in the corner.
And I could only imagine, for someone like Draco, who’d never even experienced a brief part of his life not identifying as one.
never slip up and accidentally float me stuff all that time we were together?” I asked, grabbing my Guinness and taking a sip.
This was a habit he’d always had — sucking his thumb on one hand and playing with someone’s earlobe with the other.
I’d enjoyed teasing Ginny about how she, apparently, had decided to marry the most gorgeous man in England in an attempt to prove to everyone just how straight she was ever since.
I grinned, thinking of all the times I had playfully pulled it on Dudley, muttering nonsense, until they’d discovered I couldn’t do magic at home.
“Yeah,” he sighed and grabbed a cucumber sandwich. “I guess at some point I just started pulling away whenever things started getting serious.”
“I know you’re not,” he assured me, fingers still leisurely moving in and out of me, twisting downwards and brushing my prostate occasionally, almost as an afterthought.
My eyes flicked over the wall, seeing if I could identify any new languages since my youth, like an odd game of hide-and-seek or Where’s Waldo.
“I mean it,” Harry told me, tugging at my hands and urging them to wrap around his back, like he needed to convince me to do so, fucking bastard.
“Have you all heard about that crazy app that’s appearing on our phones?” Blaise asked suddenly, clearly trying to change the subject.
She was young, maybe in her late thirties, and had dark, expressive eyes, even in the black-and-white photo.
his molten chocolate cake and stare up at the world-famous tower, all her lights twinkling merrily against the dark sky.
“I’ve already told you, I’d have fucked you senseless, and we’d be done already if you didn’t keep making all those beautiful fucking
The slick, tight heat of him moulded itself around me, urging me forward, to lose myself in the way Harry’s arse practically swallowed me, and if I listened and allowed myself to give in the way I wanted — allowed myself to sink all the way into that sweetly begging channel, then it would all be over much too quickly.
“Still, I am happy for her,” Anaïs informed me, turning sideways and shifting so she could rest her head on my shoulder and curl her legs into my lap.
From my job after a particularly dangerous mission when I questioned if this was maybe the last time I’d put my life in danger, knowing damned well that it wasn’t.
I smirked as I raised my hands to knead along Potter’s shoulders, working at some knots there before working my thumbs up one side of his neck then the other.
“No idea,” I replied, sliding my fingers between his own as we made our way down the street. “Thought we’d go for a walk along the Seine, maybe drink a bottle of champagne and watch the sunset.”
Draco floated his wineglass to set gently on the table as he crossed the reception, one arm reaching out to wrap solidly around my waist, the other reaching up so he could cup my face in his palm.
It wouldn’t have been the first time a muggle server had mistaken Hermione and me for a couple, what, with all our leaning close together to whisper what they assumed were sweet nothings, but were, in actuality, top-secret happenings within the wizarding world.
“I am, in no way, implying that you have multiple personalities or anything of the sort,” I assured him before he could think to protest.
For starters, Draco bought us little treats at nearly every snack shop and vending machine whenever we passed one.
I drove myself into him mercilessly yet he still kept raising his hips to meet me, head thrown back, gasps spilling from his mouth.
“Davies, Williams,” Draco nodded at them each, in turn, gesturing to the chairs across from us, indicating that they should have a seat.
“What the bloody hell was that?” Ron asked suddenly, and I broke protocol and whirled around to see Ron, Blaise, and Hermione standing behind me with Harry, while Pansy and Ginny were standing protectively in front of Ben and Micah.
get away with this, I chanted to myself in my head, squeezing my eyes shut briefly, as though that might help shut out the onslaught of images he was
“Thought we’d liven this boring orange juice up a bit,” I explained, pouring two glasses then tipping a bit of the orange juice into each, handing one to Harry with a smile.
“I know,” he assured me, rolling his eyes. “You never do. That’s why Pansy and I have to risk our sanity and well-being to help you when you need it.”
“We’ve our fair share of those here in England, too,” I replied, deciding to join the conversation at last.
I worked slowly, relishing in the heat and pulse of Draco’s cock against my fingers as they continued to slip the buttons from their buttonholes.
“Fuck,” I murmured as my balls finally nestled up against Potter’s arse, resting there a bit, both giving him some time to adjust and giving myself a moment to process the unbelievable feeling of being fully engulfed by the incredible heat of his arse.
“I’m certainly eating,” he continued, returning to give a wide, slow lick over my hole, continuing up, giving a teasing suck at the soft patch between it and my dick, then tilting up to suck gently at each of my bollocks.
Ron paused and flicked his gaze up at Hermione, then leaned in towards Victoire, almost imperceptibly.
“I want you,” I gasped, hands still tangling, my body still pressing upwards as his lips trailed down my torso.
I was visibly excited by the thought of sucking Malfoy off before he slid those long fingers into me to open me up before he fucked me wide open with that ridiculous cock of his.
He thought Sunday would be calm and quiet because there’s no post on Sundays, but then they came pouring down the chimney!
except for Ginny, who was staring wide-eyed and tight-lipped at her mother, who was standing, jaw hanging, in the doorway.
“Why,” he tried again, hips still shoving back as I withdrew, running my hands up Harry’s back, then back down, shifting to trail down his sides, all the way down his thighs to calm him before spreading him wide open, one hand rising
“Oh, that’s how this one here always dresses,” I replied, returning his smile. “But I would have gladly worn jeans and a t-shirt.”
Hugo’s attention was already back on Harry and his response, and I’m not sure he’d even processed his mum’s explanation.
Above me, Harry sighed, hands tangling lazily in my hair, already well aware of my obsession with this
“Is this where they show it?” he asked, frowning down at Micah, then glancing back over at the poster, his brow furrowed.
“You can ask questions,” he stated, as though he could read my mind or something. “I can talk and brew at the same time.”
Often times, it was the somewhat standard, yet never-boring, slide out of sleep to find one’s morning glory being attended to.
“I’ve yet to get one on the first try,” Ollivander assured him, taking the wand back and returning to his shelves.
in the Muggle world,” she explained. “And the Muggles who are in the film attend and walk down a red carpet, all dressed up in fancy gowns and
Harry, all the while, kept moaning and circling his hips in my lap, leaning back, trusting me to hold him so that he could continue to grind down into my lap while pushing up into my teasing tongue.
The door clicked shut behind him and he settled himself on the couch, aiming his wand at the bottles to pop the corks out, twisting around to look at me expectantly.
When he reached my cock, he tilted his head and gave the head of it a delicate swirl with the tip of his tongue before sucking it into his mouth, tongue still swirling around as he glanced up at me, smirking.
“Or for when I might need evidence. For example, when a certain someone tries to make ungodly claims
“Of course,” I laughed, plucking Dominique from her arms and tossing her up in the air, earning squeals of delight from the toddler. “The more the merrier.”
“Who gave you those lovely roses?” Draco clarified, swirling his glass, and I glanced around the room, looking for the obvious bouquet of a dozen roses that I’d somehow missed, and my gaze landed on the small wooden cupboard in the corner, holding Pansy’s telly and a small vase with just a pair of roses — one white, one red — set in the corner.
He was wearing a light-blue button-down, sleeves rolled up casually, that made his pale skin almost radiant and his legs were crossed and encased in charcoal-grey trousers that looked as though they’d been tailored to showcase their length.
“That it’s a hundred years ago, and you and I are here, in this lovely room, this lovely body of yours my entertainment for the evening… should you accept my offer
“That means a lot,” he added, and I had the impression that, despite the levity of our current situation, he was deadly sincere.
Harry and Draco arrive in Tokyo with nearly a full day to explore the city before checking into their hotel room.
Once I’d managed to tear my mouth from his, I turned around and arranged myself so that I could lower myself back onto his length, allowing myself a throaty moan as he leant forward to press little kisses along my back as I did so, tongue darting out to lap and swirl at my skin every once in a while.
He didn’t answer, of course, only folded his arms under his head, angling his hips up and back so that I could fuck into him even more deeply; of course, I was only too happy to oblige, setting a steady rhythm, searching for the right angle to catch that bundle of nerves that would have Potter squirming and moaning beneath me.
“Erm… I mean, yes, please,” I amended smiling up at our server with a sneaking suspicion that this particular menu item had helped Draco determine where we were eating dinner tonight.
“So… ready for Round Two?” I’d messaged, sending another gratuitous nude, this time not bothering to hide my face, giving him a cheeky wink in the photo.
“Burberry invented it,” he added, frowning when I just stared at him blankly as I hastily tucked my shirt into my trousers and fumbled with my belt.
“Can’t tell you what to do?” Draco challenged, straightening in his chair and fixing me with that look.
“Tell me, Potter,” he asked, still coherent. Still casual. He slowly eased his cock into me just a bit before withdrawing and continuing.
“Yeah, well… technically I’m five years older than I think I am, so maybe I’ve finally grown up, or somethin’….” Ben quipped.
A range of t-shirts and jeans were folded neatly on the shelves, and I assumed the drawers held pants, socks, and other such items.
With a laugh, we broke into our separate teams, Hermione, Micah, Fleur, and the children looking on.
be friends right now, had they found out you were using their baby sister to cover up your sexuality.”
“Yeah, and we call trousers pants, too,” Williams shot right back, tearing another piece from his sandwich.
Harry was always understanding and let me go, albeit reluctantly, those ridiculous eyes of his staring up at me, as though he could try to mask the fear and worry in them.
Still, I was looking forward to more of Molly’s food over the weekend and gave myself a small chuckle at yet another comparison
It was mere seconds before I was once more on my knees before Harry’s exquisite arse, Harry already groaning and rolling his hips back as my mouth already sought the delicious core of him.
Beneath the bright yellow coating lay a shell of white chocolate filled with lime and white chocolate ganache, which made Harry’s mouth pucker a bit after he’d replied that it was seeing me gather him up at work.
He meticulously sliced each piece with his razor-sharp knife as though it were the most revered art, and I supposed it very well could have been from what I understood of Japan and food presentation.
He huffed another sigh, and I had to wonder if maybe Micah had misjudged Harry and Draco’s reasons for disappearing earlier.
Needless to say, I’d quickly got over my initial squick regarding the raw eggs used in the recipe once I’d tasted that creamy, bacon-y goodness, and now carbonara was one of my favourites.
Malfoy responded by fucking me even harder, watching me climb further towards the edge before he released my legs allowing me to wrap them around him, drawing him closer as he leant down to bite and latch on to my neck, right at that sensitive hollow, just above the collarbone, and I came undone.
do is burn this hovel you call home to the ground, with you locked inside it,” he hissed fixing us with his gaze again, and his eyes were filled with such hatred that I could only cower and hide my face in Vernon’s shoulder.
into having as children thanks to Voldemort, the past decade of our friendship had been relatively uneventful, and (dare I even think it?) normal.
“Is this what you wanted when you messaged me? Is my cock opening you up enough, you fucking slut? When you're on your broomstick tomorrow at practice will you even be able to sit on it properly?”
I slowed and accentuated these last three words with three, long, deep thrusts that had Potter gasping beneath me.
“The rabbit pappardelle ragout,” he sighed, tossing his menu onto the table, all but admitting defeat.
“You know, just to rub it in, and make me jealous,” Williams scowled jokingly across the table, crossing his arms.
“How did you disguise it?” Harry asked curiously. “How do you now, for that matter? I’ve never noticed any telltale bulge in your trousers. In public anyway.”
, and one night, when she was gushing about how cool witches were, and it was too bad the dad had to give up his magic to marry his wife, he was like ‘Ta-da! Surprise! I’m a wizard!’ Isn’t that bloody
“Harry,” I tried again. “I swear to Merlin, if the two of you start a fucking duel in the middle of a muggle pub, not even
Maybe it was a decadent breakfast that got Draco so worked up? I wondered and almost giggled to myself as my knees hit the mattress behind me.
Ron was an Auror, of course, and Hermione was an Unspeakable in the Department of Mysteries. Neither Ron nor I even knew which department she worked for. Love? Thought? Time? Death? It could be any of them, honestly.
I couldn’t help pressing kisses behind Harry’s ear, along his neck, trailing along his collarbone as I explained it all to him, and he groaned when I finally kissed him on the mouth.
We made a right at the next intersection, and I gasped because there was no doubt now that I was in Paris.
I watched, still alternately sipping my tea and soup, as our chef expertly moulded little oblong rice mounds in his hands, then topped them with slices of fish.
- Draco would, in those few precious moments between sleep and wake, slowly rub his elegant, high-arched feet against each other.
“Does Harry have a bit of a liking for treacle?” Malik teased, winking over at Harry good-naturedly.
, does anyone need a refill on their drink?” he asked, holding up his empty glass. “Or want to swap out for something else?”
He swung his head round to fix Harry with the most loathsome glare I’d ever seen, which, honestly, is saying something, before turning his attention back to Mum.
“You would,” he challenged, smirking up at me. “You’d still love me, but you’d not be happy about it.”
“You don’t use conditioner, do you, Potter?” I accused, glaring at him. No wonder his hair was such a mess.
And, if not, Solo, the shop’s owner, was the friendliest, most enthusiastic helper you could hope for
We both worked in the Department of Mysteries, in the Thought Room. Hermione had transferred from the Time Room a few months earlier, and, after a few weeks of professional awkwardness, had developed a genuine relationship.
“Shut up,” he snorted, jabbing his elbow up and back into my shoulder playfully. “Way to kill the mood, Malfoy. Good one.”
“Clumsy oafs who wear their hearts on their sleeve,” Draco added with a smirk as the four Gryffindors in the room bristled.
“Come here, over this way,” a firm voice called out, and I turned to see the barman, a friendly smile spreading across his wrinkled face, beckoning us towards the bar.
“Erm. Thanks, Dudley,” I replied earnestly. “So, erm, I think you were… maybe going to ask what sort of jobs wizards do?”
I licked into his mouth, then moved to nip along his jawline, his neck, sucking and biting to mark him again, his moans and thrusts upwards only encouraging me.
“Any chance of having that conversation in your bathroom?” he asked, eyes sparkling hopefully. “A shower sounds wonderful, and I was thinking I could probably use another lesson on how to shampoo properly.”
“Merlin, you look incredible like this,” he murmured, and I practically purred at his praise, pushing against his hands to open me even wider.
“This is amazing,” Harry was laughing, glancing left and right as though trying to take in all the surrounding sights at once.
Merlin, thankfully, was feeling a tad merciful this evening, and an absolute miracle occurred as Draco and Pansy went to fetch our second round.
“How many times have you fantasised about this, Potter?” he demanded, still fucking me, slowly, in time with the dildo, hands twisting in my hair to hold me in place. “How many times have you imagined being fucked in both holes at once? Is it everything you wanted it to be? Should I have called another bloke?”
“But, if it’s actual love, the obsession will eventually die away. It’d have to so that you could continue to function and carry on with the everyday. You’d still be in love, clearly, but able to function as two individuals, one complementing the other, correct?”
A short while later I was seated at the table unpacking a bag of savoury curry, plates and cutlery zooming towards me from the kitchen.
I, however, saw the slight tic at his eye as he mentally prepared himself for the grilling he was sure to get from our darling Pansy.
“No, Draco,” I managed to say as I settled myself on his lap once more, hands tangling in his hair. “Don’t you dare.”
the Tri-Wizard cup together, so they'd both win, 'cause they finished at the same time and they'd been helping each other out a bit, but the trophy was a
My Draco, who woke beside me — on the mornings I was lucky enough to rise before he did — adorably rumpled and pitifully squeezing his eyes shut against the sunlight.
He assured me that he did, and our evening continued, the three of us discussing and planning a meeting between Draco and I, and my, apparently, very magical little cousins.
“The koi, swimming upwards, represents a struggle,” he said. “Something you must persevere against, but that you face it with honour and strength.”
up with something very important, from the sound of it,” Pansy drawled, rolling her eyes and flicking her wand so that more drinks zoomed out to Blaise and Anaïs, Pansy clearly knowing their “order” without having to ask.
George, true to his word, had immediately smashed the Bludger at Charlie, who executed a perfect somersault midair and whacked it over to Bill, who was flying towards the makeshift goals with Harry on his tail.
That nagging little voice that always popped up whenever Ben, or Boston, or anything that made me think of either.
All too soon, it was time to leave, and I stood reluctantly, giving a heartfelt goodbye to our chef and the rest of the staff as we exited to allow the next dozen lucky diners to have their sushi breakfast.
“Please,” he moaned, hand still grasping my wrist as his arse worked itself slowly up and down my curling fingers.
“We get out into the field. Work with our Muggle counterparts. Do what it takes to solve this, obviously.”
I mean the most ridiculous, contorted faces you could imagine, and the fact that he would pull them out of absolutely nowhere.
“She and Fleur are having their own ladies' night,” he answered, grabbing three of the pints the barman set down. “Figured there’s enough baggage being unpacked tonight without adding those two to the mix.”
“Tell Molly and everyone I’m really sorry,” Harry was saying, free hand tangling once more in my hair.
“Well, might as well round out the meal,” I sighed, picking up the sushi and lifting it towards Draco. “Cheers!”
“You’re lucky you’re so damned good-looking,” Harry grumbled, straightening and pulling his pint towards him.
His head was thrown back, eyes closed, biting at his bottom lip, absolute bliss etched across his face, and in that instant I understood.
“It turned out great for us. You both lost a ton of points and then we absolutely creamed both of you when it was our turn to play.”
beaming at Harry,” she added with a smile and one-shouldered shrug in our direction because if someone
“She was a receptionist,” I added, unsure as to whether or not Williams had seen that anywhere in her journals. “So I don’t think we’ll be able to investigate anything until Monday, which will give us the weekend to go over the file Michaels sends tomorrow.”
We all laughed as Draco made a show of sliding his arm around my shoulders, giving our chef a pointed glare.
know that neither you nor Harry actually needs to work, right? I mean, between your inheritance and Harry’s quidditch earnings, I’m sure the two of you would survive.”
“What? You asked for my honest opinion,” I reasoned. “Consider it a warning to be careful in your silly potions room.”
Malfoy’s eyes made another casual once-over of me, taking another sip of wine. Eyes pausing at my half-hard cock rising between my thighs before snapping back up to meet my gaze with a knowing smile.
and we might have time for you to watch my hands do much more interesting things before your cousins arrive, so focus, will you?”
“Definitely not confident,” Ron added, although he almost broke character and sniggered because Draco, Blaise, and Pansy were, probably, three of the most confident people I knew of.
“I think Pansy’s worried about me,” I drawled, opening my texting app and sending Pansy a quick message to let her know I was okay and to leave me and Harry alone for the rest of the day.
I growled, arms still bound above my head, and retaliated by commanding the dildo to twist and pick up the pace.
“Draco,” Harry sighed again, one hand caressing me, gently running from my temple, rounding the curve of my head, and tracing down my back before starting the cycle again.
I didn’t answer, merely just kept sliding my mouth down Malfoy’s length, swallowing him eagerly, relishing the taste and musky smell of him as my nose buried itself in his pubic hair.
“Just go get dressed and you’ll find out,” he promised, nudging me gently off his lap and shooing me towards the closet.
“Don’t. Even. Think. About. It, Potter,” he warned quietly, eyes watching my hand that was reaching out for the cover, eager to reveal whatever decadent treat lay beneath.
Draco rolled over, pulling me down on top of him, slowing the kiss, that talented tongue of his delving into my mouth and retreating, coaxing me to follow him back to that unhurried, almost lazy exploration of lips, mouth, teeth, and tongue he’d set out earlier.
“Because… because it just is!” he shrieked, eyes blazing furiously. “Other people use this space and expect it to be clean!
“What?” Harry demanded, removing his apple from his mouth, soaked from head to shoulder, glaring at me, still dry.
Blaise had assumed I was seeing a muggle, mostly because I’d almost exclusively dated muggles since the war.
“Really, this has got to be the most perfect punishment for him,” Harry confided, arms snaking around my neck and pulling me down for a quick smooch.
Draco, in true, huffy-Draco fashion, had only responded by Accioing a giant, ancient dictionary at me and storming off to read on the sofa.
He accio’d a couple of bottles of water to him and spun around, shocked, as one of them zoomed past him into my waiting palm.
The conversation continued until Harry and I had finished our drinks, and I stood, smiling politely down at them as I shrugged into my cadet blue coat, then held up Harry’s black one for him to slide his arms into.
“I know, darling,” I answered. “And know damned well that you have me, but I need to know how you want me.”
“Not anymore,” Draco agreed, eyes trailing slowly over me and I blushed a little because I’m sure anyone who might have seen Draco’s face at that moment would have had no doubt what sort of thoughts he was entertaining.
“No one else gives me cock the way you do,” he added, leaning forward to press his cheek to my thigh, eyes opening to gaze up at me before turning his head to give my inner thigh a nibble.
“Honestly, Draco. You’re being a tad dramatic, Luv. It’s not like you’ve never been in love or had relationships before,” I reasoned.
And now, thanks to the Wizarding world having adopted the wonderful muggle mobile contraptions, she had them all right here, to show off to anyone, at any time, anywhere.
“Erm… yeah. I made sure to…” he began, then broke off, the pink in his cheeks, incredibly, rising higher.
Suddenly, Harry stiffened beneath me, his arse clenching so tightly around me that I barely even noticed his nails raking down my back and legs clamping around me with such intensity I just knew I’d have bruises tomorrow. Hell, for a week, at least.
I’m sure it was silly, and ridiculously touristy for anyone who’d lived in Paris, but I was still in awe of the beautiful tower, all lit up with twinkling lights, from our dinner cruise a few nights earlier.
“It wasn’t until that night when that stupid bitch Ethel jumped out of her window, and you figured out that she’d looked at the wrong person, that I put it all together.”
“He even flung water at me… like… this weird Muggle invention where water blessed by another Muggle is
He unscrewed the cap from a bottle of whiskey and began to take a swig, straight from the bottle, because of course, he would.
A few moments later, I inhaled deeply as the scent of lavender added itself to the warming layer pervading the room.
in a sumptuous lavender-grey and burgundy damask with a luxurious scarlet velvet sofa set against one wall, facing the bedroom.
“I wonder, Malfoy,” he sighed, pulling away completely to sit on his heels, eyes watching me carefully. “I wonder what it would take to render you the same?”
“That’ll be our cue as well,” Charlie said. “I’ve got to head to the apothecary to pick up a few things.”
Next second I was staring at a withered old wizard, his watery blue-ish eyes gazing back at me, a slightly familiar smirk in place.
“Mm-mm,” he shook his head, setting a hand on each of my thighs and pushing himself up to look me in the eye.
“Bet you two weren’t expecting to be in the middle of this on your one weekend down in London, hmm?”
“I’m still struggling with the part where I tell him I actually like him,” Harry sighed. “If I’m going to be entirely honest, I’m still struggling with telling
“Not as much as I love you,” he replied between kisses, our tongues licking lustily into each other’s mouths, bodies grinding and sliding against each other, slowly, as though they knew we had the entire bloody day to argue this out.
When I was sure we were far enough from shore and away from prying eyes, I reached a hand into my pocket and withdrew two shrunken water bottles, both filled with a mimosa mixture and cast with a cooling charm to ensure they stayed nice and chilled.
“Then you’d better get started, hadn’t you?” he asked silkily, threading one hand idly through my hair.
The damned Snitch itself seemed to have gotten bored, maybe even a little confused, as to why I kept flying towards it and not catching it that it took off for a bloody three hours.
call because I’d wanted to see her, see her reactions and gauge what sort of situation I might be in that way.
“He grew up right nearby,” Charlie said. “I remember him as a little kid who used to tag along after Bill and me.”
what he does, but,” I paused again, trying to think of the easiest way to explain an Unspeakable to Dudley.
We settled easily onto the couches and were nearly through our round of drinks, talking and laughing, when the doorbell rang, and Draco untangled himself from Harry to go answer it.
We arrived at number seventeen moments later, heading down the stairs to the entry of Pansy’s lower ground-floor flat.
It had been for work, so he couldn’t share certain details, but he’d certainly enjoyed the food, and by the time the queue had advanced so that we could finally make out the doors, with their square, purple, traditional sort of Japanese banners, I was genuinely looking forward to my first experience with sushi.
“How’s that work?” Ben asked, frowning. “I mean, no, like, for real, I get the using me to try and distract Draco part, but how does that help them out?
“And we used a tracking device Draco’s mum had put on him to locate them and bring backup,” Ron explained.
All of us looked a little guilty, actually, none of us thinking to see how Malfoy was handling the realisation that there was a bloody lunatic obsessed with him.
He then shrugged the left shoulder of his jacket off and rolled up the sleeve of his t-shirt to reveal the most stunning, vibrant tattoo.
“They eat chocolate pastries for breakfast?” he asked, chewing happily. “The French have really got things sorted.”
3. The good news... upside? Is that I now have several chapters (almost) ready to post, so promise not to leave no activity for nearly two weeks!
“Clearly,” she agreed, shuffling her own papers into a neat pile. “What do you say we go have lunch? I’m ready for a break, too.”
But clearly he’d seen something in Ben that I never could, because a few nights later, Ben was back.
“No offence, team,” Ron said with a little grimace, looking over his shoulder at where Ginny, Harry, and Charlie
“I always know all the answers the teachers are looking for,” he informed me. “They think I’m very smart.”
He led us up a flight of stairs, proceeding to explain how the Japanese baths worked and pointing out where they were located on the first floor, before taking us up another flight of stairs and stopping before a door.
“Harry,” I murmured, trying to move out of his embrace, if only for a few seconds. “You have to let go. Just for a moment, kitten,” I soothed.
witty comment one would have expected from Fred, his voice wavered slightly and the smile he offered his brother was rather shaky.
What had really got the Ministry’s attention, though, was a few weeks ago, when a few wizards had attempted to rob Gringotts and yet another band had infiltrated the actual Ministry itself, and had attempted an attack on Minister Shacklebot.
“Not only are they the minority, but you’ve got two of the most powerful wizards in Britain lookin’ out after you.”
we ended up, we’d probably not be having such a lovely outdoor space in order to have enough room for the two of us, a newborn, and the third guest bedroom Hermione was insisting upon for when her parents would inevitably come to visit from Australia.
“Sure, ok,” Harry’s voice sounded distant, as though he’d also placed us on speaker and was now searching around for something.
The last time I’d really seen him was at his trial before the Wizengamot following the war. I’d testified to help clear both his and his mother’s name.
“It’s just a summons. Nothing to worry about,” Draco assured him, pulling him into a hug, and I couldn’t help but think that a summons didn’t sound all that reassuring.
“Draco struggles to see the difference, sometimes,” Harry ground out, eyes still latched onto me, and mine on him, my teasing having gone just a tad further and more intimate than I’d meant for it to.
I responded by groaning and shoving my arse back into his face. He continued with the lapping and the sucking and the tongue-fucking, his moans and groans only feeding me to grind back and up.
“What does a butler even do, anyway?” I asked, sitting beside him, drawing up one knee so I could turn to face him.
“Shut up, you stupid bitch Muggle!” Williams retorted, wand swishing down towards her, and I turned to deflect whatever spell he’d thrown in her direction when I realised I shouldn’t have even worried.
At that same moment, I heard a gasp that I would have recognised at any point, at any time, in any place in this entire bloody world, and my cock literally withered and slipped from Harry’s body almost immediately.
“Just for a minute or two,” he bargained, still caressing me, one hand gently petting my left side, the other carding reassuringly through my hair.
Could you imagine thinking you were madly in love with someone only to find out you’d been broken up for four years?
The way he would arch up into me, arms and legs twining around me, eyes sliding shut, the sweet gasps and delicious moans slipping from his mouth as I plundered it with my own.
...” It seemed to be the only sound I could muster, having now progressed to that stage of drunkenness where consciousness was barely a reality.
Merlin, had he never heard of gender-neutral pronouns? We had no idea if this person was male or female, or honestly, at this point, even human.
I didn’t pay him the slightest attention, continuing to lick and suck at the parts of his cock that I could reach with Draco’s hand holding my head the way it was.
We’d gotten so in the habit of pretending it wasn’t there, ignoring the memory of that pesky brat who had been left on our doorstep all those years ago.
“This place is famous — there’s probably already a line, and it’ll be at least an hour before we get in.”
It was even better than I could have imagined and I tilted my head back to rest in the crook of his neck, taking in our reflection in the mirror I’d conjured to stand before us.
“What, even if it’s, like, two am, and we decide we need cherry-flavoured lube or something dumb like that?”
“And we all thought we had the best idea, but Miss Raegan said we had to work together, otherwise we’d never get our tipi up.”
“Nasty crime, that one there,” he answered, peeling back the foil from one of the several small bottles of champagne that Pierre-Yves had thoughtfully placed in a bucket of ice for us to enjoy.
We sat in silence for a bit, watching as Jim on the telly rallied his co-workers to participate in a hilariously kooky version of, what he called, Office Olympics.
He pressed his palms into my arse then, spreading me open as he took just the tip of his tongue to trace along the seam, his sigh of contentment barely audible over my groan as I thrust back, urging him to continue.
Draco threw his head back, laughing, then straightened, pulling me into an embrace which I tried my best to struggle against.
Hermione and Draco launched into a (far-too-detailed-and-boring) explanation of glamours, while Micah, bless her, nodded politely and sipped her pint.
around the dining table with a steaming bowl of chicken tagine heaped over fluffy couscous and a small side of the delicately diced tomato salad that accompanied nearly every meal in Morocco.
Pansy threw her head back and let out a peal of laughter before staring back at Blaise in disbelief.
“It’s a shame we can’t Apparate there. We could just head over next time we have a row,” Draco continued, smirking down at Harry. “It’d be fun
“Well,” Ron mused as we made our way to the entrance. “I’m still happy for our kitten and your dragon, even if this is going to be a bloody long weekend for us all.”
Correct. It’s definitely dark magic that allows the purchaser to cast the app into their intended’s device.
Next second, I felt the rounded head of a dildo pushing gently against my opening, and Malfoy slowly pushed it in, twisting and turning it.
, and the noises he was making as I darted my tongue in and out between my thumbs spreading him open were positively vulgar.
“We could leave,” I reminded him, stopping and turning him to face me, our arms instinctually wrapping around each other.
I would never say it aloud, of course, but I was certain she’d planned to fall pregnant when she and Duddy were first dating, just to sink her hooks into him so she could continue to pull him away from his poor mummy.
I turned to him, taking in his adorably rumpled appearance, clad only in his jeans, and held out one steaming mug of cappuccino topped with a
“Thanks,” he said, glancing up towards the house as two brilliant blond heads appeared on the porch.
He was a cheerful, middle-aged man, just beginning to go grey around his temples and had been doing research in the Love Chamber for about a decade.
“And that’s all still beside the point,” I added, shifting my gaze over to Officer Mitchell, who seemed to have
Draco sniggered, eyes roaming over me, taking in the too-long trousers and the too-big shirt hanging from my small frame.
“I’m not even kidding. Micro-dicks are a thing. Look it up. He had no business parading around as a top with a dick that size.”
“Millicent Bulstrode had a crush on you?” Ron asked, looking even more horrified than he had when divulging his accidental nickname for Draco.
I was about to fold Harry into my arms and ask him quietly how he was doing when I noticed his t-shirt.
we could continue breakfast and get on with our morning, sending Pierre-Yves a quick text to thank him for the thoughtful gift, and to ask him to work his turndown magic with a little Valentine’s day decor for when Harry and I returned this afternoon.
” his name tore from my throat, anguished, not even sure what I was begging for, just knowing that I
Either way, he turned my face towards his, mouth capturing mine as he began to drive into me with renewed vigour, and, before I could even process it, I was convulsing around him, my orgasm tearing through me like a surprise ambush, leaving me gasping and scrambling and actually crying for more
“Fuck,” Blaise muttered. “If that doesn’t sound familiar.” He glanced over at Ron and grinned, raising his pint. “Looks like we’re going to be putting in some long hours, mate.”
I merely raised an eyebrow and gazed pointedly at his arse, working itself back and forth and he swore again, burying his face in his arms in an attempt to quiet his moans.
“I mean, on the one hand, Japan is, as a whole — and this is a very wide-sweeping generalisation — a very traditional country,” Draco began, and I silently berated myself for asking a question that I should have known would launch him into lecture mode.

I couldn’t tell you how long we stood there, hands roaming, tongues seeking, and I briefly wondered if my new favourite activity should be kissing Malfoy.
“Oh! You have been here long time, already!” he gasped, looking at Draco and I worried. “You should leave your bags here this morning!”
“Some of us care how we appear in public,” Draco sniffed, adjusting his suit sleeves, and I couldn’t help but notice that his hair
His eyes were closed, yes, but he was biting his lip in an effort to quiet the moans that threatened to escape his mouth due to the ministrations that his left hand was delivering.
“Can you imagine?” he demanded, suddenly leaning out of Draco’s grasp, giggling as he looked around at each of us.
“Irasshaimase!” the staff in the open kitchen area called out the standard restaurant greeting, smiling, as Harry and I entered the brightly lit, sparsely decorated space, taking a seat along the row of benches that faced the kitchen where customers sat, patiently awaiting a seat at the single counter that surrounded the kitchen area.
it. It was sexy as hell,” Harry confided, arms coming up to wrap themselves around my neck, and he leaned in again to brush his lips with my own, and I gave up on the whole trying to think and gather my thoughts plan.
I used his body’s momentum to lift his arse up and forwards, gently urging him onto all fours before me, another moan rising from his throat as he arched his back again, pressing against my hands that were now stroking down his cheeks, prising them apart.
Each establishment held a maximum (I’m guessing) of six to ten guests and was manned by one or two workers who were skilfully turning skewers of grilled meats or some other incredible street food, pouring drinks, and mingling with the guests.
“No,” he corrected. “I’m sorry. That’s not what I meant… just… realised that I probably ought to take him out sometime.”
“So Coach called the team Medi-Wizard to have a look at me,” I continued, cringing at the memory of Dickerson examining me.
I tangled my hand in his hair, pulling just so, angling his face so that I could push deeper into his throat and he groaned again, hand sliding just a bit more quickly up and down his cock.
“I need you to watch for me,” I added, pressing another chaste kiss at the sweet spot between his hole and his bollocks.
“Oh-koh-noh-mee-yah-kee,” he repeated, slowly. “And it’s pretty much whatever you want it to be… it’s a savoury pancake-like batter and cabbage that’s grilled, and you pick from a variety of add-ins and toppings.”
Harry whacked another Bludger at Bill with such ferocity it left us with no doubt that he’d brought his A-game and was not easing up just because he was playing against a bunch of amateurs.
A birthday cake with a single magical sparkler spurting out colourful sparks was floating alongside Lucius, and was, clearly, the object that had caught little Draco’s attention.
“Morning, how is everyone? Hungover, as usual?” Bill asked as he entered the kitchen, carrying his youngest, little Louis.
“Well, now we know we’re both real,” I retorted, also rubbing my forearm. “Any other theories, genius?”
“Do you like my hair, mum?” Callum was asking, grinning up at Alice. “Even the best dye you’ve got in your shop won’t come out this nicely!”
I couldn’t suppress the giggle that escaped at the realisation that Draco’s fastidious nature extended even to his work glamours.
“What in Merlin’s name do you think you’re doing?!” I squawked, jerking him back towards me and away from the water like it was a fucking Dementor.
a minute!” I demanded with a gasp of shock. “Is this all just a ruse to get me to marry a Muggle and make Father even more proud?”
She smiled at us, although I’d seen my mum smile this sort of smile often enough to know it wasn’t a real one.
So much so that I yelped when I felt a lubed finger probing at my arsehole, pressing gently, then more insistently.
“Don’t worry, you will soon enough,” I assured him, succeeding, somehow, at ignoring the mental images of introducing Harry to his new toy and remaining focused on flying towards the goal, eyes scanning around me for a Bludger or Charlie or Ginny.
“Excuse me, but…” it said hesitantly from behind Blaise, and I froze, turning towards the owner, thanking my fucking Slytherin upbringing so I knew
“Hey!” she exclaimed pointing excitedly and grinning again. “You’re the… you’re the potions-Godfather dude!”
I gave one last glance up at the house, honestly, curious as to what the bedrooms looked like and wondering how I might sneak an excuse to see one.
“I see,” I agreed, nodding, but not moving away from him in the slightest. “And does she like it when you kiss her?”
“But one of their locations is along the Canal St. Martin, and, if the weather’s warm enough to cast a warming spell without causing suspicion, they’ll deliver it to us along the canal and we can eat it there — it’s
Malfoy continued lapping and curling his tongue deep within me as I tried to fuck back into his filthy mouth, especially when his tongue would withdraw slightly, his mouth sucking lingering kisses into my hole.
“You can’t ever leave me. Not you,” Harry was muttering, teeth tearing at my neck, causing me to groan and arch up into him, the explanation I was about to toss back at him going foggy and disappearing from my brain.
“Look at you,” I continued, “still grinding yourself on me and moaning like it’s the most amazing thing you’ve ever felt.”

when Callum and Teddy caught sight of a group of children around their own age pressed around the display of a shop a few doors down.
Truth be told, the old bully in me wanted to give them more than a talking to for pushing Alfie to the brink of tears, but the adult in me knew better.

A few minutes later, Draco and I were outside a room with another one of those double-panelled rectangular curtains that I was thinking were typical of an entryway in Japan.
were the one enjoying it, groaning in pleasure, before sliding up to lap or swirl his tongue at the head, sometimes giving it a brief suck.
He was fit, gorgeous as ever, not that this was any surprise to me, as I’d seen his stupid face and stupid body plastered all over Wizard television and on numerous souvenirs for the Montrose Magpies, where he’d been playing as Seeker for the past seven years.
“I mean, maybe he is… but he’s not eating lunch,” I snorted, making a mental note to grill Draco relentlessly about his mystery man when we met up this evening.
back, giving me the perfect opportunity to lick, and nibble, and suck bruises along his neck and jawline.
conversation and very little walking involved. You’d have to ask Harry to be sure, but it might have been worth his while.”
“Hey, Lucius!” George called out a few minutes later, he and Fred grinning down at our end of the table, looking so much as they had in school, that even I teared up a bit despite the mutual dislike we’d harboured back then.
“It was pretty bad, Harry,” Hermione answered for me, and I seriously regretted having talked to her or Ron that day. “You sounded
He turned his head to peer down at me over his shoulder, body still held in that stupid stretch that made sure I could see just how fucking gorgeous and un-fucking-adorable he was.
And I melted into him as warm hands cupped my face, tongue licking into my mouth, drinking up my groan of surrender as one hand slid around to tangle into my hair and pull me closer while the other slid down to trace along my chest before reaching beneath my jumper to tug it over my head.
He could have just found me a goddamned avocado and a plain old regular egg, and I would have been ecstatic.
“Ron and Hermione are already here,” Blaise informed us, watching as Harry’s gaze moved to our left to take in the reception room, where Blaise and Anaïs’ school trunks sat in a neat stack behind the tan-coloured leather sofa and little Hugo’s toy motorcycle sat in the corner.
Anaïs sighed, rubbing at her forehead and shaking her head in mock disbelief. “I ask myself who I am married to, sometimes?”
I took a deep breath and let it out, definitely ignoring the fact that I was once again looking towards my left (but dammit, was I really that obvious?)
This time, I held out the “seduction” heart, a bright scarlet coating covering a white chocolate shell filled with dark chocolate ganache and raspberries.
“What, you mean like that?” George was yelling, making a grab for the Quaffle, wrestling it out of Charlie’s grasp and lobbing it over to me.
I entered my apartment in a rage, hurling my coat onto the floor and sweeping my arm along the small dining table, taking no satisfaction in the mess I created by doing so.
“No, it’s just, we placed bets on who was going to be at the door, but it’s all four of you, so no one wins,” Harry explained, standing and waving a hand at the dining table and…
“It was,” he agreed, nodding emphatically as he gave another hop. “It tasted different from the kind mummy heats up from the tins when I’m sick.”
“But first we’ll need to get you ready,” I reminded him, reaching a hand down to circle my prick, watching as Harry’s eyes darkened even more
Ethan Trilby, a thirty-seven-year-old wizard with dark hair and equally dark, sharp eyes, who worked in the Apparition Test Centre.
So… this is love? I mused, eyes landing on Draco once more across the crowded hubbub of the Ministry’s New Year’s Eve gala.
Potter’s hands reached out and began to trace aimless patterns up my thighs, around my waist, across my arse, all while sucking and lapping contentedly at just the tip of my cock.
“Oh, it’s a fortune-telling game,” I explained. “You take the apple peel and throw it over your shoulder and whatever letter it forms
“C’mon, Potter,” he begged, looking every bit the eager child asking to open a Christmas present early. “Do you prefer white or red?
There was a giant sunken tub, complete with jets, on the left side of the room, set before two giant floor-to-ceiling windows that had been bewitched to show rolling emerald hills dotted with farmhouses beneath azure-coloured skies, puffy white clouds drifting lazily along.
“But fear not, we’re going to get that mother…” her eyes darted towards Hugo and Manon, both listening with rapt attention.
“Honestly, the two of you kind of make sense to me,” Hermione replied earnestly. “It explains so much about your obsession with Malfoy all throughout Hogwarts.”
around the wood we’d stacked earlier, shooting flames at it with their wands, George, unsurprisingly, being the most enthusiastic of the bunch.
Because, if I was being entirely honest, I had seriously misjudged how the memory of prepping Harry and gently sliding those three little balls into his tight, fucking
I desperately wanted to remember so as to be able to work him into a similar passion the next time I wanted a proper fuck without the endless teasing Draco usually seemed to favour.
“Honestly, if you weren’t so fucking mind-blowingly hot when you’re desperate and wanton, I’d probably be fucking you already,” I told him, and I was being honest. Still finger-fucking him, slowly as I could.
“Apparently I don’t see her enough,” he murmured, leaning back into me as I allowed my hands to continue their ministrations down to the tender muscles just under his collarbones. No one ever thought to massage a person here, yet there was always so much tension carried there.
Sometimes even during the week, and I’d had to wonder if he’d given any thought at all to where his bed was placed in the studio he was occupying.
Honestly, I hadn’t been able to stop myself from giving him a cursory glance, even as he’d tried to pull Draco.
They weren’t hitting him, I noticed, just zooming around him and chasing him like a pack of angry flies.
And by the time we’d finished all that decadence, we decided we definitely needed an additional walk to take in the graffiti art along the rue Ordener that the café faced before meandering our way back towards the Sacré-Coeur, keeping our eyes open for any restaurant that caught our eye for lunch.
the Pont des Arts towards a gorgeous cobalt-blue barge, its glass-covered ceiling and antique-style lanterns already assuring me that Pierre-Yves had done well.
Still, I couldn't resist leaning in to kiss him and decided I quite liked the combination of treacle and Harry.
Thankfully for the both of us, Mum had seemed quite taken with our story of a modern-day blind “date” (although, as Harry had predicted, she had raised a questioning brow when we’d called it a date and had refrained from asking any details as to what had happened on that first date), that had turned into a modern-day fling, and, was now well on its way to becoming something much more.
Anaïs said something to Blaise, swatting at his arm, and I didn’t even need to understand French to understand she was
“I mean, it seems to have come to a bit of a standstill,” Hermione admitted, pulling some files out of her briefcase. “Ever since the attempts on Gringotts and Shacklebolt.”
It was Charlie, staring up at the buildings and the sign announcing the title of the movies showing.
“Fuck Harry,” he agreed, hands gently guiding me down his torso, not allowing my mouth to linger too long on any particular area until I was trailing lazily along his hipbone, tongue gliding down the sensitive juncture of his groin as his legs wrapped around me, guiding me towards my ultimate goal.
“What brings you to this corner? Surely you have better things to be doing than tolerating the company of two surly old men?”
“Or maybe it’s what comes of living in the city. You’re all too obsessed with looking like those stick-figures in the magazines and on the telly.”
Not when Harry was practically screaming in pleasure, hands raking through my hair, working with his sinewy legs to pull me into him as his hips fucked desperately back into my face, his hole opening and grasping readily around my coiling tongue.
again, am I?” he demanded, sliding his body up mine, eyes glaring down at me indignantly as his right hand slowly wrapped around my aching prick, loosely circling it as he ran his hand gently up and down its length, barely touching it.
believe it,” I growled several minutes later as we exited the small, sinister alleyway and returned to Diagon Alley.
“You absolute twat,” he chided, clambering over to straddle me, mouth capturing mine for a languid kiss. “Always have to get exactly what you want, hmm?”
I began to thrust slowly, still not giving him all of my cock, but deep enough to graze the back of his throat, and I had to close my own eyes when I saw Potter lean forward, greedily, moaning as he tried to take even more.
“Mm-hmm,” I managed, nodding hastily, and Draco, thankfully, trailed his other hand down my back to grasp the butt plug, tugging it gently until all three balls slid free, me gasping and moaning pitifully all the while, because holy fuck, those balls were wicked.
“Maybe it’s because it’s me?” Malfoy asked finally, grey eyes staring up at me from between my thighs, mouth still working at me and I groaned and almost came on the spot.
“We took bets on who was going to show up next,” he explained, swinging the door open, allowing us to step inside as Pansy and Draco rose from their seats to cross the reception.
“Not dramatic,” I replied, chasing after Harry’s tongue as it teased and taunted my own. “Soothing.”
Harry and I," I muttered, almost under my breath. "Holed up in that tiny London flat with nothing to do but antagonise each other all day long…
Growing up with six brothers, her family assumed, had made me absolute shit at arts and crafts, but had gifted me a liver of steel.
“Dudley,” I began, trying to find the words. “That's… honestly… the nicest thing you could have said to… I dunno… fix our childhood?”

“You kicked a bloke out of your flat after bringing him home because he didn’t quite measure up....”
If anything, his weekend trysts had only renewed my desire to strike up a conversation and work up the courage to ask him out again, but, aside from the occasional glimpse across the lobby of MACUSA, I never saw him.

They were enthusiastically singing “Happy Birthday” while baby Draco looked up and around at them in a sort of befuddled awe, this clearly being his first birthday, and I realised with a jolt that, when this photo had been taken, I had still been living at home with my parents at Godric’s Hollow.
“The wand chooses the wizard,” he continued, smiling at Callum and Teddy. “Not the other way around.”
cause it was just the Cannons, sorry, Ron,” I said, automatically, knowing Ron’s feathers were ruffled without even looking.
I couldn’t really disagree. Truth be told, I’d rather liked the way my name sounded with his accent.
“I’m sorry, Hermione,” Draco drawled, an absolutely delighted smile lighting up his face as his arms tightened to hold Harry flush against him.
I gave another questioning glance across the coffee table at Ron who shrugged and made an “I have no idea” face.
What it would mean for her if Draco had actually been evil all along and was now showing his true colours.
and so we ask how are we supposed to play, and Draco just casually says, ‘Oh, that’s just for buggering Harry on’,” she finished, collapsing in giggles and leaning against Ron, and Harry groaned as laughter rose
And then Draco had pulled me close, whispering to me all the obscene things he’d wanted to do to me the next time he had a chance, and what the bloody hell else was I supposed to do besides Apparate us somewhere when he’d had me nearly cross-eyed and panting with need?
“Anyway, I’ll leave you two,” Knott was saying, eyes glancing over me disdainfully once more before flicking back towards Blaise.
“I think,” I replied, staring at the stack of journals and papers littering her bedside, eyes narrowing. “But….”
“Why?” Draco asked, swishing his wand again, and a chocolate tart came floating out as the rest of the dishes cleared themselves and whisked back to the kitchen.
insisted on doing his research before greeting me properly, he’d crooned out “Let’s Get it On,” with an exaggerated gravelly voice and almost comical gyrating of his hips, followed by “I Wanna Sex You Up,” complete with an operatic rendition of the super-high voice the singer sang in that had left me collapsed in giggles, Draco’s “negligence” completely forgiven.
Harry still had his eyes squeezed shut, but he gave an emphatic shake “no” of his head to answer my question as one hand stretched out to tangle in my hair.
“Anyway,” I said pointedly, looking through my own notes. “We’ve another meeting with Davies and Williams this morning. Since you’re of the opinion that the information they provided last time wasn't all that helpful, is there anything, in particular, you’d like for us to discuss today?”
have done anything to cum right then, and I almost laughed as I thought how easily Voldemort could have defeated me if only he’d known that Draco Malfoy’s cock was the secret weapon.
“It’s Harry Potter! It’s really him! Did you see how he caught that Snitch in record time last year?”
“Paris has a ton of these gorgeous covered passages, and we can see some of the best ones on our walk back.”
When he finally detached his mouth from my arse, his tongue was instantly replaced by three of his fingers.
Familiar territory between us. I couldn’t suppress the shudder of desire that coursed through me at the picture he was as he sent me another smirk that would have had Salazar himself cowering in a corner.
Callum’s wand was next on the agenda, and Alice and I traded looks of mixed awe and confusion as Hermione and Draco
for every Malfoy born since the estate had been founded in 1066, and I had noticed the seven ash trees outlining the perimeter of the Burrow almost instantly when Harry and I had first Apparated there.
“We’ve got everything you’ll need as a First Year,” Mr Greeves agreed, turning towards the shelves and bins.
It was only a few minutes before I was groaning around a mouthful of decadent caramely-toffee followed by a sharp swirl of the apple-scented brandy.
“You don’t happen to have a spare lying around, do you?” I asked hopefully, glancing around as though a toothbrush might magically appear.
Harry works through his frustration at having been revealed as "Kitten" to their mates followed by breakfast the next morning.
“Don’t worry one bit,” Alice assured them, finishing her glass. “Just gave us an excuse to have a quick afternoon tipple, which I never say no to.”
I shrugged and watched the spider as well, remembering how I used to line them up and race them in my cupboard as a child when I’d been locked up for some punishment or other.
“Would you ever have believed that the six of us would meet for weekly pints?” I began, and he grinned over at me, already knowing where this was going.
“Anal beads?” I asked, frowning, even though a significant part of my brain was warning me not to get too cocky and relaxed about Draco’s
“Although I suppose, with this new leaf I’m turning, it would be in my best interest to learn more about them, fascinating creatures as some of my former housemates seem to think they are.”
Harry was glancing down at the menu, and I couldn’t help but take in the sight of him, dressed in the plum-coloured suit that I’d insisted he shell out the Galleons for, reminding him teasingly that he’d once asked me to “help him look like shit,” and that this suit would definitely help him towards that goal.
He finally added another finger, twisting them deep inside of me as he raised himself to rest on his right elbow beside me, grey-blue eyes slanting down to meet mine, pupils all but swallowing the thin ring of colour still visible as he continued to pump those deliciously long fingers in and out of me, twisting viciously every now and again, causing me to arch upwards, begging for more.
“Is she really going to make me tell every gory detail of this story?” I whinged, and Blaise chuckled.
I reached down with my right hand to cradle his head, lifting it upwards just a tad, easing myself further into his mouth.
His eyes were wide, completely lust-blown, staring down at me, mouth slack, hips still working, almost absently.
Violet nearly took Draco’s eye out as she leapt up and wrapped her arms around his neck and I almost felt bad
“Hello,” he greeted, pulling up a barstool and sliding it next to Draco’s, leaning in as though to give him a kiss on the cheek, then drawing back uncertainly, glancing at the rest of us.
“Billiards table, hm?” Draco pondered suggestively amidst another round of laughter. “It would really set off those pretty eyes of yours, Potter.”
Platters of roasted pheasant zoomed over, along with bowls of warming squash and rabbit stews all accompanied with freshly baked pumpernickel and rye bread, and the conversation paused slightly as we
“Harry,” I was still chuckling and wiping at my eyes. “Merlin, I’m not sure the words piety or innocence are even allowed to be mentioned in the same sentence as you….”
His wife was tall with friendly brown eyes and dark hair who, judging by her immaculate appearance and perfectly coiffed bob, would get along smashingly with Draco and Blaise.
“Don’t mind Pansy,” Blaise drawled, taking a sip of his pint. “She’ll do anything to get attention from a fit bloke.”
Pewter, silver, copper, collapsible, exploding (what the actual fuck?), and even some made of solid gold.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Draco replied, purposely avoiding her gaze, not even trying to sound innocent or contrite.
“Which one’s the best one?” he asked, as another tourist boat came into view, chugging by, Harry still waving far too
“Sorry, Hermione,” he apologised as he came stumbling through our office door, almost tripping in his haste to get to his desk, managing to look clumsy, even, as he wriggled out of his coat and sat down.
He chuckled, and I thought that maybe I'd groaned this last bit aloud as he untangled my hands from around his neck and took a tiny step back, eyes darkening as they raked over me.
Not that Draco couldn’t handle it — he was tough as nails, — but his pale skin made even the teensiest bruise stand out.
Everything, where Harry was concerned, kicked me into overdrive and took me to extremes that I hadn’t even imagined existed.
“Raw egg,” he replied, smiling up at our server, who placed a steaming pot of tea and two teacups before us.
“Is that what you want?” I asked, still kissing, wondering when, exactly, Harry had come to be seated in my lap, my hands running all along his back, and I vaguely wondered if there were rules about snogging and propriety so close to the Queen's bloody backyard.
How one part of my brain was still managing coherent thought, I’ll never know, but I suddenly had the image of what Harry looked like, body moving above me, the rocking of his hips causing his muscled torso to undulate, one hand reaching out in front of him, alternately stroking and clutching at my chest, the other set behind him, hand tangled in my hair, balancing his weight between the two as he continued to glide forward and back.
Here, she fixed both Draco and me with a pointed stare, and I had to admit to myself that both of us sometimes spent too much time discussing details.
I made another unintelligible sound and returned my face into his neck, breathing in the scent of cedar and liquorice, the barest hint of roses. I buried my nose deeper into Malfoy, inhaling, and caught further notes of dusky amber and sandalwood.
Violet scared me, and even though I hadn’t met her, I just sort of envisioned her walking around like a miniature Professor Trelawney, which should have been comedic, really, but
I think Draco had enjoyed himself, but I got the feeling it wasn’t something he would have planned to do on his own.
He spent an almost torturous amount of time worshipping first one nipple, head dipping down to press a reverent kiss on my sternum, right near my heart, before moving to the other.
“I’m not trying to do anything,” he insisted, still managing to continue kissing me and I could feel his arms straining as he tried, yet again, to lift his hands against the magical bonds I’d cast on him.
“There’s something innocent and child-like about carrying a balloon and waiting for pizza,” I agreed. “Even though I suspect neither of us
“You two!” she scolded, and I burst out laughing because Harry and Draco were both cowering and staring up at Pansy fearfully.
So, of course, I pulled out entirely, taking an obscene amount of pleasure in the way Harry cried out, head spinning round, emerald eyes gazing at me wildly.
“Ravish?” I asked, leaning down once more to press lingering kisses along Harry’s jawline, his overnight stubble tickling my lips.
Inside, there were rows of low, wooden tables with little square pillows for diners to sit on the floor; each table had a large, flat grill and several diners were attending to circular piles of battered goodness or dumping little bowls over the grill that turned into piles of battered goodness.
Normally, I was nothing near resembling a cum-slut, but, as usual, wherever Harry was concerned, I found myself decidedly pushing extremes.
“You can see that?” he asked, turning his head first to look at Violet, then back at the brick wall.
“I don’t know,” he mumbled, still clutching at his belly. “I feel weird and clammy and like I might throw up.”
“You want me to be the actual worst mate a bloke could have, I can up the ante and absolutely do that!” I threatened, mostly in jest.
Instead of having the effect Harry had hoped, little Hugo gave a frightened little gasp and clutched at Blaise a little more tightly.
But I’ll be damned if my mouth couldn’t keep itself separated from his, and I found myself leaning down, hands tilting Draco’s head so that I could kiss him more deeply.
Was there anything quite as annoying as banging one’s shins on a coffee table? Blindfolded, hands bound, and with a dildo up your arse, I might add.
before the one in the middle, a younger man that looked to be about our age, with boyish features and an impish grin — held out what appeared to
I stared at him, enjoying the blush creeping upon his face, and took a sip of wine, just to keep him waiting that much longer.
I picked up one of the menus and held it up so Harry and I could both look at the boozy teas on offer.
Harry blinked up at me, clearly not having transported himself back to his hormonal, teenaged self at Hogwarts yet.
“Would you?” he asked, righting himself and pouting while scratching absently at the back of his head.
she now knew we loved her, no matter what, and that she could share with us all the things she was experiencing, magical or not, it still sent a chill down my spine that my baby girl could see these things.
Place for a bit, finding the familiarity of the place comforting as I reflected on my relationship with Draco.
“Takes you long enough,” he countered grumpily, earning himself another smack before I gently tugged the second ball out.
“I could help chop the veg for the salad and the… whatever that word is you keep saying after chicken that we’re eating.”
Or, the creator of the potion and related charm needed to place both the Mirror of Erised app on your intended’s device and the monitoring app onto your own.
“If any of you come across a lad or lass who loves camping and living in the constant shadow and flames of dragons, please, introduce us.”
We were nearly at the end of the alley, about to enter the courtyard that led back into the pub when my daughter spoke up.
I was already thrusting up and back to meet the slam of his hips with each thrust and I again reached my hand down to grab at my dick.
“I might have deleted the app weeks ago,” he said finally, arms wrapping around me, tucking my head into the crook of his neck once more.
“Okay,” Hugo agreed nervously, sounding as though flying with Harry “next time” was the absolute last thing he wanted to do.
“They’re all obsessed,” Draco insisted. “They’ve hardly any idea what day or month it is, even. Anything outside of the person with whom they’re obsessed. That’s it. It’s all their brain can focus on.”
And, much to Callum’s dismay, it appeared wizard children still had to take exams similar to what we had to endure in the Muggle world.
He measured a generous pour of whiskey into each glass, then handed one to me while cradling his own in his hand, a slightly predatory look on his face.
“Oh. My. Sweet. Merlin.” Potter was gasping, hands reaching to take the mobile from Mum so he could examine the scene playing before him.
I glanced at Harry and Ben to see what they were making of his confession — both were staring at him curiously.
He tried to scowl up at me but ended up collapsing again in a fit of giggles, face turning up at me, decidedly
He moved, spreading my arse open with just one hand so he could trail one finger lovingly down my crack,
My hand was shaking almost uncontrollably as I clicked it open, and I couldn’t stop the anguished cry that tore from my mouth when the app opened and I saw my own face, winking and flirting with Harry.
I yawned and accioed some blankets, casting my cooling charm around myself as I pulled the thick comforter around us, wrapping my arms around
“Well,” he straightened, reaching for a face towel. “How would you know you preferred me all mussed up if you’d never seen me all done up properly?”
“It’s fine,” I encouraged. “Honestly, there’s a good chance nothing will happen, and if something does, it won’t damage anything.”
head worried? I’m sure it’s not the last one,” he finished with a lascivious wink that sent a little thread of desire curling in my stomach.
“You can mix it with soy sauce or katsu sauce, if you want to cut the strength of it a bit,” I added, pointing to the array of sauces on the ledge before us.
I knew full well Harry could have figured out what I’d said, but he turned his attention back to Hugo, whose little chest puffed up importantly.
I only offered him a completely unhelpful innocuous stare as I helped myself to another bit of marrow and toast.
, but today all I’d been able to think about was how bloody gorgeous Ben was and imagine the two of them rolling around in the sheets — which, honestly, under different circumstances — would have been hot as fuck and
