“Well,” began Harry. “We-that is to say, me and Ron and Hermione- thought you might be the Heir of Slytherin, so Hermione brewed Polyjuice Potion and Ron and I turned into Crabbe and Goyle for a night. Hermione accidentally used the hair of Millicent’s cat, that’s why she couldn’t join us.” Harry snorted, shaking his head. Draco stared at him, mouth slightly agape.
“Yeah,” said Harry dryly, snatching his glasses off of Draco’s face. “I really didn’t know, thanks so much for telling me.” Draco smirked and Harry rolled his eyes as they stood up.
“That was nice of McGonagall,” he whispered, his lips brushing Harry’s ear. Harry shivered a little at the sensation. Kissing will have to wait, though. This is not the place for it, he thought resolutely.
“You’ve already packed?” he asked in surprise, spotting Draco’s trunk sitting closed on his bed. Draco nodded, leaning against the wall.
Harry pulled himself into a sitting position, bracing his hand against the warm stone floor. His elbow ached where it had hit the ground when Malfoy had pushed him off. The room is still wreathed with tendrils of smoke, and he can hear people coughing. Malfoy’s sitting with his head between his knees a foot or two away, his back to Harry, whose head is still spinning. When the explosion first went off, he’d fallen over. When Harry had tried to get back up, he’d tripped over something and fallen on Malfoy.
He hadn’t gone back to that clearing since he’d returned to Hogwarts, and he didn’t intend to. He didn’t need too anymore.
Draco grabbed Harry’s hand, and they Apparated back to Hogwarts. There was fresh snow on the grounds, making everything bright and beautiful, and Harry inhaled the cold air with relish. Draco snickered, pointing at a group of distant figures by the lake, their shrieks echoing across the water.
The class went by fairly quickly, and as Amelie had described they each took turns instructing the class on a random subject, and at the end they took a pop quiz to determine how much they’d comprehended from each mini-lesson. Harry found it vastly different from his normal classes, but interesting and engaging. When it came to his five minutes, he set up something similar to the DA, demonstrating the Shielding Charm and then having the class practice, walking around and offering pointers and tips. Everyone seemed to enjoy it.
Professor Eagry began to move through the classroom, pairing up students. To Draco’s annoyance it wasn’t by desk seating.
“No it isn’t,” he teased. “Maybe for your delicate Gryffindor senses it is.” Harry smirked back, letting his eyes wander over Draco’s face until the Slytherin had a slight flush in his pale cheeks. Harry leaned in slowly, grazing his lips over Draco’s softly, barely touching, before pulling back and continuing to walk to class. He glanced over his shoulder, grinning, and saw a blushing, indignant Draco catching up with him.
Draco sighed and cautiously breathed in the fumes, blinking at the warm air. Vanilla....something sugary….and the smell of wood and leather, like Quidditch equipment. Suddenly he blanched. It was treacle tart that he was smelling, that was the something sugary. He’d smelled it enough times at dinner to recognize it. Draco scowled, leaning back from the steam. Well, now there was no question. He was smelling Harry.
Harry and Ron are seated on either side of Hermione, with Sue Li and Padma Patil nearby. They all watch apprehensively as Daphne tugged Malfoy over to them, and the two awkwardly sat across from Harry.
“Lumos,” Harry said, and in the resulting glow peered at the Map again. Malfoy’s name on the Map was almost in the forest, for Merlin’s sake. Harry let out a great sigh but walked forward into the darkness that surrounded the castle, once the torches that adorned the front door were out of sight. His wand was the only glow, and the night was surprisingly quiet as Harry tramped down the grassy hill, seeing the faint shine of the lake beyond him.
He was drunk, and he never got drunk. But he’d been so fucked up over Harry, and then he’d seen Amelie and Harry together… and his mood had dropped even further. So he’d
“You passed out, though.” Hermione said with amusement, and Draco ignored her. He got out of the hospital bed and walked over to Harry, who stood up to meet him with a small smile.
Draco stared at himself in the mirror. His dress robes looked alright, and he had managed to get his blond hair the way he wanted. His “hygiene stuff”, as Harry called it, seemed to have payed off, as his skin was clear and soft. Draco sighed.
Harry strode over to Seamus, who Dean is trying to restrain. “What the hell, Seamus? Why are you attacking him? What’s going on?”
“You know, Hermione invited me to study with her this weekend. All the girls from my dorm, actually. We all have Arithmancy together tomorrow.” Daphne adjusted her bag strap. Draco made a noncommittal sound as they turn a corner. “You don’t like her much, do you?”
“But let’s remember to use our indoor voices, alright?” added Amelie, and Harry pressed his lips together to keep from laughing.
They talked for a little while longer, then Harry went up to the dorm and Draco took one last stab at finishing the last couple of chapters of the book, sitting by the flickering fire. He heard a tapping noise on one of the windows, and went to go open it. A chilly wind swept in, making the flames dance, and an owl swept in as well, a letter clutched in its beak. Draco took the letter and the owl flew back outside.
“Yeah, me either. Unless you count ballroom dancing, but I don’t think waltzing is something you do at a club. I’m not very good at that, either.” said Draco. Harry laughed.
“I was thinking about it. On top of- of the scar. So I can associate it with something else.” replied Draco. Harry saw his right hand again twitch toward his left forearm, then Draco’s fingers curled and he rested his hand in his lap.
“Oui, faisons-le!” exclaimed Camille, clapping her hands. Draco smiled, for once thinking about Potter, but solely wanting to beat him. Instead of talk to him, be near him, kiss him…Focus, you dummy, Draco scolded himself.
“Draco, my darling, you’re already enrolled.” said Narcissa Malfoy, flourishing her wand at a pair of robes, which settled themselves on top of the contents of his trunk. “Besides, you don’t want to be stuck with your mother in house arrest, do you?”
“You didn’t cause their deaths, Harry.” The sound of his name on the other boy’s lips was startling, but oddly comforting. Welcome. Draco continued. “They made their own choices. Turned down their own paths. It’s not your fault.” Harry blinked fast. Draco’s words resonated, and Harry gave him a small smile.
As the Slytherin had also asked, Harry hadn’t drawn attention to Malfoy’s disappearance. Hermione and Ron had questioned him at lunch, but Harry had said, truthfully, that he didn’t know where the blond had disappeared off to. Harry had seen Daphne Greengrass looking worried, and remembered how she’d greeted Malfoy the last time he had come back from a day of being missing. She probably knew more than Harry about where Malfoy was, but like him, chose not to fuss about it.
Telling himself that didn’t change the way they looked. He felt so helpless. Two of his closest friends lay frozen and he had done nothing to help them. To stop them getting this way.
Harry’s mind was filled with questions, and after reading the letter once more, he promptly had to sit down and take several deep breaths in an effort to recover.
Draco grabbed Harry’s arm and pointed upwards, silent and shaking. Harry looked, seeming to come back to himself to the sound of countless dog-sized spiders creeping over branches, a thousand sets of eight black eyes staring at them, dropping slowly from the canopy on shining white spider silk.
Daphne looked scandalised at the thought, while Hermione just looked disgusted – whether with herself or with Daphne, Harry didn’t know, but he, Millicent, Pansy, and Tracey all burst out laughing at once.
, the ceiling collapsed. Harry jumped to one side and had only a second to see Blaise grabbing Draco and Pansy to jump the opposite way before huge chunks of rock dropped between them, sending a mini earthquake through the ground with the aftershocks.
Really, Harry just didn’t want to move from his incredibly comfortable spot next to the fire in the Common Room, but he didn’t say that out loud – he didn’t care to be laughed at on such a fine day.
“Snape’s right, though. He has total authority over the Slytherins,” Harry explained with an uneasy shrug, before quickly changing the subject.
, he never wanted this, he wished he’d waited for Draco and Blaise and Pansy and hell, even Ron would be nice to have on his side right now, because the twins were frantic over their sister’s declining state and Tom Riddle – Voldemort – looked as solid as Harry himself now, and since this was Harry’s life and it could always get worse, Tom faced up to Salazar Slytherin’s towering stone face, and spoke in Parseltongue:
“Good job everyone!” Gemma was saying from the senior end of the Slytherin table. “Seven years running – we are officially awesome!”
Harry felt Blaise’s eyes heavy on his face. He felt cold, all the fire of his anger having just been used to propel the false ‘celebrity’ into the wall of his own office. Lockhart was barely managing to lift his head, dazed. Harry did not lower his wand, and Blaise had yet to say anything, so Harry simply continued.
“Oh, come here, you idiot,” he demanded, voice wavering and eyes suspiciously wet as he strode towards Harry for a hug.
“Professor-” Harry began, ready to attempt to explain – for the bird, for Justin, for anything, but Dumbledore simply raised one wrinkled hand.
Harry nodded his acquiescence, and when it became clear that Vernon had nothing else to say, turned back to his preparation. To the outside world, Harry was as passive as usual, but inside his mind was racing. Harry was rarely allowed out of the house – only for school, gardening, or to be left at Mrs Figg’s house when the Dursleys were going away – and for Vernon to let him out on Dudley’s birthday was highly unusual. Petunia and Vernon were taking Dudley to the zoo with Dudley’s friend Piers Polkiss, and Harry was
But time crept slowly forwards. The nights drew in, pupils and parents stopped by to purchase supplies for Hogwarts, and gradually, almost imperceptibly, Draco began to feel as though this

for… you know…” Draco’s voice trailed off; his mouth feeling foreign, unable to shape sentences and completely disconnected from his brain.
Draco smiled, slow and lazy, skirting around the side of the counter. “Please do. I like a challenge. But anyway, Potter, did you just pop by to hex me, or…? Tell me, to what do I owe the… pleasure?”
For the next few days, in idle moments, Draco could hardly think of anything other than Potter. Imagination augmented by
Draco pulled the duvet up over his arms, curling onto his side away from Harry. For the first time he could remember his head felt clear and his heart light. He fell asleep to the soothing sound of steady breathing beside him.
A flash of light caught his eye, and he spotted the Snitch again, flitting here and there high up over the middle of the pitch. Malfoy was closer but, as usual, wasn’t even looking. Harry frowned. Making one more catch couldn’t hurt, could it? Just to make certain they had a really good points cushion. Then he’d take a breather, guilt free.
“It was just after I’d visited the Manor for the first time,” said Neville. “I only mentioned it in passing, but he wanted to know literally everything – how you looked, what you’d been doing, all the things you’d said. He got all morose, and said he’d been wondering about you since he saw you at your trial. That – oh, Merlin, he’ll kill me for saying this – that he’d been thinking about why it was that he’d always been a bit… preoccupied with you, and that he thought he might be… well. That he might want to try dating men.”
Draco began seeing the Mind Healer Hannah had found – using the very last of his savings to do so – and little by little, his anxiety and low mood began to recede. The world around him – which, since coming off
Neville launched into an account of his most recent brewing disasters. The rest of the afternoon passed swiftly as Draco took him through some basics, Neville writing down pointers on a hastily Summoned piece of parchment while Itti flitted around them, refreshing the teapot and Vanishing plates.
Up until this point Draco had remained a tiny bit amused – nostalgic, even – at Pansy’s teasing. But this? This was a step too far. He rose from his seat. “I
It seemed to take forever, but eventually Lila finished her ribs, sitting back and licking her lips slowly, in a most unsettling manner.

“Oh, do shush, Draco. What you actually mean is―” she turned to Potter “―yes please, Harry, that would be
“No, no. Of course not. I was just wondering.” They fall silent again, watching as a fat pigeon pecks around the bin next to them, before strutting over to the bench. Draco kicks out at it a couple of times; it’s undeterred, going for some crumbs just next to his well-polished shoes. A subtle repelling charm from up Draco’s sleeve sends it skidding a foot across the pavement, squawking indignantly. Harry laughs outright then, and Draco looks at him, his own mouth curving into a wide smile.
doing, the raid? The very idea made him break out in a cold sweat. But after a few minutes of panic, he managed to dismiss the thoughts as paranoia. After all, he hadn’t forced anyone to do anything illegal, had he?
“I don’t know, really. I don’t think… I don’t think wanting came into it. I didn’t think about whether I wanted it, it was just something that I knew would be expected of me, when the time came. I didn’t look forward to it, if that’s what you mean. I had seen other people take it, I knew it would hurt, and―”
“I’ve been wanting to go for a while,” she continued, “but I didn’t know how to tell you. You see, I’ve… I’ve met someone, Draco, darling. He’s a very kind man, and I’d like to get to know him better, but I… I can’t do that while I’m living here. Where everything happened. Your father’s house.”
“Harry? What’s going on? What… what are you doing here?” The words felt tangled, heavy in Draco’s mouth.

With fewer layers between them now, Draco could feel Harry shifting his hips to create more friction, his hard cock obviously straining the fabric of his trousers. Instinctively, he tried to bring his thigh between Harry’s open legs, groaning with frustration as his thick robes got in the way. Harry recognised Draco’s difficulty and stopped moving, letting out a huff of annoyance. They both looked down at the same time, their foreheads bumping together. Draco stepped back to tug the heavy robes over his head, startled when Harry moved to stop him.
Draco nodded, a quick jerky movement, barely disturbing the air around them. There was something about the darkness, the silence, even the bedroom – the setting for so much that had passed between them recently – that felt almost holy. The last thing Draco wanted was for his clumsy, half-formed sentences to risk disrupting the moment. Harry didn’t seem to expect a response anyway, and after a short pause his low voice continued, drifting softly over to Draco’s side of the bed.
Potter smiled, vaguely. “Maybe once. But right now, it’s all you.” He stepped past Draco, coming to rest against the pillar that Draco had just vacated. Draco’s body instinctively turned to follow him. “Every witch and wizard in there wants you.”
It was good, thought Draco, distantly, that Harry seemed to have matters in hand, for Draco himself was completely lost, rendered incoherent once more – helpless, euphoric,
Yes, once upon a time, he’d felt truly missed. Pansy – allowed back at Hogwarts to repeat her seventh year – would send long, rambling letters; pages and pages of gossip he didn’t really want about people he didn’t really remember, studiously omitting any mention of the war. Greg’s owl had brought short, melancholic notes from Spain, where he was living with family friends and working as a magical housebuilder. Blaise’s missives had been frequent and hilarious, filled with convoluted tales about his mother’s latest conquests. Draco had even received a couple of – late night, and obviously drunken – messages from Theo, filled with a truly stomach-churning mix of wistfulness and pity.
So, first things first: how to avoid detection? His mother wouldn’t be a problem – even at her sharpest she’d been a master at turning a blind eye to those things she didn’t
! Come on, where’s the harm, really?” He gave Harry a cheeky wink, taking a step forwards. “It’s not like you’ve never done anything a little bit against the rules either, hmm?
Potter leant back, cold air replacing the press of his body, leaving Draco bereft. His eyes snapped open just in time to see Potter disappear through the door. He threw Draco a cheerful, “You should think about it,” before striding out into the rain without a backwards glance.
“Muggles,” said Draco, quickly, distracted by the sloppy, wet noises emanating from behind Harry, by the little grunts he was making as his shoulder moved. “Only Muggles. On
They sat down together on one end of the rotting bench. Draco stared down thoughtfully at the seat, where the names of hundreds of people were scratched roughly into the wood. Harry scuffed his feet through the old fag ends littering the grass, trying not to think about the warmth of Draco’s body against his, the contented hum he made as he exhaled, the familiar smell of his cologne. He chanced a quick sideways glance to find Draco watching a group of Muggles, grey eyes wide in the dim light. They were engaged in some kind of spitting competition, disgusting globs of phlegm creating little puffs of dirt as they landed on the road. Harry tried – and failed – to imagine Draco as a teenager, sitting in this exact spot. He felt a little off-kilter, as though the earth was shifting beneath him, and he closed his eyes, taking deep breaths.
Draco slid his hand over the top of hers where it rested on the chair arm, giving it a squeeze. She looked at it sideways, a smile playing at her lips. There they stayed, both lost in thoughtful silence. Eventually Draco stood up, running a finger over the frayed fabric.
Draco watched him, deeply regretting admitting to his inexperience, wondering how to take it back. But before he could say anything, Harry’s face cleared, and he resumed his movements, arm thrusting faster as he continued to fuck himself on his fingers. Draco couldn’t look away. “Well we’ve got plenty of time, right?” Harry said – to himself, perhaps – for
“Not at all,” said Draco, recovering himself finally. He dropped Potter’s hand and took a step back. “The shop’s pretty much ready. Just got the last couple of bits to sort out, then I’m going to get an early night before the big day.”
,” he reads. “D, so it must be someone else after all.” He laughs, lightly. “I suppose it is a fairly common name, at that.”
A grunt of acknowledgement made Draco glance quickly over to Harry. He was staring out into the living room, expression inscrutable under the flickering light. With practiced fingers, Draco used a match to light the hob. The quiet roar of the gas igniting drew Harry’s amused attention. Draco moved the kettle onto the stove before turning around properly, surprised when Harry shifted in his seat, eyes darting away across the room.
Draco’s out there, somehow, halfway up the steps, lounging against the wrought iron railings. Harry rocks back on his heels with a gasp – he can’t help it – instantly embarrassed to be caught here, of all places, for no good reason he can come up with. He wonders, stupidly, if by finally allowing himself to think of Draco after so long he’d accidently managed to summon him somehow. But no – Draco’s surprised too, although only someone who knew him as well as Harry would recognise the signs; the way his back straightens, the flare of his nostrils, the tightening of his grip around the rail. He looks brilliant, Harry thinks automatically, hating himself a little more.
It only took a minute before Harry’s movements became increasingly frantic, his grunts getting louder as he neared his climax. Draco ignored Harry’s half-hearted attempts to pull away, keeping up a steady pace until suddenly Harry thrust forward hard, letting out a loud, incoherent shout. Draco pressed his nose against the curls at the base of Harry’s cock, barely tasting Harry’s release on the back of his tongue as he swallowed around Harry with the ease of an expert.
All at once, the telltale whoosh of a Bludger sounded from below, clipping the tail of Harry’s broom and forcing them both to throw themselves backwards. Adrenaline flooded Harry’s body as he clung to his spinning broom for dear life, trying to regain control over its movements. Suddenly, a firm hand settled on the handle, pulling him forwards and bringing him abruptly to a stop. Harry could feel the heat from Malfoy’s body, and, on wiping his glasses, found himself mere inches from a pair of concerned grey eyes. They were both still breathing fast; Malfoy’s soft pants ghosting over his cheek. His heart was pounding so loudly in his ears that he feared Malfoy might hear it over the faint whistle of the wind, and all at once he found that he could stand the proximity no longer.

“That’s, uh, very chivalrous of you, Potter,” said Malfoy, with a grin. He brought the Snitch up between them, staring at it for a second, before wedging it into his pocket, sliding his filthy hand back into Harry’s hair and resuming where they’d left off.
Harry, would you please just give me one second to think?” Harry rolled his eyes, the corner of his mouth twisting up into a spiteful half-smile as he pushed straight past Draco, making for the house. Draco took a deep breath, praying the
When Malfoy had returned from New York, a year or so ago, to work at the Ministry – his office right next door to Harry’s own, no less – Harry had expected one of two things to happen. Perhaps Malfoy would be his old, annoying self – all bullying and bluster – and Harry would end up socking him one to shut him up. Or maybe he’d come back a changed man, contrite – or at the very least content to ignore Harry, hopefully with the good grace to avoid him in the corridors.
When he reached the threshold of the bathroom, he lay on his side, head against the door jamb, and surveyed the room. The cabinet with his
“Oh, like you wouldn’t believe.” It was true, although Draco had hardly noticed the change himself. He couldn’t pinpoint exactly when Lee’s lanky form had begun to soften and fill out; nor how her face had suddenly morphed from too-sharp adolescent awkwardness into striking young woman. All he knew was that one day she’d been stomping around the lab in Doc Martens, and the next he’d found her leaning over the counter giggling with the new boy from Flourish and Blotts, cheeks suspiciously rosy and skirt eye-wateringly short. It had only gotten worse from there, with Draco now regularly forced to eject potential suitors just so they could get some work done.
“Draco?” The voice was painfully familiar, and Draco felt a sudden chill. Humiliation twisted sickeningly in his midsection. Harry’s expression was achingly tender, his eyes soft with no hint of the anger from before, his mouth pressed together with worry, not curled in spite. Harry squatted down, laying a hand on Draco’s shoulder.
Potter laughed. “Fine, Draco. I’ll be your giddy pig. Merlin, imagine if my sixteen-year-old self could see me now.” He lifted himself up, unbuttoned his flies and slid the top of his jeans down on the left, leaning against the arm of the chair so that his thigh was raised off the seat. The wound
It made no sense! The sound must be moving, because it was definitely coming from the bathroom now. Draco let his hands drop down onto the bed in front of him, turning to the right to get a better look. He was slippery all over, sheets crumpled wet in his fists, and as he strained forwards to see, he fell onto his stomach with a groan.

brewed. The discovery and his plans had afforded him a new sense of purpose, and he hummed to himself as he wrote out two applications: one for the Diploma, and a second to expand the laboratory space.
While Draco gasped for breath, Crowson bent down and in one rough movement pulled up Draco’s left sleeve, displaying his Mark. “You should have been locked away to rot, like that scumbag father of yours. And instead you’ve come here to play a nice game of Quidditch? I don’t fucking
again – to take the edge off, while he figured out his next move. He couldn’t risk a repeat of the previous night’s rash overconfidence – certainly not when a band of Aurors could turn up at any moment to cart him off to the Ministry.
To the mods: thank you so much for your incredible hard work and for running such a friendly and supportive fest ❤
As Draco tried to move lower, to turn his careful attention to the skin visible at Harry’s throat, he felt something catch on the front of his robes. Leaning back carefully, he realised that it was Harry’s Order of Merlin, one of its points caught in Draco’s blue silk. He reached down, gently releasing it, now keenly aware of all Harry’s ornamental trimmings, the way the heavy rope aiguillette forced far too much space between them.
On they went together, spinning about the room, transfiguring lamps and curtains and furniture, objects flying past their heads until they were both panting with the effort and not one thing remained the same as it had been before. Eventually, Harry turned to face the last untouched item – Draco’s bed. The canopy and columns vanished in an enormous cloud of dust, and the creaking wooden frame stretched out at the sides until it had almost doubled in size. He glanced over at Draco, eyebrows raised expectantly as if awaiting an objection. When none was forthcoming, Harry snapped his fingers again, and with a final flourish, Gryffindor claret blossomed across the sheets. A gold trim finish curled around the edges to complete the look as Harry stood back, a smug smile spreading across his face.
With one last glare in his direction, Dennis was gone. Draco ran trembling hands through his hair, trying to catch his breath. He should leave – just pull out his wand and
getting a little tired. His arms, his back, his shoulders – they all felt slightly too heavy, as though readying themselves for the usual post-match ice bath. And his
“Only every day,” Draco said, truthfully. He shivered, suddenly exposed, and wrapped his arms around himself defensively, waiting for Harry’s response. But none came; instead, Draco found himself surrounded by a cloud of warm air, his frozen face tingling pleasantly. He nodded his thanks and was rewarded with a shoulder bump from Harry.
The heating charm must have worn off too, because Harry felt almost feverish with that early morning chill so familiar to him still from long nights spent on guard in lonely forests. Only this time he was far from alone – the shoulderblade poking sharply against his spine confirmed that, as did the pale strands of hair stuck to Harry’s cheek. The body pressed against his own gave a sudden shiver, the offending shoulder shifting as Malfoy stretched, extending his arms above his head with a slightly-too-loud yawn. Surprised, Harry wobbled a little, and Malfoy wobbled in turn, and all at once they were both wide awake.
“I’ve been called stubborn,” replied Draco. Harry just nodded, eyeing Draco’s pretzel curiously, before turning back to the game. But Draco noticed the way that Harry’s coffee cup, Omnioculars and programme were resting on the bench the other side of him, leaving a space for Draco that couldn’t be coincidence.
“No, you were absolutely right. I came here to support Lee, and instead of that, I’m out here, worrying about my own…”
“No, when I look at it now I’m concerned that it’s going to eat me. I’m not sure that’s any better.”
In contrast, though, some of the more recent Hogwarts graduates acted excessively nervous and formal around Draco, as though he were liable to start firing off hexes at any moment. At first he was amused, wondering what on earth Lee had said to them to provoke such behaviour. But when one of the girls mentioned shyly that Draco ‘seemed much nicer than it said in our History of Magic textbook’, he realised the unpleasant truth. Head spinning, and skin at once cold and clammy, he found he could no longer follow the conversation at all. He excused himself for a breather and wandered back out into the Atrium.
While Harry considered his reply, another couple joined them on the bench. These two licked noisily into each other’s mouths, the woman straddling her partner, which forced Draco to jump sideways until he was practically in Harry’s lap. He turned towards him, their noses almost touching now, expression partway between embarrassed and cross. Harry desperately wanted to kiss him. So he did, leaning in slowly to brush their lips together, just barely. Draco didn’t move, just took a shaky breath in through his nose, and Harry pulled away, suddenly unsure.
Draco was stunned. His mother had never indicated the faintest desire to leave the Manor before; had seemed rather hurt by his own abhorrence of the place.
Harry reached over without thinking, prised Malfoy’s fingers from around his broomstick and took his hand. Malfoy’s breath caught but he didn’t object, so Harry turned it over, palm down, fascinated. Malfoy’s fingers moved of their own accord, a flickering motion which spread from his fingertips across the back of his bony hand. As Harry watched, he could see the tendons working; could feel the quiver running up his own arm. He traced his finger along the ridges and valleys of Malfoy’s knuckles; pressed it into the soft spot between his thumb and index finger, unable to look away.
“Oh… that. Hang on…” Potter mumbled, without turning around. Clothes righted, he lifted his leg forward, bent his knee and rotated his hip experimentally. He made a small, pleased sound. “Amazing!” He turned back towards Draco, face lit up with a brilliant smile, although not quite able to meet Draco’s eyes. “I can hardly even feel where the curse hit. Merlin, thank you so much. Robards will be over the moon. You need to speak to St Mungo’s, right bloody now.”
hot – all over his body. There was a dry, intense heat in his throat and behind his eyeballs. His back, buttocks, and legs were burning up where they were touching the bedsheets, and his hair was damp with sweat. He grabbed a glass of water from the bedside table, draining it completely. He ripped off the covers and then his clothes in a panic and lay back down. Salazar, he needed to sleep. Why couldn’t he sleep?
After dancing for what felt like hours, Draco finally managed to escape the floor, where he was instantly grabbed by Hermione Granger and corralled into a discussion about the rights of Wizarding-Adjacents. After that, he was pulled aside by an old friend of the family, asking after his mother. While walking to the bar, he was accosted by one of the senior Healers from St Mungo’s, who started loudly extolling the virtues of Draco’s salve to his colleagues and everyone around them.
It was lovely but maddening, a giddy kind of torture for Draco, now knowing for sure what Potter wanted. During the day he could almost let

Draco – exhausted from days awake, tongue loosened by Veritaserum – started babbling immediately. His deepest secrets spilled out unbidden, barely sensible, echoing around the tiny room.

“I had no idea,” Draco said, slowly. “The way you’re speaking though… did he really like me that much?”
Lacking the focus that the N.E.W.T.s had provided, Draco drifted through the days aimlessly. He’d briefly reflected on his other talents and come up with only two. His childhood dream of playing professional Quidditch had already seemed laughable given the disaster of his Potions applications, and was even more ridiculous now after a year of lounging around the Manor stuffing his face with comfort food. And then there was Occlumency, which he had briefly considered as a foundation for a career in the Unspeakables, but which on further thought just reminded him of his Aunt Bella and made him want to vomit.
His face must have reflected his distress, as she hastily tried to retract her words. “Oh, Draco, no! Of course I shan’t leave, not if it’s going to be difficult for you.”
That Saturday, his first day sober in over a week, he received two owls. Both of them were unsolicited and quite unwelcome, and served only to intensify the headache which had been threatening since he’d lifted his head groggily from his pillow. The first one to arrive was a short note from Theo. It mentioned that he’d seen the article in the
“God, I hope this is the right flat,” Harry gets out, laughing. He pushes his trousers to his thighs just in time for young Draco to swallow him down, to wipe the grin right off his face. Harry makes a guttural noise and tips his head back, eyes closed, and it’s Pavlovian, by now, the way your cock is already fattening in your hand as you edge closer to them. Your eyes are fixed on Harry: the long line of his throat, the way his tongue darts out to wet his lips, the curve of his back as he arches forwards, completely undone. His moans grow louder as your younger self reaches behind him, greedy hands squeezing that firm arse in time with each impatient thrust. Everything seemed so urgent back then, the both of you always chasing each other’s pleasure: almost as though you
“…need your birth registered, of course,” said Bryn. “So I haven’t been able to keep a job for long. But, uh, hopefully that’ll all change now, after today.”
They were having a fine spell of weather, and the Manor gardens looked especially resplendent bathed in soft, hazy sunlight. On the morning of Neville’s next visit, Draco took his daily walk with his mother – conversation flowing especially well thanks to a little helping hand from
Eventually the roaring wind quieted, and Draco heard a tiny witch in the row behind shouting at him to move. He took a deep breath and sidled down towards Harry – past the cannon hats, past the happy couple. Harry’s bag was on the bench next to him, along with a pair of Omnioculars and a steaming cup of coffee, and so Draco stopped just before this, sitting down without preamble. He noticed Harry glance over at him, perfunctorily, reaching out to pull his Omnioculars closer, before doing an obvious double take, clutching his chest dramatically and gasping out a shocked laugh.
He hadn’t felt this powerful since… since fifth year, maybe? He’d been existing entirely, it seemed, as a hollow shell; only now, finally, was he being filled with the essence of the person he wanted so desperately to be. As the warmth surrounded him, suffused him, he felt his fears, his doubts – all his negative emotions – leaving him, one by one, fluttering away as though out of Pandora’s box. Never again would Draco Malfoy be seen as worthless, aimless, or cowardly.
; misfortune and even downright disaster as things overcorrected themselves. You were on it for much longer than any case study I could find, so it’ll probably take some time – but it
Draco nodded, helplessly, as Harry continued his ministrations, rinsing and wringing out the flannel again, and moving to wash under Draco’s arms and over his chest. Draco could only stare down at Harry’s hand as the stroking motions, the cooling water, and the rough feeling of the flannel overwhelmed his senses.
For example, right now he was – Harry adjusted his glasses and squinted through the fierce early afternoon sun – yes, there he was, leaning forwards on his broom, flying easy, listless circles around the perimeter. As he passed overhead for the third time, actually closing his eyes in bliss as he deliberately flew through a low patch of cloud, Harry’s irritation finally got the better of him.
Harry yawned, rubbing his eyes with shaky fingers as the long night finally began to catch up with him. With a sleepy but satisfied smile, he followed suit.
had made him write it, then he would send it and see what came next. It was, in Draco’s opinion, highly unlikely that Longbottom would even finish reading the entire letter, let alone arrange a visit to his former tormentor.
Were they talking about him? Draco wasn’t sure. It sounded serious, whatever it was, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. The hand was still stroking tenderly over his forehead. It felt lovely. He was just going to rest for a little while.
The long winter melted into a brighter spring. Flowers bloomed from window boxes, birdsong drifted in on the breeze, sunsets crept gradually later, and – not for the first time – Draco mourned the flat’s lack of outdoor space. Unwilling to be seen in public off
“But then the bosses came up with this exchange idea, and they were dead set on it, couldn’t talk them out of it. So I got back here, expecting Howlers and protests and Crup shit on my desk. And then I found out they’ve put me in the next office to the great Harry Potter, for fuck’s sake! So there went my last chance to convince people I’ve changed. How could I expect them –
Draco ran his thumb under the rim, disappointed. “I can’t. I thought you – I don’t drink anymore. Alcohol, I mean. You know. Regular coffee only.” He indicated his own cup with a nervous laugh.
All at once, the air around them seemed to vibrate, and Malfoy closed his mouth again, looking down in confusion. As Harry copied him, an enormous
“Fuck off, Russell,” echoed Harry, weakly, glancing back at Malfoy, who was rolling his eyes after the now-retreating Chasers. He turned back towards Harry, but didn’t quite meet Harry’s gaze – clearly, Harry thought, stomach sinking just a little, the moment was gone.
“So is pureblood knobhead, but somehow I manage to say it just fine,” she muttered under her breath. Draco almost spat out his coffee, shooting Neville and Potter a glare as they simultaneously collapsed into unrestrained hysterics.
It never arrived. Nervously, he opened his eyes again, only to find himself hovering, suspended, over the water. Draco began to float, still face down, up into the air. As he watched, the still surface of the lake began to bubble and swirl, before receding with a loud sucking sound, drawn down an invisible drain, until only the dry carpeted floor of his flat remained. Draco himself was moving, flying through the air, body still trembling helplessly, until his head landed back on his pillow with a jolt.
“Er, no?” says Harry, spinning around on the fold-up chair he’s managed to wedge out onto the tiny balcony. “Did you?”
“No, it’s – it’s strange, that’s all,” says the agent, wandering too slowly down the remaining stairs, hanging onto the banister rail, still staring at the board in his other hand. “Unless she’s made a mistake again…”
Malfoy tilted his head thoughtfully, staring off into the distance. Several seconds passed, and Harry shifted his broom away slightly, suddenly concerned. “You don’t have to – I can just…”
Draco nodded. He’d set boundaries early on in his use, and for a long time he’d stuck to them, even when
be stupid and reckless of us.” Then, before Draco could respond, Potter leaned forward, his hand running lightly from Draco’s shoulder up onto his neck, cupping his jaw. He moved so close that Draco could feel the caress of Potter’s breath against his cheek, could smell the last of the rainwater on Potter’s skin. Draco closed his eyes, powerless to resist, readying himself to feel Potter’s lips on his own.
Of course, the slightest mistake at any point in the process would not only render the potion useless, but also very likely fatal. In perhaps a concerning indication of his current outlook on life, rather than dissuade Draco, this concept held a bizarre appeal. He didn’t
Draco’s insides twisted unpleasantly. Harry’s words might have been teasing, but his voice held a note of scorn. Despite rehearsing this moment countless times, Draco somehow found himself speechless and gaping like an idiot. Merlin, how he missed the
Draco opened his mouth to protest, but Potter waved it away. “No, no, don’t get offended, I know you’re good at all this, it’s just… I’ve had a lot of experience with regenerating potions and spells, not to mention Polyjuice, and it’s mostly been… well, fucking painful, honestly. And
Harry snorted. “Same shit, different day. Loads of paperwork. Robards still paying me too much but treating me with kid gloves. You know.” He paused, thoughtful. “Or, at least, I think you know. Do you remember? Sometimes when I’m with you it’s easy to forget that… that all the stuff we talked about before wasn’t…”
, confident and strong: the polar opposite of how Draco felt about himself. It hardly seemed possible. Harry’s eyes were fierce with desire, and Draco wanted,
“Seriously,” said Draco, gently, “we can get out now. I can do this out in the bedroom, you know. It’s okay that you don’t want to be in here.”
and his spectacular orgasm had well and truly gone, leaving in its wake a sore head and a sense of embarrassment and unease.
A shout of surprise echoed through the flat, followed closely by the loud clatter of china breaking, a sharp intake of breath, and muttered, very familiar, swearing.
“I know,” said Draco softly. “I have too. By the way,” he said, gaining confidence, “I don’t remember if I mentioned it before, but you look incredible in that uniform. Really.”
“It’s normal, you know, the speaking thing,” Harry said, perching next to Draco, and running the flannel over his back. The water was lukewarm but left cool trails behind it as air hit Draco’s damp skin, making him shiver. “Hannah’s been reading up on it. The
At 3 p.m., as agreed, the entrance hall Floo flared, and Neville Longbottom tumbled out onto the hearth. He brushed his clothes off and straightened up, looking around apprehensively. Neville had grown taller – almost as tall as Draco – since Draco had last seen him. He wore his sandy blond hair short, his round face had sharpened out at the edges, and there was a few days’ worth of stubble on his chin. Draco had the overall impression of a calm, self-assured, and not unattractive young man, with no remaining hint of the awkward adolescent he had been at school. He was wearing Muggle clothes: a fitted royal blue sweater over grey trousers, and his expression was inscrutable as he turned to look at Draco.
“Hmm,” Lee mused, sprinkling a few crushed Billywigs into the bubbling solution. “I don’t know. There’s no way he’s forgotten. So maybe – maybe it’s some kind of test? Perhaps he wants you to prove you’re serious about him? Or maybe…” She broke off, biting her lip and frowning into the cauldron as she stirred.
Draco nodded, grimly, shivering as they wandered across the frost-covered lawn. As they approached the greenhouses, though, the air suddenly grew warm and humid, and he looked around in surprise. He was surrounded by unusual looking vegetation: an imposing silver tree laden with furry fruit, a cluster of small bushes whose branches bore bright flames instead of leaves, a seething mass of vines speckled with tiny round holes. As he watched, fascinated, a sweet-smelling viscous substance began to seep from deep within, pooling on the ground by his feet. Hannah tugged him away. “You want to be careful with that one.” She indicated the space around them. “This is Nev’s tropical bubble. I heard you brought one of those mood trees he’s always on about? Thought I’d show you where it’ll go, when it’s ready.”
He landed hard on his living room floor, crawling over to the sofa and sinking down against it in horror.
– in your thick anti-spill robes. On the beach, tourists and locals are sunbathing. A rollerskater whizzes past; nearly falls on his face staring.
Caught offguard, Draco paused for a second, face growing hot. Harry leant forward, brow furrowed, misinterpreting his awkwardness for reluctance. “Look, I promise not to yell at you this time.”
, he’d relished a little peace and quiet, burying his head in textbooks. He’d enjoyed the freedom to study for his N.E.W.T.s without pressure after the disaster that had been his sixth year. And of course, to begin with, he’d received news from his friends almost every day.
Draco turned around and rested his shoulder blades against the cool tile, body arching forward as he fucked into his fist harder and faster, until he felt his orgasm rushing up to consume him. Behind his closed eyelids, he saw Potter as he appeared in the
Harry chuckled delightedly, wiggling his fingers to make the water glasses on the counter dance a merry mid-air jig, before taking another bite of his ham sandwich. They’d been sat at the kitchen table in comfortable silence for a while now, Harry in just his pants, mustard dripping onto the plate as he chewed thoughtfully. Draco sipped nervously at his tea, everything coming back into focus as he warmed his hand on the mug and pretended not to watch Harry out of the corner of his eye. Harry’s foot rested on top of Draco’s on the floor, a small gesture of possessiveness which would probably set Draco off again if he thought about it too hard.
Draco huffed a resigned laugh. Before he could say anything, Potter stepped forwards, holding out a hand. “May I?”
A relieved smile spread over Draco’s face he realised – his eyes sliding a little too quickly back and forth from pygmy puff to hot dog, to pygmy puff, to hot dog – what he had originally missed. He focussed intently on the space between them. His mind began to fill in the blanks, and a familiar shape emerged – a silhouette against the sky, at first. As Draco watched, it took on colours, sharpened up, until all at once he could see Harry, sitting on the bench, match programme in hand. Even with the Notice-Me-Not, Harry had taken pains to avoid being seen – an enormous black and orange scarf was wound tightly around his neck, while a Muggle-style bright orange baseball cap sat incongruously atop his curls, brim wobbling alarmingly in the wind. He looked ridiculous and lovely, his head tilted to the left as he followed the teams flying their formation laps, and Draco could only watch him, stomach roiling.
“Add you to my wards?” Harry smiles, then, leaning back and gazing up at Draco, silhouetted against the grey November sky. “Draco, I never took you off.”
Draco scowled, straightening up and turning around slowly to avoid an unpleasant head rush. He could feel his face flushing, sweat beginning to seep from his pores, as he desperately sought to evade Harry’s gaze. Merlin, this was embarrassing.

“Good.” Harry rolled over towards him, the mattress shifting under Draco as he moved closer, meeting his gaze. Harry’s face was tense, his expression full of regret, but his eyes burned fierce into Draco’s. “No more
The hissing was getting louder now. In fact, it sounded like it was coming from underneath the bed itself. It couldn’t be anything good, whatever it was, thought Draco, abstractly. Had he left something unstable brewing down in the lab? He should really go and sort it out. Now, if only he wasn’t stuck to this damn bed.
Draco stretched his fingers down towards the glassy surface, leaning further and further forward, getting closer and closer until – yes! Abruptly, gravity took over, his body tumbling uncontrollably over the side. Draco closed his eyes, bracing himself for the cool splash of liquid against his cheeks.
“Everything’s changed, Harry. How could things stay the same once I started to remember what we were like? How much I looked forward to seeing you each week? How kind you were with Lee? The way you… the way you looked at me?”
Once Draco had broken his ‘stay sober on weekends’ rule, the floodgates opened. He quickly found that just having Saturdays off was not an option; within an hour of waking his head was pounding, and he felt suffocated by clouds of misery which followed him around all day. He’d lie on the sofa, under a blanket, barely able to move. Sometimes, he’d find himself imprisoned in his memories – hiding under the bed as Greyback and his friends staggered, drunken and snarling, through the Manor’s living quarters, or frozen on the ground with his arm trapped under Crowson’s boot. Sometimes he could picture, in vivid detail, being revealed to the entire world as a fraud. Often, he’d hardly make it to the afternoon before he’d find himself swigging enough Dreamless Sleep to down an Erumpent, and then crawling into bed.
A charity Quidditch match though, thought Harry, what could possibly go wrong? It hardly even seemed like a challenge – it was
Harry hesitated, bringing a hand up to squeeze the back of his neck, and for just a second, Draco thought he was safe. But before he could start to relax, Harry was moving again, his feet resuming their original path.
“Look, Draco,” Neville started, raising his voice to be heard over the hubbub. “No one is denying that you’ve had a rough few years, or saying that you haven’t paid for your mistakes. But you can’t ignore the fact that you hurt people. We were both really pissed off at first – we felt used and let down, not to mention pretty stupid. When we told Leonie, she just about wrecked the lab; I had to
Pansy pulled back, then, and Hermione followed her out of the memory, sparing one last, hopeless glance at the drowning man, before the living room reformed. Back in reality, Draco was leaning against the wall, his head tilted to one side, murmuring softly.
“Mmm.” Harry lazily rested his forehead against Draco’s with a contented sigh, closing his eyes in a post-orgasmic haze. Draco did the same, inhaling deeply. He could almost have stayed there for ever, except that… well, Harry’s chest was growing uncomfortably sticky against him. And there was a lovely soft bed just across the room.

, like arriving home at the end of a long, exhausting journey. After Draco there had been Ginny, and she’d always been too hot in bed to cuddle. And after her there’d been no one else Harry had even wanted to sleep next to, let alone hold all night.
He kept up the steady rhythm on his own cock throughout, only pulling back when Harry’s hands finally relaxed and fell from his hair, using his other hand to wipe the mess of saliva and come from his chin and grinning up at Harry languidly. Harry, for his part, was staring off into the distance, eyes glazed over. He looked, Draco was gratified to see, absolutely wrecked. His chest was heaving as he worked to catch his breath, his face was flushed and damp with sweat, and his body was slumped back against the wall, boneless. As Draco watched, hand still flying over his own prick, Harry bent his knees and slid slowly down the wall, coming to rest level with Draco.
, the first person to ever read my writing: your lovely comments gave me exactly the encouragement I needed, and to this day I’m so grateful that it was you who answered my message. And to
A sharp tapping started up once more. Draco craned his head to see round the cushion, and – yes, the idiot had indeed levitated a stone, which was now beating a merry rhythm against the antique glass. Heaving a deep sigh, he made his way over to the window once more, grasping at the ledge to steady himself as the whisky rushed straight to his head.
turned him into a risk-taker, always do-first-think-later, and while a complete change in personality had once seemed a bonus – who wanted to be Draco Malfoy, at this point? –he was beginning to find the loss of his own identity quite disconcerting. He didn’t even feel right when sober these days – more like a boring, miserable version of the old Draco, completely consumed by guilt and self-loathing.
Not so anymore, of course. He needed those memories, as soon as possible. He had no idea whether he had a chance of making anything work with Harry, but if he did, he’d need to do better than he had last time. Even if Draco decided to give up entirely – to try and move on – he needed the closure that those memories would provide.
have dropped a hint that Potter secretly has season tickets – as if I’d care, normally. But I’m sure with the right motivation I could…
He attempted to pull himself up. Blood rushed to his head, and the edges of his vision began blurring until he laid himself back down, panting. He could hear Leonie downstairs, opening up the shop, and he started to panic. His head was almost in a vice and he was sweaty all over, stuck to the bedsheets. What the hell was he going to do?
She tutted impatiently. “Of course I do. I used to help my parents with all the household stuff. I can brew just fine, provided the charmed ingredients are already sorted. Oh, and I got an A* in my Chemistry GCSE, which is basically the same thing.
He was being ridiculous – it was obviously Hannah or Neville. One of them must have forgotten something and Flooed in to get it. He listened again, torn between pulling the covers over his head and going to investigate, when the scrape of another chair followed by the sound of a cupboard opening made up his mind for him. He sighed, swinging his legs over the side of the bed.
slowly faded. Draco had the strange impression that the lights in the flat were becoming brighter, harsher, while the room was growing ever smaller. He could feel sweat gathering on his brow, and an irritating buzzing noise in his ears. Panic rose in his chest, the desire to take more
“Darling, no. I loved helping you. I’m so proud of your business – you know full well you were sending me far more money than you needed to – and besides, for a long time it was all that got me out bed. It’s only that – well, these past few months, it’s all become a bit much. I’ve been… lonely, I suppose you could call it, for quite some time. I’d rather like to

“Harry. Harry, please. Please, I want to – I need to – can we?” His voice was needy, perilously close to begging, and it was this which finally drove Harry to pull off, licking his swollen lips.
Draco squeezed the chair back tighter, his knuckles turning white. He tried unsuccessfully to keep his voice calm and steady. “Where the fuck do you get off, coming into my home and―”
Barely a week later, Draco found himself standing behind his cauldron, holding a tiny glistening vial up to the light. He checked it thoroughly, turning it over and over in his hand. Was the consistency perfect? Was that sediment in the bottom? But no – however hard Draco looked, he could find nothing to suggest that the potion would lead him to a sticky end. His
“I have no idea what I was thinking,” he mumbled, irritated. “If you’ll remember, there wasn’t a great deal of thinking going on at that point. Maybe… maybe I was fed up with hiding things. Maybe I knew it was all going to shit anyway. Or maybe, just maybe, I stupidly didn’t realise that I’d decided to sleep with the one person in the bloody world who could resist
thing. It’s refreshing, I guess, seeing a bit of fight in you. Ron and I were starting to wonder if you were actually the same prat from school, or if you’d been the victim of some Polyjuice takeover.”
“Shh, there’s no need to apologise. Don’t worry about that right now. Let’s just get you through the next few days.”
Draco forced his eyes open, turning his head slowly towards the door. From his current position, unless he craned his neck around the sink, he could only make out a pair of legs. He didn’t have to move, though. The Auror robes were unmistakable, as were the mismatched socks.
Draco stepped forward automatically – that inexorable tug he’d never been able to shake – but stopped as quickly as he’d started, suddenly uncertain.
“It’s fine. In fact…” His words tailed off, and he swallowed; but now was as good a time as any, he supposed. He tilted his chin up, affecting a confidence he didn’t feel one bit. “…In fact, while we’re on the subject, I suppose I may as well be up front about it. There were other things that seemed to come… naturally to me before – on the
, Harry had said, as though it was all that simple. As though no one else mattered. As though you could have everything you ever wanted if you just had the courage to reach out and take it.
Harry smiled. “Oh Merlin, yes. I hate these things. Ron will make my excuses. Reluctantly perhaps, but he’ll make them.”
Instinctively, Draco moved towards him. Harry’s pupils darkened with want, his breathing catching as Draco drew nearer and reached out, desperate to assuage Harry’s concerns. They’d done so much talking already, after all. So much waiting.
“I don’t know,” Draco said after a while, voice small and worn. “It’s just – it’s not how I remember it, I suppose. Or,” he looked up at Harry, eyes shining in the dark, “maybe it is, and that’s worse?” Harry wound a comforting arm around him. The cold was seeping into his thighs from where they touched the stone steps and he shivered, pulling Draco close against his side and handing over the ice cream stick for him to finish off.
Draco felt his face flame at the unexpected mention of Harry. And worse than that, he saw the very moment Pansy noticed, her beady eyes lighting up with glee. “Oh, Merlin,” he said, dropping his head to his hands. He may not have been drinking, but he was definitely starting to feel queasy.
He continued to walk the Crups with his mother each morning, went flying every afternoon, and he’d even managed to get ahead on the work for his Diploma. He’d applied to the Ministry for permission for Longbottom’s visit, which was speedily granted – probably, Draco thought, because they were crossing their fingers that Longbottom would hex him on sight.
Things might have ended there too – Draco alone, depressed and out of options – but for one chance discovery; a single stroke of fortune so great it eclipsed all that came before. Fate placed those eggs right in Draco’s lap, giving him the opportunity to reclaim the future he’d always been promised. In fact, as Draco told himself a thousand times afterwards, fate practically forced his hand!
, the only thing in the world that could compare to that feeling of absolute power. This – utter, mindless bliss – was everything he’d craved for so long; everything he’d been looking for in the arms of Muggle strangers, or racing around a Quidditch pitch, or at the bottom of a bottle.
According to the Mind Healer, it was better to attempt this kind of thing in an unfamiliar environment – she felt it would be less confusing for his brain when trying to consolidate old memories, and so in the end Draco and Lee Flooed over to Lee’s flat and settled themselves down on the sofa. He explained to Lee what he needed her to do – set the scene for him, help nudge his mind into reliving the events. Fortunately for Draco, she was the perfect candidate: her eagle eyes never missed a single detail, and she was both willing and able to remind him of many a conversation his
They sat on the top step of the rotunda overlooking the lake. The light was fading fast, the wind carrying the distant strains of excited screams as parents attempted to cajole, bribe or force their offspring away from the enormous adventure playground.
) and then, with a look of almost maniacal glee in his eyes, head straight for the box of jam doughnuts which was sitting on the side of Harry’s desk. Harry had watched, horrified and fascinated, as Malfoy had proceeded to polish off the very last one, licking the jam and sugar off his fingers, letting out a loud “Mmm!” of satisfaction, and tipping an imaginary cap to Harry on his way out of the door. Harry had stared after him for a good five minutes, wondering if some crazed fan had managed to slip something into his tea again.
―” Harry started, incredulously. Draco saw several heads turn from across the garden, Ron and Hermione’s among them. Irritated, Harry waved a careless hand, and all went quiet. He advanced on Draco, eyes alight. “You’ve got some fucking nerve, you know that?
seats, no less – perched high above the hoops, where you’d have to stand and crane your neck to get more than fleeting glimpses of the action. There were only a handful of spectators up here, and the screams and shouts of the crowd below were barely audible over the howling of the wind as it rushed past the wooden structure. Even standing in the centre, Draco had to constantly adjust his gait as the stand swayed from side to side, and there was a good-size heap of debris – programmes, drinks, a pair of glasses – sliding to and fro underneath the front bench.
By the next summer, you were both married. You’d left the Ministry by then, opened your own apothecary. You spent over a decade avoiding him, changing your usual routine, avoiding social events – and successfully too, until fate landed you both back at Kings Cross.
Draco shrugged, unable to speak. He felt as though he’d taken a Bludger to the chest, his mood plummeting from elated to shattered in just a few seconds. Harry must have noticed his expression, because he patted him on the arm, brow furrowed, eyes – to Draco’s horror – filled with sympathy.
been getting mixed messages? You’re the one who spent two years…” He cast his eyes down, running trembling fingers through his hair. “You know what? Never mind.”
After a few seconds, Crowson let out a grunt of frustration and began stamping his foot down, hard. Draco could do nothing except attempt to cling to consciousness as he listened to the bones in his arm splintering with each blow. Almost delirious from pain and fear, Draco could faintly hear an angry voice, which seemed to be getting louder – until finally Crowson took his foot off Draco’s mangled arm and pulled out his wand. He pointed it at Draco, but his heated words were directed elsewhere.
The Snitch had disappeared completely, leaving Harry staring at his empty palm in confusion. There was a loud snort from behind him, and he turned to find Malfoy, cheeks deliciously flushed, looking at him with barely-disguised glee.
The countdown ends, and the walls drop away, and you’re struggling to catch up as Harry takes long strides across the promenade, early evening sun glinting off the pavement. He makes a fist in the air, and your younger self emerges, glancing nervously around and shielding his eyes from the blinding light. They look completely ridiculous, the pair of them, marching along side-by-side: he still in Auror uniform, you –
“Okay, fine!” said Harry, amused, waving his hand in complex arcing motions around the room. There was a deafening sucking noise, followed by a sharp pop as the sink and the toilet jerked themselves forwards, leaving a trail of brick dust, broken tiles and plaster behind them as they wobbled across the room to swap places.
) had created a very profitable business which, Draco calculated, would soon need to expand its premises further. His reputation was improving by the day, with his potions working better and for longer than those of his competitors, and suppliers actively seeking him out to sell their ingredients. He could never have dreamed of such success.
Unfortunately, with it being a Sunday, and work being what it was these days, Draco had a whole batch of potions on the go downstairs which needed bottling and packing up, ready for the next morning’s post. He grudgingly explained this to Harry, expecting him to start gathering his clothes – perhaps, Draco thought, they might get in a quick goodbye shag, if he was lucky. What he
is still gaping like a fish –he’s once again the picture of cool composure, all the way from his shining silver hair to the pointy tips of his oxfords. Harry’s hands instinctively fly up to his head in a pointless, belated effort to smooth down his damp, flyaway mop of curls. Draco’s eyes follow him, and Harry swears one corner of his mouth curls up into the barest hint of a bemused smile.
in the past, but been quickly caught out when they’d found it impossible not to make impulsive and dangerous choices. Not so for Draco. So far as he could tell, every big decision he’d made had been logical, with no one suspecting any external influence. He felt certain that he could recognise an unwise decision and resist it, if required.
“That’s the point, though!” She pulled off her gloves, extracted the tiny phone from her pocket and waved it at him. “Why don’t you just get one of these?
Harry didn’t speak again. Draco felt a trance-like detachment. He hardly noticed Harry drying him off, casting a breath freshening charm, helping him back to bed, or tucking him in. But as he burrowed his head deeper into the pillow, fresh sheets cool against his body and the tube in his arm connected once more to some unknown Muggle concoction, he felt strangely at peace. He’d been off potions for two days already. He wasn’t in Azkaban. He hadn’t died.
Getting down to the front door was easier said than done, when one had consumed half a bottle of Firewhisky, had only one working arm, and lived in a flat with the world’s steepest staircase. Draco glanced warily at the stone floor at the bottom and began shuffling down on his bum, wand tucked into his trousers. It was only then that he realised he hadn’t even looked in a mirror since he’d woken up. He was barefoot and still wearing his Quidditch outfit, complete with bloodstains up one side. Brilliant.
Thomas regarded him curiously for a second. “Yeah, that’s good of you, Malfoy. I don’t think – look, I’ll let him know you stopped by.”
at Harry’s friendly ‘Alright there?’ Even Ron – deep in conversation with a blonde journalist Harry recognised from
the Mungo’s Chief Exec after all, and rumour has it she’s very partial to a younger man. Maybe this was all a business move.”
But things were rapidly heading that way again, he could tell. There was a constant ringing noise in his ears now, and he could barely concentrate on what Harry was saying. The silence stretched out between them. Draco was struggling to sit still, his calves twitching painfully, and he swung his legs back and forth, fighting the overwhelming urge to run to the bathroom for more
Draco gripped the back of his chair for support. His headache was reaching truly epic proportions, and he’d just about had enough. He had seen Pansy’s venom directed at others in school, and laughed along with her as she’d cut them down to size. But having it aimed at him?  Now that was an unpleasant development, and one he needed like a hex to the head.
Finally, Harry shrugged. “Well, what’s it been? Five, six months? Not a bad run. I shouldn’t be surprised – you’ve always been a stubborn bastard.”
Potter recovered so fast that Draco wondered if he’d been expecting the rejection. “Sure, sure, of course. Anyway, I should go. I’ll see you around, Malfoy.” He dropped his hands to fiddle with his belt loop, Draco’s eyes following involuntarily. “Let me know – er, about that, and about the reference. If you need it. Say bye to Lee.”
“Stay there.” Harry turned towards him, the urgency in his voice muffled by a thumb in his mouth. As Draco watched, he pulled the digit from his lips with a pop, indicating the floor. “Broke a mug, sorry.” Draco stopped dead, instinctively feeling for his wand. Caught short, his hand fell uselessly to his side as Harry took out his own, healing his cut thumb with a hiss before repairing the mug and replacing it on the worktop.
The match ended not two minutes later, the Snitch retrieved easily by the Wasps’ Seeker, and so Draco still wore the hint of a dumb smile as Harry collected his Omnioculars and Vanished his coffee cup. It disappeared, though, when Harry made to sidle past Draco and leave without a word.
, which left Draco in a much more chipper mood and feeling pragmatic about the whole encounter. He was better off without her – honestly, with friends like that, who needed enemies?
works, right? It’s not Amortentia. It can’t create attraction, just helps you to get what you already desire. You must have noticed how I was driving myself mad holding back every time I was around you.”
, he’d noticed that her hair was slightly greyer around the temples, the creases beside her eyes a fraction deeper. Those delicate hands had turned papery and weather-beaten, her nails jagged and bitten to the quick. Recently, there had been more changes – her shoulders were a little hunched, her movements much slower, and her breaths seemed laboured, and as though they sometimes caught her by surprise. All in all, she now appeared much older than her forty-seven years – and there was something else, too – a sense of desperation, as though a thin veil of defeat now covered her, head to toe.
“Harry,” whispered Ron urgently. His eyes held pure desperation as they flicked back and forth around the pitch. “You free now? Shall we go, uh, get a drink?”
His first attempt – a basic heating charm – causes the cheerful little things to wilt into a soggy mess. He raises his wand again, brow furrowed in concentration. Slurring his words, he struggles with the inflection, finally nailing it on the fourth go.
They clasped hands, Draco touching his wand to the top of Pansy’s arm. The spell required a witness: the Vow’s magic, however, could come from anyone. One Unbreakable Vow made in front of one very bemused Wizarding-Adjacent later, and Pansy was back on the edge of her seat, glass in hand, eyes sparkling with mischief.
Being angry about Theo, obviously, was the main thing. Feeling like he had to protect Draco, but also to (not that it was rational, at all) sort of assert his claim on Draco, which was something ridiculously Gryffindor-ish but kind of sweet if you thought about it. And Harry was also probably having niggling doubts about Draco’s commitment to the relationship, since it was relatively new.
Harry had owled Hermione over the summer as well, and knew that her summer had been more stressful than his. She had gone to Australia to restore her parent’s memories, and thankfully it had been a success.
Harry rolled his eyes with a slight smile. “Sure, Healer Draco.” Draco raised his eyebrows but left.
“He and I share Herbology, and we have an essay due next week. I wanted to ask him about it,” she explained, and Harry nodded, forcibly ignoring the wave of relief that swept through him at the knowledge that she didn’t like Draco or anything like that. “Oh, here we are.” exclaimed Amelie, and with a sigh Harry followed her out of the carriage and up the steps of the school, trying in vain to think of snow, little children, owls, anything but the blond, snarky Slytherin who sat in the dining hall.
“That’s what you get for stealing my blankets this morning. Plus Pansy isn’t around from me to steal from.” replied Draco poshly, and they all laughed. Simon caught Draco’s eye a few minutes later and smiled at him, and Draco smiled back almost instinctively. Simon was very attractive, after all. Calm down, Draco scolded himself. You already have one crush, don’t get ahead of yourself.
“Vanilla, treacle tart, and Quidditch equipment.” he answered quickly. “You?” Daphne gave him a look of curiosity.
To everyone reading my fic, thank you! I hope you like it! These chapters will jump back and forth between Harry's POV and Draco's, and a TW for this chapter, there is a brief mention of self-harm.  Note: I did fix the spacing on the whole fic.
“Bloody bug crawled over my hand. It had so many legs.” Draco shuddered comically and Harry laughed.
“Never a dull moment, is there?” said Harry wryly as the two boys picked themselves up, and Draco laughed breathlessly.
“Hello, Ms. Granger!” he replied squeakily. The rest of the class streamed in through the door, and Harry’s eyes are drawn to Malfoy when he enters, trailed by Blaise Zabini. They sat across from Harry and Ron. “Good morning to you all! Today we will be taking notes on and debating the properties of Healow’s 4 Laws for elemental charms. Now, if…” Harry quickly stopped understanding any of the words coming out of the professor’s mouth, and Ron leaned over to whisper in his ear.
Harry watched Malfoy disappear into the carriage, which started moving away from them. “I can’t believe that git is back!” spluttered Ron, letting Hermione pull him into the last carriage. Harry followed, giving one thestral a quick pat on the side. “I mean, why would he even want to? He’s a Death Eater!”
“Look at those two!” she whispered, giggling, and pointed discreetly to a pair on the dance floor. Draco did, and realized the dancing couple were Simon and Daphne, both looking very happy as they spun around the gleaming silver dance floor.
“Yeah,” said Theo, running the back of a shaky hand across his lips. His wavy hair was sticking out at the sides, and his cheeks were flushed. It was a weirdly familiar picture, as though Draco had blinked and found himself in 1997 again, and he had to fight down a slightly hysterical urge to laugh. Theo continued, speaking slowly, a bewildered expression on his face. “Yeah. It wasn’t – I was just coming in to buy some dittany, I swear. I don’t know… I don’t know what happened. I got your letter; I knew that you weren’t…” He shook his head. “I’m sorry. I guess it must have just been old habits or something.”
He slammed his hands down on the table, suddenly livid. “What did you think it was? Some… some fucking
“Thank you though,” Draco said seriously, after a minute, “for coming with me. I know I wasn’t… easy.”
, again. She’d stayed at the Manor not because it was her home, not because she loved the place, but because
pleasure. It was quite the revelation. He tilted his head, pressing open mouthed kisses underneath Harry’s ear, breath blowing gently over the area, savouring the way Harry shivered openly in response.
“Still nothing? How about this, then? Your Death Eater friends killed him? Killed my older brother?”
“We’ve got time though,” Harry said, running his mouth wickedly up and down the side of Draco’s shaft, forcing another desperate whine past his lips. “You can finish like this now and… no? That’s what you want, is it? All right then,” he said, amused, kneeling back up to straddle Draco. And then, “In the interests of expediency―” Harry muttered, reaching behind himself. He whispered a quick spell, flinching slightly as it took effect.
In the end, Draco was focussing so hard on staying calm and unaffected that he missed the Cannons’ only moment of brilliance: the Quaffle flung from fifty yards out to glance off the Keeper’s broom and soar through the centre hoop. He was therefore completely blindsided when Harry jumped to his feet, punching the air, before turning to Draco, a delighted grin lighting up his entire face. The smile was so unexpected, so sincere, that Draco’s heart leapt straight into his mouth, and he found himself grinning back, dopey and loving. Harry cleared his throat, looking away self-consciously.
Draco rolls his eyes dramatically. “Complicated. Did you know that if someone damages their wand arm, there are eleven alternative channels that magic can take?”
A loud hissing noise, disorienting yet strangely familiar, shocked Draco violently awake again, and he sat bolt upright, looking around in vain for its source. The old thumping headache was back and he was burning up once more, sweat beading on his forehead and chest, bed sheets soaked through. God, if only he had a drink of water.
“Fanged Geranium,” he said morosely, and the portrait swung open. They stepped through, Harry secretly scanning for anyone looking as though they’d been outside. He could ask Hermione if she’d seen anyone come in before them, as she was sitting at her normal desk in the common room and looked as though she’d been there for a while, but if it wasn’t an eighth year Harry didn’t have a clue how to find the culprit.
“Yes, I remember when Fleur and Madam Maxime left with a group of students for the Triwizard Tournament. I was only in third year, but I remember wanting to go so badly and visit another school. Although I do like our uniforms better.” Amelie smoothed her skirt and Harry smiled.
“Is he still going to run that, with-without Fred?” asked Hermione tentatively, and Harry felt the bright mood in the compartment sink a bit.
“Si seulement vous saviez à quel point vos compliments me rendent heureux.” whispered Draco quietly from behind him, almost absentmindedly. Harry barely comprehended it; the quiet murmur was like a song.
“And how many Gryffindors?” asked Harry, humouring him as they stepped out of the shop into the brisk, cold air. Draco tilted his head.
“Thanks,” said Harry, and the two girls walked past them with friendly smiles. Draco didn’t mind the Patil twins, they’d been nice at Beauxbatons. He’d paired up with Padma for Transfiguration sometimes, and to the twins, at least, Draco and Harry’s relationship was not a surprise. He only wished it was the same for everyone else here.
“I forgot it was Halloween,” admitted Harry, still staring around the room. Not that he hadn’t seen it before, but it had been quite a while.
“Goodbye,” said Pansy sweetly, and Harry left somewhat gladly, to Blaise’s and Pansy’s snickers and Daphne’s scolding. Well, that could have gone worse, thought Harry wryly as he returned to Hermione’s table.
The next morning Draco awoke, groggily blinking at the light streaming in from the window, the gauzy, see-through curtains fluttering. He’d eyed those curtains last night, knowing they were too thin to be anything but decoration. Someone knocked on their door.
Harry turned and framed Draco’s face with his hands before leaning forward and pressing their lips together, an electric buzz sparking through him at the touch. Harry could feel his heartbeat- their heartbeats- speeding up. It never failed to amaze him how amazing it felt to kiss Draco, every time. They drew apart, and Harry couldn’t stop himself from smiling.
“A couple times. Fred and George told me about it; they used to come down here and get food for parties and stuff.” Harry explained. The house-elves ran back up to Harry, their arms full of wrapped sandwiches and pastries. “Thank you,” said Harry, and Draco echoed him before they took the food and left. “Do you want to carry any?”
“Yes, but-” Draco sighed, his head tilted back, eyes closing, before he remembered what he was trying to say. “Merlin, Harry, stop it, I can’t concentrate,” he protested, and Harry laughed, the sound low and sexy, sending a flush to Draco’s cheeks.
But by the time they reached the front doors of the castle, Draco’s fear and shock had morphed into anger. Who had tried to kill him? He knew why, because he was Draco Malfoy, but what scum had tried to kill him? And tried to kill him in that way, too. Some coward who couldn’t even try to kill him face to face. Pathetic.
“He ran off somewhere.” replied Harry. Daphne excused herself and went to go look for him, and Harry almost joined her, but Amelie still had a hold of his hand and tugged him down into a seat. The lights were dim inside the club, and Harry frowned. “Wait, they use electricity here?”
Harry glanced back at Draco, who was staring at the place where his Patronus had been with an expression of wonder. Harry jogged over to him, an exuberant grin on his face.
“It sounds lovely, but I think I might stay too,” said Hermione, with a slightly regretful look on her face. “Since I’m going to yours for Christmas.” She and Ron shared a loving look.
Hagrid nodded wisely. “Thas’ good. Reckon that was appreciated after all of last year.” Harry smiled.
Ron laughed through his mouthful of potatoes, and Hermione shot Ron an exasperated look, which Harry snickered at. Sometimes Hermione was the girlfriend, sometimes she was the overbearing mother hen.
“Eat up, Mr. Potter, you were unconscious for two days.” she said briskly as she set down the tray, and Harry nodded, suddenly feeling the ache of hunger in his stomach. He glanced over again at the sleeping Draco, and Madam Pomfrey followed his gaze. “Don’t worry about Mr. Malfoy, he should wake up soon. He’s only sleeping, my dear,” she said warmly, and Harry nodded again, a little embarrassed, before busying himself with the food and his friends.
He’d never hated himself more. It was his fault this had happened. If he hadn’t been dating Harry, they wouldn’t have been together, and Harry wouldn’t have been hit by this curse.
Draco’s gaze dropped to Harry’s lips, pink and full and slightly parted. Draco was looking at Harry, and Harry was looking back, and there was that intense look again in his eyes, and Draco’s brain was full of the desire to lean forward and kiss him…
“It was nice of him, though. He’s a good friend. Even if he randomly talks in French when he knows I can’t understand him.” replied Harry with amusement, shrugging, and he saw her blink rapidly, like she’d realized something. “What?”
“Stop lying, Potter. We both know I’m too dignified to snore,” Draco replied, placidly sipping his coffee. A corner of Harry’s mouth tugged up in amusement. It was true, Draco didn’t snore. He just let out these little sleepy sighs and huffs every now and then, and Harry thought it was positively adorable, although Draco would probably just be embarrassed by it.
Harry strolled down the hill with Draco, taking immense pleasure in the fact that they were holding hands, Harry’s fingers curling around Draco’s. It might seem very plain, compared to all the kissing they’d just done, but it was something couples did, wasn’t it? It made Harry feel warm inside, at the thought.
Harry chanced another glance at Draco, who was absorbed in his reading. His legs were tucked up underneath him, and his blond hair was swept a little to the side. He was biting his lip as he read, which Harry had noticed a long time ago was something he did a lot, but absentmindedly. His hand was curled around the edge of the book’s cover, while the other one fingered a page, his silver rings bumping silently against the paper. His grey eyes were tilted downwards, so the main impression was of his blond, thick lashes-
The Transfiguration class was relatively similar to the Hogwarts one; they were still working on human transfiguration, but Harry perked up with interest when the teacher mentioned Animagus’s.
“I hadn’t really thought about it, but Hermione suggested being a teacher, like how I taught the DA, and I liked that idea.” he said, taking a bite of the biscuit.
“Aurea Anthos.” The portrait swung open and Harry stepped inside and went over to a table where Hermione’s scribbling busily away on a long roll of parchment, two books propped open across from her. Harry sat down. “Hey, Hermione.”
“And I didn’t want anyone else dead. I guess I knew you were the best bet at… at a better world. And I was too scared for my mother, my father to break away on my own.” he finished quietly. Harry glanced at Hermione and Ron and their surprised expression match his own.
“So what was the best part of the trip?” said Ron, leaning back in his seat. Harry glanced at Draco again.
“We should get going, Draco. Classroom’s on the other side of the school.” said Daphne, and Draco nodded, standing.
“Now will you come with me?” he said, fingers still wrapped around Draco’s waist. Draco took a steadying breath, as all common sense and self control had left him as soon as Harry’s lips had met his own. As usual.
“Excellent job, you two.” said Professor Eagry from over Harry’s shoulder. “5 points to Slytherin and Gryffindor.” The two grin at each other as she moves on.
“The eighth years have a special opportunity. This year we will be conducting an exchange trip with the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic.”
“Aw, look at you! You’re smiling! And blushing! This is so cute!” squealed Daphne. Draco smacked the back of her head gently.
“Don’t worry about it,” he said quickly. “Harry, don’t-” But Harry was already striding over to Draco’s desk, and a predatory stillness went through him as he read the letter. Draco sighed.
“Then I have ten minutes,” muttered Draco, closing his eyes again. He heard Harry sigh and move away, probably getting ready. But then he felt a rush of cold air, and Harry was standing at the end of his bed, with his blanket. “Hey! Give that back,” ordered Draco. “What if I’d been naked?”
So many little quirks and things he’d noticed and filed away about Malfoy. Harry kind of wanted to get to know him. Meet who he thought of as Draco, not Malfoy. In his mind they were almost separate people.
Harry was jittery as he walked down the final hallway, at the end of which lay his dorm room. His and Draco’s dorm room. Merlin, it was going to be ten times harder to keep this secret from Draco, especially because he was such an observant person. There was still a week until the ball, and if he wanted to wait until then...well there was nothing else for it.
“I think I’ve just understood something… oh! I’ve got to go to the library!” She spun on her heel, and abruptly hurried away.
, and while a criminal trial was not the usual content of the gossip magazine, every single publication would be releasing an article on the trial of such an influential man as Lucius Malfoy.
“It’s so good to see you, girl,” he told her, stroking the soft feathers of her head affectionately. Hedwig preened under the attention for a moment, before haughtily dismissing him in favour of cleaning under one wing.
“Everyone with me,” Flint snapped, waiting with a glare for the resting players to join Harry and the others. Once they were all together, Flint wasted no time. “New line-up is this: Chasers are myself, Pucey, and Malfoy. Keeper is Bletchley. Beaters are Derrick and Bole. Seeker…” he paused to look at Harry with disgust. “Seeker is Potter.”
. Draco was unprepared for Harry’s quick retaliation and the jinx hit him right in the stomach. He bent over with a gasp but fired back just as quickly:
The Slytherins were paired with the Gryffindors for double Potions on Friday mornings, but the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs had the same in the afternoons. Knowing how long they had spent in the library this time, Harry suspected they would miss dinner – but he didn’t mind, and he doubted Hermione did either.
There was something curious in the tilt of Adrian’s head, but thankfully he didn’t say anything. “Fair enough. So, kid, do you fly?”
Harry backed away, slow and soft-footed despite the silent boots Blaise had sent him keeping his footsteps inaudible. Quickly, he ducked into the closest room, and froze at what he saw.
Harry read through each of his letters, holding them close and realising with a surge of alarm that he had left not just his other letters (which were more precious to him than nearly anything) but also his wand.
Harry meets Colin Creevey, experiences his first lesson with Gilderoy Lockhart, and is bullied by Draco and Adrian (not really).
“I’ve seen this book before,” Harry murmured, tracing a hand over the leather cover. “Ginny Weasley wrote in it.” He flicked through the pages. “But it’s blank.”
Gemma Farley made a noise of disgust and promptly dropped a book on his head. “Insensitive much, Harlow?”
Harry spun away from them, still frantic. “In the walls, the voice! I heard it in Lockhart’s office and then again just-”
Harry knew, with an abrupt certainty, that no matter Draco’s decision, it would all work out. Everything would be alright. That confidence, it seemed, came directly from the warmth of Draco’s palm against his own, and he hoped – with another squeeze of his fingers – that he could offer even a fraction of that same comfort in return.
Millicent scoffed from beside the fire, but Draco was too excited to care, and a glare from Harry made her mime zipping her lips.
Hagrid wasn’t done. “You can’t take Dumbledore! Take him away and the Muggleborns won’t stand a chance! There’ll be killings next!”
“Merlin, Harry,” Draco rolled his eyes. “You could muster up a little enthusiasm. Aren’t you going to try out for the team? I certainly am. And Father said if I make the team he’ll buy us all brand new Nimbus 2001s!”
“So he’ll die, then,” Harry murmured. He didn’t know Flamel, obviously, but he had an appreciation for genius, and anyone who could create the Elixir of Life in stone form had to be a genius.
Draco scoffed. “’Nice’, sure.” He was silent for a moment, before asking, rather more nervously, “Harry? Do you think Hagrid trained Fang to fight? You know… Just in case?”
McGonagall turned back to the staff. “The rest of us should go and inform the students as to what has happened.”
(For Petunia Dursley, it was a combination of several things: her sister’s eyes in an unfamiliar face; memories of strangeness and wickedness in the form of flowers blossoming in winter under her sister’s touch; and of course, that unnatural silence that was so
weeks in his cupboard with minimal food, Harry sat on his cot beneath the stairs and turned the memory over and over in his head. He had no paper or pen with which to write, so he put his thoughts in the dust on his broken desk instead.
Harry pulled his wand out of his sleeve frantically, hands shaking as he struggled to remember any spells that might help them, but all he could think of were the hexes Millicent and Theodore had been teaching him, they wouldn’t do jack against a damn
Harry forced himself to turn away. The conversation felt far too private to listen to. He moved and sat on Hermione’s other side, between her and Theo. Blaise placed a hand on his shoulder, dark eyes questioning in concern, but Harry just nodded, and watched as the others began placing their own gifts on Theo’s bedside table.
Harry furrowed his brow – surely the twins had already explained? – but complied. “I broke a statue, sir, and used the pieces to kill it.”
As quickly and quietly as he could, Harry slipped the letter into his cupboard and out of sight, and got on with the rest of his chores – though he thought of little else but that letter, and by the time he was finished he was feeling quite impatient with the whole thing.
Was this, then, the ‘distasteful’ answer Narcissa had said he would find? Were she and the murderer out for Harry’s blood related? Yet, why was there no Sirius Black on the family tree?
despite his not residing there was almost painfully heart-warming. It said that he was wanted – indefinitely, even. It said that he belonged somewhere other than Hogwarts. It said that his absence was recognisable, beyond some drooping tulips outside a house where he had always been unwelcome.
Neville was a wreck, his fretful energy getting on Harry’s nerves and making him restless and irritated – but it was far better than what he became once they stepped into the Hospital Wing.
“He will not judge you, Harry,” Narcissa told him, gently. “But it is your secret to tell. I will not share it for you.”
Harry picked himself up off of the stairs and moved silently up to his room. The grazes on his palms were only carpet burn – they would heal quickly.
Harry didn’t really feel like going to get ice cream after the fiasco in Flourish and Blotts, so he made his excuses and returned to the Leaky Cauldron, waving off his friends’ concern. Aside from Lockhart, the day had been lots of fun. And in just a week, he’d be back at Hogwarts, and he’d get to catch up with Neville and Hermione, even if Lockhart was going to be teaching them Defence. Harry fell into bed that night happy. He couldn’t wait to go back to Hogwarts – to go back home.
Blaise huffed out a laugh. “Kettleburn has fewer limbs than a Gryffindor has sense. He can’t be taking care of a Cerberus.”
He was so caught up in his furious thoughts as he stormed down the corridor that he didn’t even notice Hagrid until the groundskeeper was right in front of him.
“There’s a new password,” said Parvati Patil, coming up with her sister from behind them. “McGonagall told me, it’s ‘Fanged Geranium’.” The portrait swung open.
“I’m Teddy’s godfather, and Andromeda let me stay with her over the summer. She’s very kind, and Teddy’s wonderful.” said Harry, smiling, and Draco blinked.
La voz de Draco  llegó con calma a sus oídos y Harry se desperezó estirando un poco su  cuerpo, su cabeza descansaba sobre el regazo de su novio y el calor de  la chimenea llenaba el lugar. Seguramente se había quedado dormido  durante la charla después del almuerzo. Malditas pociones para controlar  su magia, lo relajaban y lo hacían dormir, las detestaba pero no podía  negar que se sintiera mejor desde que había comenzado a tomarlas y que  su magia pareciera responderle bien, a pesar de que aún no le habían  devuelto su varita.
—Te prepararé un té —ofreció Draco poniéndose de pie—. Tú mientras juega esa partida de ajedrez con Ron en mi lugar.
—Lo  sé cariño —contestó Molly con su acostumbrada voz maternal—. Pero si tú  también te vuelves un manojo de nervios no podrás apoyar a Harry.
—Hey  compañero, despertaste —le dijo sonriente—. Malfoy y yo íbamos a jugar  una partida, pero si quieres podemos ir a volar un poco antes del té.
Molly lo observó. Draco lucía  cansado y de hecho lo estaba.  El chico intentaba montar un negocio con  Hermione y estaba haciéndose cargo de Harry las veinticuatro horas y  ella sabía que no era trabajo fácil. Conocía a Harry como si también lo  hubiese parido y sabía lo obstinado que su muchacho podía ser.
Entró a la cocina y se  topó con Molly que volteó a verlo y le regaló una sonrisa. Esa mujer a  pesar del tiempo todavía lo ponía nervioso. Draco estaba seguro de que  toda su cortesía era una completa mentira para no hacer sentir mal a  Harry y eso lo hacía sentirse incómodo y fuera de lugar.
“That’s not the point,” Blaise sighed again, and clasped Harry’s other shoulder as well to look him head on. “Listen, Harry. It’s not about you getting hurt or not getting hurt. It’s that you put yourself in that position in the first place.”
Harry didn’t think of any of these things, except for when he did, and when he got into bed that night and drew his curtains, the wetness on his cheeks was from brushing his teeth, and nothing more.
“You must have.” Narcissa smiled, then, polite and indulgent – but to Harry it just looked triumphant. “So you see, Headmaster? Just a misunderstanding. Harry and I ought to be going, really, once we collect his things. Do forgive our haste – I dislike leaving Draco for too long.”
Despite Draco’s pride on the Malfoy’s inclusion in that elite list, Harry wasn’t convinced. Hermione in particular had been disgusted upon discovering
Harry and the Malfoys entered the courtroom with their heads held high. With high, circular walls of black marble and plaster, stands stacked high – and mostly full, Harry noted, though the trial was not set to begin for another half hour – and a single pensieve in the centre of the floor, the courtroom rather resembled a modified amphitheatre. Harry thought it seemed cold, and dark, and depressing.
Harry nodded. This was something he would have to research himself, he decided. But later – right then there was still a Cerberus to think of.
“Oh my God,” Harry breathed, before rushing to one mirror. The cloak swished around him, as he moved, and Harry’s heartbeat jumped as he checked his reflection.
He collapsed. How long did it take to die from basilisk venom? Harry was sure he had read that somewhere. His addled mind tried to remember but every memory in his head was slipping through his fingers like catching sand. Was that something red above him? A Weasley, surely, Fred or George. He hoped Ginny was alright. He hoped Draco and Blaise could forgive him, some day.
When he had the time, Harry wrote his friends and prepared their presents. Every letter he received was placed in a small box beneath his bed with the strongest locking charm he knew on it. It wasn’t enough to stop Gemma or Adrian, and especially not a teacher, but Harry was satisfied it would keep the other first years away. He didn’t care to be mocked for his collection, though he held no shame over it. What was the harm in keeping physical copies of his memories? He might never forget what was written on them, but an image in his brain wasn’t the same as holding it in his hands.
“Time to run yet?” Draco asked, breaths coming hard and fast and pulse hummingbird-like where his wrist pressed against Harry’s.
“I promise, Narcissa,” said Harry, forcing back the emotion clogging his throat. Narcissa had been nothing but kind in the time he had been allowed in her home, and he was forever grateful to her, but the sensation of a gentle, motherly figure still overwhelmed him sometimes. He had no idea how Draco accepted her affections so easily – he might have been jealous, if he hadn’t seen himself how dearly Draco loved his mother as much as she doted on him.
“Alright class, plenty of time for chatter later,” she announced, tapping her wand against a stack of empty pots. “Welcome to Greenhouse Three, second years. Today, we will be repotting Mandrakes. Now, who here can tell me the properties of a Mandrake?”
“You could have been killed!” Draco shrieked. Madam Pince stood up from her desk. “Do you not realise that?”
Still, there was no use postponing it, not when the Malfoys were waiting for him on the other side. Harry lifted his chin, steeled his stomach, and spoke as clearly as he could:
Harry raised a brow, but the other boy was already gone. Harry let him go. He didn’t think Theo would hurt Hermione in any way, and if he did – well, Boy Who Lived or not, Harry wasn’t averse to a little revenge.
Thunder, out of nowhere, except it sounded a lot closer than any thunder Harry had ever heard before and wait a second was that a herd of
Hermione bit her lip, but spoke with confidence. “Harry was my first friend here. He’s never judged me. I’ll go with him.”
The troll roared behind them, and Harry realised with a start that their actions really weren’t the smartest as the creature smashed its club into the stalls above their heads.
The groundskeeper lifted the crossbow again – a little callously for either boy’s liking. “Oh, nothing. Nothing. I’ve been expecting… Ah, doesn’t matter. Come in, sit down, I’ll make tea…”
Wisely, Ginny retreated without comment. She managed one last forlorn look at Harry before the curtain around Harry’s own bed snapped shut.
Red and orange danced in his vision, and he wanted to tell the Weasleys to back off, to let him die in peace – but, were those feathers?
the Heir of Slytherin, but Gemma had slapped him upside the head and he had let it go. If it didn’t distract Harry from flying, Adrian had said, then he didn’t care. And Tracey had offered her and Theo up to look through some genealogy books, to maybe find where Harry’s family intersected with the Slytherin line. So really, there was no reason for the two Hufflepuffs’ opinions to bother him. Except they did. Harry didn’t know what to do about that.
Myrtle huffed. “Well, I don’t know! I was distraught! But they said something funny – some kind of made-up language, and I realised it was a boy speaking, so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away… and I died.”
“No, really, this is insane!” Draco threw his hands in the air. “I’m not sure there’s an ounce of self-preservation in your entire body!”
“Arabella Winters, first year, half-blood, quickly giving herself a reputation as a Gryffindor wannabe.”
Harry looked up at him cautiously as his memory returned. “Did I… kill Professor Quirrell? Or Voldemort?”
Another thing: I'm thinking of going back and editing out the writing allowances for Hagrid's accent. I feel like it's just a bit annoying to read. If you guys want, I'll leave it, but otherwise I'll edit it out and we'll just have normal writing for Hagrid's speech instead of the accented writing. Let me know what you think!
Draco laughed, looking impressed and vaguely shocked. He picked up the abandoned wand and slid it inside one pocket. “Looks like those Duelling Lessons came in handy after all, Professor.”
“Only if Astoria can come,” replied Daphne. “I’m not letting her out of my sight. Not like her Hufflepuff bestie is going to do much to protect her.”
Despite what Draco and Blaise may think, Harry was actually aware that this was his second year in a row walking towards a fatally dangerous situation, and honestly he wasn’t super thrilled about it. Nor was he pleased about what it probably said about him, but at least this time he had company – even if that company was two loud-mouth Gryffindors.
A choked sound made its way out of Draco’s throat. It may have been ‘father’ – Harry can’t really tell. He’s more concerned with the way Draco’s nails dig into the back of his hand as the boy shakes his head.
“Isn’t he beau’iful?” Hagrid leaned over the table, rubbing one large finger over the baby dragon’s head. “Norwegian Ridgeback, ‘e is. Named ‘im Norbert.”
Harry shifted in his borrowed Quidditch gear, fingers tapping his Nimbus 2000 anxiously as he filed into place.
“Actually, no,” Blaise continued, tone still infuriatingly casual. “I can guess the why. What I don’t know, is the
They were standing outside the groundskeeper’s hut, as directed by Professor Sprout – ‘they’ being those of the investigators with Light backgrounds: Harry, Neville, and Hermione.
“Be warned, students,” Lockhart began, with the sort of voice Harry could imagine on one of Petunia’s game shows. “It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind. You may find yourself facing your own worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here.” He turned, and with a flick of his wand, levitated a cage from behind his desk to the centre of the room. “I must ask you not to scream,” he warned gleefully. “It might provoke them.”
“Erm,” Neville had his eyes closed. “Well, since it’s uh, pulling us down, I think it’s- well, I know it’s Devil’s Snare.”
Harry couldn’t breathe, couldn’t understand the words coming out of Lockhart’s mouth, couldn’t think-
“It is not my speech that is fascinating, hatchling,” the snake hissed, and shifted forward a little. “I have not met a two-legged who could speak the snake-tongue before.”
He shook his head. “Blaise is right, Hermione. Colin will be fine, and I really can’t deal with him right now. The game’s given me a major headache.”
Harry took another glance down at the throng of people, and swallowed nervously. “Maybe we should come back later.”
Though grateful for Hagrid’s defense – if a little confused – Harry couldn’t help but be a little suspicious at the Headmaster’s easy acceptance.
Harry released Hermione as gently as he could, though he didn’t bother trying to remove Draco. “How did you know where to find us?”
Tom was silent for a moment, eyes trained on the floor, before he raised them with a considering tilt to his head. “Sir? If it all stopped- If the person responsible was caught…”
“Except it sort of is,” Daphne retorted, flicking her hair back over one shoulder. “We don’t know who the Heir is. It could be anyone – anyone at all.”
Hanging from a light fixture beneath the threatening message was indeed Filch’s cat, stiff, her yellow eyes wide.
Narcissa’s letter, to Harry’s surprise, caused even more of a tightness in his chest than Draco’s. Malfoy Manor had enough rooms for half the population of Hogwarts to reside in without the Malfoys themselves even noticing, and yet the idea of his room at the Manor remaining
The owl did not return, as Harry had thought it would. In its place, however, came a rather tall, thin woman to the doorstep of Number 4, Privet Drive. When she saw Harry, her already stern face became even sterner.
“Now come on,” Draco said eventually, pulling back and subtly wiping his face with one sleeve. “There’s still an hour before curfew. You must have been dying to talk about that stupid diary all day. Let’s go find the others.”
Eventually, the world returned. There was someone else by his side, a hand in his own. Harry squeezed. Draco squeezed back.
Harry collapsed on the floor next to the food. He couldn’t even bring himself to smile at the way Dudley had reacted. He was too tired. Harry closed his eyes against the dark, and began to dream.
“It was my word against Hagrid’s. Only Dumbledore seemed to think Hagrid was innocent – but it wasn’t enough. I knew it wouldn’t be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school, so I decided to leave behind a diary. I preserved my sixteen year old self in its pages, so that one day I would lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin’s noble work.”
Harry bowed respectfully as Narcissa had taught him, and tried to silence the warning alarms signalling ‘danger’ in the back of his head.
Flint continued to sneer in an alarmingly Snape-like fashion as the players landed in slightly shaky formation. Ecklehurt crashed next to Harry with a snarl, slamming her broom into the ground next to her with more force than necessary.
The other boy brightened immediately. “Great! My gran got me a whole lot of seeds, including these Leaping Toadstools, which are actually really interesting because they can jump up to a foot in the air! I’ve planted them already and they’re growing really well. We’re actually studying them this year, I think.” Neville took a breath, flushing. “Sorry. Erm, how were yours?”
Harry squeezed his eyes shut briefly to curse, but it was a mistake. One misplaced step and he was falling, knee scraping open on the floor as he curled blindly into a ball, like he’d spent so much time doing at the Dursley’s, preparing for the strike. He hoped, hysterically, that his friends would be safe without him.
was a piece of cake. Sure enough, there was the scorch mark indicating where Sirius Black’s name used to be. Only next to it in this book was a tiny symbol. A quick flick through found the appendices in the final pages, and then all Harry had to do was match the symbol and finally get some answers.
She gave him a solemn stare, her large green eyes unafraid. “I don’t like them either,” she said, and gave him a hug.
“What is a massive murderous spider scared of?” asked Daphne, shoving Pansy off her and onto the floor.
The prefect shrugged from where she was sprawled over one couch. “I wasn’t going to, but my mum’s visiting her sister, so.”
“I know that,” Blaise nodded. “You know that. Draco knows that. Merlin, even Granger here knows that, given her parentage,” Hermione narrowed her eyes at him for that comment, “But it’s still a touchy subject.”
“My gran says he’s amazing though,” Neville said. “She says he’s the most powerful wizard since Merlin.”
“But, that doesn’t explain what the- the voice was,” Neville interrupted. “I mean, what was it you heard, Harry?”
Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled. “It seems there has been a misunderstanding. Young Harry’s home is here, with his family, and to remove him from that space would be a dreadful strain on the boy. You may return to your son, Narcissa. I will see that Harry and his relatives’ are properly reunited.”
“You’re the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher,” interrupted Harry, his own incredulity steadily giving way to indignant fury. “You can’t leave right when we need someone to
This was the beginning of Hadrian James Potter’s introduction to the Magical World, and in a way, the true beginning of his life.
“I wanted. To say. Thank you.” Ron repeated, more clearly that time, though the words seemed to pain him on their way past his teeth.
Blaise had his head in his hands. Daphne was shaking her head, and even Hermione looked a little exasperated with Harry’s news.
A trail of spiders was climbing up the wall, out a crack in the glass of a window and into the night. The vision was eerily familiar, and Harry had to shake the déjà vu, remembering the night they’d found Mrs Norris.
“If anyone wanted to, er, find out some stuff, all they’d need to do is follow the spiders. That’d lead them right. That’s all I’m saying. Er. Yeah.”
“Out of the stalls!” Harry shouted, ducking beneath another swing of the massive wooden club and dodging behind the monster’s legs.
“Mr Potter, Mr Longbottom,” Snape addressed them, for once not sneering quite as much. “The two of you are required.”
Hermione pushed on. “And doesn’t this all seem a bit extreme to any of you? I mean, even if He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is really going to return – Dumbledore will deal with it, won’t he? Or the Aurors, or anyone who is, you know, a grown up?”
He echoed, mockingly. “Well I don’t know, Harry, I had to watch my best friend waltz off to face Salazar Slytherin’s massive, deadly pet and then when I finally manage to get to him, he’s gone and gotten himself bitten by said deadly pet, a bite which is
Pansy sighed, half-falling on top of Daphne – ignoring the annoyed ‘hey!’ – and glared at them. “Did you even find out anything new? Other than being attacked by Millie’s worst nightmare?”
(For Vernon Dursley, it was a lot of other things, involving a lot of words which should not be spoken in front of children, even silent ones.)
“There are many ways evil can return to the world, Hadrian. Unfortunately, I do not doubt that Voldemort will find one of them so that he may revive himself once again.”
“What can I do for you, kiddo?” the man asked cheerfully, though his eyes examined Harry with a curiosity that made Harry want to squirm.
?” Pansy said scathingly, spitting out the honorific and drawing herself up to her full – if unimpressive – height. “Everyone will know about this. I mean, for Morgana’s sake, is there anything you
Harry looked at him, but tried to keep the curiosity off of his face. Theodore’s voice sounded rough and unused – as though he rarely used it. Harry himself didn’t like to speak often, but he’d never had his voice run out on him as it sounded Theodore’s had.
