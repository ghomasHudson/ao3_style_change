Snape paused. “Really?”
“It took St Mungo’s five minutes to set it,” Ron says. “You could’ve popped over and then come into work.”
“You do?” Ron asks.
Draco moaned, arched into it like a cat, and licked a trail up Harry’s neck. Harry gasped, and then Draco spun him around and kissed him harshly, like he’d been waiting to do it for ages and it was Harry’s fault they never did. Harry moaned into it, feeling himself unravel and just knowing that he’d never be able to sort himself out again.
Harry shuddered. “If I read seven years’ worth of textbooks before NEWTs, will I have a hope?”
Ron nodded. “Coming from Malfoy, I believe it. How about the rest of it?”
“Humanity,” said Draco. “Being born here, having the history of our species in your blood. For our species' entire history, we've all looked up at the same sky, the same stars and moons and constellations...but the aliens saw a different sky. This isn't their home. Magic knows.”
“You can join me in here,” Harry said to him. “There’s enough room for both of us.”
“The Director,” Harry said.
No, Harry realised, seeing the differences, subtle though they were. He
“How’d it go?” Harry asked.
And Harry wanted him despite it all. Despite all the uncomfortable baggage that came with Malfoy, Harry
“And now, four years to the day from that great sacrifice, I am proud to announce the launch of a brand new organisation dedicated to the education of all our citizens, both magical and non-magical, and advancing our human culture as one, amazing family.
Harry made a tiny sound, draped himself over Draco, and kissed him thoroughly. “I’ve been wanting this with you so long,” he gasped. “Like, twelve years long.”
“I suppose
Petunia looked at him like he’d lost his mind. “Have you never heard of social media?”
, Harry thought resignedly. Draco moaned, and it was
“You lived,” he observed, unsurprised. “You returned to Hogwarts?”
, the sound drew the attention of his kneazle.
“I understand,” Harry replied, the consummate detainee.
(See the end of the chapter for
But—his heart’s desire? What was that? Snape was sneering vitriol at him, but he ignored it. What could he both fear and desire at once? Even as he asked himself the question, the answer came to him. And really, he should have known it all along: he just wanted to be himself.
Harry leant back in his chair. Now he could see where the pieces could fall into place, but he was still waiting for Ron to rub it in. “I see.”
“Pansy and I are going today,” Hermione said. “I was going to ask if you wanted to come with us, but it looks like you have other things to do today.”
“In the oil!” she said angrily. “How dare you, Hugo Black?
want him to love me, and I want to love
“Good!” said Alick. “On three we’ll set them off. One… two… three!”
And Quill was nice, but when he said, “Oh, yes,
he chanted, eyes scrunched tightly closed.
“That was your son,” said Malfoy, a hint of a question lingering at the end. He’d heard about Albus’s playdates with Scorpius, but hadn’t met him in person, yet.
a sodding daughter,” she muttered. He half-wished she would cry. She hadn’t done even once. But maybe she really didn’t need to. Wars changed people, as Hermione’s vocabulary would attest. “What do you see?”
“I’ll take it,” Harry says. “If you want me to. Otherwise you’ll just be in love with Hermione and she’ll be in love with Ron.”
When he’s aware of the world outside of Draco and his daughters again, he realises that the room’s cleared out, and it’s just the four of them again. Draco moves over, silently offering half of the hospital bed for Harry and Baby Potter. Carefully, Harry manoeuvers himself up, wary of jostling either of their babies. It’s amazing how those strange amoebas turned into these. (Secretly, Harry hopes one of them ends up a Hufflepuff, just to annoy Draco. )
“Baby Malfoy,” Draco says, scowling. He then turns around to scowl more directly. “I carry, I claim as heir. You want an heir, you can damn well carry one.”
“What else?” he said to the room at large.
Finally, Mandy said, “Finished,” and every head looked up. She, Wayne, and Su had fifteen of the samples illuminated, and three diagrams floating above them.
Harry deflated. “You really knew?” he said. “All these years?”
“Yeah, I do,” Harry said. Then, knowing he would probably regret it, considering Javier was only feet away and his microphone even closer than that, added, “I live there.”
What if he’d loved harder? What if he’d not been a hollow, echoing thing that used Draco to fill all his gaps and valleys left behind from the war? What if the love he’d studied had been his own, and not his mother’s?
Harry looked up, seeking his house’s reaction. At Hufflepuff, only Draco had yet opened his paper. His eyes met Harry’s, and right then, Harry knew he saw the path they were on as clearly as Harry did.
, for fuck’s sake. He can easily still be a dick if she’s a good partner, but he much prefers to have a nominal excuse.
Guh, he wished they were out of their swim trunks right now.
“Oh?” She smiled. “It seems that both of our chosen fields are robust ones, then, Severus.”
“I shouldn’t think so,” Hermione agreed. “Unless some buzzwordy businessman really does try to boil the ocean.”
“Harry!” said Hermione, smiling brightly. “Can you believe it’s really happening?”
“Yes,” she growled.
He felt his body reacting to the presence of Malfoy. Knowing he was next to Harry, that he was naked and wet and covered in delicious scents, made Harry think things he’d rather not. He was not unsettled by the idea of being intimate with other men – and anyway Hufflepuff would surely be the place most tolerant of it – but he was disconcerted by the idea of wanting
Harry’s heart hammered; he couldn’t breathe, his vision was tunnelling and it wasn’t from astigmatism. How had they got so close? Was Draco fucking with him? Was this a game? Was there something he was missing?
“I was shit at it. Always felt bad for letting Professor Snape down.”
Many Hufflepuffs nodded in agreement. They looked to Alick Macmillan and Emily Abbott, high druids for the year. After a moment of silent communication, Emily said, “We’ll go again tonight. Where’s the next landfill?”
“Several batches of Felix Felicis in hopes I will be lucky enough to lose sentience before the end of the world.”
Harry’s feeling as he catches sight of him. Malfoy is reclined against the Thestral’s neck, one foot propped up on its rump, the other leg hanging artfully off the side. He’s got an arm wrapped back around the Thestral’s neck.
“Harry, wait!” Hermione said as he sped off. Her legs weren’t quite as long as his and she was glaring at him as he turned around. “Honestly. One would think you were looking forward to Potions.”
When the chicken wings arrived, Lee was disturbed to find that some were not actually from the wing area of a chicken. He held a tiny drumstick up, frowning. “This is a leg.”
“We came from Hogwarts,” said Draco, pulling his cloak off. It was warmer here in London, by at least a few degrees C. “My friend needs a winter cloak. Do you have the time?”
“I’ve an idea then,” Luna says. “I found a troupe of waterphoners. They sound like a swamp echoing.”
“I don’t fucking care what her name is,” Harry says. “I don’t want to be her partner.”
“They’ve learned to deal with a lot of changes,” said Harry. “They’re getting quite good at it.”
And for Harry, it wasn’t quite the same, but there were similarities. Harry knew how to focus, too. He knew how to obsess.
Harry pretended to consider. “That’s about the sum of it.”
“My mother tells me she’s decided we won’t be sacked. And that you are to thank for it.”
Harry thought.
: (n) a pathological indecisiveness.]
“Yes,” said Sostrate. “We are in agreeance.”
“Smile!” called Andromeda, and they all turned towards the voice, as if on autopilot, beaming. Andromeda snapped a few photos and then put her camera aside as Draco, Narcissa, and Teddy arrived from some last minute shopping.
“It’s actually a bath house,” Luna noted.
“Already checked,” says Luna. “It’s only illegal if we give it to them to ingest, and we won’t technically be doing that. We’re just using it in our fog diffuser to give the right atmosphere, and if they happen to breathe some in, well, that’s the hazards of Fashion Week.”
good. Whatever. He finished off his coffee and pushed back from the table. “Well, since I’ve got to wait until Malfoy’s cousin gets in, I’m going to take Mrs Black to the Smithsonian. Malfoy? Coming?”
“I don’t even know
“Language, Malfoy,” Neville said. He tipped his head towards a gaggle of second year Slytherins, snickering at them, as he passed by. They were all trying not to look scandalised, while in fact being exactly that.
“Should we just try?” asked Malfoy, after a long moment.
“Yes, yes of course,” said McGonagall, snapping out of the frozen stare she’d been giving the still
“I need to see Professor Sprout again before classes,” Neville said, after scarfing down the last of his second quiche. “See you in class?”
He got a weird little shiver down his spine then, the hairs on the back of his neck sticking up. He looked behind him, but no one was in his suite except his lazy, furry Demiguise-Spaniel mutt. Harry frowned as he reached for his wallet. He was seriously on edge lately, and it was kind of embarrassing.
Draco’s eyes narrow. “Until when?”
“Ah,” Luna says. “And how did they make you feel?”
“I ought to set him loose,” Ron said. “He’d be better off tangled in a kelp forest. Fine, I’ll go take care of him. And then I’m taking him home, where he can be properly cared for.”
Hannah set her mouth and nodded once. “We’ll find it.”
On the other side of the threshold, Hermione is holding two steaming cups of coffee. “Take a break?” she asks. “I just need a mo’ away from Malfoy.”
Hermione laughed, saying, “Let’s sit while we talk. God, I could use a cup of tea,” she added, shucking her raincloak. Her hair poufed up in a halo around her head, and everyone politely ignored it. “It’s a nightmare out there.”
“Oh, Snape, hey. You been with the Queen? Does she know?”
“Me!” says Hermione, finally turning to him. “You’re the one who—” she breaks off abruptly.
When the Portkey landed, he was still thinking about the newspaper. The front page, the blown-up, scowling photograph of his face, taken in a moment of surprise—and how could he still be surprised, after all these years? The inflammatory words; vitriolic and inciting and increasing with each publication.
Hermione scowled, and Harry let out a little huff of laughter. Hermione’s eyes slid to his. They were dark with the promise of murder if he brought up her own Animagus troubles.
“I’m going to drop the shield around the quartz and ash,” Harry warned him. “Be ready to run to another frame if the wards around your frame start to shake.”
Harry glanced at him sharply, but Draco ignored him.
Andromeda eyed them flatly as she leaned against the kitchen counter. Teddy was mowing through a bowl of Frosted Niffler Nuggets, watching the men in question curiously. Saint Bartholomew, Tonks’ orphaned Kneazle, stared disdainfully at them from the kitchen table while a heavy, grey rain beyond the window set the soundtrack for Harry’s morning.
Surely, somewhere, in that evil-looking creature, there was something—something
. It doesn’t matter where they live, it just matters that they live together.
“What?!” exclaimed several bureaucrats at once.
, Draco.”
Harry saw a crack in the armour and dug his fingers in. “Draco, I don’t want to lose you, but I think being forced to come here is the best thing that’s happened to me in years. It reminded me of the good parts of the magical world but it’s not stifling me in it. And I’ve seen my best friend more this month than I’ve seen her all year. It’s the first time in years that I haven’t been bored to death and vaguely resentful of the magical world, and part of that is because of you. The biggest part. If I go back to England, I’m going to be going back to watching Top Gear alone, on my couch, eating yesterday’s take-away. If we go back, it’ll definitely end us and you know it. The British wizarding world’s not going to stand for the two of us together, but here… here we can be anyone. We’re nobodies here. Hasn’t that felt like a relief to you?”
He looked back to find every assembled Weasley staring at him. He sighed. “It didn’t work, Ron. That’s why she’s here.”
Harry ran his fingers up Malfoy’s arms, over the sharp ridge of his clavicle, to the delicate, stubbled skin of his neck and jawline. He leaned up, curling his fingers into Malfoy’s soft blond hair. Malfoy stared back up at him, face flushed, eyes heavy-lidded, but open—so very open for Harry.
“I have to go back, Potter,” he said. “Without our family ancestor magic, the Malfoy line’s meaningless.”
When he returns to the International Travel office, the grunt at the desk hands him a Portkey for tomorrow morning and an authorisation slip. He thanks her for it and Floos home, where he proceeds to read all about Beirut and Lebanon, and then gets sidetracked reading about Israel and Palestine. Six degrees of separation and a sustained feeling of righteous indignation later, Harry’s back to Beirut and wondering who named all these fucking streets.
“Who knows...Wish we could blow them up instead,” Potter suggested. “It’d be much easier.”
“Actual gingerbread,” Draco said. “I’m sure you want some.”
to you?”
Harry nodded, and he and Hermione picked up their carry-with bags and followed Lee somewhat sluggishly towards the three-tailed Starbucks. Lee’s posture screamed exhaustion, but he gave them both a smile when they caught up.
“Might as well,” Draco says. “Wish you’d get the magical version, though.”
Draco nodded. “Look down there,” he said, and Harry followed his pointing finger with his eyes. The entire valley was pink with heather. It blanketed the ground as far as the eye could see.
“Wow, second time out of Britain in my life, and it’s still cool,” Dudley said, peering out the window of the International Portkey Arrivals waiting room as they waited for their connection. “Mum would love to travel here. Looks way better than Brussels sprouts would have you believe.”
“I won’t,” Draco said.
Fuck, how had he grown so fucking
“There was—there was something—” And then, like a complete twat, Harry’s whole face crumpled and he felt the tears from earlier spilling out again. He squeezed Ms Danger closer to himself and rocked her back and forth as she whimpered invisibly against him.
“She is, isn’t she?” Hermione insisted. “What’s she trying to get?”
Then, Draco was being called to
By now, Harry was clean of the creature’s blood and the other Heads of Houses—Hannah for Hufflepuff and Pansy for Slytherin—had been summoned by the Headmistress. Ron and Hermione came over after dropping the kids off with Molly, looking alarmed and exhausted.

“As if you made Atlantis appear all by yourself. They have a much higher opinion of your abilities than I do.”
“Harry!” Lee said, desperately. “I love you, I need you, I can’t live without your friendship.”
Ms Lovecraft screamed.
, he thought hysterically,
“Because I don’t want to, you twit.”
“Aqua fortis,” said Harry, and nodded once, more to convince himself than to convince Snape or Draco. It was the best base for separating and refining, and that was precisely what they wanted to do: separate out the diseased, cloudy areas, and refine the stone into one of pure ‘health’, without, somehow, discarding the cloudy bits. Which meant they would first have to make it a stone of pure disease, and
“And anyway,” Malfoy continues, “What’s the point of being a Veela if it doesn’t come with any of the benefits? No wandless magic, no fireballs, no allure. I can’t even change into one of those beastly half-birds—not that I’d want to, but still. It’s the principle of the matter.”
need him. He pushed that thought away, and when he smiled at Millicent, at least his pride for Draco was genuine.
“You misspelled ‘they’re’,” says Malfoy.
“The nargles will eat you if you continue to sleep, Lovegood,” Draco warned.
Harry eyed his trunk narrowly.
“Draco,” Harry said, testing the word aloud. He’d got used to it in his head, but the sound coming from his mouth felt illicit and dangerous. “I think this is only the second time I’ve ever said it. The first being two minutes ago. Draco Draco Draco. That’s five times now.”
Harry was left feeling confused and, vaguely, guilty. He glanced over at Malfoy, who was still staring out the window of the Brussels Airport Portkey gallery. Did he really get what Harry was feeling? This…encompassing stress of
Harry can still see Draco’s face in front of him. The hallucinations linger now. In the early days of the curse, they were just flashes—so quick and gone that Harry’d wondered if he was losing his mind before they found the curse. He still doesn’t know who cast it, who sneaked past his defenses so cleverly, so quietly, so effectively. He can’t even pinpoint the exact day it hit him—that is the genius of this curse. After all, even Harry at the top of his Auror work didn’t need to use offensive spells and curses each day at work. There were weekends when all he did was light the kettle, and a quick flash of Mrs Weasley’s face as he
“Draco,” Narcissa sobbed over and over.
“I love him,” Harry said, somewhat stupidly. By the lowering of Narcissa’s eyelids, he could tell that she agreed.
He walks away before Harry can respond, as usual, about not needing any sodding tea. Harry’s breath catches when he sees the tattoo on Draco’s back. He’d almost forgotten about it in the stress of the night before. It’s big, covering the entirety of his back in black, magically-geometric patterns, and it makes Harry’s stomach clench with the desire to trace those lines with his tongue and fingers. God, he
by Harry, actually. Harry considers the finished product. “Love it.”
“I’m not sane,” Harry says.
guess.”
“We’re going to practice the spell to send a dead soul back in time to its body. We are only going to practice this spell on these dead mice. We are not going to, under any circumstances, use these spells on one another, Muggles, pets, or anything besides these mice. Am I clear?”
The sun began to rise over the mountains when he reached Timber Cove. He stopped to watch it for a few moments, even though he knew they were pressed for time. They had to meet back in Maine when they were finished, so Narcissa could test the ward and make sure every line was up and activated. He didn’t want to hold them up, and yet, it was so nice.
Harry stared at him blankly, then shifted his gaze to Draco, this time desperately. Draco snorted. “He hasn’t a family cloak,” Draco said. “I should think the Potter house colours would be a good place to start, in a traditional cut. Warming charms for sure. What else is popular this season?”
“A choice between truth and heartbreak or a lie that can become your truth. You don’t know if you did or ever would’ve loved me, but you do know you didn’t mind waking up to me every morning, or going to bed with me at night. That’s… that’s something,” Harry says.
Draco, so that Draco had had that surety to cling to as the magic fought for dominance with his own agency?
he thought smugly.
. Because only Harry’s that, only Harry can fill this feral
“Ugh, how could I forget? Disasters, all around.”
“I’ve already seen it, you know.”
Draco knew better; he must’ve forgotten for a moment that he and Nev were in the same house now.
“I really, really don’t think we should do it,” she admitted, biting her lip.
Padma smiled at her. “
“Participate in
The landlord leaves him be and Harry takes a look around his bedsit. It’s clean, tidy. The mattress has seen better days, but then again, so has Harry’s singing voice. He tosses his bag onto the chair by the window and flops down on the bed, staring up at the ceiling. The cracks have been freshly plastered. Harry appreciates the effort. It’s no fancy condominium in the posh district, though, like Malfoy’s Nana’s place. He wonders if there are cracks in Malfoy’s bedroom ceiling, if Malfoy and his grandmother have breakfast together in the mornings, if she’s kinder to him than she was to Harry, if he’s dating Clam Sticks…if he thinks about Harry at all.
He caught movement from the corner of his eye and glanced at Millicent to find her giving him a pointed look. He shrugged, helpless, sliding his eyes back to Draco. He couldn't look away, because no matter how long he closed his eyes, he couldn't help
.” The both turned to look at the portrait.
He took a deep breath, inhaling the chilly highlands air. Next to him, Draco shifted, his hand brushed against Harry’s. Harry shuddered. Their eyes met for a moment, and Harry knew that Draco wouldn’t be joking about stuffy old family obligations anymore. He knew that Draco felt the difference between whatever that had been and whatever this was – it was charged, electrified air. Or maybe that was magic, for surely the other witches and wizards could feel it, and most would not even know what electricity was.
Albus,” Potter insisted. “He’s my only living son.”
Harry exhaled in a rush, looked gratefully up at the portrait. Snape was back, not destroyed by the explosion. His expression was blank.
“Should you have a backup plan? You know, you could still go into broom-making without a Potions NEWT.”
Nott peered at Harry’s chest with unvoiced academic curiosity. “What are you holding?” he asked, noticing Harry’s arms curled around an invisible object.
ethics worked when he was scared.
Harry tried to play off the strange feeling he was getting, the heat he could feel suffusing his face. “How’d you manage the, er, particulars?”
“Oh? What would you say?” Harry asked, as he reached Draco. He reached up and brushed Draco’s soft hair back from his face. Draco’s eyes flicked back and forth, taking in his expression. His smile was saucy and yet still somehow tender.
Snape peered down into the cauldron as best he could. “I cannot tell.”
Harry cracked open one eye. He was starting to feel a little floaty.
“A storm?” asked Wayne.
“It is easy to forget when you don’t have to look at it,” Kaylen said, and then she moved on.
They hugged fiercely when Ron reached the bar. Harry’s robes soaked through from the contact, and Ron gave him a brief, apologetic smile.
Harry had to take another strong sip of his brandy before he could put words to his oscillating thoughts.
He shifted to his other foot, really wishing he’d bothered with real shoes because it was cold as death up here in this tower. He’d forgotten how draughty towers got. “Can I come in?’
, and it was only the first day back. How was he going to do three years with him like this, when every moment without him was like scraping open a slowly-healing wound?
“You think that’s what tonight is about?” Draco said, presumably to Neville. He’d turned around, one arm in his cloak, the other still out. “It
“Nope,” said the Hat. “
Malfoy’s smile is sudden and devastatingly real. The cloak drops to the floor and he falls forward on the bed, hands braced on either side of Harry’s face. He dips his head and kisses Harry again, softly this time, lingeringly.
Draco narrowed his eyes. “You both, as well.” He cut right to it: “How loud was it there?”
Lucius turned to the side. “Yes, love.”
the Minister said.
. “All right, let’s do it.”
“Draco, don’t touch anything. I’m afraid I can’t adjust the wards to you at this point. Only my sworn apprentice can handle anything without painful repercussions. Now. Potter. I am going to let you into my rooms, and you are going to behave yourself. You will not rummage through bookshelves. You will not swim through pensieves. You will come in, shut the door behind you, and tell me
“How are you liking your studies, Harry? Arthur and I expect great things from you, young man. A cure for lycanthropy perhaps?”
would another species of magical people hide themselves from the rest of the world for so long?
“Oh my god, Harry!” Ginny said, leading him to the settee.
Potter looked around, furtive, but his expression remained tightly neutral. Ahead, the guards were conversing with Penelope and two officials the British Ministry had sent along. Adding in the three-odd-dozen others who’d volunteered themselves from the ICW meeting, their diplomatic party was more like a small army.
Yaxley conjured a very nice Louis XV Bergere in gold brocade for Harry and a matching Corbeille couch for him and Ron. Ron ignored the couch to nose around in Draco’s office, but Draco had to have known that would happen. Harry had already done it dozens of times. There wasn’t much of interest to find beyond the up-to-date Chocolate Frog card collection. Draco did have several of Harry’s card, but, last time Harry had snooped, he was still waiting on a Ron card.
“Perhaps broom-making,” McGonagall said, picking up right where they left off. “Or, professional Quidditch? You’ve the skill for reserve, and with a few years practicing, I’ve no doubt you’d make starting. Montrose Magpies, if you don’t mind…”
Immediately, he felt himself changing. His skin tingled all over. His hair grew, his nose straightened, his teeth changed, his shoulders narrowed, and his waist, too, and then—
“What does that have to do with anything?” asked Harry.
Draco shrugged. “I don’t know. No one’s ever seen them.”
It was a new life, and he was ready for it. He’d been ready for it.
“Merlin I’m glad to be out of there,” said Draco.
“They took Professor Dursley,” Millicent said, her mouth only barely trembling on his name. “These things. I caught one, but they got him and took him up in this beam of light, right into one of their…their flying ships!”
“Counting down the days,” Lucius said.
Luna smiled serenely at this. She’d previously been telling Imani about her date with Goyle, which Imani seemed to find both unsettling and fascinating.
Hermione pursed her lips, looking extremely unrepentant. “Yes, well. I was so angry with Ron when I found out he signed you up for this that I decided he ought to get a little surprise, too. And I wanted to give you a safe option in case everyone here turns out to be a fame-seeking creep. And also I wanted to show all of you—” and here she turned and faced each of the cameramen in turn, “—that it’s shameful that all of you would profit off Harry’s discomfort and sit in your living rooms watching your magicboxes and laughing at Harry’s love life as if you’d ever get out here and let yourselves be filmed—and you, Harry!” she said, turning back to him. “Gender and sexuality aren’t black and white and everyone should be more open to the possibility of fluid, natural love.”
Eloise said, “So we can clean all that up, and then the flowers will be able to grow again, and magic should return to it.”
“What do they
Three sets of eyes fixed on him.
There’s an uncomfortable silence. Harry happily sips his tea, even though he doesn’t like it, and smiles at Narcissa and Druella. Druella still refuses to even look at him, which is not a problem for Harry since he and Draco have moved into the Malfoy property here in the city anyway.
Harry beamed at him. “Brill!”
Ron rolls his eyes and takes another bite of spaghetti. Hermione gives him a look, and Harry knows that, despite his bad cooking, Ron will be getting some tonight. He probably gets some every night. Hermione has those looks on her face frequently. Who would’ve ever thought.
The charm snaps on his head, sounding a long, high-pitched ringing in the middle of his brain while it calibrates to his location, native tongue, and the words he’s presently looking at. He scrunches his eyes closed and breathes through the discomfort until the ringing stops. There’s a soft chime to alert him the charm is active (as if he wouldn’t be able to tell). He opens his eyes and scans the cover sheet, noting down the Aurors involved, the date, the situation, etc. etc. etc., with only half a mind.
“So demanding,” Malfoy murmured, but he seemed happy to comply.
And just as I was getting used to this, it hit me harder, just a week later. That’s when I started having the…the visions. But it wasn’t just visions. It was memories, too. Things that I know must have been true, but I hadn’t recalled at all. I saw something.”
“The Wildifre Whiz-bangs,” said Draco. “They ignite with a code word. We could mount it on the sample, behind a containment spell obviously, and set them off from a distance. If we used the same type of whiz-bang for each sample, it would be simple to measure how much of their magic is absorbed by the sample, and further, it’s a really powerful, sudden blast of magic, so if anything triggers the absorption, those should.”
“Your magic,” Ron says, quiet. “You weren’t… you weren’t in the right place, emotionally. You need—”
Now he’s nursing a soy-mocha-frap-double-shot in some swank little cafe in Diagon while Ron chews forlornly on a stick of celery with hummus. He crunches several times, eyeing Harry’s frap so desperately that Harry gives in and slides it over to him, even though he knows Hermione would be irritated. Ron snatches it up, takes a long slurp from the straw and leans back, eyes closed, a smile pasted to his face.
“I think that’s a wonderful idea,” said Luna. They all turned to her. She was buttering her chocolate scone while Imani looked on in fascination. “I’m sure it would go a long way towards helping the Muggles adjust to our existence, once we completely break the Statute of Secrecy, I mean. It’s hard to hate an entire group of people when your children are part of it.”
Harry thought.
He bit his lip to hold back a yelp as the flame jumped up and scorched his fingertips. “Fixing my flame.”
Draco looked wary. “You don’t think she would...? Because this definitely broke the Statute..."
“Quite true,” McGonagall said. Daphne and Pansy grinned at one another. And there went Boot being happy about something.
“Oh.”
“All that wandless magic, and you use it to undress me,” said Draco.
On his doorstep stood Malfoy. But he wasn’t alone. Next to him was a hover pram and there was a tiny blond baby inside it. He was sleeping, but Harry could tell that he was perfect and adorable just like Rosie. And he looked about five months, just like Rosie. They could even be friends, Harry thought, and was immediately annoyed with himself.
?!” Lee said from the kitchen, loud enough to startle Hermione, Padma, and Harry out of their
A Botticelli, eh? He’d thought it was just a handsome bloke who liked to wink at him when he said his password.
“These will pop you from spot to spot in your range, sirs and ma’ams,” Kaylen said. “If you use the south end, you’ll start in the south spot. If you use the north end, you’ll start in the north.”
“Happy New Year, darling,” Hermione said to her. “Wedding bells next year?”
He ignored the way Malfoy’s eyes finally tracked to his face then. He had no idea how to address the rest of Dudley’s questions.
“Um—right,” he said.
Harry hesitated. “I don’t know, really.”

Gringotts ambitions when you
It was decorated with pineapples, palm trees, coconuts, and the windows had been charmed to overlook Mauna Loa, the world’s largest volcano. It steamed gently in the distance. They were doing a Hawaiian volcano theme this time, to go with the pineapple juice goblins favoured in summer, and in honour of the honeymoon Padma and Theo intended to take.
They waved to him as they went to eat at the staff families table. He smiled back, gave Albus a stern look. Albus’s eyes flew to the Hufflepuff table where Ms Fawley was laughing with her third-year friends, and then nodded quickly. They had a deal: Albus would stay off brooms unsupervised by adults, and Harry wouldn’t tell Gin about it.
Harry was not necessarily the type to trip all over himself with his emotions. He felt them, and he felt them hard, but he’d learned a long time ago to live
Harry hesitated. “You read it?”
“Yes,” said Malfoy. And then, “Hufflepuff has try-outs afterwards. I thought to watch and see how our line-up is looking for the year. If you wanted to come with.”
“Anyway, that time, I was there, and when the Headmistress came in, she caught sight of me and remember how she put her hand to her chest? Like she was so startled that I could possibly be there that she thought her heart was going to fail her?”
It was currently zipped, but as if he’d predicted it, the zips went flying in either direction, and the doorway opened.
More often than not, Harry ended up sitting next to Draco when they met. Justin and Eloise would sit across from them and regale them with stories of growing up in Hufflepuff in between those history lessons, and hearing them would give Harry a certain ache in his chest.
“No, for dating twenty-four men at a time. Well, twenty-three, really.”
In short, everything was great. Except for the part where they’d both been so busy this week that the understood reconvening of Friday’s outlandish attempt at sex had yet to manifest. He’d pushed Draco into an alcove after lunch on Wednesday, but they’d barely had a chance to start snogging before a passel of first year girls came by talking loudly of hair charms.
And also the other part that he refused to share:
“It will require an O on your Potions NEWT. Do you think you can learn seven years’ worth of material in five months?”
Harry left them to it, deciding instead to explore the balneario with Javier tagging along behind him, probably filming his bum. Harry walked along the shore for a bit, letting the ebb and flow of the tide splash against his ankles. He stared out at the horizon, feeling peaceful for the first time in years. It was so ridiculous, really; he’d hated Malfoy for years, but over the past two weeks, he’d come to like him a little bit. And,
Draco trails his mouth up Harry’s jaw line until he reaches his ear. “I’m not going back,” he says. “I won’t scare you again.”
Harry and Dudley were cutting it close again this year, as they did every year. But to be fair, neither of them had read
“Potter and I have another concern,” Draco spoke up, startling Harry into spilling some coffee from his cup just as he was pulling it from the Keurig.
Harry’s defeat of Voldemort had been touted as if he and the Dark Lord had been ‘frenemies’, while Hermione’s work with magical creatures had been ‘a revolution waiting to happen’. They had nothing on Blaise, so they put him forward as a do-nothing, while both Malfoys were written as entitled peerage—probably true. Only Padma and Lee escaped without negative comment. Lee was a mediator and award winning public relations person—of course he knew how to stay out of spin. And Padma was, well, Padma. Who could say a bad word about her?
Queen Sostrate had begun to age, and they knew magic had given her another gift that day: the ability to die as a normal human did. Severus was much as he’d been the day he died, though he’d aged accordingly. But he was alive, and that was incredible magic all on its own.
a lot alike. Ambition and working hard. Insularity and loyalty. Groupthink. Supporting leaders instead of being them. He was starting to get an idea of Malfoy, a look into his motivations. And as a Slytherin, he certainly had those. Harry watched him, watched how his eyes moved and who they looked at, how he focused on one thing at a time, but was aware of everything.
. Maybe not from distance, but from ignorance. He should’ve listened, Harry realised.
, this isn’t something to be scared of, because it doesn’t matter what the outcome is. No matter what, it’s better than the alternative. No matter what, it’s less scary than that.”
“My mother’s going to Greece with Pansy’s mother for Christmas. I hate Greece. All that…
was how out of touch he was with Magical politics. And yet, Murdoch had still insinuated Harry was just the other side of a coup.

drunk. A very little, as the alcohol content in butterbeer hovered somewhere near two percent.
“We can start with the Chesapeake Merrows,” said Hermione, ignoring his whine. “Since they were the ones who rioted.”
, Sev?” Draco snarled. “Why are you being so fucking circumspect? You’re not a spy anymore; you’re dead. I spend my days teaching Gryffindors and my evenings reading my seven-year-old Hermione Granger’s children’s books. I could seriously do with some direct communication right now.”
Harry had no idea. He shook his head.
“I bet I can get my form before you can,” she said.
“Fine, yours,” Draco had said. Harry remembers it without fail. He knows this conversation as clearly as if he were watching it in a pensieve.
In the end, he gave a Snitch to Dune, Hermione, that big stud Ruby, Titus, Atlas, Felix, Byron, Socorro, Gardner, a bloke Harry thought had the same name as himself and which he thought was funny but which, upon waking up the next morning, he would find to be humiliating, Michael Corner, Zeph, Quill, and Finian.
“Are you kidding me,” she finally said.
He pulled away, panting and Malfoy kneeled up to retrieve his wand from his holster. He cast a lubricant spell, dripping warm oil from the tip of his wand onto his fingers. Harry watched, unconsciously spreading his legs further apart. Malfoy smirked at him as he leaned forward again, bracing himself on one hand to kiss Harry’s mouth while his other traced up the cleft of Harry’s arse, circling his hole.
Draco grimaced, turned from the window and the city view he wouldn’t get a chance to enjoy, and took his place at the long table. As his endless luck would have it, the placard reading ‘Mr Draco L Malfoy’ was sitting right next to the one reading ‘Mr Harry J Potter’.
Draco gave him a flat look. “Who do you think accused Margaret Jones of witchcraft in Boston?”
They came to a hidden stretch of wall and Draco put his hand up to the fourteenth un-chipped stone. He whispered Severus’s last password, and the wall dissolved into a door just wide enough for them to enter.
He began to feel weak. He was nearing the end of his reserves. Across from him, Potter staggered woozily, firmed his mouth and straightened. Draco watched, fascinated and horrified.
“Of course I remember him!” Potter said. “He’s my son!”
They rushed down the back stairs, took lefts and rights without thought, no care whatsoever where they ended up, but enjoying the game of losing Mrs Norris. Up ahead there was a classroom door ajar, with a faint blue light seeping out into the hallway. He grabbed Hermione’s hand and tugged her in. They fell against the door, breathless, laughing.
Nah, they wouldn’t let him come back; he’d have to get a job and a flat and do it without any Muggle skills or certifications or money.
Harry retreated to the kitchen for a beer and found Lee there, setting up the new laptop computer he’d bought when he agreed to come with Harry to, as Lee put it, ‘Magic in Muggle-land.’ American witches and wizards were almost completely integrated with Muggle society. They had shops and places that only Magical folk could see, of course, but they were so intermixed within the rest of the city as to be one with it. There wasn’t anything similar to a Diagon Alley here or anywhere else in the US. And the Magical people used the internet daily. Lee was not one to be a late adopter, so therefore, he would learn to use the internet.
, whether people wanted to believe it or not.
He brought Mrs Black’s portrait down and propped her against the coffee table so she could watch the last season of
Draco shared a look with Harry. Narcissa’s friendship with the Royal Family wasn’t new, but her exuberant demeanour was. The Healers at St Mungo’s suggested it was a coping mechanism for PTSD. After Lucius’ unexpected death in Azkaban only six months after the war, she’d rekindled a number of friendships, including those with the Muggleborn Sophie Rhys-Jones and the Pure-blood (but regrettably foreign, if Lucius were consulted) Duchess of Gloucester, Birgitte Eva van Deurs Henriksen. The happy-go-lucky personality came shortly after the late Lord Malfoy’s death and showed no signs of reversing, to no one’s disappointment.
Much to Harry’s disappointment, the first person to visit him was Hermione, not Draco.
Harry was thrown backwards, his wand falling away somewhere, and had barely enough time to call out,
The door to Hermione’s room opened and Millicent strolled out, glanced disinterestedly in their direction, and then noticed the potion. “Liver, is it?” she said, sounding very much as if she couldn’t care less.
They were well past the old Necromancy classroom and very near the Merlin portrait gallery when Harry got the courage to bring up something Ron had told him over hols, in that dark silent time when they were both trying to fall asleep but couldn’t yet. Due, on Harry’s part, because the Chudley Cannons posters spellotaped to the ceiling were covered in
“Tsk, tsk, Potter,” Malfoy said. “You aren’t supposed to show favouritism.”
“Alchemy has proved to be a very dangerous undertaking,” Harry said, shrugging.
The Great Hall doors opened again and Malfoy, the latest of all late Slytherins, came in, and even from this distance, Harry could tell his mind was far away. He made his way up to the breakfast table as if in a daze, took the remaining seat across from Harry. He nodded a greeting; their eyes met, Malfoy’s a thousand-yard stare.
Lucius sipped from his glass, nodded. His eyes were sharp.
“Second time,” Draco said, his voice cracking. They were forced so close together, his lips brushed against Harry’s when he spoke.
“They really do that?” asked Neville.
He wondered if Malfoy would do something Quidditch-related because that was really all Harry could remember of him, but didn’t think so. He suspected Malfoy would surprise him the most—he always had. Harry shook his head, grinning. “Malfoy will be predictably unpredictable.”
when he was bored of lording over first years at sabbat celebrations.”
“Oh ho!” said Dennis. “You like ‘em feisty, eh Harry? I always thought you might. Tell the wizarding world what you love most about Malfoy. Is it his hair? His eyes? His tight bum?”
“What the hell are we waiting on? We’ve got to go get it!” Harry spun around, grabbing his shoes and jacket. “We’ll take the Floo—I have access to Dudley’s from here.”
But more importantly: “What?!” Harry said. “Why on earth does he want to dismantled the Wizengamot?”
“Of course they’d give you a really excellent case the moment I—oh, hello Hermione,” says Malfoy looking up.
Draco looked away, and that was all the confirmation Harry needed. He shrugged. “Probably. Slytherins and greatness, you know. It’s bred in.”
The same absurd, stunning realisation Harry kept ending up at when he lay in bed next to Malfoy, sweat cooling from his body, trying to fall asleep. The same realisation Harry had desperately wished wasn’t right. But it was. It was the only option they had.
Harry fought down a flush with an arcane strength he’d not known he possessed. “Yes, Professor, sorry.” He could bloody
Harry’s skin goes cold, he has an idea of what she’s going to suggest, but she couldn’t possibly—
He leaned in and kissed Draco, and Draco let him. He made a needy sound in the back of his throat, and Harry rolled over on top of him, exploring his mouth again. He pulled away after a moment, long enough to say, “You’re forgetting, Draco. We don’t want to destroy the bad parts. We have to encourage them.
, but he’d, fortunately, stopped himself when he realised Draco would be able to breathe just by sharing the same charm, which, fortunately, was able to filter oxygen from the surrounding water when it was running low. They had a few minutes.
“Not beyond the front page showing the Cannons’ tie with Puddlemere,” said Narcissa. “Which was quite an upset, but not terribly

friends,” Harry said, guiltily. They’d tried; they really had. In the end, staying friends had just been too hard. And not just on Ginny. On Harry, too. He missed wanting her, even if the want had been strange and uncomfortable. He missed the easiness they had. He missed being around her and not feeling guilty.
The potion hissed dangerously. Harry added another couple of wards, suddenly unsure of his spellcasting for the first time in his life, and then, before he could change his mind, raised the heat on the burner as high as it would go. The flame soared upwards, burning red then orange then yellow, and still that wasn’t high enough. The hissing grew louder and louder, and the reddened wards trembled under the great pressure.
Maybe Hufflepuff and Slytherin
Harry gave Anthony a horrified look, but no one was paying attention to him.
, Minerva.”
, Headmistress. And don’t we have enough of the twatty sort of Slytherins on staff as it is? There’s Pansy, for example. I have to share Heads of House meetings with her every week as it is. This is putting me under a great deal of strain and I fear my students will suffer the brunt of it.”
So he grabbed Bikki’s tank and hauled him up the four flights to the attic, then had to figure out how to carry a fish tank under one arm while he ascended a ladder. The castle fell over and sent pink gravel floating in all directions. Seabiscuit was
“Daddy, I’m eighteen,” she said, annoyed.
followed the Muggle stories cautiously, as if waiting for the bottom to drop out and the Muggles to realise what was happening.
the way Malfoy smiled against his chest at that. Harry smirked, self-satisfied, but knew that if anyone could see his face right now, covered in sweat and red from blood-rush, he would look like a complete loon for Draco Malfoy.
“Then we’ll have to figure out how to make it all work together,” Harry said firmly. “I’m sure the Ravenclaws would love the challenge.”
He slumped down on his bed feeling strangely exhausted, fished
Ron hates that Harry’s named his Crup after him, but she’s ginger and Harry was drunk at the time and pissed off about having to be vegan, so whatever. He takes her lead from her mouth and snaps it onto her collar. They head out the front door and down the steps. He doesn’t worry about Muggles seeing her anymore because her tails wag so fast when she meets people that it’s easy to think it’s just a trick of the eye, and also, the only people out now are drunk.
“Perhaps her mouth itself isn’t bushy,” Malfoy conceded, “but her hair has certainly not improved with age. Why are you and Weasley such terrible friends to her? Merlin, someone tell that woman that there is a de-frizzing spell.”
Harry and Draco gasped, then glared at the watercolour portrait.
Why is that so hot? Harry doesn’t spare the time to worry overmuch about it, just settles right in for a single-minded fantasy that involves him in place of Miss and Malfoy holding Harry’s hips as he pounds into him. Harry gasps. He imagines Malfoy thrusting into him, imagines feeling Malfoy’s cock inside him, imagines Malfoy draped over his back, wanking Harry off while he fucks him.
“Whatever, Malfoy,” Harry said, sighing.
“You’re joking,” Malfoy decided.
“Shaad likes it hot, don’t you, buddy?” Ziyad says, as Shaadhon bounds and jumps up Harry’s legs, front feet braced on his thighs and feelers tickling Harry’s face. His mouth is open and panting, rows and rows of sharp gleaming teeth on display. Harry grins at him and scratches him behind the ears. He should take a picture for Hagrid if he makes it out of this damned city alive.
“Oh my god, Harry,” Ginny said, her voice strangled with alarm.
!” Weasley said.
“Probably not,” Hermione said, not without an apologetic look. “Potions-making isn’t just a science, it’s an art. There are rules, but the rules are so vast and detailed and bendy that it would take a lifetime just to learn the ones involved in a simple Pepper-Up Potion. Potions Masters understand the theory and use their instincts for the rest.”
His own crumbles, a sudden, visceral memory of Hedwig flashing in his mind before he pushes it away. His bloodstream floods with self-hatred and regret. He should’ve let her fly ahead. He fucked up, and he lost her. And in that moment, he realizes he loves Nigella as he’d loved Hedwig, and he can’t lose them both.
“Something else like what?”
“Maybe,” Granger said. “But I can’t imagine, don’t want to imagine, really, that you would do something this monumental without it being the only option. And if that’s the case, we could’ve started helping sooner. We could’ve found you a loophole, Ron could’ve worked the DMLE, any number of things. Now we’re scrambling. So,
Except Malfoy. He really wishes he could run out of fucks there, but all he seems to do is play video games (badly, for some reason—he used to be so good) and wonder where Beirut is. Maybe one of the Muggles on PSN would know. He decides he’ll ask tonight when he gets home from dinner at Ron and Hermione’s. Except, oh wait, he can’t talk.
Hermione’s fingers clenched around her glass. “Yes,” she bit out. “The result of a Polyjuice accident. I hate you, Harry. Never fall asleep in front of me again.”
face. Harry’s breathing slowly returned to normal, and he lowered himself to the bed next to Malfoy.
An attendant announced their party at the door, and the Queen nodded once, but it was another long moment before she turned her face away from the sky outside the window to face them.
“From—from Wendell and Monica Wilkins!” She’d barely got the words out before she burst into tears.
“Ooh, you slimy little Slytherin,” Harry said happily. And followed at once.
He hoped Draco had stopped to look, too. There was a lot more to this country than he’d ever thought. Murdoch had no idea what he’d done sending him there.
“I don’t even know the Potter colours,” Harry said.
“Potter, I hate you.”
Hermione swore under her breath. Harry was, frankly, impressed with the variety of words and combinations thereof that Hermione could come up with when she put her mind to it. However Hermione wanted to
“And yet your particular brand of nuisance transcends death and canvas.”
“There are plenty of hazards besides,” Harry says, thinking of the final-final fitting he’s going to have to do on Malfoy before the show. He just has to be
Hermione’s lips curved; it was definitely a smirk. “Malfoy.”
Weasley’s scowl didn’t change. “He’s worried sick about you, you know. Mum and Dad have been doing their best. Did you even say goodbye? Did you even think of him just now when you, yet again, volunteered to throw your life away?”
“Harry, you didn’t!” she whispered, leaning in to keep any of the ever-present Slytherins from hearing their conversation.
“I am.”
be awake if I hadn’t.”
Right now, he just wanted to know more about this thing Neville had said the old druids did. There wasn’t much in there, but he did find a segment on ‘magic tethers’. It sounded like a similar thing to what Neville had described, but on a much smaller scale. Significantly smaller in fact:
He bit his lip. Unwillingly, his eyes met Draco’s, and found Draco looking back at him. He swallowed again. There was nothing for it. “It means Draco.”
“Potter, you are not going to do that,” Draco said.
Harry spread his legs eagerly, allowing Malfoy to fit himself between his spread thighs, press one finger past Harry’s ring of muscle. Harry moaned, angled his hips even more, and Malfoy began to work his finger in and out, deliriously slowly.
“Yes, Professor, how unthinking of me.”
“We aren’t going to a coral reef this time.”
At six fifteen, the ceremony began. It was brief and had very little to it.
Harry’s not much of one for acoustics, but Luna’s never steered him wrong before and he pays her to care when he doesn’t, so he leaves her to it. He snatches up his knapsack and tosses it over his shoulder. Ivan Abbott opens the door for him as he approaches, as if Harry can’t fucking handle a doorknob on his own. He passes through without a nod. If Abbott strives to be a doorman instead of an intern then Harry is happy to oblige him.
“I’d really like to talk about Draco’s article,” Neville spoke up.
“I told you he could do it,” Draco said smugly.
Malfoy complied, and Harry crawled into his bed, immediately curling around Malfoy’s thin body. He tucked his chin over Malfoy’s shoulder. It positioned them both to stare at Malfoy’s mute wand, set next to an untouched glass of water.
“I had all four windows down the whole way and must’ve cast an air-cleaning charm a dozen times. And I still can’t get the smell of fish out of my nose. You owe me,” she added, just before turning towards a bush and ridding herself of her breakfast. Hermione rushed over to help her.
“You’d be surprised who you can trust, Harry,” Luna said. Harry didn’t reply, and not long later, she left his room. He remained at the window for a long time, watching the fog settle over the Pacific Ocean.
“We can leave a portion free.”
“You’ll see,” he said. Harry could do more than defeat evil. He could be talented, too. Probably.
Malfoy fiddled with the pulsation patterns until he found one that made Harry arch and keen, and then he let go of the Zwei, letting it thrust in and out of Harry on its own. He pressed his forearms down on Harry’s thighs, not letting him thrust up or squirm at all. He fondled Harry’s bollocks with one hand, holding the base of his cock with the other—and he sucked, expertly.
“Pull your magic back, Harry,” said Draco. “You read enough blood magic books to be just stupid enough, didn’t you? How do you protect the sacrifice?”
. It seems our luck has changed. Magic is no longer receding… it’s
Harry scowled.
Finally, it subsided. He fell forward, uncaring of the sticky mess between their bellies. He was grinning stupidly into Draco’s hair. Draco’s arms came up and wrapped shakily around him. Their breaths began to even out. Draco stretched his toes and they popped, and then suddenly both of them were laughing.
Malfoy ignored him: “And explain it to you. Rituals are mathematical; they always follow a formula, and there are a set of twelve standard formulas, depending on the type of ritual and the outcome desired. The druids probably used one of three types. If we could figure out which type, and if we had the positioning diagram, we could perhaps reverse the ritual and release the magic.”
But should he? Breaking and entering is probably illegal in Lebanon, too. He can’t imagine that it wouldn’t be, but, admittedly, Harry’s knowledge of Lebanon begins and ends with a crowd-sourced encyclopaedia entry. He considers the enormity of the two files in his pocket and then decides to hell with legalities; he needs to speak to Draco about these immediately. He pulls out his wand and begins to flex the wards enough to let him through.
, Harry thinks as he watches him.
and, once the volume of their argument had risen:
Harry suspected the excitement would taper out over the next week to a dull thunder, and he hoped opinions would settle as positive views of magical people before Harry, Millicent, and Malfoy needed to ask for their help. So far, no militaries had made further advances against Atlantis—or other magical communities. But it was early hours still. Only a portion of people seemed to think magical people were aliens, but that ratio could easily flip in the wrong atmosphere.
“...Why?” Harry asked.
“I know,” Draco said, leaning back, one arm slung around the banquette behind Millicent’s shoulders. Harry very determinedly did not stare at it. “I’m a constant wonder.”
Millicent frowned. “Fine. Let’s go.”
“You Know Who,” Eloise said suddenly, her eyes widening as the realisation came to her. “The war – all those heavy spells flying around everywhere!”
“So,” he said, setting the tray down on the table between them. “Teddy’s still struggling.”
“Fuck, I forgot forks. Be right back.”
He’d had to put on a summer jacket and shrink Mrs Black’s frame so he could stick her in an inside pocket and not look like a crazy person walking through the city with a large, rude oil painting under one arm.
Extraordinarily, Malfoy sat next to him at breakfast the following morning.
They were out by the Forest, talking idly of their project while Harry gathered paralytic mosses for Snape’s assignment from the grey-pink stones that stuck up from the grass near the trees. Sometimes he wasn’t entirely convinced that Snape wasn’t using his apprenticeship as a way of
Ron studied his nails. “Funny thing. We’re real busy today. Might not be able to book you until tonight, maybe tomorrow.”
He wondered what he might’ve been like if he’d had support from his house during the lonely times he spent in school. In second year, in fourth year, and really, there were moments from all the years. He would have loved to have truly felt part of his house, and not just an individual surrounded by dozens of other similarly-tempered individuals.
Harry frowns, waits for something (anything) from Malfoy, but Malfoy’s blank expression doesn’t change. With a completely silent sigh, Harry goes.
Twelve days after he arrives in Beirut, the owl comes.
Poison.”
The translator smiled, conversed with the reporter, and then said, “How do the non-magical participants become receptive to the magic? How do they focus?”
“It was Death, wasn’t it,” Draco said then. Harry returned his attention to him, and Draco added, “Everything is Alchemy. I figured it out, when I was suffocating. It came to me and it made me calm…I wasn’t sure if I should return to my body because it felt natural, you know? Death’s only a transmutation of Life. That’s why most wizards can’t complete the Great Work. It’s why no one would’ve been able to but you, before. And now me.”
Teddy sparkled further.
, I suppose.”
“Harry tied himself to a blood ward in MUS and someone just tried to dismantle it,” said Ron.
“Spare me,” Snape said. He crossed his arms over his chest, stared at Harry for a moment past good manners, and then crossed to the stool at his painted potions laboratory work table. “You don’t have the patience to be a Healer, Potter. Nor for artistic endeavours, or rather, anything at all. I do wonder—will you manage to contribute to society at all?”
“Still asleep,” Potter said. He considered. “Or maybe still Stunned. Hard to tell when the Stunning Spell wears off and they’re left just sleeping.”
They ended up needing two Ubers once they figured out what one was. Malfoy wasn’t pleased, but when was he ever? When they got out on Pennsylvania Avenue (somehow without paying, apparently it went through Harry’s mobile), they were almost immediately assaulted by a bicycler zooming down the pavement instead of the road. Malfoy yelled at him, and it was unfortunate because Harry rather liked hearing Malfoy yell at people, and also because his head was a bit achey from the night before.
He’s never touched another dick before, but when he reaches between them to grab Draco’s, the weight and size of it feels right in his hand. He strokes it slowly. Draco tosses his head back, the streetlights reflecting off his glasses. Harry bends to lick his neck, just like licking the neck of a woman but with the rough grit of a day’s stubble against his tongue. Draco’s hips move sensuously, rocking Harry up and down with each undulation, and suddenly, it’s not enough to just touch him. He needs to be connected to Draco again like they used to be; he needs that shared headspace they used to have on a hard case, and he doesn’t know how to get there without the threat of imminent death hanging over their heads, but he knows how to get close to it.
“Apparently so,” Draco said, arching up against his mouth.
“We’ll still be able to see Hogwarts, right?” Potter asked.
Falsetto again:
For a moment, Harry stumbled over his thoughts. Had she caught him eavesdropping? Was he even eavesdropping? He felt his face heat up. “Er, pardon?”
Harry’s face went bright red. “I –”
. I do good things and I’m nice and I usually only ever forget Hermione’s birthday once a year.” (Typically, on September 19th)
Hermione whimpered, and the moment evaporated, leaving Harry entirely undone. He felt raw, exposed. Draco lifted his head, blinking heavily. His face was flushed. The very air weighed as much as treacle. Harry swallowed and glanced around the room, looking for anything to stabilise him. Millicent was staring at Draco with wide, still eyes. Hermione was—Hermione.
Hermione grinned at him. “She’s furious at Ron, actually. For that… that despicable betrayal of his wedding vows and common decency in the paper last month.”
after him if he’d known it was this rewarding.
?” Potter said. “I thought we were going to...actually I have no idea what I thought we were going to do. Just—
“Bucko?” Teddy questioned. “You’re such an old sometimes, Harry.”
Harry found himself back in the Great Hall without really knowing how he’d got there. The Head Table was back in its academic year location, looking out on the sea of house tables waiting to be filled. The benches and tabletops were shiny from years of use, and the candlelight glimmered against their surfaces like the fairies he’d seen outside Malfoy’s tower window. Fairies that should’ve been hibernating, according to their lead DADA professor. Again, Harry’s stomach tightened, and he wondered when he’d become such a paranoid prat.
The Chieftess sneered, and Harry saw that all of her teeth were quite pointed. “We have found that we are easy to ignore if we don’t make ourselves impossible to ignore. Land-humans think that we will just go away if they don’t come near the water, and that is probably true. If we don’t get help, we will all die out. We’ve lost seven fry this year alone from suffocation or choking, and my sister’s fingerling was snatched by a white shark last season when we were forced into the ocean. My
He felt like his mind was a Rolodex and the Hat was carefully fingering through each memory, pausing to look at some and skipping others. He could feel the flip-flip-flip of each memory, each personality trait, go by as the Hat looked him over. Harry squirmed under the intimacy of it.
“Whoever it is,” Draco said tightly, “stop looking for them. It’s always better to not let on that you know you’re being watched.”
Draco lifted an eyebrow. “Who
by Paracelsus. It explains the importance of balance, measurement, and ingredient preparation. All foundations of brewing. Are you sure you can understand things like centimetres and millilitres?”
Literally everyone’s hand went up. Harry chose a man with a briefcase sat next to his chair, and said, “I can make that briefcase big enough to hold your entire closet and still make it through the security line at the airport.”
His face feels simultaneously cold and hot, like he’s just stepped in from the Sahara into a restaurant cooler. How could Hermione—how could she ever ask—but then he looks away, down at his own plate, untouched and cold since they started talking. He’s asked more from her before, hasn’t he? He’s asked worse.
It was at that moment that they rounded the corner and were met by the sight of Lee fist bumping and one-arm-hugging Blaise Zabini.
Ashwood paused and eyed them all sternly to make sure they were paying attention. Harry, mouth agape, could not have spoken if he wanted to. Helga Hufflepuff and Godric Gryffindor? Next to him, Malfoy snorted – and when had Malfoy come up next to him? Or had Harry come up next to Malfoy? Great, already his guard was down. How many nights would he sleep through before Malfoy murdered him in his bed?
“Did you ever find anything, during your studies, to suggest Atlantis had not, in fact, been submerged by a great flood?”
To Potter, she said, “Leave his frame here and I will have one of my aides find a spot for him on the library wall. We had a number of visiting academics from the Gallic, Chinese, and Mayan communities who did the same before—well, before we all stopped existing.”
Harry didn’t have an answer for that.
…” he said.
its body against mine when Ms Danger tackled it.”
Draco blinked once. “The first time,” he repeated.
“I’m glad you’re ready,” said Hermione. “I thought I was going to have to come rouse you, but I’d been putting it off because I was afraid Malfoy might be down there without his trousers, and I just don’t think I should have to deal with something like that, Harry. I really don’t.”
“Yeah, me neither,” Harry said, sipping his beer. “I don’t know how I feel about that.”
be reined in.”
Dudley shrugged. It was hesitant, almost like he didn’t believe himself. “I can’t be sure.”
“They would,” Malfoy said. “They always explain away important things.” He turned back to his desk, and added, “But that will probably be to our favour this time...if these bastard Malfoys refuse to help us with the UMN. I just know the Americans are going to be cocksuckers about it.”
“I did n—wait. What?”
“Zephaniah, maybe,” said Draco. “That was from before we came to England.”
Malfoy looked up at this. “Interesting. So you
“And it’s eating magic,” Justin said, shuddering.
Carefully, he reached out, ran his hand up Draco’s arm, and curved it around his neck to draw him closer. This time, when they kissed, it was softer, more measured, but still organic. Harry whimpered against Draco’s mouth, feeling himself falling apart and unable or unwilling to stop the destruction.
“What?” said Harry.
“Unspeakable Potter has discovered a way to transfer your bond from Unspeakable Malfoy to your husband,” Apex says, startling them both with her presence. “It requires… a certain arrangement of events and emotions.”
“I rather like them,” Malfoy said after a moment.
Hands shot in the air right away, holding pads and pens, mobiles, hats, and even a pair of trainers. Harry pulled his wand and aimed at one of the trainers.
Muggles didn’t know magic existed, but they knew
Harry’s background check came back acceptable a few days later, and Kennedy Jones rang to tell him so.
“My mum has the kids,” said Ron. “Ginny and Luna are on their way over. Astoria, too.”
“No, I swear it,” said Harry. He felt his face heat from more than the August heat. “I just kinda wanted to see you.”
. They’ve just got wind of the story.”
“All of these have the standard warming and anti-hex spells. I can add the Muggle-repelling charms to any of them. The first is a newer model, the younger set seems to like it, but if you ask me, it does restrict the elbows.”
“Better get used to it, Malfoy,” Ron said, chewing on an apple. “This is your life for the next three weeks.”
On that, neither Draco nor Snape could disagree, so they both just stared at him mutinously.
There was a smattering of laughter from the far side of the tent. Harry and Hermione glanced that way to find Byron, Felix, and Atlas huddled up together watching Hermione with her bug. Harry frowned.
Draco’s cut his hair. The sides are trimmed close and the top is still longer, but brushed artfully to the side.
, he thinks, resigned, and reaches over to snatch it up.
She looked around and then walked him even further into the stacks. “I didn’t want to look myself because I know myself and I know how I’ll react to what I’d inevitably find. We need to know what the Muggles have put into the air, water, and soil, and we need to know how those things affect the environment.”
!” said Hermione.
He arrived at the lab to find McGonagall relaxing in a red tartan chair. His stool was missing.
She turned her nose up. Across the table, Lee was watching the both of them, his eyebrows raised, saying nothing. His mobile vibrated. Harry caught a glimpse of a woman’s face on the screen before he picked it up and quickly started texting.
“I can’t quit,” he said. “I don’t know what else to do.”
“No creative streak, unfortunately.” Unless one counted the disturbing Malfoyish scenarios he’d entertained since seeing Hermione’s
that it’ll work, you have to want to keep the aliens away from our planet and our people.”
“No, I caught one,” Millicent said, crying again. “I’ve got him here with me. I was going to try to ransom him if all else failed.”
“Oh, you
it can promote unity. Couldn’t we have, I don’t know, intramural Quidditch or something?”
He looks up at Luna. “But,” he says, hesitating, “he’s my partner.”
“You have a choice now,” Harry says, surprised at the levelness of his own voice. “It isn’t a perfect choice, I’ll grant, but it is a choice. We can choose to enter this bond together, willingly, even though neither of us will ever know if it’s fully—fully
“Oh, right!”
Harry felt the whoosh of displaced air before he saw the approaching figure. It was twilight and the wizard was in dark clothing. He dismounted deftly, shot Harry a caddish smile, and flipped his broom up on his shoulder.
As if Summoned by dark magic, Malfoy sat down right across from Harry and proceeded to completely ignore him, as if Malfoy weren’t the newbie. As if he weren’t the only person in this whole castle who had never even taught a class. As if his father weren’t actually doing really menial and embarrassing community service under Arthur Weasley at that very moment. As if Harry could really use a distraction right now and Malfoy was determined not to give him one.
“I—I really can’t do this, Potter,” Malfoy breaks in. He shakes his head several times, looking hunted. “I don’t want them. Keep them.”
“Well, let’s ask Minerva to use that one then.”
brushing your fingers over it for years. Amazing how the only time
Draco glared at Scorpius. “Yes, we really, really do.”
“We’ve got to go,” he told them, but didn’t hear the words come out of his mouth. He said it again, over-enunciating the words and the children’s eyes tracked his mouth as they nodded.
The silence stretched, but when he looked up again, Malfoy was looking at him, his eyes strangely bright. “I know.”
“We have another Magical Monday ahead of us!” said the professor. He was a contemporary of Bill Weasley. They’d been friends in Hogwarts. Bill said Juniper Orkney had always been this jubilant and excitable. Bill also said that Orkney knocked them all on their arses during Defence in school. Harry found it hard to reconcile the two.
Harry thought that was an unfortunately valid possibility. He swallowed. “What can we do then?”
Harry shrugged, turned away, focusing his gaze out of Malfoy’s tower window, where in the distance, he saw three fairy lights, drifting slowly across the sky and then suddenly zipping upwards. He’d never seen fairies do that before. He supposed everyone was acting strange in the aftermath of Atlantis.
Malfoy opened his mouth, but just then, there was a knock at the portrait door before it was tugged open. Hermione peeked in, her eyebrows soaring as she saw the two of them around the fire.
“Bloody hell, Draco. I want this fucking well over with. I’ve got a goddamned migraine and this fire terrifies the shit out of me and I want to go to bed, but I can’t, because I’ve done something extremely
“Nigella,” he says. “And—me. I see it reenacting itself in her. She’s part of the cycle—a cycle my mother began. She died, but her magic can’t. It keeps coming back; it keeps dying for me.”
“Speaking of grand adventures,” said Hermione. “Do you know, Harry, who Malfoy’s bringing with him?”
“Thank you to everyone for what I think was a really great time last night, but which I won’t be sure of until I see the episode on magicbox,” Harry began. “I really don’t remember much of it.” He heard Hermione snort and pointedly ignored her.
Harry nods his head quickly. The Auror narrows her eyes. “I want weekly updates from your mind healer. This is the British Embassy, not rehab; I’m not going to let you come in and have a holiday on my time and the Ministry’s knut. You
Malfoy breathed a startled little laugh. It sent Harry’s heart pounding. “You’re the daft one, Potter.”
“You signed me up for this, Ron! And anyway, I’ve already given her one. You’ll tune in next week when the episode airs, yeah?”
“Yes, quite,” said Draco.
“You love weird,” Draco says.
Draco’s eyes narrowed further. “I didn’t know why at the time, so I used one, too, and now I know.”
Draco’s lip quirked on one side. “Of course.”
They retreated to the living room shortly after; Harry pulled Draco aside when the Weasleys had gone through, and said, “You okay?”
On the train, they took a cabin with Susan, Neville, and Millicent, who Hermione had—bizarrely—befriended after McGonagall roomed them together back in September. Harry had never been more pleased to room with Neville, as the only other boys who’d returned for eighth year were Malfoy, Goyle, Zabini, and that overly-happy Ravenclaw, Boot.
No, that wasn’t fair. Pucey had always been a good Slytherin about helping Greg and Vince with their essays when Draco didn’t feel like it. But he’d certainly acted like a moron every other minute of the day.
His hands were shaking from adrenaline by the time he and Draco got the doors locked and wards up around the classroom. He’d never felt so wound up before, not even when he’d…not even when he’d
He hadn’t, right?
“I love it when you’re a twat,” Harry said. He leaned back in his chair and felt the heat from the fire pit warm his back.
On the afternoon that Ron and Hermione finalised their divorce, Harry met his best mate at the Happy Dementor for a few pints. They’d not spoken much in recent months — Ron and Susan Bones being out of the country for several weeks on a case, and Harry still being miffed at him for that ad in the
Potter nodded, brows furrowed. “Is it just me, or do you feel like we’re being watched?”
“Of course,” said Hermione.
“Have you contacted them since you got here?” Harry wondered. The idea of cousins was so foreign to him. Save for Dudley, who Harry still didn’t really consider himself related to, he had none. What would it have been like to have several? Several who weren’t cruel little shits, that is?
Draco cleared his throat. Harry forced a grin as he rolled over to face him. Damage control time. “Well?” he asked with false nonchalance.
Harry, for his part, had never had more fun in his life. To finally taste Draco, to finally try him and have him, was the stuff of daydreams. Years of daydreams. Every day that they’d been Auror partners had been an exercise in restraint for Harry. He’d wanked in the office loo so many times that he was sure there were blokes who’d only recognise him by his shoes and the pattern of his strokes.
Dudley rolled his eyes in Harry’s direction, and Harry shook his head, fighting a smirk.
Malfoy throws his arms up in the air. In the process, he loses his sheet, which Harry belatedly realizes was the only thing keeping him decent. He Summons his glasses and quickly slips them on, having no intentions whatsoever of missing a free show. His vision clears and he sees Malfoy’s completely nude body for the first time in the light of day. No wonder it’s inspired so many collections. It’s perfect.
Draco slides in and his breath rushes from his lungs, ghosting over Harry’s back. There’s pressure, a full feeling, but it’s not painful. He feels like this is how things are supposed to be and maybe that eliminates some of what pain there might’ve been. And he’s never been more turned on in his life.
“It’s perfectly clean,” Anthony said. “We did a superb job with those spells.”
Silence stretched between them then. Harry heard little beyond the creaks of the castle as it settled, and his own forcefully slow breathing. He was
“I know,” said Harry. “But we’ll drink them anyway because it’s all I’ve got.”
He’s outside of himself again; there must be something wrong with him to always escape his own body when he knows something will hurt him. Is this what his mother did as she carefully, methodically, built up her own fear and misery? He studies the soft white-blond stubble on Draco’s jaw and carefully, methodically, does not remember how it feels against his inner thighs.
Malfoy gave him an annoyed look. “Are you really going to tell the Headmistress of Hogwarts what we’re planning to do? Are you insane?”
The fingers at his waist tightened for a second, released. “Then do so. Don’t lose count.”
“What did you believe, Hermione?” Ginny asked, still petting Albus who was still petting Ms Danger. “Before?”
—so we’ve got time yet. Malfoy’s coming in shortly on a—”
It wasn’t sarcasm in the least, but Draco also wondered. What was the key? For surely Sostrate seemed to think Muggles were it.
Somehow, Harry makes himself look up from Malfoy’s crotch. Malfoy’s middle-distance gaze isn’t on the middle distance at all. He’s staring straight at Harry and he doesn’t look just-shagged; he looks
“I only started trying a couple months ago,” Malfoy said hotly. “It’s not as if it’s a weekend floo parlour renovation.”
So it was just a little holiday sort of thing, but for magical people. He’d seen the new-agers in the Muggle papers every summer solstice, waiting for the sunrise at Stonehenge. Uncle Vernon had certainly complained about them a lot, and blamed Harry for their existence of course. Harry hadn’t realised this sort of thing spread over to the magical world, but then again, he hadn’t ever even considered that witches and wizards might have a religion anyway. They certainly didn’t have mass on Sundays. Well, at least the Weasleys didn’t.
“Well, needs must,” Hermione said. “We owe it to them. We caused their problems.”
broken it.” He tapped harshly against the headline. “Several times now. And they’re already starting to second-guess their tendency to explain magic away. It’s only a matter of time before we’ve completely blown it, Smith. I’ll be amazed if we make it to Yule.”
“I’m not going to return,” Harry says. Hermione freezes. Ron does, too.
“You weren’t too worried about your
It felt odd to be doing something so big without Ron and Hermione with him. The landfills, those had been a little secret, a series of tiny thrills from doing something covertly and somehow managing to not give it away. But this was so much more than that. This could change the entire wizarding world’s future. It could change the Muggle world’s future. It could save one and destroy the other.
Harry nodded thoughtfully. “I wonder why he thinks he can do stuff like this. Sending us out here and saying he’ll cause trouble for us if we don’t fix it.”
“Coming!” Harry called.
Ron hooked a thumb at Rosie, who was making a valiant effort at focusing entirely on her summer Astronomy homework. She peeked up at them when the silence had grown too long, only to find both Ron and Harry still looking at her.
“More than anything,” Potter said.
“Thècle Coquelin,” said a ginger woman without aid of a translator. “
“I think Mother knows something,” Draco admitted. “I can’t figure out what, but I have noticed she’s been keeping a close eye on the
“Don’t trust her,” Blaise drawled. He looked suspiciously as though he were trying to keep himself in his chair, but Harry thought he was just weird.
? Harry took his hand and shook. He unconsciously sucked in his stomach, wondering if two hours a day of training for his Auror work was enough for this unnaturally fit bloke.
“I’m also on the mortgage.”
The stream of magic flowing up from Draco’s wand sputtered, slowed to a stop. He felt as if he were looking in on himself from a remove. He was not part of his own body, not part of his own mind. His body was a foreign place where nothing lived and everything was dull. He was so tired…or the body he watched was, anyway…if he could only just sleep for a moment…
,” Hermione repeated in a sultry, melodramatic voice, her eyelashes fluttering. “I’ll have the Smiiiitticks.”
Malfoy walked behind Minerva’s desk, standing on his toes to reach the portrait directly behind it, which was always the most recently departed Headmaster or Headmistress. He tapped his wand to the portrait, murmured a spell.
There was a ruckus outside the house, then a knock on the door. Petunia froze. “It’s the press again. Ignore it.”
“It’s already there!” she said. “Just log in. The password’s on the icebox.”
The door was already open and un-warded when they got down there and Draco felt a moment of terror before they pushed inside and found Millicent sat on a chair, facing the alien who was only feet away. She had her wand pointed in its face and it was baring its teeth at her.
“What are you looking for?”
Harry doesn’t know which one he likes hearing more but there’s something special, something intimate, in the way no one calls him ‘Potter’ but Malfoy. “You’re the only person who remembers I have a last name,” he says.
Harry didn’t even get a chance to reply before she was gone, slipping into a seat next to her friend, Agafya Parkinson, a cousin of Pansy’s.
“Don’t you ‘hey mate’ me when you’ve been gone three days, after exposing the entire wizarding world—“
Hermione narrowed her eyes. “Let the Ministry try it. They’ll have an international scandal on their hands and I, for one, won’t be blamed for something I didn’t even do.” She gave him a pointed look.
“Hermione?” Harry asked. “Draco?”
Addolgar sighed, the very picture of long-sufferance. “Harry, what is the point of learning something half-arsedly? That’s a complete waste of time. Now, I know this is difficult for you, having spent your formative years in Gryffindor, but can you please stay with me here?”
Harry took a healthy sip of his brandy and sat down, his stomach suddenly remembering how hungry he was now that food was in front of him. It was steak and ale pie, steam still coming off it in waves, the crust golden brown and buttery. They set in without fanfare, and for once, the silence wasn’t oppressive. There was tension in the air, but it was tension from the thoughts swirling around in their own heads, not from one another.
“Absolutely,” Eloise said.
Hermione grinned. “Excellent. We’ve got a hundred and twenty RSVP’d already. I negotiated the party tent vendor down to seventy Galleons per hour, so that saved us about two hundred Galleons. They’ll arrive at three that afternoon and start setting up in the courtyard in front of Fortescue’s where the tables usually are in summer. I even got them to throw in the area-of-effect warming charms for all the tents.”
There were already tonnes of reporters gathered in Atlantis when they landed. Not nearly as many military personnel, but then again, most of them were still pointing their missiles at the island, convinced it was a spaceship itself. Still, there were a few, and that was reassuring.
Professor Sprout bustled over, peering down at the lump of soil in his testing dish. She prodded it with her wand. Her eyebrows furrowed further, and then she stood and looked around the greenhouse. “Has anyone else got to this step yet?”
Harry studied himself critically in the array of mirrors. The template cloak was grey, but Coddler tapped it and it changed to deep green. Golden embroidery swirled into the hems and around the collar. “It’s nice.”
Harry turned around in relief. “Finished with your Potions NEWT already?” he asked.
“Good morning, half-blood, Mudblood, and whatever you are, Mr Jordan.”
“We need his help. Plus, I like him. He’s very American.”
It didn’t occur until mid-morning that Scorpius could’ve woken up at any time the night before, come looking for him, and found Draco’s cock rubbing against Albus’s dad’s. Fortunately, Draco’s luck held out.
Which it very well might. But fuck it, he’d love Draco as a Muggle if he had to. He’d love him as whatever he had to.
“Where are you going?” he asks.
“I’m all right,” Ron said eventually. “I mean, I will be. We’re going to stay friends.”
But he didn’t want to. Harry would leave that for the real crows.
Draco scowls at him. “I give you six months until you change your tune there, Potter,” he mutters.
“He was using too nice a word,” Hermione finished grimly.
Even the Slytherins looked excited by this news.
“Where’d you get that mug?” he bites out.
now, and they could laugh about Ron being twatty. “All right, I’ll do it. They want my outline by the end of the week, so I suppose I’d better go and get started.”
... No! Stop! My grandmother’s coming home today.”
How did it get
“Duly noted,” said Harry. “But what do I do? We still have family dinners every month with Andromeda. How am I supposed to wait six months for an answer? I can’t even wait for the kettle to boil without hitting it with a simmer spell!”
“Oh for Merlin’s sake,” Millicent said, upon tasting her own drink, which, like Harry’s, was not a faux beer, but a real beer. She gave Harry a direct look. “He’s in one of his moods, to be sure. Never drinks at Quidditch otherwise.”
Harry starts to sit up, confused by the distressed look on Draco’s face. “No, I’ve—” his voice cuts out mid-sentence and it’s only then that he realises he’s been speaking this whole time. He tries again, but it won’t come, so he sighs and writes,
It was super adorable, as far as cauldrons went. He pulled it out carefully, admiring the fine details and the sturdy bottom. It must have weighed at least twenty pounds, though.
He trusts Malfoy, though—trusts him with this and a thousand other things.
Harry frowned, thinking over Malfoy’s words. He didn’t want them to be true.
do that,” Draco decides, and not without another dose of bitterness.
“Auror,” says the man, a hint of question in his voice.
“So. You’ve fifteen Snitches here in this bag. Everyone who gets one will get a chance to win your heart. The nine who don’t are going home at the first Portkey tomorrow morning, never to have the chance to know your tender soul. How do you
Harry asks. If it’s a flash mob, how are people being alerted to the fact that a message is even there before it gets demolished? Harry’s head whirls with dozens of different trains of thought, his instincts pinging him that something is not right.
“Brill!” said Teddy. “Maybe you could even charge a fee for hosting it, and decorate, and serve some food and stuff, and then every time wizards and witches got married, they could just book it with the bank, and the financial goblins would never need to leave and you’d make
Harry shrugged. “Just wanted to round things out, I suppose.”
“It’s always a money thing,” Kyle said. “I’m realising that more and more now that I’ve moved over to working policy with them almost daily. But it’s also a culture thing. Americans, even Magicals, are used to instant gratification. We like everything
Harry ignored him. How could he have forgotten? How could he have been such a stupid, terrible, awful person? “Seabiscuit!” Harry exclaimed, bending down to peer into the tank. “Bikki, boy, are you okay?”
“The spellcasters all lost their magic the first time,” Harry said. “All…big magic, things like this, where we’re asking magic to do something really outstanding for us, requires some kind of sacrifice.”
She always knew exactly what to say to bring back his confidence. “Right. You’re right. Okay. Chemistry and Muggles and how both are fucking shit up. I’m on it.”
Ron’s eyebrows went way up. “Might want to. It was—intense.”
“And show them magic,” Harry said, swallowing.
Draco snorted, bumped his shoulder into Harry’s. Harry grinned at him, reluctantly. He shrunk his cauldron and tucked it in his pocket. He had precisely the right way to break it in.
Ron glances at Harry before speaking. “There was another load of C-4 buried behind the retaining wall. Muggle fuses, so that’s why your spells didn’t pick it up. We caught them. Managed to trace magical signatures on a few of them, thanks to your clean containment spellwork, Harry. Didn’t contaminate the scene at all.” He sighs and then glances back to Hermione. “It’s going to be a nightmare for us. The ones we got traces on are all Muggleborn.”
“Would it help if I were doing it with you?”
“She has not helped us recently,” the Chieftess sniffed. “We do not know how to fix our waters. They grow dirtier and dirtier and we don’t have the right magic for that.”
Malfoy smiled at him, coy. “Hello, Potter.”
Harry nodded. “I think so.”
Harry faltered in his chant, but they finished strong and the magic stabilised and sunk into the earth. The ward was up, and soon, that heart-stopping spectacle would bring something ugly to every shore.
“Did she
Scorpius gave him that unimpressed look again, but shouldered his knapsack full of plushies and held his hand out to Apparate.
Harry nodded. “Right.” He’d forgotten his safety glasses, of course. He could have kicked himself. He’d been doing so well, and then at the first sign of excitement or danger, he bollocksed it all up.
, which is around the year 1100 in common tongue, so it was certainly written by a contemporary. It describes the curse as ‘too dreadful for words’”.
“Granger,
“What will you do with it?”
Ashwood continued: “You must be true Hufflepuffs for the Hat to have sorted you here, for it knows the curse on the den entrance. Addolgar and I have our doubts. We shall see if you pass the test.”
“Morning, Nev. You look like shit.”
Dudley nodded, and then: “But what if he did fancy you? What then?”
Everyone started laughing again, and Harry could practically feel Draco’s curiosity, like it was a tangible thing. Like fuck he’d explain this one. Unfortunately, Hermione seemed to find that this was an appropriate time to get him back for snitching her Animagus form.
He was obviously using the translator spell to give him the Greek words to say, and it came out sounding like a coded message that had been decoded and re-coded several times over. Draco despaired.
“Oh, bollocks,” says Hermione. She doesn’t cry. She never does.
taking down our ward.”
Harry waves at him, smiling sheepishly.
He felt fine, too. Certainly much better than he had earlier. Draco was just up ahead, head up and shoulders back as always. It was then that Harry saw the we’re-all-gay diversion for what it was, and he was grateful to Draco for pulling them out of the funk they were heading towards. Like a Slytherin, he’d done it without any of them noticing, not even Goldstein.
Draco’s head fell back against his chair. “That will take forever.”
McGonagall looked a little sad at that. She opened her mouth, hesitated. Then a house-elf popped in, breaking both of them from the uncomfortable situation, and wailed, “Headmistress must come right away! Naughty Peeves! Naughty students!”
“And Granger, I see. No Weasley? The heavens rejoice.”
They split off at the stairs to the History Wing, Malfoy going on up to his tower of isolation and Harry turning down the corridor to his suite near the Infirmary—a grand joke from McGonagall, to be sure.
“Hermione tried to,” Potter insisted. “But she wasn’t confident in it, and she didn’t want to use it at all. She said it could be dangerous. And we’re not entirely sure Petunia’s thing was due to the spell because Dudley was fine. He’s worried she’s starting to lose her faculties a bit, but I don’t agree. I think it was the spell.”
“Director Griphook,” said Draco. “He seems quite fond of you.”
Hermione looked so alone, with her daughter and estranged husband having family time while she stood back and let them, not interfering. They were both alone, Harry supposed. Even with their families right there.
. Do you know we haven’t seen Rose or Hugo since we left them at Hermione’s parents’ house after your presser? Do you know we’ve been looking for your sorry arse for days?”
