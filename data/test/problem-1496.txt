—and there were very few leads on where it could be. There were still about thirty Death Eaters that appeared in a section of the Prophet dedicated to rewards for their capture, dead or alive.
Draco thought for a second before sitting down next to Harry. “Help me understand,” he started. “I was risking going to Azkaban when we started this plan in the first place.”
In fact, Draco could not get the thought out of his mind. When Harry went to bed that night, Draco feigned wanting to study more. Instead, he approached Granger, who was dutifully working on an assignment, her hair wrapped in a messy bun with her wand sticking straight through it.
Blaise let out a low whistle behind Draco. “Wow. That’s...interesting. Hey, at least you get the big room, right?” Blaise put his hand on Draco’s shoulder and Draco flinched out of reflex. Over the past two years, a hand on a shoulder was never a good thing. His father would do it when he wanted to coax Draco. Aunt Bellatrix would place her hand on his shoulder and rub it as praise after he tortured someone. The Dark Lord would place his cold fingers on Draco’s shoulder when he wanted Draco to move aside, usually after Draco tortured the individual enough so they gave proper information and it was time for them to be killed.
“Yeah, fine. Think I’m gonna turn in though. Long day.” Without saying much else, Draco went to his bedroom and sat heavily on the bed. He wasn’t quite drunk enough not to feel any of the sting of Dean’s words, but he felt a little more relaxed than he knew he would have without the Firewhisky.
His stomach fell as he pictured his mother’s face. Narcissa would think he abandoned her—how would she go on? She told him many times in his summer illness that he was the most important thing in her life. Eyes filling with tears, Draco made an attempt to stand. The least he could do would be to die privately in his room. He also wanted to scribble a quick note that he did not kill himself and that he loved his mother very much.
Draco tugged at the collar of his shirt, hoping that loosening it would ease some of the pressure he felt around his neck. He wasn’t quite sure where to go—the hallways were blissfully silent as the other students completed their first class of the year, but there was always a risk of being seen. He couldn’t rely on people just staying out of his way anymore. Last year he roamed these halls like a terrifying king. First years scrambled to get away from him, and he had actual permission to retrieve anything and everything he wanted by whatever means necessary. Though students were certainly frightened of him, he hadn’t felt menacing in the slightest. He wish the others knew that he was like them in a way—just trying to make it through the year without getting killed.
“Mr. Malfoy, wait. Your Mind Healer appointment is on Monday, yes?” Draco nodded. “Good. Let me know if you need anything before then. I think your lawyer will be in contact with you soon regarding the retrial proceedings.”
Nearly an hour passed with the Gryffindors and Shacklebolt chatting merrily, and the clock was ticking. Draco had to get out of here. The Invisibility Cloak brushed against his trembling hand—
Greg raised an eyebrow, looking doubtful. “I can’t give you proper advice if you don’t tell me the truth, mate.” Draco sighed, looking like he might crack. Greg leaned forward excitedly. “I promise I won’t tell anyone, I’ll even make the Unbreakable Vow if you want—“
’s quips this summer but I hate the press, and the crowds. Second, Hermione is one of the Head Girls, and Ron didn’t come back. Ginny’s a prefect, so are a lot of the others. So I’m on my own until we get to school.” Draco didn’t know how to respond to that. He wasn’t surprised that he wasn’t asked to play a leadership role for the new school year, despite his past as a prefect. He also wasn’t surprised that the remainder of “Dumbledore’s Army” were elevated to higher standing. “So...er, can I sit here?” Potter moved to sit.
“Well...” Harry sighed and rubbed his forehead. “It’s a long story, but I sort of...had extra help back then that I don’t have this year.”
“Actually we’ve become...mates. He’s pretty nice. We’ve put a lot of our disagreements in the past.”
“Thank you, Harry,” Neville spoke up after the room returned to order. “This is what we’re talking about—the need for healing. That brings us to our next point.” He looked worriedly at Hermione, who continued after a brief pause.
Draco tried to soothe his anxious mother. “Is something cooking? It smells delicious.” It was true—a warm and comforting scent wafted over to the kitchen table where Narcissa was forcing Draco into a chair.
“No. I—“ Draco looked at the clock. Only five minutes had passed in their hour-long session. He looked at the door, wondering what would happen to him and his family if he bolted.
Draco wasn’t even sure what he was talking about anymore, and apparently neither was Potter, because the latter just kept murmuring comforting nothings into his ear. Draco had been tortured, sliced all over his body, so ill that he couldn’t eat, but he wasn’t sure he had ever felt as sick in his life. Memories slipped through his mind like fragments and the world swayed. He felt like he was drowning—it was actually getting harder to breathe.
The rest of the time passed fairly smoothly. They played chess, which Draco quite enjoyed. It was quiet, but he had to focus hard enough so that he couldn’t think about anything else. Christine attempted to bring up some other things too, mostly about how he spent his time over the summer. She also asked broad questions about his social life at Hogwarts—if he had any friends, what he enjoyed doing, his favorite classes, etc. Grateful that she was letting them play a game instead of just talking, Draco tried to answer her questions as honestly as he could in return.
Harry looked at Draco to make sure he wasn’t being too self-deprecating. “Honestly? A little bit. But don’t worry about it. I explained to the whole family that this was a possibility.”
Draco had never taken the Hogwarts express alone before. It was unsettling. He at first picked a compartment near the door, but found himself unable to sit still. The trees whirring past him in the window made him feel sick. He decided to walk around, and spent his time going to the loo, visiting the Prefects’ cart, and walking back to the front of the train over and over. There were no students chatting or flinging magical objects at each other. There was no trolley with candies to get excited about. It was just him and his thoughts.
Hale was silent for a second as she looked at Narcissa. “Why did you say no to Nott’s proposition? If you dislike the society under this Ministry, why not try for a new one?”
“The same could be said for you!” Harry said combatively. “People definitely wouldn’t like you dating me. I’d be fine, at least I have some...societal protection, or whatever. It’s you who I’m worried about.”
“Trick me?” Harry stopped and looked at him. “No, of course not! That’s not why I’m showing this to you.”
So sorry for the long wait! I had a bit of writer’s block and a rough week at school. I’ll have another one out hopefully by Sunday. We won’t be at the Manor for too long—we need to see what happens when Draco gets back and the whole school knows that he’s dating The Boy Who Lived!
“Yeah, of course,” Draco tried to keep his voice even as his hands shook. He opened the last one which was more of the same, and then went to gather the letters.
“He and his friends would pull all sorts of pranks. I think this helped them time everything. I also watched you a lot through it sixth year, when I thought you were up to something. The only place where it doesn’t display anyone is in the Room of Requirement. See?” Harry pointed to a corner of the map where his and Draco’s names were nestled together, much like they were on the couch. “Last night when you didn’t come back after a while, I checked the map. I saw you in the Forbidden Forest, not moving, and I came running.”
Draco swallowed another sip of the hot chocolate. “Well, thanks. I’m fine now. So you can go.” He looked down at his still trembling hands.
Draco felt anger surge in him. Why was Professor Dumbledore all of a sudden concerned about him? The old man knew exactly what Draco was trying to do for the entirety of sixth year and never bothered to reach out for help.
The Slytherins finally made it into the common room. They had made it through their afternoon classes and then hid in the library before making their way to dinner right before it ended. They all only wanted to be around each other, and since Draco and Greg both struggled with eating as it was, wanted to wait until the Hall was mostly empty.
. He focused his attention back on Professor McGonagall and dug his fingernails into his arm. “What are the consequences if I refuse?”
dozens of times, but never in Harry’s favor. Maybe that’s why he was having such a hard time finding the right words.
“We managed to crowd around you pretty quick so that not everyone saw what was going on. We can make something up to them later. But hey,” Harry nudged Draco with his shoulder. “Now you know how I felt when I fainted during the game in third year!”
“Hopefully the Wizengamot will approve this late this week. You could be seeing them as soon as next week, but it could also take as long as next month.” Draco shuddered at the thought of his mother being in Azkaban for a month.
“I’m fine, Mother, please don’t worry about me. I was actually preparing to write you a letter last weekend about what I’ve been up to, but...”
“Any day now. If not by the end of this week, there will be hell to pay. That much I can guarantee.” Lucius seemed to Draco like a pouting child who wasn’t getting their way.
Harry looked around the Hogs Head. He looked nervous. “You look nervous,” Draco said. “Don’t be nervous. They’d want me anyway, not you.” Draco hated the thought of Harry being upset or anxious in any way.
Draco felt himself freeze. He totally forgot about his...cousin? Draco wasn’t one hundred percent sure of the relation, but he certainly remembered Voldemort’s mocking comments about the child born from a half blood and a werewolf. He tried to catch the last bit of the conversation, and heard that Andromeda was planning to come with infant Teddy the next day. Draco looked at Harry in panic. Harry nodded toward the living room, and they were able to escape without notice given the happy chaos in the other room.
Draco stood in the center of the living room for a moment, expecting to feel something more than the deep ache inside of him. Finally he walked outside and faced Harry.
The small group didn’t go far into the Forbidden Forest until they came to a small tent. It had different designated spots for flowers on the outside, and Draco could make out Fred Weasley’s picture illuminated by candlelight. Someone’s wand lit up the sign attached to the top of the entrance, which read, “DUMBLEDORE’S ARMY” and then in smaller letters, “IN HONOR OF THE FORGOTTEN.” Draco frowned. He had heard of people collectively calling those who died during the war “the fallen,” but never the forgotten.
Draco scratched the back of his neck, suddenly embarrassed. “What are you guys doing here? You’ll miss dinner.”
Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy’s retrial had been rescheduled to November 6th, so Draco had about a week to try and figure out how he could best help. Mr. Burke had assured him that he would be allowed to attend and would likely be called as a witness. Draco was glad that if Lucius had been involved with the elder Nott’s efforts to resurrect the Dark Lord, he had never shared any of his plans with Draco. Draco could confidently walk into the retrial knowing that knew absolutely nothing.
“Withholding the truth is a type of dishonesty,” Professor Dumbledore chimed in. While Draco felt pain in his heart hearing his departed teacher’s voice, he felt a pit in his stomach feeling the old Headmaster’s. “And, forgive an old portrait for being so blunt, but you look a bit ill, as you did in my last year as Headmaster.”
“I don’t need this. Do your stupid little project without me.” Amidst Harry’s protests, he walked out of the eighth year dorm and welcomed the vastness of the castle. It made him feel as small on the outside as he did within.
As he began to walk away and the rest of the group followed, Draco was having an extremely difficult time sorting out his feelings. He felt horribly nervous and embarrassed by what just happened, but also was insanely attracted to Harry in this moment. Draco remembered his sass, but forgot the utter strength and confidence with which he acted. If Draco could, he would kiss Harry right then and there, even though they hadn’t shared that moment at all yet.
Draco grabbed his trunk, this time finding the strength inside of him to lift it off the ground completely. Then he stepped outside into the new world, feeling sure that it would be an even better one were he not in it.
was cracking jokes at his family’s expense. What he did care about was the absolutely horrifying attitude toward which the newspaper treated Harry Potter. The paper alternated between praising Harry Potter as though this was the stance it had taken from the beginning and criticizing Potter for not doing more to help the current Death Eater crisis. They made remarks such as “Potter seemingly doesn’t care about the remaining Death Eater threat, as he has turned down multiple invitations from various departments at the Ministry to come assist...” and “Potter and fellow war heroes Hermione Granger and Neville Longbottom were seen with a group of Slytherins at the Ministry. Is Potter being bribed or coerced, or is his only concern pardoning former war criminals rather than trying to catch more?”
Harry stroked Draco’s palm with his thumb. “I really don’t think your mother would let Lucius throw you out. She loves you more than anything.” Draco knew Harry was right, but Harry also didn’t understand the influence his father had in the household.
Harry sighed in tandem. “I should have known she’d be upset. I guess it’s just so obvious to me that you’re not a threat.”
“Because you’re a human being! I have never wanted anything bad to happen to you. Well,” he smirked. “Anything
“You shut up about my family, Goyle.” He and Goyle have never been on last name terms, except as a joke. This was no laughing matter. “I can’t help what Potter does, and trust me, part of me would rather be rotting in Azkaban than sitting here with you.” Draco couldn’t control his anger, even though he knew that defending his family was a nearly impossible task. Malice was a reflex of his, particularly when he felt as vulnerable as he did sitting at the same table as Harry Potter.
Besides the factual information, Draco also realized that though reporters such as Rita Skeeter no longer had articles in circulation, the journalists of the
The two students cleaned up their supplies. “Alright,” Harry said with a satisfied sigh. “We did it. Thanks, Draco, I appreciate it. I promise I’ll repay you. Ready to head to Hogsmeade?”
There was no clear and quick solution, and Draco didn’t want to draw attention to himself by just staring blankly at the door. He took a deep breath and walked inside.
No it wasn’t. He was in a burning room clutching onto Potter for dear life, he couldn’t breathe, he could smell the smoke, he couldn’t believe Potter was trying to comfort him—
Arthur beamed and shook Bill’s hand. Even Draco had to add his voice to the chorus of congratulations.
The walk back to the castle made Draco’s legs quiver with each step. He jumped every time a tree branch shook. So many questions spun through his mind. Did anyone know about the resurrected Dumbledore’s Army? Did Professor McGonagall know, and that’s why the thestrals weren’t there to take Draco up to the castle? And, perhaps most importantly, why in the world was Draco sent the missing Time Tuner? Who sent it?
Harry smiled. “Me too. It just feels like it’s something that we should be doing, you know? I mean I hear Hermione and Ron talk about it...”
“They are fine,” Yarney glanced down at a piece of parchment, likely some sort of a communication device. “The Malfoy Manor is currently being searched along with the homes of every other former Death Eater.”
The rest of the morning was blissfully uneventful for Draco, but still incredibly exhausting. He had Transfiguration after Defense Against the Dark Arts which went poorly. Professor McGonagall disabled his manacle so he could practice spells, but he was awkward and clumsy with the wand and ending up turning his peach into a rooster instead of a dove. He could definitely tell that many of the other eighth years were snickering behind his back as he dove to catch the bird to shut it up. Professor McGonagall had to help him for nearly the entire period while everyone else moved on to turning a cucumber into a pigeon.
“Yeah, I think we’re about ready to head out. Thank you again, Hagrid. You really helped us out last night.”
Professor McGonagall looked at him strangely, and for a moment Draco was terrified that she would refuse him. “Of course,” she stated. She spoke the password and he followed her up to her office. He gulped as he climbed the steps around the gargoyle. He remembered how much he hated visiting the Headmaster’s office. The last two occupants of the place haunted his dreams regularly, for very different reasons each.
“I’m not sure if it is. I’m sure when people find out, they’ll think I coerced Harry somehow. A love potion, the Imperious Curse, something like that. Even if it did help our reputation, my father is too prideful to accept that help from someone that he hated for years and years. In his opinion, his downfall started at the end of our fifth year, when Harry went to the Ministry. He’ll never forgive Harry for that, even though he’s saved all our arses since.”
“Mr. Malfoy, we can sit and stare at each other all evening if you’d like, but I’m sure there are better ways to spend your Friday evening. Why does this give you such anxiety? The Healers are very nice people, and the students who have tried it thus far have found it extremely helpful.”
He saw the path where he had taken Potter’s hand just then. Tonight when the nightmares came, Potter didn’t mock him, just brought him a cup of tea and sat on the end of his bed, talking nonsense until Draco’s heart rate slowed. He saw himself able to feel comfortable at the eighth-year table, giving Potter a friendly nod once and a while. He saw himself comforting Potter when he had a nightmare—he must have them, wouldn’t he?—and making him tea, and maybe telling him that he was sorry—
“What is he talking about? What snake?” Someone else was speaking but they didn’t matter. Only Harry could fix all this.
“Death Eater scum. Not so brave now that your master’s gone are you?” Draco didn’t recognize the dark-haired boy even when he spun around to take a closer look.
“No,” Draco said quickly. He wasn’t upset with Greg for making light of it, a lot of people did, but Draco knew better than most how serious the Unbreakable Vow was. “Fine. It’s someone at Hogwarts and you do know them.”
Finally, Saturday came. Surprisingly, Harry and Draco hadn’t discussed their upcoming outing much, even though on Saturday morning they woke up next to each other as always.
He gathered his trunk, Harry’s jacket safe inside, and stepped off the train onto Hogwarts grounds near the Forbidden Forest. Strangely, though, the thestrals were not waiting to pull him to the school as he had been assured they would be. He rolled his eyes, annoyed at the prospect of having to walk nearly a mile to his dorm, but shuffled his shoulder bag and started on his way. Something inside of him called out a warning, but he pushed it aside. He didn’t want to be anxious, he wanted to be excited.
“Well, I didn’t even want to start it. It was Hermione’s idea. So much of what I’ve done has been through the help of other people, or just luck.”
Harry was right—Draco did barely remember that night. Though putting his body through seven flights of stairs made the next morning horrifyingly painful, Draco was able to be discharged the following Wednesday with strict instructions to stay inside, as it was now mid-October and chilly, take it easy, and not put himself through any stressful situations. Unfortunately Mr. Burke also heard that Draco was now well again, and reminded him about filling out the application to see his parents. Draco had been so ill over the past week that he nearly forgot that his parents’ trial was only in about a dozen days.
“You’ve saved my life, Potter,” Draco used Harry’s last name good-naturedly. “That about does it forever.”
“I’m not trying to play at anything! I just don’t know what you guys want. I really am willing to do whatever it takes for you to leave me alone.”
The crowd hushed suddenly, and Draco’s hand flew to his robe pocket to grasp his new wand. But the silence was only because Professor McGonagall had taken the stand, a sizable group of first years standing by her waiting to be sorted. She was beaming down at the crowd, head held high. “Hello students. It is my great pleasure to welcome all of you back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.” Cheers erupted in the crowd with some already waving their hats. Once everyone had quieted, the elderly Headmistress continued to speak.
There was only one incident in which Potter pushed the situation further. To Draco’s horror, Potter sat on his bed. Draco kept writing, trying to ignore him. “Is this about the Patronus situation?” Draco stopped scribbling and clenched his fist in anger. “You’ll get it, Draco, I promise. And tell you what—if you still can’t do it after a few weeks, I’ll switch to something else that we can do in front of the class. I’m not out to get you or anything—“
“Don’t have the energy to be up to anything. ‘Sides, both sides hate me. Your side hates me, the Death Eaters hate me...everyone hates me. But it’s fine!” Draco added this part quickly as he saw Harry’s crestfallen expression. “I deserve it.”
“No matter what—I love you. I’m not going to hide from my parents anymore. Anything’s worth it, if I can be with you.” Draco didn’t even know what the
“You’re almost late anyway. Professor McGonagall wanted us in the Great Hall at 8am to get our class schedules. How are you feeling?”
“Oh, you’re going to start throwing people in Azkaban randomly again? You can’t just be useless for three years and then all of a sudden throw around your power just to reclaim order—“
“Draco, Draco look at me—“ someone was tilting his head toward them, and Draco willed himself not to retch again.
“But—“ Draco looked helplessly toward the door where he knew somewhere his mother was waiting on the other side. “You could go, and I could stay here—“
“But, mate, you know that if you need us at all over the holiday, all you have to do is write,” Blaise said.
“Um...” Draco wanted to test the waters while there was a pause in the conversation. “Did you know that Harry Potter is my roommate?”
That was, in fact, their first class of the day. Draco hesitantly entered the room in which he had practiced Unforgivable Curses the year before. He could nearly see the blood on the floor from those who had refused to do their homework in protest of the brutality. His heart rate increased, and he regretted eating such a big breakfast. However, to his relief, the classroom looked nothing like it did in the days of the Dark Arts. The chairs were arranged by pairs in a circular formulation with the Professor’s desk at the front of the room. Standing in front of the desk was a lithe, middle-aged woman wearing a beaming expression.
“I know, but it’s just so...unfair. I just want to be left alone. I just want everyone to let me live my life. I’ve never even be able to—“ Harry stopped, seemingly overwhelmed with emotion. He closed his eyes and put his head in his hands, rubbing furiously at his forehead. It broke Draco’s heart to see him so upset.
Draco was still shivering later that night by the fire, but he was sure he had never been happier. “I don’t think we should have been out there that long,” Harry said, bringing Draco his third mug of hot chocolate. “I think your body is still recovering.”
“I’m sorry,” Professor McGonagall said after a period of silence. “I know that you were injured today and should take it easy. Do you want to spend the night in the Hospital Wing?”
Draco immediately became defensive. “I wasn’t—I mean I was just needed some air. It’s a nice view up there. I wasn’t trying to...”
“No mate,” Greg said, leaning against the bedpost and picking up Draco’s textbooks. “We understand, we’re all super busy. Plus, it’s amazing seeing you so happy.”
“Because blood loss is a serious thing Mr. Malfoy, and you didn’t take any potions for it! I will not have any students dying under my watch.” She jotted down a note for Madame Pomfrey and handed it to him. Draco took this as a cue to leave and stood up.
Draco thought of Harry and stood by his word. “With all due respect, Mr. Burke, I’m not going to sit for ten minutes and be berated for no reason. My father in his right mind wouldn’t want that.”
“OI!” Draco startled awake to see Ron Weasley standing in the doorway. “You’ve nearly slept through breakfast, Mum will lose it if you don’t get down there. Plus, I’ll need to wash the sheets.” He wasn’t being unfriendly, but Draco could tell he was trying to compensate for his discomfort. Draco looked to his left and found Harry’s bed empty, the sun cascading over the comforter. How long had he been asleep?
“I’m fine. It’s Potter that you should be worried about.” The last sentence just sort of slipped out, and it even caught Draco by surprise that he was confiding in Granger.
“I DON’T HAVE IT, YOU DO! I’VE NEVER HAD IT!” Draco was shouting now, his right arm burning all the way up, just like the Mark did, as his body begged to release some of its anger in the form of magic. “This is just a fucking ruse so that you all feel better about the fact that you can’t change the past. No one can, not even with that goddamn Time Turner. The people you love are hurt and dead, and you want someone to blame. It’s not going to be me this time.” Draco stood up to leave, but a burly looking Ravenclaw blocked his path.
“So that takes care of that,” Neville took over again. “Next on the agenda is dividing into groups to present project ideas by the holidays. In December we’ll hear presentations and vote as a group on which elements of which projects we want to incorporate into our final memorial. We’re going to let you guys pick groups as long as you have at least three different houses represented in your group. Everyone divide up, introduce yourselves, and discuss some preliminary ideas. We’ll work until lunch, and then everyone has the rest of the day to relax before our term starts tomorrow.”
“Yeah, you’ve never been there before?” Draco hadn’t. It never would have occurred to him to interact with house elves—he saw enough of the abuse that Dobby took from his father. He didn’t want to be rude to house elves like Lucius, but he didn’t know what level of civility they deserved either.
Draco nodded in appreciation. He glanced out the window and was startled to recognize some of the scenery—they were almost to Platform 9 and 3/4. “I’ll be back.” Draco slipped away and went to the compartment where Harry was with his friends. Harry met his eyes and immediately went out toward Draco. They both stepped toward the gallery where they could watch the trees rush by.
“Is that what you did this summer?” Draco made eye contact and glared at Christine—he wondered if she was using Occlumency, and make sure to actively close his mind. Her expression didn’t change.
Draco snapped out of his stupor. He was going to leave tonight, no matter what. He couldn’t stand to be in this household regardless of how far away he stayed from his parents. Draco quickly opened his trunk and pulled out the special notebook to write a message to Harry.
Uh oh. It looks like word is getting around the school somehow that Harry and Draco are involved. How do you think the other students will react? What more do you want to see? I can’t wait to write holiday scenes in this fanfiction!
It turned out that Draco had done significant damage to his fingers from the hypothermia, the tips of which may have permanent loss of feeling. However, all of them stayed intact, and he was even able to return to classes that day after a promise to talk to Christine about what had happened. He was in the middle of brewing a difficult potion when a first year walked into the classroom and handed Professor Slughorn a note.
“Good,” Ginny said. “You deserve to be jinxed for the rest of your life for all that you’ve done.” She paused for a moment but lowered her wand, seemingly unsure of what to do with him.
Greg stared into the flames for a moment more and then whipped around to face Draco. “Do you fancy someone?”
“One more thing, Mr. Malfoy.” The Headmistress’s voice all of a sudden got gentler. “I had a conversation with Mr. Potter today. He told me that you were attacked.”
These thoughts rattling around in his mind made it very difficult to concentrate on producing a Patronus. Draco and Harry were running out of time—they were supposed to start teaching the rest of the class in the month of December, giving them about three weeks to prepare. Draco was very confident in Harry’s Occlumency abilities, although he realized a little too late that it may be difficult to give a demonstration on something happening inside someone’s head. Then he remembered the Triwizard Tournament. If they could stare at a lake and a cloudy hedge maze for an hour, the students could certainly sit through a lesson on Occlumency.
“Please, please help, someone please, I can’t, someone please,” he was sobbing quietly to himself. At least, he thought he was speaking aloud in between gulps of air, but everything felt so loud that he couldn’t tell his internal voice from his external one. An amount of time passed this way, Draco was sure it had to have been hours or days, but it seemed just as dark as it had when the attack started. Maybe the sun had gone out. Maybe he was dead. He wasn’t shaking anymore, wasn’t even cold.
Draco had come to terms with that and was almost looking forward to it. The Malfoys sat in the parlor, waiting to be taken away by the Ministry. Instead, the lawyers said that a certain someone convinced Kingsley Shacklebolt to hold a trial before their imprisonment. Until that time they were to be on house arrest. Because they did not commit as high crimes as other Death Eaters (their biggest offense was housing the Dark Lord), their trial was scheduled in a month’s time at the beginning of July. This was already bad news to Draco, who had finally come to terms with his death after facing it for nearly two years, but finding out Potter was cooperating the Minister on his behalf nearly sent him over the edge.
“A good question indeed,” Professor McGonagall said as she sat down at her desk. “What can I do for you, Mr. Malfoy?”
“Silence. We shall continue,” Hale thundered. “How did Nott Sr. react when you informed him of your decision?”
He had drawn enough attention to himself for a lifetime. It was odd to try and be inconspicuous after years of trying to gain as much attention and prowess as he could. He wasn’t very good at it, either.
Draco and Harry try to end their first outing on a pleasant note—but end up running into someone unexpected
Draco and Blaise sat across from Gregory and Daphne at the very end of the table, while all the other eighth years gathered as far away from them as possible. It was Potter, Granger, and Longbottom that sat the closest to them, but even they kept a respectable distance.
It was a gorgeous fall day at Hogwarts. He could see the lake where the giant squid lived, the water reflecting the clear blue sky. The temperature was mild with a slight wind, just enough for him to smell the ripening fruit on the trees. Draco stepped closer and closer to the edge.
Draco pushed aside a bit of disgust at the thought of Weasley and Granger having sex. “I think it’s high time we stop letting other people tell us what we should be doing.” All of a sudden, a switched flipped in Draco’s mind. This conflict with the Time Turner wasn’t out of hand yet. He could take control.
I’m thinking about making this a multiple series work. What do you guys think? It’s already like nearly 40k words and they’ve been through one week of school, lol. But I still have so much story to tell! Let me know.
gay,” Blaise reassured Greg. “I’m sure he’s just going through one of his moods; you know how he can be. You didn’t do anything wrong and I’m sure he’s not upset with you. If he’s not all sorted out by next week, we’ll talk to him.”
“WAIT!” Draco said. He couldn’t be trapped here, it reminded him too much of being shut away in his own home for the past two years. “I want to speak with my family lawyer.”
Draco obliged, but sat in a chair away from her rather than on the couch next to her. “Mother. My whole life, I have tried to be a good son. Even when that has meant breaking the law. Even when that has meant nearly killing some of my classmates. I love you, and I will always be here for you. But you cannot ask me to deny myself happiness for the rest of my life.”
“I’m going to Hogsmeade with Potter on Saturday,” Draco said suddenly at dinner the next day. The Great Hall was mostly empty, since that’s when the eighth year Slytherins would have the lowest chance of getting insults hurled at them.
. He hadn’t time at Hogsmeade today to get her a present, but now it didn’t even matter—she wouldn’t be able to receive it.
“I’m not crazy, Potter. I didn’t spend years having delusions, or whatever you’ve claimed to have happen to you.” Draco couldn’t work up the energy to put enough malice in his voice.
“Vincent and I...we were planning to graduate together, live together, and...er...just have a life together.”
“I know,” Draco said truthfully. “I’m going to do everything I can to not let that happen.” Seemingly satisfied, Ginny nodded and let him go once they reached the grounds of Hogwarts. She didn’t follow him inside, but went to return to whatever she was doing in the Forbidden Forest. Draco wondered if she was doing alright.
“No one asked for your opinion, Mud—hey!” Draco had tensed when Blaise said the first syllable of the curse word, but his cry of pain and Daphne’s glare told him he had nothing to fear.
But Harry’s intentions in saying that were good, and Draco was happy that he successfully finished another civil conversation with the Boy Who Lived. Harry turned out the lights and Draco got back under the covers, hoping that sleep would be the one thing that would come easy to him.
And so the conversation went forth very amicably. Soon, Draco and Ron were ribbing on each other for various fights and arguments they had in their school years. Harry joined in, and the three were laughing until the sun began to set.
Greg smiled at him. “Of course it is, mate. A friend of yours is a friend of ours.” Blaise scoffed, and Daphne glared at him.
“You did,” Granger agreed. “But I can see that you’re trying now. When’s the last time you said ‘Mudblood’ anyway?” Draco didn’t respond, but he was sure it had been nearly a year. “Exactly. I don’t have the energy to hate you anymore, Malfoy. No offense meant, but it’s not really worth it.”
“It was...quite sudden. We asked him if we could have some time to think about it, but he pressed us. He said that a day to think about it would be allowed but the sooner the better.”
Draco was staring at the ceiling, but he could feel Harry’s gaze on him. “I thought you weren’t allowed to go,” Harry said evenly.
“No, I...house elves don’t generally like me. I just don’t want to bother them.” Draco got up and followed Harry.
Draco wasn’t sure when his parents’ trial started, but the sooner they got to the Ministry of Magic, the better. They could definitely kill time there anyway. Draco was wearing another subtle disguise, this time different color glasses frames and a boulder hat much like the ones that Cornelius Fudge used to wear. It certainly wouldn’t stop from people recognizing him if they took a good look, but it would potentially stop jeers from afar.
“Come, dear, let’s just go in the other room to think,” Narcissa spoke quietly. She grabbed his cane and started to lead him upstairs. “Stay here,” she whispered to Draco.
“I love you too. Take care of yourself, alright?” He made eye contact with his father as he said this, and his father nodded. Draco hoped he could trust his father to take care of Narcissa, trust him to do this one thing right.
Draco’s eyes narrowed. “He wasn’t a Death Eater. I never saw him and the Dark Lord in the same room.”
“Where are all your—little fans Potter? Don’t you want to bask in your glory?” Draco’s tone started as confusion and ended as malice. That definitely took longer than it should have. Draco couldn’t think of a proper insult for a moment, and the one he came up with didn’t have nearly as much bite as his insults used to have.
“However, we cannot move forward without acknowledging what is behind us. We have all been greatly affected by the Second Wizarding War. We have lost loved ones, been injured in the mind and body, and continue to remember those dark days. The fallen will not be forgotten for their ultimate sacrifice.” She paused, and everyone bowed their heads in mourning. “In this poignant moment, I am pleased to announce that those who have returned to Hogwarts at the age of eighteen to earn their degree properly—our eighth year students—will have the year-long project of deciding how we should remember our heroes, and our villains.”
“Malfoy, this war didn’t change you a bit. You only care about yourself. You don’t want to make amends. You have nothing to say about my sister or all the other people whose lives you ruined.” Justin was shaking with rage as he rattled off accusations.
After a few moments of silence, Draco looked over to see Harry staring at the cauldron, his eyes far away. “You alright?”
“A Time-Turner,” Narcissa said, and everyone in the courtroom gasped as they realized the implications. Draco swallowed.
The next few days went by extremely slowly. For once, the thing stressing Draco out was trivial. He wasn’t worried about an evil figure in his house, imprisonment, torture, or any of those things—rather, he was concerned about his upcoming outing with Potter.
“What am I supposed to do, have you guys surround me like guards? No, I’ll take whatever comes to me.”
And with that, Draco was left alone in Professor McGonagall’s office. Mr. Burke’s words echoed in his head.
“Well, don’t let me disturb you,” Draco said, moving toward his desk but not quite knowing what to do. He still felt Harry’s eyes on him.
“That’s it though, wouldn’t it be nice to have some sort of semblance of order? Maybe we should strictly be friends right now, you know? Not sharing a bed, not being dependent...just
There were a few false starts to Draco waking up that night. He fell asleep to Hagrid’s low, gruff yet somehow soothing voice, with Harry responding in between. Then there was a period where everything was quiet, but Draco still felt Harry’s presence next to him. Then, sometime later, he felt his body shift to lying horizontally on the couch, and felt the sudden cold on the side previously touching Harry but now replaced by a blanket—it wasn’t enough. His sleepy mind tried to suppress the shivers—of course Harry wouldn’t want to sit up the whole night, and he shouldn’t feel like he had to. Draco opened his eyes blearily to sneak a peek, just to make sure Harry was still there. He wasn’t. It was still dark outside, but Draco needed to find him. Upon sitting up, however, and promptly vomiting into a well-placed bucket as the world spun around him, he decided that he would look in the morning.
Both boys drew their wands, even though Draco knew his would be useless. Antonin Dolohov was standing behind them, wand out, and a smirk on his face. Draco nearly collapsed to the ground—this was one of the most powerful Death Eaters who fled after Voldemort’s fall, and one of the biggest names that the Aurors hadn’t found yet. Draco certainly feared for himself, but felt a deep ache inside for the boy next to him, who had to fight evil alone yet again...
“No—don’t—“ Draco didn’t want to be touched right now. Potter looked at him for a moment and left the room.
“Of course, what else would I be talking about?” Harry looked extremely confused, so Draco pressed on. “Pureblood homes have ancient magic in them. If the occupant, even if it is the rightful heir, rejects the home, the home will reject him in turn.”
Draco swallowed, feeling sick and anxious again. “He did recognize me when we were out. Mr. Burke, I mean. He said that my father was right, that I was trying to sabotage the family, and that he couldn’t trust me in a courtroom.”
Draco gave a small, humorless laugh. “It’s kind of great, in a way, that these are the problems we’re facing.” He gestured to the
“No, you would still remember they happened. You just wouldn’t have any emotion to them, and the details would be less clear. I didn’t want that to happen to me. The memories I have of you as a child are some of my happiest, and I would be devastated if I even lost a little clarity on what happened. So I just talked to myself the entire time I was in Azkaban. I recited stories that I knew from when I was a little kid, I gossiped to myself about the other families, and did other things to distract myself. I didn’t want to think of anything positive once. It’s just good to have someone to talk to now.”
Reaching an internal compromise with himself, Draco gave the letter to Greg, the only one who looked skeptical at the prospect of Draco handing it over to the Ministry. “Burn it.”
Saying goodbye to his mother was hard, even though he knew that he would see her in a little over a month. It almost seemed to be harder for him than it was for her. She had changed out of lounging clothes and into something a little more proper, a little more like herself.
Draco took slight offense at Harry’s joking tone. “Fine. I will.” He turned on his side to face away from Harry.
“Yeah, she was trying to get me to say who it was. She just doesn’t get it though. You don’t either. And I’m not even saying that...er, what I mean is I’m not angry. You just don’t understand what it’s like to be this hated, and you never will.
“Oh come on, before the weather turns too cold! One weekend won’t hurt. I could even change your appearance, if you’d like to go disguised. Ask him to go with you this Saturday!”
Draco racked his brain. It was hard to remember what all he confessed to doing in those hazy days right after the battle. But given that he didn’t care much about self-preservation at the time, he was sure that he told Mr. Burke and the Wizengamot everything they needed to know. “I don’t think so.”
“Rise and shine—I was just going to wake you actually. We should get our robes on, we’re almost there.”
“Oh don’t worry,” Harry said with a smile on his face that Draco couldn’t decipher. “It’s definitely good enough. What do you think, Draco?”
He fully returned to himself steadily, as he often did after a massive panic attack. He knew logically everything that happened that evening, but he didn’t feel any sort of emotions toward it all. Harry was next to him on the couch, his arm boldly around Draco, and Hagrid sat in a chair across from them, telling senseless stories. Draco knew that he was fully back, but Harry didn’t yet. Draco didn’t want this moment to end, didn’t want to return to just one of the infinite amount of times he would have to face what he had done. And so he let his body fall on Harry’s shoulders, watching from above as both boys’ mouths curved into pained and broken smiles.
As he closed his eyes, he concentrated on watching these images fly past him again and again, a cycle of comfort in which he could maybe find some peace.
“Yes, which was killing Dumbledore. That makes all those accidents really worth it,” Zacharias Smith drawled, much like Draco did when he was trying to annoy someone.
Harry glanced at Draco strangely and sighed. “Come on.” Harry helped support Draco’s weight as he got to his feet.
“I—er,” Potter sighed. “I overheard you once, after Slughorn’s party. Talking to Snape, and he was trying to look into your mind.” Draco was enraged as he remembered that night.
“Draco, why did you do this?” Draco turned his head to see Potter, his hair pressed to his forehead from sweat, glaring at him.
Draco was silent, thinking of what to say. Potter was his nemesis, but he couldn’t really think of an insult for that logical of an argument. And he wasn’t sure that he wanted to start an argument with Potter. After all, no one was around. Couldn’t he be himself?
“I can cool it down a little bit more,” Christine waved her wand again. “But it seems as if you’re in distress. That’s normal, we’re talking about some pretty heavy stuff. I need to know what you’re going through, though, so that I know how to help.”
And so, Draco found himself continuing to see Christine. He did learn some useful techniques for calming down panic attacks, and realized he was able to walk around Hogwarts grounds without much incident. The main thing stressing him out at the moment was the situation with his parents. Mr. Burke contacted him saying that a retrial had been set for the first of November, and so they would be in Azkaban until then. He had also enclosed another application for Draco to visit his parents, emphasizing to him that he likely wouldn’t be able to do so until early October. Having time to think, Draco hadn’t yet filled out the application. He knew he wanted to see his mother, but he wasn’t sure he was ready to face Lucius again, especially knowing that an additional month in Azkaban would have made his father worse, not better.
Draco had been rehearsing this in his head all day. If Harry didn’t seem interested in the idea of going to Hogsmeade with Draco, the latter would just say they could go as friends with a group. Draco shifted uncomfortably in the bed, the weight of what he wanted to say preventing him from settling.
A glance at the clock told Draco that he only had about half an hour to gather his things and head up to the Headmistress’s office. He finished up his paragraph, gathered his things, and left the library, trying to look as inconspicuous as he could. Still, he encountered disgusted looks and jeers from older students as he walked through the halls. He noticed that first-years literally took different routes to avoid being near him—they’ve probably heard the stories by now. He sighed as he told the Gargoyle the password and walked up the stairs to the Headmistress’s office.
“The questioning may commence. Narcissa Malfoy, please tell me what you did the as soon as He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named fell this past May.”
As always, comments are appreciated! I love you guys. Also note that this fanfiction will be slightly shorter at 20 chapters (unless I change my mind). Who knows what I’ll do after that!
Hermione, Neville, and Harry looked at Draco to see if he minded including the Slytherins, while Draco was looking at them for the same reason. He gave a nod and smile to his friends, and brought them up to speed. Surprisingly, no one tried to tell Draco that this was a stupid idea or that he was crazy. They were all supportive, and more shockingly, very willing to work together. Greg and Neville mused about different disguise options to each other while Daphne, Blaise, and Hermione worked out some of the optics. Harry and Draco smiled at each other, and Draco felt like he was a part of something bigger—a feeling he had experienced before as a Death Eater, but this time was proud of it rather than horrified with himself.
The shrines were certainly unsettling. Draco foolishly looked for Vincent’s, but his eyes kept being drawn to Fred’s, which was the biggest of them all. His smiling face in a picture with his twin brother was illuminated by candlelight, which worried Draco due to the amount of parchment spread around the shrine. Each was folded for the sake of secrecy, and there were dozens. Draco looked around, but it appeared that all of Dumbledore’s Army was still in the shack. He was a little early, and he wanted some context for what he was about to do. So, against his better judgement, he bent down and opened one of the sheets of paper.
“I know,” Harry said. “I’m sorry for involving her but I just don’t think it’s fair that you can’t even defend yourself. It’s more than unfair, it’s dangerous.”
I am very much not good at writing trial scenes and I don’t enjoy it particularly much, so if this was halfway decent I’ll be a happy camper! We’ll get back to Hogwarts and back to Harry and Draco’s relationship after the next chapter—just need to do a teeny bit more establishing of the plot.
“Did you know that St. Mungo’s has started hiring Mind Healers?” Harry spoke up after a moment. “I’ve been seeing one, I still do. It’s really been helping.”
“Blaise is right. I think you should tell Mr. Burke right away, or even an Auror. Turn this letter in without opening it. It’ll make you look good,” Daphne added.
Granger furrowed her eyebrows. “That’s not what I heard. He was actually telling me that he felt like a burden to you, that he should probably give you more space.”
“Oh, Saint Potter sticking up for Malfoy, how sweet.” Draco suddenly recognized the voice to be of Zacharias Smith. He was one of the few in the school that seemed to hate both Gryffindors and Slytherins and could also annoy them both. “What, are you guys dating now?”
The car ride was blissfully silent, and then Draco entered Wiltshire. Malfoy Manor appeared like a looming, dark cloud. It looked a great deal better than it had when Draco left in September. The window panes had been washed and some of the roof tiles replaced. The gardens were not flourishing but were no longer overrun with weeds. Draco wasn’t sure if it was the work of his mother or house elves, but he hoped it was the former and done as a sign of healing.
I had always wondered, what happened to like the hundreds of Death Eaters right after Harry killed Voldemort? Like there’s no way the Aurors could have rounded them all up at once—most of them had to flee. Anyway sorry to leave you on a cliffhanger, I’ll try to have the next one out by Friday! Let me know what you think. Love to all, especially my loyal readers!!!
One after another, the students Floo’ed into a new Ministry checkpoint. Using Floo Powder to get into the Ministry was heavily regulated since the war, and they were only able to do it in the first place because the Headmistress’s Floo was trusted on the network. Once they reassembled, they walked up to the checkpoint station, where they were greeted by a bored witch—that is, until she looked up.
While Harry was thriving in Occlumency, Draco had made very little progress in learning how to produce a Patronus. Sometimes he would lay awake at night, racking his brain for potential memories that would lead to success. The best he did was when he thought about a family trip with his parents that they had taken when Draco was very young, maybe five or six. They had gone to Paris for Bastille Day and watched the parade, and there was a fireworks show too. Draco had this image of him holding both his parents’ hands and looking up as they leaned over him to share a kiss. That night, Lucius carried the exhausted young boy back to their villa. Draco felt safe and protected, and like he was the luckiest kid in the world to have the parents that he did.
“It’s not the public you have to worry about,” Daphne said, putting her silverware down and leaning forward. “It’s us.”
“It’s just to help you breathe, but you need to calm down, Mr. Malfoy,” a gentle voice said, different from the first.
After the group assembled, they were able to walk to the Headmistress’s office. Professor McGonagall gave a curious glance at Draco, who tried his very best to avoid eye contact. However, she let him go with the others without saying a word.
It’s time for Draco and Harry to present their Defense Against the Dark Arts project. Also, Draco revisits a memory.
As the two walked back to their room, not quite hand-in-hand but fingers touching along the way,  Draco knew two things for sure. Number one: he never wanted Harry to be mad at him again. Number two: the fact that Harry cared enough to be mad at him was one of the best feelings in the world.
The next day brought a triple period of Defense Against the Dark Arts, during which the students would give their presentations. Draco had told Harry he wanted to go first. He wanted to get it over with, and he hoped that by the time the hours passed, his peers would forget what a failure he was.
She nodded to Neville who started speaking, as though they had meticulously rehearsed this little presentation. “We’ve all been through a lot. Some of us were here last year and it was awful, some of us weren’t here last year and it was also awful. But we made it through the War, and a lot of people didn’t. This year is about honoring those people, and honoring ourselves by making sure it is as good a year as it can be.”
And though there hadn’t been an incident like when the Ravenclaw boy had cut him in a while, Draco had a lot of mild burns, cuts, and bruises from when students randomly jinxed him in the hallways. One night Harry noticed a rather nasty burn on Draco’s upper arm as they were lying in bed together. He traced it sadly, watching Draco to see if he would wince.
Draco was shocked and somewhat embarrassed that his father brought up Harry. “Potter and I are roommates, Father. That’s it and that’s all we’ll ever be. I don’t like it any more than you do.”
“Hey, I can be a threat if I wanted to be!” Draco was mildly offended, particularly in his intoxicated state.
Draco was able to walk Harry through simple Occlumency exercises, in which people were blocked from reading Harry’s mind and Harry read Draco’s. For the first, Draco split the class in two. He made sure half the class couldn’t hear, then had the other half of the class tell Harry a simple story that he was supposed to picture. The other half then took turns trying to coax the story out of Harry’s mind, with the Professor trying last. Harry did well, and they only came up with vague details about a lost cat. For the second part, Harry left the room while the students placed chocolate frog cards in a particular order. Then, with Draco increasing his mental shields with each attempt, Harry successfully found the order of the cards in Draco’s mind multiple times.
Draco was tired now, and he desperately wanted to sleep. He tried to convey this to Harry, but his tongue felt like it was made of lead—his tongue! Is that why he couldn’t speak? Did he not have it anymore? “Harry, I left—“
“F—Father?” Draco said the greeting like a question—he was that unsure of the man sitting across from him.
Draco decided to retire to bed early that evening, giving Harry some quality time with the people that he loved. Yet he lay awake, not just because of the laughter that resounded below. He was going to meet his Aunt Andromeda for the very first time tomorrow. Not only that, but he would finally be able to put a face to the name of Teddy Tonks, who even the Dark Lord made fun of. Draco shuddered and finally fell in to a fitful sleep.
Draco was too physically and emotionally exhausted to question him, and allowed himself to be led to the eighth year common room. He never spent much time here. It seemed as though the rest of the friend groups had their own staked-out areas, but the Slytherins had no corner of the room. Harry led him right to Hermione and Neville, who were sitting on cushions near the fireplace. The crackling of the wood and the heat did not help Draco’s nerves.
A few more minutes passed—Draco must have fallen asleep again. He woke up to Granger shoving something into his hands and Potter hoisting him into a sitting position. “You have to drink this, Malfoy. It’ll help you feel better.”
“Okay,” Harry laughed. “I understand.” Harry came to sit next to Draco, their shoulders touching. “Are you alright? Well—as alright as can be?”
“Shut up, Malfoy.” Draco only pointed to a lack of suitors as a guess, but it seemed to hit the nail on the head of Smith’s temper. “You’ll get yours, I’m telling you.” And with that he stalked away.
“Shut up, Potter. I like you. I really, really do. I want to be with you. I want to go to Hogsmeade with you and hold your hand. I want to know every part of you, all your likes and dislikes and all your flaws. I want to go to sleep with you next to me every night. I want to tell you everything about myself. I want to spend as much time with you as I can, because I enjoy you that much.” Draco paused only to take a breath, and extend his hand. “Harry, will you go on a date with me?”
. He leaned back and looked her in the eyes. “I’m going to take care of you now. I promise. You won’t have to worry about any of this happening ever again.” Now that he examined her more closely, he noticed her graying hair and the new wrinkles around her eyes.
Harry propped himself up on an elbow. “I don’t blame you, after what he said to you last time.” He paused. “I know that my parents are dead, so maybe I just wouldn’t understand. But why would you put yourself through something like that again?”
“And she forced an apology out of you? Are you sure she wasn’t the one that attacked you?” Blaise’s eyes narrowed. Gregory kept his head down.
“What exactly do you have to do?” Draco was not expecting Potter to ask this. Unfortunately he didn’t have a response prepared because he couldn’t think of a single thing to do. For once, he wished for a ton of homework. “Come on,” Potter grabbed his arm—Merlin’s balls he’s pushy—and nearly dragged him toward where he was sitting with Dean Thomas and Susan Bones.
It also just occurred to me while I was writing this that Draco would have absolutely known Harry was telling the truth in fifth year. But it was to his family’s advantage that no one believed Harry. If only they could have connected a bit sooner, things would have been a lot different...
. He remembered the presence of his crush beside him. Certainly any plan that involved resurrecting the Dark Lord also involved harming Harry. Draco also realized how little he knew about the current situation. Was Theodore Nott Sr. in Ministry custody? What had happened to Draco’s old classmate, Theo? He all of a sudden wished that he had not burned the letter he had received from the younger Nott.
“There’s no need for that at the moment. You are not under arrested, you are merely being held until we determine what to do next. The Healer will come by to examine you soon.” Draco stammered, but Yarney shut the door.
The four Slytherins stood up and went to the back of the group. Draco noticed that during the walk, most groups clustered together by house. Granger, Finnegan, Thomas, and Longbottom were together at the front. The Parvati twins were the only two individuals talking from different houses. Hannah Abbott and Susan Bones were talking with Justin Finch-Fletchley and Ernest Macmillan, while the five remaining Ravenclaws climbed the stairs together as well.
“I thought someone back at the dorm could heal me quickly, it wasn’t a wound that warranted the Hospital Wing, in my opinion. It’s just that everyone was at lunch, and by the time I figured that out, I was too dizzy to walk there.”
“Not necessarily, although it couldn’t hurt.” Harry started laughing, a deep sound from his belly. “I’m serious! Try it next time you’re there. Try just being nice to it, or thanking it when it does something right. Let it know that any bad things that happened in the house, or things that you’re mad about, were not the fault of the house itself. Accept the house as a home.”
The hardest part was getting away at the end of the evening. Harry knew that Draco was caught up on his homework, and Draco was keeping Harry company while he did his. When the clock struck at the half hour past eight, Draco stood up from where he and Harry were perched in the common room. All the eighth years were used to their relationship after a week, and managed to keep their thoughts to themselves, especially when Harry was around. Draco didn’t want to flatter himself too much—it was more like they didn’t have the mental space to even think about him, as everyone was very busy with entrance exams into various Ministry professions.
“That’s quite alright.” If it wasn’t going to impede Draco too much in the long term, there was no point fixing it.
Draco cleared his throat and turned around, trying to give Harry space to recover and also thinking about his next move. He tried to keep his voice even when he spoke, though it quavered with emotion. “That was pretty good—I mean, I could tell you were trying to alter it. I think we should try a different memory next time, though, something that may be easier for you to change.”
“Malfoy?” Draco struggled to respond; nothing was making sense. Why didn’t Dolohov just kill Harry? Why did he want to capture Draco?
Hermione walked over and looked at some of the crumpled papers next to Draco. “This is really sweet,” she said. “I doubt they’ll listen, but it needs to be said. I wouldn’t tell Harry, though, he’ll just tell you you’re wasting your time.”
“Thank goodness for Harry Potter, looking out for us even now by keeping Malfoy in line. I hear his parents are going to be thrown into Azkaban tomorrow, maybe he’ll be next?” A fifth year that Draco only vaguely recognized moved past them, making sure her voice was loud enough for both of them to hear.
The paper transformed, ink lining the page like someone was drawing. Draco recognized the familiar shape of the Hogwarts grounds. Little footsteps moved across the parchment with names attached. It looked like a record of everyone that was in the school.
, so he took cares to keep the papers in his desk drawer. He, too, had to get used to throwing away dozens of hateful messages that arrived by owl each morning. But it was vastly different to be criticized by random strangers than to be berated by a prominent newspaper. It was this rage that caused Draco during one sleepless night to abandon his bed, which was still not shared by a stubbornly principled Harry, and enter the common room to write a letter to the
Draco shoved Potter’s hand off of him, sat up straighter, and put his head in his hands, still trying to even his breathing. His stomach rolled, and he turned away from Potter to vomit into the grass.
“No, listen. You’re a prick, and none of the deaths that happened on that night are your fault. Besides You-Know-Who’s death, that was your fault. But that was a good thing. The rest? Not even close. I would tell you otherwise since I don’t care about tiptoeing around your feelings like you’re fragile.”
“Harry and I were on a mission in Godric’s Hollow.” Draco let out a sigh, feeling extremely relieved.
“Really?” Harry tilted his head. “I hadn’t seen you with Daphne or Blaise much, but I thought you and Greg were thick as thieves.”
“Oh! I’ll get them.” She walked away—steadily and with her shoulders strong, Draco noted happily—and came back with a plate of cookies. “Sugar with sprinkles is still your favorite, yes? They may not be the same, I had to make them myself, but I figured since you haven’t had them in so long—“ Draco cut off Narcissa by standing up and taking her in his arms. He was only a little embarrassed at the tears that ran down his cheeks.
“Oh.” Harry broke out into a smile, then laughed. It was nearly infectious. “You sure have a funny way of—“
? Theodore Nott and his mother defected to France after his father ended up in Azkaban. Pansy Parkinson moved to America, wanted to break into the world of Wizarding fashion. He wasn’t sure where Blaise Zabini was. Vincent Crabbe was dead. He always knew the Greengrass family to be somewhat of blood traitors, so he was a little surprised to not see them—their reputation should have survived. As of right now, though, Draco was without cronies.
The day finally came. Parallel to their last Hogsmeade visit, which Draco prayed was a worse experience than this one would be, they took the train up to Hogsmeade, hiding under the Invisibility Cloak and staying in silence to avoid attracting any attention. Neither of them had discussed how open they wanted to be about what was going on with their respective friend groups and the school, and Draco worried that Harry may be mad if he knew that Draco had already told his friends about the impending date. However it seemed both of them came to a silent understanding that the people not expressly involved in their lives didn’t need to know what was going on right now. This feeling did not come out of shame, at least not for Draco, but out of fear. Draco didn’t need to be in the Prophet any more this week than the trial would already push him into the spotlight.
“Yes,” Lucius drawled. “Our son is making friends with the one person trying to ruin our lives. Don’t you understand, Narcissa? Harry Potter is behind all of this. He’s always been out to get Draco and ruin our reputation. I’m sure he arranged for the manacle to be put on Draco’s wrist. I’m sure he told McGonagall that they needed to be roommates, so that Harry could keep a closer eye on him. And now—“ Lucius briefly looked to the side at Draco for the first time since their secret confrontation. “—now we’re in this position,” he finished awkwardly. It was clear he meant to say something else.
The drop to the ground below looked more appealing than Draco wanted to admit. Then he thought of his mother, and took a step backward. She needed him and had done so much for him—he couldn’t let her down. He was horrified with himself for thinking about jumping for even a second.
“Woah, easy there Malfoy. Just because your father is a failure doesn’t mean you have to take it out on yourself,” The atmosphere cooled significantly after Dean Thomas spoke, everyone quieting down if they hadn’t already. Draco found himself looking around for Potter, but he was nowhere to be found. “Maybe that’s not the reason you’re doing it though. Maybe you’re doing it so that you can find the strength to be around so many Mudbloods, eh?” Many winced at the sarcastic use of the slur, and Draco had to work hard to keep his face unbothered and even. Dean staggered over to Draco and continued as everyone else watched. “I wasn’t imprisoned at your house for long, Malfoy, but I was there long enough to see what a coward you really are.”
Harry may not be doing as well as he seems—and the Aurors don’t seem to have it all together either...
Lucius had mentioned Draco’s extra year as though it was his choice to go back rather than moving onto an unofficial job of lobbying at the Ministry. “I have. Blaise, Daphne, Gregory, and I have grown close.”
“Nevertheless,” Mr. Burke spoke calmly. “There is nothing more we can do. You must think of your son. I think he’s been struggling lately, and you need to be there to guide him into adulthood. Particularly if he is going to have to take over the family assets at the turn of the year.” Mr. Burke spoke about this like it was almost a certainty. Draco always knew he would one day inherit the Malfoy fortune, but he didn’t expect it to happen so young. He also was terrified at what his father would do if the fortune was taken from him while he was still living. The accusations he had hurled at Draco would become a reality.
“I’m fine, Lovegood.” Draco began to move past her back down the hallway, but she stepped forward and met him in the center of the tower.
“Let me down? Draco, I’m happy to just spend time with you, to get to know you. We truly don’t have to do anything special. In fact, I would love it if we just went to a nice dinner or something.”
Draco knew that he wasn’t entering a typical pureblood relationship, and realized with a gulp that he hadn’t entered one at all. How could it completely escape his mind that Harry was not of pure blood? The Potter side was sufficient, but Harry’s mother was Muggleborn. Not only was Draco disobeying his parents by entering in a relationship with a man—lying with the same sex was expected from time to time, but was to be done in secret—but he was going to be with a half-blood wizard. How would he ever be able to tell his parents? His friends were thankfully accepting, because to them blood purity had died with the Dark Lord, but what about his friends’ parents? How would he attend parties? How would he conduct business in the Wizarding world?
Mr. Burke sighed and ran a hand over his thinning hair. “Hopefully soon. I don’t even know much, the Aurors are keeping it so under wraps. They have Dolohov now and have been trying to get information from him, but he’s been slow to give it. There’s also business going on with the Notts. Have you had any contact with Theodore Nott?”
Harry grinned. “About us dating? There isn’t enough money in the world.” Draco glared at him. “Listen, Draco, I definitely don’t want to rule anything out. I mean, we’ve been sleeping in the same bed for weeks now. I certainly have some feelings for you. But I think that we should try to be friends first. And no offense, but that involves you calling me by my first name.”
Harry smiled. “Thanks, mate. You too, you look like you could use some relaxing. Falling asleep at five in the afternoon...”
Madame Pomfrey stopped him from getting up. “I know that you’re not technically injured, but I think you should stay here for the night. I can give you some Dreamless Sleep potion.”
Draco shifted in his seat. “I...I dunno. I think it’s best that he doesn’t get to know me. Wouldn’t want to corrupt him.”
“I’m your escort,” he said roughly. He wasn’t wearing Auror garb but something similar, and had his wand clenched in his fist.
“No,” Draco was surprised that Harry was preparing to fight. “It’s Mr. Burke, I think he recognized me.”
Draco was getting more and more agitated by the second. He was also angry with himself for being so concerned about these trivial things.
Harry smiled, a truly happy one. “Yeah, his name is Teddy. He’s adorable. I guess you guys would be related, huh?”
Hermione glanced at Draco, who swallowed. He was feeling sick and on the verge of an anxiety attack. He was focusing on breathing in and out like Christine told him to, drawing circles on the floor with his pointer finger as he did so. “Would you like to share something that happened to you, Malfoy?”
“He was furious,” Narcissa’s voice trembled. “He threatened our son. He threatened to murder us right there and take the Time Turner himself—though he didn’t know where it was. He said that if he ever succeeded in his plans, he would make sure that our family faced absolute brutality.” Her hand jerked, wanting to wipe away the tears that streamed down her face, but her hands were cuffed to the chair. “His taunts went on for a little while. When we refused to give way, he left, vowing that he would come back for the Time Turner.”
Their last stop was Zonko’s Joke Shop. Draco had never set foot in there—his father wouldn’t want him frequenting shops of nonsense. As soon as he and Harry stepped into the shop, greeted by a variety of noisy toys, he knew it was a bad idea.
The next thing Draco knew he was standing in front of the eighth year dormitory, shirt soaked through with sweat. He stopped to dry heave in the hallway before quietly entering the common area, which was thankfully empty. He crept to the end of the hallway to the room he shared with the Boy Who Lived.
Draco scoffed. “Of course not! I actually find it quite revolting how people dote over you.” He instantly regretted what he said. Why would he want to insult the boy he wanted to like him?
Draco thought that was very odd but Neville nodded along. “And I can discuss some reforms that need to be made at St. Mungo’s. So it’s not like it’ll be a total waste of time.”
“Okay, so honoring everyone. Does anyone have any initial ideas?” Draco’s arm was still warm where Harry had grabbed it. He sat on his hands to keep them from shaking.
“Are you ready?” Harry asked, holding some sort of a blanket in his hand. It was Halloween night, and finally Draco would be finding out what Harry needed him for so badly.
“You didn’t mess up anything, Draco. It’s his fault that the memory turned that way, not yours,” Blaise chimed in.
“First of all, I’m not trying to do anything with Potter, and our interactions are none of your business,” Draco found some of his old courage and haughtiness deep inside. “Second, I told the truth not for sympathy, but because I wanted you guys to know that I wasn’t off just having a grand old time when the Dark Lord was in power! Now move.” Draco didn’t want to give them any time or chance to attack him, so he roughly shouldered through Ernest and Justin. Thankfully they didn’t follow him.
Ginny didn’t bat an eye. “You tell me,” she said in a cold voice, and nodded to the wall next to them. Draco examined what he could with the faint light. There were plenty of pictures on the top, and on the bottom were mugshots. Some were crossed out with a big “X”, like Dolohov’s. Theodore Sr.’s was one of the dozen or so with no marks. Draco recognized his parents’ clean mugshots, one of which flipped up to reveal a second copy with an “X” on it underneath. And beneath their two photos was his grimacing face that he had been required to take before receiving his manacle and probation. His frown was unmarked save for a small, question mark at the top of the paper in black ink.
Draco caught the letter and looked at it with apprehension. It was clearly his father’s handwriting. Harry misinterpreted Draco’s hesitation. “Do you want to put gloves on before we open it? Or we could have the Ministry examine it first?”
“I mean, I died,” Harry said exasperatedly. “And I’m supposed to care about the thoughts of Lucius Malfoy, an even less sane one than before? I don’t think so.”
“Well,” the pale man said hoarsely. “Finally decided to show your face, eh?” Lucius Malfoy looked moderately better than he had when Draco last saw him. His face had filled out, and he no longer looked like he had two black eyes. But he still had a glassy expression, and his fists were clenched at the end of his trembling arms.
Another wizard swiftly interrupted her. “How were the Aurors not notified? Isn’t the Malfoy Manor being monitored by wards?” He wasn’t speaking to her so much as Kingsley Shacklebolt, the Minister of Magic, who sat only slightly raised among the members of the Wizengamot, not drawing attention to himself.
It was as if Harry could read his mind. “Try not to worry about that right now. If by tomorrow you still have all ten fingers and ten toes and can feel them, I’ll be happy.”
“Ah,” she set the paper down and lowered her spectacles. “There has been a misunderstanding, Mr. Malfoy. This is not an optional task. All of you eighth years are very close to my heart, and I know that the past year has been extremely trying for most of you. I want to hold you all to the same educational expectations as any NEWT student, but I cannot do that without knowing that you are getting assistance with the healing process.”
Granger came up to him at the end of Transfiguration and reminded him to keep drinking and eating sugary things so that his blood supply would replenish. He only managed a nod. Looking at her used to spark deep anger in him, as she was a Muggle-Born who consistently beat him in classes, but now he could only picture her lying on the floor in the Manor being tortured by his aunt. He had never discussed it with anyone, not even his friends, because he was worried what they would say. He didn’t think anyone deserved that, even a mud—it was too hard to even think of that word anymore.
The thought of Narcissa trying to fill the various hallways of the Manor with her voice broke Draco’s heart. “Why don’t you get in touch with Ms. Zabini?” A few years ago, all the remaining Sacred Twenty-Eight spouses met for tea at least twice a week. Draco knew that Narcissa had been particularly fond of Blaise’s mother.
The second group of individuals were not as close to Harry and thought that Draco was just making up getting his tongue cut out to try and win sympathy. They were particularly suspicious of what Draco was doing with Harry Potter.
That night Draco told Harry he was going to lie down rather than go to dinner. In reality, he spent the time in his room desperately trying to produce a corpeal Patronus. He was certainly better than when he had started, but his progress had plateaued. He always stood for a moment before casting the spell, practicing breathing techniques that his therapist, Christine, had taught him, and picturing his chosen happy memory fully in his mind. Then he pointed his wand, knowing he did the hand motion perfectly, and shouted “
The offer was tempting, but Draco knew that not returning to his room would arouse suspicion. The last thing he needed was Potter trying to follow him again. “I’m alright. I appreciate it.”
Draco nodded and stood up. He embraced his mother and kissed her on the cheek. “Then I’ll see you in a few days. But—mum,” he said, suddenly serious. “If things get bad here...you’d let me know, wouldn’t you?”
“Well...I guess I’m pretty good at producing a Patronus. And I managed to teach loads of friends during fifth year.” Draco’s blood ran cold. Of course he wouldn’t be able to cast a Patronus. He had been told that no Death Eater could, including his own father. And, as if right on cue, Potter looked toward him. “Have you ever produced one?”
? The answer was that Narcissa would do whatever was best for her family. So Draco nodded and allowed Harry to pull them both back under the Cloak. As they exited the area of the courts, Draco knowingly stopped using Occlumency, opened his mind, and said a silent prayer for his mother. Though he knew that she wasn’t in his mind listening to his thoughts, he hoped that somehow she heard him.
“Malfoy, I wanted to say that I really respect what you said the other day. I’m not sure I can forgive you fully, but I accept your apology. I know that it was real, and I know you’ve tried hard to change this year.” Longbottom extended a hand, which Draco took hesitantly but with a firm grip, like Lucius had always taught him.
It was legitimately difficult to remember that month, Draco was so ill. He couldn’t keep food down and he spent full days in bed, barely mustering the energy to walk to his bathroom. His father at first tried to comfort him and apologized endlessly for failing his son so greatly; then he got angry. He once tried to physically pull Draco out of bed, but the war had weakened him significantly, and even malnourished Draco could overpower him. That rare violent confrontation between Draco and his father did transform Lucius Malfoy back into a more recognizable version of himself—he even started doing business dealings again, and soon forgot about Draco. Good, Draco had thought. At least I can be of some use to this family.
Narcissa smiled. “You were right. It’s time for me to get back into the social world, and do what I do best. Mrs. Zabini and I are having lunch later this afternoon.”
“No reason,” Harry said, but Draco could definitely tell that something was on his mind. “Hey, do you think next week you’d be willing to go somewhere with me?”
Their disguises held up, and no one paid them any mind. That is, until a strong gust of wind made Draco’s beret fly right off of his head. Draco cursed and ran after it, promptly bumping into someone who was picking it up. “So sorry, sir,” he started.
Before she could finish that thought, the Sorting Hat was placed on the podium and began its song. It was not nearly as depressing as last years’, which Professor Snape actually cut short due to its message being about uniting against the Dark Lord. At the time, Draco had told himself it was very silly to worry for the safety of a hat, but the look on his favorite teacher’s face had made his stomach turn. Apparently he had nothing to fear, though, for the Hat was alive and well. And—talkative. Draco zoned out for most of its song, and the sorting that followed. He did notice that the few first-years who got Slytherin as their house looked crest-fallen, and Draco felt a pang of sympathy during the minimal applause.
“I’m afraid not. Hale doesn’t want you and Lucius speaking to each other until after the proceedings.”
Draco put some food on his plate—a good amount since his body was still recovering—as Professor McGonagall passed out their class schedules. It did appear that the eighth years were not sharing classes with any of the seventh years, and Draco was secretly relieved. Many of the seventh-years were members of Dumbledore’s Army, like the little Weasley girl, and he was sure that they hated him profusely.
“Lucius.” Narcissa’s voice got terrifyingly stern. “We both were in agreement on how we wanted things to end. We wanted the same thing. I helped make that happen.”
“Alright, Narcissa,” Mr. Burke said gently. “A Ministry official will be here in a few moments to escort you back to the Manor.”
He felt a hand on his shoulder steadying him. “Draco...” Harry didn’t seem to know what to say. He helped Draco sit on a nearby staircase.
“You can’t jump, you know.” A singsong and sickly familiar voice sounded behind him, and Draco whirled around. Luna Lovegood was standing near the hallway, sporting bright purple glasses and a headband that seemed to be made of real bumblebees that were buzzing cheerfully around her head. She looked at him inquisitively as she shuffled her schoolbooks in her hand. “There’s a protective barrier. It sounds the alarm so Professor McGonagall will know.” Draco was silent and gaping as she met his eyes. “I helped develop it, of course. Mental health is so important. I don’t want anyone getting hurt or feeling like they don’t belong. Wrackspurts can drive people to do terrible things. ”
“I literally can’t do magic unless a Professor unlocks this.” He held up his wrist. “You can ask the many people that attack me in the hallways; I can’t fight back.”
Draco sighed. “I don’t know, he’s my father. I mean, if the retrial goes well and he gets out, I’ll have to see him anyway.”
Shivering under the new moon, Draco stepped into the castle and trudged up to his room. Everyone must have been finishing up dinner at this point—it was nearly nine o’clock. The common room was void of anyone who cared about him anymore. His friends were likely eating late, and those who despised him were probably still holed up in the shack. He shifted his trunk and turned the doorknob to his bedroom.
“I assume your parents don’t know?” Draco blanched and looked away. “Well, you need to tell them. If you’re serious about this, they need to know, whatever the consequences are. Unless you want to ignore them for the rest of your life. You can’t live two lives when you’re with him, it wouldn’t be fair.” She had a point. “And, you need to come to my family’s house over the holidays and answer to them. They’re going to be wondering why you’re with Harry. He’s a member of our family, and we stick up for each other. And don’t think I’m going to help you with your explanations.”
The fifth years looked crushed and melted away, disturbed by the encounter. The one who spoke stole a piercingly evil glance back at Draco as she walked away. Harry turned to Draco. “I’m really sorry about that.”
Draco sat up fully and Harry moved back. Draco ran his hands through his hair, sighing shakily. “I’m fine, Potter.”
Kingsley nodded distractedly at Draco, still in conversation with the Gryffindors while the Slytherins looked on politely. Greg gave a side glance at Draco, but seemed to think it would be better to not draw attention to him. Draco hurried with the cloak outside of Kingsley’s office while Harry was still unable to escape the conversation. Draco knew that Harry would not be happy in the slightest about him just running off, but Draco had to see his mother. He actually had to talk to her, and he had to do it alone.
He heard Ron murmur to Harry, “Can I talk to you outside for a second?” Harry nodded and told Draco he would be right back, leaving Draco pacing among the shelves. Thankfully the elderly shopkeeper was occupied with counting inventory and didn’t notice the former Death Eater’s skulking.
“Merlin, so many things.” Draco sighed. “But particularly for making such a scene. I should have warned you that if she were there she may react like that.” Draco didn’t even feel like he deserved to say Madame Rosmerta’s name.
Draco later found that he had no recollection of how he got out of Azkaban—he was that much in shock over his father’s behavior. Certainly Lucius had been rough on him before, but not like that. He sounded close to disowning Draco, or attacking him. Draco used to admire his father greatly, and though that pride in his family had decreased heavily over the past two years, he had never seen his father so...pathetic, in the most literal sense of the word. Lucius Malfoy was a shell of his former self, and Draco wasn’t sure that his father would ever regain his old personality. Draco knew that Lucius was heavily affected by the Dementors, yet over the next few days the thought lingered in his mind: how much of what Lucius said did he truly believe?
Draco’s mind was a pendulum, whooshing back and forth between a universe of an insane Lucius and a universe of a lucid one, and he paced along with his racing thoughts. After about an hour of back-and-forth across the room, he heard a knock at the door. Opening it, he found the three other Slytherins all with their arms crossed, glaring at him.
“The less you know, boy, the better. However, it is very likely that you will end up becoming the official head of the Malfoy household before long. Either your father is going to get an extended imprisonment in Azkaban or will get most of his titles and privileges revoked. You should meet with a financial advisor at Gringotts to start transferring everything to be in your name. The most important thing you can do now is protect yourself and your family as best as you can.”
He wasn’t sure what to do. Should he be angry with Mr. Burke, or angry with himself? Or angry at his father for causing all of this in the first place? He started to aimlessly walk around, feeling enraged and horrifyingly helpless. More than anything he wanted to not have one of his attacks, but he felt it coming from deep inside his stomach. Would he even be allowed inside the Ministry tomorrow? How would his mother feel not seeing him sitting in the stands?
“I’m not you, you prat.” That hurt a little, that she wasn’t going to take revenge simply because it seemed like something Draco would do, and she wanted to set them apart. “Now come on, I’m taking you back to the castle.”
“I always wondered if being an orphan made you deficient in some way, and clearly it did since you never had parents around to teach you manners—“
“Awesome. We were all going to go down to Hogsmeade afterward if you’re interested.” The eighth-years now had permission to visit the nearby village during weekends. Draco didn’t respond and kept writing, hoping that Potter would take the hint. “See you later,” Harry said, and left Draco back to his studying.
“My family already got off really easy, under the circumstances. Drawing any attention to ourselves is not a good thing.” Draco was reminded of his father’s warning to not cause any problems. “Don’t worry, Potter, I’ll order in for some healing potions and the like.” Draco couldn’t believe that Potter was this concerned about him.
“I just...” Blaise pulled lightly at his hair. “Draco definitely had it the worst out of us, no question about it.” Draco opened his mouth to respond but Blaise continued. “No, it’s fine to admit it. Your situation was the most helpless. So if you have to apologize for not only what you did, but what you didn’t do? Where does that leave us? We all tortured people. Are we supposed to face them and just—apologize for it? What’s so wrong about not wanting to get tortured yourself?”
Hermione stood up. “Sometimes people are just nice to be nice, Malfoy. There are only so many chances you get before people just stop caring. If you want to continue hiding behind this attitude like a coward, that’s your business. Harry convinced me to give you a chance this year, but you’re just the same rude prick, Death Eater or not.” She slammed the door behind her.
“I understand,” Harry said. “When I was going from the Dursley’s to the Weasley’s last summer, everyone actually disguised themselves as me in order to confuse the Death Eaters. I hated the idea of it though. I hated the thought that anyone might die for me.”
Everyone looked at each other. They hadn’t planned to actually discuss any joint project with the Minister, it was simply just their way of getting in. No one spoke, until Hermione finally sat up, a calm look on her face. “Yes, we just wanted to talk to you about our success at collaboration...”
Harry seemed sure about this and Draco didn’t want to discourage him so soon after he had agreed to let Draco take him on a date, so Draco slept alone. But he was not happy about it—with his parents’ trial in a matter of days, he was feeling more anxious than ever. He hoped after Saturday, Harry would agree to share his bed in the nights leading up to his next appearance before the Wizengamot.
Narcissa stared violently into his eyes, leaning forward and only stopping because of the chains. “Over Draco’s Easter break, Draco had his tongue cut out for a week.” Tears were now freely falling down Narcissa’s face, and she looked as though she somewhat regretting this admission. Draco had begged Mr. Burke not to discuss that event in his original trial, and Mr. Burke said he only would as a last resort. That time never came, yet here his mother was, discussing his worst and most humiliating nightmare with everyone. Even the worst of the Wizengamot members looked uncomfortable. “The Malfoy family, as said in our last trial, does not wish for the Dark Lord to return,” Narcissa finished coldly.
A short, bald man looked impatiently as Draco dragged his trunk off the train, then switched to lifting it with both hands. The man led him through the wall out of the Platform and to the parking lot. Draco didn’t have much familiarity with cars, and the man had to gesture for him to put his luggage in the trunk. Whenever Draco’s parents did take Muggle transport, they always had someone to do tasks like that for them. Draco took a seat in the back, and without a single other word, the man drove him to his home. Draco was lost in memories, remembering the fateful day that he dreamed about, and was home before he knew it. Draco was surprised when the driver put the car in park in front of the gates of the Manor, which were creaking open slowly.
“Woah—you alright? Easy...” Draco protested as Harry grabbed his arm and lowered him back into the seat—but he couldn’t breathe, couldn’t think, he thought he was going to pass out. He put his hand on his chest as he hyperventilated. He was terrified and humiliated that this was happening in front of Harry Potter, of all people. The last time Harry had seen him like this did not end well.
Before the fire was able to swallow him whole, he awoke gasping, his legs tangled in the sheets that were moist with his sweat. He broke free of the bonds and sat on the edge of the bed, willing himself not to throw up. The clock told him it was barely daybreak, but thankfully, early enough to justify getting up. Merlin knows Draco had mounds of homework to do anyway to pass the time.
“Actually, I’m really sorry, I’m being rude. Did you...did you want to talk about what happened, at all?”
Harry patted Draco on the back and stood up. Draco was surprised by how much he felt the absence of Harry’s hand on his back. “Well, might as well do some homework now that I’m up. Care to join me?”
“No, absolutely not,” Harry didn’t match his tone. “Even Dean was horrified, I think. He was apologizing to you, saying he just meant it as a stupid prank, but you didn’t hear him. Everyone was concerned.”
“Mate, you know all these comments are rubbish, right?” Greg was holding up a particularly nasty letter that contained all the reasons why Draco would never be good enough for someone like Harry Potter.
Finally, Yarney came back. “You can go,” he said, and held the door open for Draco. Draco stood up tentatively—it was really that easy? He thought he’d better not question anything lest Yarney change his mind. Yarney led Draco back to his office where Draco floo’ed back to Hogwarts.
Draco waited a few moments to speak, knowing that he would regret his decision to be vulnerable, especially after causing this much of a scene. But it was nearing midnight and somehow he felt safe in the open, under the stars, and with Potter. “I was so angry with you. For not being my friend in first year. No one had ever done that before, and I kept wondering what Weasley of all people had that I didn’t.”
Mr. Burke looked annoyed. “It’s difficult to have witnesses for a crime that wasn’t committed.” Draco had to admit that was a good line.
“You’re not,” Harry reassured him. “Good relationships don’t solve mental illness. Also I know you’re really stressed about our presentation tomorrow, and about seeing your parents next week. It’s understandable you’re having a rough go. But I’m here with you all the way, and I know you’ll do great in Defense Against the Dark Arts.”
Draco looked before him and almost felt sorry for the ragtag bunch. Clearly Harry did not know about this—he couldn’t have. If he did, they would be better suited for an actual interrogation. Draco was still not bound to the chair. Some of the younger teens with the group were trembling. Only Weaslette invoked any real fear in him. He knew that she tortured him only a few days ago, and she would probably do it again if she got the chance. “So ask your questions,” he said stiffly.
Mrs. Weasley turned around sharply. She met Fleur’s eyes, and then hers trended downward to Fleur’s concealed middle. Fleur beamed. “It appears you will be...”
Draco stared at her blankly. Didn’t he just say what he needed help with? “Um...with what I just told you?”
“Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy,” Madam Hale’s voice boomed from behind the podium where she sat. “You are charged with obstruction of justice, tampering with the investigation of known Death Eaters such as Dolohov, Nott, the Carrows, and others. How do you plead?”
Draco scrunched up his nose. “No. Too weird of a crossover, between you and my mother.” Draco was picturing the look on his mother’s face if she heard Harry call him by his childhood nickname. It wasn’t a pleasant sight, but then again, neither was the look on his mother’s face if she heard Harry call him anything affectionate at all.
His mind was reeling and his heart raced, making his chest ache and the castle lilt to one side. He leaned against the wall and desperately tried to breathe, but his lungs were closing.
“Just because a lot of people have seen bad things doesn’t mean that the things you have seen haven’t affected you in a unique way,” Christine said.
He felt like he was still arguing with himself when later he entered the Great Hall. He had spent the past hour staring at himself in the bathroom mirror with Moaning Myrtle chatting in the background. Opening up to her was easy because he knew that whatever she said, people weren’t like to believe her. However, Draco still took care to leave specific names out of the situation. Myrtle wouldn’t suspect the boy he was talking about was Harry Potter, considering she witnessed what she thought was the two of them trying to kill each other two years prior.
Draco stared at his name in Theo’s handwriting and sighed. His friends made good points. But he and Theo had always been friendly—what if he was in trouble? Also, Draco knew that Theo was aware Draco was up to something sixth year, and Theo never said anything. Didn’t Draco owe the same to him? Maybe he was in a hard spot with his parents just like Draco had been.
? It was unnerving to Draco. He stood awkwardly for a second, not quite sure how to make his exit but knowing that he definitely could not stay.
“Fine,” Draco said through gritted teeth. He picked up his wand and put it back in his robe pocket. “You startled the living daylights out of me.”
“How did that work out for you?” The wizard who was a constant interruption jeered. Others made outbursts about the selfishness of the Malfoy family.
“Carefully? With an acknowledgement of exactly what you’ve done?” Draco didn’t realize there was a manual on how to apologize.
“Anyway, then we went to Hogsmeade and it did not go well. I was supposed to meet up with Hermione later, and I told her that, and she accused me of—“
“Seriously, man, at least just try to enjoy yourself this weekend. Get some sun, eat some junk food and fill up a bit.” Draco scoffed. “And if Potter doesn’t seem interested? Don’t worry about it. If he’s not an idiot, which is certainly questionable, he will be eventually.”
He walked over to the empty bar. “Two shots of Firewhiskey, please. And keep them coming.” Draco slapped a few coins on the bar and the keep got to work. Draco ran his hands through his hair.
“Just give yourself whatever time you need. No pressure this year, all you gotta do is pass through.”
“Yes, they’d have to be preserved in extremely monitored circumstances. The Time Turner, for example, was in a specific room in my house. Under glass cases and a lot of spells.” They were silent for a moment, contemplating how something like that could fall into the wrong hands. The more Draco thought about it, the more he was worried that his father had more to do with it than it seemed. How else could all the spells have been broken? How could someone have entered the Manor unnoticed by both of his parents?
“No it’s not!” Harry was adamant. “The prophecy mentioned me. If I didn’t exist, or if people hadn’t worked so hard to keep me alive, so many would still be here. I’ve worked long and hard these past few months to realize that even though I may have set some events in motion, even though I was a catalyst, they aren’t my fault.”
As if reading his mind, Harry stood up and offered him a hand. “Well, I am. And I’ve had quite enough of other people for one day—how about we go to the kitchens?”
“No worries.” The last thing Draco wanted to do was make Daphne feel bad for something that wasn’t her fault.
Draco smiled flirtatiously. “Don’t expect to put me to work without paying for it.” Harry blushed. “I mean by getting to look at the artifacts, Potter, don’t be crass,” Draco joked.
“Harry—I—I’m so sorry. You should have just let me go, why didn’t you just let me go? You could’ve—“ he then saw Neville and Hermione right behind Potter. He was nearly in tears “You all could’ve—“
He couldn’t believe that was only one day of school. It felt like the entire summer combined. All in all though, it could have been much worse. He’d take glares and snide remarks any day over even the best of times last year.
“Oh you know how she is,” Narcissa waved her hand dismissively. “She’s probably in Italy with her fourteenth husband. How she’s managed to get away with...all that, I don’t know.” Blaise’s mother was notorious for murdering her husbands after barely a year. Blaise’s father had been dead for some time, with his mother inheriting the fortune and the name. “Enough about me though, darling. How about you? Are you friends with the other Slytherins?”
“Woah, mate, what did those books ever do to you?” Blaise walked in the room with Greg and Daphne following close behind.
After showering with the coldest possible water, Draco walked into the common room shivering. Plopping his school bag down on the nearest couch, he jumped at the unexpected sight of Greg sitting by the fire.
He and his friends gathered their things and exited the classroom. “I think I’m going to have a lie-down,” Draco said.
Narcissa hesitated this time. “My husband and I were approached by Nott in mid-September.” Draco let out a small gasp, but Harry squeezed his leg somewhat painfully as a reminder that they were not to be seen or heard. Thankfully other murmurs drowned out the sound.
The two men stopped at the entrance to the prison. “Put this on,” Yarney handed Draco a blindfold. When Draco hesitated, he added “You can’t know the layout of the prison, and it’s easier than Obliviating you at the end. I’ll help you walk to the visiting room.”
“Oh, posh,” Mrs. Weasley said, turning a bit red in the face. “Harry has told me how much you mean to him. And Harry means a lot to us.” She straightened Harry’s hair and beamed at him. “Now get to bed, tomorrow will be very busy, preparing everything for the feasts to come.”
“But what if it’s partially my fault he’s in this boat? What if it’s because of my parents, or because I escaped getting kidnapped months ago, or just because I didn’t flee with the rest of the Death Eaters at the end of the war?”
Harry sat next to him after Draco slowly sank into the giant couch. He pulled out something from his pocket. It was a large piece of paper that looked like it could fold dozens of times. Harry also took out his wand, and tapped the paper three times. “I solemnly swear I am up to no good.”
Oof. Do you think Lucius knows about Harry and Draco, or do you think Lucius is just messing with him? We’ll only have one more chapter back at the Manor, and then we’ll go to Hogwarts. Do you think Draco will get around to telling his parents that he’s in a relationship before the Parkinson’s return?
“Try being on the run with barely anything to eat for a year, never knowing if your family is safe. Try losing a
The rest of the week was a surprisingly a good one for Draco. He spent the majority of his time getting caught up on schoolwork and corresponding with his mother over letters. His father’s trial was supposed to begin to take place the same afternoon that his mother was released, but an hour in and the Wizengamot found that Lucius Malfoy was in no state to answer questions. He was sent to St. Mungo’s for rehabilitation, with his trial postponed until a later date. Draco’s mother implored him to visit Malfoy Manor the following weekend, and then they would both be allowed to visit Lucius in the hospital under Ministry supervision. Draco didn’t feel like he could say no to that request.
“It just...didn’t feel right. I don’t know what it is. I don’t know if it’s my PTSD—“ Draco recalled the Muggle illness that Granger had mentioned. “—or if I’m just tired of conflict or if I just don’t even like her, but every time we would hang out I wish we were just friends.”
Draco thought he had been standing this whole time. Why else would his legs hurt so much? Being pulled to his feet, though, was a new level of pain. He cried out and grabbed for something—his vision faded and he could barely see.
Harry took a pause before entering the village, as though preparing himself for the emotions that would lie ahead. Draco followed him into a cemetery after Harry removed the Invisibility Cloak. They came to a stop at James and Lily Potter’s headstones. Harry stood there in silence for a few moments, and Draco was unsure of what he should do.
“I won’t go on, but the next year was the worst of my life. There is no way I would want to bring the Dark Lord back through that Time Turner. I would rather have a universe ruled only by Muggleborns than by him. I promise. I don’t know who sent me the Time Turner or why, but I want nothing more than to have it destroyed.” He finally looked up. Some people were glaring about him, surely feeling like he was making himself a victim, which was not his intent. But others looked relieved that he seemed to have no nefarious plot. The older students held his gaze evenly, not betraying anything with their eyes.
That unleashed something inside Draco. Enraged, he stood up and went to leave the compartment. He felt like he needed air, or to vomit, or to yell at those first years more. He wasn’t sure what he wanted, but he couldn’t stay here.
Draco hesitated for a few moments. He felt guilty about just how nervous he was. He was going home, he was going to get to see his mother—these were all good things. Only in the past two years did he start to want to stay at Hogwarts rather than be in the comfort of his own home. “I don’t want to lie to you,” he said. “I am. Particularly to see my father.”
Draco was about to snap at Potter for asking that but figured it was not an absurd question. Potter had saved his life yesterday, after all. Draco was both grateful and angry, but too tired to start a fight. After Harry left him alone yesterday afternoon, Draco finished his hot chocolate and went back to sleep. Blaise, Daphne, and Gregory came bursting into his room a few hours later.
Draco wanted to hold his hand, wanted to brush his hair away from his forehead that was red from Harry rubbing it so much. “They would have done whatever was necessary to win the war, I think. Not that they didn’t care about you, of course they did, but I don’t think anyone who died did so for you, if that makes sense.”
Mr. Malfoy?” The same voice in his mini-dream startled him awake from a half sleep. “Are you alright?”
“Dragon! You’re here!” She shuffled him into the household before he could get a good look at her, and began to babble a little uncharacteristically. “They didn’t tell me when you’d be arriving and I can’t do magic now, so the house is a mess. I send Tilly to do things, but you know, I can’t actually order her to do them so it’s been a little difficult. But here—sit down.”
Harry shrugged. “I guess that’s what they’re trying to find out. They must have something to do with it though, if Dolohov tried to kidnap you to get to them.”
“Yes, I am aware of your predicament. What would you like me to do to help you with it?” She said this not unkindly. When Draco was silent still, she continued. “Would you like me to inform the Minister of this situation? Would you like me to talk to Ms. Weasley myself? What action should I take?”
“That sounds amazing,” Potter said, but then frowned. “I’m not sure it’ll be enough, though. Maybe the last part about your father.”
Draco’s friends were concerned later when Draco told them about the confrontation. “What did we tell you about walking to and from classes alone? It’s not safe,” Daphne had protested.
Draco sat up too, frustrated. “No. No, love, you shouldn’t. I deserved that. Hell, I was going to try and torture you. I nearly killed your best friend and one of your Quidditch players. I berated both of your best friends for years. What would really kill me is knowing that you felt guilty about it. It helped even the score.”
Draco climbed into bed and sat down propped up, pulling the covers over him and focusing on the moonlight. Tonight would be the hardest night since Draco had nothing to do to keep his mind occupied. In fact, as the seconds ticked by, Draco became more and more anxious. He had to both stay awake and somehow not think about anything that could trigger another whatever-that-was like he had on the train.
“You should sit for a bit, take it easy, have something to eat. We need to go to the Hospital Wing once you can, I think something is still wrong with your fingertips and toes.” Draco glanced at his hands—his fingertips were a ghoulish shade of black, and he realized his hands were moving jerkily. He tentatively tried to touch his nose with his pointer finger, and nearly poked himself in the eye.
Two more chapters left!!! How is it going to end? Was dinner with the Malfoys what you expected? How do you think the Weasleys will receive Draco? Let me know your thoughts. I hope you all are safe and well.
“Great. Goodnight.” Normally the two boys would chat a bit more, but Draco wanted some space to calm his racing heart. For the first time in a while, he went to sleep with something to look forward to.
“Draco? Can I come in?” An impossibly gentle voice came from the other side of the stall door. Draco recognized it as Harry’s, and he was both horribly embarrassed and incredibly grateful that Harry had somehow found him.
It was all Draco could do to not tap the man on the shoulder and ask him where his mother was now. Draco didn’t give a second thought to his father’s impending trial that afternoon—all he wanted was to be in his mother’s arms. He had been so wrong about so many things, but this he could make right. And he could likely get back to Kingsley’s office without too much questioning as to where he had been. He just needed to find the right room—
“Well...thanks.” Harry looked awkward, even after seeing Draco in nearly a dozen embarrassingly vulnerable situations in the past few years.
“No,” she said, pushing a tin of cookies toward him. “I did notice, however, that you have not signed up for a session with a Mind Healer.”
“I was wondering where you had gotten off to, the rest were waiting for me in the lobby...” Kinglsey looked at Draco with a fake smile plastered on his face. “Please, have a seat.” Kingsley gestured to the empty chair beside Hermione that none of the Slytherins had taken. “Mr. Malfoy,” Kingsley nodded toward Draco, the first acknowledgement of him. Draco took his place behind Harry.
“What did you say?” It seemed that now Lucius wanted to be a parent. However, where four years ago he would have made Draco apologize for his insolence, at least now he was sheepish enough to let it slide. “Come sit with your Mother and I so we can have breakfast as a family before you have to leave.”
After a few minutes of Harry gently shaking Draco, he whispered to Draco that he was going to get Madame Pomfrey so that she could get a stretcher. Draco heard him stand up, and then hesitate. He sensed Harry bend down, and then received an extremely gentle kiss on his forehead. He was sure that his whole body was smiling, but apparently he remained unresponsive. Harry sighed and went to retrieve Madame Pomfrey—but Draco had never felt better.
“I don’t even know if I’m allowed back in my own home. Besides, he may have some bad memories of the place.” Draco didn’t know how much his friends knew of Harry’s capture in his home the past Easter. When Draco returned to school, though, there were rumors everywhere that Harry had been caught but managed to escape the Dark Lord’s clutches again. Of course, his friends had asked about the legitimacy of these rumors, but Draco physically could not tell them due to his punishment.
“He didn’t call her anything. You have something you want to say?” Goyle threw down his napkin and stood up.
Perhaps the most significant change, though, was that he was actually dating Harry Potter. It had been just about a week since their relationship became official, and Draco still felt like he was in a dream. He knew that he liked Harry from the beginning of third year, when he was attacked by the hippogriff. That injury certainly did hurt, but he did exaggerate the initial pain to see if Harry would pay attention. He laughed to himself as he paced the floors.
Draco’s body wasn’t giving him a choice except to follow Potter’s orders. His eyes slowly closed shut—
Draco thought about demanding that the man take him up the nearly half-kilometer driveway, but decided against it. He began to take his time carrying his trunk up the long pathway. He took in the smells of the flowers, noticing that they had bloomed slightly since he had been here in the dry summer. Fallen leaves crunched beneath his feet, and he made a mental note to ask Tilly to clean it up, if the house elf even stayed throughout the Malfoy’s absence.
“I don’t know, I just don’t want to mess anything up with the trial coming up. I also want this date to go perfectly.”
Draco already had most of his work done from his week in isolation. He also knew he wouldn’t be able to focus on anything right now. “I’m alright. I’m going to try and get some rest. Here’s your blanket back.”
“I guess,” Draco said, not quite convinced. But he smiled for Harry anyway. “Thank you, love. It really has been nice here. But I think I’ll try and go back to the manor for Christmas. Patch things up.”
” with confidence. But his brain couldn’t trick his magical core into thinking he was ready. Nothing came out but a mere wisp—possibly enough to distract a Dementor long enough to run away, but certainly not sufficient for a Hogwarts graduate. He clenched at his hair, near tears from frustration. Crying out, Draco started throwing his textbooks on the floor, stomping on them for good measure.
Draco and Harry sat on the bench for a few more moments and exchanged some pleasantries. Draco finished his glass of water. “Would you feel up to walking around a bit?” Harry asked.
“Oh Merlin. Draco, it’s okay. Hermione is here, she’s better at healing spells than I am. She’s going to heal you and then we’re going to walk to the Hospital Wing, alright?”
Harry smiled, but sighed again. “If we’re going to do this, I don’t think we have enough room for two reckless blokes in this relationship.”
“I’ll have a Healer come and make sure that your head is alright.” The man looked to be in his thirties yet wore an aged expression. Draco didn’t recognize him from any of his trials, but he hadn’t been paying that close attention to the prosecutors anyway. The man’s office was small, but warm and quiet. Red carpet softened the floor under Draco’s feet, and the chair had a nice, plump cushion. Draco’s heart was still beating fast from the attack—and he had so many questions. However, he had learned to keep silent in these sort of situations.
He stormed up to Professor McGonagall’s office, feeling extremely irritated at the lack of progress he made today in comparison to the amount of success Potter had at Occlumency.
“I’m not supposed to master anything today, we still have a whole month before we have to present! Your turn. Sit down,” he said firmly.
Harry sat up and turned on the lamp, to Draco’s dismay. He winced at the light, which worsened his headache, and grabbed Harry’s arm as he put on his glasses and glanced at the thin figure next to him. “I know for a fact Madame Pomfrey didn’t discharge you at—“ he glanced at the clock. “—three in the morning.”
Wordlessly, Dolohov put Harry in a Full Body Bind curse. Harry, mouth open, fell to the ground like a stiff board, unable to move or speak. Dolohov took a few steps toward Draco. Draco knew he was doomed.
“Potter, for once this has nothing to do with you. I know it’s hard to imagine the world not revolving around the great Savior, but do yourself a favor and relax.” To Draco’s great disappointment, Harry left him alone after that.
The rest of the day passed smoothly. The Weasley’s mostly ignored Draco, which was fine with him. They even had a fun Quidditch match in the crisp winter air with spare brooms. Draco struggled a bit—he wasn’t used to the older brooms, and he got smacked with a Bludger by George, who did not look too sorry. But overall it was very fun, and Draco was able to take his mind off his family woes.
“I thought this was banned,” Draco said. There were magic journals where someone could write something and it would appear somewhere else, but everything that had been written would disappear after a while. It made it difficult to collect evidence in court cases, so that type of magic had been banned a few decades ago.
Draco wasn’t hungry but knew he couldn’t miss the first family dinner since he had been home. He pulled out Narcissa’s chair for her while Lucius sat down unsteadily. Draco took a better look at his father. He certainly seemed much improved since his hospital stay, but kept the same manic look in his eyes that Draco hated when he first got out of Azkaban one and a half years ago. Lucius made no move to cut his steak, but made searing eye contact with Draco. Draco swallowed and glanced at his plate.
“What? Are you kidding me? With my parents, I don’t plan on furthering the Malfoy line at all. I wouldn’t want to inflict that on someone.”
She stood to face him. “Not to mention my family. You insulted us every single day, saying that we were poor, but we were richer in love than your family ever will be. Even after you’ve nearly killed my brothers and after one actually died—we try and love stronger. But make no mistake—we are not happier. You have taken the light out of my family’s eyes. I used to enjoy going home and now part of me dreads it because I have to see my mother cry. Not all of it was because of you, Malfoy. But all of it was because of what you believed for years.” Only a single tear spread down her cheek, and she immediately wiped it away angrily.
The guard glanced at the check-in witch, both of whom looked uncomfortable. “No,” the witch said. “We just thought it would behoove you, Mr. Potter, if we took proper precautions for your safety—“
To Draco’s embarrassment, Harry’s eyes were shining, and not from the cold. Draco didn’t want to see his boyfriend cry, even though it wouldn’t be for the first time. Crying from happiness at this small gesture was almost too much to bear. Draco continued making snowballs even faster than before. “It’s not a big deal, I—“
Draco’s heart fell and he couldn’t help but let out a small sigh, just for himself. Nothing should surprise him anymore, but this still did. Of course Gregory wouldn’t want to talk to him. His actions led to the death of Vincent, who was Gregory’s best mate. Draco certainly spent the most time around the two of them, and they were his mates, but Draco was really only around them when he needed something. Vincent and Greg were inseparable. The friendship may not have been irreparable, but Draco didn’t write Greg at all this summer, save the letter that was supposed to be sent to Greg and others after Draco’s death in prison. But Draco never sent those letters, never even wrote new ones. He didn’t think about anyone but himself as he paced around his room for months. And now he was truly alone, able to spend more time with himself than he could ever want.
Before gathering his things and reluctantly following, Draco motioned for Greg to hang back for a second. Blaise looked like he wanted to protest but Daphne took his arm and steered him toward the Great Hall. Soon it was just Greg and Draco in the classroom.
Draco took the pile of fabric from her outstretched arms. All the blankets she handed him were hand knitted and in various states of condition. “Thank you. I really appreciate it.” Draco meant it.
It seemed as though the world stopped. Tilly, the house elf, had come to refill their drink glasses but nearly dropped the pitcher. She couldn’t escape quickly enough. Lucius looked nearly triumphant, while Narcissa’s expression was unreadable.
Draco couldn’t decide how he felt about that. For one, it would give him an excuse not to be around his friends. But it would also spark concern in them, and they potentially wouldn’t leave him alone. He decided to attempt to go to the kitchen every once and a while to stock up on some essentials inside his room.
“You are not defective. You’re in the best state you’ve ever been in your life. Well, maybe besides your pinky finger.” Draco’s smallest finger, now permanently curled, had not really recovered from his hypothermia, and it likely never would. “Do I look worried?”
. But then he remembered that he was forced into signing up for a Mind Healer appointment. He felt a pit in his stomach. Didn’t anyone understand that reliving everything was not going to help him in the slightest, but could very well destroy him? He just wanted to be in peace. He could recover on his own time, his own way. He didn’t want everyone interfering like this, whatever their intentions.
Everyone either groaned or looked uncomfortable. “So tonight,” Granger seemed to be bracing herself for backlash. “We’re going to share one story about something that happened to us in the past year. And that’s how we’re going to start every meeting until the end of the term.”
For a few moments, Mr. Burke didn’t say anything. He looked...almost uncomfortable, maybe a little angry. “Sir?” Draco asked hesitantly.
“Yup.” Draco got up a lot more successfully this time, with Potter right beside him ready to steady him if needed. The two walked back to their dormitory, not speaking but rather marinating in a pleasant and comfortable silence. The ability to do so was one of Draco’s greatest wishes in a companion—and it certainly wouldn’t be Potter in the end, but this would do for now.
“But he’s not like...making fun of you or anything,” Daphne said thoughtfully. “I remember when he attacked you in the bathroom last year. Pansy told me you were worried he was going to tell the whole school that you were...upset.” She chose her words carefully—Draco did not want to admit that he cried in front of Potter. He hadn’t even wanted to tell Pansy, but she came to the Hospital Wing so often to visit him where he was cornered. Answering her questions at least made her go away faster so he could be alone and in peace. He ended up telling her the whole story, feeling that his childhood friend would keep it between the two of them. He was mildly irritated that this was clearly not the case. “But it didn’t get around school at all. I wonder what he’s after, then.”
. There was also the tea shop but that was much too...obvious. “Sure, sounds great,” Draco said nervously.
Harry sighed behind him and did the same, grabbing some nightclothes and leaving the room toward the restroom they shared with Neville and Gregory. After hearing the door close, Draco sat down on his bed and put his head in his hands. He grabbed strands of his hair and started pulling slightly at them, just enough to feel the ache in his scalp. He felt as though there were a second Battle of Hogwarts taking place inside of him.
“Back to Defense Against the Dark Arts I see,” Blaise said next to him. The previous year it had just been called “Dark Arts.” “Let’s see if Arden can make it past a year.”
Potter started to divide the players up into teams based on who had any experience playing a certain position. He and Draco were the only Seekers, so they were on opposite teams. Granger, Longbottom, Thomas, and a handful of others were sitting out, as they weren’t comfortable on a broom. Draco ended up on a team with Greg with Blaise and Daphne on Potter’s team. Greg was one Beater for Draco’s team, but Seamus was the other. Biting his lip, Draco worried that Seamus wouldn’t be too concerned about beating a Bludger away from him.
“Yeah, I’m sorry, I didn’t have time to catch you guys before dinner.” Draco used to order Vincent and Greg around all the time without giving them much prior notice of what was happening. But things were different this year, and he knew that it would have been more ideal to tell his friends. “Is that alright?”  he finished, looking toward Greg.
Draco put his feet on the ground, but even the solid Earth wasn’t enough to steady himself. His vision from earlier, the one that nearly produced a Patronus, came back to him now. He leaned over and touched Harry’s cheek gently. With the other hand, he brushed back Harry’s bangs, revealing his scar. It wasn’t even that big and had an almost faded quality.
“I mentioned to Ron that we hadn’t eaten lunch yet,” Harry said truthfully, though Draco was grateful that he left some details out of the explanation. “So he wanted to go to the Three Broomsticks with us, if that’s alright with you. Everything’s good on our end,” Harry finished pointedly.
Harry looked mildly offended, and Draco was filled with immediate and burning regret. He didn’t want to ruin the one good part about this day. “If you say so. Let me know if you change your mind.”
“I’m not going to tell you. You can speculate all you’d like but I won’t confirm or deny anyone. And besides, I don’t even know if I fancy them or not. Or what he thinks about me.”
“Well, yeah. Every pureblood family has insanely valuable artifacts. I’m sure the Blacks have tons of fascinating ones.”
“Yes, threatening to kill the savior of the wizarding world is a great way to help their relationship,” Daphne chided.
His thoughts were fragments that pierced him in the best and worst possible ways. He didn’t know it was possible to love and fear this strongly. “Okay.”
“Huh. I wouldn’t have thought him the tidy type. I guess that’s one area where you two will get along,” Blaise smirked.
He hoped the conversation would end there. “Of course, Draco! I’m so glad you’re deciding to be a better person. I always knew you had some good in you—everyone does, after all. You should take better care of yourself though, you look peaky—“
He didn’t turn around to watch Ginny’s face. The Ravenclaw finally stepped forward, allowing him to exit the shack, and he knew that he had a deal. He had a week to fix this.
Dean Thomas released a Stinging Hex on Draco’s cheek that felt just like a good slap. “This is an interrogation, Malfoy. You’ll only talk when it’s to answer our questions.”
“Listen carefully to me, Potter,” Dolohov said with a sneer. Draco’s hand was shaking as he held out his useless wand. “I have others inside waiting for my signal. If you don’t do anything rash, your friends will live, and so will you.”
Draco sighed. The Ravenclaw in front of him flexed his wand arm in warning. “Give me a week,” he said dully. “To get things in order.”
“Yeah mate, we heard you got attacked. They have to let you use magic now, right?” Blaise glanced at the manacle on Draco’s wrist.
Draco thought about the last two years of Snape’s life. Starting in Draco’s sixth year he had become almost hostile to his former mentor. He avoided Snape’s concerned gaze whenever he could. When Snape became Headmaster, Draco ignored all the notes summoning him to Snape’s office. Now that Snape was dead, Draco couldn’t think of anyone he wanted to see more. He wanted to ask Snape so many questions, wanted to tell him about all the horrendous things that he had done and seen over the past year. Sometimes Draco felt like he was choking on the regret of how he treated the professor in his final months.
“Constant reminder that there’s no way a bloke like you would even be friends with me, let alone date me.” Draco hiccuped.
Draco whipped his head around to look at Harry. Harry raised an eyebrow at Draco, as though puzzled by his confusion. “Um...yeah,” Draco nodded and gave a small smile. “Yeah it is.”
“I just hope we can still be friends. People always say that but it rarely actually happens. And I do genuinely
“Draco—I had no idea. I—“ Harry sighed. “That’s awful. I’m sorry I made you tell me if you weren’t ready. I hate it when people do that to me, and I shouldn’t have done it to you. I can leave you alone if you want.”
He stopped by a window—it was snowing, the first really fluffy snow of the season. It brought a smile to his face, and he tried to let thoughts about Theo blow away with the cold wind.
“Harry, I know you weren’t about to say that you don’t have a family. You have Teddy, I know you stay at the Weasleys’ a ton. And if you don’t like them, I’m sure any Wizarding family would fall over their feet for you to choose them.” That got a laugh out of Harry. “I know it’s not the same as not having your parents alive. But you still care about them, and I’d know you’d do anything for them. Hell, you’re pretty close to being willing to do anything for random people on the street. That’s how I feel about my mother.”
The notebook was already glowing when he sat down at his desk, and he opened it to find a good-luck message from Harry about the visit with his father.
“But you two are dating.” It was a statement, not a question. But there was no malice behind it. Draco didn’t think the reason for Ginny doing this was jealousy.
Draco was lost in thought for a little while when Potter suddenly burst in the room, shutting the door clearly behind him. He started to fling out some pajamas. Draco looked at the clock—it was only eleven. “What’s got your panties in a bunch, Potter?”
Potter leaned back in his chair. “Boy do I have good news for you. They absolutely can. I saw Professor Snape produce one.” Draco fixed his attention on Potter at the mention of his departed mentor’s name. “Then it’s settled, I’ll teach you how to produce a Patronus charm. What about you, what are you good at?”
Daphne grabbed Blaise’s arm and steered him into the nearest empty classroom. Draco and Greg followed. She shoved Blaise into a seat and slammed the door. “Alright,” she said much more gently than she treated the classroom furniture. “What’s the matter?”
But the lies Draco was telling himself weren’t working. He started to shake all over. “Look, it doesn’t matter. I just—I’m sorry, okay? I’m sorry to everyone. I know I was a prick to Muggleborns, I know I let the Death Eaters into the castle, I know I tortured people, and I know that nothing I say will ever make up for it, but I’m sorry anyway.” He looked at everyone’s stony faces.
“There isn’t. But it doesn’t mean that there can’t be happiness.” Harry looked at Draco and smiled. Draco felt like the whole of the war-torn village of Godric’s Hollow lit up in tandem with the expression on Harry’s face.
Draco took Harry’s hand. “Now that, I understand completely. But we’re going to get through this together. Hopefully now that my mother is out of Azkaban, things will calm down a little. Maybe I won’t even have to wear a disguise to go out on dates.”
“Father, please. I care about you and Mother—I promise I’m going to get you out of here. Both of you. Then you’ll feel better. I’m going to make you proud, I swear to you. Everything is going to be okay.”
Draco’s heart raced—this he didn’t expect. “What, all the blokes will share a dorm? There’s got to be at least ten of us.”
Draco startled—he didn’t know that Harry was awake. “Just...” he was debating how much he should tell Harry. He always thought he was probably so bothersome to Harry, having anxiety attacks all over the place, getting poisoned, having nightmares. Of course Harry ended up needing him too, but not as often, and not as intensely. Draco didn’t want to become dependent on Harry, didn’t want to become a burden. But, it was nighttime, and they always allowed the darkness to push them into more honesty. “I don’t know whether or not I should visit my father in Azkaban.”
“That’s wonderful, dragon,” Narcissa said, eating daintily. “If you would like to invite them over sometime this break, you are welcome to do so.”
Harry let go of Draco’s hand which was now beginning to shake. “Back off, Smith. You need to stop sticking your nose where it doesn’t belong, or you might lose it.” Harry reached into his pocket to take out his wand.
She nodded and cupped Draco’s cheek in her hand. “I’m so—“ her voice suddenly broke off when she heard footsteps. “We’ll talk later, dragon, I promise. Quickly!”
“Ron! It’s great to see you!” Harry walked over to give him a hug. Ron returned it, but kept his gaze on Draco.
Draco scratched out the letter. There weren’t enough words that could be used to describe Harry, and his certainly weren’t sufficient. Draco had the tip of his quill to his mouth when he was startled by a kettle being taken out of a cupboard.
“No one you know,” Draco said quickly. Then he thought—who would he know that Greg wouldn’t? Their families were very close and they went to school together for their whole lives. “Um...someone in France. We’ve been writing letters.”
“Oh! Really? That’s...fantastic! I didn’t know that, er...I didn’t know that was...” Potter searched for the right word. “I mean, do your parents know?”
“We refused, obviously. We took the day to think about it, and when Nott returned the next day, we informed him of our decision.”
“We will start out with these smaller pairs so that you can find out what works as a lesson plan and what does not. Today, discuss spells or other types of magic that each of you are good at. You must pick different skills and get my approval. Then you are free to go and begin your research together. This room will be open for practicing during your regularly scheduled class period. You must turn in progress reports to me every week. We will start our first demonstrations at the end of October. Any questions?” People were already murmuring excitedly to each other. “Feel free to come talk to me if anything comes up. And, begin!”
Draco quietly crept in the room, watching Harry sleep for a moment. He looked a little troubled without Draco by his side, but still beautiful. Draco saw flashes of what their lives could be if they were together. Sure, there would be enormous consequences. The
Christine looked thrilled and leaned forward excitedly, probably thinking this would be some sort of breakthrough. “Of course! What is it?”
“Yeah right. We know that you’re going to figure out how to get close to Potter now, go back and time and do the same thing, and then prevent You-Know-Who’s death.”
“This past Saturday, Harry Potter was spotted at Hogsmeade village. This is not unusual, as the so-called “eighth year” Hogwarts students are able to visit Hogsmeade each weekend, and Potter is often spotted there with his friends. However, this time he was accompanied by none other than Draco Malfoy, a confirmed Death Eater who narrowly escaped imprisonment in no small part due to Potter’s testimonies in his favor in court.
Smith raised his hands in a placating gesture. “Woah, no need to lose your cool, Mr. Potter,” he said mockingly. “Wouldn’t want you to lose your high honor status at the Ministry in some school brawl. I was just commenting on how...surprised I am, that’s all.” Harry’s hand hesitated in his pocket. Apparently he didn’t expect Smith to back down. “So, is this like...a secret?”
“I say we wait a few minutes so he’s far enough away, then we leave too. We don’t need to be here,” Blaise said, angrily taking a bite of his turkey leg.
“Draco, if I show up without you, they really will declare that you’re missing or worse and have the whole place on lockdown within seconds. If we can get to Kingsley and make some excuse, we can come back down here and see the second half.”
Thank you so much for your lovely comments! They help me continue writing. Let me know if you want to see anything in particular!
“I’ve tried to learn Occlumency before. I’m telling you, it’s not going to work.” They were sitting in the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, nestling in a corner with silencing spells blocking out the noise from the other working pairs. It was finally time to start teaching each other the skills they chose to specialize in, and Draco had begged Potter to go first. He wasn’t looking forward to facing the humiliation of not being able to cast a Patronus.
Realizing that Blaise was trying to be comforting, Draco turned to face him and smiled. “Thanks, Zabini,” he said.
“I don’t want to invalidate your concerns at all, but I’ve been through quite a lot in the past few years. We all have,” he added quickly. “I really do care about Draco though. I want this to work and I’m willing to take the risks, so long as Draco is.”
“It is. Don’t open it, Draco,” Blaise warned. “Nothing good can come of it. Your parents’ retrial is in days for crying out loud, and they’re definitely going to ask you if you’ve had contact with Theo.”
,” Draco said, deeply disturbed at the use of his first name by his arch nemesis and wanted to remind Harry of his place. “Bold of you to assume that I would even want to be friendly with the likes of you. Second—“ Draco gestured to the magical band on his wrist. “If the past is in the past, why the bloody hell am I wearing this like an animal?”
Narcissa bit her lip and nodded. “I understand. I’m—I’m not happy, but most of all, I want you in my life. You can stay. Lucius, he—he hasn’t been himself. His pride is hurt. I’m sure with time—“
“As you know, Draco was forced to take the Mark at the age of sixteen. He was tortured dozens of times, so much that he would stand in a room and forget where he was, that his hands would tremble when he picked up a glass. He was made to do humiliating things under the Imperious Curse. The Dark Lord forced him to torture others, both with the Cruciatus Curse and by other means.”
“No, we didn’t mean to upset you,” Daphne put a hand on his arm before he could get up. “In all seriousness, I think you should just pretend like nothing happened. I’m sure it’s not as big of a deal as you think it is.”
Draco tossed in his bed, already hearing Harry snoring which was both cute and irritating. He tried to turn his thoughts to happier things—he had a date to plan! Of course their options were severely limited, so he would likely have to take Harry to Hogsmeade. Although, maybe he could convince Harry to use his Invisibility Cloak. He still wasn’t sure about the exact parameters of the manacle that he had to wear on his wrist until he graduated from Hogwarts, but he never got a reprimand for the Ministry from their outing to Godric’s Hollow. The advantage here was Harry’s Muggle upbringing—what could Draco show him about the Wizarding World that would make him fall in love with it as much as the world had fallen in love with him?
“Oh. Well, thanks,” Draco said as Harry left. For some inexplicable reason, he held the blanket to his face and smelled it. Potter’s lingering scent served to give him some sort of comfort...horrified with himself, Draco shook his head and threw the blanket to the side.
“A true genius. Now I know how you managed to defeat the darkest wizard of all time,” he joked. He loved making Harry smile.
“Hello, how can I—oh!” She gave a little cry of surprised, straightened herself up, and then began fiddling with the various papers on her desk. “Hello! Mr. Potter—and Ms. Granger and Mr. Longbottom! It’s great to see you here. And uh...your companions,” she gazed reproachfully at the Slytherins. “What can I do for you?”
“This is—I mean that was bad, but this is different. This could be dangerous for you. You saw what Dolohov tried to do, I—“ Draco sighed, rubbing at his left arm. “I couldn’t stand if something happened to you because you were dating me. I don’t know what I would do with myself.”
Draco considered the idea of just telling Harry that he was being blackmailed. But then he thought about how Harry clenched his fist when potions accidentally exploded in class, or the way his shoulders tensed every time someone approached him in the Hogwarts hallways—which was nearly all the time. Ginny Weasley was right to some extent—Harry needed to relax. This wouldn’t be the way to help him do that. Draco had to solve this problem on his own.
“What worst memories could they possibly have? Being on the losing side of the war, sure, but it’s not like you lost family. Your life has been cushy, Malfoy, and you’ve been able to rise to the top with almost no trouble, beating people down as you did it. If falling this far is your or your parents’ worst memory, then I would say better to be in Azkaban than out in the real world where bad things can actually happen to you.”
“This is ridiculous,” Narcissa glowered with some of the spark that Draco had always admired gleaming in her eyes. “They are repeating their same mistakes of two years past. Making a spectacle of great wizarding families simply because they had nothing better to do didn’t help then, and it will not help now.”
“I told you, Potter. Death Eaters can’t cast Patronuses.” Draco glanced at the clock as Potter opened his mouth to argue. It was a quarter to four—he would have to leave in order to meet with his lawyer in time. “I have to go.” Draco left Potter looking sympathetically at him as he snatched up his bag and stalked out of the room.
“It was after...their confrontation in the Forbidden Forest.” Narcissa didn’t need to name the other involved person for them to know who it was. “The Dark Lord commanded me to check to make sure Potter was dead. I wanted to know if Draco was alive, so I asked him. He nodded slightly, and I told the Dark Lord that he was dead.”
“Shhh...” Harry said as he scooped Draco into his arms. Was this the first time that the Boy Who Lived hugged Draco? Harry pressed Draco’s head into the crook of his neck to stifle his sobs. Draco hadn’t even been aware that he was crying, but now that Harry was holding him, he felt safe enough to let out all his emotions. “You’re okay,” Harry whispered to him over and over again. Draco was certainly not okay, but if he could hug Harry like this for hours upon hours, he knew that he would be.
!” Dolohov must have spoken the curse to give it more effect. Draco flew backward and hit his head on a lamppost, body going limp. He looked around woozily through the haze of pain—there was no one around to help, he was going to get taken and there was nothing that could be done. He felt a trickle of blood sliding down the back of his neck. He could barely see from the concussion.
“Thank Merlin, some decent food,” Blaise said, already on his second plate. “My house elves got taken away by the Ministry for questioning, and the replacements they sent couldn’t cook for their lives—almost literally. My mom went mental after the fifth night of dry chicken in a row.” Draco gave a noncommittal grunt in response as he reluctantly piled some food on his plate. “What about you mate, whatever happened to all your house elves? Did the Ministry take them away?”
“Absolutely not. You guys were here through the War, I’m surprised you don’t know better than to make rampant accusations. Keep your nose out of where it doesn’t belong and go to class,” Harry said roughly.
The classroom around Draco faded away as he was sucked into Harry’s memory. How young they all looked—he could see the excitement and nervousness on the small Boy-Who-Lived’s face as he walked onto the pitch, hand shaking slightly as it held the broom. The vision wavered a few times, but for the most part, the memory played clearly. Once it ended and the vision began to blur into a cascade of Potter’s other thoughts, Draco stepped back into himself.
The more negative emotions had multiple doors. Frustration, fear, anger, pain—at the end of the day he would sort through events and compartmentalize those feelings. It allowed him to access any emotion when necessary. To insult Potter, he just needed to open the red anger door, just a pinch. In his darkest days at the Manor, he spent his time looking out the window and strolling through the rooms of his pleasant memories.
“I just know how much you care about your family. So it means a lot to me that you would risk them for me. Even though you absolutely don’t have to.”
There was somewhat of a pained expression on Narcissa’s face. “That’s nice, dear. He’s a good ally to have. Speaking of your future—“ Draco didn’t realize that they had been speaking of the future. “—there’s a reason I keep bringing up Pansy. Their parents would like to come over during the holidays, along with herself.”
“Okay. I understand,” Draco said. “But I don’t want you to worry about me so much that it upsets you. My family is really important to me, and I take risks for them when it’s necessary.”
Harry and Ron were only gone for about ten minutes or so before they came back in, Harry looking triumphant and Ron looking neutral. “Let’s go,” Ron said to Draco.
Narcissa nodded, the other hand pressed to her mouth to keep from speaking. Her eyes were already filling with tears as she gathered her son in her arms. Later, Draco would pretend that the wet spots on his blazer were from her tears, and not his. “My dragon, oh my goodness. I am so, so proud of you. I promise you that everything is going to be okay.”
“I have two questions,” he said, trying to lighten the mood. “First, why are you thinking about dropping out? And second, can you take me with you?”
“Malfoy Manor is being constantly monitored,” Kingsley said. “I will admit that how Nott got beyond those wards and others is unbeknownst to me. Our Aurors are tirelessly investigating the matter. Narcissa, are you aware of how Nott managed to evade our protective measures?”
“Yes...I bumped into someone...” Draco wasn’t going to wait around while they tried to puzzle out this mystery. He needed to get away, and fast. Finally, he spotted Mr. Burke entering a room with a bunch of papers. Before he could second guess himself, he darted into the closing space just before Mr. Burke shut the door.
Harry stopped Draco with a laugh. “I had a lot of fun, actually! You’re cute even when you’re wasted.”
Draco was exhausted after actually eating three meals in a day and desperate for some peace and quiet. However, the shared space was bustling with happy chatter and clinking glasses. Some students quieted down and stared when the Slytherins entered.
“What in the bloody hell are you making over there, Potter? Have you summoned me here to kill me?” Draco peeked in Potter’s cauldron to see a gray, unnaturally viscous liquid.
Draco scoffed. “All I did this summer was lay in bed and relax. I should be over that by now.” He slumped on his bed in frustration.
that, but it was really stupid and I didn’t mean it. Seeing him in that oaf’s arms—“ she poked him with her wand “—fine, Hagrid’s arms, was one of the scariest moments of my life. If you think I enjoyed the Dark Lord living in my house, then you’re right batty.”
Sorry this is a little late! I hope to update every few days or so. The exposition is almost done—now we can get to the good stuff!
“I don’t know and I don’t care. I’m going to bed.” Draco set down his still-full cup of tea and got up, ignoring Granger’s protests.
“Hey...” Draco took Harry’s hand that was turning his forehead red. Harry looked at him with surprise, as though he hadn’t realized what he was doing. “You’re going to wipe off your scar if you keep rubbing at it like that. You always seem to do that when you’re stressed.” Draco traced small circles on Harry’s palm.
“No,” Greg sniffed. “One thing that we promised each other is that we didn’t want to live half a life. Vince was like that anyway, it was always go big or go home. I just don’t know what I’m going to do with my life now.”
Draco smiled, and the rest of the dinner conversation remained light. Draco insisted on paying after a lengthy argument with Harry, but Harry insisted that they go for dessert afterward. All in all, the evening was going perfectly, to Draco’s relief. Conversation flowed naturally, and he often shelved away topics for future conversation. For example, there was clearly something wrong with the Muggles that Harry lived with—it doesn’t seem like he was treated well in the slightest. Harry had hinted at it before, but it seemed to affect him more deeply than Draco thought. But that was to be brought up at a different time, because Draco knew how touchy the subject of family could be. Seemingly in turn, Harry did not bring up the impending trial that was looming over Draco’s head like his own personal cloud.
Draco tore through the cabinets of the bathroom, looking for Dittany, a Bezoar, Essence of Murlap, any potion or item that might stem the bleeding. He couldn’t find anything useful, and now blood was everywhere on the counter. Panic rose up inside `of him, even though he knew that a fast heart rate was not going to help the situation.
Draco wasn’t sure what he expected to see—of course James and Lily Potter’s bodies weren’t here. He wasn’t expecting everything to be so...normal. There were dishes in the sink, turned permanently brown from no one washing them. There was an empty cat food bowl in the corner. Everything was covered with a fine layer of dust, but other than that, it looked like someone could be living here.
They walked in amicable silence out to the courtyard to meet Potter’s friends. Granger and Longbottom both looked somewhat surprised and a little upset to see Draco alongside Harry, but didn’t say anything.
Draco sighed as he pulled on a cashmere sweater, smoothing his hands over the fabric. He really did want to make his mother happy. Maybe a trinket from a store would brighten her day. He’d suck up the painful memories and go anyway. Grabbing his bag, he opened his bedroom door and stepped into the living space. Blaise, Daphne, and Greg were nowhere to be found, but that was alright—the Slytherins all respected each other’s space and didn’t feel the need to spend every second of the day together.
“Where are we going?” But Yarney didn’t answer him, just motioned for him to stand. He led Draco out of the office and into a hallway of a part of the Ministry that Draco didn’t recognize from the long hours he used to spend as a child waiting on his father’s business meetings. They were walking so fast that Draco couldn’t keep track of the hallways—he only was able to identify some of the portraits that tsked as Draco was marched past.
Draco turned to his mother. Narcissa embraced him, and he sighed, releasing something deep inside of him. Tears threatened to escape, but Draco had become good at refusing to let them fall. As Narcissa pulled away, Draco cupped her face in his hands. “I’ll be okay, Mother. I promise you.” His voice threatened to crack, and he felt a deep ache in his chest.
“Oh Merlin,” Draco groaned. “Potter, how many Galleons would I have to give you to have you forget about what I said earlier?”
Draco scoffed. “You don’t even know if it will help. Besides, I can’t imagine a disease for which there is no cure. We’re
Draco plays Quidditch, and finds out how Potter felt when he fainted during the game in their 3rd year...
Draco couldn’t explained why this unsettled him so much. He was used to being lonely, but he was not used to being alone. Whenever he needed something, there was always an easy way to get it. And now it seemed that he had no allies. Without a posse, he didn’t know who he was or what he could do. He closed his eyes and leaned his head against the window, praying that he would be uninterrupted the whole journey.
Harry glared at him. “You know, you should learn to accept help Draco, because clearly you need it.” Harry gathered his things and left, slamming the door behind him.
Granger gave him a sly smile as she stirred her tea. “You know, not too long ago, you were the one giving negative quotes about Potter to the
“Blimey, Potter, you want me to do better than that?” Draco complained. “I consider that one of my best days ever!”
He quietly crept into the room so as not to wake Potter, who was mumbling in his sleep. Draco sighed as he settled back into bed. He was exhausted and nauseated from Granger’s conversation.
They were silent again, then Draco cleared his throat. “I bet everyone had a good laugh over this,” he tried to say lightheartedly.
“Not just any notebook.” Harry flipped the book over, revealing the Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes logo. “These are new from the shop. Meant to make it easier to pass notes in class, but it’ll work for this purpose too.” He set both notebooks on the desk and opened them to a blank page. “Go ahead and write something in yours.”
As usual, the Ministry was a hustle and bustle of loud noises. People were flitting from one place to another, some with cameras and most with briefcases. Draco saw the Prophet in dozens of hands, with his parents’ mugshots on the front cover. He pushed his crush on Harry out of his mind and remembered why they were there. Seeing the others looking a little lost, he pointed them in the right direction. “Alright, the Minister’s office is up the elevator and—“
Draco knew this was a turning point for him, and he knew he was running out of time to make a decision. He swallowed and took a deep breath. He slowly reached out his hand, but when his fingers touched Potter’s, he snatched it away.
Draco had spent his entire childhood listening to his father talk about how vital it was for the Wizarding World to look upon the Malfoys favorably. But surprisingly, he found that he didn’t much care that the
Draco was struggling to breathe, and he felt something placed over his mouth. But no—he didn’t want someone to cut his tongue out again.
“We’ll have to miss class,” Hermione chewed on the tip of her quill. Everyone glanced at her, and she quickly sat up. “But it’s worth it.”
Finally it was time for the feast, and a pit settled in Draco’s stomach again. Amazing food lay before him, but the smell just made him nauseous. How many times had he eaten in the Great Hall last year under the watchful gaze of Death Eater professors, tightly surrounded by his allies who looked to him for guidance and information? How many times had others not as fortunate been barred entry into the Great Hall by the Carrows? How many people sometime didn’t get to eat for days?
“Excuse me! Excuse me, so sorry. I’m really late for the Malfoy trial, it started ten minutes ago—“ A reporter barreled past the group of students, not even noticing the Boy Who Lived.
This was one of the many times during the conversation that Ron’s eyes narrowed. Mrs. Weasley had always been a way for Draco to bother Ron the most. “That’s nice,” Draco said curtly.
“You didn’t,” Draco said more forcefully than he intended. Feeling frustrated, he turned to face Granger fully. “Why do you talk to me? You should
He still was unable to move, but he heard Harry growl, “I’ll have you reported for attacking another student. We’re not doing that here anymore.”
Draco didn’t have the heart to tell Narcissa that he chose not to see Lucius, so he just nodded and watched as his mother was led away. Draco wanted her so badly to not be sentenced to life in prison. He wanted his mother back. But if they were both freed, he couldn’t imagine the wrath from Lucius that would await him...
Draco awoke with a start, but he was sure he hadn’t been screaming. After all, that dream wasn’t quite a nightmare. It did not bother him to think about that day—but he wondered if it bothered his boyfriend. Harry was still sleeping peacefully next to him. The last thing Draco wanted to do was wake him when he looked so peaceful, but he had to know.
He stood up and shook Lucius’s outstretched hand. “Goodbye Father.” Lucius nodded. Draco breathed, wanting to keep the empty, nonplussed feeling he had mustered instead of the rush of emotion rising up inside of him. He would not miss his father. He would not. There was no reason to feel anything except neutrality or relief.
Draco nodded and turned back to the tombstones. There were already flowers there, and messages of support. What more could he offer? Then all of a sudden, a memory came to him. He cleared his throat. “Your father was terrible at Potions, I think.”
“Wait here. I’m going to retrieve the prisoners.” Yarney took himself and his Patronus outside of the room and locked Draco in.
Finally, the hour was up. “Well, Draco,” Christine leaned back in her chair. “I do think that you have something called Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.”
Whew! We’re certainly not done seeing Draco’s parents (after all, we still have to find out what happens to Lucius), but I think we’ll go back to Hogwarts now to develop Draco and Harry’s relationship. 80k words overall without even one good kiss is like 80k too many. So I think we only have a chapter or two before that happens...
After a few moments, the Boy Who Lived spoke up. “You know, you have to keep going to appointments in order to ask her...”
The two men boarded what was apparently boat number four and started making their way to the giant structure ahead. Draco could see the shapes of the Dementors flying around the Azkaban prison. He knew that Minister Shacklebolt was thinking about expelling the creatures from the area, but that he had run into many institutional roadblocks. Draco wished more than anything that all this was happening even just a year from now so that Shacklebolt’s reform could pass.
? All of a sudden everything came flooding back to Draco in a whirlwind. Seeing his mother in Azkaban, the way his father’s glare pierced every part of him...Draco’s hand trembled as he took the mug from Madame Pomfrey. “What time is it?”
. All of sixth year, he nearly hoped someone would notice what he was trying to do and put a stop to it. Now that he wasn’t doing anything, he was being accused. It was a horrendous way of the universe balancing.
“Any more than we already are? Draco over here is practically in handcuffs!” Blaise gestured to Draco’s manacle, which Draco rubbed self-consciously.
“Yes. She’s going directly to Kingsley, to try and work everything out. Draco, I—I’m touched that you didn’t break up with me. I would have understood, if you had. Well, not at the time, but if I had known—“
be terrified of me,” she said, whether to joke with him, convince him, or convince herself, Draco couldn’t say.
Draco nodded, and the four sat in silence for a second. He knew now would be a good time to bring up something that had been bothering him for quite a while. “Do you—do you guys ever think about Theo? Like, wonder what’s going on, or if he’s alright?”
And we’re done with this part of the series! I NEVER thought I would make it this far, so thank you all for reading it. The next series will start January 1, 2020, and we’ll take it as far as we can! Let me know if there’s anything you want to see. I hope you all have happy holidays, and make sure to look out for the next part. Love to all! I can’t thank you enough for coming on this journey with me.
Draco sat up. “Yeah. I just—dreamt of the first time I learned about...Teddy’s grandmother. My mother said she abandoned the family. And I got upset, and then she assured me she and my father would never abandon me.” Draco let out a humorless laugh.
Harry was silent for a moment, and then looked at Draco with a serious gaze. “Do you remember the night that you came to see me when you were sick?”
Harry sat up, looking more alert. “You mean when I cursed you and nearly killed you? Of course I feel bad.”
Draco’s heart had never felt so full, and the pain of it was the best sort. Draco sat up, steadying himself on the bed as the world swayed, and ran his hand along Harry’s cheek. Harry was very still, and looked into Draco’s eyes with sadness. Draco didn’t want Harry to be sad. He leaned in closely and closed his eyes—
Harry gave a small smile. “That’s exactly why I asked,” he said while sitting across from him. “It’s a nice break, you not caring what I do.”
“Absolutely not!” Draco responded, exaggerating his aghast. “I’m a guest in this home, and I’m running out of other places to possibly go. A scandal within the Weasley family is the last thing I need.” He sat on the edge of the bed.
The memory that was making his stomach turn now, though, was the fact that when he would go to the dungeon to bring the prisoners just enough bread and water to keep them alive, Luna always said hello to him. She would remark that he wasn’t looking well, and that everything was going to be okay. The other prisoners would often glare at him, move away in fear, or shout obscenities in his direction, but never Luna. A small solace for him was that he never had to torture her specifically.
. “Why are you speaking to me, Potter? I don’t need you or your pity. I don’t need you to ruin the few peaceful hours I have left.”
“No, I don’t think so. I think it’s more like that we have to acknowledge the roles everyone played. Some students died that were on Voldemort’s side too.” Everyone, including Draco, flinched at the mention of the Dark Lord’s name. Draco felt Harry’s gaze but continued to look at the carpet.
Draco entered his bedroom, where the curtains were shut and it was pitch black. The darkness reminded him of the prison somehow, and his breath caught in his throat. He began to shake even more wildly, and he couldn’t help but let a sob escape him. He had no way to turn on the lights using magic, so he tried to make his way to the curtain in the dark to let in some of the approaching moonlight. Tears were streaming down his face, and he was trying extremely hard to keep it together until he could muffle his cries with his pillow.
“I heard about that. I’m really sorry,” she said sympathetically. “But you know, even if you only use your bedroom to sleep in, that’s perfectly alright. As long as you’re talking to people and remain in good social standing.”
Both boys sat in silence for a few minutes. Then Potter spoke up quietly. “I feel the same way, when I think my scar hurts. In that moment I’m terrified that he’s back. But Draco,” Harry put his hand on Draco’s arm, and Draco met his gaze. “I saw what became of him. He’s gone for good.”
Rare tears shone in Narcissa’s eyes, but like her son, she did not let them fall. “I love you so much, my son. My Dragon.”
Draco tried to meet Harry’s eyes but the young man looked away, blushing. “So...would you want to do this again sometime?”
“I think he just wants to exist,” Draco said almost automatically. Lucius turned his head sharply, but didn’t speak. “He talks in these mandatory group things we have to do about how he just wants to be left alone. I don’t think he’s after anything other than a normal life.”
“Fuck.” Draco tried to stand, drawing the attention of Hagrid’s giant dog. He stumbled and immediately sat back down, waiting to try again.
“We made a deal with the house elves who clean the Owlry...it doesn’t really matter. The point is, we’re not going to let you bring You-Know-Who back. We’re not going to let you trick Potter.”
Draco thought about the last time he boarded the Hogwarts Express. He had no friends, had barely spoken all summer, and lacked the strength to walk far. Now he had gained a healthy amount of weight and could mostly take the staircases in Hogwarts without much trouble. He still had panic attacks, but he knew how to handle them, and he had friends to help him through it for when he couldn’t. Nightmares still plagued him, but they no longer paralyzed him, and he knew that he could drag himself out of bed in the morning no matter what.
“Thanks guys. Honestly I was so focused, I didn’t even see what the Patronus was.” When Draco mentioned this, Blaise started laughing. “What’s so funny?”
There was a long pause in between that message and Harry’s response, and Draco was terrified that Harry was going to be angry with him.
bad, I wouldn’t have minded if you maybe fell off your broom a little more.” Draco felt the beginnings of a smile. “Anyway, you should go. But the only thing that actually helps is to talk about the nightmares. To get closure, to express feelings. I spent dozens of nights up with Ron this past summer, both of us had a lot to get through.”
“Of course,” she said, rounding up some blankets. “Tonight you’ll sleep in Ron’s bed, since Harry’s got the extra in that room. Ron and George are coming from Diagon Alley for the holiday tomorrow, so we’ll have to figure something else out—but that can wait until the morning. Harry can get you anything you need, but here are some extra blankets.”
“Before you go,” Professor McGonagall handed him a sheet of paper. “Your lawyer dropped by, but I told him to come back at the same time tomorrow. He left you this form, though. If you want to visit your parents in Azkaban soon, you should give him this application when he comes. The sooner it is submitted, the better. He’ll be here at four in the afternoon.”
“Wh—“ Draco was astounded. This was a phenomenal piece of magic, but was also sort of terrifying. “Why did your father need to know where everyone was at all times?” He asked this not unkindly.
“Do you really think they wouldn’t have found a way to do that anyway? I don’t want to drag your confidence, but I’m sure Voldemort had backup plans.” Harry shook his head. “No, the only things you need to apologize for are things that you’ve said. The purist things. That, you should apologize for and do whatever you can to make up for it. But things that happened to them when the Carrows were here, or things that happened to their family during the final battle—it’s no more your fault than it is mine.”
“I certainly understand that there would be heavy consequences if you decided to date me. And if you decided to tell people that you were dating me,” Draco began, his voice heavy.
When Draco finally pulled himself up to a sitting position, Harry felt his forehead. “You’re burning up. I’ll help you get to Madame Pomfrey.”
“Look, even if you’re skeptical, it doesn’t hurt to try it. It’s just about techniques to lessen anxiety and handle situations better. I know that we all have nightmares.” Hermione paused and looked around the room for arguments. Most had their heads down in shame, and Draco’s face burned as he studied his shoes. Granger took a deep breath. “Neville, Professor McGonagall, and myself have decided that you all are required to try at least three sessions.” She had her eyes closed, apparently worried about protests, but everyone was surprisingly silent. Pleasantly shocked, she opened her eyes and smiled. “Well—er, great! You all can sign up at Professor McGonagall’s office.”
“One more thing, Draco.” The young man turned around in surprise at the mention of his first name. The Headmistress’s eyes were shiny, as if she were about to cry. “Ms. Lovegood informed me that you were at the Astronomy Tower the day you were attacked.”
“Well, good luck mate. Have a good night and let me know if you need anything. I’ll see you tomorrow.” Draco said goodbye and Blaise walked toward his room and shut the door.
Draco visits his father in the hospital. His return to Hogwarts brings about an unpleasant surprise and revelation.
The Hospital Wing was empty, and Madame Pomfrey came over to the shuffling Draco right away. “Mr. Malfoy,” she said somewhat coldly. Goodness knows how many patients came here last year because of Draco alone. “Professor McGonagall told me to expect you. Come here,” she said, gesturing to a bed nearest to her office.
“Hey, Hermione is visiting Ron tonight and I’m not sure what Neville is up to. Is there any chance I could sit with you at dinner?”
Draco shook his head to clear it. If he was going to have a terrible rest of his life, he may as well enjoy the next six months. Besides, he knew that Harry would have his own challenges upon graduating from Hogwarts. Draco always tried to suppress thoughts of whether or not their relationship would continue beyond their schooling. The idea that Harry may not be in his daily life in less than a year was nearly too much to bear.
“Yeah, it does. That’s a lot of what my Mind Healer and I have been talking about.” Harry lay back down and glanced at Draco. “How’s that going for you, by the way?”
“That’s fantastic!” Harry said. “That vision must have been really good.” Please don’t ask me about it. “I think if you develop it more, you’ll be able to produce a Patronus in no time.”
Draco Malfoy was not unused to bad weeks. Or weeks during which he knew he would suffer enormously at the end. Or weeks that built up to something awful happening.
“Thank you for coming to me with this, Mr. Malfoy. I know that couldn’t have been easy.” Part of the reason Draco approached Professor McGonagall is because he knew that she would not mince words with him. As far as he knew, she didn’t care much about his feelings. She would tell him exactly what he needed to do, no matter the consequences. “Now, what would you like my help with?”
Potter looked very surprised. “Really? You guys went to the Yule Ball together, and...” he looked sheepish. “You laid in her lap on the train to Hogwarts sixth year.”

Despite his attempt to avoid the eighth-years, they seemed to specifically try and seek him out. It appeared that there were two camps of thought. Those close to Harry were the kindest and most open, as evidenced by when Longbottom approached Draco at the Great Hall:
Once he reached the proper floor, he was running, and slammed immediately into Blaise. “What the bloody hell—“
“What the hell is this Granger, an interrogation?” Draco shifted in his chair, ready to stand up and leave.
“I’ll be in my quarters grading papers should you need me,” Professor McGonagall said, and took her leave through the back door.
