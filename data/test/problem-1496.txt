Cassius frowned and turned to Dudley, “
“Caz, you’re marked as deceased,” Dudley said, pointing to the possessor's row.
Frank was called in questioning as he was the only other person who carried the house’s keys. Due to lack of evidence to support the maids and policemen claims that it was him he was let go, but for decades later the people of Little Hangleton still called him a murderer when his back was turned.

“-ck!” Dudley continues, a wave of nausea hitting him as he attempts to stand. He stumbles backwards again and smacks into Harry who too was attempting to stand.
Cassius paused, “Is the procedure done?”
“Dudley what the fuck.” Cassius laughed after reading the inscription on the box. “Sure, I’ll get it for you,” He himself bought three postcards, one for Ron, one for Hermione and one for Sirius. Rons was decorated with Chudley cannons players during a game, the card was spelt to repeat one of the biggest fails that had ever occurred on their playing field. Hermione's was a moving image of a scroll of parchment which rolled out to show different obscene words every time you tapped it. Sirius’ was a hippogriff bucking a rider off its back and shooting off into the sky, the words ‘Fuck You’ appeared on the clouds when the hippogriff disappeared into the distance.
Cassius looked questioningly towards him before he felt his legs being swept out from under him.
He knelt to see a small snake curled up amongst the sand of its enclosure. It had horizontal dusty pink stripes along its pale body.
bit of a shorter chapter today, my apologies, i wanted to write more but it felt like the perfect place to end, ill try to see if i can get another chapter up before the month ends!
“Cassius,” Draco breathed, shaking his head in disbelief, “I thought you were dead,”
Act dumb. Act dumb. “No, are you really Draco?” Not that dumb, fuck.
Cassius laughed, “I’ve got not much else to do here, why don’t we look around? I’ll buy you something.”
On the top of the paper was clearly written,
sorry for the info dump and all the dialogue in this chapter
He had never told Sirius about Vernon, he wondered often if he should have. He was scared of what Sirius would do if he found out. He did not think he could handle Sirius being away in Azkaban again. He would not have anyone.
“Piss off Malfoy,” Fred warned, ready to protect his family,
“So… uh, I’m not Harry Potter anymore.” He laughed awkwardly. Iuhr seemed slightly disappointed but sighed without a word,
"It's Aunt Petunia to you!" She snarled, "Don't forget we're the ones who took care of you after your mother abandoned you, show some respect!" She continued angrily.
“Is there a way though?” Cassius pressed on.
“Hey! Watch the fuck out dick-head!” Cassius yelled out after the young wizard who made an obscene gesture in return.
“Yes, yes, master.”
“I’m 14!”
“This will take a moment,” Iuhr says and the room is plunged into an ice-cold silence. Harry decides that he would rather stay seated on the floor than stand at the moment. The blood stayed in a bubble form on the paper, like water would on glass and did not bleed like ink on parchment.
Cassius whispered in parseltongue to the snake,
Harry ignored her, he tended to do that more these days. Maybe it was because he was growing older, maybe it was because he could feel something was coming, or at least changing. He had always had an intuition of sorts about these types of things. Maybe it was witchcraft. He allowed a small smile to grace his face.
Too bad he was allergic.
Although he had a headstart Dudley still managed to outrun him, red-faced, panting and all.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Okay?”
Dudley was not oblivious to his father’s actions, his father had on occasion raised his hand to his precious son, but Dudley despised his father for how he treated Harry instead. It was not often that Harry was hurt, however, it was far too many times and he felt helpless, unable to do anything but help Harry afterwards.
“Er, no I’m his cousin.”
The lights were still flickering within the house and looking at his watch Frank knew they were about to finish dinner. Strolling languidly past the gate was a young boy, normally Frank would pay no notice to a boy walking past, they did that often, trying to peek through the gates and into the gigantic house. Nevertheless, there was something about this boy that would make a dog raise his hackles. An uneasy feeling stirred in his gut, so Frank watched the boy carefully until he walked out of sight. He still felt considerably troubled, so he did a few rounds of the mansion that night to ensure the boy had not managed to climb over the gate. He briefly wondered if he should warn the family but figured it was better not to. He would later wonder if things would have turned out differently if he did.
“Wait, wh-” Cassius tried to say before an extreme feeling of fatigue hit him like a wall and he immediately went unconscious.
“So~, what exactly are we doing here?” Dudley asked Cassius curiously,
“29 days sir, there are only 32 days till I return to Ho- school.” He said he had been counting them, mentally scribbling tallies, marking each dreadful day.
“Ah, what the fuck!” He shouted, banging his forehead against Dudleys.
Harry himself was not doing much better. They steadied themselves on each other and they stood their eyes nervously searching the huge lobby for any goblin or any person who would help them figure out what they were supposed to do.
INT. the surgical sect of Gringotts, it is a brightly lit corridor with white painted walls and marble floors. There are doors that lead into different rooms. Goblins walk in and out of the rooms carrying parchment, quills and magical items. The corridor is long and there are many wooden doors. The Goblins lead the two boys into one of the last rooms, it too is brightly lit. A single cot lies in the middle of the room and two Goblins stand beside it anticipating the boys’ arrival. A chair is set on the side of the bed.
“I’m glad you’ve adopted the mantle you were destined for Cassius Tom Riddle,” Ollivander called out after them as the pair hurried out of the shop.
“Greetings, come closer so that I can see your faces, my eyes are not what they used to be.”
“What if he never even existed?”
“My, I knew just a boy like you, with stunning red eyes. He allowed me to see them, just one time. I never saw him again, what a tragedy, what happened to him.” Ollivander said ominously.
“Cassius Tom Riddle? What a pretentious name.” Dudley teased, “What are you? Some rich snob?”
“It seems that, because of your scar on your head, due to your reaction to the killing curse when you were younger, partially blinded you in your right eye and gave you that scar. The glasses you wore were charmed and they helped with the blindness. However were not fully effective which may explain any migraines or headaches you may have experienced repeatedly growing up.” Iuhr said.
Malfoy looked like he was about to freak out. His eyes widened and he looked around, alarmed. Apart from Malfoy, Harry and Zabini, there was only one small group of third-year Hufflepuffs hanging around, deep in their own conversation.
to our side. It was really dangerous and irresponsible. What if something had happened? And no one but Dumbledore knew what he and Madam Maxime were doing and where,” Hermione continued, huffing.
The day after Valentine’s Day Harry found Ginny in the common room, a book on her lap, reading the same page over and over again.
When Ginny had left Harry’s home after they had come back from Andromeda, Harry had barely time to sit down and turn on the tv before Hemione knocked on his door and stormed in with two bags of takeaway Thai food.
Even though Katie hadn’t died or anything and the necklace hadn’t caused any more damage, Harry felt like the war wasn’t anymore something abstract and distant, something that took place only outside of Hogwarts’s grounds. And what was worse, Harry
“Of course not. She’s a really good friend, but no, I haven’t told anyone,” Malfoy said. “Which reminds me of Blaise. Why on Earth did he wink at me when you came to talk to me?”
Harry laid sprawled on his bed, trying to get some sleep, but the sleep didn’t seem to come, unsurprisingly. He tried to make himself think about something nice and easy, such as Quidditch or their next trip to Hogsmeade, but his thoughts kept continuously coming back to Malfoy. Harry had to admit to himself that he had always had some pretty harsh beliefs about the Slytherin, but now at least some of them felt like coming crashing down. Not that the git had ever done something to change Harry’s mind, but Harry also knew that he had stuck quite stubbornly with his own view ever since their first encounter at Madame Malkin’s. Once he had formed an opinion on the prat, he had never even bothered to reconsider it. However, Harry believed in second chances and that people could truly change. Had Malfoy changed? Or maybe he had always been the same, but he had let Harry see only the most superficial level.
Feeling Draco’s head on his lap and feeling Draco’s hair tickling his fingers made Harry suddenly feel warm and dizzy all over. All the times he had wanted to touch Draco’s hair that day, and it felt just as silky and soft as Harry had remembered.
“Harry! Mate, come here!” Seamus yelled at Harry cheerily as he noticed him entering the room. “We’ve got firewhisky, vodka, tequila, rum… What would you prefer?” he asked, wrapping his arm around Harry’s shoulder and steering him towards a small table next to the hearth.
“Not really,” Harry muttered, fiddling his sleeves nervously.
“I’ll help you go flying if you want. You can borrow my broomstick.”
Both Ginny’s and Blaise’s eyes widened. “You did
“Are you alright?” Harry asked, worried. “If you’re feeling okay, I should still go, er, somewhere before the curfew,” he said. He had a feeling he needed to see Malfoy now, like right now.
“Harry, he practically told he’s gay. It’s not seen very compassionately among pureblood families, especially in the families like Malfoy’s,” Hermione said.
--*--*--*--*--
“Are you alright?” Draco asked, grey eyes studying Harry carefully.
“Don’t worry, Harry. I’m sure the Wizengamot has to listen to me if I provide them with a pile of proofs about how harmful their decision is in the long run. I’ll show them some studies in black and white about this matter, and I won’t leave before they promise me to listen properly,” Hermione said, trying to smile at Harry reassuringly. “See you tomorrow,” she continued, giving Harry a hug before following her boyfriend and leaving Harry alone to ponder Draco Malfoy and Gregory Goyle and how utterly messed up the world could actually become.
“I just – kind of figured it out myself.”
“Well, that’s the least I can do for her. She has helped me so much,” Draco said, shrugging. “And I do like being with Teddy, even though he’s a bit of a monster,” he said, grinning at the child who was giggling in Harry’s arms now. “How did it go with the Weasleys?”
“Ginny’s right,” Blaise said calmly. “You can’t just kiss people and then push them away. You owe Draco an explanation.”
“Why?”
“No, I mean, yes, but I stayed behind. Tried to eavesdrop on Malfoy and his gang but he spotted me.”
“Er,” Harry said. Now that Ginny had mentioned it, he realized he was actually rather hungry. “No, but I can eat something when we come back.”
“Yes, but I’ve got a gift from the gods to be able to do it discreetly, not once have I got caught.”
“Would you like to come for a visit to the Burrow tomorrow?” Ron asked suddenly, apropos of nothing. “You’d have something else to think about for once, and mum and Ginny have asked a lot after you,” he explained, giving Harry a meaningful look.
“Caught?”
Draco sighed. “Me neither. But if we just tried to endure this for a while, it has to get better soon.”
As Harry was bringing up the rear, he noticed Draco was still sending nervous looks in his direction even though he was clearly trying his best to concentrate on the conversation with Hermione at the same time. Soon, Draco made his excuses to Hermione, slowed down his pacing, and came to walk beside Harry.
like a complete idiot.”
“Yeah?”
Hermione raised her eyebrow. “Just don’t let him hurt or lead you, Harry.”
To be perfectly honest, Draco hadn’t been that much better. He had kept stubbornly hold of his own view; this wasn’t his and Harry’s war, not even the slightest, tiniest bit. This was all between Dumbledore and the Dark Lord, and Draco would gladly let them fight with each other and, hopefully, kill one another in the process. Besides, Draco didn’t understand how Harry could demand so much from him all of a sudden. Firstly, Draco had already done a lot by helping Harry and his lackeys with their stupid club, and, secondly, Harry had been well aware of the expectations that were directed at Draco, so he definitely should’ve known what he had signed up for when he had started seeing Draco.
eating!”
“She’s sometimes all too clever for her own good,” Draco muttered.
Dazed, Draco did as Blaise had advised him. He barely noticed people whispering and staring at him oddly as he walked out of the Great Hall. He strode through the entrance hall as quickly as possible, and when he finally reached to open the front doors, the cold winter air welcomed him with open arms.
“No, I’m already fine with not playing this year. Or, I mean, not fine, but not that angry anymore,” Harry said, trying to come up with an excuse. “I’m just, erm, feeling a bit sick. Been too much outside, s’pose.”
“Yes, we are,” Harry said firmly, starting to undress. He felt slightly mad, or probably even more than only slightly, as he had no idea where he had gotten the bright idea to swim in an ice-cold lake in December. Although, when he was feeling bad or stressed, taking a really cold shower made Harry always relax and snap out of his own thoughts, so this would practically be the same thing. Maybe.
To the right, up the stairs, to the left, long straight corridor, up the stairs again… At the top of the stairs, Draco flinched and closed his eyes in surprise as the windows let natural light flood in. It had been more than two months since he had last seen something other than the flickering flame of a torch, and at first the natural light, despite the day being quite cloudy, was blinding.
“Thank you,” Draco said softly, turning around and leaving Harry who was now strangely overwhelmed by feeling both anxious and like he wanted nothing more than call Draco back and pull him into his arms.
The look on his mother’s face turned to a completely unreadable one. “You’re absolutely sure about this?” she asked, her mouth set in a straight line.
“What?”
“That should be quite obvious, shouldn’t it?” Blaise said as Ginny sat down next to him. “It’s a picnic, Potter. Ever heard of it?”
“God, I hadn’t realized the phone was for you!” Ginny cried out. “Can you really use it?”
“Er,” Harry began. He hadn’t even considered staying in the Room for the night as an option.
“Erm, right. I don’t know what to say about that,” Harry mumbled.
Harry could feel Malfoy’s whole body warm against his own and Malfoy’s rapid breath on his face as he stared into the Slytherin’s furious eyes.
“My dear old friend Severus, of course. He had rather interesting stories to tell when I got out of Azkaban,” Lucius said, smirking. “According to him, you’ve been courting our Lord’s worst enemy already for two years. Sounds pretty serious.”
,” Draco heard the shout echoing feebly somewhere near the prison and suddenly felt his body begin to tremble rather violently.
They both fell into silence. Harry could see that Malfoy was still tense and restless as if there was some kind of a storm going on inside his head. Harry was nonplussed by how Malfoy didn’t seem to want to, or even not be able to, hide his emotions from Harry. Fear and anxiousness were definitely that sorts of emotions that Malfoy considered as a sign of weakness, and something that Harry might use against him in the future. Malfoy’s openness made Harry feel somehow warm inside. He had a strange urge to touch the Slytherin’s face, to make his frown smooth and to hug him for as long as Malfoy’s worries would disappear and the tenseness would melt away. After a long moment, Harry sighed.
“I don’t know if I should be scared,” Draco muttered, but his grey eyes glinted excitedly as he took Harry’s present in his hands. “You haven’t transfigured this paper yourself.”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “No, but really. You clearly want to be more than just friends with him. What’s there to stop you?”
There had been so many people saying the same, and Harry had started slowly believing the words as they were repeated over and over again. Even though he didn’t blame himself for the snake attack anymore, there were still some thoughts that didn’t leave him alone.
“So, how was it?”
“Yes, this is,” Harry said, feeling himself getting angry now. “Can’t you really see it? You’re actively choosing Voldemort’s side.”
“Oh Jesus, I forgot my Transfiguration essay,” Hermione said, searching it fervently in her bag. “I must go get it.”
"Did they open the doors already?" Pansy asked irritated, trying to peek between Draco and Blaise in her giant and horrifyingly pink dress robes.
“How’s it going with Arithmancy?” Granger asked as she noticed what Draco had been trying to read.
“Well, no, but –”
“Oh. Good. Okay. Let’s have a walk around the lake?”
“Merlin, I hadn’t realized Teddy looks so much like his mother,” Draco said, scrutinising a picture of a happily smiling, teenaged Nymphadora.
Harry pulled a book from his bag. It was an old, Muggle children’s book that looked like it had been read thousands and thousands of times.
“My family has always been quite modern and open-minded in the pureblood scale. And Draco is one of my best friends, of course, I’m going to stand by him,” Zabini said. “Potter, please, just talk to him. He’s miserable at the moment, and I only want him to be happy.”
Harry gulped, feeling all too many emotions at the same time to be able to control them. “I think I love you,” he blurted out.
they are wandering, I meant to say,” he continued, smirking at Harry and Draco.
After his weekend getaway, Harry started acting like a bloody lovesick teenager again. He found it hard to sleep and eat, and now not only because of the war memories but also because he felt just too excited, restless, and giddy all the time. All he wanted was to be with Draco but when he was with him, he felt like his tongue got twisted and he was suddenly feeling too warm and his heart was beating too hard in his chest. And being with Draco was never enough, anyway, because Harry wanted to touch him so badly, to play with his hair, to run his finger on his face, to pull him into his arms, to kiss him, tasting how he tasted like… But Harry couldn’t do any of those things because they were supposed to be friends. Just friends.
“I’d like that. Very much,” Draco said softly, giving Harry a shy smile that made Harry feel like melting. God, he should take a grip of himself before he would complicate things by doing something as stupid as last night.
“Oh, I haven’t heard this story!” Zabini exclaimed excitedly. “Didn’t know you’re such a passionate lover, Draco.”
Both Ginny and Ron burst out laughing, which made Madam Pince shoot them a warning look.
And so the fluff is back. At least for a while, hehe.
Draco forced his eyes open and nodded. Potter nodded back with his mouth in a line and started walking faster again, although that wouldn’t have been necessary as the Auror had just stopped in front of a large wooden door.
--*--*--*--*--
“Not really. But now that you mentioned it, I think they fit quite well for an almost-Slytherin,” Draco said, handing the present to Harry. “You don’t get to open it before Christmas. And you know I do get to know if you’ve cheated.”
Harry knocked on the door hastily before he had time to reconsider coming there and turn around.
low or his phone has gotten broken or something,” Ginny said. “Why don’t you check your phone now? We should be far enough from the Burrow.”
“Well, we got some information about our duties as prefects. And there are also other prefects, two from all the Houses,” Hermione started saying, wearily.
“Are you sure?” Molly asked, looking at Harry as if studying him. “If it feels uncomfortable to you at all, I won’t ask them.”
“I don’t know, Malfoy! And honestly, I don’t even care,” Harry said, pushing Malfoy hardly on the chest. “Just leave me alone!” Harry said before leaving Malfoy alone in the corridor.
“And he hasn’t tried to reach out to you?”
“Mm, I think I might’ve some kind of idea what you’re talking about. Though I still think this is a huge improvement to the earlier,” Harry murmured while kissing Draco. “You know, being obliged to pass so much more time together by the force of circumstances. That’s horrific.”
“No, nothing in particular,” Harry said and noticed Malfoy leaving from the Great Hall. “I think I’m going to take a walk, need some fresh air.”
“I know, I know,” Harry said, feeling like dying of guilt now. “I’m sorry.”
Blaise, who was at least on somewhat amicable terms with the Gryffindors, had decided to go to hover somewhere near to the Gryffindor common room entrance and wait there until one of the lost Gryffindors would appear, meanwhile Draco had gone straight to the Room of Requirement. Which felt a bit stupid considering all the lonely evenings he had passed there during the last couple of weeks, pining for Harry.
wandering around the castle after the curfew in the first week,” snarled a too much familiar voice somewhere near Harry. He snapped his eyes open, just to meet Draco Malfoy’s sneering face right in front of his own.
“At least a hundred times better than your suggestion. God,
“Hm?” Harry muttered.
“I don’t want to go,” Draco whined quietly.
Harry knew better than to answer Snape’s accusation. Instead, he put his bag on the floor and sat down on the chair Snape had placed for him beforehand.
Ginny huffed. “I don’t understand how you can stand their pointless bickering. I’m absolutely done with it.”
“Don’t be stupid,” Ginny hissed. “You two can stay under the same roof for a while.”
Harry looked at Draco, worried. “But you’re not going back, are you?”
”Hey, how did it go in Hogsmeade?” Harry asked, turning around on the couch by the hearth when he heard the portrait hole opening and saw Hermione and Ron coming in. Harry had been lucky as he had made it to the common room before his friends. He had even had time to fetch his Charms book and a cup of hot tea, so he looked like he really had been resting for the whole day.
Malfoy opened his mouth to say something, but closed it, changing his mind apparently. Then he opened his mouth again, this time a bit hesitantly. “Well, alright then,” Malfoy said and looked Harry in the eye, and Harry could see a glimpse of softness in Malfoy’s expression.
“But Professor –” Harry started saying.
as it certainly wouldn’t be easy to find his place in the world of the new order after everything he had done.
But Harry kept silent, mouth set in a grim line as he looked Draco straight in the eye.
“I’ll keep that in mind,” Draco said, his lips now only an inch or two away from Harry’s. “You know, for the future.”
The look on Draco’s face turned confused. “How? How could you have forgiven me?”
“Yes, I do remember perfectly well you told me she might have a crush on me, thank you very much,” Harry said, cutting her short. “I’m going to talk to her as soon as I figure out what to say to her.”
“And I doubt Blaise will draw too much attention to himself right now. He’s considered as some sort of a traitor as he’s chosen to be Draco’s friend even after he was disowned,” Ginny said gloomily.
When all three stepped into the office, Snape walked to his desk as both Harry and Draco walked automatically to the corner that was most far away from Snape. The two boys didn’t dare to look at each other, but they still could feel each other’s bodies radiating warmth as they stood next to each other, almost touching.
with that!”
¡SPOILER ALERT! Long story short, one of the main characters is a Jehovah’s Witness, and when he comes out to his parents, they organize this kind of funeral for their son to shut him out of the family & community and to make him “dead” to them.
Which she did now even by appearing in Draco and Blaise’s room, apparently.
Harry took a long breath in and closed his eyes. God, he should take a grip of himself as he knew he was now so close to repeating the mistake he had made the night Seamus had organized the party in their common room. It was just that now Harry wasn’t even drunk. It must be the Pepper-Up Potion. Or the lack of sleep. Or probably even both.
And Draco blamed himself, had blamed every day since he had left Harry at the end of the sixth year. It was no wonder Harry was acting so distant. Actually, even having Harry testifying for him in a letter form had been much more than he had been expecting. He didn’t know how his life would have turned out to be if he had had the strength to stay with Harry, and actually, it felt quite useless to even ponder that anymore. He had made his choice and stuck with that. To be honest, it all felt still so blurry somehow, and he wasn’t sure, not even today, which path he should have chosen.
Harry felt horrified. He had never even heard of such a tradition, and it still sounded completely bizarre Draco's parents had been able to organize something like that. “But this doesn’t make any sense! Why on earth would they do that to him?” he asked, looking at both Ron and Hermione.
“I think I have to. I don’t think I have a choice,” Draco said, stroking Harry’s tangled hair.
“Try to go to sleep,” Draco said, stroking Harry’s cheek gently.
Or finish my home
“I can get it, heard a bit about that.”
Their movements became soon fast and erratic, and even Malfoy seemed to lose control over himself as he was now panting against Harry’s neck, mumbling gibberish, and thrusting wildly their cocks together in Harry’s lap.
“Well, he said it feels a bit weird to be there as he can’t talk about anything magic related, but he said it still feels like people there can understand him and he them.”
it was something Draco had eyed there before.
“If you say so,” Ginny said, shrugging. “So, when are you going to have a housewarming party?” she asked suddenly, apropos of nothing.
“What do you mean what’s wrong with me?” Harry said coldly.
“What do you mean ‘you’re not going anywhere’? Potter asked, dumbfounded.
“Draco, you’re a terrible liar.”
“Harry,” Draco agreed softly and kissed Harry’s cheek before leaving Harry alone under the Cloak.
“Oh darling, you’re such a romantic,” Draco said, snickering. “Besides, I thought you liked hiding. Makes life much more exciting.”
“So, erm,” Harry said a bit hoarsely. “You’re going to Andromeda’s today?”
an utter git and full of himself but c’mon, he can’t be a Death Eater.”
“Leave my mother out of this,” Draco hissed, eyes flaming. “She’ll get over losing me.”
“’Course. We’ll just have to plan it a bit better as I’ll be at the Burrow, but I think I could sneak away with Ginny for a while or something.”
“Really?” Hermione asked, surprised. She hadn’t apparently thought Harry would agree. “Right. I don’t know where to start.”
Draco’s eyes widened comically. “We’re on a pet-name basis now? Merlin, this is progressing fast. We’ve barely just started on the first-name basis.”
“Oh, fine, you insufferable git,” Draco snarled, apparently attempting to look annoyed but he couldn’t quite manage to make a serious face.
“So, what are you trying to tell me with all this? That I should forgive him?” Harry asked, annoyed.
a laughing matter,” Hermione said. “There was no way you would’ve been able to guess, Harry.”
“No, I mean it. Really,” Harry said, laughing. “That sounds… oddly sexy.”
“What happens next?” Harry asked, feeling horrified. The list of the Death Eaters had become terrifyingly short, actually almost non-existent, and soon there wouldn’t be left anyone else but Malfoy –
“Maybe the stupid friend of yours has got himself badly injured,” Malfoy whispered to Harry’s left ear so that only Harry was able to hear him.
Because how could anyone in their right mind wish for someone so young to die? Someone, who had admittedly made some bloody stupid decisions as a teenager, but who still had the whole life ahead of them? Harry was well aware that he and Malfoy had a rather difficult and eventful shared history, but Harry still couldn’t remember himself hoping for something really bad to happen to Malfoy. Not even when he had used
Draco hesitated but turned his stormy eyes to meet Blaise's after a moment. "Hey, it's okay, just concentrate on breathing for a moment. In and out,” Blaise murmured reassuringly, and Draco tried his best to focus on inhaling and exhaling in turns.
Harry sighed and put the ring back under his shirt. This schoolyear was starting like utter shit.
“What happened?” Draco whispered, frozen to the spot.
Harry’s life was going a little better otherwise, too. He kept still on avoiding going to the wizarding places as much as possible, but instead of locking himself inside his home, he had started to visit different Muggle places with his friends. He had never learned to know the Muggle London that well, so he felt like a tourist there most of the time as they went to the movies, different restaurants, cafes, bars, and even museums. At first, Harry and Ron hadn’t been too thrilled when Hermione had proposed they would visit some of the most famous museums in London, but in the end, it had been worth it as seeing Ron and Ginny reacting to all kinds of Muggle things had been just so hilarious.
Blaise and Ginny had done their best to make Draco and Harry talk to each other again, driving them both on the verge of madness. Draco had lost count of how many times he had been called
“I’m so –”
The chance to tell Ron appeared quite naturally the next day. After another disastrous class of Defense, which had, surprise, surprise, ended up with more detentions to look forward to for Harry, Hermione had suggested they started studying Defense by themselves. Harry, Ron and Hermione were sitting in the otherwise empty common room in the middle of the night, and Harry had grudgingly promised to think about Hermione’s idea of him teaching the Defense to other students.
“That’s not your business either,” Harry said, tired.
“How’s it going with you? Still not going to Draco’s trial?”
“You were eavesdropping on us.”
“I swear, this time I’m not,” Draco yelped and raised his hands up in surrender.
“Yes. But it’s not my story to tell, you’ve got to talk to him,” Blaise said firmly.
Malfoy must have noticed that because he continued. “The thing between me and her was never real. I’ve tried to make me like girls, but it’s never worked out,” Malfoy said, sighing. “It felt wrong, thinking about you when I was kissing her. So, I ended things with her. And being in a fake relationship wasn’t fair to her, either.”
“What do you mean?” Harry asked quickly.
“Of course. What kind of wrapping paper do you want? Hearts? Roses?”
,” Draco whined. “Don’t mind her, she’s always like this when we’ve got a guest with us,” he said, placing his hand on Harry’s thigh and squeezing it lightly.
“Well, ‘course not, but –.”
“Er, Gin, I think I’m not in a mood right now,” Harry said.
“I didn’t want to kill them! I never wanted anything to happen to Weasley or the Bell girl!” Draco cried, devastated, trying to take Harry’s hand, but Harry snatched it away.
But the thing that had helped Harry the most had probably been seeing Teddy. It was actually quite bittersweet to see him as he reminded Harry a lot of his own past, which is why he wanted to make sure Teddy would get as good a childhood as he could with a lot of loving people around him. Besides, even despite Teddy’s background as an orphan, it felt still so good and refreshing to regularly see someone who was so full of energy and completely unaware of all the horrors that had taken place during the past few years. Seeing Teddy getting excited about basically everything he saw around him made also Harry feel like maybe there still was something beautiful and good in the world.
Harry didn’t say anything, he just followed Draco into the classroom.
“I’m a natural talent,” Ginny said and winked at Harry, long, flaming red hair waving in the wind and brown eyes glistening playfully. “So, it went quite well, didn’t it? Got your message through despite your usual stuttering.”
“I’m glad to hear. I mean it,” Harry said, smiling at Draco. “Have you made any friends there?”
It was a hot and sunny summer day, far enough from the War for them to be able to do something as mundane as enjoying the weather and having drinks in the garden but still too near for them to be able to talk about anything else but the War.
“Oh,” Draco said, sounding disappointed.
“Er, what does this have to do with psychology?”
“Neither could I, but I can see there’s also something else bothering you,” Andromeda said firmly.
“But that sounds… How could anyone even consider abandoning their child only because they’re not straight?” Harry said incredulously. “But you’re pureblood as well? How come you’re being this supportive?”
“Before that we would like to show him the list of charms and curses,” The voice of Quhov immediately cut through.
“Fuck!” Harry said angrily, he had done Paper and Dudley had done Scissors.
“What’s that smile for?” She said, raising her hand and slapping the back of his neck.
Frank Bryce stayed at the Riddle House, he himself did not know why he had decided to stay even after all the maids had left and the house stayed abandoned. He liked the quiet he had decided, thus he stayed, caring for the house and the remnants of its past inhabitants. Cutting through the quiet air he heard a low voice. Frank had worked had worked at the house for a very long time, he was familiar with voices that would float through doorways and footsteps that would run through the corridors. However this was different, it was menacing but strangely alluring and he found himself drawing closer.
“A-a muggle is a non-wizard.” Pettigrew said, “We (he gestured to the sitting man and himself) are wizards.”
“Huh?” Cassius looked up to see the one and only Draco Malfoy as he made his way through Diagon Alley, a disgusted sneer on his face as he walked behind Narcissa Malfoy. Lucius was unsurprisingly not present. He didn’t seem like an active nor decent parent considering he was Draco’s worst fear.
“You must be a descendant of him,” Ollivander said softly, a smile on his wrinkly face.
“Sit. Lie down.” the Goblin standing closest to them, Uvui, said gesturing first to Dudley and then to Cassius.
“Hello Messr Riddle, we have arranged your transport to the Riddle Manor. As it is currently unoccupied it was fairly easy to organise. I suggest you stay there for a week to recover Messr Riddle, then you may return home. Messr Dursley, we have already arranged a portkey to return you to your home.” Iuhr explained, “I’m sorry to shoo you off this quickly but as you can see I’m extremely busy at the moment,”
“Good, now don’t worry about Bertha Jorkins, I have taken care of her. She has told me everything I need to know.”
“What are you gonna do about all this Caz?” Dudley asked curiously.
He thought about sending a letter to Dumbledore to warn him but after Dumbledore's dismissal of him at the end of the third year, he figured that the Headmaster was most likely extremely busy and would rather that Harry didn’t bother him for the rest of the summer vacation. Dumbledore did run an entire magical school.
“Fuck.”
“Hate to break this to you, but we gotta run,” Cassius said quickly, pulling a few bags from Dudley's arm.
chess pieces reference// idk, i thought it would be fun to refer to his secrets as chess pieces and base how incriminating they would be on how powerful the pieces are
“Well, you are the heir to the Riddle name, the Riddle house is an option. It’s in Little Hangleton. You could take the KnightBus. It’s unoccupied.” Iuhr suggested.
He stood there paralyzed for the next 15 minutes.
“Dudders! Why are you setting the table!” Petunia squealed, rushing into the kitchen and pulling the forks and knives out of Dudley’s hands, “That’s Harry’s job!”
“Grab my arm.” Dudley grabbed Harry’s arm. The time slowly ticked by.
He could not help but be thankful that he was a wizard for in muggle school he would have been bullied within an inch of his life for a name like Cassius. Iuhr was staring at him with an odd look. He realized he had paused for too long.
“Shut up Weasley,” Draco said, clenching his fist.
Unfortunately, for the convenience of the plot, Draco made eye contact with Cassius and froze. Quite literally. Stopped in the middle of the street not moving, paralyzed type of frozen. Cassius noted that a hairdryer would be pretty handy right at this moment to melt Draco back into movement. However, the boy in question managed to pry his mouth open and uttered a word that sent Cassius’ mind reeling. He shoved at Dudley and they both rushed off leaving a pale boy standing, as still as a corpse, shell-shocked in the middle of the street.
“It really is.” They sat in silence for a few moments before Cassius felt a tear slip out from his eyes. “Jesus,” He choked a laugh as he wiped his face with his sleeve. It didn’t help as only more tears seemed to pour out of his eyes.
Cassius immediately looked over to see a disgruntled Quhov and Iuhr standing by the door. Dudley explained quietly that Uvui and Hevpu had left ten minutes earlier once the procedure had finished.
“You always forget I know what your thinking,” the man says, “Of course you will be rewarded for your capture, you mustn’t worry about that, I keep my word.”
“Mm, as much as I appreciate this, I know you care,” Harry said, pushing Draco gently on the chest. “And that’s fine. Honestly.”
Harry squirmed a little guiltily. “Actually, I’ve already told Ginny about us. Or she kind of guessed I’m seeing someone, and I didn’t deny it.”
“Did he have a boyfriend at school?” Ron asked. “Or a huge crush on someone?”
Malfoy regarded Harry coldly. “I don’t know what you’re trying to say. There’s nothing between us,” Malfoy said vehemently.
” Molly had said firmly with a knowing look in her eyes.
“Oh for fuck’s sake, Harry, not everyone is as hot-tempered as you are. If they had acted more visibly, they would’ve gotten caught, and who would’ve helped us then? It was much better to have some kind of spies on their side, prying us information about the Carrows’ moves.”
“I’ll come if Andromeda wants to go. Though I suppose that won’t be even a question.”
“I don’t know if that’s a good idea,” Harry said, biting his lower lip.
Malfoy looked anxious, but this time he seemed to be able to stay. He took a deep breath a couple of times, eyes closed.
“What do you mean you know? How could you know what I’ve done?” Draco asked, perplexed.
“You’re all dishevelled and as red as a tomato! You haven’t even tucked your shirt in trousers!”
“Good. Well, I think I’m off to bed now,” Hermione said, yawning.
“Exactly. But I assume you’re not talking about them when you’re referring to the pureblood culture?”
“Harry," Draco said, feeling confused. "Is there something wrong?"
Draco’s gaze turned to pensive. “I don’t know, Harry,” Draco said. “But it’s not good to get mixed up with Muggles or Muggle-borns. They don’t know our culture or our ways of living. Besides, Muggles did try to persecute and kill us, especially during the 16th century.”
Draco felt tears filling his eyes again. Merlin, he had become such a weeper.
proofs you have had something to do with their escape, you will answer for that directly to me,” Snape hissed venomously. “Now go. This doesn’t concern either of you.”
only for four months and she was not to leave the country for five years. In addition to that their whole family was ordered to pay a great amount of money as war reparations, and that added to the absence of any kind of servants would definitely make sure the Manor was not going to be the same as it was before the War. As if it even could be, after all the horrors that had taken place in there.
They both froze for a second before Draco’s mouth found Harry’s lips again. “We don’t have to answer the door,” Draco said, pulling Harry tighter against himself as if to support his words.
But Harry had been wrong, Dumbledore had been an ordinary mortal, just like everyone else. Draco had just witnessed it; he had seen only a couple of minutes ago how one of the most powerful wizards of all time had been forced to bend to his destiny when his ‘loyal’ ally had been revealed to be a double-agent who had been working for the Dark Lord all this time. It had all been so plain and simple: no huge and long battle, no curses and spells an average wizard wouldn’t even dare to dream of. Just two simple words and green light, and then, the greatest wizard of the light side had been hanging in the air helplessly for a second before falling down, defeated.
” Granger said. “
, it’d be for Malfoy. I think he deserves another chance,” Hermione said.
“Sorry, sorry,” Zabini said, raising his hands up in surrender. “But honestly, I’d have paid a fortune only for getting a glimpse of the expression on Snape’s face when he caught you. The poor Professor, walking to his office to have a lunch break and then abruptly finding the Golden Boy seducing his dear, innocent godson,” he continued, snickering.
“That doesn’t make any sense,” Harry muttered.
, but you hadn’t told anything even to Blaise! For fuck’s sake, you idiot, you scared the hell out of me! Don’t you dare to do something like that again!”
Draco didn’t seem to have any objection to that, so instead, he decided to turn around, take Harry’s face between his hands and kiss him deeply.
Harry halted and turned around, sighing heavily. “If you’re coming to lecture me, don’t bother. Hermione already did that.”
“Mm, maybe not,” Draco said. “So, how do we continue from now on?”
Harry pulled Malfoy against him so that Malfoy was laying on him, their limbs entwined tightly together. Malfoy’s head was resting on Harry’s chest, and Harry could feel Malfoy’s hair tickling slightly under his jaw. They fell into somewhat bittersweet silence as they watched clouds floating slowly by.
For a moment, neither Harry nor Draco said anything as they both just concentrated on feeling the autumn sun making their skin tingle rather pleasantly and looking at the birds flying high up in the sky, probably heading south for the winter.
Sirius looked Harry in the eye now. “Just don’t be too hard on him. He’s so young and still blindly repeating what he’s heard from his parents, especially from Lucius. One day he may hopefully be able to think for himself.”
It was indeed a lot easier to breathe in Scotland. Not only because Harry’s Voldemort related problems seemed somewhat smaller there, but also because the air felt so much fresher there than in London.
“So you hung out with him after we had zoned out?” Harry asked, grinning.
“But what do I tell him?” Harry asked, feeling somewhat dum.
it, I’d have said you’re a lunatic,” Draco said as they were both packing their suitcases for the trip.
“Ask Kreacher to levitate you, I don’t care,” Potter answered, slamming the bathroom door shut after himself.
“And how has it been?”
“Oh, yeah. I talk a lot with Ron and Hermione. And Ginny.”
Draco’s fingers ghosted over the outlines of his Dark Mark. Everything could be so different now if he had never taken it. He wouldn’t be despised, marked, and chased now. He might not be exactly liked without the Mark, either, but at least he would be free from the target on his back.
“None taken,” Harry said, sulking a little.
“I’ve got no answer for that,” Draco said, fiddling with Harry’s locks. “But I’m happy that you came.”
And then, without a warning, Draco turned his broom towards the ground and dived before Harry could blink. Harry dodged the quaffle and tried to catch a glimpse of what Draco was seeing, and there it was, the snitch, hovering only a few inches above the ground in the middle of the pitch.
Suddenly, the heavy wooden door creaked open, making Draco’s train of thought come to a halt.
Ginny sighed heavily. “I know, it’s only a couple of months since the War. But Harry, you know I can’t wait for you forever.”
“And you must be Ginevra Weasley,” Blaise said, taking Ginny’s hand and kissing the back of her hand elegantly. “Blaise Zabini, Draco’s friend. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”
Draco had known there was no way Harry would take part in his trial, but he had still felt his heart sinking when Harry’s letter had been opened and read out loud instead of Harry being there present as flesh and blood. Harry had written about Draco in a good light, telling how Draco had actually tried to help them and shown signs of regret when lowering his wand in the Astronomy Tower, but the tone in his letter had been so cold and business-like, as if he hardly knew Draco.
Draco wrapped both his arms around Potter’s shoulders, trying
“I beg your pardon?” Draco murmured back, sounding slightly amused.
“Let go of me,” Draco snapped, pushing Potter feebly away. It resulted to be a really bad idea because as soon as Potter had let go of him, Draco was about to fall on the ground. Potter took quickly hold of Draco again, this time staying cautiously a bit farther away and wrapping only one arm around Draco’s waist.
“With pounds and Muggle spirits and all?” Harry asked, a bit surprised.
Harry came all too soon, feeling unable to control his body at all. He would’ve felt embarrassed if Draco hadn’t come just a second after him, collapsing heavily on Harry.
“Are you sure you’re alright?”
“Hey, he’s not better than me! My fingers are just thicker,” Harry argued.
“Thanks, I s’pose,” Harry mumbled, eyes still fixated on his cup, but Seamus had already disappeared into the crowd.
“What’s this?” Harry asked in a hoarse voice, even though he was well aware of what it was. He let go of Draco’s hand, and Draco took a hold of his Mark as if it burned.
“I know,” Draco murmured, kissing Harry lightly.
Hermione narrowed her eyes. “If you’re sure,” she said suspiciously. “Can we get you something from there?”
Tai laulustani valmiin
As Harry opened the door to the Room of Requirement, he found Draco in the Room, looking out of the window, glass-eyed. When he heard Harry entering, he turned around and blinked a couple of times.
“And when exactly have you become the voice of reason?”
“Really Draco? Are you honestly telling me the only reason why you’re not telling me are my lacking skills in Occlumency?” Harry asked, incredulous.
“Kind of,” Harry said. “Look, I don’t want to talk too much about things that concern him, he can tell himself.”
“Shut up,” Harry snapped, feeling himself getting angry.
“So did I. I meant it when I said I couldn’t stand a moment longer in that rat hole. Can’t believe Sirius has been there for months without going out.”
“Well, that was a great pleasure again,” Blaise said as the huge doors closed behind them, preventing their curious fellow students from ogling at them any longer.
“Actually, thought we could go together,” Harry said and pulled the Invisibility Cloak out of his robe pocket.
“Thought we could have a picnic. Asked, erm, a friend of mine to fix us something to eat.”
Harry turned his gaze back to tv, trying to give Hermione time to gather her thoughts.
“Oh,” Harry said, not knowing how to continue this conversation.
Harry changed his position so he could look Draco straight in the eye. He felt dumbfounded. He had assumed Draco would’ve disapproved of his idea or probably even gotten a fit of some sort.
Harry gasped and snapped his eyes open.
Harry took the place next to Draco, right opposite to happily smiling Blaise and Ginny.
After drinking the tequila, Harry started feeling pleasantly warm and dizzy, and he was pretty sure he was having a stupid, goofy smile on his face. He could hear people laughing all over the room and the conversation streamed easily, making Harry feel light and… happy? Being surrounded by his friends and laughing with them at ridiculous jokes felt just so, so good, and just for a while, Harry felt like he was only a teenaged boy with a normal teenage life. Maybe letting Seamus drag him into the party hadn’t been that bad idea after all.
The idea of Molly giving Draco a Weasley sweater is borrowed from alizarincrims0n's fic 'Temptation on the Warfront'.
“Yes,” Draco said coolly.
“Okay, Blaise, maybe it’s time for you to go,” Draco said, sounding embarrassed.
“Oh, darling, I meant what I said earlier. You are welcome here whenever you want,” Molly said, smiling motherly. “And I bet Andromeda would say the same. You are still going to visit her and Teddy tomorrow, aren’t you?”
The more time passed, the more Draco had started to admire Sirius. It felt like it was a lifetime ago when he still had despised him and sawn him as a blood traitor, but everything that had happened during the ongoing school year had made him see Sirius differently. Draco could now find himself relating to Sirius, who had also been a child in a pureblood family but who had still found his own values and lived by them.
Harry turned his eyes to Ginny and looked at her, confused. “Erm…”
“No!” Granger said, almost panicky. “I just thought that because there isn’t much support available for people with the background like yours in the Wizarding world, maybe you’d like to try some sort of Muggle support group,” she continued hesitantly.
He didn’t care about someone yelling at him angrily when he crashed into them.
Draco sighed heavily. He knew this was going to be a problem.
“Wa-water,” Harry said, coughing and hitting his chest.
“Why wouldn’t it be enough?” Molly asked simply.
Draco's friends had commented a couple of times on his constant need to embarrass Potter and to get a reaction out of the Gryffindor, and Pansy and Blaise had gone even as far as to call it an obsession of sorts. Though of course there was no way Draco would be obsessed. Potter was just so utterly annoying and arrogant and basically just begging for problems all the time, so Draco couldn't help but continuously bring the git back down to earth. Someone had to do it.
“No.”
“Oh, Harry, the Mark’s just some stupid black lines on his skin. It doesn’t define who he is,” Ginny said with a hint of frustration in her voice. “You know Draco. Don’t let all you’ve learned about him just go wasted because of this.”
Mut ilman sua ne ois sointuja vaan
“Yes, Draco,” Sirius said, nodding. “I’m actually quite sad for them, Narcissa and Draco. Narcissa was on the verge of coming to our side for a long time, but she was too loyal to her husband and the Black family. She couldn’t stand the fear of getting abandoned by them.”
“Tomorrow at the Quidditch pitch,” Harry said and grimaced, referring to the Slytherin versus Gryffindor match. “Could show you the place I was talking about after the match?”
Draco hadn’t exaggerated when he had told Harry that he still had his bad and grim moments. Then Draco usually just laid on his bed, staring at the ceiling and not feeling like talking to Harry at all, nor to anyone else for that matter, which made Harry feel almost as utterly helpless as during their sixth year. This time, though, Harry could talk to his mind healer about the situation and ask him for some advice, and he said that the best thing Harry could do for Draco was to show him that he was there present and willing to listen if Draco wanted to share his thoughts and feelings. That advice helped actually both of them quite a lot as Harry stopped trying to push Draco to tell him what there was going on inside his head, meanwhile he also started gradually to be able to let go of the feeling of helplessness as he began to understand there really was nothing else he could do for Draco, and if there was, he should trust Draco to tell him.
“You might be right,” Hermione said, pensive. “Did you know, Ginny? You passed quite a lot of time with him when you started dating Blaise.”
Harry snaked his arm tightly around Draco and pulled him as close to him as he could. He kissed Draco’s forehead fondly, a small smile on his face, before letting his body fall asleep.
“Exactly.”
“Wanted to make my parents believe I’m as straight as one can be. Thought they might buy it if I dated someone openly.”
“You would’ve still known what’s right,” Harry said grimly.
As Draco opened the huge, dark mahogany doors he noticed his parents were already sitting there on the opposite ends of the table. They were both wearing completely black dress robes, the ones they usually wore only in funerals. The table was full of Draco’s favourite pastries and sweets, and there was a delicious-looking cream cake decorated with strawberries and blackcurrants. There were Draco’s favourite flowers, dark blue cloves, all over the room, and even the curtains had been changed to the dark blue ones to match with the flowers. Right in the middle of the table, there was a lighted one, white candle beside a framed picture. Draco started to walk slowly towards the table to be able to see better the picture, and when he realized what there was in it, he came to a sudden halt.
“A boat.”
“Yeah, I know. But it wasn’t easy, you know. There were quite many who came to the tryout, so the level was really high. I’ve no idea how I actually did it. It’s so great to play together, Harry! We’re so going to crash Slytherin this year!” Ron continued, babbling happily.
Zabini didn’t say anything, he just grinned widely and winked at Harry and Malfoy.
“Hm, I definitely wouldn’t oppose,” Draco murmured, drowning in the kiss.
“Um, I don’t want to be rude or anything, but if you’re talking about the Dursleys, I don’t doubt you a second,” Ron said. “I mean, you can’t really compare the Dursleys and Malfoy’s family. Malfoy’s parents have always given him everything he has ever wanted and, well, even loved him in their own twisted way.”
to leave them. Because, after all, he did love his mother and father.
“Let’s go then,” Harry said, breaking the kiss and taking Draco’s hand in his. “We should try to find Remus or McGonagall or –”
from me,” Harry said surprisingly confidently.
Draco and Narcissa looked at each other in the eye for a moment, as if they were having a wordless conversation. “I don’t know if it’ll work, but yes, I promise to consider your words.”
“It’s sick. I mean, the whole tradition is disgusting, but I can’t say I’d be too surprised Lucius Malfoy wouldn’t hesitate to use it,” Ron said. “No matter how much of a git Malfoy is, no one deserves to be treated like that.”
Harry took it and let Ron pull him up.
“But it kind of does, don’t you see?” Draco asked, laughing hollowly. “I don’t think you can save me from this. You can’t save everyone.”
Harry gulped. Well, he hadn’t definitely been ready for that. To be honest, he couldn’t remember Draco being this open about what there was going on in his mind ever before, not even during their time together.
Soon they were a mess of tongues and lips and limbs entwined with each other. Harry could feel Draco’s chest hard against his and both of their hearts hammering wildly. Their touches had become bolder as they were now groping each other everywhere they could reach. Harry’s hands found Draco’s arse and, oh, he hadn’t known someone’s arse could feel so good and how squeezing it would make them both groan and move even closer to each other.
“Yeah, right, if you say so,” Harry said, the corners of his mouth tugging slightly.
Draco sighed. “Harry was doing something in Umbridge’s office, and a bunch of Gryffindors and Loony Lovegood were standing guard and they got all caught. Umbridge went somewhere, I don’t know where, with Harry and Granger, and I let the others go. Haven’t seen any of them since then.”
“Like my grandparents did when Sirius left his family?”
“You don’t fancy the idea of having Occlumency lessons with Snape?” Ginny asked, cutting Harry off.
“I might’ve kissed someone. Accidentally,” Harry blurted out and flushed.
“Well –”
They didn’t make it higher than a couple of steps, though, before Draco could no longer put any weight at all on his feet. Potter was probably about to offer to carry him up the stairs, but as he noticed the threatening look on Draco’s face, he decided to Apparate them instead straight into the room that was apparently supposed to be Draco’s bedroom, even though they both knew very well Apparating wouldn’t be a good solution in Draco’s current state.
“Fuck you, Potter. Get the hell away from me,” Malfoy said, voice trembling.
Draco hesitated, glancing at Harry with eyes that were storming with anxiety and fear.
“Well, well, how am I not surprised to find
“We’ll make sure no one comes to disturb you,” Blaise promised.

are the abnormal ones, freaks, and they’re the normal ones and better than us.”
“You should’ve bought phones for you and Michael, too,” Harry said, grinning.
“Really? Even though her only significant move during the whole War was to show her loyalty to our side at the end in order to save you?” Potter said, crossing his arms. “Besides, I didn't mean that. Even you can’t be so naive and think that the current Ministry would stop killing people when you’re dead. Once they’ve gotten you out of the way, they’ll start digging out everyone who has ever had anything to do with Voldemort or the Death Eaters. They want to get rid of the War memories completely, and I’d bet your mother is the next one in the queue.”
Ginny shrugged. “It didn’t feel like a big thing. It wasn’t a match made in heaven, anyway.”
Blaise sighed heavily. “Of course you didn’t. You know, if you weren’t such a hot-headed git sometimes, you’d know by now the exact reason for why he took it. Didn’t you think at all that maybe he was forced to take the Mark? Maybe the Dark Lord and other Death Eaters might be blackmailing him?”
“I know. Believe me, I didn’t imagine this to go like this, either,” Draco said. “And I’d really appreciate it if you at least tried to listen to me in future.”
Harry woke up with a start. He and Draco had apparently dozed off for X amount of time. Blaise and Ginny had already disappeared, and Harry’s body was aching and stiff all over. He looked at Draco who was still sleeping peacefully, his head resting on Harry’s shoulder, and Harry felt like his heart was melting at the sight. He lowered Draco’s body gently to a lying position on the couch, snaked to lay down behind him, and pulled him tightly against his own body.
Harry winced. “Just don’t call her the Weasley girl. It’ll go more smoothly if you don’t.”
Slowly, Draco turned to face the house-elf as well, and Dobby’s eyes became huge of astound. “Young master Malfoy!” Dobby cried out and bowed so deep his nose touched the floor.
“Why what?”
“We weren’t shagging,” Harry muttered, blushing. “Not every time.”
like during the War, he had only sensed how it had
But without you, there would be only walls
“I already told you you’ve got nothing to worry about,” Harry muttered. “So, we’re okay then?”
” Potter answered, sounding uneasy.
They fell soon into silence, both concentrating on their own tasks. Harry couldn’t help glancing at Malfoy from time to time, studying the Slytherin now that they sat so near one another. He noticed that Malfoy was still seemingly stiff and the Slytherin’s shoulders were high up. Though that didn’t apparently affect Malfoy’s potions skills because their potion looked precisely as it was supposed to look at this point. Gradually, Malfoy’s shoulders lowered and the frown between his eyebrows eased. Harry was surprised to remark how much easiness soothed Malfoy’s sharp features. One could say Malfoy looked even kind of benevolent then. Harry wondered how much more it’d soothe Malfoy’s features if he just let his white-blonde hair fall loosely around his face. Maybe his hair had even waves.
“I don’t know what to say to make it better. I wish I could take back what I said earlier today. And, well, during all the previous years, too,” Draco said, looking pained and honest at the same time. “I don’t even know where your boundaries are. Thought honestly I wasn’t doing anything that wasn’t okay. Not until you took this up.”
“Sirius really seemed to like your mother. Sounded like he was really regretting they had lost the contact.”
Harry glared at him. “This is water.”
As Harry had guessed, Hermione and Ron had interrogated him about his last night’s whereabouts as soon as Harry had stepped into the common room. To Harry’s surprise, they seemed to buy Harry’s explanation of him going late to bed and waking up early as both Ron and Hermione had, apparently, gone to sleep before midnight. And once Ron fell asleep, not even a pack of wild Hippogriffs running through their dorm would make him wake up. Harry had sighed of relief, although he knew he should be much more careful in future if he wanted to make the thing between him and Draco work out.
“That’s not true,” Harry said gently, tucking a strand of Draco’s hair behind his ear. “Everyone here knows why you had to do what you did. No one thinks you’d be a bad person.”
I hope this chapter has opened up a bit my reasoning behind Draco’s decision, why I don’t find it too difficult or unrealistic to forgive him and why I think he had no other option at the end of the sixth year. I've tried to be as mindful of mental health issues as I can, which is why I didn't want to make this process happen too fast and didn't want to require Draco to have had the strength to leave his family too early with too little support. In the end, I see this as a story of growing up, breaking slowly free from one’s toxic background, forgiveness, and learning one's boundaries.
“Thanks, Ginny. This is really beautiful,” Harry said amazed as he started wrapping the other phone.
“If by the family you mean same blood, then yes, but I don’t see the family that way. Hard to see them as my family as they’ve nothing but despised and hated me for my whole life.”
“Come with me, I’ve got a place where I can hide you. If you escape now, it’d draw the Ministry’s attention elsewhere, and they wouldn’t have the time or the energy to start planning how to continue executions.”
Draco gulped as if trying to block emotions from coming out. “Okay,” he said in a hoarse voice.
It hurt Draco so much to see Harry so heartbroken and lost, even though he had no idea what had happened. Draco had never been a very altruistic person, but now, if he could, he would’ve taken some of Harry’s pain to himself without hesitating. Maybe even all of it, just to be able to see Harry being happy and carefree again.
“It didn’t have anything to do with dignity. You know why he didn’t want to be there,” Draco said gloomily.
“Don’t lie to me!” Harry was yelling now. He felt like his eyes were burning, as if he was on the verge of tears. “How could you do this?”
There was no answer.
“I know,” Draco said and sighed. “I need to think this over, it’s not like I’d be able to change my opinions overnight. But I promise I’ll think about what you’ve told me today.”
Neither of them said anything as Malfoy stood up. He started to pace back towards the castle but stopped soon and turned around abruptly.
“Yeah,” Harry muttered as he continued eating.
Harry rolled his eyes but refrained from saying anything else. He was bursting to tell Ron and Hermione how they were wrong, how Draco actually had the Dark Mark imprinted on his skin and how he had been on Voldemort’s side all along. But he couldn’t tell, at least not yet. His head was so full of thoughts he hadn’t had time to register yet, and he wanted to get them in order by himself first. Besides, he knew that
“I know. I only said so because I was more worried about losing you. I never said there wouldn’t be any risk, and I’m alright with that, I really am. Besides, there’s nothing we could do about it anymore, you’ve already got your memories of me,” Draco said.
“What? Don’t even Weasel and the Mud –”
“The most difficult thing here is that there usually is a lot of love in these groups; your family and friends may love you for real but the love they give you is completely dependent on how you act. If you follow the rules, traditions, and beliefs, you’re loved. If you don’t, you may be shut out.”
“Hi,” Harry said stiffly after a moment, still standing by the door.
of being able to do so, and when Harry pulled him into his arms whenever Draco was feeling anxious and broken. In Harry’s words when Harry told Draco how much he cared and loved, and how he kept telling Draco over and over again how he would want to listen to him when he was feeling like his world was falling apart. And in Harry’s way to show how much he wanted to be a permanent part of Draco’s life, wanting to get to know his friends and let Draco meet his, inviting Draco to family dinners to the Burrow, and talking about moving in together some day in future and adopting lots of cats or bunnies.
As soon as he was out of the wards, Draco Apparated to London, to a place somewhere nearby the Ministry entrance.
There was a small, brown owl hovering behind the window and carrying the Sunday’s Daily Prophet in its claws, looking at three of them curiously and hooting at them innocently.
“Well, that explains the empty look on your face, you have it quite often, you know – hey!” Ginny snickered until Harry pinched her arm.
“So, what’re you going to do with your parents then?”
“I’ve almost killed two people!” Draco exclaimed desperately, making Harry inhale sharply. There was no way to go around this, not anymore. Harry felt like his mind was suddenly whirling as thoughts and images about Draco’s behaviour during the whole year filled his head. The worst of all was that Harry knew he had known the whole time, ever since the cursed necklace. He had just managed to be so stubborn and seen only what he had wanted to see.
“I reckon it isn’t,” Harry said a bit gloomily. He knew there was no reason to avoid talking about Sirius as he couldn’t be exposed anymore, but Harry still didn’t like the idea of everybody knowing. “Thank you,” he said, turning his eyes to Blaise.
Going out was, indeed, a great idea. Even though the air wasn’t as clean in London as it was in Scotland, it still felt good to breathe the brisk December air. The coolness made Harry’s senses wake up, and he felt like he could snap out of his head, at least a little bit.
“That’s not true,” Harry said. “There’s no guidebook to the situation you were in. But you’ve survived and you’re here now. It’s all that really matters.”
“Yes,” Draco said sullenly. “Didn’t know how to tell you. I knew how you’d react, I honestly thought I had lost you.”
Suddenly, Draco cut Harry off by wrapping his arms tightly around Harry’s waist and pulling him into a frantic, desperate kiss.
“I’m of age, it’s not such a big crime,” Harry said, grinning. “So, are you coming?”
“Of course. Harry here has told us a lot about different Muggle contraptions.”
Harry didn’t do it only because he was curious. He knew he was that, too, but the main reason why he started following Draco was Harry’s increasing worry for him. After Katie Bell’s incident, Draco had started to become more and more distant and anxious every time Harry saw him. He hardly ate anymore, he had gotten dark shadows under his eyes, he skipped classes, and every time he managed actually to go to classes, to the library or just walk in the corridors, he had a glazed and lost look in his eyes. It wasn’t any better when Harry and Draco met in private. On better days, Draco was gloomy and unresponsive, although he was present at least on some level, whereas on worse days, Draco seemed to be completely out of reach, not hearing Harry talking to him nor reacting when Harry touched him. Those days made Harry feel horrified and utterly useless, and no matter what he tried, he wasn’t able to coax Draco out of his grim reality Harry knew nothing of.
“Well, I’m sure I would’ve left my family,” Harry said straightforward.
Zabini sighed. “I had assumed you might be a bit obtuse based on Potions classes, but I didn’t know if it was only Potions or the outside world as well.”
“Er, there’s no Coke or something?” Harry asked, looking suspiciously at the brown liquid.
Right after it, it hadn’t felt so funny, though. Harry had had a hard time concentrating on the classes after lunch, and his friends had been shooting worried glances at him the whole afternoon. However, by dinner time, he had finally felt almost like himself as the excitement of seeing Draco in the evening had hit him, making butterflies fly all around in his stomach. He had even been able to laugh genuinely and take part in the conversation at the Gryffindor table, which had made at least Hermione look relieved.
“Oh, and Ginny. The first time we were all hanging out together she looked at me like she was sure I had cursed or poisoned you,” Draco said, laughing now against Harry’s shoulder.
“Oh, yes. Hit me with the nice, old Bat-Boogey Hex right before leaving,” Draco muttered.
When Andromeda had gone, Harry felt suddenly a bit nervous and giddy sitting on the couch next to Draco. It felt like there was some kind of energy or magic flowing between them, making the tension feel thick in the air. Harry was so close to Draco, so close he could feel Draco’s body heat, so close he would have to move his hand only a few inches to be able to touch.
Harry took a few more steps towards Draco, offering his hand. “Truce?”
“Oh,” Harry said. To be honest, there had been so much occupying his mind he had forgotten all about the phones. “Yes, I have it in my coat pocket,” he said, patting his pocket to make sure it was still there.
“Like Ron’s family.”
Draco turned his gaze to the door, only to meet Harry Potter’s vividly green but tired-looking eyes. Harry had clearly been out flying as his cheeks were red and hair even messier than what it used to be normally.
“But his parents were on Voldemort’s side!” Harry snarled, indignant.
“I will, I promise. Good night, ‘Mione,” Harry said, getting up off the couch.
Draco blinked a couple of times. “Who in Salazar’s name was
Draco looked a little uneasy but shook his head again anyhow. “No. He’s never broken his promises to me. I trust him,” Draco said. “What did he say to you after I left?”
“No, you don’t really –” Harry started at the same time as Kreacher Disapparated from his bedroom with a loud bang, “have to,” he muttered into the empty room.
“Actually, I wanted to ask you, Harry, if you wanted to take a walk with me? I’ve been inside this rat hole the whole day,” Ginny said and grimaced as she realized how it must’ve sounded to Sirius. “Sorry,” she said, looking apologetically at him.
“Yes,” Harry said, confused.
The Slytherin just huffed without saying anything.
“Harry, I know you’re here,” Draco said, staring at the luggage rack, and Harry took his Cloak off and jumped down, right in front of Draco.
“No, god, no! Or, well, I don’t think so. He just kind of died in my arms so I had a lot of nightmares about him last summer,” Harry said, trying to explain. “My cousin heard me screaming and asked if Cedric’s my, erm, boyfriend, and that made me wonder why I enjoy watching pictures of Quidditch players and firefighters while I hardly noticed any girls.”
“’Mione’s right, Slytherins have never played fair,” Harry tried.
“And what exactly makes you interested in the pureblood culture all of a sudden?”
, his mind was pleading as he heard the steps approaching him. Harry decided to keep walking, maybe the git would get the message right.
“In the Room of Requirement.”
--*--*--*--*--
Draco grunted and fell into silence, staring at the lake.
Harry had no intention to stop or slow down, though, so instead, he sped up and turned sharp left, trying to elude Malfoy by misleading him.
“He hasn’t given you any orders?”
“Yes, yes, I know. What I mean is that learning to know both Blaise and Draco better has shown me how we only really see the tip of an iceberg of someone’s life and thoughts while there’s so much more under the surface we’ve got absolutely no idea of,” Hermione said.
“Let me know if I can help you. As a girl, I’ve some experience of how girls’ brains work.”
,” Ron mouthed to Harry, looking a bit guilty because of Hermione’s inquiry.
kind knows how to end a call.”
“Morning,” Potter said and stepped into the room. “Did you manage to get some sleep?” he sounded so mechanical, as if he had had to plan and practise exactly what he’d say to Draco and in which tone.
It was again one of those nights when Draco could not sleep. He was sweating and rolling hours around in bed, trying to make himself relax, but in vain. Finally, he gave up, sighing and pulling his wand from under the pillow to cast Tempus; it was only 3:23 am.
“Here,” Draco said, placing a cup on the sofa table in front of Harry, making Harry’s eyes snap open. “Oh, sorry, I didn’t realize you had fallen asleep,” he said as he sat back on the couch, a cup in his hands.
“It’s seven o’clock. Would Master like to have breakfast already? Or would Master like to still continue sleeping?”
“Then you must know what most of the pureblood families think about sexual preferences that don’t lead to producing offspring. I’m not talking about your family, nor even mine, but families like Draco’s… Let’s just say I want to be there for him,” Blaise said sincerely.
“McGonagall told me you’ve failed to do Transfiguration homework twice in a row. Why didn’t you tell me? I could’ve helped you,” Harry said, snaking his arms around Draco’s waist. There was something wrong, and Harry wanted desperately to know what.
Apparently, Draco was also feeling something as he had fallen into silence and had suddenly started breathing faster. Neither of them said anything as they didn’t seem to know how to be with each other when there was no third person with them.
At first, Harry spotted Ginny and Luna who were talking animatedly with some seventh-year girls Harry didn’t recognize. Feeling too tired to try to get to know new people, Harry continued scanning the room until his eyes fell on Ron and Hermione who were talking with Neville, Dean and Parvati.
“Yes,” Harry grunted, not bothering to get up.
Harry grimaced. “Wouldn’t really call them my family. They’re just people I’ve had to live with, we don’t really get along.”
“Could they make a product just for Malfoy? A candy that turns you into a ferret or something? Would be nice to let him experience that again as he seemed to appreciate it a lot last year,” Harry said, and both he and Ron turned their gazes to Malfoy, snickering.
“I have to… I’ve got to try. The Dark Lord’s going to kill me and –”
“It’s about Montague, they’ve found him, and Headmistress said she needs your help, Professor,” Draco said, looking at his shoes.
“What made you keep away?” Draco asked, looking at Andromeda curiously.
“Sorry, I didn’t come to think about that,” Harry muttered, taking a sip of his coffee.
“Maybe we should do something about it. It’s not fair the whole school is rather prejudiced towards one House. Even some of the teachers treat the Slytherins differently, and they’re the ones who’re supposed to be the adults here,” Hermione said, her eyes glinting the way they always did when she found injustice in the world and wanted to repair it.
“He was alright, he had actually been waiting for much worse.”
But Potter ignored Draco’s question and stared determinedly into the strange Auror’s eyes. “Show us a way out of here so that nobody sees us.”
“There are plenty of people who’re capable of kindness in the world, maybe you hadn’t just met them yet,” Harry said, shrugging and giving Draco a small smile. “So, what do you think?”
Harry felt like his hands started to sweat, the whole situation was so uncomfortable. “Er, something happened at the beginning of the fifth year, and –”
Suddenly, Draco heard someone knocking on the door cautiously.
“They’re going to figure it out,” Ginny said in a low voice.
“Yeah, well, at first I thought he’s just being smug because he knows something no one else does, but then again, he’s always been like that,” Draco said, shrugging.
“Enjoy your trip! Take good care of Draco in Norway,” Olivia said, smiling.
” Potter asked quickly.
“Some people used to believe their loved ones go to the Northern Lights after death. That they’re dancing there, all the pain from the earthly life forgotten.”
“I don’t –,” Harry started to object, but Snape cut him short.
If Harry had to find something positive out of the whole situation, at least he didn’t have to go to the Occlumency lessons anymore. Although he didn’t have a clue how he could survive the remaining Potions lessons from now on.
The contents of the basket were no disappointment this time, either, as they consisted of a pile of turkey sandwiches, a blueberry tart, homemade toffee candies and a few butterbeers. This time, though, there were no roses, to Harry’s relief.
Draco looked closely at the other boy. Potter had always been extremely bad at hiding his true feelings, and now that he radiated with honesty, courage, and faith in his own cause, it felt ridiculous to even think this could be some sort of a plot. Even if he could trust that Potter would help him out of Azkaban, leaving with the arrogant, infuriating, and nauseatingly benevolent Gryffindor seemed like the last option he would like to pick. Maybe Draco was already dead, maybe this was his own personal hell.
Harry looked at his friend, feeling flabbergasted. “But they can’t… This doesn’t… Oh, for fuck’s sake, I wasn’t ready to die for them so that they could start killing more people completely wantonly! The killing was supposed to end when the War ended!”
“Father,” Draco said, nonplussed. “What are you doing here? You were supposed to be in Azkaban.”
“Should’ve known, that meddling, little git,” Draco muttered.
“I’ve got a birthday present for you, I’ll give it to you when we get back to the castle,” Draco said. “And don’t even consider opening it before your actual birthday.”
“Draco?” Harry said gently, placing his hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Are you okay?”
“Er, okay. So take a swig now, then.”
“I figured you’d be here,” Draco said calmly. “Severus was fuming. What happened?”
Suddenly the Fat Lady’s portrait opened, and Ginny crawled hastily in through the hole. She was truly a walking reminder of the proximity of the upcoming summer holidays as she seemed to have more freckles on her face than ever before.
“Even after everything you’ve done,” Andromeda said and took a deep breath. “Besides, I think it’s partly my fault. I was an adult and I knew exactly how you were treated home by your parents and other people in the pureblood circles. I should’ve tried to contact you earlier, I should’ve tried to help you. But I did nothing, I just tried to explain myself it’d have been impossible to reach out to you, but I should’ve tried harder.”
“Jeg elsker deg,” Harry said back, and, to Harry’s surprise, his answer made Draco blush deeply.
Zabini’s eyes widened. “Of courses I remember him, your father went, aa, a little mad after that episode,” Zabini said, turning his eyes to Harry. “That, I must say, was a positively slytherin thing to do. Can’t believe you weren’t sorted into Slytherin.”
Harry gulped. “The next time?”
A sense of panic started to rise again. He should continue, he was so close now. But everything in his vision had suddenly started to become hazy and blurry, and he found it impossible to refocus his gaze, no matter how much he blinked his eyes.
Harry took a long breath in and opened the door slowly.
Harry snapped himself back to the present moment. “Sorry, having a bad day,” Harry murmured.
“You’re going to tell your lover about the kiss?”
“Yeah…?”
Grimmauld Place… It sounded somehow distantly familiar.
Draco startled as he heard steps somewhere nearby. He had apparently dozed off to a restless sleep at some point, and now his body was stiff like a stock and shivering because of the coldness of the floor.
“Hi,” Draco managed to say with a hoarse voice.
“What do you mean?” Harry asked, confused.
“Oh my god,” Harry muttered.
“I couldn’t let you miss this. Dobby was extremely proud of his treacle tart, you know,” Draco said as he kept on feeding Harry.
“Yes, well, it makes things easier as all of you guys have suddenly started to hang out with him,” Harry said, shrugging and acting nonchalance.
“Why wouldn’t they?”
“No, sorry,” Harry said, feeling a bit guilty.
Not that he would’ve kissed her back, either. He had been so surprised he had kind of frozen to the spot as all the thoughts had left his mind, and, well. He was well aware he should’ve said something, but crying girls tended to make him nervous as he had no idea how to behave around them.
Huh, this chapter was pretty exciting to write :D It's been a lot of fun to read your thoughts about how this might be going because for some reason I thought it would be easy to guess (everything seems always so simple and logical in one's own head... or not really). Anyway, now things seem rather bad but there's still quite a long way ahead.
(See the end of the chapter for
Herregud, min elskede, du er utrolig = Oh my god, my love, you're unbelievable
“What’s wrong with you?” Malfoy asked, putting his hand on Harry’s shoulder, and making him stop.
“No, there’s no god to worship, but the system is still very reminiscent of conservative religious groups, especially of sects. For one, it’s a group that teaches you certain beliefs you have to believe to be able to stay as a member of the group. Those beliefs include usually thoughts about your own group being better than the others, how other people outside of your group are a threat to your group’s existence, and how it’s preferable to marry someone in the same group and have children with them to keep the group pure. You’re following me?” Hermione asked, waiting for Harry to nod before going on. “There are also a lot of strict rules and traditions you have to follow or you may be shut out as a punishment. Those groups are usually really exclusive, which means they don’t want people outside of the group to intervene and people inside the group don’t tend to have many connections to the people outside of the group.”
The things between Harry and Draco didn’t change a lot after their truce as they still didn’t talk much to each other apart from an occasional ‘hi’ whenever they bumped into one another in the common room. However, Harry could still sense there was definitely
“Potter!” Malfoy’s voice echoed on the otherwise deserted corridor.
“What do you mean? But they’re your family from your mother’s side, right?” Draco asked, perplexed.
“And Ginny, she loves Teddy,” Draco said. “Merlin, will I have to stand to see him redheaded the whole Christmas?” he continued, whining.
Draco looked at the Gryffindor, incredulous. He, in a support group with
“I didn’t come here to yell at you if you’re worried about that,” Harry said, sighing. “I’m sorry I didn’t listen to you. I know now I acted like a dick.”
Harry walked through the castle towards the dungeons, barely paying any attention to happily chatting students who passed by him. It had become a habit of sorts to him to at least try to clear his mind right before every session, though he knew he wasn’t succeeding in that very well. It felt like every session went only worse and worse the more the time passed, and Harry didn’t want to speculate how this session would go as his mind was already a big mess even before starting.
“Ron, please, take this seriously,” Hermione said, rolling her eyes.
“Don’t rise,” Hermione murmured warningly to both Harry and Ron.
“Ouch! That was a bit unnecessary,” Ron said sourly. “But, yes, I do think so, too, mate. Just go and get your prince now.”
“Look at me when I’m talking to you!” Malfoy shouted and grabbed Harry’s arms pushing him harshly against the wall and pinning him there with his body weight.
Harry did realize now as Malfoy, Zabini and Hermione had all tried to tell him it in different ways. He just found it utterly difficult to believe, it felt so wrong.
“Still arguing about the trial?” Ginny asked, panting a little as she leaned her broom against a tree, sat down next to Harry and poured herself a glass of strawberry juice.
Harry handed now the letter to Ginny and took back the ring. It really wasn’t anything Harry would usually like. It was big, looked all too fancy and expensive and it had the Black crest on it. But the idea of having something that had belonged, or at least would’ve belonged, to Sirius, made him feel warm inside. He didn’t have much left from him and now he had something he could carry with him all the time.
“You really think so?” Harry asked, hesitating.
enough. What if they would like to ask some clarifying questions? They won’t get the answers from a piece of paper.”
“Just stay on Earth, please,” Draco mumbled into Harry’s mouth.
“What do you want?” Harry seethed, snapping his arm away.
Despite the bitter tone in Malfoy’s voice, Harry felt his own heart starting to flutter in his chest. “Sounds remotely familiar. Hermione said she figured me out before I even had a clue.”
“Look, we don’t have to fight against each other. And when the war is over, it’s going to get so much easier.”
“So why don’t people just leave? It’s not real love if it’s dependent on how you act,” Harry said, somewhat irritated.
“Oh,” Hermione said, seemingly surprised.
Ginny sighed heavily. “I know, that was a bad comparison. But I still meant the rest of what I said. The Mark doesn’t define him, he’s much more than that.”
“Yes, she mentioned it. She didn’t tell me you’ve started going there, though.”
I could make a beautiful song
“Please, Harry, of course I’m not –” Draco began.
“You know, you can be a bit scary sometimes,” Harry said as they walked down the stairs.
, and we’ve been together for one year now.”
“No, of course not,” Harry said, turning his eyes to Andromeda’s hazel-brown ones. “I just don’t understand. You don’t know him at all. Are you sure you can trust him?”
“Yeah, I had noticed that. I just thought it was one-sided,” Hermione said pensively. “Harry, is everything alright?” she asked when she noticed Harry had gone tense and started clenching his fists.
As midnight approached, Harry noticed himself getting a bit restless. He had been curious about Draco’s gift, and the more time passed, the more impatient he became. It’d be okay to open the gift now, right? Harry decided to make his excuses and headed quickly to his room, snatched the slytherin green gift from under his bed and opened it.
“So, it’s true then? She kissed you?” Ginny asked, trying to catch her breath.
“That’s not the same.”
“Not endlessly. What do you think the Wizarding World will think when they get to know that their favourite hero has helped a notorious Death Eater to escape?”
What is this feeling
. The thing they had had before the War and that was now still in a sort of dormant state, hovering between them as a pressing, grey cloud that was just about to rain or storm. Harry just didn’t feel like he was ready to even discuss that…
“Oh, you’ve got the picture with you, Harry? Could I see it?” Ginny asked, excited, after Draco had told them about the Christmas gift he had given to Harry.
“Let me remind you it was actually
“Did you even consider Draco might’ve had some other reason to take the Mark than choosing his side?”
As Harry was falling back to sleep, he started to recall the reasons that had caused him the hangover. He could vaguely remember coming back to the common room after dinner, and there had been some sort of a party. Seamus had persuaded him to drink… vodka? Or rum? He couldn’t quite remember which one. Or had it been tequila? Anyway, Harry had a feeling he hadn’t really liked being at the party that much at first, but after a couple of drinks, he had definitely started to enjoy himself. He could remember the light and happy atmosphere when he had been talking, joking, and laughing with his friends, the War and death forgotten at least for a little while.
“Harry, look at me,” Sirius said as he placed his hands on Harry’s shoulders. “You’re not an evil person, nor will you ever become one. Some trivial similarities between you and Voldemort don’t tell who you are nor define your future. It’s our actions and choices that make us who we are. And the people who we gather around us. You see all your friends, all the people you have in your life? They’re all good people, and so are you,” Sirius stated firmly.
“You do. You could stay with me.”
“Oh, tell me, Harry! Who’s the lucky girl to win the Chosen One’s heart?” Ginny asked excitedly, looping her arm through Harry’s.
“Yeah, well, Dobby has. He told me he has just a perfect place in mind. He promised to show it to me today.”
Hermione let out a strangled voice and pulled Harry into a hug. Neither of them said anything for a long while as they sat still, Hermione sobbing on Harry’s shoulder and Harry patting her head a bit clumsily.
Anyway, I hope you’ve enjoyed this story. I didn’t think anyone would actually read the whole story, so I feel a bit, dunno, surprised or somerhing that there actually are people who’ve read this. It has meant a lot to me. Thank you so, so much for reading and leaving kudos and so lovely and encouraging comments along the way, they’ve always brightened my day and made me smile.
“Draco,” Harry said again, this time breaking the kiss gently. “I need to go.”
“I’m feeling much better already. I’ve caught up with some homework and planned a bit our next DA meeting. Thought we could practise Protego then.”
Draco turned so he could see Harry’s face. “No, darling, it’s not. It just shows how important your parents were – your parents
This chapter/plot twist is highly inspired by two books:
anymore.
That night, Harry had trouble falling asleep. When he and Ron had headed to their shared bedroom around midnight, Ron had started snoring almost immediately, while Harry had rolled around his bed for hours before finally giving up. His head was buzzing with thoughts so quickly he couldn’t even grasp hold of one of them to put it into words.
And then happened something Harry hadn’t been able to foresee even in his wildest theories.
“Not so fast, min elskede,” Draco said, taking Harry’s hand, glancing around them to make sure there were no spectators around, and pulling Harry into an alcove that was hidden in an empty corridor next to the staircase. “We haven’t tested this one yet,” he murmured, pushing Harry against the wall and pinning him there with his body.
“Potter,” Blaise said as both he and Ginny sat down on Ron’s bed. “Why is Draco being all miserable and sulking in our room?”
“How should I know,” Ginny said, shrugging. “I think some people find it easier, especially if you’re confessing your feelings for the first time.”
He had to get rid of it.
Harry looked Sirius in the eye, feeling a bit uncertain. “Are you sure?”
Harry considered Hermione for a moment, looking at her brown, glinting eyes. “Fine, try me.”
--*--*--*--*--
“I love you,” Harry whispered and kissed the nape of Draco’s neck before falling back to sleep.
To Harry’s relief, Ginny dropped the topic.
“Harry,” Ginny said tentatively, knocking on Harry’s door. “May I come in?”
Before you start reading this chapter, I want to warn you that everyone who died in the books is going to die in this story too. You might guess what’s coming next.
For the rest of the journey, they walked talking about lighter subjects from the Gryffindor Quidditch team to the next DA meetings. Once they arrived at Grimmauld Place, Ginny rushed immediately to her room to start with the packing meanwhile Harry started to look for Sirius as he had promised to still talk properly with him before leaving.
to have some sort of an ulterior motive behind all this fuss, it didn’t make any sense otherwise. They had never even liked Draco. Not that he had ever tried to exactly please them, which made the whole thing seem even more absurd to him.
Harry hesitated. He had already shared his fear of being possessed by Voldemort with Ginny and Hermione, but it was still bothering him so much he felt like having something itching under his skin and he couldn’t just get rid of the feeling. “I just… What if Voldemort can control me? And I just haven’t realized it yet. Nobody has.”
“I don’t get a word you’re saying, Potter,” Draco said, glaring at the book as if it had insulted him somehow. “What’s a police officer?” he asked, watching a picture of a man and a woman in their blue uniforms.
Ginny was silent for a moment. “I’m not,” she said curtly after a while. “I’m merely stating what I’ve seen.”
“And leave my family?” Draco asked, incredulous.
Harry had now a clue about how hard this was for Draco, so he really didn’t want to upset him. Harry wasn’t too excited about telling anyone, either, let alone letting the Prophet know. And he meant what he said, he
“Yes. I saw how you hesitated and lowered your wand,” Harry said determinedly. “You didn’t kill Dumbledore. I know you never would have killed him. You are not a murderer.”
“Don’t you dare to touch me like that anymore,” Malfoy snarled and strode hastily back to his Slytherin friends.
“Wouldn’t even cross my mind,” Harry said and licked a freshly fallen snowflake off Draco’s cheek.
“As if he’d care about that,” Draco said, laughing hollowly. “He wanted someone inside Hogwarts, probably to spy on Dumbledore or something,” he said, shrugging.
, the only son of Narcissa of the noble House Black?” Kreacher asked, his eyes widening in awe.
“Stop it! Stop it!” Draco cried, laughing, too, and trying to get the snitch as far from Harry as possible.
“What did you expect me to do? To leave him there?” Andromeda snapped, incredulous.
“Tell me if you need anything. And you can ask Kreacher for whatever you want,” Potter said, sounding a bit awkward now that they were no longer in an acute danger.
"Exactly," Ginny snapped. “You should talk to him,” she continued more softly, looking Harry in the eye.
“Did he now?” Draco asked, cocking an eyebrow.
?” Ginny cried, nonplussed, and Draco told Ginny and Blaise the whole story about Sirius and Narcissa meeting occasionally in secret.
--*--*--*--*--
Harry remained still seated, looking at Draco uncertainly. As their eyes met, Harry could see Draco was probably sharing his feelings as he tugged the sleeve of his old Slytherin team’s Quidditch shirt nervously, his whole posture stiffening all of a sudden.
“I see,” Ginny said with an inscrutable look on her face as she sat down on one of the armchairs.
“And he kind of kissed me once,” Harry said, feeling himself turning crimson again.
“You’re not going to tell my parents?” Draco asked Snape, looking desperate.
“It just keeps the cut clean and helps it to heal. And now I can’t smudge everything with my blood.”
Soon an intense stab of pain pierced Draco's arm, spreading instantly all over his body. But despite the pain, Draco felt oddly relieved. As if the invisible hand had disappeared, and he was finally able to breathe again.
“Extinguish fires,” Harry said, shrugging. “The thing is, most of them are men, though there are some women as well, especially nowadays, and they have a tradition to make calendars with pictures. To raise money or something.”
Then there were some who didn’t even bother to try to hide their glares. Harry could feel a lot of Gryffindors looking at him and Ginny highly disapprovingly, as if they were some sort of turncoats as they dared to sit with Slytherins at the Slytherin table, let alone
“God, no Ron,” Harry said, blushing and covering his face with his hands.
And soon he could get out of this weak, gaunt, and sick body. Maybe he could see Vince and Greg and be able to tell them how sorry he was for their deaths. Maybe he could get to his mother and father. Maybe they could be together again, the whole family.
“Alright, so I’ll take care of stirring then,” Malfoy said.
“You two cannot be serious,” Blaise Zabini said, laughing so hard he was about to fall from the armchair he was sitting on in the Room of Requirement.
“No problem at all, glad you finally got your Prince Charming,” Zabini said, grinning. “Well, I’m off now. It was a pleasure to chat with you. Draco. Potter,” Zabini said and left Harry and Malfoy.
Ron just ogled at Harry, dumbfounded. “But… Is this a joke?”
Harry watched Ginny leave, her long hair waving wildly as she walked away. Harry felt lighter than for a long time.
“Yes. Let’s just go and sit –” Harry began, looking around. “— over there,” he continued, pointing at a bench that was hidden behind some bushes and therefore quite well out of sight.
--*--*--*--*--
“Don’t,” Harry blurted out without thinking. “I mean, it looks nice on you. You know, as it’s, er, slightly longer and wavier and as you let it hang freely,” he tried to explain, blushing horribly, and feeling like he was just digging his own grave. “Um, nice like objectively speaking,” he added, muttering.
“I don’t think he’s really sulking about the doomsday, why would the doomsday be something to sulk about? It’s not necessarily a bad day,” Luna commented airily with her feeble voice, peeking from behind her Quibbler.
“Yes, p-please,” Draco said, voice trembling.
“Harry, please, just listen –”
“Snogging in an alcove.”
wished for Malfoy to die.
“He wasn’t supposed to drink that,” Draco muttered as if talking to himself now. “It’s all gone wrong.”
“Yeah, right, you’ve just randomly happened to kiss me, what, three or four times now?” Harry said furiously. “Look, I don’t want any harm to you. I just want an honest answer.”
When Harry had finished reading the note, he found himself smiling widely. Draco’s gift had been somehow so… Draco-ish. Posh and expensive but still having Harry in mind. Harry placed the gloves and chocolate pralines back under his bed and was just about to throw away the wrapping papers when he noticed something falling from them.
Harry tried to smile back at Ginny, but his smile didn’t really reach his eyes.
“I’m just teasing you, darling,” Anne said, smiling sweetly at Draco.
“It was horrible what they did to you, or rather what they’ve done to you for your whole life, but it’s still only natural to miss them,” Andromeda said. “I missed my parents and sisters horribly when I left. I knew I couldn’t go back because they didn’t accept me, my values nor my choice of husband, but it didn’t stop me from thinking if I had made the right decision or not. A few times I actually considered going back for real.”
“You did?”
“Come with me,” Harry said, raising his Cloak to invite Draco under it.
“So, how did your day go, Harry? Are you still feeling sick?” Hermione asked and put her palm on Harry’s forehead. “At least you don’t have a fever.”
“Pounds.”
The last day of June was definitely one of the worst days Draco had ever had. Maybe even the worst along with the day he had been forced to take the Dark Mark. He had known all along this day would come inevitably but he had still, maybe even a bit childishly, stuck to the hope that someone would save him. But no one had been able to do that, not even Harry or Dumbledore. Both of them had tried, making it sound so light and easy as they had repeated ‘let’s go and see Dumbledore, he can solve this’ and ‘come to the right side, Draco, we can save you and your family’. It had sounded so good, so tempting, and Draco had almost started to believe them. Almost. Because in the end, Draco knew there simply was no way to escape and hide from the Dark Lord, especially not as his mother was at the Manor full of Death Eaters and his father in Azkaban that hadn’t been under the real authority of the Ministry for a long time.
så se på mig för jag ska aldrig, aldrig dö.
Harry burst out laughing. “Exactly like a broken record. Jesus, you’re a fast learner.”
“Hermione said the same.”
Draco took a deep breath once more, snatched the wand that had just been returned to him out of his pocket and Apparated to the Manor gates. The wards recognized him immediately and let him in through the old, squeaky gate. Draco was actually rather happy the day he got to go back to the Manor was a warm and sunny summer day as not even the Manor could appear too threatening when it was so light, the birds were singing all around the place, and different kinds of flowers in all the possible colours blossomed and filled the air with both delicate and exotic scents.
“Talk to me before kissing me? You had planned to
“Ah, but Draco, is this how you greet your father? I’ve certainly taught you better than this,” Lucius said, clicking his tongue disapprovingly. “Did you honestly believe the Dark Lord would have left us there? I’ve been out for days now. And as for what I’m doing here…,” he said, giving Harry a cold and calculating look. “I came to ensure my son doesn’t do anything… imprudent.”
“What?” Harry asked, perplexed.
“Maybe they should. I don’t think I’m a good person, Harry. You know that,” Draco said gloomily.
“What do you mean?” Potter asked, narrowing his eyes.

“The thing is, pureblood culture is still a little… old-fashioned. Homosexuality simply doesn’t exist, that’s what all the pureblood children get to learn as fast as they learn to understand speech. When it comes to Draco’s family, Draco has huge pressure on his shoulders as the only son and heir of the Malfoy name. He is scared of his family abandoning him if he doesn’t meet his parents’ expectations. That, I’d assume, is the main reason his behaviour towards you has been quite hostile earlier and now rather contradictory. He has tried to hide his feelings even from himself by distancing himself from you, but I don’t think he can do it anymore. And I sure hope he can’t go on like this, otherwise, he’s going to destroy himself in the end. It’s not healthy to pretend to be something you’re not.”
“After months of hiding, it doesn’t feel that new and exhilarating anymore.”
Harry was quiet for a while, feeling lost of words. “I’m sorry,” he said finally in a low voice, and as he couldn’t come up with anything comforting to say, he decided to wrap his arm around Draco and pull him closer.
,” Ron had said.
“They just think you’re an easy target because you are new in the team,”, Hermione said glancing at Harry and trying to get his support.
“But there’s more,” Harry said insistently, ignoring what Hermione had just said. “I followed Malfoy and Snape when they left from the party –”
“Oh,” Harry said, surprised. He was feeling a bit embarrassed about how little he remembered about religions. Of course, he knew some basics from the Muggle news and the primary school he had attended before starting at Hogwarts, but it wasn’t a lot. Besides, no one around him had been particularly religious, so he didn’t have any personal experience either.
the teachers were trying to sneak a glance at them discreetly, although all of them were failing quite terribly at the ‘being discreet’ part.
In addition to struggling with the constant hunger, the inevitable bodily changes were also telling Draco how the time was moving forward. He knew he had always been somewhat thin and bony, but the lack of food had made his body slowly wilt and his strength weaken so much he could hardly stand on his own feet anymore. Thank Merlin there was no mirror in his cell, so he luckily couldn’t see his own, changed appearance, but he still could imagine it wouldn’t be a beautiful sight. After just a couple of weeks in prison, Draco had begun to notice how his bones seemed to pierce more and more clearly through the skin, how his cheeks became more and more sunken, and how the thick, silvery-blonde hair he had always loved had started to feel thinner and thinner every time he ran his hand through his hair.
Hermione looked disappointedly at both of them and huffed. “Malfoy is a git, but it doesn’t mean you should lower yourselves onto the same level. Especially you, Harry. You know he’s a prefect now and wants to get you into troubles.”
And now Draco was running desperately and almost panicking all around the castle, trying to find Harry or at least someone he could ask about him. But no, everyone they had caught with Umbridge had disappeared, as if the world had swallowed them up. Umbridge seemed to be gone, too, not that Draco would’ve cared much about her unless he could get some information about Harry’s location from her.
,” Granger snapped warningly.
Hermione closed her book and her eyes started to gleam, which, Harry knew, meant she was enthusiastic about the subject on some level. “That’s really an interesting question, I’ve wondered it a lot as well,” she said thoughtfully. “At first you have to make it clear to yourself that being a pureblood doesn’t mean you’re just like all the other purebloods. Some of the purebloods might be rather fanatic about the blood, old pureblood traditions and protecting ‘our kind’”, Hermione explained, saying the last part a bit disdainfully. “Meanwhile the others might not care for the traditions nor believe in blood purity at all.”
“Here you go,” Molly said, placing a cup of steaming tea in front of Harry as she sat down opposite him.
“Merlin, Potter, stop sneaking around like that,” Draco said, startling a little. “Sit down, it’s your turn to hold this beast.”
“If you want to do that, you do that. It won’t probably be the easiest way, though,” Andromeda said. “Anyway, it doesn’t matter what I or your friends suggest you do, you’ve got to listen to yourself and do only things you’re comfortable with, at a pace that feels right for you.”
Granger sighed and looked at Draco seriously. “I think so, but he’s going to need some time. Too many close people to him have left, he has lost so much during the past few years.”
When the school started again, Harry felt somewhat lighter than before leaving for the holidays. The whole autumn had been so stressful he hadn’t apparently even realized how much he had needed to have a short break from his life at Hogwarts. Seeing Draco doing fine again after the holidays was a huge relief, of course, and even the ordinary classes were fine, some of them actually even something to look forward to as all the sixth-years were finally introduced to Apparition. However, the lighter feeling didn’t remain for long as soon Harry noticed that Draco seemed to be sinking back into the gloominess, and this time Harry was slowly but surely following him. Blaise and Ginny tried persistently to come up with something normal and lighter to do with Harry and Draco, such as gossiping about the teachers and fellow students, doing homework together or having picnics and game nights, but it seemed to be a mission impossible to make either of them react with anything else than occasional grunts. During the nights Harry and Draco shared together, they didn’t usually say a word, but feeling the other’s body and hearing the other’s breathing gave a little bit of comfort to both of them.
“We actually thought we could raise a toast to him,” Blaise said cautiously. “We don’t have to if you think that’s not a good idea,” he hastened to continue.
“A bath?”
Harry felt himself blushing. “I don’t know. Maybe,” he muttered. “But we’re friends.”
“Never mind,” Harry said, pulling back and taking Draco’s hand. “Come,” he said and dragged Draco to the couch.
“Er, sort of,” Harry said. “It was rather he telling me about things I didn’t know how to react to. I mean, what can I say to someone who’s been disowned by his own parents?”
Harry just nodded curtly and crossed his arms, sullen.
plan all along, you were the one who threw me with the quaffle right before Draco spotted the snitch!” Harry said.
“It’s Draco,” Harry mumbled, looking intently at his shoelaces.
“Couldn’t you just change sides?” Harry asked, feeling stupid as he already knew the answer.
“No, we haven’t.”
“I’m still so relieved Hagrid’s back. I hadn’t even realized how worried I had been because we didn’t know where he was but now that he’s back, it’s so much easier to concentrate on our studies again,” Hermione said.
Harry didn’t know which one of them started it. They both took a step towards each other and leaned forward, closing slowly the small gap between them. Harry’s face was only inches away from Malfoy’s, and he could feel Malfoy’s warm breath on his lips. The kiss was tentative and timid at first, Harry’s lips barely touching Malfoy’s. It felt like a game, both of them wanting but neither of them brave enough to take the next step. Finally, Harry couldn’t help but press his lips more firmly against Malfoy’s, giving completely into the kiss.
“I don’t know. I trusted him once and he still left me. Even though I understand now why he left me I can’t just get past it and pretend it never happened,” Harry said. “Besides, he said it himself, he’s not sure if he’ll be able to stay away from his parents.”
! And I still agree with you. There’re many cases like this in history, and, trust me, this way won’t lead to anything good. Instead, the gap between people will quite certainly become even wider, you just
“Let me help you,” Hermione said and used the cleaning charm to make the blood on Harry’s clothes and face vanish. “Are you alright? Shouldn’t you go to the Hospital Wing?”
--*--*--*--*--
“Maybe we should knock again,” Ginny muttered and knocked on the door, much louder than Harry had done.
“I read a lot as you may have noticed. The human mind is quite fascinating,” Hermione said, shrugging. “Now we’ve got to do something lighter. Is there anything nice and easy to watch on your telly?” she asked, starting to flip the channels on tv.
“Don’t thank me yet, you don’t even know if you’ll like it,” Draco murmured. “Just don’t open it with the others.”
“Oh, Harry dear, you look still so thin. Would you like some more shepherd’s pie?” Molly asked, both squinting worriedly and smiling warmly at Harry from the other side of the kitchen table.
Ginny slammed Harry with a sofa cushion. “No, you idiot, of course not. I’m not going to tell a soul,” she said, sounding a bit disappointed Harry could even doubt her. “It’s a pity you’re not dating openly. You could’ve done something with Michael and me.”
,” he waved his wand again, and red sparkles erupted from the tip of it, stunning the Auror and making him collapse on the ground, unconscious.
Narcissa looked almost exactly the same as a few days ago with her lifeless hair and dark circles under her eyes, but there was still something else that bothered Draco. The expression on her face looked like a studied mask that was impossible to read. Other people wouldn’t probably think anything about it, but Draco had seen that look on his mother’s face so many times in his life he knew it could only mean she was trying to hide something ominous.
Draco didn’t say anything, he just seized the bottle, took a proper mouthful of firewhisky, and passed the bottle back to Harry.
On the other hand, now that Harry came to think of it, the dream simply couldn’t be real at any level as Malfoy would never lower himself to ask Harry to help him. Not that Harry would even own him that. During the War, Malfoy had saved Harry and his friends at the Manor whereas Harry had saved Malfoy from the Fiendfyre, so they were perfectly even.
“Erm…”
“Hey Gin, do you have plans for Valentine’s Day?” Harry blurted out suddenly.
As they arrived at the room, Draco fell straight away to the huge four-poster bed and closed his eyes, feeling grateful that Potter had Apparated them next to the bed as Draco would have probably passed out otherwise.
P.S. I was really struggling with the word 'applely' in this chapter (like fruit --> fruity, citrus --> citrusy, mint --> minty etc), and I've got no idea how it sounds in English. I didn't find 'applely' in any dictionary and Grammarly didn't recognize it, but Google gave me some results with it, so I let it stay. Let me know if you come up with something better!
I'm sorry my updating has been quite sporadic with this story. I hadn't realized how busy this autumn would turn out to be so I haven't had nearly as much time for writing as I would've wanted. Right now updating once a month seems like a realistic pace for me, maybe even twice at some point. Thanks for bearing with me :)
“Say that again,” Harry said eagerly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So are you,” Draco said, closing his eyes.
“Harry, let me explain,” Draco said in a weak voice.
“What do you think?” Ginny said. “About us?”
“So the problem here seems to be that Snape’s not exactly the one to go by the rules,” Harry said gloomily. “Why couldn’t Dumbledore just teach me? I’m sure he’d be far better than Snape.”
“Stay here and keep quiet, okay?” Potter said, backing off towards the door.
Just for a fun fact, the whole idea with the phones came from the joke of Nokia 3310 being a Horcrux. Then I realized 3310 wasn't even a thing back in the '90s, so I had to find another, even older model for the story purposes. I imagine the older model wasn't that different, but it still had an antenna and probably no games :D
When Harry was making Draco kiss him on the mouth again, the tapestry flew suddenly to the side.
“I know, but I’m just sure there’s still something going on. He wasn’t just having a nice little walk through Knockturn Alley,” Harry snapped.
“Take this off,” Draco whispered, tugging the hem of Harry’s t-shirt.
Neither of the boys said anything, instead, they concentrated looking intently at their shoes.
“Oh?” Harry said. He found it almost hard to breathe now as he was feeling somehow so relieved about getting to know his godfather didn’t dislike Draco. In fact, it seemed to be quite the opposite.
“Did they do something to you?” Draco asked, sounding horrified.
you’re not telling me. And I also happen to know I’m not part of your Golden Trio, but I hope you know you can talk to me. I want to be your friend, not just your friend’s little sister.”
This time, though, Harry could make himself sit still and eat, and he even managed to chat lightly with Ron and Hermione. Maybe it was going to be fine.
They started striding through the corridors at a fast pace.
“Until someone’s going to give me a rational answer. I don’t understand Ginny at all, where have they even met?”
“Um, I can’t say I like it. But it isn’t your fault,” Harry said. “Is that why you stopped texting me?”
“So, you found Zabini last night?” Harry asked Malfoy, trying to change the subject desperately.
“Why?” Draco whispered, turning his gaze to meet Snape’s dark, almost entirely black eyes.
“Love is not that straightforward. We are often told that love conquers all, but it isn’t always the truth. Love is complicated, messy, and unpredictable, especially in cases like yours. Sometimes the fear makes us not see love. Sometimes we may even hurt people we love,” Andromeda said. “Your mother has been part of the pureblood idealistic group for so long it’s hard to break free. It’s always possible she might be able to leave some day, but there’s no certainty when someone is so deep in.”
“Er, sure,” Harry said awkwardly, looking at his friends as though pleading them to say ‘no, Harry can’t, we’ve already got plans’, but everybody kept quiet. Harry wasn’t too eager to talk with Blaise as he was sure he knew what the Slytherin wanted to discuss.
“Shut it,” Potter grunted, clenching his hands in fists.
“Hear hear!” Ron said. “Cheers, Harry!” he continued, clanking his cup against Harry’s and emptying it at once.
Being back with Draco wasn’t all the time a bed of roses. Some days both Harry and Draco felt a bit tense or grumpy and therefore didn’t know how to act around each other. Some days they were both in such a bad mood they snapped at each other over the smallest things. And some days they even had quite heated and intense arguments, which made them feel like not wanting to talk to each other for the rest of the day.
“Ah, you’re already here,” Blaise said as both Harry and Ginny stood up. “Nice to see you again, Harry,” he said, shaking Harry’s hand for some reason.
“You’re not an elderly lady,” Harry mumbled.
The smile on Harry’s face disappeared abruptly.
“What happened then?” Hermione asked, ignoring Ron. “I only remember you telling me someone kissed you out of the blue, you asking about the pureblood culture, and after a while you telling me it didn’t work out.”
“Okay, okay,” Ron said, giving up. “He managed to be
“ – but you still seem to be the very same arrogant git, so I'm not quite sure about
Chris laughed heartily. “The night when I made Draco taste half of the spirits the bar we were in was selling, I assume? I’m sorry, I was definitely not trying to steal your man – not that there’d be anything wrong with Draco, he’s a really gorgeous young man,” he said, winking at Draco and making him blush. “But I felt like I just had to introduce him to a wider selection of alcohol. The poor guy had never tasted even regular beer.”
“Yes, the support group for the Muggles who’ve suffered as victims of conservative religions,” Draco said. “Hermione has surely told you about that?” he added, lifting his eyebrow.
Harry came quietly to stand in front of Draco and pulled him into a tight hug. It was first then Draco realized he was shaking, too, and feeling actually so dizzy it was a miracle he was still standing.
“I dunno. We could become those… those Muggles who fly to the Moon,” Draco muttered, eyes closed.
When the first executions were over, the executions started to be held once a week, and every time either one or two Death Eaters were killed at the same time. First, there were the Carrows, then Antonin Dolohov, after him Augustus Rookwood, and right at the end of June Walden Macnair and Corban Yaxley. Before every single execution, Harry, Ron, and Hermione tried to plead the new Minister for Magic, Kingsley Shacklebolt, to stop the executions, but they always got the same answer: Kingsley was utterly handless when it came to trying to persuade the Wizengamot to reconsider its decisions. Whereas the mere idea of Harry, Ron and Hermione trying to ask the Wizengamot to discuss the matter again was doomed right from the start as the opinion of two wizards and one witch who were barely of age and who hadn’t even finished their schooling counted simply for nothing, no matter how crucial their role had been during the War and how the Wizengamot wouldn’t probably even be able to punish the Death Eaters now if it wasn’t for them.
He and Harry hadn’t talked to each other in many weeks now. After their argument about Draco choosing Voldemort’s side, Harry had kept his threat and given Draco exaggeratively much time and space to make up his mind. He had started ignoring Draco completely, not even glancing in his direction when passing by him on the corridors, eating at the Great Hall at the same time or sitting in the shared classes. He didn’t even appear in the Room of Requirement where Draco spent all his evenings, hoping for Harry to come and tell him how sorry he was and how he hadn’t meant a word he had said. Instead, Harry had seemed to have the time of his life without Draco around. It had been painful to see the Gryffindor boy babbling and laughing with his friends all around the school as if Draco had never been a part of his life. Only once had Draco managed to catch Harry’s eye, but instead of seeing the familiar playfulness and warmth glinting in his endlessly green eyes, he had met only coldness and emptiness.
Harry really wanted to see Hedwig, but he was also in desperate need of some time alone. He visited the Owlery, petted Hedwig for a moment and offered her some treats, but instead of heading back in afterwards, he decided to take a walk around Black Lake.
So it hadn’t been just another nightmare from which he would have just woken up at home, in his huge four-poster bed, wrapped comfortably in his silk sheets as the morning sun played lightly on his face.
“You’ll see soon enough,” Ginny said, smiling. “Nothing bad or stressful, I promise.”
Harry wasn’t exactly in the mood for presents but he took the present in his hands anyway. It was as neatly wrapped as the one on Christmas, but this time it was in purple wrapping paper with a silvery ribbon. Harry opened it hastily, throwing the wrapping paper aside.
“I could come up with a background story for you, something that fits well with the pureblood culture so that you could speak as freely about your experiences as possible,” Granger said. “I think you’d do fine, as long as you don’t say the words pureblood or magic aloud.”
“Thank you,” Malfoy whispered barely audibly and left hastily.
“Just taught him a few words on our way back,” Hermione said, still laughing. “You should still practise your pronunciation, though.”
Harry sighed heavily and dropped the quill, giving up. “I can’t concentrate.”
“Do you think we could just escape together, you and I?” Draco asked sleepily, nestling up against Harry and interlacing their fingers together.
“Not for long,” Neville said. “Seamus and Ron just seem to be making sure everyone’s filling their cups often enough.”
“Er, yeah, Potter is right, no need to bow,” Draco said, and Dobby straightened his position right away.
“Erm, I think I’ll be alright. But thanks,” Harry said. He could still remember the last time when Ron had called him by telephone in the summer between their second and third year, yelling at the mouthpiece. Not to mention the time when the Weasleys had come to fetch Harry to the Burrow right before the Quidditch World Cup, and instead of coming to the Dursleys smoothly and civilized through the front door, they had somehow ended up exploding half of the Dursleys’ living room. Not that Harry had been really upset about that or anything.
“Even after everything I’ve done?” Draco said, looking like he didn’t take a word of what she was saying.
“And how many real witches and wizards did they manage to kill? They killed basically only each other as all the real witches and wizards could just Disapparate from their bonfires,” Harry said, rolling his eyes. “And why is it dangerous if the pureblood culture gets a bit mixed up with the one of Half-bloods or Muggle-borns? It’s rather dangerous if a culture is closed and hostile towards other cultures. All the living cultures get, and have always got, mixed up with other cultures.”
“Was that supposed to be a joke?” Draco asked, snorting.
“It’d be ridiculous. I mean, well, they were both bloody idiots and completely on their parents’ leashes. But the Wizengamot can’t do anything as stupid as to sentence to death a couple of brainwashed teens,” Ron said, looking at Hermione as if waiting for her to support his words.
Harry snapped his eyes quickly from Malfoy. “Nothing, I’m not that interested in Malfoy’s love life. Although I thought he and Parkinson would’ve matched well with each other, both are almost equally awful morons.”
“Too late now. Not to take them must be one of the biggest mistakes of my life I’m regretting,” Blaise said dramatically. “You being so clever and all, why don’t you tell me who he is?”
“Oh, fine. I’ll go,” Harry said, rolling his eyes as guilty-looking Ron mouthed ‘sorry’ to him.
” Granger said slightly grudgingly. “
“What does that mean, to organize a funeral?” Harry asked, confused.
“So?” Dudley said impatiently.
“No, he can’t. He’s too much of a coward for something like that,” Hermione stated firmly.
“Harry, why are you staring at Malfoy?” Hermione asked, frowning. Now both Ron and Hermione were looking at him, which made Harry flush guiltily for some reason.
Harry’s summer back at the Dursleys wasn’t anything to cheer about, but at least it wasn’t any worse than the previous summers either. Some of the Order members had indeed talked to the Dursleys, or rather threatened them, which might have made the Dursleys leave him alone more often than they’d normally do. Harry felt like he didn’t need even the Invisibility Cloak to make himself invisible in the Dursleys’ household, and not even Dudley dared to be too much of a nuisance to Harry for once.
“And don’t touch anything,” Snape snapped as he closed the door, leaving Harry alone in his office.
“I guessed you’d be here,” Draco said uncertainly, walking slowly nearer to Harry.
Harry shook his head. “You dream about us often?”
“Oh, for goodness sake, Harry, you’re both only eighteen. It’s not like you should just run away to Vegas and get married, swearing eternal love to each other,” Hermione said. “You can take it as slowly as you want. Week by week, day by day, hour by hour. As long as you tell each other about your feelings and fears, I’m sure you’ll do just fine.”
“What do you mean?” Harry asked Ron, confused.
“No, Draco, I don’t know,” Harry cried, cutting Draco short. “At some point, you’ve got to make the choice. It’s either me or Voldemort.”
“What do you mean, Draco?” Narcissa asked, raising her eyebrow elegantly.
“I don’t know,” Draco said uncertainly. “It may be just a cloud.”
“I don’t need luck, Potter, it’s all about the skills.”
“Probably a good idea,” Draco said. “You go first and I follow after a moment?”
Ron snorted incredulously. “Since when have you cared if Malfoy’s eating or not?”
“Might have a crush on one, rather handsome Gryffindor, and want to stay on his good side. We Malfoys are pretty cunning and selfish, as you’re well aware,” Draco said and kissed Harry.
“Do you want to add something to Blaise’s story, then?” Ginny asked curtly, but the look in her eyes had softened quite a lot.
“You sound like you already understand him much better than I do.”
As Draco followed his father’s gaze, he realized he was still standing next to Harry,
“That’s different, it was never meant to be permanent. For Malfoy, it would’ve been.”
“Probably,” Harry said, shrugging. “He hasn’t done anything wrong, I s’pose.”
Hermione closed the compartment door slowly as Harry and Ron sat back on to their seats.
“Mm, yeah,” Harry muttered, pulled his wand out of the pocket, and cast a quick Warming Charm on both of them.
“You know that doesn’t make any sense.”
“Ouch, Potter, you oaf! You stepped on my toes!” Draco whispered furiously.
“There’s no but. You do realize my family would disown me if they knew?” Malfoy said.
“Not exactly,” Draco said, starting to squirm a little. “Just wanted to say that it was really nice of you to see me, and I truly appreciate how much you’ve helped Harry, with mobile phones and all,” he continued in a rather formal tone.
wound.
“So, you fell in love in school?” A black-haired thirty-year-old looking woman, Emily, asked from the other side of the table.
Both Ron and Hermione were quiet for a moment, probably feeling unable to say a word. Hermione gulped and coughed a little to clear her throat. “Malfoy,” she whispered finally, her voice trembling.
“So Malfoy’s practically a living dead now to his family and all the pureblood families who still follow the pureblood traditions,” Ron added.
“So, how was it to see him again?” Hermione asked, looking at Harry cautiously.
the necklace was from Borgin and Burkes and he
Harry didn’t say anything for a while. He knew Draco hadn’t actually told him any reason for taking the Mark, it was all mainly Harry jumping to the only conclusion he saw as fitting. “Well, he didn’t have to.”
“Er, that’s good then? How did Michael take your breakup? If you want to talk about it, that is.”
Soon they were both standing there, having only their pants on, and looking at each other shivering and skin on goosebumps.
“Yes, Draco, I do. I have forgiven you,” Harry said firmly, trying to convince Draco. “Now that I understand better, I know I shouldn’t have tried to make you choose me over your parents in the first place. It was unfair that even I was pushing you when you already had so hard. And I still wish I had at least tried to understand you.”
“I’m a horny teenaged boy, wasted for the first time in my life. I’d want anyone at this point,” Harry said, making Malfoy back out a little. “But you absolutely most of all, god you’re so sexy I can hardly bear it,” he hastened to continue, grabbing Malfoy’s arse and pulling him back tightly against himself.
Harry had pondered a lot about what there could be wrong with Draco. He knew Draco knew something about the cursed necklace, although he didn’t know what exactly, and how active role Draco had played in the whole case. What was more, Harry had noticed Draco spent a ridiculously huge amount of time probably in the Room of Requirement as he disappeared from the Map quite often, and Harry was rather sure Draco wasn’t only in his and Harry’s room when he was there. Harry couldn’t just come up with any ideas of what Draco might be doing there, and there was no way he could ask Draco about it. He was already feeling somewhat guilty of spying on Draco behind his back, but he had rationalized that if Draco couldn’t tell him what he was up to, maybe it would be okay if Harry found out by himself. Then Draco wouldn’t have to break his promise not to tell, so Voldemort wouldn’t harm Draco nor his parents, right?
After dinner, Harry had gone to the common room, packed his bag and told Ron and Hermione he had planned to hang out with Ginny for the whole evening, and Ginny, to his relief, had been eager to cover up for him after she had got to tease him for a while about his ‘tryst’, as she had called it.
Chapter title from Lana Del Rey's "Summertime Sadness".
” Ron spluttered.
“Right,” Harry muttered. He wasn’t sure what he thought about Ginny knowing. Somehow it made him feel as if
Draco was quiet for a moment, as if he was enthralled by what he saw. “You know, there’s a story about them. Or rather a belief.”
Harry was silent for a moment. “Yes,” he ended up saying plainly, even though he was well aware they most certainly were
adorable, don’t even try to deny it,” Draco said, smirking. “Have you tasted the treacle tart yet?” he asked Harry.
“No, just whatever you’re taking,” Harry said, still feeling the rum tingling in his throat and mouth. “But not tequila!” he cried to Ron’s receding back. He didn’t have very pleasant memories of his first time trying tequila last summer.
“Why?” Ginny asked, sounding somehow fascinated.
“Just a little party,” Seamus said, shrugging carelessly.
For a moment Harry thought he had managed, but soon he could see the familiar blonde hair shining on his peripheral vision. Harry tried again, this time taking sharp turns one after another while flying at full speed. Once again he managed to elude Malfoy for a moment but somehow the brat succeeded to reach him easily after a while.
and moth-eaten mattress, counting the grey stones on the wall for probably the hundredth time as it seemed to be the only activity to keep him sane. The cell he was locked in was actually at the Ministry, which was a bit strange as he couldn’t figure out who in their right mind had come up with an idea to build there cells that reminded so much of some medieval torture chambers.
Harry would have loved to fly a little more, but his numb fingers and wind-bitten cheeks were painfully disagreeing with him. “Yeah, fine,” Harry shouted back at Ginny and turned his broom towards the ground.
“Swallow it,” Malfoy said, and Harry did obediently what Malfoy asked.
“I can show you sometime,” Harry said and chuckled. “Should we go back inside? I don’t want you to freeze to death.”
And there Harry had been, caught by Umbridge in her office, Salazar only knows doing what. Draco had tried to think furiously about all the possible ways to get Harry and his Gryffindors out of the situation, but he hadn’t been able to come up with anything that wouldn’t make him reveal himself.
If nothing else, at least Draco’s room had remained the same with his huge four-poster bed with Slytherin green bedsheets, windows that always let the morning sun in, his potion set Severus had given him before he had even started at Hogwarts, and the walls covered by pictures of Draco’s friends and his Tornados posters. It had actually been rather comforting to have at least one place in the whole house where he had felt like everything had always been the same despite everything bad that had happened outside of the walls of his room.
,” Harry whined. “No, he hasn’t hexed me or given me any potion.”
Draco took a deep breath and let go of Harry’s hand. “Harry, I’m sorry but I have to go,” he said, turning his eyes to Harry.
“Merlin, Draco,” Harry gasped as he felt Draco’s lips on his neck and Draco’s hands founding their way under Harry’s shirt.
On Friday, Harry and Ron packed hastily their rucksacks and left to Hogsmeade from where they would floo straight to the Burrow. Hermione hadn’t joined them as she had said she had something urgent to do regarding her new House unity campaign, and she would therefore need to see a couple of professors and check some books in the library.
and trust you. You clearly saw something in him, something that we didn’t. We would’ve probably been shocked at first, yes, but we would’ve come around eventually because we’ve always wanted to be there for you. To get to know this way is much, much worse, it feels like you didn’t trust us at all,” Hermione said.
“Seems like you are Harry’s biggest fan nowadays, Ferret. Can’t clearly keep your hands away from him,” Ron snapped at Malfoy.
“I’ve got my ways,” Draco said slyly, snaking his arms around Harry’s shoulders.
“Gin, please, keep quiet!” Harry hissed. “How do you even know what these are?”
“Why didn’t you let me punch him?” Ron whined loudly.
“Are you being serious? Why would this change anything? Except if you’re having a huge crush on me,” Ron said, grinning. “– you’re not having a crush on me, right?”
Abruptly, Harry breathed sharply, and his eyes snapped open, only to meet a pair of glassy, bluish eyes staring at him, worried.
“Mm-hmm,” Harry mumbled, fiddling with an empty water glass in his hands. “And Goyle. The Wizengamot can’t just sentence them to death, too, right? They’re both barely eighteen.”
“What do you mean? How can you even say so?”
“Mum, you’re strangling us!” Ron cried, his face turning as red as his hair.
Harry regretted immediately he said anything. “The Sorting Hat wanted to put me into Slytherin at first. We had a small… argument about where to put me.”
Hermione blinked her eyes, surprised. ”Do you want to talk about Cho?”
Draco just grunted back at Harry, not even turning his eyes to him.
Draco nodded as he tried to wipe his tears away hastily.
“What are you doing?” Ginny asked and jumped on the couch next to Harry. “Oh, mobile phones!” Ginny cried out eagerly before Harry had time to hide them.
“Let’s talk more after the class,” Harry whispered and seized one of the bowtruckles.
Ginny rolled her eyes. “You know she fancies you. Everybody knows, it’s already common knowledge. Couldn’t take her eyes off of you during the meeting.”
“Father, please.”
Harry took a few steps back, looking slightly embarrassed. “Sorry, I had meant to talk to you before kissing you,” he said, turning red.
The look on Andromeda’s face turned pained. “I think she would, but not for the same reasons as Lucius. I think your mother would want you back because she loves you.”
Oh yes, he definitely could. He seized the bag and darted to the door. Right before closing the door, a strange, shimmering light hovering somewhere near to Snape’s desk caught Harry’s attention. He hesitated for a split-second as he heard Snape’s voice echoing in his head, telling him not to touch anything.
Draco nodded solemnly.
“But he’s
“Yes. It said a lot about how rotten this family is when she got kicked out. I just left voluntarily so no surprise I got burned from the tree but her? They made her choose between the man she loves and her own family. ‘Toujours Pur’, so she practically committed a sacrilege when she got married with a Muggle-born.”
“I don’t know…” Harry said, hesitating.
“Don’t look at me like that,” Draco said curtly. “I’ve known all the time what I’ve been doing.”
“Sorry, what?” Draco asked, blinking his eyes.
by Ginny or
an Unbreakable Vow?”
“That went well,” Hermione said, and Harry rolled his eyes. “No, Harry, I mean it. Malfoy was sure you’d rise, but you didn’t. Did you see the look on his face? He looked so surprised and even… uneasy.
Harry was silent for a moment, lost in his own thoughts. “Where do you think we go after we die?” he asked quietly.
As they had entered the hall, Harry and Draco stared panicky at anything else but at each other.
“For the whole day? Doesn’t seem likely, especially as Ron told me he couldn’t find you when he went after you,” Hermione said, narrowing her eyes suspiciously.
Ron raised his eyebrow questioningly but, to Harry’s relief, refrained from saying anything. They picked hastily up some leftovers and hurried towards the dungeons.
he didn’t want his friends to know about his relationship with Draco. Actually, there wasn’t even a way to discuss the topic without revealing Draco’s name or something crucial from his background.
“We were just planning how to hex you after the Quidditch practise, the one you and your friends so kindly decided to ruin for us,” Harry tried to say with venom, but ended up sounding calm. He noticed that the Slytherin no longer seemed to be angry either, so, probably for the first time in his life, Harry felt like it was hard to get annoyed with the git.
“You’re such a pain in the arse,” Malfoy groaned. “But yeah, Blaise interrogated me as soon as I stepped into the common room. Claims to be so sharp-minded he had known about me liking you long before I even knew it myself,” Malfoy said in a bitter voice, turning to look at Harry.
“Yes, it’s lovely in here,” Harry agreed, taking a few steps to the terrace and knocked on the door.
“Yeah, I’ve noticed that,” Harry said gloomily as he thought not only about Draco but also about Sirius and Andromeda. “What are you trying to say to me with all this?”
Harry sat down next to Draco, laughing. Draco tried to hand Teddy over to him but as soon as Teddy realized what was happening, he reached for Draco’s hair to grab him by it.
Draco felt almost amused. Of course they’d get caught and Potter and his great escape plan would come to an end before it had properly even started, only a couple of pitiful corridors and one staircase from Draco's cell.
“Of course you didn’t,” Hermione said hastily, looking a bit nervous as if she wasn’t sure how well Harry would take someone teasing him about Draco. “But I agree with Ginny, it’s good you’re talking again.”
“Of course I won’t tell anyone, you git. You know I support you no matter what,” Ginny said, reassuringly. “So, who is it?”
Harry was silent for a moment, pretending to chew and swallow as he thought what to tell her. “Erm, Malfoy was there,” he answered finally.
“Give me your cup, I’m going to get us some more,” Ron said, seizing Harry’s cup. “Any wishes?”
“Are you sure you want to waste this on me? I’ve never drunk wine, I can’t probably appreciate this properly. Or more likely at all.”
“Tell me, Draco, how could they all just suddenly escape?” Snape asked, talking over Draco.
Draco stroked Harry’s stomach soothingly. “Tell them you went to bed really late and woke up really early, simple as that.”
Harry closed his eyes for a moment, enjoying the feeling of Malfoy’s finger moving lightly around his lips.
“I’ll visit the Owlery, I want to see how Hedwig’s doing,” Harry said quickly, stepping towards the front doors after dinner.
That night Harry’s mind was filled with memories of Draco’s finger drawing lines on his chest, Draco laughing so that his warm breath was tingling Harry’s face, Draco trying to comb Harry’s hair gently with his fingers, Draco’s lips meeting Harry’s in a slow, tentative kiss, his whole body telling Harry how much he cared for him.
“Speak for yourself, I
Harry was quiet for a while, trying to understand what on earth Zabini was explaining to him. “I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Harry said again, this time meaning it.
“Yeah, it’s been pretty hard occasionally, especially at the beginning of autumn.”
It was a bright summer night. Harry could smell the fresh, wet grass and hear the various birds that didn’t stop singing even at night during the summer months. He closed his eyes, and the world started spinning around even though he was pretty sure he was sprawled firmly on the ground.
“Why have you brought me here?” Draco asked wearily as Harry folded the Cloak and tucked it into his robe pocket.
Draco nodded. “But I wouldn’t want to miss them.”
“See you next summer, Harry,” Sirius said, pulling Harry into a tight hug.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “I didn’t even know they fancy each other.”
Harry gasped. “Is that it?”
As they arrived at their usual spot, the moon had risen up the horizon and made now the whole world shimmer in an eerie light. The lake had a flat and extremely thin ice cover on it, and it reflected the view so strictly in detail it reminded Harry of a painting that was hanging upside down.
About Durmstrang, I've read it's not 100% sure where it's supposed to be located, but according to most of the hints and websites I've found, Norway sounds the most plausible alternative (though the name 'Durmstrang' sounds more like German to me, haha, I'm confused).
“Potter?”
This year it seemed like Harry wouldn’t be able to relax anywhere in the castle. Thanks to Prophet, Ministry and Umbridge, Hogwarts students were sharply divided into ones who believed Harry and supported his story, and to the others who believed Prophet’s articles and thought Harry had gone nuts. Wherever Harry went, he could feel the eyes on him and hear fierce whispering that consisted most likely his name and the words
