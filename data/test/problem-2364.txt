at this location, and I’m not letting the Ministry’s tightfistedness affect the quality of our work. And also—” He pauses as the Portkey activates and they whirl their way through to the Lake District, grabbing Harry by the bicep and steadying him as they land. “—I’m paying for this myself. The Ministry won’t see an invoice for a Knut over our allotted budget, I swear it.”
Ginny has her nipples pierced, she’d gotten them done right after they got back together, the summer after the War, and when she came home with them, Harry’d barely been able to wait the recommended two hours to let them magically heal all the way before he got his hands on them. Since they broke up, he’s been with people of all sorts, bouncing from type to type as he tried to figure himself out. One thing he knows for sure, though? He
Finally, though, they call it a night, and one of the caddies appears to Apparate them back to Linthwaite House. Draco endures Travis’ drunken stumblings and professions of deep, everlasting partnership and friendship, and finally manages to extricate himself and make his way slowly up the staircase when Travis is called over to the bar once they get indoors.
He’s so exhausted when they get home on those days that Ginny’s started suggesting they have friends over, instead, and that helps—fills the house with light and warmth and laughter for a few hours, chases away the dark corners that still gather despite their best efforts.

Draco retreats back into his meditation when this happens, so he’s not sure exactly how much time passes before he’s blinking back to himself at the tug of Harry’s hand on his trouser leg.
Andromeda eyes them suspiciously; Draco had done his best to spell them both to neatness, but he’s still flushed and blotchy around his neck, and Harry’s lips are swollen. She doesn’t say anything, though, just raises a devastating eyebrow before taking the cake and spelling it ahead of her into the kitchen.
Harry seems to get it, though, because he stills the motion of his hand—Draco whines and squirms for more stimulation, but a sharp slap to his inner thigh soon quiets him—and the candles float closer.
kick Potter’s on.
Ron stuffs the rest of the pastry in his mouth and swallows. “Oh, no worries on that score, mate. We actually gave it a second go, just to be sure. So you see, I’m just a little knackered from being up late, that’s all. Nothing dubious.”
Potter, honestly—try for a little professionalism, won’t you? But,” he adds, standing and scooting around Harry and heading for the wardrobe, “if you play your cards right, and buy me a bottle of that
Harry’s impatient and condescending; she gets the impression that he’s retreading an argument, retracing statements and opinions he’s already made to other people, and that only makes her temper burn hotter. Of
As he rounds the track the last time, Draco puts on a burst of speed, and Harry applauds sarcastically as he comes to a stop. Draco glares at him while he stretches a bit, but soon they’re taking their places on either side of the dueling field, circling each other with their wands out.
Craning her neck, Hermione peers at the book’s cover, mouthing the title soundlessly to herself. She straightens, and Harry obligingly lowers the book so she can take a look at the page it had opened itself to. He watches with concern as she scans the pages and her face gets paler and paler.

against the rules, but whenever I imagined that you might...return my affections, I guess I assumed you’d be opposed to it, or make us choose between being partners and being together, and...well. I didn’t want to make that choice.”
“You lied to me,” Harry says, brain working furiously to wrap his mind around everything Malfoy said. “For months, you were lying to me every time you didn’t tell me you’d charmed your appearance. If I hadn’t figured it out, would you
curling up warm in his chest, where his heart used to beat.
“...fifteen?” he finally ventures, looking up through his lashes. “Five for each?”
Draco crosses his arms and squints across the pitch. The wind is high today, and he tightens his thighs around his broomstick to stay steady.
Potter grabs the ballcap off the desk and crams it over his curls, then extracts his wand from its arm holster and cleans himself off with a few whispered words. The wet spot at the front of his joggers disappears. He winks at Draco once, then heads for the door. “Great session, coach. We can
for this party to be over; apologies to the birthday boy, but Draco’s got a few other things he’d like to do today.
Harry stays late that day. He hides in his office, reviewing paperwork and starting on his budget requests that aren’t due for months. He doesn’t want to run any risk of running into Draco again.
“If you’d
Well. For most of them.
None of them ask questions. They never have. They don’t care about her personal life, as long as it’s not negatively impacting her game.
There’s dinner under a stasis charm in the sitting room, on the table next to her favourite couch, and Ginny barely tastes it as she bolts it down. She eats alone, though.
—you’re doing— Anything, anything you want.” Harry’s panting raggedly, thrusting forward against Draco’s hip.
Harry stops talking about work.
for crimes he had nothing to do with!” Draco’s voice is strident by the end of his diatribe, his face red, his eyes burning in their sunken sockets.
It wasn’t until years later that Harry learned that Ron had to have a similar conversation with Hermione. He won’t take credit for it, doesn’t like to talk about it at all, but Harry and Hermione both know that Ron saved them that autumn.
when Harry’s behaved so perfectly, he adds, “Daddy, please…”
Hermione shrugs one shoulder. “I didn’t. I let slip that he’d come in voluntarily, to present compelling evidence in the case that would both clear his name and point the DMLE in the right direction. I was hoping a solid source would lend credence to the tip, and might even convince Draco to
?” Potter grits out when Draco voices this thought, glaring up at him from the landing. Draco hadn’t been fast enough to grab him before he fell that time. “Look, just—let’s get out of here. Maybe once we’re out it’ll stop?”
He busies himself with covertly casting
The lights are off and Harry’s snoring gently when Draco finally manages to get the door unlocked, and he does his best to stay quiet as he strips off his clothes and drops them on the floor. He brushes his teeth, swaying and squinting into the mirror, then curls up in bed, noticing the Hangover potions Harry left on his nightstand just before he closes his eyes.
So, seeing Malfoy in a library wasn’t entirely unexpected—but seeing him in
she cast on him at the end of each fight, when she couldn’t take it any longer. And as much as he empathises with Ron’s desire for a peaceful, carefree life, he knows that there had still been work to be done, and anyway, war or not, relationships require effort, don’t they? That’s why he and Ginny fizzled, after all—neither of them cared enough to put in the work to maintain a romantic relationship, and between that and their sexual incompatibility, they fell back into being just friends almost immediately that summer.
They sit quietly for a while. Harry can just hear the sounds of the department wrapping up for the day through his door, and he redoubles the privacy charms; it wouldn’t do for a passing Auror to overhear what’s going on in here.
“Not tonight,” he says, a pleading edge to his voice. “We’re drunk, and— Just. We’re not golfing tomorrow. We can talk then. Not tonight, please, Harry.”
remind him of anything, but finally he can’t delay any longer—he needs to head down to eat if they’re to make it to the course in time for the start.
Draco’s grateful Potter’s in the fire and can’t see how red he’s turning. “Whatever, Potter,” he snaps. “Fine, you win. Are you going to
with you??”
you know? Maybe it’s just...I mean, it’s a bit uncomfortable, seeing a bloke out of the blue when you’ve read some pretty graphic sex scenes he’s written, isn’t it?”
Harry shifts and winces when he knocks his knee against the bottom side of his desk. He looks up in time to catch the side of Draco’s borrowed mouth flickering up in what might be a smile. And even though it might be at his expense, Harry’s rather shocked at just how glad he is to see Draco smiling again. Their last interaction had been much less pleasant, and Harry has to forcibly shove the memory of Draco’s snide, mocking voice to the back of his mind and focus as Draco’s hair starts to slowly bleed back to blonde.
“Ahh,” Harry sighs, leaning his head back against the wall and languidly canting his hips forward, clearly still lost in Draco’s ministrations over his arse. “I was thinking about you, you know. I usually do.”
Ron stares at them for a minute, then sinks to the floor, laughing so hard he’s holding his stomach and actually

Hermione is right—Christopher came highly recommended, and his arse certainly does look nice in the tight, tailored trousers he favours whenever he bends down to drop Harry’s tea off, but he hasn’t got a subtle bone in his body; he may as well prance down the Ministry hallways (preferably shirtless, if Harry’s being honest with himself) shouting
“Harry, you were

Malfoy.”
Harry frowns and looks at Hermione, who looks equally confused. “Er…” he starts. “So...you’re doing alright, then? Spell is broken, everything is fine?”
Potter’s jaw drops. “What? No, of course not. Why do you think I’m making fun of you? Wait—don’t answer—let me just get the cake stuff and I’ll come over. We’ll get it fixed, alright?” Potter snaps the connection shut and Draco sits back, feeling foolish for his outburst.

not over Draco Malfoy of all people, but he’d been a bit—upset, perhaps. Peeved. Bothered. He’d gotten used to their routine, and of course going from sex on tap to nothing at all had been an adjustment, so it was only natural that he was a little out of sorts for a few weeks after.
Harry asks that they not talk about it the next day, so Draco lets it go, but he lets Blaise know they won’t be making it to that Friday’s pub night, and makes sure he’s home before Harry is with drinks ready. He wants to talk about it now, wants to lay the discussion out, wants to make sure they’re both comfortable, because…

They’d discovered a few months back that Hangover potions work even better if you take one before falling asleep and a second first thing in the morning, and Draco smiles to himself at his partner’s thoughtfulness. He downs one of the vials, sucking in over his teeth at the ice-cold mint flavour, and thinks about nothing much as he drifts off.
He must black out for a minute, because next thing he knows, Draco’s straddling his waist, staring down at Harry’s chest and face, hand a blur over his own cock. “Let me,” Harry croaks, batting Draco’s hand away and closing his hand around his cock.
“You— Draco, you
Finally, Harry’s tidied up his coat and the shreds of his shirt to Draco’s satisfaction and is crawling onto the couch and over his lap. He drapes himself over Draco’s leg, his hard cock between Draco’s thighs, legs bent enough so his arse is angled up. He pulls a pillow closer to himself and rests his head on it, turning his cheek so he’s facing the back of the couch (and Draco; Draco always insists on seeing his face for this), with his arms folded under the cushion.
Ginny melts against him, warm with his praise. “Hey, so, I’m going to take a shower, but do you maybe want…” She leans back and arches an eyebrow at him, watching as his face gets a little flushed as he catches on.

We had dinner right when I went over, and Merlin, can he ever cook—who would have thought—and he asked me why Hermione didn’t seem more upset about the whole thing, you know, and I explained about the breakup and everything, and he was all snotty about it at first, but after he got that out of his system he really made a lot of sense—he was talking about how Hermione has her own career and expecting her to do more chores than me isn’t fair, and that it
Harry leans against his desk and touches the top of Draco’s head. “It’s got nothing to do with that,” he murmurs. “You don’t look
“You love it,” Draco says, confident and assured in a way that he never was about the way Harry feels for him at the start of the relationship.
Ron seizes on the topic change with the air of a man previously drowning being offered a life vest. “Oh, Merlin, absolutely, and not a one of them with any tact or subtlety about it at all. Not sure why they think they’re going to trick me into saying anything?”
are scoring past us.”
why you always look so irritated when we end up in a room with just one bed?” he asks delightedly, and Draco flushes and stammers and tries to deny it until Harry shoves him onto the bed and kisses all over his face and neck.
Draco pulls back briefly, eyes roaming over Harry’s face. “No,” he says again, smiling. “It’s hardly
“I’m sure I can think of a few,” Harry says, transfixed by Draco’s eyes, but just as he’s leaning down to press their mouths together, a burst of sound from out in the bullpen sends him flying back to his feet. “Wait here,” he instructs Draco, who sits up straight and clutches the chair arms, knuckles turning white.
“Oh,” Harry says, reaching up and tracing a finger along Draco’s jaw. “You like that? You like that I think you’re good? You do, don’t you.”
Ron chuckles and punches Seamus in the shoulder as they approach, and all three of them file into Harry’s office. “Alright, Finnigan. I take it the goss hit Games and Sports, then?”
Draco is jerked from sleep too early again the next day, and this time it takes him only seconds to notice that the shower’s going.
shows up exactly on time when they’re not playing?”
Draco heaves a deep, deep sigh. He should be putting in for hazard pay for this. “I suppose you’re suggesting I spend the night in here,” he says without turning back to face the bed. He can tell his face is bright red, and Potter doesn’t need to see that.
“No, thank you,” Draco mutters, still staring at Harry’s desk.
you small-minded little buffoon. Just because I don’t parade my lovers across the front pages of whatever rag is willing to publish a photo like your friend over there—”
Harry’s spelled the room up a few degrees, flirting with uncomfortably warm, and Draco can feel the prickle of sweat at his hairline even as his toes curl into the warmth. His body’s responding to the atmosphere—to the shadows, and the quiet, and the heat, and Harry’s soft, sibilant whispers that carry just a touch of whatever Parseltongue remains in his brain when he’s aroused. Draco’s hardening slowly, and he feels lazy, and boneless, and utterly at ease.
“Well, what do you know—it looks like I’m going to be!” Ron roars, staggering to his feet. “Bloody

Ron freezes at the end of the stacks, then groans and bangs his head forward into his pile of books. Harry springs forward to brace them and keep any from falling to the ground. “Bloody hell, you’re right. Well, it’s too late now...if I went back it would be weird, right? It would be. Look, just help me find a table and I’ll get these bloody things all laid out, and when you’re grabbing the books try not to be too
“Of course,” Draco grits out, turning to face the building. “Grand. Did you have time to review the files before he sent you over?”
They make their way back downstairs eventually. Harry puts together some snacks and brings them to the sitting room, but there’s Draco in just those tight,

Draco thinks money may have actually changed hands over it; Theo was never one to pass up the opportunity to set up a betting pool, especially at the expense of his friends. That stakes of

Anyway, eventually Hermione had enough of picking up Ron’s socks behind him and having to ask him to set the washing-up spells after each and every meal, and gave him the boot with an ultimatum: until you can act like an independent adult, we can’t be together.
Harry shakes his head fondly and crosses to his private Floo, which is warded to the teeth and only allows travel one way, from his office to his home. “No, she has not. Which means we’d best get going; she’ll be in to check on us any minute.” He throws powder into the flames. “I’m still at Grimmauld; you’re...you’re still keyed into the wards, so you should arrive in my study. We can go from there to the Manor.”
Draco must be silent for a moment too long, because the light in Potter’s eyes dims a bit, and he starts to pull himself up, and
Harry had started shaking his head halfway through Draco’s words. “No,” he replies, leaning over and spearing one of Draco’s chips with his fork. Draco squawks in protest—Harry hadn’t ordered chips with his dinner,

It isn’t always success stories, of course, but after the first few years, Harry had discovered Third Space.

are scattered over every available surface, so she can’t avoid the increasing number of articles and pictures surrounding Harry’s time out in public with Draco Malfoy.
“But,” Harry starts. There was a murder, and he’s Head Auror.
“Oh shit,” Harry gasps, and comes all over Draco’s stomach. He slumps forward and breathes for a minute, listening to Draco’s racing heart. “No, don’t pull out yet, just—” He wiggles his hand between them and gets his hand around Draco’s cock, which is so wet at the tip.
Harry groans and barely refrains from thunking his head onto the table. “Like you wouldn’t believe. It’s bad enough I’m up at the arsecrack of dawn every bloody day, but we’ve a whole herd of interns in this week and not a one of them knows anything,
His fingers crook and twist inside Draco, and his head lowers back to his cock, and Draco bucks and pulls against the restraints at his wrists and ankles, and his eyes roll back in his head, and he drifts off, the question of the candles put to the side for another time.

), but lets him pass without comment.
Harry’s kneeling in the middle of their bedroom, and Draco’s just finished binding him up in silken rope, and the sunset lancing in through their window has set him glowing. “So what are you going to do about it?” Harry replies, a laugh under his words, eyes dancing. “If you’re just going to stare at me all night, I’m afraid I’ll have to spell myself free and take care of
He’s not comfortable with it, that much is obvious, but Draco persists; one day, he hopes, Harry will finally see what Draco does.
Draco’s whole body is trembling, and he’s gasping for air. “Oh god, oh god,” he whimpers, hand clenching spasmodically over Harry’s hip. “Harry, please, I need—”
Yes, there’s a lot to talk about still. But Draco’s hand in his own heals something he’s tried so hard to pretend for years wasn’t broken, and finally, Harry thinks he can begin to move on.
Potter looks up, and his smile is blinding. Draco’s back teeth grind together. He thinks he must look manic by now, but Potter doesn’t seem to notice.
All of that adds up to him, standing like a particularly idiotic statue under the water of his

about it—he spends half his life barging into Harry’s office uninvited and with no notice, brandishing reams of parchment and yapping in that supercilious nasal tone, sneering down at Harry’s messy desk and running through all the accounting issues Harry’s department is responsible for at such a fast clip that Harry can’t keep up, can only blink slowly and clench his fists under his desk, counting to ten in an effort to not resort to violence as Draco crosses his arms and smirks.
short again, but for about a year, it was just easier to keep it clipped high and tight, to be able to forget about it after his showers and just go about his day. Ginny liked the velvet-soft texture it got at that length, and Harry liked that it made him look—adult, sort of. When he stared at himself in the mirror in those months, the harsh style made the lines of his face look like a man’s, like someone who should be listened to, and his mother’s eyes and the scar that saved the Wizarding world were unignorable, undeniable with nothing to distract from them.
In the end, it’s a fight about the dishes that does it.
Draco pinches the bridge of his nose as he stares down at the parchment.
“Get your shirt off,” Malfoy instructs, stripping off his own vest and tossing it over his shoulder. Harry scrambles to comply, eyes fixed on the broad expanse of skin now in front of him, and oh, he can suddenly see all those all those

Harry easily brushes off the praise of the public, accepting the swoons and the sighs and the constant eyes whenever he goes anywhere, but dismissing them as soon as he moves past the giver. He’s gracious, and sincere, and thinks every stranger who compliments his looks is full of shit.
When pub night rolls around, Harry drinks too much too quickly out of nerves, and by the time Malfoy finally arrives, he’s sullen and quiet and can barely muster up a cordial greeting.

All this dosh and she’s spoiled the surprise the second we arrive.”
Lunch continues in the less-fraught vein of slagging off their coworkers and the Ministry bureaucrats as a whole, and as they walk back into the bullpen and towards their adjoining offices, Ron’s got a spring in his step again, so Harry calls lunch a success—until, that is, he spots Seamus leaning on the wall between their doors.

The instructions had been the advantage team had to score six times, and the short-handed side had to clear the Quaffle back to the centre line three times, before he’d let them quit for the night, and they’re close, but the extra practice is clearly wearing on them—their play is getting slow, and the lines are sloppy.

He pulls his head back and bites down on Potter’s neck, feeling Potter tremble in his arms. Draco gets a firm grip on Potter’s arse, and it feels just as incredible as it looks in those bloody trousers, and it’s not long before they’re both shuddering and coming.
“You won’t,” Harry says cheerily. “It’s not pistachio, it’s mint.”
Harry narrows his eyes. “And
He can feel Ron peering over his shoulder, and if he turned his head, his partner’s brow would be furrowed, his mouth turned down.
Harry frowns briefly at the envelope, touching where his name is written in poncy, pretentious swirls with his index finger. “He’s— It’s part of that reintegration program, Gin,” he starts cautiously. “I told you about it, remember—he has assignments, tasks, you know, and he’s supposed to write about them, about how he felt and what he did, and then we—”
Hermione sighs, but forces a smile at Harry, who grimaces back as he dutifully passes the books over. “Right, Harry. I’ll just be...down here, then.” She scurries partway down another aisle, then pulls out a list and looks between it and a shelf just past her arm-reach.
And now…

They’d both softened a bit, but Harry’s kisses are fierce and all-consuming, and his hands are hot and possessive, and it’s not long before he’s rubbing himself against Draco’s stomach, and Draco himself is leaking through his trousers, just like he knew he would.

“In certain circles, I can assure you that they do,” Draco says, stepping back under the water and rinsing his face. He turns to examine his own shampoo choices, and Harry’s eyes drop of their own accord to his arse. “They came into fashion in the 1890s, you know—those Victorians may have been backwards about a lot of things, but they certainly were right on the money about what feels nice. Anyway, it’s turned into something of a tradition among that crowd; when you turn sixteen, one of your older friends will ‘sneak you out of the house’ and take you to get them done. It’s all terribly hush-hush, they make a big production out of it, sort of a mini coming-of-age ceremony before the major one when you turn seventeen. Everyone knows about it, of course, it’s been done for generations, but it’s all for fun, anyway. Adrian Pucey took me; Merlin, I had

He cranks the water down a few more degrees; he may have stepped into the shower a little too early, because sweat is still rolling off his body and he’s still catching his breath, but he’d lost track of time on the treadmill in his effort to work out the day’s frustrations, and when he’d thought to check his watch he barely had twenty minutes to meet Ron and Hermione at the pub.
“Potter, we’ve got a bit of a situation here,” Draco says, ending on a wheeze as Potter’s leg creeps over his own and nudges against his cock.
She gets why they’re being cautious around her, but
Harry steps back and nods once, casting his eyes down. “You’re right,” he says softly, turning and rummaging in his bag for more Hangover potions. “Here, here are yours,” he says, sending two vials spinning through the air to Draco’s bed. “Let’s go to bed.” Harry’s voice is tight, but Draco doesn’t think it’s anger, or displeasure—it sounds like the desperate edge of a man hanging onto the shreds of his self-control.
His whole body is responding to Harry’s presence in a way he’s been able to avoid for

Harry sucks in a sharp breath and shifts forward. “Cold,” he murmurs, and Draco chuckles into the side of his neck. “Ohhh, there.”
Draco looks distressed. His hair is messy and he’s in a too-big jumper and all his sharp gleaming edges have been sanded down, and Harry loves him so much his chest aches with it.
just like Potter said, but…
Draco had walked into practice that first day geared up for—harsh words, a snubbing, maybe even a physical altercation? Instead, Potter had shaken his hand enthusiastically, smiled broadly, and earnestly said how pleased he and the team were to have Draco there, and how much they were all looking forward to learning from him, and how
), and when Potter steps through the door, a box of baking supplies floating behind him, Draco is sweating and swearing at his barely-cleaned kitchen, and the cake has tilted so far to the side it’s in danger of simply toppling over.
Draco smirks and stoops for a swift kiss. “See you later,” he says, then whirls to dress himself and get out the door before Harry can tackle him onto the bed.
“Always.”
“I know,” Harry replies, voice small.

Hermione rolls her eyes. “I’ve

Harry’s staring at her, colour high in his cheeks, eyes wide. “Gin,” he says, and he sounds so
now, and all it took to tear down his carefully-constructed facade was witnessing Harry wanking in the shower a few feet away from him. Draco’s not sure where his self-control has gone, but it’s certainly nowhere to be found right now.
Draco sneers. “One of the Travers’ get, no doubt. They never did have any taste—or money. This would have been some distant cousin trying to impress the main branch of the family by overdoing the ward spells, no doubt; I’m not surprised it’s fallen off the record books, who’d want to claim this pile?” He sounds like a complete snob, he knows, but really, the house is hideous.
He couldn’t bear it. Some days he thinks Draco’s presence, his unconditional, constant forgiveness and steady ability to take whatever Harry throws at him, is the only thing keeping Harry even remotely human. Hermione would cry if she heard him say that, and Ron would gruffly deny it, but Harry

He starts to say something, eyes snapping with mirth, but Draco checks the clock above the refrigerator and sucks in a breath. “Bloody hell, Potter, if we don’t get a move on we are going to be
“Fuuuuck,” Draco groans out, wiping his hand on the sofa cushion and winding his arms around Harry’s waist.
Harry can take that all in stride, though;
As much as Draco hates to admit it, it’s a good plan. He begrudgingly admits that maybe Bill knows what he’s doing after all. “Fine, Potter. Do try not to blast everything you see to smithereens, though; I’d imagine the McKilips would like a home to come back to, once it’s cleared out.”
“Come lie down,” Harry says coaxingly; as if he thinks Draco needs to be gentled, to be talked into this, to be soothed.

It surprises Draco, too, by the puzzled frown on his face. “No, of course not. The tests aren’t common, or even really useful most of the time; I didn’t think of them myself until today. The symptoms for an interrupted Lethifold attack can often mimic an acute depressive episode, though, and the chart indicated no lead-up or behavioral changes consistent with MDD, so I was merely coming down to suggest these as another option to add if something like this comes up again.”

Draco strokes him through it, long past the point of discomfort and back into pleasure, coaxing Harry hard again as he slips one finger into Harry’s arse and finds his prostate, massaging it with his finger from the inside and his thumb from the outside. “Again,” he says, voice nearly a whisper, and Harry’s head thrashes back and forth as he spills over his stomach for a second time.
Ginny doesn’t think Harry’s doing it intentionally, but the house is his, and it can tell he’s upset with her—they’d both apologised, but he’s still distant, barely even asking after her day any more let alone sharing details of his own, and he’s spending more and more time out of the house, or crouched at the Floo talking with Hermione under a shroud of privacy charms, and the house is responding.
He points his tongue and presses it inside Harry, just a little at a time, just enough so Harry’s thighs start to shake and his stomach clenches, but Draco knows that no matter how long he does this, Harry won’t come,
She likes not having to think about Harry
So, he picks fights, and watches Malfoy get magnificently, gorgeously riled up, and then heads to the gym to sweat it out and ogle the new bloke from across the room.
Draco slips into the bathroom to change, and by the time he’s out, Harry’s in his bed, facing the far wall.

“Stay behind me,” Potter says firmly, striding off in the indicated direction. Draco’s eyes drift down to the firm, well-muscled arse under the tight trousers Potter prefers while he’s working, but as soon as he catches what he’s looking at he scowls to himself and hurries to catch up.

It’s on strike fifteen that he breaks and starts to cry. Strike twenty has him mewling into the pillow when Draco takes a break to shake his hand out.
But Ron is howling with laughter, utterly incapable of forming words.

Well. Maybe snobby, too. And still pointy, sometimes, if Harry’s being honest, but not nearly as much as he was as a child.

Sighing, he Vanishes the icing, Conjures up a mini-cyclone to sweep the smoke out of the room, and contemplates Vanishing his entire oven for a minute before he shakes his head, opens the door a crack, and casts a spell that should Banish any food while keeping the mechanics intact.
As Harry straightens automatically upon seeing him, Draco makes a point of checking his large silver wristwatch. “And what time do you call this?” he asks sternly, folding his arms over his chest. On a normal day, he’d have stopped to bring Harry home with him at a slightly more reasonable hour, and they’d have gone out to dinner, and then to bed early, but that’s not what Harry needs today, so even though Draco aches to bundle his husband into his arms and not let him go until he’s sobbed out the cares the world keeps laying on his shoulders, he lets his face fall into the mask he’d perfected as a boy.

Harry. What brought this on?
“Shit, I’m so sorry, are you…” Harry trails off when they make eye contact. “Gin, hi. Are you okay? Sorry, I didn’t see you.” He’s got a bag clutched in front him like a shield.

Circumpolar. Always visible.
both sides manage to hit their targets, and Draco swoops down to meet them at the entrance to the lockers, sending each player in to shower and change with a quiet word of encouragement and a pat on the back.
The man glances up as Harry walks past and turns an endearing shade of pink. Harry grins, mood suddenly much improved. He can figure out how to deal with Malfoy tomorrow; surely it won’t be that bad now that he’s gotten his initial list of grievances out.
they encountered to begin to grate. Everyone has a story to tell, a question to ask, a private grief to spill—and Harry has to bear it all, with a patient smile that doesn’t reach his eyes.
“Surely he should be back by now,” Hermione finally bursts out. “Oh, what if something went wrong—what if they’re
At that rather poor choice of words, he shifts and tries to focus on the glossy pages in front of him, but he can’t help but think of how, exactly, he’s gotten himself into this very literal mess.
Potter, yeah, just—”
Harry flicks a lock of hair that’s fallen over his eye and licks at the corner of his mouth, closing his eyes at the dizzying rush Draco’s blood brings him, even when it’s cooled and no longer straight from the source. It fizzes as it absorbs into his own blood, the cool piney tang of the gin Draco had at dinner spiking in his veins.
Draco strokes over his hair in approval, and Harry shivers. “Good. Now. You were home late, and you wouldn’t pick up after yourself, and then you were rude to me. How many do you think that deserves?”
Her shower water goes cold two minutes in, and the stasis charms she drops on food and mugs of tea get cancelled, and her clothes develop snags and tears, even the brand-new stuff. Her shoes go missing, and her socks, and her
The Lake District is gorgeous in the summer, and Draco can’t help but be thankful that this illegal exports case had gotten Robards to grudgingly assign them to this particular beat; they have reason to believe the owner is directly involved, despite the distanced stance he takes to his businesses in public (Draco had been saying and

Last night, though, he’d had a bit too much to drink with Harry out on the terrace—he’d paid a waiter to keep bringing them bottles even though technically they weren’t supposed to be served outside the bar, and the combination of red wine and Harry’s knee pressed against his, Harry’s laugh low in his ear, had given him fractured, confusing dreams, and something had drawn him from his slumber.

argue, you look terrible—we’re here insanely early, you know that, there’s nothing you need to be doing right now.”
The Holyhead Harpies’ talent scout and a representative from the affiliate team, the Glyngarth Gorgons, come calling after the New Year, and Harry could not possibly be more thrilled for her. He knows how badly she wants to play professionally, and when she gets an invite to their training camp in the spring, he practically pushes her out the door, beaming with pride. She worries about leaving him alone, but he waves her off with a laugh.
Potter pants against Draco’s neck as they recover, and Draco finds that he doesn’t want to let Potter go, even though his come is cooling sticky in his pyjamas.

“Look at you,” he says softly, reverently, reaching over and skimming his hand over Harry’s back. He scores his nails down the sweaty skin lightly, and Harry arches his back, grinding further into the pillow under his hips, muttering something that trails off into a hiss, and oh, Draco did
Hermione snaps out of her frozen posture and rushes over to help Ron to the exit, leaving Harry with Malfoy, who glares up at him petulantly. “Well, Potter? Are you going to help me up?”
Draco heaves out a trembling breath as he brushes his thumb along one of Harry’s cheekbones.
“Draco,” Harry says in his ear, and Draco whirls around and stares into Harry’s eyes.

Harry works for another hour, signing off on forms and authorizing requests for consultations and picking at the dinner his secretary left before she took off for the evening. Finally, the silvery paperweight he keeps at the corner of his desk starts buzzing insistently, and he stretches, groaning as his back pops.
“Good. We’ll see how you’re doing after twenty-five, then; if you’ve learned your lesson or not.” And with no further warning, Draco brings his hand down hard over the back of Harry’s thigh.
Draco, for lack of a better word, looks defeated. His eyes are bloodshot, with circles underneath so dark it looks like he’s been punched, and all the light—all the
He’s always been about forgiveness. She hasn’t. But Ginny supposes it doesn’t have anything to do with her, not really.
“Excellent,” Hermione says briskly. “Harry, I think you and Malfoy should go back and gather up the project—all his notes, all his research, any prior attempts or physical evidence that might have been preserved. I’ll come by tomorrow morning and get started.”

Draco’s not sure how Harry managed to talk himself into this gathering, but he’s grateful for his partner’s presence, no longer feeling like he has to watch his back quite so intensively.

“Err. No, I don’t think so? Just made me feel sick for a moment, but I think I’m fine…”
“Be right back,” Potter says jauntily, and Draco feels the mattress move as he gets to his feet.
and every time they meet gazes, he blushes.
Harry signs one of the rooms out, watching as the registration memo flutters up through the ceiling, then he slips into the room after Draco, who’s already stripping out of his Auror garb and Transfiguring his stuffy shirt and trousers into something more appropriate to exercise in. Harry does the same, smiling to himself when Draco huffs at the way he’d thrown his robe off to the side and folds it neatly.
“But?” she forces herself to ask.
Draco tosses the rent shirt to the side—Harry will spell it back together in the morning, probably with plenty of grumbling, Draco knows it’s one of his favorites—then sits back down on the couch, back straight, knees just a few inches apart, hands calmly resting at his sides.
“Well? What do you think?” Ron asks. “Is it Harry’s handwriting?”

As far as what to do next…” and Malfoy smirks, the same one Harry saw in his office before the whole incident with Ron, and now he recognises his reaction for what it is, and good lord, does Malfoy acting like a smug little prat turn him on? “...well, there’s a whole world of possibilities. Where did you want to start? It’s my
Harry asked him about it, once, as Draco sat cross-legged on the floor, Harry on the couch behind him carefully practicing his French-braiding after he’d begged Ginny to teach him. Draco’s always favoured his father, with his skin and his hair and his eyes (although there’s a warmth to them that Lucius never had); didn’t he want to distance himself, to look like his own man?
“I don’t know,” Draco whispers. “I just… It was nice seeing you here. You look so happy. I never see you this happy at work, and it was…it was nice, okay? I know that’s—”

Bloody fuck. Harry beelines for the break room. He just needs a snack, and that will calm the fluttery feeling in his stomach, for sure.
He taps the paperweight twice and it goes still, then stands and gathers his things together before trudging off to the lifts, then to the Floos in the Atrium.
“I know you don’t like me; I don’t know what I’ve done recently to make you so unhappy to spend time in my presence, but really, don’t you have

“Shit,” Potter mutters, crushing them even harder together, and with a few more shuddering thrusts Draco feels Potter come, that big cock twitching and a warm wetness spreading through the fabric.
Potter’s fast on a broom. He’s faster than Draco’s ever seen him when he circles the desk, hauls Draco out of his chair, and shoves him against the wall.

Ginny readjusts herself yet again, rolling cautiously over to one side out of habit—but Harry’s so far away, practically falling off the other side because he’s not used to having space, to being able to spread out, that there’s no chance of her disturbing him.
Their mouths crash together, but Potter gentles the kiss almost immediately, and he sets a steady rocking rhythm against Draco, and between the friction on his cock and Harry’s tongue in his mouth and their magic dancing together, Draco feels like he’s going to pass out.
“Harry,

They manage to slip away from the rest once they get back to the manor, and the air between them is nearly crackling with tension as they ascend the stairs.
Draco pushes down his pants, watching as Harry drops his eyes to his cock and licks his lips. Draco kicks his pants out of the way and steps closer, gripping the base of his cock.
“Woah!” he cries as his feet come out from under him, and Draco instinctively reaches out to grab him before he can fall flat on his arse. “Thanks, Draco. Christ, what was
Harry’s hand sneaks around to Draco’s cock and begins to stroke, long, languorous pulls that are about half the speed of his thrusts into Draco’s arse.
“No, I suppose not,” he mutters, then sneaks another glance over to where Draco is now studiously rubbing some potion over his face. “And, er. You’ve got. Well. You’ve got. Your nipples are pierced?” Oh, he could just

Harry’s not trying to hide this.
He and Harry were in Browne-Heathcote’s foursome, of course, along with one of the Mungo’s board members Draco had noticed at breakfast, and a significant eyebrow raise had Harry engaging him in conversation for the duration of the course while Draco focused on Browne-Heathcote, drawling on about stocks and investments and making cutting little remarks about the accounts managed by the Ministry’s charitable arm until Browne-Heathcote had been drawn into conversation.

“Draco?” Harry says tentatively, reaching out and gently touching Draco’s eyelids. Nothing. “Shit,” Harry curses, eyes fixed on the bitemarks in Draco’s neck, cock twitching even as he scrambles for his wand.
Draco’s hands sneak around to the back of Harry’s head, where he grips tight enough to sting Harry’s scalp, holding him in place. He starts speeding up, long fast thrusts all the way down into Harry’s open throat, in and out with no breaks for Harry to gather himself.

Tilting his head, Draco considers forcing a third orgasm, even presses down a bit harder on Harry’s prostate, but Harry’s eyes are glazed over, so he pulls out carefully and heads into the bathroom for a flannel. He takes care of his own erection quickly—normally, he’d draw it out, but Harry needs his attention now, so he can linger over the memories later on, then steps back into the bedroom and carefully cleans Harry off.
When he finally steps through the front door that evening (and if he rushed the cleanup and maybe left a few things in stasis he’d normally finish before the weekend, well, there’s nobody to scold him but himself, and he can always open late on Monday), he discovers that Harry’s lined the entryway and the staircase up to their room with dainty tealights, in alternating silver and gold, with their tiny flames spelled to match. He smiles as he puts away his cloak and bag and shoves his shoes between their Quidditch boots in the closet—his man has been planning ahead, and nothing on this earth makes Draco feel more special than knowing how much time Harry’s spent thinking about ways to please him.
Even the reference to what must have been an absolutely hellish end of the summer for Draco before their sixth year can’t put Harry off now; he’d been half-hard when Draco started talking, but his dreamy reminiscing got him the rest of the way there. Before he realizes what he’s doing, he’s crossed over to where Malfoy’s assiduously scrubbing shampoo into his hair, crowding him face-first against the wall, but not touching him.
” Draco pulls him upright, tugging and rearranging him until Harry’s straddling his lap, thighs on either side of Draco’s hips.
Just before Harry lowers his head to the rigid outline of Draco’s cock, he looks up. “Did I… Was I good?” he asks, a thread of uncertainty in his voice.
Potter; baking is just like Potions,
And so they didn’t get done. And they don’t get done the next day either, and by then Ginny’s angry about it, and finally on day three she asks Harry when he’s planning on cleaning up, and he tells her it’s

Harry lifts himself onto his forearms and looks down seriously at Draco. “You think they’ll suspect what happened.” He doesn’t wait for Draco to speak. “Do you care?”

“I’ll take whatever help you’d like to provide,” Draco manages, closing his eyes tight as Harry slips to his knees on the floor, pushing Draco’s thighs further apart.

He scowls playfully at her, but allows it. “And how, exactly, do you know what’s on the Head Auror’s daily calendar,
So maybe Draco’s not being entirely fair. He can’t help it; the feel of Potter’s magic sliding over his skin as it retreats is enough to distract him from his often life-or-death critical tasks. Between the constant semi-arousing magic, Potter’s grating cheeriness and insistence on trying to add Draco to his cadre of

” Harry scoffs, kicking Draco’s shin lightly. “If I praised you any more, you’d swell up like a balloon and float away.” Harry gets an odd little smile when he says that, but Draco’s learned to ignore his various quirks.
She sinks into the closest chair, staring at Harry, who’s staring down at his hands. “Are you...” she starts, but she doesn’t know how to finish that sentence—she knows the words, but can’t make herself say them.
“Yes, but I took the liberty of adjusting where we’ll be staying for this mission, and when I went to change the destination, Transport had to move the time up,” Draco replies, eyeing the tumble of neon-bright pants Harry’s now stuffing into his bag. Whoever he was dating that introduced him to those is owed a national debt of gratitude—Draco thinks it was one of the professional Quidditch players that Harry’s paraded in and out of his bedroom over the last year.
Draco fiddles with his hair, pushing a lank strand behind his ear. “Oh, they’ve quite given up on me, I’m afraid to say. They’ve taken to cooking more and more elaborate meals and staring at me after they deliver it, trying to guilt me into eating. It’s just...for so long, I was so consumed by the work it felt that doing
“Ah, shit,” he breathes as he fits his fingers as far around Harry’s girth as he can. “Next time, I want this inside me. I want to pin you down against the couch and ride you until your eyes roll back into your head. I want to get on my knees and shove this so far down my throat I can’t talk for days after. I want to fuck you into the headboard and then eat your arse clean, then do it all over again. Can I, Harry? Would you let me?”

going to let him hear the end of this.
When Draco and Harry decided to get a townhouse together, all their friends predicted it would end in disaster within the month.
Suppressing a shudder at the memory, Draco pastes a no-doubt unconvincing smile as he approaches. “Alright, Potter; Bill put you on this one too?”
Potter, that feels— Wait.

Harry; this building isn’t even two hundred years old. And I had a few great-whatevers who were fond of passing out choice pieces of property as favours. It’s entirely possible this was a gift meant to cultivate a valuable acquaintance, or perhaps even for a lover. We still have a few homes scattered around up here, but I haven’t been.

Harry’s magic brushes against his arm, and Draco shudders a bit, but manages to fold the parchment Harry had sent over into his palm without notice. After he eats, he nods politely at the people he knows, murmurs a few polite remarks about seeing them on the course, and strides from the room, heading down to the Apparition point in the trees they’d been instructed to use to get to the golf course.
Finally, he drops one hand to Draco’s cock, wanking him fast and hard, speeding up his own thrusts to match.

He busies himself with unpacking Harry’s clothes for him, frowning at the wrinkles before he spells them out and hangs everything up. The sight of their clothes side-by-side in the same armoire makes him close his eyes briefly before he turns back to face Harry, who’s now turned onto his stomach and has his face buried into a pillow. “Alright, Potter?”
Circe, but he’d burn the world down for that smile.
“Every time we’re sharing a room.” Harry hisses as Draco’s nails dig in. “
He focuses when he hears Harry’s footsteps, and barely stops himself from jerking an arm (the way Harry’s silvery magic has him bound, it would
“You look stunning like this,” Draco says approvingly, circling around Harry and admiring the way the light blue silks bring out the undertones in his hair. “I do so love when you make yourself pretty for me.”
Things with Malfoy don’t calm down, not really. They never get to the point where administration has to get involved, and their blowouts go down to once every week or so instead of almost daily, but they’re no less vicious.
“It has to cool now,” Potter says; he always turns a bit pink when he’s drinking, and Draco admires the flush high on his cheekbones. “It’ll probably take half an hour before we can ice it without the cake tearing.”
Harry’s eyes feel like they’re about to fall out of their sockets. “You gave it a…? So wait, does that mean…? No, don’t tell me! Don’t tell me anything at all!” He’s suddenly assaulted with a rush of images, of Malfoy and
Harry only has two more shifts to get through until he has a much-needed long weekend, and it’s that thought that gets him up and out of bed in time the next morning—he’d perhaps allowed Ron to talk him into a few too many pints the night before.
Draco terrorizes every Department Head on rota; everyone gets a visit twice a month, and it’s obvious who’s due for their bimonthly bollocking by the way the tension on that floor ratchets up and the activity reaches an almost frenetic pace. It never helps, though; there’s always some inconsistency, some little mistake that Draco takes savage glee in pointing out.

instead of subjecting Teddy to their squabbles, or having to put together a complicated schedule just to avoid one another.
Ron rolls his eyes. “Don’t you think I’d be a bit more upset if the bloody thing was still active?”
When he wakes up the next morning, he’s warm, and his head feels floaty, and his magic is practically
Harry carefully puts his fork down. There’s a strained silence for a moment, Ron steadily downing his newest beer while Harry most certainly
Draco stills under him.
When he finally pulls back, Harry’s dazed and his lips are numb, and he’s pretty sure his erection is going to leave a bruise on Malfoy’s thigh where it’s pushing against him.
Draco’s breath hitches, and his fingers inch closer to Harry’s crack. “You—” He swallows. “When you’re— You think of me?”
It’s harder for him to claim
“He’s the only one who would call me this, anyway.”
. You should have heard some of the witches in Liaisons, Ronnie—they didn’t know whether to swoon because here’s Malfoy acting out one of his own bloody books, or cry because they think it means he’s off the market for them! You stick around too long and you get whiplash. Anyway, they sent me up here to get the scoop, since we’re friends. Anything I’m allowed to report back?”
Harry reaches the edge first, and he pulls back enough to watch himself come all over Draco’s lower back, gripping Draco’s hips tightly as he fucks forward for a few more thrusts, relishing the too-sensitive feel of wet skin on his spent cock. Draco’s gasping for breath by the time Harry brings his attention back, but it only takes a few more strokes and one particularly harsh pull on one of his piercings until he’s coming all over the shower wall with a howl.
” Harry rasps out, flopping back against the pillows, and Draco’s cock twitches. He ignores it, dropping a kiss onto Harry’s sweaty forehead before he heads to the bathroom for a flannel and to refill the water glass.
Harry’s throat is working around his cock, and Draco waits until Harry’s blinking rapidly up at him before he slides out. Harry sputters and gasps, taking in great heaving breaths, and Draco only gives him a few seconds to recover before he pushes his way in again.
Draco counts to ten this time. “It’s not a

Harry responds instantly, moaning into Draco’s mouth and winding his arms around Draco’s waist. They kiss for long minutes, hands roaming over wet skin, until Harry pulls back and rests his head on Draco’s shoulder, heaving in great gasps of air.

Waving a hand, Harry sets him to rights before Draco can even cry out, and he relaxes back into the comforting embrace of Harry’s magic. He still watches the candle, but his eyes are half-closed now, and he feels—safe. It’s not close enough to hurt him, and anyway, Harry’s right there. Harry’s always right there.
Because— Well. Harry’s wanking. Draco can hear it now, over the sound of the shower; the
Harry groans. “Yeah. Just tired. Ron had me out until after two last night; some fight with Hermione. I didn’t even drink, although he had more than enough for the two of us—I’m just bloody exhausted. What time is it?”
It’s a calculation Harry tries to get right every time. He never has. He doesn’t want to, so Draco won’t let him.

Ginny attempts a smile, hoping she doesn’t look as ill as she feels. She hasn’t seen him up close since she left Grimmauld Place. She steps back to get away from the doorway and darts a glance over Harry’s shoulder—sure enough, Draco Malfoy is exiting the shop, those sharp grey eyes pinned on the tableau she and Harry are making. “No, I’m fine, no harm done.”

It’s like the air is sucked out of the room all at once, and as they stare at each other across the desk, Draco watches Potter’s pupils expand.

“I should probably go,” she says finally. “I’m going to...get my stuff, head back to the Burrow.”
He hesitates outside the door, though, just long enough to hear Ron say, “He’ll get it eventually, you know. Hermione’s convinced it’s only a matter of days. Hey, look, speaking of Hermione—we’ve got a pub night planned for Friday. You should come along; you can tell me if it looks like she’s warming up to me. I know you said it

She was used to the Wizarding World, to Diagon Alley and its one or two options for anything one might need. Wheezes had been the first new shop in decades.
“It’s...oh, Harry,” Hermione says, eyes filling with tears. “It’s a bonding spell, an old one—one of those repulsive little hexes the Old Families used to use on their young daughters who were not as enthusiastic about their arranged marriages as the grooms wanted them to be. It isn’t permanent, thank
the truth of that settle into Harry, in the way his body tenses, then relaxes, sagging forward and letting Draco keep him up.

When Draco’s on all fours and Harry’s fucking him from behind, he likes when Harry pulls his hair back so hard and so tight that his neck is arched to the point of discomfort. He likes feeling pinned in place, he’d said once, likes feeling like if he tried to reposition he’d hurt himself, likes letting Harry decide exactly when and how he gets to move.
“Well then,” Draco says grandly, gesturing with the half-empty bottle. “Shall we decamp to the sitting room?”
In the end, they’re on time, but only just. The icing is lumpy in spots, not nearly the glossy confection Draco had envisioned when he cooked up this ridiculous plan, but Teddy looks delighted anyway, hugging them both hard around their knees and screeching about how

Harry stops a couple feet away from Draco, just out of arm’s reach, and the candle pauses obediently with him.

The ward rooms are shielded and spelled to the teeth with monitors; it’s the only place in the Ministry Dark spells can be performed, and the staff Healer has a Portkey that heats up and activates within 45 seconds if a serious injury is registered in any of the rooms. The trainees spend the most time in these rooms, where any consequences of miscast spells or poorly-constructed Shield charms can be kept to a minimum, but they’re available to any Auror (and certain levels of clearance within MLEP) to practice. There are programs that can be activated for solo practice, which is what most of the Aurors prefer, but Harry and Draco like to work together; Harry because the automated programs are too easy and he’s defeated them all, and Draco because he was able to predict the spell patterns in the first three and refused to even bother with the rest.

He finds himself looking at his watch repeatedly as he wolfs down lunch, and as he’s reviewing the care plan for a patient they’re about to send up to Janus Thickey, and as he’s scrawling in notes on a new admit’s chart. He’s not distracted, of course he’s not, he’s wholly focused on his work and would never endanger his patients, but there’s a little bit of his brain ticking away at the back, wondering

By the time he’s got his shirt down, though, there’s nobody at the door. Harry shrugs and crams his belongings into his bag, dodging around a group of men who have decided to hold a very loud conversation right at the doorway as he bolts out.

They’d put it behind them, and the candles that Harry always has lit in the playroom stayed on the dresser on the far side of the room, and that had been that until Draco first tried to say he was interested in trying again.
taking the piss. All that reassurance Draco needed at first means Harry has no real choice but to accept it when Draco murmurs over how gorgeous he looks in purple, or strokes over his muscles with admiration.
“You say that every time,” Harry husks out, coughing a bit, and Draco realizes he must have been speaking out loud. He does that after he comes, sometimes, and Harry loves teasing him for it, although right now Harry doesn’t seem up to talking much.
They settle into their usual seats, on either end of the vast comfortable couch in the middle of the room, and Draco’s about to launch into just how much a hash of things he’d made earlier in the day, but before he can even open his mouth, Potter sits up and leans closer to him, eyes bright and intent. “So. You haven’t...I mean. Do you remember what my terms were, if I won?”

There are lines between his eyebrows, and he’s got a jumper on that makes him look warm and cuddly, and Ginny thinks that maybe bedtime could wait a little longer.
.” She says this last bit loudly, and Harry can see Draco wince.
Potter chuckles into his neck. “I’ll say,” he says. “Is that for me?”
Draco’s distracted all day, watching the clock so he knows when Harry will be out of the office and he can sneak down before the meeting-that-isn’t; luckily, Magical Games and Sports is suffering a post-World Cup planning hangover, and the offices are quiet, his employees walking around in a daze that can only come from being suddenly relieved of the object of their intense focus for the past six months, so he doesn’t have to worry about missing anything important.
Harry puts his lips to Draco’s ear. “Good boy, Draco. Come now.”

They always stop talking when she walks into the room, and she knows they’re talking about what they were doing, when they were gone that horrible last year.

so that every thrust brings Draco’s cock against Harry’s prostate.
yes, do I ever need a drink. Let’s go.”
“Guess I will,” Draco says softly, getting a hand on the back of Potter’s head and pulling him down for another kiss.
Malfoy climbs on top of him, a vaguely frightening glint in his eye, and gets his hands in Harry’s hair before kissing him again, and really,
“Shit!” Harry says, too loud, as he spins around to meet Draco Malfoy’s annoyed grey gaze. “Merlin, Malfoy, you scared me. And I wasn’t— That wasn’t— Urgh. Never mind, yes, we’ll try to keep it down.”
Harry opens the door and sticks his head out. “What’s going on out here??” he bellows, catching Christopher’s eye through the chaos. “Didn’t I send you home?”
He holds Harry there for a little bit, feeling Harry swallow around him, milking out the last of his orgasm, and when Harry’s shaking, probably desperate for air, Draco finally lets him go at the same time as he pushes his leg up against Harry’s cock.
Two hours later, and he’s barging into the Psychiatric Department Head’s office without so much as a knock, trailed by a stream of paper memos, all chattering for his attention.

Draco idly runs his hand over his own torso, stopping to pinch his nipples and scratch along his side, and soon it’s Harry who’s panting, shifting and trying to rub his thighs together, anything for some friction on his cock. Draco can see his biceps bulge as he tries to pull his arms out from where they’re bound behind his back, but the ties are magicked shut; he’s not getting free without Draco’s help unless he uses his word.
He’s practically sweating again by the time he slides into the booth at The Ship & Shovell, and Ron frowns at him. “Alright?” he enquirers, sliding a blessedly-still-foamy pint across the table.

“Sorry,” Draco finally says. Harry keeps his eyes closed and makes an inquiring sound. “Sorry I… I know that it. That I’m. It’s just.” He trails off, and Harry twists his neck and looks up.
“Aw, c’mon, Malfoy—just a peek? Are you doing another one about the Cursebreaker and the Unspeakable? That all looks Latin—it’s gotta be, right? What’s the title of that…

Letting loose a breath he wasn’t aware he was holding, Draco moans long and loud as Harry pushes in, feeling the wax on his legs start to crack off and fall to his stomach.
Finally, Draco feels like he’s teased them both for long enough. “Open up,” he orders, and Harry’s mouth drops obediently, as wide as he can go. He blinks languidly up at Draco with eyes that are by now almost all pupil, with just the thinnest ring of green iris.

Harry figures he’s got a little over ten minutes for Draco to finish his standard two mile warm-up, so he stretches a little and sits staring into space while he waits. His eyes catch on Draco occasionally as he passes him around the circuit, absently noting that he’s made grey joggers today, not black, and his vest doesn’t have sleeves.

He’ll get an earful about that tomorrow—it’s the third set he’s ruined this month from pouncing on Draco too quickly before they’re able to put down protective spells that will spare the fabric from bloodstains, and Draco insists on buying the most expensive cotton he can find. He finds himself smiling, thinking about the lecture he’s sure to receive, both for that and the absolutely ruined couture Draco’s still wearing—the alternative, now that he’s backed down from the edge of his bloodlust, is too awful to contemplate.

sort had been established was obvious; he and Harry compared notes each evening, about who had approached them that day and what they’d said in a coy attempt to instigate a fight.
Ginny sighs and tips her head back against his shoulder, closing her eyes. Her stomach is still roiling, but it’s not from Harry’s tickles any longer. “I just hope I don’t freeze, you know—like, get up in the air and forget what colours my team is in, or something horrible like that. It’s going to be so different.”

Just. When Draco is
Draco’s hair is long, too, but he didn’t come by it in the same careless, relaxed way Harry did. He keeps it the exact same length Lucius did, although he’s stopped straightening it, letting his natural waves come through. He’d been shorn during his short stint in Azkaban (he’d only been in for about five weeks, and Harry doesn’t know what happened to get him out so quickly; isn’t sure he wants to know, to be honest), and Harry had seen him with the barest hints of regrowth in the photos in the paper, but by the time they re-met at the Institute, it was long again, glossy and thick and falling halfway to his waist in a shining white-blonde sheet.

It’s warm—warmer than anything Draco’s ever really felt touching his skin before, and his arms tense, but the pressure of the cuffs pulling his shoulders back reassures him, and he relaxes back into the table without a sound.
Harry almost swoons in relief when the spells swirl purple over Draco’s head—faint, barely there, but purple nonetheless, not the grey he was dreading. He heals Draco’s wounds and picks him up, both sickened and fascinated by the way Draco’s head lolls back over Harry’s arm, Vanishing the ruined bedsheets and replacing them with a new set before gently settling Draco back against the pillows.
He slides up along Harry’s shaft slowly, then licks over the head until Harry’s panting harshly. Draco pulls back and drags his nails along Harry’s inner thighs, smirking at Harry’s hiss. “You have such a

only once...have you been hexed? Did he put something in your food?” Harry raises his wand, poised to cast diagnostics.
The water is running down over his back, some of it dripping from his hair into his eyes, but Draco barely notices, so consumed is he with making Harry shiver and shake and moan into the arm he’s using to cushion his head against the wall. He licks around the edges, kneading his hands into Harry’s arse the whole time, and points his tongue into Harry’s arse as deep as he can go.

“Anything,” Draco muses, but almost immediately he steps back, ignoring Harry’s whine in order to turn him so he’s pressed face-first against the wall. When he drops to his knees and parts Harry’s cheeks, he smirks a bit at Harry’s cursing.
The revelry ends earlier than last night’s, when someone knocks over a lamp and scatters glass all over the floor and everyone is politely but firmly escorted out by the clubhouse staff so they can clean. Draco manages to slip the night manager a rather large tip as an apology, and he thinks he’s gotten away with it, but then he turns around and Harry’s right there, looking down at him with shiny green eyes, and for a second Draco thinks they’re about to totally blow their cover, because Harry is
Draco reaches out, and Harry falls forward into his arms, burying his head into Draco’s neck, right next to where he’d bit him earlier. Merlin, he hadn’t even
Around the sixth hole, Draco had casually dropped in that he was looking into diversifying into potions ingredients, and Browne-Heathcote had spent the remainder of the round doing what was no doubt his best to manipulate Draco into investing in his company. By the end of the eighteenth hole, Draco had wrangled an invitation to Browne-Heathcote’s private room in the clubhouse to discuss some

to take that one last, irrevocable step and make Draco a part of him, permanently. Harry has to hold himself back every time they do this, has to pull away far sooner than he wants and heal Draco quickly before his instincts take over and he does something he can’t undo.
And when they’re doing this…
“Draco,” Harry sighs, sounding aggrieved. “We need to talk about it, you know.”
“...do we need to talk about that?” Harry offers, petting along the back of Draco’s neck.
Harry’s eyes are darkening already, but the green still shines through, and Draco tilts his head, holding eye contact until Harry blinks. He smiles, and Draco has no choice but to smile back.

Harry didn’t come to bed last night at all.

“No,” Hermione says firmly, shoving him back towards his office. “You have a perfectly capable set of deputies. There’s no reason for you to be here for this part.” Her voice softens as Harry hesitates in the doorway. “Take Draco home. He needs a meal, and a rest, and you both need to talk. You’ll need to be able to work together if we’re going to figure this out. Clear the air. Be ready to get to it tomorrow.”
It leaves her Quidditch gear alone, thankfully.
Harry’s nostrils are flaring now as he struggles to take in enough air, and his eyelashes are fluttering. His face is a mess; blotchy and covered in spit and precome and—is that…?

light that bob near the ceiling, but the room is far from dark; there’s a ring of candles of all colours around the perimeter, floating halfway up the walls. Harry’s naked, too, and he’s spelled their saw horse into a large, comfortable-looking table. Draco can see that there are cuffs attached to all four corners, and he shivers slightly, then puts his gaze down to the floor and waits.

Harry curses to himself, then sits back in his chair with a groan. Hermione takes the visitor chair opposite, and he does
piercings. Tattoos, too, but not as many people in the magical world have those; likely because of stigma associated with the Dark Mark, which Harry thinks is a shame, because magical tattoos are really something special.

“So…” Harry starts hesitantly, once their starters are delivered and Ron is halfway through his second pint. “Are you doing alright? You seemed fine yesterday, but…” When Harry had arrived home from his head-clearing alone time at the Ministry (where he had spoken very firmly to himself about letting his imagination run wild about
when he found that after graduation he’d gravitated to the emergency department—throughout his training years he assumed he’d end up in Magical Bugs, or maybe the Dai Llewellyn Ward—somewhere he could really dig into a case, tease out the intricacies and implement a healing plan, somewhere relatively peaceful. He found, though, that the fast pace and ever-changing nature of Emergencies suited him; his instincts were as on-point as they’d been his whole life, and the rush of bringing someone successfully through an emergency spell-surgery rivaled that he got when catching the Snitch.
“I’m not trying to

Draco; he’d left him there in his stained shirt with blood drying on his neck, looking like what he actually is—the victim of a brutal attack.
One of Draco’s hands flutters around to Harry’s throat, where he presses down lightly, just enough to feel his cock when he thrusts in. It’s not the right angle for it, but if he had Harry flat on his back and was fucking his mouth from on top of him, he’d be able to see the bulge he’s making.
Draco had been quiet before he answered, and Harry had been afraid he’d been offensive, but finally Draco finally said, “I want people to

“Fuck off, Malfoy,” comes Harry’s muffled reply from where he’s half-buried in his wardrobe, tossing trousers and shirts out behind him with abandon. Draco winces as something from Valentino’s latest line lands half-crumpled on the bed; Harry’s never known how to tend to his couture.

Hermione’s hand covers his own, stilling his fingers from their nervous tapping. “You can’t blame yourself for this,” she says firmly. “After all, you wouldn’t blame
When pressure starts to build in his stomach, he forces himself to stop and step back. Harry lets his balls go with a filthy slurp and grins up at him; he knows exactly why Draco needs a break, the brat.

Hell, he’s even
The worst part is, Draco doesn’t blame him for it. Sometimes, Harry thinks he likes it. He’s seen the look Draco gets as he gasps and shakes apart in Harry’s arms, as his limbs get cold and his vision dims as his own blood leaves him. He’d let Harry drain every ounce of his life’s essence, and with his last breath he’d be gasping Harry’s name as he comes. This knowledge makes it that much harder for Harry to control himself.
Harry tilts his head and watches him wordlessly for a moment, and Draco realizes he’s trembling, not from arousal but from nerves, or maybe even fear—it’s hard to tell when he’s this far down—and it’s with a mixture of disappointment and relief when Harry shakes his head minutely and the candles slide back to where they were.
“I believe we’ve discussed how you’re supposed to address me,” Draco says lowly into Harry’s ear, shoving him further against the wall and biting down on his neck when Harry whimpers at the crush of his face into the wood. “Don’t you remember? You’ll keep a

Finally, the clock ticks over to half two, and Draco slips down to the DMLE, winking at Harry’s secretary, who rolls her eyes and pointedly casts several Silencing charms at Harry’s door (so perhaps they’d forgotten a time or two; Draco can’t help it that he gets
Draco had brought up the idea of Harry wearing a cock ring all day a few weeks ago, and he still gets hard thinking about how Harry’d held him down that night and fucked him so slowly he was crying and begging for release at the end.
It’s clear now that there’s no way Draco could have had anything to do with the spate of murderers that have plagued Wizarding London over the last weeks; despite the fact that every corpse that’s turned up has been, either personally or professionally, a threat to Draco’s livelihood or freedom, it’s clear to Harry from the poorly-disguised panic in the letters that Draco has nothing to do with any of it. Not directly, at least.
“What—” Draco interjects, furrowing his brows. “Why. Harry, come on. I understand that you’re still upset with me, but really, is it necessary to—”
Malfoy blinks at him for a minute, then leads them outside. Harry follows, docile and exhausted from his outburst.
“Self-involved wanker,” Harry mutters, shifting a bit and settling down into Draco’s lap, dozing a bit. It’s not exactly comfortable, with their skin smeared with Harry’s spend and Draco’s cock softening inside him, but sex with Draco always leaves him filled with lassitude and a desire to just lie there and let Draco pet and soothe him until he regains his energy. “I shouldn’t encourage this.”
He abuses Harry’s nipples until Harry’s voice is hoarse from crying out and chanting apologies. There have been nights where this was enough, this was all it took to get the word out and send Harry to a sweet, peaceful sleep, but it’s not going to be tonight, so Draco steps back and rips Harry’s shirt apart from the collar, leaving Harry slumping forward into the wall and shivering at the sudden chill.
Potter sucks off his cock and glances up, meeting Draco’s eye with a wink. “Come on, Malfoy; don’t just

Eyeing the pile of memos on his desk, he considers that today may be a day he needs
“Why is he writing to you at home?” she says, crossing her arms to disguise the tremble in her hands.
Draco throws every diagnostic spell he knows at Potter, but they all come back clean. He frowns, but Potter clearly isn’t hurting, so finally he shrugs. “Lucky once again, it looks like. I don’t see anything. We’ll still have to record that it happened, but maybe the stone was so warped it wasn’t able to properly defend itself.”
“Ahh,” Draco hisses, twisting his fingers just a bit inside Harry and pressing down on his prostate again.
“Ah—always needing to be the centre of attention, much like its namesake?” Harry says teasingly.
Well, now it’s his turn.
yes. I always think about— Well, I think about this. What if you woke up and saw me. What if you woke up and came in and joined me just as I was—” Draco swivels his hips and plasters them together, and Harry cuts himself off to moan loudly.
It also helped when he was in Auror training. Everyone cut their hair short in the corps, the men and women both, and it made Harry feel like part of a team, like he was just a cog in a machine, an important one to be sure but not the
Draco glances at his watch, then wanders to the window to peer out. “Only half four. Take a nap if you’d like; there’s plenty of time before dinner, and all we have left to do here is get the spells out into the gardens and any outdoor seating areas, which we really should do tomorrow when it’s not about to get dark. We can do the golf course tomorrow as well, and then that’s it until the tournament starts and Browne-Heathcote shows up.” He frowns a bit as he stares out over the gardens and fells. “You know...there’s a painting at the Manor that I would swear has this exact view. I wonder if we used to own this?”
After a couple of years, he and Harry are rubbing along quite nicely, though. It had surprised them both, how little they actually argued; Harry likes cooking but hates dishes, and Draco
He strokes the words on the parchment, then sends off a request for a muscle-relaxant potion. Normally he doesn’t take them, preferring to allow his body to heal and recuperate naturally, but Harry needs him, and he needs to be at top form.
He’s already headed towards the door, hoping Maintenance has restocked the shampoo with the type he likes, when Draco replies with a quiet, “Yes,” and hurries to catch up.

Draco sighs and ducks his head. “I know,” he mutters sulkily. “I just… It makes me so
“Fuck!” Potter curses as he slips and falls flat on his arse.
Finally, with just two hours to go on Harry’s shift, Draco shows up. He walks into Harry’s office with his typical sneer, but he looks tired and wan, and he’s got dark circles under his eyes.

to do with how Potter feels in his arms, or with how their magic is eagerly tying together with each touch that sometimes feels closer to a caress. His strictly-enforced personal space is crumbling with each passing minute, and Draco can’t bring himself to get angry about it, not when Potter is warm, and muscular, and smells so nice.
“Sure,” Harry says drowsily, biting at Draco’s fingers when he draws them up to trace over his face.
and Harry, inexplicably, gets his temper up.
Draco Malfoy’s post-war journey is probably one of the strangest, Harry muses as he watches Malfoy snatch the books closer and hide their covers with a glare. The entire Malfoy family had slithered out of any punishments (to this day, Harry isn’t sure how, and he doesn’t think Minister Shacklebolt knows either), and Lucius and Narcissa very publicly donate to all the right charities and attend all the right events—Harry’s even greeted them at fundraisers before, with a smile pasted to his face and his teeth grinding themselves to dust as he trades inane small talk with a man who’s tried to kill him multiple times.

She leans up and kisses him, slow and deep, and he sighs against her and pulls her closer. They stay like that for a minute, until finally Ginny pushes him back. “Don’t take too long,” she says, winking and waggling her eyebrows at him until he laughs.
Potter’s got his whole weight crushing into Draco now, mouthing lazily at Draco’s neck as he catches his own breath.
Harry hates himself just a little bit more when he can’t stop himself from licking along Draco’s skin, lapping up the fast-fading flavour. He feels Draco shiver under him, and his cock twitches when one of Draco’s hands winds into his hair, pulling just enough to sting.
Harry leans over his desk and pats her arm. “He’ll be fine, ‘Mione. Against all appearances, Malfoy apparently knows what he’s doing, and...honestly? I think Ron took the whole thing rather well, don’t you?”
His hand goes lower, squeezing Harry’s firm, muscled arse, and finally he traces his fingers over where Harry’s holding the toy. “Harry… God, Harry, can I? Will you let me?” He sounds desperate, he knows it, but he can’t bring himself to care, especially when Harry chokes out a desperate
Potter every time she talks to someone.
Malfoy’s quiet for a minute, looking him over. Harry shifts, uncomfortable under his regard—Malfoy’s gaze has always been disturbingly direct, his grey eyes piercing, and Harry used to love being the centre of his attention; now, it just reminds him of things he’d rather leave in the past.

Harry moves up the arch of Draco’s neck, biting once over his Adam’s apple. The air between their bodies is humid and warm, and the small of Harry’s back is slick with sweat as he grinds against Draco. “I want you to put your fingers in me,” he says into Draco’s ear, drawing out a full-body shudder. “You’re so good with your hands. Do you think you can make me come, just like that? I bet you can.”

pants, examining his bookshelves and poking through his photos, and well, Harry has no choice but to abandon the food and push Draco onto the couch for another round of enthusiastic snogging.
When it happens again the next time—Harry keeping a candle nearby, a few inches closer to Draco than before—Draco realizes what’s happening. It’s a good plan; Harry must be operating under the assumption that if Draco can relax with the candles coming infinitesimally closer each time they play, eventually he’ll be relaxed to allow it close enough for what they want and they’ll both be able to enjoy themselves, instead of Draco breaking out in a sweat and sobbing like he did the first time they tried. He’d almost worked himself into a panic attack before Harry could even tip the candle over his torso, and had been so distressed he couldn’t even safeword.

One evening, the silver candle is half a foot from Draco as Harry pins him by the throat and fucks him until he’s sobbing, and Draco had barely flinched when the candle came to a stop so close to his skin, and he knows in the back recesses of his mind that it’s time.
Harry breaks the silent with a wet laugh, drawing back and getting to his feet, turning away to discreetly wipe at his eyes. “You’re far too thin, Draco. You look like you haven’t eaten a proper meal in years. What happened to those elves of yours?”

They must have gotten the asking price right.” His voice is glum despite his attempt to sound casual; he’s not fooling his friends for a moment, he can tell.
Sighing, Harry gestures into the sitting room. “Look. Stop being a prat, and come and eat some of this breakfast that

Draco’s a deep sleeper, normally; it’s why he didn’t mind taking the bed under the window, as light and sound don’t normally disturb him. He wakes at the exact same time every day, no alarm necessary, and once he falls asleep he’s out until his internal clock brings him back.

He doesn’t mean it, not really. Despite everything, Lucius is still his father, and Draco’s love for him is more complex now than when he was a child, but it’s still there. Lucius’ attempt to disown him when he joined the Aurors had backfired; the Malfoy magic would not allow its only direct heir to be removed from the bloodline, and the repercussions on Lucius’ health had been immediate and severe. Just one more of his father’s own failings that he laid at

he’s talked with Ron and Hermione about this.
“...do you mean it?” Harry asks.
He noses around for a bit and finally tracks Draco down in the library, curled up in one corner of the enormous sofa, glasses low on his nose as he flips through a magazine. Harry flops down onto his stomach on the cushions, rearranging himself until his head is pillowed on Draco’s thigh and the magazine has been abandoned. Draco starts running his fingers through his hair, and Harry sighs and shuts his eyes, feeling the tension of the day fleeing from his shoulders.
Because that’s the problem, isn’t it? Part of Harry
Harry’s properly sobbing now, sucking in air desperately through his nose, his whole body shaking, and Draco grits his teeth, pressing his fingers into Harry’s skin as he fucks his face harder.

his fault, despite what Hermione said at lunch. All of it—the murders, the public outcry, the position Draco finds himself in now, having to come to the Ministry in disguise, under a false name.
Draco, sensibly, keeps his wand up and ready as he cautiously steps into the house. The magic presses down on him, and to his annoyance, he finds himself drawing closer to Potter, who gives him a quick glance, mouth drawn down in sympathy. The strain must be showing on his face, then. Splendid. “Let’s get going,” he mutters, cocking his head and closing his eyes. “I think...to the left, first.”
Nope. He shuts that entire train of thought down firmly, then stands. “Well. All’s well that ends well, then, so thrilled you’re just fine. I just remembered I have to, er, pop over to the Ministry, some paperwork I forgot...I’ll see you both later?” He hastens to the fireplace, and as he tosses the Floo powder in and calls out for the private connection to his office, he hears Hermione pick up the conversation.

Draco’s quiet for a minute, tracing over a bright red spiral on his upper thigh. It stings, and his skin prickles.
Browne-Heathcote is out on the terrace, drinking already (as are most of the people in the room, to be honest), laughing loudly with two men that Draco vaguely recognises from the board at Mungo’s. He files their faces away to examine via Pensieve later; it’s not worth trying to place their names now, not unless Browne-Heathcote spends more time with them.

The transformation back is relatively quick, but when Draco cancels the adjustments to his clothing, he’s sweating and clenching his jaw. Harry is only too familiar with how Polyjuice feels, and he hands over the pain-relieving potion he’d thought to grab in advance of this meeting.
Draco, and I’m worried. You need sunlight, and rest, and three squares. You need someone to fuss over you a bit.”
When Harry wakes up, he opens his eyes and immediately regrets it. Groaning, he tries to shove a nearby pillow over his head, but instead something solid hits him in the cheek. “Why?” he croaks, then sits up and grabs at the offending item, bringing it close to his face and squinting.
Two hours later, and Malfoy and Ron are mirror images of frozen despair in Harry’s office. Malfoy is silent and ashen, while Ron is muttering under his breath, eyes wide and fixed on a far point in the distance.
“Right, because you’re well-known for your grace,” Draco says drily, releasing him as soon as he’s sure Potter is steady.
“Harry?” Draco rasps, and Harry’s at his side in an instant, sitting on the bed next to him and holding a flask to Draco’s lips, helping him drink.
“Salazar,” Draco groans after he finishes the third dose, pushing himself up a bit further on the pillows. His lips are back to their normal rosy hue, and he’s got colour in his cheeks again—well, as much colour as he usually has, at least. Harry can smell the rush of blood under Draco’s skin and has to push down the little curl of lust it evokes. “How long was I out for?”
Ron frowns at him. “Of course he didn’t. We woke up, verified the bond was fully broken, had a perfectly pleasant breakfast, and I came straight home. Absolutely nothing out of the ordinary.”
“You’re right,” Ron interrupts his musing as they round a corner. “I do appreciate you coming. And I’m sure that soon we’ll both be a little less...awkward...and you can have your weekends back, instead of going everywhere with us like some sort of weird seventeenth-century chaperone. Merlin,

Harry had never made a conscious decision to stop keeping his hair so military-short, but after a few months of therapy, after he quit the Aurors and focused on redoing Grimmauld into a home that brought him peace and joy whenever he walked in the door, he noticed that his curls were back, and from there he just let it go on. Then, he noticed that with every inch it grew past his chin, he looked less and less like James Potter, less like a living monument to a man who would never reach the age Harry now was, who had been mythologized past the point of humanity; and, well, he liked that too, liked not having people see his parents as the first thing they noticed when they looked at him.

Harry leers at him, and Draco shivers.
“It’s fine. I’m going to get ready for bed; do endeavor to not hurt yourself while I’m gone,” he replies waspishly, fleeing to his bedroom for a few minutes to gather himself.

Ginny takes her time in the shower, luxuriating in the heat as it sinks into her muscles. When she steps out of the bathroom, though, their bedroom is still empty.
He rolls onto his side, and Draco arranges them so they’re curled into each other. “Is it always like that?” Harry asks after a moment, dragging his hand down Draco’s side and noting the shiver that triggers.

Malfoy turns slowly and crosses his arms, raising an eyebrow. “If you think there’s
Harry blinks at her. “When did you get promoted to my job?” he asks, grinning a little.

Harry’s breathing hard again as Draco comes back to himself, and Draco can see the trembling in his muscles—he’s holding himself very still, likely in an effort to keep himself from spelling the cock ring off and taking himself in hand.

Draco snorts inelegantly. “No, Harry. It was
He flops face-first onto the bed next to Harry, who directs cleaning spells over both of them. They catch their breath in silence for a while, then Draco props himself up and smirks down at Harry. “Well?”
“Right,” Potter says, and Draco can see him squaring his shoulders out of the corner of his eye. “Look, maybe you should hang back and let me go first; you can keep an eye out for the stone, and I can take care of whatever obstacles the house throws at us.”
Harry had stopped, then, and Draco had turned to face him, one eyebrow raised in question. “Care to make it interesting?” he’d offered, and there was something new in his gaze.
. Do you want to try some?” He’s eager, suddenly, to prove it to Potter.
Harry had asked her opinion through every stage of the redecorating process, though; next came the bedsheets and duvet, then the colour of the walls throughout the entire house, the length and shade of curtains, should he get the sofa reupholstered? And Ginny had done her best, and Hermione and Ron had chipped in too, and slowly but surely Grimmauld Place turned into a home, somewhere Ginny was spending more time at than the Burrow these days.
Not that he would.

Draco at any opportunity, Draco might be more amenable to this horrid
Smiling, he glances to his left, where Draco’s sprawled out, one hand resting over his head. Harry lets his eyes drago up Draco’s torso, eyes blurring and refocusing as the new life rushing through his body settles. It always takes a few minutes, after he finishes drinking, for him to settle back into his own skin; he feels almost like he’s vibrating at first.
They set a date—well, Harry does, by sneaking past all the protective enchantments on Draco’s calendar and adding an entry himself, the bastard—and when the day arrives, Draco’s practically vibrating with anticipation from the moment he wakes up.
He can’t stop thinking about it.
“I’ll be proud of you even if you throw the Quaffle directly into your own hoops,” Harry says staunchly, and that sets Ginny off into another fit of laughter, and that sets

trip on the pile of clothes he’d left on the ground the night before.
His office is quiet, except for the fucking ticking clock, and then there’s a light touch along the back of his head. “Okay,” Draco says, quietly, voice low and soothing. “Okay, Harry. I’ll see you at home.”
Harry’s hand covers his, and Draco stills. “Fears aren’t always rational in how they manifest,” he says quietly, and Draco closes his eyes briefly, letting himself be soothed. “You know I get about the woods. Remember how I almost ruined Beltane last year? It isn’t your
“Noted,” Seamus responds. “It was okay, then? I’ve heard he’s less intolerable than he used to be. Did you learn any new tricks?” He waggles his eyebrows. Harry sighs and tries to focus on the paperwork from last week he’s been putting off.
Ears ringing and eyes burning, Harry climbs back to his feet and rushes over to where Ron and Malfoy are supine on their backs. “
The second day out on the links is just as interminable as the first was, but Draco remembered his sunblock spell in time today, and he’s apparently passed some sort of test in Browne-Heathcote’s eyes, because there’s a larger crowd in the back room after the round is done, including the two Mungo’s wizards from breakfast the first day—and Harry.
“God,” Harry groans, dropping his head into the crook of Draco’s neck. “

Hermione marches over to the other side of the table, and Harry gingerly twirls a

Potter straightens. “My— I’m sorry, my
. Alright?”
I’ll gladly fuck off—you’re aware the Portkey leaves in five minutes, yes?” Draco fretfully pats over his pockets, ensuring his wand and Shrunken travel bags are all present and accounted for. It wouldn’t do for him to have left something behind after riding Harry so hard.
Draco sighs deeply, but stands, adjusts his robes, and pats down along his arm to ensure his wand is holstered. As far as Harry can tell, there’s nothing to adjust, and of

It does the trick to distract him from his wallowing, though, and he turns back to the room, pasting a smile on his face when he notices Harry’s sitting back up, watching him quietly. “Anyway. It’s a bit belated, but welcome to my home, Potter.” He spreads his arms grandly, pleased when that elicits a laugh.
I wouldn’t want to mess them up.”
“Oh, shit, Draco, are you alright? Fuck, what happened?” Potter’s voice is concerned, and he’s resting a hand on the nape of Draco’s neck, lightly enough that it doesn’t bother him for once.
. “Isn’t it just...just a matter of deciding to try it, of feeling brave enough to give it a shot even if I’m still scared?”
do that to you,” Harry says earnestly, looking up to meet her eyes finally.
Draco’s distracted enough by the aftereffects of Potter’s spell that he steps too close to the home without checking his Occlumency barriers, and as soon as his foot touches the first step he doubles over and almost vomits.
At some point, Draco’s eyes slip closed, and he’s fuzzy and floating, only conscious of Harry’s heat at his side, and the bright liquid sparks where the wax hits, and the tightness of his skin where the wax has already cooled.
“Christ,” Harry mutters. “God, but we’ve fucked this up, haven’t we?”

Potter’s got the icing out on the counter with the plastic wrapping already discarded when Draco makes his way in, and he’s poised with a spoon, clearly about to take a taste. Draco eyes the icing, then Potter, and gets an idea.
Gin, I don’t see why you don’t
Draco barks out a laugh. “Quite completely, I’d say.”
“Half four,” Draco replies distractedly.

By the time Harry sends Draco the note, he’s been waiting for it for almost a week.
Ron punctuates that statement by dumping all the books onto the table with an almighty

Draco brings his legs together, trapping Harry’s cock between his thighs and rubbing gently. He knows just how soft these trousers are—he’d certainly paid enough for it—but on Harry’s hard, sensitive cock the tiniest breaks in the threading will scrape in a maddeningly painful, arousing way. Harry shivers, but stills almost immediately, and Draco kisses one of his cheeks in reward.
Twenty minutes later, he adjusts his estimate to

“Cheers,” Harry says, taking a long drink and leaning back into the booth, glancing around the bar. They’re in the Wizarding portion of the Shovell tonight, off the magically-concealed portion of the underground tunnel, and the crowd is pretty sparse even for a Wednesday; Harry’s grateful that there are fewer people to try and eavesdrop. “Just lost track of time at the gym, sorry. Where’s Hermione?”
