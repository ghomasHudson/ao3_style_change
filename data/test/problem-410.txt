Kreacher’s tone couldn’t have possibly held more disdain. He began muttering to himself, voice perfectly audible in the silent hallway. “
Harry scrubbed a hand over his face. This conversation kept going in the worst directions. Not that Harry had ever been very good at saying the right thing. His number one talent seemed to be putting his foot in his mouth. He distracted himself from the tension that had settled over the room by pouring himself a drink. He sat down at the table with it, and found Malfoy watching him intently.
and the process would start over again.
Malfoy smirked. “Green.”
“Know your size?”
“So,” Ron continued, his voice slightly strained,“What made the Savior of the Wizarding World decide to give little old me a call?”
Draco gave him a short, sarcastic laugh. “Spoken like the Savior of the Wizarding World. Maybe the world doesn’t need you, but you don’t think your friends do?”
Harry knew what it felt like, to be alone in the world, to truly believe no one cared about your well-being. He remembered how happy he’d been to finally meet Hagrid. What had Hagrid
“Don’t look so surprised,” Draco said. “I do have some skills that don’t involve ordering servants around, you know.”
perspective?” Draco’s voice had dropped even lower, almost a whisper.
When Harry’s vision stopped swirling, he made out Ron, sitting on the couch with a can of Budweiser in his hand.
Draco shook his head, and took a careful bite. The chicken was over-cooked, and the vegetables were almost raw, but it really wasn’t too bad.
They stared at each other for a moment. The kitchen suddenly felt very small, and very quiet. Draco’s foot was throbbing. The concern in Potter’s eyes was doing that funny thing to his throat again. He swallowed, hard.
Potter was walking away again, and Draco followed him, wondering if the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black had a dungeon.
Anyway, if there’s one thing I learned in therapy, it’s that the first step is learning how to handle all the icky stuff without letting it hurt you. ‘S called coping. My point is, when Malfoy’s already feeling like the worst person in the whole damn world, that’s probably not the best time to go digging through the past. Especially since, like you said, he doesn’t know how to do it...well, healthy.” Ron finished off the beer, set the can on the ground beside him. “If you’re asking me--which I guess you are--he could use some professional help, too. But until then, just...you know, do what you do best. Be his friend. Help him cope.”
Draco stood, feeling more steady on his feet than he had in a long, long time. He offered Potter a hand.
“Wha…” Harry said sleepily, readjusting his glasses and taking another look at…prisoner #6583-9K. As he did, the man looked straight back up at Harry.
“Let me see that,” Harry demanded, snatching the document from the Auror’s thin fingers. He skimmed it for a moment—prisoner rehabilitation program—prisoner #6583-9K, formerly referred to as Draco Lucius Malfoy—Custody of Harry James Potter, by legal agreement filed with the Wizengamot—He’d read enough. He all but threw the parchment back at the Auror.
Harry rose and climbed the stairs, a foreboding feeling settling in his throat.
“Are you sure?” Draco asked.
Potter was right, he was a bad liar, and at the moment, those eyes looked nothing but sincere.
In any case, he didn’t think Potter would appreciate him digging up his childhood, so he tried a different tact. “Tell me, Potter, why haven’t you punched me in the face yet? Or hexed me?”
Draco picked at the skin of the apple with his fingernail. “I meant it, too.”
“That’s what Malfoy thinks.” Ron was wearing a sly smile.
“He probably is.” Potter shrugged. “I think he’s trying to track down all the stuff Sirius and the Order threw out.”
Potter was just a stupid Gryffindor, how was he so perceptive? How had Draco let him get the upper hand like that? He needed more sleep, Draco decided, but sleep was still elusive.
“Oy,” said Harry, as Malfoy doubled over, coughing. Sure, he and Draco were far from friends, but Malfoy was bound with what looked like the heaviest chains Azkaban could afford. Surely there was no need to be hitting him?
And Draco had gone and pissed him off, over and over again.
Potter obliged, wiping his palm on his jeans and holding out his pinkie. Draco did the same, and they shook.
Harry sat watching the interaction unfold in shock. He’d never in his wildest dreams conceived that Malfoy was even capable of being this polite. Malfoy had been barely anything but cheeky and rude to Harry since he arrived, and Harry quite literally held Malfoy’s life in his hands. But obviously, he reminded himself, Malfoy’s pride wouldn’t matter to him in the slightest when it came to Narcissa. He’d clearly do anything to see her safe; he’d practically bitten Harry’s head off when Harry had so much as mentioned her.
“Alright,” he said finally. “Get some sleep, then.”
“I’ll guess, and buy you a belt,” Potter said, downing the last of his coffee and heading for the stairs.
“A certain brilliant Muggle-born witch named Hermione.” He smiled wider. “If anyone could find something promising in a book, it’d be her.”
Malfoy snorted. “Maybe you should have been a Ravenclaw.”
Malfoy tilted his head to the side, regarding Harry as if still trying to tell if he were serious. “I’ll pass on the hug, thanks,” he said. “But if you wanted to blow me, I miss that, too.”
Malfoy shrugged. “Couldn’t sleep. Lot on my mind.”
Ron glanced back over his shoulder to give Draco a tired, wry smile. “Yeah, anything for you, old buddy.”
Harry awoke to the sound of rain hammering on the glass of the House of Black’s windows. He’d fallen asleep leaning back against the couch, and his neck had a funny crick in it now. He cracked it, and then his back and his knuckles, mopped his overgrown bangs out of his eyes, and shoved his glasses back onto his face. He was just about to haul himself up to go make some coffee, when his eyes fell on a shape to his left. He startled, and then last night, and all of the day before, came back to him.
He started pouring pancakes, his face a mask of concentration, his brow furrowed and his teeth sunk into his pink bottom lip.
Potter nodded.
Draco shook his head. More of his tears fell; he wiped them away roughly with the back of his hand.
Harry couldn’t really be mad though—he still felt too guilty. He should have known better than to wake Malfoy up like that.
Harry wordlessly passed him the bottle.
“Fine, fine, you can make the pancakes,” Harry agreed, glad of the subject change.
Harry shrugged. “It was useful, sometimes. Except when it wasn’t.” He thought of Sirius, and let his tense shoulders slouch, leaning back against the couch.
“What could you have done? Honestly?”
Most of his injuries were healing by now, bruises fading. And he was lucky, he reminded himself, that Potter hadn’t given him any more. Draco rolled his wrist gingerly, even though he knew it would just make it worse. The cuts on his chest burned.
“I told you, I can’t kill myself,” Draco replied, a bitter grate in his voice.
It took him a little over two hours, but Draco managed to get the heater working. He rose and dusted off his hands, feeling the need for another bath already, but too exhausted to even consider it.
Malfoy laughed softly at that, surveying the coffee table. “Breakfast in bed, huh?”
“Her name’s Hermione, and watch how you talk about her.” Harry’s fingers were gripping his glass a little too tightly.
Thanks for reading!
Potter sighed. “Well, my friend Hermione managed to pass an order with the Ministry freeing all the house elves, but Kreacher’s lived here for god knows how long, and he didn’t want to leave. I didn’t have the heart to force him out, so now he lives in the basement, comes and goes as he pleases. Steals my liquor, occasionally, but that’s the only time he ever bothers me.”
Harry stepped up to wrap an arm around him, helping him up the remaining steps. Malfoy really
Harry knew when he was being wound up. What he didn’t know was why. He was aware Azkaban was far from “cozy,” but Draco was clearly still as proud as ever. Why would he be as good as
Potter gave him a fierce smile, more life in his eyes than Draco had seen yet. And he held out his pinkie.
They sat there in silence for a while, passing the bottle back and forth. Eventually, Harry sat forward to put another log on the fire. Draco flinched, with a small, gasping intake of breath.
“Why’s that?” Potter said, his voice careful.
“Here, this is…probably the cleanest one.”
briefcase,” he said finally. The briefcase flew from what was probably the kitchen, by the sound of shattering china, and into Potter’s outstretched hand. Potter set it on the ground and knelt beside it, flinging parchment out until he finally came across a heavy iron key.
you know how to make anything else?” Harry asked, taking a sip of whatever wizard liquor Draco had poured him. It was blue, and when Harry squinted, he was fairly certain he could make out small specks moving within it. He certainly didn’t remember buying it, but he probably had. He only ever seemed to meander down to the wizard market when he was already three sheets to the wind.
Thanks for reading!
Draco sucked in a breath. A deep, instinctual part of him didn’t want Potter anywhere near him, because for the last five years, people anywhere near him had meant bad things, and wands anywhere near him had meant worse.
Potter nodded awkwardly. “Um, thank you, Mrs. Malfoy.”
“Yes, Potter’s been perfectly decent, things are lovely--honestly,” he added, sensing his mother’s disbelief behind her polite smile.
“Bloody hell, Malfoy.” Potter sounded more exasperated than angry, running a hand through his hair and taking another swig out of the bottle.
Anyway, if you're in the mood for tooth-rotting fluff with a side of Harry angst, dinner is served folks
Harry opened his mouth to retort when the doorbell rang from upstairs. They looked at each other.
Malfoy considered. Finally, he set the bottle down. “Okay.”
Instead, he directed his attention to the empty bottles. “Thought you didn’t like Potions, Potter.”
Draco took a long, deep breath and released it, raising the bottle to his lips again.
“You’re taking care of yourself though, right?” Harry said. He knew how Hermione could get when she was focused on something. “When was the last time you ate?”
So why was the idea of allowing Potter to heal him so damn terrifying?
“They’re on your face.” The words coming out less scathing than he’d intended and more fondly amused.
what they did--revel in the suffering they caused. Malfoy certainly seemed to enjoy bullying people, but as a Death Eater, he’d always just looked scared.
“I do,” Hermione admitted, her voice getting a little higher like it did when she was nervous. “And it’s Mrs. Granger now.”
Malfoy wet his fingers in the sink and flicked water at both the pans he had heated, and then smiled as it sparked and crackled in the oil. “Perfect.”
Draco wet his lips, mouth feeling dry. Talking to Ron was a bitter reminder of the person Draco used to be, of how many enemies he’d made. “I didn’t mean to make any implications about your character, I just...” He couldn’t think of anything to say besides another apology, so he bit his tongue. They stood there awkwardly for a moment, Draco staring down at Ron’s shoes.
“Tell me,” Corbyn asked, leaning closer, “Why did you pick him?”
Love you all <3 thanks for sticking around and as always please tell me what you thought <3
“Do I look that bad?” Malfoy said in mock offense, reaching up to straighten his hair.
The words echoed in his head without his permission, and he felt a small smile widening across his face. When he looked back up at the fireplace, his mother was beaming at him from the flames again.
Malfoy obliged him, slowly pulling out a chair and sitting down. He picked up the package of bologna Harry had set on the table.
Harry was opening his mouth to retort when Draco suddenly whirled round to the stove, swearing.
He wasn’t sure how long he stayed like that, until there was a knock on the bathroom door.
“If it’s got you messed up, then I’ll give you my advice. Can’t promise it’ll be good, necessarily, but…” Ron shrugged, took a sip of beer.
He took a shaky breath, cracked his knuckles, and threw powder into the fire, watching the flames shift to emerald. “The Burrow,” he said, leaning forward.
Potter hesitated. “I’m not gonna hurt you,” he said, and the sudden softness in his voice was worse than a shout.
“Probably has a killer case of PTSD, after Azkaban,” Ron said. He raised his beer sarcastically. “I’ll drink to that,” he muttered, taking a long drink.
“Why don’t you get that nerdy friend of yours to help?”
He hadn’t given Hermione any details when he’d called her, in fact he’d barely come out with the fact that he needed her help before she was already telling him what time she’d be there.
“What did he mean?” Potter asked finally. “About a ‘gift’?”
“Alright, now you have to answer my question,” Potter reminded him. “Fair’s fair.”
Harry walked down the stairs to the kitchen, turning back at the bottom to check if Malfoy was following him. Malfoy was picking his way down the stairs, slowly, almost painfully, although it didn’t show on his face. As he stepped into the light from the kitchen’s open door, Harry was struck again by how pale he looked. His skin looked ashen beneath a thin coating of dirt, his blond hair limp and overgrown, hanging to his shoulders and over his face as he looked down to watch his steps.
“Keep telling yourself that.”
I had a very strange day today, slept only two hours, and edited this while a little tipsy, so god knows how it came out. I'll probably edit it again tomorrow, but I've been trying to complete something every day, so I wanted to finish it
“Can I help you?” Potter asked frostily, looking the two Aurors up and down.
“No.” Potter shook his head emphatically.
Draco was staring down at the book he had propped up on his knees, although it had long since become too dark for reading. He was looking at his arms, at the runes and bruises around his wrists.
Draco propped himself up on one arm to drink some of his own. After a few long sips, he was feeling better, the headache fading, his stomach settling. He felt almost comfortable.
“Couldn’t sleep either.” Harry sat on the desk, wondering what Malfoy was hiding. “What were you thinking about?” he asked.
Draco was back a few minutes later, holding the chains he’d been restrained with when he’d arrived. He knew they were cursed, he could feel it within them--ever since he’d dipped his toes in the darkness, he could almost smell it wherever it lingered--and by the fact that the abraded skin on his wrists and neck still stung, as sharply as when he had first taken them off.
The chains around Draco rattled, but held fast.
“Didn’t what?” Potter asked, sounding disturbed. “I didn’t do anything, I just put the blanket on you.”
“Harry…” she began.
“Getting frisky already, Potter?” Malfoy smirked. “Thought you were out of my league.”
Ron glared at him, looked away, picked up the can beside him and twisted it, crushing it in his fingers. “We’ve been through so much...
Potter opened his mouth to speak, but Ron interrupted him. “Oh, you’re that famous wizard, the one with the scar, what’s his name, Parry Hotter?”
“What about you?” Harry asked.
I do, then? Tell him he deserved it?”
“I think this curse is related to something older. And I think the Ministry tampered with it a good amount. I doubt it would be that simple.”
“Potter’s been exceedingly generous.”
Knowledge was power, and reading and note-taking was far more comforting than Draco would ever have expected, back in school.
"Let’s just say…” Malfoy swallowed, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and looked up at Harry through his overgrown bangs. “Whatever you’re thinking of…if you wanted to, you could.”
“Did I hurt your feelings?” Draco asked, managing to maintain his mocking, confident tone.
“Wonderful,” said the skinny Auror, looking pleased to be doing less paperwork. The heavyset Auror aimed one last kick at Malfoy.
Draco watched Potter as he worked, feeling that bubble of emotion rising in his throat again, a sort of ache that had nothing to do with the bruises. Getting to know Potter made him wonder if he’d ever had a real friend in his life. Or if maybe, this was something different, something rarer, that people didn’t find very often. He pushed the thought away as soon as he had it. It was just the bizarre intimacy of this moment, he decided, having an enemy’s wand pointed at his throat and feeling strangely calm.
The light was coming from the cracked door of the office. Harry considered peeking in to see what Malfoy was up to, but he didn’t want to ruin any trust he’d managed to build, so instead, he tapped softly on the door before pushing it open.
In all seriousness, y'all have sat through a lot of fighting in this fic, so here's some of that hurt/comfort shit we all love.
“I can’t stop,” Malfoy said.
Harry’s quiet voice was only one of many, swirling inside Draco’s head, and it was lost like a drop in an ocean, slipping through Draco’s fingers as he tried to hold onto it.
She stopped before she got to it, and turned back to give Harry a tight hug. “Be sure you actually do call me this time, you git.”
Corbyn finally looked back at Potter, casual once again. “I left the Malfoy boy a little gift, when we parted ways.” He smirked. “It’s worth seeing, I promise.” With that, he turned away, walking down the front steps and Disapparating with a sharp crack.
“Trouble has a way of following you though, doesn’t it?”
Fingers shaky, Draco swung the door open. “Mr. Weasley.”
Malfoy glared up at him from the floor. “If you start referring to me as your
Potter just rolled his eyes and raised his wand higher. Draco tensed, steeled himself.
Draco stretched and rose, startling Potter out of his reverie, and gently tugged the coffee mug from Potter’s hands. “Want a refill?” he asked.
hatred. I felt bad for you, Draco. You looked trapped, and—and terrified. You looked like you were dying inside.” Harry paused, seemingly waiting for a response, and then finally spoke again. “Bullies come from everywhere. And they can join any side. And that’s what you were, Draco. A bully. But you’re a lot more than that too. And you were just a damn kid.” Harry huffed in disgust. “This Corbyn guy, he’s the one who should be ashamed of himself. He’s a grown man, and he’s still just a bully.”
“I am tired.” Malfoy closed the book in his lap and leaned his bruised face into his hand. “But sleep doesn’t help much.”
“He’s offered me both. I declined.”
Harry sat back on his heels in his living room. He’d forgotten how merciless Hermione could be, when she was giving advice. He rubbed his sweaty palms together.
Draco hesitated. “Yes.”
Draco set the book down in his lap, and looked up at Potter, trying to wrap his head around the idea of them being friends. Draco had agreed to it last night, but he couldn’t help but feel like Potter was just being
Harry shook his head. “You must think pretty damn highly of my character.”
“You can’t take someone’s pain away for them, Harry. All you can do is help them deal with it. Think about what works for you, when you’re feeling...bad, lost in your head.”
“Easy.” Malfoy smiled mirthlessly. “Not for me.”
Y'all are probably tired of hearing me say this, but sorry for the wait. I think I'm finally out of my depression hole though, so hopefully I'll have the next one up sooner.
Potter shrugged. “Nah, I’m alright. But we can call it quits for tonight, if you want. Or not. Up to you.”
Ron looked at him. His eyes were miserable, angry, fond, worried, a hundred emotions at once. Harry couldn’t meet them. He looked away. He couldn’t do this. A tear escaped from his eyes and ran down his face.
The boy thinks he can insult this house in such a way, if the mistress were here to see it, she would weep, the way he keeps the estate--”
“Well, I’ll trust Draco to remember it, then. It’s related to the curse they used to use on house elves, but it predates that, actually. It’s from back in the days when wizards used to enslave each other. Harry, touch Draco.”
It was late, when Malfoy finally came downstairs. Harry was in his usual spot on the floor, the familiar weight of a bottle in his hands.
“I never agreed to it, so how did you know I wouldn’t send him straight back to Azkaban?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“If you want to stop, that’s fine. But not on my account.”
“Even less agreeable company, I’m afraid,” came the answer. Draco stepped into the doorway.
Potter turned around from the stove again. “Did you?”
Hope you enjoyed! If you have anything specific you want to see, tell me.
nervous, though? Knowing you’re only doing what I allow you to?”
“Here,” he said, holding it out. Maybe if he got Malfoy drunk enough, he could get some damn answers.
What in the hell was Potter doing? He wondered yet again, feeling chills rising on his arms. Was he preparing some sort of infernal Muggle torture device?
Potter was trying to pull his arm away, but Draco couldn’t let go, it was his only comfort, his only anchor, against whatever had him in its clutches.
“It’s alright,” Malfoy drawled. “I’ll just go back to my cozy little cell, get some rest.” He turned to the heavyset Auror next to him. “Say, do you think I could have a bottle of wine delivered? This weekend is promising to be terribly more boring than expected—“
“What is it, then?” Harry asked quietly.
Draco flinched back, despite himself.
Draco linked fingers with him, and shook. He took a deep breath. Neither of them let go.
Everything he could say sounded hollow, in the face of everything that had happened.
Harry realized he was openly staring, and focused his attention back on his drink. Draco was...strangely distracting, sometimes. He shook the thought out of his head.
Harry removed his glasses again and rubbed his hands over his face. How the hell had he gotten here again? What cruel twist of fate had put him in this position exactly?
“What is it, then?”
Draco had stopped trying to puzzle out Potter’s motives, and simply decided that Potter must pity him. It was still surprising--that Potter would feel anything for Draco at all--but Draco couldn’t deny he was a disgustingly pathetic figure, these days. Apparently Potter was just that nice of a person, that Draco’s sorry condition made him feel sympathetic rather than satisfied. But if he were being honest, the way Potter had treated him went beyond pity.
“I’m cleaning it,” Potter retorted, holding gently onto Draco’s heel. “It hurts ‘cause the germs are dying.”
Draco stared at Potter as he worked. Potter’s look of concentration was growing increasingly more intense, beads of sweat forming along his hairline. But with every spell Potter cast, Draco felt a tiny bit better, as if a weight had been lifted. The pain was ebbing away, too, until finally, it disappeared altogether. Draco looked down, and found that the last of the bruises had faded.
Potter was sitting on the couch and gazing at the fire, his eyes a million miles away, a long-since cooled cup of coffee in his hands.
They ate in silence for a little while, and then Malfoy looked up at him. “Who was your first time?” he asked casually.
“It’s not
Draco Malfoy was curled up on the floor next to him. Draco Malfoy, the one who had tormented him and his friends during their school years, who had tried to kill Dumbledore, who had become a Death Eater,
“Go on then,” Draco said, with a bravado he did not feel. “If you’re bitter, why don’t you do something about it?”
Potter’s eyes widened. Draco had been holding his breath, expecting Potter to immediately pull out his wand and start flinging spells, but Potter just sat still, regarding Draco’s battered wrist.
Harry swallowed his guilt, along with the fear that curled in his stomach, thinking about talking to someone about his problems. “We’re not talking about me, remember?”
he asked, sounding almost insulted.
“You threatened to, before.”
And apparently, it really was, as Draco had wound him up seemingly as far as he could go today, and Potter hadn’t even pulled out his wand. He’d just...left.
Draco was snoring, softly. Harry tapped him on the shoulder, and he mumbled something, rolled over onto his back again, eyes still shut. His sweater had slid up his stomach the tiniest bit. Harry felt an urge to lift it, to see what was beneath…
Malfoy was fighting back the only way he knew how, the only way he could, with words—just like Harry used to do with the Dursleys. He’d found a weak spot, and now he was poking it. That was it, nothing personal. Still…
“They locked you in your room?” Draco whispered. No wonder Potter thought people would be happier if he weren’t around to muck up their lives.
Malfoy smirked. “You’re a lot more comforting than the Dementors are.”
“Money-grubbing?” Harry asked, momentarily distracted. He hadn’t paid so much as a single Sickle for Malfoy, as far as he knew.
Malfoy set his mug down on the table, drummed his fingers beside it in exaggerated consideration. “And if I don’t?”
Harry picked his brain, recalling all the messy conversations he’d had with Draco. “I’ve been trying, but...I don’t think anything I say helps. He doesn’t want to hear any of it. Half the time he just gets angry, and I guess I can’t blame him.”
If Potter wanted to do any kicking, he’d have to locate his shoes first, Draco thought with a smirk, eyeing the piles of rubbish and clutter littering the hallway. What
It's my first time trying to write a full flashback, they're way harder than I expected. Hopefully it came off okay. I wanted to give a bigger peak into Draco's memories.
taking Potter so long? Was he trying to find his wand from whatever pile of dirty laundry he’d left it in?
Malfoy regarded him for a long moment, before picking up the plates and setting them on the table. “What do you want to know, then?” he asked, sitting down. “Ask me anything, I’ll be honest.”
He’d slipped onto the floor, back pressed against the desk. He felt movement beside him, and pulled his arms up to shield himself.
I’m really excited to post this one, it’s one of the scenes that inspired the whole fic. As a result, I did that thing where I obsess over editing and I'm still not satisfied, so I'm crossing my fingers and posting it. Hope you enjoy <3
“Cause you know whatever game you played against me…” Draco forced a smirking smile onto his face. “You wouldn’t win.”
Kreacher, seemingly deciding that fixing the heater was too suspicious an excuse, followed him, still muttering. “...Nasty little face, like a rat, up to no good, Kreacher can tell, how could a pureblood fall so low…”
“Would you stop calling me ‘master,’ at least?” Harry said, for at least the hundredth time. “You’re free, remember?”
“Coming,” he shouted, searching the coffee table with a frantic hand for his glasses, sending boxes of takeout and empty Styrofoam cups flying.
Ron looked up at him, eyes narrowed, head tilted.
for them?”
“--Honestly, Ron,” she was muttering, and then looked up. “Oh, hello, Draco, how are you? Feeling any better?”
Hope you’re all well and staying safe <3
Draco’s thoughts strayed back to his meeting with Hermione. She had seemed sincere, and Draco couldn’t honestly picture her being truly cruel. The one thing that had terrified him the most in this situation had been not knowing where his mother was, but she was safe. Merlin, she was
Harry stared back at him, feeling his eyes prickling a little.
Whatever ministry slime had forged Harry’s signature on that bloody document, he was going to find them—and make their life as miserable as they had made his.
At this, Malfoy looked up again. “Self-aggrandizing?” His voice was a little hoarse, but it still had echoes of his signature drawl. “Rich, coming from ‘The Boy Who Lived’ himself.”
“Are you okay?” Harry asked.
Harry finally broke the silence himself. “Corbyn was...he was misguided. And I doubt he’d ever be able to forgive you, for being associated with the Death Eaters, for being a part of your family--but he shouldn’t have let his hatred make him abuse his power like that. Make him abuse a
He held the light up to the bottom of Draco’s foot. “I’m guessing this still doesn’t mean you want me healing you magically?” he asked.
“I’m just saying, in my defense, a dent in the wall is probably the least of your problems.”
“It’s alright. I’m just glad we’re both here now. Ron and I, and all the Weasleys, we’ve been worried.”
“So, what’s the matter with Draco?”
“You’re
Malfoy shrugged in response.
Again, it's been a long time since I read the books, so if I messed anything up, my apologies.
“Um…” He swallowed thickly. Pushing words out through his teeth felt like threading a needle. “I certainly...hope I’ve improved.” He didn’t know what else to say, all he wanted was to shut the door and curl up in a ball. He could usually hold his own with the Aurors, even when they hurt him, but Corbyn...Corbyn could pin him to the wall with just his eyes.
Malfoy shrugged. “Depends what you’re making.”
Harry heard a noise in the hallway, and sat up with a start. He rose, and stepped across the room to hover in the doorway.
“What the bloody hell is bull-ogg-nah?” he asked. “Some kind of dog food?”
Malfoy had descended back into his usual, comfortable cynicism, but Harry was still reeling. He could tell Malfoy had been abused, but what he was hearing now was...beyond.
“It’s not too early, it’s too late.”
Harry looked up at the legs of the desk in Hermione’s office. It had taken him a minute to work up the nerve to give her a floo call, and even now he was considering hanging up before she noticed him.
In all seriousness, thanks to each and every one of you who's still reading, this story is a blast to write.
Draco sat back on his heels. “You didn’t happen to see a spare power cell around here, did you?”
“Some would say that’s more than I deserve,” Draco mumbled, staring at the ceiling.
“Because I have some semblance of self-control. And you’ve been in prison for years, you’ve clearly been tortured, I’m not going to go out of my way to hurt you just ‘cause I’m mad.”
“Fair enough, I just figured you’d be tired.” He wished Malfoy would get more rest, but he supposed he couldn’t expect Malfoy to relax. Malfoy probably had nightmares, too, he realized. The thought felt alien, and gave him a strange, tight feeling in his chest, like when he’d caught Malfoy crying in the bathroom.
And apparently, if what Draco had heard as he was coming downstairs was correct, it had been Hermione who placed him with Potter. So Potter had been telling him the truth, about never wanting this in the first place. But despite that, Potter had still taken care of him.
“Yes, Hermione, thank you.” Draco sat down beside Harry. “Is my mother alright?”
“What is it then?” Harry wasn’t trying to ask intrusive questions, but they’d been dancing around this issue for a while now.
“Well, Harry…” Hermione shifted in her seat, studiously regarding her own hands. “Here’s where you have to hear
Potter folded his arms. “Is this one of the ‘routine’ questions?”
“But we were never friends. We were enemies.”
“It works on locks,” Potter said defensively, gesturing at the heavy locks on Draco’s ankles.
“I brought dinner,” he said, setting a plastic bag that smelled like food down on the table.  He pulled his coat off and looked up at Draco in surprise. “Is that...did you get the heater working?”
The rain had stopped at some point during the night, leaving smudged, dreary clouds hanging in the sky. Potter had made them toast and coffee, again, and now Draco was staring down into his nearly-empty mug, leaning back against the couch. He remembered the comforting hand Potter had extended last night, the ghost of the touch still lingering on his shoulder. Part of him was grateful, and most of him was resolutely disgusted that he’d opened up that much, that he’d allowed Potter to comfort him.
Harry huffed a short sigh. “If you wanna get drunk, I’m not going to stop you, but at least drink something you actually like.” Harry started downstairs towards the kitchen, and Malfoy followed him. He dropped into a kitchen chair, looking exhausted. Harry pulled a bottle of potion from above his fridge and popped the cork open against the counter.
Draco accepted it with a bitter smirk. “It sure is.”
“What do you mean?” Harry asked, a little concerned.
Potter made a strangled noise of frustration. “I told you, Malfoy, it’s not a fair fight. And besides, you’re already hurt. Why the hell would I do that?”
One thing was certain, though: Potter may have said he had no interest in making threats, but he’d made one all the same, veiled though it was.
Draco looked down at the smear of blood on the kitchen tiles, and swore. “Sorry, Potter.”
Potter opened his mouth, but Draco cut him off. “I don’t get you. You’re not stuck in this house, like me. You have people who want to help you, a whole world of opportunities, and you don’t even leave your door. It’s like you’ve already decided you’re going to die here, alone.”
(Side note, I'm white so I'm sure it hits different for black people but I love that Hermione is black in Cursed Child, it makes so much sense. I know a lot of people saw her as black before, but I'm just so happy she was played by a black actress in the stage show. Such a blessed decision, like it single-handedly cleansed all Rowling's bad tweets from existence. I love seeing all the support for it in the fandom as well, and I wanted to add my little piece to it. Hermione is black in this, not that it really changes much lol.)
(See the end of the chapter for
trying to come out of his mouth, and clenched his jaw.
It was a mental jigsaw puzzle, the way Potter was treating him. Draco had been turning it over and over in his mind, but no matter how he moved the pieces around, he couldn’t make them fit. Every time he arrived at the conclusion that Potter was just being nice, the rest of him would retort,
Potter shook his head. “It’s a long story.”
to be brave.” Draco sighed. “And let’s face it, Potter, if you want to hurt me, you certainly don’t need my consent.”
The elf looked up at Draco with his strange, milky eyes for a few long, uncomfortable seconds, before bowing low. “Kreacher should introduce himself. Kreacher used to serve here, used to serve the Noble Family of Black, before the house was overrun with the filthy blood traitors…” Kreacher trailed off. “Kreacher does not know you. Kreacher knows a bad sort when he sees it, yes, indeed--”
“Not like I’m going anywhere either,” Malfoy added.
interesting in his fridge. Unless Draco was simply horrified to see more bologna.
“Only if you pour some Jack in it.”
Potter had been kind to him, so far. He seemed to think Draco didn’t deserve all the things that had been done to him, and Draco felt a cowardly impulse to keep it that way.
Malfoy shrugged, taking a sip of coffee. “They’d all lost people. They all hated being assigned to guarding Death Eaters. And like I said, they had very little supervision. And no judgment, from anyone. Nobody cared what happened to the ‘bad guys,’ not enough to intervene, anyway. Or call them out for it.” Malfoy sighed. “In a way, I guess I can understand it.”
Sorry it's a little short, but I hope you enjoy!
“I saw a photograph of him in his file, covered in bruises, flinching away from the flash. He looked...he looked like such a wreck. I knew you wouldn’t be able to send him back there.”
“No, I mean--I’m glad. That’s good. Did it, ya know, help?”
Potter shrugged again, half-heartedly this time. “I don’t know. He used to give me the creeps, when I was younger. But now, I guess...I guess I can understand living in the past.”
“There was this one Auror. Corbyn, that’s his name. Bellatrix, my aunt, tortured and killed someone of his--his wife, was my guess.” Malfoy was staring at the tiles beneath his feet, his features expressionless. “Anyway, he hated me. And he loved getting assigned to me. I don’t think he had many friends. Lots of time to kill.” Malfoy’s chuckle was bitter. “One day, he spent hours, just breaking my fingers, and healing them. Over and over again. One by one.”
Surely, if Potter wanted to use magic to hurt him, he would have by now. And even if he changed his mind, he didn’t need Draco’s permission.
More words were bubbling up in his throat, the thoughts and memories pressed down for too long. “I still dream about them, the victims. The screaming, the begging, the flashes of green light, and then...just...nothing. It’s awful, watching a person die. It’s like there’s this...this
“It’s like he blames himself for...everything. Like every single thing Voldemort did was his own personal fault.” Harry dropped his head into his hands. “Sorry to bother you with this, I doubt you care, but Hermione seemed to think you’d have advice, and...well, if you do, I’m sure it’s worth hearing,” he finished, staring at the Burrow’s stained, well-worn carpet.
“Make another remark about Ginny, and you’ll find out,” Harry said, glaring at him now.
“You’re probably right,” Potter said, heaving a sigh. “I just wish this whole nightmare were over.”
“Well, like you said, we’re going to be living under the same roof. I made a request of you, to not talk trash about the people I care about. Do you want to make one of me?”
Hermione stood, and then stopped in her tracks at Malfoy’s small flinch. “Of course, Draco. It’s water under the bridge. And call me Hermione, please.”
His mother fixed her hair self-consciously with another glance at Potter. “Well, Hermione has some important things to tell you, so I won’t keep you any longer, Harry, I hope you understand I just wanted to say hello…” She turned back to Draco. “I’ll talk to you more later, alright, sweetheart?”
It was a little below Malfoy’s usual caliber of insult, but Harry was willing to bet Malfoy had been embarrassed by how he’d woken up, and now he was trying to level the playing field. “Yours is longer,” Harry pointed out, not managing to really sound offended.
Hermione narrowed her eyes at Potter. “Harry, you
The words seemed to echo in Harry’s head. Draco had admitted a few of the things the Aurors had done to him. Harry could only imagine the things they’d said, over the years, the effect that would have on a person, trapped in a cell, alone, with nothing to think about but their own guilt.
“Well, uh, you look like you haven’t eaten in…days, so yeah.”
Draco nodded. “I love you, mum.”
“That’s awful, Potter.”
“And if I do?” Potter’s tone had turned downright icy.
Potter raised an eyebrow at him.
Draco woke on the couch, his head pounding and his stomach turning. He sat up groggily, and pressed the back of his hand against his mouth, willing himself not to throw up. Potter was sleeping on the floor beside him, head on his arm, still wearing his glasses. His hair had fallen back off his forehead, and Draco could clearly see his scar, jagged as lightning.
Draco leaned his head back against the cold porcelain of the bathtub and shut his eyes.
“Draco?” It was Potter’s voice.
“But you could,” Draco interrupted. “It would probably make life easier for you. I’m not sure what you’re getting out of this, since you seem uninterested in revenge.”
“If you’ll
“I have to live here too, and I was tired of looking at it. And besides,” Malfoy closed the book and set it beside him. “I needed the distraction.”
He woke to the sound of the door opening. Potter stepped in, looking soaked through, his overgrown hair sticking to his forehead and his glasses covered in rain drops.
“Yeah.” Draco handed the bottle back.
They sat there for a moment, eating toast in silence on the floor, until Malfoy spoke again.
Harry rolled his eyes at the both of them. “It’s the most comfortable thing I own, I told you, I’m not throwing out my favorite jumper just cause it isn’t fashionable, it’s not like I go anywhere--”
The fire was dying to embers, and Harry had just added another log to it with a muttered spell to be sure it lighted, when he heard a creak from the stairs.
“And no, I’m not hungry, I’m struggling not to puke as it is.”
“Hi, mum,” Draco said, leaning almost all the way into the fire, wishing he could jump through the flames and hug her.
“I can’t,” Harry said, shaking his head. “How can they pretend to be any better than Death Eaters, if that’s how they act when the tables are turned?”
Harry didn’t know what to say to that, besides ‘sorry,’ and he didn’t think Malfoy would appreciate it.
Draco pressed his hand to his mouth, breathing carefully. His stomach was still churning from last night, and the coffee hadn’t helped to settle it. He could still sense the flashes of memory tugging at the back of his mind. Dementors and Aurors had haunted his dreams last night, and he could almost feel their fingers around his throat. The warmth of a kind touch had erased them, for a moment, but now they were back. He felt his eyes stinging again. Hadn’t he spent all his tears already?
“No,” Harry snapped, “I guess you can’t.”
“You just cleaned my whole living room, you don’t need to cook for me, too.”
“Why’s that?”
“What the hell do you know about it, Malfoy?” Ron’s voice was dangerously quiet.
Harry leaned forward and rested his fingers on it gently. “Maybe you should get some sleep, instead.”
Draco smirked, remembering the moment in the Hogwarts Express in their sixth year. “Still bitter about that, are you? I’m not the one who was eavesdropping like a pathetic little first year spying on their crush.”
Harry stepped closer, bent down a little to look Malfoy in the eyes. His face was cold, tense, unreadable.
Malfoy turned the burners off with a snap and then turned around, arms folded. “Why don’t you tell me, then? Since you know me so well.”
“I get it, it’s impossible. Do we have a deal, or not?”
As Draco regarded his old rival, he felt strangely nostalgic. He’d give anything to go back to bickering with Potter in a hallway at Hogwarts. And it had been a long, long time since he’d seen a familiar face. Sure, he’d spent most of their years together fighting, but Potter was still his classmate, and someone he knew fairly well. Potter felt almost like a friend.
Potter stood, swaying on his feet slightly. “I’ll be right back,” he said, and started down the stairs.
Harry blinked. “You’re messing with me.”
I've thought about this too much, I need to sleep lol. Pretty please tell me your thoughts on this one, even if it's criticism <3
“No, just...follow his logic a little. Meet him halfway.”
“Sorry, had to talk to you,” Harry said hurriedly. “Not a bad time, is it?”
He remembered kneeling to bandage Malfoy’s foot, telling him he wanted to, trying to kindle that fragile spark of trust in Malfoy’s eyes. What on god’s green earth had possessed him to be so...intimate with Draco Malfoy? Draco Malfoy, who had bullied him for years, insulted his friends, joined Voldemort...But Draco Malfoy wasn’t just that, anymore. That name brought different things to the front of Harry’s mind now--shaky fingers and sweet coffee, sad, tired blue eyes, stupid jokes and smirking half smiles. Malfoy wasn’t just a vague idea Harry could hate from afar, he’d gotten too close for comfort. Malfoy was a hurting, angry man, standing in a pile of broken glass, bloody knuckles raised. He was a scared boy, who had been through too much, who could never live up to his father’s expectations. He was a brave but suffering person, curled up on Harry’s floor, tormented by his own head. And most of all, he was Harry’s responsibility, like it or not. Harry looked down at his right palm, remembering the rune that had appeared there last night. This connection went two ways, after all. And although Harry would have denied it, there was a small, protective fire growing in his heart.
Draco glanced at Potter. Potter glanced back. Neither of them, it seemed, had noticed Potter’s hand that morning, they’d been too preoccupied.
Ron seemed like he was in a good mood, maybe asking for advice about Malfoy
My family were the ones who did it.
Hermione was looking at Malfoy, studying him. Then she rounded on Harry. “You haven’t even healed him yet, Harry? Or given him a change of clothes?”
Draco passed the apple back and forth from hand to hand, considering. “We hung around together. They backed me up. We had a laugh, now and then.”
Sometimes you just don't know until you start writing what kind of tone a story is going to have, so sorry for the switch <3
“I hurt people. I watched people get hurt. How can you not hate me for that?”
“What about Hermione?”
“And what does the oh-so-special Boy Who Lived have to be drinking about?”
Look at our boys, actually talking about their feelings! Kind of! haha
Malfoy gave him a small, grim smile. “Then you know how to make it work. It takes a lot of hate, to want to see a person suffer that much. Not just anger--hate. Anger is simpler, it’s a flash in the pan, but hatred...hatred is more complex. It has a flavor to it, ages like a fine wine.”
Malfoy shrugged. “I mocked you for it. Guess I deserved it.”
Draco hesitated a moment, and then walked over to drop to a seat on the floor, still a careful distance from Harry. He was sitting with his knees up to his chest, arms wrapped around them. Harry could see hollow, grey smudges beneath Draco’s eyes in the firelight.
Harry winced. “He’s just feeling...really down on himself, and I don’t know how to help.”
“I should have done something.”
Ron nodded. “I know better than to get in her way, though.”
“That’s a laugh. I wouldn’t even be able to get in the common room.”
“She ended the call on you, didn’t she?” Ron smiled fondly at Harry’s nod. “That sounds like my wife.”
Malfoy was sitting on the floor, back against the couch, a book in his hands. “Finally awake, are you?” He looked up at Harry. “I know, I know,” he drawled, “You do, in fact, have a floor. Try not to die of a heart attack, now that you can finally see it.”
Draco said, horrified.
“Oh.” Potter sat back in his chair again. He looked surprisingly calm. “Probably should have figured that.”
As always, leave a comment, tell me what you thought, hope you enjoyed and thanks for reading!
They stayed like that, for a long time. Harry rubbed his thumb over Draco’s shoulder, gently. Draco’s tears began to slow. He wiped his nose with his fist, sniffed. He turned, and looked at Harry’s hand, still on his shoulder, and then up at Harry.
“These are old marks, very old, yes. Very old, when the world was new, and the blood was clean. Kreacher has heard of such things, Kreacher has seen…” The elf was making even less sense than he had before, somehow.
Draco leaned back in his chair and pulled the blanket tighter around his shoulders, happy Potter wasn’t pushing the issue. He didn’t feel like talking about how pathetic he felt.
like that. That's just--just disgusting. You can feel a feeling and not act on it. It takes self-control, but you can.”
“Not exactly a fair fight,” Potter muttered. He looked uncomfortable. Draco wondered if his earlier assessment had been correct, and Potter had gotten cold feet on his plan of revenge upon seeing him.
“How’s the House of Black? Not too gloomy, I hope?”
“Oh, it’s you.” Harry took a breath to calm himself. He was jumpy tonight. “Can’t sleep?” he guessed.
Harry took another drink, passed the bottle back to Draco. “It is what it is.”
“Don’t mention it,” Harry repeated, and dropped to the floor beside him.
Sorry for the wait, I took a short break. Anyway, it’s a long one, so I hope you enjoy <3
worth a shot. Ron could be emotionally...well, incompetent at times, but he wasn’t an idiot. If he deigned to give advice on the subject, it would probably be worth hearing. Harry opened and shut his mouth, unsure how to begin.
“Brilliant observation, Potter,” Draco drawled. “Ten points to Gryffindor.”
held, but Draco was at Potter’s mercy for the foreseeable future, however brief it ended up being. Potter looked like he was barely keeping himself alive at the moment. The years had not been good to the Chosen One, evidently. Briefly, Draco wondered why, before sternly reminding himself he didn’t care.
Malfoy nodded at her one last time, and then she swept out the door, Disapparating with a crack.
He took a deep breath, hoping he wasn’t about to piss Ron off even more, and pushed the words out of his mouth. “He’s really in a bad way, you know. Your friend.”
And poor Draco, he's feeling down on himself again. He'll get healed soon, I pinkie promise
Harry looked at him fondly for a long moment. “Thanks,” he choked out, and swallowed. “Um...well, what would you say, then? To...to someone who...who hates themself?”
“Aw, poor widdle Harry Potter, scared of his classmate. I thought you defeated Lord Voldemort? What’s the matter? Gone soft with your age?” He looked Harry up and down. “Looking a little worse for wear, aren’t you? Still getting your clothes out of the Weasley’s laundry?”
“Sorry I neglected to use only one-syllable words, I was unaware you’d be attempting to decipher it.”
“Sounds like quality entertainment to me.” Malfoy swirled his remaining coffee in mock contemplation. “So, Ginny. Wonder who she’s with now?”
“Call Ron,” Hermione said, pulling her wand from her robes. “He’s at the burrow, it’s his day off.” She gave Harry another smile. “Take care of yourself. And take a damn shower.” She ended the call with a wave of her wand.
“We sent the papers to you, and they were returned, signed and filed, we didn’t—“
Harry was sitting at the kitchen table, a second mug of coffee in his hands, watching Malfoy as he fussed with the stove, muttering something about ‘Muggle contraptions’ intermingled with a number of colorful swears Harry had never heard.
Harry hesitated, biting his tongue. Part of him wanted to retort that Malfoy was only coming after him like this because he was ashamed of how he’d behaved earlier, of his involuntary reaction to even the slightest touch. But it seemed too cruel of a thing to point out.
“She might not want to see me, but she’ll want to help you.”
Malfoy reached out unsteadily for the coffee, picked it up and took a small sip. He screwed his face up in distaste. “Got any sugar?”
“Was trying to make you get rid of that thing for almost two years--” Hermione continued.
And they both knew which one Draco preferred. Azkaban was the closest thing he could imagine to hell on earth. And Potter could send him back any time he liked, with little more than a snap of his fingers.
Draco shot Potter a flippant, “If you insist,” and pulled the jumper back over his head, trying to ignore how strangely relieved he felt.
Harry signed on the small line that had appeared at the bottom, and handed the parchment over. The Auror handed him a leather briefcase, thanked him for his time, and then they were gone, the thickset Auror giving Malfoy one last glare over his shoulder. Harry understood the sentiment.
Malfoy glared at him. “Hilarious, Potter.”
Draco bit his lip, considering. In a way, he realized,
Poor Draco is feeling the guilt.
Potter chuckled. “Yeah, that ought to drive up the asking price.”
“Baloney,” Potter corrected, giving him a small half smile in return.
“Do you know how to get rid of them?” Draco asked, feeling an unwelcome swell of hope in his heart.
Potter finally leaned back, satisfied, and then raised his wand one more time to tap Draco on his nose, muttering a short spell.
Draco narrowed his eyes.
“What do you mean?” Potter asked, sounding wary.
Some people were worried I was forcing myself to write, I'm not! I'm still really enjoying writing this. Thank you to everyone who was concerned about my mental health on the last chapter, you guys are all so sweet. I'm still in the depression hole *waves hello from the bottom* but I'm upping my meds and I'm going to keep fighting, as always. I've had depression since I was a kid and I'm pretty good at dealing with it by now. Updates are probably going to be slower for a while though, sorry about that.
Potter rolled over on the floor with a quiet groan, and slowly sat up, rubbing the back of his head.
Recognition hit him like a punch in the gut. Or a boot heel to the face.
“Don’t say that,” Harry said. It wasn’t the first time Malfoy had tossed out some dismal remark like that, but every time it disturbed Harry a little more.
“Just curious,” Corbyn said. “The Chosen One himself--you’re a hard man to track down, you know. So now that you’ve finally selected someone from the program, I’m wondering...why him?” Corbyn’s voice was carefully casual, his eyes sharp. Draco felt the pancakes and coffee turning over in his stomach.
“So what
Malfoy swallowed. “I’m not gay, Potter.” He met Harry’s eyes again after a moment, a cocky grin on his face. “Although I’m sure you wish.”
, between life and death, and then they’re just...gone.” Draco felt another sob rising his chest, and swallowed thickly, trying to push it back down. “There’s a
“Mr. Potter--” he began.
Or the damn jumper. Draco was still stymied by that.
Potter looked at Draco’s battered hands next, and Draco fisted them in his lap. “They’re fine, Potter.”
He handed the chains to Kreacher. Kreacher surveyed them, turning them over in his tiny hands, and muttering things that Draco couldn’t quite make out. Then the elf reached, quick as a snake, and wrapped his bony fingers around Draco’s wrist.
Draco shook his head. “He has a right to be furious with me. I--I watched his wife, suffering horribly, watched her
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to tune out Kreacher’s continuous muttering and already feeling the promise of next morning’s hangover. He turned with a sigh and took the stairs down to the kitchen. If he couldn’t sleep, he might as well get drunker.
When he was through, he took another look at himself. He’d done pretty neat work of it, in his opinion. And looking at his reflection, he realized that, for the first time in a long time, he felt a little more like himself.
What was Malfoy doing this late at night?
“Not these locks.”
“In any event,” Hermione continued, cutting them both off, “From what I’ve gathered, it’s what links you. The curse marked you when you signed for Draco.”
He was still wearing the “I speak fluent sarcasm” shirt, and it made a smile tug at the corner of his mouth. He pulled the shirt off, and his smile faded, the cloth dropping from his fingers to the floor. He leaned against the sink, staring at the inverted letters carved into his chest in the mirror.
He’d given up breathing, just focusing on clenching his jaw against the pain. It felt like every nerve in his body was burning, like he had boiling lava in his veins instead of blood. His head felt like it was swelling, like his eyes would burst out of his skull.
“That’s very sweet, Potter,” Malfoy said, in a tired attempt at his mocking drawl. “Did you read that in a Muggle birthday card?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry felt a small pang of guilt, still staring down at the blue liquid in his glass. Draco had been in prison for years, he must desperately miss fresh food. And Harry had fed him mostly takeout and toast.
Draco rose. “Leave me
The corner of Hermione’s mouth turned up. “He’s more sensitive than he lets on.”
“Excuse me?” Potter said, but Draco barely heard him. Corbyn’s gaze was still locked with Draco’s, his eyes dark like the ocean at night. They both knew Potter hadn’t healed him, and they both knew the marks Corbyn had carved into his chest as a going-away present were still there, burning beneath Draco’s sweater.
“How’s the pancakes? Best you’ve ever had?”
“Alright,” Potter said, with a small sigh.
Harry had no idea what to do for Draco to make him feel any better, let alone what to say. No matter how stubbornly Harry tried, he couldn’t seem to change Draco’s mind about himself. Harry supposed it would take time, but still…
“My ‘situation’ makes you want to help me? I’d imagine you’d find it amusing. It’s sort of poetic justice, isn’t it?”
“You’re the one changing the subject. And I saw you hide something, earlier.”
Draco pulled back, but the elf was surprisingly strong for his size, and simply yanked the arm closer to his face.
“Well, I’m certainly not going anywhere.”
Harry shivered, imagining waking up from a nightmare, cold and alone, with nothing but Dementors for company. “Hell ain’t flames,” he said finally, for lack of anything better.
“Can’t be worse than bologna,” Draco said, leaning forward to accept the steaming paper box Potter handed him. He had to admit, it smelled good. And Potter seemed pleased about the heater, so he’d made the right call, there. There was one more thing he needed to do. He set the Chinese food down on the table, and pulled off the jumper Potter had given him, folded it, and held it out. “Here. Guess I don’t need this anymore, now that the heater’s fixed.”
“I’m afraid they’re necessary,” Corbyn said, holding up a parchment self-importantly. “How would you rate the prisoner’s behavior, on a scale of Outstanding to Dreadful? This will go on his permanent record, and be considered upon his opportunity for parole.”
Harry squinted at what was, admittedly, a very near duplicate of his signature.
Potter looked away, at the water on the floor. “Fine,” he said heavily. “I’ll be...downstairs.”
be his instinctual response.
“How’s it taste?”
Harry handed the bottle over. Malfoy looked like he needed it. It was Jack, and Malfoy’s reaction to that last time had been nothing but disgust, but at the moment, Malfoy was chugging it.
“I’m not a guest,” Draco reminded him.
I don't have a foot fetish, I swear.
He felt his stomach clench, again, and threw up in the sink, the acidic smell of coffee and bile stinging his nose.
Draco accepted it, his fingers steadier now. “Thanks,” he muttered, again, and drained the glass.
“Fine, I’ll stop nagging about it. It would just be...so easy to heal with magic.” They looked like they hurt, and Malfoy was in a bad enough way already.
Hermione looked back at Malfoy. “Your mother is safe with me, Draco. I promise you.”
Draco rubbed his hands over his face, threaded his fingers through his hair, still staring down. “I don’t need a lecture, Potter.”
But surely, after this morning, whatever strange notion of goodwill had prompted Potter to gift him with it was gone, and he’d want it returned to him.
“No, you want me to hate you,” Potter replied coolly. “You want me to scream and yell and hurt you, so you can hate me right back. I know that’s comfortable, but that’s not what you’re getting.”
Harry is so awkward in this, haha. It was almost painful to write.
And it was getting late, and Draco really didn’t want to miss Hermione’s call. So, with one last weary glance around the room, he headed downstairs.
Draco felt a shiver run down his spine.
Harry took the stairs down to the kitchen slowly, feeling gutted. He knew it had to be worse for Draco, but seeing what had happened to him firsthand, hearing yet again how much he hated himself, watching him break down like that--it turned Harry’s stomach. He reached for a bottle, uncorked it against the counter, and raised it halfway to his lips before something caught his eye. He set the bottle down.
And then he’d pinned Draco to the wall by his shoulder, so he couldn’t squirm, and carved the letters into him.
Harry almost spat out his coffee. “Um, none,” he sputtered. Knowing Malfoy, there was a trick coming, but he had no idea what it could be.
Draco watched him leave, and then sank to the floor again, eyes stinging, dry sobs wracking his chest. He struggled to take a shaky breath, unable to cry. It seemed he’d finally spent his tears, leaving a hollow, aching emptiness behind.
When Draco had finished fussing with the stove, he leaned back against the counter and picked up the apple. He held it in his hands, staring at it, twirling the stem.
Draco considered for a moment, eyeing a door nearby that looked like a storeroom. As soon as his fingers brushed the handle, however, Kreacher was back at it with the muttering.
“Still hurts,” Harry muttered. “When you start realizing all the marks life’s left on you.” He looked back at Draco, after a moment, and was surprised to find Draco staring straight back at him.
Draco pressed his hands against his eyes. “I know that. I know I don’t even deserve to feel guilty, I know I’ll never change any of it, no matter how much I suffer, I don’t need you to tell me.”
spell, until some sugar packets had come flying down from the top of his fridge. Draco hadn’t even asked him for sugar; Potter had just done it. Another one of those little things, that made Draco feel a tiny bit safer. He wasn’t sure what Potter’s reaction would be, however, if he knew Draco were looking for a way to escape.
Hermione screwed up her face in thought, regarding him over the rim of her mug. “You know, Harry, I still have a long way to go with my case. Maybe you ought to give Ron a call.”
“I told you,” Draco said, opening the fridge. “I don’t do anything I can’t do well…” He trailed off, staring into the fridge.
“Thanks,” he said hoarsely.
out for a moment.”
Draco could understand that, how Potter might find imagining himself as an adult easier. He’d certainly been treated like one by everyone around him. “You at least have to admit they were awful to you,” Draco said. “The Dursleys, I mean.”
Apparently Malfoy was awake enough now to plan his jibes more eloquently. He was also correct. Harry felt himself stiffen. He set his coffee cup down and ran a hand through his overgrown, slightly tangled black hair in silence.
Potter nodded. “I will, Hermione. It’s good to see you again.”
Harry was lying on his back on the floor in front of the fireplace, rolling an empty bottle between his palms. He was starting to suspect the sunrise would find him in the same position, still wide awake. It was just one of those nights. And the conversations he’d had with Malfoy were still turning in the back of his mind.
“He’s...he’s just feeling awful, and…” Harry struggled to find the words, not wanting to reveal too much without Draco’s permission. “The Aurors, in Azkaban, they did some really awful things to him. And whatever bad ideas he had about himself, between the Aurors and the Dementors, they’re a hundred times worse now, and I just...I have no idea what to do.”
The grandfather clock in the hall chimed fifteen past, and Hermione jumped. “Oh no, I really need to get going…”
“No,” Malfoy agreed. “It’s not.”
Anyway, hope y'all enjoyed, next one coming soon, please leave a comment, etc. <3
"Are you going to teach me, then?"
Malfoy opened his mouth and then shut it again, looking down at his lap. “I suppose you’re right, I’m in no position to be making threats.”
“You still haven’t learned when to shut up, Malfoy.”
Potter just smiled and shook his head, getting up to refill Draco’s cup, and dumped a few sugars into it before setting it back down in front of him.
“Maybe I have,” Potter said. “Maybe the world doesn’t need me anymore.”
Potter approached Draco, giving him a dark look, and then reached abruptly upwards towards his face.
Potter shrugged again. “Could have been worse.”
“We didn’t get along. What were you reading about?”
“What grandmother knitted you this for Christmas, and why do they hate you?” Draco asked.
exactly? He struggled to remember. He’d just...been Hagrid.
Draco turned back to give him a sharp look. “Really, Potter?”
How could Harry not think him weak? Draco recalled his panic attack from earlier—he was no stranger to them, but having one in front of Potter was beyond humiliating, all the same. But instead of mocking him, Potter had actually
“I don’t have any interest in making threats,” Harry said, his voice still quiet. “But I won’t live with someone who treats me like garbage. I’ve been there and done that, believe me. And we both know it's me or Azkaban.”
Draco leaned forward, looked at Potter until he caught his eyes, and held them. “So then, Potter, why don’t you give your friends the same credit?”
“Harry? Oy, Harry!”
It went back to being six, pulling his robes up to gingerly inspect a skinned knee, his father hauling him off the ground by his collar,
Thanks for all the comments on the last one! It was fun seeing everyone's take on my Draco and how he compares to canon Draco and other people's interpretations.
Draco considered. The marks from the chains around his wrists, ankles, and neck still burned, as well as the cuts from that arse-face Auror’s wand on his chest, and none of them were getting any better without magic. And his foot
Draco’s courage was beginning to leave him the more he stood in the dismal corridor of the chilly house. He could feel himself shivering in the thin, tattered clothes, and not entirely from the cold.
“Told you they weren’t ordinary chains,” Draco replied. “But you’re doing fine, honestly.” The tightness in his chest had receded, his breath slow and steady. Having Potter point a wand at him still made his stomach clench--an instinct that wasn’t going away any time soon--but he wasn’t truly afraid.
And then Potter had to go and be all nice. Potter hadn’t even mocked him for his reaction, he’d just gone on about healing him again.
“I’ll, um, leave you to it,” Potter said, standing up and giving Draco an awkward, two-finger salute. He left, taking the stairs down to the kitchen to apparently give Draco some privacy.
“It’s um…It’s warm. Thanks.” Malfoy sounded like he choked a little on the words, but there was an undercurrent of sincerity to them.
“Okay.” Potter took another bite of toast. “Try not to drown.”
down. Like I should have tried harder, been a better friend. But I guess you can’t help someone who doesn’t want to be helped.”
Harry didn’t laugh. He didn’t find the terrible state of Malfoy’s health very funny.
Draco couldn’t see Potter’s face, standing behind him, but he heard him scoff, and could guess what his expression was like.
“Well, we’re trapped in a house together, I’d say we have plenty of time to practice.”
He turned his attention back to Malfoy. “Regardless of whether you can actually act on it or not, I just don’t want you to think like that.”
“You just figure everyone’s better off without you,” Ron finished, cutting him off.
Hermione folded her hands in her lap, raised an eyebrow at him. “I’m listening.”
Harry winced internally at the slight jab. He did feel guilty about that, but at the moment, they both had more important concerns.
Malfoy was running his fingers through his hair, seemingly trying to untangle it. He paused, and looked up. “Well…I’d take a glass of water, if you…if you don’t mind.”
Harry put his head in his hands, waiting for the onslaught of disapproval.
“If you’d activated the curse at all, it would glow, apparently, but otherwise it’s not noticeable. It’s not supposed to trouble you, just Draco.” Hermione sounded disgusted.
Wide-awake, Harry folded his arms. How dare they. How dare the ministry show up at his house—when he’d made it very clear he wanted nothing to do with them—and drag his enemy onto his doorstep? And into his
Harry rubbed a hand over his aching shoulders. Healing Draco had taken more out of him than he’d like to admit, but at the same time, he felt as if a weight had been lifted. The marks on Draco, his small, half-hidden winces here and there, had been eating at the back of Harry’s mind since Draco had arrived in his custody. Maybe it was his ‘Saving People Thing,’ as Hermione would have said. But whatever the reason, Harry felt a little closer to Draco, now. Maybe it was just their situation, their forced proximity to one another, or maybe it had been being that close to Draco, hearing his breath slowly steady as Harry methodically healed him. He thought of the hand Draco had offered him, pulling him to his feet, and bit his lip.
Draco swore. “Are you sure you’re doing that right?” It stung more than he’d thought it would.
“I do,” Hermione said seriously.
“Yes, she’s doing well, sitting right here…” Hermione’s head disappeared, Draco could make out some muffled chatter, and then, finally, he could see his mother’s face in the flames.
“Yes, but he said they were impossible to escape. I think he was telling the truth, he seems to say everything he’s thinking out loud.”
Harry sat on the couch, bouncing his leg and checking his watch so often he was sure it was going backwards.
“Can’t sleep either,” Harry mumbled. “What is it that’s keeping you up?”
“That doesn’t mean I’m going to stop acting like a human being.”
He had a point, there, it had been a long time since Harry had cleaned, and it wasn’t like he’d had the intention of doing so anytime soon. But still…
Potter turned around and kicked a chair away from the table, giving Draco’s knuckles a glance and a wince.
hideous,” Harry protested.
Potter looked away. “Even if they did, I probably wore that out years ago. Maybe at this point, I’m better off alone.”
“Then die wondering.” And with that, Draco climbed the stairs to his room, picked his way through the broken glass, and curled up on his bed. Unable to resist the sobs anymore, he let them wrack him, like waves on the shore.
“Hm, so you’ve recalled you own a wand after all,” Draco drawled.
P.S. I forgot to mention, I've broken 20,000 words on this fic! that's the most I've ever written of a single story, and definitely the most I've written in such a short amount of time, I'm really proud. Thank you guys for all the support and encouragement!
“What do you dream about?” Harry asked.
“I suspect there’s nothing you can say, after everything.” Hermione took a sip of coffee. She looked exhausted, dark bags under her eyes, robes a little crumpled. Her braids were beginning to get a little grown out, Harry noticed, sagging around her face. He guessed she hadn’t had a day to devote to herself in a while, let alone her hair.
“No, but now that I think about it, a call would have been nice, maybe once in the past
Malfoy didn’t answer him, he just kept drinking.
Malfoy stared down at the slightly sticky, crumpled packets for a moment, obviously stifling his disgust, and then tore into all four at once and dumped them into the coffee. He took a sip and shut his eyes in contentment. “Perfect.”
“You going to punch me, or give me a hug?” Potter asked.
Potter ignored the question. “It won’t help anything.”
Draco leaned back against the counter with a sigh. “I thought I missed chocolate, but this is…”
” Harry looked up at her, dumbfounded.
Potter nodded.
I'm in the middle of some relationshit right now, every grocery store looks like the apocalypse swept through, and this fic is such a nice distraction. I've actually written a little ahead for once, so expect another update soon. Love you all <3
Finally, Harry's finally decided he needs to call Hermione, finally. We'll see how that plays out in the next one, haha
The Dementors are one of my favorite things in Harry Potter, I've always seen them as a metaphor for PTSD and the way it makes people feel. The fact that they affect the most traumatized people the most is super chilling to me and makes them super scary.
Hopefully I did him justice, I love him so much, my sweet ginger child, he has so many emotions <3
Potter offered his arm, and Draco reached for it tremulously and closed his shivering fingers around Potter’s wrist.
Harry was tired of hearing it. “You could try being nice to yourself, you know. Just once.”
When Potter came back from the kitchen, he was holding two mugs. He handed one to Draco. “Here. I put this potion in it--it’s an instant hangover cure.”
“Right,” Draco said, changing his mind about the drink and swiping the bottle from Potter to steal a sip. He almost spat it out. He shoved the bottle back. “That is
“Or whomever she likes.” Malfoy must have known he was hitting a nerve, cause a cold smile spread over his face. “Wish I’d been placed with her, instead. Sounds like fun.”
“I’m not trying to lecture you, just...maybe you should eat something, instead.”
Harry shrugged. “I’m rubbish at charms.”
He couldn’t sleep anyway—that had been the third nightmare to wake him up—so he climbed the stairs to the second floor.
No matter what theory Draco came up with, he couldn’t seem to make the pieces fit.
messed up, after we...lost ya. I probably couldn’t have gotten much worse. So yeah. It helped.” He looked up finally, giving Harry a cheeky grin. “You oughta try it yourself.”
Ron sighed. “That sounds like my wife, too.” He turned to the side, craning his neck to check the clock. “Was just about to bring her lunch, actually. You know how she gets when she’s working on something.”
“Don’t,” Draco mumbled. “Don’t be nice, I don’t think I could bear it.”
Thought I'd post the second chapter, since I already had it written.
“I’m not
Finally, thank you to everyone who's still reading, it means a lot <3 I've been getting back into writing after a long hiatus and this fic is getting me back into the habit of writing every day. I've been really enjoying it.
Once the thought took hold, it wouldn’t let go, and Draco’s fingers were shaking harder. He tried to take a deep, steadying breath, but drawing in air felt like breathing sand.
“I’m a bit of a sorry excuse for one,” Potter said, reaching up to push his glasses up his nose before seeming to realize he wasn’t wearing them.
“What do you think they’d say, if they saw you now?” Harry asked. He was curious--both as to how close Draco had actually been to his friends back in school, and as to how Draco saw himself these days.
Draco looked down at himself, on the couch, a musty-smelling blanket laid over him. Had Potter done that? Draco struggled to remember the night before. It was very, very foggy. He was fairly certain he remembered holding Potter’s hand, but that couldn’t be real, could it? Then he remembered the crying, and the apologizing, and laid back down, a deep blush spreading over his face.
