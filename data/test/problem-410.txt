“No, you just said there were books written about the Potters. Did you read them? You knew my ancestors by name.”
Harry got the Snitch, anyway, which he would have bragged about years later if not for – well. He flew down, laid down onto the grass, studied the sky and laughed, flushed with victory and triumph. But Malfoy, who was a sore loser, argued that Harry was cheating. He also said Harry was mad for seeing that particular cloud as a crown, when it was so clearly a snake. And they were still arguing, like they were friends, and Harry was still laughing, and it seemed so natural to lean over and kiss him.
He looked back at Malfoy. The love bite on Malfoy’s neck was more proof that yesterday hadn’t been a dream, it had been real.
“Oh, shut up,” Malfoy huffed, “I don’t want to hear anything from you, you probably wash your face with dish soap and yet you still – ” Malfoy closed his mouth abruptly.
Malfoy put the glasses on and slouched his shoulders dramatically. “Er, hello,” he said, voice ridiculously low. “I’m, er, Harry. Harry Potter. Oh, you don’t know me? That’s probably not true. I’m really, er, famous, but it’s pretty annoying since I’m just an ordinary guy. By the way, this is my best side. I’ve saved the wizarding world twice but I’m ashamed of myself for failing to save everyone in the world because everything in the world is my responsibility. Er sorry, who did you want that autograph signed out to?”
Even worse was that he realised something – Malfoy was kind of attractive. Kind of. Barely. Just a little.
The first one he’d had so many times he didn’t wake up, only made distressed noises in his sleep that he hoped Malfoy couldn’t hear. The other one made him bolt up, sweaty and out of breath, brown limbs tangled all up in white sheets. He looked over at Malfoy’s bed, where he could still see Malfoy’s bright hair against his pillow, and then he fell back in bed.
“I have to go talk to Zabini or I think he’ll do something drastic,” Harry said, remembering. He staggered up, looking down wistfully at the warm bed and grabbed his robes out of his trunk before he moved towards the bathroom.
me? Because you’re a hero, and that’s what you do, I suppose, to feel good about yourself, feel like there’s a reason to – ”
“Potter,” Malfoy said, taking a deep breath. “Since you probably only remember half of these people, that’s Blaise, Daphne, Theo, Greg, Millie, and Pansy.”
McGonagall’s gaze became gentler. “If you don’t, there’s been some talk about introducing a wizarding program for Muggleborn and half-blood children, to commingle with pureblood children – I thought perhaps you might like to be apart of it.”
Harry is still holding Malfoy’s hand. Should he let go? Maybe he should wait for Malfoy to let go. But what if Malfoy is waiting for
Harry tried, again, to be affronted. He was sure he would have punched Malfoy in the face for such a remark before, but instead he felt the wonderful momentary urge to laugh again. Malfoy, on the other hand, had that pinched expression again, like he’d said something he shouldn’t have said. He was muttering to himself again, saying, “Exactly the kind of situation I was trying to avoid, of
“We always get vanilla,” Harry says, and puts a pint of vanilla into the trolley anyway. They always get vanilla, or that fake-looking turquoise stuff, or salted caramel. He puts a few more pints of different ice cream into the trolley. Malfoy carefully arranges them around him.
“You’re wearing mine,” Harry says defensively. He’d just thought that it would help the illusion that he and Malfoy are in love if he wore Malfoy’s ring.
Zabini was standing in front of Malfoy’s bed, looking completely refreshed and not hungover at all, the bastard.
“Pans,” Blaise said in an undertone, aiming a smile over at Harry. Malfoy stiffened beside him. “Harry. How is Miss Weasley?”
“I like him more,” Harry said, letting Teddy clutch his pinky and planting a kiss in his hair as he enacted a play for Harry involving two potatoes that George had given him.
Harry chewed on the end of his quill and sang under his breath, “You are my candy girl,” until he realised what he was doing and stopped, appalled.
a real Black, and if you think I’m not going there with you, you’re even more crazy than I thought.” It was only Harry, Malfoy and the little second year at first, but news had spread. A whole crowd of Harry’s students had come to him, nervous and stammering, and asked to stay with him. A fourth year who didn’t want to be around her uncle, a first year who only had an orphanage to go back to, a fifth year whose family had kicked him out – and Harry had never felt more right about his decision to teach, or his decision to help these abandoned souls. He had been saved. They were going to be saved too.
They pass pleasantries back and forth. Harry remembers to ask Rafael for an autograph; he makes it out to
Harry rolls his eyes the way Remus does when Sirius sleeps in. Malfoy extends his hand – long, pale, slim – and waits for Harry impatiently. Harry hesitates, then entwines his hand with Malfoy’s. It doesn’t mean anything, not really, but Harry feels his heartbeat quicken. He hopes his hand isn’t sweaty. (Malfoy’s isn’t. It’s cool, and soft, probably because of the lotion he applies at night.)
He and Ron had abstained from joining the Quidditch team this year, even though it hurt, a bit, but they went out flying on weekends or free periods, to the library with Hermione to study, to Hagrid’s hut to drink tea and pretend to eat rock cakes. Sometimes they went to the Gryffindor common room after classes, which would always feel like home, where no one minded much that they stayed there, and Ginny joined them. But they went to their common room too, where the knight opened her gravelly mouth to ask for the password and the queen opened her eyes, and they moved aside so Harry, Ron, and Hermione could go inside. And inside would be the rest of their year: Terry Boot and Lisa Turpin examining the bookshelves while they humoured Anthony Goldstein talking to them at length about his latest dream, the Patil twins and Susan chatting with Dean and Seamus, Neville and Justin Finch-Fletchley talking earnestly about their Herbology N.E.W.T class, and the Slytherins in a corner together.
He came out of the bathroom in flannel pyjama bottoms that had belonged to Dudley when he was eleven and only remotely fit Harry now, and a Holyhead Harpies T-shirt that Ginny had bought him. Thinking of Ginny didn’t make things any easier, but at least Malfoy had already gotten into bed and wasn’t looking at him. Harry tried not to look at him either, and made his way over to his bed.
Malfoy huffed out a quiet laugh. “You know, I swore a solemn oath to never break our mutual enmity in first year. I had Pansy, Greg, and – ” His voice stumbled. “And, and Crabbe, witness it. On pain of bloody, merciless death.”
Harry squinted down and saw them: Ginny riding on Blaise’s back, Neville and Justin and Susan looking a bit embarrassed, Seamus cat-calling at them with his arms around Dean, Luna clapping vaguely, Ron and Hermione looking pleased for him as well as averting their eyes, Daphne and the Patil twins with sunhats to cover their hair from the sun, Terry and Lisa and Anthony holding brooms. They were all holding brooms, actually, except for Daphne, Parvati, Justin, and Hermione.
He forgot, that even if Malfoy was on his side now, he hadn’t miraculously turned into a better person.
“I hate you,” Harry tells him, but he doesn’t. He left behind hating Malfoy back in sixth year, though he didn’t know it then, and now, he thinks that even if he tried to despise him once again – tried to remember Malfoy’s lips curling up in a sneer, tried to remember all the taunts and jeers and various bullying, tried to remember
?” Harry demanded. He could not believe he had thought Blaise was all right. Blaise was clearly not all right at all, he was a –
“Sorry?” Harry echoed, bemused, but Malfoy slipped out of bed, grabbed his robes, and went into the bathroom before Harry could say anything else. He was alarmingly quick. It was like he was trying to make sure he and Harry weren’t alone together for longer than a few seconds. This was not what Harry had expected in any way shape or form, if he had expected this at all, which he hadn’t.
, our most beloved saviour and all that. I just didn’t think it would be appreciated, coming from me.”
“I’m not really engaged to Malfoy,” Harry says, just to make things clear. He may be deceiving everyone in his life by telling them he’s dating Malfoy, but at least he’s not pretending he’s getting married.
“So have you two realised you’re in love with each other yet?” Hermione asks. “Harry, I genuinely thought you were dating Draco before this whole fiasco with...a wedding cake?”
. It mostly just felt like everything had felt, lately, like nothing. The Sorting went by like it always had, and so did the feast. But when Hagrid waved over to him, and gave him a crushing hug, he felt like he was back home. That meant something, at least.
Ginny laughed, wild and free, and went to sit in Neville’s lap where he was perched on an armchair, probably just so she could see how red Ron’s face would get. Luna balanced herself precariously on the arm of the chair and crossed her legs at the ankles. Harry thought he could see what it must have been like, the three of them during that year at Hogwarts he, Ron, and Hermione had missed. No wonder he and Ginny couldn’t understand each other after a year apart at war.
Harry blinked and saw him go inside with the password Daphne had said before. Then it was just him and Malfoy standing in front of the door.
“I don’t!” Harry says. “For Merlin’s sake, I don’t really like him. He’s a good friend. That’s all. Why were you being so – ” Harry searches for the right words.
“Can you find your way home?” Ron asks him, looking around at their surroundings with an expression close to nostalgia.
“You were right just once,” said Harry, and let himself relax into Malfoy’s touch. As soon as he did, Malfoy leaped away and looked strange for a moment. Next moment he was perfectly normal again, and they went to have dinner in the kitchen before making their way to separate rooms.
“Think I’ll survive,” Ron said. He either missed the Malfoy conversation, or he’s not mentioning it, which was probably a good thing. Not that it mattered, all that much.
They kept the curtains in the compartment closed. There were crowds of people trying to catch a glimpse of Harry, reporters from the
“They were important magical figures,” Malfoy said, “which you would know if you’d ever listened in History of Magic, Potter, you imbecile. Binns mentioned it in
, he couldn’t think of anything other than what he had lost: the feeling in his throat, the pricking of his eyes, the
“Ah,” Harry says weakly. Malfoy. Has dreams about Harry sucking his dick? After a moment, because it’s true, and Malfoy isn’t going to remember this in the morning, Harry says, “I’ve had dreams about sucking your dick.”
Ron gives him an amused look, then Apparates himself and Hermione out of Hogsmeade and back to their home.
Malfoy leaned forward and grabbed hold of his collar. Harry stared back, startled. “Harry,” he said quietly, “in fifth year you came back from the summer and I wanted to kiss you, and I hated myself for it. In sixth year, you were everywhere and I hated you for it. Last year you were my only hope. Now, you’re, and this is incredibly depressing and mortifying, my best friend. Every time I went over to Nuwa and Ester’s, all the girls did was tease me about you. You are so
“Thanks,” Malfoy said, and licked his lips, and really, who could blame Harry for bringing him in by his arm and kissing him? If anyone blamed Harry they had to blame Malfoy for kissing him back and pressing him against the door of the classroom, while the music was playing in the background:
“Mrs Weasley, it’s really nice of you to offer to bake our wedding cake,” Harry says, at the monthly Weasley dinner, for the fifteenth time. “But like I told you, we’re pretty set on Dean’s sister’s bakery.”
He didn’t want to think about being apart from Malfoy, how this tentative friendship could fall apart and they’d come back unsure of each other.
“That’s Teddy’s new favourite thing to say,” Andromeda said. She had entered the sitting room and was standing behind Harry with an unreadable look on her face. “You’re slow truck. I’ve got no idea what it means.”
“I knew he was doing evil,” Harry said. “That’s why. I was stalking in the name of good.” That didn’t sound right. “I was right, anyway.”
“I’m not faking.” Malfoy’s words come out in a rush. “I’m not pretending. I want this for real. So if you don’t, tell me now.”
“Hi Harry,” Luna greets him. Her hair is braided in a style so reminiscent of Ginny, it must have been Ginny who braided it, and her eyes are wide and silvery under big, plastic glasses. Harry feels a rush of fondness towards her.
Malfoy rolled his eyes and let Pansy stroke his hair until she had forgotten about it. He was clearly so happy that Harry couldn’t grudge Pansy for it at all. He kept beaming at Harry in-between insults about Harry’s hair, and listening to Goyle, and laughing with Millie, and stealing Theo’s drinks.
He missed Sirius and Lupin so much that he sat down behind one of the greenhouses and let himself cry like he hadn’t since fifth year, mourn what had been lost and what would never return. And the stupidest thing of all, the thing he’d known all this time, the thing he kept thinking was,
Harry tore his gaze away. “Sorry, mate,” he told Ron, and smothered a grin. “Want to punch me to make things even?”
“Are you alright?” said Hermione, while the rest of their housemates watched on in interest, most of them staring suspiciously at Malfoy while the Slytherins glared at Harry.
Harry trailed after him as he tossed T-shirts and trousers in Harry’s arms. “How do you know my size?”
“Pay attention, Potter,” Malfoy said, grinning at him, “I don’t want to win just because you’re distracted by my beauty.”
“Yes,” Luna said peacefully, stealing Harry’s treacle tart. “I think he’s always been a bit scared of you, although in many ways he’s one of the only people who isn’t afraid of you.” Harry let this nonsensical statement go, since it was par for the course with Luna. “I’ve seen a lot of Wrackspurts around Draco. They can make it hard for him to think, and when you’re around, it’s even harder. You should talk to him about it.”
“She thinks of me as a friend,” says Ginny glumly, heaving herself up using her thighs. “Just a friend, which is. Fine. ’S alright, I’ll go visit George and Lee. They’re my second choice because I’m not in the mood to be pranked.” She strides past Harry to the fireplace, leaning up on her tiptoes to ruffle his hair on the way.
They did not look convinced in the slightest, but when Dean stifled a yawn, Seamus dragged him upstairs, shooting a dirty look at Zabini. Harry wasn’t sure why, other than that Zabini was sharing a room with Dean, but he was too tired to try and figure it out. He waved off Ron and Hermione’s concern, and went up to bed with Ron. With a last strange look at Harry, Hermione bid them good night and went upstairs with Daphne Greengrass. He thought that Zabini and Malfoy were still downstairs, but when he and Ron reached their dorms, he heard the sound of them following their footsteps.
Harry reached up to rub at his eyes and sniffled. He and McGonagall shared a moment of mutual understanding silence, before he thought to say, “You mean – my dad and Sirius, they – ” He could not think of a way to phase this delicately other than
“That’s Harry-speak for, we slept together but I don’t remember anything about it,” Ginny translates. “You’re such a floozy.”
discovery for historians, but anyways, I’ve got a transcript in the book somewhere, someone tried to translate the language and put it in more modern words...there. Isolda’s the daughter.”
Harry tries not to stare. He feels warm inside, and kind of wants to replay Malfoy’s words over and over and over again, even though they were a little insulting. “Oh.” He clears his throat. “We were, er, discussing something.”
“You weren’t?” Dean looks startled again. “Well, I’m thinking of – I’m thinking of proposing to Seamus.”
They fought that whole year – when Malfoy would say something bigoted or insulting, when Harry would make a pointed remark about Slytherins or Snape. They fought over anything and over everything, but Malfoy kept sitting next to him in Potions, and Harry kept letting him.
With the hand that wasn’t curled up around Malfoy’s back, Harry flipped him off and gestured down in a way he hoped meant that he clearly could not move, and clutched his head because the simple act of looking down was
“You didn’t hear him,” Harry said, but all he could think of was Malfoy’s constant presence at Hogwarts and Malfoy’s shaking hand touching his scar. “You’re – you’re really alright with this?”
Malfoy seemed antsy too. Two days before they were set to leave he hit the chandelier with a Quaffle they’d been tossing back and forth in the hallway, one throw each for a question about Transfiguration. Harry spent ten minutes making fun of him.
“Potter,” Malfoy says softly, and then changes his mind and says, “Harry. Do you want this for real?”
Inviting Malfoy to Grimmauld Place became clear as an awful idea as soon as they walked through the door. Malfoy’s chattering woke up the portrait of Sirius’s mad old mum and she began bellowing about half-blood filth and blood traitors.
Hermione smiled at him when he sat down, but her gaze was on the Slytherins. She said, “I am trying to understand, you know.”
“Yes, but she went to France for the war,” Hermione said. “Lots of Slytherins stayed out of it, actually, like Zabini – ”
Malfoy looked flummoxed, but when Teddy failed to run away screaming about birthday presents from him, he seemed to let the truck comment go in favour of helping Teddy draw a rocket ship airplane and a rocket ship castle. Teddy’s hair started turning platinum blonde.
Harry gritted his teeth. “Just give it to me, and I’ll come down when – ” He looked at Malfoy, who looked peaceful and still in sleep the way he never was in real life, mouth curled into an uncertain shape instead of a sneer. He remembered Malfoy murmuring nonsense in his sleep last night but he hadn’t minded. He remembered Malfoy helping him sleep, too. For a moment he thought about reaching out to touch Malfoy’s hair.
sorry, he realised, even though he should have been, for Hermione’s sake at least. He wasn’t sorry at all. He wouldn’t take it back for anything.
“And I’ve got something for you,” Harry told him, handing him a present in green wrapping paper. It was a book about Curse-Breaking that Malfoy had been talking about all month; he’d gotten it from Tomes and Scrolls when he, Ron, and Hermione had gone to Hogsmeade, and Daphne had wrapped the book for him in exchange for the chance to threaten him about hurting Malfoy.
“It’s okay, leave it,” Harry said to Ron and Hermione, and Zabini put his hands over his beautiful face and murmured, “I can’t watch.”
“Sounds good.” Dean gives Harry a cheerful goodbye and heads out of the kitchen, heedless of the bombshell he’s just dropped on Harry’s head. Harry spends a few more minutes in the kitchen, shaking his head and marveling at the fact that Dean used to have a crush on him and Seamus had glared at him for it and he hadn’t noticed. Then he pauses to wonder if Seamus had glared at him in sixth year because of
He didn’t want to think about it. Last year they’d gone out drinking, and Hermione had wanted him to come to the war memorial, and he could not have brought himself to do it. The rest of them had gone and Harry had stayed at Grimmauld Place with Luna. He had wanted the war to be over. It was just a day. He didn’t like the way Hermione held on to him and Ron tighter, like they would vanish, or the way the Weasleys all got hollow-eyed, or the way the members of the D.A. looked at him hungrily, like they were in awe.
Malfoy tapped his empty glass of Firewhiskey and muttered a spell; it transformed into a pair of glasses that looked identical to Harry’s.
“Some do,” Malfoy said. “Mother’s always gotten her skincare items imported from France, a witch named Gladys, bit of a show-off, really – ”
“I’m a patron for all things Right and Just and Saintly, except for when I totally cheated in Potions, but I still never got in any trouble for that, because I’m loved by everyone – ”
“Please,” Harry whimpers, “don’t say things like that. And I dunno, Hermione, I thought so at first, but what does he have to be jealous about?”
“I’m sure,” Harry assures her. He is sure, even though he and Malfoy have had a ridiculous amount of arguments in the past year. They always came back to each other. He can’t imagine being with anyone else. So what is the point of waiting?
Hermione, with a pitying glance at Ron, changes the subject to the bastards at work who are ignoring her petitions for house-elf rights. Malfoy leans forward and starts arguing with her animatedly. Harry watches him fondly, and doesn’t make himself look away – because he doesn’t need to, at least for now. He’s helping the illusion that he and Malfoy are in love.
“C’mon,” Harry murmured, lifting up his trunk and going over to the others, because he didn’t think he could stand to be here. “Let’s find a compartment.”
Problem Number 1 was easy to push away too. It was alright if Malfoy was a little attractive. Everyone in Harry’s friend group was a little attractive.
who is the reason that everyone in Harry’s life thinks he’s going to marry Draco Malfoy. But kidnapping Malfoy will ultimately accomplish nothing, except to convince his friends and family that he has some kinks to sort out. So while the blame, surely, lies with Malfoy, it’s Dean Thomas who Harry has to kidnap because it’s Dean Thomas who has just witnessed Harry trying free samples of wedding cake with Draco sodding Malfoy.
“Longbottom,” says Malfoy to Neville, inclining his head. “You’re looking good. Not as good as my precious baby cakes, of course.”
Pansy looks up. Her sparkly black eyeliner is applied expertly, but the skin under her eyes is red, and her cheeks are wet. “Potter,” she says. “Good, I’ve been waiting for you.”
He wasn’t worried about losing Ron and Hermione. Or, maybe he was a little. He just didn’t like that feeling that he was a hanger-on, unnecessary to their dynamic. And also, even though there was not a lot of privacy in a tent or the Burrow and he had basically seen it all, he wasn’t interested in watching them make out.
“I don’t know, that’s in the future.” Harry looks back at Narcissa anxiously. “Right now, I want to be with your son, and treat him well. That’s all that matters, isn’t it?”
And the door closed again before Harry could say anything, not that he knew what he would say, not that he needed to say anything. He wondered whether Malfoy was going to be a bastard about this. Surely not, since Blaise –
“We already moved on with our friendship!” Harry says. “We, er, kissed in sixth year, and he ran away. So he didn’t like me back then, and he doesn’t like me back now.”
Malfoy, following Remus, pulls him gently inside the sitting room and settles on a couch that is much more comfortable than the one in their flat. He lets go of Harry’s hand. Harry tries not to miss the way Malfoy’s hand had felt against his own, and fails.
“Anthony probably wouldn’t mind switching,” Ron agreed. “He hasn’t got much history with Malfoy. No one would even notice, it’s not like McGonagall would find out.”
Malfoy’s gramophone”, but they went on searching through every place Malfoy thought she was likely to be. Harry did try suggesting asking Blaise and Daphne, but even he knew they would just laugh. Everyone, even Hermione, who was quite impressed that the music worked at Hogwarts and shocked that Malfoy had watched a Muggle film at all, was getting pretty tired of hearing ‘(I’ve Had) The Time of My Life’ for the seventeenth hundred time. Except for Harry, that is.
And Malfoy was everywhere, his empty cup of coffee on his desk and his books neatly stacked on every shelf and his green-and-silver scarf tossed lazily on the bed. Harry’s next class was with him. Harry
On one of the first days he’d slept at Malfoy’s flat, he’d woken up shaking and sweating from a nightmare about dying or Voldemort or the war or everything. Harry was used to those sorts of dreams. He had one nearly every night. He’d climbed out of bed, trembling, and gone to make himself a cup of hot cocoa, the way Remus would do whenever he got sick, and he had found Malfoy in the kitchen.
On impulse – which was the way Harry did most things – Harry slipped his hand into Parvati’s and when she looked up at him, she smiled, a bit reluctantly.
Harry is uncomfortably aware of what, exactly, it looks like: Malfoy, sitting close to Harry, ankle hooked around his – because that’s the way Malfoy
“Cheers,” Harry said, grinning back and shoving his hands in his pockets so he didn’t do something stupid like grab Malfoy by his robes and steer him inside so they could fall asleep on his bed.
He had faith that Malfoy would not be able to stand the silence for longer than a few minutes and his faith was rewarded. Malfoy sighed again, loudly, and said, “I did some research.”
“Harry,” said Hermione, folding her hands in her lap and staring at him in an incredibly frightening way. “Would you, perhaps, like to explain the Draco Malfoy situation to us now?”
Malfoy’s head snaps up. “Excuse you,” he says in tones of deep and dark offence. “Obviously, I know roses are your favourite flower. You have no sophistication, and probably only know the names of five types of flowers, and you like classic things, and red is one of your favourite colours,
He had tried to approach the topic with Malfoy. In hindsight, he wished he hadn’t, or had at least picked a more crowded place to talk to him. At the time, Harry had figured the secluded, empty Quidditch pitch was a perfect place, and he’d been itching to fly anyway, so he’d suggested a match with Malfoy.
Malfoy’s gaze flickered down to Harry’s hand and Harry let go quickly, unsettled down in his bones for a reason he couldn’t put into words.
Harry sat back down and tried not to think about Malfoy in the shower, damp hair and sweet-smelling shampoo, droplets of water falling down his neck, because that was weird.
A flock of birds scattered away at the sound of his voice and Malfoy looked at him shocked, like someone had suddenly hit him. “You don’t. You can’t,” he said, and reached one hand out like he wanted to touch Harry but let it fall to the side.
“It’s a Muggle thing,” Harry tells him. “Superstition. If your eyelash falls, you blow on it, and make a wish.” Harry had always made the same wish as a child: to leave the Dursleys, or to have a family, or to have a home. And it had come true, however many years later.
“Yeah, I mean.” Harry looked down at the table and thought of Malfoy’s sneering face and pointed barbs and the way he had picked the wrong side; Hermione’s shuttered face the first time she heard the word Mudblood and the scars on Bill’s face. “You guys don’t have to talk to him or anything, but we are roommates, and I think this is probably better than the alternative – ”
Teddy kept looking at Malfoy curiously, so when Andromeda went into the kitchen to check how her house-elf was doing with refreshments, Harry dragged Malfoy aside to say, “Go talk to Teddy.”
They didn’t talk about it. They went back to being whatever they were, and Harry didn’t listen to Hermione’s advice again – at least not her advice about Malfoy. He Owled Sirius and Remus instead, and felt so utterly homesick for them – for Remus’s bone-crushing hugs and the millions of kisses Sirius would plant in his hair – that he forgot about Malfoy for a bit.
Malfoy has either forgotten about their joined hands or doesn’t care. Either way, Harry isn’t about to complain. He pushes down any stray thoughts about how that isn’t a strictly platonic way of thinking, and focuses on Malfoy’s excited voice, comforting and familiar as rain starts falling down amongst them.
Oh yes she would, he thought next, grimly, and he couldn’t stop thinking about it as they said goodbye to Hermione and went up their stairs. There was a long corridor that stretched out, three rooms on one side and two on the other, each with a door and names written on the door.
What is the challenge, really? To give Malfoy a chance at redemption? To love Malfoy? Whatever the case, Harry has done it a thousand times over. He’d like to keep doing it for the rest of his life.
Harry didn’t know why it mattered to him whether Malfoy went or not, either, but it did. So he got his Invisibility Cloak and went with Seamus and Ron to bring back a couple of cartons of Firewhiskey and bottles of Butterbeer, while Neville and the Hufflepuffs brought back appropriate snacks from the kitchens. Hermione and Dean, elected as the most responsible and likely candidates that McGonagall would listen to, came back and said McGonagall had given them permission; by then Harry was feeling rather attached to this idea and the rush he always got from breaking the rules, so the idea of permission only mattered in that he’d rather never disappoint Professor McGonagall ever. Malfoy and Anthony Goldstein had found a way to connect to the Wizarding Wireless Network on a gramophone that Malfoy caressed terrifyingly before setting down. Neville had stumbled into Ginny and Luna on his way to the kitchens, and came back with them in tow, shrugging helplessly at the look on Ron’s face as if to say
“Of course you’d say that,” murmurs Harry, fighting the urge to roll his eyes at Malfoy’s coffee obsession. You’d think that a man who was surrounded by coffee all day and night would eventually get tired of it, but not Malfoy.
“She’s going to tell Filch and I’ve got my Cloak in the common room,” Harry said, “turn that thing off!”
Pansy flapped her hand around, scowling. “Oh, fine. I don’t understand why he gets all angry and upset. I miss when we were all
“Draco had his heart set on staying in Britain,” Zabini said. “Oh, Narcissa tried to convince him, once
Harry looked out at the field in front of them, blinked against sudden sunlight, took a deep breath in and let it out. “Yeah.”
September had whittled away before he knew it, red-gold leaves crunching under his feet when he went to visit Hagrid wearing his Weasley jumpers for warmth. He started sitting with Malfoy in Charms and Potions. Listening to him was a lot more interesting than listening to lessons. They went down to meals together when he wasn’t with Ron and Hermione, or when Malfoy wasn’t with Blaise and Daphne. The days had gone by until the Halloween decorations were being put up, and Peeves was loudly singing insulting parodies of traditional wizarding Halloween songs in the corridors between classes, until it was the night before the day his parents had been murdered.
Malfoy was quiet for so long Harry turned around to check on him, sliding him a plate of pancakes and bacon. He was frowning, looking at the table.
“The Sorting Hat almost put me in Slytherin,” Harry said thoughtfully, even though he hadn’t even told Ron and Hermione that.
“I don’t want you to do anything you don’t want to, that’s all.” Malfoy didn’t want to kiss him back then, and Harry hasn’t deluded himself into thinking he does now.
The girl made a face. “That shit’s archaic, mate.” She seemed to notice Harry for the first time and her surprised eyebrows made a return. “Soz, mind my manners. I’m Ester, pronouns she slash her. Are you Draz’s boyfriend?” She punched Malfoy in the arm again and whispered loudly, “You didn’t tell me about him! He’s a bit of an alright, isn’t he?”
“Oh, thank Merlin,” Malfoy breathed, clutching at the bottle and downing all of it in one gulp. When he finished he made a face and shook his head, like a cat shaking off water. Harry watched him and tried not to smile.
than concussions.” He thought about the wisdom or lack thereof in saying Death Eaters in front of Malfoy, whose shoulders tensed for a moment. He added, “And Madam Pomfrey is probably asleep now.”
Harry stared at his bed, stolen by a diabolical, merciless, and snoring Slytherin, and then at Malfoy’s, which was really just too big for him, Harry reasoned. He took off his own shoes and socks and then his shirt and jeans, tossing them in a random direction, and walked over to Malfoy’s bed.
There’s a silence. Harry thinks he might have actually shocked Malfoy into not talking, which is a first. They’ve never really talked about what they are, but Harry had thought
He thought about asking Malfoy to fall asleep together again, but he couldn’t imagine actually asking for that, even if he phrased it like a – an arrangement for the good of their ability to focus on class, or something. It was fine. The company, he thought, worked too.
Ron was hopping up and down on one foot and cursing his name, and Ginny and the rest were laughing over something Luna’d said, but Hermione, pausing in the middle of consoling Ron, looked up. “Well, I suppose he’s got no chance of succeeding without N.E.W.T.S, does he, especially now?” she said, and beneath her words was the bewildered implication:
a catch,” Ron said. “What d’you mean, you’ve never had a crush on me? You had a crush on Malfoy and not me?”
,” Malfoy said, laughing like a hyena. This was the first time Harry had ever seen Malfoy laugh, really laugh, and it was disconcerting.
Adriana Fawley, one of Harry’s fifth year students, tall and wiry with light brown skin the same colour as Harry’s, stands uncertainly in front of him, hands clasped together. “I know, sir. I had a – question for you.”
“Hi, Harry,” she said, walking over to him. “Can I sit here?” When he nodded, she sat down in the chair across from him. If she was surprised to see him she didn’t show it.
Malfoy screamed bloody murder and started laughing hysterically, which made Harry start laughing hysterically, at least until Malfoy aimed a kick at him that sent him sprawling to the floor.
“Thanks, mate,” says Ron, and Harry realises he accidentally said that aloud. He may be a little more drunk than he’d intended.
Harry gives him a charming grin – the one that’s a carbon copy of his dad’s, according to Sirius and Remus. To his delight, Malfoy actually blushes. “Does that mean I’m allowed to ruffle your hair?”
“I like it,” Harry said, because it made him feel less alone, and reminded him of Shell Cottage. Malfoy muttered something about how of course he did.
Against all odds, McGonagall’s inter-house unity scheme, putting four different houses together like they were one, seemed to be mostly working. Harry liked almost everyone he lived with, and he found himself playing chess with Ron and the Ravenclaws, going down to Hogsmeade with the Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs to meet up with Ernie MacMillan and Hannah Abbott, helping Dean and Seamus smuggle in chocolate and Firewhiskey. McGonagall and the other teachers were so far turning a blind eye to their exploits, though Hermione still felt duty-bound to fret over it.
? Harry’s mouth opens, then closes. He chances a glance over at Malfoy, who looks flabbergasted. He manages an, “Er.”
“I had my doubts about putting you two in a room together,” McGonagall said. “You always did seem to bring out the worst in each other.” When Harry bristled, she smiled. “I don’t think that’s true anymore, or perhaps it never was true. Regardless, I must admit I expected you to show up complaining about it within the first week. I’m glad you did not. I’ve been meaning to talk to you. Do you know what day it will be in a week, Harry?”
He tried to work on his essay and kept thinking about how Malfoy would have told him every sentence was wrong. He tried to organize his trunk and found the book Malfoy had given him, pressed carefully back into the packaging after Harry had read it front to back. He tried to take a shower and kept remembering Malfoy singing in the shower, which led to thinking about Malfoy in the shower, which was not a productive train of thought. He tried to think about everything wrong with Malfoy, of which there was a lot, but being all-too aware of his faults made him seem more real, somehow.
Luna came over to sit next to them. She didn’t look surprised to see Malfoy, who turned ashen at the very sight of her.
Harry says, “This has always been real for me.” There’s more he needs to say, he thinks, but there’s time. There’s time. If Malfoy will have him, they have all the time in the world.
“Yes,” Hermione said hesitantly, “because you were paying so much attention to him that you knew something was wrong.”
Malfoy looked at him and almost smiled. “Trying clothes on is a formality, you idiot. You’re lucky I’m not making you get a tailor.” But he let Harry lead them towards the paying desk. The shop assistant, a dark-skinned girl with two braids and a piercing in her eyebrow, took in their enormous load of clothes with raised eyebrows, and then took Malfoy in with a sudden, shocked smile. To Harry’s amazement, she rushed over to them, and hugged Malfoy, and Malfoy hugged her
?” sputters Harry, but Ginny is already dancing off, and Malfoy is waiting at the door of the pub, tapping his foot and scowling. Harry trudges over reluctantly.
Malfoy’s face did something odd. He said, “You absolutely cannot dance, and I would be a rubbish teacher.”
Now Harry’s heart twists painfully at the expression on Adriana’s face. “Of course you’re welcome to stay,” he says gently. “Adriana – I’m sorry.Your family should be proud of you. You’re an excellent student, and you’re going to go places. I’m proud of you, yeah?”
and waking up from King’s Cross like it had been a dream, or the rest of his life had been a dream and that was what was real. He thought,
“Oh, honestly,” Malfoy sighed. “There’s no need to feel guilty over that, you’re hurt, you’ve got a perfectly good reason to be wandering about, idiot.”
“He asked me,” Harry said, closing the door before Malfoy could answer. He took a quick shower, and after he felt like a clean, hygienic human being, he opened the door into Malfoy’s face.
Harry blinks rapidly. Sirius and Remus’s stories about his parents are always bittersweet. Malfoy is a comforting weight near him, leaning against Harry’s shoulders.
“Cam,” says Dean, his voice coming out strangled. “I just, er, came over to say hello, Seamus and I were in the neighborhood – and I saw – er, Harry and Malfoy – ”
“Is he all right?” Hermione asks, smothering a laugh behind her hand. She’s smiling, her gaze on Ron, who’s talking about his new position to Seamus. Has Harry remembered to tell her she looks pretty tonight? He’s fairly sure.
Harry fights the urge to smile. Malfoy hates people who don’t like him, but he warms considerably to anyone who does. “Remus likes you. Sirius will get over it. As long as he thinks I’m happy.” He feels another pang of guilt.
“Draco,” Hermione said loudly, moving her chair over towards them, “have you finished the Ancient Runes homework?”
They didn’t find a compartment, because then everyone started rushing towards Harry, asking for his autograph and thanking him and wondering if he’s single and trying to touch him. Hermione cast a spell to keep them back with a furious look in her eyes and Ron said loudly, “I think he went that way!” while Luna started talking earnestly about Heliopaths so Harry could manage to slip on the Invisibility Cloak. A bit of a mistake not to have kept it on, really, but Hermione had said he was supposed to not have to hide anymore.
“Do you want to?” Harry steers them towards the register. Ron’s been promoted at the Auror office, so Hermione and Harry had decided to invite a bunch of their friends to the pub to celebrate. Malfoy doesn’t
“Er,” says Harry, with a nervous glance at Malfoy, who sits next to him and keeps nodding encouragingly at random points of time. He takes a risk – to help the illusion that he and Malfoy are in love – and slings an arm along Malfoy’s bony shoulders, pulling him closer. Malfoy smells like expensive shampoo and coffee and Narcissa’s perfume. “I love him, Mrs Malfoy,” continues Harry. It isn’t even a lie.
“Of course you do,” murmured Malfoy, which Harry thought was pretty rich of him. Not everyone wore silk pyjamas to sleep, for Merlin’s sake.
Malfoy nearly fell off the arm of Harry’s chair in surprise; Harry grabbed hold of his ankle securely before he did.
“Right.” Hermione’s look is incredulous. “Before that. Then...I don’t know, you were acting so different. Not noticeably, only, to me and Ron, it was easy to see. I’m sure Remus noticed as well. And probably Sirius too.”
Almost every single of his students is snickering at him, thinks Harry ruefully, and there’s no way they’re going to be concentrating on learning the Patronus Charm.
Harry grabs the collar of Malfoy’s coat and pulls him closer. His nose brushes against Malfoy’s. He can smell Malfoy’s expensive perfume. “If I kiss you now,” he says, “are you going to run away?”
“What would we do that for?” Malfoy says, genuinely puzzled. “I get enough of that from my mother, Potter, thanks. Have Muggle shops really not got any Acid Pops?”
Harry barely lasts until they’ve stepped inside. He pushes Malfoy against the wall, kisses him and kisses him so hard his lips feel bruised and hurt. He presses open-mouthed kisses on Malfoy’s pale neck, moves on to Malfoy’s collarbone, smothers a laugh when Malfoy shivers and tells him those are
“Asking Ginny on a date would be a really good idea, Luna,” Harry tells her, nodding enthusiastically and deciding not to ask what the Zothenberg conspiracy is. “I think she’s just a little stressed.”
Malfoy had filled up almost all of their bookshelf with more books than Harry had thought anyone but Hermione owned. He was taking N.E.W.T level Arithmancy and Ancient Runes, because he planned on being a Cursebreaker after school. He was taking History of Magic too, and he constantly recited his notes when he was writing assignments. Each night before they went to sleep, if they went upstairs at the same night, Malfoy talked at great length about how insufferable Binns was and about all his classes, so that Harry felt obligated to talk about his too.
Except – Malfoy sat next to him in Potions again. And again. And again. And Harry didn’t tell him to move, even though he only sat there to insult Harry and bitch about Slughorn. At least until Slughorn finally did take note of Malfoy, likely due to his association with Harry.
“You should probably make this quick,” Harry said as they walked out of the door in uncomfortable silence. “Malfoy’s awake and he really wanted to be here when I told him you wanted to talk to me.”
Malfoy had turned a brilliant shade of pink. “This is the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to me,” he hissed. “What have you done?”
“Well, where else are you going to find coffee-flavoured wedding cake,” puts in Ron, pausing in the middle of amiably bickering with Hermione.
family too, but Harry doesn’t want to think like that. He doesn’t know what he would have done if he’d had to go to the Dursleys’ after third year instead of Sirius.
Harry does wish Ginny were here. “That’s nice of you, to, er, ease me in,” he says, trying not to make it sound like a question. “Are you and Ginny good friends then?”
Ron slung his arm around her waist and she looked at him affectionately, giving him a kiss. Hermione was more demonstrative when she was drunk, and when Ron started kissing her back enthusiastically, Harry decided to back away.
His eyes prickled uncomfortably. He was grateful when the door opened and Parvati Patil walked out with a basket in her arms. She was wearing a red and gold negligee and looked very pretty, despite the dark circles under her eyes.
“Yeah, Anthony’s a good bloke, too. Still, don’t you wish you were sharing with me instead?” Ron said, grinning and pulling her in for a kiss.
Ron looked far from convinced. His eyes flitted from Harry to Malfoy and he stood up straighter, opened his mouth like he was about to say something, so Harry pushed him inside his room and said, “Good night.”
Harry escapes into his kitchen to make Malfoy’s sugary, sweet, disgusting coffee and his own normal tea. He ponders over the ridiculousness of even Hermione being convinced he’s engaged, and how he can possibly convince her and Ron that he’s
Maybe he was brooding a little bit. He hadn’t known his parents had died on Halloween for the longest time. The Dursleys had never seen fit to tell him. And he’d never thought about it much at Hogwarts before. Every Halloween feast, or Death Day Party, had been memorable. He’d been happy.
got them both pardoned. Said, let’s go to France, Italy, Greece, anywhere. He wouldn’t. He said he had to atone, that he didn’t want to run away anymore. When he gets his mind and heart both set on something, you see, he doesn’t give up. Well, he’d been a mess the past year.”
Hermione, Parvati, Daphne, and Justin sat at the edge of the pitch, Justin and Parvati commentating while Hermione and Daphne served as referees, though Daphne was mostly braiding Parvati’s hair.
“Well,” Luna says serenely, “I wanted to see you. I also came to ask your advice. You see, I think I’m going to ask Ginny on a date. But she’s been so distracted lately. I think she may be part of the Zothenberg conspiracy.”
She makes a grand exit. Hermione says, “It’s pub night today isn’t it? We’ll talk about this then, Harry, I’ve got a meeting in ten,” and follows suit.
And Harry soared up into the air with Malfoy just behind him, a stray breeze lifting Malfoy’s hair and the sun casting a gold light on his face.
He didn’t expect sleep to come, with Malfoy in the room, but he could hear Ron’s snores from next door and the faint sound of Neville’s from across the hallway, and it had begun to rain outside. He could hear the light patter of the rain even though the window was closed, and he felt his eyes drop.
“Sugaarrr,” Malfoy crooned from the shower, “d-du-du du du du. Ohhhh honey honey, d-du-du du du du. You are my candy girl, and you got me wanting you.”
Malfoy looks up at him, eyes glinting. “What kind of fake boyfriend would you be if you didn’t?” He cackles. Harry hates Malfoy’s laugh. Harry hates everything about Malfoy.
“You made a mistake,” Malfoy says, forcing the words out. “You and your stupid hero complex. You wanted to save me. I know you’re not – attracted to me. We’re friends. That’s good enough.”
Malfoy set his trunk on the floor and surveyed the layout of the house loftily. “Well, I am going to be living here for two weeks.”
It was a good Christmas, if weird and different than any other holidays Harry had spent with the Weasleys. He opened Malfoy’s present last; it was a book about the Potters, dating from the early sixteenth century, with glossy pictures of influential family members. Harry flipped to the end to see his father, smiling roguishly up at him with bright hazel eyes, and his mother on the next page, rolling her eyes in his father’s direction and smirking. The last page was him, a post-war picture of him accepting his Order of Merlin, First Class. Harry had been annoyed at the press for showing up then and hadn’t cared much about the award either, and you could tell. He looked unhappy and curled up in himself, shoulders slumping and eyes searching, he knew, for Ron and Hermione. He stared at it for a long time, and went back to study the rest of the pictures of his family. He didn’t know how to thank Malfoy.
Harry was not going to quit. He didn’t quit things. He was, however, seriously wishing he could consider a tactical retreat from this failed operation where all he could smell was vanilla and Malfoy was too close. The place where Malfoy’s hand touched his waist felt like it was on fire. He remembered being annoyed that Malfoy had shot up above him but he wasn’t anymore; it was something else, the way they were the right height to dance with each other, the way that Malfoy wasn’t too tall for him but he was still taller.
“She thinks we just need some time alone and we’ll get back together!” Ginny raged once Molly had left the kitchen. “And we don’t even need to clean the dishes, we can use magic, it’ll take five minutes.” She waved her wand and the soap and water began to move of their own accord, scrubbing the dishes while Ginny watched on darkly.
With Malfoy came the rest of the Slytherins, who everyone else had slowly begun to mingle with. Harry liked Daphne and Zabini well enough – or, he didn’t mind them at least – but he also honestly had no idea who they were. All he really knew about Padma was that she was Parvati’s sister, and she’d taken Ron to the Yule Ball and clearly been disdainful of every part of it. Susan he was more familiar with, but before fifth year his memories of her were hazy. As in, nonexistent.
And he didn’t know how to do this, no one had ever taught him how to do this. He only knew how to hurt Malfoy. But he wrapped his arms around Malfoy’s back and tucked his head into the crook of Malfoy’s neck. He tried to be tender the way Malfoy had been tender with him. He breathed in and out until Malfoy was breathing in and out with him, holding on so tightly it hurt.
Harry was so relieved he almost wanted to insist that Malfoy stopped walking so he could calm down. “Me neither.”
“It makes perfect sense,” Malfoy said, almost to himself as Harry ambled on beside him, only swaying once or twice. He didn’t think they’d walked side by side before very often. The only time he could think of was first year, detention in the Forbidden Forest, where Malfoy, ha, ran away screaming like a girl.
Harry went to change and brush his teeth first, and he waited for Malfoy on his bed instead of going down to find Ron and Hermione, and he wasn’t sure why. Malfoy came out of the bathroom in his school robes smelling like vanilla again so Harry gave in and asked him what it was, because he could now.
“No,” says Malfoy again, “but we should be a bit more – affectionate.” He sounds like he’s picking his words carefully.
“I’ll put the kettle on, shall I?” Sirius offers, probably so he can escape this conversation, and at Remus’s affirmation, flees into the kitchen like Harry does in uncomfortable situations.
“Wait,” Harry says. He leans forward and plants a kiss on Malfoy’s lips. Malfoy’s eyes flutter shut, and when Harry pulls away, they open again. He brings a hand up to his lips, carefully. He smiles at Harry. Malfoy’s smile is brighter than the stars at night.
Malfoy this was an awful idea. They could have set their friends and family all straight, and revealed that they were never going to date, ever,
They’d been at Grimmauld Place for a week and it looked more liveable than Harry had ever seen it, when Malfoy found a new project. They were in the bedroom Harry had tossed his things in. Harry was lying on his stomach and flipping through his Transfiguration textbook absently while Malfoy was examining the wardrobe when Malfoy said, very faintly, “Please tell me the rest of your clothes are in your trunk.”
“I’m always singing, even when everyone begs me to stop, because I know how talented and misunderstood I really am – ”
Malfoy’s face is smooth and unlined in sleep, and his hand is outstretched, like he’s waiting for Harry to hold it. So Harry does. He should wake up. But he feels so at peace. Surely, he thinks, it can wait till later.
“Easy,” Harry said aloud and the mirror remarked saucily back, “How long are you going to keep staring at yourself?”
Malfoy checked the textbook carefully and measured out a phial of powdered root of asphodel. He put it in their potion, stirred, and let it stew for the requisite ten minutes. “Mother’s in France and she has business there. I told her to stay. She wanted me to come there but – ” He hesitated. “I’d rather stay here.”
“I think he would too,” Harry said, and after that the visit to Teddy and Andromeda ran fairly smoothly, and when they were leaving, Malfoy mentioned to Andromeda, hesitantly, that maybe he would write a letter to his mother about her. This meant that Malfoy came with Harry to Teddy’s birthday party, where many Weasleys looked at him askance but said nothing for Andromeda and Teddy’s sakes. Malfoy spent most of the party hiding behind Harry’s back anyway, which didn’t work because he was taller, and Ron gave Harry a look he couldn’t decipher. Teddy was happy, though. Harry called it a success.
Harry has been subsiding from any more drinks, wanting to keep an eye on Malfoy, who is still singing terribly. He’s pleasantly buzzed right now, but not drunk. Someone needs to take care of the wanker.
“Do not say a word,” Ginny warned. “You’re the one all chummy with Draco Malfoy these days, he’s sending
In the flat, Malfoy is curled up on the couch watching a Muggle movie, his List of People I Wish I Could Murder tossed on the table in front of him.
“Doesn’t it bother you that Blaise is flirting with your girlfriend?” Malfoy asked, sidling up next to him.
. Malfoy tilts Harry’s chin up and kisses him like he’s trying to say a million things at once – I love you, I hate you, please don’t leave. Harry gasps out,
at least,” and Harry told them both to fuck off, he’d last the whole year. They went down to breakfast still laughing. They joined Ginny, and though it was a bit awkward with her and Harry, when they told her about Malfoy she threw her head back and laughed and laughed and laughed. Harry had always loved to watch Ginny laugh, the pale and freckled column of her throat, but he did not think they were going to get back together now or ever.
want to leave. But it was Hogwarts, and he missed Ron and Hermione and Ginny and Luna, the rest of the Gryffindors and all the eighth years, McGonagall and Hagrid, the view of the grounds from his and Malfoy’s window. They’d said nothing had to change.
“No, it’s – ” Ginny sighed. “I think that would make it worse. Maybe I’ll bring Zabini over here, that would make her stop.”
“I’ll just meet you in there, shall I,” said Anthony Goldstein uncomfortably, and he opened his and Ron’s door, slipping inside.
“You’re right,” Dean says. “Thanks.” He starts to walk past Harry, and then halts abruptly. “I feel like this is the time to tell you something.”
“You brought it up,” Harry reminds him, but he doesn’t mind changing the subject. There isn’t anything he doesn’t want to talk to Malfoy about.
“This is one of the oldest wizarding homes in Britain!” Malfoy said. “Your poor house elf isn’t going to be able to do everything, you know.”
Harry had rather got the impression that Zabini wouldn’t go for Ginny because of her family, but Ginny could take care of herself, and he doubted she’d dance with Zabini.
The next day, Malfoy sat next to Harry in Potions, sneering at Ron and Hermione, who shot him looks of deep dislike and looked to Harry with bewilderment. Harry was too busy gaping to argue, or say anything, really.
They’ve reached Harry’s rendezvous now. Harry can smell Ginny’s flowery perfume, and feel her chin resting against his shoulder. “I’ll get your autograph.”
“Have we figured out our relationship?” asks Harry, once they’ve calmed down. “I mean. You haven’t changed your mind, have you?”
Lavender Brown was not coming back, he knew. She was still spending most of her time in the hospital, the rest dealing with being a werewolf, and this was the place she had been bitten.
Malfoy says something about the coffee. Remus says something about the weather. Sirius says something about how if Malfoy hurts Harry, he’ll break Malfoy’s face in ten different ways. Remus says something about how that sentiment is shared.
He can’t let last night be forgotten and ignored the way their first kiss was ignored. “I also have leather pants,” Harry says suddenly, and immediately wants to slink into the ground and disappear.
They’ve both settled on a summer wedding, on a day no one else will know the significance of, but that is the date of their first ever kiss.
“Before sixth year, obviously,” Malfoy said. “Blaise mostly tried it on with everyone, and we were in the same dormitory, or – well, it wasn’t like this.”
“I’ll tell you tomorrow,” Harry said, over and over again in response to Ron and Hermione’s questions, “it’s nothing. Really.”
Neville squints at him. “Really? Well, either you or Malfoy better hurry up and propose. Our betting pool is getting cold by now.”
Harry makes coffee. He tries to tame his hair, then thinks maybe Malfoy would like it better if he didn’t, so he gives up. He realises he’s not wearing a shirt and Hermione hadn’t mentioned because there had been an emergency, or because she was used to it. He puts on a shirt Malfoy bought him, one that’s green like his eyes or like Slytherin house colours. He is looking through the List and wondering if Malfoy wanted to put
The Burrow was always loud. But there was something, someone, missing and they were all trying too hard to make up for it.
“Oh, fuck you, Potter,” Malfoy snapped, and then he pinched his eyebrows together and let out a long sigh. “So,” said Malfoy now, quieter. “So what? You want to stay up all night and braid each other’s hair? You want to be –
“Merlin, Potter, didn’t I just tell you I didn’t want to talk about it?” Pansy sighs. She tells Harry anyway. “Padma left. She’s angry with me.”
“Harryyy,” Ginny said, “why are you in this corner aloneeee? Oh, hey, Malfoy.” She squinted at him for a second. “Huh. I didn’t think Ron was telling the truth about this. Nice glasses.”
Malfoy’s hair was rumpled and his clothes were disheveled and he had pillow creases on his face. It was obviously not adorable, because it was Malfoy, but if it wasn’t. Well.
“It’s okay,” Harry said, choosing to address one part of Malfoy’s speech instead of all the rest. Malfoy was very talkative when he woke up. Really, all the time. But he was gentler, if Harry could even use that word with Malfoy, in the morning. Softer.
“I’m not going to,” Harry said, watching him in the firelight, pale hair and pale face and flushed cheeks.
Harry’s glasses immediately started clouding up in the warm atmosphere of The Three Broomsticks. Malfoy took them off and murmured a spell before handing them back to Harry, clearer than they’d been in probably a year, and continuing dragging Harry towards a secluded booth in the corner.
“Ah,” Hermione says, and sits down on the couch. Probably she’s sitting on top of the List. Harry doesn’t have time to worry about that.
It wasn’t the first time Harry had kissed a boy. He and Ginny had gone to a Muggle rave last summer, after they had broken up but were still trying to prove they could be friends, and Seamus had gone with them. Ginny attracted a small crowd of people who fell in love with her, and Harry and Seamus were left alone: he remembered the crowds of sweaty people around them, steadily drinking while they both laughed at Ginny’s paramours, bright lights flashing over Seamus’s face, the neon pink paint Ginny had brushed over Harry’s collarbone. It wasn’t like Harry had ever thought about it – guys – much. But they kept getting pushed together in the crowd, and when Ginny had gone home with a girl with a tongue piercing, Harry took Seamus back to Grimmauld Place. Ginny had cackled at them both.
“Why did you.” Harry stumbles over his words. He casts a glance at the sky above, clear and white, snow falling into his eyes. “Why did you leave,” he says finally. “When I kissed you, the first time, why did you leave?”
But Pansy gives a big, dramatic gasp – Harry suspects all Slytherins are inherently dramatic – and says, “Draco, you gave him your mother’s ring?”
“I’m not freaking out!” Malfoy said hysterically. “I didn’t know you – you! And Ginevra Weasley and –
“You can’t manage a proper smirk,” Malfoy explains. “You always look like a twitchy rabbit. It’s funny, really.”
“To go with my motorcycle,” Harry explains, deciding to follow the advice of the Ginny in his head and go with the flow. “Or, Sirius’s motorcycle, technically, but he gave it to me.”
“I mean, all spells have got a Latin origin,” Hermione said. “It’s frankly irresponsible not to learn Latin
So he had two problems: a sort-of attraction to Malfoy, and meddling friends who kept questioning his reasons for living with Malfoy.
sometimes. It’s an Indian sweet. Not as good as my mother’s, but.” She shrugged. “Do you want some?”
Harry felt it was past time to extricate himself from their position. He moved away, sitting up even though his body ached in protest, and stretched a bit before turning back to Malfoy, who had sat up.
The room was comfortably big, high ceilings and white walls, a pale blue carpet under his feet over wooden floorboards. There were two beds against either wall, an empty bookshelf in between them, a long and wide settee under a window that looked out to the comforting sight below of the grounds, and a door on the right that Harry assumed led to a bathroom.
, Harry thought, over and over again while Flitwick was talking. Malfoy was writing notes, but his foot kept coming up against Harry’s under the table and even if Harry had been trying to concentrate, he wouldn’t have been able to.
expression. “And you both talked about why? And had a mature conversation, and he told you that he wasn’t interested in you?”
be sorry,” Harry bursts out. “You never would have said any of that to my face sober and you needed to!”
Sirius hadn’t wanted anything to do with Number 12 Grimmauld Place. He’d given it to Harry, and Harry hadn’t wanted it either – but Kreacher was better nowadays, and he’d felt guilty about leaving the house so empty. The solution had fallen into his lap easily – a second year had confessed to him that he was scared of going back home, where his mother would insult him and his father would drink all day.
Harry opened the door to his room just as someone on the other side opened it, and the door slammed right in the face, as well as hitting the person on the other side in their head, sending Harry stumbling back on the floor with a hand clutched to his head.
, both of them had horrible morning breath and sleep in their eyes, but Harry kissed him back and was ridiculously, incredibly happy.
But when Harry arrives, Pansy is sitting on the steps leading up to the doors, holding an old-fashioned handkerchief that has the initials
“Mhm?” Harry says blurrily, forcing his eyes open. Malfoy’s hand had been outstretched for Harry’s, before. Now he can see that in his sleep, when Malfoy had left, Harry’s own hand is extended, waiting for Malfoy.
“I am never drinking again,” Malfoy proclaimed. “Oh my God. Why did I do that. Oh my God. You kissed Dean Thomas. Oh my God.”
“Gladly,” Hermione said. “But Harry – this, I was not prepared for. When we saw you that first day – I mean, you fell asleep with Malfoy, and you haven’t been able to sleep since – ”
They’d been back at Hogwarts for a few days when Malfoy burst into the room during their free period, grabbed Harry’s arm, and started pulling him away from his Transfiguration homework.
“I’m climbing into the trolley,” Malfoy warns him, before proceeding to do exactly that. Harry pushes him around amiably, settling down from the confusion of Malfoy’s behaviour earlier. He grabs some hot cocoa, since they’re running out, and Malfoy’s favourite biscuits. He has a vague, guilty voice in the back of his mind – one that sounds suspiciously like Hermione or Remus – that tells him to get more healthy food.
Harry took two and they sat in comfortable silence for a few moments before Parvati yawned and went upstairs. He stared at the last sweet in his hand after she’d gone upstairs. He wondered if his father’s family had been Indian. He didn’t know. He didn’t know what he was.
“You haven’t sucked my dick yet,” Malfoy says, eyes soft and hands tugging at Harry’s just-been-shagged-hair and eyebrows drawn together.
The drinks had been set in Neville and Justin’s room sometime after everyone emptied the first few cartons, probably by Hermione. Harry swung by to grab a bottle of Firewhiskey; he could hear the music from up here. He felt unsteady, and he didn’t think it was just because of the drinks.
But right now, it was easy enough to play with her and laugh when Seamus lost spectacularly, and share Chocolate Frogs with Ron like they were eleven years old again.
When Rafael makes his apologies and leaves with one last flash of a smile like the sun, Harry turns on Malfoy, who is still sulking. “What is your problem?” Harry asks.
He was practically jumping up and down with excitement when he found Harry finishing up an Owl to Ron and Hermione in the drawing room.
Harry half-expected Malfoy to bypass Harry, go straight to the bathroom to complete his vanilla-smelling night routine, and go to bed. He thought about that, the scent of vanilla that followed Malfoy every night they went to sleep. Was it perfume that Malfoy used? A spell? Harry couldn’t figure it out. He was so busy thinking about Malfoy’s perfume that he didn’t notice when Malfoy sat down until he felt the warmth of Malfoy settling next to him, and heard his careful breathing.
Draco Malfoy. I think the world revolves entirely around me. I’ve never won a Quidditch game against my bitter rival, Harry Potter, who is a total twerp and terrible at everything, but everyone
“It’s true,” Blaise said. “I admit, I saw it as fate, or destiny, that Dean Thomas and I were to share a room. However, he clearly held affection for another.”
each other, all I do is insult you, and I am – don’t you understand what I’m like? I’m irritating and I talk too much and I’m not
“To make sure everyone knows we’re in a relationship,” Malfoy explains calmly. “Our friends were idiotic to believe it when we weren’t even pretending, so it should be easy.”
“No, really.” Pansy turns to face him. “If you fuck this up, I’ll cut off your dick and chop it into a million pieces. So. Don’t fuck this up.”
doing well for yourself, aren’t you, Queenie?” Pansy said, smirking. “Sharing a room with a Gryffindor.”
He kissed Dean back, the desk digging into his back and the music ringing in his ears, curling his hand around the back of Dean’s neck. He thought, ridiculously, of Malfoy’s mouth, his throat when he swallowed or laughed, and kissed Dean harder like he needed to make up for that moment of mistaken notion, because he
“I don’t know,” Harry said again. “I mean – ” He was, of course, what else could he do? “I might not,” he finished lamely.
“Another Slytherin lost to a Gryffindor,” mourned Malfoy, still looking at Blaise and Ginny with a small smile playing on his lips. “Pansy’ll murder him.”
. Harry kisses back easily, one hand moving to caress Malfoy’s neck. He spends a very enjoyable ten minutes kissing Malfoy. And in those ten minutes, he knows that he could do this for the rest of his life. And Malfoy wants him to.
“But mate. The stalking? The constantly worrying about why Malfoy looked sick, and why he wasn’t talking to you or bothering you, and why he wasn’t doing his work or Quidditch – ”
“Snookums,” he greets. “You’re a dear. Are those roses?” Harry bats his eyelashes, placing his hands under his chin. “For
He looked at Malfoy’s bent head as he hummed something and consulted a textbook and drank copious, probably unhealthy amounts of coffee.
They hadn’t talked about this yet. There was a lot to not talk about. They’d talked about the war, even though Harry didn’t usually talk about the war with anyone: Snape and Dumbledore cautiously, treading careful ground. But mostly they talked about things like the Snatchers they’d been most terrified of, Malfoy’s mother curling her hand tightly around his shoulder when Fenrir Greyback came, the cliffs at Shell Cottage and Dobby’s body in a grave, Nagini in Malfoy’s house, the hunger and loneliness, watching the snow fall on Harry’s parents’ graves.
He hadn’t really decided to move in with Malfoy. He had, instead, fallen into a habit of staying in Malfoy’s second guest room instead of staying in his room at Hogwarts, because Malfoy was so close, was always within reach. Ron said he was ridiculous. Harry agreed, albeit privately. He had gotten used to seeing Malfoy in the morning light, soft and rumpled, and eventually had suggested staying with him permanently.
Malfoy also had to move Harry’s elbow out of his oatmeal and stop him from putting salt in his pumpkin juice several times, except he didn’t stop Harry from putting salt in his pumpkin juice. He let him do it and then laughed for a solid ten minutes, before switching Harry’s pumpkin juice out with his own.
“Just take it back,” Malfoy said, words stumbling out of him in a rush. “Take it back, and it’ll be alright. You didn’t mean it.”
He was absolutely positive Malfoy wouldn’t dare step outside their room without first fixing his hair and putting on his magic face wash, and sure enough, Malfoy didn’t follow him immediately out the door. Harry could picture him seething and plotting Harry’s demise in the bathroom. He went downstairs smiling.
“Harry!” Ron said loudly when he came over. “We haven’t seen you in so long. You’ve been with – ” Here he let out an enormous giggle. “Malfoy, ha.”
“I did,” Malfoy grumbled, “my hormones betrayed me and it’s – oh, whatever, you’re a bastard, Potter.”
“Yes,” Malfoy said, looking distraught, “and I asked Susan, because everyone knows you go to Hufflepuffs to help you find things and she couldn’t find it there, and then Padma rudely stole her away from me.”
At least he caught the Snitch, his and Malfoy’s fingertips grazing before he pulled up into the air with Ron whooping triumphantly.
Harry hadn’t known much about it at all. The Dursleys hadn’t exactly been the type to tell him about things like that. “Wizards have a Potion for that?”
“I couldn’t sleep,” Harry blurted out, conscious of the fact that he wasn’t wearing a shirt. “Sorry.”
It was like a punch to the gut. Harry stared at the door. He thought there was a buzzing in his ears. He did not dare look in Malfoy’s direction.
Kreacher did keep sobbing whenever he saw Malfoy, but he cleaned up the rooms until they were sparkling, and handed them plates of sandwiches and glasses of water while they cast cleaning spells on the rooms.
than you,” Malfoy said, offended, but he still wasn’t looking at Harry. They stood for a moment, far apart from each other in silence. Harry did not know what had happened. He didn’t know what to do. He only knew what he wanted to do, which was to rush over and rest his head in the crook of Malfoy’s neck.
Ginny doesn’t even turn to look at him, but Malfoy startles, turning around to look at Harry. “How was Pansy?” he asks, eyes darting between Ginny and Harry. Harry wonders if Ginny has been frightening him the way Pansy scared Harry. It wouldn’t surprise him.
After that, talking to the Slytherins was fairly easy, except for with Pansy, who still seemed baffled that he was here at all. Well, until Malfoy went up to get more drinks, and Goyle looked at Pansy, who nodded once, and stood up to help before Harry could. Malfoy looked at Harry with a slightly panicked look that Harry returned without the slightly, but Goyle was already dragging him away.
Teddy ran out immediately to jump into Harry’s arms, and Harry laughed, catching him and swinging him around before setting him down. Andromeda had been smiling until she saw Malfoy, and then she looked like she had seen a ghost.
“Oh. I think McGonagall.” He didn’t know how to say this. “You know, figured it out. What we were doing.”
In the morning, Ron and Hermione stayed by his side and Malfoy sang Muggle Halloween songs while insulting his hair and Ginny hexed anyone that asked him probing, personal questions about his parents. He thought about slipping away after dinner to visit their graves, but in the end he just looked through the photo book Hagrid had given him and hoped that wherever they were, they were happy, and that they would have wanted him to be happy too.
Owls from Ron, Hermione, Pansy, Blaise, and Daphne kept flying in when they had dinner. Sometimes they got into screaming rows over whose turn it had been to clean up or who’d knocked over one of the house elves’ shrunken heads, arguments that turned bafflingly into every other thing they’d used to fight over – Hagrid, Slytherins, Quidditch. It was easier to fight with none of the other eighth years around, but it meant they made up quicker, too.
“Well, how am I supposed to understand?” Harry snapped. “I don’t know what you’re on about – I’m sorry, I can’t change the way I feel, and I don’t want to, but you’re my friend first and if – if that’s what you still want, then I’ll – ”
, it won’t work because after Blaise and Daphne kept Silencing it I cast another spell on so no one could – ”
That night, they didn’t sleep on the settee, but Malfoy talked as he got into bed, and Harry fell asleep with the comforting sound of his voice still ringing in his ears. Malfoy was fascinating, he always had been, even when he’d been fascinatingly horrible. Harry fell asleep now trying to figure him out the way he had fallen asleep trying to figure out every new problem the world had thrown at him: prickly, pointy, perplexing Malfoy. It was something to concentrate on, without any of the fear and anxiety that any of the other things he’d needed to concentrate on involved.
Malfoy gave him a scornful look. Then he looked away quickly. He said, “You’ve never cared about getting in trouble, and no one
Harry wasn’t sure what Malfoy was talking about. He leaned in to poke Zabini’s leg, tentatively, and then shoved his shoulder to no response. He turned to Malfoy, who had kicked off his shoes and was pulling off his socks while singing under his breath, “From the marshy bogs of Queerditch…” Here he paused to laugh maniacally for some reason before continuing, “Grew a sport so fine and fair, in which each witch and wizard would...something...through the aiirr,” and falling into bed.
They went down to lunch together and ate a hearty helping of everything, since they’d missed breakfast and were both starving. Malfoy tried to steer Harry towards the Slytherin table, and Harry tried to move towards the Gryffindor table, and eventually they sat at the Ravenclaw table, by Terry Boot and Anthony Goldstein, who looked absolutely bewildered. Zabini, muttering darkly about Pansy Parkinson for some reason, sat down next to them and spent the whole time flirting scandalously with Terry Boot, which. Harry had not expected. He hadn’t known Zabini, of all people – well. Terry seemed half-interested and half-alarmed, anyway.
It was as though Grimmauld Place had been waiting for Malfoy; everything seemed brighter and more alive. The gas lamps lit up by themselves and the chandelier sparkled despite the fine layer of dust hanging over it, the house made anew by Malfoy’s obvious happiness to be here. Still, none of that could hide the disrepair Grimmauld Place had fallen into.
Harry had never wanted to be friends with Malfoy. He thought of all the reasons why, all the horrible things that Malfoy had done, the way he had got under Harry’s skin. Malfoy had sharp edges. He could be unpleasant and cruel and awful. So could Harry.
“This is much worse than I thought,” said Pansy Parkinson. She turned to Blaise and Daphne accusingly. “You have let the situation get completely out of control.”
“You have snow in your eyelashes and you forgot your glasses,” Malfoy says, like he can’t help himself.
Ginny had said it easily, like it would make sense: “Are you in love with Malfoy?” He thought about Ron saying,
, for this and for putting him in a room with Malfoy in the first place, but he could not quite find the words.
“I can’t believe you haven’t been!” Hermione said. “Or that you’re still calling him by his last name.”
, and they are an abomination that should be set on fire.” He let the clothes in his hand fall to the floor dramatically. “I have not noticed this for so long because you are always either wearing your school robes, Weasley jumpers, Quidditch shirts, pyjamas, or the same two pairs of jeans over and over again. Potter, I know you have money, and even if you didn’t, people would
Most of all, he sang the Dirty Dancing soundtrack: day and night, sometimes just softly when they were going to sleep, so that to Harry’s irritation he got used to it. Harry had never seen nor heard of Dirty Dancing in his life and yet he now had the soundtrack memorized, and had to put up with Malfoy constantly saying, “Nobody puts Baby in a corner!” every time Harry complained that he’d left his robes on the floor. Harry also left his robes on the floor. They were both slobs.
Ron seemed at once aghast and like he was trying incredibly hard not to laugh. “Sorry, mate,” he said, clapping a hand to Harry’s shoulder commiseratingly. Harry waited for Malfoy to icily protest that he was
you to. You idiot. Fine, I’m not going to try to convince you not to, I knew telling you something was a bad idea would just make you want to do it. Just
“Look,” Malfoy said, very fast, as they maneuvered around crowds of people, “I know you don’t like them, and honestly most of them hate you, but only Theo and Goyle were ever really involved with the Death Eaters, and they served their time in Azkaban after the Dementors were removed, so – and Pansy, I know what she said, and I’m sorry about that, but she probably isn’t – and you’ll probably like Millie the best – we should go back – oh, God, we’re here.”
They went back to Hogwarts together; Ron and Hermione threw themselves at him, and gave Malfoy a tiny spasm that looked like a nod. Blaise greeted them both impassionately, and Daphne immediately dragged Malfoy away to play with his hair.
Then Kreacher showed up with a crack and immediately burst into tears at the sight of Malfoy and said, “Master Draco is returning to his rightful home!”
Ginny laughed and said, “Come on, Harry.” She let go of Luna to drag Harry up from the floor. Harry submitted good-naturedly, and when Malfoy didn’t stand up, he looked back and raised his eyebrows until Malfoy was following them and Luna.
“Er,” Harry said, coming to a halt. He looked around. They’d been going in the opposite direction from the Great Hall, presumably because Zabini wanted to chase Malfoy off for some excessively abysmal reason.
“Okay.” Harry exhales, and rings the bell. Remus, to his relief, is the one who answers, smiling slightly, his sleeves rolled up.
Sirius enters the sitting room and sets down the coffee and tea. He glances cagily at the door, but sits down next to Remus.
“No telling anyone that we aren’t actually dating,” recites Malfoy, “unless Granger figures it out and asks us. No – fornicating, with other people while we’re pretending to date – ”
“That wasn’t. I mean. Look, I know Malfoy’s – ” Harry waved a hand in a vague gesture that could mean ‘evil’ or ‘insane’. “But I’m not stalking him. We’re just roommates. I don’t see the problem.”
“See you later, Potter,” Malfoy said crisply, standing up in one smooth motion, inclining his head at Ron and Hermione.
,” says Harry loudly, and in that moment, he meets Malfoy’s eyes and he knows what they’re both thinking of – that windswept afternoon, Malfoy’s lips, chapped from cold, on his own, and the sounds that they’d both made, desperate and pleased. Malfoy swallows. Harry can’t look away from him. This isn’t supposed to be happening – they’d put that
and Side-Along’s Harry and Hermione both to Hogsmeade. Apparition makes Harry feel sick even when he’s sober, so he’s faintly impressed that he hasn’t thrown up.
had forgiven Malfoy – or, well, he probably had, but he hadn’t thought much about it. “I get it,” he said.
Malfoy took so long inside that Harry began to wonder if he had been eaten by the Slytherins, but at that point he came back out. He looked both fairly harassed and faintly pleased, with his hair ruffled, but he grabbed Harry by his elbow and steered him inside, still muttering about how it was impossible! Impossible that Harry could ever have been in Slytherin. Impossible!
“You can talk!” Malfoy said, as though this was an incredible accomplishment. “That means you can tell Madam Pomfrey I didn’t mean to maim you!”
They were in Harry’s bed; he remembered picking themselves up and stumbling into Harry’s bedroom in-between kisses. Harry looked cautiously around and saw a trail of their clothes leading away from the door. He thought of Kreacher and shuddered, hoped that he’d made himself scarce.
“Yes, exactly, cinnamon,” said Malfoy, and then, dreamily, “I watched the best Muggle film in all existence on the fellytone, though.”
“Have you been paying any attention at all? That’s what I’ve been trying to do for the past seven years, isn’t it?” Malfoy sounded – not bitter. Brittle. Something like that. Hermione would know the right word.
“Brain-damaged,” Malfoy said eventually in a sing-song voice, and kept up a steady stream of chatter as he steered them towards the Hospital Wing. Madam Pomfrey was closing up her office when Malfoy triumphantly dragged them in front of her.
In love with Malfoy, he thought at night, throwing his blankets aside and looking over at where Ron was snoring, hand curled around the letter Hermione had sent this morning.
“Not smiley?” Harry examines the back of a pint of strawberry ice cream and thinks that he’s pretty sporty himself. And he’s not too shabby-looking either.
Blaise opened his mouth to start on the speech that the Ravenclaws and Hermione had helped him write, and stammered out a few sentences before Ginny had stood up, swung her arms around his neck, and kissed him. Blaise stood still for a moment before he started kissing her back passionately.
you, you should look at your hair situation before you throw around unfounded accusations, you horrible excuse for a – ”
“Of course that’s Blaise,” Malfoy said, and then, faintly, “and all of our year, as well as Luna and Ginevra, apparently.”
Hogsmeade is practically deserted, not a soul in sight. Harry can see why as snow begins to fall gently around them, settling into Malfoy’s hair.
“Did you make a vow about that?” Harry laughed into his pillow. “I thought of you by your first name lots of times last year. Draco.”
They were walking back from Defence Against the Dark Arts, the day before Valentine’s Day, snow falling outside, on the day Harry figured it out.
“Oh my God, you did,” Harry said, delighted. “You had a crush on me in fifth year. I thought you hated me.”
Malfoy’s eyes were fixed on something other than Harry. “Yes, I just sit here. I go over every single one of my idiotic mistakes, and think about everything I should have done differently, and how and why I’ve ended up in a situation where Harry Potter is sitting in my kitchen without a shirt on in the middle of the night.”
He was thinking about it during the Christmas party Blaise and Parvati and Seamus had insisted on throwing the day before everyone was set to leave, bright Christmas lights hung on the walls. He was thinking about Malfoy’s face split in an honest smile, how he wasn’t sure if he’d be able to sleep without Malfoy in the same room as him, now.
Harry tried to catch Malfoy’s foot and tickle it, and Malfoy screeched and pushed him away, nearly toppling over the chair in the process. The rest of the common room was watching them, but they seemed almost as resigned as Hermione had been.
“Sixth year is close enough,” Harry says. There is a warm glow in his heart at the thought that Malfoy has liked him since fifth year. “Hermione knows we were faking, by the way.”
“I’m going home, of course,” Anthony was saying, watching Ron and Justin play chess against Neville and Seamus absently. “I don’t celebrate Christmas, though.” Here there was a general chorus of, “Me neither,” from a few others. “There’s Hanukkah, of course,” went on Anthony. “Mostly my parents want me home.”
They hadn’t gotten back together at all. They’d fallen apart instead. Ginny had said, close to tears, that he didn’t talk to her, that she didn’t think they even knew each other at all, and Harry couldn’t say she was wrong. Because he loved Ginny, but he had held on to her like a prize he could win back, and he had wanted her because it meant he would have a real family. And – he said this only once, because he knew how furious she would get – she had always wanted a hero, The Boy Who Lived, the boy who tore her nightmares to shreds with a sword in The Chamber of Secrets. That had been their worst row, violent enough that Ron and Hermione had to pull them apart. They made up soon enough and agreed to break up for good – sometimes things were just a bit tense.
“You’re quite attractive, you know,” Malfoy tells him conversationally, burrowing in deeper in his comforter.
“Things that are true?” Harry doesn’t want to move. He wants to rest his forehead against Malfoy’s, and feel him, close enough to kiss. He
Malfoy had to talk to Dumbledore, but Harry didn’t know what Dumbledore had told Malfoy to do, what Dumbledore was going to do to protect Malfoy and Malfoy’s family. He’d accomplished his task, he’d set Malfoy on the course for good. Or as close as Malfoy could get to good. It was done. There was no need to think about Malfoy, or wonder if he was scared.
He was a little drunk, though he hadn’t had that much – not interested in losing control in front of everyone here. He hadn’t been raised sipping wine, though, the way most purebloods seemed to have been, and he was possibly more drunk than he had intended.
“Pansy’s company is a delight,” replies Malfoy, even though he has vehemently disagreed on this in the past, “but you have a point.”
Harry had got what he wanted, but he had made things ten times worse than they already were. Maybe a little distance from Malfoy could have helped. But maybe the fact that he didn’t want any distance from Malfoy was the reason no one could help him at all.
not,” says Malfoy. “I’m not exactly looking forward to hearing her talk about how badly she wants grandchildren, are you? Knowing my mother, she’ll think it’s a given that I’ll marry you, and use a surrogate to carry on the Malfoy name. She’s probably already got someone picked out.”
Harry said goodbye (Goyle and Theo nodded at him and Millie smiled. Pansy hissed into his ear never to hurt Malfoy and gave him her address), and headed over to Hermione, who was waiting for Ron to come back with their drinks.
“Someone from The Daily Prophet who insulted Harry or something,” Ron says dismissively. “He had a black eye for weeks, I bet.”
And he started running, throwing himself into Harry’s arms, and Harry caught him easily. They were both laughing louder than the rain. Harry tried to lift him up and failed miserably, so that they almost slipped and died like Malfoy had said they would. Malfoy laughed louder and wrapped his legs around Harry so that he would not fall into the grass.
“Good luck,” Harry says weakly, watching Luna shrug on her neon green coat and walk out of the flat.
Harry flinched but Zabini didn’t. He kept going. “Theo’s family was too affiliated with the Death Eaters. Millie’s been travelling. Daphne was going back, but you see how fickle she is, completely absorbed with her Gryffindor.”
Though weddings have proven to be more complicated than Harry originally thought. There are all sorts of pureblood customs, and wizarding traditions, and bonding ceremonies. One thing he didn’t have to worry about was his best men – Ron and Hermione were both up to the task (Hermione refused to prescribe to gender roles), and Ginny, Luna, and Neville were delighted to be his groomsmen (Ginny and Luna also refused to prescribe to gender roles). Malfoy hadn’t needed to worry, either. Pansy, Blaise and Goyle didn’t even wait for him to ask.
“Oh, hey,” Harry protested, “I’m not – I’m not trying to hurt him.” Zabini looked at him coolly, but Harry had gotten some version of this talk by four different Weasley brothers and he was not the type to back down. “Did you really want to talk to me because you thought I was, what, dangerous?”
“Okay,” Malfoy says, voice hoarse. His eyes are grey, grey, grey. They remind Harry of the moon watching over him at night. “No kissing.”
What followed was a complicated conversation about question 3b that Harry could not hope to follow at all, but apparently Terry and Hermione had disagreed on the answer. Hermione’s questions to Malfoy were stilted and stiff, and Malfoy was jumpy and careful, but otherwise things seemed to be going well. When they segued into a conversation about Latin, Harry started to get bored and cheered on Ron and Justin in their game of chess, his hand still on Malfoy’s ankle.
“You never talked about it again!” Malfoy says. “There was the war, and then you left, and I know you needed to, but when you came back you never talked about it!”
Ginny, a bit farther along the Gryffindor table with a group of her friends and Luna next to her, was looking with some bemusement at the white doves that had landed in front of her with a barreload of her favourite chocolates, a bouquet of roses, a Quidditch broom grooming set, and a necklace in a velvet box that she had taken out to look at. Harry had
,” Malfoy demanded, poking him in the shoulder. He looked serious all of a sudden. “The things I did. Don’t you care?”
“Thanks,” mumbles Harry, feeling even worse about lying. “Y’know, everyone else already thought we’d been. Together. The whole time.”
He looked out at the sky, thought about Malfoy disarming Dumbledore on this tower and Malfoy laughing into his collarbone in his bed.
As soon as he met Harry’s eyes he flinched like he wanted to look away but he stood firm. The first thing Draco Malfoy said to Harry in a year was a polite, “Would you like to use the bathroom first?”
“I did mean it,” Harry said, wretched. “I’ve never felt this way before. And I swear, it’s the truth. And I owe it all to you. And. I’m singing the Dirty Dancing soundtrack, aren’t I.”
Malfoy’s eyes flash. In that second he reminds Harry strangely of Ginny in a temper, Cedric arguing over who should take the Cup, Cho furious with him, Parvati Patil with her chin up because he’d insulted her ages ago. It’s possible Harry has a type. “So
Malfoy touched his hair lightly, brushing snow off, and took hold of the crook of his elbow. “Didn’t you wear a hat?”
, and maybe he was close, almost there, to figuring it out: like he was at the edge of a cliff and he was ready to jump, but someone had pulled him back by his sleeve before he had the chance. Malfoy sneezed, and he’d forgotten what he’d been thinking about at all.
!” Malfoy said, and then, in a consoling voice, “It’s alright, Potter. I know you’ve got a saviour complex the size of the Quidditch pitch and your life is incomplete without feeling like you are benevolently helping the poor mortals whose company you’re forced to deal with. Madam Pomfrey will sort us both out.”
“It’s a risk you should take,” Harry replies, thinking of Hermione’s advice and snowflakes falling amidst Harry and Malfoy. “Your relationship can survive him saying no. You love each other.”
fine, because if it was fine then Malfoy would have thrown a fit and been all dramatic and talked about how alone he would be. It was the thought of Malfoy sitting in the common room alone that made Harry blurt out, “You can go with me.”
with him. But some part of Harry – the part that remembers Pansy talking about Malfoy being in love with him, the part that thinks about Malfoy’s behaviour yesterday – wants to hope.
“Why do you smell like rosewater?” Harry sniffs suspiciously. “Are you following Sirius’s skin care routine?”
Harry suffered through an awkward meeting with Narcissa, and now it’s Malfoy’s turn, so he ignores Malfoy’s grumbling and sets off for Sirius and Remus’s place.
Malfoy started pouring terrible amounts of syrup on his pancakes. “Don’t really know how that conversation would work. Hi, Aunt Andromeda, my mother refuses to speak of you, I think she moved to France so that she never has to confront you, and my other aunt murdered your favourite cousin and I was on the side you left, the side that incidentally killed your daughter and husband, do you mind if I come over for a cup of tea? I never knew she even existed for most of my life. I’ve never even met her!”
“I’d rather stay, too,” Parvati agreed, looking at Daphne Greengrass, who was writing an essay and checking it against
Zabini laughed breezily and then in the next moment seemed to become steely-eyed and serious, stopping and turning to Harry with his arms crossed. “No. I came here for Draco.”
He couldn’t sleep anyway. He lied awake all night, thinking about the curve of Malfoy’s mouth when he smiled, unexpected because he was always sneering or smirking. He couldn’t decide if it was better or worse that Malfoy wasn’t awake too.
Malfoy moves forward, standing in front of Harry. Harry licks his lips. He remembers last night again, and feels all of a sudden too-warm. His attention is caught on little things, like Malfoy’s top buttons being undone, exposing a sliver of collarbone that isn’t
Roses are his favourite flower, actually, but Malfoy probably just picked them because they’re classic flowers that symbolise love, so Harry pushes away any warm feelings in his chest.
After that, classes fell in their predictable rhythm. Everyone was so busy frantically studying for exams in a month and a half, and trying to keep up with their workload, that no one seemed to notice when Malfoy and Harry sat in the same chair, when they held hands on the way to class or played with each other’s hair (whatever Malfoy had said, Harry had a sneaking suspicion he liked Harry’s hair the way it was). Both of them were hardly in their room most of the time, and they didn’t have much time for anything more than kissing.
And started ranting about how if Harry could have waited just one more week, Malfoy would have proposed to him in a
Harry gives her a quick kiss on the cheek, and then goes to offer Ron his congratulations again. Ron gives him a big hug in response. He’s almost as drunk as Malfoy.
“Four?” offers Harry, because he’s always wanted a big family, the kind Ron and Ginny have and the kind he never got.
Blaise did not seem fazed by this. “I do like her,” he said, and smiled strikingly. “I’d rather not hurt her if I can manage it.”
“Sixth year, and all the years before,” Hermione said, with a glance at Ron. “We’d been ready for the possibility that your Malfoy obsession would come back, this year. I even thought it would be a good thing! Help you feel a little more like yourself, you know.”
It feels freeing, finally asking the question Harry has been wondering since he was sixteen and so in love and he hadn’t known it yet.
Harry shrugged again. “I don’t know. It didn’t seem like a big deal. Most of those clothes are Dudley’s. Er, my cousin. Those were the ones my aunt and uncle gave me as a kid.”
“It’s a good idea,” Malfoy says defensively, “it’ll get my parents off my back. When Valentine’s Day comes around, I’ll tell them you dumped me and broke my heart, and they’ll leave me alone for a bit. A couple of months of peace, and maybe I can finally finish my articles.”
“Are you aware that Mr. Filch has been searching the entire castle for the source of this music?” McGonagall asked finally. “Exams are a month and a half away, and our students need to be focused and concentrated in class. My sixth-years had a very important lesson that was interrupted by the sound of the music and your – untimely entrance.”
“Looking for you,” Malfoy said, “obviously.” He took Parvati’s empty seat and raised an eyebrow, crossing his legs at the ankles.
“I can’t,” wheezes Malfoy. His cheeks are pink and his nose is scrunched up and Harry can’t look away from him.
Harry kissed him back slowly, like they had all the time in the world, a hand on Malfoy’s neck, feeling incredibly giddy that they were here on the stands where anyone could see them in the sun.
“What!” Malfoy said, and seemed unable to speak for what Harry assumed was fear of possibly hexing him.
Harry pulls off his jacket, shirt, and pants. He climbs in the bed, next to Malfoy, and lies awake for almost the whole night, staring up at the ceiling and wondering at his own stupidity.
“I’ll be honest, I don’t really know anything about him,” Harry says. He vaguely remembers training with the man – he’d been funny, a fairly good friend – and ending up in bed together, but not really any details. “He was nice, I think.”
Ron shrugged. “I trust your judgement. Mind you,” he added as he, Harry, and Hermione started walking out, “Mum will freak when you and Ginny both bring home Slytherins.”
“Try those on,” Malfoy said distractedly an hour later, surveying a mannequin modelling a red jumper with his head tilted to the side.
Hermione took over. “That isn’t what we meant, Harry. Obviously, we still think Malfoy is an unpleasant little bastard – ”
Malfoy was cold, and pale. Harry wanted to kiss him forever and ever, wanted him here, right here, and then he made the mistake of breaking away from him. He looked at him and looked at him, and he didn’t think he could ever get enough. Malfoy smiled at him, reached up to smooth down Harry’s hair, a fool’s task, and then he froze.
– to see Malfoy chewing on his bottom lip in his silk pyjamas with his pale hair mussed. He registered Malfoy’s words and almost laughed, but his head felt a little dizzy as he staggered up from the ground. “You didn’t
Ron came back with the drinks and said, “Are we at five-pint sappy Harry and Hermione now? I’ve only just got the drinks!”
“You can call me Harry,” he says, and smiles at her. She doesn’t smile back, but her lips twitch a little.
“Then,” Malfoy went on, clearly entertained, “you do go out with Cho Chang after all, except you break up because you’re a horrible boyfriend. Then you go out with your best friend’s little sister, who had previously been dating Dean Thomas. You break up with your best friend’s sister and shag Seamus Finnegan, who is the best friend of your ex-girlfriend’s ex-boyfriend. And
a Gryffindor. Do you know what my mother would say? Actually,” Malfoy mused, “she might be pleased.”
McGonagall looked between the two of them and said, somewhat faintly, “I did do this to myself, didn’t I? I suppose this was the best outcome.”
“You don’t know anything!” said Malfoy, and for the first time he seemed angry. For some reason, this encouraged Harry.
“No, all he ever does is complain and insult my hair,” Harry replies automatically, then freezes. Maybe he should have said something more...couple-y? But Hermione laughs, so it must be alright.
“I don’t see this ending well,” Goyle said, mostly directed towards the table. Harry jumped a bit to hear him speak, thought of fire and Malfoy coughing out, “Crabbe,” as soon as he could speak.
“Sorry,” he said, breathless. His head was raised above Harry’s and his mouth was a kiss away, arms securely around Harry’s neck. A first clap of thunder rolled in the background, and almost as though he couldn’t help it, Malfoy lifted a trembling hand to brush Harry’s hair away and touched the lightning scar on his forehead, brushing his hand over until it came to rest at Harry’s jaw.
“Harry, Draco,” he says, after hugging Harry tightly enough to cut off his circulation, and shaking Malfoy’s other hand. His gaze moves to their intertwined hands, and he raises an eyebrow in true Remus fashion, but says nothing, only invites them in. Sirius comes out of the kitchen to greet them with narrowed eyes and stiff composure. He’s also wearing his pyjamas, and his hair is pulled back into a chaotic bun, but he doesn’t insult Malfoy, and Malfoy refrains from insulting
“Unless one of us meets someone they really like, in which case we will break off our pretend relationship,” Harry amends. In his case that’s unlikely, and he doesn’t like the idea of it happening to Malfoy, but it’s fair.
“I think I’ve almost got it,” Hermione said, and for a second Harry felt chilled, like he had almost understood something too, but then Hermione went on. “And I suppose Malfoy did apologise to me.”
“Me too,” Harry offered, though his stomach flipped over at the thought of the Aurors, whose letter he had still not answered. “Ron and I came for Hermione. It doesn’t – it doesn’t really feel right.”
It was a lot like living in their room at Hogwarts, living with Malfoy here, but it seemed different. Harry made breakfast in the morning, waving away Kreacher’s attempts to help, and they ate in the kitchen while Malfoy pretended not to like his food and finished it all. Malfoy worked on his revision after Kreacher made them lunch, and then they went out to walk around Muggle London where the pigeons and locals charmed Malfoy or to the gardens to clear up the weeds and dead gnomes. The first day they’d gone out to the garden, Harry had to move Sirius’s bike, the one Hagrid had fixed for him, and Malfoy disappeared into Grimmauld Place babbling about writing a letter to Pansy.
It was also hard to concentrate when Malfoy was singing in the shower, by which Harry meant it should have been hard to concentrate but wasn’t. He just wished Malfoy was out of the shower to insult his essay and thereby help him realise what he’d done wrong.
“Oh, not this again,” Daphne complained. “Get a life, Blaise, before you started mooning over Ginny you were interesting.”
This did make a certain sense. Malfoy often seemed like a histrionic Victorian maiden, especially when he stayed up all night studying.
Harry looked at his toast depressingly. It now looked about as appetizing as sawdust. This was a terrible conversation that made no sense whatsoever. Possibly nothing would ever make sense again.
Harry wrote about Mrs Weasley trying to get him and Ginny back together, and Ginny’s evasive responses re: Blaise, and the guilt and grief they all shared. He sent it off in the morning, with his and Ron’s letter to Hermione.
“Er,” Harry says. They’d proposed to each other at the same time, actually. Harry had set up a private dinner in one of Malfoy’s favourite, fancy restaurants, had gotten on one knee, and Malfoy had screamed
“And – ” Harry hesitates. “Maybe your family should know that the so-called Saviour of the Wizarding World is a flaming poof himself.” The Fawleys, he remembers, are an old pureblood wizarding family.
All in all, Harry is absurdly relieved when they make their excuses and leave. Malfoy looks traumatised for life as they step through the door.
Harry Potter,” clear as a bell in his head like he had travelled back in time, even though he had not caught another glimpse of Malfoy at all.
“Oh, goodness no,” McGonagall said, “or, occasionally – I suspect, at least – it was far more your father and mother that – or Mr. Black and Remus – ”
The Slytherin team were finishing up their practice when Harry arrived at the field, chattering with each other as they walked off the field, leaving it empty behind them. He saw Malfoy sitting at the top of the stands, the sunlight gleaming on his hair.
He looked so awkward, shoulders curling in and head down, that Harry nudged their arms together and gestured for him to sit down by Ron and Hermione.
“You really convinced her,” says Malfoy once she’s gone, pushing Harry’s arm away. “Good job, she definitely believes we’re in love.”
They found Franny – the gramophone, in an empty classroom, under the desk. Malfoy bent down to caress her – it – horrifyingly, and Harry leaned against the desk, long-suffering.
Blaise laughed and swung an arm over Harry’s shoulder. “Duly noted. You know, you’re alright, Harry Potter.”
in curling, bright gold letters. Harry registered Seamus’s disappointment and his own relief, said good night to Dean, and went on. Neville and Justin Finch-Fletchley, Seamus and Terry Boot. Then there was only Harry, Ron, Anthony Goldstein, and Malfoy left.
“What’d you wish for?” Harry says. His voice is soft. This is a moment, he thinks, he will remember for a long time. Malfoy in the rain, hair sticking to his head, eyes bright, mouth turned down.
“It’s not like that,” Harry said, like an idiot. “I – er.” He didn’t know what to say now. He thought wildly of Ginny, but he couldn’t imagine she would care much. She’d probably laugh. He should tell her anyway, just in case. He thought of Seamus – that was weird, certainly? “I don’t think – I don’t know if Seamus told you that in the summer when we went to that rave, we – just so you know – ”
Malfoy had to wait in order to humiliate them, and, he said, get away from his parents’ disastrous matchmaking attempts.
He woke up in the morning to the birds again, his neck aching and his back stiff, and Malfoy’s hands almost touching his. He wasn’t sure what time it was.
“Good,” Harry says. The world is hushed, quiet, as snowflakes flutter from the sky. He kisses Malfoy gently, hand fisted in the collar of Malfoy’s coat, as snow falls around them, coating them with white. He wonders how he ever could have stopped kissing Malfoy before. His heart is racing faster than it ever has in a Quidditch match. This is it, this is the one, this is what he’s been waiting for.
to just let him go like that, like nothing had happened at all last night, so Harry found himself saying, “Wait, we can...head down to lunch together? Since we didn’t eat?”
“Me too,” Sirius says. He sounds like he’s forcing the words out, but he also sounds like he’s telling the truth. “I’m happy for you too. I hope you’re – happy together.”
“Ah.” Rafael’s expression doesn’t change, but Harry can feel a certain shift in the mood. “Congratulations.”
He’s not just attracted to Malfoy in a passing way. He doesn’t just like having Malfoy as a friend. He is so obvious about that Sirius, Remus, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna, Pansy and fucking Dean Thomas and his sister knew before he did that he has more than a baseline compatibility with Malfoy and a sexual attraction to him.
Malfoy shudders. “That was horrifying. Give me your hand, Potter, so I can Apparate us back to a place where I will not be threatened.”
Malfoy had also said they should invite Rafael Hernandez. Harry thinks this has more to do with petty jealousy – of which Malfoy is a master – than with dark plans, but you can never be sure.
Malfoy takes a deep breath. He opens his mouth, a little hesitantly, and then he says, “I have to talk to Pansy.” He gives Harry one last look, and his eyes soften. He adds, “I’ll be back in an hour.”
Malfoy kept stealing Harry’s food and he casually leaned against Harry, who sat sideways so he could talk to Malfoy more easily, though Malfoy was only talking about how plebeian and awful it was that he’d slept on the sofa. It wasn’t like Harry couldn’t see the shock and horror on everyone else’s faces. It was just that it didn’t seem to matter. Neither did the fact that he’d missed his classes, or that his back still ached from last night. He didn’t feel tired for the first time he could remember since – since before the war, probably.
“Nothing,” Malfoy says. “You should have let me stay home. If you really like him we can stop doing this.”
Malfoy muttered something that was probably rude, under his breath and opened the door, stepping inside before Harry could. Harry scowled and followed him in. He tried not to feel like the sound of the door closing behind him was the sound of his casket lid slamming shut.
Narcissa softens a little. “And do you plan on marrying him? In which case we would not have an heir unless – ”
, Malfoy saying he’s wanted to kiss Harry since fifth year, Malfoy telling him not to leave, Malfoy giving him his mother’s ring, Malfoy kissing him back. “Malfoy and I are in love with each other,” Harry says out loud.
a good idea. Malfoy was probably the only person who would put up with Harry’s psychological damage and his obsession with treacle tart and his nightmares.
“I did not know, er,” Malfoy says, with a raised eyebrow. “Can I buy an Acid Pop before we have an actual conversation about…” Malfoy hesitates.
“I’ve been trying,” Harry said, but he had lost the thread of his anger. It wasn’t quite possible to be angry at Luna, and she had, after all, been held captive in Malfoy Manor. He wasn’t going to argue with her about Malfoy.
“I don’t want to impose,” Malfoy said slowly, which made Harry snort and try to throw lacewing flies at him. Malfoy dodged and relented, “Oh, fine, if you’re sure.”
“We’re going to get in trouble,” he said, looking out absently like he always did for the sound of Mrs. Norris sneaking up on them. He hadn’t even brought the Invisibility Cloak. He felt a little bare without it on him.
, but Malfoy was already going on, “That’s still not an excuse, you could at least buy terrible clothes in your
Guilt had twisted it’s way into Harry’s heart. “I didn’t – ” he began. “I didn’t know what that spell was. At least I didn’t throw any Unforgivables at you.” Everything was coming out wrong. Everything was always a fight with Malfoy. Why had he thought it could be different?
Malfoy had gone over to the bed with his trunk. He was hesitating. Harry waited, almost holding his breath. He wondered if he should say something, but before he could, Malfoy took a deep breath and turned around.
Dean stifles a laugh. “I also, uh, wanted to tell you I’m really happy for you and Malfoy. And I’m sorry about last year, when – ”
“I know!” Harry says. “I know. All of you were right, and I was wrong. I’m – an idiot. He doesn’t want to be in a relationship with me, Hermione. He just has an – attraction or something.”
He woke up with sunlight warm on his face: a crick in his neck and Malfoy sleeping next to him, their limbs all tangled together.
“Oh, alright,” Blaise said, and they started towards the Great Hall. This time Harry made sure they were going in the right direction.
It was hard to take the new professor seriously, since she trained Aurors and Harry had caught Death Eaters with her before, but she was a definite step-up from every other D.A.D.A professor Harry had ever had, except for Lupin, who would always remain Harry’s favourite teacher.
Seamus had come for Dean, and Ginny had come for her mother’s sake. He wondered what they were all really doing here, why they were bothering, in this castle that had been their home and then been a place they’d thought they would all die in.
It wasn’t for Malfoy that he stayed. He had known, that whole year, that Malfoy was planning something. It had never mattered that everyone dismissed him. Harry had hated Malfoy for so long, he could tell when something was wrong with him. It wasn’t for Malfoy’s sake. Only Harry had heard him, and he had sounded so frightened –
Malfoy came back holding an enormous and dusty tome Harry recalled seeing on their bookshelf, and dragged a chair beside Harry to sit in.
“His boyfriend,” Malfoy cuts in. Harry manages to restrain his surprised expression, but just barely. Hernandez doesn’t need to be lied to about who Harry is dating. Malfoy can’t be jealous...can he? Malfoy doesn’t want him that way. He’d made that clear a thousand times over. And Harry doesn’t like him like that, anyway. Just because he
“It’s nice that Draco defended you, dear,” Molly says, turning to Harry, “but it shouldn’t have gotten so violent.”
“Well, before,” amended Malfoy. “I had it drilled in my head to marry a rich pureblood woman and produce an heir, you know. Obviously my parents would never have accepted Pansy before, but we used to plot out marrying each other so we could have a sham marriage and have myriad live-in lovers. Nowadays, my mother would be grateful for a Parkinson, but I’m not going to be doing any of that anymore, so I suppose it does matter now, except not really and – I’m going to stop talking now.”
After, she said goodbye to them cheerily and made Malfoy promise not to ignore her again, which he did while still smiling.
him, and I – well, I did love Ginny. I’m bisexual. Hermione gave me a lot of pamphlets about it. I don’t know why I said that. I wish I hadn’t said that.”
“Ron and Hermione are your friends too,” Harry says. “And it's more like every second Tuesday. And I have dinner with Blaise all the time.”
“Oi, we’re running low on Floo powder, be careful,” Harry says. Once she’s gone, he turns to Malfoy. “What did she say to you?”
“Malfoy,” Harry said, deciding to use the head trauma as an excuse for what he said next, “you’re really weird.”
He made his way to the top of the stands and sat down on the seat behind Malfoy, because he did not think he would be able to look at Malfoy directly.
Harry smiles in response, Malfoy pokes his dimple absently, like he’s so used to poking Harry’s dimple that he does it without thinking now.
“I’d rather not go,” said Susan, looking very unhappy. “There’s only my parents and I left, and we’ve been a mess lately – ”
“Don’t leave,” Malfoy says. He looks vulnerable, suddenly, lying there with his mouth pink and his nose scrunched up. Harry wants – he doesn’t know what he wants. He wants to make sure no one ever hurts Malfoy again, especially not him. “Don’t leave.”
He feels that, having lured Malfoy to the side of light in sixth year and having lived with him for three years, he can now call them friends.
“Ron,” said Hermione reprovingly. “You know, Harry, I’m sure Professor McGonagall would understand that you’d feel more comfortable with Ron – ”
with Pansy’s, it was brilliant, and you can ask Daphne if you don’t believe me. She never let me touch her hair, though.” Malfoy’s face went distinctly mulish. “Didn’t
Harry did not say anything; it felt as though Hermione’s conjured canaries were flapping around in his stomach. Ginny cast a look at him, her hat pulled over her hair and her cheeks pink from the cold, but she didn’t say anything when they separated to their different common rooms.
Hermione and Ron stared at him, and Zabini scoffed out loud. But he thought Malfoy was smiling, a bit, no malice in his expression. He had never seen Malfoy smile like that before.
Malfoy thinks he’s attractive. Malfoy wants to suck his dick. Malfoy has wanted to kiss him since fifth year. Malfoy has dreams about him. Malfoy, Harry reminds himself, is drunk and has no idea what he’s talking about.
One small mercy is that Malfoy has apparently woken up already – though the coffee shop is closed today – and the bed is empty. Harry wonders if he had reached out for Malfoy in the night, if for a moment he had been able to touch Malfoy easily, without needing to think or worry about it.
it. Harry doesn’t want to say that he’s dating Malfoy more than he absolutely needs to, so, trying to stall for time until Sirius arrives, he says, “I like the new throw pillow.”
Normally, Malfoy’s tolerance is way more than Harry’s. He’s probably been sipping on wine since he was five years old. Harry’s not sure what’s going on, but he’s starting to ache with the effort of holding himself back from laughing.
“I was all for it,” Zabini drawled, raising an eyebrow at Malfoy and leaning against the doorway. Harry wondered if he was allergic to standing up without anything to recline on.
“What is wrong with you?” Malfoy shouted, still laughing even though Harry wasn’t tickling him anymore and tossing a pillow at him that Harry caught with six years of Seeker’s reflexes.
“It isn’t as though it comes as much of a surprise,” Hermione said faintly. “And it’s not your fault, Harry.”
, and then he smirks with the realisation, pleased and smug. Malfoy takes a hold of Harry’s hand gently –
they friends? Malfoy certainly wouldn’t say so, though they’d agreed to be, of a sort. Frenemies? Roommates? Living together meant they spent most of their time together unless one of them was working actively to avoid the other, and Malfoy wasn’t doing that anymore. “Don’t tell Malfoy that,” he added hastily. “He’ll make fun of me.”
“Harry.” Hermione turns to look at him. There’s something in her expression Harry can’t place, but it twinges at him. “I want you to be happy.”
The sooner the end of Easter holidays approached, the more restless Harry got. He didn’t want to leave. Leaving meant they’d be having exams, and after that, he’d have no choice but to decide what he was going to say in response to that Auror letter in his trunk.
It’s the beginning of December, so – three months, more or less. Harry can do that. “Perfect,” he says, because he has the exact same sense of humour. “Hermione might figure it out, though.”
When he and Malfoy came up together, Malfoy hesitated and Harry said, “Let’s just – ” and he nodded towards Malfoy’s bed and Malfoy looked relieved. They brushed their teeth together, making faces at each other in the mirror, which made fun of them back. They slept together again, and Harry didn’t have any nightmares. He woke up without Malfoy, with all his blankets tossed away and one sheet half-spread across him, and his hand outstretched towards the warmth where Malfoy had been before, a light breeze playing out from their window.
They go back home, and in between, Malfoy produces another Acid Pop and starts licking it, and Harry says
“He doesn’t,” Harry said, not particularly wanting to get into the specifics about telling him and having him run away, looking horrified. Harry’s eyes burned. He wished he had some Firewhiskey.
...it was different. And knowing that Malfoy was somewhere in the crowd made him flush and hear Malfoy’s cold, scornful voice drawling out, “
that it’s any of your business, but Harry hasn’t been sleeping,” Hermione fired at Zabini furiously, “and I wasn’t about to let you wake him up, it’s good for him to – ”
Malfoy laughed helplessly and covered his face with his hands. “Potter, we’re supposed to be going back to Hogwarts tomorrow and we haven’t even done any packing.”
“I cannot even begin to express the depths of my lack of surprise,” Malfoy told him, and they went back to Grimmauld Place with their dozens of bags and ordered takeout for lunch while Malfoy practiced Transfiguring items and made Harry ask him questions from his Arithmancy notes.
“Oh,” Parvati said. She rummaged through the basket and came out with a piece of what looked like a sweet, with almonds inside it. “When I can’t sleep I go to the kitchens to ask the house elves for
“I will always call you Potter,” Malfoy said darkly. “I am not so lost that I’ve forgotten my vow never to call you by your first name.”
“Hi, Harry,” she says, “what’s this about, then? Not that I mind seeing you, or having an excuse to leave work, Merlin knows those vultures at the Ministry – ”
him. He was in love with Draco Malfoy and had been for who the fuck knew how long, and now he was doomed.
“Not really,” says Pansy, unconcerned. “But I’d rather be distracted than have to sit there and think about everything that went wrong.”
Harry tries not to gape at him and changes the subject hastily to Percy’s new girlfriend. When the time comes for him to go home, he’s pleasantly buzzed, all thoughts of Malfoy almost completely driven from his mind and feeling extremely fond of Ron and Hermione, who are the best friends anyone could ask for.
“Oh, for goodness sake,” said Malfoy in a low voice. “All that and you’re not going to leave? Your adoring fans are here, Potter, they’re waiting for you to leave so they can skin me alive and present me as a trophy to stick on your wall!”
“It’s the truth,” Malfoy said, moving his fingers into Harry’s hair. Harry turned back and rested his back against Malfoy’s, felt Malfoy breathe shakily in and out and press a ghost of a kiss against Harry’s hair. “Your hair’s got gold in it in the sun,” he added, quiet like he didn’t even mean for Harry to hear, tracing the line of Harry’s shoulder.
Rafael clears his throat. “I suppose there isn’t any chance of me convincing you to come back to playing professional Quidditch, Harry?”
“Hermione,” Harry said, and didn’t know what to say. He couldn’t deny it. He was coming up on the edge here, almost there, almost there. He reached out to grasp her hand. “Hermione, you make me happy too. You and Ron. You know that, don’t you?”
Harry shrugged, half-smiling. He felt Malfoy pull away, and looked at the ground when Malfoy rubbed his sleeve over his eyes.
“If not we’re going to do it anyway,” Zabini drawled out. He was leaning against the doorway, naturally, because he was an enormous pillock.
“But no one’s staying,” Harry protested. Everyone was going home to their family, either because they wanted to be home or because their parents wanted them to be home. Hermione, the Ravenclaws, and Justin had been panicking over bringing their revision and books home. Ron said the exams were ages away, to which Hermione had snapped that there were only
Everywhere he looked was a happy couple. Ron gave Hermione a new book and flowers, and she had got him chocolate, and they kept beaming at each other. Parvati was sitting on Daphne’s lap, a flower crown perched on her head as they both made their way through the mountain of chocolate that had been sent for Harry.
“You’re welcome,” Harry said, unruffled and unprepared for the way Malfoy stared at him before turning away and muttering something under his breath.
“No, I wasn’t going to stay with them for the holidays,” said Harry, “I was – well, we can stay in Grimmauld Place.”
Harry could hear it falling from the open window in the dining room. He went to close it and found himself staring instead, breathing in the rain and looking at the grey landscape, buildings and people ducking their heads under umbrellas, rushing to get home. Malfoy found him there, still looking outside.
“Thanks, Hermione,” Harry says, and he stands up too. “I don’t know what I’d do without you. Do I need to come to the Ministry and give some of them a piece of my mind?”
“How many would you reckon?” Ginny presses on. “Ron and Hermione say they’d like two. Hypothetically, of course.”
, which is hidden underneath the middle couch cushion. Harry counts them lucky no one has managed to stumble upon it yet – it would be hard work to explain that
“Oh Harry,” says Hermione, her hand pressed to her mouth. “I feel a little embarrassed about believing you’d gotten engaged, but this is lovely, really, I’m so glad you’re happy.”
“You’re just pretending, and now you’ve realised that wish you were actually dating him,” Hermione finishes sympathetically.
Malfoy kept staring. He looked down at his hand tossed carelessly over Harry’s chest and quickly snatched it back.
Malfoy complained at length about the curtains in the drawing room and some of the “ghastly” decor. Harry drew the line at going to Diagon Alley to pick up materials, though. They did their best with colour-changing charms and getting rid of some carpets and furniture that even Harry agreed were hideous to look at.
didn’t know that,” Harry said, and felt warm inside for reasons he didn’t really want to try and figure out.
He had thought of thirteen long years with the Dursleys. He had thought of his cupboard under the stairs.
It was just that they had never gotten to know each other, never really had the opportunity to have fun. They had always had the shadow of war over their heads.
Maybe he was rooming with Ron. He could hope, at least. Neville, Dean, or Seamus, or one of the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs would be fine too, but – Harry’s stomach flipped. It wasn’t going to be – McGonagall wouldn’t –
Harry frowned. “It was an accident. A door hit us,” he said. “And Malfoy’s also injured. In his head.” This was a truer statement than Madam Pomfrey would ever know. “I tried to cast a spell but he wouldn’t let me.”
“What happened to your hatred, Potter,” Malfoy said mournfully. “Where has it gone? What has happened to your violent urges to punch me repeatedly until I’m bleeding?”
Harry yawned enormously and stretched out his legs before curling them up and tucking his head on the pillow. He meant to tell Malfoy to move over, but then he was already falling asleep.
“Grimmauld Place,” Malfoy repeated, startled. “The Blacks’ place. That’s right – it was yours, after – I don’t know, Potter.”
Harry laughed, leaning against the wall and careful not to lean by Walburga’s portrait. “You had dance lessons?”
“Oh, dear God,” Malfoy said, watching with his hands over his eyes as Blaise checked his hair and started moving towards Ginny from the Slytherin table.
“Whose don’t?” Dean said. He was watching the game of chess too, but mostly he was watching Seamus. “My parents didn’t want me coming back at all.”
“Why would I tell my worst enemy that I can’t sleep, Potter?” Malfoy asked in a reasonable voice. “That seems like a very strange thing to do. And I know you can’t sleep sometimes. You sneak out to go to the common room or wake up with nightmares.”
“She wouldn’t say anything,” Harry says. “Not until everything is over, anyway. You’ll have to come for dinner with Sirius and Remus, then.”
“She gave us some pamphlets,” said Hermione. “I think I still have some of them, I don’t know if they’d be useful, though.”
“Yes.” McGonagall’s gaze was sympathetic. “You know, Harry, that Hogwarts will always have a place for you, however many years down the road you choose to return. I daresay any Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher would be thrilled to train you as a replacement.”
Never tickle a sleeping dragon. It’s a bad idea to antagonize Malfoy, there’s no denying that, but – well, he’s always been a little reckless. He raises his eyebrows at Malfoy. It’s a challenge. Isn’t it always, with them? “Go ahead.”
“Yes,” Malfoy said, giving him a weirded-out look. “Blaise used the Potion, he told his mother and she went to St. Mungo’s to ask for it. That’s why he was in and out of the Hospital Wing in school.”
“You slept through all your morning classes,” Hermione said anxiously. “Oh, I knew we should have come here before! We checked in the morning but we – um.” Hermione cast a quick-silver glance at Malfoy, and looked embarrassed when she turned back to Harry. “We didn’t want to wake you up.”
“Merlin,” Ron says, shaking his head, but he’s got a smile on his face – that small, slow, pleased one he reserves for Harry and Hermione. “You okay to Apparate, Harry?”
McGonagall folded her hands on her desk and stared them down: Harry, on one chair, fidgeting, and Malfoy, pale on another chair, a respectable distance away. Franny had been stashed behind McGonagall’s desk but she was still singing softly, and Malfoy was biting his lip, looking over there and not looking at Harry or McGonagall. Malfoy’s mouth was swollen from before. Harry did not want to think about his hair. He could not bring himself to look directly at McGonagall either. He really wanted to die, preferably now but any time today could be arranged.
Harry looked at her pleading face, the brown of her hair curling over her neck, her dark skin and wide, warm eyes, Ron’s arm thrown over her shoulder. He had no idea what he would do if he lost either one of them. “I’m alright,” he said. “Don’t worry.”
“That I obviously have been embarrassingly in love with you for going on a year now, and everyone is incredibly sick of it, and if you look at me like that, with your
“I thought about, you know,” said Malfoy. “Calling Weasley, or waking you up, or getting you a Sleeping Draught. Madam Pomfrey says I use them too often, but she’d probably give them to
The song ended and Malfoy moved suddenly away. “Nothing on Baby and Johnny, of course,” he said, too quick, his voice hoarse. “We could never manage any of the dips or lifts.”
“Okay,” Harry said, and they sat for a few more moments before he noticed Malfoy nodding off and hauled them both off to bed.
, that his father was in prison still, and he had to stay safe, that Voldemort was looking for them. That was the first time Harry had hugged Malfoy, and he had never wanted to let go – but he did. The year after that, Harry didn’t go back to Hogwarts. He played professional Quidditch for a few months, and he missed his family – family that was not his by blood, but what did that matter? –  so much he came back. McGonagall offered him the Defence Against the Dark Arts teaching post a year later, and he accepted. Malfoy graduated with seven N.E.W.T.s but all he did with them was open up his own coffee shop and write articles about Potions and corrupted politicians on the side. And Harry moved in with him, and he was happy.
“Then it turned out you were sharing a room. And I was prepared, Harry,” said Hermione earnestly. “I was prepared for the stalking, and the constant talking about it – ”
Once they were inside, the fire blazing and the common room empty, Malfoy said, words stumbling all out of him like he couldn’t stop himself, “I don’t understand what you want me to do. I’ve been trying this whole time – ”
Valentine’s Day was awful as a result. He’d got no sleep at all, and at breakfast, he’d received so many Valentines they were all obscuring his breakfast. He couldn’t see anything except owls swooping down and handing him cards and a few memorable Howlers that made the eighth years all howl with laughter. Harry listened to the Howlers and tried to move the cards away from his toast despondently. One of them, a picture of a hideous dwarf wearing pink and red with an arrow, kept squeaking out, “Marry me, Harry Potter!”
“You’re very drunk,” Harry answers, pushing past the crowds of people around them and stepping outside. The night air is cool, blowing his hair in every which way. He breathes in. Breathes out. Nights like this are made for living.
Harry looked at the door and made a decision on the spot. “I’ll prove I can last at least an hour with Slytherins and then you have to believe me.”
“Well, would you look at that,” Malfoy said, astonished, amongst a backdrop of whistling and crowing. “I never thought it would really happen.”
Malfoy was, technically, on all counts, a perfect roommate. He didn’t leave his things around the room, he cleaned up after himself, he studied in the library or the common room, he never brought anyone up there. The thing was that Harry never saw him do any of this, because the only time he saw Malfoy was when they both went to bed, and sometimes he didn’t sleep in his room. Padma Patil occasionally went to her sister’s room instead, so that the other bed in Hermione’s room was empty, and he, Ron, and Hermione could push the beds together and sleep all curled up together.
Ron was right, Harry thought. It was better that Malfoy was always either asleep or out of the room. What else had he expected? That they would fight over who went to the bathroom first, argue over keeping the lights on or off, windows open or closed? That they would spell each other’s hair pink in the night, spill cold water all over each other’s bed in the morning? That it would be unbearable not to bother each other? And what had
Malfoy’s smile is strained, but Harry thinks he and Neville are the only ones to notice. “Yes, honey bunch.”
It was Remus who introduced him to reading. Harry thinks it wasn’t Narcissa or Lucius who introduced Malfoy. He thinks Malfoy introduced himself. It’s a strange thought, a young, hungry, lonely Malfoy absorbing himself in words upon words upon words.
“Oh, Odo the hero,” he sings into Harry’s ear, leaning against his shoulders heavily, face flushed and hair an endearing mess, “they...something something home...something...something…”
They had reached the wooden doors and the statues. Harry said the password and they moved aside. He could have sworn the knight was laughing at him.
to the List, but he finds himself falling asleep instead, right there on that stupid couch, falling asleep and dreaming of kissing Malfoy.
Hermione sighs impatiently. “You slept with Rafael, at a time when Malfoy was feeling abandoned by you. Rafael is an attractive, famous Quidditch player. How much more do you need me to spell out for you? You
Harry...really could not think of a response to this. He decided to ignore it. “Well, Ginny’s not an object you get,” he said sharply. “If you like her, be honest with her. And don’t you dare hurt her. I’m sure she’d beat you to a bloody pulp and have your face covered in bat bogies if you even tried, and you’d have six brothers and me to go through after that.”
The conversation ended shortly thereafter, when Hermione dragged Ron away and told Harry to really think about what she’d said. Only, the last time Harry had listened to Hermione’s advice about Malfoy, he’d ended up with his lips pressed to Malfoy’s, and Malfoy running away from him. It wasn’t technically Hermione’s fault, but. As a result, he merrily ignored Hermione’s advice, and pushed away Problem Number 2.
“I dunno,” Harry says. “He was acting weird the whole day. He was rude to Rafael Hernandez, and he was staring at me before we left for the pub.”
Malfoy turned around and crossed his arms, raising an eyebrow. “I think I may have caused extensive brain damage,” he said, “and Merlin knows you can’t handle any more of that.” His expression went pinched, then, like he’d said too much, but Harry didn’t mind. It occurred to him that he and Malfoy were having a civil conversation.
He followed everyone on the train and into a compartment when they managed to shake them off, where they all squished together and cast a locking charm on the door. Hermione and Ron’s hands were clasped, Neville had a set look to his jaw, Ginny’s chin was tilted up, and Seamus had a tight and vice-like grip on Dean’s arm, but Luna was humming noncommittally and they were all putting on a fine show of being okay otherwise. They were okay, most of them, or they were going to be. Harry, on the other hand – he didn’t know.
“No, they don’t,” Harry answers him, pushing the trolley to another aisle. “And I don’t know why you like those. They’re sick.” He gets some fruit anyways. Malfoy is a slave to blueberries. He likes the sweet ones best, but Harry is of the opinion that the sour ones are superior.
“I didn’t want to come back,” she said. “I did it for Padma. I was going to go straight to the Aurors, but I didn’t want to leave her.”
McGonagall recovered herself and became steely-eyed once more. “I apologise. You only reminded me of someone just then, Mr. Malfoy. But I will not confiscate – Franny. I will take ten points from Gryffindor and Slytherin instead, and both of you have separate detentions on Saturday. Mr. Potter, you will be helping Slughorn clean out old Potions cauldrons in the morning. Mr. Malfoy, you will be with me, grading papers. I suggest you keep your gramophone – ” McGonagall cast a glance at Franny, still merrily playing ‘Hungry Eyes’, and looked briefly to the heavens as if to grant her patience before looking away. “In your common room. Mr. Malfoy, you are dismissed. Mr. Potter, stay here with me for a moment.”
“Harry, Malfoy’s stolen you away,” Ginny said. “Come play Spin the Wand with us. Come sit with us. Come dance with me.”
“Had to,” Malfoy echoed. “No you didn’t. You could have stayed gone. Most people would have, if they’d been you. I would have, but I was. I was never like you. You did – you did the right thing, I suppose, like you always do.”
Ginny moved closer to them and Harry dropped the subject. They had a lively discussion about Quidditch instead, and by the time Harry, Ron, and Hermione had said goodbye to Ginny and Luna and made their way to their common room, Harry was yawning. He wanted to sit on the armchairs by the fire with Ron and Hermione anyway, but Anthony Goldstein was in the library, and Ron immediately whisked Hermione away upstairs. Harry stayed down and reflected grimly that Ron’s room was right next to his, and that he hoped they used Silencing Charms. He half-heartedly joined Neville and Terry Boot’s conversation, and then when they went upstairs, he waited a few more moments and walked up to his room where, no doubt, Malfoy would already be asleep.
“Zabini and some of the others came and asked if we wanted to have a bit of a get-together with everyone,” Harry said.
“You idiot,” Malfoy said, gently. “It is what it is. You almost killed me and then you saved my life. It’s alright.”
“Do you.” Malfoy presses his face closer to Harry’s, nudging their noses together. “Is this real, for you?”
They sat in silence for a while, but Harry hadn’t felt awkward or uncomfortable in any way. He’d felt, instead, comforted, by Malfoy’s presence and that the reason for it was the same as his own. And he had fallen asleep after all, at that kitchen table, when he usually only felt safe enough to sleep in the same room as Ron and Hermione or Sirius and Remus.
When Malfoy did finally wake, he didn’t even have the decency to look surprised that Harry was there. He looked exhausted, like he hadn’t slept the entire time Harry had been waiting. He always looked exhausted in sixth year.
“I am not delicate,” Malfoy said crossly, at the same time that Harry did. They both exchanged startled looks with each other as Madam Pomfrey leaned over Harry and muttered, “
Malfoy’s grip on Harry’s elbow got much tighter as they made their way towards the booth around a table with a great deal of drinks. There was Blaise on one side, sitting next to Daphne and a black boy Harry didn’t recognise; Gregory Goyle was next to Blaise, beside him a figure he thought was Millicent Bulstrode, and an Asian girl with cropped hair that he vaguely remembered as being Pansy Parkinson.
,” Malfoy said under his breath, and Mrs. Norris stared at them for another silent moment, before turning around and padding out the door.
Harry closes his eyes; beside Ginny, Malfoy blanches. “Too much information, Ginny. Too much information.”
“You are a man possessed,” Ron said gravely. “We lived through sixth year, Harry, and you know, we’re doing our best to understand – ”
Harry’s heart sank, and he and Ron looked at each other with dismay. He hadn’t been able to sleep without Ron and Hermione in the room, lately. He hadn’t been able to sleep at all, really. It was one of the things he and Ginny had argued about. She had said he couldn’t sleep without them there, and Hermione couldn’t sit down unless she knew where they both were, and, “Ron has this fucking guilt complex about leaving you two alone for more than an hour, and where does that leave me?” Harry hadn’t been able to answer her.
“How do you people even get in here?” Harry says wearily. “And haven’t you got a Quidditch match, Gin?”
“Pans, I swear I did this already,” Blaise said, exasperated, “and unless you want Draco coming back and killing us – ”
“The thing is that a lot of pureblood families do teach their children Latin,” said Malfoy, “mine did. So they do have that advantage coming to school, and since a great deal of the school governors are pureblood, and even the teachers, they don’t think about how it would be helpful for Muggleborn and half-blood children. And even if it’s helpful for them, a great deal of the pureblood children would be dead bored in that class, it’s a bit of a bind – ”
“It is distracting,” said Malfoy very sternly. “I am still hungover. In the past few minutes I have been put through the wringer, emotionally speaking. And now you seem to think I’m straight.”
“I’ll try my best not to,” he promises. He doesn’t want to hurt Malfoy, not ever again, but he doesn’t think he
“No, we’re not,” Harry says, and then trails off. “We’re just pretending. Sorry, about that. Your sister makes great, er, cake. Uh.”
“I am glad, you know,” Malfoy said, sounding vicious. “I’m glad it ended this way. My family name is dirt and my father’s in Azkaban and I’m
Malfoy was clearly experiencing some sort of mental breakdown. It was probably best to leave him to it. “You alright?” Harry asked mildly when it seemed like he was finished.
“‘M not that drunk...don’t worry,” Harry assures him, planting a sloppy kiss on Ron’s cheek and giving him a cheeky smile. He wobbles a bit on the spot.
“Yeah, stuff influenced by moods, conversations, desires...stuff like that mostly. Remember the fertility line?” Malfoy says, disarming the red string and watching it sizzle into nothing.
“I could have been making coffee this whole time if I’d known you liked it.” Harry says, sitting down.
“I want to make this house a home, ultimately...but I don't know the first thing about that. I...am certainly not attached to the way it currently is. It's quite….dark.” Harry admits, rubbing at his neck and looking around the dingy, dark room.
“Breathe, love. This is as new to you as it'll be to them.” Molly rocks gently with the baby in her arms.
"So you won't be a part of her life? Even now when I know?" Harry asks gently. He has a family with Draco. Harry's heart clenches in surprising excitement.
Harry goes to the kitchen and walks back to the couch with the baby, Molly following closely behind.
“ Yeah okay. No wonder you couldn’t say no!” Ron says from the couch where he's gently rocking his arms side to side.
“And you want my help?” He asks, his hands coming up to the worn edges of his robe and rub against the fray.
“I don't think so, sir. It seems she had a hard enough time letting go, I don't want to make it worse.” Harry admits. Arthur nods and tucks the note into the basket Molly left behind.
Harry nods and stands when Hermione and Ron do. They hug him tightly one by one then walk toward the floo together. Ron turns back and smiles at him.
Harry laughs quietly and plates a heaping helping of as much as he can fit, then sits at the table. Malfoy follows suit. They quietly eat for a while before Harry works up the nerve to say anything. He silently debates waiting until after today's work which snowballs into considering if he should wait until the whole house is done, seeing as they haven't even started on objects yet. But he decided he ought to pluck up the courage and be done with it.
“They'd be the first people I want to tell, though.” Harry casts his Patronus, sending them a brief message asking them to meet him at the burrow if they are available. To know one's surprise they fall through the floo almost instantly.
"GINNY!" Harry shoots up from the ground. "DID YOU SERIOUSLY ADOPT A BABY AFTER WE HAD AN ARGUMENT ABOUT NOT BEING READY!"
"If you must know, Potter. I'm just upset because I lost the chance to have a family of my own. Now let's finish up this room and be done for the day. I'm exhausted." Malfoy spins in place and makes to begin plucking at the red strings behind him again.
"What is this all about?" Harry asks, this whole conversation is sitting under his skin uncomfortably.
"And you presume Granger knows things like that about me? You lot don't know the first thing about me!" Malfoy clenches his wand until his knuckles are white.
“Not that it's any of your business but we aren't together anymore.” Harry says. This whole conversation has him confused and on edge. Malfoy purses his lips into a tight little frown that makes Harry feel worse somehow. “So can you help or no?”
"Really? Cause Hermione implied you might have a soft spot for ‘em." Harry says, folding his arms as well.
Making breakfast the next morning, Harry pulls all his best stops. He makes the bacon perfect, crispy and golden. Fresh blueberry muffins, hot and buttery. Eggs, perfect yolks and crackling whites. Fresh fruit, washed and juicy. He waits anxiously with everything under a stasis charm for Malfoy to come down.
Malfoy closes his eyes tightly, his posture deflating. He brings a hand up to his eyes and sighs deeply.
He watches Malfoys jaw work as it clenches and unclenches for a moment. His eyes roll up toward the ceiling like he might cry.
“ Okay time to get you comfy, love.” He murmurs to her. He sets the bag onto the coffee table and opens it. He unshrinks the crib they’d packed and puts the extra blanket over the wicker to make a soft, fuzzy bottom. He sets Lily onto the cushion and runs a finger briefly over her cheek, a soft smile on his lips.
"You're being serious." She sees the card and takes it. "Ginevra Weasley...Oh god what is this, what's happening."
“Harry, you can’t be serious. You don’t know what you’re doing. This is a whole nother living thing, don’t be stupid.” Ginny drops her hands to her sides, the note crumpling slightly.
Malfoy misses his step, stumbles into the wall, and bashes his hand against the door frame. His face goes from pained to hurt to sad to sorrowful to blank to a facetious sneer.
“Alright so if you cast on that side of the kitchen and I start on this side, the fabric should become visible, then we can work on identifying the spellwork.” Malfoy walks to the far wall and Harry walks to the wall near the doorway. They cast against their respectful sides and a mesh like grid of golden strings interwoven with colored strings appears above the surfaces of the room.
"Oh...um cause Hermione said even if she's a baby she'll be recognizing spaces soon and I don't want her to get too used to the burrow...so with the first floor sorted I figured having her around would get her used to being here." Harry scratches at his neck with his wand, though it more slides than scratches against the sheen of sweat he seems to live in nowadays.
Malfoy quickly chews, swallowing earlier than he probably ought to. “ Yeah, Kreacher was able to give me some pepper-up potion and that really seemed to help.”
“She's lovely, Harry. Thank you for giving her my name.” She mumbles into his neck, then enters the floo with Ron. They disappear in a quiet flurry of green flames and Harry turns toward Molly.
“Would you like to meet her today or tomorrow?” Harry asks, his heart hammering weirdly in his chest. He doesn't know why but he wants Malfoy to like her.
“Of course.” Harry leads them to the parlor where two plush sofas sit. They both cough a little at the swirl of dust that blooms in the air as they sit. Harry vanishes it quickly. Malfoy sits, rubbing his stomach gently for a moment before sitting back and pulling a tiny notebook and his wand from his pocket. Harry briefly remembers giving it back to him after his trial.
"I know, Harry. Do you really think I would be stupid enough to do something so reckless when were on the cusp of a breakup?" Ginny crosses her arms defiantly.
“Oh good...I um… I made breakfast. If you'd like some.” Malfoy chews on his nail and Harry smiles at the nervous gesture.
“ I was hoping to stay here while I fix up Grimmauld. I don't know what I'm doing…. at all” Harry admits with a slight smile. “ I was hoping to learn from the best. Molly?”
“ This is some of the most densely woven spellwork I’ve seen. Most likely it will be thinner in other rooms. My guess is that the core of the house is this kitchen space. Which likely means it's meant to be much larger. Which would make sense.” Malfoy spins in place, surveying the room. “ The blue lines are health spellwork, the green is luck or fortune spellwork and red will be your pureblood spell work. There's a lot less of it then I thought. The silver is going to be stuff you don't want to touch, gold is your base and silver is the support, so identify but don't alter.”
“I...think maybe yes.” Harry sighs and groans angrily, throwing his head back against the plush squeaky pleather of the booth. “It's complicated but he haunts 97 percent of my every waking thought so that's certainly clued me in.”
“ I think you’d better sit for this.” He says, pulling at his fringe. They nod and sit on the long couch in the den.
Harry leads them to the apparition point then side-alongs Malfoy. They land wobbling on their feet in the front hall. Malfoy falls away from his arm and dry heaves, leaning bonelessly against the wall.
“ I’m okay with you leaving, I want you to be happy. I can talk to Molly. She’ll help. Obviously the mother doesn’t see herself being fit enough to raise this baby, Ginny. I have money, support, a home. I can make this work.” Harry feels confident in himself, he at least has a blueprint of how not to treat a child and that has to count for something.
“We should – bed,” Malfoy said, but Harry kissed him again until he was saying, “What was I – what did I say – ”
They were in Potions, working as partners. Slughorn had stopped looking baffled at this development and now took to smiling benevolently at Malfoy, who had forgotten his initial dislike of Slughorn and now looked pleased every time he smiled. It worked out well, since Malfoy was much better at Potions than Harry was. Slughorn had so far not noticed any lack of Harry’s previous brilliant skills, or the fact that these days Harry was mostly just staring at Malfoy’s hands while they measured ingredients and stirred potions.
Malfoy nodded. “Turns out wizards don’t like the idea of another family being that far above them. Anyway, her family’s dead and everyone’s given up on her except one of those knights, Meera Shafiq. She was an extremely distant ancestor of your grandmother probably, and she went looking for the daughter because she’d sworn to protect the family. She managed to find her, and she kept this diary along the way, it was a
“Exactly!” Malfoy hissed, casting a dark look back at Teddy, who was singing and drawing a picture. “I’ve missed two years of his birthdays! No presents, no money! He knows! He knows what I’ve done! Do you know what I would have done to a relative who ignored my birthday, Potter?”
“Camille is my sister,” explains Dean to Harry, who belatedly remembers Dean’s host of half-siblings and reckons he should probably have made the connection, since this is a Muggle shop and Dean’s mentioned them before. Harry’s not really good with names, a fact Malfoy always makes fun of him for.
Harry followed him down to where the rest of their year was chattering and laughing. Ron and Hermione, mercifully, didn’t say they’d told him so, but smiled instead. He let everyone make the teams with his arms around Malfoy’s neck, while Ginny pretended to gag and Daphne made fun of them. The only thing he was firm on was that he and Malfoy be Seekers.
“Hi,” Malfoy says absently. Harry plops down onto the couch, and, ignoring Malfoy’s half-hearted protests, rests his head against Malfoy’s chest and steals half of his blanket.
“You are plebeian and awful,” Harry commiserated, and Malfoy whacked him with a pillow before getting up to go into the bathroom.
and immediately spots Harry and Malfoy. He smiles at them, walking over, and then he sort of looks at them. Then he looks back at the sign outside of the shop that boasts free wedding cake samples for engaged couples, and the smile fades, to be replaced by an expression of befuddlement.
He had only two nightmares, which was better than usual. One of them was Dumbledore’s body falling off the Astronomy Tower, which turned into Fred, which turned into Lupin, which turned into Tonks, and he rushed down to catch them but they were gone before they hit the ground.
With Franny under Malfoy’s arm, they made a dash for the door, turning right and retracing their steps back to the common room, with the music crooning
“And instead of using a spell or your personal physique to kick me off, you decided to cuddle up to someone I remember you violently hating with a passion and in fact attempting to murder once, perfectly reasonable idea,” said Zabini. “Though I admit, last night was not my finest moment. I apologise most sincerely. Quite impolite of me. In my defense my advances had been ignored for the first time in, well, forever. I was facing a serious case of heartbreak and I’d had to get incredibly drunk to deal with it, and mistook your room for my own.”
“I’m all right,” Malfoy says indignantly, teetering on the spot and stumbling into Harry, who catches him easily. Malfoy weighs almost nothing. Harry doesn’t budge against him. He likes Malfoy like this. Uncomplicated. Leaning against Harry. Smiling.
“Er,” Harry said, and was fortunate that at this moment the door opened to reveal Ron, Hermione, and Blaise Zabini, all arguing fiercely with each other. They stopped once they caught sight of Malfoy and Harry, both sitting on their separate beds, heads tilted towards each other like plants towards the sun.
Malfoy looked at him for a long time and then he leaned over and kissed Harry, once, lightly, soft. And it was
“What,” says Harry, staring at him, and then, of course, Malfoy struts inside his classroom, a satisfied smirk playing at the corner of his mouth. And is he – he’s holding a giant bouquet of roses. Of course he is. “Fuck,” Harry mutters under his breath, and fights the urge to hide under his desk.
you going to do all alone here anyway?” Malfoy asked over breakfast on Easter Sunday. “Just brood? Walk around the rooms and sulk?”
and not because of Quidditch tryouts. He shakes his head again, and makes his goodbyes to the Weasleys. He’s ready to go home.
Harry beams. “Aw, babe.” He accepts the roses gracefully, and grabs hold of Malfoy’s robes, pulling him closer. He kisses Malfoy on the cheek and whispers, “Nice try,” in his ear. Out loud, he says, “I’ll see you at home, darling.”
Harry does his best to thank her, though his insides are twisting with regret. He hates lying to Hermione, and she’s so
Malfoy was smiling his tiny, sincere smile, the one Harry used to think was a smirk. “Thanks, Potter.”
“Yeah. He said I was, er, attractive last night. When he was drunk. Among other things. But he was drunk.”
The guest room was pretty much his already, and there was another one for any friends who might end up staying over. It was the most convenient solution, was how Harry phrased it.
Harry’s heart probably stops. “Malfoy,” he manages, “you’re really drunk, you have no idea what you’re saying – ”
, thinks Harry despairingly. It isn’t supposed to be this easy to convince everyone in his life that he’s in love with Draco Malfoy. Sirius and Remus, at least, should question his supposed romantic feelings. Harry isn’t sure whether to be offended or impressed at his own acting skills.
“I can sleep it off,” Harry tried, following Malfoy to the door out of the common room. “Give me a napkin, I think my nose is bleeding.”
“I heard that, during the summer, you have a place for students to stay,” says Adriana in a rush, like the words are easier to come out quickly. “If they have nowhere else to go, or their families don’t want them – and my family doesn’t want me, sir, not me as I am.” She lifts her chin up, looking an equal mix of ashamed and proud. “I’m a lesbian, you see, and they don’t approve. They sent me a letter, telling me to come back for winter break, because they’ve hired someone to make me see that I should like men. I’m staying at Hogwarts, but I don't know where I'll go for the summer. I don’t – I don’t want to go back.”
“Kindergarten? I’m so proud of you, did you have fun my darling, darling?” His voice bounded and bounced with a doting tone. The red haired girl smiled dreamily as the little girl cheered, still holding onto her son’s arm as the three migrated out of the office. Alex following as soon as Lily nodded her ascent.
Hadrian didn’t think it would matter too much to him if they didn’t remember. The way they had bracketed him between them. How S-Papa would look at him as if he hung the moon, or how Dad would look at him with so much awe and pride. Hissing to Nagini to watch over his prince with all she had. Hadrian knew that even if they couldn’t remember his birth and the year he’d been blessed to have with them, he would be fine. They loved him, and that was more than enough for Hadrian.
“Lucius, be kind on the boy. That reminds me so much of my eighth year at Hogwarts, the way I would drool after my husband. Though he was more subtle with his teasing. Young love in times like these is… refreshing.” A few moments and they were all seated at their dining room table. A warm Cherrywood table that Draco knew Hadrian had seen him ogling when the brunet had jokingly dragged him to an ‘Ikea’.
Rage was still burning like a lovingly stoked fire in his chest, growing hotter with each minute. But something was also soothed. Godson. He had two, technically three, you didn’t get Hadrian without Laney tagging along. That desperate part of him that tracked everything he owned calmed a bit, giddily counting again and again. Three. Three. Three. He had more than he’d started with.
“Never thought I’d see the day you volunteered to claim three children in a week. I trust you’ll be as good a godfather to them as you have been with Draco.” Lucius smiled. “Perfect, the next set is of course talking to the children. Without you present unfortunately to avoid claims of coercion. Would Hadrian be okay with that?”
“Do you think Sirius would help us as Lord Black? He loved Harry, he’d be so happy to see him again. Perhaps he’d even come to see Alex again, he misses Padfoot and Moony quite a lot. It’d be nice to have us all home together again, like old times.” James frowned.
“I’m Sara Anderson, please just call me Sara. This is my wife Erin Dragma. We’re pleased to meet you! You’re Severus Snape, our children’s head of house, right? Minerva was talking to us along the way. I’m glad to see you in person however! As long as we’re not here because certain people,” An amused glance towards the twins was sent. Only Laney grinned bashfully as Hadrian was too busy cooing over his little sister to care. “Decided to blow up a sink again.”
“He’s doing great, Alex is annoying, but our classes are awesome! I’m getting tutored, but Hadrian’s curb stomping the rest of us in lessons.”
“I can’t believe your whole family’s been Slytherins! That’s pretty cool, if either of our moms went to Hogwarts I probably would want to follow their footsteps too I guess. Is it rare for families to stick to the same houses?” Hadrian politely pressed himself into the conversation as he tuned back in, Draco looked affronted for half a second that someone was interrupting his discussion until he realized who it was. Hadrian idly contemplated the theory that curiosity usually beats annoyance.
“We should get our robes on. We’re going to be at the school soon.” The train ride was supposed to be hours, but it had only felt like minutes to Hadrian’s surprise and delight. Their robes swished with their steps in the dying evening light as the train slowed to a stop and all the first years were dragged along by a very tall man into river boats. Hadrian felt a dim light of anxiety in his chest as he glanced back at the train. Laney felt the discomfort and granted a small mercy.
It went on and on, Tom felt dizzy and sick as he kept reading and the pages kept scrolling on, giving basics before going into graphic detail of every injury. Burns, hit with frying pans, hit with a belt, fists, glass, starved. Tom held onto his son and husband tighter, but blocked their view of the paper as he read on.
“Welcome to the family, Hadrian. I’m glad my son found his one so easily.” Draco swept Hadrian’s long hair off his shoulder absentmindedly when Hadrian sat back down. Which Nagini seemed to take as an invitation to slither up onto Hadrian’s shoulders. His Lord stiffened, hissing.
“Erin works in the military, I take care of the kids and run a soap making business out of my home. I sell at the local farmer’s market as well, it works well because the kids play with the other children at the market while I sell. The other moms are more than happy to watch the playground for the merchants.”
Narcissa smiled, “We should do a heritage test at Gringotts today! We all could use a nice rest, we can explore Diagon Alley and make a fun day out of it. What do you think? Draco?”
Immediately upon discovering where he was Hadrian pulled out his wand and locked the door. Whipping his head around his eyes caught onto a trunk at the end of the bed. The letters
Obviously, the sight of a very bloody seven year old boy is off putting as the woman panics, pressing the baby into his gangly limbs in a rush to get a first aid kit and yelling for Laney to get some towels. It made Harry feel a muted warmth, a little fond at the concern of a woman who’s never even met him. But he was so far disassociated with the body tagged with his name he couldn’t fully comprehend it. Until a gurgle caught his attention.
Have I mentioning how frustrating and amusing it is to have a seven year old throw back you words at you. Exactly as you said them with the date and time you said them? It’s awful and funny!” Sara sighed. “I consider you kind of like a godfather anyway, I don’t really know what those are supposed to be. Not magical or religious here. But any legal godfather did nothing for my son, yet here you are… protecting him. Good enough for me.”
It should have startled him when Hadrian barely even batted an eye at stabbing his own palm and bleeding into a quill. Until he remembered that as a declared dark wizard in his culture blood rituals were very common and socially acceptable, and that his beloved looked to cook and prep things with knives. As soon as the quill was full, Hadrian’s hand-stitched itself together and the two older men snatched up the parchment to inspect as the quill flew like a mad man down many pages. Starting with a new sheet when it ran out of room. Draco quirked a brow and Hadrian tugged his hand quizzically.
She’d sat there with Annabee wailing, unresponsive to anything until her mother was frantically shaking her. She’d remained in the fog as her family panicked and rushed them back to the Manor and firmly stayed lost.
“Harry was always more sensitive than Alex, but he was also very forgiving. If he apologizes for hurting Harry and we show him how much we care he should come back around. We’re his parents.” Resolutely she continued eating. She gave birth to him. Raised him for most of his childhood. She knew him better than those women, he would forgive them. It would just time and some effort, and they would have lots of time if she homeschooled him for the rest of first year. Wait to send him back to Hogwarts until Albus got rid of that girl, resorted her son, and he settled into his rightful place in their family.
“We share a room at home so a night with my brother isn’t a punishment. I call the right side! Is it okay for me to room with my brother for a night?” Snape surveyed them critically.
“Obviously, we’re friends with Draco, Vince, and Greg. I would say we get along with pretty much everyone else. I don’t have beef with anyone in particular and Hadrian’s way too chill to really piss anyone off. As for our muggle school, not really? We had friends, but they were more school friends? Like, you hang out at school, but nowhere else? Hadrian has always been my first and best friend, more so after we adopted him.”
They were right, it was still him. His skin was still tanned, but now it seemed more natural and less like it was just Hadrian staying in the sunny restaurant all day. His hair had changed from a dark brown to a glossy black, the only flecks of color was the slight sheen of brown when the light hit his hair just right. His eyes were the most different part, they went from that vibrant green to a dark and endless blue like an ocean.
“The Potters are friends with the Weasley’s. A family who are widely considered blood traitors with no inheritance to speak of and one average income from the father. With
“Harry, it’s breakfast!” The sweet tone Lily used belied the aggressive banging at the door. “James! Calm down, give him a chance to wake up.”
Hadrian gave a low chuckle, “I can’t say I have given it much thought. I think I’d rather like Slytherin or Ravenclaw. If I were trapped with my ex-brother in a common room I think I’d be sent to Azkaban within the hour for madness and attempted murder.” The blonde laughed loud and uncontrolled for half a second.
“That’s dumb. Of course, staying hidden is better. My aunt and uncle knew what I was growing up until I got away from them. It was awful… there are good people. But terrible things happen when the wrong people know…” Draco rubbed his hands along Hadrian’s sides, he’d never seen the scars. Hadrian always stayed out of his effortless as much as possible, but that didn’t mean Draco couldn’t infer his life before he’d been taken in by his boss and given a home to reside in. His mentor hadn’t been a parent in the strictest sense. Hadrian didn’t need a parent after the trauma he’d survived. But she had given Hadrian a roof, traded work for a living wage and food on the table, gave Hadrian a culture and heritage to call home.
“Perfect. Severus, send for the twins?” A flick of his wrist sent a brilliantly white doe sprinting across the study and past the closed door. Sara was biting her lip nervously and twiddling her thumbs until the door gently creaked open and Lucius studied the new occupants of the room carefully.
Hadrian knew his mothers were only meeting with Lucius just in case, but he was also unsurprised when it turned out to be necessary.
Night had finally fallen when Hadrian felt safe to crawl out of his hiding spot. Earlier James had angrily pounded on the door when he’d ignored the call for dinner and Alex had whined at him from the door. But Lily had warded them away with soft words. She didn’t let him eat either however, saying nothing when James told the elves that he either ate with them or not at all.
Then he had to witness Hadrian popping into existence, collapsing from blood loss from a hex James shot at his own son and hemorrhaging from his core because he had to rip the family magic from his soul and blood to escape a household he’d already fought tooth and nail to escape. Magically exhausted from apperating at his young age. Images of him dropping, passing out in Mrs. Anderson’s arms, skin paper white and blood covering his gaunt frame. Hair long and gritty with grease and grime. Limp. Like a puppet without strings.
The temptation to speak back up under those eyes was so clear and so there. But the words died in his throat and he just slumped back. Making Laney sigh discontentedly. “Hadrian’s hit his word limit for now. He’s the strong silent type you see?” With a cheeky wink and a smirk, she got Draco’s furrowed brows to lighten up with at least a fond eye roll.
Soon, they were all pulled into the Slytherin Common Rooms, which were oddly enough in the dungeons. Hadrian wasn’t complaining however; the air was nice and cool. Dark and comfortable, his sister squeezed his hand. It seemed she liked it too as she admired the green and silver drapes, she mused quietly aloud.
“Draco! I thought you had school?” Draco’s face uncontrollably split into a wide smile. A feral part of his mind purred,
“Six feet under, so I wouldn’t know actually.” Narcissa coughed and Draco groaned when Hadrian just giggled.
“So, as I understand it, you’re Harry’s adoptive sister, yes?” The headmaster gave another grandfatherly smile as Laney scowled and Snape glided behind them.
That event had some other consequences as well. Laney was perfect one because of her lack of fucks to give and two,
The twins tormented his brother merrily for the rest of the month until they were in the beginnings of December. Each prank more humiliating and hilarious than the last. Until anger finally simmered down into distrust and dislike. Suspicion was also off the Dragma twins as Alex finally stopped screaming about how Laney set him up. (Dumbledore tried to back his savior up, but by the time anyone thought to check their wands it was too little too late and all that was on Laney’s prior incanteum was incendio spells).
“Why didn’t I know you? Tom said you looked like us, but I didn’t think anything of it. But you’re my little prince. My Hadrian.” The brunet was pliant as Severus held him tight, knuckles blood white from how tight he was holding Draco’s mate. Hadrian glanced at the sheet, eyes widening when he saw the words on the top, slowly, Hadrian was able to uncurl from his Uncle. Not going too far, he stayed plastered to his uncle’s side as Hadrian looked at the sheet, grabbing the stapled pages.
They were supposed to go to him and welcome him back home, but all they had found was her sister sneering at them and slamming the door in her face. The words bounced around her head and made every blood cell in her body turn to ice.
