“You have seen and fought all of that?” Mrs Granger said, fixing a wide-eyed stare on her only child.
Also as a side note some people weren't pleased with the way Harry was thinking at the end of the last chapter. I'd like to highlight that this is how Harry is thinking as the story is from his perspective. Harry has a tendency to see the best in people and be a saviour thats kind of one of the building blocks of his character. Whatever you think of my writing, I'm doing this for fun and to destress from the plague thats happening, especially as I'm high risk. I don't need any more negativity right now please remember that when commenting. if your genuinely enjoying it though and are being nice I'm sorry for making you read this aggy little message. love to you all XX
“Merlin, sorry I know you probably don’t want to talk about this” Harry said quickly, sounding tired.
Mr and Mrs Granger sheared a quick look before nodding and taking the two chairs facing the garden.
“Well Dad” Hermione said after a short pause, looking up at Mr Granger, a defiant set to her jaw.
At that moment Ron came in through the living room door, maroon Weasley jumper clashing spectacularly with his red hair, which was dripping slightly from the shower.
Reporters from every newspaper in the wizarding world seemed to be trying to get their exclusive with Harry at the same time. It had been like this since the start of the trials but today was even worse, one unlucky wizard in a maroon deerstalker was pushed so hard from behind he fell head first onto the lifts floor, he wasn’t even given the chance to stand up as three other journalists climbed on top of him in order to ask their questions.
“Mr Potter! Did she deserve such a light sentence?”
“There’s something I need to say” Ron continued, looking determinedly back at the Grangers.
“I think you mean
“Here goes nothing,” Ron whispered to Harry through the corner of his mouth, trying and failing to hide his nerves at seeing Hermione again. Harry could understand Ron’s anxiety, whilst the two had left things in a very strong place before she left to find her parents, they hadn’t had much time to actually find their feet as a couple before they were separated again. This had left Ron fretting about how they would get on once they were back in the same hemisphere. These were not a set of fears Harry sheared; he had never seen two people he felt fitted each other more. Yes they pecked and quarreled, but they even seemed to do that together. Harry had secretly suspected that the two harbored more than a school kid crush for each other for a couple of years now and he was just glad that they had finally realized the depth of their feelings. Seeing the way the two had supported each other in the first days after the final battle had given Harry hope for the future, a hope he had sorely needed at the time and quite often still did.
“I think it’ll be a lot worse for her than that Ron. Greyback won’t move cell for the full moon after all.” A rather scary gleam had appeared in Hermione’s eyes at this.
Three days after Hermione had arrived home, Harry was sitting at the Weasley’s kitchen table. A large, sweet mug of tea in front of him and the promising scent of fried sausages wafting over from the arga, where Mrs Weasley stood making breakfast.
However much Mrs Weasley under appreciated Ron’s choice of words, they did break the oppressive quiet that had briefly consumed the kitchen.
“You might be right Ron, but I don’t think he thought He Who Must Not Be Named was as amazing as he’d expected after actually meeting him. Besides many people are bullies in school, that doesn’t mean they deserve to be imprisoned for acts they did out of fear, or to protect themselves.”
“Well I think it’s about time the trials started” Hermione said “The Ministry really needs to get a move on or else half the Death Eaters will have been held without sentence for longer than the legal limit”
The small woman looked directly at her daughter “Hermione, you truly are so amazing. I don’t know where this gift came from, but I am so glad you received it.”
It took Harry a moment to figure out what Hermione had done. But as the large French Doors started to shimmer and swirl he realised with horror that Hermione was somehow using the glass as a form of flat-screen Pensieve.
Turning his giant brown eyes onto Harry, Teddy gurgled and spat little bubbles at him as he grabbed at his fingers. As Teddy looked up at Harry, his eyes lightened shifting from the dark brown that resembled his grandmothers to that of Harry’s own bottle green. There was a moment though, as the young Lupin’s eyes lightened from chocolate to emerald that pinned Harry to the spot. For the briefest of instants Remus Lupin’s soft hazel gaze was staring up at him, seeming to see too much and question everything. The next second he was gone and Teddy was grinning wonkily up with that special love that only infants really have. Harry took a shaky breath still astounded that a child who looked different every twenty seconds could, so often, look so much like his dead parents.
He was pulled from his thoughts by a great clattering and banging as a whole parliament of owls flew in through the kitchen window. Suddenly there were feathers flying, birds hooting and several people crying out in shock.
“I can’t tell you,” Hermione said again, looking imploringly at her parents. “You wouldn’t understand.” Pushing Ron’s hand away she took a step towards them.
“DEPULSO!!!” a bluish white wave of energy shot through the compartment pushing the reporters out with an unnaturally strong force. The lift doors shut and Hermione quickly lowered her wand, darting forwards to press the number three button on the wall.
“Stop!” Ron said, making Harry jump, he wasn’t sure he could cope with any more surprises today.
“So you are right there was a radical group called the Death Eaters, they were lead by a very powerful Dark Wizard named Lord Voldemort. Their mission statement was to wipe out anyone with magic who wasn’t born with at least one magical family member. Not only that, they considered themselves superior to all other life on the planet whether that was magical or not. I believe they would’ve continued fighting until they ruled the world and quite probably until they were the only ones left. They considered anything that didn’t have magic to be filthy and worthy of destruction. The war started in an attempt to stop them, but mostly it was just a fight to survive.”
Harry was by far not the only volunteer helping to straighten out the mistakes of that sadistic regime, but he was attempting to use the sway he had gained in the wizarding world to make sure the corruption that had wormed into the ministry in the years before the war was ripped out and wouldn’t find a foot hold again. He’d had several long discussions with Kingsley, who had just been named the official Minister for Magic, about how the Ministry’s downfall had only hastened and enhanced the suffering that had occurred. How more measures should be put into place to stop those in power abusing their influence for their own gain rather than the gain of the government and the country.
. You say that it was dangerous and quite frankly that is obvious from the multitude of scars I can count on all three of you from here. I would like to know why three teenagers took it upon themselves to rid the country of this
“Cup of tea dear?” Andromeda asked from the Kitchen.
“Harry, no!” Hermione said. “I don’t want them to! What happened… Please it will only scare them.”
“The Defence” Nyxia replied as she raising her chin to the Gamot “Pleads Guilty on all charges your honour’s.”
“I understand” Mr Granger said turning to look at her.
“Harry James Potter” Harry intoned, watching the ball intently.
"Alright then, well lets get on with this. Miss Granger if you would like to go next?” said Ramshorn.
Mr Weasley… Arthur, Harry corrected himself, beamed at him across the table before looking back down at his pile of papers a frown instantly crossing his face as he started reading again.
“Oh sorry, how silly of me!” Hermione said sounding rather strained all of a sudden. “Mum, Dad, You remember Ron and Harry don’t you?”
“Believe me I know” Harry grumpily moved his queen out of the way of Deans oncoming rook. “Malfoy picked the wrong side and needs to pay for what’s happened. He hurt people, almost killed Ron, then there’s the night on the astronomy tower. He was a prat all through school and then went and joined a bloody death cult, I shouldn’t even care what happens to him.” Harry sighed, running his hands over his face in frustration. “But the way those guards were talking about him… no one should be treated like that, it’s not what we fought for!” Harry realised that he’d stood up at some point. He quickly sat down, trying not to wake Ron in the process.
“This is Mr and Mrs Granger” Harry said quickly turning to the couple in an attempt to get the attention away from himself. “This is their home. And I’m sure you recognize Ron and Hermione.”
“But” Dean continued, before glancing into the unlit hearth. “I don’t think he wanted to be a Death Eater.”
“Still” she said with a small smile “You have yet to lead us too far astray… If you believe my nephew is worth giving a second chance then he probably is.”
“Your right of course, but Lions aren’t usually capable of killing eight men from forty feet away by burping. Wings and fire tend to make people a little more antsy.” Chuckling Andromeda put the book back down and reached over for Teddy. “Right come hear you great lump! Nanny Andy needs to give you some lunch.”
“Ronald please” Mr Weasley said sharply before turning to Harry with a small frown. “ He’s right Harry, you are looking a little under the weather. Can I get you anything?”
Looking up Harry found Andromeda eyeing him, a small frown between her fine brows “Are you going to their trials?” she asked softly.
A cold hard edge appeared in Mrs Granger’s eyes. “Then go”. It was such a quiet phrase, but everyone in the room heard it as if it had been shouted in their face.
“Here, let me” he said. Waving his wand in a short curve he neatly vanished the offending mass.
“Well there you go Mr Granger, Mrs Granger, thank you for your understanding, the ministry apologizes for the time we’ve taken out of your day, especially as I’m sure you’d rather be spending it catching up with your daughter. Now we really must be off. Mr Potter it’s been an honor” Ramshorn said all this in the same brisk manner she had held throughout the rest of the morning, but when she turned to Harry there was a light shining in her eyes that gave away just how much she meant her last statement.
Harry took a second to digest this; Hermione obviously didn’t want her parents to know the intricacies of the war and that was her choice, but Harry now had to come up with something to say that would appease the Grangers curiosity yet not cross the line his friend wanted hidden. Not to mention Harry felt decidedly uncomfortable lying to these people he barely knew about the dangers their daughter had put herself through, mostly for his own sake, during the war. He decided to go for the bones of the truth and hope he was making the right decision.
Harry tiptoed past them and into the Kitchen to find Mr Weasley and Percy already at the table, two steaming mugs of tea in front of them.
Following the Directions on a large flashing sign Harry and Ron made their way to the Arrivals area, Hermione’s Flight should be disembarking now, which only gave them a few minutes to find the right door and meet her and her parents.
Hermione had to physically bat away a large grey bird that was attempting to land on her head, presumably mistaking her bushy brown hair for a nest. Crookshanks jumped at it hissing and arching his back before leaving in search of a calmer place to knap.
He was right. The scenes only got more graphic, more painful.
“So, you’ve been lying to us since you were fifteen” he said in an emotionless voice.
“A guard or two taken justice into their own hands no doubt” Hermione replied her mouth twisted in distaste. “I’ve already talked to Kingsley about prisoner treatment, but unless the inmate makes a formal complaint it’s being entirely over looked.”
is quite frankly a breath of fresh air for most people.” he looked rather serious all of a sudden. “Now I’m off to work, I have a few things I need to get done before the Minister arrives. Coming Dad?” Percy got up and started hunting for his cloak whilst Mr Weasley filed his papers into a rather battered brown leather briefcase.
“Bill” Mrs Granger warned, laying a hand on her husbands arm and avoiding looking at the way her daughter blanched at her father’s jibe. “You’ve both grown a lot since we last saw you, although that has to be a couple of years now doesn’t it?” she said in a soft sweet sounding voice. Her eyes lingered a little longer on Ron than they had on Harry as she gave them a slightly nervous smile.
“Harry!” she called, rushing out to give him a huge hug and covering him in flour. “It’s so good to see you dear, come on in. I’m just making a banana bread”
Ron helped Harry out of the lift and into the surprisingly run of the mill corridor. Whilst most of the Ministry Harry had seen before held some kind of magical or at least eccentric feel, this corridor seamed nothing more than a rather nice, if slightly old-fashioned office block. Ron led Harry and Hermione down the stretch of parquet flooring and cream walls until they reached a large wooden door with a plaque on indicating that this was Mr Weasley’s new office.
Mrs Tonks lived in the most muggle house Harry had ever seen a witch or wizard own. Pale Cream walls and French Blue curtains were certainly a better taste than the Dursley’s choices of Magnolia and Fuchsia, but apart from the moving pictures on the walls Harry thought even Aunt Petunia would of approved of the simple lines and elegant features.
As if to demonstrate this exact point Percy smirked, humour lighting up behind his eyes “Your in the news again this morning, its quite heroic” he said as he raised an eyebrow at Harry.
Harry realized rather quickly that this was not going to be an easy journey. He took a breath, bracing himself for a long interrogation before he opened his mouth.
Hermione’s home was far tidier than the Burrow ever was, but it did not shear the spartan, clinical feeling that presided over Privet Drive. Instead a comfortable quiet atmosphere seemed to pervade the rooms. Books seemed to line nearly every wall and soft lamps lit up antique furniture. The most notable difference from any other Muggle home Harry had ever seen was the apparent lack of a television. Harry didn’t think he’d ever met anyone that had grown up in the Muggle world who didn’t own one, but now he came to think of it, not once could he recall Hermione ever mentioning a favourite TV program. The only thing she ever really talked about enjoying outside of spending time with friends was books.
Harry’s days were long and hard. He spent most of them helping Mrs Weasley around the house, cleaning and gardening, at this point the garden had been de-gnomed so many times that the gnomes were starting to only come out at night. This had lead to several midnight de-gnoming sessions that had only been put to a stop when a miss thrown gnome had flown straight through Mr and Mrs Weasleys open bedroom window. The senior Weasleys had been woken up rather abruptly when said gnome had landed firmly on their bed and preceded to cause havoc and quite a lot of damage. It had taken nearly two hours to get the gnome back outside and had caused Mrs Weasley to ban all outdoor activities after the sun had gone down.
Hermione stepped up to Gobhar taking the Simularéé from him whilst plucking a long curly brown hair from her head. After Hermione went Ron and then Mr and Mrs Granger respectively.
He wasn’t the only person at the table. It had become a common sight to see many of the Burrows guests drag themselves to the kitchen early of a morning, all in search of strong caffeine and hot food. None of them ever asked about the dark circles under each other’s eyes or the slight shake of someone’s hand as they bought their first cup to their lips. They didn’t need to ask; after all they knew what answers they would receive.
Harry smiled apologetically, wiggling his fingers at Teddy. He still felt very awkward referring to adults so informally. Other adults, he corrected himself. The Dursley’s had been very strict about how he talked to adults growing up, first names were for equals and friends, he was neither, if he had to speak at all he should at least be respectful. Uncle Vernon had always been very clear on that.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It is the intention of the Prosecution to argue that the accused, one Draco Malfoy, has, over the course of the past years, knowingly and wilfully aided in the rise and regime of He Who Must Not Be Named. The accused stands to be charged with the crimes of performing multiple restricted acts of magic including those of the Unforgivables, Cruciatus and Imperius Of performing and participating in acts of hate speech and brutality. Of the imprisonment of the persons of Olivander, Thomas, Lovegood and… others” at this Rapwinder paused with a smirk. By others it was clear he was referring to the Goblin Griphook. Clearly Rapwinder did not consider the internment of Goblins more than a unlawful inconvenience.
He still didn’t like the fact he had so much political power, it felt wrong to him that he could make a casual comment to someone in an office and it could affect the very way laws were carried out or how people’s lives were lived. If he was honest it sacred him and he didn’t want it, but if he could use it to stop people like Umbridge or Fudge from hurting people or to prevent miscarriages of justice like had happened to Sirius from happening again, then he could swallow his discomfort for a while.
Humming softly Andromeda took the bottle from the air, tested it on her wrist and started feeding Teddy. As soon as the bottle was within his grasp Teddy latched onto it with a single-minded determination.
*   *   *
“Quite” Mr Granger added taking a shaky breath in before continuing. “Now, time is getting on and you are expected at Ron’s. Go on with you, but Hermione, come back soon love, wont you?”
“I completely agree Ron, such an odious woman” Hermione replied. “Still I had a little word with Kingsley on our way out of the court room. Apparently Greyback’s trial should finish tomorrow, he’s got life obviously. Anyway Kingsley hinted that the only cell able to hold him was the one right opposite Umbridge’s.
Harry felt his chest tightening; he and his friends were quite literally trapped in this very small box. The lift wobbled as eight reporters tried to step in, cramming Harry right back into the corner. The lift surly couldn’t hold this many people Harry thought. The cable would snap under the strain, come to think of it Harry wasn’t even sure the ministry lifts had cables, were he and his friends suspended above some unknowable drop by nothing more than a charm of some sort. Could the enchantment hold out with so many people trying its limits? There were too many people jostling Harry. He didn’t have enough space, he couldn’t breath and his vision was starting to go hazy. He couldn’t see, his whole body felt ridged, like he’d been put in a full body bind and no matter how he tried to move to get himself to safety to find his way out he couldn’t.
“You’re going to Narcissa’s trial?” Harry asked a little shocked that she would even want to see her sister after all that had happened between them.
Finally the Auror turned to Mr and Mrs Granger, looking them over with a keen eye. “Mr and Mrs Granger, hello. I’m sure Mr Potter has informed you as to why we are here today. It’s nothing more than a few security measures, to ensure your safety you understand. You may be rest assured that once these last tests have been completed, you will be able to go home in the knowledge that you will both be as safe as two lambs on a wool farm.”
Conjuring a glass and filling it with a quick ‘Aquamenti’ Harry took a few calming sips of water, Harry closed his eyes leaning his head back against the wall behind him.
“I’m really sorry about that Mrs Granger” Ron said looking at Hermione’s mother in extreme embarrassment.
“Should of got life the cow,” Ron said.
“Sorry mate” Ron said, “ you ok? You still look like shit.”
“Did you know Malfoy’s being held at The Ministry?”
“So dear, what have you been up to this week? Any exciting news for me?” Andromeda asked.
“Yes thank you Mr Weasley” Harry lied “did you?”
“So what happens now?” Mr Granger asked the group at large. “Hermione said something about needing to take some protective measures on the way home? I hope those radicals we were told about are gone?”
Harry wanted to pull his eyes away from the glass, to look anywhere else, knowing that the images to come would only get worse. Yet he couldn’t, his eyes were glued to the doors as if seeing the images again proved to him that they had happened, that they were more than the nightmares that flooded his head at night.
“Oh its all about how you are single handedly paying for the remembrance statue at Hogwarts, what a great and noble deed it is, the amount of money your putting into the restorations and how Hogwarts would never open again if it wasn’t for your direct influence, its all rather splendid. Although I personally preferred the one with the photo of you and Ron looking at condemns in that Muggle shop, I’ve never seen Mum’s face go quite that shade of beetroot before”.
They all got out of the car into the bright July morning. Looking around Harry saw a very pretty street with a green at one end and lots of trees lining each side of the road. Old-fashioned lampposts dotted the pavement and there were several shiny cars parked on the road next to what was unmistakably an old village pub.  It was definitely a Muggle road in a Muggle area, but it didn’t have the uptight, boring feel Harry had come to expect from Muggle communities. Then again Harry thought, most of what he considered ‘Muggle’ was actually just ‘Dursley’ and ‘Privet Drive’, there were many more types of Muggles out there just like there were many types of Wizards.
“Draco Malfoy has been a bigoted twat since the day we started Hogwarts.” Dean said flatly.
“Ron, please you don’t have to” Hermione said, laying her hand on his arm.
The room was silent as everyone read their letters.
“Maybe it would be best if we showed you” Hermione chipped in. “Do you mind?”
“And what exactly are these tests may I ask?” Mr Granger asked looking seriously at the women. “I hope they won’t take long, I don’t want to have to book into a hotel for the night if I can avoid it, I’ve spent too long away from my own bed already” He glanced quickly in Hermione’s direction before looking back at Ramshorn. It was only a slight flicker of the eyes, but his implication had been implicit. Ron slid his hand into Hermione’s giving it a gentle squeeze.
“Oh I’m afraid I spent most of the night going over this report, it’s a real mess you know. Over half the significant Muggle buildings in the London area alone have had some hex or curse placed on them. Most of them are quite minor, like making all the trains in and out of London run exactly twenty-three minutes late, But you never know when your going to run into something really dangerous. I almost lost two men yesterday when an
Outside on the street the three looked around at each other, Harry couldn’t quite believe how much had happened since they had entered the Grangers home that morning. The day was almost over, eaten away by the long conversations and reconciliations that had taken place. Harry was exhausted, and he couldn’t imagine how Hermione felt.
Another flick of Hermione’s wrist and the lamp was back to its original form. No one would have known anything strange, or beautiful had ever happened to it.
“I started lying to you at the end of fourth year…” Hermione said. She told them about how Voldemort had returned and why. She explained that she had kept it secret because she’d thought if her parents had known, they might of pulled her from Hogwarts in an attempt to keep her safe. How the thought of being banned from the world she loved and the people she cared for had kept her awake at night. How she had realized that if they had, it would of all been for naught anyway. The death eaters would still come for people like her and she wouldn’t be able to hide or defend herself on a fouth year’s education.
“Your absolutely terrifying. I’ve told you that, right?” Ron replied fixing his girlfriend with a stare that was half fear half awe.
Harry still hadn’t told Ron and Hermione the extent of his abuse at the hands of the Dursleys and he didn’t think he ever would, but ever since Ron had found Harry locked in his room with bars on his windows just before the start of second year Ron had had suspicions about how deep their neglect of Harry really went. He never asked, but it was obvious whenever Harry’s biological family came up that he was harboring a lot of anger towards his best friends kin.
“Yes?” Hermione said, whipping round to look at her farther. If it weren’t for how her hands shook before she clenched them into fists Harry would have had a hard time seeing just how scared Hermione really was.
Four heads whipped round to face the Granger patriarch. Hermione and Mrs Granger wearing the exact same look of surprise, their eyebrows almost blending with their hairline.
Ron finished his outburst standing squarely in front of Mr Granger, his chin jutted forwards and his eyes bulging ever so slightly.
With a tiny flick of her wrist the top of the bag sprung open. Harry watched as what must have been everything the Grangers owned poured out of the bag. Pots and pans flew out one at a time, heading straight for the kitchen. Bedding and mattresses headed up the stairs and out of sight, followed shortly after by a couple of bedframes and several very delicate looking Tiffany lamps. Ron was forced to dive out of the way of a dining table making it’s way through to the conservatory. A line of chairs following it like ducklings following their mother to the nearest pond. Last were a sofa and matching chair that squeezed out of the impossibly small hole in the top of the bag. Settling themselves down on the red paisley patterned carpet with a gentle thump.
“Harry Potter you are far too kind and by far too stupid for your own good. You always seem to look for the light in whomever your path crosses, whether that be for your benefit or not. It’s reckless and dangerous and quite frankly far too admirable in my book.”
Harry just smiled, deciding he would have to introduce Ron to the rather impressive record collection he’d found hidden under the floorboards in Sirius’ old room at Grimmauld Place.
“No Harry, I’m almost certain it’s an
“Ronald Billius Weasley!” Mrs Weasley scolded “I have told you before, if you keep using that language in this house I shall scourgify your tongue!”
“Stop” he said again. “I can’t let you do this Hermione. If they have to know… I’m sorry, but if you’re not going to tell them… I will.”
“Brilliant!” Ron crowed. “It’ll be the centaurs all over again.”
“Just because your using Ron’s pieces doesn’t mean your going to win you know” Dean said, raising his eyebrow at Harry.
“WAIT!” Mr Granger shouted. All three teens stoped dead in their tracks.
Harry rolled over and got up; reaching to the top of the cupboard where he had left his jeans and rummaged through the open duffel bag he was keeping the rest of his clothes in to find a T-shirt. Pulling on an old, very faded red Quidditch jersey Harry headed down stairs.
Harry took a second to digest all this. So at least he wasn’t going mad. Malfoy didn’t deserve the brush he was being tarred with. He still deserved to pay for his crimes though… right? Knowing Malfoy had been forced into the decisions he’d made was tragic, but he’d still made them after all. He had done awful things, made stupid decisions, hurt people and changed lives for the worse. Harry shouldn’t care what was happening to him now; it wasn’t even Harry’s responsibility anyway. As Dean had said he’d done his bit.
“Oh the usual you know, mostly eating and sleeping. We started a new book this week, didn’t we Teddy?” Andromeda said picking up a large purple book with a picture of a dragon on the front and wiggling it in front of Teddy’s face.
“Well, yeah” Ron replied, deflating slightly.
This ones a long one, hope you like it... Please send Dean your love he makes me cry.
“It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that me and Hermione have become a thing. I mean the way she said hi at the ‘arrowport’ was pretty damn obvious wasn’t it.” Ron gave Mr and Mrs Granger a look that suggested they’d be daft not to have figured it out.
It was the last day of Umbridge’s trial. She’d got twenty-five years in Azkaban with chance of parole after eighteen.
Just then three bushy headed figures emerged through arrivals door number three, cutting any discussions about the merits of Muggle verses Wizard composition off in its tracks.
When he wasn’t doing housework however Harry spent his days at the ministry. He mostly helped by meeting with grieving families, consoling them. Or else he was trying to sort through the mess that had been the blood-purity trials, releasing those unjustly sentenced to Azkaban, finding those who were still in hiding to tell them the danger had passed, or trying to make emends to the families of those who had not been lucky enough to survive the atrocities of Voldemort’s puppet government.
Harry walked across the road and through the small gate next to the black rubbish bins. The gentle brush of the house’s wards as they recognised him the only sign that anyone other than muggles lived at this unassuming home.
Hermione reached out her wand, sweeping the memories of the worst moments of her life back up and replacing them in her head.
Mrs Granger soon went to make some tea, stepping over Ron’s small pile of sick on the kitchen floor. She headed towards the sink picking up a cloth to clean up the mess when Ron jumped to his feet.
“I’m sorry Hermione, I grew up without my parents, I know what its like to live without them and I can’t watch you throw yours away.”
“I’ve been called as a character witness, although what help I’ll be I don’t know. I haven’t so much as spoken to her since I was eighteen.”
“Come on ‘Mione what’s going to happen if they are? Its not like the Ministry’s going to let them all go, then ask them all to be back in a weeks time for their trials is it!” Ron said.
“You found her again didn’t you?” he said, his face still utterly devoid of expression. “You went back and fought through all those horrible things?”
“Ok so the main problem we’re facing is that we have no idea what kind of curses, if any, have been placed on the property. We haven’t found any but there is still a chance some have been hidden from normal methods of detection. Now curses of that kind are usually attuned to activate only in the presence of certain people and as the five of you are the most likely to be the targets of the spells in question, we have to check to make sure your not going to set something off the second you enter the building. Obviously, we can’t have the Golden Trio or their family walking straight into a potentially lethal trap now can we! The paperwork for exploding the savior of the Wizarding world would be quite lengthy let me tell you!” The man let out a short breathy laugh that was so forced it hurt to listen to. “So that is where this comes in.”
Becoming a Godfather was a daunting prospect for Harry. He knew next to nothing about children and knew even less about how to help them through life. He was barely eighteen for Circe’s sake. Still he was determined to be there for Teddy in any way he could.
Standing outside the arrivals door waiting for Hermione, Ron looked around with a small frown creasing his forehead. “Harry?” he asked, staring openly at a teenage girl only a year or two younger than the two boys. “Harry? Why are half the Muggle kids wearing earmuffs? It’s the middle of summer!”
“You can bet Lucius is already spilling every secret in his gut just for the chance to not get kissed” Neville said with a sour expression.
Mr Granger’s lips thinned as he watch Hermione put her hand over her right arm, covering the scar left by Bellatrix after their imprisonment at Malfoy Manor.
tried to drop them twelve stories in a banking tower on Wolf Street”.
Avicultus Rapwinder unfolded himself from his seat on the lowest row of benches before turning to face the Wizengamot and those called in as witnesses. A thin curved smile formed on his lips before he addressed the court. “Minister, High Mugwumps, members of the Gamot.” He said in a thin sticky voice that was quiet but still audible from the backbenches where Harry and his friends were sitting. It had the effect of making the listener lean forward so as to not miss what was being said. Suddenly Harry was reminded of a rather large spider pulling at its web, inching a trapped fly closer and closer to its demise. Rapwinder Harry decided was not a man who would play any kind of fair game if a dirty one were available.
When Harry got back to Gryffindor Tower late that night after a long flying session, he found Ron in front of the fire, looking moody. He felt a bit affronted: usually he was the one doing that. In fact, he’d planned to do it tonight, but Ron was usurping his spot.
the fracas was not currently Draco's biggest concern. No, he was worried about how to get
“Here’s a scroll of things I’d like you to file and keep track of, and I’d like a dossier on Harry Potter’s love life as soon as possible,” Draco told him, tossing the scroll onto the table.
He knelt beside Blaise to make sure he was unhurt, which he was, and that the Petrificus would hold, which it appeared it would. Potter was a nuisance but damn if he wasn’t a powerful wizard. Those two things might actually be codependent, come to think of it.
“And seeing as I’m the one whose arse is about to be whipped if I don’t get this information to Dumbledore, I really don’t give a damn,” Draco said. He tried to stand, put his weight wrong, and crumpled to the ground.
He hated Malfoy—always had. But in the dream, he hadn’t, and even though that’d been Amortentia-induced, kissing Malfoy, touching him had felt good, right somehow, and his cock appeared to feel the same.
Granger smacked him again but a little more lightly than last time. He began to wonder whether she was a dominatrix and squeezed his thighs tight together to protect the family jewels. The Malfoy line would not die with Draco.
He collapsed onto his bed and tried very hard not to regret his entire life because that would mean regretting that one beautiful night with Cho Chang and Terry Boot in fifth year when all the other Ravenclaws were out...in the library or stargazing or whatever the hell Ravenclaws did. There was really no need for them to exist in the first place, since Slytherins were generally much smarter and more effective with the knowledge they did have. But that one night had justified the existence of the entire house. Draco considered that he might have a kink for the color blue.
“No, not now, my boy,” said Dumbledore, twinkling at him. “We will need a safe environment with plenty of protective spells and a few trusted members of the Order, just to ensure that nothing can go wrong. We should be able to do it by the end of this week. I will arrange a time. But not a word to anyone about this, at least until then.”
Tears were coming to his eyes now. He let one fall, then another. Theo and Pansy came closer to him and he held them.
Draco grinned, just a little. Pansy was all too used to being underestimated. He had no doubt she’d beg, borrow, and steal her way into high-level intelligence meetings.
“Er,” Harry said as they were approaching the portrait. “Ron, you’ve got something on your face.”
“So I thought you might like to become one of my minions,” Draco said, putting his feet up on one of Boot’s stacks of books and watching him cringe. “Good hours—mostly night work—pays in whatever you like, and being connected with me means being connected to the Malfoy name, which means jobs, money, fame, prestige, connections with the Dark Lord if you like—”
“What do you want, Potter?” Malfoy asked.
. He mustn’t revert to his normal state of evasion and division, forking tongues and paths. He had to do this. His life—and Theo’s, and Pansy’s, and so many others’—depended on it.
“As do I, Mr. Nott,” Dumbledore allowed. “I merely question what your proposition is to me that you would list these as your demands.”
“I don’t need to know that,” Harry said, wincing. “And before you ask, I won’t tell Hermione. I just wanted to make sure you were doing alright and she wasn’t going to break your heart or anything.”
He was so engaged in all this thinking that he almost didn’t notice Potter’s cauldron exploding in Potions and boils erupting all over his face. Snape gave Potter a look of outright loathing, which wasn’t new.
“Don’t ask...don’t ask...don’t ask…” Boot was muttering to himself.
The four of them went through the house, which, in Harry’s mind, still reeked of Sirius—the kitchen table where they’d laughed together, the sofa where they’d battled doxies, the staircase where he’d introduced Kreacher. They passed the tapestry room and he swallowed hard, thinking of Sirius’s face burned out of the wall by his own family, just as he’d been killed by his own cousin.
Theo’s mouth was very small. “No one,” he said. “Contrary to popular belief, I can think for myself, thanks.”
“Yes,” Draco said, stretching up until his hands nearly brushed the ceiling. “Yes, Pans, I think it was.”
“I’m watching you,” Harry said.
“Nothing’s for sure yet, and I wanted to wait until we had all the information.” Nott reached out to her, and she cast a glance at Harry and went a bit pink before she joined him, leaning into his shoulder and neatening the edges of the quill she’d salvaged from the floor.

Hello everyone! Another chapter is here. Thanks so much for kudos and bookmarks; as this is my first fic on here I really appreciate it, and I hope you continue to enjoy! I have about four more chapters written already so will continue to post on Thursday nights for at least the next few weeks! Enjoy. Please.
“Oh, Harry, it’s just you,” he said. “How are you, mate?”
“Hey! You can’t do that! Give them back!” Draco said. “Five points to Slytherin!”
“Slytherins reward generously, and punish vigorously,” Draco said, wiggling his eyebrows. “Fail me, Boot, and you just might find
“His father tried to kill Ginny.”
“This is quite the list, Mr. Malfoy,” Dumbledore said, looking over his half-moon glasses at the three Slytherins before him. Draco had Conjured three chairs for them and taken the imposing green armchair in the center, dropping into it with an elegant ease that belied his hammering heart. This meeting was a play, and each of them had their role.
“Look, here—” He pulled his wand from his robes and held it up to Potter’s face.
“Do you want to see my vulva, you absolute fucking–”
“Would you just hold still?” Draco said, and did his best fringe charm, the one that always got his hair hanging stylishly over his forehead but never in his eyes.
Wiping his mouth with his napkin, Draco followed Blaise as he left the Great Hall. The two of them slunk in near-unison out of the room, whereupon Blaise turned to Draco, his brow furrowed.
“Fantastic, thanks,” Draco said, crawling past Pansy and Ron Weasley, who were circling each other in ever-tighter spirals, wands drawn, but neither of them appeared to have cast a spell. They seemed to be muttering threats at each other in...weird voices.
“Let’s never speak of this again.”
Harry turned to Corner. “So, Michael—how’s the Chaser game this year?”
Inside the room, which he couldn’t see very well, his peripheral vision blurred, was a huge ivory stand. Draco made his way closer, whispering voices making the hair on the back of his neck stand up, and stood on tiptoe to see the top of it. Resting there, in a velvet-and-satin case, was a tiara—no, a diadem, with a huge sapphire glittering from its center. Draco reached out to touch it—
“Ron’s right Harry, we would never of let you go and do the things we had to last year alone. It was our own choice and you need to stop taking the responsibility for it”. The last sentence Hermione directed right at her parents. It seemed that she wasn’t going to allow him to take responsibility for this either.
“Fucking hell!” Ron nearly shouted almost falling to the floor as a jumbo jet flew only a hundred feet or so over the glass ceiling. “That things almost as big as a full grown Ridgeback Harry” he said looking rather alarmed.
“Yes” Hermione said quietly looking down at her feet.
The funerals were over now, there were no more memories to be sheared, no more stories to be told only corpses rotting in the dirt and grief stricken families left to carry on the lives that could have been filled with so many others.
He looked around; everyone was staring at him now. The looks ranged from pure shock on the faces of Ron and Hermione to down right venom on from Mrs Granger.
“Bloody Paps, how we gonna find a way round them Mione? That ways a fuckin’ slaughter waiting to happen.” Ron glanced over at Hermione scribbling on a piece of parchment.
It was Ron who broke the silence. “Well, Merlin’s saggy damp scrotum”
“You really should be more careful Mrs Tonks, just because the war’s over doesn’t mean it’s entirely safe yet. They still haven’t caught all the Death Eaters.”
“Ok” Harry said. “Why don’t we start with what you know and work out from there?” he asked looking between the two older Grangers, hoping one of them would offer him a good place to start.
Lights flashed, bright and cold. Human bodies jostled Harry, crowding in on him.
“Andy is fine dear. Please, I don’t like to repeat myself.” Andromeda said with a smile, reminding him of her request from their last meeting. She gently patted his cheek as she made her way around the Kitchen island with the kettle, filling it with water before placing it on the hob.
She turned sharply towards the door “Ok well if that’s everything, Ron, Harry and I are expected at the Burrow”.  Hermione started walking very quickly towards the door obviously eager to leave in a hurry.
“If you’d only warned us!” Mr Granger shouted back, his face looked almost panicked now, it was quite obvious he’d never seen his daughter quite this angry. If Harry was honest neither had he.
“Ron? Oh hello Harry, Hermione, what are you three doing here? Is something the matter”? Mr Weasley looked momentarily alarmed; people were still very quick to fear the worst so soon after the war. Harry couldn’t blame them really, who could. After all they had all spent the last year in constant fear that disaster was only moments away.
“Our daughter didn’t tell us she had a large part in it all, only that it wasn’t safe and that they were hunting people like her. People with magic born to those without any like us.” Mr Granger said stiffly not looking at Hermione as he said this.
Harry however was going to make damn sure that life turned out better for Teddy than it had for him. Not that he had to work that much, Teddy was already in a home that loved and wanted him. All Harry had to do was keep that world safe for him.
Harry stared at her for a moment more than a little impressed that she could find it in herself to still wish her sister well after all this time.
“Yes please Mrs Tonks” Harry replied, picking Teddy up and making his way through into the Kitchen.
“And what would you want me to do Dad?” Hermione shouted, standing up from the sofa. Her body almost vibrating with suppressed rage.
“Harry mate! Wake up, your having another nightmare” Ron said with a worried expression as he looked down his long nose at Harry, his hands still holding Harry down.
Harry and Ron appeared behind a large notice board advertising a new Children’s book by an up and coming author. They were standing just outside Heathrow airport’s main entrance. Ron looked around in wide-eyed amazement at the gigantic building before them. He wore an expression of shocked awe that only grew as they entered the cavernous space. Grey paneled walls rose up to high metallic arches and large glass windows. The number of Muggles milling about was quite a shock to Harry after the months he had spent solely in the company of wizards. Not to mention the fact he was still getting used to large crowds after his time on the run with only his two best friends for company.
“The Court is called to assemble on today the twenty-sixth of August to bring to trial one Draco Lucius Malfoy. Presiding, Kingsley Shacklebolt, Minister for Magic. Curtis Colmbright, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Percy Weasley, Senior Under Secretary to the Minister. Mildred Marydew acting as Court Scrivener. Taking the position of Prosecution Avicultus Rapwinder and in that of Defence, Nyxia Greengrass.” Kingsley sat on the high bench next to Percy and a rather thin man with a large forehead and very bushy eyebrows.
Harry picked up Ron’s bishop. Moving three places over, he took a pawn that he’d placed down himself only thirty seconds before.
“I confiscated them off a fourth year, on the train home at the end of sixth year. I didn’t know what to do with them, so I left them here.” She said with a slightly bossy tone to her voice, although Harry couldn’t help noticing her cheeks had gone just a tiny bit pinker than usual and she was definitely not making eye contact with anyone.
Judging by the wide-eyed expression on Andromeda’s face he was not the only one. After a moment’s silence she tread softly over to the table carrying both cups of tea. Placing them down carefully she struck Harry with a piercing gaze “I see, may I ask why?” she asked. The mirth and joy that often lit her eyes entirely absent. Instead replaced by a wary curiosity.
Harry paused to look at Hermione, checking that he hadn’t said to much.
“I’ve spent the whole week stuck in the trial rooms,” Harry answered running his fingers through his hair. “Umbridge got put away yesterday.”
*   *   *
“Ok” Harry pressed on. “When I was at the Ministry today I heard these guards coming off shift. They were talking about Malfoy. Apparently he’s not doing well in custardy. I know he should be there. He needs to answer for his crimes but honestly Dean the way they were talking about him, it was inhumane.”
“I must admit I’m amazed after everything you all saw, all those horrible things… I can’t quite understand why any of you would still want to use magic at all” She carried on, still staring at the wand held in Ron’s hand.
The rest of the car journey was completed in silence, Mr Granger looking stonily out of the window whilst Mrs Granger became inordinately interested in a small hole that had formed in the pocket of her cardigan. This left the three friends to eye each other with worried glances as they attempted to silently communicate feelings of comfort and companionship.
“Oh the truth I should imagine” Andy replied, placing Teddy into a high chair next to the table and retreating over to the kettle.
She told them about sixth year and how they had discovered Horcruxes. She told them of the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, of Dumbledor’s death and Snapes betrayal. Then she told them of how she had decided she needed to protect them. Until Voldemort had been defeated she would never be safe and neither would they.
Luna gave Harry a sad smile. “You lead children on a rescue mission into the Ministry the year before Harry. You didn’t ask us to come, but we were there. That put us all in danger, yet none of us blame you because you thought you needed to save your godfather. You didn’t have a choice. Draco had to open that cabinet and let Bellatrix and the rest of them through, if he hadn’t Voldemort would have killed him and his parents. Didn’t you see how ill Draco looked all of that year; he was almost grey by Easter. I don’t think he had any more choice than you did, he may have had less.”
Sighing he pushed the paper away. “Yes, all three actually. Not exactly the way I’d like to spend my August.”
Dinner at the post-war Burrow was just as large and chaotic as it always had been, though now many of the meals had a quieter retrospective edge. As the Burrow had filled with more and more mouths to feed it had become increasingly clear that however much Mr and Mrs Weasley enjoyed having the company they were not able to afford to regularly feed up to twenty or more people. It had become a bit of a bone of contention to begin with, as none of the Weasleys would accept any money towards the food; this was until Luna arrived one day with two whole salmon and a large cake she had made. Mrs Weasley had been too polite to refuse the gifts and had cooked the fish up into one of the largest stargazy pies Harry had ever seen. Ever since that day when people came over they regularly bought an offering of food to add to the veritable feasts Mrs Weasley would prepare. The offerings were never expected but they were also never refused and Harry had often seen Mr Weasley’s thankful gaze fall on anyone who offered something towards the nights meal.
Harry was being shaken roughly, two hands clamped firmly around his shoulders and a warm ruddy face looking down at him full of concern.
Typical Dean, Harry thought, the guy had just lost his whole family, spent half a year on the run and been imprisoned in Voldemort’s base of operations, yet he still found it in him to notice when others were struggling with something.
Dean frowned slightly, obviously confused by this change in conversation “Yes” he replied shortly.
Harry frowned at Andromeda daring her to disagree. Andromeda stared back for what seemed like minutes as she took in all he’d said.
“He spent the whole night crying, nightmare made him piss himself didn’t think I noticed the worm.” The one guard spat in obvious disgust.
Rapwinder whirled to face the court, dark arched brows raising as he peered down his nose at those assembled for the trial. “The Prosecution will be pressing for the highest of charges available at this time. Life imprisonment, with no parole or visitation rights.”
“So” Mr Granger said as they pulled out of the airports car park and onto the main road. “What are these tests you need to run my house? And why am I not allowed back into my own home before they have been completed.”
“Finally realised his precious mummy and daddy aren’t going to get him out of this one, got enough on their own plaits” the other said with just as little sympathy.
“Great Merlin, what are they saying now?” Harry asked hopelessly. Ever since the Battle Harry’s fame had only increased, it didn’t seem like a day went by that there wasn’t some mortifying story about Harry splashed across every paper’s front page. The stories ranged from deeply embarrassing speculations as to his relationships with his friends to incredibly invasive biographies of his early life. The most ridiculous so far had been an article that had suggested that Harry and Ron were secretly dating and Ginny and Hermione were merely helping to hide it from the rest of the world.
“You know Harry at the manor Malfoy was just as scared as the rest of us. Maybe even more so, at least we had a locked door between us and the madness.” Dean’s eyebrows knitted together as he looked at Harry. “He was actually kind to us, in a way… he was always the one who bought us food, I got the impression he was bringing more than he should of if I’m honest. Never cursed any of us, which is more than I can say for the rest of them. Even cast a warming charm on Ollivander once” Deans face screwed up in momentary revulsion. “Voldemort had spent the afternoon
The silence stretched on as each person around the room started to comprehend what the Ministry was asking of them.
“Oh pft Harry” she replied, waving her hand as she made her way back into the house. “My wards are strong enough to tell if your really you or not.” Still Harry thought it was always better to be on the safe side.
Next Ron stood up and raising his wand produced several small blue birds that flew around his head twice before vanishing in little puffs of smoke. His eyes lingered on Hermione during the conjuring, a small smile playing at his lips. Next Harry stood quickly searching his mind for a spell that would show how wonderful magic could be.
Hermione looked at him with that slightly exasperated look of hers, like he hadn’t read the books for a piece of homework.
“I’m up, sorry if I woke you” Harry said pushing himself up in the cot he’d been using, squeezed into the tiny floor space in Ron’s room.
Harry had made an effort to see Teddy and Andromeda once a week since the end of the war, he wanted to be a part of Teddy’s life, wanted Teddy to recognise him and grow up feeling loved and supported. Even with his regular visits however Harry still couldn’t quite believe how anything so small and fragile could exist. Teddy brought out a fierce protective streak in Harry that he’d never really acknowledged before. He had quickly realised that he would go to any lengths for this small and delicate person.
“I don’t know if that’s entirely fair Neville,” Luna said making everyone look at her in bewilderment. “I can’t speak for Narcissa or Lucius. But Draco was only young when the war started.”
“Everything seems completely fine, the Simularéé hasn’t found anything more dangerous than some of that Weasley nougat that gives you a nose bleed.” He said with incredible satisfaction.
Harry took a deep breath, opened his mouth and explained about what he’d seen the day before in the Ministry, about his conversation with Dean and how Draco had refused to identify him at the Manor. It all tumbled out quickly; after all he still wasn’t entirely sure how he felt about everything. Was he even right to be raising these points at all? “I mean he’s a twat that hurt people, nearly killed Katie and Ron. He’s bigoted and stuck up but in the end he just seemed scared and confused and all he was doing was trying to survive and keep those he loved safe. Can any of us say we wouldn’t of done the same?”
*   *   *
Since Seamus was in Ireland visiting his family for a few days, Harry and Ron had stayed up with Dean. It hadn’t been openly discussed, but no one was quite willing to leave the dark skinned, West Ham supporter alone just yet.
“Mission review,” he said. “Boot?”
What a terrible thing, to have your neck in the grasp of one Draco Malfoy, who was expected to make an honest go at something in order to save it.
Malfoy turned around. He and Harry both did not look at each other while some sounds came from behind them that sounded like Hermione hopping around on one foot.
“I was in the library so I could figure out how to do this, you troglodyte,” Granger said, and making a complicated motion with her wand at Potter, said, “Finite moda immoderata! Oh, and arresto momentum!”
“Wow,” Draco breathed, genuinely impressed. Blaise had always been quicker than he in Charms.
And it seemed as though he was telling either the truth or a very good lie.
Blaise was still eyeing Theo suspiciously. Draco coughed. Crabbe and Goyle bustled noisily up the stairs to their rooms.
Draco’d hoped it wouldn’t have to come to this but it appeared as though he’d gotten everything he could without it.
have proof, Professor. He fed me Amortentia a couple of weeks ago and I have at least fifty students who saw me under its influence. Hermione will tell you that he did it. She was the one who broke the potion’s effect.”
“I don’t know,” Theo said. “He’s been acting off for weeks. Has he told you anything, Pansy?”
The only problem, as Draco, who was an excellent Potions student, had known, was that Amortentia was supposed to make someone fall in love with the brewer. It had only taken a few days of research on Polyjuice Potion for Draco to realize that adding some lacewing flies after the crucial steam stage should make it redirect to the person whose hair they put in, and he’d dispatched Crabbe to retrieve one of McGonagall’s hairs. Except when they were about to brew the potion on the bathroom floor, Goyle managed to drop the silvery-white hair he’d collected and picked up, instead—somehow—a naturally platinum blond one.
“Damned if you do, damned if you don’t,” Draco said.
“Which makes my ability to tell you to stop being such an utter git even more potent,” Harry told him, “and if you don’t, I’ll report you to Dumbledore.”
Harry shrugged. “He’s Malfoy—who knows what he’ll do?”
“Why?” Boot asked, rubbing his temples. “Do you need more Ravenclaws?”
It didn’t take long to slink to the dungeons, since Draco’d been doing it most days of his life since he was eleven. While he did it he thought of ways to get out of this.
“Good.” Dumbledore stood and stepped gingerly down the stairs from his desk. Harry reached out instinctively, and Dumbledore steadied himself on Harry’s arm, patting his hand thankfully. Harry tried not to shudder when Dumbledore’s wizened flesh met his.
Draco clenched his jaw and grabbed the scroll.
Harry sank heavily into a chair. He let go of the sword, which stood alone on its side, its tip buried most of the way into the table.
Potter was out of the room before he finished a sentence.
They waited in silence until they heard his door slam. Then the three of them leaned toward each other, any vestige of their former lightheartedness vanishing.
But his pleas fell upon deaf ears.
“Not that I’m not enjoying this, Draco, but is it really necessary?” Boot asked, accepting a chocolate from Goyle.
“I need to talk to you,” he said, trying to look gaunt and haunted, which wasn’t hard, because—much as he hated to admit it—he was, rather. “Blaise, I—know you have some connections with the Dark Lord. Professor Snape told me. And he told me he had direct orders to have me help you with your mission.”
Then, finally, Granger cried, “Alohomora,” and the door swung open, and she charged into the room with her mane of hair bobbing about her head and her robes swishing. Upon seeing the two of them on the floor, her lip curled.
“So it was you who taught him that spell,” Malfoy mused, then straightened. “Oh, and also, Potter and I are absolutely
He shuddered, imagining trying to tell Dumbledore about a sex dream, and immediately got a pounding headache.
4. I hope everyone is taking care of themselves and that this can bring you a bit of fun in this absolutely mind-boggling time.
This is my last pre-written chapter for now, and just in time for finals week! I may have to skip a week or two in the near future and will be sure to update this chapter to inform you in advance. Hope everyone is safe and well. Enjoy. Please.
That moment could’ve cost him his life, because Blaise had his wand pointed straight at Draco and was just about to mouth a spell when—
Pansy’s curling writing whispered peace from the scroll under his hands, and Dumbledore glanced down at it once again, then back up to them.
Potter opened his mouth to protest and Draco shook his head.
Hermione had gone to the library earlier, determined to ace every one of their final exams the next week, and Harry, having despaired of finding Malfoy today and put off studying as long as possible, decided around noon to stop playing his fortieth game of Exploding Snap with Dean and head there to find her.
“Draco!” Pansy, desperately trying to change the subject, exclaimed in relief upon seeing him.
Plunging into Blaise’s mind was like diving into a labyrinth of ice-cold water, but Draco, who’d always been skilled in the arts of the mind, found his way to a locked door—locked by magic, he could see, perhaps to keep less-skilled Legilimens out, or perhaps to keep Blaise himself from fully being able to access the knowledge he held. Whatever was the case, Draco performed his best slither and got in.
Potter went to Dumbledore’s office with Draco, where he stood behind Draco’s chair as though guarding him, something the old man seemed to find very amusing. Then he watched Draco as he Levitated the still-Petrified Blaise to the hospital wing, as though Draco was fragile. And now he was sitting with Draco beside Blaise’s bedside, waiting for him to revive.
Draco took her hand in his and squeezed it gently, and she smiled at him, a soft smile he rarely saw. Usually Pansy was all gleaming teeth, sharp words, perfectly kept, a ferocious lightning bolt of a woman. But sometimes she was the warm smooth light of the sun illuminating a cloud.
“HERMIONE?” Harry said.
“I suppose,” Pansy said, still looking like she wanted to pick a fight. “But I want real work to do, not just busywork.”
Easier said than done. Harry nodded, and wondered all the way to the Great Hall how he was going to reconcile his outright War on Malfoy with Dumbledore’s request.
“But no,” Boot continued. “Professor Snape gave me an extra assignment and I had to stay up last night and the night before to finish it.”
“I’m a prefect too,” Draco countered. “I could do this all day. Well, not in this situation because I think I might pass out soon, but—”
Potter retrieved his wand from his trousers, Summoned his Invisibility Cloak, and glared at Draco as the two of them left. “This isn’t over,” he said.
“That’s not…exactly how I’d put it,” muttered Harry, pacing across the common room floor and deepening the groove he’d worn in it in the last two hours. He wondered as he stumbled over its edge whether the castle was mocking him, because this couldn’t be natural.
“Good to see you, Headmaster,” Kingsley said. Harry thanked him silently when he said nothing about the paint, choosing instead to nod and add, “Mr. Potter.”
He sighed and told her...most of the story. She actually seemed impressed for a second when he told her about the modification to the Amortentia, though she tried to hide it, but her look deepened into a scowl when he told her the part about sneaking the potion into Potter’s pumpkin juice by leaning over his table and provoking him while a first year accomplice dropped it in, and when he told her about how Potter had chased him all over the school and everyone had begun fighting amongst themselves for some reason when they saw Potter corner Draco and try to snog him in the Great Hall, she sighed.
“Now you have proof that he did something bad.”
“Harry, do you have any—”
“O great warrior goddess,” Draco cried, “please free me.”
“Are you alright, Potter?” Summerby’d appeared at the top of the stairs. Harry waved her off. Malfoy? On their side? Making peace? Ha. Those had been the words of a child.
“Summerby?”
Malfoy covered his eyes. “MAKE IT STOP!”
Draco had...a complicated relationship with people. He’d been raised without friends; even childhood companions like Crabbe and Goyle had been minions from the start, and Pansy a future wife, so no matter how much he loved her platonically, their relationship would be forever tainted by the expectations of their parents and their rebellions against them. Theo and Blaise were closer to friends, and on a good day Draco might call them such, but recently Theo had been disappearing for hours on end, and Blaise seemed to grow more and more sullen by the day—there was tremendous pressure on him to serve the Dark Lord, to whom his late father had been dedicated.
1. Listen to Sawayama by Rina Sawayama. Best album of the year. I also think some songs are particularly relevant to this fic ("Chosen Family" comes to mind for this chapter).
“What do you need, Draco?” he asked, and in his tone Draco recognized not the familiar jocularity of a childhood playmate but the measured cadence of caution, like drops from a perfectly controlled siphon.
It was very lucky that first-year Slytherins were trained to slink during orientation. Sure, learning Transfiguration was all well and good, but slinking? Now that was a marketable skill. Draco wondered if he could fit it on his resume:
“I have a reason to ask,” she assured him, glancing down at her parchment. “I’m not sure if you know how Amortentia works…?”
“Very much, but maybe later,” Blaise said. “I don’t have feeling in my legs or torso right now so it’d be a fair fight.”
“Fuck Slughorn, kill Sprout, torture then kill Dumbledore,” Blaise said, and as the other two erupted into protestations, he said, “No, wait, I have reasons. Dumbledore’s obvious, the old man’s got to go—what?”
Draco shook himself.
“Like...a magical matching service?” Harry asked, raising his eyebrows. This sounded like a load of codswallop to him.
“Forbearance, thy name is Potter,” said Malfoy, following along behind, and then bumping into Harry when he stopped in horror.
Boot shrugged. “I think it was only for me. Snape didn’t tell me why, but...I think he was angry that I was coming top in the class and he wanted to give me something that would take my marks down. He said this special assignment would make up a quarter of my final grade. Luckily I finished it—”
Harry took off the cloak.
“Ah,” Draco said. All the blood was going to his head.
Susan rolled her eyes and shook her head, which made the little bows in her hair sparkle, and moved on. Hufflepuffs: Draco would never understand why they were necessary.
Potter abruptly shot off of Draco and into the air, where he hung by his ankle and looked very confused. He kept trying to reach for Draco, who was still on the floor.
“Positive,” Boot said. “Wild horses and Professor Flitwick couldn’t get that paint off.”
“Like I’ve just been betrayed,” Blaise told him. “Draco, what were you thinking? I have to do this, he’s got my mother—”
from those wrinkly lips was never a good sign as far as he was concerned.
The sweets that Goyle was currently feeding to him, one at a time, at Draco’s insistence, couldn’t be hurting either.
He had barely noticed Potter’s soft dark hair and smooth deep-gold skin, his broad chest, the large hands that could hold both Draco’s wrists in one fist. Barely. Hardly at all.
Good. A distraction from his mission.
