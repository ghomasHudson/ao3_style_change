(Yes, they had been housemates for over a year now, and Harry cooked for him, and gave him silly gifts, and had even tucked him into bed once, but how could Draco be sure it was attraction and not, oh, Gryffindorishness?)
“I being sorry, Mr Harry Potter, but Headmistress McGonagall is not here!” the house-elf says anxiously.
Draco gives her a flat stare, but Nolan and Sequoia step over to Aster’s bed inside. Granger and Weasley hover awkwardly a few meters away.
taking-a-break. The badges are expedited into production, with fourth year Aster and a couple of competent sixth years roped in. Felicity sets up the surveillance charms that trigger in the presence of non-Slytherins. The Greyback issue niggles at the back of Draco’s mind, but he has to deal with mundane
out loose is a headache. It was a good thing Voldemort never knew of Malfoy’s abilities during the War.
, the robes came to Draco’s knees instead of to the floor, with fussy lacing instead of fussy buttons, unpressed trousers underneath instead of pressed trousers. It wasn’t
He’s able to lose Hermione in the crowd of students, and soon he reaches the empty corridors, climbing up to the Astronomy Tower.
However, Neville, Ron, and Hermione are clearly happy that they weren’t at Hogwarts over the Winter Break.
“A shame,” Blaise says with a faux-sad expression. A moment later, he is serious again. “The aim is to prepare for its eventual movement. In order to reduce the impact of the Castle falling, Gryffindor Tower needs to have some ability to fall down slowly…”
” Harry says a beat late. But he catches Malfoy giving them a sniff, the tilt of a fond smile on Malfoy’s face.
“I know,” Lucius grounds out. Tracing a symbol in the air with his wand, the wards on the front gates drop.
Friday arrives with dark clouds and strong winds that whistle through the classroom creating an eerie sound as it passes over stone. It’s not a pleasant day to be out, yet it’s extremely noisy outside the Hogwarts gates.
“After reading your accompanying message with your order, we decided to upgrade your order, free of charge, to the extra-large size. For easy storage, we have included this space-storage box also free of charge.” Pansy hands over a square box, a two-handspans in size—though it fits easily in Hagrid’s palm.
The other man grits his teeth. “Harry Potter,” he says tersely. “There is no law against disciplining my own fucking kid.”
Potter looks up at Draco with a self-deprecating expression. “You were good. You don’t need me at all.”
Draco rubbed Harry’s tummy and Harry giggled. He immediately wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck and let him carry Harry to the main bathroom.
“Extremely hazardous,” one of the old male theorists says with a red face. “We could have been injured! Imagine if there were children inside!”
For all that Robards is drowning in work, he eventually finds time to call Draco Malfoy to the Ministry for questioning on Friday afternoon after Hogwarts’ classes should be over.
Draco says nothing, waiting for the last of the kids to get back inside Slytherin. The stone wall closes behind them. Draco heads up to the Eighth Year dorm room.
Nolan’s hackles raise as he feels something big coming towards him. Then, the features and scent resolves into Mr Draco Malfoy!
The work is methodic: making potions, soaking badges, evaluating. Over the iterations, Draco figures out the formulas and makes sure there are no missing minus signs. Unfortunately, the badges can only soak in the cauldron a few at a time, otherwise the potion-infusion process is uneven.
Blaise smiles serenely. He pulls out a fresh new blueprint and places it on the central table. With a tap of his wand, the flat image rises up into a 3D castle.
A warm hand threads through Harry’s hair. “Go to sleep,” Draco’s low voice whispers against Harry’s head.
At minimum, we want the model to be better than simply guessing randomly; and ideally, we want it to exceed human guesses.
“We all did what we needed to do to survive. I recall your guerilla group didn’t hold back, either.”
Draco withdrew, and gave a quirk of a smile. “Some of the kids used to call me mummy's boy, whenever you sent me chocolates.”
Harry’s mouth dries, eyes wide as Zabini’s smooth dark skin emerges, glowing under the warm lights. He’s glad that Zabini isn’t looking Harry’s way, but it’s a small mercy.
Ron gives Harry a commiserating pat. “If you stayed in Gryffindor, you won’t have to do work on a Sunday.”
Michelle, in disbelief, follows Jamie back to Slytherin. Draco ushers the other curious Slytherins back, looping his arm around Harry’s and bringing up the rear.
“Your wounds are as magically healed as they appeared,” Pomfrey finally says. She also gives him a nutrient potion and ushers him out of her office.
“I learnt a lot by being the Head of Slytherin. I’ve learnt a lot from the other Slytherins. I’ve learnt from the students from the other houses. Don’t be left behind, Mother. Choose to change and take charge of the change. Not just with your charity in public, but in your heart.”
Garren bares his teeth. “You’re been insubordinate, you bloody little Death Eater. Do you know what the Ministry thinks of me now? They think I
The languor of the weekend and the collapsed Hogwarts gets shaken off as the second year students try their best to learn the spells that Professor Flitwick has just taught them.
if you want to see smut. However, there is no schedule for that...maybe in a month’s time at latest, I’ll have something? 🙈
Draco heads over to them, lips curling up. “It’s not yet 8 am, but you are already up. It’s surprising how you can wake up so early on a holiday like this.”
Potter gingerly steps closer. And then, in a burst of Gryffindorness, he starts petting the thestral leader. She allows it, pressing into the affection, and shifting away from Draco.
Draco describes their perfectly innocent actions of camping under the stars and the full moon that night, making no mention of any werewolves—
Alice’s friend is not the only surprised person tonight. Who knew that Slytherins play games like normal people? And that they even sing badly like normal people? At least there are Slytherins who can play musical instruments perfectly as expected...
So Jamie subtly pulls a small packet from his bag and extracts a chocolate coated biscuit—he had made them last night when he went over to chat with the house-elves. Some of the chocolate biscuits have already been given to Mr Malfoy to make him less grumpy and more head-pat-y.
Madam Pomfrey shakes her head. “Even newly healed patients must sleep, Mr Potter.” She recasts diagnostic spells on Draco. “He is no longer in danger due to magical exhaustion. However, he needs to rest to fully recover.”
“Stretch out your magic to the walls of Hogwarts,” Blaise says softly. “Can you feel it pulsing? Can you feel how the weave is made, the individual threads?”
Draco rubbed his hands on Harry’s thighs, going up to grasp his hips. “You’re light.” He held Harry’s head, kissing him gently on both cheeks.
When Draco wakes up, early the next morning, his mother’s owl is waiting for him. And as he reads the contents, his stomach flashes from cold to hot.
The cart makes a sharp turn, and Harry squeaks manfully. “Malfoy!” He turns back to glare when Malfoy starts chuckling.
“Good morning. Then please, both of you, take a seat.” McGongall shifts aside various papers on her desk.
Draco sweeps his gaze over all the Slytherins gathered. “Thank you to everyone for their magical contribution. But don’t think that it’s a bribe to stay up. Unless you want me to
All his Slytherins are in the Commons, eating dinner together. It almost feels like the carefree Winter Break again: no thinly veiled whispers, not sharp narrowed gazes.
A moan reverberated in Harry’s chest as he stuck his hand under his joggers and pulled out his own cock. Pleasure spiked as he tugged off in one hand.
They enter Hogwarts Castle. Potter stamps his feet, shaking off snow. Draco draws his wand and efficiently strips off the snow from both their clothes.
Shouts appear out of the apparently empty space. Outlines appear as some of the magic is stripped back by the fire. “Fuck!”
At the Ministry, for once, a part of the bureaucracy is moving quickly. The anti-Slytherin faction in the Ministry and Wizengamot can only grind their teeth at Minister Shacklebolt’s speedy dealing with the administration behind Headmistress McGonagall’s paperwork.
Harry’s lips parted. Draco swiped his thumb across the bottom lip, soft and pillowy. Harry’s tongue darted out, wet and firm.
Harry tugs her off and heads towards Draco, but Granger jumps up from her seat to follow them out. Weasley looks at them, mouth stuffed full of food, but ultimately doesn’t get up.
destroyed our home. It’s not hard to see who sneaks out on the nights of the full moon, now that I think about it.” Mary’s eyes flash. “Watch your back.”
However, Granger, who is also sitting at the Slytherin table with Potter as she does these days, is not impressed.
Hitchly shares what has been happening on his side, and Garren on his. The tension through the phone is thick. Both of them have been downgraded since the year began
“Don’t forget your tenuous positions,“ Hitchly sneers. “You must fully cooperate with the Ministry. Summon your son. Who doesn’t know that the Malfoy family is a rotten set of three?”
Harry wakes up the next morning feeling like he doesn’t want to wake up. It’s warm and cosy and soft and he instinctively feels that it would be cold the moment he moves away.
first and second years locked up inside the Slytherin Dungeons, he can freely indoctrinate them with whatever pureblood supremacy nonsense!
In Potions class, Garren’s eyes are cold and angry, tracking Draco’s movements as he works with Potter on their assigned potion. When class ends, he tells Draco to stay back. Potter diligently stays as well, trying to take on the role of protector seriously.
He steps over the sleeping wolves, and walks around the sleeping thestrals, who came earlier that night. The thestral leader opens one eye to look at him, then closes her eye again.
After the handover of the rebuilding to McGonagall, they first need to clear away the rubble. The Ministry team offers to help, but McGonagall kindly declines, telling them to have a rest after their two weeks of hard work. Under the watchful eyes of others, they can only leave with Minister Shacklebolt.
“Then what about me?” Potter asks. “I’m not here because you’re going to duel someone in the Forest, are you…”
A moment later, a house elf appears in the room, tugging his ears anxiously. “Master, Madam, Aurors want to enter!”
“Oi, get back to your own business!” Malfoy says. “Potter’s no more a threat than a child in their terrible twos, and much more easily dealt with.”
Malfoy’s mouth curled up. He rested Harry’s hand on one large palm and carefully placed the ring on Harry’s ring finger.
Juvenile spells have jammed the motion mechanism, overwhelming the staircases’ ability to sense students’ requirements. The pattern of spells is spidery and holey in his vision, and deft cuts in certain strands make the hex fall apart.
“Hmmm.” Draco pushed Harry down on the sofa and buried his face in Harry’s chest. “Most handsome ineligible wizard of the year.”
“What are you moaning about? Isn’t it just Charlie’s dick?” His other hand trailed down Harry’s back, down to where Weasley cock was penetrating him. He hooked one finger under the rim.
Despite Blaise’s agreement, Draco doesn’t feel settled at all, dammit. But it’s not as though he can avoid Potter, since Potter is the one going around looking for
That evening, the tables in the “eating quarter” of the Commons are transformed into more formal, permanent tables. With Blaise's gentle encouragement, Hogwarts has obligingly grown the common room again. More couches fill the larger space, and new tables have sprung up by the bookshelves. Draco has sent an order for more books to fill the new shelves.
Harry makes a face at her. “You’re blowing it out of proportion,” he complains. “It’s just Malfoy’s working there now.”
Draco’s mouth opened. When realisation struck, his eyes darkened. “Harry.” His voice was low and hoarse.
With effort, there is no tremble in Narcissa’s voice as she replies, “Head of Slytherin? Surely it’s simply Draco’s jest.”
“It’s not like Ron can copy my exam answers. You’re acting as though looking at my essay won’t make Ron’s essay
Aurors I would never assign to them because I know they’ll fuck it up. But Ron won’t let me back in the field, you know.” Harry let out his frustrations, his shoulders becoming lighter with each confession. Meanwhile, Draco was taking off Harry’s red robes—undoing the buttons, carefully tugging Harry’s arms out of the sleeves. At the end of it, Harry huffed. “I think I might need to get a secretary after all.”
: WFT! How are there so many articles? end out press releases! It doesn't matter how many people are behind this, we will suppress them!
. But instead, it didn’t activate until Aster Grace had the unfortunate luck to step down the stairs.
Blaise pats the stone he has been sitting on for the last week. It’s in fact the core foundation heart stone of Hogwarts, infused equally with magic of all four Founders to the point that which magic is which is literally indistinguishable. It’s where the bulk of Hogwarts’ sentience lingers. Blaise had taken it out from the old Great Hall during the ‘clearing the rubble’ phase, and no one had noticed.
Harry shook his head, and gazed at Draco. “I can’t accept them romantically.” He gripped Draco’s arm, fingers sliding down until they slipped in-between Draco’s and fitting
With lessons now held in the classrooms again, McGonagall has split the classes into two, instead of the previous year-level-wide classes that had been necessary when the professors were also busy rebuilding. Although the classes are split such that there are students from two houses, more often than not, students from various houses will gather together after class to do their homework together and to play: in the library, in the new student lounge rooms that Hogwarts has constructed, on the new playground outside… The school now has so many more spaces that encourage and facilitate cross-House friendships.
Minerva rubs her temples as she thinks of all the Ministry’s papers and letters on her desk, all the things she’s stopping them from implementing at Hogwarts.
His mood sweetens as Harry unconsciously snuggles closer. At least this one ex-Gryffindor is reasonable.
That Friday evening, Draco finds out that the second years skipped potions and walked out of Muggle Studies without telling him beforehand.
Harry’s glad that Pansy gave him and Draco a separate room now. With everyday being so busy, the only long stretch of time he gets to have Draco to himself is these eight or so hours during the night—so what if Harry is unconscious for most of it?
Sorry to the people who do like Hermione...she and Ron have been downgraded to cannon fodder 😅😅😅....
“There is hardly anyone willing to do the long calculations necessary for any sort of accuracy,” Draco says. “It is easier to find a diviner instead.”
Back at Hogwarts castle, now that ground and first level walls being put into place, the Slytherins can start on their ground-floor extension. Due to the position of the Slytherin Dungeons facing against the Black Lake waters below, the ground floor of the Slytherin quarters overlooks the Lake, so the plan is to make it half lounge half conservatory, and add a balcony over the waters.
Dust and rubble make the corridor ahead hazy. There’s the sharp tang of offensive spells, the familiar scent of
“Madam Greengrass, good afternoon. To what do I owe the pleasure?” Narcissa Malfoy says, calling for a light tea service. “Have you thought about the potential engagement between my son and darling Astoria?”
The thestral leader bumps into his neck none-to-gently in rebuke. Draco pulls away, dips, rolls and loops in the air.
“Wait, Malfoy!” Harry dodges the guards and rushes after Malfoy. He dashes in front of Malfoy. “Wait, where are you going?”
Felicity and some other seventh years sitting directly across him move down, with enough space for the Golden Trio. New tableware appears.
Unfortunately, by the end of the day, Draco’s actions have spread through the Hogwarts populace, no doubt initiated by one of the other student werewolves who had seen.
“We need to go and have a careful talk to this Draco Malfoy,” George said. “Make sure he’s treating our Harry right.”
Draco shoots Harry daggers, but his eyes grow warm as he pats Nolan. “Yes, yes, let’s go back for breakfast, okay?”
“Is this what you wanted?” Draco grunts out, his focus tightening in on his cock, on Harry’s arse, on Harry’s face.
It’s the condition that Draco proposed to his parents—he will return to Malfoy Manor for Yule and the Winter Solstice, but he
“Whatever it is, she isn’t!” Harry protests. “Malfoy’s merely an old school mate. We’re not even friends.”
Robards is haggard: hair messy, dark bags under his eyes. He glares at the gathered Aegis members and then turns to McGonagall. “What happened?”
“Thank you, Harry!” A brave Gryffindor calls out. It leads to a cascade of “thank yous” from everyone else.
(Ginny throws a triumphant look at Ron, but when Ron turns to Hermione, he finds that Hemione is entirely occupied by her thoughts.)
“Sweet dreams.” Draco strokes Nolan absently, as everyone burrows into the blankets, settles down, and falls asleep.
The short Ravenclaw stares between her friend and Pansy in horror. “What did you just do?! I’m going to tell Professor McGonagall! That was illegal!”
“I understand that the Aurors should have been guarding Malfoy Manor. Our wards were weakened under Ministry decree, so I sincerely hope that the Ministry will provide some compensation.”
Harry looked up at Charlie from this unfamiliar position. Charlie was shorter and stockier and much more ginger than Draco. His skin was tanned, almost as much as Harry’s, and his muscles bulged. His cock was shorter but wider.
“Ohh, Malfoy, what are you doing hanging out here?” A small cluster of Ravenclaws and Gryffindors are arranged by one of the large windows overlooking the Quidditch Pitch.
Harry frowns. "McGonagall wants me to head to her office right away. Kingsley is there...he wants to speak with me."
Draco’s lip curled. “Much left to be desired,” he drawled. “I expect all preparations to be done by the time I come down.”
you have any ideas to fight or protect, tell me, understood?” Draco says seriously again. “I hope you won’t act on your own. We are much stronger together.”
Unlike Harry, Draco favoured the light blanket instead, the ridges and plains of his body softly distorted by the blanket draped over him.
Harry’s lips curved into an impish smile, mentally patting himself for the great excuse. It wasn’t that Harry was
Draco blinks and pulls up a sleeve. It’s true: the blood is dried on his arm, but the cut is closed, pink.
Harry’s body twitches. Draco thunders forward, falling to his knees. He lays a hand on Harry’s chest. Where Harry’s magic should lie is a great emptiness—
instead of the Wizengamot wand pointed at Hogwarts…! She spent the entirety of yesterday arguing with the Hogwarts Board, and she’ll be spending the rest of the week doing the same thing.
Under the firm pressure, Harry let himself be shifted back, taking a seat ungracefully on the sofa. Now he had to crane his neck to look up Draco, and the exaggerated height difference took Harry’s breath away, always. It made him feel younger. More vulnerable. It made Draco’s actions all the more meaningful, because now, over the months of their relationship, Harry
“Hogwarts is more than just its Houses,” Draco says. “It’s more than its Founders. It’s the Professors. It’s the students, the house-elves, all the other staff, the ghosts, the portraits, the statues, the building itself. Even without my formal withdrawal of Slytherin, we have already been rejected.”
. “Very well,” Draco says. “I assume you’re free sometime in the afternoon. Let’s organise a class for Slytherins first and second years.”
“—And with her invitation, obtaining an exemption from the Aurors will be simple,” Narcissa adds. “Do you think of nothing to help your own son?”
Draco presses his hand more firmly against Hogwarts, feeding it some of his magic. The tendrils of it—silver—spread out and merge into the multicolouredness of Hogwarts. “Good Hogwarts.”
Harry nods unhappily. The four Eighth Years join their magic to cast a weather-proofing wards over Slytherin.
Malfoy looks at him expressionlessly. He turns away and pinches the bridge of his nose. “Not even an Oath would stop Potter from telling his sidekicks everything…”
Broad shoulders. Prominent adam’s apple. Thin lips. Grey-silver eyes. Sharp eyebrows. White-blond hair.
if he had been bitten by a dragon. People have gotten bitten by dragons before, but none of them have turned into weredragons.
In the last moment, Draco shifts and presses his lips on Harry’s cheek, then quickly leans back. Although it’s brief, Draco could still feel Harry’s cool skin.
for Christmas??! What kind of present is that?” He lowers his voice, whispering to Harry, “I think he still hates you…”
Slytherin originally moved under the power of repulsion from the other Houses and Hogwarts. Now that Hogwarts has been reinstated as being of Four Houses, Slytherin feels a natural attraction.
The fics that a human was able to guess are also marked on the results, which is interesting in comparing which fics that were easy to guess both by humans and machine learning—and which were easier for different methods. Authors that were predicted correctly by all methods (human and machine) are:
The slow fluttering of Harry’s eyes, the little moan from his mouth. Draco takes them as his due as he twists his fingers inside Harry. He loves how Harry’s body grips them, even in the half haze between sleep and wakefulness.
Potter arrives to breakfast a bit after, looking like he’s slept in his robes, and Granger and Weasley come strolling in after him, hand-in-hand.
Alice trails behind them, her head down. With Malfoy and Potter, tonight won’t be a worry. But tomorrow morning, how will she get back without Mary noticing? In the same common room, Mary will accoust her eventually, and she’ll tell everyone else, and then
When the two of them return to the Slytherin Commons, all of the younger Slytherins and visitor-students are sitting, watching the entrance.
Harry was still there in the morning. Draco got to see him in that early morning light, just woken up,
Minerva’s eyes narrow as she examines the magical fabric of the corridor. There are no errors...but the
“Yes.” McGonagall describes how she was woken by Hogwarts when it came under attack, and how those Aegis members cast destructive spells to the side of the castle, despite the students standing on the Slytherin balcony.
But as to who bought it in...the information she has gathered is still not enough. There are many students who wear muggle clothing.
in, and leaned over to kiss Harry. His tongue fucked Harry’s mouth, taking this pleasure that he could take for now. His chest swelled with love and possessiveness and protectiveness as Harry dissolved into whimpers.
“Mr Malfoy, can you comment on the recent accusation that you are the dragon animagus?” a reporter from the
Alberta Bulstrode’s mouth widens into an excited smile. “We learnt window charms! We were thinking of improving the sunlight coming through the windows.”
Hatred flashes across Gardiner’s face. “We’re not done here,” she threatens. She motions to her gang and they all flee in the opposite direction.
McGonagall stands up immediately. “No one will be dueling outside of the practice duels underseen by a professor!”
Draco’s eyes narrow. His ears prick, sharpening to the sounds around him. In a flash, he swings to one of the Gryffindors, Dennis Creevey. Creevey’s heart is beating hard. “
Draco automatically looks up when the Slytherin passageway opens. Felicity Shafiq hurries in, mouth set in a frown as she heads over to Draco and his friends.
with the Hogwarts elves. Be that as it may, I expect you all to be in attendance for tomorrow’s Christmas Feast.”
After the speculations about Draco Malfoy’s animagus forms dies down, the conversation shifts back to Aegis vs the Death Eaters.
“The Slytherins have their breakfast in their commons,” McGonagall says wearily. “You can talk to him later.”
be happy,” Harry calls out, vaguely seeing Unspeakable Nightshade between all the thestrals between them. “So go the fuck away.”
Draco narrows his eyes. The doors open automatically, with just enough space for the two of them to pass through. The corridors flash by. Draco dives between the staircases down to Slytherin’s floor, and only then lands.
Malfoy catches him looking though and glares. The bouquet vanishes, and Malfoy motions for Harry to follow. “I bet you rolled out of bed in those clothes too,” he mutters. Malfoy ruffles Harry’s hair, and smirks. “I think I just made it
Draco calls forth one of the familiar house-elves, and not long after, a delicate tray appears complete with tea set and accompaniments.
inwardly sighs as he trails along with Hermione and Ron. He doesn’t want to speak with Garren—maybe it’s the mood of the other Slytherins that has affected him, or maybe Garren’s just crap. But regardless, Harry pulls a polite smile on his face as they approach Garren’s office.
,” Draco continues. “He has a fucking hero complex. And what he wants is for us to get along. You’re all
Malfoy inexplicably freezes for a tiny moment. “...Don’t act so spoiled,” he grumbles. “Now.” He levitates up their NEWTs potion book. “It’s very likely that we’ll look at one of these two potions tomorrow, so
Harry’s eyes curve with expectant joy as he flips through a reference book to find some instructions he needs. He hopes everyone will like what he’s preparing for them.
As Harry tears the silver wrapping, he uncovers a milk chocolate treacle tart filled bar, a slim box containing a handwriting correcting quill, and a charmed badge that flashes:
Soon, more and more Slytherins trickle down. Pansy and Blaise eventually come down. Pansy sits on the seat next to Draco, vacated as Nolan joins the third years in opening their presents.
“They’ll be hypocrites!” Nolan protests. “They want to remove Slytherin anyway! We’re doing them a favour, they owe us!”
In the afternoon, Wizengamot Member Griffiths returns with more people who are part of the Ministry rebuilding team. The space cleared has reached Unspeakable Nightshade’s minimal requirements. While they could wait further, they know how important it is to quickly show their skills and expertise to the public.
Blaise continues, “The Slytherin Dungeons is saturated with Salazar Slytherin’s magic.” His eyes dim. “To reduce the pressure on Hogwarts, we should carefully unravel the threads of Slytherin’s magic from the rest of Hogwarts.
The reporters rush forward. Rita Skeeter pushes her way to the front. “Headmistress McGonagall, tell us, is Hogwarts going through with the removal of Slytherin?”
“What?” Harry says innocently. He raises his hands slightly, lightly brushing over the ring on his finger.
Somehow, Draco’s able to spend the entire morning exchanging jibes with Potter. When lunch time arrives, everyone returns to the Slytherin Commons. Draco vanishes all the excess snow off his Slytherins before they can create puddles in the common room. After the chilly outside, the Slytherin Commons feels particularly cosy.
In the afternoon, Blaise along with the professors and the Hufflepuff upper years determine that the Hufflepuff building is indeed safe for the students to return. The entrance is changed though, so that students would not have to crawl on muddy ground.
“Fuck, I bet Harry’s the best fuck you’ve ever had, Charlie,” Draco sneered. “Come on, don’t you want to come for Harry?”
At this point in time, many people knew that Harry and Draco were dating. Surprisingly, there was nothing derogatory in the papers, but neither Harry nor Hermione even thought about it. Since nothing bad happened, what was there to think about?
Of course, not everyone in Gryffindor had joined in. Some had seen Harry arrive, and pointedly stomped up to the dorms away from him.
. “Is that so?” He rubs Harry’s hair, the warm, tingling sensation spreading across Harry’s scalp. “It’s not your fault, so don’t worry about it.”
Here, we use supervised learning. We are given the list of authors by the event organisers, and this allows us to gather previous writing samples from their AO3 page. The learning is 'supervised' which means we have previous works from each author, and we know who is the author in these previous works. We can use these works as example of each author's writing style (e.g. frequency of popular words, sentence length...). These samples are used to train and build a predictive model, which we then apply to the unknown works from the fest.
For all that Potter protests, by the time Draco finishes his nightly routine, Potter has already fallen asleep haphazardly on his bed on top of his quilt, as though he was lying in wait for Draco.
And so begins Draco becoming not just the Head of Slytherin, but a mini potions professor too??????? XD
However, the order has been flipped, lowering Draco’s opinion of the Hogwarts’ student cohort once again.
Narcissa sighs. “So far, Aegis only strikes a location once. I’ll wait til Lucius wakes up and we’ll redo the wards carefully. He
The Manor stirs in ripples of magic as the fundamental wards return to life. Narcissa releases the spell with a slow exhale. It’ll take days yet before all the wards re-establish, all the while leaving the Manor vulnerable.
“Okay, no more work,” Pansy says. She conjures up a glass of water, cold enough to frost the sides and gulps it down.
The Forest is abound with sounds around them, but they are nonetheless distant. No malcontent creature dares to approach them.
The days leading up to the new year continue to be carefree and lively. Harry manages to coax some of the other students to join in on what becomes daily snowball fights across all the houses. Draco resigns himself to maintaining warming charms on everyone, instead of playing himself, because Harry sets the firm rule of No Magic.
McGonagall’s lips quirk up, just a little. “Mr Potter may stay. He is a trustworthy wizard, and we are not discussing state secrets.”
Harry rolls his eyes. His voice softens, “Thank you for making that offer to them. It will definitely help with House unity.”
“Hannah, Neville, Hermione, Ron, we’ll have to ask you to help us,” Blaise says in a measured tone. “The three of us used a lot of magic to keep Slytherin together during the move.”
“AH, MR MALFOY! What a coincidence!” Hagrid’s voice carries across the grounds. He walks in big strides over to them. After a round of “Hello, Professor!” and “Hello, everyone!”, Hagrid holds up a large poster that is clearly an enlarged picture from the
The next morning, Harry woke up snug in Draco’s arms. He didn’t open his eyes, his mind still dazed. He thought it was some other day, last night he and Draco…
Meanwhile, the thestral leader flies back and lands on the opposite side. Draco and Harry jump off, and start heading towards the coordinates.
” Harry woke up with a cry. His hole clamped down on Draco’s cock like a vice. Misty eyes looked over his shoulder, meeting Draco’s.
Definitely not in the middle of some grassy open area, where everyone can see. Definitely not in the middle of the Quidditch Pitch, especially if other students are training. Definitely not in the shadowed Forbidden Forest, where the thestrals are liable to come by and interrupt. Definitely not in the middle of the Black Lake, where the Giant Squid will be a nuisance. Perhaps...there are the mountains beyond the Forbidden Forest. If they have a date above the clouds, then they could have natural blue skies, but no, it’s too isolated and Draco would have to be on alert in case anyone, such as Aegis, comes by.
The other officials look up to him, making Anderson’s self-importance swell. “You,” he points to Official #1, “Go back and retrieve our wands from the Headmistress.”
Draco now remembers Bartholomew’s face in the audience in his War Trial, hanging on every mention of
cannot go bursting out in flames whenever he goes near to one. There are Hufflepuffs in his NEWTs classes, for Merlin’s sake.
breed of dragon…” he mumbles to himself. “Those wings, he can definitely fly. If I had to pit him against the other dragons at the reserve…”
A tinkling of sound fills the air, as Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt calls attention for the round of obligatory talks. When it’s Harry’s turn, there’s no need for Harry to search for Draco in the crowd of faces. Draco simply twirls his fingers a little, and Harry will
Draco summons out his most austere set of robes—dark blue—and re-arranges his hair. The Head of Slytherin Office, where he currently is, has two entrances: one leading into the Slytherin Commons and the other facing the corridor outside Slytherin.
Minerva speaks. “Welcome, friends and family. We are gathered here today to witness the bonding of Harry James Potter and Draco Lucius Malfoy.”
,” Draco said. “Fine.” He tugged Harry closer to him, pinning him down with one leg slung over. “Good
be safe? Blaise’s mother? Pansy’s family? The families of the Slytherin students Draco has responsibility for? What about dangerous creatures? Or the thestrals?
Draco Malfoy snorts. “Oh, she was wandering about in the middle of the night too, and even got lost in the Forest.”
As the moon rises higher, Harry yawns. Draco takes this as a sign to start winding down for the night.
Harry sits upright on the bed and takes the message from the owl. The owl doesn't wait, flying out the open door immediately
Draco has a humourless expression. He doesn’t know them, but those Hufflepuffs have delusions of knowing
“You should all go to sleep so that Draco can rest! What if he doesn’t have enough energy to transform in the morning?” Harry says.
Harry came, white stars bursting across his brain, white come splattering over Draco’s joggers. He slumped down right on Draco’s hip, by Draco’s softening cock, and pumped his cock through the last of the orgasm. It took him a bit to catch his breath.
Harry meets Draco’s gaze across the crowd. Draco gives him a confident little smile back, but Harry somewhat wishes he could read Draco’s mind so that he can find out what they’re about to do!
Harry grabs Draco’s hand, pressing it down on his head. “You know, since we started dating, you don’t insult my hair anymore…” Harry smirks. “Because you
“I don’t have children!” he blurted out. He quickly crouched down, picked up the floppy rabbit toy, and shoved it into the lidded toybox. “It’s for Teddy and Victoire and Dominique and all the other kids when they come by!”
Remembering how Hermione kept pushing Harry to go outside, Harry had a great idea. Rather than having her tell him where to go,
Granger rolls her eyes. “Yes, yes, I know that you’re good to just your Slytherins. We all know that the problem is me, unable to get comfortable with someone who worked for an anti-muggle and anti-muggleborn terrorist group. Add in sexism and racism coming from muggles and muggleborns and
...In the end, Jamie’s the one who gets pushed forward to ask Mr. Malfoy for permission to leave the Slytherin Commons.
Draco slows his flight. He doesn’t need to worry about the thestrals—Hagrid will surely protect them, because Hagrid loves all creatures, the meaner-looking the better. Draco heads a little closer to peek at the herd. Some of the little thestrals are prancing around the trees at the edge of the clearing.
Many quickly take a few steps back, while others cast shield charms. Magically, all the stones cave inward, leaving the onlookers safe. A quick acting McGonagall quickly suppresses the dust thrown up.
A thrill of pleasure went through Harry. “Thank you,” he said, ducking his head from Draco’s heavy look.
Some authors had partially distinct author notes (i.e. content-wise, tone) that I also used to narrow down guesses
instead. How Snape had given him blocker potions because his parents were afraid the transition potions would affect the
It seemed that he wanted Draco to stay. It was extremely hard to leave Harry with that expression on his face, hence Daco’s teasing parting words.
McGonagall also moves in front of Draco. “Aurors, please, have patience. Clarity will be found in a moment.”
“...Um,” Harry eventually broke the silence. “Aren’t you going to kiss me again, or do you want to go to sleep early?”
They're all well prepared: multiple wands that aren't their own, re-sized brooms, a plethora of potions and protective badges. Both Pansy and Blaise have taken a potion to mask their scent.
But Draco’s only half listening. He can see the gaps in the spell weave. He can see the charred points, the wisping magic that has come untethered.
Hardly a minute later, Michelle comes dashing down the staircase. “Hya? What are you doing here?” She glances at Draco and slows down to a more refined speed.
Draco stares. He definitely thinks Draco is. “I had believed we were going to ignore each other for the entire year.”
Tension eases from Draco’s heart. He extracts himself from Blaise and Pansy, climbing out of the bed.
Draco kept grinding and thrusting, trying to squeeze every last bit of his come into Harry’s body, trying to eek out every last bit of pleasure from Harry’s hole.
Potter stays silent for longer than socially acceptable, a frown on his face. Draco looks away. The end of the Forest is near, and Draco can escape and never speak to Potter again.
“Draco?“ Harry says blearily. He pushes his glasses onto his face. He sees the blue robes on Draco’s body and awakens fully. “Let me see that too.”
“Well then,” Harry says primly, affecting Malfoy’s ridiculous accent. He half-turns on his seat and holds a hand out to Malfoy. “How do you do? Harry Potter, pleasure to meet you.”
Draco suppresses a smirk, presenting a collected face to McGonagall and Garren. “Shall we, Professor Garren?”
Draco exits and heads to Garren’s office. He arrives just as the office door opens, and Nolan and Harley walk out. Garren looms behind them, his face darkening upon seeing Draco.
“You’re going to give your speech tonight,” Draco says. “You’re going to look the audience in the eye and smile. The War is over, Harry. Its effects are not, but you’ve done such good work, Harry. You should be proud.”
Hogwarts,” Blaise says, like it explains everything. “And oh, Draco, I’ll be borrowing those silver robes of yours.”
Dark, heavy, and irritated expressions befall the Ministry team. Wizengamot Member Griffths’ face goes cold as she glares at Unspeakable Nightshade.
The spongy tip pressed against the rim of Harry’s hole, easily sinking in. The entire cock sunk in a slow and gentle glide.
Malfoy fixes his conjuration with a roll of his eyes. “Enough Potions tutoring, I need to find you a Transfiguration tutor,” he mutters.
“Yes,” McGonagall responds equally dryly. She takes them to the open field where the majority of students have remained after eating a picnic lunch. “There is the dragon.”
Robards and the other Aurors return to the DMLE. While the other Aurors get to go home and rest, Robards has to go and liaise with the Aurors in charge of interrogation.
about each other,” Hermione is saying. “Once we can understand each other, and realise that we’re all the same, once people
Harry observed Draco’s cock again, pumping it slowly. Draco’s cock swelled further, a tiny bit of precome oozing out. Harry licked his lips and went down. Hot hardness pressed against his tongue, filled his senses. He sucked Draco’s cock, taking him deeper and deeper.
Draco focuses on Nolan properly. It’s a little hard to pick out his scent in the group. But if Draco is right, Nolan’s scent coupled with his eyes...the small werewolf from last night!
“I cooked for you today,” Harry retorted. “At least Malfoy tells me how delicious it is every time.”
, but now I think something else will suit you better,” Pansy says with a smirk. “Come with me. Blaise has vacated the room next door.”
After Filius Flitwick leaves the Hospital Wing, he quickly locates Pomona Sprout to aid him in the corridor clean-up.
But to be serious, he shakes his head. “Even if the Wizengamot change their mind, it will not be fast enough to save Hogwarts as it was.”
had given us more Aurors! If you, Minister, had allowed us to call in the Unspeakables—! The hitwizards! We were outnumbered!”
are the weak link. You failed to accompany Harry, you failed to notice that Creevey and the others had designs against Harry. Look at it from
about flying around Draco. With a toss of his head, Draco beats his wings hard, rising up into the air and pulling ahead, heading deeper over the Forest. He soars, pale wings luminous.
Pansy points a finger at Draco. “I’m too young to be a grandmother! I don’t want an ancestor like you!”
Every single move Harry makes drives Draco to go faster, to fuck his hole, to make him cry. Harry’s cock is red and hot, pressed between their bodies. Harry’s legs tighten around him, pushing him deeper.
There’s also increased fracturing between them and their parents, which Draco and Pansy understand intimately. What their parents want of them...is no longer what they want—except they’ve been on that course for
Breakfast is held in the Slytherin Commons, and they find out what’s wrong when the morning owls arrive.
Harry removes his arm and finally gets under the covers, wriggling to find a comfortable position. “It’s nice to be back here properly.” His green eyes behind his glasses are serious. “Even though it’s been hard for us, Hogwarts will be better for the students coming after us.”
When Luna learns about this, she tells him to attend this meetup in London for asexual people. Harry protests that he wants a relationship, but Luna just smiles and sends him along.
“Yes.” The three of them head out to the Potions laboratory to brew the first of the daily doses before the next full moon.
...It’s all his father’s fault! Causing Nolan to turn into a werewolf like this! Does his father know how painful the transformation is? Does his father know how disgusting Wolfsbane is?
With that, the Hufflepuff students happily move back into Hufflepuff, and their ire against Slytherin drops a lot.
“Yeah, sure.” Harry nudges the last piece of fried salmon in place, and closes the container with a victorious grin. “It’s for my boyfriend.”
Maybe Malfoy was crossing the courtroom floor, his robes flaring around him. Maybe he was sitting at his desk with a serious expression on his face as he worked through highly sensitive documents.
“Wow, mate, it feels like it’s been a long time since we last saw you,” Ron says. “These last few days sure have been long.”
The Ministry officials are forced to hand over their wands. Only then does McGonagall step aside long enough for them to file in. She closes the gates on the Aurors’ faces.
Draco is fast, very fast, especially as he does tight weaves between the trees of the Forest. Harry leans as close to Draco’s body as much as possible.
“No, of course not.” Draco looks at Pansy and Harry. “The rest of you can reinforce the Slytherin Commons with your own magic.”
More than one Slytherin looks at Nolan with a mixture of envy and pity. Mr Malfoy is pretty cool sometimes, but he also makes them do homework!
During the afternoon, the Eighth Years and the Seventh Years Slytherins take turns to knock out parts of Slytherin quarters in preparation for the renovation. The same is happening for the Hufflepuff rooms.
Minerva decides to keep quiet for now. She’ll deal with it when Richard decides to tell the Ministry that he dueled a student who was supposed to be under his care.
The house-elves are a massive help in transporting the house tables outside for dinner while the professors and older students put up makeshift tents for everyone.
Satisfaction and triumph graced Draco’s liquid silver eyes, but a pleased smile graced his lips. “Good boy,” he said, low and deep and so, so terribly
is Samhain.” With Potter’s attention, Draco tells him about the veil between life and death, the food offerings. And sometimes, speaking with those who have passed.
In the Slytherin Commons, while Harry is still catching up on lost sleep, Pansy eats her breakfast with great satisfaction.
Madam Pomfrey’s expression becomes very unamused, especially when she looks at the picnic basket in Harry’s hands. “That is not a good reason to
trust. I invite you all to stay in Slytherin. You don’t have to accept, and you don’t have to accept immediately. But think about it. The badges I sent you can be used to contact me…”
,” Draco rolls his eyes, but holds still as Pansy checks, poking his bare skin with her wand. “Blaise, summon me some robes for tomorrow morning, and my sleepwear for tonight.”
Harry summoned it. He had taken it off when he went to meet his friends yesterday. After he put it on, Draco rubbed his hand with his own hand with his ring. He immediately understood that Harry had so far kept their relationship a secret.
“Don’t invite me to the wedding, or us Malfoys will duel with all the Weasleys. The Weasleys will be humiliated.”
Draco stills his fingers instead Harry’s arse, rubs the outside with his thumb instead. “I need you loose enough for the plug,” Draco says innocently. “Relax, Harry.” He presses hard against Harry’s prostate, pulsing his fingertips. He
The Slytherin Commons is quieter than the rowdy Gryffindor Commons. With the crackling of the fires and the rustle of turning pages, and Malfoy dragging him through the assigned work, Harry ends up actually completing his homework.
“Words are like empty air that dissipate with the wind,” Draco finally says, slow and measured. “Apologies won’t bring back the dead. Apologies won’t end the pain. Apologies don’t clear away memories. But if you want empty air, then I’ll give it to you.”
“You should go for a run, stretch your limbs,” Draco says, scrubbing Nolan’s head. “I’ll be right here.”
Harry frowns. Do their clothes look...brighter than normal? He can’t shake off the oddness though when he, Ron, and Hermione sit down on one of the couches. “What’s wrong? Did something happen?”
He didn’t expect Harry to follow him. He didn’t expect Harry’s tight hug around his waist, face buried in Draco’s back.
By the time Harry looks up again, Malfoy has apparently ordered for both of them, and Harry accepts a paper bag with a baguette sandwich, and then Malfoy’s
: *muttering to herself* Now I just need to figure out how to shut them in a closet together, or make them sleep in one bed, or trigger Draco’s veelaness or something...hmmmmm…...Ψ(￣∀￣)Ψ
Harry’s eyes fluttered closed again, a little sound escaping his mouth. It was tingly and good and if his Dom would just keep doing that forever and ever...
The master bedroom is just as destroyed as the rest of the Manor. Drawers and bookshelves and personal items are strewn across the floor. The walls show damage—as though Aegis were trying to find any hidden compartments or rooms.
“I’m sure Professor McGonagall would allow you the use of the Great Hall. This is the kind of unity initiative she has been looking for.”
“Before we can retaliate, we need to ensure our own safety. If you retaliate in the dark, you must be sure that you will not be found, and that no one around you is implicated, and you must be ready to face
She pats one of Hogwarts’ many walls. “Thank you, Hogwarts. You’ve done a great job. The students love you.”
“There is no need to be afraid of them.” Draco pats Nolan lightly and turns to the thestral leader. “This is the leader of the thestrals. She can look after you.”
Felicity deftly casts a privacy charm around them as Pansy strolls up to their table and plants her hand down.
Draco puts on a worried, demure expression. “I’m concerned about the younger students, just in case. I can protect myself. I’ll head back soon.”
Malfoy...Draco...is right. Calling each other by their given names like this, and not because they’re playing to an audience, feels...different. It feels unfamiliar, like they’re stepping closer to each other.
Draco snickers. “No comment,” he tells the reporter. “Ask the DMLE for more information if you dare.” He puts one hand on Nolan’s shoulder and the other hand on Harry’s back and steers them both away from the reporters.
“Nope, just one. I don’t think there’s a girls’ Eighth Year dorm at all. Did you know that Malfoy sleeps with Parkinson and Zabini? No? Neither did I. I didn’t even notice it on the Map previously…”
Harry’s mouth flooded with saliva. Draco’s cock sprung up, thick and hard and Harry could already imagine how much it would stretch him, how deep it would reach…
Harry has no idea what he’s told Malfoy he’s going to get. Aware of the time, Harry grabs an old looking chess set and heads out.
There’s no hope for homework being done tonight; and as for Sunday, it takes till the late afternoon that they all grudgingly take out their very-soon-to-be-due assignments.
“If apologising will do so, then I will get down and prostrate. What counts as an apology? Should I get down and grovel? Should I appear
The privacy charm around them suddenly drops. Pansy smoothly re-arranges her face and steps back towards Felicity.
Draco conjures up a sofa. After casting a warming charm, he sits down, arranging the fall of his robes neatly.
Contemptuous eyes follow the Slytherins as they take their seats in the Great Hall. The Slytherins quietly discuss their work as they eat, while Granger hurriedly reads the newspapers.
Meanwhile, Draco’s letter doesn’t arrive by owl. Instead, his mother’s personal house-elf appears in front of him with a strict expression on her face, interrupting his dinner.
Meanwhile, the fleeing Ministry officials find themselves stopping short of leaving, for a couple of reasons. Firstly, McGonagall still has their wands. Secondly...the press is waiting for them outside the gates.
Draco quickly checks the bonds in his chest, but no Slytherin has been injured. The group splits up once they enter Hogwarts, with Draco farewelling the students from the other houses.
Draco’s shoulder’s drop, and he chuckles, and even if the laughs sound a bit high and breathless, Harry’s glad (if a bit confused). Draco takes Harry’s hands in his, and assures, “
Just at that moment, McGonagall’s cat Patronus flies up to Madam Pomfrey, requesting her expertise. Madam Pomfrey quickly leaves.
“Sleep well,” he said quietly. He was late back because of the long dinner with his family and friends. By the time he cleaned himself and climbed into bed with Harry, it was very late.
Harry’s eyes widen, then a smile grows on his face at seeing the familiar creatures. Next to him, Draco sighs when a small thestral stumbles on its landing.
“I’m not going to die soon,” Draco said, patting Harry on the head. “Death is just the other side of life.”
Draco pushes Harry’s legs apart, a finger pressing against his hole. It flutters against his touch, and Harry opens his legs wider on his own accord.
They want both a Hogwarts that is traditional and a Hogwarts that has no Slytherin. Each block of stone contains whispers of Hogwarts’ magic, but none of these threads in the ‘new’ Hogwarts are weaved together in the elegant way they should be.
Draco Malfoy’s eyes narrowed at the departing crowd. Some of those reporters apparently did not want their livelihoods, boasting like that…
Of course his words are true. And of course he would prefer it if he could gather his enemies to one place and set fire to them. Unfortunately, he has the moral obligation to help these children grow up better than himself.
“Dilly, is it,” Malfoy says smoothly. “Would it be too difficult to arrange a midnight feast for us, suitable for the wolven forms of my Slytherins?”
“Yes, Mother.” Their eyes linger for a moment. If it weren’t for the company, Draco might have talked to her more. But he can’t, so he turns on his heels.
,” comes Nolan’s voice down the corridor. It’s not particularly loud, but Draco can hear. They must have finished their detention while Draco was busy shaking off Garren.
“Pity…I’ll just send them to the bottom of your wardrobe in case you want them in the future.” Just like that, the items disappear from her hands.
Pansy slings an arm around Harry. “Do you like personal-heater-Draco that much?” she teases. “Maybe we should get a private bed for just you and Draco…”
After a moment’s reacquaintance with the dragon’s frame, Draco shakes out his wings and leaps into the air. Where the Forest is cool and misty and dark, the sky above is bright cloudy white, and the canopy a deep green, and hiding all the dangerous creatures within.
Draco thought for a moment. “How about the Potter vaults? You might be able to find some robes there.”
Draco grumbles. “Go to sleep, you bastards. We have another test tomorrow. And Pansy and Blaise, stop corrupting Potter.”
Harry stumbled to a stop, tilting his head up to look at Malfoy in confusion. He shivered as the cold wind blew across his neck. The leather jacket had no collar.
And as for the students who are being sneered at in Taylor’s heart, they can’t really care less, because they’ve been told that if they behave,
Draco nods, not flinching when Narcissa pulls out a small diamond blade. As the focuser, Narcissa draws her blood first, and then Draco’s. The Manor’s heartstone soaks it up in an instant. Giving up his magic to his mother is instinctual at this point. He feels the way it flows from him to her, how she shapes it before letting it flow into Malfoy Manor.
Harry lowered his head and cleared his throat. “Yes. I wanted to tell you...I accidentally told the Weasleys and everyone else that I’m dating you. Is that okay?”
“Hey, why do we only have dragons? How about we make a card for each of the houses? I want to have a lion!”
Harry smiles politely. “Good afternoon, Professor McGonagall, Professor Garren. I’m Draco’s second in all his duels, so I felt it suitable that I come as well.”
minor modifications. But as Harry experienced last night, it appears to still be lethal. So if you see it,
Nolan laughs happily, deciding to ignore Harry. “This is so cool!” The other students watch enviously.
“I don’t see what the problem is,” Anderson says, running his eyes over everything. His fingers twitch for lack of his wand. “You have been doing good work to patch up the hole left by taking out Slytherin.”
Professor McGonagall, seated at the front, casts her gaze across the Hall. Her lips purse. “Which students are missing?”
Harry has no doubt that Luna has somehow orchestrated this...but as he spends the afternoon playing board games with Malfoy and the others, he can’t find himself to be too bothered. The others find it so amusing that they call each other
“I’m about to address a dire emergency,” Malfoy says. “Tell the boss to pay me overtime: it’s a design
“Hah, look at you, Harry. You really are the best cock slut I’ve had the luck to fuck,” Draco growled.
It’s a waste of twenty minutes, especially Draco already knows what he’s going to do. He’s going to complete a
Draco draws his wand and summons it. While Potter is standing still, he drapes it over Potter and casts a warming charm into the weave. “Come.”
Harry emerges from the bathroom, rubbing his hair with a towel, only half dressed. The scary part is about to come—
have a badge from myself? This vial is a pepper-up, and this is a general healing potion. And this is some high quality milk chocolate, as I assume your palate is not refined enough for dark chocolate. I also took the initiative to provide you with a hand-writing-assisting quill.”
Zabini sits on the extremely large bed, tilting his head. “This is our bed,” he says, his voice a little deep and meaningful.
There’s a big silver dragon on the ground with students, flying in the air with students, being petted by students, breathing fire to an audience of amazed students... And under many of these articles describing how friendly the dragon is, there is a little advertisement with a picture of a soft and fat dragon.
Richard Garren smiles politely as he invites Aurors Michael Hitchly and Ellias Bartholomew into his office.
Since Slytherin separated, Hermione has started opening the map to check Harry’s whereabouts. She still finds it hard to believe that Harry
“It’s okay,” Harry gasped. “Draco said it’s okay, I’m okay. I’m not weak. Draco has fucked me multiple times in a row before. It’s fine.”
“But...it’s better to have more people accompany you, right?” Potter looks up at Draco from his seated position, green eyes wide and pleading.
Harry’s smile broadens. “Yeah, they have an in-built paw-activated warming charm! Just squeeze his cute little paw…”
“We’ve done many things,” Draco replies, “Not least, recovering our magical reserves after the Hogwarts collapse.”
Flitwick purses his lips and quickly hops off his seat and comes to the front of the stage. “This is urgent, I assume. How may I help you?”
“To become a solicitor, Draco needs to complete a training contract with a law firm,” Andromeda explains. “Gringotts has a Muggle front, too, and has the added benefit of training him in Wizarding law.”
“Ah,” Blaise says, patting Potter gently on the shoulder. “You’re a Slytherin, so of course we would hold a session with you too.” He side-eyes Draco. “Except it
“Oh, if Nolan doesn’t consider you his father, then give up,” Draco says to Mr Larch. “You clearly do not want him as a son.”
“HARRY! And Malfoy!” Hagrid stomps into the clearing, with Luna Lovegood by his side. Hagrid smiles widely as he looks between Draco and the thestrals and Harry. “I knew there was some good in you, Malfoy!”
,” Draco sneered. He unceremoniously pulled out of Harry, leaving come and lube dripping out of Harry’s hole.
.” A large silvery stag emerges from Harry’s wand. While the stag is bigger than both of them, it suddenly looks very small next to the dragon.
Harry moaned, and began to bob his head, going faster, sucking harder. He went deeper and deeper, until he swallowed down Draco’s entire cock.
The Slytherins are separated from the others, as usual. They are already dressed. Martin Gamp looks particularly worn out, and Mesa Wattle can barely keep her eyes open. Young Nolan Larch, however, is sneaking looks at Draco.
Draco reaches out, sliding a finger along Harry’s cheek. The cut is gone now, long transferred and healed on Draco’s face. “Did you completely miss the cut on your face? Did you completely miss the spell to your knee?”
“Is that Harry P—” Their voices would strangle to a whisper when piercing grey eyes landed upon them. They couldn’t help but shuffle away from Solicitor Malfoy, and in turn didn’t dare to rush to Mr Potter.
Before Harry is allowed to leave the Slytherin Commons, Draco makes sure that he has his hat, scarf, gloves, and warm over-robe.
“Go faster and harder,” Harry said immediately. At this point, Charlie’s cock was in his anal hole. What were to be embarrassed about anymore?
Hermione nods. “Yes, it’s probably better for you not to join them, you can make a greater impact influencing policy directly…”
Outside, Hagrid and a number of Hogwarts Alumni have added new landscaping, like expanded gardens with seats for students to sit, and a large pond for ducks and other birds that is safe from the Giant Squid.
His magic is still not stable, but he really cannot listen to everyone discussing how to wake him up. He
The lights around them flicker and the temperature drops sharply as the local temperature regulation charms fail.
Tonight though, Harry’s not in Slytherin! Hermione quickly scans the entire map, only to find Harry’s name—along with many other students—in the Forest.
“Wait!” Potter grabs Draco’s arm. “Hagrid also asked if we wanted to feed the thestrals this morning.”
“Oh, as long as Draco is okay, I can have these printed and distributed across the entirety of Great Britain,” Pansy says carelessly. “Draco, you better start a business, quickly. With this kind of advertising, any venture would explode in popularity.”
“No, that’s simply my mother planning things without my knowledge!” Draco quickly clarifies. “I have no intention of marrying her, nor any of the Greengrasses.”
And he holds very still, but Draco doesn’t wrap his arm around him, nor rubs his hair like he usually does.
Draco meets the blue eyes of the Aegis member, their Occlumency shields smooth and impenetrable, face disguised. In one smooth motion, Draco steps forward, wraps an arm around Harry, and apparates them.
magical under the eyes of the Professors. But it is better if they leave early, than wait for the other Houses to ambush them.
Harry shivered. “Yes…” He wanted to feel that overwhelming pleasure again and again. And Draco was more than happy to oblige.
It’s all done by lunchtime so that the Slytherins and those staying with the Slytherins can move some of their belongings over with the help of the house-elves.
.” The Aegis member makes a hand signal, and a handful of other Aegis members head over. “One of our colleagues has been developing a potion to test for signs of dark or corruption magic. We fear that you have been indoctrinated by Malfoy Junior. Please step aside. If he has done nothing wrong, then he has nothing to fear.”
,” Nolan retorts. “I’m a third-year!” He picks up his bag and heads into the crowd, intent on finding Mr Malfoy first.
Ellis pulls a face. “Why does it look so boring?” He jabs his wand at the enlarged chair, though the attempted carvings and swirls he makes it on doesn’t look any better.
Professor Flitwick shakes his head. “If you can tell the rest of your House mates... I do not know how long this matter will go on for. However, I will be able to teach one class every afternoon, solely for the Slytherins. It’ll be a bit long, one class per year level, but that is the best I can fit into my schedule. To the best of my abilities, I will reduce any disruptions to your learning.”
, Harry. You’ve gotten angrier and angrier lately, it’s getting out of control. There are even rumours that you’re the next Dark Lord, and if anyone’s felt your magic, I’m not surprised!”
Draco pushes a single finger in, his other hand gripping Harry’s waist tightly, thumb caressing over warm skin. It’s slick and hot inside. Draco presses his fingers up.
There are students with lowered heads, fingers tight as they read the latest anti werewolf tirade in the papers.
Malfoy stepped close to him, protecting him from the wind and foot traffic around them. He had his scarf in his hands, and he slowly wrapped it around Harry. Malfoy’s gaze was serious and each movement was deliberate and careful, as though he was arranging the scarf on a model, not on little old Harry.
They went flying after that, over the hills, far away. They pranked sheep, raced against unknowing muggle cars, and dined in some hole-in-the-wall pub.
Draco comes along, allowing everyone to gather in the rose garden which remains as opulent as it was during Valentines. Once everyone enters the enclosed area, Draco seals the rose wall again and casts a second privacy charm over everything.
Pansy is casting healing spells on Jamie’s face. “Weird...” she mutters. She turns to Draco, and her eyes widen. “The
, he urges Hogwarts. He twists his magic in with Hogwarts, shifting the strands of magic, soothing it.
Up ahead, what should have been a sparse, twiggly garden is instead a lush spring paradise. With Longbottom’s help, all the flowers are in full bloom, both on the original flower bushes and all the
Flitwick catches Draco towards the end of the lunch break outside the Great Hall, handing over the sheaves of parchment with class notes and assignments.
“And eat and chew with your mouth shut,” Draco adds. “I don’t care about Weasley, but you, Harry, are now a Slytherin.”
the infused magic. Running fingers across the cloth, he can pick out the minute magical signatures of different Slytherins, each of them familiar and resonant with the bonds in his chest. And Blaise’s magic pulls it all together, interwoven with the slightest sense of
Harry Potter would react this way, he would have done it much earlier. For a while there, Draco thought Harry hadn’t been
“Come on Harry, let’s go back inside. It’s cold out here for you,” Draco says. He places a light hand on Harry’s back and nudges him back inside, while shooing Blaise off with the other hand.
“Only at Parvati and Lavender’s wedding. They had insisted,” Harry said, eyeing the sherwani. “But I don’t feel...I grew up with white muggles, you know. I don’t
That means that Harry has become the ‘stepfather’ of many children despite not even have married yet.
One of the Aegis members spits out, “Who asked them to interfere? There should have been no students in the school!”
At that, Hermione feels complicated. After Malfoy reprimanded her for not keeping Harry safe, she would
When bedtime arises, there’s no need for Pansy to coax him. At this point, Harry is getting used to sleeping next to her. He also suspects that the bed has gotten even
Malfoy’s gaze retreated. He stepped back, releasing Harry. Harry took a deep breath, welcoming the cold air.
A tight squeeze and Draco spirals out right above the mountains, the loud explosion of his apparition echoing into the distance. A flock of birds take flight in shock and a number of annoyed creatures in the Forest grumble.
One of Draco’s hands sneaked under Harry’s shirt and pinched his nipple. Harry moaned, and the last of his coherent thoughts fled.
One of the Gryffindor boys laugh. “If you’re not a baby Death eater, then you’re a werewolf. I heard you Slytherins holed up in your dungeons the entire Winter Break. You should go back there, we don’t want to see your face.”
Over the next few days, pictures of the rebuilding effort cover the front pages of many papers in Britain, with hopeful headings like:
. I represent everything that they hate. If you—and all the other Slytherins—throw me out, distancing me, then I can draw their ire.” Draco would have to continue to pull their aggression, but that wouldn’t be too difficult, even if he has to toe the line set by his parole Auror. Draco’s well versed in making others angry.
The Minister stands up. “Well, I’ll take my leave here. Aurors Hitchly and Bartholomew will be questioning Mr Malfoy, so Harry, you are also free to leave.”
“Why are you so certain, Mr Malfoy?” McGonagall says bitterly. “For the last week, I and many others have been pushing for it to be delayed and discussed. But your actions have completely destroyed our case!”
Draco pulls out his Ministry-issued wand and casts a mirror-type shield charm that runs from the ground where the pitch meets the stands, and straight up into the air. “Go right ahead and practice then.”
It’s a very novel experience to be so close to everyone else as they engage in quiet  talk in the dark before sleeping. Draco is the one who finally says
After the common areas are done, Blaise and Felicity start on the individual houses. Waiting for them at Gryffindor Tower are Ron, Hermione and Neville.
Harry holds Draco’s clothes with one hand and awkwardly climbs up onto Draco’s back and settles in between the grooves of Draco’s spikes.
Draco acts like he’s fully focused on his food. Harry can’t help by dart glances at Draco; and Draco in fact is doing the same, only he is a tiny bit more subtle about it.
Mesa jumps down the last few steps and races to Aster’s side. “It happened so quickly,” she cries. “I tried to catch them but—”
Early the next morning, before breakfast, the house-elves privately deliver the new badges to the students Draco cared for on the night of the full moon, along with a set of instructions on the badges, and a bar of chocolate. These badges will personally communicate with Draco, if the need arises. They also look different from the badges the other Slytherins have, with designs based on the other houses.
“M—Draco…” Harry said weakly. His face was smooshed against Draco’s broad chest. He hesitantly wrapped his arms awkwardly around Draco. (The scarf was now precariously hanging off one arm.)
Harry does so, and Malfoy accepts the papers back. Aside from his narrow-eyed look of suspicion, he doesn’t comment. “That’ll be processed within five working days.” With his wand, the papers fold up, seal, and fly off wherever it is that transfers go to get processed.
In his sleep, Harry takes the opportunity to snuggle even closer to the warmth, pressing right up against Draco’s side.
Draco hummed, and both of them pretended to be polite and talked naturally to the other Weasleys and extended family.
Harry’s ears immediately go red as he yanks his hand back, rubbing his palm on his clothes. “In public,
Harry’s eyes widened. He tugged his hand back, but Molly grasped it too firmly. He had forgotten to take his ring off! He usually put it on when Draco came because Draco liked seeing him wear it, and Harry liked how it matched with Draco.
“...Good,” Weasley says, clearly not wanting to thank Draco. He fills his plate and stuffs his mouth with food.
In the dark Forest, this small clearing is bubbling with activity. Draco entertains the young thestrals and the more playful werewolf students with conjured jumping obstacles; Harry attempts to play fetch-the-stick with Nolan (who soon returns with a huge branch and attempts to poke Harry with it). Some other students lie in the nest, while some stretch their limbs in the surrounding Forest.
But when Draco idly strolls up to him, drawing heat at his fingertips, the Ravenclaws scamper back and leave.
Sharp, hot breaths. Dragon spine replacing human. Draco’s nails are claws. A bond yanks tightly in Draco’s chest.
Blaise raises his eyes to Hogwarts. “Slytherin’s magic has already begun to separate from the other three.” He sighs. “Poor Hogwarts.”
Unbeknownst to Draco Malfoy, Harry watches all the Slytherin students leave breakfast, the image of Malfoy’s tight expression and heavy shoulders lingering in his eyes.
Harry’s hole was like a ring, Draco’s cock a finger...But he will put a proper ring on Harry. He planned to do it after New Years, so that in the future, they could take an extended holiday for their engagement anniversary.
The circle never truly fades—at least not while the yule log burns. But it’s dimmed enough, and so Draco turns to his Slytherins. “Let us eat.”
, it would have been quite nice if Voldemort didn’t try to kill me every year. And I would protest against not allowing first years on the Quidditch teams, except I got in, didn’t I?” Harry shoots him a sly look.
While Harry has to contend with the real dragon, Nolan hugs his dragon toy with its activated warming charm, closes his eyes and peacefully goes to sleep.
be your parent for the interviews with any other professors, and I will discuss with you directly for the Head-of-House interview. Your dad can use that time to study instead.
Deadly fire laced with magic bursts out from the dragon towards Aegis. The Aegis members have to stop and put up shields. Hungry flame licks around the shields, steaming the water beneath their feet.
Hitchly raises an imperious eyebrow. “Either you summon your son here for questioning, or we drag you both to the Ministry cells for obstructing justice.”
Garden’s jaw tightens. “I’m bored,” she announces. With disdainful looks, Hufflepuffs finally go back up the staircases.
Harry nods seriously. “That’s true, all those people will be fired, and they might even be sued for criminal damages. Wouldn’t it be a twist of fate if some of them had to do jail time at Azkaban?”
“This is confidential. If I hear about anything improper in the papers, I know who the tatter-mouth is,” Draco drawls. “Although, such a scandal would only pour more gold into Mrs. Zabini’s coffers.”
The Hufflepuff laughs lightly, and then tries to walk past Draco. Draco moves right in front of her.
It was literally ice cream—it came in a cone, and had the same shape as ice cream, and it was eaten by licking. But rather than being cold, it was warm.
Draco’s smile deepens. “Good boy.” He shifts, raising a hand to caress Harry’s face. “You did very well today, for the most part… Should I give you a reward or a punishment?”
apologise to Harry for suggesting we give him up to Voldemort,” Pansy jumps in. “Except I’m not. Because it
They make their way out of the Ministry. While a few discreet cameras go off, they portkey back to the Hogwarts gates.
Shacklebolt smiles wryly. “You gave out the challenge for us to fix Hogwarts, so we’ll have to attempt that. I’ll do my best to give the Ministry a deadline, and if they cannot meet it, you will be put in charge.”
When Draco received the invitation letter to repeat his Seventh Year at Hogwarts—even though it was mandatory for him—he was relieved. It was a chance to get away from his damned father. Draco thought that as long as he stayed away from Potter, he wouldn’t be angry enough to transform while at Hogwarts. Unfortunately, Professor Garren proved him wrong.
In one school of thought, Draco is highly aware that he should force his Slytherins to attend class. They’re facing a
Draco saves Harry’s gift for last: it has the sloppiest of wrapping, which is difficult for Draco to understand because Harry was wrapping a
Malfoy leans in closer, his arm brushing against Harry’s chest. A delicate finger traces the edge of the case.
Creevey sucks in a sharp pained breath. “You don’t understand!” His eyes redden, a glistening gathering at the corners. “That wasn’t meant to happen…”
The charmingness of Blaise’s smile increases. “However, I am very privileged to have you sitting here this evening, Ms. Granger. You see, I closely follow your articles published in the
After making sure that the first years are eating, Draco heads out with the main group of Slytherins to the Great Hall.
“—Don’t you think Harry’s little hole is the best? But, you’re really not making use of it at all,” Draco said abruptly. “Maybe that’s why you and Harry would have never worked out. You’re too
It takes all of Draco’s strength to fuck them through their orgasms, to keep going until it’s too much. With a groan, he slumps on top of Harry.
Harry comes up behind Draco. Draco turns around to him and repeats, “I was never jealous of Ginerva.”
“Going to see the thestrals?” she comments. “Good, you’re less angry after visiting them. You’ll create frown lines too early, darling.”
The thestral leader makes an agreeing sound. The herd begins to move out, some of them flapping their wings lightly in excitement.
“Oh, you silly Potter,” Draco says with an exaggerated sigh. He pulls Harry close to him and leans in. Harry’s luminous green eyes widen as their lips come closer…
Blaise smiles knowingly. “Now, shall I ask Hogwarts to give you two a separate bedroom for various activities?”
Draco nudges Pansy in the side in retaliation. “Impervious charms are imbued in make-up,” Draco says. “Why can’t we enchant shield charms into badges?”
Malfoy’s other hand rested on top of Harry’s hand, momentarily covering up the rings. “I have a request.”
He debates sending an owl to Hitchly...but what can Hitchly tell him? That idiot has been suspended! Garren has no intention of spending time with the Slytherins, instead distancing himself from the Slytherin cohort—he will
“It’s the only thing you want,” Draco said plainly. “You never needed more from me. You had your dates, your friends, your family. What else could I offer that they hadn’t already given you?”
“It is a waste of time,” Michelle Nguyen says. She’s clearly thought about these words and delivers them smoothly to Draco.
Draco’s expression becomes cold. “Madam Pomfrey. I have everything under control. And I trust that you keep patient confidentiality.”
: 🥺👉👈 Um, after what Mr Potter said...I asked Ms Parkinson to help me...these are adoption papers...My dad (that bastard) already agreed…
extremely lucky that they hadn’t been paralysed from it—nerves are tricky business even with magical healers. “Yes, well, they didn’t find out. And like I said, Draco and Pansy, not sure how they did it, but I’m fine. But the...
Draco prepares two mugs of hot chocolate. He hands Potter one, and takes a seat on the same couch, forcing Potter to pull his feet in closer lest he touch Draco.
“Hey, you accused me of not having many romantic bones in my body, I’m just fulfilling your accusation so that you’re not wrong,” Harry replies with a shrug.
The bed began to shake as Draco fucked violently. Below him, Charlie started to thrust up in alternating time too.
They meet Hagrid and levitate the buckets of meat to the thestrals’ clearing. Immediately, the yearlings clop over to Draco, flapping their wings.
Neville drops by again with new seedlings, and then rather unexpectedly, Blaise Zabini is at his doorstep too.
After that, Draco tried actually dating other people. He tried to love them earnestly, tried to show them that he cared by giving them the world.
Draco smiles pitying at Garren. In Draco’s chest, he’s aware of all the bonds with his Slytherins. He knows all those who are watching their duel, including the portraits. If Garren is so willing to reveal how badly he failed, who is Draco to stop him?
. He’s apprehensive about how this would affect the kids in Slytherin. Blaise’s teasing cannot distract him from the mutter of voices.
Draco smirked as he started to piston his finger in and out. Charlie had quietly padded over, his gaze wandering down Harry’s golden tan legs and up again.

Malfoy’s gaze raises in a narrow glare, and Harry wipes the grin from his face and puts on an expression of,
can tell, you’re not cursed. However, with your permission, I can request various colleagues’ help. I know many Healers at St. Mungos—”
Harry tilts his head back as he attempts to take in dragon-Draco’s new figure. When Harry reaches out, he finds that Draco’s scales are warm, rather than cold. He circles Draco once, then twice.
It’s odd for Harry to think that he has become engaged to Draco so young. He has a sudden sense of connection with his parents.
Unfortunately, Draco has to grudgingly admit, Pansy is partially right. It’s not the visiting-the-thestrals that helps settle his magic, but the
Alice gulps. She knows that Mary’s family lives on Diagon Alley, but there isn’t a trace of injury on Mary, nor any ‘feeling’ of a wolf. “Mary, you’re back. It’s good to see that you’re well—”
Harry smiled, his eyes brightening. The pride on Harry’s face was clear to someone like Draco Malfoy, who had spent years studying Harry’s expressions.
Once everyone is in place, Draco arranges himself on Pansy’s lap, Potions text hovering over him—it’s about making potion variants of spells, but he’s charmed it to the NEWTs textbook.
Harry picks up Draco’s cold hand and slowly reaches out with his magic. “C’mon Draco, take it,” he mumbles.
“It’s not what it looks like,” Potter hastily says. “I just happen to bump into Malfoy in the middle of the Forest and—”
She remembers back when Draco would write such long letters and tell her everything about his day, including all the times he provoked Potter. But now, his letters are brief, and only about how the reconstruction is going. Draco’s key role in the reconstruction has changed his reputation, so a number of other families are now more willing to open marriage talks, but Draco completely ignores Narcissa’s subtle hints.
A large tray of raw beef appears. Harry’s about to mentally apologise to the house-elves when a house-elf appears in front of them.
Friday cannot come soon enough. Friday dinner in the Great Hall is loud, but that doesn’t stop Draco from making out the poisonous comments. It’s as though those students
Harry pours her a cup of coffee with a lot of sugar and milk, and he gets a big grateful look from Pansy. Meanwhile, Draco gets a disdainful look.
McGonagall rubs her forehead. “Yes, I thought so. I have sent some letters out to find a second set of Professors...Unfortunately, whether or not I can appoint them depends on the Ministry. As you may know, the Ministry has taken control over most of the Hogwarts Board.”
When they enter the Slytherin commons again, Potter quickly farewells Draco and heads over to Jamie and Michelle instead without a single look back.
Malfoy arrived at 5:55 pm on the dot outside the front door, once again dressed in dark blue robes. But this time, he had a wide, glass container in his hands with an opaque lid. Harry’s eyes were immediately drawn to it.
Draco glares at Aster, but Aster cheekily escapes. Huffing, Draco closes the door to Severus’s office and surveys the damage around them.
“You can’t do anything to him, Draco!” Harry’s brows draw together in distress. “If you do, the Ministry will definitely capture you! We...we should report this to McGonagall. She can handle it.” Harry’s eyes narrow. “I mean it, Draco! If the Aurors take you away, then what would happen to Slytherin?”
“You kids get away from here!” one wizard shouts at them. “This is a dangerous site! Don’t blame us if you get hurt!”
Harry’s attempt at being “mothering” dwarfs Draco’s “mothering”. Draco has to usher all the young students to bed before the two of them can go to bed themselves.
carry a bigger bouquet (and once Harry complains that he can’t), the two of them finally stroll, hand-in-hand, back towards the Slytherin Building.
At this point, they’ve now stopped at the clearing, and the bedding and blankets and pillows quickly build into an inviting nest.
Four days after Samhain is the night of the full moon. The third full moon since the Hogwarts year started.
Garren draws back from an oppressive feeling he doesn’t understand. Realising that, he sneers even more, voice a sharp hiss, “What did I tell you at the start of the year, Malfoy?
Garren smiles, straightening. “If any students would like to volunteer to help set up the Great Hall, please come to me tomorrow morning. That’s all, have a good evening.” Garren dismisses them, but stands there, watching. The lower years shift, but they don’t leave, glancing towards Draco.
Draco, being magnanimous, gave Harry a break while Draco focused on the muggle film. He was already imagining a full colour sequence of an artist’s impression (i.e., Draco’s impression) of that incident when Harry caught the snitch with his
was involved. He glances back at the corpse one last time, before pushing Harry out and resealing it. Even a dead basilisk is still dangerous.
Garren scans the Slytherin Commons, and turns his gaze back to Draco and his friends. “Call everyone down, I have some announcements and information about Halloween.”
And so, with trepidation, Harry went downstairs. He had just reached the kitchen door in a hunching crouch when the person inside turned.
They both freeze. They both unconsciously press their heads against Draco’s warm hands. Fuck, the two third years are still so
“Draco! I didn’t realise you were still around.” It was one of Draco’s old colleagues from International Relations.
The leader of the thestral herd neighs, a dismissal of Draco’s complaints and a firm rebuke to stop moving in one as she tilts one brilliant white eye towards Draco rather meaningfully. She ruffles her bony wings, clawed thumb glinting sharp.
Malfoy clicks his fingers and a large pile of papers appear in the air, falling neatly onto the palm of his hand. “Pansy, Blaise, and I will be working through this pile of papers that are
Also....I supposed it's a bit filler 😭 And this story is getting so long😭 I wanted to just hit my first 100k fic ever, but at this rate it’ll also be my first 150k…. I guess that’s “word saving”.
stay with your Gryffindor friends...But...” Draco reaches out and takes Harry’s hand. “I want you to stay with me.”
Harry feels gloomy thinking about it. He doesn’t have any magic left to do anything more, even if they only needed another 5%.
In commemoration of becoming a family of three (Draco is still incredulous), Draco decides to show Nolan his dragon form. So one day, out in the Forbidden Forest...
“We thought it would be appropriate for Valentines,” the Unspeakable who worked in the Love Room said.
While the Slytherins, the most of the Professors, and selected students from the other Houses work around the clock against the Wizengamot’s “
: *eyes deepen as he pushes the blankets and starts undressing Harry* Why don't I let you experience it personally?
Actually, seeing Draco mark things all the time has majorly put Harry off being a professor. He used to think that professors tortured students by setting long assignments, but now he realises they must be torturing
Pansy snaps into alertness as she also reads Narcissa’s message. “McGonagall’s floo,” she says quickly, jumping out of bed. “I’m coming with you.”
Draco is silent for a long while, before he says, “Where is this map now? Depending on how detailed it was, we could have used it to coordinate our movements. We could have avoided some altercations with the other Houses.”
“Very good!’ the Sorting Hat says loudly, breaking the silence. “Hahaha! Hogwarts has arisen! Hey, isn’t it time for your dinners?”
. How were they even slow to respond to that attack on Diagon Alley? It’s not like it was in the middle of nowhere!”
It would be better for Potter if the Slytherins reject him. It would be better for Slytherin to reject him. Draco is keenly aware of how the media will spin this. It won’t be
you don’t want to wear these? Draco would love you in them,” Pansy asks again, holding up some unmentionables.
It is safe to say that later, Draco will have to call the house-elves for a new dinner which the two of them will lovey-dovey-ly feed to each other before strolling back to the castle, hand in hand.
Potter’s eyes widen in horror, the red across his ears spreading. “It’s...not Malfoy?” His gaze darts to Draco and then quickly away again. “Woops?”
Harry rolls up his proverbial sleeves. He smiles winningly. “Thank you for reminding me how cute Nolan looks once a month…”
After a certain explicit Valentine’s Day event, Draco finds it hard to control himself, especially since Harry decides to be mischievous and
that is currently posting (it’s my favourite fest!! Important things need to be repeated many times~)
per-se, with the centaurs presiding over the area. But nonetheless, weaker. After all, during the War, the Death Eaters had managed to come here.
He tugged a few times, pulling himself to sufficient hardness. Then, he pushed the tip in. Slowly, he fed his cock into Harry’s slutty little hole.
they’re flinching. As Harry stares them down, the students leave, though not without backward glances.
He knows that, for all these things, he could ask Hogwarts to complete the changes and reconstruction. However, Hogwarts herself likes the students’ help. She probably finds it cute and sweet.
Lots of people give Harry advice when they find out that he’s not been to Sirius’s bedroom. About grieving. About moving on. About how
Regretfully, Harry says goodbye to the other Slytherins and trudges to the library with Ron and Hermione to do an assignment.
Hitchly smiles, but his jaw is tight and displeasure evident in his eyes. “In that case, why don’t we call in the Head of Slytherin, Professor Richard Garren?”
Potter looks away, clearing his throat. “Why do you keep on asking? I don’t want to hear Malfoy snore!”
Blaise leans forward with a charming smile. “The house-elves”—Granger stiffens—“are lovely beings who cater to the tastes and requirements of the students. I’m sure you know that the management of the house-elves at Hogwarts is far different from the treatment of house-elves in private homes.”
). Assuming that his NEWTs results go well, Draco plans to start a joint charms-potions mastery. Harry wants to volunteer in charity work in a ‘gap year’ that Draco suspects will last longer than just a year.
Professor Flitwick is one of the first visitors, brows pinching in worry. “Injured again, Mr. Malfoy.”
The young thestrals stop messing around and hurry forward in the right direction. Draco pats them and lets them go off to play with the young Slytherins and temporarily adopted young non-Slytherins. The Slytherins show the non-Slytherins how to play.
Draco narrows his eyes, grasping Harry’s shoulder and squeezing not nearly as hard as he wants. “Harry! Potter! Why did you accept? Don’t you realise they used you as bait?? What if Greyback caught you?!”
Hermione leans in close to Harry, lowering her voice. “What is up with your Slytherins? I heard some of them aren’t attending classes.” The judgement in her voice is audible, despite how she has tried to push it down.
Potter blinks again. Frowns. “I’m barely a month younger than you!” But he takes a sip of the hot chocolate anyway, so that’s a victory to Draco. “Oh. It’s actually hot chocolate.”
we can rebuild Hogwarts,” Draco says. “Hogwarts would rather accept if the students and staff rebuilt the castle, than some outsiders. In fact, there are many charms that would be suitable.”
that Nightshade wanted to fail the reconstruction, but that such behaviour would be too blatant and lead to his credibility suffering. As such, Nightshade could only swallow his grievances.
Harry feels every gentle touch of his fingers against his scalp. He’s afraid to touch his own hair now, in case the flower falls out.
Just like how Harry met with Malfoy every week, Harry would also have dinner with Hermione and Ron every week (not including Sundays at the Burrow).
And then after Gryffindor, they have to go to Ravenclaw Tower. The door is wide open, Flitwick and some Eighth Year Ravenclaws with him.
Gardiner freezes. “What?” Shakes her head. “It’s not fair. Acting like the War never happened. But oh, it
Blaise nods graciously and continues down Hogwarts’ halls. Hogwarts is slipping at each step, but he cannot hurry.
The Vice Minister, one of those belonging to the faction who presented the bill, takes over. “In consideration to the students, we will allow two weeks of grace…”
While some of the students are uneasy about that, the Slytherins are relaxed. Isn’t this similar to the Yule ritual? What’s so unusual about it?
The only incident of note are the Hufflepuffs lurking a corridor away from the Great Hall. A group of them, fifth to sixth years, all watch as the Slytherins approach.
By the weekend, Hermione is at wit’s end. Unlike those students, she’s absolutely sure that Malfoy did
Draco looks at Pansy over the heads of the third years bickering. But before they can attempt silent communication, the Hospital Wing doors open again, and Potter strides in, followed by his two sidekicks.
He never imagined that his mother—who is still under house arrest—would take the initiative to see him first, to the point of going through all the procedures to be able to visit Hogwarts.
“...Or I suppose you will become a Wizengamot member like your father,” Garren spouts, despite being perfectly aware that will be impossible for at least the next decade. He proceeds to name a number of Wizengamot members who could mentor Draco.
“Well, it’s not like we can grab a Slytherin for practice,” the first student replies. “Since Potter’s not doing Dumbledore’s Army anymore…”
The main organisers of the wedding are Draco, Narcissa Malfoy, Molly Weasley, and Minerva McGonagall. Narcissa wants to hold the wedding at Malfoy Manor while Molly wants to hold it at the Burrow. With neither budging, Draco successfully asks Minerva to hold the wedding at Hogwarts during the summer holidays instead.
That evening in bed, once the lights are out, Harry says, “You don’t seem to like Charlie very much. I thought since he likes dragons and
Harry uses the bathroom first. When he’s done, Draco enters the bathroom, while Harry gets into bed on his usual side. The mattress has the same springiness as the big bed, so it doesn’t feel too unfamiliar. The bedding is new though and doesn’t smell quite the same.
Harry’s head felt dizzy. His cheeks were burning. Standing so close like this, Harry could smell a deeply masculine scent. It made him uncomfortable like he wanted to squirm and adjust his trousers.
Draco pulled his fingers out. Harry’s hole clenched down at the sudden emptiness. He wanted to be filled again, quickly!
Unlike the Yule ritual, there is no blood sacrifice. Instead, as McGonagall says the first set of ritual words, she spins her magic in with the natural magic of the Earth. “We are of Hogwarts, standing on this earth…”
With Felicity on surveillance, Pansy affixes a scenery portrait on the wall. Inside the portrait is a pensieve.
—Hogwarts is listening to students’ idle wishes. Draco suspects that a lot of the items Hogwarts produces comes from its Room of Hidden Things.
Draco returns to his dinner, his gaze indulgent upon the once-again squabbling Harry and Nolan. Some things just don’t change.
have damage control with your friends.” Draco glanced over at his colleagues. “And I have questions to fend off.”
Harry’s perpetual cuteness made Draco want to simultaneously eat him up and hug him tightly. “Oh? You desire to frot like this and come in our pants? As long as you allow me to take a shower later.”
,” Pansy says. She rushes over to Draco’s side, helping him up. “Professor Flitwick, sir, Draco’s sick. May I…”
His ears flick back and forth, picking up the sounds of the Forest. There are the other werewolves...he doesn’t want to play with them though.
It’s a piece of clothing, sparks of magic tingling up Draco’s fingers the moment he touches it. Draco can
“Harry, would you like your own publishing company? It will be straightforward to set one up. I have a friend who will help.”
“Don’t forget to clean up first,” Draco reminds them, looking pointedly at their abandoned, finished picnic.
He’s in the middle of Potions. He doesn’t care, because the stupid Gryffindors are backmouthing Mr Malfoy and Harry Potter and werewolves and he
“Shit about being an obedient little boy,” Draco curls his upper lip. Or rather, Garren had called him a
Das continues to sip her tea and transfigure more tiny chairs. Michelle copies, producing little wooden chairs and little stone chairs and little paper chairs from the materials they have been given.
The foundational stone of Hogwarts starts to float as it absorbs all the magic given to it. It starts to emit a low hum, both magical and physical.
the first time others have come too: Harry and Nolan and Pansy and Blaise and Francis Mallow and Alice Mistle and some other students who would prefer not to go home for the Winter Break (although for Francis Mallow at least, he may end up being pseudo-adopted into the family of his best friend, Alyss Singh).
Such a big matter and yet his mother hasn’t sent him a letter? She has definitely read the news by now...does she not believe it? Or does she not mind?
Harry had the tiniest shred of mind left to clench down, feeling that tiny shot of power when both Charlie and Draco groaned.
“Yes,” Malfoy looked back, capturing Harry in his gaze. Harry felt himself getting lost in those eyes. His knees felt weak.
That Malfoy didn’t answer is very, very suspicious. It’s going to require all of Harry’s skills to obtain the answers.
Silence grows. Harry has already planned to see Hermione and Ron again on Saturday for another House Unity meeting. He doesn’t have anything new to say to them.
Yes, there was some bad-mouthing of Slytherin, but who hasn’t done that? Why, back in the day, her, Ron and and Harry had done the same thing. Harry used to
More than once, Nolan runs to flop on Draco’s lap, only to run again with the other younger students a few minutes later.
Slowly, his friends drifted into partnerships or other romantic entanglements. He still had them, but more often than not, he had them
After seeing how good Malfoy’s relationship is with his two friends, a small bitter regret grows in Harry’s heart. Why did he re-sort himself? Malfoy clearly doesn’t need another friend…
Potter’s eyes go hard. “House affiliation is more flexible than people think. Everyone else should think twice.”
At the familiar, cold edge of the Forest, Madam Pomfrey starts handing out Wolfsbane. “Take your last potion, now, dears. The full moon will come soon…”
“Nothing to be worried about, sir.” Draco attempts a charming Blaise-style smile. It fails dismally.
Harry has fallen to his knees, ‘protected’ by a single Auror. What happened to Harry’s badge?! Or has it all been used up already?!
The Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt rubs his forehead tiredly. “No, arresting him won’t help.”
Harry grimaces, glancing again at the difference between the stag and the dragon. “Yes, well, you can’t expect me to hold a mandrake leaf in my mouth during the engagement party, do you?”
Meanwhile, to outsiders: Harry appears to be getting redder and redder. He also starts hugging himself.
The corner of Malfoy’s lips twitched. “I said nothing,” he said mildly. “These paintings seem somewhat familiar. Who is the artist?”
But Harry didn’t know this. Harry was just happy to have another friend. But if Harry found out about Malfoy’s feelings...what would happen?
“But his parents want him to go back,” Alyss says, with a dark expression. “I bet they’re going to be mean, they’re not worthy to be parents!”
Despite Nolan’s bravado, he flinches reflexively. But instead of the expected outcome, someone jumps in front of him.
The problem is that most plans have been completely upended by the War and its aftermath. Many Slytherin families fled England altogether. The ones who stayed are either stubborn, prepared to wait for a better future, or unable to leave. But businesses have gone bankrupt, connections with masters of various fields now tenuous at best.
Draco would have told you to. Madam Pomfrey, now that Draco is safe, you may wish to examine the health of the intruders. They might have suffered internal and external burns due to dragon fire and extensive bruising from being slammed by a dragon tail and falling onto the ground..”
Hermione casts until she can’t cast anymore. Zabini’s method seems to work. When the house-elf comes to call them to eat, Hermione lets out a huge tired sigh, scanning the area for Harry. She knows that Harry and Malfoy went off together a while ago.
Harry’s lips twitched. “Aren’t you older than me? Should you be the one to read?” Also, if Harry wanted to read, he would need to pull his arms out of his burrito blanket.
After Flitwick leaves, Draco and Felicity return to Slytherin. Everyone is back, even Harry, who’s in the corner with Blaise and Jamie doing who knows what.
“Thank you, I’ll keep all of this in mind,” Draco says insincerely once Garren finishes his little speech.
their bedroom. Harry’s brows furrow in confusion. Instead of seeing a room with two beds, four desks, four wardrobes, there is a small room with two sofas, and two doors.
Draco grumbles with annoyance when an entire cluster of thestrals bump their heads against his, making little chuffing sounds. They nudge at his limbs.
the Ministry that this will happen if Slytherin is removed? Does that mean the Wizengamot wanted to tear down Hogwarts altogether? Everyone knows that the relationship between Hogwarts and the Ministry has always been a bit rocky.
“Professor Sprout would be concerned if her Hufflepuffs were skipping dinner,” Draco drawls. He shrugs one shoulder. “As you wish.”
Hogwarts’ magic hums under his fingertips. There’s a sensation of sliding, pulsing magic. Multicoloured lines and patterns of spells spread outward in Draco’s eyes from his fingers. He feels as though he should
Draco conjures a picnic blanket and folds his legs gracefully to sit, tucking his robes carefully around his legs. “I find that small children like hot chocolate when it gets dark.”
Blaise’s fingers trail across the wall, his eyes charmingly soft as though he’s talking to a younger student.
needed to know more. It was surprising. Harry hadn’t felt this urge to catch up with old mates—or enemies—before.
Parkinson pouts. “I can’t believe neither of you like me. Hmpf, I’m off to have fun with Felicity then.”
Higher ceilings, a new mezzanine floor, and the walls further apart. Harry never knew that rooms could grow like this in Hogwarts, aside from the Room of Requirement.
That evening, many major papers released a special issue all about the removal of Slytherin from Hogwarts. Rumours say that the vote was unanimous! Rumours say that all Slytherin students will be expelled! Rumours say that the Slytherin dungeons will be destroyed!
Draco twists Harry’s magic with his and with what’s left of Hogwarts to form new pillars, to block the leakage from the Black Lake into the castle…
Jamie nods and writes everything down very seriously, even the “fireman pole” suggestion that he doesn’t understand.
In fact, Draco had not expected how much worrying about the Slytherins during class before had impacted him, how he keeps reflexively checking the bonds in his chest. He doesn’t have to do that as much anymore.
“I’ll take over your duties for the morning, Draco,” Blaise says. “You two go ahead. Pansy, remember to tell me everything afterwards.”
“Yes.” Draco records down the names of the students who do not want to return to their parents or relatives for the Winter Break and assures all of them that he’ll personally write a letter.
Harry makes a face. “I know.” He slumps. “Anyway, I was planning to hang out with Hermione and Ron after dinner, we have some Magical Creatures work to do.”
Now that Draco has legally adopted so many children, he decides it's time to reveal (show off) his dragon form. It's a day full of fun and games, and Draco posing confidently for the camera.
had to name the victim. All the better to know a potential future werewolf of the bastard had the luck to survive, despite the fact that it
Milly is very good. Upon summoning them dinner, all the plates and silverware and glasses are laid out perfectly. On a trolley that appears beside them are a number of silver-cloche covered plates and a crystalline jar of pomegranate Assam. Draco levitates the jar over first, pouring each of them a drink, before uncovering the first cloche. He serves Harry and himself at the same time, layering each component on their plates.
teach Defence tomorrow with Felicity, and you can work on your Defence paper then. I’m good at teaching defence. You even had it as one of my career options.”
A thestral nudges it boney head into Draco’s side. Draco bares his big sharp teeth back, but the thestral is undeterred, and a couple of other colts and fillies trot over to Draco’s warmth.
He was halfway across the room when he suddenly froze. Extremely slowly, his head turned to the excellent male specimen currently reclining on his bed.
Harry’s lips twitch. “You’re such a prat,” he finally says. “Shouldn’t you work harder so that I have more time to do homework?”
“Not yet,” Malfoy smiled reassuringly. “Bronze is for boyfriends, silver for engagement, and gold for marriage.”
“Er—no. There’s some—er—family heirloom-y thing. Yes! A family heirloom thing. Can’t remember, I need to take a look.”
Draco pulls out the chair for Harry to sit. The table is round, with a round tablecloth with white-on-white embroidery. There is nothing on the table at first. It’s only once both of them sit down that cutlery, filled cups, and the first course appears.
Her eyes sweep over the onlookers. “I hope that everyone will work together towards this goal. Unspeakable Nightshade will be in charge of the fine details of the reconstruction. He is an expert in magical architecture, including past work in enhancing the Ministry building. Unspeakable Nightshade, if you may.”
Minister Shacklebolt’s gaze is sombre but sharp. Under his eyes, the Ministry team can only be obedient as the panel of magical theorists examine their work.
Pansy flicks Draco on the forehead. “Don’t tease Harry like that!” She pulls Harry onto the bed and maneuvers him so that he’s sandwiched between her and Draco.
“Pfftt, that’s because you’re afraid of change!” Another theorist retorts. “Instead, you should have a new fourth house to balance things!”
“Did you spend last night doing evil?” a sweet little voice belonging to Jamie says with curiousity.
Draco is doing his work in the Slytherin Commons when his pupils suddenly constrict into narrow slits.
want to come inside me and fill me up and make me yours forever and ever? To ruin me for any other person?” His fingertips nudge against his perineum.
Harry wonders into Gringotts, whistling innocently, hands behind his back. The alarm still goes off, but Harry cheerfully greets Ralak, Gorgo, and Snorklog.
Potter smiles. “Okay.” He cheekily summons his broom and hangs up a lightning-shaped bauble right near the top of the tree.
To his surprise, some of the Slytherins are waiting for him in the Commons. In particular, the younger years with their wide, worried eyes.
Nonetheless, the other students hear, as they all have enhanced werewolf abilities. Dark looks and rolled eyes are sent their way, though truthfully those looks are more mild than the daggers of the first full moon back in September.
Once he’s far away enough, he transforms into his dragon form and stretches his wings into the air. Sounds of animals and creatures paint a rich sound landscape, shadows scattering as Draco glides through the trees.
Malfoy comes striding over, a striking figure in his robes, a silhouette that has really grown on Harry.
Malfoy blinked slowly. He slowly reached out for the wand case, his fingers lightly brushing against Harry’s. Harry quickly let go.
There's a new rumour about the Slytherins lately...that if you want you-know-what (snacks), then just ask one of them.
In contrast to the exuberance of the students coming out charms class over these few days, the air around the rebuilding site is grim.
“I’m just practicing my Defence Against the Dark Arts,” Draco smirks. “If you get hit by your own spell...how
“He was my godfather,” Draco snaps. He hates the way Garren is looking at his Slytherins. “Get out.”
Instead, one of them, clearly the leader, tells the Aurors, “Of course, we heard rumours of a wild dragon at Hogwarts. An unregistered dragon animagus who is also a dark wizard. You all must know our mission to cleanse Britain from dark wizards, Aurors. We are deeply sorry for accidentally damaging Hogwarts during our attempt to subdue the dangerous dragon.”
Harry’s voice cuts. A flush spreads, and a pink tongue darts out, wet and provocative against Draco’s thumb.
Pansy makes a grumpy expression. “I wish you told me though, Draco! I wanted to wipe that arsehole’s face too!”
“I hope you can figure out which ring is yours, dear Harry,” Draco drawls. His lips curl up at Harry’s dazed look. It makes him want to reach over and pinch his cheek. After some deep thinking, he has decided on this quiet proposal, all the better to see Harry’s expressions. He’ll throw the gigantic engagement party later.
Slytherins, one-by-one, tentatively approach the docile thestrals. Draco shows how playful the younger ones can be, by conjuring up various equestrian jumping obstacles. It is good that the two sides are getting to know each other. This way, they can help each other if Draco is not available.
Staring at their patterns which never meet, Draco’s lips curl in distaste, hot smoke wisping into the air. It would be much too easy for the two of them to take each other out.
While the children had been clustered around the tree, Harry is sitting, knees pulled up, on a sofa by the fire pit.
The thestral Harry is on tilts its head a little and starts to trot around them. Harry grins. “You can’t stop us from walking!”
“It is not a problem,” Draco insists coolly. “Lately, there have been no more attacks on the Slytherins. I am merely a final protective measure. And at the end of the school year, the bonds should naturally fade.”
Preservation charms over the tables of food are removed and mulled drinks passed out. Some of it is magically burned for the ghosts to partake.
,” Draco says sternly. But at least this shows that she’s relatively okay. He sighs. “I should have put my foot down. I shouldn’t have trusted Coates…”
“Hopefully he can do something…” Hermione says, a little unconvinced. Catching Harry’s expression, she says, “Just because he used to be a senior Auror doesn’t mean he’s in control of them
In the Great Hall that morning, Professor McGonagall sits with the slightest slump in her chair, resisting the urge to rub her eyes tiredly.
my trial too,” he adds. “You...have my utmost gratitude.” The words grate out of Draco’s mouth. He hates feeling so in-debt to Potter just as much as he hates apologising. But...needs must.
By Saturday morning, virtually the entire country knows what has happened. The news is all over the papers and all over the Wireless.
“Very well,” he says. “You may remain in the Commons, and I’ll request your professors for any work.”
“The Unspeakable meddled,” McGonagall says in a cold tone. “He maliciously casted a spell to sever a part of Slytherin, and the backlash sent a shock through the entirety of Hogwarts. I have already alerted Kingsley, but that won’t turn back time.”
Harry takes a few steps towards them, looking towards the thestral leader. “Um, if you’re looking for Draco, he’s not here…”
It is one of Draco’s jobs to give it all a push. With McGonagall directing Hogwarts’ internal magic, the Slytherin building starts to move, inch by inch.
“Ah, perfect, you’ve all finished. Potter, we’re starting our NEWTs study now,” Malfoy’s voice comes from behind him.
“Hm, hot chocolate and cookies, children can’t resist that,” Draco says, ruffling Harry’s hair. A tingling feeling spreads over Harry’s scalp. He ducks his head.
,” Draco says with the lightest sigh. “And neither would using Legilimency to forcefully break patterns of thought. Morals are quite restrictive.”
, Draco scoffs. Better to let her believe that. He’s not offering her anymore information, especially when she’s not letting him leave.
“As the wand that killed Voldemort, and you the man who did it, it is not a problem.” Malfoy didn’t even open the case to check; he immediately tucked it up his sleeve which didn’t have any bulge despite the item being placed up there.
Blaise rests a hand against a wall of Hogwarts. Its physical structural integrity has weakened where Harry’s magic had pushed out, and its magical integrity has suffered damage.
At dinner, McGonagall announces Hufflepuff’s win. After allowing the Hufflepuff table to cheer, she then adds, “And Slytherin House keeps their win against Gryffindor.”
sound as he settled deeper under the covers, the deepening of his breath. Draco set the alarm that he already knew Harry was going to sleep through and checked the wards. Then, he tucked his head against Harry’s and finally allowed himself to relax and sleep, too.
Thinking about Harry, he takes a deep breath. “I’m marrying him, Mother. As for our children...we’ll figure it out ourselves.”
“At best, Hogwarts would appear sentient in the way a smart computer does to someone who doesn’t know how it works,” Hermione says to Harry. “And
Ron chokes. Harry, the good friend he is, thumps Ron soundly on the back until Ron’s able to breathe again.
He jolted out of his own reverie. 1800! Six! PM! Oh, there were so many things to prepare! Harry brandished his wand and attacked his home with cleaning charms.
With the three of them, Pansy’s moved into the boys Eighth Year dorm, and Blaise's transfigured the two beds into a giant one. They didn’t sleep together before the War. But Draco’s glad for their company now.
“That’s because I’m Harry Potter, right? Once everyone hears my name, they forget that I’m a halfblood. People forget that Voldemort was a halfblood too.” Harry scoffs at the irony.
The thrusts all increased in intensity. Harry couldn’t hold himself up any longer, collapsing onto Charlie, body limp, a cock sleeve for Draco and Charlie to pump into.
Nolan is a bit uncomfortable now, he wants to go and move about too. But...he’s not going to leave Mr Malfoy alone with Potter.
He and Draco had talked about maybe bringing Charlie in, but he didn’t expect it to be in the morning when Draco liked to fuck him awake!
Harry’s eyes grew even rounder, framed by his round black glasses. “D-date?” he squeaked again. “Then-then, does that mean there’s going to be a
Because it is day time, Draco doesn’t fly above the canopy. Instead, he winds his way between the tall dark trees of the Forest in a loopy pathway to the thestrals glade. He lands near the glade’s center with a thud.
It’s obvious that Potter has more secrets. Does Potter somehow have a seeing mirror of some kind? Or surveillance charms down here that Draco doesn’t know about?
It will not take long before the last top floors are put in and the pointed roofs are tiled. That may have been his last time in McGonagall’s temporary office before she can move back into the castle.
Their eyes meet and hold. Malfoy’s grey eyes seem to be looking deep into Harry. Harry looks back, unafraid. What he wants most is for all his friends to get along.
Alice nods without saying anything. She and the other Gryffindor exit, silently walking down to the Hogwarts front door where the others await them.
Harry grinned, his eyes soft. “I didn’t exactly plan this.” He leaned in. “I just hoped.” He stepped on Draco’s toe, so Draco manhandled him into place.
Granger glares at him. She takes a deep breath, and says in a forced, even tone, “Then we need to practice control, Harry. Come, I can find some books for you.”
“What’s that expectant expression?” he says. “I can go see the thestrals whenever I want.” He smiles a fake soft smile. “If you missed them, Harry, just tell me and I’ll accompany you.”
“That must be where they are,” Felicity says, quickly recovering her composure. She points her wand and casts.
“I know. However, your duel has had adverse effects on Hogwarts. You conducted a Yule ritual, didn’t you?”
“Perhaps it’s because you stink like a Gryffindor. And who else has the habit of stalking old archenemies?”
Harry follows with an evil grin. “Not in public, Malfoy.” Ends up with a face full of Malfoy’s robes.
“That’s right, eat your damned breakfast,” he tells it, patting the beast. Draco looks up in time to see all the other foals heading back to him. Another one starts nosing his hair too. They all want him to hand feed them! Much aggrieved, he grabs another piece of meat for the next thestral.
Harry accepted the spice gingerbread one, but nudged the chocolate one back to Draco. “You have one too.”
By the time Harry makes it downstairs, the doorway to Slytherin Commons is opening, with Madam Pomfrey in her nightclothes being urged along by Harley and Nolan. Not far behind them is Pansy.
Filius quickly relays what he knows as the two of them work side-by-side to clean up the mess. Unfortunately, the paintings this close to the Kitchens are still life and landscapes. There is no portrait they can question.
He wants Harry to be able to smile and laugh. This business with Hogwarts should never have happened, but it’s too late.
Especially when Dumbledore testifies for you in his will. Especially when Harry Potter asks for leniency on your behalf…
Draco lets out swirls of white smoke in exhilaration. He’ll have to work on silent apparition, but he’s well pleased. He flies as fast as he can and performs dives, apparating again just before he hits the canopy, and scaring another flock of flying creatures. He emerges out high in the sky above the Forest.
woods, and as a child, Malfoy would go there all the time with the house elves while his parents were busy
Malfoy sighs again and takes Harry’s arm. Before Harry can smell Malfoy’s cologne, they’re apparating and landing down somewhere in Muggle London. The streets are fairly crowded; and Malfoy takes him to a Japanese restaurant.
One daft thestral tries to loop-de-loop around Draco’s tail. What happens is a mess of thestral and dragon wings, forcing Draco to hastily nudge the thestral upright. There’s a disapproving
Harry must have made an involuntary sound because Malfoy quickly turned back to him. Something flickered in his liquid silver eyes as he gazed down at Harry.
“My two friends can confirm it,” Draco pityingly grants him. “Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini were both sleeping with me.”
else that appears during the building process that is not supposed to be there. Something is interfering.
The bonds in Draco’s chest all ease. Garren’s last hold on the Slytherins have dissipated in his utter defeat in Draco’s hands.
Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multilayer Perceptron are different machine learning algorithms (different algorithms are suited to different data and predictions)
And as for Harry, he felt like he was surrounded by warmth and safety. He felt that, with Draco, he was no longer afraid of anything.
Students have to do a self-chosen research project for both the muggle studies class and the magical culture class. For the magical culture project, Harry decides to finally read up pureblood courting rituals. In hindsight, he’s glad he dodged that particular
“The news spread fast, and it wasn’t even me,” Pansy says. “What are you planning to tell your mum?”

It’s a bright and sunny morning, and it’s already shaping up to be a no good, horrible day. His cupboards are bare, his fridge dismal (he could
The portraits have fled towards the ends of the corridor. Other Slytherins have gathered along the corridor. And Aster and a number of others are watching from Severus’s office door.
all doing here?” He raises one eyebrow at the way the group of Ravenclaws jump back from the statue base they were messing with.
Draco clenched his teeth against the groan of pleasure and frustration and forced himself to pull out a bit before thrusting shallowly back in.
“That’s right, you shouldn’t say it directly, as the Ministry-affiliates can hear,” Draco says. “Instead, you should comment on, say, how lucky the castle collapsed now. If it collapsed after students entered, the Ministry would be destroyed by the public!”

She lets him go. The two of them head into the Great Hall, he to the Slytherin table and her up to the Professor’s table.
With a grunt, Gardener swings to face them properly, hand making an aborted movement to her wand. “Stop
Draco shuffles the names around in his mind, and summons some parchment for the updated schedule of the next day. With some of the older students out of action, he’ll have to stretch the guard detail for the younger kids.
“Do you know what our son just told me?” Narcissa says angrily. She doesn't give time for Lucius to respond. She tells him all the accusations Draco had thrown at them, and how the Dark Lord had experimented on their own son.
In Draco’s opinion, it is much better for Slytherin House to make the first claim of independence. And he has done exactly that.
In the afternoon, Minerva has tea with Irma Pince in Irma’s quarters. As the Headmistress, Minerva is particularly sensitive to the fluctuations at Hogwarts. But what she doesn’t know is whether there is any precedent.
“Ugh—Draco,” Harry gasped, pulling away. His skin was flush, eyes blown wide. Lips bitten red and so, so enticing. He licked his lips. Draco wanted to lick them for him.
The corridors are quiet on the early Sunday morning, Draco doesn't meet anyone while walking Harry to McGonagall's office, and he doesn't meet anyone on the way back.
It’s cold—October in Scotland, of course. But Draco doesn’t feel the chill, not with the fire-warmth in his belly.
There’s really no need for Draco to look. His magic spreads out, brushing lightly against Hogwarts’ magic.
Jamie’s eyes light up. “Merry Christmas, sir!” He scrambles to his feet, dragging Michelle up too. “You go wake the girls!” And then he races up the stairs to the dormitories.
The theorists continue to discuss, which Nightshade only listens with one ear. He tucks his hands in his robes, slowly moving his wand under the cover of his sleeves.
“You’re so focused on my cock, did you even notice that your big brother Charlie Weasley is watching you?”
“I understand sacrificing one for the many. You told me I needed to take responsibility for Slytherin’s reputation.”
After working with Malfoy on occasion at the Ministry, she also knew that Malfoy typically disdained the company of others. He would attend various functions out of duty, but he wouldn’t go out of his way to have dinner with someone every week unless he held them in high esteem.
In fact, Blaise has long known that Draco’s action of separating Slytherin from Hogwarts is not entirely possible in the sense that Hogwarts is meaningless and non-existent without Slytherin.
The rest of the world comes rushing back in as Malfoy tugs Harry towards the far doors. His strides are long, and Harry has to trot, lest Malfoy ends up dragging him along.
Harry meets Draco’s eyes, and Draco smoothly stands next to him, wrapping a possessive arm around Harry’s shoulder and pulling him closer, before dropping his arm. “He’s coming back to Slytherin with me.”
Hermione gives a sigh of relief. “Finally!” she says. “Never mind lunch today,” she says knowingly (what the heck does she know that Harry doesn’t?). “
Harry smirks. “Hey, you ate it. If you didn’t like it, you should have let Draco enjoy more of it. You should thank Draco for sharing it with you!”
“...You do realise that the people behind some of your favourite things are ex-Slytherins...I didn’t want to say, but did you know at all?”
. Nolan wasn’t afraid  of the orbs, which bolstered the confidence of the other third years too, and Draco had thought that the biggest danger was in the corridors, where Professors aren’t watching.
And did Harry learn his lesson about annoying people? Not at all, since it has worked out mind-blowingly well with Draco. Literally.
Draco resizes the Slytherin Banner from its small portable size to its proper size. He goes up the stage and levitates the Slytherin banner back into place.

“Then maybe I am a bastard, but I would prefer if you cried now instead of later,” Draco says. “My much-too-large-hearted Gryffindor.”
Harry looks over his shoulder. “I’ll be alright, and I hope you’ll help me,” he tells Granger and Weasley.
Harry wants to ask Luna more. He’s just about to, except he catches Ron and Hermione looking at him, then looking at
Draco pats his head. “Go have breakfast, you third years will have your potions class with me later.”
“...Are you implying that the only way I can win against you in a seeker-versus-seeker match is to have a snitch that will always find me?”
If he can’t have the date in the rose gardens, then where else? Hogsmeade is so passe and not even worth considering. As for other places...
After dinner, Jamie takes the lead in taking out the Card-Fight game. Now that there are more players, there needs to be more cards made. The students really like the silver-eyed white dragon, but Harry insists that it’s too special to make a second copy, so someone made a red-eyed black dragon instead, and someone else makes a black-eyed green dragon.
The air is cold, and Draco’s warm breath condenses into visible water vapour. It looks like he’s exhaling white smoke.
Sometimes, but not often, Harry used to sleep—just sleep—in Draco’s bed. Short naps, where Draco was just a warm body, a state of sleeping Harry had been used to before he and his latest partner broke up. And some of those times, Harry would hold Draco in his arms, and Draco would pretend that Harry wanted him, instead of missing someone else.
Malfoy’s lips twitch. He sweeps a hand towards the exit. “Now, shall we return to the Great Hall for lunch? Or I can call some house-elves to provide us with a meal here.”
Harry very carefully plucks a white rose too. He sheepishly gives it to Draco to deal with the thorns, but it’s Harry who puts it into Draco’s hair.
Slowly, the transformation settles. Draco leaps into the air, wings beating hard. He breaks through the tree canopy, up into the brilliant grey-white of the sky that tastes a little like freedom.
” Hermione casts immediately. Ron follows a second later. Brilliant blue cuts between glass and the other students walking by the Hourglasses at the wrong time.
Under this ‘peer pressure’, Draco rolls his eyes and transforms. Unlike the first transformation, this one is smooth and easy.
“Anyway, what more things do you want me to add to my list to tell Mr Zabini to add to the new Hogwarts?” Jamie continues.
It only starts to get concerning when they’re still not back as Feast—a late lunch, effectively—approaches. Aster sends a message on the badges:
But it’s too late. By the time the smoke clears, Greyback and his accursed crew—those not yet tied up either by the Aurors—are gone.
As you can see in the results, the accuracy and f1-score ultimately achieved is much greater than this!
thinking about that. He already sacrificed himself once. But now, there are things, people, holding him back. He would have so much regret if he did. But wouldn’t he also regret it if they didn’t reinforce Hogwarts enough, if they reached 95% and only needed another 5%, yet left to have dinner and relax?
“Give me some peace to heal!” he mutters when Pomfrey casts a particular prickly healing spell on him. “How is Aster?”
The goblin makes a face. “I see Malfoy’s ugly face everyday. Of course we like the bastard. If we didn’t, he’d
the eyes of the past Heads of Hogwarts. Portrait Dumbledore’s eyes have no sparkle, to Draco’s great satisfaction.
Robards gnashes his teeth. “You Aurors! Don’t you think we have enough on our hands? If you have so much free time running around like this, I’ll assign you an extra daily shift!! And you! Auror Hitchly, you are now suspended for a week, pending further review!”
“There is still some time before dinner. We can start on the ground floor immediately,” Blaise says, smiling. He turns to Nolan and Harley. “Why don’t you go and ask the fourth years to meet us at Slytherin?”
“The Forbidden Forest is the best place to keep secrets,” Draco adds softly, like he’s coaxing one of the first years. He casts a privacy charm around them and awaits patiently.
Portrait-Severus has not shown up in any of the Slytherin Common’s paintings. He hasn’t even shown up in his old rooms that Draco hijacked for Slytherin use.
Not long after, the students emerge from the forest, dressed and awake. One of the students, a Gryffindor named Alice Mistle, looks around uneasily as she sniffs the air.
“If you didn’t notice them sleeping closer together before, it must be that they did it recently in order to mess with you,” Hermione says.
Harry makes a face and decisively closes the book. “If I need to follow them, I’ll just hire a consultant,” he decides.
There are also many Ministry officials, and many people that Draco recognised from the society events his parents held—these people all count as alumni of Hogwarts.
Harry is a little dazed as he wakes up on the weekend. It feels cold. He reaches out and pulls a duvet over him. Does the bed feel emptier than normal?
Okay, not a spoiler, if you want to know what I based Draco’s dragon abilities on, see my drarry fic
Hermione internally facepalms. “Okay, I’ll help you.” She better also make clear notes so that Harry can follow, because she can already envision other students and children getting adopted by Harry…
than a human. Those with animagus forms larger than their physical human form are extremely rare due to the extreme magical requirements. If you have studied Arithmancy with Professor Sinistra, you will know that magic equals mass times the magical constant squared  (𝔐=m·𝖒
Charlie’s movements were slow and methodical. He rubbed his hands over Harry’s skin first and stroked Harry’s cock. He summoned lube, even though the lube and come in Harry’s hole was more than enough.
The letter confirms that his father has woken up. Aurors have also arrived at Malfoy Manor—not due external reports, but because Malfoy Manor is currently monitored due to Lucius’s house arrest, and they eventually noticed a suddenly large influx of people on the property.
McGonagall’s expression doesn’t change. “Then you must know that all animagi must be registered with the Ministry. With this matter in the media, someone from the Ministry will come to check.”
Blood drains from Hitchtly’s face. He suddenly notices a second document inside the folder. “Wait, what is this?”
In what will be the Great Hall, Draco is working alongside other Eighth Years—including Pansy and Harry and Granger and Weasley and Longbottom and Abbot and the two Patils, other Head of Houses, McGonagall, and Hogwarts.
related to either Solicitor Malfoy or Mr Potter. In the days just before Christmas, it wasn’t worth it! There were better low-lying fruits to write about!
Down at the Great Hall, after waving to Draco across the Hall, Harry sits with Ron and Hermione, along with Neville and Ginny to catch up with them.
Garren’s eyes immediately darken when he sees Draco, but he pulls a forced smile when Blaise greets him.
In contrast to the embittered energy at the Ministry, students at Hogwarts are preparing for the Ravenclaw vs. Slytherin Quidditch match. The turnout is larger than usual.
“Actually, we were thinking of taking some school brooms to maybe go flying, if Mr Potter could supervise us?” Jamie asks, turning wide eyes at Harry.
Harry looked down at the body-that-was-his, staring at the way the skin on his stomach bulged. “I can’t, I can’t, look, it’s bulging.”
Draco pinches the bridge of his nose. “You’re a terrible influence, Harry.” He doesn’t think Harry did it on purpose, but the other Slytherins certainly know that Draco’s trying
Blaise laughs as he slides into bed with them. “I suppose I must stay too then, lest Draco commits another faux-pas.”

...But he also knows that obliviation is not perfect, due to the distributed nature of memory storage in the brain.
level.” But she’s hesitant now. Angered and annoyed at Draco, sure, but not actively cursing him. “Why aren’t you fighting back?”
While Draco and Harry were basically PDA’ing without actual kissing, Hermione looked at her own partner who was wholeheartedly eating and had completely forgotten their original intent to see whether or not Draco was suitable for their
Oh yeah, Draco probably went to see the thestrals over the weekend, but like since it's not important to the plot right now I haven't shown it here~ 😂
They proceed through each common area—where all the four houses’ magic are intertwined, and where Draco’s magic has been replacing some of Slytherin’s. Behind them, Blaise leaves a magical ruin that only a few can see.
do. We do not repeat mistakes, neither our own, nor those of other Houses. If you provoke them, what would be the outcome?”
Under the joint hard work of Madame Pomfrey and the two Slytherin fourth years Aster and Mesa, all the werewolf students have taken their week’s worth of Wolfsbane. Due to the Slytherin Building’s location near to the Forbidden Forest, it’s easy to walk out.
And she knows another point that Granger doesn’t: the glass used in the orbs are muggle-formed, rather than magically made. That’s one of the reasons why Draco can crush them so easily.
In this report, we used machine learning to predict the authors on the anonymous fics of the Harry/Draco Fan Fair 2019. We were able to predict approximately
“I don’t know why,” Harry says slowly. “But I know that Malfoy didn’t cast the first spell. Garren wasn’t even injured...only Malfoy was.”
“How did he expect us to clean everything in just one night without our wands?!” Nolan bursts out. “He’s just jealous of us! What’s the point of Filch anyway? The house-elves do a much better job of everything!”
“If we made different decisions, the world would be really different…” Thinking about it more deeply though makes Harry’s mood go down. “If I had known everything I do now, if I could return to when I was eleven…”
Draco immediately sat up, his eyes suddenly becoming a little wolfish (dragonish?). “Kiss,” he said with a wicked curl of his lips.
for Malfoy to come over, but he felt that he didn’t have time to properly analyse Malfoy when he was pressing him against the wall on the street.
Malfoy presses a hand on the growling werewolf’s head, drawing them close. “Potter, do you know the date?”
. Moved closer. Other hand rising to cup Harry’s cheek, to tug aside his glasses for a moment. Lips pressed in.
—Thinking about the fading bonds causes Draco’s mood to return from its high back to normal, thus corresponding with the Slytherins going to bed on time again.
This time, Draco is successful in cajoling Potter back to Hogwarts castle. They separate at the front door, as Potter ascends to Gryffindor Tower by himself.
Dennis smiles. “I know you’re still good, Harry, no matter what others say.” He pulls out a spherical object, glittery glass and metal. “
, he wanted it too. He squirmed, pushing his hips up to deepen the penetration. He moaned when Draco slapped his arse.
Sometimes, Draco hated Harry’s day job. Yes, it had become better now that he was the Head Auror and not out in the field. At the same time, though, it made Harry a greater target. These scenes helped Harry, but Draco needed them too: a time when he could do everything in his power to keep Harry close.
“As for whether the non-human component is draconic, this needs to be cross-referenced with dragon blood.”
cushioning charms, Harry ran down the street, weaving between surprised street-goers. Behind him, a crowd of enthusiastic citizens and parasitic reporters followed.
She looks back at the article. Due to the night-time setting, the image is not entirely clear. It’s not fully certain that the figure transforming into a dragon is her Draco. But people have been arrested by the Ministry on much lesser evidence.
When Pansy hears about what he did, she grabs him round the shoulders and forcefully rubs his head. Thankfully, it’s done in the privacy of their dormitory room.
“The castle will come together faster than you expect.” Draco’s hand presses lightly over Harry’s chest. “The new Hogwarts castle will retain the same soul. A certain Harry Potter can grow up and change. A castle can too.”
that his magic is bottomless. That he can keep on giving more and more to Draco who will then save Hogwarts as much as he can. Even though he has committed to rebuilding a better Hogwarts, he still hopes that Hogwarts, as it is, can be saved.
“Mr Jamie Ottley,” Draco says sternly. As more strength returns, he is able to sit up straight, swinging his legs over the recliner, feet touching the ground. “We’ll talk about it later. Don’t make me carry you all to bed!”
Harry sees Malfoy again just a few months later for their eighth year at Hogwarts (well, technically Harry’s seventh year, with the camping and all). At first, Harry sticks to his friends, and Malfoy sticks to his. But Harry can’t help but notice Malfoy’s trips to the Hospital Wing. When Harry tells Hermione and Ron about it, Ron complains about his obsession (“
If there are any plot holey ish stuff that you want me to address, you should remind me because I’ve forgotten 🙈🙈🙈🙈
As suggested, McGonagall sets up signage defining a safe passageway for students and other staff to see the newly built Great Hall. In the big empty space, more than one group of students have started to run around.
is not worth the paper it’s printed on. Do they want to make Harry undesirable number one again? Haven’t they learnt their lesson?!”
What he didn’t know was how Draco and Charlie both admired his fucked out, come streaked form for long, long minutes before they actually cleaned him up.
Nolan tilts his chin up at his ‘father’ who is drawing his wand. “No father is better than an arsehole like you!”
Before Malfoy had arrived, Harry spotted the silvery unicorns nearby. Yet they fled at Malfoy’s presence….
“What a mess,” Pansy grumbles. “The only way to scare them off is if we can convince Filch to patrol around our area more often.”
Draco’s brow raises. “Did you, now?” He glances around, and glares at the people looking at them. “Come on in.”
Soon, groups of students line up at the entrance. Draco checks over their outerwear and casts warming charms on their clothes before letting them leave the Slytherin Commons.
“By the power vested in me as the Headmistress of Hogwarts, I now pronounce you husband and husband!”
He shouldn’t have been bitten. It was all his stupid father’s fault! His father had dragged him to one of the peripheral meetings—for people not
With the data organised, and testing and training data split, training the model is just one line of code:
Harry and Draco spent the entire day preparing. When Ron and Hermione arrived, thirty  minutes or so before the scheduled start of the dinner, Draco remained in the kitchen to finish carefully decorating the individual desserts while Harry went to greet his friends, who had floo’ed in.
still think we should make a track like they have in Gringotts,” another student says. “It would be even better if it can go up, too!”
“It shouldn’t have moved yet,” Draco cuts in. “If we had time to reinforce the rest of Hogwarts, the rejection would not have been severe. Something unexpected happened.”
Unspeakable Nightshade’s face is dark, both in expression and due to the hood over his head despite the late evening. “I have determined that the Slytherins have been interfering with the building process.”
“...Okay.” Harry ducks his head, cheeks warming a little. Zabini’s smile is hard to look at for too long. He’s relieved when Zabini lets go of his arm.
the extra wizard space—even Malfoy Manor is resilient to Draco’s attempts to modify it, and his mother has to coax it to change. That said, with the knowledge of Hogwarts’ flexibility, he and Blaise had gone on to make much greater changes to the Slytherin Common Room.
“It’s fantastic,” Hagrid replies. “C’mere!” And Harry does, only to be wrapped up in a big hug from Hagrid.
Results so far from the google form poll… most you want me to write a smutty extra for Under Dragon Wings (or maybe smutty alternate universe?? hahaha comment down below if you have any particular requests~), followed by more main story content. I wrote
Lucius sucks in a sharp breath as he picks up the ancient tome. His eyes do not deceive him. That is
And of course, Draco and Harry share the bed and bedroom with Pansy and Blaise. Neither Draco nor Harry bring up what they had wanted to say before.
That mollifies the goblins, who let him pass, just as Draco emerges. Harry’s face splits into a wide grin. Harry does a little awkward run up to greet him.
Aster nudges dark green hair out of their eyes. “Firstly, you missed lunch,” they say, pushing a basket into his stomach. “Blaise collected that for you, by the way.”
With chastised expressions, almost all of the Slytherins leave. The ones heading back to the Slytherin Commons will tell Pansy and Blaise of what had happened.
In one of Malfoy Manor’s drawing rooms, Narcissa Malfoy discards the evening’s special paper and takes the letter that her son has just sent instead. Her unease does not dissipate, Draco’s letter is not reassuring at all.
Then, he steps into the mixed group of Slytherins and gives them all a head pat, wiping away their worries one-by-one and replacing them with adoring eyes.
Eyes at the breakfast table in the Slytherin-tent look at the papers and then look at Draco Malfoy. It’s an open secret that Mr Malfoy and the other Eighth Years caught Greyback and the others.
The third year Gryffindor Alice Mistle shivers in fright at the whisper, quickly looking up at the speaker. They’re both in the Gryffindor Common room and there are
Nguyen lifts her chin. “I’ve spoken with Professor Flitwick. For the time being, I will stay in Slytherin with my sister. I’m one of the top students in Transfiguration, I can help teach it.”
Harry grabs the corner of Draco’s robes and pulls him along. They descend the stairs. Some of the water has been siphoned out, and there is a clear pathway to the kitchens and to where the Hufflepuff dormitories lie, but elsewhere, destruction remains. And the area below, where the remaining Potions classrooms lie remain completely flooded, including Snape’s old office and potions laboratory which technically isn’t part of the Slytherin Dungeons.
“Fuck!” Draco’s hips trembled. “You love my dick, don’t you Harry?” His voice was husky and dark and it went straight to Harry’s cock.
“They all could be true,” Pansy says with a twinkle in her eye. “It will be impossible for the Wizengamot to buy out

Madam Pomfrey’s eyes narrow. “You saw last night?” she says, her voice becoming strict. “Ms Green, I would have hoped that you were in your bed sleeping last night, instead of getting lost in the Forbidden Forest. Mr Malfoy is an adult and an Eighth Year, and is familiar with these parts of the Forest. However, the Forest is
“Good, Harry,” Blaise says, dressed in a revealing night robe that...Harry is now, finally, used to. He stands at the foot of the big bed and raises an eyebrow at Malfoy and Pansy.  “You’re just in time for me to interrogate Draco and Pansy about their meeting with McGonagall this morning.”
On Friday evening, Harry is relaxing with all the other Slytherin students who are not doing homework tonight, preparing more cards and games for tomorrow. Meanwhile Draco is, as usual, marking again.
“I think it is safe to say that the first team has failed their task set in the two weeks,” Minister Shacklebolt says, as cameras flash. “The Ministry keeps their promises. Headmistress McGonagall will now lead the second team. Once again, they will be given two weeks to show progress, and will also be tested at the end of the two weeks. Headmistress McGonagall, do you have any words to say?”
Although the Slytherins now have dinner with the other Houses, they’ve maintained having breakfast together, currently in their temporary common room/dining room.
Lucky for Poppy, no one gets injured, but everyone enjoys the event: most of all, Harry, Draco, and Nolan, who can finally change his name to Nolan Malfoy-Potter.
The uneasy feeling in Draco's chest grows. "I'll accompany you to McGonagall's office nonetheless. Alert me through the badge once your meeting is over."
And Draco would like to say that he eventually catches Harry, and Harry likes to maintain that he’s still the best seeker since Draco failed in catching the snitch, and so both are happy with the outcome.
Once Harry steps through, he looks up and sees a blue sky, completely at odds with the cloudy sky just a moment ago. He can’t resist stepping out through the archway again, dragging Draco with him. Yep, definitely not his imagination.
Draco can’t move. Knows that scales have appeared on his body, under his robes, trying to protect him as he falls and tumbles and knocks against the hard edge of the stairs—
promised. I can see Bartholomew using you as bait, but for Kingsley to drag you in like that, and not even be there to help?!”
“Hm. I spoke to Professor Flitwick when I was accompanying the third years to his office. He spoke to Hagrid…”
As part of the initiative to encourage working together, the makeshift desks also have an inbuilt charm that allows them to become light and easy to move around.
Pansy smiles innocently. “Everyone deserves recognition for their part in rebuilding Hogwarts. Now, where is Lee Jordan to take a picture…”
“Come on Draco,” Pansy urges, her eyes sparkling. “You shouldn’t leave your kids in the dark like this.”
Blaise takes a seat on the Eighth Year throne sofa. He presses right up against Draco as he’s wont to do. Pansy grumbles as she’s forced to budge over.
“A new house must be passed by the Wizengamot,” Nightshade responds emotionlessly. “We do not have that time.” He glances sidelong at McGonagall’s unruffled expression.
“Yeah, because my aunt and uncle made me do all the chores, and anyway, I wasn’t allowed to be smarter than Dudley. One time, he beat me up for it.”
Draco bites back a sigh as the full moon rises. Harry is right. It is better if these students could stay in Slytherin instead.
Once Hyacinth Nguyen passes the Slytherin entry foyer and into the Slytherin Commons proper, her eyes widen.
Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt presides over proceedings. He buries his tiredness to call the vote.
“I believe Hogwarts will be able to recognise that you are merely handing back Garren’s wand’s allegiance, and not your allegiance to Hogwarts. Hogwarts is intelligent.”
Harry’s face falls a bit at the accursed mention of homework. “Why are you always badgering me about homework? I’m rich, Pansy says that I can be a gentleman of leisure!”
While the other professors get to go back to bed, McGonagall leads Robards and the remaining Aurors to view the exterior damage to the castle. Over the course of their subsequent investigation into entry points in Hogwarts, the trail is eventually uncovered: the Aegis members came through the Black Lake, a weak point that connects the Black Lake to other bodies of water, much like how the Dumstrang ship travelled to Hogwarts a few years ago.
Gryffindor falls flat on its side, unable to land properly. The impact sends cracks across the stone as the roof becomes half-crushed.
arch nemesis. Through everything, despite everything, I’m so happy to be standing here with you today. I promise to cherish you always, to love you and to honour you, and not even death will part us.”
McGonagall turns to all the staff and students.  “There are no classes for the rest of today. Tomorrow’s Quidditch Match will continue as scheduled.” If the Quidditch stands have fallen, they’ll be easy to put back up again.
“Ha-ha,” Harry says drily. But nonetheless, he winks at Draco before going up to the other Slytherins and reminding them of
Come and lube make each movement exceptionally smooth. Harry’s hole was hot, squeezing down on Charlie’s cock.
Draco drops his arm from Potter’s shoulder to Potter’s waist. He nudges him to turn back to the Castle. “Let’s return.” He nods at the other Slytherins, who walk ahead of them.
The new Hogwarts is bigger, taller. There are more windows and decorative elements. The houses are more magically integrated into the rest of the castle: each House Commons has magical threads of the other houses, not to mention the multi-house spaces for all students.
Draco fucked Harry without mercy. He couldn’t take it any longer. He had to fuck hard, he had to drive Harry up to the skies of pleasure.
She’ll have to have a word with the Aurors again about the devices, and she’ll have to talk with the students to see whether she can determine why they have been the ones to receive these things...
In the Slytherin Commons, Pansy is sitting on the throne sofa, checking over the articles she had previously encouraged to be written. By purposefully not pushing for anything in the
“He isn’t.” Draco smiles deceptively, making William shift uncomfortably. “But we can easily choose a new leader. You choose the arbiter, and we’ll duel.”
Slytherin House is able to claim expansive grounds outside Hogwarts Castle. All Draco needs to do is follow the sound of their bright voices and chatter that carries easily over the reflective snow.
All the Slytherins staying at Hogwarts gather around the central firepit. Behind them, some of Hogwarts ghosts have gathered, watching something that has not occurred on Hogwarts ground for a long time.
Draco’s suddenly faced with grievous younger Slytherins and rebellious older Slytherins. He turns to Pansy for some commiseration, but she’s clearly laughing inside. Meanwhile, Potter has an expectant look on his face, more than ready to have fun in the snow.
Draco hears Nolan’s four feet step across the ground. His transformation is over. He turns around, bringing the dragon a tiny bit closer to his skin. Nolan’s head bows in deference as he slowly pads forward, avoiding Harry. Draco crouches down, and ends up with an armful of wolf.
,” he said. “Short haired; the fluffier, the better. Warm coloured eyes. Warm coloured skin. Equally disastrous fashion sense.”
Granger curls her lips. “It’s not that simple, Harry. If I walked around saying that I was the Head of Gryffindor, that doesn’t make it
Harry looks like he’s still in a daze, not quite listening to the magical theory speculations that Granger is talking about. More than once, he looks over his shoulder, back towards the Great Hall.
Draco hesitates, but he ultimately leaves when Harry threatens to throw a pillow at him. His chest aches as the distance between them grows, but it’s not entirely the bond. He wants to stay by Harry’s side, hold him protectively in his hands.
With the entire night for tensions to fester, breakfast at the Great Hall is filled with low voices.
Draco lets him pretend otherwise. They have a long time together, after all. Draco will convince Harry eventually.
Pansy raises an eyebrow. “The Slytherin Prince isn’t Draco. It’s Blaise. Prince Charming. Half of Slytherin has a crush on him. Draco’s always been a bit too sharp and caustic.”
Now that all the bedrooms are in the same quarter, it’s a lot easier for Draco to usher the students to bed, both Slytherins and non-Slytherin visitors.
“Madam Pomfrey knows this matter. I see that she has kept patient confidentiality, but now that the matter has been
After Draco leaves the room, Harry gingerly gets up. There’s still the feeling of magic not quite fitting under his skin, but
They take his broom to McGonagall’s quarters. She doesn’t need much convincing to let them use her floo, but she
“I could say the same about you,” Harry returns. He attempts to conjure up a table and some chairs while Malfoy calls a house-elf to bring them some lunch.
After that, Draco started contacting each of his old friends, one by one. It was good to catch up with them. Whether they had changed too much to continue to be close friends going forward, Draco didn’t know. But he wouldn’t know if he didn’t try.
“You used to send sonnets about Potter to your mum, didn’t you?” Pansy whispers into his ear. Draco jerks away.
Only then does Draco follow Harry up to their bedroom. They complete their nightly ablutions and climb into bed together.
“Yes, it won’t be a problem at all—isn’t it close to lunchtime now? Teenagers get hungry quickly, let me prepare lunch!” Harry dissipates his Patronus and heads out of the room to the kitchen, where Draco knows all the food is already prepared.
“When did you arrive last night?” Harry asked, face half smooshed in Draco’s chest because Draco wanted to hug him.
has a whole Slytherin cohort to look after. He doesn’t need to add disaster-star Harry Potter to the mix. No, it’s better to teach Potter to become a competent Potions assistant instead.
“I suppose you don’t want company,” Draco drawls as he approaches him. He produces a mug of hot chocolate and sticks it in Potter’s face.
“Later, they’re all asleep right now,” McGonagall says, voice brooking no argument. She raises an eyebrow. “You look like you can do with a nap too.”
But Harry thought he had it right. Look what happened when he went out today! He was first chased by a ravenous crowd, and then he was pushed against the wall by Draco Malfoy!
Now that the most fundamental part of Hogwarts is in place, they can now start building the rest of Hogwarts, starting with the floors below ground.
. In true Gryffindor fashion, Harry asks him out immediately. He agrees, and Harry floats through the relationship honeymoon phase. He can even do okay in the bedroom department (the euphemistic one) and enjoys it enough.
With a slash of his hand, Draco summons fire, and it’s grim satisfaction he feels when Greyback flinches.
Irma muses Minerva’s questions seriously. “Any large fluctuations suggest a large magical working. A few days ago...was the winter solstice.”
Draco rolls his eyes, both exasperated and amused by Harry’s winding trails of thoughts. Harry definitely wasn’t like this before he came to Slytherin!
“And obviously we wouldn’t hear others backmouthing you in our company,” Hermione adds in protest. “Like Creevey—even
On the other side of the firepit, Blaise and Pansy are also helping to keep Hogwarts together just a little bit longer.
At ground level, bright yellow daffodils carpet the green grass. Deep green bushes are covered with pink and red and yellow roses like soft jewels in the sunlight. The cherry trees Draco ordered earlier are full of pink and white blossoms.
Lately, Potter hasn’t requested to come with them, because he’s still off doing his secret little gift-acquiring business.
Draco immediately changes his head-rubbing posture to a hug around Harry, his front against Harry’s back. “Be careful.”
saviour complex. You would throw yourself in the line of fire. I would shoot down the spell and kill the bastard who dared.”
“And I see you’re still hanging on,” Draco replied, greeting them with a handshake. It was pleasant to catch up with them—and they pulled Draco along to greet his other old colleagues too.
Hogwarts shifts, and Blaise tilts his head imperceptibly. Harry and Draco have returned from their class-teaching, and their outpouring of magic is bolstering Hogwarts up, just a little longer.
be a prize for the best costume. It will start at four in the evening, and will end by nine. Dinner will be served at the usual time in the Hall. If there are any after parties...I didn’t hear of it,” Garren adds with a wink.
Some of the Ministry team shriek in terror as the thestrals descend heavily, as sharp wings snapping out and blocking them the Slytherins.
Granger’s eyes darken. “You’re right, it’s not the same. Purebloods getting bullied is not the same as muggleborns getting bullied. The inherent power structures are different, carry a different weight. The
Back in the Head Auror office, Robards turns to Auror Inkwood. “Now what is this about Narcissa Malfoy?”
Instead, he’s accompanying Felicity to set up more surveillance spells outside Slytherin. He’s accompanying Blaise to remove the most recent round of trap hexes. He’s sitting down with Pansy with copies of everyone’s schedules to see whether they can revise a safer routine.
with magic more than once,” Harry says. “Me, and many other Slytherins. I don’t think there will be any magical rejection.”
“Thanks for the money, Malfoy,” Harry said back with a grin. He glanced at the time. It was getting late.
“My first years won’t be attending any classes today. I would appreciate it if you could pass me on your class notes and any assignments.”
Once all the measurements needed are taken, Malfoy transforms back behind the curtain and puts on his clothes.
Nolan glances at Aster on the next bed over, then back to Draco. “They look fine,” he says dismissively.
“This is hardly their first attack. It is not urgent.” Draco reaches out and rubs Harry’s head, pressing down. “Now, now, enjoy the last few days of our Winter Break, and let the Minister enjoy his break. You can send him a detailed letter later, okay?”
for you, but I believe that no one will bother you today. Many stores also have anti-disguising-spell wards.”
secret that I don’t know about?” Sixth-Year Harry would be so disappointed that Eighth-Year Harry lacks so much information.
They sit down on ‘their’ side, and Draco ignores how the remaining Ravenclaws shift to the other table.
The Gringotts alarm lights flash, and guards flank him. The far door slams open and Malfoy stalks across the hall.
On Monday morning, many newspapers contain pictures of a great big silver dragon among Hogwarts students, with the partially built Hogwarts castle in the background.
Aster glances at Mesa. Mesa gives them a weak smile in response, bumping their elbows together lightly.
After the wolves finish, the two big ones go for a run. The smaller one—Nolan—goes for a brief walk...and then returns, glares at Harry, and flops on Malfoy’s lap.
Malfoy picked out two nice swallow bowls, filled first with rice, blanched green beans and fresh spinach. Harry topped them with the grilled lamb and a dollop of tzatziki. Knowing full well the appetite of people with Malfoy’s height (
In the late afternoon, Robards and another Auror trudge wearily to Hogwarts. McGonagall greets them at the gate.
Harry usually avoided Diagon Alley to the best of his ability, but today, he had promised to help busy-Hermione and go fetch her delicate potions order that absolutely could not be owl-delivered.
When Harry finally comes down, there is indeed a “snow area” near the Lake’s window. Some fifth years are constructing intricate snow sculptures.
“Charlie!” Harry’s hole gripped Charlie’s cock like a vice as his body shook in orgasm. Ropey white come splattered on his stomach under Charlie’s guide.
Draco is more grateful than ever for what Baise and Jamie and Alyss have done in improving their relationship with the house-elves. Lunch is served in the Commons.
not waiting out here,” Pansy says when they reach the staircase. In fact, after giving the guard gargoyle the password, she strolls up the stairs first, and she’s the one who knocks at McGonagall’s door.
Random members of the public huddle together under charms to stave off the wind and cold to shout and yell. Members of the press have come out, cameras capturing the protest against the petition to reinstate Slytherin.
“Hhh~, hh~,” Harry panted. His body shook a little when his sensitive covered cock grazed against Draco’s hip.
“If we are to prevent the Ministry from apprehending you, they will need to know this matter,” McGonagall says heavily. “You will likely have to register.”
“No!” Potter lies very badly. “I joined because of House unity! I want to show the world that you’re not all bad. I wanted to see what it would be like if I had been in Slytherin. Honestly...I’m a little jealous of what you all have. You even accompanied the Slytherins out here to the Forest.” Potter smiles bitterly. “I didn’t even think about them. Even though I knew Remus, I didn’t

is a long running prompt fest for Draco Malfoy/Harry Potter, focused around specific themes (i.e., unusual careers, pets, books, travel, and food). The works are posted anonymously, and at the conclusion of the fest is a guessing poll that runs for a few days before the final reveal of the authors.
dishes appear on the table. One of them is the cake that Harry baked, and the other is a tart that Draco must have prepared.
“I promised to teach Defence to the first and second years,” Harry admits. “If I don’t, Draco will do it and—”
From behind, Draco could see the come and lube dripping out of Harry’s hole. As Harry sank down on Charlie’s cock, the thick rod forced come and lube from Harry’s channel, causing it to drip down his cock, down his balls.
“That’s massively unfair!” Harry says. “If you can turn into a dragon, why can’t I turn into a thestral? Does that mean your patronus is a dragon?”
Malfoy carefully sliced through his lamb and constructed a biteful on his fork containing all elements before taking a bite. His eyes rested on Harry. “Very delicious.”
“I’m sorry, Professor,” Draco says. He means it. “Your classes are a joy to attend, but unless every single student is searched for these, before each class, I must pull out my Slytherins until these orbs are
After the tour is finished, Malfoy comes back with a small tray of items and another small Slytherin following. The small Slytherin glares at Harry from behind Malfoy.
Harry is about to protest again, but then he reconsiders the look on Pansy’s face. With that, Harry says grumpily, “Nope, you can’t trick me.”
Draco hums and dismisses them. Jamie runs off to join his friends, while Alyss heads over to the other first years.
McGonagall’s eyes flicker slightly. “It is okay to move a little, but please pay attention. In order for this to work, a little bit of your magic will be used to awaken Hogwarts. Be at ease. It is part of the ritual, and will not be harmful to you.”
Malfoy turns to everyone. “Even though Slytherin has separated, tonight, you are all still welcome.”
? Harry muses as he makes his way down to Slytherin. Luna is friendly with Draco, despite everything. Neville is friends with Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff who Harry likes, and Neville is fundamentally a good guy—a better guy than Harry.
So Harry told Draco about it, and thus, they spent a quiet morning together before they both had to go.
Madame Pomfrey frowns at Mary Green’s receding back. Carrying a camera like that, it is clear that she does not have good intentions.
“Mum asked about you,” Ron adds. “She was ready to floo to Hogwarts and bring you back for Christmas.”
Draco looked down, seeing Harry’s slightly puffed up cheek. Despite himself he had to poke it and then leaned down to kiss Harry’s forehead in apology.
Harry reaches out and lightly touches Draco’s chest. “That’s not a problem. Of course they would know more things, just like how Ron and Hermione know things about me that you don’t. Anyway, are we really going to start divulging our deepest darkest secrets on the first day when we haven’t even kissed yet?”
As it is, weaving the connections does not take long. In front of Draco’s eyes, it’s enough to simply guide the main threads of magic: Hogwarts does the rest because Hogwarts knows best. Once the integration happens, it’s as though Slytherin has always been a part of Hogwarts.
Harry sends a flashy patronus message to McGonagall ahead of them. By the time Draco, Pansy and Harry reach the front doors of Hogwarts, McGonagall is there, waiting for them.
Harry hisses, taking a step towards Malfoy. “Hey! I would be a great criminal! Undesirable number one! Secret vigilante army!”
with the soul orbs. He, Pansy, and Felicity gather near the central firepit, with multiple books stacked on the coffee tables.
In contrast to Draco’s harsh movements, Charlie’s hands gently rubbed Harry’s thighs, gently rubbed Harry’s sides, gently rubbed Harry’s chest. “You’re doing very good, Harry.”
: A number of muggle parents have asked for parent-teacher interviews. Therefore, we will try them out. Due to logistics, they will be done either by firecall or by muggle phone call in the special magically-isolated temporary building…
“Don’t ask me so many details about how Slytherin expanded,” Harry replies aggrievedly. “Blaise is in charge mostly...Hey, even Jamie knows more. Hey, Jamie!”
The thought of visiting makes Harry sick, but he has to go early in the morning, if he’s to have time to suffer through the process
It was too much. Draco squeezed his eyes shut and squeezed Harry in his arms. Harry’s fingers traced across Draco’s hands, tangled his fingers in.
The wind starts to blow eerily. The sound of footsteps can be slowly heard, getting louder and louder.
It’s already February. In less than two weeks time, it’ll be Valentine's Day. Wouldn’t it be so wonderful if Harry could spend it with Draco? Then...should he ask Draco out on the day, or before it?
‘Over there’, McGonagall and the house-elves have set up tables and chairs with weather protection charms and lighting, very similar to how the Slytherin Saturday night dinner event is set up.
At the end of their meal, Malfoy called for the bill. Harry tried to take a look at it, but Malfoy didn’t even pause, directly giving the waiter a black credit card.
“Because she did nothing when a Slytherin was attacked with a soul orb,” Harry says softly. “Luckily, Draco found the Slytherin quickly.”
“Working on something with Jamie,” Draco says. “Aster has them and the other second years in the potions laboratory.”
Even though Harry’s words are light, Draco’s thoughts turn heavy. There are a number of students who should
“O-oh,” Harry says, understanding. “We’re going out for lunch, aren’t we? Do you want to pick instead?” He adds, slyly, “I bet you know
“You said that the Slytherins were bad!” Liam Hedge scowls. “Sure, they were horrible last year, but this year they’re not!
“Never tickle them, never wake them,” Potter says, a hint of a laugh in his voice. “Grumpy, grouchy, a lot like a certain person.”
The stairs are still there. But they land on a fragmented floor, below which is entirely flooded with water.
Draco rolls his eyes, but speeds up his bedtime routine. He slips into bed between Blaise and Pansy. His friends are like those thestrals, he thinks, snuggling up to him for warmth.
temporary-effect potions!” Aster insists. They step onto the staircase, hand on the banister. “In fact, some of them are stronger than the permanent ones. Draco and I were thinking of using some temporary-effect potions on the badges instead. Easier than remembering to charm everyone’s clothes in the morning.”
Draco and the other Head of Houses are like conduits. Through them, they channel both their own magic as well as magic of the other staff and students from their House. The magic that Draco sends off to Hogwarts is distinctly Slytherin, rather than distinctly Draco. In fact, Draco would say it’s
In the dining tent, where breakfast is being set up, Hagrid walks in, heading straight for the rather haggard McGonagall, his eyes sparkling.
Later, while Harry has been tricked into playing some games with the first and second years, Draco finds Blaise privately, taking him to speak in their dormitory rooms.
“We’re here to see whether or not he’s a good cook,” Ron said with utmost seriousness. “So yes, I’m hungry.”
Currently, their Defence Against The Dark Arts professor is at the front of the classroom, setting out their newest assignment.
The students playing hope to pick one of these cards: the moment you play one of them, you’re almost guaranteed a win!
Head Auror Robards also gives Bartholomew a belittingly look. “It was a raid, yet how did they all ambush
Now, about the basilisk...in one of the earliest versions of this, the basilisk had a baby basilisk (that’s quite big). And there was a scene like this:
Draco’s career meeting with Professor Garren is on Tuesday afternoon, and a few minutes in, he’s already moved from sabotage to contemplating murder.
“But I notice everything you do.” Harry smirks, and winks. “Need to make sure if you’re up to something, Malfoy.”
“That’s easy,” Das says. “We just need to begin with something that has the same weight and height as the chair. That way, if it
And that means that Narcissa needs to keep the Ministry too busy to persecute Draco, and to ensure that Draco’s failure to comply is punished with only a fine….
And Draco framed the drawing and kept it by his bedside. And no one, except the house-elf who cleaned his room, and Narcissa and Pansy who knew everything, would know.
“In that case, I’ll sit at the Slytherin table with you, Harry,” Luna says brightly. “Ginny, you don’t have to come if you’re not comfortable.”
Draco sighs. “No, I’m being unfair. They would have found out eventually, be it from you, or by following someone else.” He gives Harry a short pat. “Let’s go back.”
Together, they flooed to Harry’s place. With Harry’s dark blue robes, Draco thought the lighter blue sherwani would work.
Malfoy shoves Parkinson off, such that she ends up draping around Harry. Harry blushes and quickly extricates himself from Parkinson.
The night of the full moon is Thursday, December 3rd. After making sure Potter is safely under Blaise’s eye, Draco leaves with Slytherin werewolf students.
Ms Zabini sighs dramatically. “Well, in the end, they’ve both grown up well. The War was truly a big mess, but they’ve pulled through for the better.”
Harry opens his mouth, but his words are whipped away in the wind. The cart picks up speed, vaults flash by, and Harry has the legitimate fear that his glasses will come flying off—
Robards rubs his forehead. Not only does he have to deal with the dark items sent in by McGonagall, but he also has to clean up the messes of the other Aurors!
Hermione glances sidelong at Harry, who is whole and well and chatting with Neville about the underwater plants he can see from Slytherin’s Common Room.
Some students are throwing snowballs (Nolan and Harley), and other students are building snow sculptures (Michelle and Aster, and Jamie, poorly), and many others are taking the chance to stroll around outside.
All the Unspeakables were wearing dark robes, partly because they had planned to, and partly because dark robes were easy to find.
“Your mother has a letter for you, Young Master Draco,” the house-elf says. After handing it over, the house-elf disappears.
Some people on the Ministry team stiffen slightly. This was the first time some of them heard that they would be
Innocent Harry practically had a bounce in his step as he took his two best friends into the living room.
His arm starts throbbing out of nowhere. Draco quickly suppresses his expression, pulling out the badge Pansy had made. “I have this, remember?”
Draco bits back a growl at Blaise’s provocation. “Don’t underestimate me again, understood? Not even Harry Potter can take
Harry’s breaths became more ragged, and when Draco pressed against his prostate, a moan spilled from Harry’s lips.
is doing its best to distance itself from how it behaved during the War, by promoting all those who stand against Voldemort.” His voice dips into a growl. “And of course, Aegis is on the
“Structural integrity is still in place,” Draco says. “But you may want to check whether or not anything came loose and have everyone reinforce everything again just in case.”
last minute. White snow blanketed the roofs and sides of the road, while the main walking road was magically clear and filled with robed and muggle-clothing-wearing people bustling about.
Draco beckons one of the smallest thestrals over—it’s only about his height. The thestral neighs happily under Draco’s petting. Draco gently takes Nolan’s other hand and presses it against the thestral’s side.
“Because you’re going to come untouched again, aren’t you? All that training, you’ve been such a good boy, haven’t you? You don’t even need a thick cock. Anything will do, because you’re a
The slim, waxing moon hangs in the sky, the scent of roasted food and spices curl through the air, mingling with the sound of voices and music, both classical instrumental and variable-talent singing.
“I can adopt Nolan,” Harry says, glancing at Draco. Unlike Draco, Harry doesn’t have any ‘elders’ to stop him from adopting whoever he wants.
“We all have different philosophies. Hermione, we’re sorry that we treated you differently: your muggleborn nature does not affect your abilities as a witch, and we were illogical to think so. I understand you’re frustrated with how Draco has dealt with things. You’re not alone in feeling this. I also occasionally need to remind Draco of propriety. There is a cultural difference between us. We both have to meet half-way.”
Now I have to do it all over again!” Jones tilts his chin away and grabs a new sheet, starting to meticulously re-draw his rectangular classroom. “One table for everyone, to reduce chatting during class,” Jones says darkly.
Harry came with a shudder, spurting all over Draco’s fingers. “Draco…” Harry’s body trembled in the aftershocks.
Draco rises from Aster’s side, eyes narrowing up the stairs. He doesn’t need a revealing charm to know that
Malfoy leans in, and the head of it brushes against Harry’s entrance. A bit of pressure, and it slowly goes in.
Meanwhile, Nolan and Harley are tasked with collecting winter greenery they’ll need to decorate the Commons for tonight.
But whose fault was it that she fell in love with a man whose heart was so easily accessed through his stomach??
A growl rips through the air. White-hot flame spews to an apparently empty patch of water, setting the water boiling as the wave of heat explodes outwards.
He puts aside his scheduling notes for the head-of-house meetings. Before he can return to Slytherin business, he needs to write a letter to his father. It’s only
“Let’s go to dinner,” Draco says, pulling Harry’s hand away from his face, twisting his palm so that their fingers lace together.
Harry continues in a slightly anxious tone, “And no one has touched that snitch yet. It’s for you, touch it first.”
Pansy stares him down. “I suppose I should tell your friend that you cheated on last month’s Transfiguration exam?”
“You dig your own mines,” Malfoy drawls. He releases his hand from Harry’s mouth. “Come along now, Potter.”
Hitchly’s narrowed eyes look down on him, his lip curling slightly in disdain. “Mr. Malfoy. How unfortunate to see you again before our next parole meeting. This is Auror Bartholomew. He’s the head of the task force on Greyback’s case.” His magic reaches out towards Draco, trying to suppress and intimidate him.
The bigger part of Harry’s brain was much more concerned with dicks. Draco being one of them. It was not fair how good Draco looked sprawling on Harry’s sofa.
today without your presence. Not that you missed much, with the horrid All Saints Eve party in the Great Hall. And the
“And yet, here we are,” Draco drawled, reclining back. Harry’s eyes flashed with heat, and it was inevitable for Harry to straddle him and kiss him.
Before, it had been mostly muggleborns. But now, it’s shifted to halfbloods and purebloods—halfbloods and purebloods who had been on the right side. The kind of people who would have been on Diagon Alley on New Years Eve.
Draco looks away, his heart skipping a beat at Harry’s smile. “Make yourself some hot pumpkin juice,” he orders weakly.
Harry gives an innocent smile. “What, it’s true! You always remind everyone about the weather and weather-appropriate clothing—”
“It will be best if you see for yourself,” Blaise says. “After their failure, I’ll assess exactly why it happened. Don’t pity them. They could have told
Pansy is dedicated to setting up "opportunities" for Draco and Harry but is ultimately defeated by Draco’s obliviousness 🙈
has to do the hard work.” Draco summons a house-elf, and as planned, she brings them dinner. “Thank you, Milly.”
“Aster. Unlike those fifth years, you don’t require any help for your potions OWLs.” He lets Aster help on the potions though, handing over his experimental recipes.
“Hey, Draco,” Pansy’s voice interrupts Draco’s thoughts. “Look.” Pansy flexes her hand in front of Draco, showing off the black metal finger claws on the tip of each finger. “Now everyone can have dragon claws.”
Draco had been flipping through a slim junior fiction novel, one of the longer books in existence in Harry’s home. But now the book was held slack in his hand as he watched Harry with a secretively little smile.
” Flitwick says, eyes scanning the corridor and then snapping back to Draco. “I heard all this commotion. Mr. Malfoy?”
The bonds to all those he has responsibility for and care for reach out across the castle and the grounds.
The tips of Harry’s ears are red. It’s...endearing how easily Harry becomes embarrassed. The bond in Draco’s chest tingles, and his heart swells—
“This group of people attacked the castle and the students,” McGonagall says coldly. “There are multiple witnesses, including myself.”
“Are you not curious about how I was injured a few months ago? Or how I was able to find you so easily when Creevey took out the soul orb?”
After it is all done, Blaise makes multiple copies of the magical blueprints for interested parties, and returns to the Slytherin Commons.
Soz to Hermione for being demoted to cannon fodder, this author still has ways to go about creating complex characters. We’ll see whether she can redeem herself, hm?  🙈🙈  Oh yeah, for a fic about how Draco helps the world, see
Draco’s tone is even. “I’ve been quite busy. As you may have heard, the Slytherin quarters have now been completed. However, I endeavour to write clearly in my letters to you. What matters did you find confusing in particular?”
Harry can only moan—Malfoy, words, how? It’s like—Malfoy is splitting him open, like Malfoy’s cock is moulding him, making him the perfect sleeve, the perfect hole. The fullness is overwhelming and incredible and Harry just keeps getting fuller and fuller, as Malfoy goes deeper and deeper, and Harry wonders if it’ll go up to his
“The papers even speculated….It’s Harry, of course. With his messy black hair and bright green eyes.” Draco’s lips curl up.
Harry startles. “Ah, well, I… I also think Draco is right. You know that the younger students couldn’t attend some of the classes at all. And I think...if people
