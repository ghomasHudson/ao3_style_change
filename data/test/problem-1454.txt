Which leads Harry to another big event of his summer.
“Yes,” he breathes and then wrenches himself off to push Harry away back towards the dorm.
“This is unnecessary, Minerva, all I wanted was a name.”
-but then the two fingers brush across his prostate and Harry lets out a breathy cry of pleasure and he knows Draco hasn’t forgotten.
Harry is so busy thinking that he hasn’t even noticed the door appearing, but Hermione’s voice breaks him out of his thoughts. “Harry?”
The two of them fall into heated discussion. Ron’s face is going red and he keeps talking over Harry before the other wizard can finish getting out more than a sentence or two.
“Are you close?” Harry asks and then nibbles again at his neck.
At least with Harry what he feels is too much in a good way.
“Is that what I’m doing?” Draco perks up. “Go on then.”
-Draco swallows dryly.
Harry kisses him before he can continue and Draco smiles against his lips, pulling him close. Their arms slip around one another, their tongues meeting desperately as Harry feels so light and happy it’s as if he could fly away.
, I’m hiding… me, I suppose.”
“Coming?” Harry doesn’t know where the sudden confidence comes from, but he thinks it might have something to do with the look in Draco’s eyes as he watches him. Harry’s cock stirs and even that doesn’t make him blush, though it would have only days ago. Draco’s eyes drop from his chest to his crotch and his expression can’t be described as anything other than hungry.
“That’s brilliant, Draco. I’m happy people are giving you a chance.”
She looks around the room a bit, stopping at the sight of Ron, Harry and Hermione before smiling. "My friends got me out eventually. But before that Bellatrix Lestrange would love to hurt me while Mr. Malfoy watched. The elder Mr. Malfoy I mean."
“You have.” Harry assures him. “I just… everyone likes chocolate, don’t they? Figured it was a safe bet.”
on all summer after the trials when the Aurors (guards, he had always told his mother with a bitter voice) left them after a few weeks of making sure they wouldn’t try anything, and after a while the spell was easy to ignore. It has been dormant here in Hogwarts, ready to activate at the slightest hint of him disappearing or something along those lines, but it would be reactivated for Christmas Break at the Manor too. Until he is finished his sentence from the Wizengamot Draco only has the illusion of privacy.
"The first time we met." Harry answers him, knowing Malfoy won't let it go. "I'd only just learned I was a wizard the night before and you were the first kid my age I ever spoke to like me. The first Hogwarts student. Hagrid was the first wizard I ever met.” He wonders if he should be embarrassed about that but then realizes no. He shouldn’t. "Hagrid was the first person in my life who was patient with me, and nice. And that day in
"I can't," Draco says desperately, reeling at his friends abandoning him. "I told you, he hates me and it's over now-"
“Oh, I’m sorry, were you wanting me to get yours for you?” Pansy feigns ignorance and goes on talking loudly in that high-pitched voice that is making Draco want to hide under his pillow to drown it out.
“Why not?” Harry asks, pretending to be dumb. Wanting Malfoy to say it.
So. That is that. Harry has had crushes before. He’d had one on Cho, and on Ginny. Now that he has one on Malfoy he figures he can deal with it. He has experience with this stuff, even if it is limited. He knows the rules.
“Yes. Has been all week.” The witch cocks her head a bit, eyes appraising. “I would have thought you put him up to it to be honest Harry.”
“Yes, well, no need to tell the world,” Draco shifts uncomfortably in his seat which makes Hagrid laugh.
“Or my arse. Both are points of pride.”
She takes a breath. “But I’ve been pleasantly surprised by you both over the course of your years here. Not just in your subjects and grades, but as people. It has been a remarkable privilege,” her voice catches ever so slightly before she clears her throat, “to watch the two of you become the wizards you are.”
Blaise looks tired as he continues. There's a strain on his face that hadn't been there last year, even after the war. If Draco were his normal self he would feel bad about that.
“It’s quite cold out today,” Harry says. “If you could give me a few minutes to grab my things-”
“Oh.” Neville looks trapped. “Well talk to Pansy, I’m sure she’ll figure something out. Most of us are pretty excited about it actually.” He adds, a slight tinge making his cheeks pink and Harry immediately feels bad about protesting.
"What are you on about?" Harry demands. "I don't- what are you trying to say-"
Her face is pinched. “Harry, I know you and Draco had some kind of falling out and last night was the first time you’ve seen him since Hogwarts. Is that what made you come home?”
With one last glance backwards Harry follows.
She smiles a bit this time. “Anything else?”
"Of course, Mother." He says again, leaning forward to kiss her cheek. "I'll miss you."
“I’ll be back soon.” Draco promises quickly, feeling guilty.
The next day Draco wakes up and somehow his head isn’t pounding. He feels fine actually. A bit tired if anything.
Draco looks at the compartment he's about to step into. Completely empty.
it was wrong. To avoid it happening again. It wasn’t one bad upbringing and it wasn’t Voldemort alone who fought that war, it was a huge army of people and creatures who hated the Ministry. My family was wrong, our ideals were wrong, but what about the giants? They didn’t hate Muggles or Muggleborns, they just wanted fair treatment. The Ministry wasn’t giving them that.”
They’re lying in Draco’s bed when the door opens and Blaise comes through, only to stop in his tracks and stare at them in complete shock.
Her good mood disappears in an instant, but this time she’s not mad. “I don’t think so.” She says sadly. “No fresh starts for me. I’m stuck here.” She glances at him. “You’re lucky you know. Not everyone has second chances like you do.”
Harry’s grin returns.
“’Course not.” He murmurs, moving towards the bed and slipping under the covers again to be beside Draco. Grey eyes take in the robe he’s wearing with appreciation and a touch of possessiveness and Harry remembers what Draco gets like whenever he wears his clothes.
“Who indeed?” Harry says through another smile.
“No, it’s all- everything’s okay now. My parents are pretty pleased, actually, as weird as that is.” He feels his face screw up. “And there’s loads of ways for two wizards to have kids now. It was just… Voldemort and me being afraid. You know.”
"Oh really?"
“Draco-” Harry says and he’s embarrassed when his voice actually cracks as Draco traces the scar again.
Neville frowns. "We're supposed to be putting all of that behind us now, aren't we? House rivalries and all that?"
“Goodbye, Draco. All the best to your parents.” Snape replies with a nod and Draco turns away.
Draco shrugs.
. And though Harry knows Draco lashes out when he feels cornered that knowledge isn’t enough to dull his own response to Draco’s words.
Blaise hesitates again, but this time he doesn't say. "I won't tell you, Harry."
She sees Harry looking and smiles, her brown eyes crinkling warmly. “I just came from getting Christmas lunch ready at my family’s. Didn’t feel like changing.”
When he comes down the stairs all dressed up, he has to admit that it could be worse. Much, much worse.
“The kind of fame your parents have isn’t ostentatious or something forced down people’s throats. They were genuinely loved by the people who knew them, and they are missed and remembered today because people appreciated and cared about them. That kind of remembrance isn’t one borne out of false acclaim, Harry, and it has lasted this long because there are people still alive who make sure of it. Memorials like that old house or this statue come from love, and true grief. Not an effort to gain local fame or political capital. There’s a reason people still talk about James and Lily Potter, and it’s not just because their son is the most famous wizard alive. It’s because they deserve it.”
Draco’s blonde hair is striking as he stands outside against the closed door and Harry gives a quick wave, unable to help himself.
Though it surprises Harry, it doesn’t take long for the tension in the room to ease drastically.
“Yes, yes, you rocked my world.”
“Oh.” Harry frowns. “Right.”
Blaise sighs and it sounds defeated. His eyes slip closed when he says. “I wish you weren’t.”
“From Slughorn?” Harry asks in a valiant attempt to change the subject, pointing at a picture of what must undoubtedly have been a Slug Club from years ago. His mother is pictured sitting amongst a group of other pimply faced students with Professor Slughorn standing at the back of them.
“I was practically in love,” Harry confirms, ignoring his teasing. For a moment Draco wonders where Chang is this year- she’s one of many from their age group who chose not to return for Eighth Year. “Or as much as a person can be with a first serious crush anyway.”
“Right.” Ron says doubtfully, chewing on a handful of caramel popcorn. “Well, good luck. And say hi from us, yeah?”
“Do you mean Muggles?”
Then he kisses him.
Blaise had braved asking him while they’d both been sitting in the Gryffindor Common Room. Harry had been doing some reading from Potions and feeling like he’d rather fight another dragon and Blaise had been waiting for Ginny to come down so the two of them could spend the morning together.
There’s a short silence and then Draco’s voice says, “Night Harry.”
Draco sneers. "That's not what I remember from Hogwarts."
Draco’s hand clenches on his arm before finally letting go. His smile is shy, and Harry feels his heart lurch. “Hi.”
Before he loses his nerve he
Harry grins, moving back to his chair, trying to make sure it isn’t obvious he has the start of a raging hard on and is thinking about getting out of here with Draco and doing more delicious things to his mouth.
“It’ll be great.”
everything he’d wanted. Here is the reason Draco had ended their relationship, the real reason. He still loves Harry and always has. And now he is finally brave enough and in a place where he can try and do whatever it takes for their relationship to work.
He neck hurts from how fast he looks at Harry. The other man is nervous, Draco can tell, and he’s fidgeting with his hands. It’s nearly impossible for Draco to resist stopping him by gripping them in his own.
Draco laughs louder at that. “You’re right about that.”
Draco nods. “I won’t, of course. But they haven’t given up yet and until they do I definitely can’t drop this news on them.”
Draco had hated being ignored because nobody had ever done it to him before.
“Hello again.” He smiles in embarrassment. “I’m sorry I haven’t visited lately. It’s been rubbish of me.”
“Maybe,” Draco says, making Harry snap out of his pondering. The sounds of everybody around them talking and dishing food rushes back, along with the curious looks from Lynne, Cory and Nelson. Harry hopes he’s not blushing. “Don’t let it go to your head. Merlin knows it’s big enough already.”
, Harry. The Ministry is still corrupt, I don’t see that having changed since Voldemort died. And yes, Pureblood extremists were wrong about a lot of things, but this trend we’re seeing of trying to move completely away from wizard history and tradition- I don’t see the point of it. We should remember our past and be proud of the things we did right while acknowledging the things we did wrong too. It all worked together to bring us here, didn’t it? It happened, and we can’t try and lie, or forget it.
“I already told you-”
Draco’s breath catches as his old Potions Professor raises one eyebrow at him as if to ask,
Neither of them get any time to reply, because before the words are even out of her mouth Ron whips open the door and Hermione pushes them both through.
Draco curses.
"Oh, that." Blaise's voice is suddenly completely casual, which causes Draco to stop writing and look at him with a hint of trepidation. Blaise soldiers on anyway. "Speaking of Miss Ginevra Weasley. I proposed to her last night."
Draco meets his eyes steadily, waiting, and suddenly Harry knows it doesn’t matter what they say. It’s just goodbye for a week and Draco knows it all already. This week has brought them closer than Harry could have imagined and he’s not sure what he can say to end it, or to encapsulate all of that.  Anything important can’t be said in front of the adults anyway.
“Oi yourself,” Draco retorts. “Honestly, you’re thick, calling your own boyfriend ugly-”
Harry frowns. “I thought you weren’t either.”
Maybe now that they’ve slept together one last time Harry has realized he doesn’t actually want Draco anymore. Perhaps today has allowed Harry to see that Draco isn’t worth it.
Harry’s smile falls and guilt flares up in his stomach. “Oh.”
She looks back to Draco. “Yes. Yes, of course. Ron, get me a drink please? And Harry, save us some seats?”
"Draco?" Blaise sticks his head over the staircase railing leading up to their house's second floor. "I thought I heard your annoyingly high-pitched whine."
“They didn’t need to know he walked in on us-”
“They all fought in the battle. Before that too. Fought for you, most of them. Under your leadership. I’d say it counts.”
They’ve known each other for years after all. Draco knows what he looks like by now.
“Your neck is covered in hickeys you fool.” She pulls back and sniffs, eyes wet. “I am very happy for you. But I am also angry. It’s not a great combination.”
“In a bit,” he replies.
“I think most of us will be married with kids in 20 years.” Draco replies with an unreadable look on his face.
Blaise doesn’t react outwardly, just taking Draco in calmly. “You’re serious?”
“How connected all of us have been, how similar we all are without having noticed before. Like our entire lives have been parallel to one another. I’m distantly related to Draco and was locked in his dungeon but we grew up entirely separate, never saying a word to each other. Now here we are.” She shoots him a smile and Harry sees Draco stare blankly back at her. “And you and Draco, Harry, you’re so alike. Or Ron and Ginny being Purebloods but never going to Slytherin. It’s just strange, to think that if one thing had been different here or there, everything else would be different now too.”
"No, I wasn't either." Draco admits, beginning to trace patterns on Harry's exposed forearm. "Pansy was very fed up with me by morning. Apparently I’d been more miserable than usual, drinking myself to sleep, glaring moodily at the fire, that kind of thing. She said I was a right prick."
"Which means he doesn't despise me as much as we all thought he did," Draco says brightly. "If I can use that-"
“No. They were too busy staring like you were.” Blaise’s voice goes a little harder. “What’s Potter playing at?”
He quickly looks down, thinking of something else, anything else. Thinking that this year he won't have Greg and Crabbe by his side, since Greg didn't want to come back and Crabbe... well.
“Tomorrow?”
There’s a long moment before Draco’s face hardens and his words are empty. “Go home, Potter.”
Harry jumps as Millie appears beside him, drawing his attention away from Ron and Blaise who have just begun a quiet conversation.
“Bye guys!” Harry calls and it occurs to Draco that Ron should really be
“Okay.” Harry says, and then Draco is twisting them, keeping a firm grip on Harry the whole time until they pop out on the pavement in front of Number 12 Grimmauld Place.
Or at least it’s what he’d said to Draco when the blonde had half-heartedly pulled away and suggested maybe opening their books, to which Harry had enthusiastically grabbed him in another kiss. Then the sound of sharp footsteps had sounded nearby and they’d sprung away, turning around to stare at the book spines while Madame Pince walked past them with a frown.
“Alright then.” They get out of the blankets slowly,
He wanders the room and socializes for a while, spending a good part of the night catching up with Thelonius Karlton, his old mentor. After gaining his Masters in Potions Draco hadn’t had a reason to stay in as close of contact with him and before Draco knows it they’re falling back into their familiar age- old debate of whether harpy talon or centaur hoof is the better ingredient for
Harry sucks in a breath.
Ron surprises Harry by broaching the subject they’ve both avoided since Blaise told them Draco was his best man. “Mate.”
Besides. It’s nice to not have to see his friends moping or crying over each other anymore. Whenever the two of them fight these days it’s easy enough for him to bluntly remind them that they love each other and will make up eventually, so they should stop wasting time and just talk it out.
“Who cares? We’re adults and it’s cheaper to use the supplies from the Potions closet than buying it. Draco makes the best hangover potion.”
Mother's advice is ringing in his head after all. If he can somehow become civil with Potter it will do wonders for the family reputation.
“Both. God.” He groans and presses the heels of his hands against his eyes. “We should have done this ages ago. Years. We’ve been wasting
“Oh, Potter.” Draco says, and for some reason Harry’s stomach tightens at the words. “You are so on.”
"Why?"
Millie snorts. “Neville doesn’t drink at all; nobody knows what his tolerance is like.”
Harry
Does he really want that again?
He doesn't reply to the letter he'd gotten from Blaise the day after he'd arrived home. It had only been two lines, but Draco had cast an
Draco grimaces. “Pansy. But Blaise is a close second.”
“Over here.” Harry says and moves down the rows until eventually he leads Draco to stand in front of the shared headstone.
“Oh I don’t know,” Draco’s smile is tiny, pained and knowing. “You’re pretty self-sacrificing sometimes. I’d hate to be on the receiving end of that.”
The air between them lightens considerably. “Are you asking for them to start up again?”
“Ah, I’m sorry love, I don’t mean to make you uncomfortable.” She hurries to say. “That’s the last thing I want. I just want you to know that I’m glad my son chose to sit with you that day on the train, Harry. I’m glad you saw something in him, saw what Arthur and I see everyday, and that you chose to be his friend. And I trust you, my dear. So if you say that the Slytherins aren’t like their parents, that there’s something in them you see that makes you take a chance on them, then I believe you.”
“I’m a Death Eater, which is as good as.” He taps his own wrist. “Even have the tattoo to prove it.”
Harry cocks his head in surprise. “Don’t tell me you wish the letters had been real?”
Ginny bursts out laughing and their conversation devolves into whispers.
He sees the small smile break out on Draco’s face. "Yes."
Draco smiles back just as sadly. Say what you will about Myrtle but she’s more layered than anyone gives her credit for, especially Draco. “Thanks Myrtle.”
Malfoy said nothing.
He’s breathless but he still says, “fuck, come
Jaws drop.
Draco practically freezes beside him.
And what Draco remembers is this.
Why had he done that?
Draco seems nervous as hell but he soldiers on. “About it all. I have been going back and forth and I’m sorry. I have been dragging this out even though I don’t want to hide any more. And I don’t want to lose you. I have been… deplorable,” Draco says. “It has come to my attention that in a manner of speaking I’ve been stringing you along. And I hate myself for that because you’re the last person in the world I want to hurt. At the end of it all, you’re the one I’m going to want with me. You’re who I want. And I want us to live together side-by-side rather than in hiding. I’m choosing you.”
“Exactly the point.”
,” and it’s a broken prayer of reverence as he climaxes, clenching everywhere and spurting all across Harry’s chest.
This time he feels it, and his eyes open to see a thick and shimmering cloud of silver mist come from his wand. It forms a hazy sort of shield in front of both he and Harry for a moment before disappearing, and Draco frowns at how quickly it goes. Harry’s had lasted way longer than that. And been corporeal.
“Alright, message received.”
It’s Pansy’s voice and she sounds concerned but he doesn’t even look up. “Shh.” He hisses, eyes quickly scanning the news article.
She lets a hand caress his cheek. “Because your father and I know what loving you feels like better than anybody in this world. We could recognize it in Severus.” Her smile turns a bit sad. “I could recognize it in Harry, when he was here with you for Christmas during your Eighth Year.”
Harry rolls his eyes, trying to ignore his own blush. “I’ll steal it from you sometime.”
Harry is falling to pieces all over the floor.
“Want us to come?”
every other week? Why would Harry Potter spare a second to wonder about Draco’s reaction?
“Oh did you?” Draco replies, moving forward. Lily appears in the door behind him and Harry winks at her quickly which makes Draco smile briefly. “Why am I not surprised?”
Harry’s eyes widen and before Draco can blink he’s gripping him to spin Draco around and meet his eyes. “Never.” He says fiercely and Harry’s vehemence shocks and thrills him in equal measure. “Never, Draco, I swear.”
Snowflakes have begun to fall softly and he looks up, bags gripped tightly in his black finger-glove clad hands. The moisture is cold and wet once it melts but he can’t help but stop and take in the moment.
“Of course I bloody well want to!” Harry shouts. “Draco I want this entire castle to know that you are my person, the one you just described. And I want them to know that I’m yours. I don’t want to have to worry about stepping too close or looking at you too long. Or to come up with excuses for why I go to you when I need someone with me. Because it’s exhausting and I-”
“-then she wouldn’t know a thing, would she?”
They walk in, Harry and McGonagall confidently and Draco trailing behind, taking everything in. His father had been in here numerous times and always said it was cluttered but Draco thinks it’s neat. Organized.
“You’re bright as a tomato.”
Blaise turns to him so suddenly that Harry has to abort his step forward to turn and face him. His friend looks nervous, Harry realizes suddenly, and more concerned than Harry had initially seen.
Eventually they stop needing excuses and it just becomes a thing for the Eighth Years (and a couple of the Seventh Years) to do every Friday night. Different people show up every week. Once almost all of the Eighth Years were there and the Room was designed as if it was a night club, with music coming from all around even though there were no speakers or gramophones in sight. It was dark with a dancefloor, and drinks on a table at one side of the room, and there were over 30 students all standing off to the side talking while others were dancing with each other.
Harry watches Draco the entire time, and it is only because of that he sees the other boy flinch before he straightens and stares resolutely up at the panel of witches and wizards.
“Even if it meant things didn’t end up like now and we were still at each other’s throats all the time?”
“Excuse me?” Draco practically spits and then realizes that may be proving Harry’s point and slumps back and crosses his arms to pout.
“That wasn’t the question.” Blaise says finally and Draco smiles.
“I know.” Harry says fiercely, beginning to pull at the grass. “So we had our friends to worry about, the press, our history… and honestly I don’t know if either of us really believed it would work out this long. Sure the feelings were strong and everything,” Harry shifts a bit uncomfortably but Blaise allows him to go on, “but I just couldn’t believe things wouldn’t fall apart just because- well. It’s us.”
Anticipation fills Harry and he watches as Draco looks down at his lips, taking in his entire face with his darkening eyes like he’s memorizing every detail.
“So what were you doing?”
not planning on bringing books, parchment or quills to class
“Alright. Good.”
. People are threatening you because we were seen walking around school together. You’re being called mentally instable, and parents are screaming at you about setting a bad example and disappointing everybody. And you think
Even how pale Draco is only makes Harry more appreciative of the times he blushes. It really is distracting.
“But then why- he hated you.” Draco frowns and tries to say his next thought with tact. “And Dumbledore failed. Why keep spying?”
“No more horrible than anyone else in that matter.” Harry says. “Luna told me people hid her stuff before the last day of school one year. Took her forever to find it all again.”
Potter jolts a bit. "Um- guess I got a bit distracted."
For the first time in his life Harry feels like maybe he’s properly grieved his parents.
“Not all of it was a lie.” Snape says, voice suddenly as cool as ever, expression to match. “Remember that.”
“Um…”
Harry hesitates only a second before grabbing it, but when he does they both exhale sharply, looking down at where their hands grip one another.
Harry nods mutely, still looking at their hands. His is almost starting to hurt now from the grip she has on it.
“Hey Pansy.” Harry says easily. “Why are you all standing there? Come sit.”
"Erm, consider it forgotten."
“And why is that?” Ginny asks, turning back round to them and sounding slightly accusing.
Ginny had made it clear if they were staying out past two she would rather Blaise stayed at Draco’s than come home and wake her up, since she has a big game with the Holyhead Harpies tomorrow. Draco had completely understood and assured her that he wouldn’t let Blaise wake her up, no matter how much the other Slytherin pouted.
Narcissa’s face hardens and she looks down at the papers in Draco’s grip. “Nor do I. But we’re about to find out.”
Draco clears his throat. “Not particularly,” he replies, but it’s a lie and they all know it.
Harry pales.
Harry nods, ignoring Ron’s ashamed look. “Wasn’t one of our better days either. We were attacked by Nagini and my wand was broken. Wouldn’t recommend it.”
Hermione will be busy with Kingsley, Harry knows. And Seamus and Dean are on holiday for two weeks in Spain. Parvati and Padma are likely busy down in the Department of Mysteries doing whatever it is those two do. They’ve never been allowed to tell him and Harry honestly hadn’t bothered to really ask before.
“No I- you know what I mean you berk.” Draco laughed nervously.
Harry tenses.
Harry meets Draco’s eyes. “It bothered me this time.”
Being friends with Harry is good. Great, one could say.
Narcissa is watching the fire expectantly but she does spare Draco a glance for a moment. “We may not have been the most loved family after the War but we have always had money, sweetheart. A few workers of Azkaban can be convinced to break the rules when it’s just a little harmless note-passing between husband and wife.”
“Um,” Harry glances at Ron and Hermione.
Harry smiles at the repeated offer but his reply doesn’t change. “It’s alright, Hermione. I’ll see you both on Christmas at the Weasley’s.”
“Because we’re nervous?”
Draco just presses his face into the crook of Harry’s neck and breathes in deeply, feeling the silent tears fall down his own face.
He doesn’t hear the door close behind him and when he slips through the gate he allows himself a glance, just for a moment.
Going public isn’t an option for him, at least not yet.
“Who needs help?” Harry asks smugly from where he is straddling Draco on the bed. “You’re the one lying there helpless-”
Harry snaps his mouth shut but can’t help but feel a bit satisfied at the look on Draco’s face. They go up to the dorms in silence and then as soon as the door is closed behind them and they see nobody else is in the room Draco is turning around and pushing Harry back against the door, mouth moving hungrily against Harry’s and making his heart race.
“You didn’t regret it enough to stop.”
“Do people say that to each other?”
“It’s good to see you,” he whispers, and Draco clings tighter before clearing his throat and stepping back.
, the prat, and Harry feels that deep curl of something hot tighten in his belly, feels the excitement of a challenge rise in him.
Tosser. Draco is sure that’s true, given Krum is such good friends with Hermione. He and Harry had probably exchanged letters, what did Potter need a lousy autograph for?
“Okay.”
“Are you wanting anything, mate?” The mohawked bartender smiles at him to gentle her shout over the music.
Her expression turns sympathetic. “At least you made it on time.”
“The Dursley’s?” Draco asks softly, and Potter startles now.
His doubts and fears slip away and he meets Harry’s eyes and sees his happiness reflected back at him.
And Draco, who acts confident and sure, who knows he isn’t
“What?” Draco whispers back.
Oh, dear Merlin.
"Blimey, mate-"
“No!” Draco denies. “I didn’t- it wasn’t that. Look, it’s always been complicated between Harry and I, alright? Back then it’s not that I liked him in that way. It’s just that I wanted him to notice me.”
He thinks of roaring fire, flames and heat licking at his back, making him sweat through his clothes. He thinks of pressing right against Harry on that broom, barely making it out of the door as the fire chased them.
Blaise lets out a breath. "I never thought I'd get here."
He’s also heard rumours that Kingsley’s personal aide, a lovely wizard named Herman, is retiring sometime in the next few years.
“Harry!” Hermione comes over and wraps him in a hug, flushed from dancing. Her light blue dress reminds him a bit of the one she wore to the Yule Ball and her hair is braided in a fancy updo that highlights her face. She’s grinning in a way that lets Harry know she’s at least tipsy. “What are you doing over here? Oh, hello Mr. Chester.”
Harry rolls his eyes. “Ron you can’t treat every owl like they’re Pig. Hedwig was great.”
“But,” Nelson blushes crimson when they all look at him. Maybe he hadn’t meant to say anything. “But he’s
“All right.” The Headmistress agrees and she nods. “Narcissa. Draco.”
Draco and Harry continue to glare at one another until Draco rolls his eyes.
“Good book?” Harry asks him.
Chapter title taken from the song Hope is a Heartache by LÉON.
He winces again. “I’m sorry-”
“It’s about what we want.” Harry says. “And the only one I want is you.”
“Yeah.” Harry scuffs a shoe against the rug in Draco’s room. Draco wonders if he thought the snake design on the edge of it was too much. He’d never thought so until now with Harry standing in his room. “The Death Eaters were chasing me at the beginning of last summer. She got caught in the crossfire.”
Draco's mouth snaps shut. Heads of people listening to the conversation whip away to watch an oblivious Slughorn once more.
Harry remembers that day years ago when he'd followed Draco down to the Hogwarts dungeons. He remembers the feeling in his stomach, that sick, sick feeling of hope he wasn't able to squash, even after the words Draco had spat in his face minutes earlier.
“Draco.” The name is a harsh pant from Harry’s lips, making his lungs burn and when had he forgotten to breathe? There is a growing ache in the pit of his stomach and it’s making his mind swirl and thoughts evaporate. “Please, just-”
His smile comes back as his heart beats faster. “Okay. Good.”
“Good.” He says and finally he looks over to meet Draco’s eyes, the two of them sharing a smile. “So am I.”
“Get on with it then.” Harry
He’d meant for it to be a joke, a continuation of their teasing, but when her eyes widen and her cheeks grow pink he feels his expression morph into one of surprise.
“Please tell me I’m right and we’re not about to make out on Longbottom’s bed.” Draco says and Harry smiles.
Draco pouts and mutters things about cheating when Harry catches the Snitch for a second time, and Harry smiles privately, shutting the balls back in their case and putting it away before going with Draco to shower.
and all the while Harry is slowly picking up a few things here and there for people. Soon he’s gotten presents for the Weasley family and Hermione. He gets Hagrid a large tin of every-flavoured fudge (every
The Slytherin resists the urge to smirk and places his marker in the book he is currently reading, letting it close before resting it in his lap. “My gift?”
She shrugs at him, but the worry has left her eyes and she looks happier than she did a second ago. "It could be worse."
emblazoned across the front cover and a fancy emblazoned letter from the Potions Guild attached to notify him. This particular issue of the magazine is set to come out next week, days before the ceremony.
Draco pretends he hasn’t heard, stepping back and shaking his head as he answers her.
“What do you mean?” Draco feels as if he’s been thrown off his feet. “I told you. There’s someone I want to be with, if he’ll have me. I won’t pretend for you and Father any longer.”
But she only smiles and nods, stepping back and letting him feel like he could breathe again. “Of course, how silly of me.”
“Yes.” Andromeda sounds incredibly fond. “He is.”
Draco flinches. "But-"
She nods, relaxing as he cups her elbow. “Do you want me to go?”
There’s more. Harry knows he’s treading a dangerous line, testing the limits of his self-restraint. His desire for Draco, something he’d thought dormant for years, is slowly smoldering back to life and quickly becoming an uncomfortable flare, impossible to ignore and deny. He feels his skin come to life in anticipation whenever he has to brush past Draco, whether it is to grab a file or go out the door. And his stomach will always tighten at the smell of the office that is quickly taking on the wizard’s familiar scent.
But now isn’t the time to worry about things like that.
“Always sticking up for the underdog, Ron.” Harry nods, taking a small sip of juice to hide his grin.
“What, an orgasm was all I needed to do it successfully? Sorry to burst your bubble Potter but I’ve been giving myself those for years already.” Draco turns to lie on his side and face Harry too.
“Absolutely.” Blaise says. “Potter here was just asking what it was about Hagrid that made him so much more interesting than all of us milling around in here, and you know, I didn’t have an answer. What
She makes a frustrated sound. “Get Harry to do it, you’ll probably end up telling him who you have anyway. Or me or Blaise, we’ll stick to the rules. Or make something. A year’s worth of Hangover Potion would be readily accepted by any of us, I’m sure.”
He glances back at Harry to see him suddenly deep in conversation with Theo about something or other, looking very concerned, and Theo nodding right back at him appearing just as invested. Whatever it is seems serious, but Draco is welling to bet it’s actually nothing more important than Quidditch or something.
His heart sinks. Probably for the best. Maybe now it will be another two and a half years before they see one another.
Right then.
Harry wants to ask him.
But Draco had wanted to kiss Harry so badly.
Though Draco’s had a bit of a heads up to wrap his mind around it so he’s not as shocked as he was.
But had she listened? Had any of them listened?
Draco looks at him out of the corner of his eye and how has Harry not noticed before that Draco is slightly taller than he is?
didn’t tell her!”
Draco presses his lips together tightly in disappointment and distaste before nodding. “Alright. Thank you.”
“Well you were both doing a rubbish job at sorting it out.” Ron says grumpily, ignoring Harry’s glare. “Look I don’t know and I don’t need to know. Just do something apart from moping everywhere.”
He’d stretched the truth a bit last night too. Draco had not only done everything in a week. Really he’d had the idea about a month ago when the Creevey girl had come up to him with the photos she’d taken. It had seemed as good of a present to get Harry as any- and Draco had decided even before the Secret Santa game that he was going to get Harry a gift.
He shows up to the gala with Mother on one arm and Pansy on the other and is almost immediately bombarded with people coming up to congratulate him and then others coming to take his picture.
He shoves his notes in the space between them. "Well, you'll want them," he snaps, sounding condescending to his own ears. "Given that in the questionnaire we all took yesterday you failed every single one relating to phoenix ash."
“I have Crookshanks,” he mutters and Hermione narrows her eyes.
“Me and Pansy?” Draco tries to remember if anything had ever happened there. When he thinks of Pansy like that he thinks of past kisses from spin-the-bottle and nights spent alone in the Common Room where the two of them would talk until early morning. Pansy is the only one who Draco has ever told about his sexuality, and in return he knows more about her than anyone, even Blaise. They’re close but not like that. Though to be fair, back a few years ago in sixth year, when pressure from both of their parents had been particularly bad, the thought had briefly crossed Draco’s mind. “She’s something of a sister to me, I suppose.”
“No,” Draco says with a small tremble in his voice. “But we came up here for a reason. You’ll have to leave for Hogsmeade soon.”
“A party. For Halloween.” Potter looks almost embarrassed as he avoids Draco’s stare, resolutely hiking up the hill to the school with his broom over one shoulder. “Luna told me about it. She said I could invite whoever I wanted and-”
“Obviously not.” Draco snaps in irritation.
He knows he’s taking too long to answer. The uncertainty that creeps into Draco’s expression is plain to see and the nerves Draco is obviously feeling makes his voice shake as he asks.
that Draco hides away in Malfoy Manor now that he’s back in England, or that he rarely answers their friend's letters, fire messages and Floo calls. It doesn't phase him when he learns that Draco's working on a potion to help regulate people's magic, something that could greatly help hospital patients in controlling themselves in emotional and stressful situations. And when he accidentally hears Pansy whispering to Millie that she'd found not one but two men leaving Draco's room one morning, he walks right past, pretending he hadn't heard a thing instead of throwing something at the wall like he'd wanted to do.
“I don’t want to hurt you.”
“Never thought you had it in you, Harry.” Ernie says as he moves forward again. Draco still hasn’t moved from where he was still sitting on the floor and Harry is practically crawling towards him to get to the bottle.
“Passed out in the middle of a hug. Took me ages to get her down onto the bed without waking her up again.”
“Why she’s Skeeter of course.” The Slytherin answers. “See the curls? The red lipsticks, the outfit? And Neville’s her quill.”
There’s a small part of Harry that thought he might. Draco has never been known for his bravery after all.
“Last year I thought you would visit.” She interrupts. “Everything was so awful I thought you might want somebody to talk to.”
“Even if you hadn’t stayed, I’ve always wanted to spend my last Christmas break at Hogwarts. Now that I’m here it’s so…”
This time Harry slips his hand down to quietly hold Draco’s, pulling it down to hide it below their robes as they sit side by side. He’s barely surprised when the blonde doesn’t resist this time.
And exactly the sort of thing he has expected from Malfoy Manor.
Harry frowns. “That’s… I’m really sorry, Draco. But what about the others? Blaise, Theo and Millie? Or Goyle? Does he know?”
Draco laughs and spreads his arms slightly. His metallic gold robes shimmer in the dim lighting somehow, and with his arms raised Harry sees the illusion of fluttering wings. “No, Potter, I’m-”
Harry smiles, waiting a few seconds before daring to interrupt once more. “Feel like a movie?”
A few of the younger kids give them startled glances as they go through the Common Room and Harry can’t really blame them. It’s late, almost curfew, and no one else really knows about the parties the Eighth Years have in the Room of Requirement. A few kids narrow their eyes in suspicion, and one Prefect taps his badge meaningfully, but when Harry and Draco both raise their eyebrows at him in challenge his head ducks down to look back at his book.
“I am.”
“Draco, please.”
Harry would have done the same but as his team scores goal after goal in rapid succession he’s pretty sure he doesn’t need to.
Pansy’s eyes narrow further, losing all trace of amusement and making her face scrunch unattractively. “Draco-”
Draco hopes it doesn’t look like he runs to the elevator even though if he’s being honest that’s exactly how it feels.
Draco thinks back to being terrified when Harry appeared back after the maze with Cedric’s dead body and being the first out of his friends to see them, the first to see Harry shaking as he lay on the ground over Cedric’s unmoving body and the first to realize the terrible truth as he’d said, “he’s dead.”
Draco continues unrelenting. “I know you don’t like to open up because you feel like it burdens people.”
“Oi!”
“Am I?” Harry asks in surprise.
“What in Merlin’s name was
He chokes.
“He’s right, Minerva.” Snape speaks for the first time, making all eyes shoot to him and Draco jumps. He’s met with black eyes watching him closely and, shockingly, something like pride in Snape’s expression. “If he says they’re fine they are. Anything else the students can handle themselves.”
“Are you upset? That reaction doesn’t tell me if you’re upset or not.”
“Get someone good?” He asks before he can help himself.
“He is a good kisser.” Draco says and she squeals again. “But Myrtle you don’t understand, this is a mess.”
“Not a one.” Draco says.
“Goodbye,” Draco says softly and then he is going and leading the way out of the office.
She nods. “Yes, but sometimes I give them extra treats. I like the company.”
Within the first morning back at Hogwarts Harry realizes how sick he is of the whispers.
Blaise looks around at their friends before he meets Draco’s eyes calmly. “I’m sorry, is that something we were just never going to talk about?”
“And your dad?” Draco asks, caught up despite himself. “Is that when she fell in love with him?”
“Then why did you leave?”
Instantly Harry tenses. “
"I'm in love with him," Draco says, squeezing his eyes shut to stop the insistent tears, but that only makes the memory of Harry's stricken face clearer, making him gasp. "I'm still in love with him Blaise, and we've- the two of us- he asked me to tell him the truth and I lied, I told him I didn't love him anymore but I do, and I can't stop, and it
“Pansy-” Draco starts, but she shushes him.
Five feet, or roughly that. That is all the distance between Draco’s bare arse and Potter’s-
Their eyes are locked for a few seconds and then, slowly, Draco’s hand shifts, moving over, and he carefully traces the scar with his index finger.
Neville blushes like mad.
Draco stares at Harry, not sure what exactly is happening. He blinks.
Harry finally looks away from making faces at Teddy to see the three of them staring at him and his godson. He feels self conscious for a moment.
The blonde steps back, rolling his shoulders, a gesture that Harry knows means Malfoy is thrown.
“Okay, okay.” Harry is still frowning. “I think I understand, at least a bit.”
(It doesn’t matter that sex with Harry is still the best sex Draco has ever had or that he still loves him. Those things are easily ignored when the alternative is not spending time with Harry at all.)
Draco’s mother presses her lips tightly together but chooses not to rise to the barb. “Very well.”
“Yes.” He bolts up and accepts the offer gratefully, hurriedly putting down his half-full teacup on the coffee table. “That would be… good.”
He doesn’t even give an excuse to the others, he just leaves, heading to the dorms and hoping that someone will think to gather his books for him. Truthfully those are the least of his worries right now, what with everything he’s just realized weighing heavily on his mind.
Her face warms. “Were either of you tempted?”
“Not good ones.”
“Obviously it’s a book on Potions.” Draco tells him drily. “Third year level. Wouldn’t want to tax that brain of yours.”
Harry shakes his head. First he has to make it through this party. Get through Halloween, get through the feast, through the party, don’t do anything stupid… he can do that.
He looks away, back to Draco and Teddy, and tucks the thought away for closer examination later, not entirely sure where it came from or how he reached it. Still, he knows that’s what it is. Narcissa’s protective mothering of Draco the same way Petunia had mothered Dudley, her strained relationship with her sister… Though of course Narcissa is trying to fix that now.
“Speech!” He hears Ron, Theo and Ginny holler and his attention is brought back to the fact that he’s standing on stage in front of a podium with everybody staring at him.
“Good for you, Myrtle,” Harry says absently and Draco hums in agreement. “Look, I’m sorry, but I think-”
“Wanted what?” Harry asks in bewilderment but Draco doesn’t even hear him, too nervous as he finishes speaking.
“Because I’m tired.” He answers finally and Draco blinks at the honesty in his voice. Harry looks up and pins Draco with his gaze. “I don’t want to be angry at you anymore and I don’t want the others to always be worried about saying your name around me. I thought maybe having you on the case, working together a bit… maybe it would help. A professional setting will force us to keep things civil, maybe eventually we’ll just… fall back into it. Things might settle back into how they used to be when we were friends.”
“And if Draco hasn’t said it yet I might as well.” Expression soft and maybe even a bit hopeful Narcissa smiles. “You have our blessing, you and Draco. I don’t know how much it matters to you, or to him at this point for that matter, but I’d like you to know that. As long as you make Draco happy we could never disapprove. To be honest Potter,” and she lowers her voice as if telling him a secret, “we’re quite happy it’s you.”
Ginny hands him his cup of tea. "Drink that," she says gently. "Blaise can go and find some blankets and pajamas for you."
“I already told you to. Don’t tell me you’ve grown forgetful these past couple of years?”
He has to sit beside Harry in Potions and Muggle Studies and feel the air crackle between them with everything they aren’t saying to each other. The amount of times he catches Harry looking at him is ridiculous, and Draco would normally mock him endlessly for it if he didn’t know Harry has caught him doing the same just as often.
It isn’t much but it is better than being nude.
“Thank you.” He looks up at his best friends again. Both are watching him, waiting for an answer, but Harry thinks he needs to finish thinking everything over by himself now. “For everything.”
“You can’t be serious.” Ron splutters in total confusion. “Why?”
She shrugs. "Well, yes, Harry, and please don't be upset. We never told anybody else. It's just we thought you both ended it since the school year was over and Draco was leaving for France. Neither of us realized you two were still in love."
Something in Harry’s gut twists and he hates it, tries to push it down, because he feels horrible about it. Really. He hates that he’s started to avoid his best friends and that sometimes he’d rather be alone than with them because he gets jealous.
Everyone looks at her.
One of them is shaking and he’s pretty sure it isn’t him, but the fact only distantly registers as he and Harry slowly drop down to the floor in front of the door. He’s turning before he consciously thinks to and slides his arms over Harry’s shoulders to press them chest-to-chest.
“Thanks a lot.”
He stands up and starts walking towards the kitchen door. “Thanks for stopping by Hermione.”
“I said no because of my parents!” Draco shoots back. “That’s obviously something you’re unable to understand!”
“Thank you, Myrtle.”
“I know Ron.” It takes a second to find the words and in the end all Harry says is, “Thank you.”
Someone makes a choked noise and it takes Harry a moment to realize that it was
The Ravenclaw smiles. “That’s lovely.”
“It’s been a few hours, I think I’m allowed it at this point. Besides Ron is the sober one tonight. Probably the reason he’s been itching to leave for an hour already.”
A typical encounter.
Draco sighs and grabs the muffin from Harry, replacing it with his own- which actually is chocolate chip, because Draco isn’t oblivious and knows what food he was picking out this morning.
“Good.” Draco’s mother says. “It’s what they deserve for breaking the law.”
A while later they’re both naked and tangled with one another, satisfied and ready to sleep. But Harry is so happy he can’t help but kiss Draco one last time, lips pressing together softly.
The words are quiet and Harry responds in kind. “You know I have.”
Harry sucks in a breath.
Harry’s smile doesn’t falter. “
“What?”
“Yeah,” he breathes. He supposes there were the people in the Leaky Cauldron but suddenly it’s important to Harry that Malfoy knows how significant that first meeting was in
But now it’s not Draco that’s the problem, it’s Harry. And the way Harry thinks (knows) he feels about Draco.
When he finally gets up to bed he’s still feeling the effects of the alcohol, making his head feel heavy, but he also feels lighter than ever.
Draco flinches.
“Thank you,” he says to her. “That’s very kind of you to say.”
“I know.”
The walls are grey and Harry’s shoes scuff a bit on the dull crème carpet underneath them. The smell of mint hits him and he smells deeply, wondering where it could possibly be coming from.
Potter glares at him for a few seconds more before pulling out his things with a sigh. "Right, well. Yeah, that's the end of it."
Harry takes his final bite and pushes the remains away happily. “The House Elves outdid themselves this year.”
He still ignores him.
Draco moves forward quickly, and before Harry can even close his eyes, he feels a hand gently cover his cheek, feels a thumb stroke away a strand of his hair, and then Draco pulls him in and Harry feels his lips, soft and warm, hesitantly cover his own.
“Scorpius asleep too?”
“It might be.” Percy replies. “You don’t know what goes on behind closed doors. None of us do.”
Draco rolls his eyes. "Of course I was on the bloody train, how do you think I got here? I was in the same compartment as always, and guess who else was there? Oh, that's right. None of you lot."
“We didn’t exactly get that far.” Harry chimes in unhelpfully and Draco finally looks up at him to glare. “Come on. It’s fine, she didn’t see a thing. Can we go see Teddy now?”
“Why did you do that? When you lied to Bellatrix and your parents.” Harry looks down. “You never answered when I asked you.”
Harry is unable to stop his grin. “No. I just- I can’t believe you’re actually
Blaise shrugs, grinning wickedly. “In my defense they
Harry lets out a breath of relief. Not that he’d been scared Draco would ruin it, just that… well. It’s good to know Draco realizes the cloak is important to him. “Thank you.”
“Then tell them!” Harry yells. “Tell anybody, Draco, tell
Hope is a dreadfully hard thing to squash. Draco knows that better than anybody.
Harry had expected the idea to feel weird to him over the past couple of days. Draco had obviously been waiting for more of a reaction than Harry’s surprised “huh” before Harry had then began riling him up.
“Oh sweetheart.” She sounds sad. “You’re doing so so well. You don’t need your father or I telling you what to do or how to be, not when you’ve proven you do so much better on your own.”
Draco sees the lie. He wonders if Harry does too.
But he’d said he’d died to protect them all, back when he confronted Voldemort during their final duel. Hadn’t he? He’d said something about dying so none of the curses would hurt them.
“Thanks.”
Harry looks away, still sliding himself in and out of Draco. “Like I’m the only thing you want.”
A few minutes pass and they lie there in silence until Harry breaks it. “Breakfast?
“Oh, erm, right. Sorry.” Harry steps away to stand next to Draco and the painting closes the entrance to Gryffindor again, a knowing look on her face as she appraises them both.
He watches as Draco’s breath catches for a second. “I don’t think it could possibly be anything else when it comes to us, Harry.”
The room comes into focus in sharp relief and it is only then that Harry sees the emerald bedsheets and decorations of the Eighth Year Slytherin boys’ dorm.  The lack of light hadn’t been because it is early, he realizes belatedly, but because they are in the basement.
“But you’re the Seeker,” Holly replies in confusion, brown haired ponytail falling to one side as she cocks her head, like Harry’s a puzzle to solve. “You always have been.”
we were real."
“Got it.” Harry agrees distantly. “What were you panicking about?”
She glances at Draco who tenses and sucks in a breath but it’s only for a second. He quickly looks away and when he raises his eyes he sees Harry watching him.
“Right yeah.” Harry clears his throat. “I think it’s both.”
Neither of them pull their hands away. Instead Draco pulls them up to rest on top of their robes instead of hidden in them. Harry looks sideways at Draco’s face and finds the blonde staring at their hands with concentration, his thumb brushing Harry’s knuckles lightly over and over again in short sweeps.
He’s failing. Spectacularly.
Harry’s face sets in determination. “I think you’re wrong.”
it’s just past one and every one of them seem to have at least two bags worth of shopping.
They break apart for a breath.
“What prophecy?”
Then, when enough finally seems to be enough, Hermione corners him in the library.
A few seconds of silence go by.
“It’s fine, Potter.” Blaise says and he sticks out his hand. Draco takes it.
Hermione turns to her. “That’s very good, Luna.”
Harry sighs, runs a hand through his hair and Draco’s own fingers twitch again, this time wanting to flatten it.
“Bit tired, but not bad apart from that. You?”
“I know.” The frustration is clear in Draco’s tone. “But you also- you weren’t, you know? You were always just you. Different. Apart from us all. And I always thought maybe if I could talk to you, somehow, then I could just be me too. We wouldn’t have to talk about the rest, just about us. You could tell me I could be brave or that everything would end up okay and I’d believe you. I could insult you. Things like that.”
“I was trying to.”
The debate effectively ends there, with Ron muttering “I can’t believe you hate cats,” and Draco replying “I don’t hate cats, I just said owls are better-” before Hermione interrupts.
Then she turns away to glide over to the window Draco had always sat with her at. He follows immediately,
Because it’s easy to forget sometimes, what with them keeping it secret and it being so new. It’s not like it had been with Ginny when Harry had been able to unashamedly show everyone that yes, she was his girlfriend and they were together. Now Harry still had to try and ignore other students giving him smiles that made Ron nudge him in the side with a knowing grin, the ones that caused Draco to frown and look away. He still had to glare at people who shot Draco nasty looks and watch as hastily aimed spells hit the
He feels like he might be sick.
Draco watches with a feeling akin to betrayal as Luna and Blaise high-five.
“What did you do when he was there?”
Harry is horrified. “But- I would never…”
“Don’t you?” Blaise asks and Harry meets his eyes. “Come on Harry. You love him. You don’t think he loves you too?”
A few unsure chuckles sound around the table and Blaise grins, shaking his head.
Draco turns to stare at him incredulously. “Are you serious?”
Their kiss is soft and Harry can see Draco smiling as they pull away.
Harry’s breath catches.
Harry frowns, shifting underneath Draco to get more comfortable and making both of them hiss in a breath. He wants to laugh at the absurdity of the situation, at him asking that after kissing Harry senseless and making him feel as hard as a broom handle.
Since then he’s been taking things one step at a time. First getting through the summer and recovering from the war, then the school year. Then he got all these new friends and Draco, and it’s been easy for him to stay distracted and focus on the present.
She sniffs again, nodding and taking off her hat. “Of course it was.”
Harry hears what they're saying, he really does. But when he looks over at Malfoy he sees him hunched over a textbook- probably Muggle Studies, the bloke doesn't know a thing- and ignoring Pansy who is laughing with Blaise and cutting up Malfoy's food for him.
“No.” Harry whispers back. “It hasn’t hurt for a while now.”
Harry had been too stunned to do anything but nod and stammer. “I- yeah.” He’d cleared his throat. “Alright.”
“Obviously.”
“He made the wrong choices.” Draco says, feeling self-loathing for comparing Voldemort to himself. “And he never grew up enough to realize that. Because he’d never known anything else.” He swallows. “I know what that’s like.
Harry notes the process Malfoy goes through to ground himself. The way his shoulders roll backwards, how he blinks twice quickly and then once again a few seconds later. One more appraisal of Harry and his outfit and then there’s a hint of something soft at the corners of Draco’s mouth.
Ginny meets him at the bottom. “Off to Draco’s?”
“I did say that,” Draco interjects pointedly and Narcissa nods.
Draco nods, chalking Ron’s behaviour up to the alcohol and then looks across at his best friend who’s watching them with more attention than Draco would have thought Blaise capable of given his current state. “Ready to go home yet, Blaise?”
Draco frowns now. “But- you and Ginevra… all those months you were together?”
He shrugs, looking away. “It wouldn’t do any good.”
Draco smiles, kissing his lips one last time quickly before he moves to Harry’s jaw. From there it’s easy to leave a trail of soft pecks down his neck, along his collar and then down the center of his chest. He pauses after, eyes flicking up to see Harry looking down at him with a warm, happy expression, and he moves back up to kiss over the other man’s heart.
“We weren’t at it
Harry rolls his eyes at him and for a second they stand like that, beside their mixed group of friends, just the two of them smiling at each other over their cups like a couple of idiots.
Draco shows up to the pub far too early and only debates turning on his heel to leave for a second when he sees that Potter is the only other one there.
Her silence had been loud and when he glanced over she looked more like her usual self. All the worry and pain locked tightly away behind an air of false arrogance. “Look at us being miserable. Anyone who walked in on us would be depressed within seconds.”
He’s not sure if it’s the drink Ron’s had or just a build up of courage over the last few months, but Harry’s surprised at the fact that his best friend has brought this up. Especially after last time. Harry had thought he’d scared all of his friends off of the subject of Draco for life.
It’s ruined more than one first date. More than a couple of Ministry events and countless friends’ parties whenever they go out somewhere public. Harry can’t meet anybody new without a small part of him wondering whether they’re with him because of who he is or what he’s done.
“That’s the one, Harry!” Draco agrees, not even bothering to his laughter now. “Good man, how did you manage to remember it so well?”
“Very well.” McGonagall cuts in and turns to Harry and Draco. “Your bags are through already. Shall we get on?”
Harry had asked him about Myrtle a while ago and Draco had actually told him the truth. It had been easier, given that Harry knew almost all of the rest of what had been happening to Draco during Sixth Year.
She glides around the sinks a couple of times and he waits for her to stop. “So why are you visiting? Working on letting a bunch of killers into the castle again?”
Immediately Draco’s mind goes to the Quidditch World Cup. Spending that time with his Father had been brilliant. Watching the players, watching Krum. Draco had felt a thrill that entire game.
Harry nods and Draco hears him let out a breath. “Sort of like Hermione and I then.”
“Like Potter could handle me anyway.” Draco scoffs, breaking the tension and getting a few wary chuckles. “Okay, let’s move on. What time is it?”
But he is already getting up and moving forward to meet Draco in the middle of the circle, forgetting that so far it was only the spinner who had moved to get to their target. He isn’t worried about seeming eager or- or whatever it might look like he is. He walks to the middle of the circle, dropping to kneel in front of Draco who is staring at him with wide eyes.
“Draco.” Harry blinks, looking up from where he’s been fiddling with the label of a beer. “Hi.”
It’s been a week of different examinations and today, after finishing his Potions exam- hence why Draco is one of the first to be done- he finally feels ready to do what’s he’s been dreading. To do what he promised.
“Yes.” He bites out forcibly, already regretting his decision to confess.
, and Draco doesn’t know how he knows that except for the fact that he feels exactly the same way.
“Can you let us dry this up at least so we can talk to you for a while? Us being here will stop any other couples from coming in and bothering you,” he adds on when he thinks it.
“Please.” Draco begs and Harry’s eyes darken further as he leans forward again. They line themselves up and their eyes meet for a moment before slowly, torturously slowly, Harry pushes in.
He stares at her. “Were you always this smart? Or does death bring it out in you?”
-no. Those are years ago, old memories. Still, he can’t help it when he says, “but you made it… more enjoyable than anybody else could have.”
“Harry.” She leans forward. “That doesn’t make him a good person. You don’t owe him anything.”
Finally, after what seems far too long, they reach the living room. It has blue wallpaper with silver designs and two couches, a love seat and an armchair in front of the large fireplace. A coffee table sits by one of the couches.
“I can’t believe I waited so long to do that.” Harry says eventually, turning his head to meet Draco’s eyes. “Fucking idiot.”
Title from 'Is There Somewhere' by Halsey
“Hmm?” He blinks and the smell of smoke is gone, replaced with the sound of laughter and music. When he blinks again, he sees a small group of people in a room with couches and comfortable chairs placed in the center of the room. There are pillows on the floors and a table of drinks- is that punch?- over towards the far wall.
“Not at all, not at all.” Hagrid backs up, pulling Fang with him to clear the door. “Come in. Alright there, Draco?”
As Harry and Draco emerge from the Quidditch Pitch his eyes fall on the hut sitting innocently beside the Forbidden Forest and Harry smiles.
“Ready to go?” Hermione asks, cheeks faintly flushed, and Harry gives Ginny one more significant look as she nods.
“I did though.”
Eighth Year…
Harry shakes his head in frustration. “I don’t know. I just think about that, sometimes. How it’s always been this idea of a perfect couple that people always try and give to me. But I know that’s not true. It
Still, Draco can’t help but feel a bit of satisfaction, no matter how silly, at the fact that Potter’s wearing his things. Clothes that suit him really well if Draco’s being honest.
“It’s just… even if they hadn’t been great people, what else would everybody say to me? Nobody would be going around talking about how awful they were, would they? Or how Mum might have had an annoying laugh and Dad a habit of speaking with his mouth full of food.”
“I told you,” Draco looks away long enough to bend and pick up Harry’s shirt from the floor and pass it to him. Harry takes it in quiet gratitude. “We’re seeing each other.”
“I am sorry about the paintings,” Harry rolls over and speaks softly, blinking slowly. His glasses are on Draco’s bedside table and Draco can’t seem to get over how different he looks without them. “I got used to them a while ago, when we were fixing up Hogwarts.”
“Oh no thank you.” Draco replies, taking a delicate sip of tea. “And I’m just fine. Just a lot of memories coming up today.”
There’s not many there that night and the Room seems smaller than usual. Ron and Hermione are playing Ginny and Blaise in beer pong, and Neville and Luna are in deep discussion with Millie while Theo and Pansy are playing some kind of card game that Harry and Draco wander over to. Ernie and Padma are notably absent, as are Hannah and Parvati and Seamus and Dean.
He falls silent, unsure of what else to say until she turns to him a bit suddenly. “Would you like to come to a party, Harry?”
Draco looks up from the notes on the desk distractedly. “What?”
"They're adults, Ron, they can make their own decisions."
Molly swallows. “But
Harry rubs his face with his hand, frustration leaking out of every second of the gesture. “No, of course not. I came to see if you’re alright.”
Harry feels absolutely helpless. Actually he doesn’t quite know how or what he feels, but helpless is a good place to start.
Now Harry’s expression does change and becomes one of pure shock. “What?”
He grabs the blonde’s wrist and pulls him away from the mass of bodies, ignoring everything except the eager steps of Draco behind him and his own pounding heart beat and throbbing cock.
His hands shake as he opens the envelope.
The man grins back. “No worries, guy. Have a good rest of your night.”
Draco stops mid-reach for a slice of apple before pushing forward and grabbing a few anyway. “Well it’s easier for them. Having everything together in one place, I mean.”
“Well, I don’t want to drag this out.” She begins and Harry sees Draco shift nervously out of his peripheral. Draco isn’t the most comfortable in this office or around Professor McGonagall at the best of times, but now the other wizard looks nearly white from nerves.
"Fuck off."
“You make me crazy,” Draco gasps. “I think about your cock almost constantly. I dreamt about you being inside me the other night, did I tell you?”
Ron groans. “Oh no.”
“No actually.” Harry looks thoughtful. “Ginny probably. You?”
“That’s not what I mean-”
“I know you told me he was… like that,” Draco had whispered as they’d gone up to Harry’s room after eating breakfast. “But I didn’t really get it until now.”
He looks up when Hermione doesn’t answer and when he sees she’s trying to hold back laughter as well he throws up his hands in disgust.
“Why?”
He shrugs and shakes his head a bit. “So it was alright. How was your night?”
“Right, okay.” He taps his wand to his throat and when he speaks again it’s much louder. “Can you hear me alright?”
Blaise’s face goes serious in a moment before he makes his expression carefully neutral and hands over a drink. “No, I suppose not. Though being on the other side isn’t any more fun, I can promise you that.”
“Harry.” Draco is so serious Harry lets his smile slip away and responds in kind. The previous tension is gone to be replaced with this new unspoken uncertainty between them. “What are we doing?”
“No, Harry, tell me that you’re joking.” Ron stares at him. “Because you’ve acted weird since May, and at first it was alright, it was fine because that’s how everybody was acting. But now you’re breaking up with Ginny and making friends with Malfoy and you’re not
He looks back up to see Pansy watching them closely and rolls his eyes, ignoring the strange tightening in his stomach when his desk partner remains quiet beside him.
“Harry.” Draco’s eyes fall closed briefly as he finds the words. “It’s not. You take care of us all the time. Let us repay you for that.”
“Are we friends, Harry?” Draco whispers, and it’s the use of his first name in that tone of voice that makes Harry speechless. He wants to hear that again.
Hermione laughs. “I was just kidding but thanks all the same. As do you by the way. Deserve credit. These robes are like silk!”
like that.” Harry says. “That’s one of the last things I want to be thinking about. Erm. No offense, ‘Mione.”
What scares Harry?
He's great.
Draco looks confused. “Isn’t that what I’m supposed to be doing? Helping you?”
Harry wakes up warm and comfortable, cocooned in Draco’s arms. His head is lying on Draco’s bare shoulder, one arm and leg thrown over his pale skin.
Draco cringes as he steps into the water, and as they get to the lavatory the water level is high enough that it snakes into his shoes.
Lynne is grinning wickedly. Harry shoots her a pointed look but it doesn’t ease the way she seems like the cat who caught the canary.
Narcissa stands up sharply, sudden anger clear in her countenance. “Show me.”
“Nothing.” Hermione answered and something told Harry she’s decided this isn’t a battle worth fighting tonight. “Ginny and I are going now anyway. We can always head to the Room early, it’s better than just sitting in the Common Room without everybody there.”
Harry looks back towards the door of the classroom, hearing Marylton’s voice begin lecturing through it. “Aren’t you going in?”
What the fuck?
“I think it’s rather sweet.” Luna interrupts suddenly. “I’m glad you both made up.”
“I’ve never really thought about it, I suppose.”
Draco leans back, watching him intently. “What do you mean?”
“Draco sit down-” Blaise begins.
“Yes.” Draco confirms quietly.
Potter flushes, and it's distracting. "I guess, yeah. You're not different around me. You're just... you. Like always."
“I’m being silly.” She looks back outside for a moment before breathing in deeply again and looking at him while she says, “Blaise asked me out on a date.”
front page over breakfast the next morning it’s all ruined. Because there is a picture of Harry just outside of the club from last night with his arm around a girl as she practically hangs off of him. The picture shows them stepping out to the street as Harry hails a cab, and the headline reads,
His stomach is twisted from a mixture of fear and hope but he’s also coursing with relief. He’d told Harry the truth, finally, and he’s proud of that. Even if Harry can’t forgive him and decides he doesn’t want to be with Draco anymore he can go on knowing that he did everything he could to fix his mistake. Harry knows everything now. To borrow an expression of Hermione’s, Harry is the one who holds the cards.
Harry glances over at her, taking her in. Narcissa seems more at ease now as well, and there’s a look on her face as she watches Draco, Teddy and her sister that speaks of warmth, of fondness. As they look on, Andromeda excuses herself to use the toilet, leaving Draco alone with Teddy.
Something must have gone wrong with Draco, he thinks to himself faintly. He can’t imagine stopping now if he tried.
So what if Draco might, possibly, have a very high chance of still being in love with him? So what if Harry’s gaze had lingered when he’d first walked into Ron’s office? Those kind of things are easily pushed aside.
“Perfect. See you later, Harry.”

“I thought you saw him at Blaise’s stag do.”
She raises an eyebrow. “Anyway. We should go in, we’ll be late.” Once she sees he’s not moving to follow her she turns around. “Coming?”
for the first time.
“Thought I’d spare you all the torture. Dressing up is a big enough pain as it is.” Ron says, and Harry smiles wider as Malfoy blinks again, this time surprised at Ron’s light tone.
The expression she’s wearing is pasted on, a small, weak smile that doesn’t reach her eyes in any way.
The headmistress sighs, but she still looks fond. “I would remind you again Albus that I’m running the school now.”
Harry nods to the empty space beside him and Draco moves over to take it.
Draco has hopes that one day she’ll stop being so scared of allowing herself to be happy and just take a chance. But that day is not today.
Absently he wonders what Draco’s thinking, wherever he may be. He might not even be awake yet, but if he is, Harry wants to know what’s running through his head. Is he as happy? Or will he be second guessing everything? Harry remembers the hesitation that had been there last night and frowns, his good mood slightly muted at the realization that, knowing Draco, he’s probably overthinking it all.
He looks back down and eats the piece of ham on his fork.
Draco splutters, “Excuse me?”
His eyes fall closed. “What does it matter now?”
“It shocked us all when we found out. I was beside myself with anger and I can only imagine what Lucius was like. His letter was quite civil after I told him, but I know my husband.” She stops abruptly as if realizing who exactly she’s speaking to. Mutual embarrassment falls over them both. “Well. I suppose I don’t need to tell you.”
“Uh, okay.” He swallows more tea than he’d meant to, burning his tongue. His eyes water and he resists the urge to cough.
“Why not?”
Draco whips up some sandwiches, checks Blaise’s robes, checks he definitely has the rings, and then gives Ron a satisfied once-over before they are
But Ron nods, because it’s Ron and he knows Harry better than almost anybody, and he understands. “Alright. I just wanted you to know. In case of… just going forward.”
Blaise pouts. "You're no fun."
But had he really? He’d gone into this entire thing skeptical and unwilling while being unable to say no. And he’d kept on ignoring Harry until they’d suddenly been doing the complete opposite and, it seems to Draco at least, spending every spare moment together. As much as possible if he is being honest.
“Funny people Muggles, aren’t they?” Arthur asks conversationally as he leads them around the house to the tent. “Ingenious the things they come up with to make up for the lack of magic.”
Harry may have sucked Draco off and given him hand jobs (and gotten both back in return) but he’s never been on an actual date with him yet.
Jesus, Draco is hard. Harry can feel the other man’s cock twitching and swelling in his hand and he squeezes slightly, enough to make Draco let out the rawest groan Harry has ever heard from him.
Slytherins aren’t any better for trying to suddenly be his friend. He knows it’s probably only for their own gain or to repair their reputations and he isn’t going to just forget everything they’ve done to him and his friends over the years because of a few nice words
“Don’t care,” he calls back. “Ask the other Gryffindor boys if you’re so interested.”
“He’s dangerous for you, Draco.” She’d said while squeezing his hand gently. “You forget to think when Harry Potter is involved.”
It’s impossible to look at Draco and forget everything between them. Years of knowing someone doesn’t just vanish when you don’t see them everyday anymore. Harry looks at Draco and he remembers more than their breakup, he remembers months of friendship, of knowing each other intimately, and the want, the need, that led to them dating in the first place.
"No. And yes, of course you're miserable, what other type of person drinks before 5 o'clock?" Blaise hesitates for a second. "He is too, you know."
“Yeah.” Draco brings his arm up to look at his tattooed wrist. “Even though he failed, I guess he at least tried.”
“Come on, up you get,” Theo coaxes her easily out of the chair and she turns to quickly smack a wet kiss on Draco’s temple. He tries not to think about what just came out of her mouth seconds before. “Blaise come on, we’re ready.”
Slowly Harry tells him. “Dumbledore heard Professor Trelawney give it and then the copy ended up in the Department of Mysteries. Er, that was the one your dad was trying to get from us all in Fifth Year.”
Andromeda sees Harry’s look. “These are Black family heirlooms. They’ve been in the family for Merlin knows how long.” Her eyes catch on one of the dragons. “Long enough that Portuguese Long-Snout was still in existence. They’ve been passed down through the children. The three of us used to play with them… we each had a favourite…”
"I'm not." He says petulantly, picking at his plate and looking down. "And anyway, it's not like I want to be friends with him. I want to use him. Anything to make the Malfoy name seem slightly better in the eyes of everybody else is worth it. I'll need connections to get a job in the future, have you all thought about that? What better than Harry Potter's stamp of approval? If the public think we're amicable it will do wonders for me."
"Oh. Right." Harry wracks his brain. "Truth or dare?"
He hollows his cheeks pointedly and Harry swears he nearly blacks out.
She’d helped him stagger from the lounge to his bedroom and carefully taken off his robes and left them folded for the House Elves to collect. Pansy had straightened the covers over him in bed and waved her wand to extinguish all the fires except the one smoldering away in his fireplace before getting ready for bed herself and sliding in beside him.
It’s the tone of voice more than anything that makes Harry do it. He quickly pulls on his clothes and moves to the door, keeping a careful distance between them. He stops before opening it though, his hand resting on the handle.
“Already?” Millie asks in surprise while Theo takes in all of Harry’s shopping with a slight smirk. Harry notes that Theo only has one bag, likely for his Secret Santa, and scowls at the other wizard who smiles back.
“I know what you’re going to say.” Harry breaks the silence eventually, having grown uncomfortable with Blaise’s silence and casual air.
Draco cringes internally, wondering how he could have been so stupid. It is obvious from Harry’s tone and face that the memory is uncomfortable but Draco had pushed anyway. Because, well, he’d never thought Voldemort and the others would go after Harry’s
“Crookshanks wins everybody round eventually.”
But he had heard the rumors. Snape had been a double agent. He’d loved Lily Potter.
“Right then, I’m just gonna go.” He says, and then he turns and walks out when they both give brief waves, heading towards the library.
Draco doesn’t say anything about his own first serious crush. He thinks he’s had enough embarrassment for a while, and Harry certainly didn’t need to hear that to stoke his ego.
And like that they’re off. Draco and Harry shoot to one side of the pitch to hover, having decided on this earlier.
“You’ve only been together what? Two months?” Ron says. “We were trying to be polite!”
In fact, he’s almost reached his breaking point and decided to just throw it all to hell and talk to Draco and to fix things when Blaise interferes.
“You won’t win those either,” Draco warns him but he does let the Snitch go. “Alright everyone, get into positions.”
Harry shrugs. “Doesn’t matter.”
Harry kissed him- enthusiastically, one may say. He grabbed Draco’s arse. Maybe it was to make the others stop laughing at him about being a prude like he’d said, it was possible. But maybe not.
Neville shakes his head. “We were waiting for you.”
“Who taught you to do that?” He pants and Draco licks his lips.
“I do accept your apology.” Harry says quietly to her as they both stand watching Draco with Teddy. “I won’t pretend to understand how you could do what you did, but if you’re really working to change, like Draco says, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt and try to get over our past differences. For him.”
Even on days like today when they’re doing nothing more than spending time together in Harry’s office. He’s reviewing case notes. Harry doesn’t seem to be doing anything but sneakily watch him out of the corner of his eye.
“Just-”
When they eventually get to the graveyard it’s quiet, and Draco is thankful for that.
There’s an awkward silence between him and the bloke he’s been dancing with and Draco hates it. Suddenly he’s angry and tired with everything, so he figures he’ll put them both out of their misery when he smiles forcibly at the man in front of him.
Hermione is watching him carefully. Ron splutters.
“And the thing is I don’t really know how to feel either. Or what I think.” Harry frowns. “I’m a bit… numb.”
“Why?” Draco can’t hold the question back any longer.
Kingsley glances at Draco again, and Harry watches a myriad of emotions pass over the Minister's features. Finally, he sighs and looks back to Harry.
He cuts off abruptly and sees Narcissa lean back a bit, noticing Draco closing his eyes slowly as if wishing to be anywhere but there.
Draco scoffs. “I doubt that was hard. You jump at any chance to be with Teddy you can get.”
Harry looks at her like she’s crazy. Draco sighs.
“You have a letter.”
And then he’s back to attacking Harry with his mouth and Harry is lifting a leg, trying to get any friction he can, but it’s not enough so he hurriedly undoes Draco’s belt and shoves his hand inside his pants to feel again what he hasn’t felt in years.
Harry shifted again. “I mean it’s not like we’d have any reason to visit the basement, is there?”
"You don't mind, do you Potter?" He asks, not even looking at him. Obviously he doesn't care either way. "It's just you grew up with Muggles, see. At least in this class sitting with you might actually benefit me."
“I’m sure I’ll like it.”
“And neither of us joined it,” Hermione assures them both.
Now Draco’s remembering it too. Harry sees it.
“Not sure. She said they were all from her parents’ old photo albums? Those two people there,” Draco points at a picture of two people Harry vaguely recognizes. “They’re your grandparents.”
Harry feels Draco silently shaking beside him and spares the blonde a glare. “It’s true. We didn’t.”
Harry's never known the feeling.
Well when it’s put like that… Harry’s nerves settle.
He glances over to see Potter staring at the parchment in front of him.
He bites his tongue, wondering if that sounds like bragging to her. Wondering if she will be insulted, as if he is making a point of how well the Weasley’s are when she’s usually alone in her house and her husband is locked in Azkaban.
"An- an experiment?" Harry asks.
The fact that they’ve spent a considerable amount of time in the furthest, dustiest shelves of the library snogging can be explained easily away. They needed to erase any and all distractions before studying after all, and they can’t very well focus while being desperate to kiss the other can they?
“Good morning.” Harry says and he tries to keep some of his excitement at bay because- why is he even excited? Apart from the fact that it’s Christmas and-
But she does stop by Harry.
Prophet
That doesn’t sound right; in fact, it sounds like the complete opposite of the friends Harry knows. “Ron is the one planning?”
Draco’s curiosity rears its head again, but he knows what that tone of voice means and thinks better of it. “So how long did it take you?” He asks, changing the subject.
Hours later they end up back on the dancefloor and this time they dance against one another from the start. Draco’s touching Harry’s hands, sliding his own up Harry’s arms to his shoulders and holding him tight.
“Nothing.” Draco replies. “He just wanted to do something for her.”
Which is in the back, as far from everyone else as he can get, which tells Harry that Malfoy doesn't seem like he wants to talk.
“I know.” He replies, frustrated. “But the thing is-” Should he do it? Say it? “-I like him, Molly. More than I ever thought I could. He’s changed, I promise. I couldn’t stand him before but now- now he’s one of my best friends. And I think he’s made up for what he’s done, at least to me.”
“I told you all, I’m not going.” Draco says and Pansy smiles and pats his hand.
"I just wasn't expecting him to look so..."
“Yes!” Pansy exclaims, seeming completely genuine. “What could be more interesting than talking about all of our sex experience? Best times, worst times…”
Both of them shut up.
Harry grits his teeth. "Draco Malfoy," he grinds out, "disarmed Dumbledore. He didn't know I was there. He talked to Dumbledore, and Dumbledore said he'd known what Draco had been trying to do all year. Draco had made some attempts to kill him you see, under Voldemort's orders and threats to his family, and Dumbledore had known about it. He said Draco wasn't a killer and that he didn't want Draco to, erm, damage his soul like that."
“Oh.” Harry exchanges a look with Draco. They hadn’t really planned on what to say for a goodbye.
Draco feels like he’s floating.
Harry is still wheezing. “I- where’s this coming from?”
Then she begins. "I was a captive in Malfoy Manor's dungeon for a little while during the war."
“Oh, lucky you. What was it then?”
“Why?” Draco challenges gently. “I’m a Pureblood, Harry. Traditional. I can’t be going around and getting people pregnant, ruining my family name and begetting illegitimate heirs to Malfoy family. Or the Black family, come to think of it.”
"Don't be thick, Draco." Blaise snaps. It seems to be the only way Blaise is with him these days- angry or exasperated. Sometimes both. "It should be you with him in this picture and we both know that."
to be. Draco can give him one look with those piercing grey eyes and Harry goes weak.
And that means it really is time for Draco to leave because now he’s letting his mind run away with him. “Idiot.” He says, but his voice is so affectionate the words fall on deaf ears.
"What happened to make you so hateful, Potter?" The blonde spits at him, and Draco's eyes are too knowing for Harry's liking. "Don't tell me I broke your heart so hard it never recovered, causing you to become spiteful ever since? Let's do try to not be so predictably cliché."
Draco looks up from his lips to meet his eyes.
Somehow, despite their history and everything that has happened, everything that being friends with Draco would entail, Harry thinks they could be.
“Sorry, I was supposed to not laugh,” Harry cuts himself off and Draco remembers his stipulation. He’s glad Harry broke it. He likes his laugh. “God, you’ve made me feel better about this whole thing already.”
Their eyes hold and surprisingly it’s her who looks away first, letting out a deep breath. “I wish I could blame you.”
His plan to rise above it all is ruined by Pansy who is standing with Millie, Luna and the Gryffindors. She spots them first and as soon as the three of them have joined the circle she announces, “We were wrong, they weren’t fucking. The boys told us.”
Harry is bored stiff.
“I will.” Draco says firmly. “If you’re really okay with it, I would come.”
“What?” Draco asks eventually after Harry doesn’t say anything.
“Well,” Draco rallies valiantly. “Hopefully this can put a stop to all that.”
But they are dancing along the top of the dam now with them both holding the controls of the floodgates, and it is the knowledge that soon they will open them and be overtaken that makes this kiss so different.
“I didn’t think you were having sex,” Luna offers out of nowhere.
Harry stops mid shuffle towards the door. “Pardon?”
"You're lying."
Harry feels a great swell of discomfort and resolutely does not think of Dobby, or Sirius and Lupin, or his parents.
He pulls away when he needs to breathe, feeling warm and alive, eyes searching the wizard in front of him desperately. There are words that want to fall from his mouth but his tongue won’t move, his mind can’t work to put the letters in their right order and he can only stare. Stare and touch, holding on with a grip that is both nervous and certain, tight like a vice with no intention of ever letting go.
“Pansy!” Theo turns from his conversation with Harry immediately to shuffle around the table to her. “Come on, let’s go home.”
“You don’t know that.”
He flushes the toilet so Ron doesn’t think he spent ages doing his hair or something and then takes one last look in the mirror before grabbing his jacket and going down to meet his friends at the door of 12 Grimmauld Place.
The night’s been absolute shite.
Draco pouts. “Pansy invites me to them.”
Draco stares at him, stunned.
“Huh? Oh, yeah.” Harry sighs tiredly and Draco wonders if he regrets bringing it up. “It was just whoever Voldemort picked really.”
What in Merlin’s name is happening to his life?
Things don’t change too much once Blaise knows. There’s looks here and there, nudges and raised eyebrows, but Draco has been ignoring those all his life, especially from his friends. He’s not about to let them get to him now.
Draco’s glare disappears and his face goes close to blank, if it weren’t for the way he suddenly can’t meet Harry’s eyes. “Don’t be daft.”
He doesn’t sound disappointed or angry, but he isn’t exactly excited either as he turns to look at Harry with a raised eyebrow. “Is this a hint, Potter?”
"No," he interrupts him because Draco really doesn't feel like fighting at the moment. He'd gotten a letter from his mother last night, letting him know how Father was doing, and it hasn't put him in the greatest of moods this morning. Hearing that Potter and Ginevra have split has brightened his morning considerably; more than it should have if he’s being honest. Which he isn't. "I'm just... wondering."
“Brilliant,” Harry grins. “That’s absolutely brilliant.”
“Maybe sooner that you think,” Draco finally murmurs in response to his question and Harry hides his quick grin by turning around, happy to hear Draco’s feet moving across the carpet after him.
“Oh honestly Ron,” Hermione breaks in. “Shut up about that now and tell your sister you’re happy for her and Blaise.”
“Cool,” Teddy says, totally unbothered, and Draco snorts into his cup of punch, making the corners of Harry’s mouth twitch. Their eyes meet, sharing the joke, before Harry is distracted by Andromeda giving Teddy Draco’s gift.
Though the two of them have begun studying more in the library that week then none of the others have commented on it. Draco really does need the notes from those Muggle Studies classes after all.
“We’re talking.” Harry interrupts him, dragging Draco behind him, passing a group of baffled Fourth Years. “Now.”
“Thanks. Erm, but why?”
“We’ve all been friends for months,” Theo says easily. “A couple of us pairing up was bound to happen, no matter what House we’re part of. Though I will admit that I didn’t expect it to be you two…”
An indiscernible expression comes over Harry. “You two were close, right? Like Hagrid and I.”
“Erm, no.” Harry admits. “He wouldn’t tell me.”
She gives him a wave and then wanders off towards the stairs. Harry shakes his head, unable to stop a grin from forming as she leaves.
Whatever it is, Draco knows they’re sworn to secrecy if they don’t find anything that could be considered a threat. Though he loathes the thought of this Auror who obviously despises him and his family reading his very private and personal mail, it’s nothing new, and even if he doesn’t like it, he knows he and Harry will be safe from Keller opening his big mouth.
"Draco." Blaise moves closer to him and his voice is softer. Merlin, how does he
She lets him widen the space between them. “If you and Harry can’t make up then I’m letting you know it won’t affect the rest of us. We’re all still going to be friends.”
“Right. Right.” Harry rakes his hands through his hair. “So when you say you want to tell people about us, what you mean is you want to tell a grand total of three of our friends.”
Funnily enough somehow Harry hadn’t realized that this game meant he was going to have to watch Draco get kissed and snogged and groped by other people. This fact had completely escaped his attention, and only now that he is about to watch Blaise kiss Draco does Harry realize that is something he definitely does not want to see.
He bites his lip for a second before continuing, taking care to straighten his posture now. "Anyway. So that was my bedroom and I wasn't allowed outside much. My cousin and his friends would bully me whenever they could and the only clothes I got were his hand me downs; ones that, as you reminded me so often, weren't very stylish or comfortable, and never ever fit me." He glances at Draco out of the corner of his eye before quickly looking away, feeling him shift uncomfortably at the words. "I got whatever food they didn't eat at meals I often had to cook, and if I burnt any of it you can bet that was my portion." He laughs bitterly. "For punishment sometimes they wouldn't feed me for days and I'd have to sneak out and steal things from the cupboards."
“That was nice of her. Defending Severus.” Draco feels a bit awkward, not sure what to say. He feels like this is all very important, this information, but to be honest he’s not very surprised. He also thinks he would have hated James Potter in school. He sounded like everything Draco had always thought Harry to be.
“I have no idea.”
The entire year it has felt like they’ve been building towards something- a tipping point or some kind of crossroads- and Harry hasn’t realized until right before they make it that a choice is coming.
For a moment the idea that this is a mistake fills him but he pushes it away quickly. He isn’t going to let that be true this time.
A surge of exasperated affection fills Draco but he tries to hide it. “Come on Potter. The House Elves might have some hot chocolate for you if you ask nicely.”
Harry returns the look, understanding flowing between them. “I thought the whole point of this is that our days of avoiding each other are over?”
Harry frowns. “I just said, because you’re the best-”
“She did. Cheeky bint.”
Draco seems almost betrayed. “You and I agreed-”
“Yes,” Draco sighs and he pushes up against Harry, too strung out to wait another second. “I want you now. Please.”
"Draco!" Ginny's tone is enough to pull him up short and glance back at her, standing with her hands on her hips in the open doorway. "It's past midnight, what the hell do you think you're doing here?"
home, he knows. The wind is picking up a bit and there’s a chill in the air. A blanket of grey clouds hide the sun in the sky and he casts a
Draco thanks him and Ron leaves shortly after. The blonde looks at all of his returned things, mostly notes, and wonders whether he’ll ever see Harry Potter again.
,” Harry says in offense, surprise momentarily replacing his hurt. “And I am too subtle!"
And it’s not like- well, it’s not as if Harry just expects Draco to just throw everything to the wind and confess to their friends right then and there. But he had hoped for something more than
“You don’t need to remind me.”
That was not ideal. He has no business being upset because Draco doesn’t invite him to parties- Harry had barely worked up the courage to invite Draco himself.
“Sorry,” he gasps even as his muscles still spasm and his breathing remains harsh as he tries to suck enough oxygen into his lungs. He looks over to see Harry already staring at him. “Sorry.”
When they finally make it up to the Great Hall Draco has decided to completely ignore their teasing. They don’t shut up the entire time it takes to walk up to the huge mass of students creeping from the Great Hall out onto the bridge past the doors. Not only does it seem like Blaise and Theo are doing their best to annoy Draco into admitting he’d had sex with Harry- which he
“Pettigrew?”
For some reason anger had risen in Harry. “But- but you were cleared. Of all of it.”
He nods. “I’m sorry, Pans. It probably doesn’t help but it was hardest to lie to you. I swear.”
He feels a bit bad at that, not having meant to pick at an old wound, but he doesn’t take back the question. Instead he waits longer, raising an eyebrow as Draco swallows.
They never stop kissing as they go and have to pause on their way three separate times as they get too caught up in having one another’s lips on theirs. Draco has to stop himself from just tugging Harry down right there in the hallway and letting them have one another.
Hey, Draco never said he wasn’t petty. Or selfish.
A few seconds go by until finally Padma raises her cup to drink, causing several looks of surprise and making Hermione gasp.
“We can do exes,” Pansy says, eyes settling on Harry and making a bolt of nervousness go through him. “Like Ginny and Harry here. Everyone who thinks they did the nasty before their conscious uncoupling, take a drink!”
It’s fine. This is just- it’s something he supposes he’ll have to get used to now that he and Harry are what they are.
“Harry?” Ron sounds confused and a bit worried. “Mate, what’s happened?”
She’s staring at him with wide eyes before a look of anger and hurt fills her face. “When it’s affecting whether or not you feel comfortable seeing everybody it
They are sort of friends now, Harry thinks. And it might be nice to spend some more time with him outside of class or the library. Studying together has been… surprisingly fun. They’ve done it a few times now and not only is Harry’s Potions mark better than he could have hoped, he also finds himself actually able to listen to Draco talk about the subject without falling asleep.
“What are you doing here?” Draco asks him.
Harry glares at Malfoy to find the prick smirking right back at him.
“You really aren’t.”
“It’s not your fault.” Harry says. “Besides, maybe this is better. Instead of letting it stay the elephant in the room we can deal with it now that things are out in the open.”
Draco's face drains of what little colour it has and his eyes widen at Harry slightly. He doesn't look away, their eyes are locked, even when everybody else in the room turns to look at Draco as well.
Dragons. Different types of dragons.
Draco looks up to smile at his friends as they move to sit beside him at lunch. It falters a bit at their worried looks. "Why, whatever do you mean?"
Harry is still staring at him but he manages a nod.
“It means you love me no matter what.” His son says smugly.
"Right." Harry says before pausing. "Are- are you okay?"
“You know, Harry, your parents would be incredibly proud of you.”
“What,” Blaise announces, “the fuck?”
“Yes.” Draco’s voice catches. “As long as you’re with me.”
“What am I saying, obviously I’m glad you didn’t hate me the same way you did the Dark- Voldemort.” He takes in a deep breath. Harry watches his chest rise under his robes. “It’s just that I had very few things I felt I was the best at once we got to school. After growing up in a home where I was practically a child prodigy in every area it was a bit of a jarring readjustment getting to Hogwarts.”
“Narcissa.” The Headmistress looks Draco’s mother up and down unimpressed. “To what do I owe this demand at this time?”
Still, he doesn’t get the chance to tease him about it as they leave breakfast with Ron and Blaise. Blaise had come back from Hogsmeade looking particularly pleased, and though neither he or Ginny have said anything to any of them, Draco is willing to bet his family’s last Galleon that something happened between them, even if they still aren’t officially together.
Eventually Draco speaks, trying to bring Harry out of his thoughts. “’The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death,’” he reads off the marker. “What does that mean?”
Harry falls back into the mattress, smiling lazily and Draco moves again, exploring more skin, mapping out what he can. He wants to touch, kiss, lick and taste everything and Harry doesn’t seem to be objecting. Soon his glasses are coming off and it makes Draco sit back and work to memorize the way it makes Harry look. He seems softer somehow. Still just as attractive, but new and unfamiliar, and the little bit of surprise intrigues Draco, because in the past few months he’d began to think there wasn’t much the two of them didn’t know about one another.
spot. He’d been planning on walking for a bit but now he can’t see the point.
“Merlin and Morgana,” Draco breathes. “That’s what you were doing on the run then. Getting them all.”
up the stairs, thank you- and only then does his mouth twitch as he shakes his head.
“But I know why you did.” Harry leant forward, trying to show how earnest he had felt. “I’m sorry that I didn’t explain. Or even try. You’re right, I haven’t been talking to either of you like I used to this year.” He contemplated his next words before deciding to say them anyway. “You’re just both so happy, and I feel like a big part of our lives have been centered around me and my problems.” He shrugged wryly. “I figured you would both just want some time for the two of you. My issues- or nonissues- with Malfoy weren’t important.”
“I don’t think Harry would let you go to Azkaban.”
Challenge flares in Harry’s belly along with want, and he surges forward, catching Draco’s face between his hands, pressing their mouths together and shoving his tongue into the other boy’s mouth, searching and searching for something Harry didn’t know he wanted. Draco lets out a deep sound and his arms move up to Harry’s shoulders, resting there, gripping them for balance. Harry pulls Draco in closer, grinning at the startled sound it produces, and now instead of silence there are only cheers and laughter from the group around them.
More than that, he's a friend.
“Okay.” Harry whispers and then ducks away to make himself comfortable. He spends a childish amount of time fussing with the blankets and shifting on the mattress and Draco could happily stand there dumbly and watch for hours but he needs to use the loo and brush his teeth, so acting like a responsible adult wins out this time.
"Oh, there's Luna and Neville!" Hermione exclaims as they disembark off the train. Harry’s holding Ginny’s hand as they follow the other couple. "If we hurry we can catch the same carriage as them."
Which isn’t necessarily a bad thing he supposes.
“Well no, maybe not that bit. But the rest of it… that makes everything easier, doesn’t it? Having your parents support you?”
Draco laughed. "Of course." Suddenly he's smiling, a huge bright smile that he means with everything he has, and he gets up and moves towards his friend, hugging him fiercely before pulling away. "I'm very happy for you, Blaise, really. Both of you."
“Ron’s actually,” he answers, and Draco jumps up immediately, bringing them chest to chest.
“I’ve sent some letters to some Potion Masters, asking if they might take me on.” Draco had shrugged, almost bashful, but Harry had seen the uncertainty in him.
“Nobody else?” Draco asks. “Going once, going twice…”
“Gryffindorish?” Harry asks him, pushing down his excitement at Draco agreeing to skip the class with him. “That’s definitely not a word.”
"That was years ago."
, he wants to say.
The professor frowns. “Excuse me?”
"That didn't convince me," Harry says, and he realizes it's true because there's always been that little bit of hope deep down in him to deny Draco's words. "Try again."
Horror sweeps across Harry’s face. “How did you hide it from him? He knew
A flutter of anticipation runs through him. He leaves his winter clothing to dry and hurriedly goes back down to meet Draco for dinner, nodding at the few students he passes on the way.
“I know what he thinks of me.” She says forlornly, settling in to face Draco. “He used to visit all the time, asking me things, needing my help. But as soon as he stopped needing information from me he stopped coming.”
Harry looks skeptical. “Erm, isn’t it just like everyone else’s?”
“I suggested change.” Draco replies woodenly, cut by Harry’s words. “We can’t just rush into this, but telling people slowly, one at a time-”
“Why in hell would you want to crash work parties? Don’t people realize you’re not employees?”
“Well, what do you think?” Draco says waspishly. “It’s embarrassing, isn’t it, standing in front of you and having you teach me. After everything I’ve told you about my need to be better than everybody, you really don’t see how this might be hard for me?”
(Which it does. He’s not a fan of blueberry and will always choose chocolate, but he can pick out the difference between the two by now. He’s started choosing wrong on purpose, just to see if there’s ever going to come a day when Draco says no and doesn’t switch with him.
Harry frowns, opening his mouth.
“Great, he’s made it.” She throws the parchment back in the fire. Harry watches as it curls in the flames, its edges turning bright orange as they spark. “Right, that’s us then. Lovely to see you again, Minerva, nice to meet you Mr. Potter.” She smiles brightly at them both before looking at the other Auror. “Keller… don’t work too hard.”
“Thanks.” Harry says quietly, still looking up at the carved faces.
Whatever she wants he hopes it has nothing to do with him. Romilda had a mean streak before the war. She’d been a bit of a bully to some of the other girls, and Draco thinks he remembers something about her charming someone with a love potion. And she’d used to have a huge crush on Harry.
If by some chance the murderer was interrupted before they could deliver the killing blow, each of the recovered surviving victims have checked into St. Mungo’s within a day because of impulsive and uncontrollable magic. One had accidently performed a minor
“I love
Harry grins at the mental picture. Lily has the amazing habit of being able to sleep anywhere, something neither he nor Draco shared.
Ron crosses his arms, and his hip juts out slightly, making Harry unable to repress his laughter. The hat is slightly crooked and Ron is wobbling in the pink high heels he’s wearing. It’s impossible not to laugh.
Draco is chatting with Pansy when Ron comes back with Harry at his side. He honestly hasn’t noticed until Pansy abruptly stops talking, and then he turns to see Harry at the same moment Harry catches sight of him.
Harry shrugs. “Yeah.”
He expects a laugh, or at least a snort because he knows he mucked the saying up and Potter usually doesn’t hesitate to laugh at his expense. But he’s quiet and after a second Draco finally lets himself look over to find Potter staring at him.
Harry looks down, inspecting his costume again. He tries to tell whether he looks alright or just ridiculous, hoping it’s the former. He doesn’t want to give Malfoy an easy dig to tease him - or any of the Slytherins for that matter.
“I’ll see you at the wedding.” Harry says abruptly and then before Draco can reply he’s turned and moving away as suddenly as he’d appeared.
“My goodness,” Andromeda speaks finally. Harry eyes the Peruvian Vipertooth that is crawling close to his shoes. “I haven’t seen these in an age.”
“Yeah, yeah.” Harry keeps his tone firm until his son makes it out of sight- by
“Alright.” He is looking at the clothes again. “Thanks. I like them.”
“No I- why are you looking at me like that? I feel like it’s a perfectly reasonable question given the situation.”
Draco licks his lips nervously. “It’s not you, not really. It’s everything else. The rest of it. And watching you with Vane earlier, it made me realize how much I care about you, that it would crush me if I lost you because you don’t feel the same. Or because eventually you get sick of us and the way things are… Which I know you will, if you aren’t already, because I am. Right now. It’s too hard.”
This is it. It’s done.
Harry stumbles through Ron and Hermione's fireplace.
Because yes, he and Draco had both said things that, if it had been anybody else, neither would have forgiven. But it isn’t anybody else. It’s them.
“Yes.” Draco is grinning so wide it must be stretching his muscles and Harry tries to smile back, tries to be excited too even at the thought of Draco working further away. “I’ve been offered the position of Potions Professor at Hogwarts. Again.” He tacks on as he remembers.
Harry pauses a bit. Oh, so that’s where Draco’s presents are. Of course. That means Harry won’t have any upstairs either.
“I won’t say I’m not disappointed, but neither am I surprised. You’ve always had a promising future ahead of you Mister Malfoy.”
"You both couldn't go a day without noticing each other." Ginny says softly. "I used to be jealous of that."
Her smile is pitying. “I’ve watched you obsess over Harry for all of Hogwarts. I know what it looks like. Don’t try and deny it,” she holds up a hand to cut him off when he opens his mouth. “I know you, just as well as you know me. I won’t stop trying to find out what you’re both hiding, and you won’t stop being stubborn until you nearly die from it. So I’m trying to warn you before that happens. Deal with it. One way or another. Leave and get away from him or try and talk to him and figure everything out, because this can’t go on, Draco, it just can’t. What happens at the next wedding? When the babies are born? You’re going to miss out on half of our lives if you keep avoiding him like this, and so will he. It’s been over two years and it’s not working. You need to make a decision instead of living in this state of in-between, because you’re not just hurting yourself, you’re hurting everyone.”
“Mmm. Apparently you and some of the Slytherins-”
Blaise gives nothing away and Harry suddenly realizes that Draco has probably already told him that.
The start out a few feet apart but when people see they’re dancing it’s like they’ve broken a barrier and more witches and wizards join the small group. Soon Harry is right next to Draco and they’re moving together instead of just in close proximity- which is good because Draco’s moves when dancing alone really are terrible- and Harry feels them brushing against each other constantly.
“Mr. Potter you may Vanish those letters if you please.”
“Remembering the soldiers who fought in the World Wars?” Harry asks him slowly while they’re studying together in the library, waiting for some nonexistent lightbulb to come on in Draco’s head. When it remains dim, he lets out a breath. Draco is staring at him blankly, obviously not having a clue what he’s talking about. “The World Wars, Draco? The bloodiest wars in history?”
“No but thank you.” His smile is still firm. He hopes it doesn’t look forced. “I think I’ll go back up to Draco, if that’s alright?”
“It is pretty amazing.” Hermione agrees softly, taking a sip of her drink. “I can’t picture any of us doing that back then.”
“Just like that. Wait.” Harry stretches across his back, pressing Draco down into the mattress momentarily before yanking the pillow out from under Draco’s head sharply and making him fall face-first into his own crossed arms.
“Mum’s getting on to us about being friends with Slytherins,” Ginny explains. “Ron’s mad I told her in the first place.”
"-but Draco, he's not going to be your friend." Pansy says quietly. "Ever. Potter and you? He's loathed you since First Year, since your first meeting. Everybody knows that. Don't get your hopes up that he'll grow to accept you."
Which all culminates into him thinking he might actually be falling in love with his best friend.
Everything feels so tentative and unsure right now. Things are changing, all of them are finally leaving Hogwarts to go and start their own lives away from each other.
By then Harry has outstayed the time he is allowed for a break, also typical, and gone up to make them both cups of tea. When he comes back Draco is muttering to himself unhappily, holding his wand over some of his notes with a frown.
It opens to reveal Draco and Harry stops mid motion, hand clenching around the object in his hand.
“You would.” Harry says firmly and everyone looks at him in surprise, maybe at the vehemence of his tone. “You would. Or you wouldn’t have had the chance because we’d all have been dead. None of us would have stopped fighting, ever. Death is all that could have waited for us. But all of you,” he looks around, “you might have made choices you- all of us- regret, but in the end you made the right one. And we know that can’t be easy. Us sitting here with you is just as surreal to me. But the way I see it, I’m tired of fighting. I don’t want to do it anymore, especially not with any of you. In the past we hated each other. Fine. But it doesn’t have to be like that now. Both sides have to be willing to forgive each other, not just one or the other, because that’s not how we get peace.”
