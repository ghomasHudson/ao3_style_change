Draco scowled at his textbook. He had spent the last ten minutes reading the same paragraph over and over and still couldn’t repeat the information if his life depended on it. Potter was dramatically late for their nightly library study sessions and it was disconcerting.
Quickly grabbing the Invisibility Cloak and the Marauders Map, Harry rushed out of Gryffindor Tower, pausing outside the entrance to tug on the Cloak and check the Map. Satisfied with his findings, Harry set off through the castle, taking care to avoid patrolling prefects. After all, the Cloak only made him invisible, not intangible. If someone bumped into him, he could still end up caught.
The Slytherin stared at Harry’s palm for a moment, brow creased. “Fine.” He gripped Harry’s hand with cool fingers.
Only a few students from each house had stayed, so they practically had the run of the grounds, which resulted in delirious days of fun.
“I’m glad I got to meet you again, after all these years,” Draco said finally. “If Granger hadn’t found that article in the
“What?” Harry asked, half laughing. “I am on holiday. I don’t have a job. I’m literally on permanent holiday.”
Finally, before shrugging on his robes, Draco picked up his small bottle of cologne, dabbing the expensive scent delicately on his wrists and neck. Frowning, he shook the bottle, peering through the navy-tinted glass.
He walked numbly to his classes, clinging to his books as if they could save him. He kept him head down, not able to bear the sight of Harry even flashing in the corner of his gaze. He sat with his back to the Gryffindor table, talking quietly to his friends, who watched him with worried eyes and blatant concern that would have looked more at home at the Hufflepuff table. He felt frozen, throwing himself into his schoolwork, staying up all night studying, dark shadows taking up permanent residence under his eyes, gulping down goblets full of coffee to keep himself going. Even the caffeine didn’t work all the time though, and to his shame, he found himself nodding off in class on more than one occasion.
Harry stifled a yawn, and took another bite of his toast. Ron had been so nervous about his approaching date with Hermione that he had barely been able to eat a thing at breakfast, sitting down for only a minute before dragging Harry, who had quickly snagged a piece of toast, back upstairs to watch Ron tread a hole in the floor with all of his pacing. If Ron was willingly skipping a meal, Harry knew it was serious.
“Crabbe, go grab that for me,” Draco ordered, his curiosity piqued, but not piqued enough to contemplate getting up from his seat himself and jostling his congested head.
Without anyone there to interrupt, Draco easily fell into concentration, fleshing out his portion on the Wizengamot Statute trials until he had completed another inch. He glanced over his work, quite pleased with the result.
Stomach churning, Draco nearly ran out of the Great Hall, ignoring the other students’ annoyance as he elbowed them in his haste to get away from the place where Potter was . . . was . . . was nothing. Draco slumped against the wall in the empty corridor he had escaped to. Potter was allowed to do whatever he liked with whomever he liked. It’s not like Draco had a claim on him. He didn’t even know if he wanted to have a claim on the wizarding world’s Chosen One. But that didn’t matter. Because Draco would never be Potter’s Chosen One. Not in this world or the next and it was about time that he got used to it and stopped his senseless mooning.
“Oh, honestly! If Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter can date, surely two people who are already friends can!” Malfoy said exasperatedly, tugging a hand through his now formerly neat hair. The sight of his wayward locks did funny things to Harry’s insides and he suddenly wished that he and Malfoy were alone so he could mess it up further while snatching teasing kisses from his mouth. Good Godric, the place his mind had become!
“Oh, okay,” Harry scrambled, having difficulty focusing on the mercurial conversation while also managing to keep pace with Malfoy. “Well, I was thinking if there was any kind of shop that sells knitting needles—”
But it was no use. As soon as Draco was able to get the slightest bit absorbed, Potter would shift in his seat or cough or turn a page with what seemed like deafening levels of noise. It was impossible.
The two boys both looked at the floor, shifting awkwardly. Eye-contact suddenly seemed terribly difficult.
“Look out,” Potter urged, leading him so close to the glass that Draco could feel the cold radiating through it. “It’s snowing!”
“No, I’m leaving on Christmas morning actually,” Harry said. “I’ll spend the day with the Weasleys and then head back to my flat.”
Harry hesitated. While his and Malfoy’s relationship was considerably less antagonistic, he knew the Slytherin wouldn’t be able to stop himself from mocking him mercilessly, no matter how much he may have changed. But Malfoy also had a talent for smelling lies, which Harry was no good at telling in the first place.
He turned to see Potter staring out with an absurd, child-like grin on his face, eyes shining with a wonder Draco had never seen on him before. It was rather sweet seeing how excited Potter was just by a few flakes of frozen water.
Harry shook his head. “No, just holding hands and going places together really. I mean, it probably would have come up at some point, but it wasn’t planned at all.” And neither was his absurd reaction to it. He wasn’t supposed to bloody enjoy kissing Draco Malfoy. He wasn’t supposed to get so distracted thinking about kissing Malfoy that he almost got hit in the head by a Bludger. He wasn’t supposed to think about how the next time Malfoy inevitably said something glitteringly pretentious he wanted to shut him up by pressing him up against a wall and kissing him again.
Draco didn’t dare stare too long at the other boy, fearing that if he did, he’d end up doing something stupid like grabbing his red and gold tie and yanking him into a kiss. Stupid like allowing himself to momentarily forget how annoying and idiotic and pathetic Potter was in favour of repeating the instance that had become branded in his mind.
Weasley coughed, staring at his feet as he replied in a strangled tone that he apparently thought sounded natural. “Yeah, I wonder where he got off to. Bit unfair of him, considering he knows that Snape will take it out on Gryffindor. I wouldn’t be surprised if he used this as an excuse to deduct all the points we won from the last Quidditch match.”
“I knew it!” Pansy Parkinson suddenly shrieked, breaking the silence that had been coating the classroom as thickly as the scent of the cologne. “I knew there was something odd going on with you Draco. It’s because Potter has a crush on you, isn’t it? That’s why you’ve been eyeing the Gryffindor table so strangely during meals.”
Also sensing Malfoy’s volatility, Harry pushed through his own swirling whirlpool of emotion before the situation got too out of hand. “One black coffee and one gingerbread latte to go, please,” he said firmly, tossing a mess of bills and coins down onto the counter, grabbing Malfoy by the sleeve and dragging him off to the side while the barista hurriedly made their drinks, shooting them curious glances as they did so.
Harry caught Malfoy’s eye and they shared a rueful look, before going to congratulate the elf, who was grinning widely, very pleased with his victory.
And as always, any other comments you would like to leave, as well as kudos, make my day! Just like Queer Eye and Panic! At the Disco. ;)
Draco couldn’t remember the last time he had felt so relaxed on Christmas day. After opening presents in Gryffindor tower, he and the other Gryffindors had spent the morning messing around in the crisp snow outside, working up an appetite for the Christmas feast. The meal did not disappoint, with all manner of delicious treats appearing on the table. Potter even persuaded him to try a bite of that treacle tart that he swore by and, to Draco’s surprise, it wasn’t half bad. Although it could perhaps simply be that he had grown accustomed to tasting its sweetness on Potter’s lips.
“Hey, Harry,” Hermione said quickly, before turning back to Ron and what one might have supposed to be a riveting conversation, given how wrapped up in it they seemed to be, when Harry really knew that it was likely about something as mundane as their upcoming Charms test.
“It’s alright,” Harry reassured her quickly, tucking his wand into a pocket in his robe and tugging his notes out of his bag. He was certain that Flitwick had never mentioned the possibility of the cloud changing colours, but then again, maybe he had.
Potter fiddled with his hair, tugging his hand through the unruly waves while he stared at the scuffed floor.
“Being an ex-Death Eaters does have some perks,” he said grimly, eyes cast down into the bottom of his cup.
Harry had always known that Draco Malfoy was bad news. And although the definition of what made him bad news had changed over the years, the statement was still true. Only now, Draco Malfoy was bad news because Harry couldn’t keep his eyes off of him. And soon someone was going to notice the Chosen One staring fixedly at the Slytherin table like he was in the middle of a Quidditch game and the sea of green and silver uniforms were hiding the Golden Snitch. And that was bad news. Front page of the Prophet bad news.
Harry continued to wander, smiling hello whenever he passed people. People who simply nodded politely back, instead of screaming at him about something and starting a frenzied rush of onlookers. No one carried that he was Harry Potter. No one cared that he had a jagged lightening scar, or had been forced to fight a war against a murderer. He was just a twenty-three year old bloke who looked like he could use a haircut. None of these people knew anything about him. He could be in uni studying philosophy or the lead singer in a band or a good-for-nothing who still lived in his parents’ basement watching telly all day. None of them knew a goddamn thing about him.
Finally, the aisle cleared. Harry carefully set Malfoy back on his feet. The other boy muttered a reluctant “thank you”, before beginning to climb up towards the seats he had spotted. Insides churning uncomfortably from the leftover adrenaline of the moment, Harry followed.
“Do you have a problem with my kissing, Potter?” Draco asked, sliding his hand up from its place in the crook of Harry’s arm. “Because that’s certainly not what I heard last night.”
Malfoy smiled wanly. “It’s alright. Even when I looked forward to Christmas, I still couldn’t stand themed drinks, so fear not. There is still no world in which I would drink a liquid cookie.”
He shrugged carelessly. “Guess I forgot.” He went back to eating, exaggerating his dismissal with each motion.
Before the Battle, people had known who he was. But he was still a vague hope more than anything else. Someone to be kept an eye on, sure, but still just a kid with dead parents and a funny scar. Good for an opinion piece or two, but still no one really worth obsessing over.
Malfoy continued in that strange, off-putting monotone, “Bathroom is just across the hall, meals are whenever you like them, just go into the kitchen and ask O’Leary. You are welcome to go anywhere in the house except for my room and do not touch the piano. If there’s anything you need, ask either me or O’Leary.”
That was not the case for Malfoy. He and Madam Malkin spent ages discussing various hues of the required Hogwarts black, studying small squares that all looked identical to Harry. Sighing, he slumped back into a chair beside Madam Malkin’s desk, eyes idly analyzing Malfoy’s current robes. While Harry had worn the Muggle jeans and shirt that he always wore when out of school, Malfoy looked every inch the part of a high society wizard, despite the fact that since his father had been sent to Azkaban at the end of the war, many social circles had been abruptly snapped shut to him and his mother. His crisp gray robes were tailored in a way that no other teenage wizard would care about, making him look older than his seventeen years. Even now, with his gray robes and his green tie, he paid homage to his Hogwarts house. His loyalty to Slytherin almost could have landed him in Hufflepuff.
He shoved his wand back into his pocket as he walked towards their steps, but paused, attention caught on a speck on his sleeve. Frowning, he looked closer and saw that it was a small, white flake. Seconds later, another one joined it, lilting out of the sky and sticking on the thick black fabric.
Harry stepped away from the stall, weaving his way out of the crowd and taking a large sip of the spiked eggnog, which warmed him to his core, burning away any chills from lying in the snow. And from Malfoy.
Malfoy paled, white as the snow on the ground. “Well, as much as I’d love to stay and chat,” he sneered. “I’ve got to go meet someone, so why don’t you go off and fuck yourself, Potter?” He spun on his heel, stalking away into the market crowd.
“Because . . .” He wracked his brain furiously, patience fraying, trying to come up with something that would put an end to this nightmarish experience. “Because I’m dating Malfoy!”
Finally, the hand reached ten and Harry immediately sprung out of his seat with a suspicious amount of enthusiasm.
But before Harry could get another word out, Malfoy threw his handful of powder into the flames, which immediately turned a violent green colour, and, ducking his head down, stepped into them and shouted clearly “67 Meadowes Lane!” promptly vanishing in a swirl of emerald fire.
They made their way downstairs into the living room, where O’Leary was standing beside the shining tree.
“Um, well . . .” he stammered, nearly knocking a flagon of pumpkin juice off the table with his elbow.
“Oh. Right, sorry, of course,” Harry said, stepping further back and shoving his hands in his jean’s pockets, blushing. “Go ahead, please.”
Ron frowned, fiddling with the ends of his overlong robe sleeves (a hand-me-down from a longer limbed brother) as he tried to think of a worthy response.
He patted him on the head, still smirking. “It was good for you. You enjoy Christmas entirely too much. It’s not healthy. You needed to bad-mouth it at least a little bit.”
Later that night, Harry was getting ready for bed, exhausted from his early wake up at six a.m. He was just about to crawl under his covers, when he heard a faint sound from downstairs. Cracking open the door and going out into the hallway, he could now better hear that it was the song the carolers had been singing, ‘Silent Night’, being played on the piano. It was slower now, each note placed with steady intention. It was sad as well, peaceful, but heart-breaking at the same time.
Harry’s small flat looked as though it had been ransacked. Clothes were flung across the bedroom, as he rummaged through his wardrobe and grabbed anything he thought he might need for his vacation. Hermione had lent him her bottomless bag and he stuffed in a final armful of jumpers before closing it and tucking it into his coat pocket beside his wand.
Harry watched in awe as Malfoy began playing from memory, the melody slow, but sweet, and unlike anything he’d ever heard before. He must have practiced when Harry was out of the house.
Malfoy leaned against the wall, all casual lines and aristocracy, even in his jumper. “I really should reprimand O’Leary for this,” he said, staring pointedly at Harry.
Shrugging into his coat and stepping into his boots, Harry looked out the pane of glass set beside the front door, frowning as he saw the still half-cleared walkway at the front of the house.
The frozen crystals burned harshly against Draco’s face and he rolled over onto his back, skin stinging. Beside him, Potter flopped upward, panting.
Harry glared at him, grabbing the Slytherin’s coffee mug and holding it hostage far out on his other side, much to Malfoy’s protestations. “This isn’t funny! Look, you can bring your friends too. Slytherins seem to get pretty weird about this stuff, so maybe their presence will keep Ron and Hermione more focused on their surroundings.”
Harry shrugged. “I should have expected it. I mean, I was in Diagon Alley. What did I think was going to happen? I’d walk down the street like I was wearing the Cloak?”
“Hermione, please, it’s far too early in the morning for a psychological impact discussion!” Ron groaned, resting his head on the table.
Not losing a beat, Pansy smirked. “No cards.” She laid down her hand, the combination of cards causing Granger to groan, although Draco still wasn’t entirely sure why. There were too many bloody different things to keep track of.
“I’m writing to Father Christmas,” Harry finally admitted, bracing himself for the barrage of laughter about to come him way.
The Ravenclaw keeper made a desperate reach but was too late, the Quaffle smashing through the center hoop to thunderous applause. But before the Hufflepuff team could have even a moment of triumph, the Ravenclaw chasers were tearing back down the pitch towards their goal posts, the yellow-robed team hot on their heels, desperate to catch up.
“Thank you,” the lady said, obviously pleased. “I made them myself, just like I do for my grandkids. Keep your head nice and cozy.”
“I guess that’s all there is to do,” Draco admitted gloomily. Merlin, Potter was never going to let him live this one down!
He sunk back against the snow, the cold sinking through his already damp cloak, warm only where he was pressed against Potter. But that didn’t matter somehow. Because as Draco looked up at the sparkling night sky and quietly murmured stories about heroes and magic and dragons into Potter’s ear, a soft smile crept onto his face, brought on by a pure, peaceful light filling him in a way that it hadn’t for a long time.
“Please come in,” Malfoy said, gesturing for them to follow him into the living room. “I know that O’Leary is making some tea and cookies for us all to have.”
“Mmm,” Malfoy said mockingly. “How very dedicated of you. Shame that Slytherin still is going to win the Cup despite all your ‘prep’.”
“Hey, Potter, did you hear me?” Malfoy asked, nudging Harry so sharply that he nearly fell off of the broom again. Harry let go of the handle to quickly wrap his arms around Malfoy’s waist as the other boy clutched onto the front of Harry’s robes so tightly that Harry feared Malfoy might finally strangle him, although completely by accident.
Harry opened his mouth, about to demand what in Merlin’s name Malfoy was talking about, when Malfoy suddenly leaned forward and pressed a gentle kiss onto Harry’s lips. Harry looked at him, shocked, holding onto the wall for support.
Obliging, Harry tossed the red ball at Ron’s right shoulder. His friend batted frantically at it, but only succeeded in clipping it and sending it further over his shoulder.
“Oh, but I think I will,” Harry murmured. Feeling emboldened, he leaned over and pressed a kiss to Malfoy’s lips, the sensation still shocking, especially when Malfoy tangled a hand in his scarf and pulled him back for a second one, challenge glinting in his grey eyes.
“Not exactly,” he said slowly, wincing at the thought of his friends’ reactions to his upcoming show. It would have to be damn good or they’d never fall for it.
“Trust me, we all know that.” Harry watched anxiously as Draco picked open the present, revealing a ball of royal blue wool and a set of wooden knitting needles. “I thought since you said you liked making people presents you could learn how to knit, you know, scarves and sweaters and socks and things, only if you want to of course, it was a bit presumptuous for me to think you’d want to learn a hand craft, but I just thought that—”
Adelaide did not appear. Evidently she, too, had sensed that Tertius would not be tolerant of any disobedience just now. But a week after Draco had gone downstairs to take the beating instead of her, she came into the kitchen when he was cooking dinner.
“There must be some pain potion in here,” said Harry, frantically looking through Draco’s potion case.
“Which I was thinking should be this Saturday,” said Harry. Mrs. Weasley had asked for a month’s notice, but
“If someone told you, when you were eleven, that you would marry and have a child with a man who was head over heels in love with you, but you would have to suffer over a decade of poverty and depravation first, wouldn’t you feel as if that was the catch?”
Harry looked as if he couldn’t make up his mind as to how he wanted to react to this statement. Finally, he said,
So, on May 2nd, not quite ten years after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry invited all his closest friends over to the house he shared with Draco. Ron and Hermione brought wine, and Blaise and Pansy bought far more expensive wine. The Weasleys came, and Lee Jordan, and Luna and Neville (Luna looking placid, Neville twitchy), and Theo Nott and Greg Goyle and Marcus Flint, Dean Thomas and Parvati and Lavender and Seamus, and Millicent and the Greengrass sisters, and more besides. They sat in the lovely back garden, drinking Prosecco and eating the appetisers Draco had made from an elaborate cookbook he was determinedly working his way through. The night was warm, and dusk didn’t come until late. Draco had put up bunting and magical fairy lights, and the whole garden looked like a day dream.
Harry wasn’t quite sure how to feel about her exuberant gratitude. She hadn’t been like that about the cloak. She had been serious and reverent.
“Anyway, I’ve fucked it completely,” he said. “I betrayed him. Even if everyone else feels the way you do—”
“Potter,” said Draco, squirming in Harry’s grasp. Harry didn’t mind. The more Draco moved, the more Harry was reminded of the fact that he was holding him. “Potter, people will know we’ve spent the night together.”
“Fuck off,” said Harry. He grabbed Scorpius with one hand and Malfoy’s elbow with the other, and apparated them back to Grimmauld Place. Malfoy sank into a kitchen chair, still holding his face.
“I’m trying. It’s not… I thought it would be easier,” said Draco, his voice cracking slightly. He glanced at Harry’s door. “Let’s go downstairs,” he said.
Draco nodded again, although more tears kept rolling down his face, clearly to his frustration. He wiped them impatiently away.
“Really?” He looked at his father, his excitement leaking away. “Will that… will that change things?”
“I see you in a lovely house in the country. Made of stone,” said Draco. “Maybe in Godric’s Hollow.”
Lamorak laughed so hard and so long that it triggered a horrific coughing fit. Harry had to fetch him a glass of water.
“Oh, uh, hey,” said Harry, stepping forward. Teddy leapt out his chair, crying “Harry!” Then he paused, looking from Draco to Harry, his discomfort transparent on his face.
“I,” said Draco. Because he didn’t, not really. His fears about Harry’s faithfulness had lain under the surface for a while now. It had been like death: something he knew was coming, but that he didn’t have to worry about just yet. Harry loved having sex with Draco. It had been four years, and he still
“No, just to Draco. He’s well-aware of that, by the way, and it makes him even more convinced that every shitty thing you said to him was true.”
Draco secretly clipped out the Quibbler article and hid it under his mattress. It featured a picture of Harry and him grinning at each other. Although he and Harry had made Rita Skeeter want to tear her hair out with their awkwardness, she had printed their conversation with almost no narrativising.
The kettle began to shriek. Draco took it off the hob and poured the boiling water into the mugs. He found a large silver spoon and checked his reflection in the back of it.
“I was hoping you would be gracious about this. All right. I suppose the first thing that comes to mind is making fun of you for being an orphan.”
“I love you,” he heard Malfoy say, his words barely carrying over the sound of the train. Scorpius turned to his father and Harry watched as they both formulated their faces to hide their distress. Neither of them could quite manage it.
“It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t have to be perfect. You can get a different one in six months if you don’t like whatever you choose. You just have to try
“I love you too,” said Draco, and Harry broke out into a wide grin. Draco had never actually said it before, not in so many words, although he had shown it in a million little ways, from the moment he and Cassie had appeared in Harry’s life.
“All this is a bit of a waste of time,” said Harry, brushing his hands up and down the soft cashmere sleeves. “I’ll still look like an idiot in the real world.”
Harry had the distinct impression that Draco had been waiting for him to return so he wouldn’t have to repeat himself. He handed Draco the tea.
“Cedric Diggory didn’t deserve to die,” he said fiercely. Malfoy blinked at him. He seemed to be thinking what to say. Harry thought if Malfoy tried to apologise, he might punch him.
They had settled it, eventually. Draco would leave a catalogue out on the kitchen table, with what he wanted circled in red pen, and Harry would buy it for him. But it was nicer, not to have to do that. Simply to receive things he loved, unexpectedly, knowing Clarence had picked them out.
That night, Harry went to Ron and Hermione’s for dinner. He managed to ask questions about their lives, and not let on that his whole world had been upturned, until dessert.
“Each better than the last. Well, except for book nine. Griselda Crowley had been dosed with Amortentia when she wrote that one, so it’s mainly porn.”
“Thanks,” said Harry, and Draco moved away. Hermione tracked the motion with her eyes as Harry told the girl with the camera to clear out.
“I’m—I think I’m lonely,” said Harry. “And for whatever reason, I’ve been spilling my soul out to you for years, and you’ve never turned on me, when you must know how much a single letter would sell for—”
Harry tentatively reached out to put a hand on Draco’s shoulder. Draco turned towards him as if he had been waiting for permission. He curled close into Harry’s arms, nestling under his chin.
“Draco, eh?” said Sam, coming forward to look at Draco. Draco stood so straight that he appeared about three inches taller than usual, and his left hand was balled into a fist in the pocket of the jacket Harry had leant him, clenched around his wand. “So, you’re the man who was so keen on keeping Addy for himself.”
He scanned the room, frowning, as if he was looking for someone specific. Then his eyes landed on Draco, and his whole face came alive. He strode through the crowd, coming straight for Draco.
“Quiche,” she said, joyfully. Actual joy. How did someone get to be the sort of person who rejoiced over quiche? He wished he could discover the secret.
“I’ve got some crazy pure Columbian shit, just in,” said Anika. She cast a quick spell so that no one would see them, then got out a small baggie of white powder. “Here, gum it.”
Malfoy wasn’t just good at talking about quidditch. It was his questions, really, that made him so easy to talk to. Harry realised this after he found that he had just monologued for the better part of an hour about What Hogwarts Meant To Him. He hadn’t intended to go into it at all. They had been talking casually about eighth year, and Harry said he was looking forward to it. Malfoy seized upon this.
“Hermione,” said Harry. “It’s okay. I’ll sort it out. You know I will. Just leave it with me, okay?”
“I don’t understand when she’s even had time to see him,” said Draco. “She’s been so busy with cooking club.”
The second time Harry came over that week, it was when Draco was teaching Adelaide Defence Against the Dark Arts. Draco had known it was a bad idea to have him over, it made him nervous and tongue-tied to have Harry watching him, but Harry had asked so hopefully, said
There was a long pause, in which Draco gently moved his fingers, back and forth, back and forth, on Harry’s arm.
From the way Draco was looking at him, Harry knew he felt the same. He knew Draco was just as mystified by this turn of events as Harry was. Not just the sex: the friendship. The survival. The fact that they were there at all, that they hadn’t both been killed as teenagers, possibly by each other.
“Will you stay for a drink, or…?” asked Harry, even though he’d told himself a second before that he wouldn’t push.
“Well, that helped,” said Harry. “But also, I realised that I don’t need anyone’s blessing. Anyone who can’t accept someone who makes me so happy doesn’t deserve to be my friend.”
Harry remembered how solemn Draco had been when Harry found him, that first time. There was a world of difference between how he had reacted to Harry then, and how he chattered away to Hermione, now.
Draco closed his eyes and stretched out his legs. They ached from being curled into his chest all day — or was it all night? It was so dark in Azkaban. So dark, and so cold. His spine shivered painfully, and he drew his legs back for warmth, although it hurt him.
“So, Draco, how did you get your scars?” asked Mark, sucking on a milkshake. Draco smiled a wide, crocodile smile, but under the table his knee knocked reassuringly against Harry’s.
“Well… yeah, I suppose so. I just feel a bit useless, sometimes. It’s pretty hard to top defeating Voldemort at seventeen.”
“Oh, no,” she said, starting to close the door. “No, absolutely not. I tolerated the sex cam stuff, but he is not setting up a brothel in here. No.”
“Let’s stop at the market and get some asparagus,” he said. “Ron and Hermione are coming over for lunch.”
Hermione couldn’t come to the pub quiz the next week, but Luna brought Millicent Bulstrode. Draco and Milly sat next to each other and talked in quiet undertones all evening. He didn’t blank out once.
Harry went back with them to their flat, where Adelaide seemed to relax. She disappeared into her room several times, and each time she did, Draco came towards Harry as if called to him, leant quietly against him for a few moments, drawing away when Adelaide reappeared.
Draco made the teas in silence. He didn’t drink his. He fell asleep at the kitchen table, his head in his arms.
“What if he’s been sleeping with a psycho super-fan, like that one who kept sending him her underwear in the post, and she’s gone mental and flayed him so that she could wear his skin as a cloak?”
“Harry…” He stirred his drink some more, although it definitely didn’t need it. “Let’s talk about something else.”
“Obviously,” she said. She looked at him with hard, considering eyes. “Draco has a tendency to like people who mistreat him. My therapist says it’s probably a daddy-issue thing.”
“No, Harry,” she said. “Your strength is that people listen to you. They look up to you and admire you.”
I will update soon! I have the next chapter written but I like to be several chapters ahead of myself in case I need to make changes. Usually I can do 2k a day but atm all bets are off bc my country is on fire
“Draco took me to a pantomime and then we broke in to the backstage area and I got to meet all the actors!” said Teddy.
“This is a bad and stupid idea,” said Harry, slowly, enunciating each word. “Do not do this. He cheated on you. He was a dick about it. He called you a—”
Harry hadn’t known that Pansy and Seamus were so close. They made constant references to things they had done together (
, Potter. I’m used to the Cruciatus curse. I only fell apart like that because I didn’t see it coming.”
“There’s a fifth year girl getting badly teased. I’m in the process of… revamping her image. You’re to take her out on a long and highly visible walk on the grounds, and tell three different people loudly in the Slytherin common room that you think she’s pretty.”
Draco flattened his expression and thought furiously. Potter had saved him. Again. That was what Potter did; he saved people. Was it because he liked being a saviour? If so, Draco would give him opportunities to make him feel magnanimous and good.
They were both silent as Harry busied himself with the kettle. Harry realised he knew how Malfoy took his tea, or at least, how he had taken it at Hogwarts.
But mostly, Harry and Scorpius got on wonderfully, even through Scorpius’ teenage rebellion. In any case, as rebellions went, it was pretty harmless. He seemed to think that the best way to distance himself from both Harry
“I brought you a drink,” said Astoria, appearing as if from nowhere in front of them. She gave Draco a mug of Firewhisky and Draco broke off glaring at Harry to drain it.
“Well, I told him that Mysteries was looking for an excuse to fire you. They aren’t!” she said, catching sight of his expression. “But I told him that if he told us about the kinds of protections you had on your desk, his sentence would be reduced.
“It’s really pretty hard to adjust to the idea that you’re the stoic, suffer-in-silence type. I spent my whole life thinking you were a hypochondriac.”
“Oh, I’d love a cuddle,” he said, clearly trying to make his voice sultry, “although I hope that’s code for something more exciting…”
“No,” said Harry. “No, we’re taking things slow, remember? I’ll see you three times a week, until Adelaide’s a bit more familiar.”
“Yeah,” he said. “Great, this weekend. Great. Er. I’ll go then, now. This weekend? You’ll let me know?”
“Please. He loved it. He boasted about his connection to Voldemort in sixth year, remember? On the train? Harry?”
God, he really was quite drunk. Had he just said that? But he went on, ignoring Ron’s glowering look. Hermione had her head her hands. Malfoy, infuriatingly, looked completely undisturbed.
“Look, stars,” said Malfoy. He was on MDMA again; Harry could tell from the dreamy quality to his voice.
Their lips touched softly, tingling and sensitive, so little needed—each movement huge because of the attention it commanded. Harry’s hands went to Draco’s back, but they moved slowly, and the pressure was so light, as if Draco was something peerless, that must be handled carefully or not at all. Draco, for his part, had his fingers in Harry’s dark hair, feeling the elegant curve of his skull, the strength of him, the wholeness.
“What does he do for money? I know he lost his fortune. That’s what comes of fighting on the wrong side of a war.”
“Maybe—this weekend? If Adelaide agrees. The three of us could go to a park, or something,” said Draco.
! What kind of a father was he? How dare he let Scorpius believe that was fair? That Scorpius deserved to live in fear of his father being murdered in their home?
Draco was the only Death Eater who escaped prison. Harry, Ron and Hermione all testified that he had deliberately lied to save their lives. Dean and Luna came forward, too. They had apparently overheard him trying to quit the Death Eaters and being punished by his father.
“…I meant, the plan,” said Hermione. “The press. They seem to have believe that it’s a real marriage.”
Draco made chocolate chip pancakes and bacon and eggs. He poured Harry a glass of orange juice and set the rickety IKEA table with placemats and cloth napkins.
“I don’t know that that’s such a good idea,” said Bianca. “You’re a little… close to this case, Harry.”
“I wish I could do it under a glamour,” said Harry, sitting in front of his new laptop. (His old one had not recovered from the bin juice.)
Draco’s door burst open and Potter poked his head through. Draco noticed unhappily that Potter clearly couldn’t see his mother. He knew she was dead, but this fresh evidence hit him harder than expected. He carefully straightened his face.
“I don’t want to call it off,” said Harry. “I just…” he took a step closer to Draco. “I keep thinking about Stanislaus, honestly.”
Harry didn’t know how to respond to that. They had scarcely talked since the era when they had fought on opposite sides of a war. But Draco had looked after him when he was vulnerable. Draco had fallen in love with someone Harry knew to be decent and kind. Draco had read hundreds of Harry’s letters and never once used them against him.
“Yeah, all right,” said Harry, who felt a little like a storm had hit him, bursting out of a clear blue sky. But then, that was Draco all over, and if Harry had to wrestle him into being sensible, he would. “But I don’t know why you thought that. I love you.”
“I should go,” agreed Draco, and came in for another kiss. Harry broke away and kissed his temple, his ear. “I’m going.”
Potter looked disconcerted. He rubbed the back of his neck. He was horribly handsome, thought Draco, but it was more than that. It was that Potter was
he wanted to say, but he had the impression that Draco would flee the country if he tried that. “I don’t think you’re a bad person.”
“Give it up, Blaise. It’s pathetic, and it’s cowardly. If you care about someone, you should treat them like they matter.”
“I’m sorry your day’s been shit,” he whispered into Draco’s hair. “I won’t mention it again, I promise, but I’m still sorry.”
“I glamour it usually,” said Draco, his voice coming out in slightly broken fragments. “I was too tired today.”
“Actually, I was shocked by how many people were kind to me. A teenage girl brought me a hot chicken sandwich and told me I was handsome, once. It’s silly, but it meant a lot, that someone could still think that of me.”
One night, however, he went out without his cloak. He went to an expensive, unfashionable bar on Knockturn Alley and bought an overpriced gin and tonic. A few people asked him for his autograph, but he was so profoundly rude to them they started to leave him alone. He wrapped his hands around the cool glass and tried not to think.
“It’s a good picture,” said Astoria, “and the article is very flattering. You open next week, don’t you?”
“Well, you should have dressed warmer,” Malfoy rolled his eyes. “And actually listened when we agreed to meet at quarter to three.”
“Not really, Draco,” Harry said through gritted teeth, arm muscles aching as he reached the portrait of the Fat Lady. “I’m a Seeker. And you weigh a lot more than the Snitch!”
Despite Harry’s efforts to make Draco comfortable in his world, Draco didn’t seem to like Harry’s flat. He preferred to meet in muggle pubs, and spend time with the Slytherins. Harry suspected this was the lingering effect of Blaise’s secrecy.
“Oh,” said Malfoy, and he smiled, although it looked uncomfortable. “My health. It’s good. I’m very healthy. How is your health, other than your shoulder?”
,” said Draco, more sharply. His tears stopped. His expression had hardened considerably at the mention of his father.
“Harry, you can’t, it’s too much responsibility— it’s the last thing you need right now,” said Hermione urgently.
So Hermione, Ron, Ginny and George all hugged him and waved goodbye to Draco, who didn’t even notice when they left. They apparated away, and Harry refreshed his warming charm. He curled up in the sleigh and watched Draco fly around the ice. It was just the two of them, alone together in Wiltshire. It was funny thinking that a year ago, that would have made his skin prickle with fear.
, pulling his foreskin over the little mushroom head and back down, again and again. He would reach down and weigh his sac in his hand, roll the testicles around a little, wonder if something was wrong with him, and if he should go to the Hospital Wing… but his mortification at the idea would be too much, and he would resolve to play with his little cock until it stopped throbbing and leaking and begging for someone to take care of it.
Draco had to strangle a moan of his own as he watched Harry struggle with his sudden erection. He wanted to stand and walk straight up to the Gryffindor and stare down his nose at him, look into those eyes as Potter tried so
At that thought, Draco had to stuff his fist into his lap to grab frantically at his cock and stave off an orgasm. He breathed deeply through his nose a few times, trying to calm down enough not to humiliate himself. It worked. His dick remained stubbornly upright for the rest of dinner, but he didn’t come. Whether or not Potter had once he reached wherever he had fled to was a mystery, but Draco kept the spell active long after Harry had absconded. Draco exited the Hall once he had finished eating, one agonizing half hour later, hiding his impressive hard-on behind the books he had brought with him for just such an occasion. He reached his own dorm and scarcely had time to shut the door behind himself before his hands flew to his crotch, pulling out his dick and moaning in relief when the cool dungeon air curled around his balls. He started pumping his cock, urging the spell towards Harry once more. Maybe Potter had masturbated after he had left. Draco could hardly imagine ignoring such an intense need. But Draco hadn’t let the spell up once since he had cast it, so even if Harry had come, his cock would have remained erect and twitching after his orgasm. With the effort Draco was putting into the spell, he knew that Potter would be forced to take himself in hand again. Maybe his cock would still be sensitive, but he wouldn’t have a choice. He would rub and twist and pull and tweak at his penis even as he cringed at the sensation, because his balls were
, slotted between his nightstand and his bed, where he had left it after smuggling it out of the Restricted Section. He had employed a single spell from the book so far. Just one. There were others than he had yet to try. He smirked, full of anticipation- he knew exactly who he was going to use them on. As he tucked himself back into his pants and set about preparing for the evening, Draco suddenly realized that he had never released the spell on Potter. He resolved to release the boy before he went to bed: the idea of Potter squirming for the rest of the night, trying to hide his chubby little penis from his friends, was too enchanting to give up.
. With the newfound peace that permeated the Hogwarts student body after they returned for their eighth year, he found himself slowly going out of his mind with boredom. Slytherins weren’t sneered upon the way they had been pre-war, so there was no need to prank the other three houses in retaliation. Potter and his fan club no longer felt the need to flout school rules at every turn, so classes became benign, rote,
It worked. Potter stood up, mumbling something Draco couldn’t hear to Granger, and strode purposefully towards the exit of the Hall. As he whirled, Draco memorized the way he was blushing so furiously, his hands clenched at his sides, his teeth clearly gritted against the inexplicable pleasure that assaulted him. The best part was the instant during Harry’s turn where he stood in profile to Draco. Robes typically hid the occasional hard-on, but when you were hard as nails and all but drilling a hole in your pants, your only hope was to carry your books in front of you while you escaped to the nearest place suitable for a quick wank. It being dinner, Potter had no such books to hide behind, and Draco had ensured that Potter’s cock would be harder than it ever had been in its life. So, Draco was treated to the view of the tent Harry had made in his robes, as, he noticed with glee, were a few other students at the Gryffindor table. Snickers followed Harry out of the Hall. Draco twitched so hard he was afraid his cock would pop out the top of his pants.
Draco barely managed to contain himself for twenty-four hours after finding the book. He had tested one of the spells on himself with great success the night previous and fisted his cock to completion at the thought of using it on Potter. The next morning, he woke up aching in his pants and obligingly fucked his fist again until he spattered come onto his bedsheets. A quick
and if he could only relieve the pressure on them once more, maybe he would feel better. If the boy managed a second orgasm, shooting come from the tip of his tiny little dick, he would look down to find himself still hard, his balls still pulled tight towards his body with the urge to burst. Maybe Harry would moan in frustration. Maybe his eyes would water at the feeling of reaching down to stroke his cock
Potter and his friends always sat at the end of their table, furthest from the teachers. Typically, Draco would sit as far as possible from Potter, to avoid confronting his enduring and maddening lust while he was attempting to enjoy his meal. Tonight, he sat himself at the same end Potter would inevitably choose, facing towards the Gryffindor’s table. He collected a small pile of food on his plate, paying no mind to what he was selecting, and waited. Bare moments later, Potter and his entourage swept into the Hall.
Draco wanted to see it. He wanted Potter to see his. For the Gryffindor to reach towards the placket of his trousers with that delicate pink blush staining his cheeks, to watch as it darkened once Potter felt his member straining towards his fingertips. For trembling, virginal fingers to unzip him and slowly tug him through the slit of his pants, and gasp at what was revealed. Unfortunately, he was Draco Malfoy, and Potter was Potter. So, Draco was forced to remain bored and horny for the first few months of their eighth year at Hogwarts.
Draco didn’t know if the spell had an upper limit, but he was certainly going to try to find it. He urged the spell towards Harry again, imagining the boy’s penis bulging further, drooling precum into his pants, throbbing as it slid in the slick mess of its own creation, his testicles aching with their need to pump his come into his dick. The spell couldn’t generate an orgasm, but it could arouse to within an inch of one. Draco knew this. He wanted to see Potter writhe with the effort to not simply reach down and give himself some sort of relief.
Despite his two recent orgasms, Draco spent the remainder of the day at half-mast. The knowledge of what he was planning to do had him on the edge of his seat. He couldn’t even manage to Transfigure his feather duster into a hawk during class, which, given his typical affinity for Transfiguration, had McGonagall perplexed. When dinnertime arrived, Draco all but ran to the Great Hall to ensure he could have the best seat possible.
Draco aborted that line of thought before it could reach its natural conclusion. He was already on the verge of taking himself in hand, hundreds of students surrounding him be damned. He needed his wits about him long enough to cast the spell, at least. So, shortly after dinner began in earnest, and Harry was deep in conversation with Thomas about something or other, Draco palmed his wand, pointed it at Potter, and uttered the incantation under his breath.
stout. Utterly unimpressive. Were Draco to run and catch up to Potter, to pull Boy Wonder’s cock out for the other students to see, they would inevitably laugh at their Saviour’s pathetic length.
The war was over, the Light had won, his father was locked away for life, and he and his mother had received full pardons. Turns out, it is difficult to prosecute women who had saved the Chosen One’s life, or indeed underage boys who had been coerced into such terrible acts by their father. Throw one Golden Boy’s testimony to their innocence into the mix, and Draco and Narcissa had hardly been before the Wizengamot for ten minutes before they had been released. His father, the evil, bootlicking prick that he was, now languished in a cell in Azkaban. Good riddance.
Nothing much happened to start. Potter shifted and continued to speak with Thomas as if nothing had occurred. But, as the minutes wore on, Draco noticed that Potter was shifting more often, and with greater urgency than before. That blush that Draco so adored had spilled across his cheeks, faint though it was. Draco picked something from his plate and pretended to eat, while watching Potter with an intensity that would alarm anyone who happened to take notice. Draco was glad for his voluminous robes at that moment, because he was now fully hard in the middle of the Great Hall.
Which made his current existence fairly miserable. If he could no longer while away his days getting under Potter’s skin at every opportunity, then he was forced to instead spend his time noticing things like the lovely flush Potter would get on his cheekbones when he was chastised for delivering an incorrect response during a class. Or the way he’d avert his eyes and bite his lip whenever someone directed praise towards him that exceeded his capacity for sentimentalism. An embarrassed Potter was, quite frankly,
“I broke up with Chett that night.” He rolled over onto his side, resting his head on his bent arm, staring straight ahead, at Harry’s thighs. “I know you’ve been seeing other people. I know you still want to have sex with me. I don’t know if you still want… I know you deserve better than me, not only because of our past, but because I haven’t treated you well throughout this. So… that’s the whole story. If you want me, I’m yours. However you want me. Even if it’s not how I want it.”
“Yeah,” said Ron, who kept looking at Harry. Harry wished he wouldn’t. It was abundantly clear that Draco was doing his best to pretend Harry wasn’t in the room.
“Would you let me see your tongue?” he asked. He didn’t know why, but it was important. He had to check it was okay.
But she greeted him in the waiting room with a nervous smile. She had dressed up, as if he were someone important. It was unbelievable how touching Draco found that.
“Say you tell him, and he forgives you,” said Hermione, frowning. She seemed rather dazed. “What then? This is
“You’re not supposed to hit women,” said Draco, slicing into a poached egg, “so I am keeping my distance from Astoria until the urge passes.”
“No, it’s different. You’ll see— when you know me better. You’ll see that you don’t actually like me.”
, he had almost said. He had sent it to Draco’s lawyers, at least, and they had assured him it had been returned. “I thought prisoners had their wands returned to them upon release,” he said.
“I really, really like having you for a friend, Harry,” he said, and then Pansy burst in with Ron, both of them saying “okay okay okay let’s get
“Fine, fine,” said Draco. “My headache’s stopped, it feels marvellous. Just let me lean my head on your shoulder, would you?”
“My parents found me,” said Draco, as if he was answering a question. “About six months after I ran.”
“He seems all right, now,” said Harry. “Not saying I’m over all… all the stuff from before. I mean. I haven’t
Harry wasn’t sure where that left them. It was pretty obvious that he and Draco were drawn to each other, but also that Draco had no intention of breaking up with Neville, and what was Harry supposed to do with that?
It was all right. He still had himself. And however dire Potter’s interrogation had been, Draco’s faith was unshaken: Potter would fix everything. He had given Potter the information he needed to fix everything.
“I went looking for him after that. Astoria found him first. Took him back to France. Killed herself a few months later. It was a pretty rough homecoming, I imagine.”
But when he woke up and took his anti-hangover potion (it was sitting on his bedside table in a crystal tumbler, courtesy of his house), he couldn’t stop thinking of how it had been when Malfoy got lost in his head. It had frightened Harry, and he didn’t know what it meant that he had been unable to call him back to himself. Eve and Flora both acted as if it was nothing, which Harry worried meant it happened frequently.
“My sweet boy,” she said, stroking his hair. “He isn’t worth it. I know it hurts now, but one day, you’ll find a boy who will love you the way you deserve to be loved.”
Bianca muttered something about professionalism under her breath as she scribbled in her notebook. Harry ignored her.
“Right,” said Harry, frowning. “Only I’d rather not think of it as paying you for sex, to be honest.”
It took several times, but finally he cracked her. She had picked a subject beforehand without telling him, and when Draco stumbled upon it (eighth century dream magic) she began talking enthusiastically. It felt to Draco like eating shellfish: one had to break through the clunking armour to access the meat.
“No matter what, Draco, you must get out of this place. Take any option, other than here. You will go mad if you stay.”
“But…” said Draco. He could clearly see that he had misstepped, that Hermione thought he was about to insult her. “… but aren’t churches where Muggles go to think about what Hell will be like?”
Luna was happy to see him. He had been too sick to make the last event, and she filled him in as she made him a glass of hot water and lemon. He looked around her comfortable kitchen, wondering if he would ever see it again. He had passed so many pleasant hours there in the past few months, planning parties.
“I think I’d take it slow. Well, slow-ish. I’d straddle you in that chair, and just kiss you, to begin with; my hands in your hair. I like the look of your hair. I bet you’d let me tug on it, if I asked nicely.”
He saw Malfoy so often because he fancied him, of course, because he loved watching Malfoy in different situations, seeing him shift from poised to comfortable in a matter of seconds depending on who he was with. He went because he liked Malfoy’s friends, liked how they didn’t know who Harry Potter was, only Harry.
“Neville was so sure it would be okay,” said Draco, as if he was apologising. “But the things I did aren’t… it would be
probably thought it was sexy. “But a little… militaristically. It was too uptight. You dressed as if you were still fighting in a war. This… this is what the prince wears in exile.”
, he thought. He was there because Potter missed sleeping in a tent with Ron and Hermione. He was there because Potter had shit to work through, and Draco was available. He was there for all sorts of mysterious, incomprehensible reasons, none of which suggested that Draco was actually important to him.
Harry didn’t know how to answer that, so he inclined his head, muttered something about finishing a book, and left.
. But the sentiment wasn’t true. The past did not stay in the past. It bled into the present, shaped the future. It mattered
“Yes,” said Healer Bussell. “It seems to have stalled at his last important memory, which appears to have been the end of the war.”
Weeks later, when Draco needed to, he could not remember the kind and sensible things Hermione had said. They had worked like magic, sunk into Draco’s inflamed mind and quietened the barbed thoughts that curled there. Harry holding him, Hermione calmly and methodically talking him from the extreme to the reasonable. It had been the most wholesome gratitude he had ever felt.
“Ah,” said Blaise, carefully laying down his cutlery and folding up his napkin. “I’m glad you brought that up. There’s something I’ve been meaning to have a friendly chat with you about.”

“Did she really say that?” he asked Harry, when Cassie went to her room to start packing. (There was no use telling her she wouldn’t be leaving for a month. She wanted to decide which of her war books she would bring
that if Harry had married someone else— someone more appropriate—less of a fuck-up— this wouldn’t have happened. This was retribution for veering off-script. Draco
“You came,” said a voice. Draco. Harry’s head snapped up. Draco came into the room for once, and closed the door behind him, although he did then slouch against the larder door in his typical fashion.
“That must be nice. I’m scared of literally every option.” Draco sighed. “Please? I’ll text you if anything weird happens. You can leave someone else stationed by my flat. I just…”
Blaise paused, not looking round. He was still for a few seconds, then pushed the door silently open and slipped inside.
“Saturday, sure,” said Draco, sounding slightly manic. “Don’t think I had any other plans, so I may as well just marry you.”
“No,” said Cassie. “Never. But I’ve picked up on it from people who come into the shop. I think it’s so romantic, that you fell in love despite being on opposite sides! Like Romeo and Juliet. Do you have a boyfriend or girlfriend, now? The newspapers don’t say.”
“Ha, ha,” said Malfoy weakly. He sat up. “Right. Well, this is good, this is very good. Absolutely splendid. I’m in prison—”
The door opened, and the handsome young intern whose face Harry had briefly borrowed poked his head in.
cuddly,” said the girl whose hand it was, and began stroking his head. He licked up her arm as she laughed. But there was another smell, and Harry went to investigate. It was on the bed: a clean, friendly smell. His friend, his closest friend. The man smiled at him.
The prosecutor was the kind of person Harry loathed the most. He hadn’t been involved in the war, but he accused Malfoy with a smug self-righteousness that made Harry seethe. Not that Harry didn’t also think Malfoy was a bigoted little shit. It was just that Harry felt as if his word should hold more weight than the self-satisfied prick of a lawyer who drew terse, monosyllabic replies from Malfoy with such crowing delight.
“No,” said Draco, with a jolt of panic. Someone might see them together, and tell Tertius. Anyway, he didn’t have any money. “No, take me to yours.”
Malfoy’s eyes widened. He was utterly, bewitchingly lovely, and his long tapered fingers went to his smooth cheeks.

“You know the drill, Potter,” said Draco into his ear. “Tell me the hottest guy you see, and I’ll make sure he goes home with you.”
Harry lifted his left hand to his chest and formed his thumb and index finger into a letter L. Draco’s eyes strayed from Harry’s face to take in the movement. The moment he understood what Harry was doing, he stopped struggling against his captors. In the last glimpse Harry had of him before he was whisked away to be questioned, he threw Harry a look of such unbridled gratitude that Harry’s stomach dropped.
“You’re hurting her, Kinloch,” said Harry. Kinloch loosened his grip on Cassie, who instantly broke free and rushed to Malfoy.
“Nothing,” said Harry, sinking to the floor and hiking his knees up to his chest. “Can you put milk in the tea.”
“Sorry,” said Harry. “I didn’t mean to… Shit, sorry, that was really inconsiderate of me to bring it up. All of it. Sorry. Shit.”
“No!” said Timothy, standing up with sudden energy, then forcing himself to sit down again. “I… I love him. Not as… but… he’s the only person who was kind to me.”
“I know I can’t,” said Draco, irritated. “I’m telling you the truth. Anyway, there’s really not any dirt on him. He’s squeaky clean. Trust me, I was annoyed to discover that, myself.”
He stared at Harry, something like fear still on his face, but also something else, something hungry and desperate and fascinated. Harry knelt in front of him, rested his head in Draco’s lap, and Draco passed cool fingers through his hair. Draco was right about one thing: it was casual, how they showed each other affection. Easy.
“That’s amazing,” said Dean. Harry watched on, feeling rather dazed. Dean hoisted Draco up on his hips. “Remember where we were this time last year?”
Draco was propped up on his pillows. Scorpius had climbed into bed with him, and Draco’s chin was resting on his head. They both looked slightly dazed, and kept laughing, although Draco’s laughs quickly turned to pained winces.
“Wait,” said Harry. Steven and Draco looked at him. “What’s going on with you two? Are you dating, or…”
“Mmgmmmgf,” said Blaise. Harry brought him some orange juice and climbed onto the end of the bed. Blaise was mercifully clothed, and became a bit more human as he drank.
He had chosen the largest bedroom in the house, and put down a thick, velvety green carpet, the colour of moss. The carved four poster bed at the centre of the room was draped with antique green silk embroidered with gold, and the fireplace was made from imported Italian marble. Everything was cosy, neat, and luxurious.
“What are you reading?” asked Harry, finally, in desperation. Draco was wanking with a glint in his eyes that seemed less like arousal than determination.
“Malfoy didn’t cause the war, Ron,” said Hermione. “He was just as caught up in it as the rest of us.”
“I think you’ve got it all, darling,” he said, pushing away the cloth. He wiped the blood out of his eyes and cast a quick cleaning spell. There was a nasty bruise forming on his cheekbone. “Well done. You were very brave.”
Draco: I mean, he could be sleeping with multiple people, and personally I don’t think he’d have a responsibility to tell me, because we’re just keeping it casual, you know?
But Harry only heard “nearly five”, which meant “another two hours in bed with Draco Malfoy”, and cuddled blissfully into the duvet.
Draco was kissing him. Of his own accord. He had definitely instigated that. Harry hadn’t forced him, or pressured him, he was sure he hadn’t, and yet Draco’s lips were moving against his, and his arms were wrapping themselves around Harry, and it was so hot and sparkling and vivid that Harry couldn’t believe it, and then the kiss was over, and Harry was astonished by how clearly he knew—
“He had just come from arresting a group of luddite murderers who only believed in killing with pre-Renaissance weaponry,” said Draco, promptly.
lies about Harry?” asked Kingsley. Draco’s brain flickered awake. He didn’t want to embarrass Harry by admitting that what he had told the
“Nothing,” said Draco. Harry squeezed Draco’s thigh, and Draco continued. “It’s just—you’re patient.”
“I still think it’s more complicated than that,” said Hermione. “And I certainly don’t think Harry can tell Draco he loves him until after the bond is broken.”
“It might help you stop fixating,” said Hermione. “Right now you’re thinking of him as a mystery. You know how you get about mysteries.”
Harry fell asleep while Draco was still getting ready for bed. When he woke up briefly in the night, the kitten slept in the crook of his knee. Later, Harry would remember that night, and wish he had been able to keep it, to capture it.
thought I would have. So don’t you stand there, Harry, and tell me I can’t have it. You said,” and suddenly, all at once, Draco was near tears, “you
He lay awake as the others came to bed, one by one. He listened to them fall asleep, holding his left forearm tightly. He had let Astoria put makeup on it that afternoon. The dark lines of the Mark bled through, no matter how many layers of concealer Astoria applied with a careful sponge.
“I’ll be right back,” he told Clarence, and led Harry out to a gilded antechamber. He closed the door carefully behind him, then turned to look at Harry.
“Get your mind out of the gutter. It’s nothing to do with sex. It’s connection. Haven’t you noticed that you feel better after they touch you?”
“It wasn’t a problem,” said Hermione breezily. “Just don’t shout about it. And start thinking about what bird you’d like to be.”
—but soon he was aware of how good it felt to hold someone. To care for someone. It made him feel as if he couldn’t let himself fly apart, yet. He had a sense that if he could just keep himself from flying apart for… for a few days, maybe, then… there wasn’t end to that thought. He just had to stop himself from jumping out a window.
It was hard to put in words how ridiculous Draco’s onion routine was. Annoyingly, it was, indeed, extremely artistic. As Draco peeled the layers of his costume apart, he became steadily less ridiculous, until he was wearing a white spandex suit that he slowly tore off his body.
He stared unseeingly at his page and thought of every awful thing Malfoy had ever done. There were so many to keep track of that he couldn’t manage it. That evening, he wrote it out on a piece of paper. The list went on and on, dozens of reasons why Malfoy was a fucking awful person.
“I don’t even know what that means,” said Harry. “He is irresponsible. He should not be allowed alone with Teddy unsupervised.”
She and Draco both looked at him with incredulous expressions, but neither of them disagreed. Cassie reached out for Draco, and the three of them walked home like that, in a chain.
“Well, obviously that last one is different, because it’s actually possible.” She paused. “Thank you for saying that about Fred, though.”
“Scorpius!” Malfoy put a hand on Scorpius’ shoulder. “Potter, I apologise. Scorpius, explain yourself.”
“No, I’ve wanted to for a while.” Harry stared up at the light and twirled around until he was dizzy. Draco caught him by the elbow and stopped him knocking into the table. “My parents are dead.”
Harry knew he should go. He had assuaged his guilt, there wasn’t any other reason to stay, there wasn’t. Instead of ending the session, however, he said,
Draco took another inhale of his cigarette. It was much more successful this time. He was beginning to feel pleasantly light-headed.
“Famous Harry Potter,” drawled Draco, sounding suddenly so much like fifth-year Draco that Harry had to resist the instinct to reach for his wand. “Famous and rich and well-loved by all, but she loves me, you know, even if I was a Death Eater…”
The first few days that Draco lived in Grimmauld Place were among the most peaceful of Harry’s life. Ron came over and played a quiet game of chess with Draco. Draco read Harry passages from Thomas Hardy, his favourite muggle author. (Harry was disturbed to learn that the main reason for this was Draco’s assertion that Hardy understood “what life was really like”. As far as Harry could tell, Hardy’s worldview was unremittingly bleak. But Draco told him it was beautiful, and honestly Harry didn’t care too much
“Oh, a villain, yes, that makes sense, they looked like—that. God, God—anyway. Sorry to call again! Sleep well.”
, it felt good; he couldn’t remember the last time someone had touched him like that, not because they had to, or because they wanted to hurt him.
And for Scorpius to be cuddling up to him, just when Malfoy thought that Harry was trying to turn everyone against him…!
He was standing. He wasn’t sure when he had stood up, or what he was going to do next; he had a vague idea that he should storm the Ministry of Magic and spring Draco free like a damsel-in-distress. Hermione seemed to sense this.
But afterwards, Malfoy returned the favour; Harry sprawled out on the stairs, Malfoy on his knees before him, and Harry wanted to touch him so badly that he had to hold on to the bannisters to stop himself.
She trained him for hours at a time. She filled him with theories about people, about what they wanted, about how to make them love him. She was so frightened no one would love him again. Draco understood that her fear was grounded in guilt, but he wished she wouldn’t say it so often.
“You know I wasn’t on board with, with everything my father did. You know that. I saved you, at the Manor.”
Harry didn’t touch him anymore, and he froze up when Draco leant into him. This was one of Draco’s greatest sources of grief. It was dreadful to be tortured every day, dreadful to have someone puppeteering his choices, of course. But losing Harry’s gentle, affectionate touches left Draco with an echoing loneliness that ached as physically as any of his wounds.
“He still might fall in love with you,” she said, as she handed him the spoon. Draco put the bowl down and hopped off the counter so that he could catch her by the elbows.
“It isn’t when things are going well for people that we see their true characters. It’s when things collapse. Your life blew up and you responded with dignity and grace.”
. But Harry had told him to come back to the room; the whole point of the Prisoner’s Bond was that Harry was supposed to keep an eye on Draco, and how was he supposed to do that if Draco was off having inter-house orgies,
A week later, Harry was reading by the fire when Draco fell into his sitting room through the floo. He was extremely dishevelled, and had been crying, as was apparent from the streaky black eyeliner running down his cheeks.
“I’ve never been to Little Venice,” said Harry. Hermione gave him an encouraging little wave as she and Ron stepped into the fireplace and flooed away.
“That’s very generous. But I think you’ll find that anger and resentment are difficult emotions to conceal,” he said.
When the door was shut, he pushed Malfoy against the wall, so hard that Malfoy’s head banged against it with a thud.
Harry knew that he had broken something when he hit Malfoy. It was hard to sit with that knowledge. He didn’t even know what he wanted from Malfoy. He couldn’t date him—obviously not—just the thought made him panic—but the idea of
He could always just tell Draco to share a bed with him every night, he thought sourly. Draco would do it.
“Just let me touch your Mark,” said Harry irritably. Goyle held his arm closer, looking strained. Harry suspected that was his thinking face.
“You know, Andromeda seems to think you’re this family-oriented… reformed… I don’t even know, but it’s completely irresponsible for you to be drinking when you’re supposed to be taking care of Teddy.”
“I know about all sorts of things, Weasley,” said Draco. But his smiled faded when they came out onto the exposed top of the tower.
There was no movement. Harry left the saucer on the floor, then tried to coax Malfoy out with a peacock feather Ginny had once given him for nebulous sexual reasons. The trouble was that Harry didn’t know what he was dealing with: a kitten, or Draco Malfoy furiously seething inside a kitten’s body.
On days when Draco’s spell damage acted up, Harry, Ginny and Hermione did everything they could to make things easier for him. They never spoke about it, and they tried not to let Draco notice the small ways they structured their days around him. He would have protested vehemently. But he didn’t seem to notice that on the days when his head hurt and his balance was worse, Harry was always at his side, with his arm hooked through his, and Ginny served food onto his plate at lunch when his hands trembled too badly, and Hermione helped him read through his notes when his eyes ached.
He stepped away from Steven and saw Draco watching him. He had a strange, dark look in his eyes. But before Harry could figure it out, he had turned away.
she was teaching him. It was some kind of Slytherin code of conduct. It was a way of stealing power through emotions. All the things he took pride in had been stripped from him, and she offered him another form of strength.
?” he asked, not quite gently, but something close. Gentle-adjacent, which Harry found much easier to accept.
Draco nodded and slowly started to undress. Harry turned away. Now he thought about it, Draco always wore long sleeves. The only time Harry had seen his Mark had been during Draco’s burlesque performances.
“Well, that will be the entirety of your account, in that case. I will assist you in the sale of the manor—”
“Dark magic,” said Spooner, for maybe the fifteenth time that morning. “I’m telling you, Malfoy wasn’t in his cell. He’s probably doing blood rituals to sneak around the ministry at night.”
Everyone was in a food coma after the sumptuous feast the house had provided (“It’s fascinating that your house can cook, Harry. That’s really unusual, even in old magical houses!” said Hermione), and they were lounging around the living room in varying states of digestion.
Half an hour later, Harry stood on the doorstep of Draco’s flat. He wasn’t sure what, exactly, he was doing. He felt as if his head had been spinning ever since he got Draco’s first letter.
“Right! Sorry,” said Harry, and he handed Malfoy the bottle and a clean tea towel. Malfoy’s hands were shaking, and he clearly couldn’t see well with all the blood in his eyes.
“He’s Teddy’s cousin, you know,” said Harry. “Teddy won’t want his social stock to plummet. And I’m sorry, Malfoy, but I reckon you’re pants at sewing, even with magic.”
“Are you all right?” asked Draco. They were at the pub with a huge group of friends—even Parvati and Lavender, who didn’t seem to like them anymore and only hung out with muggles.
Draco licked a finger and dipped it delicately into the baggie. It came out coated in white powder. He rubbed it into his gums.
“What are you trying to get at, Andromeda?” burst out Harry. “You want to know how Malfoy is? I’ll tell you. He’s hard working, he lives in a lovely flat in London, he has friends who care about him, and he’s raised a thoughtful and compassionate child despite the odds. Is that what you want to know? Or do you want to unpack the war with someone who wasn’t even born when it happened?”
Draco took some Pepper-Up Potion and two paracetamol and settled himself in the chair next to her bed to watch over her in case she was sick in the night.
they gave Hermione a time-turner to do her lessons,” he said. “That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.”
Dean did up his jeans and stumbled back out of the bathroom, oblivious to Harry’s horrified expression.
Draco laughed, coldly and bitterly. He stood by the sitting room window, his forehead resting on the glass.
“What did you fuck up this time?” she asked, and suddenly Draco remembered that there was nothing to smile about.
Harry’s heart squeezed. He took the trolley with Scorpius’ trunk and owl and went through to the platform.
Draco seriously doubted that. Tasha, Fiona and Ellie had been nothing less than a blessing. He trusted them much more than he trusted Adelaide.
Draco and Timothy were sitting next to each other at the kitchen table. Draco said something in a low voice that made Timothy laugh, and Timothy pressed his forehead into Draco’s shoulder.
“‘Course,” said Harry. He wanted to grab Draco’s face and stare at it. He wanted to fix Draco into his brain. He wanted Draco to see himself the way Harry saw him: new, thrilling, full of potential. He couldn’t wait until Draco was forty. Fifty. Sixty. He couldn’t wait to see where Draco ended up, but Draco only wanted to end up at the bottom of a lake.
“Yeah, it’s that post-murder-attempt sex, I’m really getting antsy for it,” said Harry. Draco laughed, although he cut himself off with a solemn expression when his father glanced his way.
Some of the advice Draco gave himself under the guise of Narcissa was sinister, Machiavellian. But a lot of it seemed based on thoughtful observation of others. It emphasised the importance of patience, bravery, and consideration.
And Draco, who had organised it all, was nowhere to be found, not until the early hours of the morning, when people began to leave, and Harry found him washing up in the kitchen.
“Well, then,” said Draco, after a long, uncomfortable pause. “What the saviour wants, the saviour gets. I’ll become an animagus.”
“No,” said Kevin. “In fact, in one of our first sessions together, you told me that poster was irresponsibly stupid.”
“I mean,” said Ron, looking nonplussed, “he’s living with Luna. She’s been helping him get his act together. I’d say you should see them, but I know how you hate it when…”
Suddenly, an expression crossed Malfoy’s face that Harry recognised. It hadn’t been there when he was attacked in Diagon Alley, but it was there now: terror, the same terror Harry remembered seeing on Malfoy’s face in the Room of Requirement, as the world burned around them.
“Oh, for some wizards, it’s very clear,” said Ollivander. “Still unicorn hair, Mr Malfoy, but holly. Flexible.”
Adelaide leant into him, and Sebastian put his arm around her. It was a thin, wiry arm, not what she was used to. She had been handled by men, and it was strange, still, to be with a boy. He felt so much more breakable.
Harry didn’t say anything. He let his hands travel, flat-palmed, up and down Draco’s trembling back.
Harry watched hundreds of memories. Simple ones, of Draco cooking dinner and chiding Harry for not liking coriander, and funny ones, of Harry teasing Draco and Draco smirking as he took it, and uncomfortably arousing ones, of Draco bearing down on Harry like he was going to
“Why don’t you just visit him?” asked Hermione. “He can’t possibly curse you. He knows he owes you his life at least three times over.”
So it was decided. Draco would co-host the events as Lamorak Toujours, an Anglo-French wizard with party-planning know-how.
Harry watched the trial. He noticed what he had been too drunk to see at the time: the miserable resignation on Draco’s face when Harry balked at touching his Mark.
Harry wasn’t sure why he did it. It certainly wasn’t something he had planned on doing. But he reached up behind his head, took Draco’s hand, and squeezed it.
“Don’t call me that,” said Sebastian. He held out his hand. Adelaide swept a cool look over him before putting out her hand. “Sebastian.”
“Yeah,” he said. “I really think Draco is starting to settle. He seems happier, most of the time. I’d still like him to quit his job, but he doesn’t want to feel dependent, which makes sense. But we’ve been having a lot of fun together.”
Ron found him. Harry was still standing in front of the soundproof interrogation door. The room was spinning.
Cassie helped Harry pick out a simple pair of cufflinks, white gold. He had Draco’s initials engraved in them. It was amazing how fun shopping could be when you had a goal in mind. The goal, of course, being to render Draco speechless.
They were standing six inches apart. Potter looked furious. Draco didn’t know much about werewolves; he’d had a bit of a crush on Lupin in third year, but obviously he’d never told anyone about that, and had done his best to repress it at the time. Potter didn’t seem any different from how he’d always been: strong and lethal and too good looking by half.
lasted about a month. He startled at unexpected sounds. At random intervals, his hands would shake so badly he would have to step away from his desk rather than risk dropping a cursed object. He was plagued with dreams he hesitated to call nightmares, because they weren’t horrific, only guilt-inducing.
He was never going to sleep with Harry, he realised, as Blaise writhed beneath him, and the realisation was accompanied by a violent pain in his head. Blood dripped onto Blaise’s back.
“What,” said Potter. He looked tense, as if he was about to start punching something. But Draco knew he wouldn’t.
“I don’t want to come,” said Harry again. “I can’t believe you’re all going. Even you?” he asked Mrs. Weasley.
He stormed through the castle corridors, trying to outrun his thoughts, which tumbled after him like a poisonous flood, furious, endless, relentless, incurable. He didn’t want to die— did any suicide? But he wanted peace. He wanted it so badly he could taste it.
He flicked his wand at the record player and electronic music began to play. Instantly, Harry started to dance. It felt great, amazing, good. Draco poured out the coffee into the mug, drained it.
“It is,” said Harry, helping Draco settle himself back into the covers. He knelt at the bedside and stroked Draco’s soft, damp hair out of his face.
He wasn’t sure why it mattered, when before it hadn’t. He just knew it did. He was Harry Potter. He was supposed to be with Ginny Weasley. He was supposed to be a wonderful friend, a noble person, a hardworking, productive member of society. Sleeping with Draco Malfoy was an abject failure of the heroic ideal. It went against everything that was expected of him. It was a Bad Idea.
“I’ll make my peace with it over waffles,” said Draco. He leant slowly forward and kissed Harry again.
He wasn’t surprised at how much he cared. He had known for a while, really. Their strange, one-sided pen-pal relationship had grown important to Harry long ago.
Harry hadn’t been this drunk since those first few months after the war, when he would crawl into his bathtub every night after the trials and drink till he passed out.
“All right,” said Harry, slowly. “So Malfoy’s probably not worked here for about seven years. Does Mr. Croome stay in contact with his old… apprentices?”
The moment he walked in, he felt as if he had come home. It was an overwhelming feeling; like scent memory. The curtains were the right colour. The light streamed serenely through the diamond-paned windows.
“No, it’s not even that.” He paused. “It sounds so dramatic. They, uh, suggested, they implied, that I would be safer in the muggle world than the wizarding. Which has so far proven true. So.”
“He’s a bit mad, isn’t he?” Ron had said, after the first drinks night. Draco had monologued what amounted to a stand-up comedy routine about the disintegration of the NHS. It had been very funny, very distressing, and wholly inappropriate.
“I don’t know,” he said. “I still can’t quite believe it. It doesn’t seem fair that I get to have this, when good people died. But, for whatever reason, it’s what I’m getting. So… I love you.”
The magically modified morphine obliterated Draco’s pain. It also obliterated Draco. He drifted, glassy-eyed, through waking dreams, and scarcely seemed to notice when people spoke to him.
Draco shivered, but he was still smiling. He thought this might just be his face now: crazed with joy.
He felt Harry smile against his face, and realised he was probably squashing him. He slid off him, and they both turned onto their sides, facing each other.
Harry goggled at him, but the others just laughed, and Malfoy smirked as if he had made a good joke.
“Think I can do without that sort of care, myself,” said Harry, bitterly. It had come up in his throat, the bitterness. Unexpected, like bile. He stood.
Draco shrugged. Harry knew how nervous the idea must make him, but he also knew that Draco would have done anything to make Harry feel better.
“That’s okay,” said Draco, not taking his hands away from his face. “Let’s, uh, let’s talk later, is that all right.”
“That’s fine,” said Harry hastily. He did not particularly want to prolong time spent with this intense, elfish version of Draco Malfoy. He was still reeling from the shock of having disfigured him.
Harry put his hand on Draco’s elbow and steered him out of the library, down the corridor, and into their sitting room.
“I won’t ever make him choose between us, Weasley,” said Draco, leaning suddenly forward across the table. “You can treat me like shit every time we meet from here to fucking Judgment Day; I don’t care. I’ll still show up and be polite. That’s a fucking promise. Are
“You look,” started Harry, but then stopped himself, because he couldn’t describe how Draco looked in front of Ginny. It was decidedly too sexual.
“Morning,” he said, his eyes skitting nervously over Harry’s face. Harry was struck by a sudden loneliness. He didn’t know what Draco was thinking. If Draco knew what
“Magic,” said Draco glumly. He sat on the ground next to Seven and pulled his knees to his chest. “I only went and fucking fell in love with him, didn’t I?”
Malfoy never spoke about the past. He never had a session with Harry without making it sexual, even if Harry tried to guide them into more neutral territory (in fairness, Harry could never try that hard, because Malfoy was sex on legs). He got excited about geography and literature. The best way to get him to talk was to ask him what he was reading. He was inexorably cheerful, but sometimes Harry would say something that made him become abruptly guarded and distant, for instance, when Harry asked him about the Dark Mark.
“No fear,” said Draco, making a hasty exit. He and Harry ended up snogging against the fridge for the better part of an hour, until Fiona interrupted.
“Did Disgusting Sweaty Tim really ask you out?” asked Draco. “Doesn’t he understand you’re out of his league?”
“I’m going to take such good care of you,” said Harry, on the last breath he had under Draco’s crushing weight. Draco bent his head and kissed him.
“That’s,” said Draco. He had an ominous lump in his throat. “That’s as may be— thanks—but Potter… he. I just. I don’t think it’s possible.”
it wasn’t good enough, but Adelaide was recalcitrant, he doubted whether there was anything he could have done to—
“Wednesday. I was planning on making a Power Point.” Draco held his Bangladesh birth rates pie chart to his chest, his pulse throbbing.
“Merlin. No,” said Draco, although he couldn’t explain exactly why not. Something to do with embarrassment, and purity, and fear.
“I don’t know,” he said, finally. “He’s fucked, honestly. He’s stuck in his miserable little life, and when Cass goes to Hogwarts, he’s going to go stark raving mad. That’s if they don’t chuck him in prison for something he didn’t do, first.”
“I’m afraid you’ll have to put these back on me,” said Malfoy drily, waving his wrists. Cassie had somehow managed to pick the lock on his handcuffs in the few seconds before Spooner had seized her.
“Are you still feeling crave-y?” he asked, when it became apparent that Draco was neither going to look at him, nor speak.
“So tell the editor to fuck off,” said Harry, taking off his coat and hanging it on the hooks that Draco had put in by the front door.
“If you’re a bird animagus, you could always save yourself,” said Hermione. “It would be like a safety net.”
“Oh. Sorry. I shouldn’t have assumed,” said Harry, and went into the kitchen. Draco followed him a moment later. Lounged in the doorway; long, long legs and black jacket and sweeping hair.
“Fuck,” he muttered. He sank forward and kissed Draco again, more desperately even than before, then stepped away. “Sorry,” he said. Draco wasn’t sure what he was apologising for.
Andromeda and Mrs Weasley were sampling the cheese platter. Draco and Andromeda still avoided each other, although Harry knew it was because Andromeda felt guilty for having kept Teddy and Scorpius apart all those years. Draco, too, was overwhelmed by guilt about Teddy’s parents. Harry hoped they would get over it one day, but so far the best either of them could do was nod politely at each other before moving to opposite sides of the room.
“I’ll move out and never speak to them again,” said Draco. “It was the same deal with Neville. They behaved themselves. They understand threats.”
Harry noted the creepy use of the present tense. When he didn’t answer, Malfoy approached his bedside table.
“Isaac? Bastard. Draco really knows how to pick ‘em. First you, who made him feel worse than worthless, then me, who cheated on him nonstop for a year, then Isaac, who would get drunk and hex him. Mind you, Draco didn’t complain. He only broke up with him when Pansy and I pointed out that he might start on Cassie next.”
Draco could sense that it had mattered to Harry, and he was trying to divert Harry’s attention elsewhere, so they could get back to being friends. Harry remembered how quickly, how
Neville came up to Harry and Draco one afternoon at Blaise’s house. They were standing on the balcony, judging Blaise’s furniture.
It was unclear at what point the gathering tipped into being a party. Certainly Seamus showing up with a crate of firewhisky contributed to the change, but it was hard to point to a single moment. One minute it was just some eighth years lounging around in the Ravenclaw boys dormitory, the next, someone had procured a magical gramophone and Neville was doing a drunken striptease.
She laid something down on his knee, then quietly left the compartment. When he was sure she was gone, he glanced at his lap, and saw that she had left him her handkerchief.
“We’ll need to regrow the beams,” he said. “Then we’ll layer on the cladding—we’ll need to buy that—and finally we’ll add the slate. If we do it ourselves, it’ll cost a fraction of what it would to hire a magical engineer.”
Draco laughed and covered his face with his hands. The glamour had faded, and his right hand was gnarled again. Harry was struck by the strangest urge to delicately kiss each twisted knuckle.
Yet, he had also had the sense that Scorpius took care of Malfoy just as much as Malfoy took care of him. Harry had seen how disappointed they both had been that Malfoy couldn’t go with him to get Scorpius’ wand
“What is it, Potter?” he asked. Harry couldn’t answer. He didn’t have anything to say. He had just wanted to touch Draco, to let him know that he was there.
“Some ancestors of Slytherin’s,” said Draco. “It’s where Blaise and I used to go to get high, in fourth year.”
“You all right?” asked Harry. L nodded, but he didn’t relax. Harry moved up the bed to lie next to him. “You’re not all right.”
Malfoy leant against the doorframe. He never seemed to come into rooms, if he could hover at their edges instead.
Harry had gone away for the weekend—it was Ron’s stag-do. Draco had spent Friday evening determinedly
“What?” asked Goyle. Harry ignored him and swept the invisibility cloak over Goyle. He was so large, especially holding Narcissa, that there was no chance it would cover Malfoy as well.
remember. He had dreamt about them being killed by aurors, often— it had always been a comfort to wake and find his mother, sitting beside him. His dreams must have been real.
“He’s a bit, er, stuck in the past,” said Harry. “It’d be good for him to see that you’ve moved on, I think.”
The papers talked about Harry’s return to the world’s stage. People said he was destined to be the youngest Minister for Magic in centuries. (Hard to beat the Earl of Masserene, who was elected Minister for Magic in the 16th century at the tender age of eight.)
“You is not having had your afternoon tea, that is why,” said Misty. She picked up the broom and apparated them back to the kitchen, where she made him tea and egg cress sandwiches. She seemed to have entirely misunderstood what he meant by
“Yeah, I feel you. Me and my boyfriend broke up last year, it was rough. Have you been with anyone since?”
When Draco tried to get a job, Tertius put a reassuring hand on his shoulder, and told him he wanted a secretary, someone to help him run his business. (What business? Draco didn’t know, and he was so overwhelmed and grateful that he didn’t ask.) He told Draco there was no need for him to put himself through the agony of job applications as an ex-prison-convict Death Eater.
“I was just checking whether Aunt Andromeda had enough pasta to get through the winter,” said Draco, breezing past him. “Thankfully, she does. Well, I’d better be off, Pansy’s rented a barge on the Thames and I plan to drink myself into a stupor by half past ten. Cheerio.”
“Normal, right? Cookies. Well, she watched me eat one, with this crazed look in her eye, and then she said ‘I salted it with my tears,’ and told me that she’d been in love with me since I was a baby.”
“Of course, of course,” blustered Florian, but he looked at Scorpius with more interest than before, and added a chocolate flake to his sundae that Harry hadn’t paid for.
“Noted,” said Blaise, and changed the subject. But several hours later, when Harry was walking down the bright clean steps of Blaise’s townhouse, Blaise said,
“I don’t resent you,” said Harry. “Is that what you think? How can you ever relax around me if you think I secretly resent you?”
“No like, generally,” said Draco. “Last week, when you came downstairs with wet hair, and it was so black I thought it would drip ink….”
“I’m sorry,” Harry told Ron, when he went over to his and Hermione’s house afterwards to tell them what had happened.
“I don’t know. Probably she does on some level. I think everyone close to Blaise knows that he is betraying them in one way or another.”
. He didn’t use his wand, and Draco followed the movements of his hands with a distracted expression.
Then it occurred to Draco that Potter must have been following him ever since Draco left the dormitories. That Potter must have seen Draco climb into the window and look down. That he hadn’t done anything to stop it.
“She asked me if you were alive. I think she just wanted everything to be over so that you would be safe. Did she tell you any of this?”
And then the bathroom door banged open. Malfoy came striding out, gorgeous and sniffing conspicuously.
“If I wanted to learn how to make subpar boiled eggs, I would have done so by now,” said Draco. Harry rolled his eyes. He was so adorable when he was pissed off. Had he always been adorable when he was pissed off? Was that why Draco had antagonised him so much in school? But no— he used to be terrifying. Draco remembered the panic attacks.
“I don’t mean hate, like, they make you feel shit but you still fancy them. I mean, hate, as in, they represent everything you despise, but somehow you’re still worried about them, which is fucked up, because you should be worrying about the people they’re… hurting…”
“Hello, everyone,” said Draco, to the various aurors who were still pottering around his flat, putting up defences. “Thank you for not letting me get murdered.”
“He showed me your letter. Obviously I knew right away that Fledgeling had done it again, and that you hadn’t meant to send it, so I told him you were probably just pulling his leg. He said he might prank you back.”
“Draco…” Harry put his hands on Draco’s warm chest. He wanted to come in so badly. Draco’s gaze kept flickering to Harry’s mouth. “I don’t want to sleep with you until you trust me.”
She sidled over to the table and leant up against it, sitting on his notebook, her thighs exposed. She ran one finger up his chest. He grabbed her hand and shoved it away.
“Never mind,” said Draco. He couldn’t seem to fill up his lungs with enough air; not because of his ribs, but because he was breathing too deeply. He was still so astonished to be alive.
“Fair enough,” he said, finally. He broke eye contact to stare at the canal. A muscle in his jaw was going. “I’ll end up calling her again tonight, you know.”
Sam crumpled to the ground. So did Draco, smudging blood all down the wall. Harry rushed towards him, but Adelaide got there first.
“Uh, yeah,” said Harry, flooding with dread. Draco stood perfectly still and let Harry work the clasp. It was at the front of his throat, and Harry could feel his hot skin beneath his fingers.
They never touched. They both slept like logs, not moving, and Draco woke up each morning just as he had fallen asleep: as far away from Harry as he could get.
The explosion was nearer than usual, and he heard the Dark Lord’s high, shrieking curses, and he sat up in bed
They had sought forgiveness and then gone open-armed to death, leaving Draco behind in the emptiness. Had they lived, he would have forgiven them, eventually. Of course he would have. But he would have been allowed a few years to resent them, as he came to terms with the aftermath of the war. He would have been allowed to be a teenager, angry with his parents.
It was so quick and neat. Narcissa stepped in front of Malfoy without any fuss, as if she was standing up to collect an order from the counter of a coffee shop. She did not look frightened. She did not even seem to think or decide. She simply stepped in front of her son, was hit by the curse, and fell to the floor, dead.
“Hmm,” said Steven, tapping his fingers on the edge of the sink. He hadn’t hurt Draco yet, which made them both wary. “Still…”
“Potter,” said Draco. Harry looked around, trying to find the source. “Over here,” said Draco, popping his head out from under what was clearly Harry’s invisibility cloak.
When Adelaide slept over with people he trusted, as she had told him she was that night, Draco went out to clubs and bars. People touched him there, kissed him, sometimes. Once, he had gone home with a man, but when they arrived at his flat Draco had abruptly understood he couldn’t go through with it, and left, and never tried again. But he still went out, because Muggle girls smiled at him, and Muggle boys danced with him, and for those meagre hours he felt young again.
“You could do worse than learn from Draco, Harry,” said Andromeda, once they were gone. “You need to get out of your comfort zone.”
in half a day. It ended on a cliff hanger. He shut the book with gusto and Malfoy glanced up. They were both in the living room. Malfoy seemed to do nothing all day but pour over
He still wouldn’t talk about the break up. They had run into Neville when Dean and Seamus insisted that they all go to a new bar opening. Neville had gone to almost comical lengths to avoid talking to Harry, but he and Draco spent a cordial ten minutes together, and Draco came away from the encounter looking thoughtful and calmer than usual.
“If I tell you, you have to promise you won’t, you won’t try to, to report me or—or to get her taken away from me,” he said.
“Oh, God,” said Draco, starting to cry in earnest now, but he rifled through the cupboards until he found a tea caddy. He put the kettle on.
“We don’t,” agreed Harry. “It would be so much easier for us to love other people. But I don’t want something easier. I want
So they all turned back into birds. The compressing, the shrinking of his mind. The clarity of wings and of wind.
“Let’s go back to the room,” said Harry firmly. Draco nodded and fumbled to pack his things into his bag. Harry ended up doing it for him.
Still, when Draco brought him cups of tea and asked him thoughtful questions about his day, Harry sometimes looked at him as if—
“Is that the full extent of any illegal or inappropriate activities?” asked Harry. He put his hand on Draco’s knee and stroked it, trying to reassure him. Draco didn’t seem to notice.
Draco glumly chewed his lentils. That was the difficulty with having a psycho murder-terrorist for a father. No one understood why it was sad when he died.
“Oh, thank God,” said Harry. He closed the gap between them in two strides, seized Draco’s face, and pulled him into a furious, open-mouthed kiss.
Harry went back to Grimmauld Place, which now appeared to have a vast and perfectly curated front lawn, and went to bed, determinedly not thinking about Draco sodding Malfoy.
Such tiny little movements in Draco’s face. Harry understood none of them, only that they meant Draco was thinking, that Draco didn’t know what he thought.
“Oh, shit, sorry. Yeah. Uh, if your life is in danger you can do anything you need to save yourself.”
“No,” said Draco, frowning. “He wouldn’t do something like that. He’s insufferable, but…” he drifted off into thought. “Decent. He’s very decent. At least, he
“Ron reckons you’re in some weird Malfoy spiral since you ran into him at the Aurors’,” said Ginny, lounging against the piano.
“I’m just going to get a glass of water,” said Harry. For once, Draco didn’t try to keep him. He didn’t seem to even notice Harry, in fact. His eyes were fixed on Goyle. He looked more vulnerable than Harry had ever seen him, and Goyle seemed to be experiencing some equally complicated emotion, looking at Draco. He approached the bed as Harry went to the door, and knelt before it.
“You is choosing the colours for the next room, sir,” said Misty. But when he chose the kitchen colours (green and blue), he soon found that she was a) completely ignoring him and b) right to do so. The pale blue and yellow kitchen, when it was done, was soothing and cheerful.
Harry told the first part of the year easily enough; the first two tasks. But when he came to the third task, he slowed.
The house was huge. He opened door after door, getting progressively higher, and soon he couldn’t hear the sounds of the party at all. He was lost. He was alone. He opened a door, and Draco Malfoy was sitting on the window seat of a pretty blue bedroom, smoking a cigarette through the open window.
Draco leant his hips against the hob, his head against the extractor fan. Harry approached slowly, slowly. Put down his tea. Put one hand on Draco’s shoulder blade.
He couldn’t put words to his thoughts. He only knew that there wasn’t space in his head for them. It felt as if the only way to make space would be to bash his skull open against a wall.
Harry sat up. It was light. Harry’s back ached from the lumpy mattress. Draco lay on his side, his expression open and focused.
“He does think you’re a good person,” said Harry. “Although I think you were right, anyway; people aren’t good or bad, like that.”
Their mouths were so close. He kissed Draco on the nose, because he had to kiss him somewhere or he would go crazy. Draco blinked, blushed, and tucked his head down into Harry’s chest.
Draco wasn’t looking at him. Harry leant his elbow on the counter. He kept getting distracted by remembering that he had been

“You know, whatever I did, there’s no need for you to be such a twat about it. I’m obviously sorry to have disgusted you so much or whatever, you don’t need to act like—”
“Let’s see if it worked,” said Steven. “Draco, say ‘I’m a piece of shit and everyone wishes I were dead.’”
Occasionally Harry would overhear Malfoy telling Ron some absurd lie about muggle culture, and he would have to intervene.
“I know you didn’t, you inept git,” he said, as Draco tried to get away from him. “Merlin, I thought Harry was crazy at first, but you’re all right, aren’t you?”
“Think of all those lucky dogs,” she said. “Although maybe they won’t get anything until my grandmother dies. How much money does a dog need, anyway? I don’t really like animals. Snakes are all right. Is it true you can talk to snakes? I wonder how he died. It was in the obituaries, I suppose. I never bother reading those, except for the names; the names can be quite funny sometimes. Do you like dogs? You didn’t know your grandparents, either. Uncle Blaise’s grandfather sends him newspaper clippings whenever Blaise is in the papers. I wonder if my grandparents read the newspapers. They would have seen pictures of me, if they did, wouldn’t they?”
Ron and Seamus tried to muffle their laughter, but Harry didn’t feel like laughing. It wasn’t exactly that he was turned on by the sight of a guy in a skirt (or was it…?)— it was more that it so obviously signalled that Malfoy would do whatever Harry told him to do.
Sure, Draco flirted with him. Draco was physically affectionate. Draco touched him as if Harry was important to him. Draco hadn’t seemed to dislike that kiss in the pub. But that didn’t mean Draco fancied him, and Harry had no right to be angry or upset or hurt.
Draco was deeply demoralised by Potter’s visit. He knew quite well what it signified: that Potter had his doubts about Draco evading Azkaban.
Seamus moved back into his old flat pretty soon after Harry and Draco started dating, even though Draco only slept at Harry’s three nights a week. Draco spent most of his time at the manor with his parents. He and Harry texted constantly. Harry knew he wasn’t the first person Draco tended to call when he was upset about Lucius—knew Draco went to Blaise and Pansy first, or to Theo. But when Harry asked him point blank, Draco was always honest.
Harry was struck with guilt that he hadn’t checked with Malfoy before he brought Cassie to visit. Malfoy was fiddling nervously with the edges of his rumpled shirtsleeves.
So Harry kissed Draco’s neck, and Draco steered. Draco flew low and slowly through the cool morning mist.
It was nice thinking that people could be redeemed. It gave Harry a warm, glowing feeling. Although most things gave him that feeling, now: a feeling of newness, of spring, of awakening.
“I’m nothing like Malfoy,” he said, but now all he could think of was Malfoy bending over him, slow and gentle on the sofa—completely breaking with all that came before. Sweet and careful. And then the expression on his face when he was done; or more precisely, the lack of expression. What was his
“You’re hopeless at business, Timothy,” said the man, in a way that made Harry abruptly uncomfortable. A moment later, Harry knew why. “You’re lucky you’ve got me to take care of you.” Croome took Timothy’s chin in one beefy hand and moved it this way and that. “Aren’t you?”
When Harry’s hair had been rinsed clean, Draco began to lather his body with slow, attentive strokes.
Harry took a tentative step forward. When L didn’t back away, Harry wrapped his arms around him and held him as tightly as he possibly could.
pureblood wizards, and the circumstances have to be just right—” She trailed off. “Oh,” she said. “Poor Malfoy.”
If it was strange having Malfoy in his house, it was even stranger going out in public with him. News of the prisoner’s bond had evidently trickled out, and people openly stared at them. Malfoy ignored everyone, although he kept glancing at Harry in a way that he evidently thought was subtle.
“Well, no offence, mate, but he puts himself out there, you know?” said Ron. It was the second Tuesday of the month. They were eating bagels.
Draco looked at him. Harry remembered watching him torture Rowle. Remembered his face appearing in the window of Hagrid’s cabin in first year, and knowing they had to get Norbit away
Harry had not intended to move into Malfoy’s’s house. (He couldn’t think of it as his own old house.) He had been so sure that he wouldn’t move in, in fact, that he had met up with the real estate agent Malfoy had hired to sell it.
“Or maybe it was a dream,” said Harry. “I don’t know. I wanted to ask you. I know I should have waited.”
“I didn’t know what it did,” said Harry, trying to explain. That he hadn’t meant for Draco to be an enemy; not a real one.
“I appreciate it, professor,” said Draco, desperate to get away. McGonagall smiled at him and opened the door. Draco stopped himself from breaking out into a run as he raced towards the astronomy tower.
Harry held Scorpius’ hand tightly as he fought his way through crowds of interested well-wishers in the atrium.
“I’m not,” said Harry. “I’m just looking for my friend. Where do Mr. Croome’s apprentices go, after their time with him ends?”
The coffin was empty as they lowered it into the ground. Harry’s body was still missing. Draco remembered the way Harry had grinned at him above his champagne glass, and felt, bizarrely, as if he was reading a very sad book, rather than living his own very sad life.
“Can we,” said Draco. There was a lovely, citrusy smell that Harry was somehow certain was Draco’s hair.
He had never been clubbing in Britain. It was different; much more formal, somehow. He had to Confund the bouncer to be let in, a single man in jeans. Unlike in LA, all the girls wore heels and full faces of makeup. Harry stood on the dance floor and let the music pound through him, beating in his blood.
“So these… memes… all the muggles read them?” asked Ron, clearly utterly baffled by the direction the conversation had taken.
When he arrived at their coffee shop the next day, it was unexpectedly busy. Lamorak was leaning against a counter, scanning for a table. There wasn’t one.
He remembered resisting the imperius curse in Mad Eye Moody’s classroom. It was like that? Draco kissed the tops of Harry’s paws. It felt good to purr, it felt simple. Mad Eye Moody hadn’t been Mad Eye Moody, anyway, and Dumbledore hadn’t been who Harry thought he was when he was a child and Dumbledore seemed like God, and Harry wasn’t Harry anymore—
Draco didn’t say anything. He just listened. Harry didn’t know what he was thinking, he only knew that Draco hadn’t left.
“Fuck you,” she said, when he had got her awake (there was a terrifying moment when he thought she was dead, and she looked so young, he knew she was eighteen but sometimes she looked more like
“Ah,” said Harry, laughing, a kind of exclamation of delight. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to say it for the first time like that, it just sort of slipped out.”
Malfoy nodded a greeting, then turned steadfastly back to his books. Ginny looked at Malfoy, then back at Harry with a questioning look.
“None of them can look after him,” he explained one day, over a half-hearted game of air hockey. “Goyle’s got all the insight of a pot plant. Pansy—” his breath hitched.
“—and I thought, well, that makes sense, he’s always seen more clearly than everyone else, he knows that I’m…” he stopped for a moment, as if he couldn’t find the right word, then seemed to give up the search. “Then Neville asked me out. He always knew I fancied you. He’s perceptive, you know? It definitely fucked with him. He has a bit of a complex about you.”
Draco started putting a strand of his hair in Harry’s weekly potion, which helped, but didn’t stop Harry from waking up in the night, alone and lonely and frightened.
“You could read these?” asked Harry, surprised, because the insurance policy L had filled out included personal information. The Mysteries charm generally blanked out things like that, just as it prevented Harry from actually knowing what L looked like. Harry could see bits of him at times, when he was looking straight at him. He knew he had seen L’s eyes before, although he couldn’t remember them. They stared at each other enough, and sometimes, as Harry’s gaze flickered across L’s face, he felt as if he was on the verge of understanding something. But he never did. L’s features vanished like a dream the moment Harry looked away.
So Draco waited, as Clarence took him to an incredibly expensive restaurant, for Clarence to ask him about himself. He never did. He was complimentary about Draco; he ordered for him, he paid. But he didn’t seem to have any interest in finding out more.
“I know you didn’t,” said Harry. “Breathe. I haven’t got you anything, either. But…” he tilted his head back against the headboard, raising his eyes to the canopy. “I was thinking, I could help you with the Manor.”
“I’ve done something that’s going to piss you off,” Harry told Draco, that afternoon. Draco was leaning against the kitchen counter as Harry filled the kettle.
