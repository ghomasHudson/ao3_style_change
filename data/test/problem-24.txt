Harry Potter loves Draco Malfoy, but Draco adores one special piece of jewelry that he didn't know Harry knew about.
He spotted a chair next to a door that most likely led into the bathroom, and carried it to Harry’s bedside. He didn’t want to leave him alone just now, mostly for his own sake. He had spent the last year without any information on where he was or how he was. He hadn’t wanted to know where he was, as if he knew, it would have been a risk for both of their safeties.
. This party was being held in honour of him; it was impossible, if not disrespectful of him if he would have just stayed at home.
, they would’ve been killed almost instantly. No, he hadn’t blamed his parents, still didn’t. The real reason behind this terror and pain was the remains of a man at the very top, someone who declared a boy of sixteen-years-old his mortal enemy.
“Draco, shut up.”
Forcing his knees to not give in, he filled his mind with happy thoughts as he made his hesitant way over to where the man who wanted to destroy the whole world stood. It was time to make a decision. He could feel it.
wrong. She needed to find him.
“Nothing!” he exclaimed a bit too quickly. Draco raised his eyebrows sceptically, waiting for the common sense of his opposite to kick in. “Well, not nothing, but everything is fine now. They are fine, I mean. Well....”
She frowned. Next to her, Dean glanced up from his spot on the ground. He had somehow managed to lie down on the floor, press his cheek onto the cold and dusty stone floor and tried to sneak a glance through the small space in between the ground and the door. Ginny huffed.
Enjoy!
“Wake up, Draco, breakfast is ready.”
“Why do you think I would do that?” Staring straight into the blue eyes of his headmaster, he raised one eyebrow and bit back a scowl as said man took his time to take a sip of his tea, adjust his glasses and take a deep breath before gracing him with an answer. Harry frowned.
“Do you know how they did that to you?” Deep green eyes studied him closely as the Malfoy heir swallowed.
right
He hadn’t been strong enough to choose when he should have, but he sure as hell would be strong enough to choose when he needed to, and that moment was now!
words, Hermione. Not mine. And now you’re telling me that you lied all along? That although I have fulfilled what Voldemort and the entire Wizarding World thought to be my duty, I have to still do whatever the important and influential people need me to do because no-one else will do it?”
"I've had little constants in my life and one of them was you. I have had a lot of time to think after the war and I-" Malfoy's pink lips were moving, but Harry couldn't hear a word. Every once in a while the blond wizard's tongue tip would move to wet these soft-looking lips, leaving behind a trail of glistening beauty. Harry swallowed and bit his lower lip. What would they feel like if he would just… move… now…
He positioned himself at the foot of his lover’s bed, unable to touch any part of him but perfectly able to look him in the eyes, to keep himself grounded. “You don’t need to protect me. I don’t
He turned left and stopped dead.
And his father's broken watch made him draw the obvious conclusion.
Draco had promised he'd be here at 6 pm sharp. He had even told him to be presentable then because he wouldn't be waiting for him to get dressed. Had something happened to him? Had he been delayed at work and couldn't make it in time?
“Harry! Did I wake you?” The blond hurried back to the Gryffindor’s bedsite, and crouched down next to him.
This was the answer he had been looking for. It didn't make it any less painful, however, but deep inside he knew this was right. What Draco and he had had… it was long gone. He still felt love for him, yes, but there was more to a relationship than a feeling that wouldn't be enough to keep it going—to keep
He hated the thought, but he had been one of those people. He had been too scared to do anything but follow. He hadn’t wanted to, but he had done it either way. It didn’t matter that he told himself he’d only done it to protect his family. That was just a way to justify what he had done or helped doing.
"Actually, no. A friend recommended a location to me and I thought it fitted quite well," Draco smiled at the black-haired wizard in front of him and offered his arm. "Shall we?"
“Mr Potter, there you are. I’ve been looking for you everywhere,” Harry whirled around and stared into the plain face of the blonde woman he had ‘met’ while on stage. She raised a very thin and unnatural looking eyebrow and eyed the bottle of whiskey in Harry’s hand.
Hermione’s eyebrows shot up. Blaise winced.
Enjoy :D
Until next time - see ya! :D
“Shh, it’s alright,” Draco whispered and kissed the top of his unruly hair, sniffling a bit as the stubborn strands tickled his nose. “You can tell me. I’ll behave.”
Harry sighed, suddenly feeling exhausted. "This isn't about my dad's watch, Draco, this is about you. You need to decide whether this," he waved the hand holding the watch around the room, "is worth it for you to change, because if it isn't, then you should just tell me. I can't and won't spend the rest of my days wondering whether you're just unreliable or using me because you don't want to be alone. It's not a nice feeling."
Harry clutched his fingers together and tried to think of a way to say what he had wanted to say for the last few weeks now. Ever since that one meeting in Diagon Alley where he had seen Draco wander through the shops and had come to chat with him, he had wanted to tell him that there was something different in him. He… he wasn’t even sure what it was, but he somehow knew that it would all be alright if he’d just confide in Draco. He swallowed and summoned his courage. They were alone, away from all those glances and, in Draco’s case, glares and nobody would interrupt them.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Getting the hell out of here,” he replied, glancing over his shoulder and fastening his pace. He turned around a corner and let himself fall onto the nearest bench. “Sorry ‘bout that,” he mumbled as Draco blinked at him owlishly. “Skeeter was on her way towards us and I don’t have the nerve to deal with her just now.”
Harry raised an eyebrow at him but didn’t say anything.
He couldn’t believe that he was still alive. Trembling all over and still gasping in pain, but breathing nonetheless. Not many people could say that once they’d disrespected the Dark Lord.
, so it was now
He knew everything. No, not everything, he thought desperately. An image of a laughing black-haired boy filled his mind. He would be dead if Voldemort found out.
Shaking his head, Draco watched as relief lightened the blond woman’s face. “No, nothing bad happened. But I do have something that I need to tell you. You and –“
He laughed awkwardly and put it back down. Clearing his throat, he tried to smile pleasantly at the annoying woman. “Well, I guess you’ve found me,” he chuckled weakly and gulped as the woman started laughing hysterically. It reminded him painfully of Aunt Petunia’s laugh when Uncle Vernon’s boss and his wife had been over for dinner.
the right thing, and it had felt amazing.
“There he is! Finally! Merlin, he is too late!”
“What took you so long?” he asked, but Remus ignored him and walked past him towards the still screaming portrait. With practiced motions, he pulled the curtains shut and motioned the three younger wizards to follow him into the kitchen.
"Then don't." His voice was barely above a whisper, trembling ever so slightly, but he didn't care. He had to make sure that the one good thing in his life was safe and would stay safe. He wouldn't be able to live with himself otherwise. He tried to keep the tears from falling out of his storm grey eyes, but he couldn't.
He smiled shakily and waved him off. "It's okay, I'm used to-"
He sniffed and allowed the tears to fall freely. His vision blurred and the image of the broken glass once protecting the intricate design of the watch's dial warped in front of his eyes. The orbs that had been spinning merrily as he had handed the watch over into Draco's care lay in between the still hands, equally unmoving.
A hectic look towards the clock hanging on the wall made him curse. Draco would be there in twenty minutes for date night and Harry still needed to change and—he lifted his left arm and sniffed. Okay, first and foremost—he needed a shower. Desperately.
, so be there at seven tonight to get some shots." Draco rolled his eyes as Pansy squealed and threw her arms around his neck.
Confused, Harry took a deep breath, took Malfoy's arm and was sucked into nothingness.
“The boys’ dorms are on the left side, so just take the left set of stairs and look for the seventh year dorm,” Hermione smiled at him and motioned him inside. “I’ll go back down. You now know the password, so you can come back whenever you like.”
The tousle-haired wizard had made it a habit to tell everyone he met that Draco had changed and wasn’t to be hold responsible for his parents’ actions. Upon the reply that
had indeed been a Death Eater himself, bearing the Mark and all, he had merely said that the consequences of not acting after his parents’ wish would have been even worse. Since Draco had never actually killed anybody, and had only tortured people while at the wrong end of Voldemort’s wand, he was not to be called responsible for his actions during the war. Having saved the Golden Boy’s life certainly helped with that request, which Harry had mentioned more than once.
The blond jumped slightly as the surprisingly strict voice hit his eardrums. He turned his head and stared at the anything but amused-looking saviour of the wizarding world, gobsmacked.
"You paid for bodyguards?" Harry gaped at the wizard in front of him who looked like it was the most ordinary thing to do when dealing with
"Get Draco and get out of here. I'll manage to hold them off for a while until you've brought him to safety."
“I know that,” he sniffed as he glanced at the irritated looking owl on our kitchen table.
Draco groaned softly, and pressed the golden satin pillow he had grabbed off of the couch onto his arm.
. The walls were made of a really dark wood he had no idea whatsoever what it was called, the floor was out of a softer toned wood and the furniture looked both old and extremely expensive. As he eyed a nearby table he wasn't so sure that it would stay intact if he was to put a wand onto its surface, but he didn't want to try his luck.
“Lucius-“ His mother put a hand on his shoulder as she tried to calm her husband down, but he wouldn’t have any of it.
He'd heard people talk about relationships like his and Draco's. He'd been in denial at first, saying that wasn't how his relationship with Draco was. What they had was special, after all. But even he had to admit, after being disappointed time and time again, that something was wrong.
This one is rather old. It's from the second Season of QLFC on FFN, so there might be a few mistakes in there somewhere.

Until next time - see ya :D
“Say something.” The softly spoken words ripped him back into the present in which he sat on a soft couch, cradling the person he loved the most in his arms whilst being warmed by the flickering fire.
Blaise sighed in relief. “Yeah. Let’s hope you’re right about –“
Harry sighed and lowered his face into his hands just as Draco let himself sink into the soft cushions next to him. An arm wrapped itself around his shoulders, holding him gently but tightly as his lover bent towards him and pressed his velvet lips onto his pale cheek.
“I have found someone I plan to spend the rest of my life with.”
“I won’t do it.”
Torches bathed the dungeons in an eerie light, making shadows more pronounced and threatening. Cloaked figures framed the hallway as the two Malfoys walked calmly towards a metal door that was guarded by another two cloaked and masked figures.
He couldn’t help himself as he leaned forward and reached out to brush two fingers over Harry’s dirty cheek. The skin was still as soft as he remembered it.
Draco’s lips twitched slightly as a smile tried to creep onto his face. Without thinking, his brain gave his left arm the command to rise off the cool blanket, lift over the unconscious wizard next to him and run his fingers through his messy hair, but a sharp jab of intense pain made him gasp in shock and immediately regret his decision to move. He winced as his lover twitched and slowly turned his head to look at the sheepishly smiling pureblood.
charm – ten minutes ago. He rolled his eyes and sighed. He was already too late anyway.
Blaise looked at her incredulously as if she had lost her mind. “I would remember if it had been going on for longer than that.”
Harry’s sparkling green eyes appeared in front of my grumbling face. He winked at me, kissed my cheek and stole my blanket.
“You will join me and the Headmaster in a serious conversation about your behaviour, Mr. Malfoy!”
“I’ve been in Dumbledore’s office,” he murmured and started playing with a button on his boyfriend’s shirt.
Imagination and laughter had quickly turned into reality and nightmares. The screams from the Dark Lord’s victims still echoed in his head as he tried to fall asleep, knowing fully well that just a few floors below him, his father’s companions all had met up to get ready for the next summoning.
look she absolutely loved. More innocent people would say he looked as if he'd just climbed off of his broom after hours of flying around but she preferred her description of what she saw and Draco seemed to agree with her as she saw his pale cheeks darken slightly with a lovely pink colour as he watched Harry mess up his hair.
*~*DMHP*~*
“Stuff it, filth,” Lucius hissed, and shot a cutting curse straight at her face. The jinx cut into her skin, causing her to yelp in pain. The other brainless morons chuckled, amused at the show they were getting.
Without deeming the two confused Slytherins another glance, Ginny cursed loudly, turned on the spot, and started sprinting out of the library, hoping against all hope that she had not just lost a friend.
“There you are!”
“Not helping, Blaise,” Draco hissed through clenched teeth, only succeeding in making his friend snicker merrily. He found this whole disaster absolutely hilarious since he had been freed of Draco’s obsessiveness. That though, he had to admit, had scared the shit out of him.
First, Harry’s over enthusiastic behaviour after such a wonderful and special night like the last one and now
But as the hands on the clock hit 6 pm and crept on further towards 7 pm, Harry's excitement slowly ebbed away. Absent-mindedly, he fumbled with the hem of his shirt, his eyes never leaving the clock or the door for longer than a few seconds at a time.
Harry didn’t understand what was going on. People kept snickering when he walked past, pointing at him and whispering behind their hands so he wouldn’t hear what they were talking about. He was used to being in the centre of attention, but this was annoyingly much, even for his standards.
The bright green eyes behind the round spectacles narrowed dangerously as they watched every single student climbing up the stairs from the dungeon. As the last two – Crabbe and Goyle – shot him death glares, he knew something wasn’t right.
He felt his eyes tingle and lowered his gaze towards his folded hands in his lap. He didn’t know how to… how to react. It was obvious that his father wasn’t taking it very well. He knew what all of this meant for the Malfoy name. He knew men weren’t able to become pregnant – at least not yet. The research in the potion department wasn’t being still – they still looked for a method to allow wizards to carry biological children, but he knew that it would be years, hell, probably decades until they had a breakthrough! He worked for that freaking department, damn it!
he thought grimly and decided that until he had found his favourite rock to hang onto, he could as well down all of his sorrow with some expensive alcohol, and made towards the bar in search of something that would make him feel numb to all those glares and hisses.
Slowly he turned the knob and opened the door. It had been oiled recently, as it wasn’t creaking. Silently, he thanked the elves responsible for that bit of foresight.
“Now, would someone please obliviate me, so I can forgot this bloody embarrassing disaster the whole school is gossiping and laughing about?”
It was a cold autumn day. Leaves were turning orange, falling off the trees in the Forbidden Forest to cover the ground in gold, and the atmosphere within the castle was changing along with the weather. The younger years had started to get excited, anticipating Hallow’s Eve and its famous feast. Hagrid had started dragging pumpkins over the grounds, collecting leaves and twigs along the way.
“Yes, yes, yes, I have heard you alright, young lady, calm down. I’m not as fast as I used to be, you know? Not getting any younger here, I’m afraid.”
. If the Death Eaters had really caught Harry Potter, the world would have found out within five minutes.
I didn’t even understand my own thoughts anymore. “What does it say?”
Hermione gasped as she stared at the old – and now ruined – book.
After his defeat of Voldemort, girls and boys alike – no matter what age – had followed him everywhere. He had not been able to walk through Diagon Alley at the start of term to get his school supplies – he had to apparate out of there quickly in order to escape the screaming mop of people, some of whom actually fainted as they caught sight of him. Some Order members had to complete his shopping for him. It had been incredibly embarrassing!
, under any circumstances, allow Harry of all people to stick by him and die just like he would.
Draco reached his right hand out to Harry’s trembling ones as he heard the unmistakable sound of a sniffle. The black-haired wizard intertwined their fingers and ran his thumb over the soft, pale skin of his lover’s hand. A sad smile graced his features as he met the blond’s loving gaze.
Theodore Nott leant against the wall and scrutinised the blond intently. “Well, do you like him? I mean, if you’ve been nice to him...”
The couple quickly waved their wands in the same fashion, bewitching their friends to float next to them. A freckled hand grabbed Harry's, a tanned one grabbed Draco's, and they started to run. Shouts echoed through the woods on their right, jumping off of the trees and the manor's stone walls. They had found them. Curses of different colour shot past them, some a mere few centimetres away from their limbs as they ran as quickly as they could to where they knew the grounds' gates were located.
“What is it they want now?” I sighed as I dropped the blanket next to my chair and strolled over to Harry’s side, who had just shooed the rude owl out of the kitchen window. I had done my duties in charity and social work, just like the Wizengamot had told me to right after the war. That’s what father was good for – steal the last of my free time. He even managed that while rotting in prison.
They came to a stop in front of a tall, empty painting. The canvas showed an Italian landscape with sunny hills, trees and some sort of building.
I hope you liked that! I just love clumsy!Draco! :D He's too adorable :)
doing here?" His dark eyebrows drew together as he watched Draco fidgeting and Parkinson nearly bouncing up and down with… His eyes zoned in on the camera.
“Hermione,” a soft voice whispered behind her and she saw dark hands wrap around her wrists as she reached for the pile of parchment that had once been a century old tome about the art of potion making.
Draco gets a letter from the Ministry of Magic. But it isn't the normal 'I was a Death Eater and have to pay'-letter...
He pushed his hands through his disastrous hair and sneaked another gaze out of the window. It was looking over a street framed by big trees. On sunny days it was a beautiful view, but with the rain that was pouring out of the sky, it was nothing less but creepy and looked as if it was picked right out of a horror film.
He stared at his former enemy. “What do you mean?”
Harry needed to know.
"I think it's broken," Harry ground out through clenched teeth as he tried to out weight on it carefully. Pain shot through his whole side, pulling a pained gasp out of him.
Harry raised his head slowly and zoned his eyes in on mine. His brilliant green gaze caused tingles to shoot through my body so abruptly that I winced.
But seeing the wizards and witched of the British community glaring at him and whispering behind his back didn’t help his nerves. His fingers clutched desperately at the glass in his hands, the golden brown liquid inside spilled over the rim, wetting his trembling fingers.
. Draco gulped as he felt a promising twitch in his trousers. He exhaled shakily. "I'm never going to survive this," he whimpered and hurried over to the wine cabinet to select one of the finest wines he had to offer. "Never."
Light steps echoed through the hallway leading to his room and made him freeze. What seemed like an eternity later, his breath hitched as knuckles knocked against his door, whose handle was immediately being pushed down. In a panicked second, wild storm grey eyes searched for a way he could prevent what was now about to happen. His breathing was shallow and too quickly, his heart beat so strongly as if it wanted to escape the prison of his ribcage. A fleeting moment, he seriously thought about wrenching the window open and jumping out of his third storey room because death would surely be preferred over the alternative.
Harry turned abruptly and hurried down the hall. Ginny could hear soft sniffling following him.
With a loud pop, a small female house elf appeared in front of his mother, bowed slightly and looked up at her with huge, watery eyes. “Mistress called Limpy, Ma’am?”
She raised her head and looked me in the eye. It took all of my strength and all of the strange heat radiating from Harry’s hand to not flinch away from her. “Everything’s going to be okay. It’s just a formality they have to complete before you can continue with your life like you used to.” Was that a smile on her face? I gulped. That was even more frightening than the death glares she usually sent my way.
A sigh could be heard through the door and a soft thud as the person leaned against the wall across from them. He didn’t know who they were but according to Ginny’s excited, whispered descriptions she was very happy with what she was witnessing...
Harry took a deep breath and pulled out his Invisibility Cloak. His thoughts were whirling through his head. He had to focus! Why was he so scared? He fought bloody Voldemort and lived to tell the tale, for Merlin’s sake! Multiple times! He wasn’t one who worried about what could happen! He was someone who stormed into the situation at hand and improvised!
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry looked over his shoulder and sighed with relief as he saw non-other than Draco Malfoy walk towards them, an empty glass in his hand and looking adorably confused. Harry’s blush deepened as he noticed that Emily Ackland’s hand was still clutching his like it was some kind of extra slippery fish that needed to be contained.
I flinched, trying to - unsuccessfully - wrench the blanket in front of my sore eyes. “
Harry kept talking and talking. He had stopped listening a while ago. The bright green of his eyes kept glancing down, the lids lowered, the pupils widened… And that was when he felt them; those beautifully soft lips on his own.
Harry watched a pack of witches move past them, glancing over their shoulder and giggling, some were even winking at Harry. He winced.
Ron cocked his head. “What do you mean?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Can’t he at least say that he wasn’t that badly injured?” Hermione asked.
“Have you told anyone?”
“I think the best we can do is try to talk to the Minister,” Draco said. “If my father is there, then so be it. I’ll explain that… I don’t know, me and the beast had a magical connection, or something.”
Without the Marauder's Map, Harry was unable to sneak out to Hogsmeade with Draco, and their time together was spent in a quiet corner or, as the weather got nicer, a secluded area outside. Now that they were more comfortable with each other, being boyfriends after all, they could only be paranoid over anyone finding them. Four people knowing seemed too many, and Harry appreciated Draco’s initial anxiety over Hermione and Ron once Pansy and Blaise knew.
“I’m aware.” It didn’t much matter to him. He’d likely be in his room. “Are you going?”
“Exactly.” There was silence and Draco wondered if he should come in, but then he heard Lupin continue. “Alright, you don’t have to be his friend. Just try to be nicer to him. Or, at the very least, don’t get into fist fights in the middle of the Great Hall.”
Speaking of Draco, he really had placed three galleons on Ravenclaw winning, and promised to take Harry out somewhere if Ravenclaw did indeed win. “If Gryffindor wins, you aren’t getting anything,” Harry said.
“It is?”
Seeing that there would be no conversation continuing between the two, Lupin said, “Right, well, the grindylow tanks need cleaning. I’ve already removed them, so the both of you will be able to handle it. Oh, and you can’t use magic. You’ll have to do it by hand.”
“Blaise,” Draco warned.
“You know what?” Harry said loudly, seeing them both reach for their wands. “I’m gonna go somewhere alone with my boyfriend!”
Ron looked shocked, but covered it by taking a bit of his food and saying, “Well, alright then,” through a mouthful of toast.
“You're just letting it slide because of the Grim. Honestly, out of all the insane omens-”
“Bless you,” Ron said. Trelawney’s fun as an oddity to giggle at had worn off long ago, and Hermione’s outburst in class was the most worthwhile thing to have happened so far.
So he spent weeks feeling nauseous and despondent, regretting as a day passed by and brought him closer to the inevitable loss of the match. He got no further in the dementor lessons, too constantly upset to conjure a happy memory.
With his thumb repaired, Draco sat in Defense Against the Dark Arts. “Good morning everyone,” Professor Lupin said. Draco could not believe this man got hired to teach. His robes looked older than any Hogwarts student. His hair was graying and long in a messy way, and scars criss crossed his face. He didn’t look rugged, nor did he look scary. He just looked rumpled. Rumpled and sad.
Draco grabbed the front of Harry’s shirt and pulled him into a deep kiss. He fell onto Draco, who was half on the snow and grass and half engulfed by the cloak. They were frantic. Draco was grabbing and pulling Harry as though he were falling, and Harry was doing his best to catch him.
Then they were off into the air, and Harry had begun circling the pitch.
“Puke-y,” Draco said, entirely on autopilot. “It was a slip up.”
“And I’m with him whenever he’s not with you,” Draco said. “And I’ll be on the pitch next Quidditch match.”
“He’s alive!” Ron said, hugging his pet close once he was safely in his hands. “Oh, Scabbers!” He looked to Harry with joy, then to Hermioned, then he remembered the past month. “Oh. Er. Sorry.”
“And I like to think dementors is a perfectly good reason for me to plummet off my broom.”
“Raw meat!” Draco let out a soft laugh and put his head in his hands. “They’re invisible, so just toss the food onto the ground a bit away from each other. They shouldn’t fight anyway, but I wouldn’t want either of you to get in the middle of one.” Hagrid picked up a bucket full of raw meat and set it down in front of him and Potter. Then he turned and whistled.
“I don’t like it,” Harry said. “I should’ve been punished, but you weren’t there. You would’ve done the same thing.” He stared down Blaise, and something flickered in his eyes. It was something that, if Harry couldn’t outright recognize it, at least sympathize.
Ron blanched. “Mate, it was just a question.”
“She said she was turning in early.”
I DIDN'T DIE! I am in college tho so, same diff. I've been so excited to post this chapter. It is..... my favorite, and I hope you enjoyed. I have no clue when the next chapter will be, so please bear with me. But fear not, dear friends, because I'm not abandoning this! Until next time~
“Right, Merlin forbid you hang out with Mudbloods and blood traitors,” Ron said.
Draco shrugged. “Well, Crabbe and Goyle aren’t smart enough to. And Pansy and Blaise have their own issues.”
Well.
Harry stayed with his hand over Draco's mouth until they couldn't hear Ron and Hermione walking anymore. Then he pulls away, painfully aware of how close they were. They stayed underneath the cloak. Harry's eyes were jumping from Draco's to his mouth.
I feel like two months is a personal record for update times. Thanks for sticking around. A fair warning: it's a it plot heavy for a while. But fear not. There will be fluff :) Until next time~
“Dirty move! Honestly! Hopefully he gets called- right, sorry, Professor,” Lee Jordan said. “Gryffindor is awarded a penalty after Montague grabs her head. And… She scores! 30-0, Gryffindor!” Harry cheered again.
“Wait, are you gay?” Draco's face was bright red, though he wasn't sure if it was embarrassment, rage, or both. His shoulders were taught and his hands balled up in fists, his hair was mussed. He was handsome.
Draco coughed. “You have an invisibility cloak?”
Harry came back to Gryffindor tower feeling euphoric. The feeling lasted a few more days before Ron woke up shrieking that Sirius Black had tried to kill him.
This was how Draco finished his lengthy explanation of everything he had been feeling for the past few months. Pansy listened with a blank face until he flopped over onto the couch, alone in the common room in the early hours of the morning. She cracked a smile and said, “You fell hard.”
“What are we going to do?” Harry asked.
“Not Crabbe and Goyle?” Ron asked.
“You’d think he’d be grateful Harry’s alive!” Fred replied.
They brought the boxes back to McGonagall and she dismissed them, pleased that they had not tried to kill each other for the third time.
Draco wondered what Lupin’s time at Hogwarts had been like. Did he see Potter and admire him for the adoration he received? Did it make him remember his own time in the wide, empty halls, sitting alone in his common room as he tuned in and out of the conversations of people around him, never truly knowing how he could come in or if he was wanted. Or had he been like Potter, and had merely glanced over the lonelier kids, only trying to relate to Draco now out of some past guilt?
“Weasley threw his bat,” he defended as Oliver blocked the shot and Harry cheered once more. 20-0 Gryffindor.
“I know, right?”
Ron laughed. “Oh no, you’re serious,” he then said, sobering immediately. “Why?”
He had asked his father about Black as soon as news came out that he broke out. All he knew was that Black was a double-agent, so deeply involved that he, someone in the Dark Lord’s inner circle, had never even known he was a Death Eater. He didn’t know if he was acting out some plan to revive him. Draco got the feeling he wasn’t excited about that outcome.
“You’re nearly there, Harry,” Lupin would say honestly. That was the worst part. He meant it sincerely. He had improved. Every time a blue wisp would work it’s way out of his wand, and sometimes it would shape itself into something. Not a defined shape so much as the promise it could soon be one. But he would still leave wrapped in his mother’s voice, questioning if it was worth it.
Based on Harry’s timid hand as he took a… snack, Pansy and Blaise cautiously took one and avoided any ingestion. “It’ll be okay, Hagrid,” Harry said. “If anyone can convince them, it’s these two.” Pansy grinned.
“Nobody would think it was special.”
They ran to the forest, where they hid behind a rock and listened. For an unbearably long time, there was silence, and Ron contented himself with Scabbers. Harry resisted the urge to look over the rock, to see if he could catch someone’s face through the window and guess how it was going, how Pansy and Blaise were managing.
“And Flint scores.” The Slytherins made a decent amount of noise, and Draco whooped and hollered as the scoreboard showed 30-10 Gryffindor.
“If I’m going to be nice to him, he’s got to be nice to me,” Draco said, clenching and unclenching his hands and staring angrily at where Ron had been.
Especially now that he just kissed him out of the blue.
“No,” Harry replied honestly. He didn’t have a monopoly on Draco’s time and he wasn’t even sure what they were so who could possibly care about that, right? But Draco, hiding it poorly, looked a bit put off, and Harry recovered with, “But I’d be a bit lonely, I guess.”
“It’s a lot to talk about, okay? It’s really nothing, I just need a break.”
“I don’t want to talk about it.”
Professor Lupin jumped in front of him, and Pansy and Blaise were at his side. Draco put his head in his arms and curled up as low as he could, more from shame than anything else. He heard Lupin dismiss the class and heard Pansy reassure him that Draco was fine, that they were going to keep an eye on him, that they should really get going now.
He couldn’t, under any circumstances, befriend Potter. That was a can of worms best left unopened.
“Hermione… I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have blamed Crookshanks, and I really shouldn’t have blamed you. Can you-” was about as far as Ron got before Hermione had her arms wrapped around him with a wail. Harry’s heart sank when she explained how lonely and stressed she was even without Divination, and they spent the rest of their Saturday in the Gryffindor common room making up for lost time, sitting close together.
Draco looked at Harry, who shrugged. “I wasn’t awake, I don’t know what happened.”
They were face to face, and Draco was conscious of the fact Potter had grown since they first met, and he now had an inch over Draco. “You’re just scared.”
“Could you please tell me what the heck is going on between you and Draco?” He hissed in a low, dangerous voice. His bright green eyes flashed with barely contained fury as he stared down at the fidgeting wizard at his feet.
He looked dead. Only the movement of his chest and the slight tremors going through his body calmed Draco down enough not to start panicking immediately.
Draco wheezed as he inhaled painfully. "No," Harry had to lean down in order to catch the whispered word. "They would take too long and are too dangerous."
Harry leaned back against the cold stone wall of the cold dungeon, wrapping his scarf tighter around his slender neck. He was happy that he had remembered taking it as he had upped and left the Common Room to meet up with whoever had sent him this nice sounding letter. He just hoped it wasn’t some crazed fan who wanted to kidnap him.
When you love someone so much that you're turning blind, or in Ginny's case... impatient.
Hermione nodded slowly, but didn’t turn her eyes away from the Black Lake. “I’m pretty sure it’s a Love Potion. I haven’t heard of one that is as potent at that one apparently is, but there’s no other explanation, really.”
His best friend deflated in front of his eyes.
This insane man wasn’t his father. He was nothing but a torturer, a murderer, who had clearly lost his mind along the way. The Dark Lord had cost him his soul, if he knew it or not, and if Draco allowed this to go on, allowed this to be him in a few years, he would never be able to live with himself. That man standing in front of him wasn’t human anymore. Hasn’t been for many, many years.
Draco shook his head and buried his face in his hands. “I can’t believe this really happened,” he mumbled softly as Harry lovingly wrapped his arms around the shaking body and pulled him close. “This is so embarrassing!”
Glancing at the sleeping faces as they went by, they looked for the Malfoy heir. Astoria jumped as Blaise Zabini snorted in his sleep. "Careful!" Daphne whispered as she glared at her sister, who was standing behind her, shivering slightly. She hadn't taken her coat with her.
He tried not to think about what was happening to Draco at this moment as he carefully pressed his ear against doors and listened to the slightest noise that might tell him what was behind each door. He forced himself to keep from thinking that he was too late, that he had waited too long to come and find him.
“I was at the owlery,” he said and vaguely pointed down the hall to his left. “I sent Pig off with a letter for Mrs. Weasley.” His head tilted to the side slightly as his expression got worried. “Is something wrong?”
Harry turned around in time to see Draco close the front door, an air of hurriedness surrounding him.
His arm pulsed painfully as small drops of blood hit the polished wooden floor.
shiver. Harry gulped. "But first let's go and take a seat."
And with that Harry pulled Draco towards him, gently pressing his lips onto the blonde’s, enjoying the feeling of having him in his life.
Well, he wasn't saying that he didn't like it – sitting at a couple's table with only Malfoy to look at, his white-blond hair almost glistening in the candle light that illuminated most of the tables and that beautiful smile directed his way – but he did wonder whether something was going extremely wrong. There were rumours about him liking men rather than women – he had had enough owls from devastated ladies to show him that people believed what the
He ran after the invisible form of the blond and aimed his wand to the spot he assumed his body to be. Muttering the counter charm, he slowly lowered Draco and let him come to rest on a soft patch of grass underneath the window. He hoped that the rogue peacocks running around on the ground didn't step on the blond, but to blow the cloak off of the injured boy could very well mean his death.
Harry took a deep breath and turned towards his best friend. “Oh yeah? And what makes you think that?”
"Ah, I'm glad," Ginny smiled innocently and turned towards Dean. "What do you think? Should we make a short trip to the kitchens and have some delicious cupcakes for celebration?"
She couldn’t believe that she hadn’t learnt from her past mistakes. Fred had always told her that she needed to take a few steps back from time to time and look at the situation calmly before going through the roof. She had always been hot-headed, she knew that, but to tell Harry that his boyfriend was messing with him without confronting said boyfriend before ruining their relationship...
. He didn't know what he was doing or
Shaking his head, he scowled inwardly at his own Hermione-like mind and strolled purposefully over to the bar, trying to decide which whiskey he should try next.
Harry swallowed down a wave of sadness, betrayal and pain as he hurried to pick up his clothes and turned to leave the room, leaving a broken Draco behind.
"I guess we should continue this somewhat more private," Draco stood, took the still dumbly blinking and slightly gaping Potter's hand and, with a last rude gesture towards the reporters just outside the nearest window, disapparated.
"I get it." He leaned back and eyed the young woman in front of him, his fellow ex-Slytherin and best friend. A big grin spread over his face as he watched her nervous exterior. "I'm so in!"
"Harry?"
He had grown paranoid, fearing, or maybe hoping, that someone would notice, that someone would see his peculiar behaviour and care enough to get him to stop – and one person had.
“You need to what? Calm down, Draco! We’ve got what we wanted. You won the bet and I got my front page story. Everything’s brilliant and I’ll be the editor’s favourite for bringing him the story of his lifetime! I can see it printed already. The words above the picture of the half-naked darling of the wizarding world, ‘Harry Poof, it’s all a farce!’” Her laugh was high and way too loud and Draco pushed past her and dragged the blanket with him out of the bedroom. “What are you doing?”

need a break, Draco. We can't go on like this. If you promise something, I rely on you, and you end up disappointing me… It's not a huge deal if it's flour you've forgotten or you haven't told me that you needed to stay at work for longer, but it's how you go about it. You let me wait for you, sitting on the couch and wondering whether something has happened to you. You force me to go to Molly's and tell her that my boyfriend won't make it to her sixtieth birthday, although one of her sons who lives in Romania has arrived a day early to surprise her, even though his work doesn't allow it."
Astoria looked back with wide eyes.
One glance towards the red-haired boy standing to his right told him what his once best friend was thinking of him. The disgust in his blue eyes was obvious. He had seen it lurk in the background ever since he had told them about Draco, but choosing his boyfriend over his best friend which he no doubt thought this had been about had brought it all to the front. In an oddly satisfying way Harry was glad that it had happened that way. Seeing the true side of his friend hurt, yes, it hurt a lot, but he was also thankful for knowing that this side existed.
"Impedimenta!"
"It was an accident, okay? I didn't do it on purpose!" Draco exclaimed, his face flushed. "Do you honestly believe that I would destroy the watch on purpose?"
His once slightly tanned skin looked sickly pale and was covered in wounds, some still looked raw and inflamed. Bruises covered half of his face, which was sunken in as if he hadn’t been eating properly for months. His entire frame, clad in dirt and blood-crusted clothes, looked almost tiny. His clothes hung off of him as if he had lost a couple of stone, which he probably had. His hair was rumbled to such an extent that Draco was inclined to just cut everything off and let it grow anew. It was matted with so much grime that it was a wonder that his pillow still looked white.
Ginny grinned. She couldn't believe that they had not yet noticed each other's Feelings, but as she looked towards Dean who was busy watching her, she wasn't all that surprised. Apparently guys were just blind when it came to
“BLAISE, BABY, DON’T HIDE FROM ME!”
Draco gulped, trying to get his breathing to calm down. He wanted to at least have some control, even if everything else was being forced on him. He would not give those people the satisfaction of seeing him fall to pieces.
The blond stared at the back of the entrance way, not knowing what to do. She had just not only led him into the Gryffindor common room without asking any questions, but had also let him know the password to come back in the near future. He wasn’t used to this kind of willingly given trust from people who barely knew him. The only other person who had trusted him with all their heart and soul was Harry; the boy sleeping some floors above him.
not marry her!"
“Honestly, Weasley. I have no idea why you keep on going about Harry. We were talking about Zabini.” Malfoy looked lost. Completely lost. And Ginny felt all the blood drain from her face.
“LET GO OF ME, OLD WOMAN! I HAVE TO –“
Potter
enough for him," her older sister scoffed as she glared over her shoulder at the blond wizard. "He should be proud to answer his family's wishes!"
“Unexpected?”
Harry bit back a smile.
Bemused, Draco only managed to gasp as Harry took hold of his hand and dragged him away from the table with the alcohol on it. “Potter, what do you think you’re doing?”
(quote) „I like nonsense, it wakes up the brain cells. Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living.” – Dr. Seuss, (word) happily
His narrowed eyes searched Draco's silver ones, demanding, pleading for an explanation, but Draco could only open his mouth, unable to give him what he so much longed for. He needed to explain that this wasn't what it looked like, that this wasn't what Harry was thinking, but it
He hadn’t gotten a good look at Harry in a very long time. Back in the Manor, he had been disfigured by Hermione’s stinging hex, and a few hours ago both of them had been busy shooting curses at Death Eaters to really look at each other. But what he saw now made it hard for him to breath.
Slowly, he shook his head. “I don’t know,” he whispered, his silver eyes leaving the loving embrace of the emerald ones looking at him. “I was unconscious.”
Her eyes darted from Harry to Draco and back again. Both of them seemed different than just this morning at breakfast. Not that she was particularly close to the blond but she was with the raven-haired Gryffindor and that much was for sure – he was behaving differently.
And with that thought fueling her growing anger at the Slytherin, she turned back and strode down the corridor she had come from just moments before. Maybe she was lucky and he was still near the library.
Harry nodded slowly. “Of course, you would have. I’m sorry.” He smiled sheepishly in my direction, causing the butterflies to tap-dance. “I know you would have told me. It’s just so…”
She leaned over him, uncorked the vial and let one drop of potion fall onto each of his eyelids. They twitched slightly as the cold liquid hit the soft skin. "Do your magic," the heir of the Greengrass family whispered as she watched the drops seep into the thin flesh.
The blond witch seemed to think along those lines as well, as she glared at Harry’s saviour. “Well,
"I see you've noticed our guest."
“No, Draco, you listen to me now.”
had taken a hold of the young wizard, and Lord Voldemort had to admit – it amused him immensely. Ah, youth. The youth still thought they were in control of their lives and would one day change the world for the better. They didn’t want to accept the fact that the world’s future was bigger than their person, that sacrifices would have to be made, even if that meant giving up their own lives for their master.
“You lost a lot of blood,” the blond’s head jerked up and he looked at Harry whose eyes were focused on the white bedding that covered Draco’s lower body. “The wound got infected since it went untreated for so long. I nearly lost you.” His voice cracked towards the ends, not louder than a whisper.
The alarm and his doorbell went off at the same time.
Draco sniffled softly and a shy grin started to spread over his young face. “Harry,” he breathed and an adorable blush coloured his pale cheeks.
“I don’t know myself, I’m afraid…”
Gasping for air, they soon had to draw back. Draco’s eyes were still closed and his lips slightly parted as Harry watched his lover tenderly, ran his fingers along his hair line, over his temple and cheek, along his jaw and stopped at his slightly swollen pink lips. The blond wizard opened his eyes and looked into bright green ones that were watching him intensely. He blushed.
A ringing filled Ginny’s ears, getting louder and louder the longer she stood behind the suit of armour. She saw red. All she could think about was to protect Harry at all costs, so, with self-control she didn’t know she possessed, she calmly stepped out from her hiding spot, turned right, and walked down the hallway, back the way she had come from and away from the traitor.
, whispered a seductive voice in his ear, luring his darkest dreams out of the deepest corner of his heart.
Soft whispers filled the room as the nameless figures moved to the back of the cell, leaving the defenceless girl in the middle of the cold, wet floor. She was still clutching desperately at her aching stomach. Draco schooled his features into a carefully empty expression, but inside he was screaming. He wanted to help her, but he knew he couldn’t. Judging by her defeated posture, she knew that he would not be of any help. Quite the contrary in fact. He would be one of her torturers. She knew it and he did as well.
“And you? You are alright?” Draco asked softly as he searched every free spot of skin, every movement, every facial expression that could convince him of the opposite.
Once seated, Harry stared at his former rival oddly. He didn't understand what was going on. This felt more like a date than a nice meeting with a possible future
A lot had changed during the last year. With most of the population of Hogwarts going through the trauma of living in a school filled with Death Eaters, certain loyalties had been formed while others had been broken. Thinking back to her conversation with Hermione the night before, she wondered whether Malfoy had been one of those who had renounced Voldemort’s ranks and had really changed for the better.
He knew his boyfriend had trouble with his father. He tried to push him in a certain dark direction and down to his knees in front of Voldemort, forcing him to bow down and kiss the hem of the monster’s robe, but Harry didn’t think that that would be the reason for the blonde’s weird behaviour. No, every time he had had problems with his father – more so than normal – he used to come straight to Harry for support and the feeling of being loved and safe. He hadn’t done it this time.
*~*HPDM*~*
Although half of her year consisted of those repeating their last year, she couldn’t help but dwell on the fact that even those who had theoretically spent one year longer at school were managing to organise their time efficiently. Well, except for Hermione, of course, but she had always managed to do that, even before the war.
Lightning cracked through the sky, briefly illuminating the garden underneath. The flowers that usually stood tall and proud were fighting against the pressure of the rain drops that pelted down upon them without mercy.
Draco frowned as Harry hesitated slightly, not fully knowing how to answer that question. “What happened, Harry?”
a look as jerked his head unmistakably in my direction. He obviously thought I didn’t see. I sulked even more after that.
This one is from the third season of the Quidditch League Fanfiction Competition on FFN. In this one, we had to write about forbidden relationships.
"Do you?" A sad laugh escaped his parted lips. "I'm so sorry that I can't be the one that you deserve. I'm so sorry that I'm not strong enough to go against him and choose for myself. You know that I would choose differently. I don’t have any control over that but please let me protect you as much as I can. Please."
“Crucio!”
. Being part of a pure-blood line and being male held high responsibilities. He had to carry on the line of his family name. He wouldn’t be able to do so without a pure-blood woman by his side.
different. It might not even be that we’re different. Maybe the straight people are different? At least that’s what I’m trying to tell me.”
“Lucius, I better not be hearing this,” Voldemort hissed as his eyes narrowed dangerously.
"Of course not." Draco's voice sounded hollow, lifeless, as he once again glanced at the Muggle on the floor. She had stopped sobbing, but tears still kept streaming down her dirty face.
– any longer.
Harry bit his bottom lip. He knew where he stood with the blond now, and he doubted that they would have a future together.
Weird, that one
without a fight. He had thrown his own wand towards him, leaving himself defenceless, but in that moment he couldn’t have cared less. The shocked gasp that ran through the crowd, good people and Death Eaters alike, had barely bothered him at all. If at all, it had filled him with pride. He had, for once, acted on his own accord – he had
He could still feel that laugh if he closed his eyes and let all the worried thoughts flow out of his head. He had not said it then, but he had admitted to himself as he had returned into the mansion that that night had been the last between the two wizards. He was sure that the other had known and he was thankful that it had not stood between them. They had both needed it as a source of a sense of security and love, giving them strength for what the future had in hand for them.

deserved him! “No, Harry, he’s messing with you!”
“Oi! Give that back!” I reached forward, only to be pulled onto my feet.
His eyes snapped open, his head up and his hand to his side. He desperately tried not to clench it as he saw his mother walk into the room, a soft smile on her face and her arms opened wide to greet him.
"Stay."
The voice of Lord Voldemort echoed through the room, making all of the Death Eaters shrink back towards the wall. Pathetic.
As he looked at the broken watch that he had found in his family vault after the war, the first of many tears fell down his cheek. His hand trembled as he wiped it away, only for more to follow in its wake.
"Don't worry, I'll explain it to you soon," Harry was pulled out of his slightly panicked thoughts by Malfoy's oddly melodic voice and warm hand on the small of his back. A shiver ran up his spine – a
„Were you ever under the impression that I was normal? Seriously, Dean! We were together for a year. You must know me better by now.”
“Really?” He raised an elegant eyebrow and studied Ackland suspiciously. “And who are you if I may ask?” The animosity in his voice was difficult to ignore.
“No, sorry.
I pushed the letter back into the envelope and thrusted it into Harry’s direction. “No, you open it. Please.”
Draco was taken aback and gaped at the black-haired wizard, who had a cute frown on his face. Those brilliant green eyes bore into his silver ones, giving him the feeling of being read like an open book. He blinked. He didn’t know, did he? He gulped. He hoped not. He didn’t want the world to know that he wasn’t that bad of a guy. Well, maybe he did, but he didn’t want to be seen with the man of his dreams like this, talking civilly and probably destroying Harry’s popularity in the wizarding world just because he didn’t hate the
"Our Lord has decided that you will have an extreme honour. The Dark Lord holds a special interest in you as my son, so you will gladly and voluntarily follow his orders, Draco." His eyes twinkled menacingly behind the slits of his mask as he glared at his son and dared him to step one foot out of line.
Draco watched the display of emotions running over Harry’s adorably confused face. Merlin, how much he loved this man. He had always thought this bullocks about love being the most powerful thing on earth was just that – complete and utter bullocks, but he had come to understand how exactly Harry’s parents had been able to save their son’s life. He grinned widely as Harry decided on understanding which made his eyes light up and sparkle in the most beautiful way possible.
“You’re alive,” she sounded relieved, which gave him hope that maybe someday she might actually forgive him and maybe even become his friend.
A frown darkened his face as he wandered through the dungeon corridors towards the meeting spot he was supposed to be at in - he cast the
Speechless, the dark-haired wizard shook his head and shrugged. “I have absolutely no idea! I swear! You have to believe me! I woke up the morning and before I knew it he was all over me, showering me with kisses…” He scowled as he slowly went out of the library, Hermione hot on his heels.
A sob escaped him as he threw his clothes onto his bed, just as his knees gave way underneath him. He sank to the ground and buried his face in his hands.
*~*HPDM*~*
What he saw inside the classroom made his blood run cold. He couldn’t breathe as his eyes zoomed in on his boyfriend – the exact same one that made a point in avoiding him today – tightly wrapped around Hermione’s boyfriend. Harry blinked. His mouth had gone completely dry. No, this couldn’t be true!
Blaise’s head shot up, his eyes getting bigger with the second. “Harry!” He yelled, as he saw the dumbfounded wizard stand in the doorway, his hands hanging at both sides, staring at the pair in front of them. “Please, I need he-“
“Yeah, I’ve assumed as much,” Draco sighed and rubbed over his face with his free hand. “It doesn’t matter that I am a free man according to the Ministry. That one decision has them bound to that way of thinking.”
*~*Impedimenta*~*
He had lost his whole family due to that maniac and had watched others lose their lived right before his eyes – whether that had been because of the Killing Course or because of their parents’ believes and their own unbelievably huge fear.
Fear so potent and overwhelming that he hadn’t dared to move had flooded his body. Dread and a paralysing sense of acceptance had left him frozen on the spot.
Everytime his Death Eater relatives had left him alone, which hadn’t been all that often, he had tried to listen to Potterwatch, a secret radio show he had found by accident. They never said anything about how Harry was or whether they had been in contact with him, but, as they had always repeated, in that case
“Draco?”
I had to write about the Beast Division (Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures) of the Ministry of Magic.
“Maybe you should have started doing your homework last week when those two essays were announced,” Ginny drawled as she moved past the eighth year Gryffindor. She bit down a snicker as she saw the appalled expression on the other’s face when she walked out of the classroom.
It was weird - a part of her really
“But, Daphne!”
Said young wizard swallowed painfully, trying his best to not shrug off his father’s hand. That would have been seen as betrayal, and he feared that that would exactly be the reason why he wanted to do it in the first place. Listening to that sick man talk about how following a madman was the honourable thing Malfoys did, had always done for generations, made him want to lay off that name and refuse to have ever been part of that twisted family.
He couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right, though. Draco would have sent him a letter by now, telling him that he was alive, that he didn't need to worry. Not sending a letter would lead to Harry coming to bad conclusions; he knew that all too well. So why was he not hearing him? He could think of a couple of options; one less welcome than the other. Either, he was on an entirely different storey and the elf had not meant Draco at all, the blond was busy and didn't feel the need to myke any noises - he liked that option the most - or the young Malfoy heir was unable to make a sound, maybe unconscious. He didn't want to think about the other possibility. If his other half was unconscious, he needed him to finally stop being a coward and start opening doors, damn it!
Ron stared back and said, “I swear it wasn’t a dream!”
Draco let them into the shared boys dorm, where Blaise was leaning casually on a chair and Pansy was sprawled out on one of the beds. Once Draco closed the door, Harry removed the cloak and Pansy gasped. “That’s not fair,” she said.
Lupin, almost unwillingly, agreed, and opened the dresser. Harry thought about Hagrid telling him he was a wizard, how his life with the Dursley’s would end for the most part and he could finally live free from bullies with people who would talk to him without fear in there eyes. Three meals a day. A room without locks. Possessions. Clothes that fit.
If he could ignore it, maybe it would go away. All he had to do was block him out for Care of Magical Creatures and Double Potions. That would likely be difficult, though; Hagrid (Professor Hagrid, Draco corrected sarcastically) worshipped Potter nearly as much as Dumbledore did, and Potter was too much of a dolt to get through a Potions class without drawing attention to himself.
Harry was sitting in Professor Lupin’s office. “The only way to get rid of a dementor is a Patronus charm,” Lupin explained. “It won’t kill them. I’m not sure if a dementor can be killed. But it pushes them away, makes them have less effect over you.”
He was doomed. And, as horrifying as it was to believe that anyone had picked up on his obsession with Potter, Pansy knew it.
Not wanting whatever uneasy friendship they had to go away, Harry tried to concede. “I told Ron and Hermione.”
Harry did was he did best. “What’s what?” Sadly, what Harry did best was be stupid.
The locker room was dead silent, a mixture of excitement and dread. Oliver was murmuring the same thing over and over, the same thing they all had memorized. The amount of points they had to score before Harry caught the Snitch. They had to win by 210. Sixty points. That’s all they needed.
Harry was at a loss, and he could imagine Crabbe and Goyle were quite literally lost without Draco to lead them around. The first day it happened, Ron sat wordless beside Harry, who was a normal distance from Draco as they enjoyed the warm weather next to the lake (he decided this was where if they both set their hands they were mere centimeters from touching while still looking casual enough to dissuade suspicion).
“I wanted to get my work done before detention.”
“Well, pay me back. I doubt anyone wants to see golden boy Harry Potter out of Hogwarts.”
“Pretty?”
“Yes, Draco. Thank you for cleaning up the tanks. I won’t bother you about this anymore.” He gave one last smile, and Draco left.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You won’t tell anyone, right?”
He heard footsteps and he managed to get himself more onto his bed, where he could reasonably feign sleep. “Harry?”
“No. You’re right.” Harry stood up, only leaning slightly on Lupin. “If I can’t do it then, it won’t matter. Let’s go again.”
“At least they’re not cowards,” Draco replied, keeping his voice cool. “These two would go after Black if he killed their parents. I’m sure yours would be proud to see you hiding.”
“Why not finish the job,” Harry agreed.
“You guys can stay,” Harry said.
“Yes, us,” Harry said, frowning.
“I refuse.”
Draco nodded, although he only succeeded in mussing up the back of his hair on Pansy’s skirt. “I agree, Pans. But Potter can’t even do that. He’s an imbecile!” Pansy hummed in agreement. “And he has a dumb face, with his dumb scar. Who would think a scar is cool? You could get a scar from falling down stairs or some other stupid reason. What if his hot scar is from stairs, huh? What then, Potter?”
“I can’t imagine they look anything alike, even in the dark,” Pansy said. “Weasley’s too pale, and Potter’s hair doesn’t look red in any light.”
Hello darlings. I'm back and very busy. Until the 10th I'm babysitting, so I doubt there will be another chapter this week. Sorry. After that, I have a friend's birthday and then a two day beach trip. And school starts on the 26th. So... Stick with me? ~Until next time.
Though Ron was happy to accept that Harry had a boyfriend, he was incredibly against spending any time with Draco in any capacity. And, given they weren’t on speaking terms with Hermione, Harry was left alone with Draco.
Draco folded the letter back up and handed it to Pansy. He didn’t know what to say. Neither did Pansy, as she was staring wide-eyed at him in frightened anticipation. “When did you get this?”
Harry couldn’t look at Draco. It felt too raw, too much like something he shouldn’t be allowed to see. Being vulnerable was dangerous, it was more for the Dursley’s to tear to shreds. Harry got the idea something similar happened to Draco growing up. Yet here he was, baring his soul in a sloppy, real way.
“He could try,” Harry conceded. Anything was worth a shot. The only one that had any actual time was Ron.
Draco grinned. “Let’s go then.”
He swallowed and drew back out of his head, turning his attention back to stroke Draco’s shoulder until his breathing steadied.
“I’m going to kill you.”
“Works with me,” Draco replied. He took off his robes and rolled up his shirt sleeves. Scowling, he picked up a sponge and a bucket. With a grimace on his face, he started scrubbing at the grime that had accumulated on the sides of the tank.
“Do you like him?” Hermione asked.
“I’m fine, sir, thank you.” He was uncomfortable and, more importantly, quite hungry.
“Remember how well that worked out last time?” Hermione asked. “We’d probably get worse than the Forbidden Forest if we get caught with Buckbeak. We need something safer.”
“And leave you alone? Have your death on my conscious? You think I would want everyone after me because I left their handsome hero Harry Potter to be brutally murdered by a psychopa-”
Their detention that night would be overseen by Filch, and his stomach dropped. He wasn’t sure what would be worse; the manual labor or the nonstop insults that would come their way. At eight they met in the trophy room, where Filch told them they would be polishing the trophies and plaques. All of them. No magic.
Draco made as if to say something, and Harry pushed his hand over his mouth. “He came over here, right?” Ron asked, stumbling a few feet away from where they were hiding.
“Hey, um. Sorry.” Draco looked up to make sure Potter had indeed said something, and he was lounging back in one of the seats, looking away from Draco.
“I’m going to turn in early.” They did nothing to mask their concern, but Ron didn’t follow and the bedroom was empty. He didn’t get changed and instead fell into bed. There was too much to unpack. It was easier to just ignore for the time being.
But now it was Christmas. Hermione, though studying, was taking a much needed break from classes. Oliver was home for the holidays (though Harry, Fred, and George all agreed he was practicing at home and muttering formations in his sleep). He was left undistracted with his thoughts.
“I already helped. I did half the work. It’s not my fault you’ve never lifted a finger in your whole life.”
Harry leaned forward and kissed him.
“Hi?”
Moments later, Draco was back with him. “Ha, funny.”
“Back at the windowsill,” Draco agreed. “Unless you want to go somewhere more private?”
With love, Mother and Father
“I don’t know if I have any happy memories,” he answered.
Harry felt awful to see him deflate. “I did go last trip. I, er, I snuck out.”
“We’ve been snogging for weeks now.”
Ron’s mouth screwed up. “I will. We will.”
“No,” Harry said. “We can’t just let him run free, either. He’s too comfortable, I think. He’d probably just stay right we he was if we cut him free.” He huffed. “I just don’t know.”
Draco felt himself tense up, and decided he had quite enough of snooping around. He took a few steps back, walked normally toward the door, and knocked. Lupin answered. He smiled. “Good evening, Draco. Harry and I have been waiting.”
Draco did, not so much from the whispered words, but from the fact that he was being shaken by the shoulders. He opened his eyes, sore from how early it was, to see Pansy. “How’d you get in here?” The Slytherin common room was in the dungeons with windows that showed the lake, so they didn’t get much natural light. However, it was pitch black in the water. “What time is it?”
“Why?”
He was back in his room before he realized it, and was thankfully alone. He let out a scream and slammed his head into his pillow, his whole body hot with rage. Why didn’t anyone tell him?
The crowd went wild. Lee Jordan was sobbing, and Oliver pulled Harry into the tightest hug of his life. He was dragged away before he could say anything to Draco, who did his best to give a good natured nod.
Confused, he took the parchment out of my slightly clammy hands, pulled it out of the envelope and began to read.
He pulled his horrified gaze from the puddle of dried blood and continued his stumbling way into the castle. He really hoped he didn’t have to talk to anyone. He didn’t know what he could say. Nearly everyone in Hogwarts had lost someone in the war that had only started because he had led the Death Eaters into the castle last year. It had been his fault that Dumbledore had been killed. It was his fault – his alone.
"The window it is, then," Harry sighed and jogged over to the ceiling-high window that was framed by two smaller ones. Not seeing a handle to open the big one, Harry trained his wand onto the glass and vanished it.
"He is nearly of age. He should have started courting me by now," Astoria frowned and gazed over to the other side of the Great Hall, where her fiancé was talking with Gryffindor's Golden Boy. "But instead he's busy flirting with Potter! I don't understand this, Daphne. Am I not beautiful enough for him?"
“I can’t believe it! WHO THE HELL DID THIS TO ME? No, wait! I know who did it!” His sparkling grey eyes flashed as he saw the Greengrass sisters walk up to them, heads hanging and apologetic, yet unsure smiles on their faces. “Father instructed you to do it, didn’t he?”
The next day started just like any other day in the autumn month - gloomy. Clouds covered the sky, making the golden leaves look dull and dead. Classes hadn't been any better either. It was Ginny’s last year in Hogwarts and she had always imagined it to be exciting, but as it turned out, the professors had reached a new level of spitefulness.
This is one of my favourites! Also, I'm sorry if there might be some mistakes in my stories. I'm not a native English speaker, so you guys might see mistakes that I don't. I hope you enjoy reading my stories nevertheless!
The smile on Narcissa’s smile softened as her eyes roamed over her son’s face. Her beautiful baby boy, all grown up, trying to fight his own demons in order to tell them the truth, trying to fight his own fears. From an early day on he had been told that he would one day marry a rich pureblood woman, one from a well-known family and provide them a Malfoy heir. He had been told it would be his responsibility to make sure the Malfoy name would be carried on. And now he was sitting beside her, his face wet with tears she was sure he didn’t know were there, his bottom lip stubbornly held in between his teeth to keep it from trembling and yet… when she looked into his eyes she saw determination. He knew what he was doing was the right thing to do – the only thing to do, but that did not make it easier for him.
Harry jumped to the left, crashing into a velvet, green armchair as the sizzling curse shot mere inches past him. A sharp pain shot through his side, but he didn't hold still. Quickly picking himself up off the floor, he escaped another bright green curse that had been aimed towards the spot he had just been lying on. His heart hammered in his chest and his arm shot up as if on its own accord and shot a silent stunner straight into the attacker's chest, taking him down as well.
” His voice was getting louder with each question. Draco took a step back.
“I don’t know what you are talking about,” his voice was a mere whisper. He didn’t bother trying to overplay this faux-pas. I could see it in Harry’s eyes…
Harry took a calming breath and smiled charmingly at his boyfriend. “I might have kind of broken my ankle when I jumped out of your bedroom window, but Madam Pomfrey healed it, alright. I’m completely fine. See?”
“You didn’t know about this?” Harry’s voice was caring and low. He was obviously trying not to scare me into running away and screaming like a little girl. Malfoys don’t scream or run away. Especially not at the same time. They just don’t.
"I promise I'll get it, Harry. Relax. See you in a bit." And with that, he hung up and the kitchen went silent again.
“I’m so sorry I knocked you over!” Blaise Zabini said as he pulled her to her feet and behind a huge wooden bookshelf. “He kissed me!“ He hissed as peeked around the corner of the shelf they were currently hiding behind.
Draco bit back a sigh. It's always been this way. His mother had always locked away her human side whilst near her husband and Draco had not known better than to follow in her wake. His father did not appreciate them showing emotion or how he used to call it 'weakness'. At the time he had not known why he had acted like that, but during the war he had had suspicions that his father had merely acted that way to keep them safe, to protect them and teach them to not let others see what they could possibly use as a chance to attack. But he hadn't changed after the war was over, which was the one thing that made him wonder whether Lucius Malfoy really thought of emotions as weakness. If that was the case, he didn't look forward to the conversation they were going to have.
"I don't think of this as a fling, Harry," his voice was seductive as he leaned forward and started to nibble at his neck, succeeding in sending pleasant shivers down Harry's spine. "I've thought about this for a while now and I just cannot wait any longer. I have changed, Harry. Please, believe me, I have. I don't want you to do anything you don't want to do, so if you're not ready or don't feel the same-"
Please leave a comment and tell me what you think!
No. No, no, no,
Door after door he opened, without finding anything than possible guest rooms, studies, game rooms and libraries. Why a family of three needed so many libraries was beyond him.
Granger sighed and massaged the bridge of her nose with two fingers. “They aren’t going to throw you into Azkaban, Malfoy.”
He could still feel the last bits of adrenaline pump through his system as he slowly walked across Hogwarts’ grounds and tried to not look too closely.
at least! This silence was making him insane.
He took a deep breath and strengthened his mental walls. Voldemort frowned, obviously displeased. Draco was sure that Lucius would get into a lot of trouble once this was over, since he wouldn’t be there anymore to take all the blame. Hiding thoughts from their master was a huge act of disobedience, which was usually dealt with through torture.
for this world, sir! I killed for a world that enjoyed it more to make fun of me, to give its best to shun me, to spread rumours about me and to completely
Until next time - see ya!
“Breathe, love,” Draco said amused as Harry took a huge gulp of air and stared at him as if he was suddenly sporting a set of wings on his back and a horn on his forehead.
. It was a feeling he had grown quite accustomed to, yet he despised it no less.
didn’t have to deal with the knowledge of being a freshly awakened Veela. Those heat waves from his touches, those hyperactive butterflies, the confusing thoughts, the constant sexual reaction of my body that I can’t seem to be able to control whatsoever and those damn titillative shoulder blades that I just want to scratch out of my body… I let my head droop and sighed loudly. I hated my life. Well, not all of it obviously, but right now it was very difficult to convince myself of that little unimportant fact…
A soft finger pushed my head up gently. I blinked. Harry nodded encouragingly.
Said young wizard raised his head and looked at the origin of the deep voice. His father stood in the door frame, a neutral, yet calm expression on his face as he looked at his only son. Out of the corner of his eyes, he saw his mother straighten up and tense. He just barely held back his infamous scowl as he looked his father into the eye.
?” Harry chuckled darkly as he sat up straight, causing Hermione to sink back into herself. “Do you even listen to yourself, Hermione?
The house was quiet. Eerily quiet.
“What was that?”
A punch in his knee had him bend down himself, catching his fall at the last second before his face would have made contact with the uncomfortably hard floor. He couldn’t believe it. Pure instinct and his bloody so-called father had him involuntarily kneel down in front of a monster. A voice in the back of his head that sounded suspiciously like Harry yelled at him to stand back up. Doing that would get him killed in an instant. Straightening up and looking the darkest wizard of the last century in the eye, though... That he could do, he thought cheekily, and risked his health and probably head as he raised the latter defiantly and glared at the ugly man in the doorway.
"Just get the freaking hell out of here, Pansy! I mean it!"
"It's been such a long time!"
I thought miffed, not wasting one more thought on the fact that Malfoys
Drip. Drip. Drip.
,” Draco whispered and started running. Forgotten was his blanket that lay on top of the stairs leading to the manor, forgotten was the witch that was standing in the hallway, watching a very naked Draco Malfoy run away from his house, because all he could see was the dark-haired wizard who stopped, turned around and, with a spin, disappeared into thin air.
Granger glared at me as if I had killed her whole family in one day and made her watch. I gulped. I was used to that look, yes, but it didn’t mean that I liked it. I wanted her to like me – or at least accept me. I wasn’t that stupid to actually
Disappointment was the main emotion that Harry felt at that moment, mixed with anger. Situations like this were accumulating lately, and he didn't know what to do about it. Draco hadn't been like this when they had started their relationship. If he had, Harry wouldn't have wasted so much time and energy in what they had, but time and time again he couldn't help but think that something was wrong. When your partner kept flaking on you, surely that wasn't normal?
Harry followed him, confused. "But we've had this dinner planned for over a week now." He sounded slightly whiny as he couldn't help but feel slightly angry at the sight of his boyfriend rummaging through his wardrobe. "You promised you'd be here for it. You know how much this means to me."
Oh, right.
could be heard from downstairs. I raised my eyebrow and ignored the way the butterflies were playing Quidditch inside my stomach as I watched the handsome wizard’s eyes in front of me double in size.  “…you got an owl that just ruined our breakfast,” he mumbled and hurried out of the room, dragging my precious blanket with him.
Hearing the people laugh and chat happily without a care or regret in their minds was disgusting. All Harry could think of when he thought of that night three years ago was how many lives had been ended brutally or destroyed completely, only because of one insane monster, who couldn’t understand that there was more in life than power, fear and immortality.
The word echoed through his head, bouncing back and forth, gaining in intensity.
Granger sighed. “
“It’s fine. I guess I don’t feel that way towards her, either. I have feelings for someone else, I think.”
They separated and smiled, and fell right back into place like nothing had happened. Hermione was, in fact, doing far too much, but, “I made time to go to the Ravenclaw match already, so don’t worry. Besides, I dropped Divination and that’s made it easier.”
There was a horrifying moment where Pansy looked directly in his eyes, almost as if to silently communicate that she knew it was bullshit and would call him out on it, but she leaned back again and said. “Alright. Puke-y eyes, I guess.”
They all shook their heads. “I woke up because Ron was screaming, but I didn’t see anything.” Neville said.
“It’s cold in here!” They were both sweating.
He didn’t have to deal with Draco anymore. He could skirt around him in class and hope he was too embarrassed by their kiss to bring it up to anyone. He could ignore this. He would be fine.
“He has friends! You’ve seen the two goons that follow him around everywhere.” What was Potter doing there? Why was Lupin talking about him?
“It’s weird,” Harry replied. She looked afraid to admit it, to admit how uncomfortable she was with the concept, and Harry said, “It’s okay. I get it. I think it’s weird, too.”
Tentatively, Draco reached for Harry's face. His wide eyes flickered from Harry's eyes to his mouth. Gently, he pressed his lips to Harry's.
They threw the rest of the meat onto the field, and Hagrid continued to walk around to the bits of floating meat, occasionally reaching out to pet the invisible creatures. It was the quickest detention they had so far, but also the most disgusting. Potter told Hagrid they had used all of the meat, and he dismissed them.
“It was a start,” Lupin replied warmly. “Get some rest. Next week we’ll try again.”
And he was lost again. “Yes, sir. May I go back to my room?”
Still, Draco could see that Harry was stressed about the match, and placed his hand on his back. It felt like Harry had opened something between them when he talked about the Dursley’s. Never had it put it so plainly before. He got the feeling Ron knew exactly what they were, and had the sneaking suspicion Ron had asked his family to put together something for Harry for Christmas and his birthday knowing that they would give him nothing. He didn’t feel as confident with Hermione, but knew she understood he wasn’t fond of his relatives. But he had never said it. Never said Hogwarts was the first time he wasn’t hungry, or that he grew up under stairs, or he never had clothes or glasses that worked properly until Hagrid fetched him.
“Let’s talk about it?”
Draco tried to move away, but Harry held him tighter. “Get over yourself, Draco!” he laughed, relishing Draco’s desperate writhing. Draco bit Harry’s neck in retaliation, and, against his will, Harry let out a moan.
“Well, it’s better than living in a hovel like your hoard of weasel friends.”
“What about the Grim, then?”
“How’d it go?” he asked, setting down a quill. They had a potions essay due. Harry hadn’t even started it.
And that was low enough for a few things to happen. The Head Weasel hissed Harry’s name. Crabbe and Goyle took a moment to comprehend was Potter had just said. And Draco lunged at Potter and punched him in the face.
“You broke my thumb!”
“Could always fly him away from here,” Ron said. “Maybe Charlie would pick him up, too. Might like him.”
Harry waved at Draco. “Hi Draco.”
“I’m not leaving you two alone, I just have a very busy class schedule,” Hermione replied, sticking her nose up and setting her runes textbook down. “Where have you been, though?”
“I had to. He knew the password. Had a whole list of them.”
“So neither of you have seen them? That’s good. They bring the carriages to Hogwarts from the train. I’ve got the only trained herd.”
“I’m fine.” Ron and Hermione glanced at each other before staring at Harry. “What?”
McGonagall had sent an owl to Draco with the time and location of his detention (her classroom at eight). He wound up at her classroom at almost the exact same time as Potter, and they exchanged less than friendly looks. McGonagall saw them walk, in shooting each other death glares, and said, “I hope you both act better than that. You’ll be transfiguring these items back to their original states.” She pulled out a bin full of needles and buttons. “The needles were matchsticks and the buttons were beetles. Do be careful not to squish the beetles.”
“No,” Harry said. “One more time. Please.”
“I'll be right back,” he said, fully aware that he was about to do something very stupid. He walked to some of the trees, a more secluded area, and sure enough he heard Draco make his way through the leaves and scattered twigs.
“Tell that to the executioner.”
McGonagall pressed her lips together in a tight line. “Very well. If you three were trying to break up the fight, I won’t punish you. But you two,” she said, turning to face Draco and Potter, “will follow me to my office where we will discuss your punishment.”
“You guys didn’t talk about Christmas break beforehand?” Hermione asked.
Draco sighed, not trusting the proud puff of Hagrid’s chest. “What do we have to do?” Potter asked.
He pushed himself up and sat back, patting his bed for her to sit next to him. Everyone else was still sleeping. Nott was snoring softly. Crabbe and Goyle were snoring not so softly. “I thought I’d be the last person you’d talk to. I… I was going to find you today and apologize. I’m sorry I-”
“I asked them to let me try and find you. They’re back in Gryffindor tower.”
Finally, the door opened and Draco whispered, “Are you here?”
Ron gently punched her and she shut up.
Cho didn’t stand a chance.
“You think those dolts can help with anything?” Draco replied, and Ron, very much against his will, snorted with laughter. Then he looked horrified with himself. “I asked Pansy and Blaise because they’re smart. And I trust them.”
“Like this?” Harry asked. That seemed more like a give-in than anything.
The situation was not helped when Hagrid told them that Buckbeak had a second trial, but it didn’t look good. “They didn’ even listen to me,” he said, his eyes watery. He, Ron, and Hermione were all in his hut, expertly avoiding the snacks he had offered.
“Was that a Patronus?” he asked, his words slurred.
“No, you won’t,” Blaise said. They held a tense glare. This was a discussion they had had many times. For Blaise and Pansy to defend Buckbeak wasn’t inherently bad; one could insist they wanted to buy it, and Lucius would be killing a worthy purchase. But for the Gryffindors to be there would raise questions about any friendship, which could turn back dangerously on Draco. The three of them were there to mollify Hagrid beforehand.
“How? There were dementors crawling around everywhere!”
“Perfect. Harry, you can go. Draco, if you don’t mind, I’d like to speak with you for a few minutes.”
“She’s just a stuck up brat,” Pansy said, her face turning sour. “Anyone can memorize a textbook.”
“Did I what?”
No. Blaise wasn’t asking questions. He seemed content to just follow Draco, almost as if he was playing the part of Crabbe and Goyle. Truth be told, Draco hardly talked to any of the other Slytherins in his year. Crabbe and Goyle were his go-to friends because they were hopeless without anyone smarter to lead them around, and Pansy was a recent addition. Generally, the other Slytherins seemed scared of the Malfoy association with You-Know-Who. Having Blaise around would be much appreciated.
“Better,” Ron replied, but he looked worried. “She’s more shy than I’ve ever seen. I think everyone’s a bit scared of her still. She’s got a friend in Ravenclaw though, so that’s something.”
“Oh no, he’s blushing. Honestly, Malfoy? The one who we thought opened the Chamber of Secrets last year? The one who you just punched in the face?” Ron was becoming more passionate as he continued, and Hermine placed her hand on his arm to quiet him before they told all of Gryffindor about Harry and Draco.
They didn’t believe him, but they were willing to let it slide given the amount of people around them. They probably thought it had something to do with Sirius Black; Sirius, who was certainly somewhere near. Not the mention that the dementors, though no longer on the school grounds, were a concern. He didn’t want to pass out again and give Draco more ammunition than he already had.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I can’t; my Uncle never signed the permission slip.”
“I think lover boy wants to talk to you.” Harry elbowed Ron, who snickered.
“She doesn’t feel the same. I just wanted to test it, and she’s one of my closest friends, so I convinced her to kiss me. She’s boy crazy, she just thinks it was a silly thing we did.”
Hermione stood, then gave Ron her hand to help him up. “Draco’s lucky he changed his tune,” Ron said. “I’d kill him otherwise.”
Honeydukes, though not bustling with Hogwarts students, was suitably busy to allow Draco to slip out and act as though he had been there the whole time. He perused the candies, picking out sugar quills and, at a poke on the shoulder from Harry, some fudge.
Draco took a moment, and Harry could see the gears turning in his head. “I could always stay here. I don’t think most of our year will want to be inside. It’s Christmas.”
“Okay. How do you make a fist?” Draco set down his wand and showed him. “See, you can’t keep your thumb inside your fist, that’s how you break it. You keep it outside of your fist.”
“Boys!” They jumped apart to see Professor Lupin running at them. “What’s going on?”
“We think our friend might have been hasty in his behavior, and we want to fix it,” she continued.
“No!”
“What do they eat?”
“Really! There’s plenty of guys around!” Ron added, incredulous.
The rest of the Slytherins murmured a greeting in response. Lupin grinned at them, not unkindly, and showed them the dresser he was standing in front of. “For our first lesson, I thought we could do something hands-on.” The dresser jumped and shook, and Draco sat straight-up in his seat. “Can anyone tell me what we have here?”
As far as Quidditch went, the nicer weather meant practice was more tolerable, a necessary thing now that Wood was obsessing more than usual. They had a chance. They had a chance, a Firebolt, and they could beat Slytherin.
“She hasn’t missed any of ours, right?” Harry asked. It was hard to tell now that they weren’t talking, but he was certain she was always there.
“Right. Ignore that.” He let out a soft exhale as Pansy gently pulled back the hair falling onto his forehead. “He’s got an annoying voice.”
Draco rubbed the back of his neck and Harry suddenly felt guilty. “Right. Sorry. Well, I’ve got an essay to work on. Get back to your friends.”
At the end of the day, they walked to the Great Hall together, where Drao pulled them aside. “What’s the matter?” Harry asked, doing his best to cover that he was talking kindly to Draco in public.
“You don't know!?”
Lupin examined him, and Draco pulled back into his chair. “I know that Hogwarts can be tough. Sometimes, you find friends and your years here are easy. Sometimes, you don’t. It can be incredibly lonely here.” Lupin was somewhere else, and Draco took this moment to search his face. The lines on his face and the gray in his hair seemed so much more prominent than usually; generally, he only looked tired. Now, though, he looked old despite his age.
“I know. It’s spectacular. Fred and George showed me this passage, by the one statue, you know the witch?” Draco nodded. “Right. There’s a tunnel, going right into Honeydukes. From there I went with Ron and Hermione.”
“Right.” He watched Draco stride away. He wasn’t quite sure what they were, or if they were anything. He wasn’t even sure if he wanted them to be anything. The thought of Draco staying back to spend the day with him did give him an odd, not entirely unpleasant feeling in his stomach.
“Very close. It’s hard to be fearless. It’s much easier to be amused. The spell we use is Riddikulus, and you must think of something funny. I’m sure you’ve heard about what happened in one of the other Defense Against the Dark Arts classes?” How could they have not. Longbottom was a disgrace in every sense of the word, and it was unbelievable that he had dressed up a Snape look-a-like in his grandmother’s clothes.
“They won’t tell anyone,” Harry reassured. Guilt gnawed at his stomach, and he said, “I’m sorry. I didn’t think you’d care.”
Blaise stared at him, then, slowly, ripped his essay in half. “I knew my father. I’ll talk to you tomorrow. Try to be less of a dick.”
Ron shrugged. “The Purebloods are a bit touchy about it because they’re stuck up about everything. I can’t imagine the Malfoys being okay with their precious son going around snogging boys.”
Draco jumped as a loud crash sounded through the hall. “Stay here,” Filch growled, and Draco and Potter looked at each other before watching him limp out of the room.
“You’re such a drama queen, Potter,” Draco replied.
“You kissed me!”
“Obviously.”
Hello everybody! Sorry this took a hot second, but here's another chapter. Please tell me what you think, and I hope I'll be back soon.
“Riddikulus!” Lupin yelled, and the dementor fled back to the dresser in the shape of a deflating balloon. He knelt next to Harry and put a hand on his shoulder. “Eat this. Until you feel better,” he said, pushing a chocolate bar into Harry’s hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
Potter shrugged. “I always woke up whenever anyone went downstairs. Sometimes my uncle would have to leave early for work.”
“I obviously wouldn’t bring a dementor here. Professor Dumbledore already banned them from the grounds, but it would be too draining for practice. However, for you to do the charm without stress acting on you would be pointless. Instead, we will use the boggart.”
“Quidditch practice!” Potter spluttered, and soon words were spilling out of his mouth. “Professor McGonagall, please, we’ve been practicing everyday, and Oliver will kill me if-”
“Does it matter if I kissed Daphne? And don’t say ‘of course’ because you think it was a one-time thing. What if I only ever kissed girls? What if I only wanted to kiss girls and the thought of being with a boy disgusts me? What if my parents wanting me to settle down with a man repulses me and makes me want to run away? What if that was the case? Would it matter?”
“Yeah, and Draco followed him.”
“I’ll whistle for them, and you two just help me feed them.”
“I won’t force you to do anything,” Harry replied. “Just… Next Hogsmeade trip, maybe we should actually go somewhere together and be civil. We could even bring Hermione?” Ron didn’t respond, but made a wishy-washy gesture.
“Most?”
“I don't know.”
“Us?”
“Listen to the mudblood,” Draco said with a grin.
“What if we just show up and use our Slytherin charm to talk the Ministry out of going through with it?” Pansy batted her eyelashes and put her chin on the intersection of her fingers. “After all, that’s what got us into this mess.”
“And next Hogsmeade trip, we can all stay around Harry,” Hermione said.
“I guess I don’t hate him,” Harry replied.
Guilt hit Harry like a ton of bricks. It wasn’t the same for him. Last year, everyone had hated him, and the Dursleys couldn’t possibly think less of him. As much as he would prefer nobody knew to avoid the trouble, he would survive. What would happen to Draco? What about his family?
“You fought off the wizard who blew up eleven people?” Blaise asked.
“We’re all worried about Harry,” Hermione said slowly. Harry was beginning to regret things more. “Maybe we can all work together.”
Ron and Hermione exchanged a look. “What?”
“How do you do it?”
“That was one time.”
“Harry, mate, please kick his ass. I don’t care how you do it, just win.”
“Right,” Blaise said in a tone that suggested he wasn’t quite prepared to drop it.
“Eugh. I see why you let me in first, there’s spiderwebs everywhere,” Draco muttered, wiping at the air in front of him, then at his chest. Neither of them were in their uniforms today, but Draco was still wearing immaculate robes. Harry, in a hand-me-down shirt, pair of pants, and pair of shoes, shrugged.
“I’m busy.”
Blaise hummed an acknowledgment but didn’t say anything else. They were at the door to the common room. Draco turned to face Blaise. “Thanks for walking me back, I guess.”
A ladder had been set up so they could reach the awards higher up on the shelves and walls. “I’ll handle those ones if you do the bottom,” Potter said, running his hand through his hair. Merlin, Draco wanted to run his fingers through it.
Then, they heard the door open. Then, they heard an axe swinging, and something slice open. Hermione covered her mouth, and Ron looked up in horror. Slowly, one hand still gripped tightly around a struggling Scabbers, he reached out to hold Hermione. And Harry leaned against Ron’s shoulder.
Wide-eyed, Hagrid pushed the Gryffindors together and Harry covered them with the invisibility cloak as Fudge could be heard saying, “On with it, Professor, I have other meetings to attend to.”
“It was funny.”
“I’m never scared!”
“Good evening, Mr. Malfoy,” McGonagall said. “I heard your detention with Professor Lupin went well yesterday. I hope you can continue that streak. Tonight will be the same as Monday night. Please behave.”
“You always find the Snitch. It’s good strategy to keep close to you.”
Ahaha.... I'm posting this instead of studying for my physics final, which is tomorrow and I need to get a 100 on to get a B-. I love you all. Thank you for the comments. Until next time~
"Where are we heading to anyway? The Leaky Cauldron?" Potter tapped his wand against the door knob and they could hear a soft
“It’s no use, my dear boy. Have you used a charm yet?”
*~*DMHP*~*
I choked. “What?”
Warning: Angst
Warm hands grabbed his trembling ones. His head jerked up and he saw brown eyes look at him encouragingly. Hermione smiled. “Everything will be alright,” she said, her eyes never leaving his frightened ones. “You’re not alone.”
and it had been
So, taking a deep breath, he slowly reached inside his own cloak. The Muggle flinched at the same moment as his fingers touched the smooth surface of the wood. It felt like ages. His fingers wrapped securely around the thin handle, his arm moving backwards, pulling the magical item out with it. Lucius scurried to the wall to his left, Voldemort was waiting on his right. His eyes never left the bleeding girl on the floor, who was once again pleading mercy, this time vocally.

We had to choose a pairing name and I ended up with Ginny and Dean.
"I bet that you won't accomplish getting Harry Potter into your bed and my story onto front page!" Pansy Parkinson smirked at Draco Malfoy, who had his raised cup of tea near his mouth.
“You heard my question, Harry. Why did you come back when I specifically told you not to?”
What if this wonderful, brave man behind this door didn’t want him anymore? The last time he had seen him had been when he had jumped up from the ground, proving everyone that Harry Potter didn’t just
It was nearing 7.30 pm now.
Draco took a deep breath to keep from shivering. This was wrong. This was so wrong. What was he thinking just going along with it? He could’ve been at Harry’s side right now if he had just stayed.
"Depends on whether you'd think of them as important."
I froze. I couldn’t blink or swallow or move or
*~*HP*~*
“I said let them. I know their behaviour is wrong, but I understand it. Really, I do. Just try and put yourself into their position,” he added as the green eyes continued to look at him with a mix of wonder and confusion. “If you’d be in their place and have a friend of yours suddenly go out with, let’s say, Nott,” Harry cringed and Draco grinned suggestively, “you’d think there was something fishy about it, wouldn’t you? And if you’d want to find every evil on this planet and truly think you could use that connection between the good side and the evil side that so conveniently presented itself to you, wouldn’t you want to make use of it as well?”
Draco shook his head slowly, trying to take it all in. Well, it didn’t surprise him if he was completely honest with himself. They truly believed him to still be a follower of the now thankfully dead evil wizard, so it was only logical for them to want to use that link they thought still existed between him and the dark side. He got it but if he had gotten better in something after the war it was self-control and the sense of self-worth. He still remembered the first few days after the war, being battered with guild, both emotional and physical pain and, the worst of all, longing for safety, comfort and love. Being accepted as himself was something he hadn’t been used to and still struggled with.
Harry frowned. “And why didn’t you tell him? Or me for that matter?”

Blinking, confused, Draco took a deep breath to remark that he hadn’t even said anything when a pair of soft lips took every bit of left-over oxygen out of his system, kissing him into unconsciousness. The slightly chapped lips moved against his, kissing him softly, lovingly, yet with a hidden strength and desperation that Draco did not dare to pull back, as he cautiously lifted his right arm and pushed his fingers into that soft, tangled mess the other called hair.
he! How dare he give Harry hope for something more than friendship and talk about him like that behind his back! Harry deserved everything and more; how dare he use him like that! She had
A sob escaped him and he fastened his pace.
, friends for having someone they could count on, someone who accepted them with all of their mistakes which Weasley was still full of. He had hurt back then and unlike then he hadn’t had his boyfriend’s loving words, gently touches and sweet kisses. He had had no one to heal his wounds back in the day.
am I supposed to get oysters from when it's two in the bloody morning? And by seven o'clock she yelled at me for even considering getting her some because she wasn't allowed to eat them anyway. I mean… Where's the logic behind that?" He shook his head and Harry had to bite back a laugh at how utterly confused his best friend looked.
She took a deep breath as she felt her fingers start to tingle. It would do her no good if she were to lose control of her magic at this moment. She needed all of her strength to properly hex him after he had admitted to treason. “Don’t act all innocent,
"No," the blond moaned and squeezed his eyes shut. It was too dangerous! He didn't want them here, especially not him. He could get hurt, or worse killed, and all because of him! He wasn't worth it! Harry had to get out of here and leave as quickly as possible!
If he was really being honest with himself—he was afraid of the answer to that question.
"Way too long." She pulled away and held him at arms' length. "You look good, darling!"
Hurried footsteps carried them into the dark shadows of the woods near the mansion. The massive building loomed over them, making them feel threatened and isolated. The weather didn’t help much either.
"Harry! We've got to get out of here! We barely managed to get rid of them. They've swarmed out and are looking for you," Ron panted and leant down to pick the raven-haired wizard up off the floor.
“WHERE IS HE? I SAW HIM RUNNING IN HERE!”
It wasn’t as if Potter would be the one writing that letter. He just couldn’t imagine the boy-wonder sitting down in front of the fire, the flames warming up his slight figure as he hunched down over a piece of parchment, his falcon quill in his right hand, a pot of ink on the floor next to him...
“He did what?”
“Draco,” Ginny huffed and pushed against one of Dean’s feet that was currently digging uncomfortably into her stomach. “Would you please move, Dean? Your foot is in my stomach.”
! You know how all these rumours go about that Potter's a poof?"
Grumbling, I turned around and buried my face into the softest pillow I could find. It smelled fresh, like flowers and air. I smiled happily and started to drift slowly back to sleep. The edges of my consciousness became fuzzy, my focus on the nearly forgotten dream of one black-haired wizard lying at the shore of the Black Lake, with only a pair of swim trunks on…
“We’ll go,” Hermione said, and she grabbed Ron’s hand.
Ah, you may have noticed I was functionally dead. Over winter break, my laptop broke, and then the spring semester started and I was doing 6 classes with work on top. Mandatory quarantine has given me a lot of free time. Have two chapters today as a treat :). I hope I will have time to update semi-regularly. Until next time~
“Feeling nervous yet?” Harry asked, taking a step toward Draco.
Dean had once again drawn a large banner with the crest of Gryffindor skillfully drawn in the center. Hermione had helped him jinx it to roar every few minutes. At breakfast, Harry was surrounded by teammates and friends all excitedly discussing what was to come. He caught Draco’s eye, nodded at his motion to escape the Great Hall, and relied on Ron and Hermione to keep anyone from finding him.
Four tanks sat on the table in front of them. “I’ll take those two, you take the other ones?”
