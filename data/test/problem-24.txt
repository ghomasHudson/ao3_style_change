Severus slowly opened the doors of the wardrobe and found Harry curled on the floor, his blanket wrapped around him as if to protect his head and back. As light shone into the wardrobe, his head came up. His eyes were wide and startled, his face red and streaked with tears. He was breathing heavy, almost hyperventilating.
“How bad?” Severus’s eye glittered in the torchlight as he quickly thought over Lupin’s reaction. Perhaps Severus could use Lupin again the Headmaster, as he did Minerva and Madam Pomfrey. Having more people between Harry and the headmaster would be all for the better, no matter who they were. Severus was willing to sacrifice almost anyone to protect his son.
“I think I would like to call you Father, if that is okay.” Harry murmured into Severus's shoulder. Severus nodded, and stopped in front of a large painting. Harry looked up at the painting. Standing in the middle of the painting was an austere man in a long green robe with silver trim. The man in the painting looked at Severus, and then at Harry.
“People will think that the Promised King has to do certain things, or act a certain way, in order to be what they think he should be. In order for them to believe that he is the Promised King. If he doesn't act that way, or do those things, they may say nasty things about him.” Harry thought about it for a minute, but didn’t really look less confused. Severus sighed. He was sure that Harry would understand when he was a little older, and explanations could be more in depth.
“I have the coolest best friend ever!” Severus and Harry smiled at each other as they came out of the Floo, and Severus lead Harry over to the table where dinner was waiting.
Narcissa spoke with the parents of some of the kids who had been at the Yule celebration, and more children started to spend time at the manor. Theo and Blaise started attending lessons with Draco and Harry, specifically the dancing and sword fighting and manners lessons, what Narcissa called “etiquette” lessons. Harry liked being around other kids, but was always worried about them being mean the way that his cousin and his cousin’s friends had been at his Uncle’s house. Harry couldn’t make his brain stop thinking about them. He started having issues focusing on having fun around them, and worried about saying the right things all the time and only playing on the edges, spending more time watching them and Draco play unless they specifically pulled him in.
“I feel that you should know that almost all of Draco's animated toys treat young Harry like he is the Pied Piper and they are the rats. It's rather stunning to watch. “ Lucius nodded, distracted.
For as long as he could remember, Harry had known that he needed to be as quiet as possible and take up as little space as he could. Take up too much space, and Uncle Vernon would get angry and yell and sometimes hit upside the head. Make too much noise, and Aunt Petunia would hiss at him that he was drawing too much attention and pinch him on the under side of his arms. As soon as Uncle Vernon got home, she would tell him that 'The boy had been acting out." and then Uncle Vernon would get mad. Either way, Harry knew to stay quiet and small and not argue with anything. Like when all he was given to wear was Dudley's too big clothing, or when his aunt made him sleep on the floor with only the very thin blanket that had been his since he was a baby. Sometimes he dreamed of a woman with red hair  singing to him softly or a man with messy hair and glasses making him laugh. Harry already knew at his young age that dreams weren’t real.
“Have a child, my father said. Carry on the family line, my father said. I never would have…” Lucius’s complaining devolved into muttering. Narcissa laughed and left the room, heading to see if Severus needed help getting the chocolate off the boys. Remus excused himself, wanting to do his own research about the Arthur myth and any other information he could find. Forewarned was forearmed in his opinion. He also wanted to check and see if there was any information about this prophesy regarding Voldemort and Harry. He had almost no experience with young children, and was worried that every time Harry was around him, he was uncomfortable. Remus wanted nothing more than to have the kind of comfortable relationship with Harry that Severus did. The first thing that he needed to remember was to STOP mentioning difficult topics around Harry.
“I finally get to see him again, guys. I get to help take care of Harry. I promise, I will take care of him, as much as I can.” Lupin thought over what he had learned from his meeting with Albus and subsequent meeting with Madam Pomfrey. Albus had been all smiles, happy that he was able to offer Remus a place to live and employment, as well as a safe place and access to the Wolfsbane Potion. Remus had heard of the potion, but had no way of obtaining it to see if it really did what advertisements said or if it was just a quick way to poison and dispose of those with the lycanthropy curse.
“My dear friends, the story I have to tell you...” and he told them everything. He told them how he had mended fences with his childhood friend, and what happened when he was asked to check on the child of that friend.  Lucius was angry at the thought of any magical child having been mistreated so terribly by Muggles, but Narcissa was irate as a mother that ANY child have to go through being abused. By the end of his tale, Severus was explaining how Draco had shown up and startled his new son with his demands and all three adults had drinks that a house elf had brought.
“Harry, would you be okay meeting my friends tomorrow for lunch? I know that they are very excited to meet you, and I think that you and Draco could become very good friends. Once you get to know each other better, of course.” Harry watched Severus thoughtfully.
Severus stepped out into his home and went to his office, grabbing one of his books on complicated potions and going to Harry's room. Harry was sprawled on the middle of the bed, half covered and unconscious. Severus smiled and rearranged Harry so he was covered again. Severus sat down in the chair he normally read in and began to read on possible ways to help save his son.
Severus looked around the room, and thought that it looked much better than it used to. He also thought that it was missing something. He realized what it was, and snapped his fingers.
“And are you going to be discussing more... recent history?” Lucius's voice was mild, but Narcissa knew that there were layers to Lucius's question. He wanted to know if Severus had warned her off talking about the Dark Lord. Narcissa narrowed her eyes at Lucius, who pointedly ignored it and continued to eat while he waited for an answer. Draco continued to eat, punctuating his lunch with comments about magical animals that his mom had told him about earlier. Harry...
“This was given to me shortly before the Dark Lord fell. This is why I knew that the Dark Lord wasn't gone for good. This... is a Horcrux.”
To all the people who have written reviews: Thank you. They mean more than I can possibly say. I never thought that I would be able to write something this long, or amazing even to myself. The more reviews, the more I have inspiration to keep writing.
Oh my gosh, I can't believe the amazing support that I am getting from you guys! I mean, as you know, this is my first fan fiction... In fact, it's the first story that I have ever written that has been longer than a couple of pages. I have put so much heart into making sure that this story is perfect and amazing, and I couldn't do it without all this support.
“I wanted to tell you first hand before you heard it from anyone else, especially after Draco's unexpected visit this evening. I have adopted a child, a young man around Draco's age.” Lucius' mouth dropped open and Narcissa's eyes widened comically. Severus internally smirked at having left two of the most composed people he knew gawping. If his first announcement left them startled, he was about to break their composure completely with his second. “That child... is Harry Potter.”
“I am sure that they would be willing to listen, but it might be hard for them to understand.” Severus sighed. “I don’t think any of them have been through anything like that.”
“Tippy, this is my son, Harry. You are going to be spending the days with him while I am teaching. You are to make sure that he has activities to occupy his attention, and make sure that his meals are delivered at the appropriate times. He is also not to leave the chambers unless I say so.  Is this understood?” Tippy nodded. Harry turned a little red, shy at having been introduced as Severus's son.
“He’s adjusting as well as one can expect, given his previous situation.” Severus certainly wasn’t going to inform the Headmaster that his son was brilliant and soaking up as much as he could like a sponge, nor of how magically powerful his son was. Especially considering that Harry was more powerful than the two of them combined.
Severus and Harry arrived much later that afternoon. Severus's pockets were full of bags shrunk down with items for both Harry and his new companion, who Harry had decided to name Shadow. Shadow was riding in a carrier, and Severus took both Harry and Shadow through the school without a thought to the student population. He ignored the looks from student and staff alike as they made their way back to their rooms. Once there, Severus took the bags out of his pockets and returned them to their original size. Before he released Shadow out of his carrier, he placed it on the dining room table and sat on a chair in front of him.
“Yes please.” Severus smiled at his pun and pulled out his wand. He tapped a pattern onto the stones and stood back as the stones began to rearrange themselves into the archway.
“When I found Harry, he was sleeping outside in the cold. He had only a threadbare blanket that hardly covered him, and it was soaked with urine.” Severus sighed and watched Remus carefully. He wanted to be sure that he wasn’t putting himself in a room with an angry werewolf. Being in the room with a placid werewolf was hard enough on his nerves. “I… I need you to know a few things in regards to Harry. The first of which is that Lily and I mended fences before she passed. We didn’t tell anyone because we knew she was a target, but she asked me, should anything happen to her, that I would watch out for Harry. I intend to keep my word.” Remus nodded. It didn’t surprise him, given Lily’s kind nature, that she wouldn’t hold a grudge from school forever. What did surprise him was that Severus stayed friends with her, given that Remus knew about Severus’s ties to Voldemort.
“Harry, before we get started, I would like to check and see how far your previous education brought you.” She went over to one of the bookshelves and pulled out a book. She handed it to Harry. It wasn't something he had ever seen before, and there was a dragon and a unicorn on the cover. “Harry, please read the first page of this book out loud.” Harry opened the book to the first page.
Severus came to pick up Harry after his afternoon classes were completed for the day. For the first time since Harry had come to stay with him, Harry was chattering about his day, very similar to how Draco was normally. Severus smiled in bemusement and nodded so Harry knew that he was listening. Draco chattered right next to him, adding in things that he thought that Harry might have forgotten.
Draco wrapped up his story as his mother came into the room. As hyper as Draco was, he knew that his mother was very no nonsense when it came to school work. She had no problem taking away his favorite things if he didn't pay attention to his studies.
Mordred hated how compassionate Arthur was, seeing it as weakness. Mordred brought his soldiers to fight against King Arthur. Now, Arthur had been granted a magical sword from the Lady in the Lake called Excalibur along with a scabbard that would protect him from all harm. The Lady was believed to the  Queen of the Fae races. But Arthur, in his depression, forgot the scabbard when he left to fight Mordred one on one. This was his downfall, as in the fight Arthur was gravely injured while slaying the traitor Mordred.
“Off. I am going to help you out today, just to make sure that you know what you are doing. If you don't want me in here from now on, and I know that you can do it yourself, then I will let you bathe alone.” Harry nodded and began unbuttoning his pajama top. He got undressed and let Severus help him get into the bathtub. Harry giggled at the sensations of the bubbles, and let Severus wash his hair with some very nice smelling shampoo and conditioner and helped him wash the rest of him.
“Can she safely be around other people without biting them? I cannot condone you having a serpent as a… friend if she is a danger to others. Or Shadow.” Harry hissed, and the tiny serpent fluttered her little wings, which were almost dry, as she hissed back.
“In regards that that, Draco, I have one thing to say. And you will obey this period end of story.” Draco looked at his mother. He knew that when she used that tone of voice that there was no wiggle room. “This will NOT be discussed with ANYONE outside of this room and Severus. You can discuss the fact that you are friends with Harry, but nothing about wandless magic.” Draco nodded, completely serious.
“Well, Harry, it seems that you learned from your previous classes quite well. I am very impressed!.” Harry smiled shyly, and Narcissa was charmed at how sweet he was. Narcissa turned to the chalkboard and began to tell the boys the story of the beginning of magic. The chalk rose from the ledge and began to draw the pictures of the story, moving as the story continued.
“Oh… no, I didn’t. It just sounds like regular words. Do you think that there is a snake inside the egg?” Severus took the basket from Harry’s hands and set it down next to the chair. Then he took Harry’s hands in his and looked Harry in the face.
Having the rest of the day to take care of Harry put Severus in a wonderful mood. The first thing that he did after speaking with Minerva was call the Hospital Wing through the Floo and see if Madam Pomfrey was available to check on Harry. There was a student that was being treated for and allergic reaction to the nifflers in the Care of Magical Creatures class, but the student was shortly released and the mediwitch came through the Floo.
“Lucius... said that you were going to learn wandless magic.” Severus said quietly. He now had an idea of what Lucius wanted to speak with him about. A child as young as Harry, before his magic matured, showing potential for wandless magic, was improbable. Some might say impossible. But Lucius wasn't the type to have said anything unless it was true. Severus was able to do to small wandless magics, but had only been able to start practicing after he was an adult and his magic was fully matured.
“Yes. Lucius altered the wards so he can’t leave, but we need to find him before he hurts Harry.” Remus nodded, and began to move down the stairs, tracking the scent of his pack mate, his cub. He knew Severus wouldn't appreciate that he thought of Harry like that, but he was there when Harry was born and his wolf wouldn't think of him any other way.
“I would be more than happy to. Harry, please come in.” Remus opened the door wider, and Harry stepped in, followed by the cat. Severus lingered for a moment.
The first picture that Severus pointed out was his own, and then that Harry's picture was below it. “Since you were adopted by magic, and this book magically updates, you now show on the Prince family tree as my son.” He then moved up to the picture above his, which had a line drawn to a blank outline of a person. “This is my mother, Eileen Prince. She was an only child, and married a Muggle man. That is why the picture is blank, because the book couldn't update information for someone who had no magic themselves.” Harry didn't know anything about magic, but he thought that it sounded like it made sense.
Severus went back into Harry's room to find him curled up on his bed, the giant dragon behind him and the little dragon figurine on the bed in front of him. Harry had found a ribbon somewhere, and was dangling it along so that the little dragon could chase and pounce on it.
Also, just a note, Albus doesn't THINK that he's doing wrong. HE knows where best to use the support of the House of Potter. For the Greater Good (TM) and all. Gods, he makes me mad though.
“Harry, I need to go to my lab for a little while. Would you be okay spending time with Remus? I don’t think that he has anyone else to spend Christmas with, and I know he would like to see you.” Harry studied Severus’s face for a moment.
“Harry James Potter, do you swear on your blood and your magic to accept Severus Tobias Snape as your father? To be protected and guided by him in the ways of magic and life?” Harry swallowed.
“A little bit like that. But more like… if you met your cousin when you were an adult, would you still think that he was spoiled and a bully?” Harry nodded, making a face. He was getting better about talking about the Dursley’s, but he still disliked it when they were brought up.
“Severus, calm down. We aren’t going to be able to find him by panicking. Do you know how long he was gone?” Remus had never seen Severus like this. Severus was pacing, his face pinched and worried. Remus knew that Severus cared about Harry, but he now knew that Severus had taken on the role of Harry’s father with all of his being.
“I know that it’s very late, but do you think that you could show me where you found her, before we continue our rest for the night?” Harry nodded and stood up, turning towards the door until Severus put a hand on his shoulder.
He remembered last night that there were chairs and a couch in the middle of the living room last night, but the living room looked different now. The couch and chairs were still there, but they seemed to have been shifted to the side of the living room. On the other side of the living room there was now a table for eating meals at, and his new father was sitting at it. He was sipping from a cup and reading a paper, but he set the paper aside as he noticed Harry lingering in the doorway.
“Harry, on the other hand, won't barely say anything. I am hoping that the two of them rub off on each other.”
Lucius took a deep breath. It was a big risk, but it made sense.  With the death of Lily Potter nee Evans, any loyalty that Severus had felt for the Dark Lord had been smothered in rage and hatred.  Before he could say anything or accept, Narcissa stepped in.
“Is... is there anything that you would like me to clean or any chores you want me to do while you are out today, Father. Or any work that needs doing?” Severus smiled sadly. This was going to take longer than he thought, and he made another mental note.
Tippy hadn't moved from the doorway of Harry's room, and was pulling on her ears. Severus knew that was her habit when she was worried.
“Master Snape! Master Snape!!” Tippy popped into the Potions classroom, startling the second year class that was getting ready to start their potions. He heard a crash as one of the students dropped something in the supply closet, but he didn't care. The second years weren't working with anything volatile, and Harry was more important. Severus was out from behind the desk and moving towards his office.
“I went to bed around 11 after I finished scoring the midterms. I woke up at quarter to 2, so sometime in the 2 hours and 45 minutes that I was sleeping Harry vanished. And Shadow is missing as well, but I don’t know if that’s a good thing or just happenstance, since the cat seems to be able to get where ever he damn well pleases.” Severus was almost yelling at this point, scared for Harry. He was getting ready to start laying out search plans when the door to the chamber quietly opened.
He got to 100 on the last step, and in front of him was a large wooden door with carvings all over it. Shadow appeared to be waiting for him, and Harry took a minute to look closely at the door. It was almost like a story. There was a sword being held out of a lake, four people standing in a circle holding hands, a snake and what Harry remembered was a griffon, holding the snake in it’s claws. There were lots of symbols around the outside of the door, and in the middle was a picture of an island with a crown hovering over it. Almost feeling like he was still sleeping or walking through water, Harry walked up to the door and touched the picture in the middle, right over the crown and the island. A moment later, the door opened with a soft click.
Lucius's mind was racing a mile a minute. He thought back to when Narcissa had been talking the other evening. He recalled what she had said about the toys following Harry, and how he could feel minor healing magic. Having perfect recall was a skill that he was very careful to keep close to his chest. But he knew that the amount of power that Harry had was only going to grow as he got older, and that was almost a terrifying thought. He knew now that just aside from supporting Harry as his family, he would support Harry to help him become both powerful and responsible. Knowledgeable in people, and manipulations, so that his power would never be taken advantage of. Not by the Dark Lord, or Dumbledore. He knew that he was going to have to speak with Narcissa and Severus as soon as possible. He also knew that he was going to have to do some research to see if there was any history of wandless magic being used in someone so young.
Harry and Draco woke the next morning, their energy and high spirits returned as it was Christmas Eve. The boys chattered over breakfast about the other children, and the adults exchanged relieved looks that neither of them showed lingering effects from the previous evening. Draco and Harry went to go play, and the adults lingered over their coffee and discussed what had happened when Rowle had taken Harry. Narcissa hadn’t been there when Harry had dispensed “judgment” on Rowle, and when Severus and Lucius described it, she got a thoughtful look on her face.
“I know that you and my father don’t get along. And I know that you guys went to school together. And that you had a friend, who was a bully, and you let him bully Father.” Remus sighed against the pain of being reminded of Sirius. His greatest mistake. The man who he once thought was his best friend. Remus swallowed against the lump in his throat.
“I told Aunt Cissy about my aunt and uncle, and how… they were mean to me. And hurt me. It made her sad, but she seemed to want me to tell her. I didn’t mean to make her sad.” Now Severus understood why Narcissa wanted privacy. It would have been easier to get Harry to leech some of the nastiness of his past out if he wasn’t interrupted.
“Harry! I am SO glad that you are here! Do you like dragons? I have lots of dragons in my room! You should come with me and see!” Draco jumped off the couch and ran over to Harry. He grabbed Harry by the hand, and before Harry could say anything Draco was pulling him towards the door.
Late the following morning, Severus looked at Harry's head in dismay. He hadn't thought about it the past few days, but Harry's hair was AWFUL. No matter what Severus did, it stuck out in every direction as if Harry had been crawling through bushes. Severus sighed.
The journal went back into the safe, and the two men went back to the reception room. They started to discuss how to destroy the Horcrux without hurting Harry. After an hour and a half, they hadn't figured out anything. Severus shook his head.
“Draco, love, perhaps we can go a little slower. Harry's only been with his father a couple of days, he's still settling in. “ Narcissa patted Draco on the shoulder.
“I don’t want you to spend time around Mr. Lupin because I don’t trust him. He reminds me of all the terrible parts of being in school. But he was a very good friend to your parents, and it’s important that you develop your own opinions about people based on how they treat you and your feelings about them.” Harry chewed on his lower lip.
Lucius thought over what Severus had told him. There was something at the edge of his memory, something darker than Dark. He took a sip, then froze as the memory shot to the front of his mind. His face grew pale as he quickly processed the implications. He hadn't been lying when he told Harry that he thought of them as family. Lucius stood quickly and motioned for Severus to follow him.
“Hello Harry. Did you enjoy your Christmas treats?” Harry nodded his head vigorously. His hair, which was growing out and was quite shaggy around his face now, flew around his face and pieces got stuck in the chocolate. Narcissa stifled a giggle, and Remus grinned. “That’s good. I’m glad to see that you are feeling better. Last night was scary for all of us.” Harry bit his lip and his gaze fell to the floor. Severus glared at Remus again, almost as if blaming him for ruining Harry’s mood. Severus conjured a washcloth and began to gently wash Harry’s face, realized that Harry also had chocolate on his neck, and tickled him.
“You never have to worry about being in trouble for something you didn't know, or something that you didn't have control over. If you do something that you know you aren't supposed to, I will ALWAYS talk to you about it. I promise.” He could feel that Harry was starting to cuddle against him for comfort, and that he had stopped crying. Severus lifted Harry into his arms and sat down on the side of his bed.
“Harry, there is going to be a party in a couple of days. There will be a large number of people here. Some of them still feel... they still believe in the man who killed your parents. You don't have to attend, but there will be some children your own age attending. I thought you might enjoy meeting them.” Harry gave him a serious look,  as if he was trying to gauge if Severus wanted him to go to the party or not. Severus continued. “If you do go, there are a number of things that you will not be able to talk about with anyone. The Founder's Rooms, for example, and wand less magic, or being able to speak with serpents.” Harry gave Severus his old man look, old beyond his years.
“He's very near-sighted, but nothing that I can't fix. We may need to do it again when he gets older, if it's degenerative, but I wouldn't worry about it.” She subtly waved her wand again, and Harry stopped following the light. He blinked a couple of times, and then smiled at Severus and Poppy from across the room.
“You would be dead many times over if not for that man. I would not have been able to have Draco, and if by some miracle I had been able to carry him to term, he would have been sickly and weak if not for his skills. We WILL be standing by him, end of story.” Lucius had learned the hard way not to cross his wife. She had the famous Black temper, and he knew that he would give anything to not get on the wrong side of it or her wand. He would have stood by Severus either way, but he might have looked for an advantageous angle for himself.
“I can look into it. Can you tell me why?” Harry looked scared for a minute, like he was worried about talking about it.
Thank you very much for all of the WONDERFUL comments. Your love is my drive to keep writing. I am sorry if this chapter seems a little short compared to others, I wanted to share this meeting before there was rioting.
“Lupin. I hear you are to be the Headmaster’s newest charity case. Have you grown tired of sleeping in alleys and halfway homes?” Lupin merely looked at him calmly, not rising to Severus’s goading. Severus never knew if it was because Lupin had no pride, or because he felt guilty for almost killing him when they were students.
“I am feeling fine, ma’am.” Harry said as quietly and politely as he could. “Please, where am I?” Madam Pomfrey smiled.
Severus couldn't hold back any longer. The warmth that he had shared when he adopted Harry had eroded some of his icy demeanor, and he felt a fondness for his closest friends welling  up inside him. These composed and careful friends of his, who had been through hell at his side. A chuckle started in his throat and grew until it was full throated laughter.
“My… feelings about Remus are complicated. We went to school together, and didn’t get along very well. One of Remus’s friends was a bully, like Dudley, and he was very mean to me.”
“My apologies, Minerva, I didn’t have the chance to get out of your way when you stepped out.” Minerva blinked in surprise, not only at Severus’ presence but also at his politeness. Severus was well known for being especially venomous when surprised. Then her eyes narrowed in suspicion.
“I agree, it does sound heroic. But being a hero is hard, it’s a lot of work, and training. And people have… expectations.” Harry looked confused at the large word. Severus thought for a moment about how to explain this to someone so young.
Severus checked the rest of their chambers, including his lab which he knew Harry wasn’t supposed to go into, and then tried not to panic as he called the best person to help search through the Floo. He might dislike the fact that the werewolf was in Harry's life, but in this situation it would be useful to have the increased sense of smell. But most of all, Remus wouldn't let Albus know that Harry was missing.
Albus Dumbledore looked around his office at Hogwarts with smug satisfaction. It had been 5 years since the end of the second Wizarding war, and everything was going to plan. Voldemort had been defeated, just like Grindlewald had been, and Albus now had the reputation of being the Leader of the Light for two Wizarding wars. Yes, there had been losses, but the ends had justified the means. And in case of resurgence in Death Eaters or the rise of another Dark Lord, Albus had tucked away the orphaned Harry Potter as his ace in the hole. Albus smiled to himself and leaned back in his chair, looking across the room at Fawkes dozing on his perch.
“No, thank you. For letting me spend time with him. He’s welcome here anytime.” Severus nodded, and reminded Harry that they still had Christmas dinner. Harry handed the book back to Remus.
As Harry squirmed and wondered how long he was going to have to wait to go to the bathroom, he heard the front door open and his uncle announce to the house that he was home from work. Harry tried to control his breathing and make himself as quiet as possible. As he listened for what was going on outside his door, he heard his aunt talking to his uncle about him. He couldn’t hear much, but he heard “Pushed” and “Bruised” and knew that no matter how quiet he was, things were going to get bad. His stomach started to ache with the familiar tension that happened every time that he knew he was in trouble.
Had had made his way about halfway across the room on the third shelf when he started to hear a buzzing, almost like the hum of bees. He looked around the room, but didn't see anything. He continued to dust the books on the shelf. The buzzing got louder, and Harry turned to look around the room again, looking for something that could be making the noise, but couldn't see anything. The buzzing continued to get louder and louder until with a bang one of the books shot off the shelf and began ricocheting around the room at high speed.
“We are going to be traveling by magical means. It will be easier for you if I carry you. Okay?” Harry nodded, and Severus picked Harry up and propped him on his hip. “This might be a little uncomfortable. It will get easier in time, I promise.” Severus took a breath, and Apparated.
“Harry, please, are you hurt?” Harry shook his head, unable to speak around the tears. “Please come out. You aren't in trouble, I am just worried about you.” Harry climbed out of the wardrobe, and Severus immediately wrapped his arms around Harry. He held him close and sighed. He was glad that Harry was okay, and wanted to do everything to sooth his son and make him stop radiating fear.
All of the blankets had been thrown off the bed onto the floor, and Severus could see Shadow hovering at the end of the bed looking frightened. Severus thought that it looked like he wanted to get closer to Harry but at the same time wanted to get away from the noise that had his ears flattened back against his skull.
Lucius came over and quietly informed him that Lucius needed to talk to him once Harry had gone down for the night. A worried look crossed Severus's face, but he quickly schooled it away and continued to listen to Harry talking about his day. He smiled down at Harry.
“I am okay. I was worried about some things, and Aunt Cissy let me talk about them and made me feel better. And then I took a nap.” Severus sat down on one of the love seats, and Harry sat down next to him.
Shadow walked into the bathroom and rubbed up against Harry's legs before standing up on his back feet and planting his front paws on Harry's knees.
“He's wicked smart, and can get anywhere he wants to go. Wards or not. Locked doors, no windows, no one knows how he does it. And he's a chatty cat. Not screeching or yowling, just a lot of...” The young man stopped as the cat let off a number of interesting sounds, ranging from a chirp like a bird to a regular cat meow to a growl that almost sounded like a dog. Harry looked intrigued, and Severus looked satisfied.
“Harry, you will never have to see those people again. “ Severus continued to keep his voice quiet, but firm. Harry's eyes got even wider, and Severus tried to keep his face serious as his new ward did a startling impression of a house elf. “You never should have had to go through what they did to you, and I am going to protect you from now on.” Madam Pomfrey was surprised at how gentle Severus was being with the boy, but at the same time was glad. She had helped Severus when he was young, and knew that often times those who had been abused made the best guardians.
“I was so scared! I was scared he was going to hurt me, but I was more scared that he was going to hurt you or Lucius. I couldn’t do that, I can’t lose my family again.” Severus shushed and rubbed his back in soothing circles, letting him cry out his fear. Draco, who had been asleep at the foot of Harry’s bed, woke up with the sound of Harry’s sobs.
The walk through the castle was exhilarating for Harry. He felt like he couldn't open his eyes wide enough to take it all in. There were suits of armor in the hallways, and they would turn and watch you as you walked past. The pictures on the walls moved and chattered as Severus and Harry walked past. But Harry had a long day and night, and the healing of his wounds had taken their toll. It wasn't very long before Severus realized that Harry was walking slower and having a hard time keeping up with him.
Severus continued to go through the members of his family for a little longer, then turned to a different page.
Once outside their quarters, Harry got his first view of the student body. There were so many of them, and all of them were wearing the same kind of clothing. At the same time, the student body got their first sight of their terrifying Potions Professor and his... son? When had Professor Snape gotten a son? It didn't take long for the entire student population to be whispering about Professor Snape and the small boy who was holding his hand without even a glimmer of fear.
My sincere apologies for the long delay in this next chapter. Life came at me hard, and I am finally through with it and have time to get back to writing. I hope that this new chapter is everything that you wanted it to be, and look forward to continue with this amazing story.
“It's perfect, Father.” Severus touched one of the tiles with a snake on it, and bubbles began to form in the tub. Severus turned back to Harry and gestured at his pajamas.
“Yes.” Harry looked at the basket. Neither the basket nor the egg were too big for him to carry, kind of like the Easter baskets that his aunt used to get for Dudley full of candies. Harry gently picked up the egg and basket and made his way out of the chamber, the torches going out as the door closed behind him.
“Lucius? Narcissa, are you there?” He didn't see anyone in the room, but he knew that the Floo was monitored and that they would be alerted to his call.
Once Harry and Severus got home, Severus recommended that Harry take a nap after his busy afternoon. Harry agreed, and laid down on his bed without even a comment. Severus was very happy that the afternoon had gone so well, and that Harry was not going to be by himself during the day. Severus was very happy with how the afternoon had gone.
“Second, how is your occlumency?” Remus’s eyebrows went up. Must be serious indeed if Severus was concerned about someone plucking the information out of his head.
Harry couldn't see what the woman who just walked in looked like, but she sounded like an older lady with an accent that he wasn't familiar with. He nodded in her direction, and then blinked a couple of times as something occurred to him.
“Why are you doing this?” Harry asked quietly. He thought maybe the man was a follower of the bad man, and was worried about all sorts of things that he couldn’t really pinpoint. He was mostly scared that this man was going to hurt him. He thought that the man hadn’t heard him because he didn’t stop moving and didn’t respond, so he was surprised a short while later when the man responded.
“Are you ready to go out? Harry nodded and Severus went looking to see if there  was outdoor clothing included in Narcissa's largesse.
“Albus told me that Harry was instrumental to us winning should Voldemort come back. That he had to be raised a certain way in order to be on the side of Light and under his authority. Apparently, he thought the best way to do that was for Harry to be raised with abusive Muggles that hated magic. When confronted with Minerva and Poppy's anger regarding the situation he was found in, he decided that the best place for Harry was with someone who appeared to hate Harry. Understanding that Harry would be taken should I display any affection for him, I chose to keep my opinions and feelings regarding the situation to myself.” Remus couldn't believe what he was hearing. But more than that, he knew that Severus wasn't lying. Mean and obstinate Severus might be, but not a liar. Remus sighed. He knew that he was going to have to put up with Severus in order to get closer to Harry, but he had never imagined it would be like this.
“Impenetrable. Anyone who tries to get anything from my mind can only hear the wolf, and nothing more.” Severus nodded.
Severus sucked in a breath and let out a long sigh. That explained a great deal. Why the Dark Mark never completely faded, why it would twinge occasionally. Severus thought about what he knew about Horcruxes, and absently began to reach for the journal. Lucius pushed his hand down and away from the journal.
“I was talking to your mom for a while, then I fell asleep. Sorry about that.” Draco put his arm around Harry.
“Poppy, is Harry okay to be released from here? I would like to show him his new home.” Poppy nodded, a little in awe of what she had just witnessed. Much like Minerva, she had been around children for a long time and was surprised at how powerful Harry's magic was already. Severus looked down at Harry. “Harry, are you feeling up to walking, or would you like me to carry you?” Harry blinked a couple of times, as if he hadn't even considered the possibility of being carried.
“Harry, I think Tippy might need a hug. She looks worried.” Harry gave Severus a small smile, and slid off Severus's lap. He walked over to Tippy and wrapped his arms around her. Severus was amused to note that they were about the same size. Her ears wiggled and she wrapped her arms around Harry.
Harry was fascinated by the story. He could just picture all of the knights with their new magic, and the Fae Queen Lady of the Lake. Narcissa turned back to the boys.
“Remus will be separated from the student body on the nights of the full moon, and you will be brewing him the Wolfsbane potion each month, of course.” Severus’s eyes narrowed and his voice grew cold and heavily laced with sarcasm.
“That's much better. You might consider growing it out some. The weight helps with the curl.” She moved out of the bathroom and towards the hearth. “You gentlemen are more than welcome to come to the house early instead of waiting for lunchtime. If you would like.” Severus looked at Harry, and Harry could tell that his father was going to let him decide.
Also, a big thank you to all of the people who have left messages and kudos. I can't tell you how much it means to me that my first story has gotten this kind of response. It's very much the reason that I have the drive to keep going.
“Oh, Harry. You don't have to earn your way. You only have to learn how to be a little kid again. To play, and learn, and make friends. All I want is to see you happy and healthy, and smiling.” Severus sighed, and ran his hand up and down Harry's back comfortingly. Recognizing that Harry might feel better if he was able to help someone else, Severus turned and looked for Tippy.
Severus looked Harry in the face, noting the surprise and awe running through his eyes. Severus opened the 4th door, which was in between his room and the bathroom and furthest from the hallway. Someone had a hand in decorating the room for a young child, and he was surprised and pleased to see that there were stars and constellations painted out along the ceiling. They glowed and twinkled in the dim light from the living room. Severus snapped his fingers and a lamp on the bedside table turned on, showing that the dark blue comforter on the bed had matching stars and constellations embroidered on it in silver thread.
Harry was absorbed, and wanted to help stir to change the colors. Severus let him play with stirring the potion for a little bit, then showed him how to clean the potion supplies correctly. After their potion was completed Harry went to play in his room and Severus started on the laborious task of researching Harry's scar and others like it. He quickly learned that the worst thing as a parent was researching something that might be wrong with your child. He did his best to ignore the possibilities that had nothing to do with Harry's history, or things that showed symptoms where Harry had none. He was dismayed when he came up with almost nothing.
“HARRY!!” he heard a small, childish voice cry out. Seemed he had less time than he thought. Rowle ran into the garden, holding Harry against his chest and covering his mouth so that he couldn't cry out and alert anyone to where they were.
“Now Severus, that’s not fair. James grew up to be a good man, and at one point in time Lily was your best friend. Taking care of their child will be a challenge, but I think it will be good for you. Perhaps it will help you move past your resentment of the past.” Albus was very proud of himself for thinking of it. Severus would keep Harry under wraps and humble, if only because of his seething resentment for James Potter and Sirius Black.
“Harry, I know that you have had a long and tiring day, but I feel that it is important for you to know that you are safe with me. That magic that was just performed, that was for you. You are my son now, in every way that matters. I am your father, and I will never hurt you. No one else will either.” Harry didn't say anything, but Severus could feel him shivering and sniffling. Severus was honestly glad that Harry was crying, because it would be much harder to help him if he kept all of his emotions locked up.
“In Cousin Narcissa's story, she said that the knights had to learn how to use their magic without wands. Can't I learn that way?” Lucius blinked a couple of times, startled, and looked at Narcissa. She looked proud and smug through the remnants of her lingering tears.
“Harry, I would like you to push the fork down towards the table if you can. With your magic.” Harry stared at the fork, focused on pushing the fork down. The fork wobbled in the air, and dropped about half an inch before Harry stopped and blinked, shaking his head.
Also, thank you so much for reading, and the amazing comments telling me how much you enjoy. As this is my first story, I am amazed at how much I have written, and how much further I have to go. This is a shorter chapter, but I didn't want to leave you guys hanging.
“You stop that, or I will slit your throat here and now, I swear to the Dark Lord.” Harry stopped, but the vipers kept moving towards him.
“Hello?” Said a tiny voice. Harry blinked at the egg a couple of times, and then down at Shadow, who was no longer paying attention to Harry or the egg and was cleaning his tail.
Remus was surprised when a knock came to his door. Thinking that Minerva or Dumbledore had come to wish him Happy Christmas, Remus took a deep breath and sat up as he smelled Severus and Harry outside his door. He stood up and straightened his clothes, then opened the door. Severus stood there, looking uncomfortable but not antagonistic as he had on previous visits. If Remus didn’t know better, he would have thought he saw frustrated understanding in Severus’s eyes. Harry stood next to him, holding his hand, the other holding his Occamy friend and his black kitten sitting next to him placidly.
“My darling little boy, I don’t think you understand how different things are.” She lifted him up and sat down on a plush chair, cuddling him against her as he curled up like a kitten. “When Severus adopted you, he wasn’t just saying that you are his son. The spell that he did, that means that you are as much his son as if you had been born to him. And he loves you, Harry, more than I could possibly put into words.” Narcissa could feel Harry crying almost silently against her, and she ran her hand up and down his back soothingly. “He’s not the only one. You are family to us, love. All of us. Lucius and I, Draco, even Mr. Lupin. You are family, and we would never let you leave or mistreat you the way that you were before.”
Severus knew now that there wasn't possible danger for Harry, but real reason to be concerned. It was so much closer to home than he had ever thought. The scar on Harry's head was so much more than a memory of the day it had been made. Severus made a mental note to begin research on scars caused by curses, and laid down for a sleepless night while keeping half an ear out for noise from Harry's room.
Once classes were completed for the day (finally, Severus thought to himself), Severus made his way through the Floo to what he was sure was going to be a new and exciting conversation. He came through to quiet, unlike every other time he had come over. No one was in the receiving room. Severus walked out into the hall, following the sounds of giggling that drifted through the house.
“My goodness, child, you didn't need to add THAT many daisy roots. Didn't you READ the recipe at all? Mr. Burbage, just WHAT do you think you are doing with those leeches? Put them down at ONCE! Ms. Beecham, the leeches are on the other side of the classroom from you, please do stop shrieking.” He could hear a general din of noise from the classroom that NEVER happened when he was in class.
“Um, Mister... um... Snape. What do I call you?” Severus smiled to himself, glad that Harry was willing to talk to him.
“Father said that you might know more about Nala?” Hearing her name, the Occamy lifted her head. Remus smiled.
Albus had advised that Harry hadn’t been happy or thriving with his Muggle relatives, and that was why Albus had Severus fetch him and bring him to Hogwarts. He had stated that Harry was fine, and a perfect example of a child his age. But Madam Pomfrey, on the other hand, had a very different story to tell.
“Well... the night that he killed your parents, he did a spell. The spell was... “ Here, Severus hesitated. He was worried about telling Harry about the man that had almost killed him. He saw that Harry had stopped eating and was watching him intently while chewing on his lower lip. Severus knew that he couldn't just stop.
I couldn't leave you guys on a cliffhanger like that! Here you go! Also, thank you so much for all the amazing words, I can't tell you what they mean to me.
Harry could see that the dragon was pacing back and forth over Draco's palm like it was agitated, like the dragons had on the store table. Harry held his hand out so that the tips of his fingers were touching Draco's hand. The little dragon stopped pacing and turned towards Harry's hand, sniffing as if it had smelled something tasty. The next thing that either of the boys knew, the tiny dragon galloped over onto Harry's hand and flipped over on it's back, rolling around like a cat on a catnip field. Draco's mouth dropped open in surprise.
Sometimes Harry still had nightmares, but he always woke up with his father stroking his head and telling him that everything was okay, or with Shadow purring in his ear. Harry was starting to feel like he was safe for the first time in as long as he could remember.
“Well, no one knows what happened to Arthur after he went to Avalon. Some people think that he was sleeping and would one day wake up, others say that he passed away from his injuries and would be reborn when he was needed.” Harry nodded. He had decided that this was his favorite story of all the ones that he had heard so far. “I believe that Arthur died long ago, but that the myth that he would be reborn is true. He’s known as the Promised King.” Harry smiled.
“I will let you know. Depending on how expensive I determine the ingredients needed, I may take you up on that. I very much doubt that I could get them through the potion ingredient budget for my classes.” Severus pinched the bridge of his nose, not looking forward to the conversation that he was going to have to have with one Remus Lupin. “I should take Harry home. We have to talk.”
Lucius followed Narcissa at a safe distance when she didn’t greet him as she passed his study. She had only ever done that once before, and it was shortly before the Dark Lord fell. Lucius came to the door Narcissa warded and almost knocked when he heard an unearthly shriek from inside. His eyebrows almost in his hairline, Lucius silently retreated to the safety of his study, knowing that his wonderful and terrifying wife would feel better after she had finished breaking everything in the room.
“Father, why doesn't Draco's dad like me?” Severus blinked in surprise. He hadn't expected Harry to be intuitive enough to pick up on that, but he realized that with how Harry had been living with his relatives he shouldn't have been surprised.  Severus put his fork down and sighed.
“Yes, Master. Mr. Lupin has been moved to quarters by the History of Magic classroom.” Severus nodded. There was only one set of quarters there, and since Professor Binns passed he had never left the classroom Severus was certain that was where he had been placed. He instructed Tippy to stay and keep an eye on Harry, and then left his quarters to go to visit on of his childhood nightmares.
“Harry, are you enjoying your lessons so far?” Lucius made sure that his tone was warm and light, attempting to break the tension that his perhaps ill-advised question had caused.
Severus appeared on the corner of Privet Drive in Little Whinging, and looked around at the utterly bland houses. He wore a black suit with a Mandarin collar and black trousers, reminiscent of his teaching robes but not out of place on a Muggle street. He moved into the shadows of a large tree and disillusioned himself before making his way to the ordinary house labeled Number 4. Moving around the house, he began checking in the windows, looking for any indication that anything was wrong.  The inside of the house was just as plain as the outside, but Severus was surprised that he didn’t see any indication that Harry even lived here. There were pictures of the family, and many of a very overweight child that couldn’t possibly be Harry, but not a single picture of the child that he had been sent to check on.
“Umm… she eats mice and birds for now, but if she’s bigger she might eat bigger things. She promised to not eat Shadow or any of my toys. And she said that can be invisible and come with me to keep me safe.” Harry looked down at the book. “I told her about what happened the other night.” Severus ran his hand up and down Harry’s back comfortingly.
“She said that she don’t know how long she was waiting, just that her mom told her that she had to wait until she could feel her Master coming. Then she went to sleep. She said that when she went to sleep it was very loud, like many pieces of stone being moved and placed on each other.” Severus nodded again, and estimated that the serpent had been sleeping since Hogwarts was built.
Severus appeared outside the gates of Hogwarts with his precious cargo. Not wanting to cause additional injury, he laid the boy down on the ground gently and cast Levicorpus to ensure that he wouldn't be jostled as he moved through the castle.  He began to make his way up the path, heading directly to the Hospital ward rapidly. Poppy would be able to take care of Harry while Severus dealt with the Headmaster. As Severus made his way through the castle, he recast the disillusionment charm, making sure to include Harry. It wasn’t quite curfew, and he didn’t want to have to explain why he was bringing a child much too young for Hogwarts to the Infirmary to everyone who happened to walk past. As the ward came into view and he thought he was in the clear, Minerva stepped out of her office and right into his path.
The rest of the morning was learning about the different forms of magic, and then they moved onto magical animals and where they were found. The white board showed pictures of the animals and the amazing habitats from around the world. Harry was sure that he would never remember all of the things that he had learned today, but he did his best to take notes so that he could tell his father all about it. Before Harry could believe it, it was time to stop for lunch.
“Harry, do you know how to read?” Harry nodded again. He wasn't really sure of his voice, but reading had been one of his favorite things to do when he was at school. Severus started dishing Harry up breakfast from the food on the table, continuing to talk. “I am going to leave some books for you when I leave for class, as well as some paper and drawing supplies. You are more than welcome to draw, or read, or play whatever you like, so long as you do not go into my study or bedroom. Tippy will make sure to bring you food.” Severus placed the plate in front of Harry. “I am sorry, but I do not have any toys for you at this moment, but that is something that I will remedy this coming weekend. We will go and get you suitably clothed and get some things for you to play with. Does that sound okay.” Harry nodded again, waiting for Severus to say that it was okay to start eating. The plate was full of things that smelled delicious, but it was more food than he had ever had at a single sitting. He also didn't want to get smacked for eating before he had permission.
“I will endeavor to make sure that Harry is trained to the best of my abilities, Headmaster.” Albus nodded and waved him off, indicating that their meeting had come to an end. Which suited Severus just fine, as he wasn’t sure that he had the mental fortitude to keep from hexing that stupid old man for much longer. As Severus made his way down the spiral staircase, he thought over what Albus had said. His son, a tool for Albus Dumbledore and his ‘Greater Good’. Not on his life. He would make sure that Harry was trained to recognize Albus’s manipulations for what they were, and how to avoid falling into them. That Harry was trained in ALL magic, not just the ones that Albus deemed “Light”. He would teach his son about the draw of Dark Magic, and how to avoid it, and the elemental magic that infused the world around them. Severus made a mental note to add sword fighting and tumbling to Harry’s lessons. With how young and clever Harry was, Severus had no doubts about how well he would do. Severus knew that one day Harry would be a very dangerous man to make an enemy out of, and Severus would be there to guard him the whole time.
Severus and Harry grew closer, and Severus went out of his way to make sure that they got time together every day. The evenings before bed were spent reading their bedtime stories, and weekends were spent playing games, brewing simple potions, and preparing non-reactive potion ingredients. Harry loved learning about anything magical, even things that others would deem disgusting, and Severus knew that even if Harry never desired to brew for a living he would still be exemplary at it.
After dinner and a bath, during which Harry's head would slowly droop then snap back up as he valiantly tried to stay awake, Severus helped Harry into his pajamas and into bed. Severus picked one of the chapter books that they had gotten that afternoon, The Secret Garden, and began to read to Harry. Harry was wrapped around his giant dragon and was watching Severus read. Moments after they had began, Shadow slunk into the room and jumped up on the bed. Severus noted that he had the tiny dragon in his mouth and was about to chastise the feline before realizing that Shadow was holding him very carefully. Shadow carefully placed the figurine on the bed and curled up against Harry's hip.
Harry wiped his face on his blanket, and got up. He went to the bathroom and got a cloth from the shelf next to the bathtub. He began dusting the bookshelves closest to the floor. He carefully dusted the spines and tops of the books. He was surprised at how little dust there was, even at the corners. He made his way around the room, and then moved up to the second shelf and moved the opposite way around the room. He felt better for cleaning something, since this was the first time in as long as he could remember that he hadn't been cleaning something.
The next morning, Harry was up and active and didn't seem to have any memory of the previous evening. The two of them had breakfast together, and then Severus took Harry into his lab to show him an easy potion that he had once made when he first learned how to make potions. The brightly colored rainbow that flashed in the cauldron as the potion was finished delighted Harry, and Severus showed him how stirring in different ways changed the color of the potion. Severus was very proud of how exacting Harry was in counting out ingredients, and while they were making the potion Severus would give Harry little tips in potion making.
“Shall we go get dinner? It's been a long day.” Harry nodded and followed Severus out of the room, running his hand down Shadow's back as they passed. Shadow didn't move, as he and the tiny dragon figurine were in the middle of a staring contest. As they left the room, Shadow and the dragon began chasing each other around the bed.
“I'll be right back.” Severus went into his room, and opened the wardrobe. At the very back was a rolled up tapestry that Lily had given to him for Christmas one year. He had never put it up because it was very... girly. At least compared to his normal style. It was a dragon and a unicorn curled together in a medieval style. Given Harry's interest in dragons, Severus thought that it would give Harry a connection to his mother.
My apology for the long wait. Life got a little crazy. I am hoping to get chapters up much more often. I hope you enjoy reading! Thank you everyone for all of the wonderful comments!
Once Severus was back at Hogwarts, he made his way up to Remus’s chambers and knocked on the door. He didn’t understand why he kept doing this, or why it had to be HIM of all people. The only person he would hate more being in this position was Sirius Black. Thank all the gods the lunatic was in Azkaban and would be for the rest of his days.
A little while later, Narcissa and Severus came up to Draco's room. They could have sent one of the house elves,  but they wanted to see how the boys were doing. As they got close to the door, they could hear the boys giggling together. The adults stepped in the room to find Harry and Draco sitting on the floor. Harry was absolutely covered in tiny figurines, who were all cuddling up to Harry. Draco was picking up the tiny toys that wouldn't fit on Harry and exchanging them for ones that were on top of him. As soon as the toys were separated from Harry, they went back to acting like the original spell had designated.
“I can't think about this anymore. I am going to go home, and look through my books. You do the same here. We will talk about this again this weekend. I am hoping that I am going to have some ideas by then. “ Severus put the tumbler on one of the side tables and made his way to the Floo before turning back. “Lucius, thank you. I can't tell you how much it means to me that you are supporting my family.” Lucius smiled and nodded. Severus turned and went through the Floo.
Harry followed Shadow out the door, closing it quietly behind him. He hadn’t done anything that he knew his father wouldn’t like since he had started living here, and was a little worried about what was going to happen. But he felt a pull that he was SURE was his instincts, and he turned and followed Shadow down the dark hallway.
“Severus, we are ready. Please come through. “ Severus stepped out into the receiving room and was immediately handed a tumbler of Firewhiskey. Severus sighed and sat down, taking a sip and looking at Lucius expectantly.
Severus and Remus turned at the same time to see Shadow poke his head in and then trot towards Harry’s room, tail held high. The door opened a little further, and Harry walked in carrying what looked to be a large egg in a basket. Severus inhaled deeply and Remus got the impression that he was about to blast Harry with his temper, when Harry hissed something. Hissed in a way that a normal human shouldn’t have been able to. Both Severus and Remus dropped into their respective chairs, all the wind knocked out of them when they realized what they had heard.
“What if, when he grew up, he was really nice? You would have a hard time believing that, because you believed for so long that he was mean.” Harry nodded again, understanding what his father was trying to point out. It would be really hard to change his mind about something like that.
“Hey there, how are you feeling?” Harry blinked a couple of times, and his eyes filled with tears before he launched himself at his father.
“If you like, Harry, you could call me Aunt Cissy. I know we are really cousins, but it would be easier to say than ‘Cousin Narcissa’ all the time.” She made big eyes at him, and he giggled.
“I understand, Father. I won’t talk to anyone about the chambers, or the Promised King, or the talking to snakes. I will help keep you safe.” Severus ran his hand through Harry’s hair affectionately, and they left the chambers, the torches going out behind them.
“No, Remus was never a bully. But I think, because he didn’t want his friends to get mad at him, or stop being friends with him, he didn’t stop him from bullying other people.” Harry nodded.
“So, I found out Harry was a Parselmouth when he left our chambers late last night…” Severus detailed the previous night to Lucius and Narcissa, gratified to see their eyes go wide and both of them go pale. He had wanted to do the same last night, but didn’t want Harry to think there was something wrong or that he was afraid of him.
“Maybe there is because of their history.” Narcissa stepped forward and put a hand on each of their arms. “Severus, Remus, we all care for Harry. Let’s not continue fighting. It’s not good for the children to deal with this kind of animosity.” Severus stepped back but continued to sneer at Remus. He couldn’t believe that this… this… mangy cur was intruding on his time, his life, with Harry. But he knew that Remus wouldn’t hurt Harry, he just couldn’t help but throw in his face that Remus had almost mauled him as a teenager. He also knew that at the time, there hadn’t been Wolfsbane Potion. He also knew, although he’d rather have his fingernails ripped off than admit it, that Lupin had suffered a great deal from the loss of Lily and James. Maybe as much as he had, if you added the prejudice against werewolves to it. He huffed a breath out through his nose and sat back down.
Thank you everyone for all of the wonderful comments. I have been working on this regularly, and I will try to update once a week but might be up to two weeks between updates depending on life.
Albus chuckled to himself as he used legillimancy to gently probe Severus's state of mind. He didn't want Severus to get involved with Harry, and it would be much easier if his opinions regarding Harry were based in the idea that Harry was spoiled by his relatives. It was so much easier to control people when they wore their emotions so close to the surface, and since Petunia and Vernon Dursley spoiled their own child it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine that they did the same for Harry. “Be that as it may, Severus, I would like you to check on Harry to make sure that he is well.” Albus’ voice had a note of finality to it, and Severus knew from past experience that he wouldn’t be able to say anything else to change his mind.
“I have requested to have an extra day off from teaching this weekend for us to spend together, so today will be the last day this week that I have to teach. Tomorrow we will go get some toys and books, and I will take you to go meet my friends. They have been very close for a long time, and I hope that you will develop a friendship with them like I have.” Harry nodded his head over his bowl of oatmeal and side of bacon, the oatmeal sweet and creamy and with some sort of fruit in it. “I would also like to have Madam Pomfrey to check your eyesight and see if there are any lingering issues that need healing.” Harry wasn't sure what to say to this, so he nodded and continued to eat. He didn't like thinking about his relatives or what happened.
“I am glad. I have a couple of things for you this morning.” He reached into the chair on the other side of him, and pulled up a small bundle. He handed it to Harry, and Harry realized that it was his blanket. He cuddled it to his chest and smiled at his father. It was the first time that Severus had seen Harry smile so big, and it warmed him up in an amazing way.
“You will keep quiet and hold still, or I will knock you so hard you won’t remember who you are.” Harry, familiar with these kinds of threats from his uncle, could hear from the man’s tone of voice that he wouldn’t hesitate to hurt Harry. He nodded, and the man took his hand away from Harry’s mouth. He pulled his wand out and laid it flat on his palm. He said “Point me” at it, and the wand spun and pointed away from the manor. The man shifted his grip on Harry, and started moving in that direction.
Severus stopped and turned to look at the cat, and directed Harry's attention to the cage. A black cat sat at the front of the cage, looking at the two of them with highly intelligent golden eyes. It had a white star in the middle of it's chest, and was just a little bit older than a kitten. As Harry leaned closer to the cage, the cat leaned out and tapped Harry on the nose, making a “Mrrt” chirping noise. Harry giggled. Severus wanted to know more. He called up to the shop boy.
“Yes, yes. You realize, Harry being the Promised King, he’s going to start gathering knights?” Severus blinked at the realization. He’d forgotten that the knights would be reformed. The old myths even said that Merlin himself would wake and reappear.
Despite his blurry vision, which he was used to, he could tell that he was in a large room with many beds. The walls appeared to be made of some sort of stone, and standing next to his bed was a slightly plump woman in a grey dress and a white apron, and a tall man with black hair, black eyes, and black clothes. Harry didn’t know where he was, or who these people were, and so he didn’t say anything. He knew that often, if he didn’t say anything, it was less likely that he would be in trouble. His stomach clenched in fear, but he didn't know what to do.
“You have a cat, that's so cool! I found a kitten in the stables, but Mother said that it needed to stay outside. I think she just didn't want the fur on the furniture. Hey, I have the whole collection of dragons, and a bunch of other animals and creatures! We should see if they all react like this!” Draco ran over to a cabinet and proceeded to pull out all sorts of animal figurines and dragons and other creatures that Harry had never seen before.
“Thank you, very much.” Poppy looked at the two of them standing next to each other. Maybe it was the adoption ritual, but the two of them looked like they had always been a family. A moment later, Poppy had headed back to the Hospital Wing.
In order to protect the man that he had raised, Merlin took the wounded Arthur to the mythical Island of Avalon and placed him in an enchanted sleep to heal. Arthur would wake when Brittania needed him the most. The sword was given back to the Lady of the Lake, and one day would be gifted to someone worthy and pure of heart. The scabbard disappeared into myth.
“There you are, boys. Please, come this way. I want to introduce Harry to Lucius and Draco.” Narcissa came into the doorway and held out her hand to Harry. Harry took her and and let her lead him out of the room, looking over his shoulder at his father. Severus was following and nodding at Harry that it was fine.  Narcissa led Harry into a room down the hall from the one that they had arrived in. There was a couch, on which sat the little boy who had come to Severus's house the other day and a man who looked to be around his father's age who had hair as pale as Narcissa's. The man was sitting on a wing back chair opposite of the couch and watching Draco play with something in his lap.
“It just looks like a passageway to me. Maybe if you hold my hand?” Harry took Severus’s hand again, and led him towards the wall. Moments later, Severus was standing on the other side of the wall, and was looking down at a spiral staircase that he had never seen before. Severus blinked several times.
“Mrs. Malfoy said that the old knights didn't use wands like wizards today. That their magic was wild and powerful. Mr. Malfoy is going to teach me how to use magic without a wand. Severus blinked several times. Harry continued to eat.
Harry, who's home life until very recently had given him extreme sensitivity to currents and moods in his environment, had slunk down into his chair and was trying to make himself as small as possible. He had stopped eating and was watching Lucius and Narcissa very carefully. Narcissa sighed, which was enough to get Lucius's attention, and flicked her eyes towards Harry so he could see what his question and the change in conversation had done. Lucius glanced at Harry, and realized that he had to fix this before Severus got the impression that he was causing his son distress.
When Harry first came through the Floo, he thought that he was in a museum. Everything was bright and shiny and looked very expensive.  Harry was worried about touching anything. Severus stepped out of the Floo right behind him and put his hand on his shoulder.
“Oh, of course, in my excessive free time between teaching, and grading, and brewing the potions for the infirmary, and watching the child.” Albus smiled at him, either oblivious or intentionally ignoring his sarcasm. Severus would bet his solid gold cauldron that it was the latter.
“I was worried about you, Harry. I went to your room, and you weren’t there. I was so scared. Please don’t ever scare me like that again.” Harry could tell how upset his father was, and felt tears welling up. He didn’t want to disappoint his father.
My sincere apologies to all of you who have been waiting for an update. Between the holidays, a big event, and then assisting with running a wedding, I totally didn't have time to get this posted. Written, yes, but not posted. I hope this newest chapter brings you as much joy to read as it gave me to write.
Lucius was quite distracted with how he was going to approach the other Pure blood wizards regarding the adoption of Harry and Lucius's support of him instead of the Dark Lord. He knew that there were a number of wizards like Macnair, and the Carrows, and Rowle, that he knew would target Harry as soon as they knew without some sort of motivation to leave him alone. He knew that he was going to have to keep an eye on Harry while he was there for lessons and see if there was anything that could keep Harry safe from the monsters that he once called friends.
“I learn as fast as I can. So I can protect you too, like you protect me. Because we are family. ” Severus's eyes welled for a moment as he wrapped his arms around Harry. It was the first time that Harry had initiated affection, and Severus cherished that Harry was getting more comfortable.
“Harry, I know that things are overwhelming right now, but you are going to get used to it. You don't have to be afraid to talk, or to eat, or anything. I would never do anything to hurt you, and you aren't going to get in trouble for speaking your mind. I WANT to know what you are thinking. That is the only way that you are going to start to heal.” Harry didn't really understand what Severus meant by heal, because he wasn't in pain anymore from the beatings yesterday, but he nodded anyway.
Even though he was only watching, Draco watched Harry and beamed with pride as he answered all the questions correctly. By the end of Harry's short quiz, Draco was bouncing happily in his seat. He was overjoyed at how smart his new friend was.
Merlin was old, tired, and devastated by the wounding of the man he considered a son. He passed along his most treasured magics to Morgana, then gathered all of Arthur's knights. He told them that they would be needed to protect the people of the world in Arthur's absence. Then Merlin passed on his ability to use magic to the knights, telling them that the magic would pass through their family lines to one day produce knights to once again stand by the awoken Arthur's side.
“I am okay. That was really scary, and I was worried about Father and Lucius and Mr. Lupin. That bad man was going to hurt them. And maybe me too.” Draco’s eyes were wide. He hadn’t realized that his father was going to be at risk.
“A little. But not because of that. And my feelings about Remus aren’t fair to him, which is why I wanted you to spend time with him and figure out how you felt about him all on your own.” Harry smiled.
“Oh, look at your hair. Poor thing.” She began to run her fingers through his hair. “I don't know if you knew this, Harry, but you and I are related.” Harry looked up at her in surprise. He didn't think that he had any other family other than his father. “Oh yes. Let me think... Dorea Black was your grandmother, and my great-aunt. So that would make us... second cousins.” She kissed him gently on the top of his head. “Hello cousin. I can also honestly assure you that the hair trouble comes from the Black side of the family. Merlin knows that Bellatrix and Andromeda had the worst time controlling it, although not like Bellatrix tried.” Narcissa pulled and elegant pale wand from her sleeve and waved it over Harry's head. His hair felt like a breeze went through it, and he saw his father breathe what looked like a sigh of relief. Narcissa put her wand back up her sleeve with a look of supreme satisfaction.
Harry's eyes filled with tears and he started crying. “I won't have to go back? Not ever?” Severus shook his head.
“It's nice to meet you, Harry.” Lucius leaned down and put his hand out for Harry to shake. Harry shook Lucius's hand.
“This door, Harry, leads to my private laboratory and study. If the door is closed, that means that I want privacy or that I am working on a potion that might be dangerous for you to be around. If you knock, and I don't answer, it means that I am busy with whatever project, and unless it's an emergency, you will need to wait for me to answer. If it is an urgent matter, you may enter the study and call for me.” Harry nodded in understanding, too sleepy to think of a response or question.
“I am sorry, Minerva, but I am afraid that I can't leave Harry at this time. He's had a bit of a scare. I am going to have to cancel the rest of my classes for the day.”
Once the holidays had been completed, life seemed to settle into a comfortable routine, at least for everyone but Severus. Harry resumed lessons at Malfoy Manor, supplemented by time spent once a week with Remus. Severus was more willing to let Harry spend time with Remus, as well as less likely to unleash his frustration at the situation directly on Remus’s head, but he still wasn’t happy. He didn’t trust Remus to stick up for Harry should Albus try to interfere with him in some way, and was concerned that the Gryffindor would rub off on him. He didn’t want his son to be the type of person who would run off into things without thinking first, or start problems. He conveyed his concerns to Narcissa and Lucius, and both of them reassured Severus that Harry was very much not that kind of child.
A moment later, the two of them appeared in the Floo reception room. Draco was waiting for them, bouncing in his seat on the settee. As soon as Harry and Severus were through the fireplace, Draco jumped up and ran over.
It was about 3 in the morning when Harry stirred. Severus, who had been reading while keeping vigil, immediately put his book down and moved from his chair to sitting on the edge of Harry’s bed.
Severus and Harry walked to Remus’s rooms, not seeing anyone. Almost all of the students were gone for the holiday, and most of the professors were enjoying the freedom from classes. Standing in front of Remus’s door, Severus took a deep breath. When he sighed the breath out, he tried to let the resentment and antagonism was out of him. He felt Harry take his hand and squeeze, and knew that for Harry, he would do anything.
A small boy road past on a small broom, and a younger girl ran giggling after him. The broom only hovered about 2 feet off the ground, but it raced through the store at what appeared to Harry to be high speed. Harry saw children playing with wands that shot colorful sparks through the air, and from somewhere within the store came giant bubbles with pictures inside them. One came close to Harry, and he could see a butterfly flutter it's brightly colored wings.
Nimue and Morgana were recorded in history for many more years, leading Arthur's knights in their newfound magic abilities. Wands weren't being used yet, and the magic was raw, powerful, and wild. Over time, the witches too faded into obscurity. The knights spread from Camelot across the world and used their magic to help people up until Muggle religion decided that magic and witches were evil and started trying to hunt people with magic down to hurt them. At that point, the Wizarding World decided that they would hide from the Muggles to protect themselves.
“You pushed your aunt? She’s got a giant bruise on her arm from your clumsiness, you waste of space!” His uncle reached in and grabbed him by his too-big shirt, hauling him out into the open. Harry whimpered and shook his head.
“Please, don’t let him out of your sight until I come back. We need to make sure that he’s safe.” Pomfrey merely nodded, busy on the charms that she was using to heal the tiny child in the middle of the bed. Severus followed Minerva out of the infirmary and through the halls, listening to her mutter under her breath. “Bloody Muggles, I KNEW that we never should have left him there. I ought to go there and give them a piece of my mind..”.  Severus knew that no matter what else happened, watching Minerva go off on Albus was going to be the highlight of his evening.
“I look forward to seeing Harry. When would you like to arrange introductions?” Severus took a deep breath and stood to his full height.
It was the last day of classes, and all of the children were snug in their beds and ready to leave the following day for their holiday break. Christmas was in two days, and Severus had just fallen asleep after completing his scoring of the last midterm. Harry had been asleep  for hours until he was woken by a cat paw on his face.
Draco was ecstatic. He had never had someone so fascinating to play with. Why did all the animated toys react to Harry that way. It was like there was something extra special about him. Draco liked the idea that he had an extra special best friend, and he was excited to find out what else was extra special.
“What is he thinking? Having a werewolf around our children? What is wrong with that man?” Narcissa was not any happier with the turn in events.
“I wonder if the prophecy that the Dark Lord was worried about was referring to is this. ‘He shall have power that the Dark Lord knows not.’ That would make a lot of sense. Lucius knew about the prophecy, but Remus started at the mention of another prophecy.
“Salazar, this is my son, Harry. He is going to be staying in my quarters from now on. “ The painting nodded, and then the painting swung open from the side as if it was a door. Behind the door was a living room tastefully decorated in earth tones, rich shades of dark brown and dark wood with touches of cream detail. There was a sofa with dark wood and cream fabric, and two wing backed chairs stood side by side with a table of dark wood between them.  Across from the sofa was a large fireplace, lit already to ward off the chill from the stone walls. There were four doors spread out around the room, and Severus walked to each of them to show Harry his new home.
Harry wakes up, and is told about magic and that he will not have to go back to the Dursley's. Severus adopt Harry, and shows him his new home.
“Severus, Albus has agreed to allow Harry to live here in the castle during the year. He said that he already had the castle add a new room to your quarters for him. “ She stopped in her tracks at the vivid green eyes staring back at her from the bed. “Well, look who is awake! Good evening, Mr. Potter.”
“Oh, you are just the most darling little boy. No, sweetie, I am not an elf. Just a regular lady. But I hear you are having some issues getting ready to come to lunch at my house. Do you mind if I help?” Harry shook his head, but kept his arms wrapped around Shadow who continued to purr.
“So, Severus, since we have a moment, would you like to discuss what has you on pins and needles? You are practically radiating tension.” Narcissa came around the couch and sat down, patting the cushion next to her.
Harry was starting to get used to being surrounded by support and love, but it still made him a little uncomfortable. Narcissa often called him ‘Cousin’ and he liked knowing that he had other family, but he felt like she was doing it to be nice and that he wasn’t her ‘real’ family the way Lucius and Draco were. But he was happy that Lucius and Narcissa taught him so many things, and they were never mean like his aunt and uncle had been. Draco loved hanging out and playing with him and was nothing like his cousin, but Harry was concerned that Draco only wanted to be his friend because there was something special about him. Something different. Harry sometimes was worried that he would do something that would make someone (or everyone) mad at him, but it never happened. Harry couldn’t make his brain stop worrying about it though. The same was true when he was hanging out with Remus. He was careful about what he mentioned to Remus, because he knew that his father and Remus didn’t get along and he didn’t want either of them mad at each other or mad at him. He remembered his uncle calling him a freak and didn't want to be different from everyone else.
Narcissa blinked once, twice, and kept blinking. Almost as if her brain was unable to process what she had just heard. Lucius's reaction was much more dramatic. He jumped out of his seat and moved to take a step forward, but his feet got tangled in Narcissa's skirt. With a solid thud and a tearing sound, Lucius landed flat on his face on the expensive Persian rug. Narcissa didn't react at all to him falling or her dress tearing, but continued to blink at Severus.
“Hello, Father.” Not ready to see Harry flinch at his touch, Severus  suppressed his urge to run his fingers through Harry's messy hair and instead stood up.
The next several hours were busy with Aurors coming to take away Rowle’s body and interviewing everyone who had been involved. Lucius and Remus escorted the Aurors to Harry’s room, where Severus sat by his bed. Severus explained that Harry had been taken, and when Rowle had been attacked by the snakes, he had passed out from the stress. He said that he didn’t know if Harry had been hurt by Rowle, but that all diagnostic spells had come back negative. Severus told the Aurors that he was sure that Harry was fine, he just needed rest after his ordeal. He kept a cloth covering Harry’s forehead to keep the Aurors from asking too many questions or being too interested in his son. As this was a clear attempted abduction attempt, and there was no evidence that anything had been done to him except for the snake bites and venom, the Aurors quickly finished and left with the corpse. Once the Aurors had taken their leave, Remus bid Severus and Lucius good evening and left himself.
“You nasty little shite! Trying to get out of a well deserved beating!” Vernon dropped him onto the growing puddle on the floor. Vernon kicked the boy on the floor, fury and glee mingling when the child whimpered. Vernon had always had a sadistic streak and was more than happy to let it out on the freak that had been forced upon their family. He kicked again, knocking the boys head against the wall.
“What on…” Minerva was going to exclaim about his presence here in the castle, but spotted the bruise developing along the side of Harry’s face and cut lip and she puffed up like an angry cat. “Oh, oh no…” She looked back at Severus. “What are you waiting for?!?” She began to make her way in the direction of the Hospital ward, making it clear to Severus that she was going with him to help Harry. Smirking internally, Severus followed. There was nothing like having the Transfiguration professor and Deputy Headmistress in your corner. As they walked up to the doors to the ward, Severus disillusioned Harry again, in case there were students already in the ward.
Minerva walked in first and glanced around the ward to see if there were any students in the beds. Seeing that the ward was empty, she opened the doors to give Severus room to bring Harry in. Madam Pomfrey bustled out from her office, notified by the charm on the doors that let her know when she had a new arrival.
“Minerva, my apologies for waking you, but I need your assistance for an adoption ceremony for Harry. Albus couldn't be bothered.” Minerva's face tightened, and she nodded curtly. Both of them headed in. Poppy waited for Severus and had spent the past half hour comforting Harry, who was almost incoherent with the idea that he would never have to go back to his aunt and uncle's house.
Severus nodded his assent at Albus, making sure to school his features into a scowl. “If that is all, I will return to the Infirmary to check on my new ward.” Severus turned and walked back out of Albus’ office. Minerva stayed where she was, looking down at Albus with narrowed eyes.
“You want to hang out and learn all the things with me, right?” Harry looked at Severus for a moment, but his father appeared to be letting Harry make the choice.
“I am SO excited that we are taking lessons together! We are going to have so much fun!” Draco grabbed Harry's hand and started leading him out of the room as Harry smiled. They passed Narcissa on their way, Harry smiling and waving at Narcissa as Draco continued to chatter. Narcissa smiled back, nodded, and continued into the room to greet Severus.
“No! You said that I could stay with you! You said that you were friends with my mom. Please don't change your mind! I promise I'll stop crying!” He began wiping his face furiously with the sleeve of his pajamas.
“What can Tippy do for Potions Master and Master Harry Potter?” Harry goggled at the creature with a tiny, squeaky voice. Harry thought that the creature might be a female.
“You are more than welcome to be part of Harry's magical lessons, once we have figured them out. But don't be surprised, Draco, if you cannot do anything yet. This is a very rare ability. “ Draco nodded, but smiled and nudged Harry. He wasn't going to be excluded.
“I have one at home, a different one. He's not as fast as this one, but he does the same thing. He plays with my cat too.” Harry was starting to relax. Draco seemed very interested in him, and he didn't seem to mind that Harry didn't talk much.
Harry walked into the circular room that the gargoyle had called “The Founders chambers”. The room had a number of couches and chairs, and looked like a cross between the fancy furniture from the Malfoy house and the furniture around his own quarters with his father. There were four doors leading off the room, each a different color wood. One was a bright golden wood with black iron fittings, one was a pretty red wood with gold fittings. One was a black wood that had an almost blue hue with bronze fittings, and the last was a greenish silver with silver fittings. Remembering what he learned about the Founders of Hogwarts, he knew which room belonged to each founder. He wasn’t sure why he had been led here, but he thought that he should show his father this as soon as possible. He turned to leave when he heard Shadow chirp.
Severus was stunned, and didn’t know what to make of this new development. A mythical creature, once thought a god by members of a Mesoamerican tribe, had decided that his son was going to be it’s ‘Master’.
“Harry, come here please.” Harry moved towards his father, giving the stranger a wide berth. “I was worried. I know that you know you aren’t supposed to leave our quarters alone, especially at night. I was very worried about you. I called Mr. Lupin to help look for you when I found you missing.” Remus’s eyebrows shot up. He had expected Severus to blast Harry with his temper, but instead he was calmly explaining everything.
“I’m… I’m sorry father…” Harry said, as he started to cry. Severus pulled Harry against him, and cradled him on his lap.
“I, Harry, the Promised King, do judge you, Rowle, as following the Shadowed Path.” Harry’s eyes began to glow, and Rowle could almost see a shadow of a crown above his head. His voice got deeper, as if someone was speaking through the small child. “As Mordred before you, I condemn you to death, to save the world from your darkness. May your soul find peace in the Beyond.” Rowle let out a gurgle of pain, and fell on his face onto the ground, writhing in pain.
“I can't tell you how worried I was about Draco, for ages. He was so tiny and fragile. He's much heartier now. Although sometimes he just won't stop talking.” Severus chuckled.
“We will have Madam Pomfrey check your eyes this weekend. Come to the table and we can have dinner, and I will tell you about my day.” As they sat down at the table, plates appeared on the table with their dinner. Severus began to tell Harry about his day, over exaggerating the minimal explosions and trouble making children. Every time he made exploding noises, Harry giggled. Severus realized that while Harry had some healing to go through, he would be able to act like a little kid with a little help.
“Harry, it’s time to wake up. Your father is here.” Harry opened his eyes and blinked at her, and she realized that being able to wake immediately was one of the things that he had learned at the hands of those people. She smiled down at him. “Are you feeling better dear? That was a lot to talk about.” Harry nodded.
He arrived to find the room in shambles. A number of bookshelves had been broken, as well as all of the lamps and he could see through the bathroom door that the bathroom mirror was cracked as well. He barely managed to duck as a book flew through the air towards him. He immediately recognized it as the Treaties on the Element of Air. It wasn't a book that was malevolent, just one that preferred to be flying around unless spelled down. The spell was easily disturbed when touched. But where was Harry.
Severus’s good mood was shattered the Monday before Winter Break started at Hogwarts. He was summoned to the Headmaster’s office for the first time since he had adopted Harry. Severus called over to the Malfoy’s and requested that Harry stay there for dinner, and then made his way up to the Headmaster’s tower.
“What happened to the bad man, Father?” Severus tried to think quickly about how to describe the situation to the boys, and quickly made the choice to keep things as simple as possible for now.
“I don’t know. I need to ask my father. Is it okay if I take you with me to talk to him?” Harry could almost see the glow from inside the egg shift, as if whatever creature inside had moved.
Albus looked up as the monitor device on Harry began to spin and shriek again. Not truly concerned that anything was wrong, Albus walked over to the fireplace and threw in a pinch of Floo powder. If he didn't have to go into the Muggle world he would rather not, and he had a pawn under his thumb that would be perfect for checking on the situation without getting involved.
“Thank you, Poppy.” Severus nodded at Madam Pomfrey, and Harry moved until he was standing next to Severus.
“I also need to tell you that I adopted Harry. In a magical ceremony, almost as soon as I found him. I didn’t want Albus to be able to take him away. Harry is MY son now. The only reason that I am going along with Albus’s request for him to spend time with you is because I don’t want him to get any ideas about my feelings regarding Harry. The longer Albus stays in the dark, the safer Harry will be.” Remus stopped him by raising a hand.
“He’s a Parselmouth!” Remus exclaimed. Harry looked up and saw Severus and Remus, and went pale. He hissed something, and Remus got the impression that he was talking to them and didn't realize that he was still hissing.
“I can tell, Lupin. I know my son.” Severus muttered. Severus watched Harry for a moment, then gestured for Harry to come over.
“I was there when he was born! He’s part of me! Please, Severus, don’t keep me from him!” she could hear Remus pleading with Severus.
“Looks like you guys have been having a lot of fun. Are you ready for lunch?” Harry and Draco both nodded. The adults helped put the figurines back in the cabinet, and then the 4 of them headed down towards the dining room. Draco led the way, holding Harry's hand and telling him all about the things that they were going to do together as cousins/new best friends.
“I think that would be lovely. Thank you, Narcissa, for the offer. Would Monday be good to start?” Narcissa nodded gracefully.
From behind a hedge, Harry saw Remus Lupin step out, quickly followed by Lucius and his father. Harry couldn’t help but cry out, wanting to protect his father.
“Severus.” He paused for a moment and looked back. Lupin's head was hanging a little, and his voice sounded hoarse, like he was holding back tears.
Once he was sure that Remus had left, Severus cast a silencing charm to make sure that they wouldn’t be overheard. Harry shivered a little and the little snake hissed, making Severus eye her warily. Shadow had not come out of Harry’s room, and Severus wondered how the cat would react to Harry’s new friend.
“I'm okay, Shadow. I just don't like my hair.” Shadow jumped up on Harry's lap and let Harry wrap his arms around him, purring to try to help Harry feel better.
“So this prophecy is actually true. Harry has come back, as Arthur. The snakes, the wolf,” Severus pointed at Remus, who was still pale. “And all the powers of fae and magic. Holy hell.”
The boys had long gone to bed when Severus and Lucius got together to discuss how they were going to present Harry at the Winter Gala. They decided that they were going to introduce Harry merely as Severus's son, and hope that people didn't ask too many questions. Knowing that most of the pure blood adults paid little to no attention to the children, they thought that it would be a safe plan. They would also make sure to keep an eye on them. Instead of separating the children from the adults as usual, they would section off a small section of the ballroom and sound proof it, so that the children could play and not disturb the adults.
“I really liked the book with all the animals, but looking at it made my head hurt, so I laid my head down.” Severus thought for a moment. He remembered that James had worn glasses, and wondered if Harry had similar eye issues.
Harry sat at the table and stared at his half empty bowl. He was sad that he had been scared of Severus patting his head, worried that Severus was going to hit him the way that his uncle used to. He had seen the hurt flash across his father's face when he flinched away. No longer hungry, Harry got up from the table, and went and got his blanket from his room. He came back out to the living room and grabbed the book on families that Severus had showed him last night. He climbed up onto the couch and opened the book, looking for the pictures of his parents. He wrapped the blanket around his shoulders and balanced the book on his knees. He watched the pictures of his mom and dad smiling and looking out at him.
“She said that she would never bite anyone unless it was self-defense or to protect her Master. And she said that she would never hurt another creature unless to eat. She said that she knows that Shadow is young, like she is. They may play, but she won’t hurt him.” Severus sighed.
The gargoyle that guarded Albus’ office moved out of the way as they approached, indicating that Albus knew they were coming. Minerva stomped up the stairs, her temper evident in her carriage and demeanor, and Severus glided behind her, his face impassive. As they got to the top of the stairs, the door swung open. Albus didn’t even get up from his seat behind the desk.
“And what is to stop him from just attempting to kill Harry when he finds that he can’t escape?” Severus turned to Lucius, his face stone cold but fear behind his eyes. “I will not lose my son, Lucius.” The two men stood there for a moment, wracking their brains for how best to track Rowle and Harry, when another figure stepped out from the ballroom behind them.
“He’s going to need to focus on different things in his studies. Aside from the wandless magic, I would like his history to start including the knights, and their specialties. He will have to find his own knights, and knowing what the originals were focused on, I think, will help him choose. As will the lessons regarding being able to read people. He’s already demonstrated a strong ability to read people and his environment.” Severus sighed again, heavily. He hated what he was going to say next, but he knew that it was going to be important and helpful to his son. And no matter how uncomfortable it made him, he would do anything for Harry.
“I think I can walk.” Harry slipped out of the bed and pulled the covers back up, smoothing them so it looked like he had never been in it. Severus watched this with a tight expression, knowing exactly why Harry would do such a think and not liking it. He realized that he was going to have to do a lot of work to help Harry heal from what his family had put him through. Harry turned back to Severus, and Harry reached up to take the hand as Severus led him out of the infirmary.
Having completed everything he needed to do for the Wolfsbane Potion in about 2 hours, Severus went to collect Harry. He knocked on Remus’s door, surprised that he could hear Harry giggling on the other side. The door opened, and Remus quickly stepped aside to let Severus in. Harry jumped up from the chair he was sitting and ran over with a book in his hand.
“I am going to go back to the school and talk to him, before he does… whatever it is that beasts do during the holidays.” Lucius kept his impassive face on and nodded at Severus, but inwardly snickered at Severus’s venom. Narcissa smiled gently at Severus, ignoring it.
“I am going to go prepare for class. Tippy will look in on you from time to time, and will bring your lunch.” Severus stood up and went to run his hand along Harry's head affectionately. He saw Harry flinch, and then look even more sad. He knew that it was going to take time for Harry to trust that Severus wouldn't hurt him. Until then, he was going to keep demonstrating it. Severus continued with the motion and ruffled Harry's hair. Harry gave Severus a shaky smile.
The day seemed to drag on forever, and Severus made sure during one of his breaks to reach out to the Malfoys and request that Harry and Severus have dinner with them this evening. Severus wanted to discuss last night with Lucius and Narcissa, and possibly come up with a better plan for Harry’s tutoring.
“You are okay. I got you, my Harry.” Severus dropped to his knees and cradled Harry on his lap, checking him for any wounds or marks. Severus held him in his arms for long minutes while Lucius went over to Rowle’s form. Lucius picked up Rowle's wand, and watched as Rowle twitched on the ground. Remus came up beside Lucius.
Severus sighed. This was going to be harder than he thought. Harry was afraid to do anything, speak or eat without permission. He thought back to the circumstances that would cause a 6 year old to act that way and felt another surge of hatred for Lily's sister. How could someone do that to an innocent child.
“I talked to Draco's dad about the bad man, and that I promised to protect you because you are protecting me and we are family.” Severus had been taking a drink of water, and inhaled sharply at Harry's offhand comment about the 'bad man'. Severus coughed to clear his throat for a moment before responding.
“No… I mean, it does have to do with Harry, but not just that. It’s a lot.” Severus gestured towards one of the chairs next to the fireplace and Remus nodded, sitting down in the chair on the other side of the hearth.
Not wanting to startle the young boy, Severus knelt down and ran his hand over Harry’s head. “Harry… Harry, wake up.” The little boy whimpered, but didn’t wake. Severus got down on his knees and gently moved to pull Harry out from under the hedge. Harry whimpered again, but it was less sleepy and more pained. Severus realized that he must be more injured than he thought, and his rage at the monsters that had treated a child this way grew. His own childhood abuse made the harming of a child anathema to him. Working as quickly and as gently as he could, Severus magically cleaned the blanket that wrapped Harry and used it to slide Harry out so he could pick him up, being careful to not jostle him. As Harry was lifted up, he woke briefly. He saw a man with dark hair and dark eyes, and thought that maybe he was Death. He didn’t want to die, but anything was better than the pain in his side and his head. He wished that he could have convinced his aunt and uncle to love him, even a little.  As he was lifted, Harry passed back out from the pain.
“And how long has she been waiting to hatch… where ever she was.” Harry hissed again, and a longer hissing came from the serpent.
But first, he needed to put their home back together, and tell Minerva that he would not be able to teach classes the rest of the day.
“Oh, that poor boy. This is just awful. Well, he certainly cannot go back and live with his relatives any longer.”  Albus appeared to think for a moment, before his eyes settled on Severus and seemed to lighten with an idea. “Severus, as you were so kind as to bring him to us, I am placing Harry in your care. Permanently.” Severus kept his mind impassive, let a sneer cross his face and put as much resentment as he could into his voice. “You mean to saddle me with James Potter’s whelp?” Internally, he was dancing with joy. Being given the chance to take care of Lily’s child was like light coming down from the heavens to bless him. This way, he could be closer to the only part of her that remained.
I am so sorry for the wait! Between new job and holidays, this has been a crazy month. But here is the next chapter, and I am writing regularly so there will be more soon. Thank you so much all my readers!
Remus opened the door, and his eyes went wide to find Severus at his door again. He cocked his head.
“Narcissa is very smart. She knew that while hearing about you being hurt would make her sad for a little while, it would help you feel better. I am glad she did. And you can talk to me about it anytime. I am sure that Lucius would be willing to listen too, if you wanted to talk to him.”
“Narcissa is with the children. Draco said that as soon as the crash happened, a man came over and grabbed Harry and ran out the door. I’m guessing that he saw Harry’s scar. But he can’t Apparate while on the grounds, so we have a little bit of time.” Severus didn’t even spare Lucius a glance as he continued to try to discern which way Rowle went with his son.
“Thank you, Minerva. Please, just post something on my door letting the students know that classes are canceled for the day. You don't have to watch them all.” Minerva nodded, and wished Severus a good rest of his night.
“I am going to need to do some research, and I may have to spend more time around the werewolf than I wanted to, but if it saves Harry…” Lucius nodded.
My apologies for the long wait for this chapter. Now that summer is over, updates should be much more frequent.
As soon as they were done with morning lessons, Draco grabbed Harry's hand and started to lead him towards the dining room, chattering all the while about the animals that they had in the stables, and the ones that he wanted to see, and the different kinds of animals that he wanted to see, and the different kinds of magic that he  couldn't wait to learn. Draco explained that they couldn't learn until they got wands, and that wasn't until they were eleven, five long years. Draco led Harry into a large dining room, much fancier than Harry had ever been in. There was a long table, with four settings at one end. Draco directed Harry to sit next to him, and Narcissa joined them on the other side of the table.
“I know how you feel about me. Why are you telling me all this now? Did you think that I would fly into a temper and try to murder Dumbledore for his negligence?” Severus flushed mildly, knowing that his reasoning wasn’t too far off.
“Is there anything else, Potions Master?” Severus shook his head in the negative, and the creature popped out of the room. Harry jumped at the noise again.
“Your son is a menace. Especially when he’s hyper. And he’s rubbing off on Harry, because hyper Harry is becoming a lot like Draco. I blame you.” Lucius looked up, saw the smile on Severus’s face, and smirked.
“Are you sure that it’s a good idea to let such a monster around the students? Think of the school’s reputation?” Albus tut-tutted and waved his hand as if he was shooing away Severus’s objections.
“Best friend.” Harry let go and nodded, then let Severus lead him to the Floo. As they stepped through, they could hear Draco proclaim to his parents.
“I think that Remus would be okay with that. He might be able to tell you more about Nala.” Harry smiled back and slid off Severus’s lap. He picked up Nala and made his way to the door, turning to wait for Severus to take him to Remus’s room. Severus smiled at Harry. He was such an amazing little boy.
“He said that he made a mistake, and that he would help protect us because we are family. And he is going to teach me magic like the old knights from Merlin's story!” Severus raised an eyebrow and looked at Harry closely.
“Go ahead and look around. If you want a closer look, give a holler.” Severus nodded, and headed deeper into the shop. He looked at Harry. “We are going to find you a companion, so you aren't alone all day. We need to find something that you have a connection with. Like you did with the little dragon.” Harry nodded, and began to peer into the cages. He walked past cages with rats, and snakes, and puppies who had two tails. They were passing through cages of puppies and kittens when a lone black paw came out and caught a claw on the edge of Severus's sleeve.
Remus had just settled into his new quarters, not that it took much. It never took much. He didn’t expect to stay long in any one place, so he had never acquired much in the way of things to take with him. His toiletries bag went into the bathroom, and his clothes into the wardrobe. He had one picture frame on the desk, with a picture of better times. Sometimes he left the picture in his suitcase, if it was too hard to look at, but given where he was he was feeling particularly nostalgic. As he sat down to a cup of tea, he looked at the picture of the Marauders standing with Lily at the Potter wedding.
Remus sighed as he made his way home. At least he'd made a step, and gotten Severus to agree that he would get to spend more time around Harry. He decided that the first thing he was going to do was gather some things that he had from when Lily and James were alive.
“Uncle Sev! Uncle Sev! Tell my father that he should let me have the cat that I found in the garden! It wants to come home with me!” Harry didn't know what to make of the blond haired boy, but he thought that he sounded a lot like Dudley and looked a little bit like a girl. He had fine features and long, almost white hair.
Once Harry had woken from his nap, Severus asked if he wanted to play a game. He got out one of the wizarding games that was part puzzle game and part lesson about magic, and they spent a happy hour playing. The random sparks that shot out of the game made Harry giggle, but Severus could see that he was also very interested in the little wizards walking around and little pieces of information about wizards from the past. After the two of them had finished their game, Tippy let them know that it was time for dinner.
“All of the other guests are being escorted to the Floo. I have already set the wards so that he won’t be able to leave EXCEPT by Floo, and he will have to come back to the house to do so. He won’t take Harry away.” Lucius tried to comfort Severus.
“But… magic isn’t real. Magic is bad, and not real.” Harry began to shake, and seemed to shrink into himself. Snape moved forward slowly, remembering when he had been this age and did the same thing when trying to keep out of his father’s bad temper. He sat down on the chair next to Harry's bed, and Harry's eyes locked on the black eyes. He'd never seen black eyes before.
Severus came through the Floo to the Headmaster’s Quarters. He was rarely called here, not since the Dark Lord had disappeared 5 years ago. Most of Severus’ time was spent dealing with obnoxious children who didn’t want to be bothered to properly learn Potions and fulfilling his Head of House duties. Severus was surprised that instead of the quiet of the tower, there was a shrill screech coming from one of the nick-knacks that cluttered Albus's office.
Severus sneered, and thought that he wasn't sure if he was sneering at having to deal with Petunia for the first time since they were children or having to take up his time running errands for Albus in the Muggle world. “And what, Albus, should I be worried about with Mr. Potter? Are we sure that his distress is something that needs to be checked on? I am sure that he’s merely throwing a tantrum because his family won’t buy him his favorite toy or another treat?”
“I am going to escort you today, but I think you will be able to go over by yourself in the future. If you are comfortable with that?” Severus always made sure that he asked Harry before just making decisions, a little way for him to give Harry a measure of control in his life.  Harry nodded slowly, and Severus held out his hand.
“I'm sorry, I'm so sorry Father. I didn't mean to break anything, I didn't know what would happen, I'm sorry...” his voice cracked on a sob, and renewed tears streamed down his face. Severus knelt down in front of the wardrobe.
Harry had stopped eating. He felt very overwhelmed. Things were changing so fast, and his tummy hurt like he had been spun around fast for too long. He took a couple of deep breaths, trying to settle his stomach. Severus recognized the look of panic on Harry's face. Too much too soon. He crouched down next to Harry's chair and covered Harry's hand with his.
“It was the blanket that came with me when I was a baby. It's the only thing that I have from my parents... it's the only thing that's mine.” Severus nodded, understanding now why it was so important.
Harry stood up and walked over, gently running his fingers over the dragon and the unicorn curled together. He smiled.
“Lucius… you said that basilisk venom could destroy the items?” They had come to the determination that they were not going to say the name of the items in mixed company. Lucius nodded.
“I know that this makes you sad. It makes me sad too. But the fact of the matter is that no one knows what happened to that evil man. There are some people, like myself, who think that the man might come back, and that would put you in danger. Or that people who followed the evil man might want to hurt you. That's why it's so important to me that you get lessons with Draco and Narcissa. Because they are going to make sure that you understand the wizarding world better, and help you know how to protect yourself no matter the situation.” Harry looked at Severus for a minute, then threw his arms around Severus's neck.
“Ari!” Draco called. A house elf in a green tea towel appeared. “Please clean my room and fix the things that I broke.” The house elf looked around the room and sighed, shaking his head.
“Hey, hey, it's all right. I wasn't changing my mind. And I wasn't upset because you were crying. I just didn't want you to think that I was the only person that you could go with. Everyone here wants to make sure that you are happy and safe.” Severus looked over at Minerva and Poppy, and both ladies nodded in agreement.
The dragons paced around the table, some of them roaring or flying, others sitting and looking imperious. Harry stood next to the table, and one of the dragons moved towards him. It was beautiful, with blue, silver, and purple highlights on it's wings and back. Harry held his hand out, and the dragon appeared to sniff his fingers before climbing onto his hand. It circled once, twice, three times before curling up like a kitten and appearing to go to sleep, a tiny curl of smoke coming from it's snout.
“Harry, now that you are going to be living with me, there are things that you are going to need to know about the wizarding world. We are going to go through things each night, and I don't expect that you are going to remember them the first time that we go through them, or even the second. But if we start reviewing these things now, when you are older and start attending school, these things will become like second nature.” Harry blinked a couple of times and nodded, although he wasn't really sure what his new father was talking about. Severus opened the book to a page around the middle.
“Shadow! What are you doing?! I can’t leave the rooms! Father will be mad!” Harry hissed quietly. Shadow glared back at him, and almost looked like he was telling Harry to be quiet. Shadow slinked out the door and then turned back as if waiting for Harry to follow him. Harry looked back at the door to Severus’s room, where he could hear quiet snoring. He didn’t want his father to be mad at him, but something in him said that this was important. Mr. Malfoy said it was important to trust his instincts, and this felt like instincts to Harry.
“That, Draco, is my son Harry.” Draco's eyes got so wide, Harry thought that they might pop out of his head.
Severus left the door to Harry's room partially open, and spent the rest of his evening researching curses and long term effects of curse scars.
He made sure to stay away from the kids, but he kept an eye on Severus and Lucius to make sure that they were nowhere near the kids or him when he made his move. He kept his wand behind his robes and aimed it at the buffet table. Rowle started moving towards the corner with the kids as there was a loud crash. The dishes of food started to slide onto the floor, and ladies started screaming as their beautiful dress robes were stained with the mixed food. Severus and Lucius made their way towards the table, and all of the kids turned to see what was causing the commotion.
“I so swear.” Golden light appeared and swirled around him, glimmering like dust motes in sunshine. Harry giggled and reached out his hand towards it.
Draco proceeded to place the creatures all up and down Harry's arms and shoulders and even on his head. All of the animals acted like Harry was catnip to their cats, and walked all over him and played with each other. Draco was delighted, and convinced Harry to sit down on the floor so that he could do the same with his legs while Harry giggled at the sensation of the tiny animals running around on him like he was a playground.
“Lily and James Potter were amazing and selfless people, and they died protecting you.” Harry licked his lips.
“Have you picked out a name for this little one?” Severus placed the tiny dragon on Harry's bedside table. The dragon had come with a stand that included a little nest, and the dragon made it's way up and curled up in it's nest.
“That traitor adopted the Dark Lord’s greatest enemy. I am going to put you somewhere where they will never find you, and when the Dark Lord returns those traitors will get what they deserve. Which is a slow and painful death.” The man looked down at the boy in his arm. “Probably the same for you. Once the Dark Lord gets rid of traitors and you, there won’t be anything in his way. And I will be his most trusted and respected.” Harry felt something inside him go cold. This monster was going to hurt his family. His father, who took care of him and loved him like no one he could remember. His cousin Narcissa, and Lucius, and Draco. Harry could feel himself start shivering, more scared for his family than himself. He knew that he could deal with whatever this man would do to him, but he couldn’t let him hurt his family.
“Dad! No, he’s bad! He follows the bad man!” Harry cried. He couldn't let the bad man hurt his family.
“Are you my Master?” Harry didn’t think so, but he didn’t want to do anything else without talking to his father first.
“Father, look! Nala is an Occamy, and she can fly, and grow to whatever size she wants, and when she has eggs they are going to be silver, and she’s really rare!” Harry chattered, sounding a lot like Draco. Nala lifted her head to look at Severus from the chair where Harry had been sitting, and Shadow came trotting up from somewhere else in the room, chirping hello.
“Yes. I am sure now that Harry is the Promised King. And that Occamy egg had been waiting in the chamber for him to get there so it could hatch and be his familiar. I can’t even imagine what is in the rooms of the individual founders. I believe that it will be a great wealth of knowledge that Harry will need to have as he gets older and his powers grow. Gods, with his powers as they are now, I can’t imagine him being stronger.” Severus sighed. If he was this stressed out about protecting his son now, after only a couple of months, he didn’t know how he was going to make it until Harry was an adult. Narcissa caught the look on Severus’s face and laughed lightly.
“You will never be in trouble for asking questions. Questions are important for learning to think for yourself and not following blindly. If you have questions about anything, it's always better to ask.” Lucius thought that it was a rather lovely small lesson, but was blindsided by the luminous emerald eyes that met his without fear for the first time.
Remus sat in front of his tiny fireplace, drinking a cup of tea laced with whiskey and staring at the fire. He had known that his werewolf would react protectively if Harry was in danger, but he was a little concerned that should Harry ever be hurt, he wouldn’t be able to stop his wolf from taking over and ripping the arms off whoever hurt him. Which, Remus thought, may not be a bad thing, given rumors that Voldemort’s disappearance was only temporary.
“I should have told you that the books were magical, and that they didn't like to be touched. That's why the house elves clean them, because they can do so without touching them.” Harry nodded against his shoulder.
A house elf in a rose colored tea towel appeared next to her. “Please gather all of the clothing that Draco has outgrown in the past 6 months and bring them to Tippy for young Harry, please.” The house elf bowed and disappeared. Severus was touched at how quickly Narcissa had accepted Harry as his son. Lucius had yet to say anything, but he knew that he would stand by Narcissa without question. Finally, Lucius spoke his mind.
I am SO sorry that it's taking so long to get Harry and Draco introduced. The story is playing out the way that it is, and I can't just cut it short. But I promise, many more amazing things will happen, and the very first thing that will happen next chapter is Draco and Harry getting to know each other.
“If you think that I am going to let MY son spend time around…” Narcissa came into the room, interrupting whatever insult Severus was going to throw at Remus. All of the men stopped speaking when she stepped in, Lucius standing up behind his desk but not putting down the glass of fire whiskey that he had obviously poured to enjoy the argument between Severus and Lucius.
“Wonderful! I know that the two of you will work out a schedule for Remus to spend time with Harry. No less than once a week, I think, to start.” Albus popped a lemon drop in his mouth before continuing. “Young Harry is very important, Severus. I believe that Voldemort will return, and it will be Harry’s destiny to face him. He must be trained and stand firmly on the side of Light if we are to prevail.” Albus was looking off into the distance, and missed the brief look of incredulity before Severus’s mask dropped down across his face.
I'm sorry about the not meeting Draco yet. I promise, next chapter! Thank you everyone for reading and subscribing, I can't believe how many amazing people have been so supportive. I love you all!
At this point, Draco had a great idea. He looked around his room. Maybe Harry could come over, and Draco could show him all his toys, and the gardens, and the stables with all the horses and Pegasi... Draco realized that Harry could be his best friend. WOULD be his best friend. He was often frustrated with how quiet his room was, and the house elves wouldn't play with him because they all had WORK to do. Draco had a plan.
“Harry is currently asleep on Narcissa’s lap in the lady’s study. She sent me away, and I kept the boys away, so I got the impression that whatever they were talking about was very serious.” Severus set the glass down without drinking it, and started making his way towards the study. He stepped into the doorway and saw Narcissa, face drawn as if she was exhausted, looking at him above Harry’s curled up sleeping form. Seeing him, Narcissa gently started waking Harry up.
“Severus. You seem to have acquired a child. This is most unusual.” The man in the painting had a weird accent that sounded almost like a lisp. Harry looked at the man in the painting and blinked sleepily.
“You can call me Remus, if you want.” Harry nodded, and went to gather Nala. Severus and Harry left, Shadow making cat comments as he followed them out. Remus moved his chairs back to the way they had been before, and sat down. The feeling of cheer lingered in the air, along with the smell of Harry. It had been the best Christmas Remus had in a long time.
“I like that name. It sounds very heroic!” Harry exclaimed. Severus smiled at the exuberance that Harry would not have shown when he first came to live with him.
Severus made his way back to the infirmary as quickly as possible, and got to the doors at the same time as Minerva. She was wearing her dressing gown but Severus didn't feel bad for interrupting her night, but in order to get her assistance he would pretend that he did.
“You are more than welcome to ask me whatever you like. If I don’t know the answer, I can try to research it.” Harry looked down at the Occamy, who had curled up in Harry’s lap. She was about a meter long, and seemed content to doze in the heat of the room.
“Well, I want to go with you.” For someone so small and, until a couple of minutes ago, scared to tears, Harry seemed quite determined.  Severus nodded, and then nodded to Minerva to begin. Severus moved closer to the bed so he was standing next to Harry.
Severus was taking deep breaths, doing his best to not panic at what he had just discovered about his son. A piece of the Dark Lord was attached to his innocent son. A ferociousness that he had never known, even more than when Lily died, welled up from deep inside him. He would get that slimy piece of monster away from his son if it was the last thing that he did, he swore by Merlin and Morgana. He was startled when Lucius's hand again touched his shoulder. He had all but forgotten that Lucius was there.
Severus walked over to the bed where Harry was curled up, crying softly. “Harry,” he said. “Harry, if you don't want to stay with me, you don't have to. I only want to protect you.” At the thought that Severus might be taking his offer back, Harry sat back up.
The salt shaker wobbled for a moment, and then fell over. Lucius sat up straight in his chair, eyes wide as he stared at Harry. Narcissa and Draco were both staring at Harry like he had just turned into a unicorn in the dining room. Harry grinned, and looked proudly between Narcissa and Lucius.
“Lupin. May I come in?” Remus moved back and let Severus come in. He had expected Albus to come and check and see if he was settling in, or perhaps Minerva, but never Severus. He figured that they would exist in a solid state of Severus’s snide and spiteful comments and his own calm patience while he was at Hogwarts, but apparently he was mistaken.
Once they had finished eating, Severus had Harry come over to the couch, and he pulled a book of the bookshelf.
He was feeling full already, and thinking about his relatives made his tummy hurt, so he put his spoon down. Severus saw the pained look in his son's eyes, and his heart hurt because he knew that it was going to take a long time to heal.
“Harry, what your relatives did, how they treated you, that wasn't right. That isn't how you should have been treated. And we aren't going to let you go back there. If you are okay with it, you can stay here.” Severus took a deep breath. “You could stay here with me.”
Severus, Narcissa, and Lucius had quickly decided that whatever had happened tonight would be discussed later, once they made sure that Harry was okay. Lucius and Narcissa attempted to get Draco to go to bed, but when he continued to refuse, allowed him to stay and went to bed themselves. Severus continued to sit at Harry’s bedside and watched him sleeping, checking his temperature and vitals almost like clockwork on the hour. He understood now why Narcissa had sat up with Draco all night when he was ill, and the worry that had plagued Lucius on occasion. Severus thought about how Harry had reacted to the situation earlier. He didn’t seem to care about his own well being, only his family. And then, there was the judgment… He didn’t know if Harry remembered what happened, but he would help his son deal with whatever repercussions lingered after tonight.
“I know no such thing, and you seemed more than capable of taking a life or infecting another when I came face to face…” Severus was on his feet now, and he and Remus were face to face.
With what happened on the night of the Yule Gala, the adults in Harry's life figure out a little piece of what's going on with Harry. Severus and Remus get into it a little.
“Uncle, what do you want me to use to clean the hallway?” Vernon sneered at him. “Well, since we don’t want any of our things to touch your filth, you use your blanket.”
Harry blinked, not really understanding. His hands clasped and then curled under his chin. He was scared, but didn't know what he was supposed to do. His bottom teeth began to worry at his lip. Severus knew this for what it was, and knew that Harry was feeling scared and overwhelmed. Smiling gently to reassure the small boy, Severus wanted to give him the good news.
The beginning of the new week had to come eventually. Severus made sure that Harry was up and dressed in a reasonably nice outfit (although none of Harry's new clothing was less) and made sure that he had a good breakfast. Once Harry was ready Severus took him to the Floo.
“That is an admirable goal, and I would be so happy to help you fulfill it.” Lucius came into the room, followed by the other boys.
“That’s true.” Lucius put the book down and gave Severus a look that indicated he was going to say something Severus wouldn’t like. Since Narcissa was reading the boys a pre-nap story, Severus sat down in one of the chairs across from him. “Well, you might as well say it.”
“Of course, Severus. Step back, I will come through. “ A moment later, she stepped into his office and immediately moved towards the classroom as she shooed him off with her hands. Severus threw more Floo powder in and called for his chambers.
Vernon wasn’t done with the freak. He leaned down and grabbed Harry by the hair.  “You are going to clean up every inch of this hallway, you disgusting freak. And then, because you stink like piss, you are going to sleep outside in the back yard. We can hose you off tomorrow”.  Harry’s eyes widened. It was October, and was getting very cold at night. Harry got up, moving carefully because his side hurt when he moved too fast.
“Draco, what have I told you about using the Floo without your parent's permission?” Draco stopped in the middle of the room, and stared at the boy who was sitting on his uncle's couch.
Once inside the Founder’s Chambers, Severus sat Harry down on one of the ancient wing back chairs, and sat down in another.
“Well. It has been a very exciting evening. We should get you to bed, my special boy. Maybe I will figure out a way to make this easier to understand.” Harry smiled at his father, and they made their way towards the door.
“Not at all, Severus, but what in Merlin’s name are you doing wandering the halls disillusioned like that?” Severus’ face grew grave, and he stepped to the side so that Minerva could see the tiny figure floating behind him. “I am afraid that I am taking care of one of the Headmaster’s grave mistakes.” Minerva gasped as she got a look at who was wrapped in the blanket. Even with the messy hair and blanket wrapped around him, the scar on his forehead was clear.
“I love it. It's so pretty. It's really for me?” Severus looked down at his serious little boy who had become so important to him in such a short amount of time. He saw the hope and joy warring in his eyes with with the pain and weariness from his previous home. Severus knew that he would give anything to make that pain go away forever.
“Like how I thought that Mr. Malfoy was mean to begin with, but now I know that he’s really not, he’s just really serious?” Severus nodded.
“I do!” Remus went to his bookshelf and pulled a book down. He moved his chair so that they two chairs were side by side. He opened the book to the chapter he marked. “So, your friend, Nala, is an Occamy…”
“Minerva… and Severus? This is a surprise. What can I do for you this evening?” Both Severus and Minerva had grim looks on their faces, and Pomfrey was surprised when a tiny child appeared between the two of them, hovering over to the bed closest to her office. Madam Pomfrey looked between the two of them, and then at the child in shock. Why had they brought such a tiny child to her? The child was much too small to be a student. Then she saw the boy’s face, and the scar, and she knew.
Rowle had never been able to get the attention from the Dark Lord that Severus or Lucius had. He didn't have vaults full of money, or political influence, or a talent with Potions unmatched anywhere else in the world. But what he did have was an old estate, far off from anywhere and unknown to almost everyone. He'd never hosted revels there, or the Dark Lord. If he were able to capture the Boy-Who-Lived and keep him until the Dark Lord's return, he would be the most honored of all of his followers. All he needed was a distraction...
“It’s too long to go into before dinner, so I will start with the easiest bit of news. I found out that Harry is a Parselmouth.” Lucius and Narcissa looked at each other with wide eyes. While being a Parselmouth had negative connotations through some circles, in theirs it was widely known as a powerful and highly respected magical gift.
Harry continued to be a serious and polite little boy, but he began to open up more to those he considered his family. This included Severus, Draco and his parents, and Tippy (much to Severus’s amusement and Lucius’s dismay). Tippy adored Harry and began to clean the chambers while Harry was around instead of silently and invisibly in the middle of the night. She began to carry a feather duster around while she was cleaning and straightening, which puzzled Severus since he knew that her elf magic made all dust just disappear. Until the evening when he caught her tickling Harry with it and Harry running around his room giggling, and teasing Shadow with it. Once he saw that, he merely smiled and refrained from commenting.
“I... Harry, wandless magic magic is very advanced, and very difficult. It takes a very powerful person to be able to do even a little, and it takes many years to learn. Are you sure that you want to try to learn?” Harry nodded, a determined look at odds with his youthful face. Lucius knew that he was going to have to talk to Severus about the conversations today. He decided that he was going to try a little test.
“Well, the snakes helped you get away from him, like you asked. And the Aurors took the bad man away. You won’t ever have to worry about that man again.” Harry nodded, and seemed content to cuddle with Draco and Severus. It wasn’t long before Severus could hear deep breathing coming from both boys. Severus let out a sigh of relief that Harry wouldn’t have to deal with the memory of Rowle’s death at his young age. He had already been through too much. Making sure the boys were fully sleeping, Severus moved them so they were in the bed and covered them both up. Leaving a small light on in the corner and setting an alarm spell to let him know if either of the boys woke, Severus made his way to his room to finally sleep. He felt drained after being so worried for so many hours.
“Sometimes people make mistakes. Like Father and Lucius did about following the bad man. Or like I did, leaving our rooms without talking to Father.” Merlin, the connections that Harry made. Remus rubbed his forehead, trying to organize his thoughts.
Harry walked over to where Shadow was sitting. On the floor next to a silver and green wing backed chair was a basket, and in the basket was an egg. The egg was black with a silver sheen across it, and it almost looked like it had scales. It also seemed to glow faintly from inside. Harry reached out to touch it when he heard something speaking from inside.
Severus went into his study and sat down at his desk, looking over at the picture of Lily that was on his desk. He remembered when she gave him the picture, and smiled. The picture was of Lily with Harry on her lap, and both of them were smiling and laughing. Harry would clap his hands and wave, and then both of them would smile and laugh again. Lily had sent Severus the picture just before she died, and Severus spoke to it often.
Harry started to eat again, looking significantly less afraid and more settled. Then he paused again.
“Yes, Draco. Harry may stay over this evening. Now, the two of you go wash up for dinner.” Both boys made their way out of the room to wash up, chattering about the stories they were going to tell before they went to sleep and Draco telling Harry about previous Christmas celebrations. Severus sighed carefully, happy to see Harry so happy and animated but strongly aware of the weight of the knowledge that swirled around his young son.
“Master Snape, there is a nasty book breaking all the things, and I cannot find Master Harry!” Snape blanched. Which book was wreaking havoc in his chambers? Was Harry hurt? Severus dashed to the Floo and called Minerva, who he knew had a free period.
“Harry, I will see you in a couple hours. Have fun.” He said, before sweeping off. Remus smothered a smiled as he closed the door. He turned to Harry, who was running his finger gently over the Occamy’s head and studying Remus. The black cat was moving around the room, poking his nose into corners and bookshelves.
“No, Sirius Black almost killed you, and in the process, would have gotten Remus killed as well. And now he’s languishing in Azkaban. Perhaps you should leave the blame where it belongs. Remus has admitted that there is a pack bond with Harry, which means that he would NEVER hurt him. No matter what form he’s in. And by association, as Harry’s father, he now has a pack bond with you. In case it escaped you, that means that should the same situation arise, where you are confronted with Remus on the night of the full moon without the Wolfsbane potion, he wouldn’t hurt you either.” Lucius loved pointing things out when Severus missed them. Severus got a look on his face that Lucius rarely got to see, embarrassment mixed with anger and almost as if he was smelling something rotten that had gotten stuck to his shoes. Severus muttered under his breath.
Shadow led Harry through the hallways, going to parts of the castle that Harry had never seen before. Before long, Harry was standing in from of a gargoyle statue. Harry stood there for a moment and studied it as Shadow sat next to his feet. After a moment, Harry felt a wave of tingles over his skin that he recognized as magic sweeping him from head to toe. Then the gargoyle tilted it’s head down to look at him.
“Lucius, I know that you guessed my loyalties were not completely with the Dark Lord years ago. I also know that you would do nothing to risk your family.  Should the Dark Lord rise again, I will do everything in my power to see him ground to dust before he lays a hand on my son.” Lucius reached out to hold Narcissa's hand, remembering how his previous actions as a Death Eater had almost shattered their marriage. “It is my thought that you should help me. Help me teach Harry about his heritage and the traditions in our world that are so important. Help me do everything to put that bastard in the ground.
