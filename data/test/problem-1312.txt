"Potter." Draco's voice was sharp, a knife through the air.
Draco headed to his common room, knowing he had a free coming up, expecting to have peace and quiet there.
-A/N:  Thanks for reading. This is a slow burn.
“Let’s go to the bedroom,” Draco groaned, as Harry kissed down his neck.
Tempted, Harry had to pull away.  “No, not until you can call me by my first name and I know you are happier.”  He stood up, tugging Draco along with him.
Draco decided it'd be best to tell Harry right then and there about his letter. If he waited til tomorrow to tell Harry, he could get upset before the day even begun.
"I'm finished." Harry said.
"Wait, Umbridge forced you to this?!" Ginny gaped.
"You too! And yes, he needed to get out of the house." Pansy explained.
"Thanks." Harry held his phone for him to take.
"Oh, so your a virgin?" Draco assumed.
"Mhm, I turned 11 today..I reckon you're younger, or do robots not have ages?" Draco hummed.
"Maybe." Harry laughs.
"Ok, this is getting a little weird.." Blaise grimaced.
"Oh, hey..yeah." Harry shrugged.
"Same thing." Pansy shrugged.
She doesn't know what it was like for people like us, growing up.
"Oh, Draco! Are you seeing someone?" Hermione perked.
"He is? I wouldn't have known-" Ronald scoffed.
"It's Harry's birthday, I allowed him to borrow it." Draco replied.
Thank you for reading :)
See Potter, shut up bitch! I'm trying to talk!
"Draco, of course she's intolerable, but what makes you think that'll somehow work out in any of our favors?" Hermione wondered.
"You can do that??" Draco sat beside him in amusement.
Harry laughed, even if his face hurt like hell, he was sure feeling happy about his new proclaimed friend.
"My parents, they would adore you, and, you're friends with Ron..If you need a second-family, you can always join us for brunch." Ginny offered.
"No, but you weren't this irritable 10 minutes ago." Draco noted.
"Fine, just don't be annoying." Draco sighed.
Harry obliged, even more confused than before.
"You mean the world to me." Draco flushed, and Harry assumed he flushed too. Harry sorta thought Draco's choice of words sounded like something a boyfriend would say, which he knew was a ridiculous assumption..but for some reason it made him feel quite giddy.
"I just wanna know where they came from." Draco sighed.
"You're loud enough." Ginny insisted.
"She'll find out within an instant, then we'll get into more trouble..I don't know about you, but her yelling is unbearable." Harry huffed.
"Hey." Harry answered.
"You are mad sassy Harry, we would know." Ronald agreed.
"I'm sorry-" Dean apologized.
I can relate to what your saying in your books.
Something itched at Harry, urging him to email the anonymous sky gazer.
"Should I lock her in the office?" Draco whispered.
"It's up to Harry, considering he turned 11 today.." Draco says.
"How about we do something interesting? Perhaps a palm reading?" Luna suggested.
"Pansy, you know absolutely nothing on how to comfort someone..did you see the stadium? Of course she's here somewhere, the problem is how to find her." Draco scoffed.
"No.." Harry shook his head.
"B-baby?" Harry flushed.
"Yeah..actually, my nickname is qt." Planter P shared.
He knew the punishment could've been worse, but Draco simply didn't care..he was looking forward to the holidays. His parents would host a formal Christmas Ball and invite tons of wizarding families, most of them being purebloods of course.
"Ok, yeah..you're right, I'll be fine." Harry determined.
"Yeah..hey, did you change out my sweater?" Draco noticed.
"You're being too nice, it's throwing me off." Draco buried his head into his knees.
Harry strutted to his seat, burying his face on the desk.
Harry entered Lockhart's office, keen on retrieving his phone.
At first, Harry was beyond pissed about Draco..he drove Harry to his level of stupidity..but also, Draco wouldn't have known, so it wasn't even his fault..Harry was just hurt.
"I understand." Luna sympathized.
"How are you Harry?" Pansy asked.
Harry peeked at the scene, wanting to see what was going on for himself.
Harry had learned he was in a coma for a month, 1 broken leg, two broken wrists, and one arm completely broken.
Anyways, I hope you get this back, write me back, just to chat?
"Just proves my point..and yes." Pansy smirked.
"Yeah, forget I said anything." Harry shakes his head.
"There, no pencil I hope!" Harry smiled shakily.
"I'm sorry?" Draco blinked.
"Can I sit here?" The blonde headed boy asked.
"Done..is there anything else you want me to do?" Harry wondered.
"I'll be the judge of that..however, I need to unpack my belongings first." Draco decided.
"It's ok Harry..no, I did it on my own terms." Draco confirmed.
"Here, give me your arm." He instructed.
"..harry."
"Yeah, tell them I had to leave please." Draco said.
"Lucius orders." Harry replied.
"How long have you been in here for?" Draco asked.
Harry already felt the tears pouring again, worsening his already shitty eyesight. Harry was about to turn, until the car in front of him collided with his.
"It's very heavy." Harry mentioned.
"I'm really good, so I find that hard to believe." Draco scoffed.
"Hmm, you must really like this person Draco." Hermione assumed.
"What are we gonna do then? Sit and talk? To me this just sounds like detention with a different room number." Draco snorted.
When Draco filled Harry in about what the holidays were like at the Manor, Harry had been fascinated by the idea of going to a Christmas Ball.
"Woah, what's happening to Harry's hair?" Daphne wondered.
"Wait, can't I come with Draco?" Harry asked.
"When I asked my date to the Yule Ball, she admitted to me that she assumed I was gay..I wonder why all females seem to already know." Draco snorted.
I apologize if the chapters are short.
"Warn a bloke perhaps?? And no, I'm not! Ron Weasley stalked Hermione when she was at the library yesterday." Harry explained.
"I lived with him, I know way more than you do! Harry's been nothing but kind to you, he only did otherwise because you insulted his friend!" Draco protested.
5:00 pm
4:00 pm
September 1st
"Indeed, it's nearly the size of my parents room! Now, let me introduce you to my snake." Draco walked to it's cage.
"You should ask Pansy, I'm pretty sure she fancies you." Ron assumed.
"Well the bus is out front, have a good day!" Lily smiled.
"Harry Styles has more meaning." Harry claimed.
Warning: Umbridge calls one of the students fat, it's only in 1 line, feel free to skip over it if you want :)
"Did we lose?" Harry asked.
"That's your sister." Draco glared.
"Hey! I'm being nice right now, aren't I?" Draco thought.
"No worries, just come by after school to get your phone from my office!" Lockhart smiled.
"Uh..you can refer to me as Sky." Draco decided.
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?
Harry knew many people in his school, but was closest with Ron Weasley, Parvati Patil, and Hermione Granger. Harry knew Ron and Parvati since elementary, but his bond with Hermione was just as strong. Hermione adjusted to the group in only 6 months, and she fit in perfectly.
"I put the lock there!" Harry blurted.
"O-oh, I'm Harry." Harry replied.
"I've never had a best friend before, nor a friend..you're the first person who's ever cared about me." Harry smiled shyly.
"I think you're both wrong, and I can prove it-" Hermione disagreed.
the pain is such a sudden rush for me.
"I've never seen your hair in this state..someone must've casted a hair spell on him!" Draco guessed.
"Dear god I will never be that careless again! I thought I'd never find you!" Hermione squeezed his arm.
Harry was a bit surprised when Draco interlaced there fingers, but he found himself liking that too.
Please note my intention was not for Draco to originally be a Hufflepuff, but it kinda just happened as I was writing this chapter..It won't change Draco's character too much, it'll simply be a different atmosphere. I hope you don't mind Neville being in Hufflepuff, there's really not a lot of canon Hufflepuff's and I felt he was my best option. Thanks for reading :)
"I know. You can tell me anything, even if I don't understand, I'll always be there for you." Harry promised.
"Also, I know this isn't my place, but Ginny's latest relationship was with Dean Thomas, not Harry." Hermione claimed.
"That is not what I'm referencing..someone's gonna be staring at my bottom!" Draco complained.
"Maybe, if miss know it all tones it down." Umbridge shrugs.
"I knew you weren't gonna actually take a piss..besides, I wanna know what's wrong." Harry shrugged.
"Thank you, Draco." Harry sighed with a smile.
"I don't care about this little argument, what are they doing here Draco? Your mother and I specifically said no party." Lucius reminded.
"It will be over before you know it, I see Snape right now..besides I think a certain blonde boy was chatting with Harry here." Hermione smirked.
"Yeah, you heard about me breaking the windows?" Draco assumed.
Draco didn't feel like arguing with his robot any longer, and instead drifted off to sleep at the sound of his favorite bedtime story..
Draco climbed into his bed, feeling a great lump in his throat..was it weird to have a robot? His friends sure thought so..and he really looked forward to his mother reading him a bedtime story.
"Yes and no..but that doesn't matter, you kept me from getting hurt! How should I repay you, mate??" Ron wondered.
"What can he do?" Ron wondered.
Even though Harry insisted that he could get on the boat fine without falling into the water, it didn't stop Draco from practically carrying him to one.
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside of your book fest, you didn't have to..but you could've signed an autograph for Marco.
"What are you on about, Harry?" Draco stopped walking.
"Honesty looks better on you both." Luna noted.
Draco wants to lock Umbridge in her office, Hermione elaborates on jealousy, Luna speaks once every thirty minutes, Ginny talks about her brothers, and Harry is scared of Umbridge's "pencil."
"Is it supposed to be an internet acronym?" Draco figured.
Grade: First Day of Middle School
"I should too, Pansy will exaggerate the whole conversation." Harry leant next to the pillar with her.
"Are you close with them?" Hermione asked.
"He isn't a doll honey." Narcissa defined.
"Surprising? Yes. But it is quite cool, that you bake." Harry thought.
"Yes, maybe." Luna shrugged.
Draco turned to the 4 with a proud smile, not bothering to respond to Umbridge's protests.
"If he can't get used to you he'll have to deal with it." Draco dismissed.
"How do robot's celebrate their birthday?" Pansy sat next to them.
"Look through our contacts, we might have possible mutuals." Pansy handed her and Draco's phone to him.
"She meant the mood, not the way it's placed." Harry rolled his eyes.
Neville
"Don't touch him!" Harry ran in between them, guarding Draco.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry kissed back right away, adjusting to the feeling of Draco's mouth on his..and of course, he was an amazing kisser..but boy did it hurt.
"Do you want me to give you less orders today?" Draco offered.
What he wasn't expecting, was Theodore Nott standing shirtless right in front of Draco.
"I'm such a bad person..here you are being so kind to me, while I just did something awful a little over an hour ago.." Draco frowned.
"What if I c-can't find her and w-we aren't able to t-take the train h-home." Harry panicked.
Now for him to wait..
"Yeah..I know it happened years ago, but sometimes I wish we were still friends..I've mentioned it to Theo, but he never liked her much, so he didn't really get it I guess.." Draco trailed off.
"Hey, don't say mean things about Neville!" Harry defended.
"I beg your pardon?" Hermione questioned.
But of course, some random ass person had to walk right in between there intertwined hands, causing them to split apart.
"Thank you..there's so many other blokes, what makes you think Harry of all people?" Ginny wondered.
Draco wasn't dumb he obviously knew what the spell would do..but blimey, did this mean Planter P wanted to touch him?! He needed to mentally prepare himself before the clock hit..Draco needed to think rational. Planter P was clearly distressed, and this was him simply calming his friend down..nothing to overthink, right??
"Right here!" Draco decided as he sat in an empty compartment.
We waited in the blistering cold for you, four hours and you just said "no."
"How is Gryffindor?" Harry asks.
Draco had to agree with him on that.
"Yeah, an annoying nickname." Draco scoffed.
"Not currently, no..are you alright?" Draco wondered.
I don't really have much to do, so they help when I'm depressed.
"I have a pencil, I think you need it." Umbridge sneered.
"But I listen to Draco." Harry said.
It was.
"Asking for a friend on this, are you single?" Pansy wondered.
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call!
"I suppose that's true, thank you for the gift..should I introduce myself?" Draco shrugged.
"Maybe Weaslette can give me the details? Unless his was small?" Draco snorted.
"About the closeted gay guy at school." Parvati replied.
"Zacharias Smith." Smith replied flatly.
"First time at a concert?" The girl guessed.
"Happy birthday." Draco wished to his robot.
"It depends..I stayed in a cupboard for all of my previous birthday's." Harry shrugged.
"So did I.." Draco chuckled.
Harry mumbled, trying so hard to speak but his voice was almost inaudible.
"Harry, no offense Dray but that sounds like such an adopted name." Pansy scoffed.
"Who the hell is this anyway?? You must know who they are!" Draco accused.
"Sort me into my house." Draco replied.
"I'm s-so s-o-rry, I didn't c-call so-oner. I m-iss y-you, so m-uch." Harry hiccuped.
"It's my natural hair..Lucius made sure to spell it so I'd look less atrocious. Maybe it wore off?" Harry explained.
"That sounds- wait! Where are my parents?" Harry looked around.
"Dray? Draco?" Harry observed.
"I almost cried twice! But, why didn't you check the seats first?" Harry wondered.
"Can Harry eat or drink?" Neville wondered.
"Look at how uncenetery this is..what if we're getting chased, this tunnel would do us no good." Draco crawled inside.
"Home-made is traditionally best." Draco claimed.
"Is that so?" McGonagall questioned.
"Were you eavesdropping?" Draco accused.
"I'm not!" Harry insisted.
"Because you helped my elbow and I helped you with a name, does it mean we can be friends?" Harry concluded.
Harry should be screaming with joy after hearing that, but instead he blocks the singer's voice completely.
"Come on." Harry grabbed his hand and lead him towards the front of the tunnel.
"Very well then, follow me." Umbridge ordered.
"I have something for you..it's a good thing." Harry insisted.
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it!
Harry knew this was ridiculously stupid, but he needed to see Draco..and if that meant sneaking out of the hospital at 1 am, he'd do it. But he knew that'd be harder said than done..so instead he made up a lie that his parents were out in the lot wanting to see him. Harry was clever enough to tell this to a lady who seemingly just became a doctor, and she agreed but that he was to come back inside in an hour. Of course, he was probably gonna stay with Draco until later in the morning, depending on how there conversation went.
"Yeah, they're starting to move a lot..they'll no doubt see us hiding." Harry noticed.
"My momma used to call me that when I was little.." Dray flushed.
Draco preferred to stay out of life risking danger, however, Harry was right. If his robot were to be in danger, he'd have no choice but to take a stance. Harry's only been his robot for a short three months, but he really meant a lot to Draco..
"Right, sorry. Have a good rest of your day, then!" Draco waved.
"Perhaps." Draco shrugged.
"I've talked it over with Theo, and he's fine with it..unless you aren't willing to help. By all means I understand, we barely talk..but if you aren't against it, I was thinking we can fake a relationship..it'd make things easier for us." Draco explained.
"I love you, Harry." Draco replied just as slow.
Yes, Draco had attended them numerously in the past..not a big surprise considering his parents were the one's hosting.
Of course, Harry couldn't compare himself to someone that brilliant..but he still felt he could relate to the star.
"Oh, I think he is." Umbridge nodded.
"Why would I?" Ronald snorted.
"Sure, I won't tell anyone..I guess I'll help, plus, it means you can do my Chemistry homework." Harry jokes.
"The table looks perfectly placed to me." Hermione objected.
"Honestly, way to assume." Hermione shook her head.
"Thank you, Draco." Harry linked their arms with a smile.
"He'll read to me, watch me practicing quidditch, match with me in a game of a chess, he'll protect me as well." Draco listed.
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it!
"I respect you for making amends with Draco." Harry agreed.
"Don't, at least until lunch." Harry glared.
"Fascinating! Oh, and you are?" Hermione faced Ron.
"Where's Mister Potter??" McGonagall entered the library.
"Mister Potter, this isn't sex ed..I will be telling your father about this inappropriate state of mind you have..now keep quiet!" Umbridge yelled.
"Y-you left him?" Harry questioned.
"Yes." Draco nodded.
So when I have a shit day, I block the world and read them along.
Draco glanced at Harry, his hair turning messier than usual.
"Lotion we'll do." Hermione informed.
"Fine, I'll come! But only to talk with Luna." Draco agreed.
"Oh come on, is it about you two shagging?" Ron groaned.
"Uh, maybe Draco's not lying-" Daphne considered.
"Scorp is a bit shy, but he means well..I got him as a pet for my 9th birthday, and unfortunately he's staying at the manor while I'm at Hogwarts." Draco explains.
"I apologize, but your cauldron's overflowing." Hermione noticed.
"It may not sound cool to your relatives, but your house doesn't define you as a person. You have well-dressed robes, a snake, amazing quidditch abilities..you're really strong and smart..you're hair is very cool, and you have the prettiest shade of eyes I ever seen." Harry compliments.
"He's allowed to attend Hogwarts with you??" Daphne gaped slightly.
"Uh, sure." Harry complied, assuming Draco was rehearsing their first time meeting. Draco laughed in response, clearly happy with the delivery.
"I h-hate myself." Draco sighed, Harry could hear the guilt in his voice.
"I'm not cool anymore..I'm a Malfoy in Hufflepuff." Draco remembered.
"That wasn't my intention!" Draco protested.
"Having a B is a great score, Lavender can barely get that high of a marking..she could never be as smart as you, don't listen to her." Ginny comforted.
"Even though you're a robot, I think of you as my best friend." Draco admitted.
"Ok, um..Draco!" Harry changed.
"Harry isn't Nott, he wouldn't let that happen." Ginny insisted.
Draco gave Harry a quick nod before going up to take a seat, the hat placed on his head.
"Good, I was out of the UK for two weeks..I came back with this green lily!" Draco presented.
"Fine." Draco muttered.
"I won the bet then." Harry celebrated.
"Very well." McGonagall noted.
"Ronald! You already have a job!" Hermione scolded.
"Let the feast begin!!" Dumbledore announced.
"He really is!" His father followed after.
"Thank you, but that doesn't make me any better.." Hermione sighed.
Draco couldn't deny that Harry reading to him was nearly as calm as to when his mother did..Harry spoke gently and kind, never raising his voice or stuttering in between a line.
"No, Hermione w-was holding onto it." Harry huffed.
"N-no, I've a-always wanted to g-go to a concert.." Harry said.
”What did you use for lube?” Draco asked, his eyes following every motion.
Grabbing a pink throw from a plush armchair, Harry draped it over Draco.  Feeling a little tired himself, he crawled into the bed, spooning him gently from behind.  It had been a busy day, and neither of them had slept that well last night.  Harry found it didn’t take long until he drifted off himself.
Harry had been working on the house since the trials ended.  The areas he used most were liveable.  The rest of the spaces were jammed full of decades of dusty clutter, much tainted with dark magic.  He had learned the hard way to handle everything with care.
“Be still, or I’ll use a curse,” Draco ordered, his forearm pressed across Harry’s lower stomach.  Keeping him pinned to the bed.
Harry accepted it, but immediately set it down on a nearby table, and grabbed Draco’s hand.  “I have a surprise for you.”
"Nothing's happening, he's probably just distracted with other things." But Hermione didn't look convinced so Harry added an extra sentence he regretted as soon as he said it. "Why don't you ask him?"
"Really?" Harry nodded so Draco let out a heavy sigh before continuing. "Fine then, I like you Harry. I like the way that you always smile at the stupidest things.
"Are you even going to look up at me?" Draco assumed he was doing this because of the... well, the confession Harry had sprung on him a week ago.
"Malfoy shov-"
"So what did you expect then? Because it sure seemed like you didn't have a plan." Draco stepped closer towards Harry who did the opposite, going back towards the wall.
A pleasant silence settled between the two of them before Harry, of course, decided to speak again. "I've been thinking and... I don't think I like Ginny anymore."
"You don't understand, it should be, liking boys is wrong."
Snape's attentive eyes surveyed the class, glaring at the empty desk where Harry was meant to be before he redirected his glare to Hermione. "Miss Granger, where is–" Snape was in the middle of asking when a disgruntled Harry came running in, coming to a full stop next to Snape.
, Draco was repeating in his head.
Straight...?
Draco scrunched the note back into his pocket, sighing and looking at the boy beside him. This was the second time he had been there to see Harry sleeping and it seemed like this was becoming a pattern that Draco surprisingly didn't mind.
"Well." He went silent for a bit, thinking. "There's other sexualities too. I researched some and you could be b–"
, not moonstone, then you began listing the properties of something that's not even closely related to moonstone. Then the part you
"Upset that I resisted your charms and fell into the arms of a different boy?" Even as Draco said that, he couldn't imagine ever going to anybody except Harry, but he pushed that thought away, the uneasiness coming back at how he was planning to tell Harry his feelings.
Looked like he
"What? Why do you keep bringing up potions for Merlin's sake?"
"Who are you looking at?"
Draco walked out of the library, ignoring the confused look on Hermione's face.
"Harry?"
Draco noticed Harry's restlessness, glancing towards the Great Hall before looking back at Draco, fidgeting with his hands. "Merlin Potter, how much sugar have you had today?" Draco stalled.
Feelings are finally admitted.
from one specific blond haired boy. Harry was sure even the muggle world had heard that from the volume of Ron's voice.
Shit, Pansy was still here?
Draco didn't know whether Harry's sudden agitation was towards him but he couldn't give up now, regardless of Harry's mood. "Follow me."
"I'll be going then." Harry had seen enough of the pitying look Hermione was giving him, although he knew she was only doing it out of sympathy. "Tutoring with him." He explained before either of them could ask.
Typical mudbl- Granger, Draco thought to himself, scolding himself at the word he nearly called her.
had seen it. "Potter!"
"Yeah, around everyone except me." Harry said it so confidently, almost pushing his chest out with pride.
Draco walked outside, Harry following right behind him. "I don't understand what you want me to do."
As soon as he came in, the class went silent, Draco noticing that Harry still hadn't come yet, most likely still looking for his homework that lay comfortably on Draco's desk. Merlin, that boy was easy to distract, it was a surprise he had even gotten this far.
"Because I said so."
Both of them jumped apart; Draco going to the sinks whilst Harry tucked his wand into his pocket.
Harry could see the look Draco had and quickly cast the glamour charm on his neck, buttoning up his shirt to hide his skin from Draco's burning gaze. "You're looking like you want to give me more. That wasn't the point of me showing you, you should feel bad."
"Whatever." Draco muttered.
"I am, I swear, I've just got a lot on my mind." I kept the truth to myself, not yet prepared for Hermione to learn of my upcoming deal with Malfoy.
"–but maybe Jack's different to the rest of them."
It was pure torture for Draco who didn't know whether he wanted to run as far away from Harry as he could or figuratively attach Harry to his side so that he'd never leave him, but whichever option he chose, it all left him with the result that being friends with Harry was much harder then he'd like to admit.
He felt someone's stare on him and turned around to see Pansy glaring directly at him. He gulped, instantly turning his head back around and not looking at her again.
"No." Harry repeated firmer this time, but it had no effect on Draco who found it amusing, seeing as Harry wasn't explaining anything more.
Draco didn't say anything but Harry being the person he was understood. "We don't have to talk about it."
He didn't exactly expect, or want, anybody to be up there. Harry and him had moved their 'kissing tips' to when they had the tutoring, so there had been no reason for them to meet up at night.
Fine.
They really had gone from enemies to something more;
"She–" Harry went to answer until he realised what Draco’s question would mean. "Wait, you were still watching?"
"Uh huh." Malfoy nodded slowly. "You really think I'm that foolish to believe that's the truth?"
It was just that every time he looked up at Draco, the memories of last night (or morning) would rush down to his groin, leaving him in a very uncomfortable position.
– and pulled away. There was no way in hell that he would try and attempt to kiss her in any other place. (The lips had already been enough.) Pansy looked proud, a sly smirk on her face, but Draco felt horrible, underachieved– like he had been aiming for an Outstanding in an exam but had ended up with an Acceptable; it wasn't bad, but there had definitely been so many better ones.
"You're lying." Draco shrugged, not surprised at all. "I'll give it to you after I've talked."
, causing Harry to hear a popping noise. He let out a little grunt, not fully prepared for the invisible force that had hit his knee.
Harry's face was red, his uniform messy and his hair dishevelled... as if he had just come back from a quick shag in a classroom. Many others thought the same, whispers erupting around the classroom with a lot of snickers coming from the Slytherins, especially one, but before Harry could glower at him, Snape was already scolding him.
She was beautiful; everything a boy could want. I wasn't the only one with a crush though, I could see the way Dean would look at her, eyeing her whenever he thought nobody was watching. My fists clenched thinking of Ginny being with someone else. Never would I sit back and willingly watch that, but how was I to win Ginny over with the alert eyes of Ron?
"Yes, yes, you don't like boys, I've heard a thousand times yet here you are, holding my hand." Harry didn't know where all that confidence had come from but it felt good to get it out and surprisingly, Draco still didn't let go of Harry's hand.
"Yes, he had to talk to me about something." Draco sat on the couch, moving away from her, but she simply perched right next to him.
"Why is Malfoy looking at you?" Hermione asked out of the blue, snapping Harry out of his daydream that he had been having. He glanced over to the Slytherin table, meeting Draco's eyes for a second before Draco quickly averted his eyes back to the table.
Harry looked over to the Slytherin table. Pansy and Draco were sitting next to each other but they both appeared tense, an obvious tension between the two of them. Draco looked up, making eye contact with Harry who immediately averted his eyes back to the table. "Er well–" Harry had planned to lie, say no, maybe tell Ron one day in the future on a drunken night, but there was no point of hiding anymore, so he just came out with the truth. "Malfoy." He whispered, not knowing if Ron had heard until Ron spit out the food in his mouth.
"Yes, like you."
Harry didn't want to start shouting but Draco just didn't know when to stop, "Yes, sorry about that, but you're just as at fault as I am here. You deliberately stole my homework, embarrassing me in front of the whole class–"
"Why would that have anything to do with me?"
"Yeah, yeah you're right." Harry gave up on his role as a questioner and moved to sit back next to Draco again, this time keeping his hands on his lap in a deliberate move that Draco noticed.
because you're Harry Potter?"
Apart from that, enjoy this chapter :)
"Uh–"
if they didn't hurry up. Harry quickly grabbed the ingredients and grudgingly walked back to Draco, unaware that Draco had been observing him that whole time.
He, however, tried to keep his face as void of emotion as he could. "And how can you tell by my face?"
"–Ginny, Ron..." But then Harry carried on, and Draco realised he really wasn't that significant in Harry's messy thoughts. "About Potions, muggles..."
Hermione didn't answer straight away, sensing that Harry was uncomfortable.
Draco's thoughts were cut short when he felt Harry's thumb rubbing circles on his palm. He wasn't sure if Harry was doing it deliberately, but the touch made him shiver–it felt so good– causing him to lean into Harry more until he pulled his hand away and stood up. "I'm sorry, I don't even know wh–" Harry was in the middle of apologising when Draco, who had also stood up, came in front of him.
Harry was on edge for the rest of the day, thinking of what Draco wanted to say, and when the time came, he found Draco already there as usual.(How long had he been here?)
He would've been able to really think about how Malfoy had called him Harry; did he want Harry then?
Exhibition B for Harry's unnecessary closeness:
So blinded by her excitement, Hermione didn't pick up on my lie at all, instead smiling brightly, colourful words flying out of her mouth that I didn't exactly feel the need to listen to.
Not the friendship like, but the relationship kind.
Draco's mouth slightly gaped seeing the fresh bruises on Harry's face and a (slightly) insensitive joke as some may say, slipped out. "Did you trip over every stair getting here?"
Harry noticed Draco sitting at one of the tables– of course he was here too, Harry groaned internally– and turned the other way, just so he wouldn't have to make any awkward eye contact with him but Hermione glanced behind him, seeing Draco there and instantly started with her questions. "What's going on with you and Malfoy now? It's like one day the two of you are all over each other then the next, you're both running away."
Blurting out the first- actually, second, name that came to mind.
Draco shook his head, "Yeah, yeah of course."
bed, but he didn't seem to care as much with Harry, and simply sat down, leaning against the chair opposite his bed.
Unlike with Hermione, he didn't feel the need to pull away, instead, his focus was fixed on Draco's lips as he licked his own in anticipation. Draco noted Harry's eagerness and internalised a smirk as the gap between their lips closed for the second time that day.
Harry made to turn around -look in a different place- when he saw the shimmering of gold near the Gryffindor's goalposts and immediately positioned his broom down, leaning forward and tearing after it. Draco quickly caught on, also aligning himself in a way that he could go quicker.
"No, it's not your fault, you don't need to apologise. We don't have to stop being friends, but maybe just for a week, we take a break you know? Gives you space to think and gives me time to try and get over you I guess."
Draco expected Harry's response, not even batting an eyelid at Harry's smouldering glare. "I don't know if you've noticed yet, but Snape is currently staring daggers into your soul right now–" Harry turned his head and realised Draco was right. "–so unless you want Gryffindor to go down to minus points, I suggest you get those ingredients like I said." Draco gave Harry a superficial smile, irking Harry even more who forced himself to not storm over to where the ingredients were.
"You're standing so far from me, like I'm gonna attack you or something."
"Debatable from the person who brewed a love potion instead of a peace one."
"Cheers."
He couldn't see Harry's face, his back facing Draco, but he could see Jack who kept glancing at him, practically rubbing it in his face that he was with Harry.
Draco looked to be in a foul mood, and Harry didn't really understand why... well, he knew it could be something to do with him ignoring Draco, but that couldn't be the only reason.
"I don't know what you want me to say. Wow! Well done Draco, you're as straight as a circle, congratulations! No matter what I say, you'll deny it every time, so I hope hiding your sexuality makes you bloody happy." Harry didn't even realise he'd been shouting until he finished speaking and saw Draco's face covered with shock, but also a hint of sadness. Harry automatically felt bad; just because it had been easy for him to come out to his friends, it didn't mean that Draco's situation would also be the same. "Fuck. I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to–"
letting Harry sleep in his bed, Draco didn't expect such treatment in return.
when number one, you and I-" Draco pointed between the two of them. " - are basically enemies and number two, I am a boy if you have not noticed, unless the Chosen one is a fairy."
"If you both ran into each other as you said, I'll check the two of you." She sternly spoke, Draco going quiet and nodding meekly.
Snape gave him a blank stare and didn't say anything, the silence being his answer. Draco allowed Snape get to work whilst simultaneously trying to stay away from Harry who was chasing him around the classroom.
"Parkinson."
Just perfect.
Ron nodded in agreement. "You were awesome, mate. You should've seen the way Malfoy was glaring at you." He paused, thinking back to the game before shaking his head. "Actually, scrap that, he looked like he was in love with your broom or something." He shuddered.
Nevertheless, here he was, agreeing to stay friends with him, knowing that 'that boy' liked him in a certain way that his father would never approve.
Draco missed Harry's whole explanation but he didn't feel the need to ask Harry to repeat it again, he'd already heard the important part. "Oh."
"Why?"
Draco and Harry immediately separated from each other like their bodies had been on fire, needing to get away from each other as quick as they could. Draco rapidly flung on his shirt whilst Harry adjusted his glasses, (and his trousers), wild thoughts running through both of their minds.
"Harry, are you that worried for the match?" Hermione finally asked, shocking Harry who had completely forgotten she was there, flinching a bit.
Before Harry could even stop himself, all the words he had kept locked in his head began to tumble out in a disarray, "I should've just asked someone else. I didn't think you were going to be this difficult though who was I kidding? It's obvious you'd never want to help me, I don't know why I didn't remember that you'd rather humiliate me then be seen-"
"Harry James Potter, are you even listening to me?" Hermione scolded as we walked to the Great Hall for breakfast.
"Oh, I was just snogging that one enemy of mine, and partly yours, you know him, Harry Potter? Yeah, he's the one... oh, and I am currently hard, also due to him."
"It's only been three days." Harry stated dumbly.
"You know you love it." Draco heard the flirtatious tone in the smirk he knew Harry would have but he still obeyed, turning onto his side and not replying back.
Draco turned around, so not in the mood for her riddles. "My boyfriend?"
"No, definitely not... So what would you say?" Harry felt like a little kid, his heart beating at an alarming rate as he waited for Draco's answer.
Harry needed space from Draco, he was taking Hermione's advice, and anyways, every time he would even glance towards Draco, all he could see was the way Draco had been so cold to him the day before.
The silence was deafening as Draco assessed the situation, checking Harry out in an obvious manner, weighing the options against each other. Harry started to slightly rock back on his feet and felt the regrets wash over him when Draco still remained silent. If he was going to say no, he could just say it straight away so Harry could move on, find another person, and maybe bathe in his embarrassment for a day or two before blocking it out of his memories.
"–There's barely even a scratch, it's a tiny mark on your arm."
Hermione was shocked, but then she wasn't, but then she was, and now she didn't know how to feel. "Malfoy?" She repeated, watching as Harry nodded his head.
"I have a feeling this is a personal question." Draco smirked.
In 3...
"If I give it back to you, do you promise to listen to what I have to say?"
Draco couldn't sleep.
"Wha- What's that?" Draco pointed to something behind Harry's head. Harry quickly turned his head, and whilst he did, Draco's hand slid into Harry's robe pockets and smoothly grabbed Harry's wand out of it and hid it in his own pocket.
Hermione's expression fell again, knowing how stubborn Draco was being. "Are you scared of the hate? Is it because of your–"
Bad Draco.
"–and due to Potter's ineptitude, or rather indolence, in my Potion's class, it has come to my attention by the Headmaster that he requires a tutor, which is where you, Mr Malfoy, are needed."
"I went to the toilet." Draco simply answered, ignoring the look she gave him.
"I already asked once. What do I get in return?"
"Just bloody get on with it." Harry finally spoke after Draco had kept quiet for an unnerving amount of seconds, surveying Harry's emotionless face.
Harry sighed, gently massaging his temples, "This friendship, the kissing whenever you feel like it, then denying it means anything to you." He let out. "I'd love to stay your friend Draco, I really would, but it's just... every minute I spend with you," Harry paused, glancing down at the floor. "–I get more attached to you." He whispered.
"I'll take him, I'm already headed that way." Draco, with no warning, proclaimed, a look of confusion on both Harry and Ginny's face.
Harry was shocked, slightly stepping back. "Wha-? Draco, are you okay?"
Draco acted oblivious; Potter couldn't have been that stupid to talk about what had happened the day before to his friends. "What's going on with me?"
But when he started to grin at Harry's feeble attempts to protest the reduction of points, Draco knew Harry had been completely right in his saying:
"Ouch."
"I didn't mean– Whatever." Harry grumbled, before realising the position he was in, and shooting up off of Draco, sitting beside him. "Why was my head on your lap?"
"You called me Draco. Not Malfoy."
Harry wasn't used to a happy Draco and turned around, finding his invisibility cloak, "Someone's happy."
"Er why?"
"But I am evil. If I get the–" Draco suddenly stopped, almost like he was going to reveal a big secret.
Harry started to show that cheeky smile of his, glancing back up at Draco, stirring some kind of worry in Draco. "You scared that I'll stop giving you my utmost attention? Or that I'll stop loving someone like you?" Harry joked, but then Draco's face went completely blank, his mouth slightly ajar. "What? I was just kidding."
Draco felt wrong for two reasons.
"No, Merlin you're so frustrating." Harry's fists clenched by his side, trying to keep the anger inside. "You never understand anything."
Draco shook his head; not yet anyways.
"Oh shut up, a few weeks ago you said that Ravenclaws were know-it-alls with their noses stuck up their own asses–" Fair point from Harry, Draco thought, he had said that.
Draco Malfoy hugging Harry Potter.
Hermione pulled his arms down so his blushing face was back on display. "Have you talked to her yet?"
Since Potions, Harry hadn't been able to find his wand...Well, he had actually forgotten about it, having frees that didn't require his wand, and it hadn't been till Hermione had asked him to accio a quill for her that he had realised it'd gone.  "No, I don't know where I've dropped it."
"I believe he's accidentally brewed a love potion, though I'm not sure how he didn't realise, or how he was able to get affected by it. Amortentia is a difficult—"
Harry's eyes stayed on Ron, scanning for a reaction but Ron didn't even seem to flinch. "Oh really? That's cool."
It decided to faint.
The seat next to Hermione was empty, where Harry usually sat, but it wasn't surprising to not see him there. Hermione, mistaking Draco for looking at her, glared at him before opening her book. Draco rolled his eyes at the try hard but went and sat down next to Blaise, waiting for Professor Snape to come.
"You're so boring."
"I couldn't exactly say no to Snape."
"Yeah." But he does, Draco thought despondently, staring down at the ground.
So he didn't, and instead tried to enjoy the feeling of Draco's hand in his and ignore the overwhelming questions that kept doubling in his brain. But the questions kept building up: If Draco didn't like him back, why was he holding his hand? Why did he ask to meet him? Why did Draco carry on staying close to him? Why was Harry allowing this to happen? "Draco–Ow, you scratched me!" Harry exclaimed as Draco squeezed his hand tightly.
"Just saw your boyfriend." Pansy came up from behind Draco, wiping away his theories on why Harry had seemed so distant.
Draco was completely puzzled.
"Mr Malfoy and Potter." His words would sound like a greeting if it weren't for the impending doom that Harry knew was coming. Snape barely cast a glance towards the cauldron before continuing. "You've added too much of lovage."
"Like me?" Harry sat up straight, pushing his shoulders back.
"Malfoy."
"Shoes." Draco responded like a parent, nodding in approval when Harry kicked them off to the side.
"Yes." Draco found no energy to quip back a sarcastic response and didn't make any effort to move out of Harry's lap, instead angling his neck into a more comfortable position. "What were you singing?"
"It's fine." Harry repeated, remembering what he had just been thinking about. How did he expect to tell his friends about something as big as this when he couldn't even talk about what had happened in class today? "I heard there's bacon sandwiches at dinner." Harry knew this to be a total lie but Ron didn't pick up on it, uttering a small goodbye and that he'd be back before running out, leaving Harry in silence again.
Harry could hear Draco's smirk, but still turned around to face him. "You scared me." Were the only words Harry could find to say.
Bloody hell, Granger, if only she knew how not innocent that sounded, Draco thought to himself. He supressed the laugh that threatened to come out and nodded. "There's nothing going on between Potter and I."
Draco
." Draco let the Potter run off his tongue smoothly, clearly enunciating every syllable in an over exaggerated way. Harry felt a weird tingle run up his spine but brushed it away.
Harry stared at Draco blankly, racking his brains of how Draco could've known how to do those spells. There were a few theories Harry ha–
." Harry felt Draco kiss the same spot softly and almost melted there and then. "Not too noticeable." He stammered out, but by then, it didn't matter, since Draco's lips were back on his, and he was sure he felt a smirk on Draco's lips, knowing that he had definitely left a mark.
All my thoughts centred back to the kiss; as expected, I hadn't suddenly been an expert, but it was better than the first one, I actually being able to enjoy the feeling of Malfoy's lips moving against mine.
Harry shrugged, grinning as Draco put his arm around Harry's waist to support him whilst Harry put his hand on Draco's shoulder. Harry could hear Draco's breathing quicken, reminding Harry of how much this close proximity was like last night. He just hoped he didn't smell too bad after the match.
Harry responded immediately, as if he'd expected for Draco to carry on the conversation. "You–"
"I know you're looking for Harry." Hermione's voice scared him as he turned to the side, looking at her slightly disappointed expression.
"Who? Dudley?" Draco felt like cringing saying his name; he would've hated his parents if they had called him that.
Finally Draco looked disgusted, shaking his head, "Merlin no, that's incest. Is that what you're suggesting, just because I said I liked boys-?"
Harry's mouth opened slightly before shutting it again as he glanced down at the ground, nodding. "Yeah, practise."
Harry turned back around, having seen nothing, and raised a brow at Draco's suspicious stance.
Harry rolled his eyes, shaking his head as if Draco had been genuinely asking him that question. "I'm fine, let's just do what we need to do here." The quicker Draco helped him with Potions, the shorter he would have to spend basking in this awkwardness.
"So that's a yes."
"Yep." Harry agreed, opening up his ingredients book to see how, or when, he had managed to add too much lovage.
Harry lay back on the bed, sighing. "Oh."
"Watch where you're—"
He didn't know what to do. Where was Snape when he was actually needed?
"And hello to you too, Parkinson." Harry mustered up the fakest smile he could, seeing the way she visibly cringed.
He felt faint because he couldn't shake the fact that he had
Harry nodded slowly, looking back up into Hermione's eyes.
Draco sensed Harry's inquisitive stare and looked away. "What do you want then?"
"Sorry."
The way to describe how Draco reacted would be engrained in his memories forever. Blood rushed through his pale cheeks as his mouth slightly hung open a bit, his eyes widening. He was rendered speechless, attempting to grasp any words in the English vocabulary he could but none came.
"So you like me?"
"My fault?"
He froze, hearing Harry's breaths getting heavier on his neck, but now he was stuck in a position where his hip was digging into the bed, so he adjusted one more time- only once (or twice)- and regretted it when he heard a groan come from the person behind him, saying "Draco," in a kind of warning tone on the edge of arousal and cautioning. Harry pulled him closer than Draco thought was even possible, letting Draco feel his erection even more, showing the lack of shame Harry had. "If you keep moving, I won't last the night."
Harry's smile turned goofy as he waited for a congratulations from Draco but nothing came. "Aren't you gonna praise my amazing potion skills?"
Draco still shook his head. "I'm not."
"Am I being interrogated?" Harry joked to avoid the question. Ron snorted but Hermione frowned, staying silent.
"Draco." Harry practically pouted, his eyes glaring at Draco.
Harry headed up to the astronomy tower, the confidence that he had before slowly leaving with each step he took. He had just started to agree with Hermione's theory that waiting for the right person was the road to follow when he realised he was already where he needed to be.
"I don't know, probably." Harry still didn't understand how Draco's parents and him kissing Pansy were related.
"No–Well, yes, that too... but he's the one so hell-bent against me liking someone like you."
But then he changed the topic; and the smile vanished off of his face. "You know Jack thinks you're fit."
Hermione didn't believe his words for a second, he needed a right push."You will when?"
As if he sensed my stare, his head turned towards me, ice grey eyes meeting mine, his smile leaving straight away. A frown formed before quickly turning into a smirk... then he winked.
Why should he, Draco Malfoy, be jealous of some ginger that was sitting with Harry? It's not like Harry and him were even close friends, though he was sure friends didn't get jealous over friends making new ones.
"That never happened." Harry quickly snapped back, cringing at Draco's impression of his voice.
"Away."
After a while of sitting and waiting, Draco decided to break the silence; a decision that he regretted as soon as he spoke. "I don't like Pansy."
Draco glanced up at him, his stare emotionless, piercing into Harry's face. "It doesn't matter."
Draco sped up his walking pace, causing Harry to fall behind with his knee that was killing him. "Malfoy slow down, you're walking too fast." Harry grumbled.
"Can we... can we try again?" Harry plucked up the courage, hearing 'bloody Gryffindors... always brave' but ignored it, assuming Draco hadn't wanted him to hear it.
"Say something... please." Harry pleaded quietly. He hadn't wanted the urgency to come out in his voice yet it had.
Something he had wanted to do for a while... and now he finally had a 'decent' enough excuse.
"But-"
"Stop replying with one word."
"How about this then: Would you see yourself having sex with a boy?"
And how could Harry forget about it when it was all he could think about whenever Draco was near?
Lies.
He didn't turn around to see how Harry looked, he couldn't, because he knew if he did, he wouldn't have the willpower to not run up to him and spill everything that was happening in his brain, but by the time Draco finally turned, Harry had already run off, all left being an empty area.
"No way." Draco declined instantly.
Pansy recovered quickly, acting like she hadn't just been hurt by his words. "Potter... and you agreed to tutor him?" She eyed him as if he had a whole say on the matter.
Draco had to cover up the smile that fought to appear on his face, settling for an arch of his brow.
Draco turned around, counting on the belief that Harry would follow, and headed outside, searching around for somewhere that nobody was and finally finding a secluded area around some trees. Draco stood opposite of Harry who leaned against a tree, scanning Draco's face. "Is this about last night? Because I'm sorry if I went too fa–"
"What do you think then Harry?" Ron turned to him.
He always seemed to let his guard down around Draco and it always seemed to backfire on him. Harry glanced towards where Draco was and caught the smirk on his face before Draco looked away.
Harry's anger had been stored up, but was now ready for release, so when he got to the top of the astronomy tower, he wasn't ready to even wait a second before letting it all out.
"It's your father, isn't it?" Harry guessed, knowing he'd hit the mark when Draco's head whipped to the side at the mention of him. "I should've known."
It wasn't working.
It was like Draco was trying to be civil, which didn't make sense to Harry at all. Why was he so formal to Harry yesterday then? He had shut down Harry immediately.
"No, that's weird."
"Can I copy your charms work?"
After the... well, the kiss, Harry had rambled on about some astrology facts to avoid the silence being awkward, then had announced he was feeling tired and instead of doing the logical thing that any sane person would do by going back to their dorm, he had decided to make Draco's lap his temporary bed.
With no reply, Draco smirked. "That's what I thought."
." Harry teased.
, "This would barely scrape a Poor, let alone an Acceptable."
Harry didn't say anything, instead held out his hand.
Draco took the hint and stayed quiet for the rest of the lesson, only sneaking quick peeks at Harry when he was sure he wasn't looking, though that didn't last long as Harry placed his hand on the side of his face, blocking Draco's view.
That finally got Harry to stop, remembering how he loved the way his name sounded in Draco's mouth.
"If it isn't the star seeker,
Harry shrugged. He knew that, but he would try and ignore him for as long as he could. "I still have to help you with Potions." Draco reminded him.
He wanted to end this thing before it got too far, his father's warning still ringing in his head, but he just couldn't bear to break it to Harry who always seemed pleased at any words Draco would say to him.
"You really are moody today Harry. How am I smiling like?"
Draco snorted, sounding pretentious in even his own ears. "Oh please Pansy, that kiss was one of the worst I've ever had; I'd rather kiss a hufflepuff then ever be forced to put my lips on yours again." And with that, Draco walked off on the opposite path that Harry had been on, hearing a 'but' from Pansy that he ignored. He
It wasn't the fear of rejection, no surprise there since Harry liked him too. What was there to reject? It was the opinion's of everyone else, which he knew he shouldn't dwell on, it was 'his life' as Harry would love to say... but it wasn't.
Harry didn't truly expect Draco to say anything, it's not like they were suddenly friends, but Draco had been bottling things up for so long, and so well, that none of his Slytherin friends had even noticed, or bothered to ask, yet here was Harry, someone who he could call a nemesis, asking how he was. Maybe that's why he decided to confide in him; what further harm could be done? It's not like Harry hadn't just seen his tears.
Harry's face dropped, muttering something to himself. "Oh... I guess I can do it tonight."
"Later."
Truly too deep.
"No? I definitely did
He wouldn't have been caught... if it weren't for Granger noticing when even Potter hadn't.
"How lovely." Draco tried to play off his shock with a bored stare, but Hermione had already seen it.
Harry rolled his eyes, grumbling a small, "I hate you," that didn't sound convincing to anyone with a pair of eyes to see or a pair of ears to hear.
Dumb.
He was just kind.
thoughts of last night had been stored away in a box that would never be opened again-
The feeling of relief washed over Harry's body, holding the snitch in his hands. It was like a huge weight had been swept off of his shoulders and when he turned to look at the blond boy, it seemed as if he was suddenly fixated at the sight of his broom.
"Yeah, I'm fine, I just-" Malfoy's face flashed into my mind; more specifically, his lips. Merlin, I needed to walk this off. "I need to get my Potions homework." I lied, knowing fully well I had stuffed it into my robe's pocket this morning. Nevertheless, nobody else knew, so I stood up, dismissing Hermione's reprimands of me being unorganised, and walked out.
"Yeah." Draco suddenly felt embarrassed under Harry's stare but Harry sensed this, looking away.
"It's nothing. I'm completely fine." Draco so-obviously-lied, Harry nearly snorting at how bad it was.
"Isn't that great?" It was like Harry was seeking for approval from Draco that he'd never get.
her books when she wasn't there.
"Yes, ouch, it physically pained me to read this. Now imagine if Snape would've had to read this, I'm sure he would've been delighted." Draco sarcastically remarked.
"But that wouldn't be as much fun,
Merlin, Harry knew it wasn't his best piece of work, at all, but Draco was being just a tad bit dramatic. Harry snatched the parchment from Draco, reading the first lines and being instantly taken back to when he wrote this the week before... on a week day... at midnight... after having just done Quidditch.
Ron didn't catch Harry's cue for him to stop talking about what had happened and carried on, "Malfoy's a little git. We'll get him back."
peg you for a... romance fanatic."
"Of course." Ginny smiled. "I'd love that."
Harry was rendered silent for a second, wondering where all of that had come from.
"I knew you could do it!" Hermione exclaimed, at first going in to give him a hug before scrunching her nose up, deciding against it and giving him a slightly-awkward high five.
Harry would've laughed if what Ron was saying didn't make sense in a weird way. He assessed Ron's looks; he had some nice freckles splattered against his face with his bright, impressionable blue eyes, but they just weren't Draco's angelic ones... and their personalities were different, much different. "I've only ever seen you as a friend."
"No you're not. What's going on?" Hermione stared at a panicked Harry, also feeling the confusion at what was going on.
Many names popped out in the darkness but one stuck out the most and almost straight away, he got up. "Oh Merlin Hermione, you're a life saver." He gave her a quick hug, catching her so off guard that she was unable to do anything but let her arms hang to the side and as soon as the hug began, it was already over. "Sorry about before." Was the last thing Harry said to her before he disappeared under the invincibility cloak.
i apologise in advance for these quite short chapters but hope you enjoy reading them anyways :)
"I'm fine." Merlin, he needed to update his vocabulary bank. Draco could see Harry studying the room, staring at Draco's bed that was neat, almost like nobody ever actually used it. "I didn't mean to stand you up."
Harry nodded, resisting the urge to roll his eyes and rested the side of his head on his hand, half listening to what Snape was saying about a potion they were going to make. All he got from Snape's explanation was that it had something to do with peace; a state of mind that Harry was not in right now.
got to enjoy the experience of Harry's lips. Without even hesitating, he wrapped his arms around Harry's neck and joined their lips to each other's again. Harry's hands slid up Draco's untucked shirt as Draco ran his hands messily through Harry's hair. It was like mini explosions were being set off in every place Harry touched and Harry's lips on his were the sweetest he'd ever kissed.
They both shared a look, but Hermione still summarised what they had said which now made sense of why they had looked confused when he had said yes. "Oh yeah, that wouldn't be right." He agreed with them, feeling satisfied when they both nodded, moving on to another topic that Harry still wasn't paying full attention to, but enough that if they asked him a question, he'd be able to actually answer.
Draco tried to amble as casually as he could up to the two of them, feeling his confident falter when they carried on with their conversation, paying no regards to him. "We need to talk."
"You're frowning." Harry voiced.
The younger girls at first paid no attention to the red faced boys and their heavy breathing, or the brightness shining off of them, until Harry-with no warning- burst out into a fit of laughter, his shoulders shaking with him. The girls stopped, staring at him confusedly, before they hurried away as quick as their little legs could take them, whispering harshly to each other. Draco, who couldn't just be like the girls and run away, had no idea of what was so funny, or wrong, gawking at Harry who kept glancing towards Draco as if he was ready to start explaining before no words would come out, only the sounds of his wheezing from the lack of oxygen he was breathing in.
and I never did anything like that, and I told you about Ginny, you never said a word about Parkinson."
"He's the one who agreed to stay friends." He sounded pathetic and they could both hear that.
That was the last straw for Draco who had heard enough. "Potter, do you ever get tired of listening to your own voice?"
A few days later, Harry hadn't seen much of Draco for a while; apparently he had gone back to the Malfoy Manor for a few days, but now he had come back, and Harry had just spotted him turning the corner and immediately sped after him.
"Shut up, just sleep." Harry slurred, still in his dream state.
"Amortentia. The boy has gone and messed up the simple draught of peace potion." Snape stood between Draco and Harry. Draco wanted to mention that the potion wasn't as simple as he had said, but it would make it seem like he was sticking up for Harry; which he definitely wasn't. "I'll have to brew the antidote."
It went quiet, neither of them saying anything, until Harry chose to break the silence (and tension). "So, who's a better kisser? Me or Parkinson?" He joked; not a very good one, he thought right after.
Draco paused, rolling his eyes. "Fine then, I can give you a high five."
"No, no it's not." Draco interrupted, already starting to feel that same warmth rise on his neck.
"Potter,"
He did?
He wasn't a cheater... and I wasn't a relationship breaker.
With that, Hermione nodded her head, determination flashing in her eyes as she watched Draco walk out of the hall. "I will. Something's up with Malfoy."
Harry looked back at Draco again to see him still frowning. "It's probably nothing. Malfoy being typical Malfoy I guess." Harry still glanced at Draco again though, seeing Draco signal to him to meet him outside, pointing to the doors before getting up and walking out.
"Why are you here?"
Harry moved his stare to his hands that rested on the table, shrugging in a way to show that he didn't care, when it was obvious he really did. " If suppressing my crush for you is all I have to do for us to be friends, then so be it."
"–And I want us to still be friends."
But unfortunately, there was a reason why she had called him disobedient, watching him walk over.
Harry sighed and sat down again. "Because my kissing skills are terrible. Absolutely abominable." Hermione opened her mouth again, ready to protest but Harry read her mind and began to speak again. "I've been told by many."
"Nothing really." Draco replied truthfully which only confused Harry more.
"No." Harry redirected his glare to the ground, keeping his answer short.
"I don't care what you believe."
Harry didn't reply but slowly, very slowly, lifted his head up.
She really was gorgeous.
"Don't we all?" Draco stated the joke with such seriousness that it took Harry seconds, feeling like minutes, before his face broke out into a smile, a heavy laugh pouring out.
Harry's thoughts began to run everywhere: How long had he been staring? He hoped that Draco hadn't watched him eat. What if his eating was really ugly? How did he look eating?
"Promise me you won't get mad." Harry looked into Hermione's eyes that held sympathy and pity.
"I lied." Draco admitted. Harry rolled his eyes and shook his head, then simply went back to reading.
"I'm not." Harry sulked.
Though Harry had near-literally bashed their lips together, the kiss softened instantly as Harry gently placed his hand on Draco's cheek. Draco would never be able to forget the feeling of Harry's lips on his; it honestly felt like he was on top of the world.
"But he could've.... and... maybe–" But then Ron's voice was no longer audible to Draco and he could no longer understand what Ron was saying, and by the time he had stepped a bit closer to them, Ron was heading the other way, saying he'd be back later.
He didn't trust himself.
"Drac– Malfoy." He shifted his gaze to the ground, not sure if he wanted to see Hermione's reaction.
"But I am scared. You only see the surface level of my father, you don't understand how much authority he has over me."
Draco was already looking at Harry, and upon seeing Harry looking back, he bit his lip, a suggestive look in the smirk he gave Harry.
talking. Harry had to force himself to not mention what had happened, but any time he managed to slip it into the conversation, Draco would shut off, shaking his head or telling Harry to forget about it; making up an excuse that Harry had heard Draco's words differently from the 'side effects' of the healing spell which they both knew to be false.
"I– Well, I normally do much better, I swear."
The real reason was that he was nervous.
Draco pulled out the note from his pocket again, thinking about how his father would react to know that a boy, not just any boy, but Harry Potter, was sleeping in his bed.
"No, now."
It was no surprise that she had followed, he should've known. He turned around and gritted his teeth. "Granger."
"Shut up Potter." Draco tried to peek to see if Snape was watching them but Harry turned Draco's face back to his, his pupils dilated. Harry leaned in, focussed on Draco's lips but Draco tried his best to pull away, backing into a desk; he was not going to kiss an infatuated Harry, especially with Snape standing less than 5 feet away from them. "Please, just one, I promise." Harry pleaded.
Draco stood back, running a shaky hand through his hair before he shook his head. "No idea, Harry, I've got no idea."
"So what's wrong about that? Liking boys isn't something you can control." An almost predictable response from Harry that would've made Draco snort if it weren't for the sexuality crisis he was going through.
They had somehow found a way to roll over onto the grass with Draco on top and Harry underneath him. The same warmth that came every time they kissed ignited in Draco's chest and he knew that it was a feeling he'd never, and didn't want to, ever get used to. Draco should've been more worried about who could've walked past and seen them, yet he was more concentrated on the hands gently tugging his hair, he should've been more worried about how, or if, their relationship could even grow, yet he was more focussed on the soft, pillowy lips moving against his.
other girls. His hand went to her waist and his body was against hers... but it wasn't the same feeling as that one boy's torso against his.
Draco scoffed, shaking his head and staring into those once defiant green eyes, seeming more hesitant. "So you expected me to bow down and do what you ask
Harry was more prepared for Hermione's questions this time and tried his best to do a relaxed shrug. "Nobody, just thought I saw something weird."
It took Harry so long to say something back that he almost thought Harry would ignore him. "Talking got me into trouble in the first place."
Well, mostly empty.
It took a while, but Draco did eventually calm down, his laugh coming to a stop. "What is going on in that head of yours?" Draco untangled their hands from each other, hearing a small complaint from Harry, and hit Harry lightly on the back of his head. "Why'd you think I brought up my father?"
" which froze Harry to his spot.
Draco thought of the boy who would be sitting there-waiting, but he didn't have the courage to go all the way up there today. In some way, he felt like by leaving his room, he was disobeying his father and he knew his father would rather be in Azkaban then learn of the growing emotions Draco had started to feel for Harry.
Even Harry could sense that wasn't the main reason why Draco had asked him to come. "Is that it?"
Draco let out a bitter chuckle, shaking his head. "Ironic huh? I'm the most selfish person I know, I don't think I need to 'take care of myself first'. "
"I'm not." Draco's voice had gone up a notch and that only made Harry's smile shine brighter.
Draco would normally hate the idea of anyone on
"Praise? As in..." Draco trailed off, looking at Harry to carry on.
"The worst thing is that I still bloody like him, even after he's done that." Harry stood up off of the bench they were sitting on and started to pace in front of Hermione, reminding her of the times before Qudditch games against Slytherin. Was that because of Draco too? Hermione wondered. "What do I do, Mione? Do I ignore him, talk to him, shout at him? I really just wish I hadn't been such a sap over him."
Draco actually seemed apologetic, shaking his head as he looked away. "Sorry." He mumbled, so quietly that Harry wasn't sure if he had heard correctly. He wanted to ask Draco to repeat what he'd said but then the moment would be ruined, and Draco would 100% not say it again.
"You came." Draco leaned against the wall, looking as good as usual.
"Yeah, I guess I am." Draco muttered, presumably not for Harry to hear, but he did.
Harry was about to answer when Snape looked their way with an expectant look on his face, making Hermione go to her partner, and Harry, unfortunately, to his own partner too.
Harry leaned up on his elbows, peering at him in suspicion. "Malfoy, are you...
"I didn't have a choice." Draco repeated for the second time that day.
Hermione stayed silent for a bit, taking in the helpless look Harry had, "And you wanted me to prove this or...?"
"But too bad it isn't reality." Yet Draco always found a way to dampen the mood.
"Sure." Draco finally stopped laughing as he looked at Harry knowingly, standing up and walking alongside of him. Yet that didn't mean he didn't carry on teasing Harry about the books he liked to read whilst Harry could only press his lips together in shame at Draco actually correctly naming books that Harry had read.
Draco stood up–too quickly for his liking– and stumbled a couple of steps backwards, stars clouding his vision as his legs acted before his mind, running out of the classroom, the background noises all mashing into one. He didn't know where he was going, but the last thing he remembered was leaning against the wall before falling into a pair of arms and his eyes closing on him.
"Nobod- Nothing. Shit." Harry cursed, realising he'd just exposed himself. If only Draco could be unobservant and simply move on, but no, Draco immediately noted what Harry was saying.
Draco deliberately kept his stare on the table, not meeting Harry's eyes. "You asked me if I liked Pansy yesterday, and the answer is no."
"Like a date?" Draco interrupted, having perked up at the sound of another potential love interest of Harry's. "Have you told everyone your sexuality?"
"Yeah, what life would be like if I was one."
"Not in that way, I meant that you should– could, could if you want." Draco didn't know why he was still going, his brain and mouth were both saying very different things: one telling him to shut up and the other urging him to keep insisting.
Draco Malfoy winked at me.
"Nothing, Potter, it- I mean, I meant nothing." Draco had crawled back into his cold shell, making Harry regret that he didn't savour happy Draco for long enough.
Harry's stoic face finally broke away as he chuckled at Draco's excitement. "Stop laughing." Draco ordered, but he didn't mean it; Harry's laugh was refreshing.
Draco hesitated on his words, unwilling to say something too rude. "How long would that take then?"
So I lied.
Merlin, he would definitely need a cold shower now.
Harry wanted to roll his eyes at Draco's timing for his humour but didn't, "I'm sure." He breathed out instead, before eagerly connecting their lips again for another kiss.
"Hello, little miss perfect." Though Draco had improved on stopping his name calling, he couldn't resist doing a bit of mockery; Hermione's reactions were almost as good as Harry's.
"Oh." Draco replied coolly, but on the inside he was insanely glad that only
"Really? But I-"
.) This was an official coming out, so he was a bit nervous to say the words out loud. Hermione could sense Harry's hesitance and gave him an encouraging nod, telling him to go on. He took a deep breath then let the words flow out. "I'm bisexual."
hadn't turned to face Harry, his voice seeming much sadder in his last sentence. "Are you okay?" Harry realised the irony of his question. After coming here and basically going off at him, he had taken a full 180, acting like he wanted to comfort Draco.
"Come back to give another love confession Potter?" Draco didn't even need to turn around to know who it was, something Harry would never understand: how good his sixth sense was.
"Oh look at this. I've got..." Harry stopped, pointing to the classroom, about to say something about the two of them splitting up now when he realised that they were at... "Potions." He grumbled.
"You jealous?"
"Okay, then what goes next?"
Lies.
"Potter, you idiot." She flicked his forehead with her finger, rebounding Draco's head back slightly. "It wasn't that hard to guess. Merlin, no need to make your brain explode."
Oh no.
"Him?" Hermione herself could admit that wasn't the best response, but even her, one of the smartest people in the year, could admit that Harry had just revealed a lot.
Draco, however, was immediately defensive of his house, speaking up. "Imagine being a Gryffindor; that's even worse. Slytherins are superior. End of."
"You shouldn't be rude. Ginny's a really nice girl." Harry defended.
But Draco wanted Harry to look up, he wanted to see those blazing green eyes.
Somewhere so far, but so close, Draco sat leaned up against his door, his whole room a mess. In his frustration, he had knocked down anything that had gotten in his way and pulled out the note his father had given him to read after he had left the Manor:
"Well I've really gotten to know her these past few weeks, and it was really great, I can't lie–"
And back to the stupid Weaslette. "I wouldn't waste a breath or a stare on that girl."
Draco felt insulted at Harry's accusation, looking back up at him. "What's that meant to mean?"
Draco's mood had completely flipped from the caring side Harry had just seen a few seconds ago back to the reserved one he knew so well. Harry didn't know this, since he so unfortunately wasn't inside Draco's brain, but Draco was still seething at whoever had thought they could even lay a hand on Harry's face. Harry didn't even seem too affected which irritated him more. (Typical life of a chosen one, Draco supposed.)
didn't reply at first, trying to grab time for his hormones to stop running wild and not speaking in fear that his voice would come out very breathy and desperate, so he took a few seconds to attempt to get his breathing back to normal before murmuring a small 'okay', despite it not being okay; his cheeks were on fire and there was no way they'd be able to cool down with Harry this close to him. As if that wasn't enough, he felt Harry's warm hand slide underneath his shirt, meeting his skin that was still burning from Harry's simple touch. Perhaps Harry could feel how hot he was, but he didn't say anything, all Draco heard come out of Harry's mouth was a simple sigh of relief, the warm air fanning Draco's neck.
enjoy :)
Draco felt Harry's shoulder rub against his own, knowing Harry had also sat down, "I think I like boys Harry, this isn't good."
"I wouldn't go that far."
Draco was the one Harry was upset about.
It went quiet but Harry knew Ron was still there, hearing the sound of his feet moving. "You know, we don't judge you for what happened in potions today."
Yet Draco couldn't help but snap back a response when Harry instructed him to do something for the third time, "Merlin, am I some kind of pet you're ordering around?"
Would Harry stick up for Draco in the same way he did for Ginny? Definitely not, Draco dismissed the silly thought.
"So when I told you to go practise with somebody you weren't close with, you chose... Malfoy?" Hermione still chose to focus on the first part of the story on how, and why, Harry had chosen
But almost would never be fully.
"Can't you remember anything? You were the one who practically begged for it to be there.
"And as for you Malfoy." She turned to him, pointing her wand at him to do a spell and check for injuries. "You seem to have come out unscathed."
"No more questions?"
Harry picked up his quill and began to write whilst Draco watched on in amusement at Harry's determination. His grip on the quill was tight and his brows slightly furrowed as his stare focussed on the papers in front of him.
"Why would it be?" I snapped back, watching his trademark smirk appear again.
"Twenty extra points from Gryffindor for Potter's lack of organisation." A loud series of groans and murmurs came from the class but Snape simply ignored it. "Go sit down."
Malfoy, however, grabbed onto Harry's arms, whispering a soft "Stay" that Harry wanted to listen to, but he just didn't think Malfoy would be that glad to wake up in the morning and find the two of them together spooning. So Harry stayed still for a few minutes, making sure to keep a distance between his dick and Malfoy's ass, even though it was difficult with Malfoy being such a horny sleeping person, moving back into Harry, but eventually, Harry was able to slowly take his arms away from Malfoy and carefully slid out of the bed, searching for his invisibility cloak.
Harry couldn't see Draco's reaction but maybe it was better that way; Draco frowned and grunted out a small "Okay."
Draco regretted asking the question when Harry took his lips away, instantly feeling the air rush onto his neck. "Yeah, practised a bit." Harry answered sheepishly but Draco raised a brow; was it that Ginger girl he had practised on? Harry caught Draco's look and brought up his arm. "Practise."
They couldn't be though, I answered for myself, he wouldn't have done what he did yesterday.
Harry was about to explain that he wasn't, but just decided to keep quiet since it wasn't that serious of a misunderstanding. "Are you mad at me?" Harry bravely asked. After the quidditch game,
Harry's smile came back as he leaned off of the tree, gently pushing Draco's arm. "Don't do that again, I would've been so upset if it were true."
Okay, he needed to control himself, this was just Draco, there was no need for him to behave like a feral animal.
"Did it work?"
"Really?" Harry got excited but then his mood was immediately put out when he realised that if Draco really liked him in that way, he wouldn't have gone up to Pansy and snogged the living daylights out of her. "I don't think so."
"Harry you're in my way." Draco spoke matter-of-factly.
"What do you mean by oh?" Harry questioned worriedly.
Draco nodded curtly.
"Why me?" Harry immediately protested; he wasn't going to accept being treated like one of Draco's house elves.
Harry took Draco being comfortable enough to smile with him as an invitation to sit on Draco's bed, complimenting his bouncy it was.
Draco gave a stiff nod and the-slightly tensed-silence resumed. Draco stayed silent but Harry was humming quietly to himself, using his fingers to play a mini game that he had been taught by Jack... Oh! Jack. "You know Jack?"
Dumb.
Draco nodded straight away, accidentally showing how eager he was to hear Harry say those words.
"I'll go then."
It clicked for Harry, or at least he thought it had clicked for him. "Do you injure yourself a lot?"
"Because what?"
Right in front of Draco and Snape.
"Fine, just– Ugh." Although Draco grabbed Harry's hand roughly, looking to the side to make sure nobody was lurking in the corner watching them, he gently kissed the small mark that was on Harry's wrist before dropping his arm, letting it hang by his side. Harry was full on grinning by now and gazed at the place Draco had kissed in delight. "I feel so much better now, thanks."
Harry stared into those grey eyes he had become familiar with, trying to grasp where he was. "Wha-? Why am I... Where?"
"Heal me like last time." Harry responded in a laidback manner.
"If I don't find it by tomorrow, that'd be helpful but for now, I'll just carry on retracing my steps."
"Time sure isn't your greatest asset." Draco welcomed an angry Harry who rolled his eyes at him, staying quiet. "Go get the ingredients then."
"I'm not saying anything, nope." Harry folded his lips, shaking his head.
Oh no.
Draco didn't fully understand what Harry meant by that, but he still felt his heart flutter and looked up at him, wondering how he had managed to get so close to someone who a year ago he'd call his enemy and gladly hex the living daylights out of.
"Whatever you say Malfoy." With that, she dramatically strutted away, a small hope in her that Draco would follow after her, but he never did.
She stayed quiet, looking him up and down before speaking again. "Uh huh, Harry tells me you two are friends."
He was... outside?
"It's fine, honestly. I guess we're both stupid then." Harry shrugged and without thinking placed his hand on Draco's thigh but feeling Draco tense under him, he snatched his hand back to his lap. "Sorry."
"Oh." Harry stopped talking and moved closer to Draco, their shoulders touching, then continued a second later. "I wonder how Ginny did in her test." Harry accidentally thought out loud, but Draco heard it loud and clear. Before Harry could say anything more, Draco had pushed him harshly against the wall, his eyes flaming with anger. "Someone ought to watch what comes out of that pretty mouth of yours."
"Oops."
"I did it right, didn't I? I can tell by your face." Harry grinned lazily, pulling at Draco's heart strings.
"Hm. Well, I'd rank me first." Harry smiled, dismissing Draco's slight dig at him. "You wanna know something?"
Draco gingerly placed his fingers underneath Harry's chin, being painfully aware of the way Harry squirmed, and slowly lifted Harry's head so they were seeing eye to eye. "You're hurt, that isn't nothing."
"Don't go all stroppy on me."
So induced in their lust state, they didn't realise someone had been knocking on the door until the person shouted from behind it. "Draco Lucius Malfoy! Am I really gonna have to get my wand out to open this door?"
"Huh?" Ron spoke, relatively loud, causing Snape's alert ears to hear and him to turn and give both of them a glare.
"I asked Ginny out on a date today." Harry finally spoke, though Draco would've preferred the silence over learning about Harry's dating life. "Well, I wouldn't entirely call it a date, but we're gonna hang out. Just the two of us."
"I'm not walking too fast, you're walking too sl-" Draco turned around, stopping when he saw Harry limping. "Wow, Potter, you really are a liability."
"Only?" Which for Draco translated as 'Three days too long'.
Granger didn't believe Draco for a second though, raising a brow at him. "Whatever you're planning on doing with Harry, don't."
"Great." But there was no enthusiasm in his voice as Madam Pomfrey went to attend to some first years who had gotten into a muggle fight.
Draco scoffed; Harry never knew when to stop. "Unlike you, I don't make a list of all the people I kiss and rank them."
led her on a bit with that kiss, but for those comments she would continuously say about Harry, she deserved it.
For once, Harry didn't hear that same bullshit of 'but I don't like boys' and moved so he now sat opposite Draco. "I'll ask you a few questions and you have to answer truthfully."
And although there were many other examples, those two were enough for Draco to wonder how well this friendship would be able to carry on.
"Gryffindor's 10 points behind, but if their star seeker Harry Potter is able to retrieve the Golden Snitch, it'll be a sure win, unless the Gryffindor seeker stays distracted as he has this whole game... but that doesn't matter, Harry Potter could beat Slytherin in his sleep." Harry heard Lee's voice bellowing around the stadium but instead of comforting him, it put more pressure on him as he tried to block out the noise.
Leaving the stuffy library, Harry let out a deep breath that he had been holding back until he came face to face with Pansy Parkinson.
Inside the bathroom, Draco heard the chuckle of Harry, and wanted to do nothing except storm back into the room and pin Harry's arms behind his back, kiss him until his lips went numb, grind against him till the only name he can remember is Draco's, warn him not to tease Draco again and–
Pansy didn't stop there though. "And you call yourself smart." She muttered, but deliberately loud enough for Draco to hear.
Was what he was going to say before he started to get a bit dizzy, his surroundings kind of mixing into one.
Wait.
"No, it's just–" Harry rubbed his eyes then pinched his arm, ignoring Draco's weird expression towards him. "I can't believe we're together, like right next to each other."
Harry's smile left slowly as his brows furrowed. "I never said that."
. "Idiot."
Draco didn't say anything so Harry made his way over to him. "Are you okay?"
As usual, as soon as he was back on the ground, Harry was ambushed by his friends, hearing congratulations.
smart arsed remark, but with Harry's smile being too infectious, he just averted his gaze to the ground, concealing the smile on his face. "Us. As in the two opposites– Well, not opposites, but like...Uhh– Oh! A classic enemies to lovers book." Harry's grin widened at finally finding the right words to say.
be able to relax like this... but that wasn't the end of it, because then Harry's fingers 'accidentally' grazed Draco's dick, and Draco was so touch deprived that one little brush of the hand was enough to set him off, as he held in a groan.
"No, not like that stupid. I meant if you got a partner, would your father be in the relationship?"
"No, I haven't yet, but isn't it due Monday?"
"Me." Draco muttered quietly, stepping around Harry to sit down, his back against the tree whilst looking to the side at the school's building.
He nodded his head, all his thoughts on Draco. Hermione could sense this and put her arm around his shoulder, pulling him in so his head was against her chest, breathing in her sweet scent. Harry gladly accepted the comforting for at least he knew Hermione was still there, and that he would do anything to not lose her too.
Draco let out the breath he'd been holding yet as soon as he registered that he was feeling relief at Harry's words, he didn't feel too good afterwards; why was he happy that Harry still had a one way crush on him?
"Do you spray some kind of sleep potion on it?"
Harry didn't look like he wanted to repeat it again, his face scrunching up into one of displeasure. "But that doesn't matter right? Since you're not gay and stuff..." He stuffed his hands into his pockets, peering at Draco for his response.
Another worry to add onto the list: dealing with Malfoy.
"What?" Draco frowned and looked up at Harry bemused.
"It's probably a bruise from when I fell last night." Harry lied, seeing in Hermione's face that she wasn't buying it.
"No! I have—I mean, I... Ugh, I'm not answering this." By now, Draco's whole cheeks were glowing red but Harry didn't point it out, convinced that Draco was feeling enough shame as it was.
^if that doesn't make sense just ignore it lmao
Before I could even utter a 'you wish', Malfoy had pulled away, no longer looking at me. "See you in potions." He seemed like he wanted to say something else but he just walked away, leaving me leaning against the wall. I shook my head, as if shaking off everything that had just happened, but the distinct smell of mint still lingered in the air. Maybe next time I would just stay in the Great Hall; it sure seemed like the safer option.
She stood up, placing her hands on Harry's shoulders to keep him in place. "I'm certain that you and the team are going to play as well as you guys always do. The Golden Snitch was practically made for you. Malfoy's got nothing on you, alright? Just focus and take deep breaths."
Were they together?
Harry should have looked away, maybe it would've been easier to say no, but then Draco was placing soft kisses on his jaw, getting closer and closer to Harry's mouth, grazing the corner of his lips. "Only five." Draco whispered, his hand sneaking down into Harry's lap.
Harry's dream was absolutely lush.
"In the Great Hall. I saw you looking."
God, he did not want to repeat it, but he still did. "I want to kiss you."
"I think– I like him, Hermione. Fuck." Harry placed his tongue on the roof of his mouth, trying to get the image of Draco kissing Pansy away, and held his head up high to stop the tears from falling. "And while I'm here losing my mind over him, he's off snogging another girl. I... I just don't understand what I did to him."
"Just because you're invisible, Potter, does not mean you are soundless. Anybody would be able to tell with those clunky footsteps of yours." Draco turned around, Harry instantly seeing the bags under Draco's paler-than-usual skin.
"At least you've told him, gotten it all off of your chest." Hermione was still trying to encourage him, lighten up the mood, having seen Harry's withdrawal to conversations for the past week.
"Why'd you think something's wrong?"
Harry felt like his head was spinning, Draco and Snape's voice attacking him from all corners as his legs started to feel like jelly.
"But you kissed her." Harry rightfully pointed out.
Harry still stayed against the wall, his uniform now a mess and his cheeks rosy, "That was unexpected." He stated the obvious, seeming unaffected in Draco's eyes whilst actually panicking on the inside.
Maybe that would explain why whatever happened in the next thirty seconds did.
Draco didn't even know where to start with his long list of questions: How had he gotten into the Slytherin dungeons? How did he know Draco would be here? How did he know which room was Draco's?
fact of him basically molesting Malfoy...
He breathed into the person's neck, kissing it softly until he heard the person speak. "
And as Snape loured at the two of them, neither of them even noticed the scolding he was giving to the both of them, Draco seeing Harry trying his best to cover his smile, failing horribly leading to Snape taking off another five points from Gryffindor for Harry's discourtesy.
Draco froze, blinking at Harry.  “Um, did you just say you love me.”
Draco snuggled against his side, seeming relaxed.
Harry rolled on to his back, covering his face with his hands.  “I feel even worse now, for what I did at the castle.  I didn’t realize you had feelings like that...”
“Are you having sex with other people, Potter?” Draco asked with a drawl.
Draco passed him a soapy sponge, and faced the other way.  For all his bravado, Harry knew this was a first for him too.  Running the sponge over his back was a safe place to start.
Sighing, Draco rolled off Harry to lie beside him.  He blinked up at the ceiling.  The room was dim, with just moonlight coming in through the window.
Was he actually going to do this?  Try to seduce Draco Malfoy?  He was a virgin, and there was a very good chance Draco was too.  Would it actually have to be full sex?  More than once?  How far was Harry willing to go?
It felt much better to be taking action.  It was a long shot, but they had to escape.  Had to get Hermione away from that witch.  Ron was more dominant than Harry had ever seen him before, grabbing Wormtail’s wand before Harry could, and disarming Bellatrix.
“I want to have a little conversation with this one, girl to girl,” she barked, her hand latching on to Hermione’s arm.
Nodding, Harry stepped closer.  “Um, yeah.  I’ve been working on a few wandless spells.  To be safer at work, you know...”  As an auror, you could drop your wand or be disarmed in a fight, and it was useful to be able to make a quick getaway.
Pausing, his eyes lifted to Draco’s face.  He was panting, fair hair in a tangled mess along the cushions.  His skin illuminated from the fireplace and surrounding candles of the Christmas tree.  “Yes, Draco?”  Harry asked, swallowing.  His fingers had unhooked the last button and now they rested hesitantly at Draco’s waistband.
“Fourth year?”  Seamus whispered, his own eyes the size of saucers.  “Merlin, Draco!  You
“Are you all right?” Harry asked him, in between taking a few large breaths.
She pushed her way in between them, shoving her sister firmly into the kitchen.  “Stop flirting with him, Padma!  He’s not interested!”
“What?  No, of course not!” He flushes, looking slightly to the left of her, his gaze focusing on her diamond earrings.  “It’s just something I’d rather not see first thing in the morning...”
He took a shuddering breath, trying to calm his racing heart.  When he finally felt like he had everything under control he muttered, “Then show me what you can do, Potter.”
.  Even his friends (really, just Pansy or Blaise at this point) preferred to call him darling or honey or love.  It was kind of nice, being a
“Yeah, yeah,” he said behind a baroque room divider.  He’d been hidden behind there for ages and Draco was just about to get up and go downstairs.
No.  It certainly was the best way to go.  Of that, Draco was sure.
Harry stood up, helping Draco down the last step.  Now on even footing, Draco was still slightly taller.  Harry stood on the tips of his toes and reached for Draco’s lips with his own.  Even though it was a quick, practically chaste kiss, Draco still felt as if he was melting.  Harry’s smile and his sheer close proximity wasn’t helping matters either.
“Oi, shush you,” Thomas pushed him back onto the couch.  “Listen, Malfoy.  I just wanted to apologize.  If I’d have known you were in there with Harry, I’d have never walked in like that.  It wasn’t my place and I feel like a right arsehole over the whole thing.”
“What’s a Grinch?” Draco furrowed his brows, confused.
“I didn’t even know what it was at the time,” Draco tried to shrug it off.  “I spent a lot of time that year watching him and wondering.  Making Potter stinks badges.  I guess I just wanted him to
“Have you seen it?” Pansy leaned over, whispering.  Or rather, she tried to whisper.  Pansy was never quiet nor subtle about anything.
The Parkinson family held a Christmas tradition each and every year.  They would host one of the most spectacular parties, where only the most exclusive and elite wizarding population were allowed to attend.  Pansy had told Draco it was a party passed down from generation through generation, starting as far back as Perseus Parkinson when he served as Minister for Magic.  And one of the more bizarre things about this party was despite your social standing within society, if you were a member of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, you were given a complimentary invitation regardless of your reputation.
“Fine!”  He growled.  “He’s not that big!  You are ridiculous!”
For graduating Hogwarts, Blaise Zabini was gifted with a Victorian townhouse in Chelsea.  It was similar in the way to how Pansy’s flat was, nestled between other neighboring Muggle properties.  However, the home itself was magical in nature, charmed space expanding from the moment you stepped through the front door.  The best feature of the townhouse was the entrance way.  Once you walked in, the floor plan was very open and there were staircases on either side trimmed in a rich mahogany.  For this particular Christmas party, Blaise had decorated the banisters with hundreds of Christmas ornaments and a spiraling garland.  Two Christmas trees could be seen, one in the main hall, and one directly atop of it on the second-floor entrance way.  It was at this entrance way that the Slytherins got their first look at their dates for the evening.
He felt Potter’s hand grip his upper arm, pulling him around.  Draco’s breath left him in a whoosh as he stumbled into the other man’s chest.  Potter wrapped his arm firmly around Draco’s waist, keeping him there.  He had no intention of letting go.  “Malfoy,” he whispered, his breath ruffling Draco’s hair.  “I know you love running, but you don’t need to run from me.  I’m not going to hurt you...”
“So, let me get this straight.  You ran away with your tail between your legs all because Harry fucking Potter
Immediately Draco bucked off the bed in a shout, Harry pinning him in place with hands on either side of his hips.  Draco shuddered.  “Harry....I’m...Merlin, you’re going to kill me if you don’t stop....”
Before he could consider walking over to them, the Floo flared.  Oh yes, Pansy.  The whole reason Draco had been sitting in front of the fireplace in the first place.  He needed her help desperately for his upcoming date with Harry.  She had cleared her schedule for the following evening and now here she was, getting caught in the garland draped over the fire.  She batted it away, the greenery pulling her hair into a tangle.  Huffing, she managed to disentangle herself.  “Merlin, Draco.  What the hell is all this?” she asked in irritation before she joined him on the couch.
Draco’s face felt like it was on fire.  He had to get out of there, fast.
He took a sip of his minty tea and Draco watched closely as he swallowed.  “Merlin,” Dean cut in.  “If you guys want, we can leave you two alone.  I don’t think I can stand much more of how you two are looking at each other...”
side in all this?  You know what he is, Harry!  He shouldn’t even be here!”
“So?  Lots of friends want to go eat together.  We’ve been going out to eat for weeks now.  It doesn't mean anything like that.  Potter’s just trying to be friendly, I think.”
.  Instead of outright answering him, Draco attempted to redirect the conversation.  “And just what exactly is your type Potter?”
“A dance?  Here?”  Draco raised an eyebrow, questioningly.  Still, he couldn’t help but slip his hand into Harry’s, their fingers tangling.
“Right,” Draco colored.  “This is somewhat embarrassing for me to say, but I think you should know before we get any further.”  Harry’s eyebrows rose, but he didn’t dare interrupt and waited patiently for Draco to continue.  Draco inhaled once more and let out a shaking breath.  “It’s just...I’ve never been completely intimate with another person.  I mean, oral sex, yes.  But to actually...”
“We’re going to get going,” Parvati finished for her sister, grabbing her by the arm and pulling her out the door.
your friend?”  For some reason, he couldn’t stop the words from flying out of his mouth.  But he was rather curious about all of it.  What if they had an open relationship or something of the sort?
It wasn’t long before they had moved to the couch and pulled the stereo with them onto the coffee table.  Potter continued to point out what each button did, while the cd kept playing through the rest of the tracks.  “And this button, er, it’s used to randomize what songs play from a cd.  Then this one can repeat the song over and over, or you can press this one which will just repeat the whole cd over again.”
Licking his lips, he noted just how swollen they felt.  Despite the movement, Harry’s eyes stayed focused to his.  Smiling shyly, Draco whispered, “I’m not sure.  What would you like?”
“You think they’ve shagged?” she asks, pulling out her olive and taking a bite.
“Hmm...” She dabs delicately at her lips, wiping the crumbs of her lemon bar off her face.  “Do you have a problem with that, Draco?”
Dean preened.  Draco rolled his eyes in irritation, waving for him to continue.  “Well, ok.  We’re struggling with our potions research assignment.  You’re easily the best at potions.  Will you help us tonight?”
Whining, one of Draco’s hands at Harry’s back slipped to his arse.  He gripped tight at the clenched muscle, which seemed to spur Harry on even more.  They were shifting together now, each trying to get that much closer, push that much further in.  Draco, already so close to begin with, felt a sharp spike of pleasure and screamed.  Harry panted, biting softly at Draco’s jaw and stroking him in time to their faster pace.  He could tell Draco was close, feeling him throbbing under his fingers.
He walked the opposite direction, heading towards the nearest apparition point.  This street was quite a bit more heavily travelled, full of Muggles doing their Christmas shopping, food trucks lining the street and offering up all sorts of goods, and rowdy music seeping out from the pubs.  The apparition point was just past this one bar, around the corner and down the alley.  He was just about to apparate when a loud hooting noise drew his attention.
“So, did you like it?” He asked, green eyes boring into grey.
It was dark when Draco awoke.  He cringed as he sat up and saw the bloody sweater he was still wearing.  He pulled it off and threw it in the corner with the rest of his laundry, only now noticing the owl sitting patiently on the perch outside his bedroom window.  “Come in, darling,” he cooed, instantly recognizing the owl as Pansy’s.  The bird held a letter.
FUCK,” She ended on a shout, tipping the rest of her wine down her throat and chugging it.  The rest of the bar cheered at that, people getting out of their seats to give her a round of applause.
