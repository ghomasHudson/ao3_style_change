Malfoy dropped his gaze to the floor, speaking softly. "I don't think I ever hated you, Potter. I hated what you represented. I resented the fact that you got away with everything and I hated that you were always better than me, when my father wanted so much for me to be the best at everything. But I never hated you."
"Come here" Draco said in an exaggerated whisper, crooking a finger. Harry sighed and leaned closer to Draco who actually sniffed Harry.
Sighing, Draco turned around to go back to looking for whatever book he was looking for when he heard Harry's voice.
Draco leaned forward and kissed Harry again, slower. He wanted to savor this. The choosen one chose him. The hero picked the villain. Even if it didn't work out in the end, he was what Harry wanted now. And Draco wanted to make every moment count.
They walked in companiable silence until they reached the lifts, then Ron mentioned casually that he'd spoken to Hermione.
Harry pushed him slowly against the desk, watching all the time for signs of discomfort, then popped open the jeans' button, slid down the zipper and wriggled his fingers inside the tight space.
Potter actually looked taken aback and twisted his mug around in his hands until some tea slopped over the edge and onto the table.
The door clicked shut quietly behind Draco. He stalked along the corridor, almost silent on his bare feet. Potter's words seemed to surround him, as sharp-edged as broken shards of glass.
Malfoy's grey eyes narrowed dangerously. "Then why the demonstration?" It was obvious from his expression he wasn't going to let the matter go without further explanation.
"Still verbose then, Potter." There was a little sigh, a warm puff of air against Harry's cheek. "It's alright. Why wouldn't you think that."
Draco looked around; there was nothing there but a few empty pallets, an over-turned barrel and some scraps of rubbish. He turned an enquiring eye on Potter, who seemed to be studying him carefully.
Their arrival at the Ministry caused a flurry and more than a few frowns. Aurors and building maintenance staff were still hard at work restructuring wards. Harry ducked out of the busy atrium as quickly as possible, glad that at least on this occasion the negative attention was more on himself than Malfoy.
"They'll have to believe what I tell them," said Harry shortly. "We wouldn't have Romani without your help."
His pride and feelings were smarting. Ron's face had already spoken volumes without him uttering a single word and Harry had been more than pleased to leave him in charge of the last seized warehouse.
Potter's arm was around him and he was leading him away and then the door closed behind them and the hallway was dim and empty.
Harry stared at her in bewilderment. Of course Malfoy needed treatment, if it wasn't already too late.
Potter's own hand reached around, pressed hard on Draco's flat belly, holding him still as he quickened his pace, the force of his thrusts accompanied by brilliant throbs of pure magic. Then his breath became short, high gasps, his hand sliding down, brushing past Draco's cock to fondle his balls. Draco came immediately in a long pulse that was almost painful, then a series of spine wrenching surges that left him seeing stars. Potter cried out, shuddered erratically inside him, hips pistoning as he came.
"Greyback is coming," he whispered in a broken voice, then leaned to the side and vomited violently onto the floorboards.
"You're serious? Typical. I thought I'd got rid of the worst of the dark magic in this place, but even the plates are poisonous. Depulso!"
It was Ron Weasley. His gaze travelled rapidly over Draco and then visibly brightened as it landed on Potter.
"No harm done," he said casually, stepping out of the shower and purposefully waiting until Potter, obviously flustered, backed out of the room, muttering something about things to do.
Harry scowled at him and didn't bother respond. Instead he gestured to the door to Detention Cell 1. Malfoy took a quick look inside and shook his head. It was the same in Cells 2, 3 and 4. None of the occupants spoke and none of them appeared to realise they were in the presence of the wizard who had blown their pub apart mere hours before. Harry deduced that the character who'd been able to smell his way past Malfoy's glamour was not in custody.
Harry's hand was dislodged and it slipped across the smooth skin of Malfoy's stomach and dropped onto the sheet between them. He considered and regretfully rejected the idea of replacing it.
"He's what happened, filthy Death Eater!". Ron spat the words into Malfoy's face, which didn't waver from its derisive sneer.
Once dressed, Draco cleaned his teeth with a charm, dragged his fingers through his hair, snagged a pale brown jacket from a hanger and left without even glancing in the rather shocked mirror.
For the first few hours they worked their way steadily through muggle London. Shops, bars, clubs, restaurants. Sometimes they all entered, although Draco went alone into two of the more exclusive clubs. Potter and Weasley wore a variety of glamours and transfigured clothing, but Draco retained his Malfoy looks, tweaking his clothing to fit the location. By mid-afternoon they'd left a trail of subtle queries behind them that would leave no doubt in the mind of the right wizard or witch that a pureblood was seeking a business contact with some ex-schoolboys from a certain boarding school in Scotland.
"We'll deal with that if it happens. The Minister is prepared to take the risk and we've gambled on worse odds, Harry."
Potter smiled at him, cool as cucumber, displaying no hint that he'd just been performing fellatio on none other than Draco Malfoy.
"Like you?" Confusion gave way slowly to understanding. "No, it's not that! I felt, before, how scared you were."
A fourth unknown figure burst into the cavernous space through a side door to the left and his "Stupefy!" was a split second later than Granger's sharp "Incarcerous!" The curses collided, writhing on the floor like a tangled mass of highly charged snakes.
Malfoy's cock was hot and hard, his skin silky smooth as Harry's fingertips freed it and slowly stroked its length, his eyes feasting on the pink flush spreading above the other man's collar as his head dropped backwards and his mouth opened. Harry leaned in, nibbling and kissing his exposed throat, mouthing at the nipple protuding through the thin material of his t-shirt.
"Greyback isn't here," said Potter faintly. "There's nobody here but us. You were hallucinating; you're running a really high fever, Malfoy."
His decision was already made and was inevitable. Anything was better than nothing. And after...Draco was used to pain and Potter need never know that his arch-nemesis had done the unforgivable and let his feelings get involved.
Before his eyes the chair was transfigured into a potted plant, a plate of spaghetti and then an angry cat that spat and clawed at them. Malfoy cast spell after spell, multi-coloured energy crackling around his tall figure as he scribed elegant movements with his hands. Harry thought it just might be the hottest thing he'd ever seen.
Suddenly the armchair faltered. In the momentary lull the sound of Malfoy's breath sounded sharp and stressed. He seemed to sway, turning in Harry's direction with a face that was drawn, exhausted. Behind him the chair flickered and became a dark cloud shot through with lightning; it began to turn in on itself, twisting and spinning until a mini-tornado tore across the room.
Malfoy blinked at him in bewilderment but put his cool hand in Harry's and allowed himself to be hoisted to his feet, although he didn't follow when Harry took a few steps towards the door, remaining in place and staring at the rumpled gym mats with a vacant expression on his face. The thought of making him run the gamut of vicious comments from late-night workers at their desks, in the lifts and in the atrium was unbearable.
Something of Harry's trepidation must have shown on his face because Madam Pomfrey laid a hand on his arm.
The smooth ceramic of the mug was too hot beneath the pads of Draco's fingers, but he couldn't let go, sensing somehow that this was one of those moments, where you balanced on the edge of a knife with no idea what lay in the abyss on either side, sure only that life on the knife edge was unsustainable.
Some time later, he became aware that Potter was slouched beside him and had hold of his hand. The grip was warm and calloused and thrumming with power. It dulled the pain radiating throughout Draco's body even as it brought back shards of nightmares, all terrifying and all at some point featuring Potter, who had seemed determined to save Draco from whatever terror had hold of him. Time and again Potter's face had appeared in his delirium, always anxious and concerned as his hand reached out to Draco, as though it was the fiendfyre all over again.
He cast a cautious healing charm over the bruises on his face and neck, grateful that a largely sleepless night had given him ample time to practise wandless charms, then went down to the kitchen, his jacket slung over one shoulder and sleeves pushed up far enough that the Dark Mark on his arm was clearly visible. He was not going to pretend to be something he wasn't.
Harry followed him, sending a quick patronus to Ron to let him know that they were alright and that he'd meet him later to explain.
The office was surprisingly empty, containing two dark wooden desks piled high with scrolls and boxes, a chair behind each desk and two uncomfortable looking hard chairs, presumably intended to discourage visitors from over-staying their welcome.
Harry caught his breath, surprise clenching in his chest. The gaunt teenager who had been the bane of his student life at Hogwarts was no more. Bony shoulders that had held promise now showed the strength and breadth of a man, and legs that were long and skinny now revealed a play of lean muscle beneath denim. The haggard, exhausted face of war had filled out and smoothed, jawbone stronger, with the symmetrical facial curves of the young boy on the steps of Hogwarts still visible but now honed into the elegance of adulthood. It was unmistakably Draco Malfoy.
When Draco awoke the next morning, his suit and shoes were floating outside the bedroom door. He plucked them from the air, the unmistakable thrill of Potter's magic caressing his fingers, noting the clothing looked free of creases and ready to wear. It was almost depressing, the thoughtfulness of the gesture above and beyond that necessary between ex-rivals.
"Don't blame Ron." Hermione looked on the verge of tears. "There was a huge explosion and all the alarms went off. Then we found the hole in the wards. When they discovered the epicentre was the gym someone remembered you two going in there, but no one could get in because there was a powerful privacy spell on the door. Eventually the Aurors blew a hole through the wall, but you were gone and there was blood on the floor. What were we supposed to think!?"
He swirled his tongue, one way, then the other, running it up and down the underside before he swallowed deep, one hand kneading Malfoy's ass and the thumb of the other stroking his inner thigh, working under his balls to press against the perineum. Malfoy rocked into his mouth, a stream of muttered curses in what sounded like French falling from his mouth as the pace increased.
Day One of his new and hopefully brief attachment to the Aurors did not start well for Draco. They arrived at the Ministry by floo at exactly five minutes to nine and by two minutes to nine the entire workforce, their relatives and their friends knew Draco Malfoy had been escorted into the Ministry by Harry Potter.
Now that same hand was his only anchor and Draco hung on, racked occasionally by a cough that left blood in his mouth and a rattling in his windpipe.
Potter stared back at him, clearly frustrated. He dragged a hand through his hair with a sigh. "We'll move on then. If you're sure?"
"I believe Potter, in his rather primitive way, noticed my wardrobe is coordinated," said Draco in a cool tone, although he'd only become aware of the fact during the course of the conversation. Of course, his clothing would usually be chosen deliberately, unlike Potter's random mish mash of colours and textures or Weasley's predilection for hand-knitted jumpers. This morning it had been pure chance.
"What? No, mate! We're partners and this is our office. It's that pointy git that needs to move, preferably into a cell. He's probably behind the whole thing anyway."
Harry then went by floo from the Ministry of Magic directly to Hermione's office. He stepped out of the fireplace into morning sunlight heavy with the smell of herbal tea. It was no surprise to find her at work early, half-hidden behind a massive stack of parchment. She listened to him patiently and then pulled out several law books, flipping rapidly through the pages while Harry helped himself to home-made biscuits and admired the mysteries section of the impressive and well-organised bookcases.
"It was alright, I suppose. Not accurate enough for fine detail, but it worked for every day things."
"Yeah, I believe you. But that doesn't mean you can't help. You know potions and you know, or knew, the sort of people who might be involved."
"You're afraid of losing your friends? Because of me?" He sounded resigned, almost as though he was expecting a dismissal.
Left eye swelling, Draco staggered away from a kick that landed perilously close to his groin and hooked his foot around Potter's knee. Potter, nose bleeding, promptly bit him on the calf as he fell and dragged him down by gripping onto his t-shirt.
"Let me make myself clear; I don't like your sort and I don't trust you; I'd just as soon throw you back into Azkaban..."
Any possible discussion about the Boy Who Lived being wary of a school healer was avoided when the Madam in question appeared in the floo. She dusted off her robes and fixed Malfoy with a stern glance.
Fearing on some subliminal level that Potter was the sort who would like to talk about things, Draco was tempted to close his eyes and pretend to be asleep. After all, Potter probably hadn't had much choice when it came to caring and sharing, being friends with Granger and the gregarious Weasleys. Draco however, was a Malfoy and did not wish to care and share in any manner.
He was very close now, the soft skin of his cheek cool against Harry's temple as he pulled him in and wrapped his arms around him.
Potter grimaced at the weather and shrugged his agreement.  "There's a nice caf round the corner. I came down here a couple of times when I was working on the Muldoon case."
"You're a person of interest, that's all. Look, Malfoy, if you are involved it'll go easier on you if you help us."
"Do you need to sit down, Malfoy? Yeah, of course you do. I'm sorry. C'mon, it's just through here."
It reminded him that it was odd there'd been no mention of his comments the previous evening; Harry had been expecting at the very least a sharp jibe or two. All his own attempts to bring up the subject had been swiftly diverted, but perhaps it was just another indication that Malfoy was no longer the school boy he remembered.
A mate, thought Harry, bemused and not at all sure his ex-nemesis would be overly pleased at that thought.
The Hag's Skeleton public house was a looming structure, its odd collection of dark roofs partly obscured by the acrid smoke belching out of several scarily leaning chimneys. Malfoy strode across the courtyard, cast a glance at the caged and mouldy skeleton suspended over the doorway and ducked inside. There was a brief blast of wild music and hard laughter and then the door shut behind him.
"Yeah." Potter pulled him closer and kissed his jaw. "I didn't mean to put you through anything else..."
With a look of boredom, often present on Ministry couriers, the owl helped itself to a treat from the dish on the window ledge while Harry scribbled a quick response. Minutes later, message attached, it slipped out through the open window and soared out of sight.
Hunching his shoulders against the chill wind whipping across the empty yard, Draco made a show of looking around at the nearby buildings; they were old, probably Victorian, red brick and squat under the leaden sky. He estimated they were just inside the boundaries of Wizarding London.
Malfoy lifted his face then, the shadows masking his expression. "Might as well. It's not as though it's going to keep me awake really is it?"
Reluctantly, Harry headed towards the dispensary, casting a quick glance over his shoulder as he did so. He caught a glimpse of Malfoy's blond head on the far side of the glass and decided to hope for the best.
"Ranworth and Briggs have a lead. Meeting with them early. I'll floo you when I know where we're heading."
Heart pounding so hard he was dizzy, he dropped to his knees, tugging down Malfoy's jeans as he descended. The man's cock jutted out between them, flushed now and leaking copiously as Harry ran a tongue slowly over the tip.
Malfoy rolled onto his back, pulling Harry on top of him and rolling his hips up. Harry gasped, a surge of lust rushing through him at the contrast of the vulnerability of Malfoy's body beneath his own, yet the strength of the man's grip on Harry's biceps.
"Sit down," said Harry sharply, pushing him gently towards a wooden bench. Malfoy obliged, sinking down in a surprisingly graceless manner.
"It's from Briggs," Harry announced. "One of the suspects talked. It looks like we have enough to convict Romani and O'Keefe. No-one is saying anything about Snakeskin Potions though; we still haven't got any leads on them."
"I don't talk about it. I couldn't remember all of it for a long time..." She shrugged and sent Harry a brave little smile. "It's in the past now."
Draco watched him from his position halfway down the staircase. It seemed as though the hair tugging was neither solving the problem nor making the unruly hair any tidier and so after a minute he broke the silence.
Malfoy seemed to deflate, exuding a weariness that Harry could feel without any physical connection at all. Without thinking he stepped over and held out his hand.
"It did to some of them. And the others, you of all people aren't responsible for what happened to them. It was a war, Potter. People get hurt in wars; they die."
He showered, leaning on the tiled wall for support, losing himself in the feel of the warm water sliding smoothly over his skin. He was beginning to drift off when Potter banged on the bathroom door.
"You all know Mr Malfoy," said Potter calmly. "He'll be working with me in an advisory capacity for a while."
He turned on the spot immediately and vanished with a sharp crack. Draco was about to follow when Weasley caught his elbow.
"Just look at what Ranworth seized though. That poncy handwriting on the order looks a lot like Malfoy's. Merlin knows Snape shoved it under our noses enough!"
It was mid-morning by the time Potter returned to Grimmauld Place. He looked ill at ease and as soon as he'd dumped the carrier bags of shopping on the hall floor he started running his fingers through his hair in a distracted manner.
They hurtled through the bewildering maze of shafts, Harry completely aware of the soft puff of breath against the back of his neck and the fresh tingle of magic from Malfoy's hand. The connection between their magical fields was less powerful since Malfoy's outburst of wandless magic, but was still clear enough that Harry could pick up a jumble of conflicting emotions.
"River Water."Malfoy dropped his gaze, his blond hair falling forwards." It helps you to forget, Potter."
"Oh well done, Mr Potter," gushed the reception witch. "The likes of him should never have been let out of Azkaban."
Malfoy stood perfectly still for a moment, his face white and set, then he took a deliberate step forwards into Harry's personal space, grey eyes wide and his fingers tracing a quivering path along Harry's hip. Harry understood, with shocking clarity, that they were going to fuck, and that it was somehow essential to Malfoy's sanity that they did so right now and at his instigation. It made Harry a little breathless, stirring adrenaline in his belly, that understanding and the subsequent willing acquiescence of any control he had over the situation.
He made a gesture and Draco's clothes flew away from him, the stone wall cold and rough against his chest as Potter spun him around, the length of his cock hard and hot against Draco's inner thigh. Draco braced himself with his hands, pushing his arse back against Potter, unable to stop a ragged moan escaping. He wondered if it made him sound cheap, found he didn't care much one way or the other.
It was equally unfortunate that, partially dazzled, Potter saw the blue streak of light and Draco with his hand raised. He raised his own shield immediately and threw "Immobolus" at Draco, then with a look of intense betrayal on his face he yelled something to Weasley and they disapparated with a loud crack.
Sometime during the night he lost count of the number of times he had to restrain Malfoy physically, conscious always of the man's injuries and horribly aware that with each passing hour the ex-Death Eater was becoming steadily weaker.
“I know you’re screwing him. I’m a tabloid reporter, and I’m very good at my job,” Lockhart said with a nasty smile.
“I’ve been miserable too. That’s why I’m here. I know I have a lot of nerve coming here, but I need a place to stay for a bit,” Draco confided. “It’s a very long and rather sordid story.”
“Did you leave the lights on?” Harry pointed to Draco’s upstairs window when they parked in Draco’s driveway.
“To be fair, Harry knew what he signed up for. Sirius and Remus had been together on and off for twenty-five years at that point and time. With that much history, it was bound to make moving on a challenge if Remus succeeded in doing so at all,” Hermione reasoned.
“Sort of,” Harry told him as he closed the front door. Just then Rolf shifted in his chair, and found Harry’s missing glasses. He put them on the coffee table and resumed his reading.
“I’d hate to end up couch surfing again,” Harry grimaced. He and Dudley had stayed in shelters and later with Charlie when they first moved to Notting Hill. Olivia told him to use some of his own life details to make the ruse easier.
“He worked for me about eight or nine years ago,” Jamie replied. “He was hardworking, punctual, but after awhile I could tell he wasn’t into it. I advised him to quit. I don’t want anyone working for me who doesn’t want to.”
I don’t ship Harmione and I also don't ship Dramione. I was Romione all the way when I was younger, and to a certain degree I still am. Nowadays, I’m also very fond of badass mofo putting the sing in single Hermione. Getting married isn’t all there is to life, after all. I didn’t care for Canon Hermione book wise. Movie wise I loved her, so even though I can see Hermione being characterized both as a white woman and as a BIPOC, I see her core essence being akin to Emma Watson.
“What do you want me to do?” Harry turned away from him and pressed his panic button. He had roughly ten minutes to finish this. He could do it. He owed to Draco. And Lockhart’s other victims.
“If they are okay with it, I’ll send my attorney over to meet with them. His specialty is helping LGBT people,” Draco suggested.
“Hey, you a friend of Harry’s?” Hermione asked cheerfully as she answered the door. “He’s at work. He’ll be home at four.”
“If I say yes, will you be cross with me?” he winced. Hermione motioned him inside and led him into the kitchen.
“Her name is Hermione. She’s trans, and a feminist activist,” Remus told him as he showed Harry a picture of a woman with brown skin and curly dark brown hair. “To be honest, she’s not coming here looking for a date. She’s perfectly happy in her words being self-partnered. She’s looking to make new friends.”
“So, week three of blind dating. Yay,” Harry rolled his eyes as he clapped loudly. “All jokes aside, I’m really glad Thyme and Charlie hit it off. Charlie deserves to be happy.”
“Beauty comes from ashes,” Harry read with a bright smile. “I love it! It’s the perfect way to describe our marriage.”
Sorry for the long pause again. Pride Month just felt so sad this year. On top of J.K. Rowling's willingness to prove over and over again she's transphobic as fuck, Trump restricts trans rights even further on the anniversary of the Pulse Nightclub shooting. And let's not forget the rotten cherry on top of this moldy sundae: J.K. Rowling's transphobia was quoted by a Senator who voted against the now stalled Equality Act. 2020 is no one's year, to put it plainly. With all of that being said, I owe it to you, my readers to soldier on. I finished writing this fanfiction before I ever posted the first chapter, so now it's just about getting it put up. I'm hoping to have all the chapters up by the end of the week.
“So, Charlie mentioned you were involved with his cousin,” Draco breached over a dinner of vegetarian sushi, martinis, and vegetable stir fry.
“What magazine are you from?” Blaise asked as he pulled out a clipboard and wrote Harry’s name down.
“He tried to kiss me. He was definitely trying to seduce me, and he bought every word of my story,” Harry grimaced when he mentioned the almost kiss, and smiled proudly at the rest.
“He’s finally asleep,” Harry whispered as he came into Mione’s room and quietly closed the door. He was sharing with her while Draco was staying.
“He took your bait, Liv,” Harry said as he walked into the kitchen. Draco put on a DVD for Noah and Teddy and quickly joined them.
“Objection sustained,” Judge Liz Donnelly. “Mr. Berger, one more little stunt like that and you’ll be in contempt.”
Harry sighed and nodded. “We ended up being flatmates, which seemed like a good idea at the time because we were having sex. It eliminated the need to move between flats. Everything was fine until he started bringing people home. I was under the impression we were only seeing each other. After a month of constant shouting matches, he ended up leaving me for a guy who was better suited for him.”
Draco came back twenty minutes later wearing a black button down shirt, and grey slacks. He held out his hand again. “Thanks for your help. Would you mind if I used your phone to call my driver?”
“I’ve got this flavored water Rolf loves. To me, it’s horrendous and has absolutely nothing to do with the fruits of the forest it claims association with,” Harry made a face and blushed as Draco began laughing loudly.
“Ron,” Harry grimaced. “He was the rebound guy after Remus. My heart just wasn’t ready for a serious relationship, so when I met Ron at a bar, and he suggested we have a friend with benefits arrangement, I agreed.”
“But, where’s the fun in that?” Charlie snickered as Draco reentered the room and greeted Charlie happily.
“I’m flattered. Truly. But, I don’t want to rush into anything. I’m not exactly practiced,” Harry said with a fake smile and even faker bashful blush.
“Maybe not. I have an idea. He’s resigned and gotten his old job back at London University. I think he thinks that’ll make the allegations go away. He’s back in familiar territory, territory he’s gotten away with doing things like this in, and I think he’s liable to slip up,” Olivia made eye contact with Harry the whole time.
“I saw him do it, and I’ll tell the owner that,” another man said as he stepped out from around the corner.
“Me too. He has a long recovery ahead,” Harry punched his pillow and fought tears. He’d been crying all day.
“So, Rolf challenged this guy to dance to an Aqua song. I think it’s called ‘Barbie Girl.’ The guy was so fucking bad! He ended up taking off his shirt, showing off the tattoo he had of his
It had been five months since he met Hermione, and his state of mind had gotten better ever since she’d come into his life. He’d helped Hermione get a job at the shop, and she was thriving. Both were enjoying the self-partnered life.
“At least you still have your mobility,” Remus said sadly. “I’m stuck in this thing day and night. Before this happened, Siri and I were in the middle of the adoption process. Now, our dream of becoming parents may never happen. Same sex couples are massively excluded and discriminated against under typical circumstances. But, this? It may very well put that dream off forever.”
“Is Rolf going to be there?” D made a face. Rolf Scamander, Harry’s zookeeper flatmate, is something of an odd duck. He took him in two months after his ex, Ron, dumped him for a guy who looks exactly like Tom Hardy. Rolf and D are total opposites, but they’re cordial for his sake.
“Before Mr. Barker destroyed everything, he provided us with evidence,” Alex held up a bag. “Exhibit A. This evidence clearly shows the footage Mr. Lockhart submitted to be tampered with. Mr. Malfoy had no knowledge he was being filmed.”
“We didn’t tell anyone. We’re committed to each other, and that’s all that matters. Getting married was for us,” Sirius said gently as he pulled Harry into a hug. Harry and Sirius began sobbing at the same time.
, and by the end of it, he was humping the floor!” Hermione snorted loudly, her curls flying everywhere as she tossed her head back and laughed. “Rolf then led everyone away from the humper, and proceeded to dance like a fucking boss.”
Draco programmed it in and winked again. “I’m leaving for Toronto in the morning to shoot an episode of an American television show. I’ll call you when I get back.”
“I’ve met them a few times. They frequent the same trans events and rallies that I do. They’re very nice.” Harry was actually looking forward to this date. Thyme was a really good friend, and they knew Harry pretty well.
“Mione called Charlie and told him you were here. She’s covering the rest of my shift so we can talk,” Harry took his hand, his expression open and gentle. Understanding. “Charlie told me all about Gil. What’s been going on?”
“A part of him always will. He was his first love,” Hermione sighed. “But, that doesn’t negate the fact that he has a connection to you. A strong one from what I’ve gathered. He’s been miserable without you.”
“Where are we?” Harry asked. It felt like they’d been driving for hours. Lockhart had stopped on a desolate country road.
“Luna is vegan, and Rolf is vegetarian. They both love this place,” Harry told him as Remus went into the living room to call the restaurant. “Siri was making…. what the actual fuck were you making them?” Harry grimaced at the charred dish that sat next to the guinea fowl.
“I knew he had a crush on you, but I didn’t know if you knew,” Charlie chimed in. “You’re kind of oblivious unless someone’s direct.”
“I’ll handle it,” Harry replied quietly as he headed towards the shelves. He cleared his throat and the man turned around, schooling his features to look confused and curious.
“He’s a good guy and Thyme is a lovely person,” Remus agreed as he and Harry cooked together. “Tonight’s pick is mine. I know you best, after all. But, I wanted to humor everyone else first.”
“I’m not dating him. He’s gorgeous and lovely, but I’m happy being single,” Hermione reassured him. “Let me guess, you’re Draco.”
Author’s Note: This was a heavy chapter, and I wanted to end it on a good note with an FYI. The Kind Poppy is a real store located in Tennessee and online. The products are vegan, cruelty free, and handmade by the owner. Yes, I’m online friends with the owner. No, she doesn’t have any idea I did this! Surprise! Love you, Autumn!

Harry opened his mouth to respond, only to become distracted by a conversation going on at a nearby table. “What about that Malfoy chap? Nice looking ain’t he?”
Author’s notes: attempted rape, violence, and verbal abuse. This one is incredibly heavy. Prepare yourselves.
“I hope so.” Sirius wanted to see his godson smile again. His sunny disposition had been stilted by him and Draco not seeing each other anymore.
“Remus,” Harry admitted. “Siri’s my godfather so I’ve always seen him as family. He had visitation rights when I was younger, and he saw me often. His presence made my home life less difficult. My aunt hated my mother and in turn she hated me. Her husband went along with her prejudice because he enjoys being cruel.”
“YOU ALL PROMISED ME HE’D BE SAFE!” Draco screamed. “THAT MONSTER HAS TAKEN HIM! HE’LL DO HORRIBLE THINGS TO HIM! HE MAY EVEN KILL HIM! IF HE DOES IT’S ON ALL OF YOU FOR COMING UP WITH THIS BONKERS PLAN IN THE FIRST PLACE!”
“Good morning, Mr. Malfoy,” greeted prosecutor Alex Cabot as Draco took the witness stand. Due to the high-profile nature of the crime and Draco’s public figure status, the trial was set up the following month after they rescued Harry. The American and British authorities had agreed to try Lockhart in London, and recruit an American prosecutor, defense attorney, and judge so that the process was as fair as possible. If convicted, Lockhart would be jailed in the United Kingdom. “Would you please tell the court what happened on February 22
Harry leaned in close, running his fingers over Draco’s cheeks and temples. “Kiss me, Harry. Please. I’ll let you know if I can’t handle something.” Harry complied, and gently kissed Draco.
“I love both of you. You’re the best family a guy could ask for,” Harry pulled away, kissed Luna’s cheek, and stepped back to where Hermione was waiting. She put an arm around him and gave him the tea.
“No, it certainly doesn’t,” Harry said loudly as he approached them. He then rounded on the second man. “The person you’re sitting here spewing garbage about is a real person, and he deserves more respect than that.” He then turns to the first guy. “Ditch this wanker. He is problematic at the very least and blatantly homophobic at most.”
Author’s Note: discussions of past abuse, violence, and sexual assault. Gilderoy Lockhart’s trial. And who better to try him than ADA Cabot and Judge Liz Donnelly?
“Our entire relationship, really,” Draco said proudly as he placed the mat in front of the front door. “I love you my Harry.”
“Where have you been staying?” Harry rasped as he sipped a ginger ale. He’d spent the better part of ten minutes cleaning the sink, brushing his teeth, and praying to the Gods and Goddesses that he didn’t get sick again.
“Surreal, but nice? What the fuck was that, Potter?” Harry cursed himself just as the doorbell rang again. He opened it to find Draco back.
“Dragon, look at me,” Harry took his face in his hands. “If you go there, he’ll be on his guard. He knows Charlie. He doesn’t know me. Doesn’t know anything about me. I can use that to my advantage. You deserve justice, and he deserves to be in prison. Let me help you get closure, my love.”
“Listen here, just who the fuck do you think you are? The morals police?” the second man retorted. Just as Harry was about to clap back, Draco walked over and stood beside him. The second man paled and the first one gasped.
Draco was tied to a chair the second he stepped into the grungy hotel room. Harry was naked, tied to the bed. His face was purple and swollen and he had at least one broken rib.
“Observant,” Remus sniped and glared at Sirius. Harry buried his face in his hands and counted to ten. This was going to be a
“Those are his twin brothers Fred and George. Riots the both of them! Dropped out of school shortly before graduation, started a comedy act, and now they’ve got their own television show. I may have pulled some strings for them there.”
“Objection!” Alex exclaimed. “Defense counsel’s personal feelings on Mr. Malfoy’s testimony are unnecessary and cruel!”
“Six months ago,” Draco admitted, his voice breaking again. Harry ran into the kitchen and retched in the sink.
“Gay and trans and they tossed me out. I’ve been living at a shelter ever since. I had a hell of a time finishing school,” Harry said sadly. “Getting into your amazing program was the thing that kept me going.”
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious is a Mary Poppins reference. Great movie! I am a huge fan of Julie Andrews!
“I didn’t at first. I was so jealous of the love Harry still feels for you,” Draco admitted as he led him into the living room and gave him a glass of Scotch. “But, I know now that the way he loves you isn’t romantic. That’s reserved for me alone.”
“Let’s get him to the hospital,” Hermione said softly as she untied Draco. Remus and Sirius were across the room helping Harry. Draco nodded and hurried over to Harry’s side.
“Gilderoy Lockhart you’re under arrest for the sexual harassment of five Julliard students, the rape of Draco Malfoy, the kidnapping, assault, and attempted rape of Harry Potter, stalking, menacing, and extortion. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one the court will appoint one to you. Do you understand these rights as I’ve read them to you?” Liv asked in a calm cool tone.
“Because that worked so well with Ron Weasley,” Harry rolled his eyes. “I’m beginning to think relationships, casual and serious, are obsolete and a waste of time. I’ve only ever been involved with two people. One of them wanted something very different from what I wanted. Once he realized it, he dumped me faster than you can say supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. And the other, whom I seriously should have known better than to get involved with, was fucking me while pining for you.”
“I’m sorry about the surreal but nice thing. You probably think I’m a dork now,” Harry smiled sheepishly.
“Come on Ted, I need some help kneading the pizza dough,” Hermione sat the little boy down and led him into the kitchen.
“I’m nervous. This will be my first role since everything happened,” Draco took a deep breath. “Would you both mind helping me run lines?”
“Mr. Malfoy,” the defense counsel started. “You say these things happened. You claim Mr. Lockhart was abusive and sexually assaulted you. Do you have anything other than your word to prove it?”
“Tut, tut, it’s not going to be that easy, you little slut,” Lockhart said with a cold laugh. “If you want your boy toy back and largely unscathed, you’ll do exactly what I tell you to.”
“Now we’re down to the last brownie,” Charlie said with an air of dramatic flair. “I propose a contest. Saddest life story wins.”
“You forgot to buy her one, didn’t you?” Draco said with mock scorn. “You’re a shite friend. I guess I can do damage control for you.” He walked over to his wine fridge and asked, “Does she prefer red or white wine?”
“Hey D, hey Emily, hey Ernie,” Harry greeted them with hugs and handshakes. “D, you’ll never ever guess who came here with me.” Dudley grinned as he spotted Draco helping Sirius clean up his gourmet mishaps.
“A lot of the students begin taking my classes as a form of liberation,” Lockhart said smoothly. “Let me guess you’re gay and your family rejected you?”
“I was so sure he didn’t know about Harry,” he gazed miserably at the photos Lockhart had in his office. Photos of him and Harry from the time they first met until the present.
“Very good, you’re up to speed. No doubt that American investigator guessed my motives. She’s too good,” Lockhart sneered. “I want half of your immense fortune. I’m going someplace where they’ll never be able to touch me. I’m going to text you an address. You come alone. When you get here, you’ll wire me the money, help me escape, and then you can have your
“Congratulations,” Remus pointed at the black diamond band on Draco’s finger. “I figured one of you would be popping the question soon. Have you set a date?”
“I have a son named Noah. He’s about Teddy’s age. I’ll bring him by to play sometime,” Olivia showed them a picture of a little boy with dark hair and dark eyes.
“He’s been planning to kidnap him ever since he moved back to London. Liv’s right,” Hermione passed Draco a journal. “He wants to disappear, and he wants to force you to help him do it.”
“You know your battery will continue to die unless you keep it charged. And don’t make me have the conversation with you about clothes washing again,” Harry said, exasperated. “Why the fuck are you wearing my wetsuit?”
“Hey guys! Guess what?” Luna and Rolf bounded into the room. Luna held out her left hand. “Rolf and I are getting married!” A chorus of hugs, shouts, claps, and calls of congratulations filled the room.
“Sirius is trying his hand at cooking again,” Remus rolled his eyes. “He’s making us all guinea fowl. And who is this?” Remus’s eyes widened as he took a good look at Draco. “Good Gods, you’re the spitting image of Draco Malfoy.”
“Mr. Potter?” a woman with an American accent asked. “I’m Dr. Olivia Benson. I’m a psychologist and private investigator. I’m looking for information about Gilderoy Lockhart. Is Draco Malfoy here?”
“I really can’t say the same,” Draco replied stiffly. “You come in here every week and try to steal stuff. It's disrespectful and thoughtless of you.” Draco then turned and walked towards the register.
Remus smirked. “It’s not my fault his chair was pulled out a smidgen too far. Or that he had to rush out of here with a bloody and possibly broken nose.

“I know you’re right, but it doesn’t make this maudlin feeling ease,” Harry stirred his straw in his drink. “Anyone up for a round of darts?”
“Because it’s like a second skin,” Rolf said as he tossed Harry his phone, turned on the House music television station, and began dancing. And twerking. And doing splits. Harry rolled his eyes and checked his phone. He had three missed calls from Draco and three texts. He rolled his eyes again as he began typing a message.
“He thinks you’re always going to pine for Remus,” Mione said to put off discussing the massive elephant in the room.
As Harry was walking back to the shop, he ran smack dab into someone, covering them in orange juice. “SHITE! Here, let me…” Harry began as he took out a tissue and began blotting the juice off of the man’s light green polo shirt.
When they pulled apart, Sirius smiled gently. “Draco sent his lawyer by yesterday. We’re continuing the adoption process.”
When Harry arrived at Draco’s house in Kensington, he was surprised to see a large group of people gathered in his living room. “Mr. Potter! Over here!” A man called as he walked towards him. “Draco said you’re interviewing him next. I’m his agent, Blaise Zabini.”
“Nice to see you again, Dudley. Nice to meet you Emily, Ernie,” Emily gave Dudley a look that could only be described as fangirlish, while Ernie smiled politely and went to make himself a drink.
“To see survivors get justice is its own reward,” Liv told him. She smiled fondly as the newlyweds wept tears of grief and joy, and held each other as close as they could without aggravating Harry’s injuries.
“I’ve heard Charlie and Harry talking about you. I’d much rather hear things about you from you rather than secondhand from someone else,” Hermione said gently. “As soon as Harry comes home, we’ll talk. Why don’t you get a bath or watch the telly while I fix us some lunch?”
“That’s wonderful. Everyone deserves to be able to live their lives authentically,” Draco nodded and smiled. “What else would you like to know about the movie?”
Draco Abraxas Malfoy did NOT like being ignored, intentionally or not. And there was no way in hell that he was going to let Potter get away with it. So he simply chased after the boy-who-was-about-to-regret-living. Yanking Harry to the side, he inwardly grinned at the boys gasp of surprise and the subtle heightening of color to his cheeks, that was before the eyebrows came down in a deep set furrow and his mouth twisted into a grimace. Potter glared at him like Draco had just told him he destroyed the sun and Draco had no idea why.
Potter grunted and slammed him into the block wall, held him there for a second while he stared at him in an appraising manner, then nodded.
Harry's smile faded, every part of his body suddenly completely aware of the man in front of him. Malfoy stared back, the pupils in his eyes flaring, his lips parting as Harry leaned in and kissed him without even realising he intended to...lips cool and pliant beneath his own, then warm tongue and mint as Malfoy opened up to him.
Malfoy ignored him, keeping his head down, his eyes partially obscured by the soft fall of pale hair. He really didn't look well.
His first instinct was to just leave: leave Potter; leave Grimmauld Place; leave England. But there would be no point. He'd had his part of the bargain and the Ministry would expect payment in full, or quite possibly quote breach of contract and throw him back into Azkaban. He was trapped, just as caged by situation as he'd been under Voldemort's deranged rule.
"I understand that, Mr Malfoy, but you really do require medical care. If you sign yourself out the Trust can't be held responsible if you take a turn for the worse. You shouldn't be by yourself."
"That stuff, as you so eloquently put it, keeps the wheels of power turning. Never underestimate it."
Draco agreed, thinking privately that there was only so much exposure he could stand to tangled black hair and the tingle of magic every time their fingers came into accidental contact. It was no good dwelling on things like that, not when an unplanned snog had caused Potter such distress.
"Obviously." He really did look guilty and Draco relented a little. "It was a shock to us both, Potter."
He took a gulp of tea, scalded his tongue, tried not to care that his hands were shaking as he set the mug down.
"What? Yes, whatever you want." Harry was struggling to catch up; his body just wanted to carry on kissing Malfoy, but it seemed that was off the cards. "I'll clear this up." He added lamely.
Pushing himself to his feet, Harry strode after him, remembering to walk with a ponderous gait and fervently wishing that the legs of his disguise were as long as his real ones. Malfoy drew steadily further ahead, until the path twisted and turned through some bushes and he disappeared from sight. By the time Harry got to other side of the leafy screen, the arch-enemy of his school years was gone. He dashed through a wrought iron gate onto the street, cursing, only to be brought to an abrupt standstill by the harsh blatter of a big motorcycle. Malfoy swept past him, curled over the handlebars so he appeared as one with the machine. He rode like he flew, thought Harry, full of arrogance and natural grace and thumbing his nose at the world.
Severus Snape was indeed expecting Draco. A chair had been thoughtfully placed before his portrait and the man himself stood within his frame behind a similar chair, robes cast over one shoulder and an austere expression on his face.
Malfoy lowered himself into Harry's chair and dropped his head against the backrest, his long legs sprawling before him, the hint of lean muscle and the outline of his knees beneath the denim of his jeans absurdly attractive.
"It does if the supply is being poisoned by a rival supplier. A bad reputation travels fast whether you're legal or illegal. Customers soon find another source."
Too close to cast, Draco twisted and punched Romani in the face with all his strength. The wizard fell backwards to the floor, kicking out and causing Draco to stagger in Potter's direction, then Romani rolled and came up to his feet with blue lightning streaking from his wand. Draco raised his hand to cast another "Protego" over Potter, realised it was too late and with no idea why he did it, stepped in front of the curse. It hit him between the shoulder blades with an icy thud similar to being struck by a giant snowball.
"I'll do my best," said Harry in an even tone. "You're not asking me to lay off your friends and family then?"
He must have dozed because it seemed to be only seconds later that someone touched his forearm and gave it a little shake. Draco flinched, scooting further into his corner before he could stop himself.
"The landlord, he's got another five warehouses. So, maybe more than one is being used by Romani? Oh, and Hermione is joining us to serve the warrants."
"Let's go home," he said quietly, wondering vaguely why Grimmauld Place seemed more like a home if Malfoy was going with him, even if it was on a strictly temporary basis.
"He's angry, Harry. It will take him a while to accept that Malfoy is working alongside the Aurors, with you in particular. The damage done by the Malfoys is very personal to the Weasleys, but if it helps save innocent lives, I'm sure he'll come around. Just give him some space."
"No," Harry agreed, declining to mention the reason for his nocturnal wanderings. Besides, he thought, it wasn't really an untruth; Merlin knows he'd spent enough nights plagued by nightmares, before, during and after the war.
"Weasley has been to see me. He says you disapparated out of the gym. According to him you were solely responsible for destroying the wards last night. Is that true?"
He side-stepped quickly and thrust his hands into his pockets as he surveyed the wreckage strewn across the room.
Draco let himself out into the back garden at Grimmauld Place. A combination of high walls and magical shields kept out most of the noise and pollution of London, creating a tranquil oasis that basked in the warmth of the afternoon sunlight.
Harry trailed after the other man as he made his way slowly up the stairs, wishing he could just use a levitation charm when he saw how much Malfoy's legs were shaking. The magic of Grimmauld Place murmured around them, strong suggestions of sympathy and frustration in its tone.
"No." Harry protested. "It's not that. They won't all like it, but they'll get used to the idea...it might take a while, but they will."
"I'm going to come in you," Harry agreed. "I'm going to fill you up and you're going to come so hard and I'm never letting anyone else touch you again."
When he opened them, Malfoy smirked at him and flexed his hips tantalisingly before raising one of his legs over Harry's shoulder and guiding Harry to his entrance. Harry whined helplessly, his hips moving of their own accord as the urge to mate with the man beneath him became overwhelming. He forced his way slowly into the ring of hot muscle, then deeper through further resistance until he was fully sheathed and Malfoy's lips were parted, a pink flush on his cheeks and his cock hard and weeping between them.
"Then he let that psychopathic narcissist move into the Manor and I realised he only loved himself."
Ahead of him lay one of the civic buildings that were common in that area of the city. It was closed for the night and shrouded in darkness apart from the artfully angled pools of light that illuminated fancy curlicues of stone and pillars carved in the style of Ancient Greece. The shadows that lay between and behind the pillars were dense and it was to these that Draco headed. If he could reach the far side of the building, it would be possible to cut across the dark swathe of grass that lay at its rear, scale a low wall and lose his pursuers in the rabbit warren of streets beyond.
Draco moaned, balls drawing up in anticipation. His magic surged in response and suddenly Potter was naked, his clothes in a heap on the floor and his eyes huge with surprise as a startled sound burst from his lips.
"So," Harry concluded, "Ranworth, the priority for you and Briggs is finding O'Keefe, Yoki and Romani. Start by tracking down their known associates and so on; Malfoy here will be able to give you some pointers there. Ron and myself will concentrate on the ex-Hogwarts' students, Crowfoot, Dangelos and Smithson."
The other man's thoughts on the matter remained unknown, as the Floo roared into life and spat out Ron and Hermione, wands drawn.
He waited patiently, his stance open and welcoming as Malfoy leaned in and pressed a ghost of a kiss against Harry's lips, its tentative nature making it clear it was a request for permission. Even that soft touch of cool lips was enough to send Harry's blood rushing south and he was more than ready when Malfoy closed the remaining gap between them, fastened his hands on Harry's hips and kissed him again.
"You don't think I've really changed, not deep down." His tone made it clear that it wasn't a question. "I assure you Potter, that boy from Hogwarts ceased to exist a long time ago."
Draco followed Potter inside, amazed at what the prankstershad accomplished. Complete and utter Chaos. Yet the chaos had a sense of carefree wonder to it. In front of him were racks and racks of products and tables all over with stuff like 'Peruvian Darkness powders ', 'Extendable Ears', 'Portable Swamps', 'Weasleys Sick Snack Packs', Draco simply didn't know where to begin. He didn't realize how talented the Weasley twins were, creating all this on their own. Potter quietly led him over to a shelf labeled "Extendable Ears" and grabbed a pair. Then he dropped it on the ground. although instead of hitting the ground. It just.. Disappeared. Draco gave Potter a dumbfounded look and the boy just smirked.
"I introduced Hermione to Pansy and we were talking about Quidditch, our classes, and our plans for after school. Nice jacket by the way.. Did you just buy it?" Blaise asked with a twitching smile and a knowing look in his eye. Draco paled a little bit and considered his words carefully.
"I am not the one who insisted on holding my hand halfway through Hogsmead! And don't worry, I will do my best to keep my hands off you."
When they arrived at Hogwarts, they paused at the Great Hall. Everyone else was already in there, eating. Harry didn't especially feel like making a bigger scene so he unlooped his arm from Draco's and strode into the Great Hall, he could see Draco glance at the Slytherin table, probably to see of Blaise was there, before he followed Harry to the Gryffindor table where Hermione, Blaise, Ron and Luna were all waiting for them.
Harry let out a sigh, one thats supposed to let everyone know just how annoyed you were. But Draco didn't buy it.
"Hungry?" Harry asked mildly, observing Malfoy in his peripheral vision while keeping purposefully turned partially away, guessing the other man was in considerably more pain than he was letting on.
"Malfoy didn't do anything," repeated Harry in a cold voice. "Do you really think I can't protect myself against a Malfoy?"
It was strangely peaceful, sitting on the bench in the dappled shade, feet planted firmly on the floor in front of him and an inoffensive expression on the pugnacious face that was not his own. I'm hiding in plain sight, thought Harry with a little huff of amusement, his glamoured fingers curled squat and hairy on the muggle newspaper resting on his lap and his memories winding back to countless daring exploits when he was anything but in plain sight, unseen beneath his invisibility cloak back in the days of Hogwarts and Voldemort.
"Draco," he whispered, "Draco," and Draco came again, moaning as the room went white and silent as he arched into Potter's embrace.
"Hermione says that...I didn't believe her at first...mostly I still don't. I can't stop thinking I should have been able to do more..."
Potter didn't look too sure about the situation, chewing at his bottom lip again, which for some reason made Draco feel slightly breathless and overly warm.
The words were without heat as Ron's anger faded away, replaced by a weariness that Harry hadn't seen since the Forest of Dean.
Draco paced across the room, almost frantic in his desire to regain some control over the situation. He had no choice but to continue with the Ministry deal. Potter, on the other hand...the attraction couldn't be denied, but whether or not to continue to act on it in this tiny span of time they had together was his choice.
Any further soul searching was prevented by a sharp tap at the window. A Ministry owl sidled through the opening and dropped rather heavily onto the bed. It held out its leg in Harry's direction and allowed him to carefully detach the small roll of parchment.
"Nothing major," she assured him. "But it's better to have everything written down; there's less room for legal manoeuvres later, if someone decides to make things difficult."
"It seems I'm not in a very good position," noted Draco. "The Ministry wants to withdraw their deal. I need to come up with something concrete."
"Malfoy, Draco Malfoy," he said, his tone heavy with dislike. "I never thought the day would come when you were in my office."
They apparated straight to Grimmauld Place, setting off a shock wave of concern that rippled through the house and served to increase Harry's anxiety ten-fold.
"I know." Harry clapped him on the back, gave him a brief one-armed hug. "Let's get back to Hermione; she looks really upset."
"So what is this to you?" he asked quietly, gesturing between them. "It's fairly obvious we want to shag each other, but you don't even trust me not to curse you...so is that all it is? A meaningless shag?"
"After Azkaban," offered Malfoy slowly. "I couldn't visit Diagon Alley, but I found someone who was willing to sell me some supplies."
Draco considered transfiguring a visitor's chair into something kinder to the posterior, but decided the risk of his magic getting out of control in the vicinity of aurors was too high. To use the Weasel's chair would probably fall into the category of antagonistic, so he sat carefully on the edge of a rickety visitor's chair.
Potter already had one of his assailants immobilised and floating in mid-air and it was as he turned away to fling "Incarcerous" at the witch that another figure popped into sight on the right, at the periphery of Draco's vision. He swung his head over his shoulder, identified a furious-looking Romani and hurled an impressively solid "Protego" over Potter at the same time as Romani shouted something unintelligible and a jet of lurid purple streaked out of his wand and towards Potter.
He stood on the bluestone blocks of the spiral path, a sea of wild flowers around him, and concentrated on breathing past the lump of panic that constricted his throat. As if things hadn't been bad enough already; now he had uncontrollable wandless magic and he'd positively thrown himself at Potter, who had inexplicably kissed him and then undeniably come to his senses and retreated in horror when he'd realised he was not only snogging a Death Eater, but the despised Draco Malfoy no less.
"Any Slytherin would know that about fifteen years ago the potions departments in Durmstrang and Hogwarts went head to head in an international potions competition. Hogwarts won of course, but for some of the parties involved the intense rivalry never died."
Malfoy's cock fell free as his legs gave out and he dropped to his backside, knees either side of Harry's torso. His mouth sought and found Harry's with soft kisses as aftershocks rocked them both.
"You realise he's been through an ordeal. It may take a while longer for him to recover in other ways."
He studied Harry's expression for a moment, then added, "I read the labels. I'm familiar with the pharmaceutical ingredients; I've had to do a fair bit of research over the last few years."
Draco decided not to ask; it wasn't as though he'd have any say in the matter anyway. Sex and unfortunate feelings aside, he was still essentially in Potter's custody until such time as the Ministry was done with him. With this in mind, he drew on a lifetime of practice and assumed a politely disinterested expression as he shrugged on his leather jacket. The weight of it settling across his shoulders grounded him and he stepped resolutely towards the Floo, the soles of his dragon-hide boots firm against the parquet floor.
Some awareness between them had started to change long before sectumsempra and fiendfyre, but it had faded into the background compared to the ever darkening maelstrom created by Voldemort, had become buried in the intervening years until the day Potter had more or less abducted him from Regent's Park.
Potter's intense green eyes studied him from the other side of the car. He had a familiar crease in his forehead, the one that said he was concerned, although Draco wasn't sure why he knew this to be the case.
He returned to the bedroom, knowing he was running away but unable to stop himself. After pacing around for a while, he sat on the bed, elbows on knees and one hand over his face. It had to be Potter, he thought bitterly, the last person he wanted to know how weak he was; it was the ultimate humiliation.
"I got your patronus about the same time a message came through about a blast at The Hag's Skeleton."
She was, as always, right. Shortly afterwards she took her leave, hugging Harry and running a pensive eye over Malfoy's slumped figure.
Some time later, debrief over, Harry thanked everyone for their hard work and summoned his notes, shrinking them with a flick of his wand. Ron had hung back when the others departed and they walked out of the briefing room together.
Under cover of the babble of comments from the fast-growing crowd, Draco leaned closer to the dark hair and murmured, "Contribute his expertise? Why, Potter, I believe you're not as verbally challenged as I thought."
Draco pretended to ignore him. He pulled a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and lit up, keeping it casual, hoping the smoke would steady his nerves and that his hand wasn't shaking too noticeably.
Harry nodded and hurried to comply, returning to the room in record time to find Malfoy lying in a pristine bed, tucked around with pillows and blankets and with a pale pink flush on his cheekbones.
Then Potter's mouth was on his neck, tongue and teeth licking and nipping as he pushed Draco against the wall. Draco arched against him, breathless with wanting, hard already against the zip of his trousers and the muscle of Potter's thigh.
The room was dim and quiet but for the sound of the birds' dawn chorus. Oddly comforted by the feel of Malfoy's hand in his own, Harry's head began to nod and it wasn't long before exhaustion pulled him down into fitful dreams.
"As well as can be expected. His physical injuries should heal completely within the next week, but he must take it easy." Madam Pomfrey regarded him sternly. "I must insist on bed rest for at least two days."
He was still flushed and off-balance. Draco smirked weakly at him, enjoying the spectacle; in fact it was probably the high point of his day, although he wasn't quite sure why.
"Because it really is ok if you are, I get what it's like to feel like you have to hide who you are from the world." Harry's words were rushed this time. He was trying to reassure Draco. Draco was touched but at the same time he couldn't believe he let another person kn- wait. Just wait.
She stopped and swung around so fast that Draco almost crashed into her. She had a grim scary look on her face.
"Ask Madame Pince for another copy." Potter said dismissively, moving to walk around Draco but the stupid git blocked his way.
Stepping inside the building, he saw an odd blend of a muggle coffee shop and a wizarding one. There was furniture everywhere and the whole place had a very homely vibe. It kind of reminded Ron of his home, full of activity and heavenly smells.
"Alright." Blaise said softly, focusing his gaze on Hermione. harry rolled his eyes. As much as he appreciated the fact his friend was happy, he didn't know how much... Gooeyness he could handle.
After a few minutes of awkward silence, Draco decided he may as well make the most of it and spoke to Harry.
He wasn't sure if she was psychic or what but she read people so accurately he wouldn't be suprised.
Harry smiled at her, she really was quite the friend, even when she was being a bit bookish, which was all the time if he were being perfectly honest.
And then there was the nightmares. They never stopped. The moment he closed his eyes, they took over his mind. The faces. Always the faces. They always came, one after the other. Its your fault. Its your fault. Its your fault.
"Malfoy, I love holding your hand, don't get me wrong, but can you please tell me where we are going?" Harry asked, his voice simply dripping sarcasm. Malfoy, immediately dropped Harry's hand as if he burned him which didn't suprise Harry at all. But then Malfoy stopped so suddenly and turned around that Harry crashed into him, sending him sprawling into a pile of leaves  with Harry landing on top of him with a muted Thump.
If you asked Harry, it was fun as hell. Sure they weren't exactly in time with each other or the song and they occasionally stepped on each others toes but it was fun to be just goofing off. Draco had some interesting conmentary about Harry's rhythm and Harry had some about his two left feet. Fair is fair. But with a little practice, Harry was sure they'd get it down, maybe they wouldn't be the best dancers, but good enough people wouldn't laugh at them.
"You guys look rather out of breath, were you running from the nargles?" Harry bit back a smile and deadpanned at her. " Yes, we barely escaped. I see one next to your head. Watch out, their coming for you. " Luna smiled and rolled her eyes sympathetically, it wasn't her fault they weren't educated in mystical magical creatures. But their jokes really were quite funny sometimes.
He'd been a huge ass to him when he could have been helping him. He didn't want to care but Potter wormed his way into Draco's small world of friends and dug his claws in like an annoying Kneazle.
Harry studied Draco some more. Maybe he was thinking. Or maybe he just liked looking at the blonde man across from him. Honestly Harry couldn't tell, and didn't really care.
He was so lost in thought as he was walking that he stopped paying attention to where he was going amd his surroundings. Crashes were bound to happen.
He had thought too quickly. The second he walked into Three Broomsticks with Potter hot on his heals, he saw three people he absolutely did NOT want to see. Blaise, Pansy, and Granger. Who of course saw them the second they came in. Granger stood up and ran over to Har- Potter, the two whispering to each other in a very animated conversation. He couldn't quite catch what they were talking about but he could care less as he walked over to Blaise and Pansy. The former watching Granger with admiration.
Her gaze shot up and she grinned and scooted over, patting the spot where she was. Harry figured that was a yes and sat down beside her. Leaning his head back, he studied the ceiling of the dorm, wondering what Draco was doing. Was Draco thinking about him? Did he hate him..
When they finally reached the Slytherin commons, Harry realized he  didn't actually know the password. Malfoy was half asleep so..he wasn't going to be helping him. Sighing in defeat, Harry looked around for someone, anyone who could help. Luckily enough, the commons door opened to reveal Pansy. Pausing when she saw them and slowly took the scene in- how Malfoy was basically asleep on Harry who was struggling to support him. She rolled her eyes at Malfoy's sorry state and silently walked forward to help Harry move the drunk into the common room. When they plopped him down on a green velvet couch, Harry turned to leave the room, not wanting to intrude. Pansy didn't even look his way as he left so he took that as encouragement. As the Slytherin commons door closed, he heard a quiet "thank you" slip through the doors.
"You should have seen your face Potter!! You look horrified! Haven't you ever been caught snogging before?"
Harry was pissed. He wasn't quite sure why he was pissed but he was practically bursting at the seams. He strode angrily for the Gryffindor common room, shouting the password at the druken
Honestly Harry Potter must have cast a spell on him. Maybe Imperio? Because theres no way he wanted to be thinking about him. There had to be a good reason, maybe he was just thinking about the ball. That would definitely be worrisome later on.
To say Draco Malfoy was a bit of a mess was an understatement. There he was, getting support from Harry freaking Potter, and all Draco could do was think about brushing the hair out of Harry's eyes.
"Luna, I know I've been a bit of a jerk to you in the past but would you like to go to the ball with me? When the time comes that is." He finished rather awkwardly.  Luna looked rather suprised but a pleasant, dreamy smile came across her face.
When the spell was finished, Blaise and Hermione stood up to leave, the latter waving her wand and levitating a stunned Harry behind her. When they reached the Gryffindor dormitories, Blaise knew better then to ask if she wanted him to stay and help watch Harry. Hermione was an excellent wish and she'd take offence to that. Instead, he kissed her softly on her cheek and the top of her head. "Be careful, please." He whispered, planting one last kiss on her lips before he pulled away and walked down the Slytherin dormitories.
One has to be greatful for what they have. Friends.. family.. chicken.. there is important things that deserved to be honored above all. Besides, if it didn't have to do anything with Ron directly, certainly there were better topics to get himself involved in.
She could see that Harry and Malfoy were getting closer by the day but she was worried that Harry was going to get hurt. He tended to be a bit oblivious when it comes to peoples feelings and she didn't want him to accidentally push too far. She just felt super protective of her best friend. When she had brought up the concern with Blaise, he just nodded and agreed with her. He saw it too but there was really nothing that they could do about it.
"I just wasn't sure if you wanted people to see us, ok?! I'm sorry that I have so much less experience then you." Harry snapped, his embarrassment quickly turning to anger.
"I know I don't have any business liking you. I've been horrible to you my whole life. During the war we almost died because of how badly I screwed up. But this is our last year at Hogwarts. I want to do something that matters. I want to be someone who matters. And I guess I just started looking at you differently. I don't know. This is stupid, I'm stupid, I'll just g-" Draco was cut off by a mouth rushing to meet his.
I want to run my hands through it. Harry shook his head quickly dismissing the thought. Draco straightened, as much as he could considering how intoxicated he was.
Swallowing hard he tried again. "Hi, my name is Ron and I want to set up an appointment for counseling?" He tried to phrase it formally but his raspy voice and slight nervous made him sound way more aggressive then he'd like.
Harry waltzed over to the table and plopped down, uncharacteristically flamboyant and loud. Draco moved to sit down across from him but stopped when Harry didn't let go of his hand. Instead, he was pulled down on the bench beside him. Harry Potter was grinning like he didn't have a care in the world as he grabbed a handful of grapes to eat. Draco rolled his eyes and grabbed a shiny green apple. What a dork.
They hadn't been kissing long when they heard someone clear their throat. Snapping apart, both boys flushed when they realized who had interrupted them. It was no one other then their very own Head Mistress, Minerva McGonagall. And Horace Slughorn. Both of whom were smiling quite widely. There goes the secret of their newfound thing.
Draco started a little. Yet another thing he hadn't considered much. To date Harry, he'd have to come out. Or ask Harry to date him in secret. Which really wouldn't be fair to eother of them.
When Potter showed up in the dungeons looking for Draco, Draco was tempted to leave him hanging. He was furious that Potter seemed to think him a yo-yo. But, Potter was still his partner for the Samhain Ball so..
When there was no longer pressing need to be the choosen ones best friend, saviour of the wizarding world, Ron just lost his motivation. He didn't do much, he couldn't do much. Days and weeks blurred by in a mind numbing march. Ron didn't want to play quidditch or act like everything was fine. He lost his brother. Nothing was fine. And it never would be. Life had lost the subtle joy it always held. There was no excitement and no adventure. Ron would be ok with never going on an adventure again.
McGonagall raised her hand to silence him. Her face had completely lost its smile and her lips were pursed rather tightly.
"Thanks for making me feel guilty," Potter snaps "I was going to- I haven't been- I thought it might help- Ugh. But I think you need it more than I do."
Harry stared at him for a few seconds, trying to figure out how to breach the topic of.. last night.
Crookshanks had spent hours finding the perfect rabbit, its body was lush and he could tell by the tang of blood that the rabbit meat would be almost perfect. He was very proud of this catch, it wasn't often that Crookshanks tried to catch live food. It was no secret living inside had made him fat and lazy.
Harry and Draco just went back to eating and promptly ignored eachother and the rest of the meal passed in tense silence. Blaise stood up suddenly, grabbing Hermione's hand.
He could act! Pretend like hes definitely straight and get everyone's attention on him and his soon to be girlfriend! No one would ever think he was gay then. He would be safe until they graduate which is when he could kindly tell who ever it is that he isn't interested.
"Give me the book." He demanded , holding his hands out expectantly. Trying ever so hard not to blush given what he was asking for.
"Harry would you lik-" but she never got the chance to finish before Malfoy chose that moment to insert his input.
"Harry you are showing all the side affects of someone who was previously under the imperious curse as well as some of those of one recently under a legilimes. We need to find McGonagal immediately, we can't just ignore this." She explained as she grabbed his arm and pulled him away, throwing a glance back to her boyfriend who quickly got up and followed, leaving their picnic behind and grabbing Harry's other arm.
The two walked throughout the castle well past lunch time, coming up with new excuses for why they shouldn't part. They were in their own blissful bubble of newfound love. Content to hold hands but secretly dying for more. They never noticed absolutely anyone they passed, even a certain long haired Weasley girl who was searching for Harry in hopes of finally having that talk with him. When Ginny saw them pass, she quickly realized she once again missed her chance and felt her face turn as red as her hair.
Harry had been shocked honestly. He wasn't actually suprised that Draco liked him or anything. He was shocked that he SAID something. Harry was just trying to process what to do or say when Draco started to make excuses and get up. Harry had to act fast and say something but he didn't know what. So. He grabbed Draco and just acted.
Three days later, Beauxbatons, Durmstrang and llivermony arrived. The Beauxbaton girls (and there were a couple boys this time) were as beautiful and graceful as ever, their walk seeming more like they were floating then actually touching the ground. They went and sat gracefully at the Ravenclaw table. Madame Maxime went straight over to Hagrid and planted a big kiss on his lips, turning his ruddy face red with embarrassment at the affection, and the wolf-whistling and applause that followed.
"Hey, uh Harry? Do you want to practice? Dancing? With.. Me? I know you were already practicing but since we are going together I thought it'd be a good idea not to make a fool of ourselves" Draco stated, trying to come across nonchalant and cool but sounding more awkward then not caring.
Potter stills and eyes him intently. He gives a tiny nod as though he doesn't really want Draco to see it.
