But, evidently, they were teaching it at Hogwarts now. And Lyra learned it all from a professor, reading it in her textbook, discussing it with her class.
didn't usually, not really, but when I could catch him,
"I wasn't going to ask her myself. I was only wondering if she said something to you. I need a fucking clue."
And Harry made his decision — because Draco was right too. Harry needed to kiss a bloke tonight, and he needed to be happy. And Harry was pretty sure he knew just how to make it happen.
Draco squeezed his fingers over his eyes. "Because we're his family. I basically told him he wouldn't understand."
Draco froze. "Of course, I know you. Merlin, Harry, breathe. I'm not fucking leaving you."
Harry raised his eyebrows in question, waiting.
"So I'm told."
An airy, feminine voice answered back. "Yes, he's fine. That bowl was attracting blibberpinks anyway, and they are terrible for creative activity."
Alex nodded, but wrapped one arm tightly around Draco's shoulder and put his other thumb in his mouth.
"Lyra, love, Daddy got hurt at work."
"He was furious, claiming he'd disown me."
"It's an adjustment to all of you, especially her." Molly's quiet movements, the clank of the spoon on the metal bowl, the chopping of the knife on the wooden cutting board; it all served to put Draco into a fog. He listened as she spoke, but he wasn't sure how much he actually took in. "...something to consider."
"I know. I think she'll be okay, but it's definitely messed her up a bit."
"That he makes you happy? It's clear he does, Harry. He seems to understand what you need like the rest of us only wish we could. I mean, Ron and I understand what you're feeling a good deal of the time, but we never manage to pull you out of it. But Draco, he seems to do it every time." She took a sip of her wine and smiled sadly. "And since you've become friends, it's like you're
"How long is he taking?" Helen asked.
"Well, I mean, twenty years of therapy has to count for something, right?" Harry pulled Draco to his side as they hesitated before the door, and he wrapped his arms around him. "It's good to be home, though."
Harry, for his part, watched the proceedings with sad eyes that occasionally looked glassy, as if he were holding in tears. And the sadder Harry looked, the angrier Lyra seemed to get. Which in turn, made Harry look worse.
nervous."
And I hate myself for it, hate knowing that I had any part in this. Knowing that I was upstairs, in a normal kids' room with toys and a bed and everything I ever asked for. And Harry lived with this."
Simon always told me that when you feel too much, you should try to pull it apart into individual emotions. So, I found a little park near the stadium and sat on a bench, running through everything that had just happened, sifting through all the feelings spinning in my body, trying to make sense of it all.
It was almost an hour later as he stepped from the shower when he heard it. He froze, unsure what the sound was, but when there was nothing, he reached for his towel.
"Lyra has been staying with Molly mostly, but Angelina is with her at the house tonight."
"Merlin, help me," Draco said under his breath, then he let out a long-suffering sigh. "Harry, you've had a fucking horrible adolescence. People have been forcing you into a mould your entire life. It's not surprising you're having a difficult time finding your way out of it. There's no timetable on when you have to figure this out. If it's now, great. If it's later, great. As long as you are doing what makes you happy, it doesn't matter. And the only people you'd be letting down are the people who don't fucking matter, because anyone who cares about you will be happy for you, understand?"
Luna squeezed his hand and turned to the rest of the carriage. "Exploding Snap anyone?"
"Same, definitely," he said with a laugh. "I have no idea how parents give up their kids that long every year. I think I'll have to talk my kids into the doing the day student option when they finally go."
"Oh," Harry said quietly, his pulse quickening at the thought of that. "But I thought… Er, I mean, most of us already knew you liked blokes. You weren't exactly hiding it last term."
When Draco's lips brushed lightly across Harry's, Harry's mind momentarily froze in place, sure this was all some fever-dream, the absurdity of the situation overwhelming him. And then Draco moved, and it all dissolved into feeling.
Hermione was right. Draco made him happy. How could he not? This pure-blood idiot who'd bucked off the yoke of his parents' expectations, who'd told them all to fuck off, that he'd be who he wanted to be despite his upbringing.
"You okay?" Draco called out.
I wanted to be somebody that could see the joy in life, who could appreciate a thunderstorm as well as a sunrise. I decided I wanted to be a person who could look at the good in things and find hope in tomorrow.
Wow, he's finally adopted. He doesn't feel different though, and he thought he might. He still feels like him. Like, just Alex. And they're his family. He guesses the whole adoption thing isn't really all that important anyway.
"Yeah," Teddy agreed. "Yeah, just let me see him."
Draco took the scroll from Otus's legs and opened it.
Harry dropped a kiss on Draco's forehead, and Draco felt his chest swell, but sincerely hoped that Hermione hadn't noticed that bit of sentimentality. They'd become close and all, but he still had a reputation to maintain.
Harry smiled. The man sounded posh, which he supposed made sense. Arranging flowers all day did seem the type of thing that would take a special type of person. It wasn't like Neville, working in the greenhouses. It was more…artsy…Harry decided.
What was he going to do? How was he going to get this child to relax enough to give up the memory that could save Harry's life? That would save Draco's life by saving Harry's? That would bring home Lyra's daddy?
She pushed herself through the milling students until she arrived at her destination, and Dad reached for her, pulling her into his arms. She stiffened.
"Anyway, Harry told him stories and took care of him, despite getting sicker, and promised he'd introduce him to his Draco and Lyra when they were safe."
He nodded. "The healing potions will do that. What was wrong with him?"
"Ron will take care of her," Harry said quietly. "So now what?" He met Draco's eyes, and Draco could see the yearning in Harry's green depths.
He nodded then ran to the Floo.
Harry was following the conversation, and his eyes saddened as he stared at Alex.
cartoon when he starts yelling like that?
A/N: If you read
He checked his watch — twenty-five minutes left before he should be back in the office — and hurried his steps to the shop.
It was funny because Harry always told people that Teddy was the inspiration for Amil in the stories. But Amil was Harry; not because he was a war hero — even though he was — and not because he wrote wonderful children's stories that inspired a generation, but because Harry, even in his darkest moments, tried to be better. Tried to hope for something more.
I could hear the smile in his voice. I think that's one of the things I liked best about the Draco of my adulthood. It was like all the empathy he'd lacked as a child had simply built up, waiting to be used now. And he refused to hide it, to put on a stoic face like he'd been taught as a child. Instead, he embraced it.
"This is his cousin. Dudley."
. Harry made him lunch and they were going to have a picnic.
for the first time since I've known you. Like you're finally comfortable in your own skin."
Draco was still watching me like he was waiting for some kind of reaction. But the blood rushing through my ears only let one thing sink in: Draco was not back with Gathii.
He sat down next to me in the chair we'd both long ago accepted was his, and he didn't say a word. He just let me sit, listening to the rustling branches, lost in my thoughts.
He took a sip of his wine, then turned so he was facing Harry, meeting the green eyes he knew so well.
"They have him under a Stasis Charm so it can't do any more damage while they figure out what the curse is and how to counter it." She waited until Draco looked up into her face. "We'll figure it out, Draco. We're tracking down leads, and we're going through the brother's house to see if we can find any reference to spells that could do something like this."
"Early mornings or late nights?" Draco changed the questioning again.
Alex relaxed a little. "Grandma Molly."
Draco nibbled on the asparagus and grinned. "I guess I win, then. Awesome food
Draco wanted to tell him to stop, that he didn't want to hear anymore, but he knew he was on the precipice of finally discovering the bigger picture of Harry. So instead of answering, he only nodded and hoped it'd encourage the other man to keep talking.
The best part of Harry's new room, in his opinion, was the fluffy, dark blue rug he'd bought to cover the floor. It kept his feet warm from the chill of the castle stones, and a slight cushioning charm made it the perfect place to relax with his friends.
"I was so mad at you," she said, crying openly.
"Watch your tone, young man," Draco admonished, trying to distract the boy.
She looked tired, and she looked determined. But she didn't look sad, which helped more than Draco could possibly say. She nodded to the boy, and Draco could see the child had laid his head down next to Harry's hand and was falling asleep.
Alex.
"This looks wonderful. Where's Harry's?"
Someone tell Draco I don't care about the bloody public
Draco watched Lyra dash from her room in her best dress, eager to see Harry. She chattered to Alex, who was wearing a fresh set of clothes passed on from one of the many Weasley grandchildren, his little trousers sagging in the bum. He held Lyra's hand and just let her talk.
He closed his eyes and let his head fall back onto the cushion. "I don't know what I'm doing." He hesitated, but something in him made him keep talking. "Just a few days ago, everything was normal, but then I said some things to Harry that really hurt him, and then this all happened. I feel like I've been acting on instinct ever since, just trying to keep moving and get through."
—and arguments over where to sleep.
Draco watched his daughter pull him into the kitchen where Hermione was waiting with the boy, then she wrapped her arm around Alex's shoulder and started talking about the family.
That's why his absence was so difficult. He was such an intricate part of every facet of my life. Even my work, my stories, revolved around an iteration of him that would forever be eight years old.
"I think her name was Dory, but yes. I really like that one. Alex was watching it yesterday."
He sat up, barely noticing Draco's concerned look as he moved out of the way. "Wait, what? Say that again?"
JanieOhio - I
"More than once, and she meant it." He turned his head and finally looked at Draco, his eyes serious and resigned. "Dudley said she wasn't coming back to the house. Didn't want to leave her beloved dogs that long, so at least we won't have to deal with her."
"Apologies for the delay," the man said, rushing through the door. "How can I help you?"
"Know
"Boscombe. Beautiful, isn't it?" Hermione's hair was blowing in the evening breeze, and she was glowing with happiness. I put my arm around her, determined to push my lousy mood away for her sake.
That's because Michelle is a lovely person and knows what she's talking about.
"Are you okay?" Draco asked, turning and placing his hand on Harry's back.
It was Monday afternoon, and Harry was in hospital. He was okay.
And whether he dreamt of a little boy in a cupboard or a man holding him in the night, he couldn't remember. He only knew he dreamt of Harry.
Draco let out a choke of a laugh through the tears in his throat. "Yeah, he was always good at that."
"But… how…?"
The nights passed in a blur of nightmares, and not just Alex's, which understandably continued with cries for his parents who would never come. Draco spent the first few nights handling those while Harry continued to recover, but when Draco woke on the fourth night and found the other side of his bed vacant, he crept down the hallway to find Harry in the old rocking chair they'd moved into Alex's room, holding the child and singing softly.
“I am merely suggesting you set a good example and get a date for the ball!”
"Don't be. It only matters to the ridiculous pure-bloods he and my mother socialise with. It doesn't matter to anyone else, certainly not me."
"What's wrong with my clothes?"
They were just little stories.
He was there throughout training, constantly paired up with me in practice, which morphed naturally into our studying together. We complemented one another and when one of us needed help, the other was there.
"Why don't you tell me how you really feel," Draco interrupted, his stomach twisting. He loved bickering with Harry but hated real fights. And this felt real.
"Come on. It's freezing out here. Let's go inside," I said, then stopped, confused. "Hold on, why didn't you wait inside? You could have just Floo-ed in."
Draco leaned over as Susan began singing some song Harry didn't recognise about finding love in all the wrong places, and he laughed. "I'm going to sing something."
He kept hold of her hand and walked her to the sofa in the sitting room, which Molly had mercifully cleared of the other children. Draco could hear them upstairs giggling.
"But—"
"Start small? What's that supposed to mean? Like what?"
"And leave your phone here," he added before she escaped, knowing that was the only real punishment that seemed to make a difference these days.
"Oh Gods," he let out, a sob escaping him.
, turned around and used it back on him.
A young woman took Dudley's arm. She looked sweet, her dark hair cascading over her pale shoulders and her dark blue dress falling to her knees. "Harry, Draco, this is Susanne. Susanne, this is my cousin Harry I've told you about, and his boyfriend, Draco."
Draco narrowed his eyes, but he walked over to the kitchen table and leaned against it. "It was incredibly rude; you are correct."
"What?"
"So, you're going to let it eat you up inside instead of going to talk to your daughter."
Draco had been right that just dumping some money into it from the Potter vaults wouldn't help, that they needed long-term solutions, but the money would certainly make it easier to put those long-term solutions into place. Draco only had to be willing to allow Harry to help.
He sighed. "Right." He took another bite of his leftover pasta and decided to move on to safer subjects. "So, what did she want to know about the war?"
"Malfoy," Harry breathed out. "Fucking hell, that was you?"
make me happy," I said, and I raised my hand slowly, giving him the chance to pull away if he wanted.
"Where was I?"
"Alex," Helen said, "you'll really like it there. They have a bedroom ready for you, and another little boy for you to play with."
He gave a little nod. "Yes. Yes, it will."
"How do you think they do it?" he asked after a few minutes, grateful it was just the three of them. "The Slytherins, that is. I mean, with everything that's been happening, their families falling out of power, the reparations, the anger from the press that so many of them got off—"
"You shouldn't have to avoid upsetting me. I need to learn to live with some of this better."
smack his already hurting husband upside the head. "Yes, this is probably related to what's going on with her, but she doesn't hate you. Go talk to her."
does that mean?"
Draco closed his eyes, running through his plans. The holidays were coming up anyway. He rarely got much work done then anyway. And he could cancel the conference in January, which would free up even more of his time. He opened his eyes and nodded. "I can handle that. Are they letting you go back to work?"
"Whatever it was you did."
First, I had some other matters to take care of. I needed to show him I'd taken his advice, that I was trying to pull myself together. Over the next day or two, I worked to get the house back in order. Preparing the garden for winter, cleaning, washing the linens, all things I'd been ignoring. With each task completed, I felt a little better. Less overwhelmed.
"Hey!" Harry managed to choke out, thankfully swallowing the food in his mouth first.
Because dammit, he missed Harry.
"Now?"
Harry simply stared, irritation and confusion and sadness warring in his features. He seemed to settle on the irritation. "Fine. Explain."
"I am!" Susan cheered. "Come on, Theo. You're going to help me. You don't have to sing, just be up there with me and help me dance."
"We don't have to go in," Draco said quietly. He could feel the emotions pouring from Harry, but he couldn't quite tell what they were. Dread, for sure, but there was so much more. "Dudley would understand."
Tindles was another area of contention between them. Harry enjoyed cooking. So many years of cooking for other people made the reward of finally cooking for himself something he looked forward to. And yes, he really disliked cleaning, having been forced to clean up after the Dursleys for so many years, but it was because he hated it so much that he could hardly stomach making someone else do it for him. Like Tindles.
"Look, I don't care—"
Harry cut him off. "You're going to see me differently, through their eyes. And I can't—"
"Yeah," she said and took a deep breath. "Eww, you smell."
"Yes," Draco answered, turning in Harry's arms and running his fingers along Harry's collar. "Like putting all this shit away so we have a bloody place to sleep tonight." He pushed Harry away.
Syria. It had only been the previous year—nearly five years after that mission that had Harry gone for over seven months—that Draco had finally learned where Harry had been during that time. Looking back, he was glad he hadn't known the danger in which his husband had truly been.
life truly began. It's when I decided to stop living my life for other people, to figure out what it was I wanted. It was the day I chose to take ownership of my future. It was the day I dared to hope again.
"Uh, is this Harry?"
Harry thought back to his morning, remembering Susan's stiffened shoulders and sad eyes after he'd snapped at her, and suddenly had a brilliant idea.
"But what about Alex?" Lyra asked, scooting off the bed and taking Hermione's hand. "I don't want him to go."
Harry moved closer and wrapped his arms around them both. "Teddy and Lyra will be home soon. What can we do to surprise them?"
When Draco was finally allowed to see Harry, when the Healers were finally satisfied that he was stable and that the Stasis Charm was holding Harry's magic at bay, it was almost too much. Draco wanted to run away, wanted to run home and pretend none of it was happening. He wanted to pick Lyra up from the Burrow and cuddle with her in her bed and tell her stories, knowing that Harry would be home before dinnertime, and he'd maybe have Teddy with him and they'd all sit down together as a family.
Ron said something with a grin, and Draco threw his head back, laughing, his face open and honest in a way Harry could barely relate back to the boy he'd known during the war. Harry watched Draco say something in return, causing the others to grin and start writing on their parchments while Draco stood, looking over each of their shoulders in turn. His hands would rest on the person as he examined their work, and he'd say something to each one, eliciting a nod or smile or word of thanks.
Lyra rolled her eyes and tutted. Wasn't she too young for that? "I
Harry had his door closed to his studio, so he was working. The red light spilling from beneath the door made it clear he was mid-development of the film, so Draco didn't dare disturb him. Instead, he wandered over to the kitchen, looking for something to make for dinner. Harry generally did the cooking, but Draco wanted to do something nice for his boyfriend.
Sitting down on the side of the bed, Draco gently tried to soothe the boy, his heart breaking. "Alex. Wake up, buddy. You're okay." What else could he say? He'd always soothed Lyra with reassurances that the nightmare was only that, just a bad dream, but Alex's parents were gone and everything wasn't just a nightmare. "You're safe."
"Why did that bother you?"
like. We're only going to give opinions if you can't pick between two things, but this is your choice. What do you like?"
She wrapped her arm around my waist, took Ron's hand, and we walked along the boardwalk. It should have been perfect, just me, my best friends, the early autumn sun setting over the horizon, and the sound of the ocean waves lapping at the sand.
Draco stood, listening as Harry's gentle baritone repeated the song through another time. A tear slipped down Draco's cheek and his heart swelled for this man who held their family together. The man who only wanted to hold his family close, who opened his heart to a boy alone in the night, who wanted the best for them all, including Draco.
He pushed them aside and pulled out the bundle of onions and several
"Yeah?"
Harry hesitated, listening.
"Draco?"
Harry closed his eyes, thinking about the reactions of the public, of the people who expected him to marry Ginny or Susan and start a family. Then he thought of the feel of Draco's hard body hovering over him. It was no contest. "Definitely."
"Just answer it," Draco muttered, his arms still around Harry's stomach and his face resting on Harry's chest. "Your mind won't let it go otherwise."
"But you're sure, right? Have you ever been with a bloke?"
Barking out a harsh laugh, Harry let his head fall back again. "Because I'd hoped you'd be able to help me, but that's not going to help."
Harry growled, but Hermione held up a hand.
"Huh?"
"You're welcome," Alex mumbled around his thumb.
It formed during Auror training more than a year after the war. We'd all taken that first year to heal, to go back to school in an attempt to find some kind of new normal in our lives. Hogwarts that year had been filled with war-weary young adults figuring out their identities in a new world of peace. Auror training was the logical next step for me, the only occupation I'd ever considered.
Draco paused at the sound of his name uttered so quietly by his former rival.
"Alex. Harry saved him and took him to a safe house, but the Apparition almost killed him. They were there most of the night, Harry trying to calm the child and unable to get word to us."
"Don't you think it might help?" Hermione's voice was gentle, and I could tell she was restraining herself from nagging at me, which I really did appreciate.
want, you imbecile. I'm going to teach you to figure it out for
He growled out the last words, and Harry nodded. It wasn't a surprise, really. Lucius probably wouldn't ever change.
"I was up with Alex most of the night. He seems to have gotten enough sleep, but I'm in bad shape."
"Alex?" Lyra's voice came from the hallway outside Draco's door. It opened a crack, her green eyes peering in and growing wide when she saw the bed. "Papa," she whispered loudly, "you're awake!"
"Sure," she agreed before following Lyra.
It sounded like one of the pets, like maybe one of them was crying, but as Draco stepped into the bedroom and pulled on his pyjamas, he noticed Cat asleep on the bed, Caius in the hallway outside the children's doors, and Thalia was off delivering a letter to Blaise and Charlie on the continent.
If Harry was honest with himself — which he tried to be these days — he more than admired Draco. He envied him. And that was…weird.
Jimmy slapped his bald forehead with a smack. "Oi, that's right. How's he liking it? What house?"
"Alex isn't coming home with us?" Lyra asked, her voice becoming shrill. "Daddy?"
"Daddy said the trapestry used to be broken, but he and Papa had it fixed and gave it to Grandmother when they got married. Over here is what I wanted to show you, though. I saw it when I came to visit Grandmother with Teddy last week."
Draco laughed. "I believe that's good, then." He shook out his hair and leant back on his hands, grinning. "So you're well and truly bent."
"Gathii had some news that you might have heard if you'd stayed," he said after a few moments, still watching me closely.
"I'd like that," Harry said, and the answering grin on Draco's face made Harry's stomach warm. He followed the man into the back of the shop and watched as Draco began to skillfully build the bouquet for Susan.
He took a deep breath. He trusted Hermione, but he didn't like the entire situation. He tried to put it out of his mind and turned to the kids.
Draco's heartbeat quickened. "What's wrong?"
From there, everything seemed to move at the speed of light. The memory was examined and entered into evidence. The curse appeared to be something the Healers had never heard of, some Spanish invention, but the memory of the casting allowed them to study the wand movements and incantation, and they went to work. Hermione called in favours from the Department of Mysteries, and it was only a matter of hours until the Unspeakables and Healers developed a counter-curse.
"Well, let me take Kiwi," Dad said, shrinking her trunk and putting it in his pocket before reaching for the Knarl's cage. Kiwi huffed and rolled into a prickly ball, and Dad smiled. "She kind of reminds me of you."
So why did he always complicate it?
The nerves in Harry's stomach began to bounce, and Harry sat in the armchair by the fire. He didn't know what to look at, so he just stared as Draco perched on the edge of the bed, curious as to what he wanted. Draco shifted and began to play with the button on his pocket watch.
Dudley turned to Draco. "Come on."
so the names aren't too close, so don't be shocked if you notice that in the future.)
unreasonable, wasn't it?
"With a passion," Ginny agreed. "I don't know the details, I just know that this is going to be incredibly difficult for him."
Draco fell to his knees. "Read it."
Ginny leant forwards and threw her arms around Luna's slim shoulders, then caught her mouth in a long, drawn-out kiss.
"That's a low blow," she said, staring at the floor.
“Have dinner with me tomorrow. Please.”
"Uh, yeah. Sorry. I don't know what to say."
Harry slammed down a box of Cheerios and when he spoke, his voice was hard. "I told you I don't like leaving a mess. It bothers me."
Harry looked towards the dark windows. "What time is it? What day? Gods, I'm so muddled."
She left, and Draco took the seat next to Teddy's bed.
Draco dropped his hands and raised his eyebrows. "Yeah?"
The sounds around me finally penetrated my awareness, and I turned to look around. Seagulls squawked loudly, swooping over our heads along the sandy dune where we stood, Ron just behind Hermione, watching us carefully, watching
She shot him a look that would have looked at home on the face of any twelve-year-old, making sure he knew his warning wasn't necessary, before taking Hermione's hand. "I'll see you after we Floo, Alex," she said to the boy as Draco scooped him up. "Don't worry."
. Rosie told me all about it because she's already a big sister. But Alex is more fun than Hugo, and he'll be
Draco's head fell to the side and he looked at Harry, his brow furrowed. "Do you miss them? Your family?"
Harry's eyes glistened. "Gods, yes. I want that so much. I think he already is."
"They fought. Harry called him a coward and told him to pull himself together and take care of his wife and kid."
I let out a little huff while I chopped the onions for the shepherd's pie, then cast a quick charm to clear the smell as my eyes began to water. "You know I don't do tours."
Draco pulled Harry close, their wet, naked bodies fitting together in that way that always amazed Harry, like two puzzle pieces snapped into place. He usually found it arousing, but now it was just comforting.
"Well, now you both concentrate on getting Harry better, and we talk to the social worker about moving Alex to a foster home until they find the family." She narrowed her eyes at Draco. "And
"Let's go see Daddy," Lyra told Hermione, her tone bordering on an order.
"Please, Draco. I need some time to think."
Draco rolled his eyes and let out a long-suffering sigh. "Write it down. Please. Between Hermione and I, we'll take it from there."
And no, he shouldn't have bitten her head off for it, as it was kind of her to make sure he remembered the meeting, and yes, he could have just taken the pain potion and coffee with him, but he was too busy snarling and running down the hallway to the meeting room to think clearly.
Ron tilted his head like he thought Draco had lost his mind. "It's Harry. He'll be okay."
I shook my head. "No, I think I want to be alone for a bit."
There was a chain hanging from the little ceiling next to a bare bulb, and Draco took it, pulled, and gasped.
He leant forwards and dropped his head into his hands. "I need to check on Lyra, but I can't leave. What if he wakes up?"
"No," Teddy growled, leveraging his body up and off the other side of the bed, then losing his balance and nearly falling before he caught himself on the mattress. He pushed himself back up and stood, his eyes fierce. "Where's Harry?"
"But—"
Harry got quiet, something that only usually happened when he was at the edge. He walked to the kitchen window and peered out into the barren garden, the November wind kicking around the leaves on the ground.
"I'll be out in a moment!" a man's voice called from the backroom. "Please, feel free to look around."
Draco rushed from the fireplace and up the stairs to his and Harry's bedroom. He strode to his bureau and opened the valet tray. Pushing aside cufflinks, rings, his father's watch, he finally found it: a small, bronze knut.
She looked interested. "Are they paired with only each other? Or are there others in the charm?"
do this.
"I still can't get over this, you two living together," Ginny said a few minutes later when everyone had settled in.
And when they'd finished, he'd poured through Parvati's books with her. He found a haircut he thought was good that wasn't far from his natural mess, but looked like it was messy on purpose.
They both had that "worried about Harry" look on their faces, and I felt my shoulders stiffen. "I'm fine," I said automatically.
"There wasn't a Floo where I was, and I came straight here."
And I knew he still needed me, but it just wasn't the same. Of course, it wasn't.
Well, Harry had been doing a good job of hiding it from him. He just wasn't sure how long he could keep that up.
"Is he going to get better?" She sounded careful, as though she were afraid to know the answer.
"She doesn't hate you. Stop being so dramatic. That's my job."
“Dad—” Scorpius said, but Lucius cut the boy off.
Hermione smiled. "Sure. Are you ready to go, Alex?"
He let her attempt the cut and it came out rather well, actually. But the entire ordeal left him exhausted, and thankfully, everyone had left. Except for Draco.
"Uh, right. Sorry. You work here?"
I'd been so intent on getting there, on seeing Draco, on having a day doing something I loved with a friend I loved that I hadn't even considered that it was something I usually did with Ted. I cleared my throat, hoping that my change of mood wasn't obvious.
Harry was silent for several more minutes, then he gasped, and Draco jerked up, alarmed. "What's wrong? Do you need a Healer? What happened?"
Her smile stretched across her face. "Yummy. And for Alex too?"
Petunia's voice hissed in his head.
Harry stopped pacing and threw up his arms. "Exactly! I don't know why he wants me there. It doesn't make any sense."
This time, however, the sound of his mother's voice drew his attention. "Draco, darling, you need to eat. Molly sent some soup." His mother pulled over the rolling hospital table in front of his chair and put down a covered bowl. She pulled off the lid and set out a spoon, then a glass of water.
And Draco…
Draco scooted closer, gently rubbing the cloth across Harry's oily forehead, wiping away the crust around his eyes. Harry leaned into the touch like a cat seeking a caress, and Draco felt his eyes burn again at the thought that he'd almost lost this man. His mind sought another topic, trying to distract his anxiety from spiralling.
Draco closed his eyes for a moment, bracing himself. "He was hurt too, but he's at the hospital and already almost better. I bet you'll be able to see him tomorrow."
"You're drinking tea and sitting with friends in a terrible-smelling kitchen," Luna answered.
"Karaoke stage, what else?" Pansy answered. "Look!" She pointed at the stage where a large screen had lyrics rolling across it and a man and woman sang to each other, each with a pint in their hands and a microphone in the other. The crowd cheered them on, and it was only then Harry noticed the music wasn't quite the quality he'd been expecting.
"Harry," Draco mocked, "I didn't say you have to pull, though I wouldn't hold it against you if you did, but just kiss him." He smiled, and his grey eyes took on a serious tilt. "Be happy."
“Mr Potter,” Lucius said thoughtfully before turning away from Scorpius and narrowing his eyes at Draco. “You’re taking the Minister for Magic to the Ministry ball. As your date?”
Hermione smiled. "Good morning, sleepyhead. You looked so cute when I came in, we didn't have the heart to wake you. And no, I'm not kidding. They're staunch, traditionalist pure-bloods, and they didn't take kindly to Alexander's marrying a Muggle." Hermione's voice became more clipped as she spoke. "Evidently, they believe the uncle was doing the family a favour, and they're threatening to sue the British Aurors for using extreme force on their son."
She smiled, the expression finally meeting her eyes, and then stood, picking up her cloak.
"Just sit. I'm okay."
"You and Draco. I would never have thought that you'd get on so well, but it's like he makes you happy."
Draco's reply was almost immediate.
Draco was just so sure of himself now — not in the pompous manner of
Ginny froze and looked at her girlfriend, her eyes wide. "You want to get married?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. The entire table had quieted though, waiting on Luna's response. The two had been dating since the war and everyone just assumed neither were interested in a formal marriage.
"Nothing. I don't feel like being touched much, you know? I'm a teenager, not a baby."
"Harry."
Harry stiffened. "Who? You mean all of them?"
"Well, sometimes bad guys or women do something
"Merlin, you're an angsty fuck, aren't you?" Draco asked. "If you want to be happy, tell everyone to fuck off and do what you want to do. It should be easier for you, shouldn't it? Everyone already likes you."
Draco shrugged. "What did you make me?"
Harry nodded, still not opening his eyes. "I was mortified when things…didn't work…with Ginny."
"No, Billywig," he said, his voice quiet and sad. He looked down at the small boy cuddled between him and his daughter. He was so young. "Somebody murdered his mum and dad. That's why he's here with us right now, because they're trying to find the rest of his family so he can go live with them."
Draco opened his eyes at that, picking his head up. "Are you fucking kidding me?"
Harry nodded, unable to form any words with his thoughts so muddled, so he took out his essay and handed it over to Draco, who began to read.
"Uh, yeah. I had to stop before, er, you know." Harry's face was flaming, but the room was dark and he was sure Draco couldn't see it. But Draco had done this for him, and he felt like he owed him the truth.
The crowds flowed around them on the train platform, leaving a buffer of space between everyone else and her family. It was something that she realised now always seemed to happen, but she'd never really thought about it until now.
Draco wasn't sure how much of that Alex really understood, but the boy gave a quiet, "Okay," and crawled over the bed and pulled back the blankets.
"Does she hate me now?"
"Definitely," she said, laying back on her pillows and squealing when he stole one out from under her, tucking it behind his back and scooting back to lean against the wall.
It was like nothing else Harry had yet experienced. Draco's lips were stronger, larger than Ginny's had been, but somehow they felt even softer, smoother. Harry heard a little moan escape, and he thought it was his, but he couldn't be sure because Draco chose that moment to run his hand up through Harry's hair. The gentle caress had Harry arch back, opening his mouth and pulling Draco in.
Hermione smiled. "I thought that might be it. I asked Helen about it, and there are a good deal of legal documents that'll need to be signed. A formal inspection of the home will have to be made, and he needs a private space set up in the house for a bedroom."
ing."
He tasted so different than Harry would have ever imagined — if Harry had imagined such a thing as the taste of Draco Malfoy's mouth, which he was pretty sure he'd never done. It was like expensive tea and fresh-baked cake, and Harry couldn't do anything but enjoy the feeling of being plundered. Because that's what it felt like, and Harry loved it.
"No, I just came by to tell you I couldn't stay today. I, er, have a meeting with my editor." Which was ridiculous, because Draco knew Liza didn't work on weekends. But it was all I could manage at the moment. "Great to see you Gathii. I'll see you around, I'm sure."
Draco pulled back slightly. "I love you. You're my family. I chose you."
She pulled back and glared.
"I know, buddy," Draco soothed. "I bet they're so happy you're safe, even if they can't be here with you."
"Tell me everything," Ginny said, and Draco could hear Luna in the background.
She smiled weakly. "If they trust you, it's possible. Unfortunately, Laurel, the woman in charge of Alex at the moment, hasn't been able to track down any family or other adults who he'd trust."
Harry reached past Draco to grab a sandwich. "He'll be fine," he said, ripping into his own sandwich. "Thanks, Gin."
"A little boy, actually. His name is Alex, and he's three years old. Would you like to meet him?"
"Thank Merlin," Draco said, thinking of the boy he'd seen grow into the young man lying in the next room. "Gods, he really got lucky, didn't he?"
," I growled, irritation tightening my shoulders like an itch.
"I need it too," Draco said, his voice raw. "Please."
Like Draco.
Still, Draco's eyes widened, and he sputtered, "Yes, but mine tossed me out of the house on Christmas because I dared to tell them I like men."
"How can you be happy when you don't even know what you want to wear or eat?" Draco asked, and the truth of it hit Harry in the stomach.
I think the more important question is, what's Harry ignoring?
"Draco," Hermione said quietly. "The curse that hit Harry… Going by what Alex told us, Harry had already sent Teddy to St Mungo's, but Alex saw it and heard it. He's three, so obviously he can't tell us more, but…"
Draco was unsure if he'd ever sat through a more uncomfortable dinner in his entire life, and that included those that included the Dark Lord. His daughter snapped at everyone, including her little brother who apparently chewed and breathed too loudly. She'd been scolded for that and proceeded to glare at each person, refusing to say anything else as she stabbed at her meal.
"It's fine, shrimp."
Harry nodded, and Draco's newly freshened breath drifted over Harry's face, making his stomach tighten even more. He wanted to close his eyes, but he couldn't seem to shift them from Draco's gaze.
This time it was Hermione who reached out and put her hand on his. "Good. I need to update Helen, but I came here first. What should I tell her?"
Hermione moved to put her arm around mine, hugging me close.
Curious, Harry stepped closer to the doorway where he'd heard the voice emanate. A young man's backside was to him — and a gorgeous backside it was. His slim build was covered with a cool, blue shirt that pulled across what appeared to be a strong back and muscular shoulders. His arse, though, was where the man excelled. It was housed in a pair of trousers that should have been illegal, the way they outlined each perfectly rounded cheek and hugged the man's thick thighs.
Harry didn't meet Draco's eyes, reaching for a napkin to spread across his lap. "I don't want to talk about it."
Draco closed his eyes, thinking of those sad green eyes. "Well, I mean, he's grieving, right?"
She patted his hand, then stood and shook out the skirt of her robes. "Now, I have some lunch to make those children, and you have a husband to pick up from the hospital."
No, he didn't. He was more than happy to wait until Tindles came over at the end of the night to clean it all up, like the house-elf had nothing better to do.
The social worker—
Harry stared, wondering how that arse would feel in his hands when the man straightened, and Harry backed away, turning to look at a nearby flower.
Yet, he'd done it. He'd lain himself bare for everyone to see, and fuck, he'd been amazing. He'd stood up there in front of a room full of strangers and told about his own personal demons. Harry wanted to help people, as usual, wanted to bring them hope. It was one of the things that Draco loved most about Harry, his boundless love for people he didn't even know.
Harry sat back, stunned. "What?"
"If you don't want to," Draco said, looking embarrassed and beginning to sit backwards again.
Draco stood up and rounded the table, then gathered Harry in his arms.
"Yeah. It has." Dudley turned to Draco, giving him an awkward smile. "Is this your boyfriend then?" The question sounded polite, kind even, but all Harry could hear were the ghostly echoes of taunts and jeers.
How was he supposed to know it would happen? It wasn't like he knew the bloody house-elf, or that he could expect that his Auror partner, of all people, would take the information to heart. No, it was just an innocent comment while working on a case in Potter's home study and a request for Antacid Potion, with which the house-elf quickly returned.
"Why are you sorry?" Harry was so confused. Why would Draco be sorry? He'd done nothing but be there for Harry all day. Harry was the one who should apologise for being such a mess during this entire thing.
"Master Harry," Tindles said in her high-pitched voice, "Master Draco asked me to help you unpack when you were home." She smiled and snapped her fingers, Harry's bags disappearing from where he'd dropped them by the door. "Can Tindles draw you a bath in the big tub?"
That had been one of the best decisions he'd ever made.
Draco sighed. "It's barely seven o'clock. We won't be able to get him until after lunchtime." He looked down at his bright-eyed child. "I don't suppose you're willing to go back to sleep, are you?"
"We'll figure it out. Most of his are for work, so I'm sure they'll go in his darkroom."
Hey! Leave me out of this. Harry, do what you want.
"You're never hungry," Draco pointed out, raising an eyebrow, calling Harry out on his obfuscation.
"And will it be worth it?"
"Gathii, welcome back." I turned to Draco, embarrassed and afraid he'd recognise my tumultuous reaction. "I, uh, didn't mean to interrupt here."
"Not for at least two weeks," Harry said, sounding petulant.
She nodded, her eyes serious.
He should just tell him. Merlin knew it'd make it easier, but he was so damned afraid. Afraid of Draco's reaction. Afraid that Draco might think less of him, might realise that he really wasn't the brave Gryffindor everyone made him out to be, that he was weak.
She narrowed her green eyes and tilted her head. She looked so much like Harry at that moment that it made Draco's eyes burn with tears.
Harry thought back. "She didn't write much for the last month or so, I guess. Usually, her letters are to us both, and they seemed fine. She talked about her friends and classes."
Harry listened to the explanations, finally able to ignore the tuggings of envy in his stomach as he got to work.
Always, though, the story would end with Amil's kind and simple manners offering the people a ray of hope in their lives. Like Teddy had for me.
"I look nice every day. You're happy for them, but…"
The Hogsmeade train platform was bustling with students, and Harry's eyes scanned the milling crowd. He saw most of the eighth year students moving together nearby, everyone waiting behind the younger students. They were all intermingled now, a full term of sharing a common room thawing most of the iciness of their pasts. Susan Bones, Terry Boot, and Theo Nott were chatting with Dean and Seamus, Pansy Parkinson moving from their group to talk with Hermione as they waited to board the carriages for the ride back to the school.
"Whom?" Draco was a little lost. Teddy often did that to him, his mind jumping from topic to topic faster than Draco could follow.
Harry blinked, looking around to see they were the only ones left, the platform having cleared while he was silently musing. "Sorry," he huffed out, crawling into the final carriage behind his ex-girlfriend.
Hermione raised an eyebrow, but he could tell she was suppressing a grin. "Now, what's next?"
"Teddy's fine," said Ron, trying to reassure me. "She had wards up to protect the rest of the house."
But still, things were left unsaid between Harry and Draco.
"Hermione stopped by while I was making dinner."
"And I was the latest battle?"
Harry's problem, and if he had to piss him off to get him to back off, he would.
Malfoy cleared his throat after several seconds. "Potter. Good to see you," he said formally. "How can I help you?"
"They're not your parents," he said, his voice calm but stern. "Your parents are fine."
Alex nodded, his eyes drooping but his shoulders tense.
Hermione looked him over, then adjusted his shirt and ran her hand through Draco's hair, pulling a few locks down around the sides. "Yeah. You'll do, I think."
Harry was watching them closely, and Draco could see his mind turning through the details. "He's going to need therapy, I'd think. And extra attention."
"Michelle says—"
Draco looked as though he were about to speak, but closed his mouth on a nod. When he spoke again, the warmth had returned and Harry felt like he'd won a little victory. "Well, definitely not roses then."
"Yours." Harry turned his back on Draco, and Draco's stomach went cold. Harry's voice was quiet as he pulled on his wand harness and grabbed his cloak. "Right. Well, I'll just go, then, and let you deal with what's yours. Don't forget Lyra's spending the night with Molly and Rosie tonight. I might be late getting home."
He felt the sadness he'd been feeling quickly turning to irritation. "Oh, fuck that."
"Really." Harry swung around and sat astride Draco's lap, and he ran a finger along Draco's jaw, eliciting a shiver. "I'm sorry I left without us talking it out. I was sorry the moment I realised that I was so badly hurt. I wouldn't have done anything differently on the mission, because I was there to save Alex and he desperately needed me, but if I could go back and make things right between us before I left that morning, I would. Maybe you would have suffered a little less."
"What are you taking?"
"No, wait! I didn't say that," Harry said quickly, looking for an excuse for why he felt so suddenly afraid. "I just, uh, well, my breath smells like crisps."
Draco smiled. "Do what you think is necessary. I just don't want that little boy to suffer again so soon. He needs at least a few more days of stability before things change again."
Draco rolled his eyes. "I told you about this already."
"Pardon?" Draco asked, finally opening his eyes.
He just wasn't sure how choosing music would do the same, but Draco insisted. He had Hermione and Theo helping this time, Muggle CDs and wizarding records scattered around the room on a Friday night, two weeks later.
"You can always talk to me about anything," Dad said, his eyes filled with tears.
"I know. I did a lot of bad things in the war—"
"Are you planning on leaving the castle?"
. It takes place only a month after this epilogue, and then there's an entire story called
"I love you," Harry said into the dark.
"I know," she said quietly.
"Was that Kreacher?" Potter asked, and Draco nodded dumbly. "What's in there?"
"Where's mine? I'm a necessary part of making this baby too."
"But I wasn't alone. And my future is mine to make with it as I will.
"Lyra."
Harry ran his hand through his hair, trying not to be offended because Draco was right. Those weren't things he ever really thought about. Ginny picked out his clothes the previous summer, and before that, it was mostly Dudley's old things. Hermione evidently had been choosing what he was eating, and Molly generally cut his hair. Harry mostly just went along with it.
Harry's eyes flew open, and Draco had moved the bowls of crisps out of the way, moving next to Harry. "Okay?" Harry said, unsure of where this was going.
But I also was jealous, and that didn't make sense, did it?
"I don't even know how to do that!" I hissed, trying to keep my voice down, not wanting to wake Teddy. "It's a ridiculous idea. I'm just me, not a writer."
"Thanks." Draco crossed the room to where Molly sat on a kitchen chair, a sobbing Alex in her arms. "Hi, Alex. Molly. What's going on?"
Amil was my answer to a seven-year-old metamorph's need for bedtime stories that included boats. I'd become his only parent by this time, each of us finally settled into our new home and life, and each evening he'd curl up next to me in his bed and ask me to tell him a story.
You guys.
the answer to your being happy? Telling your bastard of a father to fuck off and deciding to do whatever you want to do, regardless of what everyone thinks?"
morning.
Draco smiled. "Yes."
"I reckon I can't argue with that. Just admire with your eyes and keep your hands to yourself, idiot."
I tried not to read too much into that, but it was hard.
Simon, the therapist I'd been visiting on and off in the years since the war. Mostly, I went to him when the residual trauma caught up with me, when the nightmares returned, or the flashbacks got to be too much. Honestly, I hadn't been to see him in almost three years. I'd been doing so well, so it hadn't even occurred to me to go back now.
"They've had a marriage contract set up for me since I was a toddler, did you know that? Oh, it wasn't binding or anything, but it was an expected outcome that I'd grow up, marry the virginal, pure-blood wife, and take over the Malfoy estates as a good heir should. My whole life was mapped out for me." He stopped and raised an eyebrow at Harry. "I know you're not pure-blood, but I imagine you know what that feels like."
"It's nice," Hermione said, scooting over next to him.
Deciding to let it go, Draco nodded and started to dish out the food, then tore off a chunk of bread and handed it to Harry.
"All right. Come on, Scarhead. Let's get you home where you can mope and lament in privacy. The last thing you need right now is the bloody
"Your uncle isn't here. Harry made sure he couldn't hurt you."
And Draco was right. That made him happy.
"And the bigger picture is that I love you." Draco sighed and lowered his voice. "I would give you everything because you're my family. But I have to let you do the same."
been late. But not this late. Not without a message.
Harry smiled. "Thanks. I have to get back to work in a few, and still have to walk to the Apparition point, though. Can you maybe send it over?"
"I missed you," she muttered in my ear.
Mind whirling, Draco felt like every fear had been confirmed. "Can we see him?" he asked, trying to push his concerns for Harry out of his mind until they knew more. Teddy was the more immediate concern.
Harry was having a
The little boy nodded, his brown curls bouncing slightly around his face.
"Sorry," he muttered. "Harry and I had a disagreement this morning, and he left for work in a snit."
Draco woke to a bright light in his bedroom. He opened his eyes to a vibrant, transparent Jack Russell terrier floating above his bed, speaking with Weasley's voice.
Relieved at the distraction, Harry pushed it all to the side and tried to enjoy his friends for a little while.
"Alex," Draco said quietly, continuing to move. "I've got you. You're safe. We're here for you, little bug. Draco and Lyra and Harry. Shhh…"
"He's been cursed, and they haven't been able to identify it yet. It's turning his magic against him, which is slowly destroying his body. He was in a lot of pain when we found him, but he was conscious and protecting the child. The more magic he used, the more it rebounded on him."
He was Draco's ex. He'd left Draco nearly three years before and returned to Kenya, leaving me to help mend Draco's broken heart.
Hermione laughed. "Rose has a crush on a Hufflepuff girl, but she's not ready to do anything about it."
And then he'd gotten to work, his head ready to crack open, and all he'd wanted was a few minutes of peace, a cup of coffee, and a Pain-relieving Potion. He'd just sat down at his desk with his coffee and potion when his partner, Susan Bones, burst into their office, reminding him that he was required to be in a department meeting in three minutes and that he'd better hurry his arse in there before he got written up for tardiness for the third time this month.
They both jerked around, and Alex just knew he was going to be in trouble.
," Ginny said, groaning.
"I have a very good memory." She ruffled Alex's hair. "But not as good as Alex's. I can't save people with my memory."
weren't okay, were they? They'd fought, and then Harry had gone out into the field instead of coming home and he'd almost died, and Draco hadn't known, he
He'd been expecting something enlightening, something that would make him say "oh, I get it." but there was nothing. It was empty, and if possible, he was even more confused. He turned to Dudley, but Dudley just looked sad.
Draco dropped a kiss on each of the heads of dark curls on the bed and went to find Hermione.
; don't you see that? Fuck, I just— I thought I knew you. I knew there were things I was missing, some missing pieces of the big picture, but I didn't realise it could be something like this, something so big."
His other close friends knew, even if Ron seemed confused by the idea from time to time, but Harry wasn't ready to tell the world — just like he wasn't ready to tell everyone he wasn't going to join the Aurors, that he was going to let them all down, that he wouldn't meet their expectations.
"But you'll flirt?"
, was still in the next room. I imagined he was waiting for me to come and tell him a story about Amil, the Boy Pirate, who changes his looks at will, sailing the seven seas doing good deeds under the guise of piracy.
He jerked up so she could see his scowl. "I'm not going home."
Three weeks later, I'd not even felt up to leaving the house, let alone doing something productive like cleaning or working on my stories…or even taking a shower. But it was Hermione's birthday, and Ron had made plans, insisting I tag along.
Draco sighed and let her slide down to the ground at his feet.
"Peasant," he said with a tired little laugh, then turned to make his way to Teddy's room.
"It'll be a huge adjustment for all of us. Especially Lyra."
"Dudley," Harry said, his voice controlled and calm as he took Dudley's hand in his. "It's been a long time."
"Well, I figured it'd either turn into this or a brawl. Either way, the kids wouldn't need to see it."
"Stage? What stage?" Harry asked, feeling panicked.
It's not always your fault, Draco. What happened?
His solemn tone halted me from hitting the button on the remote. "It's just a story I made up for my godson," I insisted.
"So now what?" Ron asked.
Harry thought about his cupboard, about Dudley's second bedroom, about the Burrow and Grimmauld Place and all the places he'd stayed but never really called his own. He looked around his room and sighed.
"There was a Potions accident," Hermione said, her voice thick with tears. "Her entire lab was destroyed."
I had work I enjoyed, even if I couldn't bring myself to write at the moment. I had a lovely house and a godson who wrote to me regularly, who would come home to me during the holidays and brighten everything again. I had my friends and the Weasleys. And I had Draco. I had people who loved me, who made my life good.
She looked down and started playing with the skin around her fingernail. "Yeah, that's good. I'm also taking Ancient Runes and Arithmancy. Aunt Hermione said those were some of her favourites, and Auntie Luna says Runes is in the blood, so hopefully I'll enjoy those."
Draco sat back, seemingly satisfied, but the concept continued to stir in my brain.
"Yeah, okay," he said, walking over to the sleeping child and brushing his hand over the boy's forehead. "Alex," he said, squatting down next to him.
Draco wanted to weep for Alex, left alone with no one. He wanted to weep for a little boy in Surrey so many years ago, left alone with only anger and hate.
We were all laughing by then, enjoying the idea of new life, new hope, and for a few minutes, I didn't feel nearly so empty. It was a good night.
"Why she's mad. Rose told Hermione they studied the war in detail in the last month or so of school. And they read parts of the Breddings book."
"Ugh, don't remind me. Hermione told me Rose has a crush on a Hufflepuff."
So Draco sat in the front row of the auditorium, watching as Harry took a deep, steadying breath and began his story.
"Wonderful," she said, rolling her eyes and pushing back from the table.
I jerked. Teddy. Oh my God. Teddy. He'd lost so much, and now his grandmother was gone, too. The war was over. Stuff like this wasn't supposed to happen anymore.
Dudley's eyes glazed over, lost in memories, and Draco let him remember whatever it was, unable to move his attention away from the door in front of him.
"Not for that! Dad, all these people love you for this really crazy, amazing thing you did for them, and I didn't even know about it. Me. Your own daughter. I felt like you'd lied to me my whole life, and when I found out what happened, it was like everything was different, and I was at school and couldn't even talk to you about it."
Harry was asleep, boneless and sated, next to Draco in bed. The moonlight fell through the sheer curtains, casting a dim glow over Harry's familiar face.
"Draco," Harry said again, stronger. "Stop it." His eyes were still closed, and he looked exhausted. "Please."
"Oh God, I'm sorry."
"Everyone I know would Floo call, and surely they wouldn't do it at this hour."
In the shower, with the water running over his body, the rage washed away and made room for the guilt.
"Kreacher!" Harry yelled at his decrepit house-elf. "Enough is enough."
He closed his eyes and shook his head, unable to get the words out without dissolving back into tears.
The thing is, when you plan something out so entirely in your mind and you think about it for days, it never goes how you thought it would. This was no exception.
Draco buried his face in Alex's curls, hoping nobody would notice the tears. He had a son.
"Treacle Tart."
"Hardly," Draco agreed, a slight smile turning the corners of his mouth, but then his face sobered. "Still, the sentiment stands. What is it you want me to do? What can I do to make you stop watching me like I'm up to something? Like something about me disturbs you?"
Harry froze, horrified at Draco's assumption. Fuck. "Draco—"
Harry's eyes met Draco's across the crowd and he smiled. It was that half-smile Harry gave when he was pleased but embarrassed.
"His memory is going to save my daddy, just like my daddy saved him," Lyra said, her voice sounding cold and imperious. "And I'm going to help by making him know that he's not alone, so you can start now, okay?"
He put the lid on the cream and turned off the light, joining his sulking husband in bed. "We knew things would change eventually. And they'll change again for Alex. It's natural."
"And sometimes it's going to feel like we're paying more attention to him because he's smaller and needs extra help," Harry added, "but we love you both so much and there will be times we pay extra attention to you too."
"I feel horrible. I made this into this huge fight it didn't need to be, and then I decided to go out on that bloody call, and all I could think was the last thing I said to you was that I never had a family." Harry's voice was thick, his eyes glassy. "And I really didn't mean that. You're my family."
"She does not," Draco said, exasperated. "What did you figure out?"
article, and Harry was finally reaching his limit. It was the middle of February and the stories still came nearly every day. Speculations now were that he and Ginny had split — finally, at least they got something correct — and that he was cosied up with Susan Bones — obviously, incorrect. A Potter-Bones wedding was projected to be the event of the coming decade, and while Susan had laughed it off, Harry just felt it as one more brick laid upon his back.
Draco nodded. "He was amazing. He did so well, and Lyra held his hand through the whole thing."
Draco felt the urge to laugh bubble up in his stomach for the first time in what felt like aeons, even if it was only a couple of days.
"All right then," she said, taking another sip but keeping her eyes trained on him. "Your relationship is very different from those you saw growing up. Your father and I had separate roles in our marriage, in our lives, and even in our parenting."
"Yeah. The curse turned it against you."
"You wouldn't enjoy it if it wasn't a challenge," Draco said with a chuckle.
His heart felt lighter at the thought.
"What—"
He took a deep breath and forced himself to meet her brown eyes. "I have to do it, don't I?"
Alex sat quietly, then finally he nodded and looked up at Draco. "You can be my Papa?"
Draco nodded and proceeded to fill Harry in on everything Hermione had told him. Harry listened, sitting in his boxers on the bed, absorbing every word and analysing every piece of information.
I grabbed Ron and gave him an even louder kiss, this one on the lips, making him sputter and pull away.
Aargh.
"Harry and Teddy left the ministry together around five o'clock this afternoon. A call had come in about a routine underage magic report in Durham, and Auror Michelson says Harry thought it'd be a decent training opportunity for Teddy. He claimed it'd be a good experience talking to witnesses and calling in Obliviators, if necessary, and then following through on filing the required paperwork after. Officially, Harry's name is on the sheets for Auror assigned to the call, so when Teddy came in, it didn't flag Harry's case."
Rage flooded through Draco's body. "She said that?"
Draco knew it was a mistake, but he turned around and saw Harry’s sagging shoulders. He looked so alone.
Draco looked closer at the child, remembering the feel of his breathing against Draco's skin, the warmth of the child cuddled into his back. "No," he said quietly. "I think it may be all the strangers. Perhaps see if you can clear things out a little?"
Harry's lips twitched. "Yeah, bud, go ahead. But don't bother your sister, okay?"
Draco stopped, a flashback of the time so many years ago when he'd approached a similar scene with trepidation. This time, however, he was one of them. He was family.
Draco grabbed the chart as he turned to greet the next patient. It’d been a ridiculously busy day, and he wondered if he’d hit some new St Mungo’s record of the most patients seen in a single shift. He realised later that he probably should have been reading the chart and not pondering his day.
Draco sucked in a breath, but she laid her hand on his arm.
Draco peeked around the door and could see Harry staring at the bag he'd set on his chair, his shoulders sagging. He withdrew a container of something Draco couldn't see, then tucked the rest of the bag under his desk.
It's his song, something that makes Daddy and Papa and Lyra think of him, they've said.
"Fuck, yes. Play it again," he ordered when the song was over. "That was perfect." Utterly perfect.
Draco turned his head and looked at Harry, his dark hair messy with sweat, his face and chest flushed. His husband. His family. His love. "Yeah, me too."
"Hermione." He could hear the plea in his voice. He was too tired and emotionally exhausted to care. It was just past midnight and there was still no word from Harry.
"If you don't mind, I'd like to kiss a bloke."
Draco rolled his eyes but didn't deign to answer the rhetorical question.
Draco's head turned back from the window, and his narrowed eyes landed on Harry. "What do you mean, you didn't know you were going?"
She approached and tried to reach out to Alex, but he just buried his face in Draco's neck. "What if we go with Draco, Alex? I can show you where Lyra sleeps and you can take a bath in her bathtub."
"How about some music?" Papa suggests, pointing his wand at the music player on the shelf.
"I won't," Draco promised, and he hoped to Merlin he could keep his word, dread curling around in his stomach.
Harry hates messes. Even I know that.
"Have you talked to Simon lately?" Ron asked, and I realised I'd been staring at the ocean for several minutes, ignoring my friends.
I turned for the door before remembering my plans for the day — the plans that had so far been decimated and squashed into bicorn powder. At least I could still apologise and get that off my list.
Harry parked the car on the street in front of the house next door, turned off the engine, and simply stared.
"I feel horrible. I still think I wasn't completely wrong, that he shouldn't feel obligated to help with the situation, but…"
"That's nice," I answered automatically and then froze. "Wait, what?"
Ron and Hermione were sitting across from me in the dingy library of Grimmauld Place. I couldn't concentrate on them, however, due to the incessant buzzing in my ears.
Lyra scrunched up her brows, clearly thinking that through. "Okay, but why does that make Alex poor? He's too little to be a bad guy."
"She'll be ecstatic, but I think you're right," Harry agreed, coming up behind him and meeting his gaze in the mirror. "I can't believe we're going to do this."
Harry started to laugh and met Hermione's wide eyes through the crowd. "No, not at all."
And with that, I fled.
They were both lying on the fluffy carpet, looking up at the glowing, plastic stars on Harry's ceiling. Harry's Live cd was playing on his new music player, and the blue light Draco had conjured had made the room take on a strange glow — Hermione had called it a blacklight when she'd stopped in, but whatever.
. Thank you."
Sunday had been much the same, though this time, Harry had locked himself in his darkroom the entire day, claiming he had work to do. Draco had tried to convince him to relax, to take the time off, to talk, to grieve, but Harry's breathing would become erratic when Draco brought it up, so he'd let him go, hoping he'd talk when he was ready.
smile.
He shook his head. "No."
Draco chuckled. "I am. Come over here, Billywig." She crawled up onto the bed and laid her head on Harry's pillow, looking at him and Alex. "Have you been helping take care of him?"
Draco just closed his eyes, willing his headache away. "Not this morning, love. I'm just too tired. How about some porridge."
"Alex, do you want to go with Lyra to see Harry? He's awake now, and he'll be happy to see you."
He pushed out around Harry and approached the stage, looking through a book of songs, and Harry watched the flashing lights reflecting off his blond hair.
Draco was quiet for a minute, but when he spoke, his voice was soft. "What's your favourite flavour of ice cream?"
"It appears so," Potter answered, looking put out and avoiding Draco's eyes. "I guess I'll just go down to the canteen and get some soup."
Papa says that it's what you think of as family that really matters, and that blood or adoptions have nothing to do with it. Papa is pretty smart, so he must be right.
"—I'm so glad you can come," Gathii was saying, pulling Draco into a close embrace.
Molly watched them and smiled, then stood, brushing out the long skirt of her robes and walking over to the counter to finish preparing whatever she was cooking. "Did Harry take Lyra upstairs then? She definitely needed a time out. She was getting cheeky, telling me how I should go about reprimanding Alex."
She didn't say anything, just let him stew until he continued.
"Cheese, Potter. Lovely French cheese." He held up a baguette and bowl of grapes and berries. "This is wonderful. How'd you know my favourite cheeses?"
"So I've decided you need to have a night out," Draco said, flopping down on the common room couch next to Harry. "We need to come up with some way for you to get out and flaunt yourself to the
Like many little boys, Teddy went through phases of intense interest when he was young — trains, dragons, frogs, weather…The stories of Amil first took form when Teddy was temporarily obsessed with everything related to boats. From rowboats to cruise ships, Teddy had questions about them all, and anyone hoping to have a discussion with him at any length needed to be ready to discuss water-faring vessels and answer questions.
"What? Why?" Harry turned his full attention onto the young woman before him. Her jet black hair and severe fringe framed her pale face in the evening light, but she didn't look concerned, so Harry tried to force his unexplained worry away.
Harry looked over, surprised. "You sing?"
She let the sobs out freely now, soaking Teddy's t-shirt and getting it all snotty before she pulled back. "Sorry," she muttered.
He looked over at Alex then back to his friend. "I'll go over to the Burrow for a bit. I could use a shower too." He nodded at the boy. "He needs to be cleaned up too."
Like a house-elf. The puzzle pieces began to snap into place, and Draco suddenly had so many questions he had to ask, he had to know, and as much as he didn't want to hear the answers, he
"Harry—"
Harry turned to find Hermione and pulled her closer. "What the fuck is karaoke?"
Teddy rubbed her back slowly. "I don't know. I don't think anyone really understands. Draco probably does because he seems to get Harry in a way nobody else can, but the rest of us? That's why he's famous, Lye. Because he's done this amazing thing the rest of us can't even imagine, and he did it because that's what needed to be done to win the war and save everyone."
"Not-enemies? Is that even a word?" Harry chuckled, though his stomach clenched at the implication.
Harry barked out a laugh, and Draco grinned. Lyra's special paint set had been a major point of contention between the children, and Draco had already bought a set for Alex to unwrap for Christmas.
I was angry, I knew that. Gathii had broken my friend's heart, and I didn't want to see that happen again. I was also disappointed because the day I'd planned hadn't come to fruition. Simon would say both of those feelings were natural, that they were normal.
He looked down at his daughter, who had been so strong through this entire debacle. "Come here," he said, holding out his arms and scooping her up as she reached him. She giggled when he held her tight. "I'll make some of the sugared bananas and put them on top. How does that sound?"
"Do you think…" Harry trailed off, sounding more hesitant than Draco hardly ever heard him anymore. Harry was confident in his adulthood. This wasn't like him.
for?"
She let out a little hum. "Yeah, I think so. She's five, Draco. She's already wondering what time you're coming to pick her up."
I couldn't look away. "Draco…"
Harry closed his eyes and sighed. Draco's job with the Department of International Magical Cooperation had him travelling nearly as much as Harry did with his photography. It was one of the reasons they decided to move in together so soon. One or the other was gone so often that when they were both home, they wanted that home to be in the same place.
would be worth it?" asked Draco.
"You have no idea," she agreed. "Emergency-placement foster homes are generally only used when other, pre-approved homes aren't available. However, given the circumstances, Helen thinks we might be able to make it work."
"You're going to take his bloody side, aren't you? You're going to tell me that he was just looking out for me, that I was too young to hear it, but this is my life, my family's story, and they didn't tell me. My dad died!"
Dudley's text came in early Sunday. The funeral service and burial would be the next morning followed by a reception back at the Dursleys' house in Surrey. Harry'd looked horrified when he'd heard the plans but nodded and went about setting out a suit to wear.
"Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk."
"You might as well sit. This is going to be uncomfortable enough without you looming."
Draco stood, ready to rush around and catch Teddy, if necessary. "Get back into that bed. You're too weak to be up and around yet."
"Did they? Who are 'they'?"
"It's going to be horrible," he said, louder now, winding himself up again. "All those people are going to be horrible."
Draco just raised an eyebrow.
"Come on. I reserved a booth near the stage." Draco began to pull Harry and Pansy behind him, and the others followed.
"Tell me."
Draco let out a low hum, the sound he made when he didn't agree but wasn't going to argue. He didn't make that sound often, as he did love to bicker.
