He looks down, miserable. Without warning, Harry finds himself swallowing thickly, his eyes prickling with unshed tears. “
“What I’m doing? Neville, I’m not running a Squib charity project! I’ve hired Lee to be my assistant. She tells me she’s going to work hard, that she can do basically what a witch can do, and I believe her. Besides, doesn’t Granger work for Magical Creatures? House-elves, werewolves, goblins, et cetera? What’s she got to do with Squibs?”
Draco bit back a sarcastic retort. He might not be on top form, exactly, but he wasn’t stupid, and he knew when it was time to set aside his pride. Besides, he was desperate to know the answer.
told him to wait, so he shut it again. He was interested, sure, but he wasn’t sure why the news couldn’t have waited for Neville’s next visit.
The door closed. Gentle footsteps padded closer, and a cool cloth was pressed to his brow. Water dripped down into his hair, seeping unpleasantly into the sheets.
This place, too, Draco recognised. A group of witches in smart blue robes were perched on a row of metal chairs just outside the doors, smiling and chatting pleasantly. Draco had sat there, once, hands bound, waiting while the Wizengamot inside decided his fate. Lightheaded, he swallowed down the bile that rose in his throat.
The shop looked almost exactly as it had the last time he’d entered at age eleven – vast shelves on either side straining with the weight of a thousand boxes, the scent of sawdust lingering in the air. Draco could practically taste the excitement of generations of young witches and wizards, stood in this very spot, raw magic waiting to be tamed, their futures stretching out before them. He felt sentimental, hollowed out, as he thought of his own wand. Of all it had done, in the end. He took deep, steadying breaths – and as he did, he spotted a few subtle changes to the shop he remembered. Firstly, someone had carefully dusted and painted each shelf in beautiful, rich jewel tones, which brightened the place up considerably. And secondly, the person stood behind the counter was
Much to his chagrin, though, Draco didn’t bump into Potter all evening. A couple of times, Draco felt sure Potter had been making his way purposely towards him through the crowds, only for one of them to be steered away at the last minute. But, somehow, every time Draco finished a conversation and glanced up, his eyes were immediately drawn to Potter’s location. And Potter’s intense gaze was always on Draco too – burning through him, making his heart pound and his throat dry up. No matter what Draco did in response – smile, raise his glass, quirk an eyebrow – Potter just continued to watch Draco until his attention was required elsewhere.
…and Draco did. He’d been restocking the shelves as Harry darted in, his concentration lapsing for barely a second, but still long enough to send jars of newt eyes crashing to the floor. People were shouting questions from the street, and reflections from camera lenses aimed through the window made the sunlight flicker strangely through the shop. Draco had tugged Harry straight through to the lab, slamming the door behind them. They’d leant against the bookshelf to try and catch their breaths, peals of laughter echoing across the room.
look exhausting, Harry found it an altogether very pleasant sight, relishing the opportunity to unashamedly admire the play of Malfoy’s muscles beneath the shifting black fabric as he darted this way and that. It took longer than expected, but eventually he returned, face flushed and glowing, a single golden wing fluttering helplessly from between his clenched fingers.
The night wore on; the minutes ticking down far more slowly than they had any right to. The wizard from the Ministry was fast asleep and snoring softly, and so, little by little, play ground to a halt. The Chasers tossed the Quaffle reluctantly back and forth, arguing forcefully about whether anyone would find out if they had a quick kip on the grass. The Beaters shook their aching arms, but even the Bludgers seemed to have accepted the general air of apathy, their movements becoming sluggish and easy to avoid.
It still took several days of agonising and a long discussion with his Mind Healer before Draco could put it off no longer. But he couldn’t do this alone – he needed Lee’s help. And so, come Friday lunchtime, dread settling in the pit of his stomach, Draco changed his shop sign to ‘Closed’ and finally worked up the courage to ask her.

use was a bad idea, and he knew that he was already becoming too reliant on the potion. He didn’t like the way it blurred his thought process, or the way he couldn’t quite recall events after he’d sobered up. Draco had always been a perfectionist, agonising over small decisions and replaying them in his head.
“It’s not the horse,” said Draco as they both stared up at the enormous chalk figure before them. His chin was raised, eyes narrowed, defying Harry to disagree.
He was sitting opposite Crowson, behind a heavy metal desk. There were four onlookers – Aurors, from the uniforms – standing against the wall, directly in his line of vision. He didn’t recognise any of them, and they all pointedly ignored his desperate attempts to make eye contact. His hands were straight out in front of him, bound together with magical restraints.
, Draco. I told you about Finnigan. I told you about that Durmstrang guy I sucked off at the end of fourth year. I even told you when I lost my virginity―”
“What the fuck is wrong with you? Been hanging out with Longbottom and your lovely new Gryffindor friends a bit much, have you? All their sanctimonious shit rubbing off on you?”
-d crockery – and they both stared out of the windows into the grey landscape beyond. In any other circumstance, the silence would have felt awkward, loaded, and Draco would have hurried to fill it – but today he could feel only that constant, exciting tingle of possibility. Longbottom was here for a reason. Things were exactly as they should be.
Draco winced a little as the voice reached a crescendo. He wished they would all just leave him alone. Except for the owner of the hand that was still lovingly stroking his forehead. They could stay, whoever they were.
His voice cracked on the last word, and he pulled back sharply, turning on his heel and storming away once more. Barely-contained magic crackled in his wake, the
Harry takes his time preparing Draco, holds his gaze as he slips first one finger, then a second, inside, watching him keen and squirm as though for the very first time. And Harry supposes it is, in a way; he can’t recall ever feeling this way before: surrounded by Draco; completely focussed, utterly entranced by the sighs and moans he makes, the way he bites his lip, the arch of his back as Harry moves inside him. All of it’s familiar, and yet all of it’s new. Harry watches him, thinking of their first time, their second time, all the times that came before.
Potter leaned slowly to the left, taking his weight off the chair arm and letting his injured thigh rest down on the seat. He sat back, without attempting to pull his trousers up. His legs were still pressed close together. Draco swallowed. He should definitely move. He should
Within moments, Harry’s body grew loose against him, his breathing deepening, as he drifted into an easy post-coital sleep. Only then did Draco finally allow a ridiculous, giddy smile to spread unchecked across his face. He watched, charmed, as Harry’s chest gradually lost its flush of exertion, as his fingers twitched occasionally against Draco’s side.
As one they turned. Harry pointed the handle of his broom down and dropped into a dive, aching arms jerkily adjusting for the Snitch’s trajectory, the cold morning air sharp on his face as he gathered speed. He didn’t take his eyes off the tiny golden ball for a second, but he knew all the same: he was neck and neck with Malfoy; the other man’s body only inches away, his soft grunts of exertion ringing like thunder in Harry’s ears. The Snitch sped between the trees, forcing them both to duck and weave to avoid low-hanging branches, until, finally, mere feet from the muddy ground, Harry found himself within touching distance. Using every ounce of his remaining energy, he edged forward, his legs gripping the very front of his broom handle. He leaned, and leaned – and Malfoy leaned too, his arm pressed against Harry’s, and―
“Actually, I… I wanted to ask you something.” Potter looked towards Lee, helplessly. She grinned straight back at him, feigning ignorance.
. His wandering eyes lit on Mrs Gibson’s window, and – was it his imagination, or was that her curtain twitching?
“I really mean it. I know we haven’t had a chance to talk properly about the other day, about what it meant. But there’s no excuse now that you remember everything that happened. You can’t pretend that what you had before was just – just sexual attraction. You know it was more than that for him. I care about you both, and I won’t have him hurt again. So if it’s just a quick shag you’re looking for –”
One long, painful, silent minute later, Harry shook his head as if to clear it. He walked across the room, gathering up his clothes and shoes haphazardly in his arms, before turning back to Draco. His bloodshot eyes sparkled in the dim light.
rejected, after all – had caused him to do something stupid and hurtful. Something which he could possibly have written off as a bit of fun for old times’ sake, if Theo hadn’t told him about Daphne. Thank goodness sense had prevailed when it did.
, Crowson had drawled, smirking, as hot tears of fury streamed unbidden down Draco’s face. And Harry had seen it all.
As she dissolved into giggles, Draco pounced, wrestling the letter back before stuffing it into his pocket. “Bugger off! It says no such thing.”
“Oh, no! No, no. Not that often, not at all. We get a lot of gnomes, you see. Quite the infestation, really. I only call him when they get totally out of contr – oh Merlin, look, there he goes with another one!”
The library dissolves quickly, its golden chandeliers replaced with dim, flickering sconces as you find yourself right there, for the thousandth time: your old lab, back at the Ministry. Your younger self sits hunched, miserably, over a cauldron, biting his lip in concentration. The door crashes open, and your heart skips a beat, but young Draco only flinches, squinting closer at the murky solution.
He’s in Apulia when they catch up with him, renting a dusty trullo from an ancient Italian woman a half mile down the track. The timing couldn’t have been worse, with the neighbours’ sideways looks finally giving way to tentative nods; even the occasional chuckle at the posh accent cutting through his rough, colloquial Italian. His delicate skin is no longer blistered scarlet, beginning to darken at last under the dry sun, and his hair curls around his nape, long enough these days to tie out of his eyes when he has to bend forward to feed the chickens. And then there’s this place, surrounded by olive trees – nowhere near the furthest he’s run, although it feels as though it might be – his little hut on the edge of the world.
Harry took his hand, casual as anything, as Draco closed the flat door behind them. The stairs were far too narrow for two people to walk down side-by-side but neither of them made a move to let go, and so, feeling lovesick and a bit foolish, Draco led the way. And then all at once they were back in the lab together, Harry sinking down into his old chair, making offhand remarks about the differences since the last time he’d been here – that it was messier, mostly – as though absolutely
It must have been written all over his face, because as he began moving towards Harry, Ron stepped forwards, thrusting an arm out between them. He clasped Draco’s hand with a tight, “Settle down, children,” which had Draco blushing, pumping it forcefully up and down in an enthusiastic show. He was wearing a wide smile, which was slightly strained and clearly for the benefit of the bystanders.
Harry breathes in, hard, trying to reason with himself. It’s too difficult, though, with Draco so close; after everything that’s happened over the past hour. So he stops thinking – stops worrying – and says what he’s needed to say from the moment he saw Draco leaning against their old front steps.
“Oh,” breathed Harry, glazed eyes coming back into focus, gaze darting rapidly over Draco’s face. “Oh,” he repeated, brow furrowed. “And since?”
“No, it’s not… it’s not that,” Theo got out, shuffling right to the end of the bed. He was looking down at the floor. “It’s – well, I’ve just started seeing someone.”
-augmented anticipation that he could hardly listen to a word Potter was saying. Instead, he found himself standing just a little too close, laughing a smidge too loud, even inventing orders which would require him to lean over Potter for ingredients – so desperate was he for a repeat of Sunday evening.
Back on the noisy platform, where every year as you wave and smile, you steal a sideways glance at Harry. Every year, you’re startled to find flecks of grey in that familiar black hair and deep lines scoring his once-smooth skin. Every year you watch the Weasley bitch fuss around the children, jealousy curled up in your throat, forcing spiteful words onto the tip of your tongue.
, had seemed to exist only in different shades of grey – became brighter again, and moved back into sharp focus. He found that he was able to concentrate for longer, to hold down conversations better, to walk out into wizarding London without starting to hyperventilate and having to Apparate home. He began regaining some of the weight he’d lost – the pads of his cheeks filling out again, his ribs no longer so unattractively prominent – and regular sleep helped his skin lose its sallow, ashy appearance. Two weeks spent mostly in bed had left him wheezing like an old man and his weakened calf muscles complaining bitterly the first time he climbed the stairs to his flat, but busy shop work and lunchtime walks quickly set him right. He even visited Dean at Ollivanders, and they made tentative plans to go flying together.
to be enjoying himself as they waited for the match to begin. Harry watched, amused, as he pushed his way right to the front of the crowd for the
Draco affected a fake smile, stepping aside to allow a house-elf to Vanish the broken glass. Collins had been an irritating little Ministry sycophant years ago, and he was no more than that now. Besides, they were in the Ministry itself, with hundreds of other people milling around. He was hardly likely to draw his wand. The best thing Draco could do was keep calm.
“I don’t know,” counters Draco, eyebrow raised. “You’ve had fifteen years of chasing me – what about you?”
“No. It wasn’t pity. Not exactly. You know,” he went on, slowly, apparently oblivious to the inferno bubbling up inside Draco, “I never knew my mother. But I know what she did for me – that I survived the unsurvivable purely because of how much she loved me. With you – look, I’d always assumed that you were like your father. Blinkered, prejudiced, malicious, whatever. At school, you acted like you were so proud to be serving Voldemort. Like it made you something special…”
. He'd spent a long time with his Mind Healer revisiting the painful events of last year’s ball, and his memories of that evening were pretty clear – his feelings of invulnerability, of power, of being

Pansy sat back, disappointed. Suddenly she jerked upright, as though she’d been kicked under the table. Before Draco could react, she looked towards Lee, who shot Draco a wicked grin before bringing her fist to her mouth while simultaneously poking her tongue into her cheek – the universal sign for a blow job. Pansy laughed delightedly.
must be working overtime, Draco thought wryly, as they were all far more friendly – and less suspicious – than his history probably warranted.
“No,” Harry repeated, shaking his head slowly. His eyes glittered, a tentative smile pulling at the corner of his lips. “I don’t think I can go back to being friends. I don’t want to be your friend, Draco.”
, Harry wants to shout. His body’s tense, jittery with adrenaline, his fingers itching to grab the key and open the bloody thing himself. But he manages to suppress the urge, waits patiently – smile stretched too tight across his face – until finally,
only made things worse. Potter’s eyes widened comically, breaths shallow, as Draco’s treacherous brain spilled forth a deluge of images.
Stubborn to the last, Lucius Malfoy clung to life far longer than anyone expected. It wasn’t until late January – fittingly, the coldest day of the year – that a Ministry representative arrived at the front gates, bearing the dreaded letter of condolence. Draco immediately declined to accompany his mother to Azkaban to view the body. As she glanced over at him, fury behind her damp eyes, Draco steeled himself for a tirade about his cowardice or lack of filial duty – but his mother merely lifted her chin and swept past without a word, heels crunching along the icy path.
. It happened in early spring, almost three years after he’d opened the shop. Potter stopped by around lunchtime as usual, but, for the first time, actually made a purchase. As Draco was ringing up the six ounces of salamander blood, he teased Potter, of course, about his lack of Potions abilities – something about how he’d better be careful not to blow up his house – when Potter blushed and said that actually, he was buying it for someone else. His tone – not to mention his difficulty meeting Draco’s eyes – left Draco in no doubt exactly who the recipient was. That very morning, under the headline ‘Golden Boy’s Sizzling New Fling’, the
. Starving and keyed up, clothes stinking of cigarettes, a sour taste in his mouth, ears still buzzing from the club. He hums snatches of songs as he searches high and low; there has to be food about
Although his voice sounded distant and muffled, Harry’s reversion to the use of his surname rang clear as a bell through Draco’s consciousness. Draco took a deep breath and tried again, mouth opening and closing of its own accord like a Plimpy out of water.
“Coming back here… it was an exchange, at first. The Ministry requested my assistance with a case involving a few of my dad’s old friends. I was supposed to go back after six months but… well, let’s just say that by then I had a few good reasons to stay.”
Someone had set up a selection of lawn chairs – uncomfortable looking fold-up things – although, unsurprisingly, no-one was sitting down. Most of the other players were gathered around the refreshment stand, inspecting the remaining fare – egg sandwiches, mostly, along with a few bowls of limp salad, a handful of Tunnock’s Teacakes and a plate of orange slices. Aurors and Unspeakables alike ate in silence, shifting their weight from leg to aching leg, expressions ranging from despondent to mutinous. The crowd had thinned out slightly, but there were still a good number of people milling about. These included Ginny and George, who were leaning over the flimsy barriers, yelling at Ron and doing crude impressions of his ducking and diving about, and, as usual, a few – these days, middle-aged – witches yelling Harry’s name and holding out stuff for him to sign. He normally didn’t mind too much, but today, he ignored them completely. He was knackered, and a bit fed up… and besides, all his attention was taken up by Malfoy, who was chatting animatedly to one of the spectators, waving a teacake in the air.
To Draco’s eternal frustration, the only person he saw neither hide nor hair of was Harry himself. When Draco asked about him – and he asked just about everyone he could think of – they either looked uncomfortable or changed the subject. Finally, when he’d badgered Ron for approximately the tenth time, Ron had rolled his eyes and snapped at Draco that Harry obviously didn’t want to see him, did he, or he’d have stopped by himself. So that was that, and Draco tried to put it out of his mind.
Lee snickered, and Draco gave her a stern look. He sometimes wished Pansy would be a little less… Pansy. Not twenty minutes ago, Lee had been practically incandescent with excitement to see the first snow of the year, face young and delighted as she held out her hand for flakes, watching them drift lazily down and melt under the warming charm. Now she was giggling at Pansy’s sex jokes. It made his head ache.
“I don’t know,” Lee continued, tucking the phone away in the back of her jeans. “Owls remind me of school – passing love letters across the classroom and all that. I always thought it killed the romance. I mean―” She reached over suddenly, snatching the letter from Draco’s hand as he howled in protest, and unravelling it to reveal Harry’s spidery script. “Case in point! Just
. Draco, Lee, this is Lila Lowell, Head of Creature Welfare in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.”
“Look, Harry barely trusted anyone before all this, and then he thought there was something real between you, and it turned out that you’d been lying to him the whole time. And he couldn’t get angry with you, because you were really ill, and none of us even knew if you’d recover. He refused to take you to St Mungo’s – he was supposed to be out on some important job that weekend too, he had to lie to Kingsley about being sick so he could look after you – and you can’t even remember all the time you spent together when you were on
really made any difference to Draco; he hadn’t bothered to keep track of the days once they began to blur together in the first few months after his trial. He didn’t need to look at a calendar to know that he’d wasted a whole year of his life. Imprisoned in his childhood home, he wandered from room to room, invented pointless ways to pass the days and shouted at the house-elf – all the while, trying desperately not to think about the future. The folded
Luna floats down the aisle in a sunflower-yellow dress, a crown of scarlet radishes atop golden curls. Draco leans over, opens his mouth. “Not one word, Malfoy,” warns Harry, elbowing him pointedly.
. Then Dumbledore’s body had fallen limp from the tower, and hot tears of shame had stained his cheeks as Snape tugged him through the corridors, muttering angrily:
Before Draco could respond, a crowd of tourists shoved roughly past them, headed by a chirpy guide holding a yellow umbrella high above her head, rattling off names and dates as she went.
Harry’s lips twitched upwards in a smile, which quickly turned into a yawn. “Don’t be daft. Mmm. C’mere now.” Without turning away, he Summoned a blanket, tucking it languidly over them both, and slung his free arm over Draco.
He was only mere steps from the bathroom when Draco realised, with dawning horror, that unlike Theo, unlike Lee in the lab, unlike Collins at the Manor, Harry
“Did it?” said Draco, recoiling in mock horror. “Don’t worry, I’ll be careful not to do that again.” Neville snorted.
Despite the t-shirt he’d hastily pulled on over his pyjama bottoms, Draco felt strangely naked without his wand as he padded barefoot down the hall. He wasn’t sure why he was so apprehensive. An intruder was hardly likely to light a fire and sit down at the kitchen table, after all.
“Yes, yes, the heath, I know, I can see!” Draco’s exasperation is plain, and as the door slams shut, Harry allows himself a tiny, fond smile.
things, for once. He felt a surge of affection, of companionship, as though he and Malfoy were the only two people in the sky – in the world, perhaps. Like this, he could tell Malfoy anything, and so it made total sense that the next words which passed those parted lips were, “So while we’re sharing, Potter, will you humour me?”
It was so unexpected, this desire for nothing more than Harry’s lips on his, for Harry’s scent all over him, for the way his nails rasped gently up the back of Draco’s scalp. Of course, Draco had kissed many men before, but usually on packed dance floors, mouths crashing together in lieu of a verbal introduction. Draco had always gone out looking for sex, and so
. I got it into my head that I’d keep away from you for a year, and maybe see how I felt after that. I thought I was doing a pretty good job, too.” He laughed. “Of course, I didn’t account for your sheer bloody-mindedness. Or Pansy Parkinson, for that matter.”
But despite that, and even accounting for his frequent impulsive donations to charity, money from the business was pouring in faster than Draco knew what to do with. Word was spreading, and the Owl Orders were stacking up, making it fortunate that Draco had recently been experimenting with ways to shorten the brewing times of his most common potions.
When he first realised he’d developed a bit of a crush on Malfoy, he hadn’t been alarmed. It wasn’t the first time he’d found a co-worker attractive; at least in Malfoy’s case half the Ministry seemed to agree with him. He still didn’t much fancy hearing Ron’s opinion on the matter though, so he kept the details of Malfoy’s little visits to himself – and for some weird reason, he got the impression that Malfoy did too.
’s best efforts to distract him. Come four o’clock, he sent her home early and trudged upstairs, attempting to collect his thoughts. Draco might have done many idiotic things, but he wasn’t an idiot. He was quite aware that his trains of thought had become muddled and distorted.
“The day after Valentine’s. It was raining, and Harry ducked into the shop to avoid the reporters outside. He’d had that awful date, you remember…”
Draco stopped, leaning against a tree, so Harry did too. They watched for a while as groups of teenagers piled out of the vehicles, lighting up cigarettes, climbing onto roofs and bonnets. The headlights painted intersecting stripes of light up onto the hillside. Some of the men, all dressed in grey or black tracksuits, started checking out the cars, while others busily passed around six-packs of cider. A group of girls wearing identical-looking fringed leather jackets and miniskirts were huddled around the back of a van, shivering in the fresh September air as they decanted spirits into half-empty coke bottles. Harry watched, vaguely appalled, as old cans and fast-food wrappers were ejected from windows, left to lay on the ground or blow away in the wind.
The bruising had receded, and the scar was growing paler still. Slowly, deliberately, Draco reached out lightly and touched it again.
“Malfoy, you should really consider speaking to Hermione. She’d love to come and talk to Lee. She’d think it’s great what you’re doing, hiring her.”
Lee regarded the chair with undisguised distaste. She reached for Draco’s hand, grasping it tightly in hers.
The bench rocked suddenly as a couple landed next to them, snogging as though their lives depended on it. The man’s hands were running up and down the girl’s legs as they spread themselves out across the seat. Draco shifted instinctively to avoid them, pressing Harry’s body uncomfortably into the arm of the bench. Harry swallowed. A greasy old newspaper cone rolled past their feet, bits of battered fish still stuck to the inside.
As Harry cast a wandless warming charm, apparently in lieu of bothering with a cloak, Draco went to find Lee. She was less than thrilled to see him, interrupting his, “Are you sure you’ll be okay to―” with a quick “
Draco grinned and joined him on the staircase, wiping his hand gleefully on Harry’s trousers. He sprawled out over Harry’s body – his own erection peeking insistently above his waistband, smearing pre-come on his stomach – and kissed Harry on the nose. He suddenly found himself laughing again, joy bubbling up unbidden, bright and loud.
“If you’re serious about changing, making things right – not that it will, but if you want to at least try, you should stop calling me Longbottom.” He shifted back in his seat. “It always makes me feel eleven years old again.”
She seizes the boy, propelling him roughly forward. He’s barely there: reed-thin, milky-pale. Vengeful magic sizzles inside Harry’s clenched fist.
’s coverage of Crowson’s assault and arrest as though nothing had ever happened, leaving Draco disappointed, and unbelievably frustrated. He was used to getting exactly what he wanted, as soon as he wanted it, and once again, Potter was proving an exception to the rule. Draco wasn’t sure what was going on. Perhaps the Quidditch match had proven to
memories were there, he could feel them: distorted, like shapes moving underwater, out of focus and always slipping just beyond his reach. Trying to recover even a single one was exhausting. But what else could he do?
As the final few minutes ticked down, a small crowd began to gather again, cheering and shouting, and the mood amongst the players finally improved – their exhilaration tinged with an edge of exhausted hysteria. Harry himself was half-relieved and half-dismayed, wondering what would happen next as he inched his broomstick a little closer towards Malfoy’s.
bright, she was very hard-working, and most importantly, she was fantastic with the customers. The older patrons were delighted with the novelty, and would watch, bemused, as she used a stepladder instead of
Your favourite bit next, as the sun sets and they wander slowly back, stopping for lazy kisses against palm trees, faces shining pink with stubble-rash and sunburn. They barely make it up the stairs this time before they’re pulling each other to the floor, tearing off clothes, always insatiable. The fight for dominance ends with Harry bending young Draco over the sofa and pounding into him. Their cries echo through the apartment and out of the open doors, mingling with the sounds of the city outside. Your own strokes become faster now, more insistent, as you move to stand behind Harry. You ghost your free hand over the lines of his hips, tracing the muscles of his thighs, his arse, admiring the way it flexes with every thrust, drinking in every single detail this one last, glorious time. Harry’s breathing hitches, his movements growing erratic, and your hand works fast and frantic. Young Draco moans, and you follow suit, and soon you’re all three sighing out your release. Your younger self turns back towards Harry, traces a lazy finger down his face, limbs loose, smile utterly content.
“He’s getting worse, Harry. I don’t know how much more he can take. He needs to go to St Mungo’s. I’m going to Floo call my boss.”
She nodded, faint creases bracketing her eyes as that familiar smile warmed her face. “You didn’t need to, we know already. We can see you’re trying, Draco. I told you before, this happened in all the cases I read about. Every single one had real difficulties after
– and that could never happen. Pansy was as sharp as a tack when it came to uncovering secrets, and she knew Draco as well as anyone – it would be a disaster. That left the weekends, then. Yes, better to arrange a weekend meet up – play things down and wait for her to get bored with his lack of gossip.
Bare minutes later and they’re out on the balcony, watching the world wake up. It’s so peaceful: cornflower skies still hazy with sleep, car horns and voices floating up from below, a breeze rustling the boulangerie bags strewn across the table. As you watch, Harry leans forward, swiping a gentle thumb over the flakes of croissant still stuck to the corner of young Draco’s lips. Young Draco smiles then, brings his own hands up to Harry’s face, moves to kiss him deeply. He’s only 22, so he’s always ready. Your own strokes are firmer now, and when Harry’s hand trails down to the bulge in your younger self’s shorts you watch him take hold of it, a wicked smile spreading across his face as he guides it under his waistband.
“What, sobriety? Oh, great fun.” Harry’s brows furrowed at the careless reply, and Draco hastened to clarify. “No, it’s – I’m good. I haven’t taken a potion or had a drink now in―” He thought for a second. “Six months, three weeks and six days.”

Something along those lines, anyway. Dined out on it a few times, you’ll be pleased to know. Even got me laid once.” He raised an imaginary glass in Harry’s direction.
Potter just stood there, folded his arms and narrowed his eyes, waves of fury emanating from him so strongly that Draco felt physically repelled by the force of his magic.
still months away from completion, Draco resumed his attempts to inventory the contents of the house with renewed vigour. Whoever had looted the estate in the name of reparations had done a thorough job; from the attics to the cellars, everything not under a permanent sticking charm had either been destroyed or removed. The contents of the storeroom would sell, and a few damaged pieces might be salvageable after a careful
Kingsley had indeed brought a trophy, of sorts. It was about three inches tall and bore an uncanny resemblance to the glass owl paperweight which usually graced the Ministry reception desk directly opposite the Floos. Nevertheless, Malfoy put on his most charming smile for the cameras – and resolutely ignored its persistent hoots – as he lifted it high into the air. He made quite a sight – soaked through, and plastered from head to toe in mud – and as the journalists crowded around, his knackered teammates attempted to lift him over their heads. Ron kicked the ground sulkily.
“So, the Dark Mark, yeah? Bet you were really proud the day you got that done, eh? Something you’d wanted for a while?”
“George had to remortgage the shop to end up the highest bidder,” said Harry with a grin, “and he still reckons it was worth every Knut.”
… well, it hardly bore thinking about. Malfoy’s numbing charm had worn off completely a couple of hours ago, and Harry could
He paced up and down, up and down, as for the first time in months the warm, comforting sensation of
He grabbed his pants and trousers from where they lay strewn on the floor and tugged them back on. He could definitely find his way back to the drawing room – maybe he could Floo home, sort himself out, and return when his nerves had settled?
; it’s up on the kitchen wall, for Merlin’s sake. Colour-coded and everything. And d’you know what the last thing she said to me before all this was?”
The moment stretched out between them, both of them breathing sharp and fast. Harry’s hands were still splayed, hot and insistent, halfway up Draco’s thighs – mere inches from his cock, which was growing more interested by the second. Draco swallowed, and again, until finally, driven half-crazy with longing, he pulled himself away from the taut anticipation of Harry’s body, shuffling back across the counter.
The days continued to tick by apace. Time was like that, Draco had found – whenever you wished for it to slow down, it would laugh in your face, and suddenly you’d find yourself another week closer to a future you didn’t really want. And it was becoming inevitable now: Draco’s speech had returned, his physical symptoms had improved, his cravings had (mostly) subsided. Alongside all that, he had learned to make sandwiches, and coffee, had cleaned his kitchen the Muggle way, had read several issues of
The room designed for welcoming foreign dignitaries and high-ranking officials must have already been one of the most opulent and exquisitely decorated of the Ministry’s public chambers. For the evening’s event, though, it had been expanded and repurposed effectively as a ballroom, to stunning effect. In the centre was a huge gleaming dance floor, and along one edge a stage was set up for a small orchestra, although only the front few seats were occupied – by a string quartet, who were playing a lively waltz. Surrounding the whirling couples were cherry trees, appearing to grow directly out of the parquet floor; their blossom-laden branches extending towards the middle and swaying gently in time to the music. Draco could even see several pairs of bullfinches, the males with their distinctive pink breasts, fluttering around at the top.
for your help at various points, and to everyone else on the Drarry Microfic Discord who has put up with me harping on about this fic for months on end; you’re all fabulous ❤
Draco didn’t recognise the voice, but then he could hardly hear a thing over the ringing in his ears. A shadow fell over him, before a foot to his ribs forced him over onto his back. He blinked up at the man smirking down at him, recognising it barely a second before a large glob of spit landed smack in the middle of his forehead. It slid sideways to the ground, breeze cooling the wet trail it left. Draco blinked, and the scornful face overhead came into focus. His breath died in his throat.
, I’m sorry, all right? Merlin, I’m trying to be honest here! I wish I’d never gone. I hated every second of it, Draco. I’ve got no excuse, but I can’t exactly take it back now, can I?”
Surprised, Draco quickly complied. Harry swung his legs over to settle on top of the duvet, leaning back against the headboard with a deep groan, closing his eyes.
Draco sat back and stared at the words he’d – apparently – written. It wasn’t as formal as his previous efforts, but that was probably not a bad thing. Sounding like a pretentious twat was unlikely to endear him to Longbottom, after all. It was also disturbingly earnest, and certainly more Gryffindor than anything he’d ever written before. And what about that last line?
“All right, then.” She stepped back, all business once more, reaching under the counter and pulling out his wand. She swished it around a bit, expression wistful. “I’ve kept it safe for you. God, you have no idea how much I wanted one of these growing up.” She gave it one last ineffectual wave before huffing a laugh and throwing it across to Draco.
Not knowing quite how to bring it up, Draco hadn’t mentioned that Neville would be visiting. But his mother – ever the skilful hostess – greeted Neville warmly and without batting an eyelid, as though Gryffindors wandering across the Manor lawns and enquiring about the strengthening charms in her pruning shears was an everyday occurrence. His mother asked politely after Neville’s grandmother and listened patiently to his long explanation of his work at Hogwarts. When he asked whether she would mind showing him the gardens, she explained apologetically that she’d be happy to, if he would kindly bear in mind that she’d only just resumed tending the gardens – after, well, all that most
But with no time spent sober where he could process what was happening, no chance to come up for air, Draco found himself sucked deeper and deeper into his fabricated world. The control he’d prided himself on in his early days of
guide his writing as it wished, and trying to ignore the stark reminders of his teenage wrongdoings, Draco scribbled until his fingers cramped and the lines swam before his eyes. He called for Itti, who stumbled off to the owlery, staggering under the enormous pile of parchment rolls.
Draco looked away, still affecting nonchalance. “Well, thanks for telling me. At least I won’t have to suffer through the Cannons getting massacred for a fourth time.”
This was nothing like the matches Draco had attended with his father, where they’d been crammed into the posh Ministry box like Bowtruckles in a Wiggentree, with house-elves bringing refreshments and warming charms built into the seats. Draco checked his ticket for the hundredth time, frowning – why would
Ron’s cough was loud and pointed. Harry let go, stepping backwards. “Great! That’s settled then. I’ll see you later, Draco.”
And then one morning, Hannah came in around sunrise, dressed in bright green robes, cheerfully whispering that she was off to work. He was to take his vitamins, and keep up with his speech and physical exercises, and she’d be back in the evening to check on him.
“No, I think it’s a great idea,” said Neville. “Hermione’s been looking into rights for Squi – Wizarding-Adjacents. It might be worth having a chat with her. You know, if you’re into that kind of thing now.”
“Just a few more for the full set then! Here’s hoping!” With one final slightly-too-hard pat which had Ron stumbling forwards slightly, Draco stepped back. Ron was grinning, genuine this time. “I’m sure Harry wouldn’t mind arranging an Auror detail, if you’re worried.”
“Damn right you will.” Harry looked back up nervously, before relaxing at the sight of Draco’s teasing smile. “Anyway, don’t apologise, it was just about the hottest thing I’ve ever seen.”
As they walked in silence around the rockery, Draco could feel the seed of the idea Neville had planted taking root in his
Out of practice as he was at large public gatherings – and certainly at formal events like this – Draco should, by rights, have felt embarrassed, or at least a little uncomfortable. In fact, he felt amazing.
, those were the same fingers which had caressed Potter’s bare skin. His fingers, which could so easily have undone buttons, tugged at hair, stroked over a stubbled jaw…
When he woke, it was early, and with Harry’s parting words ringing in his ears. One obvious disadvantage of remaining sober was the way the awful night’s events replayed themselves all too clearly in his mind. Lonely and despondent, Draco waited as long as he could before throwing his handful of Floo powder into the flames, and crouching, awkwardly, in front of the hearth.
Winter meandered into spring so gradually that Draco hardly noticed, until, one morning, he came downstairs to find that Itti, his mother’s single remaining house-elf, had set the breakfast table out on the terrace. There were buds on the wisteria and the peafowl were strutting around the lawns, enjoying the sunshine after a long winter. Draco didn’t blame them. Through the dark nights and miserable overcast days, he’d been unable to shake the dread that had settled over him like a shroud at his father’s funeral. But that day, looking up at the skylarks wheeling and circling in the cornflower sky, with the sun kissing his cheeks, Draco felt the pressure ease, just a little. There was a golden glimmer of hope on the horizon.
To Draco’s surprise, Potter frowned. “I think that I’m not in the mood for messing around, Draco. If this is another game―” He began to withdraw his arm.
Harry’s troubled voice was the last thing Draco heard as he fell gratefully back into unconsciousness.
Twenty minutes later, after Draco had pulled Harry over to the living room; after he’d tugged off Harry’s pants and Harry had Vanished his clothes – of course Draco had complained a bit, mostly for dramatic effect, until Harry had taken his hand and guided it to his still-swollen rim with a muttered, “look, I’m probably still ready after last time, but I might as well show you what I like,” and that had shut him right up – and after Draco’d had him again, over the back of the sofa this time, Harry’s come splashing obscenely across the silky fabric, Draco’s name on his lips, and after Draco had followed, silently, face buried against the nape of Harry’s neck: after all that, they’d curled up together amongst the cushions, warmed by the fire, and Draco had taken a deep breath and squeezed his eyes tight and opened his mouth before he lost his nerve.
.” Draco breathed, as Harry moved into him until he was pressed up against the counter, legs bracketed by Draco’s own. Harry’s hand stroked lightly, questioningly, along the length of Draco’s thigh, and Draco’s lips parted on a shaky exhale.
It was nothing like the first time, with that desperate, aching need for skin against skin after months of dancing around each other – nothing like the stairwell, or Harry’s frantic, jerking hand as he’d prepared himself, tension and anticipation and nerves dissolving into relief as they were finally joined, as they learned to move together. And it was nothing like the second time either – Draco edgy and exhausted and high on whispered confessions as he bent Harry over the sofa, confidence mounting, mesmerised by the way the muscles in Harry’s back rippled as he braced himself with every thrust. No, this third time was different. Draco could feel it in the way Harry settled over him, fingers stroking through his hair, tongue moving slow and sure against his own. He could see it in Harry’s expression, burning with desire yet still so hopelessly sincere; hard to look at directly, as though he was staring into the sun.
Draco played along, clapping Ron heartily on the back. “I don’t know, Weasel, let me think. Susan, Pansy, hmm… Millie gave me a good backhander once – put me right on the floor, that did. Oh, and how could I forget your
, Malfoy. You should grab a shower, bath, whatever, and get yourself dressed. I assume you haven’t eaten?” he asked, opening his palm to reveal a tiny cube. Draco shook his head. “Great. I’ve brought some pasta, I’ll heat it up.” The cube rapidly enlarged before Draco’s eyes until Harry was holding a full-sized plastic container. “We’ll eat, we’ll wait, then once it’s worn off, we’ll talk, all right?”
Suddenly, the smile fell from Malfoy’s face, and his head whirled around to the side. He tugged his wand easily from its soft leather holster and sent a flash of scarlet screaming across the pitch.
There was silence for a minute. The trembling had gentled now to just the occasional quiver, like the leaves of a Flutterby bush. The hand was back, stroking tenderly over Draco’s brow once more, and Draco’s mind began to wander, the voices fading into the distance, as he heeded the sweet siren call of sleep.
,” said Malfoy, emphatically. “I get it now, and I totally agree. It would be a terrible tragedy if your work got in the way of all the nude photoshoots.”
At first, Hannah popped by daily to check on Draco, asking all kinds of questions about his mood and waving her wand over him to read his vital signs. Gradually, her visits decreased, until she or Neville were only dropping in two or three times a week, usually Floo-calling Draco on the weekend. Some of their other friends also stopped by – Dean Thomas, some of the Diagon Quidditch team – all asking after Draco’s wellbeing. It seemed they’d all been told that he’d had some unspecified illness, and they all quickly waved Draco’s profuse apologies away. Even Ron turned up a few weeks in, ostensibly to sort out an issue with one his orders, but it was clear when he too grudgingly started questioning Draco about his health that he’d been press-ganged into checking up on him.
Pansy’s father was a barrister. Keen to distance the family from any lingering associations with Voldemort, he’d made arrangements for her to go straight from Hogwarts to his firm in Switzerland. There she’d worked – although to hear her tell it, there hadn’t been much of that going on – as a legal secretary for the first year, and was now back in England, partying, dating, and – occasionally – studying for the Bar.
full-time, of course). Aside from the obvious personal benefits – he could take some and then re-send those applications – he would certainly regain his status as a legend amongst the Slytherins. Imagine being able to offer almost unlimited access to
“You already have it. I’m back at Grimmauld now.” Harry says, grinning wryly at the look on Draco’s face.
Lee’s reply was indignant; Draco could practically hear her hands settling on her hips as she responded. “Who are you?”
“It’s not working, Harry. There’s no point in pretending.” He takes a shaky breath. “You know I’m right. Come on – let me –” He pats Harry’s knee, the touch almost unbearably casual, although he still doesn’t meet Harry’s eyes. Harry realises then; this isn’t Draco being impulsive. This was planned, carefully considered.
Draco kept his eyes closed. The hand on his head was gentle and kind, thumb stroking through the stubble of his hair. He’d like to stay here. This seemed like a nice place to be.
“I do reckon you’re a bit mental, though,” Neville continued. “Potions is the worst part of my bloody apprenticeship. I know it sounds stupid, but I didn’t realise how much would be involved. Obviously, I knew I’d have to mix all the basic first aid stuff for the Infirmary, but Pomona brews loads of other potions too. I suppose I’d rather hoped that Snape was being a vicious bastard and I wasn’t actually all that bad.”
Lost for words, Harry could only gape at Malfoy, who suddenly seemed extremely interested in the goings on below. He couldn’t possibly
It felt like Draco had barely closed his eyes when he was awoken by a sudden, blinding headache, which had him sitting forward and clutching his head in his hands. He was hot –
He sighed, pushing his breakfast plate to one side. With each day holding so little purpose, Draco knew how easy it was to allow darkness to creep in, to let fear paralyse him in its grasp. He worried for his mother, for how she would react when the inevitable happened. Broken by the trials and grieving the loss of everything she’d known, his mother had already fallen into a pit of despair, so consumed by thoughts of
With a sigh, he gently untucked himself, slipping out of the bed, pushing up the sash window with a grunt, and inhaling deeply. He felt strangely bereft, suddenly, without the warmth of Harry’s embrace, and shivered, wrapping his arms around himself for comfort as he stared out at the street below. What on earth was wrong with him? He’d just had an incredible shag – almost certainly the best of his life,
He was almost surprised to see the numbers still glinting off the dewy grass – the score surprisingly even at 2180 : 2050. As Harry yawned softly, the Unspeakables’ score flicked to 2060. He glanced over towards their end of the pitch, stifling a grin as he spotted Ron, curled up inside the centre hoop, fast asleep, with the sole Unspeakable Chaser still awake enough to bother lazily tossing the Quaffle past him time and again. Harry cast his eyes down once more, watching the timer tick steadily down and feeling strangely bereft. With only sixty-eight minutes to go, for all his complaints, and his bruised buttocks, and his utter exhaustion, Harry found he didn’t want the night to end. He didn’t want to lose this new, genuine connection he’d formed with Malfoy, didn’t want to go back to the days of small talk and… and wondering.
Eventually, with a final flourish, the orchestra finished their piece. Hannah and Neville collapsed, giggling, against a tree, and Draco nervously began to make his way across the room towards them. There was a shout, and all at once he found himself shoved unceremoniously to the side, colliding with a short, scrawny man who’d been walking backwards while talking. The man’s glass smashed loudly on the floor, and his friends jeered at him as he whirled around.
A similar situation had arisen the day that Lee asked Draco for help balancing the books. It turned out that the Occamy eggs – which to all intents and purposes disappeared after arriving in the store – were causing the confusion. Every time Lee tried to ask Draco about them, she would suddenly lose her train of thought and have to start from the top. In the end, Draco had taken the accounts book and Vanished the entry about Occamy eggs.
Malfoy turned carefully towards the Snitch, which was, by now, hopping up and down, its tiny wings fluttering expectantly. “Go on then, I’ll have a turn,” he said with a grin, and with an alarming burst of speed shot off in the opposite direction. Harry leant forward to ease his still-throbbing bum off the seat while Malfoy chased the little ball about the pitch. Malfoy had been right, it
This was the wrong answer, clearly – Neville’s stunned expression made that much immediately apparent. Draco lowered his wand, allowing the empty cups to settling back on the side as he concentrated. Had Harry ever
“Yes. No. I… I wanted your business to be successful. I wanted to see you doing the right thing. I guess I wanted you to do the right thing so much that I put out of my head the idea that you might… not be?” Harry sighed again. “I’m not afraid to say that I’ve never exactly had the best instincts when it comes to you.”
. But this was Harry’s house – Draco didn’t know it at all – and he had no desire to wander unfamiliar hallways in the small hours. He couldn’t trust himself in this state – and Merlin only knew what potions might be lying about the place.
stop by because you wanted a thank you?” Draco continued, holding his good arm out in a gesture of supplication and sneering at Potter. “Here you are then.
“No sign of that hole you made in the bedroom wall, either…” he throws back recklessly. To his embarrassment he feels his cheeks grow warm. But if Draco notices, he doesn’t react.
Warmth spread across Draco’s chest, bubbling through his veins, as their mouths moved together. Finally,

Draco inclined his head in acknowledgement. There was silence for a few seconds, both of them lost in thought, before Thomas looked at him quizzically.
Draco, too, recalled the order by heart. The Aurors guarding the Ministry holding cells had thoroughly enjoyed providing daily updates on the fate of each one of their former associates. Draco still remembered being read the
They watched him scuttle off. “You’re welcome,” said Harry, grinning crookedly, and Draco could have kissed him right then and there.
“It’s my pleasure, darling,” Potter replied affectionately, sending both plates whizzing over to the sink with an easy flick of the wrist. “And don’t be silly; you know with your metabolism you could eat all day and you’d still be svelte as a selkie.”
“Well, this isn’t very comforting,” said Ron through a mouthful of sandwich. “I bloody hate corned beef.”
Harry laces his fingers together, twists them back and forth. Runs his thumb over the spot where his wedding ring used to sit. What’s he supposed to say, exactly?
But it was no good. Those techniques worked fine for the days when he’d be walking down Diagon and hear a hissed
The light had changed now, dimmed. The voices were still there, but further away, and whispering. Straining to listen worsened his headache, forcing him to make do with those disjointed fragments of speech which made it past the ringing in his ears.
, he’d even felt a tentative camaraderie with the rest of his team as they all whooped and cheered and patted him on the back. Thomas had popped into his shop during the week, and had seemed pleased when Draco – in Thomas’ words ‘ten times better’ than their previous Seeker – had readily agreed to carry on playing for them.
It was a strange thought, having a guest in his home, when he hadn’t spoken to anyone except his mother and Collins for well over a year. It was even stranger when Draco realised that he couldn’t remember ever having an exchange with Longbottom that hadn’t ended with Draco either insulting or hexing the man.
, when, without warning, there was an enormous crash as the door to the shop flew open. Casting a hasty Disillusionment on the
Harry stretched his arms to the ceiling, scraping his chair back from the table with an abrasive noise loud enough to make Draco wince. As Draco continued staring resolutely at the floor, he felt a pair of strong hands move around him, pressing firmly against the side of his arms. Lips brushed the shell of Draco’s ear. “Well, Neville got one thing right, anyway. I’ve got it pretty bad for you.”
“You will? That’s brilliant!” Harry beams, bending forwards to press kisses to every part of Draco’s face he can reach.
. It featured a large photograph of the Burbage family with a darling pre-teen Lee – all huge, doe-like eyes, long limbs, and tangled hair. For her part, Lee had stormed into work that morning muttering about violations of privacy, slammed the paper on the counter, and watched grimly as Draco’s
He clutched at Draco’s arm, tears running down his face. Draco looked around helplessly. A passing group of girls were watching the two of them, mouths agape, as Harry took some deep, calming breaths. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I don’t mean to laugh, it’s not… I’m not laughing at
And so, the months wore on and – although his heart still leapt every time Potter popped into the store – Draco might well have remained content with his little glances, his flirty comments, and his late-night thoughts, had it not been for the events which transpired one cold November day.
Under any other circumstance, Draco might have protested. He might have informed Harry that he’d just ruined robes worth several hundred Galleons, might have reminded him that no tailoring charms would ever restore the damaged silk to its former condition. But on this occasion, still breathless from the feel of Harry’s magic prickling dangerously over his skin, such thoughts didn’t even cross his mind. They both watched, silently, as the robes fell into a gold and blue puddle around Draco’s feet.
was still trying to compel him towards Potter – Draco spun to face the wall, adjusting his robes discreetly, and blurted out the first thing that came into his head.
The addition of the ‘ex’, he thought, biting into his toast with great relish, was definitely a step forward.
to die exactly, but he couldn’t see a great deal to live for. What better test of his worth than brewing a potion so complicated and dangerous that only a few potioneers in the country even bothered? Death in the prime of his life by potions misadventure did have a touch of the romantic about it, after all.
, after all – and gave it her best shot. It was rather hard to tell if Malfoy’s nose was completely straight again, she found, watching him spin past her giddily once more, but at least there were no longer droplets of blood flying around the room. A quick diagnostic revealed a cracked rib – easily mended – alongside a litany of older injuries, most of which bore signs of rushed or inexpert attempts at healing.
“Why d’you keep it up? Your job, I mean? Why not give up all that Deputy Head Auror rubbish that you hate so much? You know, if you’re not concerned about what people think…?”
“Yeah, and it’s been a nightmare few weeks too. First, a bunch of Howlers arrived – Christ, I’d never even
Back at the Manor, hundreds of vials ago, Draco had stood and stared at five silver Occamy eggs. He’d told himself back then that to die young would be somehow poignant or romantic, like a doomed lover from one of his mother’s silly romance novels. How naïve he’d been back then; how little he’d had to lose! He’d been such a fool all these years – a child playing with
“Draco.” Harry’s voice is steady and sure. “There’s no-one else. I’ve tried, believe me, but it’s true. And I think maybe it’s time to stop trying.”
“Harry, I can’t go back to… to nothing. We’ve never been nothing to each other. At least, you’ve never been nothing to me. We’ve been through so much, and I just…” The sound of footsteps briefly disrupted Draco’s train of thought. He stared at his hands, where the tip of his finger had blanched white and was starting to tingle. “Just to see you, to chat with you in the shop – that was the highlight of my week for a very long time. And I’m sorry if you didn’t know that.”
starting to get hurt now. He was hurting Lee, he was hurting Neville, and now Theo today – well, that had almost crossed a line that made Draco very uncomfortable.
Harry squirmed under Draco’s lips, whining. He rolled his hips impatiently forwards, grinding up against Draco, the hard length of his prick pressing maddeningly against Draco’s own through far too many layers of fabric. Draco widened his stance even further, fingers greedily clutching at Harry’s arse, as the banister creaked threateningly, and –
on his breakfast table each morning taunted him with descriptions of a changing world, running endless articles about the importance of
good; so impossibly, ridiculously relaxing. Malfoy drifted closer, his broom knocking against Harry’s, until Harry could sense Malfoy’s body directly behind his own. He wanted so desperately to lean back, to feel Malfoy’s arms come around him, to bury his fingers in that silky hair, to meet those clever lips with his own… Harry couldn’t help himself – he closed his eyes and pictured it, as Malfoy’s fingertips moved around his sides, lingering over the bare skin where his top had ridden up, making Harry tingle with…
Harry’s head disappeared. He was gone a full minute, which was just long enough for Draco to start picturing the entire Auror force emerging from his fireplace. But then suddenly an outline appeared, silhouetted against the green flames, and Harry stepped neatly out onto the hearth, alone. He was wearing dark jeans and a red polo shirt, which, Draco couldn’t stop himself noticing, highlighted the swell of his biceps perfectly. A memory returned, unbidden: the two of them lying entwined on the bed, Draco running his hands lightly up the back of those arms, squeezing gently at the muscles, feeling them flex beneath his fingertips.
photograph. Those days, it took Draco considerable force of will not to stop whatever he was doing and drag Potter up to his flat.
or the unexpected encounter with Potter. While he waited to sober up, he took a long, leisurely shower, not at all surprised when his mind wandered immediately to sparkling green eyes, firm biceps and a teasing voice asking him if he saw
He spent the rest of the day moping around, sniping at Lee and feeling sorry for himself – and yes, slightly horny – when to his surprise, Theo Nott walked through the front door. It had been five years since they’d last met, and Draco had barely stammered out a greeting when suddenly he found that they were making out, hands roving desperately over robes, stumbling into shelves, gasping into one another’s mouths. Things escalated far too quickly into heavy petting and noisily enthusiastic frotting against the dried ingredients cabinet.
A hand on her arm made her turn away. “Pans. Ginevra.” Draco was flushed with excitement. His still-damp hair brushed against her face as she leant in to kiss him on the cheek. “You’re both looking radiant, as usual. I was just wondering if you’d spotted –”
Draco felt like he wanted the floor to swallow him up, and it must have showed on his face, because Neville continued. “Now, I’m not saying the things you did were all right, you know, but I reckon it affected you, too. Like you said, you were living in the middle of it for a year. And the house arrest, and your father… nothing’s the same as it was.”
“It was shitty. But it’s alright,” Draco repeats. He clears his throat. “I forgive you, Harry Potter,” he says, in a mock-grave voice. His eyes are alight with mischief, and Harry’s heart leaps into his throat as a hand settles lightly over his own. “There. Feel better now?”
“Oh, come off it.” When Draco only shrugged, he frowned. “All right, let me.” He affected a child’s voice. “Potter thinks he’s

“Thank you, although I really couldn’t have done it without Lee.” She turned to Lee. “You were just fantastic. If Draco hadn’t already snapped you up, I’d be taking you on myself, you know. You’d be great if you ever decided to go into public speaking.”

Yes, her Gryffindor parents might have named her for a lion, but Draco was certain Leonie was a Slytherin at heart.
which provoked strong feelings in Draco. She’d insisted that recalling these events clearly would stimulate his brain to remember more, as well as allow him to begin processing the underlying emotions. To that effect – and to his great embarrassment – two of the earliest memories they’d worked on had been his encounter with Theo and the St Mungo’s Ball.
and adrenaline, but he certainly welcomed the prospect of a little quiet. He made his way out into the Atrium, past the newly renovated fountain, and over to the side of the room, where he leant against an enormous stone pillar, half out of sight. He watched as a few giggling revellers stumbled out of the party, weaving over to the bank of fireplaces on the opposite side. The whoosh of the fire took them away, and then it was quiet again, the hum of the ball distant once more.
“Sorry!” he called again, not sounding sorry at all, as Harry fought to keep the smile from his face.
“…you’ll have to imagine a sunny day, of course… hey, are you alright there? You’ll be soaked in a minute.” The agent taps the door impatiently, startling Harry out of his reverie. He steps back, shutting out the buzz from the street, wrinkling his nose as Harry drips onto the carpet.
…” he said, elongating his vowels in a crude parody of Malfoy’s voice, earning a playful swat across the shoulder. “It’s a Quidditch match, for Merlin’s sake. Or am I that intimidating?”
A long sigh. The voice was slowing down now, getting deeper and more serious. “I honestly don’t know how else to put it. Draco is
wondered, after all of Malfoy’s melodramatic warnings before the match, but any minor concerns he might have harboured had faded almost as soon as they’d taken to the skies. He was fit now, after all, much fitter than he had been back at Hogwarts. He ran each morning, spent most afternoons in the Ministry gym, was a formidable opponent on the sparring mats and still flew every week. He’d even attended training camp with the Falcons a few years back – yet another charity venture – and he was proud to say that he’d more than held his own amongst the professional athletes. If anyone could fly for an entire day and a night, it should be him, right?
Draco was gobsmacked. He didn’t think he’d ever had a conversation with a Squib before; in his parents’ eyes, they’d been creatures to be pitied and hidden away. Of course, Draco could see clearly that a lot of what his parents had said was ignorant tripe, but he couldn’t believe that even now, any Squib would choose to work for a Malfoy.
Draco stared after her for a minute, gobsmacked, before sinking heavily into an armchair. He was still shaking with adrenaline and anger, but he couldn’t deny that it was a relief to see the back of her. He’d remembered Pansy as hot-headed, but Merlin, that had been
He sighed. The letter was classic Pansy – teasing, unsympathetic, and self-involved. And just what was he supposed to do now? If she followed through on her threat – and it
“Yeah. I’d cast a Disillusionment, sit right over there.” He pointed to a bench by the side of the road, right in the middle of the crowd of Muggles.
The tumult subsided. With a mounting sense of dread, Draco scrambled to his feet, flecks of plaster falling from his hair to the floor. He looked around, eyes widening with surprised delight as he took in his surroundings; for he seemed to have stumbled upon some kind of hidden storeroom.
Neville picked up a too-hot bacon rasher with his fingers, cursing and dropping it quickly, and Hannah tutted at him before turning back to Draco. “I know you didn’t have the best night, though. I’m sorry about Susan and Dennis. I don’t think we realised how―”
for the score. A middle-aged witch, with curly white hair – from the charity, Harry assumed – walked slowly to the centre of the pitch. She clearly said something, because the crowd cheered, but her words were carried away by the wind. As she raised her wand high above her head, an ear-splitting boom echoed through the air. Below them, the timer ticked over to
“You should try and get that memory back, if you can. Because I still think about that day. I remember it all. Quite… vividly.”
“Er, here, for you.” Harry frowned and didn’t take it, instead indicating his own ubiquitous cup. “I know,” clarified Draco, “but this one’s Irish. I thought… the weather… the Cannons…” He tried for a laugh.
But Apparating based on a description was wildly inaccurate at the best of times, and that, combined with Draco’s nerves and the bloody great pot he was holding, sent him dizzy and stumbling straight into Neville’s marble coffee table, ceramic crashing loudly against glass.  Chaos reigned briefly as half the guests were forced to jump backwards, while others shrieked, and several dropped their glasses. Draco himself bounced back from the table, wobbled precariously and landed directly on his arse, with the coiled tree trunk coming to rest over his damp, soil-covered lap a moment later.
“Look, mate, I’m not being funny, but this isn’t a great time for a chat,” yelled Ron, eyes fixed firmly on the incoming Quaffle. He leapt to one side, arms outstretched, growling as he reached it just a second too late, the tips of his fingers grazing the leather as it flew straight through the centre hoop. “You’ve just got the one bastard to worry about, you know? There’s three of them on me all the time. They’re bloody mobbing me, and…” he raised his voice, making sure it carried to the Aurors gathered in the centre of the pitch, “…our lot couldn’t hit a Flobberworm in a bucket, so I’m basically on my own out here.”
The box explodes, pieces of plastic and bits of electrical equipment raining down onto Harry and the burning tray. Harry blinks, ears ringing. He can’t make out Draco’s features, but he certainly recognises the exasperation in his voice.
demanded Lee, frantically) to introduce him to a Ministry colleague. Draco nodded apologetically at Luna, allowing Hermione to lead him over to a grey-haired witch sat alone at a table, a steaming pile of barbecue ribs heaped before her.
“Not a problem, Lee.” She squealed with excitement, picking up packets of horseradish and trying unsuccessfully to juggle them. As Draco watched her collect the packets from the floor, he noticed that Potter was glancing over at him nervously. He looked up, curiously. Potter didn’t say anything, merely shuffling his feet some more.
“Good. Now I hope you’re all well-rested, and ready for a nice, clean game of Quidditch.” He looked at his watch. “Please mount your brooms.”
They introduced themselves. Bryn was friendly enough, although clearly unused to magic. His easy smile faltered slightly when Seamus asked him what he did for a living.
“Cheers. I’ll see you,” said Potter, too quickly, already halfway out of the store. He left, striding quickly off down the alley, without looking back.
on board, Draco’s team never lost. He’d hover around awhile, watching the match; but as soon as he became bored or they started losing, the Snitch would suddenly appear in front of him, an easy catch. He tried ignoring it, but the damn thing would practically smack him in the face until he gave in. As a result, their matches were getting shorter and shorter. Even Draco’s teammates – initially pleased to be unexpectedly top of the league – were becoming annoyed at the predictability, making loaded jokes about how

Lee was initially nowhere to be seen, and Draco was wondering if she was here at all by the time he finally spotted her, lurking over in a shadowed corner behind the orchestra. She was dressed in a crimson Muggle evening gown, worn off the shoulder, her wild, tangled mane tamed for once into shining ringlets, which cascaded softly down her back. A young wizard with curly brown hair was leaning down to talk to her, and as Draco watched, she laughed and leant into him, resting a casual hand on his bicep in possibly the most blatant display of flirting Draco had ever witnessed.
“I do, actually.” Draco looks touched. “I – I did wonder. I wasn’t sure whether you were listening, back then.”
“I used to come down here. During the war.” Draco’s voice was so quiet, the whole idea so incongruous, that at first Harry wondered if he’d heard him correctly.
Pansy’s beady eyes flitted over Draco’s face as she considered his words. After a few moments, she sat back, smirking. “
seem to accidentally drop an awful lot of things right in front of Harry – but Harry always swiftly dismissed the notion as wishful thinking. Malfoy flirted with
In the present, Draco jerked awake for a second time, overcome by utter terror. His heart thudded in his chest and his breathing quickened. Draco was very used to panic attacks since the war, and he dug his nails into the palms of his hands to ground himself, trying to deepen his breaths. The burning feeling was still there, and he thought briefly of getting more water, but he felt rooted to the spot. Another memory sprang forward, and he groaned, moving his arm up over his eyes.
“Of course I have. I mean, at school, there was so much to deal with, and I really did hate you for what happened to my father, but, Merlin help me, I knew it was more than that even then. You understand how
“And then it was your turn. I just… I just got up and went. I told myself that this was the next trial, that I’d gone to them all so far, yours was no different. But Draco, I was wrong. As soon as I saw you, I knew that I shouldn’t have been there. That it
charm. Draco transfigured the vial into a shallow container, dipping two fingers in the top to gather some ointment. It formed a shiny bead on his fingertips, running down the groove between his digits.
At some point, he must have drifted off to sleep, because he woke with a start to a loud rapping noise coming from the bedroom window. He tried to ignore it, but it didn’t stop, and Draco opened his eyes with a groan. The sliver of sky visible through the skylight had turned almost to black, and he could hear the faint patter of raindrops hitting the glass.
– to acknowledge the gift that Harry had given him in some way. But how could he possibly voice the way he felt?
Atop the unbroken vial it lays, innocuous, as your blood rushes to your feet and you forget how to breathe: a familiar wooden spatula.
But at night, pacing around his flat, he’d work himself into a frenzy of paranoia and panic. Draco wouldn’t be able to function off of
“There’s nothing going on, I promise,” he said, holding his hands out in front of him, palms upwards. “I was thinking the other day about things at school, and how it all went to shit, and I wondered if there was any way I could start making it up to people. I don’t know why I Owled you first, really. Maybe because I felt especially guilty. Or maybe I thought it would be more straightforward than trying to write to, say, Potter.”
“Yeah, so?” was what came out, and Draco adopted an air of nonchalance to accompany the words, shrugging his shoulders and grinning roguishly: a child caught teasing the house-elves, perhaps.
A commotion sounded outside, and the doors to the banquet hall flew open. Everyone turned to watch as the players entered, freshly showered, smart in their navy Puddlemere dress robes. Cameras flashed and cheers of delight echoed around the room as Harry hauled the enormous trophy above his head. Next to Pansy, Ginny cupped her hands around her mouth and let out a deafening whoop; Harry caught her eye with a grin. He passed the cup to his vice-captain and made a beeline for the pair, sweeping them both up into a tight hug.
you come over,” he corrects, quickly. “Even Kreacher’s not that bad anymore. I’ve got my workshop there too, I’m just finishing off the Model Six.” He winks, conspiratorially. “I’ll let you have a go, if you like.”
After Malfoy had finished gloating, he relented, finally, prodding his wand into Harry’s bum with even greater relish. Harry couldn’t help the – possibly quite indecent – moan that escaped as a delicious numbness spread once more down his aching thighs.
“As I was about to say, there’s even room for a little table and chairs. Picture sitting out of an evening, you and –” he glances quickly at Harry’s ring finger “– a friend, sharing a bottle of red…”
“Oh yeah,” said Neville, looking stumped, as Potter shrugged. “Yeah, you’d definitely better ask Hermione.”
“Well, originally it was only a couple of times a week, and then only when I was working, but then coming down got harder and harder. So now―” Draco looked down at his shaking hands, giving a weary, mirthless laugh, “―now, I guess I’m a potions addict.”
“There’s no one around.” Draco realised as he spoke that it would sound ridiculous – they were in the Ministry Atrium, for Merlin’s sake – but imbued with a healthy dose of
Guiltily, she looked back up at him. The fringes stilled. “I’m quite well, thank you,” she replied, her clipped voice betraying the lie. Draco remained quiet, examining her face, until she lowered her wine glass, tapping her finger lightly against the bowl.
The earlier visual of Malfoy in cowboy boots popped instantly into Harry’s mind once more, and he gulped. “Sounds… sounds good.”
“Yeah, well,” said Malfoy, tracing the knob of Harry’s right ankle, and – Harry thought through his blissed-up mind – trying to disguise a grin, “all that moaning and complaining you were doing was driving me crazy. Although I’m not actually sure that this is any better.”
Draco stared down at the parchment, as though by wishing hard enough, he might change its contents. His father’s demise would make Draco the legal head of the household. The practical implications were too significant for Draco simply to add to the growing list of tasks he was avoiding. He had no idea what
awful. I can’t imagine. I’m so sorry you had to go through that, and just after losing your parents…”
He let his eyes stray to Harry’s face. Harry’s head was tipped back, still against the pillar, and his eyelids were half-closed. His lips were parted – wet, obscene – and here, too, Draco could see his breath coming fast, unsteady. Dizzy with the force of his want, Draco brought his other hand up next to Harry’s head, bracing himself on the pillar. Harry’s eyes – so green, like fresh spring leaves and new beginnings, like shouted curses and the Firewhisky bottle under Draco’s bed – widened slightly at the movement, mouth curving up into a lazy smile, and Draco was lost.
She shot him a disbelieving look. “Okay. First of all, it’s summer holidays. And secondly, I don’t go to Hogwarts.”
Draco sighed, rubbing his chest. He ached, suddenly, with the depth of his feelings; with the weight of everything that had passed between them. His
“And you know we’re all happy for you – proud of you – for how well you’ve been doing. But it’s not up to you to decide whether he gives you another chance, sober or not. And it’s hardly a surprise that he’s still a bit confused about his feelings. You really did a number on him, you know?”
They grab brooms from the Ministry store – nothing fancy of course, but that hardly matters – ditch their robes and head off, swooping high over London, chasing away hours of tedium and painful, biting tension, dipping in and out of cotton-wool clouds to wash the grime off their faces. They’re not racing, exactly, but Draco keeps up a relentless pace, occasionally glancing back at Harry with a grin before speeding up, and it’s not too far but Harry’s muscles are aching by the time he sees the sea.
There were people around him, Draco could tell. The soft rustling of the bedsheets, the shadows falling over his face, the gentle but impersonal touches to his arms, his head, his chest. Their voices were familiar, too, reassuring, even though he couldn’t quite picture the faces they belonged to. His mouth was sticky-dry, devoid of even the slightest drop of moisture, and his head was still pounding. Where
“Oh, I was. I mean I probably wasn’t, really, but I remembered. After. When I – when I was ready to hear –”
So Draco – thoughts filled with of tactics and strategies to suggest – was barely aware of his surroundings as he wandered languidly over to his teammates. He was considering calling out to them when suddenly he was jolted from his pleasant reverie by a loud jeering noise coming from behind him.
As Draco eased himself down the stairs, he could hear the sounds of Lee opening up shop. Her tuneless humming, the squeaking of her trainers across the wooden floor, the scrape of the cauldron as she set up the day’s brews – all felt familiar, yet different, somehow clearer than before, as if he’d been listening behind glass and someone had finally opened a window. This eerie sense of jamais vu persisted as he wandered, trancelike, into his shop; for although he’d last seen it mere weeks ago, he’d hardly ever entered it sober. It was smaller than Draco remembered – the ceiling lower, the walls shabbier. The floors were in need of a good polish, and something had burned a huge hole across the dark wood of the counter. Most concerning of all, the shelves were sparsely stocked, with the few remaining jars and vials spread out to conceal obvious gaps.
It was Potter’s turn to laugh. “Look at you. You don’t come dressed like that if you want to end the night alone.”
With another reluctant nod, Collins scowled and began to turn away. Draco gave him a wide smile, inclining his head exaggeratedly. “
As she watched, Malfoy thrust out one thin, bone-white hand, nodding charmingly to an invisible companion. He listened for a moment, before smiling even more widely and taking a couple of shuffling steps forwards.
“Okay, okay, I believe you. Really, I do. So what’s got you all tied up in knots this afternoon then?” she asked, lifting the lid from the cauldron before her and wrinkling her nose as a plume of purple smoke rose from within. “Go on, out with it.”
Draco allowed himself to be tugged to his feet, admiring the way Potter’s delicious arse shifted under the fabric of his expensive suit trousers as he followed him out into the ballroom.
Caught out, Draco blushed. Harry took pity on him. “To answer your original question though: yes, I came to the ball alone.”
Loud footsteps stomped across the room. There was an enormous crash, followed by a shout of frustration. “
He darted over to the far hoop with a grunt, just in time to watch as the Quaffle sailed past him once more.
“Well,” said Malfoy, looking slightly shifty, Harry thought, “they asked me to help set up the new Field Division, for starters. Offered me a pay raise too. And, well,” he looked at Harry slyly, “I suppose you could say that at MACUSA, there wasn’t as much temptation in the next office over.”
Potter’s expression was benign but curious, bright eyes flicking searchingly back and forth over Draco’s face.
Harry inhaled deeply, lacing his fingers together on his lap as he spoke. “All right then. So, you must have heard that I can resist
“Oh, you know how it is. Little of this, little of that. I was, uh, building barns for a bit down in Somerset. That was a good one. Cold sometimes, mind, but not that bad if you’ve got the right gear. And I worked in a kitchen for a while, some fancy hotel down in Bristol. Do the odd bit of landscape gardening too, from time to time.”
“I know,” Draco said, insistently. “I know. But just let me tell you, now. The truth – the way I feel. Let me tell you all of it, Harry, before I lose my nerve, okay?”
directly. He’d made such an effort to be quiet and considerate since he moved in, not wanting to give anyone the chance to complain about the Death Eater next door, and now it was all about to be ruined by Potter’s idiotic shouting.
.” Her eyes were on Draco, but she inclined her head to a girl next to her. “D’you know, this one, the Death Eater? A few years ago, he had the gall to send me a letter. An
Draco hummed, choosing his next words carefully. Afraid to look at Harry as he spoke, he picked up a quill, and twirled the tip of the feather around his finger.
Draco paused, surprised at Harry’s words. He’d never really thought about it in that way. In fact, he’d tried to avoid thinking about it at all, really. But all this – all these revelations – it was too much to take right now. He put his head down and kept walking, ignoring Harry’s calls behind him and slipping inside his bedroom. He flopped down onto his bed, pulling the duvet back over his body in a childish attempt to hide. Surprisingly, Harry didn’t follow him into his room, although Draco could still hear his stupid footsteps stomping around outside. He pushed his face deeper into the pillow, trying not to scream.
, hilarious as it sounds – we’ve become, well, friends. He visited me during my house arrest – he helped me set up the shop. He came to see how I was getting on, and he happened to have Potter with him, that’s all. Although I must agree, the little paparazzi moment outside certainly did work in my favour.”
“But you must be filling your days somehow. Minerva mentioned that you did well in your N.E.W.T.s...” Neville’s voice faltered then, as though he’d let slip a secret. Draco wanted to push him, to find out what McGonagall had been saying, but he found himself holding back; knew instinctively it was
“You must be Mr Black. I’m delighted to meet you, sir.” The agent beams at Draco, pumps his hand up and down effusively. Harry frowns. He certainly didn’t get that treatment when he arrived. He glances down at his own scruffy trainers, his hoodie, his old jeans – frayed at the bottom with a tiny hole at the knee. Of course, Draco’s wearing what looks like some fucking bespoke-tailored suit. Harry might have laughed, had he still been capable of it.
“Ah, you bought me a drink?” Harry looked conflicted, his hands coming up to tug at the ends of his hair where it stuck out from under that ludicrous cap. “I shouldn’t – thanks, though. You have it.”
There were no snakes crawling up the wall, the Dark Lord wasn’t sitting in his armchair, the roof didn’t seem to be caving in, nor had the floor turned to water. No more hallucinations then, he was relieved to note, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right. There was an orange glow coming from the hallway, fast-shifting shadows moving across the wallpaper where his door was open a crack. The living room fire had been lit. Draco listened intently, and almost immediately heard a muffled scraping sound coming from the kitchen area. His heart set up a steady gallop in his chest.
Pansy looked over at her girlfriend then, an uncontrollable giggle spilling from her lips. As soon as she caught Ginny’s eye, the younger girl snorted. Before she knew it the both of them were bent forwards, laughing hysterically, oblivious to the disapproving looks of the crowd around them.
– a blonde Hufflepuff girl he recognised was stalking over towards him, clearly planning on continuing what Dennis had started.
“Yes, you did, Draco. I don’t care if you couldn’t help it, I don’t care if he wanted it. I don’t even care if you didn’t know you were doing it. You messed him around and you took advantage of him. After
Draco found himself quickly absorbed into the crowd. He re-introduced himself to people he’d once known. He was introduced to people he’d never met before. A matronly old witch in a traditional pointed hat swept him up onto the dance floor, where he steered her gracefully around, spinning and dipping until she could no longer keep up, and another witch rushed to take her place. Draco had never been the best dancer at Mme Orlova’s Wizarding School of Dance, but that evening,
it. They had no idea that not two miles away there was a house full of people who’d murder them as soon as look at them. That the future of the world as they knew it depended on some speccy prat off hiding in a tent somewhere.” He nudged Harry, fondly. “They didn’t crawl into their beds wondering if tonight was the night the werewolf down the corridor would fancy a midnight snack. They just…
Collins’ nostrils flared angrily as he leaned in, reeking of beer and cheap aftershave. “Go ahead, smirk all you want. Bet you’re proud of yourself, aren’t you? Real pillar of society you are.” He narrowed his eyes. “You know, you never fooled me back then, and you’re not fooling anyone now.”
