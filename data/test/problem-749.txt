"Yeah," Harry furrowed his eyebrows.
"Fantastic for the most part. The only problem is, is that Draco's in an arranged marriage with Astoria Greengrass, and he doesn't want it, he wants to be with me, so we're trying to get him out of it."
"There are some things you just can't. Being Alive isn't apart of survival, Harry."
"Father! Don't touch my hair," Scorpius snapped. It seemed sort of crazy how alike he was to his father, "What's kind of story?"
"Betcha Malfoy can't hold a drink," Ron smirked.
"Shut up, Malfoy!"
"More like arsehole."
"Draco," Pansy sat back in anger, pinching her nose, "Why didn't you tell me he was poisoning your head again?"
"I'm not lying. If I wasn't so sore, I'd mark them."
"Do you have detention again?"
Hermione also shut her mouth, but then opened it again, however Harry spoke from the other room.
Harry winked. "Let me know when you want to... when you want your birthday present."
The word made Draco physically ill. "Oh. I... Merlin, I don't know what I'm doing," Draco faked being flustered. Pansy told him to do it, and Draco at first didn't want to because it would just take longer to get Potter. "I'm wasting your time. I shouldn't have asked."
"Yeah," Harry nodded. "Maybe. Actually, I think you're right. Anyway, erm..."
"But Potter..."
"We can do this."
Draco immediately unlocked the door, and rushed out, only catching a glimpse of Harry's table. He was talking to Slughorn, leaving him distracted enough to not see Draco. Hopefully.
But if they made their horseplay all chummy and whatnot, other houses would want to be all 'buddy buddy' and sappy, and dare I say it, mushy; frankly, who could ever want endless love and affection from Hufflepuffs, Ravenclaws, or even stupid Gryffindorks? Everyone would turn into teddy bears and fluff balls, and that was completely unacceptable.
"Promise," Harry said as sincerely as he possibly could.
"Which one did you see?"
"I don't... I don't... l-love or do whatever you sick Gryffindorks do."
“What? Lucius, you know when you’re kissing your wife and I know when I’m kissing mine. Surely after a two-year relationship, the boys would have made some form of muscle memory.”
They ate breakfast and gave Narcissa them both hugs before Draco collected his things, said a good riddance to the Manor and flooed to Grimmauld Place.
"Boyfriend? You actually want a commited relationship?"
"I could feel his anxiety generating off of him," Draco laughed. "Harry, would you like to tell them what happened before Christmas break, and what I had to come back to?" Harry put his head in his elbow and groaned before talking again.
Draco tried hugging him back, but to no avail, he was just energy. "I can't believe you're alive!"
"You... you told me-"
They relaxed, reheating the water over and over until the bubbles were gone, their fingertips and toes were pruned. They reheated it once more to lather soap over each other lovingly before helping the other out of the tub.
"What do you mean?" The look on his face made Draco's heart burn.
"Oh Merlin, a Gryffindork! I'm falling for a damned Gryffindork!"
"Hm?"
Then he pulled out the second one. Draco was lying on his stomach, the camera pointing back at him so it showed his lips, his bare shoulder, part of his back, and the top of his naked arse. Harry whimpered.
"Didn't you ever wish to tell people," Ron asked, distracting him.
"It's not a memory!"
Ginny took his hand. "Come on."
The blond rested against the ice cold rail, watching the snow flurry whilst staring off into space.
Harry yawned and stretched, opening his eyes to find Draco, blurry, in front of him. "What are you doing here?" Then Harry's face fell, remembering how he hadn't even cared about being there with him, too tied up with Umbridge and Voldemort instead of enjoying the moment. "Oh my God, we're on a date. I fell asleep on our date."
Harry nor Draco were in the Great Hall on Friday night, but for two completely different reasons, and halfway through his detention, Harry realized he should have told Draco he wasn't to be there.
"It's a long day of travel." Still, Harry shook his head. "Maybe take something with you, then."
"That's awful, Harry," Arthur said, setting down his empty coffee cup, "You really do love him, though, right?"
They both kicked off their shoes while wearing warm, fulfilled smiles on their faces.
"Yes," he gave him another kiss. "I forgive you for playing a joke on me to get you to fall in love with you."
"I do very much, since 4th year, actually, which is why I asked him to marry me," Harry smiled yet again, and both Mr. and Mrs. Weasley looked up in shock. "And he said yes," Harry raised his left hand to show them the ring. Molly ran to him and hugged him dearly.
Harry panicked and turned to Ron and Hermione, who looked as confused. "Why would he do that?"
She stepped up to him and as she leant in, Draco's stomach twisted. Lips met Harry's. A different side of Draco, the Draco who was in love with him, took over. He clenched his fists and his throat tightened.
Hopefully,
"You're not a freak, Harry," Draco said almost too loudly. "You're nothing close to a freak! How could you-"
Guilt made him step forward and comfort her. Maybe it would bring some comfort to himself, too.
“You aren’t trying to dominate the wizarding world!”
Harry laughed and released a bit, "Sorry!"
"Well I was born into a pure blooded fami-" he stopped because a pile of leaves were thrown at him.
Harry was taken aback. That hurt a little. Draco knew- or supposedly knew he didn't want anyone else but him. This wasn't the fight they planned last week, and that's what turned Harry's heart cold. He was torn between wondering if there was something on Draco's mind, or if there wasn't a Draco.
"Overruled, prosecution may continue."
"Fine then, talk, but I'm not moving."
“Yeah, but you were forced.”
"I don't care," Harry said kissing his ear and nibbling it gently. There was a sweet silence and Draco waited until Harry was almost asleep so his last thought would be of him.
"Are you kidding," a black haired slytherin rolled his eyes, "that's all he talked about if it didn't have to do with potions. 'My husband this, my husband that, oh my husband is Harry Potter, did you know?' My name is Michael by the way, and yes, we know."
"I love you, too," Harry smiled.
"I thought he loved us being together."
Pansy, mouth agape, stared Draco down. "I actually have a use besides seduce arrogant pigs like you," she scoffed. "I won't do it."
"I have your word," Draco said back.
"I am. And you know what I hate? That I love you so much that I forgive you for that, too. I love your smile, even though you say you haven't before. You have I assure you." He pulled out the photo and put it on Draco's bed since he was turned around he then went to his originals pot, laying away from him. "I love you because some how you always make me laugh with your witty humor. I love how you get me, you understand me. It was always like you were one step ahead of me and when I got there you accepted me with open arms. I love it when you kiss me-"
"Leave her out of this," Harry bit in disgust. "She has nothing to do with you. You're disgusting."
The two guards came up behind him and grabbed his arms. Malfoy tried to fight. "Harry Potter needs it. I didn't sneak out of Hogwarts, I promise. Madam Pomfrey ordered me here. Please, he's dying!
His heart skipped a beat.
"Right, that would have gone over well. 'Oh, gee Potter, sorry to bump into you, just wanted to say I've had a giant crush on you since the robe shop and it got much worse when you rejected being my friend."
"If I move anymore they will find my skeleton in a hundred years as a part of the concrete."
"I get that you're mad at me. Can we please make up already? I'm sorry. But you're not even letting me apologize. I haven't even seen you in the hallways. Can we talk about this?" Draco didn't say anything. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to overstep anything. I'm just protective of you. I want you to be safe. I wish that you didn't have the parents you do so you didn’t have to deal with this.”
"Hey you, don't think about it, okay," Draco said, sensing exactly what he was thinking. "It's not the last time."
Harry almost smiled at that. "Years and years of practice."
"Well, I must say I'd hope for better." The Dark Lord laughed, and so did everyone around him. "And who might you be, young man?"
“Excuse me,” she squeaked, turning to Harry. Draco, his wand behind his back, threw a simple silencing charm onto Harry’s lips and the man was silent, but he knew the second he’d be released, he would never hear the end of it.
Fuck, they had to watch. Everyone had to watch.
"Mate, Malfoy's missing," Ron said.
“That’s because you’re a terrible kisser,” he tried to not sound harsh, but screw that. He already had over a head of height on her, and being intimidating was certainly easy.
Harry grew curious, glancing up at Draco with an eyebrow raised. The blond bit his lip, his leg shaking in anticipation. He couldn't read his facial expressions.
"Oh, you're wearing it."
"I saw his owl. What are you doing, you fool!"
"Take your time."
This was not taking a step back. This was taking eight-thousand steps forward.
Lucius slapped him, and Draco leapt from the bed, standing in front of Harry. "No! You don't touch him! How could you let me think he was dead!? How dare you!"
Pansy flattened her mouth to him in pity, examining his face. Sunken eyes, dark circles, cheekbones sticking out, all complete with a great frown. "One day, things will be okay again, maybe even with Harry." She kissed his forehead and walked to the door in an echoing silence, and as she put her hand on the doorknob, she was interrupted.
Harry frowned and looked away, but then picked his head back up. "That's okay, we have this spell."
"Dunno, but I wanted to do it."
And suddenly the torture disappeared, and he found himself in his dorm room. "Wake up!" Blaise jarred his shoulder.
"You need to get over your jealousy. I don't like it when people don't have free will. And I don't want to be constantly feeling bad for having friends." Harry fronted him. "The love inside me isn't limited. There's no cap of who I love or how much or how many. Draco, I'm not going to forget you because I have a great time with my friends. If anything, it's something I get to tell you about."
him. "Free."
"Okay then, go on Mr. Potter."
"No. Safe is with you."
“How many times did you two kiss?”
"I'm sorry," Harry said. "I've been stranding you when you're really stressed out." Draco looked up at him. "I didn't explain everything to you last year, and you were there for me all the time, no questions asked. No matter how moody or bitchy I was." He swallowed. "I'm sorry I haven't been as supportive of you. You don't deserve that."
"Well," Harry lay back on the bed. "I feel less alone in being oblivious because there actually are a lot of gay people around us and we were just to into each other to even notice. Sirius was gay, Lupin was bisexual—and they dated! I could have had two gay adopted dads, but no—" He cut himself off taking a deep breath, "Can't wait to bring that up tomorrow in therapy and take a deep dive into more of my dead dreams," he swallowed sharply. "I couldn't tell you who else, but I'm sure a hell of a lot."
"He's not going to talk to you. He won't even talk to me and I've known him since I was four."
He loved the Weasley's most out of anyone he'd met in the Wizarding World (alongside Draco and Hermione), so receiving pain from them made it even more unbearable.
"If I move anymore I will be off the table."
Harry licked his lip and looked at him. "You're the only thing that gets me out of bed some mornings. I wouldn't have been able to handle this year without you. I've only survived because of you. Just looking at you makes me feel better. What are we supposed to do now? I don't have you, I don't have Quidditch. What am I supposed to look forward to?"
“I will, don’t worry, I’ll convince them.”
"You left me here! You left me here alone to deal with that by myself," Draco shouted. Harry just laughed again and Draco hit his arm. If there hadn't been the Weasleys there, he probably would have killed him on the spot. Hell, if this wasn't for Harry and it was any other guy, he would of went home. So instead of leaving, he toughed it out and looked around the room to try and spark a conversation with any object he could find, when a very strange object on the sink caught his eye. "What is that?"
It was at least ten minutes after Harry had left when Draco lifted his sleeve ever so slightly. His wrist was bright red and inflamed, and as it pulled it back, he found not only his ugly Dark Mark, but blood and scabs on top of it, like a rash or rug burn.
. He stared at the stranger in the mirror. Only when he moved his hand did he realize it was himself. No, it couldn't have been. That's not him.
"I...," Harry looked down, "I'm... sad."
But now it was covered in uniform, cursive handwriting.
"Yeah, so come on, tell us the details! What have you two been doing the past few days," Pansy nudged her elbow into his arm and wiggled an eye brow suggestively.
"Awh well if it isn't little lover boy coming for his little death eater boyfriend," she taunted as the smell of stale smoke filled the air. Confusion twisted Harry's face.
"Oh er- yeah... I- erm, I'm fine," Harry tried to maintain a neutral composure, but then he said the word 'fine' and his cheeks, betraying him against his own will, involuntarily pulled upward.
"I really wanted to add in some more verses, but I couldn't find a thing to match the words 'stink'" he laughed smirking back at his friends.
"Hey Ron," Harry asked, lying on his back, half of his curtains drawn so his legs were hidden.
"He isn't a Death Eater, he— " he gasped for breath.
"We weren't talking about you. Besides, you're the one who said we can't take what we say personally up there."
He just wanted an answer.
"I've gotta go," He said before sprinting away, his throat closing, his eyes automatically watering.
"He got me through the hearing," Draco snapped. "I want to see him now. He's in treatment."
"Thank you for joining us, Mr. Malfoy," the Minister in front of him spoke. He held a book in his hand. "We're here today to—"
"I'm sure it felt good, though. Probably better than getting yourself off."
"Draco, at this point you should know. You're in love with me, or you're not. Yes or no. It's simple."
Draco nodded and cast protection spells, cleaning spells, as well as lubricant and stretching spells.
"Two days. They need to make sure I am okay in the head. My leg still is sore too. Wouldn't want me beat up going home would they. Although the Dursley's wouldn't care."
Draco just scoffed. "You're not good."
"Yes."
“What do you see,” Draco asked him.
Draco kissed him and they both went into class shoulder to shoulder.
Above them, the ceiling began to crack. "Er, Mate," Ron looked up at it. "I know you're having a moment, but we need to go. You two can make out later."
-----------------------------------------
"The contract is already made Harry. He can't do much."
He was expecting Voldemort, truly, in fact, he looked forward to it. He was just about ready to stop running, to face it and end everything whether by Voldemort’s death or his own. Harry heard footsteps clatter down the stairs, and he opened his eyes to face someone much much worse than Voldemort. Their eyes connected.
----------------------------------------
Draco shut the door and closed it behind him, locking it as Harry pulled off the cloak and surveyed the room. He had one of the windows that mirrored the atrium, large and ceiling high, peeking into the black lake. It was adjacent to his bed and lit the room with a blue tinge. Still, there were several candle holders along the walls that helped counter the glow with red. They helped with warmth, too.
... "As in... Yeah. Yeah, if you want to."
"Wormtail held this... this thing, a baby I guess you could say. Voldemort. And Cedric was there, and he  killed him as if it was nothing." Harry swallowed, wincing, and Draco pulled Harry's hand to his mouth, kissing it, noticing the difficulty in spitting those gruesome words out.
Draco cracked a small smile and felt along his throat. "Still look better than you."
"Awesome, I'll go tell Angelina," and with that Ron left with excitement swimming in the air.
When at the kitchens, which were mostly empty except for a few house-elves cleaning, Harry searched the drawer until he found knives.
Still, Harry winced. "
"My answer is that it's up to Harry."
"Attacks," Scorpius questioned.
"I am. Have fun."
"Ginny, can you not say that please. It just reminds me of something." Harry refused to look her in the eye and let his vision turn to the window.
New mission: Find the Ravenclaw Diadem and give it directly to Harry. Don't get killed. Don't let Harry get killed.
"Draco?"
"I'm not a coward."
"Please repeat what you told me earlier about Draco."
"Is Potter straight," Blaise asked. "He could be gay."
Draco's hard face relaxed a bit before he set out a smirk. "Good, I'm happy you told me. I thought you didn't want to come tonight."
“Are you kidding,” a black haired slytherin rolled his eyes, “that’s all he talked about if it didn’t have to do with potions. ‘My husband this, my husband that, oh my husband is Harry Potter, did you know?’ My name is Michael by the way, and yes, we know.”
"And he turned to me and said-"
Blaise laughed, too. "Finally, Potter. You don't understand how much this boy has masturbated to you—"
"It's going to take us hours. It'll be nightfall before we get back."
“Fuck yes, it does, Harry!” Draco dug his nails into Harry’s back again, trying to hang on, but Harry’s voice… his voice…
And I hope you have too "
"Nothing insanely nice. We're not talking about diamond jewelry or fancy clothes or anything. There's this bakery outside Kings Cross, and the Dursleys used to take Dudley there all the time. It's world famous, and I never got to try it because, you know, Dursley's being who they were, so I thought that we could try it together." Harry jumped off the sink, nearly knocking Draco over, and grabbed a lumpy paper pouch from his waistband that crinkled loudly as he dug in it.
"Okay, Harry." Draco said softly. "Muggle world it is." Harry leant down and kissed him, clearly happy with their decision. "Don't make me regret this!"
Kingsley glared at them both before continuing on, causing a few to laugh. "And do you, Draco take this... insane man to be your wedded husband?"
"You can borrow mine. It'll make you feel loads better."
Then, Draco stepped closer, and Harry's heart beat fast. Was he going to kiss him? In front of his friends?
"Why?"
The green eyed boy walked down to an empty table and grabbed his stuff when the door opened with a certain Ravenclaw and two sneaky Slytherins walked in. Snape's face turned almost purple from anger for yet another unnecessary reason.
Lucius reached out to hit him, but Draco read it, and ducked, reaching for his wand. Still, Lucius took it and stood close to him, enough for Draco to see the haunted soul in his eye as he stabbed his wand into his neck. "Your eyes," Lucius hissed, noticing the shade and then he backed away in horror. "Don't tell me—"
"Are you not feeling well?"
"Er," Martha sorted through her papers. She looked so confused. "You have the Dark Mark?"
"I am too," Harry smiled, but then frowned.
Harry fought out of his grip and ran down the hall, finding the nearest bathroom where he collapsed over the toilet and heaved into it. Nothing came out but extra saliva and a bit of burning bile.
"Let's just relive the dropping me fifty feet off a broomstick why don't we."
Harry smiled because he seldom thought he was a Gryffindor nowadays. "Mmhmm."
“I know!” They both made their way to the couch where they then started crying into each other shoulders. “This was the stupidest idea in the world, Harry!”
Meaning entirely too far up his inner thigh, close to his groin, and just as Harry realized it and froze, so did Draco, because he didn't really know how it got there, it just sort of happened. They opened their eyes, suddenly both very anxious, and very much aware of what surface they were on. Kissing, they were absolutely comfortable with, and indeed were well practiced. But this... this was very different.
Harry let out a warm chuckle.
"That's okay." She sat down and put him on the bed. Teddy was still sitting up against her. He had a pacifier he sucked on, but giggled and it fell out of his mouth as his forehead sifted. Teddy formed a scar on him to match.
“Awfully,” he swallowed, “I want to talk to him,” he said before abruptly walking toward the door.
If the footsteps weren't so close behind him, he would have stopped to try and get any oxygen available to him.
"I thought it was you."
"Well, obviously you can't tell with his face like this," Lucius scoffed. "Surely there's another way."
"Please don't be. Mm." He tried moving his hips, but he too felt all of his muscles tighten and rip and arse sting. "Okay, next time we're not going seven hours, sorry. Was great, not human though."
He walked all the way behind Draco, where he could look at the rips of his back, where his blades were in portion to his spine, how they moved when he breathed. Harry could tell he was nervous by the way his shoulders moved up and down, almost rapidly. And Harry almost didn't allow himself to be selfish and let his eyes roam to Draco's arse, but damn it, this was the last time, and didn't Harry deserve this? Didn't Harry deserve the chance to look at the body of his lover?
Draco hugged the pillow enough to choke it, tears staining a good chunk of it.
"I think I'm getting sick," Draco said. "My stomach hurts all the time. Poison."
"Yes," Draco looked him dead in the eye, his hand reaching for Harry's cock, but Harry pushed him away, him missing the heat. "Yes, Harry. Don't think I don't want this."
Draco melted at the way he said it, and he stroked behind his ear to calm him down again. "You don't need them."
"What is it," she asked concerned as she started rubbing circles on Harry's back.
"Oh come on, Harry. We're only curious, that's all," She flipped the letter and uncrinkled it.
"Actually Professor, I didn't think I was eligible to take this course and I'm afraid I've come unprepared."
he mouthed.
"Potter tried to kiss you and you didn't let him?" Her eyes were wide as they walked down the stairs.
"You didn't," he yawned and finally opened his eyes.
"What? You? No, Harry, I just... I'm not... I'm sorry."
————————————————
"I've heard so much about you. I just wish Harry would have told us about you much sooner."
But what else besides that? Surely there had to be more. He'd had to poison more. The mead was in Slughorn's cabinet. That's a teacher. What if Slughorn had drunk it, or shared it with Flitwick? What if on one of his dates with Draco, Draco poisoned him, or hexed him when they slept.
"Let me guess, a sister, a twin."
Harry licked his lips, partially smiling. "You're sneaky."
He put his back against the cold wood and slid down, absolutely sobbing. Thankfully the common room was empty, although he didn't care.
"And you're not going to believe it either?" Draco's eyes, not being able to help it, followed along Harry's chest, and lower and lower past his abdomen and straight ahead, where he could see Harry's length ridiculously hard against his blue jeans, and just the sight and thought of it sent a shallow wave of pleasure to his own groin. His mouth watered, yet became dry at the same time, and he wondered what it would be like to taste him. "Draco," Harry woke him.
“Right because ‘kiss me, kiss me’ isn’t horny at all.”
“With vanquishing the Dark Lord, Harry Potter has become the star of the Wizarding World with his works during the Second Wizarding War. He’s been a symbol that children and peers have looked up to since he was just a toddler, the King of Hogwarts, only standing up for the greater good, but has The Chosen One been hiding a dirty little secret?
“Finally, the poor kid,” James said.
"What did he have you do?"
"The reason you're here. Because I specialize in hurting you. And you've stayed in love with me this long. After I've given you so many reasons to leave. I've made fun of your friends, I've made fun of you, I've mocked you, I purposely destroyed you the entirety of Sixth Year. And now in Eighth Year, I've apparently made fun of your eating disorder, I've put you in the hospital." Draco choked, his eyes clouding over. "I don't mean to hurt you. I truly don't want to hurt you, I promise..." He wiped his face and buried his head in his hands as he let out a sob. "I don't want to cause you any pain, let alone this much."
Draco shook his head. "I didn't think it through."
"I don't care. I want you to be happy."
"You sure? I kinda wanted to--"
He didn't know how Draco got involved with her or if they had a good relationship, but maybe there was a chance. There were times he followed them into the Room of Requirement. Maybe Draco paid her off, but other than that...
Safety and content washed over Draco: feelings he didn't think he was even capable of experiencing ever again, and the fact that he thought he had to say goodbye to them when he was sixteen made them overwhelming. He blinked a few times as he made his way up the stairs, carrying a sleepy, cuddly Harry.
Harry finished his plate and they high-fived again before going back to the Common Room and taking their potions.
And then he looked at Draco's lips and felt the urge to lean down, so he did but stopped when Draco stopped him.
"We're going to McGonagall's office."
"Harry Potter caught the snitch!" The Gryffindors won but none of the team was happy. The Slytherins were extra nasty to them, and they weren't happy about it. The song was inconciderate and vain. Harry wasn't too upset about it until he heard Malfoy biting off more than he could chew.
He raised his body by pushing on one arm and leaning on it, only to reach for the object, which was an envelope. Draco's heart started racing as he immediately smiled. On the top was written in Harry's messy handwriting,
“You’re really picking him over me?”
, but I didn't. You're welcome. My self control should be awarded."
"That's good?"
"I don't want to play anymore. Why does that involve you?"
Hermione took his other side and rubbed his shoulder. "It'll be okay."
"Okay," Harry softened from his smile, and furrowed his eyebrows. "What is it then? Take your time."
"How'd'you find out Thomas and Finnegan dated?"
"No, it's fine in fact I must be heading out," he said immediately jumping from the table. He had to get back to Draco before Kingsley did.
"I'm listening! Go on, spill!"
“You can.”
Harry froze in place, and she saw his hesitation. "I won't tell you what it is if it makes you more comfortable."
"Harry," Draco breathed as Harry dug a finger inside of him, and pulsed. "My love," he mumbled against his lips.
He swallowed. "I just feel like... my body is a physical manifestation of the abuse I endured. That's why I hate it so much." Harry backed off of him.
He was right next to the room of requirement when he put his hand in his robe pockets to feel the crunching of a piece of paper. He opened to find the note in Draco's handwriting, telling him something important. He crumbled the paper back into his pocket as soon as he read it.
“Why are you still here,” Dean questioned.
"What? I'm in pain Pansy! How am I supposed to focus on my date with Harry if I'm undergoing a heart attack!?" His voice broke every few words. He was freaking our over a certain warm and fuzzy feeling feeling in his chest.
"Why would you do that, father," Scorpius asked.
"The point of this program is to get you more accustomed to the normal world following the trauma you've endured. We'll have classes for you tomorrow, but in the mean time, here is a journal you can write your thoughts in. Dinner will be coming in the next hour or so. Do you have any questions?"
"Where are you going, get back here!" As an answer, Harry walked to the foot of the bed and grabbed Draco's ankles, pulling him down so he slid to the very edge of it. Draco's mouth fell open as he blushed, dizzy. "That was the hottest thing I've ever seen."
Harry complied, and Draco sat back more, running wild at the sensation.
"Harry that's great! You can finally play again," Draco encouraged.
"Why were you housing a Death Eater in your home—"
"You're not. You're sorry you got caught."
Probably ready to strike him.
"Hm?"
"Good question... I'm not really sure," Harry laughed, sighting that Draco's fancy clothes were covered in dust. He moved to wipe the grim away for him. "Can't have this. Your snobbish head will explode."
“A bit,” Draco tried showing no emotion.
"He went exactly where you did, or it looked like it. I don't want to see her or you get hurt. I dunno what he's planning or what he's trying to do. But make sure you two are careful."
"Are you happy now?" But Draco couldn't help but smile, addicted to the feeling of their lips together.
He leant against the wall, staring at the floor. Footsteps approached.
There were fewer students out and about as there were before the Hogsmeade incident. To the ones he passed in the hall, Draco had never felt so alien to them, but now it was like he was a different species.
Harry put his hand on Draco’s knee, causing it to stop and Draco looked down before flicking his eyes up to Harry again. “Sorry.”
Draco pulled the book back so he could look him in the eye.
The Manor had been raided, that bit was obvious. Portraits were taken off the walls, all the dark artifacts, and the tables they rested on. It left the walls quite empty. But, it was nice because anything that belonged to Death Eaters was taken out, and then some from his father's collection.
“Is she a good kisser?”
"Shut it Scarface," Draco smiled, looking up into his eyes and in taking the perpetual scent that he loved so dearly. Harry then took him by the chin and kissed him slowly, but deeply.
"Can I think with you?"
"I was there, remember?"
"Er..." Harry bit his lip. If he said Beauxbatons, then Ron would surely poke him further. "Hogwarts. But I, er, want it to be a secret right now."
Harry nodded and blinked away more tears.
They both sat there, staring at each other's tears realizing what they were both about to do, who they were about to be with, what it was going to feel like, how the other would sound, and look, and smell. It was their hopes and dreams coming into reality right then and there. It was the war, it was the heartbreak and break up, it was their first date, it was their first kiss and first hug and first time holding hands and first time laughing together, and the many times after that; it was the fights and the walking away and the betrayal; it was completely falling apart in front of each other, and it was the comprehension that neither of them could love anybody else as they loved each other, that they could never do this with any other person.
"I'm not dating Astoria Greengrass, Pansy."
"Oh please don't worry about it Mr. Potter-"
The next weekend, Hogsmede was on their list of activities.
“You’ve been dealing with me for five years now,” Harry snorted.
"If I'm in them it's my right!"
Draco finally spoke after several moments. "A mission." Draco wiped his nose on his sleeve, his face red and puffy as tears streaked down it. He could barely let it out. "Kids. Greyback mauled the kids. They murdered them in front of their parents and then they killed the parents." Their screams echoed in his head. "Just because they were Muggleborn. T-They wanted me to... I didn't, I couldn't... I... They made me," he gasped and breathed, "I had to dispose of their bodies." Draco was shaking. "I held them."
"Draco, that's not going to... we won't let that happen, I won't," Harry shook his head.
"We all are. It's okay, we'll get through it together."
"I had it when I was nine," Harry snapped back. "The third reason that I know you're completely fine-"
“We’re going to have to eventually. May as well do it now.”
this.
"Open your eyes," Harry repeated over and over until he finally did. He was back I'm his room, alone.
"Us," Harry looked into his eyes. "I want you to come with me."
-------------------------------------
"I can't ask for a second chance?"
When he arrived at the Three Broomsticks, he did his best, he really did, to go around the back. But there was no door anywhere. None, not even a vault hidden beneath the snow.
"Special order please, erm.. Potter," Harry replied.
"Because you're happy, right? No fake smiles."
Draco burst out into laughter. "What a coincidence, me too."
He then pressed his forehead together for moments of sweet calmness, their eyes closed, just feeling each other.
But Draco didn't care, he wanted to keep kissing him. It was like the first breath after almost drowning. He didn't realize how much he needed Harry's kisses until this morning. How good they felt. They were like a medicine to him, clearing out all the bad that was all-consuming, and giving him relief.
Draco's eyes flashed mercury once.
"Wait, I'm sorry," Harry stepped forward.
Despite it being dark, the moon's glow made Draco's tan trousers stand out, and Harry didn't even say hi.
"For example did I find you sexually attractive the night you got back from the ministry last year?No. Did I find you desirable? Completely. I want to be by you constantly, I want to be at your hip through the ups and the downs and the lows and highs and I want to be by your side every triumph and fall. And I think anyone who doesn't is an idiot who deserves a thank you note from me because that means I get to spend more time with you. Do you feel better? A little bit at least?" He put a hand in Harry's hair and the other one still rested on his arse. It wasn't going to move. Voldemort can go jump off a cliff right now.
“When he reached in his pocket to get the ring, his sleeve ran up and I saw his mark.”
“That’s the thing. If he did know, he’d go after you, and I can’t… If I lose you…” He trailed, not even knowing how to say it. “What if he questions you?”
Harry turned his head to see the boy that was breaking down and briskly walked toward him trying not to make a scene.
“I know, Harry, I know,” Draco sniffed. “It’ll be okay.”
Harry wished it to come true.
The death eaters walked closer, and visible was their leader: Lord Voldemort. There was a giant walking next to him with a bundle in his arms.
"To an extent..."
“Only if you write your name like that for the rest of the term,” Harry negotiated. Draco looked at him. “It’s basically official if you think about it. It’s not like you’re a Malfoy anymore. You’re father’s gone and your mother-“
He started examining Draco's bedroom, genuinely curious as to how he grew up. There was an entire seating area, a fireplace, a bookshelf, a gigantic bed with two nightstands next to it, a dresser, a full body mirror- which he could only imagine little Draco getting ready in it long ago, and a desk in front of three giant windows that covered one entire side of the room, draped in dark, heavy curtains.
"It looks like a mess. I hate it."
"We do work well together," Draco nodded. "Look at the sunset," the blonde pointed out to the horizon, where mountains were swallowing the sun and the clouds were pink.
When she finished, she pushed herself off the window. "That was the first time I've ever heard you tell a joke."
"Like I never want to let you go." He didn't. "Like I want to trap you in my arms and keep you here forever. So you'll always be safe."
"I would love to, honestly, I would. Things are too complicated right now."
“We need to tell them,” Draco repeated.
"So what do you plan to do? Dump him," Pansy asked. Harry couldn't take any more, his anger getting the best of him, so he revealed himself from around the corner.
It was sad, that Harry had to think about death. He probably did all the time. He wasn't peacefully ignorant like most of their classmates, like Draco. Draco had never really thought of his death, it was never on the table.
“Very,” Harry gasped, bending over and grabbing his cheek.
"Shh, we don't need to talk about it tonight. We can talk about it tomorrow. We've gotten no sleep in four days, let's just rest, okay?"
"Horrible," Harry responded truthfully. Draco could relate to that one. "How's Ginny?" Draco felt a wave of jealousy, knowing Harry asked that just to make him envious as revenge to kissing Astoria.
She bit her lip. "Try, Harry. Maybe. At least try. And who knows? Maybe he wasn't holding her hand in a romantic way, maybe it was because... she was lost or something?"
“I’m a better teacher than you,” Harry called, his insult was weak, and no venom was laced in his words.
He looked between them, but his world came crashing down as she spoke.
"Cedric? Diggory? I'm sorry but my boyfriend is way more perfect than any boy on this planet," Draco said through his teeth as he hit the concrete wall with his palm.
Draco's face softened slightly, but then tightened again as he grew insecure. "You missed your shot."
“Damn it,” Draco groaned. “This is all my fault.”
It wasn't but a few moments until a grumpy ratted mess walked into the room prepared to be either shocked or mutually disappointed. She found Draco with his blankets splayed on the floor along with all of his pillows except for one which he hugged in a fetal position.
Then traveling by portkey—Wormtail—Harry's arm being sliced and blood burning as Wormtail put it into the cauldron.
"But what about Voldemort... will he be there?"
“We’ll see about that, Greengrass.”
"What's so funny about that?"
Still, Hughs' eyes were wide with fear and he breathed fast.
How did the muggles get in it? It fit into the size of Draco's hand.
"Har-ry," Draco rolled his eyes.
"I'm taking back what's mine," Draco said breathlessly, "what are you doing kissing little ginger sluts?"
Harry loved him. Loved him. And if his father knew, he'd be dead. If the Dark Lord knew, they both would be.
The first time their tongues touched, they were completely hesitant, and it felt damn weird. Harry backed off completely and pulled a face whilst Draco wiped his tongue on his sleeve. The second time, they met in full force, and Harry put his tongue practically down Draco's throat- Draco not expecting it- and he was gagging for moments afterwards. 'Merlin, Harry, are you trying to choke me,' Draco exclaimed, and Harry laughed.
Draco splashed him, but not playfully. "You did die. You made that sacrifice."
-------------------------------------
Harry reached his hand up to touch his cheek, "This isn't real. It can't be." He sat up, and this time, Draco let him, in fact, he let Harry do a lot of things. He let him touch him wherever he wanted. Harry felt along his arms, and he scrunched up the sleeve of Draco's pajamas, running his fingers along his Dark Mark. Then, he looked up to Draco's neck, and he fingered the top button of his nightshirt.
"What's that?" Harry pointed at his chest.
"I was afraid. I didn't want to hurt you. Ever. When I saw you, I just didn't think about it. It was easy. But when my father escaped from Azkaban, he reminded me of it, and that's how I came up with the idea to propose to you. I thought it would break the contract. I never got to test out that theory, unfortunately."
"You know I," Harry tried to say through this teeth, but then Draco kissed him again, "came in here to," he said between kisses, "wake you up-- mhmm-- not be bloody kissed crazy."
"What do you mean?"
He slid down the wall, his legs weak and unable to hold on anymore. Pulling his knees to his chest, he sobbed into them in the hopes that that was the only thing he did tonight. Crying himself to death wasn't the way he wanted to go.
"Why would he be? I love him and he knows that, and he loves me, it's not that difficult."
"I want a boring life so much," Harry said. "I just want a boring, safe life in hiding."
"We have to get out of here," Ron exclaimed, although he couldn't think clearly because the thought of Draco Malfoy clogged his brain. Were they trying to kiss?
Draco nodded. "I faked it. I faked it because I was a coincided, two-faced bastard and to admit it out loud, I had a big giant crush on him before we even started it all." He flattened his mouth. "Of course, I didn't know that then. Funny how you can mix up love and hate so easily, huh?"
"Hi Harry." She had to have been a Fifth Year. She was both excited and nervous as she gave him a heart-shaped box. "This is from Shelly Fornash."
"How are you, Draco?" The question was a challenge to see how vulnerable he was, and he wouldn't allow himself to break. He kept his voice strong and consistent.
They both laughed mischievously and left, walking the empty, but incredibly peaceful Hogwarts halls to the Defense Against the Dark Arts Classroom. It felt different; they weren't children anymore for sure. They'd both aged and their bodies had changed, grown thicker and more mature. Harry always had rough stubble on his face, and if you told Draco he had a wrinkle (which he did) he'd hex you.
"Let go of the snitch, I caught it!"
"...I don't know... Forget it, I'm being stupid."
Draco looked stressed. Harry didn't know if it was because of his supposed crush, or because he was just reacting straight up stupid to his words.
"What kind of lover would I be if we had sex right now? I'm not putting your body through that! I'm not going to hurt you!"
Draco leant next to him, putting an arm on his shoulder, but still the image of seeing Harry this way—it hurt him, too. He didn't want Harry sick, and all he could think was,
"Ron," Hermione hit him.
After they finished watching their memories, nurses came in to take Harry back to his room, where there was a smoothie waiting for him.
"Harry-"
"Whatever." He looked away from her and shook his head.
." He saw Harry cringe at the word, so he felt like saying it again. "
"I was a Horcrux, I know," Harry spat. "Is there damage?"
This was a way to test out the waters of Phase 2. "How do you know I don't already have plans?" He was supposed to start working on the cabinet on Saturday. What an arse. Did Harry not understand that he was holding off working on murdering Dumbledore because of him?
“Don’t you dare say you two had sex,” Harry glared at him, using a deathly tone. He saw red.
Harry was finally free. Harry literally walked to his death, prepared to sacrifice everything after
He went back to his dorm room, eyeing Draco's initials on his bedroom before going into his own.
Harry ran to his room and Draco followed, and they both started stripping their layers. "What are you still doing here?"
To hide his frustration, Draco changed his tone. "Maybe I let you win."
TW: Emotional abuse
"Shh, it's okay," Dr. Barmer soothed.
"Years," Draco responded, pulling Harry close to him so they were hip and hip. He kissed his forehead.
"Hey you," Draco whispered. "You okay?" The summer breeze caused the curtains to sway and Draco smelt grass and dew and flowers. Harry had opened the windows.
It set Draco's cheeks red.
But the pain you feel isn't purposeless torture. It is the badge of honor you receive when you love someone.
"I have to go," Harry sped, and he grabbed his invisibility cloak.
The Boy Who Lived Twice was lying on the tan sofa when Draco opened the portrait door. The slytherin marched past him, leaving Harry staring at him wildly and Draco immediately went to Harry’s door, knocking on it.
Draco smiled and threw the cloak over him. "Caught me. Come on, promise I'll help you after."
"Yeah."
Potter laughed.
"That and, not to be boastful about it, but I do love you very very much. I could never bear to have you betray me like that. Like you promised, I find you as my refuge, and I if you went behind my back and stabbed me with a knife and got the Mark, I would have to rewire my brain to hate you again because it would be so hard knowing it was either fake, or not enough. I just don't want to get heart broken. I would want you to stand up for me no matter what, even in the face of death."
"Are you okay," Blaise asked.
"It's bigger than the entire Dursley's house combined."
"I'm not punishing you for being forced through this. Not right now. Just get through each day and we'll deal with the aftermath later, okay?"
"It's not." Draco quivered. "It's... I don't want to hurt you, I—"
"Hi," Harry replied nervously, "Ron there's something I need to tell you."
"Nothing?" Draco's eyebrows shot into his hair. "Doesn't look like nothing. If it was nothing, you'd let me see your hand and then I could see that it was nothing."
"Malfoy-"
------------------------------------
"Hey, shh," Draco held. "You're okay now."
---------------------------------------------------
Harry paused and then nodded. They both rushed to each other. Draco wrapped his arms around him, but Harry held him so tight, Draco couldn't breathe properly. Draco leant into him, rubbing his back. "I can't get his voice out of my head."
11:02
"What's that supposed to mean, Potter?"
"We could get married," Draco whispered in his ear. "We wouldn't have to worry about any restriction. Just have each other all to ourselves, like we're supposed to."
"I don't know if that's how that works..."
"On dearie, we wish you would have come sooner. Ron said you were constantly busy, can't imagine how, being all alone and all but, at least you're here now. So come on tell us what have you been doing these past two weeks?"
"Maybe," Draco yawned. "In the morning. Before you go."
"Is she okay," he whispered.
But yet, that spell was oddly the easiest of all of the Dark Magic he'd learned over the following weeks. They didn't use the lethal spells on him, though he watched the lethal spells occur (all on people who looked like Harry) and by time June passed, Draco had broken a bone in every one of his limbs, had all of his blood taken out of his body and put back in it while completely conscious for it, screamed until his vocal chords broke, and cried himself to sleep every single night.
Draco and Harry just stood there, watching her leave, unable to move.
"Listen, I understand that you may not want to participate in any activities whatsoever, but I do encourage that you get a bite to eat, maybe have some friends visit you." Her voice was as caring as it could be, which was surprising considering the fact that Draco had only seen her correcting any student that veered from her path. "Last night's event were traumatizing, but I would best if you were to-"
With no idea where this was going with Malfoy, his stomach turned over.
"Do you remember our date before Christmas? In sixth year?"
"Maybe he feels less intimidated."
-------------------------------------
He balled his hands into fists.
"Fortunately," Harry corrected, cheekily, wrapping his arms around Draco's waist and throwing his feet over Draco's lap. The cloak slipped off slightly, just at Harry's feet so he could see his sneakers. Draco covered it for him, and despite every fiber of his being screaming at him to push him away, make him leave, he absolutely couldn't, and he only put his arm around Harry's shoulder, looking as though he had it on the seat rest anyway. Harry fit his head into the crook of his neck again.
"And he finally cut my arm, and threw the blood into the batch. And then it all started to change," Harry shook, eyes vacant and empty, "Just like that... he was alive again. His snake eyes and all. Then all the death eaters started showing up, your father." Harry looked up and met eyes with his boyfriend for the first time since the story began. Draco felt so much disgust, he thought he were to throw up, and as a result, he put his other hand on his back, rubbing it.
Draco looked down at him and smiled. "I wouldn't have it any other way."
“Okay, I get it.”
It was worth the wait. It was
Harry nodded and gave him another kiss before wiping his mouth of more flour and then climbing into the fireplace.
"Another perfect potion again," Draco sneered. "I'm sure you're pleased with yourself."
"Can you try them for me?"
"So wait, but you fell in love right. For real."
The next one was of them laughing, which was Draco's favorite. He never knew he could smile like that. The third was a photo of Harry kissing him on the cheek while he was smiling and looking in the direction of him. The fourth was of them looking at each other in the eye in an eternal bliss. If you could sum up 'perfect' in one photo, that would be the one to use. The final one was of Harry kissing Draco, both their eyes closed, passion in the crease of their eyebrows.
“Do you think they're okay,” Neville asked.
“You don’t know how to cook. You leave you clothes around as if I’m your bloody servant! You’re not open minded. Your smirk makes me feel uneasy sometimes. I hate that you’re a liar and you deceive me and everyone you know in one way, shape, or form. I hate you! I hate so many things about you.
"What do you want," Harry laughed.
"Not let him crucio you. Not provoke him enough to evoke that much pain out of him."
"He helped me escape," Harry told. "That's when I forgave him. I knew everything with just one look in the eyes."
"Last time we wore our school clothes. I'm not doing that again," Draco eyed him. "Why are you looking at me like that?"
"Have I ever called you a freak, Harry? Have I?"
"I just... if he wanted to break our bond more than once. I just don't feel good enough for him if he doesn't want me. Maybe him forgetting me and our bond dying out is the best thing."
“Was is good?”
Draco smiled. "What color?"
“But-“
Draco took another deep breath before they met the other Weasleys outside. Ron, Ginny, George, Charlie, and Arthur were all on brooms, though Arthur hovered close to the ground. Ginny and Ron were at the forefront of it, though it looked like Ginny was winning.
"Surely you would have exposed your entire relationship to everyone," Emma concluded.
"Having fun."
"Yes."
The other held out his small hands, which were bloody, and his eyes were red from crying. "You killed them."
Draco nodded, staring into his eyes before looking him up and down.
Draco reached back and touched Harry's cock through his pants, and Harry licked his hips. He pulled at the string and Harry helped him get them down.
"I was told to get information by any means possible. I was expected to and there were other death eaters there evaluating me."
"Beyond repair."
"Oh, but Harry, don't you ever think about what could have happened if I just was a little more careful? If I'd just have buttoned my cuffs with different clasps?"
"Shut up," Harry said. "It's okay."
Whatever. Pansy was being stupid.
He closed his eyes and finally fell asleep for the first time without Voldemort invading his dreams all summer, the words 'I miss you,' leaving his lips before he fell a slumber.
"Nothing," Harry said. "Really, it's fine."
"I-I'm sorry, D-Draco! Please take me back, I n-need you!"
"How is it that Draco did remember?"
"Okay."
“Where did we want to go when we planned to run away together?”
He waited, his tailbone growing numb to the log he sat on, and waited, a lump in his throat, and waited whilst twiddling his thumbs, and waited, a frown growing larger and larger as time ticked, and waited and waited, checking his clock every two or three minutes until it was 11:32 and the sun had been asleep for hours.
"Draco... Damn it, Draco, wake up!"
"I know him," Harry stood tall. "More than you'll ever guess. Before the whole Death Eater situation, we were together for two years. I've seen his worst. I know how to handle it."
Hermione handed him a vial and then a bag full of a few hairs.
Ron nodded his head, "go on."
"Alright," Draco nodded his head, his anger leaving him. He turned to his class. "Read chapter one and take notes on it. You'll be turning it in so don't mess around!" There were groans and Draco shut the door on them. "What's the matter?"
"Mmm," Draco walked up behind him and kissed his shoulder. He pressed his hips to Harry's arse, and Harry licked his lips as he flipped one of them over. "Looks great."
Well past two in the morning was when he was only left alone for rest he knew wouldn't come. Not with his arm hurting as bad as it did, nor with his leg hurting as much as it did, nor with his scar burning as much as it did, nor with the fact a murderous sociopath had been brought back to life and an innocent and bright Hogwarts student was murdered right before his eyes and possibly all his fault.
Harry couldn't help but smile.
"So I take it two hours isn't going to be enough to pack then," Draco raised an eyebrow before sniggering.
Draco swallowed. “So maybe we should stop this now.”
But Draco didn't wake up.
"B-But what if there are good memories there, too? You don't want those?"
"He would just bring it up," another slytherin said.
Harry nodded, somewhat afar.
"What do you mean, you've never had the urge? You have a boyfriend. You've had to have thought about it at least once." Draco twisted his ring in his finger as he anxiously looked at the floor. But then Blaise pointed at his hand. "That's an abstinence ring."
"That doesn't sound like nothing. Slugclub? That's what you were doing at Hogsmeade."
“These do look professional though,” Harry smiled, before cutting into them.
"Can I rim you," Draco begged. "You said you wanted me to and I want to right now, I have to! You have to know what this feels like!" Draco grabbed Harry's hips and flipped them so he was on top. "Can I, please?"
"The Dark Lord lives in my house. Don't you think that knowing a bit of the magic he uses would be an advantage. I'm trying to learn some of the counter curses so I at least know what I'm up against."
“1.) Scarface is your nickname above all others. 2.) Stroke behind your ear to get you to calm down a.k.a. seduce you. 3.) Disallow kissing on the neck, it’s your favorite means of attack.  4.) Hugs before kisses make the kiss longer. I don’t know why you do that, but you just do. 5.) When cuddling, it depends on the mood as to which spoon you want to be, but your favorite is face to face. 6.) Whenever having a picnic, bring treacle tarts. They’re your favorite. Rule 8.) When dancing, wear steel toed shoes.”
And she had to admit: it was one of the happiest sights she'd seen in a while.
"They're going to find out! We-We can't hang out. He's going to kill you!"
"I know that's why you're so weird!"
"Oh, not at all," he bit sarcastically.
"N-No-" Harry tried to blink back tears. "Y-you're fine."
"What do I do?"
"No. Thank you for your help. Again."
To be honest, his expectations of Draco not even showing up were disappointed since a figure walked his way. He too had a broom in his hand, and Harry's heart skipped a beat when he saw the pair.
"I'm so sorry," Draco gasped for air. He handed him the newspaper.
But the selves that promised they were going to take things slow didn't have to know they did this. No one had to know.
————————————————
"Whatever, you know what I mean," Ron replied, "So are you two up for it? It's on Saturday."
"Please," Harry teared up, too. His lips quivered, and a hole grew in his heart. "Please, Draco. Just tell me you can so I can get through this."
He wished Harry was there, with him.
Harry changed his grip so they were arm in arm. "That's horrible."
“Did he torture you,” Harry demanded, grabbing his arm as Draco began to walk away. “Draco. What did he do to you?”
Draco was the first to break the silence. "It's weird, but I like it."
"We aren't leaving here until we can," Draco demanded. "I don't care if it's all night. It's not like we're breaking into the vaults at Gringotts. It's just French kissing, for Merlin's sake! Plenty of people can do it."
Harry, after a bit of silence and no movement, nodded his head and looked into Draco's eyes. Draco lay down next to Harry on the bed. It felt like a key into a lock when they were together, fitting one another perfectly.
"Hmm but what about the weather?"
"I assure you," Draco spoke, "I won't fail."
At first, Ron remained quiet, and then he burst out into laugher. "I'm not that desperate to find out. Mate, whoever it was, it can't be as bad as Draco Malfoy."
This time they were active: Draco moved his hand to Harry's neck and pulled him closer, and Harry put a hand on Draco's bicep. Their noses skimmed each other as their lips sucked leisurely. It felt as though they were on a cloud.
“I was just following orders,” Draco said coolly. Draco reached up with his neck and kissed Harry before the gryffindor pulled away.
"No."
"Harry I think you should read this." She handed him the diary, the last entry opened.
“Surely you were happy to see him, Harry?”
Draco scrunched his nose.
"Only if you write your name like that for the rest of the term," Harry negotiated. Draco looked at him. "It's basically official if you think about it. It's not like you're a Malfoy anymore. You're father's gone and your mother-"
The mumbling class chatter ceased when he walked in front of the group of Slytherins and Gryffindors, them all staring at him in awe.
“Why are you crying again?”
"Draco," Harry asked, his face full of concern. No one could see them, and only Ron and Hermione really noticed Harry walk to the back- which they contemplated him just saying hi to a past friend- not the catastrophic event occurring.
Draco took a deep breath. "The truth is I didn't ever want to tell you because I thought if you found out, then maybe you'd realize that it wasn't us falling in love, it was our bond. You'd think I wasn't good enough for you—"
Potter laughed. He actually
"Oh," Draco said softly. Harry started the top of one of his scars. He slowly made his way down his chest, biting his skin so it would leave marks over him, and Draco ran his fingers through Harry's hair.
And just when he thought he couldn't take it anymore, sobbing and hyperventilating, his anxiety peaked, and each wave was less than the last.
And Draco did, gasping. He sat up on the bed and wiped his face, and then realized as Harry lay next to him where he was or what he was doing. "Are you okay?"
"Four? I-In one night?" Harry's pupils widened more than Draco had ever seen. They were wild and hungry, and Draco had to give him credit for keeping eye contact with him, because there was a definite bulge in his trousers, so close to Harry's face that he could breath on it. All Harry had to do was bend down slightly...
Harry's eyes searched him until he fixed back on the ring. And then he froze.
And if they were together, Draco would have thought the pout on his face was cute. But they weren't, and it wasn't.
"I plan on it." He kissed his cheek. "Okay, I've got to go."
"Grounded me," Harry corrected him. "Reminded me I was still on this planet." And then he spoke lower, more insecure. "King of my body."
Draco also noticed how Potter would always blink at anytime he looked at the blonde. Three times he would do it.
"I'll try to come every night if I can."
It was surreal for Draco. He was just mourning Harry's death, no hope for him or his future, and now he was laughing harder than he ever had before, with Harry at his side. Hard enough to make him worry that he might actually die from it, because breathing wasn't possible. He gasped for air as he slammed his hand on the ground and rolled onto his stomach—but he just couldn't stop laughing. And Harry laughing too just made the cycle worse.
"Is he going to be okay," Harry swallowed, feeling oh so disgustingly sick and weak and—how could this happen; how could he do this?
They were all the way back at acquaintances. But they had a vicious history. So they were more than that.
"No, I'll be okay," Harry whispered back.
Draco was in a broom cupboard.
"You devised a plan to break my heart. I think that I deserve to know why it fell out. The fatal flaw?" He searched his eyes, and Draco said nothing. "You want you first kiss to be with the person you want to marry?"
He shook his head. "Anyway, I was always picked last at school because Dudley would make everyone hate me, and I think that Uncle Vernon made him do it. Dudley made sure I didn't have anyone. Him and his friends would shove my face in the toilets. Steal my gym clothes so when we come back from our exercise classes, I'd have to smell like sweat. He'd steal all of my things. He'd laugh at me, trip me... punch me... there were a few times I... passed out because he hit me so hard."
—oh no oh no, Harry." His breathing became shallow, knowing that Harry was a few floors from him on life support, his body made up of only skin and bones. "What's the date?" His voice was small and broken.
Harry dialed himself back. "I'm just scared something bad is going to happen to him. I feel sick."
"So why can't you tell me that," Harry's voice cracked, and he too looked out into the distance. "Fuck... you're not playing quidditch anymore... When did you even make that decision?"
"I can make you dreamless sleep potion. It would help. We can stop sleeping outside," Draco suggested. Harry shook his head in agreement.
“Yeah! There was this look in your eyes and I thought it was game over,” Harry said.
"Draco," Blaise grabbed him. "You're going to fall off."
"That should be a crime. I'm going to go to the minister's office and make it illegal for you not to smile."
"Harry please don't be mad at me! I'm so sorry! I- I didn't mean it!" Draco called from the floor. It grew quiet, waiting for an answer Draco's emotions triggered an excruciating amount of guilt. He waited and waited a few moments for anything from Harry until finally he heard a shift on the bed. Harry poked only his head and neck out, his mouth bleeding profusely down his chin.
"Probably one for headaches. I have a constant one, no matter how many potions I take."
"Oh," Harry frowned, "Sorry. Here, let me cast another—"
"He put that there!"
"You're under a lot of stress right now. You can't manage your grief and manage your relationship with food all at once. Just do the best you can. But you have to eat, even if it's just a little."
"Did I scare you," Draco asked, amusement in his eyes to hide his doubt.
"You heard my story. I'm not a Death Eater. Truly," Draco said. "If you won, you'd get your reputation back. You've never lost a case, and this will be the most public trial of the entire war."
After the initial two days, the shock did weaken, which left Harry to feel the burning, screaming, scalding, unbearable pain. A pain he couldn't see, or point at, because it was soaking in every one of his veins. It was behind his eyes. It was damaging his core, pulling apart each and every muscle in his chest.
You know, for such a small and bony frame, Harry was unimaginably soft. Soft skin, soft hair, soft... muscles? Sure...
"I'll be back for 6th year, I have to. I'm not dying a virgin." Harry didn't laugh. "Nothing's going to happen to me. And then you can suck me off on the train if you want to. Just rest now. It's a long travel day tomorrow."
"I'm not," Harry smiled.
Draco’s arm pulsed, but it was nothing to what his arm felt like. Was this it? Was this the end?
"Harry," Draco looked down at his lips involuntarily, "Don't."
"Promise?"
"Yes, and I'm fine! Now would you just shut up before you wake up the entire goddamned school!" Draco opened his mouth to argue back, but Harry spoke in a softer tone than what he was using before. "Really, Draco, I'm okay. Look, I have chocolate." Harry gave him a half smile. Draco didn't return.
"Harry." Draco remembered feeling his ribs at the beginning of term. He'd gained weight over the month and looked healthier, but Draco didn't want to point that out initially, however with a comment like that, he wasn't sure what to think. "I wanted to ask, but I didn't want to impose... you were... really skinny when you came back—"
Potter walked back to him. "What's the truth, then?"
"And I see you kissing her outside of charms right before Pumblechook's class, where you used to ignore me and act like I didn't even exist," he sobbed, and Draco did the only thing he could do: he wrapped his arms around him. Harry didn't hug him back. He just buried his head in his neck and weeped.
Harry nodded and took a breath, reaching out and rubbing his back. "Sorry. I don't mean to make you upset."
"Terribly." Which wasn't funny, but Draco couldn't stop himself from laughing some more. "The hell is wrong with you?"
"I don't know, nor do I care because I am so much happier without you! You're all about love and compassion, and if I ever truly loved you, would I have really forgotten? Would we be standing here having this conversation if I really loved you?"
“Fiancé,” Pansy asked again, being ignored. “Wedding!”
"Because he'll be dead by the Dark Lord."
"There won't be witnesses."
"I've never had a birthday party or anything either. They never even really acknowledged that I had a birthday. The best ones I had were when they forgot me completely because then I wasn't yelled at or whatever. It was only when Hagrid actually rescued me on my eleventh. It was the first time I had a birthday cake. Dudley ate it though, but then Hagrid gave him a pig tail so it was worth it."
She was right, their paths, his and Harry's, were alike, except the missing links from his paths in Draco's. "Were these memories missing with Mr. Potter," Madam Pomfrey asked.
"It's not your fault. It's the disorder. Just trying to be clever."
"I am too," Harry smiled, but then frowned.
“Did you propose to her?” The words made him sick.
"We just wanted to check on you, make sure you
“Aren’t you just a clever little-“
Harry fixed his form for him, adjusting his hand and loosening his shoulders. "As you cast it, think of that memory. Say the incantation, Expecto Patronum."
At breakfast just a little bit later, Draco was nibbling on a piece of toast peacefully when a tawny school owl perched itself right in front of his breakfast. It dropped a tiny roll of parchment precisely onto his plate, it’s feathers slapping his face once. He just smiled at the action and look up at Harry who was holding back a small giggle, instead of the predicted scoff.
Draco nodded, and Harry took his hand, and guided him to the bedroom, and at the sight of the bed, Draco immediately smiled a bright, happy smile. Draco let go of his hand and sat on the edge of the mattress, bouncing on it, and he heard a crack.
Harry woke to the heavy breathing of Draco next to him. It was moving his own messy hair and the air ran along his expression, barely on his neck. He was face to chest, and upon opening his eyes, he ran them along Draco’s scars. He immediately felt guilty and glided two fingers along them. Draco stirred slightly. Harry kissed right over his heart, and Draco bent his head while Harry leaned up to kiss him, causing them to bump each other. Draco let out a groan after his teeth smashed into the top of his mouth by Harry’s forehead.
It was 6:30 in the morning when Draco made it back to the defense against the dark arts classroom. He was crying and shaking. The boggart hadn't stopped talking the entire time, hours on end. It made him rethink the whole relationship and Harry's feelings for him.
He just cried. Cried for him. Cried for Harry. Cried for their relationship, and cried for his now stinging arm, which will eventually ruin everything they had. He cried because he had been branded with the Dark Mark.
. God, he liked boys. He liked boys so much.
"What's the point? My life is over." He squeezed Scar tight to his chest, pretending it was Harry.
Another nightmare.
Passing through rows and rows of empty cells, Harry started searching and he got more and more frantic. If it wasn't for the guard they would have thought it was a barren wasteland. Mr Weasley was trying to keep up, however his feet couldn't even keep up.
"Glance up and stare at him longingly. Just do it!"
"When was the next time you saw him," the girl asked.
Sleeping brought nightmares. Eating made him more uncomfortable than he'd ever admit out loud. Even if something tasted good, he'd feel guilty for eating it. Classes made him angry at best because he couldn't concentrate on them, and sad at worst, because all the students lost should be here with him. He couldn't take walks because he saw dead bodies in the hallways. Flying, again, reminded him of Draco. He didn't want to play with animals too much—it made him think of Hedwig, who he never got to mourn more than a second after she was murdered.
Harry smiled as Draco took a bottle with a stopper, put a green liquid in his hands, rubbed them together, and then pressed it into Harry's face. He did the same to his own face.
"I told him not to fight! I told him not to go out into battle, that bastard! He's such a moron!" Tears stung his eyes and he didn't know why that made him so angry. Good to know if it's life or death situation, Draco would refuse to listen to him. The entire time he was subconsciously playing with the necklace laced around his neck.
“You’re so hot,” he breathed.
"I'm sorry Harry."
He then lay on his side, ruminating over his thoughts, however just before he was about to fall asleep, he heard multiple pairs of rushed footsteps.
Harry's deep breathing caused his chest to bob up and down and he smiled, still splayed a top of Draco. He found himself lost in Draco's eyes again. They were particularly breath-taking when the sun hit them a certain way, as they were now. "S-sorry."
"What was that?"
"That? That's what you care about when I just told you your main competitor is outsmarting you?"
Harry ignored Blaise and stared into Draco's tired eyes. "It's the day we go on our first date in the real world... like a real real first date."
Before leaving the special place forever, he examined each and every inch of the magic. Silver reflected in the corner of his eye and curiousity involentarily took over and he found himself staring at the area it came from.
“I didn’t think it’d be this bad,” Draco admitted.
"What package?"
“Come in,” his muffled voice sounded though the door. She opened it and sat down on one of the chairs.
She stood. He guided her to the broom closet he and Draco used to hide in.
A redness overcame Harry in a way he couldn't control. Harry shoved him, and Draco shoved him back, raising a challenging eyebrow. Was he asking for a fight?
Harry didn't answer, just grabbed Draco's wrist and lead him from the Great Hall. He wanted to kiss him so much, but decided against it. He didn't want to scare him away just yet.
"I know," Draco said, "but he's at peace. He's in a better place. And he's happier there, where no one can hurt him. And he's with people who love him. And he'll be waiting for you."
"Harry, please," Draco said after he broke the kiss. "Please, my love."
"So is that bisexuality... no, more like pansexuality, I think. I would have to re-read to brush up on my knowledge of sexuality-"
