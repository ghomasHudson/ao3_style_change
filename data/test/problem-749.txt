“Very true.  Our class is learning the background history, we are also learning about the weaknesses and strengths of each creature or being I have assigned for each year.  I hope you don’t mind.  It is a defense class after all.” Harry explained.
“I followed the instructions you gave me, the snake bit my arm, but thanks to the Bezor, nothing major was affected. I was able to immobilize it and kill it after using the potion, though it just turned to dust.  I wasn’t sure what else to do, so I kept the dust in this pouch for you, just in case you might have need.” Mr. Weasley said as he reached with his good arm to take a small brown leather bag from his pocket. “The blade is also in the bag.”
“Tell anyone else who dares tangle with me or my friends, there will be a price to pay. You may be slytherin and sneaky, but I am craftier than you all by far.” Harry scolded.  He moved on hand in the counter pattern and she was released, and glared at him.
Harry looked at her for a moment, and saw Draco blush out of the corner of his eye. “At the moment only friendship. I am not known for focusing my attention in multiple areas.  I am interested in exploring the option you presented me with, but my main focus is Voldemort.”
“First, I will mention that I have recently found out that I have been given the power to be the next Augur Saeculum.” Harry noticed her eyes widened, “Last Month I was given a vision, where I lived out the last 20 or so years. To which end, I believe I owe you a life debt, even though your actions have not come to pass yet. Hence why I am here. I know you will do anything for your family. I am offering you my protection, and knowledge of how to keep your family not only safe, but out of the hands of the person who would destroy all you have built for yourself over the years. The name of Malfoy in the future will suffer greatly at the hands of Voldemort. Your husband will be imprisoned for crimes he has yet to commit, he will be demoralized by Voldemort. Your home will become the lair in which he resides. Your son will lose a very close friend, be forced to commit actions that will harm him mentally and get him hurt, but not killed. I will not tell you who wins, I want to know if you will make the decision, to save your family without knowing?” Harry explained, looking sharply at her, waiting for her to take it all in.
She shrugged, “I think it’s a part of the Augur gift.  I read that they had a way of calming people and convincing them of the best course of action to take.  Though, in many cases enemies were not susceptible to the ‘logic’ if you will.  I was wondering about Ron myself.  But then again, maybe I can influence him more than I thought” She blushed as she said the last bit.
“Yes, according to Hermione’s research, I am the next Augur.” Harry sighed.  Color had returned to Harry’s face, but it did not make Harry smile.  There was a resignation in Harry.
Harry looked at the headmaster, “Tom will not know, we know his secret. So he won’t be on guard, the potion will distract him to think she was frightened and is lost, not destroyed.”
“I’m not sure I can accomplish this… homework.” Severus stated, the last word was like chalk on his tongue.
“And I am repairing the relationship with Professor Snape.” He watched his godfather’s eye widen, “I suggest you start treating him with respect, without him, none of what I am doing now, or what I did in my vision would have been possible.  That man has suffered much, at the marauder's hands, and the hands of others, he deserves gratitude and respect...do try and afford him what he deserves, and leave petty rivalries in the past.”
“Thoughts?” Draco asked, blowing softly on Harry’s back.  The smooth skin was soothing.  Harry had disposed of his shirt and shoes later on during their flight frolicking.  Draco placed cool kisses against the heated skin.  A very slight sheen of sweat could be seen just between the shoulder blades.  Draco reached up and traced bits of wetness, his fingers playing down Harry’s back towards the edge of Harry’s trousers… Harry’s breathing was starting to get more ragged.
Narcissa heard curses coming from the other room and slowly made her way towards the sitting room.  She held tightly onto the cane trying to ignore the pain in her legs as she moved.  Once there she settled herself in an armchair.
“He is part of my task.  You have your knowledge now... Madam Bones, the choice is now yours.  Many on Voldemort’s side will know of my powers by Sunday… I am sure that will filter to the Minister soon after.” Harry said.
“Severus, I know we got off on the wrong foot years ago...I think we should put the bitterness behind us and let bygones be bygones.  Forgive me for the past indiscretions of a teenager.  We could turn over a new leaf.” Sirius stated with a conciliatory tone.
“Play around with the potion, since it has not ‘officially’ been developed, we could publish a paper together on it, when the time comes, both for it’s original use, and any other uses you may find.” Harry said, duplicating the copies of his notes and handing Professor Snape a set.
Harry pondered the letter and anger gripped him.  Draco did not ask and not once did the man fail to insult him.
It took Harry the entire time down to the dungeons to calm his body, his heart and his mind.  He had never experienced a kiss like that, not in his vision… and if his timing was right, not at all… He smiled.  That was his first kiss… sort of.  Harry’s grin got wider, it was amazing and incredible.  Harry’s knock on Severus’ office was mild to say the least, his head was elsewhere.  Severus opened the door, to a dazed Harry, a rose flushed dazed Harry.
Pansy squeezed her eyes shut, her hand went to her throat in a soothing gesture. “I … you obviously have won over Draco, I would consider myself more neutral than others, but I have yet to form my alliance, nor have my family.  I will consider carefully.”
“We have everything ready,” He said as he pulled out the papers he needed her to sign, “These are if you choose to file for divorce.  Mum set up property not far from here, its warded and there is money… If you let me, I can tell you how to invest it so you do not have to work.  You and Dudley can get out of here.  That is if you want to.”
Harry turned that over, it did feel as if he knew what to say to people, and knew when not to tell them some things.  “It’s not like the imperious, forcing them is it?” Harry was concerned about forcing people against their will, he would if needed, and he knew that.  Gringotts was the perfect example, but it left a bitter taste in his mouth.  Controlling people is not what he wanted, leading where the people had a choice was what made better sense.
Draco felt like he was drifting, he had thought to provoke Harry like old times for a reaction, but this…
Draco felt heady, his mind was in a blissful place.  The taste, the scent and the power were intoxicating.  He reached and undid Harry’s trousers, and immediately reached for the silk steel.  He was lost in the feel of Harry, perfect and sexy.  His face was level with the tanned arse he had admired for so long… one hand stroked and the other reached to part the soft globes, and he dove in… He tasted Harry, spicy and wild… Harry’s fall to his knees gave him better access, and he used both hands, kneading the soft flesh.  He was tentative with the strokes of his tongue, unsure, but Harry’s moans called to him.  He became more confident.  His tongue stroke inside Harry’s entrance earning him a cry of surprise. His own body was aching with need, he wanted to bring Harry such pleasure…
“Your manners are much improved from what I have heard,” Narcissa pointed out, “Thank you for the unexpected help.”
“I will be here, Albus will escort me I am sure.” Sanguini said looking towards the Headmaster who merely nodded.
“RON!” Harry called the redhead out of an obviously embarrassing thought as he went as red as a cherry.
This was to be a lesson for the Professor though.  Harry had to show him how best to sit for the meditation that starts the wall building.  Harry transfigured a few items into large seat pillows for each of them.  Harry took a seat on the floor, and pressed his feet together out in front of him, his legs making an almost perfect diamond. He instructed the professor to follow his lead, no matter how silly it made him feel.  Snape was a bit grumpy about looking like a jellyfish that had been stunned.
“No.  He arrived just after, and departed quickly after a few exchanges of spells.” Mr. Weasley informed them.
The blond’s heat drew him in, just the feel of Draco pressed against his back gave him a feeling of being centered.  His body was not immune to the heated mouth pressed against his back.  He did not know he was that sensitive.  He did not move, not sure what Draco had in mind.  Draco’s mouth and tongue massaged his aching muscles and his body was heating up.  He wanted nothing more than to reach behind him and claim his husband's mouth as his own.
The next day brought with it sunshine in spite of the chill outside.  Saturday, was a Hogsmeade day, most of the students would be out of the castle.  Harry was looking forward to this day, he had a plan.
Hermione only shrugged, “That’s really all I know, basic really. But YOU could go look it up if you're that concerned about it.”   Ron laughed, “She has a point mate, can’t use her as a dictionary all the time.”
Draco walked up and wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist.  Harry was standing on the veranda looking out at the dark sky, full of stars and a receding full moon.
“First”, Harry looked at Ron, “I need to talk to your dad if you can arrange it within the next few weeks, and time is of the essence on this one.” Ron nodded, “I’ll firecall him in the morning.”
“Look at me.” Severus said, his voice pitched low, seductive and coaxing. It was like coaxing a little hurt animal to trust him.
It was not a soft plea, this was a plea from the soul. Draco knew if he disobeyed, the consequences would be tremendous and Harry would break. Usually, Draco would plead his case for independence, he would fight to stay uncaged. But after the last time… he knew there was no way he could be alone… His hand came over Harry’s arm, soft and warm.
Severus looked at the young man, not yet removing his hand, afraid to let go and watch Harry slip away again. “What can I do to help?”
Draco would go anywhere in the state he was in, his body was heated, his arousal was very annoying against his pants, yet just holding hands with Harry was enough.
“Sure pup, what’s up?” Sirius asked.  Harry beamed upon hearing the sound of Sirius’ voice, the nickname and just looking onto that face that may be sleepy, but it was alive.
Ron, Harry and Draco both mounted their brooms, and then took off… Harry felt free...the wind in his hair, the taste of freedom, the tensions flowed away on the breeze.  He spiraled, zigged and zagged, dropped and pulled up, then flattened his body against the broom letting the air flow around his body.  He was flying, so fast the other two stopped to watch.  Harry was a blur, shooting across the area like a bullet, almost too fast to see.  Then they watched him soar straight up and freefall towards the ground.  Draco gasped, his heart racing watching Harry plunge once again...Parts of his anatomy were paying attention to every angle of Harry’s body as it flowed as one with the broom.
Harry explained the entirety of the meeting to Sirius, including the role of Draco. He blushed as he talked about Draco, not revealing their intimate contact... Evidently Sirius saw it, his mouth twitched into a slight grin.
Draco had decided to sit with Harry for breakfast that morning.  The conversations around the table were normal everyone chatting about the restriction and the loss of Quidditch.  Ron groused more than most, he really had been planning on doing so much better to get on the team.  Hermione tried to engage Draco into conversation on their previous potions class, which started a whole new round of chatter amongst the table.
Inexplicably Harry bristled at the idea of Draco having deficiencies. But he kept his logic in control, Lucius was just strategizing.  Either way, these interesting responses were enough for Harry to note them and wonder at the meaning of their involuntary nature.
“What happens if I get pushed into the webbing, Mr. Potter?” Severus asked, wary of the implications.
“Lie back, I want to fuck your throat until you're so hoarse you can’t talk.  Then, and only when I am right at the cusp, will I fuck your ass. You are not to close your eyes at all… just look at me. Trust me.” Harry instructed his voice raw gravel now.
Harry had expected to land back in his own room, but found himself slowly descending in a small outskirt clearing just inside the Forbidden Forest. Upon his feet crunching the fallen leaves, he turned abruptly to point his wand at the person in his peripheral vision who stood up from near the trees.
“Did you never wonder why I never left you alone, Severus?” Sirius was desperate not to let the man flee.  Severus turned his dark gaze upon him and he took a breath.  He didn’t trust himself to speak.
Draco sat down and turned to Harry amid the chatter that had grown in the room.  There were glares from some of the other slytherin’s at the change of seating.
Harry met with Ginny the next morning before breakfast.  There was a hesitation in her eyes.  He knew she feared the friendship with Malfoy more than anything.  It was strange seeing her like this.  Young and innocent.  He knew her so well, at least he thought he had.  Their arguments had grown over the last two years in his vision.  They had reverted back to just friends with tempers after Lily was born, there was never any fiery passion with them.  She had told him that much when she revealed she was falling in love with Dean again.
Harry wanted more. He needed more. One hand lifted to cup Draco’s face, as his body relaxed against the wall.  Those lips parted as his fingers stroked the petal-soft skin of pale cheeks.  Harry took that as an invitation.  His hand waved to provide the privacy of a quick wandless disillusionment charm, and he dove in.  Harry tasted all of Draco’s mouth, it was extraordinary, heaven.  He could drown on the taste of Draco, lemon and sugar.  His hand glided into that silky hair, holding on, changing the angle so he could drink in Draco’s kiss from all sides.
Harry had drawn up a list, that included Draco and others he knew would be trustworthy, and needed the training.  He also included a few younger years that had Hermione looking at him quizzically, but she deferred to him that decision.  She was especially reluctant to allow the Creevey brothers, but Harry was adamant they stay.  That was one loss that had struck him to the bone because of how young he was at the time.  Their first meeting would be held within the school at an undisclosed location, Their parchments would transport them to the training location and back to their dorms at the appointed time, so no ‘rule breaking’ would be an issue.  Of course this time, Harry charmed things himself, having had years of practice working on untraceable portkeys.  He would also inform the Headmaster, Professor Snape and Professor McGonagall of their activities, and provide each of them with the list of charms, curses, and counters he would be teaching.  This should allow for any necessary interventions where needed.
“Mr. Potter? Are you coming in?” Severus asked, a smirk hanging on his lips.  The boy looked like he had just had a tumble.
Harry grimaced a moment before replying, “I had a vision where I lived out my life for the next 21 years.  It was not a single event, it was a lifetime.  I saw war, death, love, births, etc.  I lived it all the good and the bad.  According to research, there is only a few people that have living visions, they are the Augur Saeculum, the seer of the age, like Merlin.”
“When I bring him around, let me ask a couple of questions just to make sure it is working…” Harry directed his Aunt, “Then you ask away…”
“Everything is back the way it should be, Harry.  Vince has several detentions with Filch, but I don’t know if that will keep him occupied enough.” Draco replied.
“Why?  You will never be Harry.  Be Ron… He can never be you, just as he could never be me.  We are all different.  He comes to you for things he can’t do… think about that.  Be the best Ron… and let Harry be Harry.” Draco said, watching the redhead seem to grasp the concept.
Harry left his research after Draco’s reply came.  The plea tugged at something dark within Harry… He needed more than mere words.  Words were easy.  He needed to see those silver eyes pleading with him.  His groin tightened as more images passed through his mind as he penned his reply.  His heart beat faster as after he sent it.  He wasn’t sure Draco would do it, but in the off chance the man surrendered his pride, he would be waiting.
The Defense Group had progressed splendidly. They were able to cast counters quickly, healing charms were still being worked on, and Imperious resistance was included every other week. Draco, Dumbledore and Professor Snape were the only one’s close to resisting his full power curse. Dumbledore was still eyeing him and niggling him to use his full power...Harry wasn’t really ready to show that to the old man yet.
Harry left and decided to spend some time in the Library researching his interesting change in Patronus.  He would also make sure his plans were in place for the preparations of the next Defense club meeting the next evening.
Harry gently pushed. And Severus found himself standing in his classroom, wand still pointed at the boy. He lowered it immediately.
“It is Sept 12, 1995, Harry.” Dumbledore offered, waiting to see what the boy would say before he asked him some obvious questions.
Narcissa nodded. The hour was almost up, she pulled out a small coin. “Take hold of this, and upon the hour, it will bring you back to where you belong.”
“We didn’t enjoy it, Draco, we savored it.” Harry offered, slipping his fingers over the soft skin in his hand, “I was very surprised, and now I am delighted to find something wonderful after so much pain. What do we do?”
She looked at him as if seeing him for the first time, and stood up, and hugged him.  She wept on his shoulder and he let her.  His hands soothed her and he patted her back, it was the best he could do…A burden clung to his shoulders still, not yet ready to fall.
“I’m sorry professor, when I see you sometimes, for me it’s like seeing a ghost.  I’m still haunted by memories from the vision, they haunted me my whole life, and probably will continue to haunt me.” Harry explained quietly, finally looking away.
Harry felt good on his way to the hallway.  He was starting to feel more like a colleague to his teachers, instead of just a student.  And though his biological age was one of 15, he was definitely feeling more like the self that he had become.  It was strange to think of his other life as just a vision, because to him, this was like going back in time, not waking up from a dream.  Reality of now was starting to become a part of him, allowing him to feel like he belonged. Not belonging as young Harry, or as Harry from his vision, but more an acceptance of who he was because of what he is.
The man slumped again...Severus looked angry, his wand out.  She sat there in utter shock and stillness...She let her hold on what she had known slip… and it was gone… Her life, her understanding of everything now overshadowed by the truth.  She was changed… reality steeped in, the pain, the truth… the horrible truth.
Harry stood and so did Snape when they heard the car pull in the drive.  Petunia sat rigid in her chair.  Vernon huffed and puffed all the way in the house, and his clamoring was raucous in the silence that had been.
Harry had already set a good schedule for what he would be teaching.  He was going to run it similar to the trainings he had for Aurors, but toned down.  The charms included normal privacy charms, disillusionment charms and perfecting the patronus charm.  He would include some new charms and curses, such as the Reduccio charm, and the Sectumtempus, and a few others based on jinxes.  The counter curses for some of the more well-known Death Eater curses, and a new counter to Crucio, Sonabona which could be tested with the Afflictio curse which was allowed and much less painful.  He would teach them how to resist the Imperious, if allowed.
“You may, Mr. Potter.” She replied, elegance and indifference conveyed in her tone and bowing her head gracefully.
Harry sat at the desk in his office at Grimmauld Place.  The room was dark, with only two lamps in either corner bringing soft light into the room.  The walls were made of either dark ebony wood or bookshelves.  Only one window was set into the wall, and it faced the darkened street.  Harry rarely looked up from his work.  He was working on research for an experimental potion.  One of his friends had asked if there was a potion for coloring fabric since the charm only lasted a few hours.  They wanted something not permanent but would last for an entire day or longer.
Looking out from the empty tower, down onto the ground.  Dumbledore’s broken body lay askew, his once twinkling eyes empty and dead.
They took care of everything, the packing, the calls, the arrangements.  Once Vernon was happily on Marge’s doorstep they apparated back to Hogsmeade.
"Can you feel me now?" Harry whispered as he bent over Draco's form, letting his words slip into the blond's ear.
“Try again, this time don’t insult him.” She stood and walked out slowly, parchment still in hand.  Once she got to her room she smiled.  She loved her son, but he could do with a tune-up to his attitude and she knew just the tool to use, plus she really needed something for the pain.
Watching the two kiss so sweetly, so passionately was worth everything.  She had found Harry’s match, they would have just as tumultuous a relationship as her and Ron.  She glanced down at her boyfriend, but they would have a strong love of it too.
Mr. Malfoy accepted the coin and bowed low, a courtly gesture one might say, to Harry, who became speechless at the formality extended to him.  Highborn wizards do not bow, heads of a Pure-blood family do not bow, unless loyalty is being offered.  Dumbledore, Narcissa and Draco were waiting for Harry’s answer to Mr. Malfoy’s offer.
“Just two more treatments and your legs should be good as new,” Harry said, offering her the last two vials of the potion he had created for her.
After Harry left, Snape decided to firecal the mutt and accept the offered apology.  Only for Harry’s sake though, nothing else.  The mutt appeared, and his smile grew.  “To what do I owe the honor of your call, Severus?” Sirius asked, kindly and a bit too huskily for Severus’ taste, did the mutt have company. Something in his gut twisted at the thought, but he pushed the feeling away.
“For now, do not trust him.  Trust me, Hermione and Ron.  There is much going on, more than even the teachers and the headmaster understand.  I promise you, all will turn out as it should, one way or another.” His gaze was filled with honesty and compassion.
Harry had to take deep breaths to calm himself.  He desired Draco more than he had any past girlfriend or boyfriend.  He was also second-guessing his actions.  This started out as revenge and punishment.  But the more he let himself feel with the blond, the more he realized that he wanted so much more.  Would Draco still want this after he had completed Mrs. Malfoy’s potion?  He would have to clarify some things before he did the one thing he could not take back.  A blowjob was one thing… Giving Draco his virginity was another altogether.
Millicent was torn, but they were waiting, and Draco’s side was bigger, so… she moved towards the rest of the pack.  Vince stood alone.  “Were not eating with Gryffindors though…” Pansy thought she would throw that in there.  Vince backed off.
A/N~Another chapter that is only part of a day... Christmas day will be two chapters... So much goes on in Harry's life... Lol.
“I will circulate the news immediately, as it is known that Draco has befriended you,” Mr. Malfoy stated, “If anything, I will write through Draco since I know they will only see it as a way for me to convince him of his deficiencies.”
Harry slowly pulled Draco to his feet and moved them towards the transfigured bed.  Harry captured Draco’s mouth again in another heated kiss, more demanding than the last.  He could kiss Draco forever, that mouth driving him wild as their tongues danced together, and hands were soft against silky skin.  Harry wanted his own tasting.
Harry sighed. He would live the same path over and all those people who died would still die, if he rejected this new power and role. If he chose to change things, he chose to keep the power and responsibility.
Harry nodded and walked out the doors, heading for his rooms, a place he hadn’t been in years, so it felt alien to walk the path again.
Harry was happy for them, they seemed so much more alive when they were together.  Not just happier, but more free.  They chatted about the upcoming defense club meeting later that evening, and about some of the strategy Ron and Harry had discussed earlier.  Hermione weighed in and agreed with Ron, which was no big surprise to Harry.
“There has to be a connection between what I just was shown and what I heard from Voldemort’s meeting,” Harry explained. Draco moved closer, not wanting Harry to leave him yet. Harry opened up his arms.
“Look at me.” Harry’s voice was soft, comforting and melodic.  Even Snape off to the side started to lean in before he caught himself and turned away.
“I’ll tell him, it’s not like this was something I meant to keep.  I have been busy, and it’s just, and well… I don’t know Hermione, I have been trying to keep some distance with Draco and me.  I’ve gotten to know him, I trust him.  And it’s well… overwhelming and amazing all at the same time.” Harry was trying to explain, but he felt like he was doing a poor job, when her left eyebrow went up, “Look, even though I got married and had kids in my vision, this is new to me… I know the path I chose in my vision wasn’t the right one, and with that person, I had something normal, but nothing as ...I don’t even know how to describe it…”
There would be no running. The shock from Harry wore off quickly, the smooth soft lips pressed to his, filled his mind with a sensual haze.  Draco was astounded, his body reacted to this kiss, the scent of Harry, clean and spicy, his eyes shut involuntarily.
Harry didn’t move, his attention was completely captured.  Did Draco know the power of just his scent and eyes?  Draco’s quick intake of breath removed Harry’s control.  It had been too long.
Mr. Weasley looked up at Harry and smiled.  Mrs. Weasley ran to Harry and smothered him in one of her hugs as she cried her thanks out to him.
Draco groaned, if anything he knew Harry was the better flyer… plus it was totally unfair he had all those years...but if he was rusty because old guys don’t fly...He just might have a chance.
Harry was stunned to see two sleek owls at his window later that evening.  He took the new letter from the same dark owl and set it aside.  Then took a thicker parchment from the golden eagle owl.  He decided to save Malfoy’s letter for last, he did not need to be in a bad mood for whoever sent him the second letter.
“This connection, has brought us to a point where we have called a truce and have publicly become friends.  My thought was to let this cause a ‘rift’ between Mr. Malfoy and yourself Mrs. Malfoy.” She tried to speak, but Harry cut her off, “Hear me out first, then we can discuss the ‘merits’ of this strategy.  First, the duration will not be long.  Second, it is necessary for Mr. Malfoy, actually it is imperative for him to remain in the grace of Voldemort until June.  I know he is obsessed with the ministry and a prophecy.  I want everything to proceed as it was meant to until he moves on the ministry when he thinks he can get the prophesy.  If things work as they did in my vision, we can take care of things before everything can get out of hand.”
Mrs. Weasley was about to object, but Mr. Weasley and Sirius both shook their heads.  Snape watched the display with a smirk.  The mutt knew, he was sure of it.  Albus addressed them all and let them know of Harry’s new status, with the added implication that should they be called upon, they should help any way they could.  All of them in the room knew the cost of interfering with an Augur and their mission.  The mission was all consuming for an Augur, any side ventures could cost the Augur the advantage and ultimately deprive every one of their guidance if the task was not complete.  And in this day and time their world needed guidance more than anything.  Severus was uniquely surprised that when the mutt spoke during the meeting he actually sounded sensible.  Though Severus never commented on it, he did note it. Sirius was also impeccably dressed tonight, Severus noted that too…unfortunately.
“I will not disclose everything now, sir, if you don’t mind, as I am unsure what to share. I will ask one thing of you that will help me verify what I lived through and help me understand where to go from here. There is a prophecy that was spoken, Voldemort marked me, and the reason neither can live while the other survives is because Voldemort made several Horcruxes with which he is able to continue to live on. Is that true, or a false trail left by my vision?” Harry asked, his eyes intent and searching.
“You are exceptionally well gifted at designing charms, Harry. Excellent work!” The Headmaster praised.
Harry nodded, and then informed the surprised headmaster of the details of the coin, Dumbledore’s eye twinkled in good humor over the interesting turn of events.  This would turn into their favor for the plan they had developed for the Malfoys.  The new found friendship would create a ‘rift’ in the family, leaving Lucius on the side where he was needed, and Narcissa and Draco out of it.  Dumbledore explained his thoughts to Harry, trying to let the boys see the reason behind it.
Harry turned towards the students.  “This charm is both offensive and defensive.  It successfully negates any pain curse, and attacks two of the senses of the caster, sight, and sound, ensuring their focus is deterred.”  He lifted his wand and demonstrated the flicking movement for them.  After this, each student, the Headmaster, and Professor Snape were practicing the movement over and over.
Draco stood off to the side, hoping to control his reaction to another person...It seemed his mind recognized Ron as safe...He smiled at that…It must not be everyone he would shirk away from.  He moved to start casting cleansing charms to remove all their dust and grinned down at his husband and the redhead.
Could he really pursue Draco?  Could he build something other than friendship right now?  Harry thought about that.  Voldemort again was the most pressing issue.  He would have to choose to focus there for now.  He wasn’t sure he could afford to spread his focus too thin.  He had plans to make, preparations to ensure, and He still needed to talk to Ron about strategy… Ron was an excellent strategist, or well... he would be.
Severus shook his head, and pushed himself off of the man.  His head was still spinning.  He had never actually kissed anyone, and that was unnerving.  His control was shattered and his mind was starting to bring up the guilt he should feel for betraying his love of Lily this way.  He scrambled to his feet and swayed towards the fire to leave.
“So the Death Eater has finally come home.” A slurred voice drawled from the dark corner of the room, “Meeting with your master go well?”
Harry barely heard the words, so entrenched inside his own head, forced by the flash of memory he associated with those eyes.
“He is supposed to listen to you...right?” Amelia asked, but she knew the answer to that.  The minister was so paranoid he would waste the opportunity.
“That he actually got dressed up to apologize,” Snape said, and Harry caught something in those eyes, that he probably should not press.  Snape had evidently liked the fact that Sirius had dressed up, the soft rose tinge to his Professor’s cheeks were the indication.
“Now you sound like a father…” Sirius said, not trying to mock, but Harry’s face turned into sorrow, “you were a father in your vision?” his voice softer at the question.
Harry greeted him with a grim smile. He ushered Harry to his sitting room, only to see the man’s eyes grow wide when it took in the corner of the room. Tables pushed out of the way, books scattered across the floor and a broken bottle on the floor.
Harry picked it up, his seeker reflexes had never diminished. “In due time, Professor. I have a safe place for it, and that is all you need to know for now. You will be informed later.”
Harry looked around, trying to control his breathing… Dumbledore was standing in front of him, Snape was next to him… he wasn’t dreaming...or was he… “Pinch me please.” He asked, almost hoping it wouldn’t hurt if they did. Ron reached over and pinched his leg. “Damn!” Harry muttered.
Hermione was very impressed with the attention to detail he had shown in his plan.  She was also very eager to learn the spells and practice them… Though he was tempted to give her early lessons, he decided it was best to teach all at once and together, so they could all progress equally.
Harry stood there, still calm, still self-assured, and lifted his hand. “So can we start over and call a truce?” Severus stared at the hand, wondering at the kindness, so like Lily. He took hold of Harry’s hand, and Harry pulled him closer, and then hugged him. An almost paternal feeling came over him, and he returned the hug as best as he could, with a pat here and there.
Harry went to ensure Draco would be acceptable first before dragging one of his friends home with him.
“I’m going to have to write to my Aunt.” Harry said with an almost monotone voice. Draco sat up, looking at him puzzled.
The door opened and his Aunt in all her state stood there looking at him awkwardly.  He knew he looked different, but the puzzlement on her face was so funny he almost laughed.
She felt honored.  Months ago she would have laughed in his face, or dismissed him entirely.  In her realistic world, there was no ‘sight’, nothing you couldn’t prove without good logic… She only hoped she could keep his good opinion.  He did not press her, and she left his office in a pensive state.
Harry pulled the blond closer, “Then don’t...I have already told you...I can’t settle for normal after you.” Harry whispered the words as he pulled Draco down to his lips slowly pressing onto trembling pink ones. Harry took his time, tasting every corner of Draco’s sweet mouth. He pulled back, enjoying the dazed look in silver eyes.
Harry sighed, at least there was no danger to Mr. Malfoy at this time.  He would have to monitor his link with Voldemort just in case.
Harry walked through the door, watching the headmaster pop a new candy into his mouth and sigh as he leaned back into his chair enjoying the morsel.  Harry smiled when those twinkling eyes met his own.
Harry breathed a sigh of relief, he had not expected resistance, but he also had not expected an easy path either.  It was all attributed to his new status as the Augur, he was sure.
“I have two things to discuss with you, and would appreciate if you would be open enough to listen, as they benefit you.” Harry said, turning only half-way away from the Professor, while quickly performing a locking charm on the room.
“I think so, but I don’t tell everything.  I seem to know what to say and when, but I know I am not supposed to tell everything to any one person, only revealing that which will help where I need it to.  In a way I feel like I’m manipulating people.  I don’t like that really.  But I do try to give them enough information to make an informed choice. I am not sure if I can talk about some of the tough stuff, like deaths with those who died, so I’m not sure.  The hardest part, is I still feel like an adult, though being a teenager is sort of coming back, I don’t think you really lose that when you grow up.” Harry laughed a little.  It was a like releasing a burden, just talking to Sirius.
Harry groaned and walked swiftly to the bed and roughly grabbed Draco’s face between his palms and ravaged that mouth, he bit, he thrust, he sucked and he swirled.  He commanded that mouth and Draco melted for him. He reluctantly pulled back.
“Care to exchange partners for the class? We might be able to spread some more gossip.” Draco grinned.
Harry continued, “I know it would be out of character for you to break from your family, of anything I know, is that Malfoy’s are loyal but family is first.  All I ask is for a pretense, Voldemort will not suspect, he knows nothing of loyalty or family.  So far that is all I have, I am open to suggestions.  All I know is that Draco and Mrs. Malfoy are not needed for certain events to unfold, Mr. Malfoy, you are.”
The students were grouped into three groups.  Each group lined up in front of the provided mechanical death eater. They were to practice casting the Sonabona counter first, then the second round was a rotation of separate hexes by the mechanical death eater to encourage the students to practice their repertoire of charms and counters.  The teachers were on hand to quickly heal any curses from the mechanical death eaters that got through to the students.
Severus saw every emotion play across that face, based on the memories he witnessed he could guess what was going on in that mind.
They made their plans, and then Sanguini departed via the floo.  Harry and Albus decided to discuss plans for the upcoming Privet Drive event.  Harry wanted to take up the discussion with Ron, later that evening to iron out the particulars.  They would hold an Order meeting that Saturday to discuss the final details.
“The next one I will show you, is from my vision. I show you only so you know how to protect yourself should it ever come to pass. My mother only wanted your happiness, not this.” Harry said and he touched a dark brick.
She nodded, “I won’t make waves in whatever you are doing, Harry.  As a friend, you should know I won’t do that.  But I won’t accept it right away either until I’m comfortable.”
“Today we will work on just conjuring it.  The first step is to find your most happy memory.  It has to be powerful.  Once you have it, dwell on it, let the happiness of the memory fill you up.  Then one at a time, say ‘Expecto Patronum’ while pointing away from your partner. I’ll come by to give each of you tips on your posture and wand movement, and if you need help with the memory, I’ll do my best to guide you.” Harry said.
“Yes, professor, 21 years. Can I change any of it?” Harry asked, hope sprung into his eyes, a longing was there, that Albus had not seen in a long time.
“He was trying to protect me from the book your father passed on. He has been attached to me since I freed him. He saved many lives… Ron, Hermione, Luna, Olivander, Griphook, and mine…” Harry explained, he let the tears fall without blinking them away this time. “He was a good elf, a friend...and like so many, he died to protect me…”
Everyone seemed entranced when seven patronuses stood before them. A silver otter playfully running about, a hare following after the otter, a rather large frog, a small dog and a stallion.   Most of the group stared at Harry and Draco’s patronuses.  Harry was staring concerned by the exhibition of two lions circling one another.
“Professor, I’ll confess what I say next will sound strange.  Over the years, in my vision, I grew to understand you after your death.  I saw you more as someone to look up to, to try to emulate and to respect.  In a way after your death, you became like a godfather of sorts to me, a part of my lost family.  I know I currently have Sirius, and he will always be what he always was.  Do you think it strange for me to see you as a paternal figure for me?  In my life I have always needed, or at least the mind healers told me so, people to surround me and offer that which I needed the most in my life, true affection.  Not just a desire to see me fulfil some destiny, but to form a family of sorts.  I would be honored if you would consider that.” Harry confessed, rather nervously.
When it was late, and time to leave, Severus thanked him for the lesson and they parted for the evening.  Though, Severus let him know he would also like to attend one of the ‘defense club’ meetings during the time they taught some of the newer spells.
Harry didn’t last long in the Library.  He had only found the same information Hermione referred to… Maybe Sirius can shed some light, or Professor Snape.  Harry had some other planning to do, and he needed to start working on how he would save Sirius from dying. And Harry needed to start working out his defense club strategy for the next day.  So Harry approached Madam Pince just before the library closed to check out a couple of catalogues.  He had an idea as he looked in the catalogs, and found exactly what he needed.  Ron, won’t be happy, and probably won’t help, but this just might do what he needed.  Armenian Silk Spiders.  Harry scratched his order and sent it off.  He would need to talk to the headmaster to commandeer an empty room.
Draco appeared, his blond hair falling in several directions, as if he had run his hands through it several times. This gave him an almost unrefined look, it suited his face, and made Harry ache at the beauty that it presented.  Draco moved closer to Harry his silver eyes slashing into curious emeralds. “Only friends Harry?  Did you feel nothing in those moments?”  Draco’s breath ghosted over Harry’s ear as he leaned closer.
“They will come...At least Death eaters.  What do we need to do for me to show my power with the least amount of exposure and damage? Who should we use?” Harry looked at Ron.
Harry felt a darkness rip through him. He reached down and grabbed Draco’s hair and pushed the man’s head back. The moan that slipped from Draco’s mouth made his cock jump.
Draco was fuming, and still pacing the carpet in the sitting room long after his mother left.  He did not understand, he did not see what was wrong in his letter.  He asked for help even saying he would do it himself if he could. He walked over to the desk in the corner and tried again.
Family… in her head that was the word that rang true.  Harry was family and he was hope in her upside-down world.
They set up a brewing station at one of the desks, and Harry started calling out the instructions for the disposition of the ingredients.
Draco’s answering smile showed how elated he was to be included, “Always.”  He wanted Harry to know that he could be counted on, that he would be there for Harry.  He did not understand this relationship yet, and it scared him a little, but he would finally do something right.  He would commit to Harry.
“I… He has been good for me too.” Harry said, his eyes falling to his hands briefly before looking back up, “I would like your permission to ask him to bond with me.”
“I should be the teacher… you two are horrible...Should be able to exit a floo without so much dust and soot.” He said smiling the entire time.
“I’ll take that into consideration, Mr. Potter. I am not used to taking teaching advice from a student.” Severus quipped.
Draco looked at Harry’s face, the one he had seen a million times over the last 8 years.  The face that taunted him, caused him to hate, caused him to fear, and caused him to be safe.  This one man, who he had battled with for so long, was standing here, had worshiped his mouth, turned him inside out and made him weak with desire.  He saw a new face.  A handsome face, sexy, confident, and hungry.  Draco shivered at that last revelation, he sighed softly.  Harry’s eyes darted to those lips, and Draco pushed forward wanting more.
Her face was impassive, her posture regal. If any of what he said affected her, she did not show it in her face. Her eyes were a different story. There were flashes where her eyes grew dark, and then bright.
“I too have needed some time to get used to your new abilities and knowledge, Harry.” Dumbledore started, “I have seen you as this little boy for so long, and on the outside, you still are.”
It would be strange shedding his Malfoy demeanor and just being Draco.  How would Harry’s friends receive him?  Would Ron hit him, or worse Hermione?  Draco absently rubbed his nose, long fixed, but the echo of her rage was still there.  He cringed a bit on the inside.  His own friends, he wasn’t sure about.  He had been toeing the Malfoy line for so long, was it too late?  Greg would be easier, he was like a pliable teddy bear, apt to be nice, but mean if you threatened one of his friends.  And he was loyal to Draco who had sort of adopted him in the first year.  Vincent may be tricky, his father was a real supporter and Death Eater.  Blaise was more neutral and Pansy, well he wasn’t sure where Pansy’s loyalties lay.  Others in his house he was wary of, so many were Death Eater children, brainwashed to actually believe the rubbish the Dark Lord spouted.  Most were not even pretending.
“Do you remember last month when I ran out of Divination?” Harry asked, his eyes were just starting to focus on Draco once again.  It was like waking up from a nightmare, only to enter a dream.  Reality was not tangible for Harry, so much was muddled from a vision that seemed real, maybe it was real, and this only a dream.  Harry was brought back by the sound of Draco’s voice.
“What bothered you more, Sir? That he tried to act like an adult, or that he apologized?” Harry asked, curious for the answer.
“I have spoken of the prophecy to only colleagues and the order, Harry, so that part would be a true vision. The Horcruxes I have only supposed, there is nothing I have been able to prove on that front, though I do wonder at you knowing about them.” Albus offered a little hesitantly.
“I have created a field within this room against detection, sir, so please use the Cruciatus, so everyone can see this charm as it is meant to be used.” Turning to the rest of the students, whose eyes were wide at his instructions, “Students will be practicing against the Afflictio curse, which is a mildest legal hex form of the Cruciatus, as you know, but not dangerous or deadly.  It will give you a real-world feel for casting your charm and preventing the devastation and a feel for the effects of the charm.  The headmaster will supervise in case anything goes wrong.”  There were audible sighs among the crowd of teenagers.
Harry smiled at her and addressed Ron, “We need to let old childish things go.  I may have grown up more than you two because of my vision, but I can at least point you in the right direction.  He wasn’t that bad as an adult, and if we befriend him now, I think it can turn out much better.”
“You and me...I can’t face anyone without you. Do not worry over me. I won’t go anywhere.” Draco said, his own certainty filtering into his voice.
“I’m not sure which would be true, Draco.” ‘This could be construed as a safe place’, Harry thought “and I already know the path which I chose for love was the wrong one.”
He placed a hand on the Potion Master’s shoulder.  “You have friends, and well, a surrogate son who looks up to you…”  Harry hoped he did not tread too far into foreign territory.
Dumbledore looked pensive for a moment, “Yes that would be for the best.  Now off to bed with you, lots of school work tomorrow.”
Harry’s first years were doing very well with their exposition of Pixies.  They could identify all the parts of a Pixy by the day’s end.  The next lesson would cover various weaknesses of the creatures.
Harry stepped forward, placing the book on the desk in front of Professor Snape. He looked down into the eyes of his Professor, “You are brilliant, but your methods could be better, not nicer as that serves you well, but this book should shed light on what you are missing for your explanations.”
Draco looked around and let out a little shriek as he saw the dead carcass of the Basilisk still laying on the floor of the chamber.
Hermione smiled back, getting the joke, looked over to see Greg watching Draco.  “What are his strengths so I can work appropriately with him?” Hermione asked politely.
In the moonlight they were magnificent.  Long pale hair flowing in the soft breeze wrapped around the yin and yang of lovers entwined in an intimate embrace.
“You have to hold on to my arm as we floo… fidelius charm and all.” Ron grabbed his wrist and they both tumbled out the other side of the fireplace.
Harry looked at her and smiled, “I trained as an Auror, and etiquette was one of our required classes.” He grinned as he said it, “Your actions towards me in the end of the war was the only redeeming actions that saved you and your son, but not your husband. I think a meeting with Headmaster Dumbledore is in order to find out the best solutions for how to help your family. We don’t have much time before actions are needed. But I do have a question that I hope you can answer. Who has access to your sister’s vaults while she is in Azkaban?”
Severus turned those words over in his head.  So the boy knew, of Lily, of his past, of his future.  He regretted the boy witnessing his death that could not have been easy for anyone.  Especially with the horrific detail that he had been shown from the memory.  He too knew what it was to look for that paternal affection.  He had first sought that in the Dark Lord, only to be betrayed, and then found what he could in Albus Dumbledore.  That man had saved him in more ways than one.  It was not an affectionate relationship, but it was not toxic.  To see himself through the eyes of Harry thought, that was difficult.  He had measured himself so little because of his past and misdeeds.  But even knowing everything, the boy had come to regard him with a healthy affection.  This he might be able to bear as long as public displays were not involved.  As far as finding his own happiness, that remained to be seen.  Lily had been his only love, he was not sure anyone would be willing to share his blackened heart.
Draco felt the hot breath on his skin and moaned. Each breath did not stop at his flesh, it seemed to permeate and travel through it and pool low into his groin.  Harry parted those delicious globes and went for the prize.  He sent out a tentative lick and was lost in the absolute musk of Draco.  Draco’s skin was silky smooth, but his tongue found an even smoother tight ring.  He licked in slow circles, relishing the sexy noises flowing from his lover’s lips.
“I had planned on a quick, peck and be done with it,” Draco stated, wanting to back away.  His stomach was in knots, his brain was mush, and his body sang.
He did not stay to answer any questions, nor face any insults. He was beyond childish behavior. He walked into the Great Hall, the headmaster watching him intently as Severus was moving to his own seat. Harry sat down next to Ron and Hermione. Hermione gestured over towards Ginny who was talking intently with Dean. Harry just looked at her and shrugged. “You're telling me that it doesn’t bother you?” Hermione added, stress in her voice. Harry had almost forgot her and Ron had not gotten together yet and she was looking for some sympathy.
Ron was pensive for a moment, “Can you find a way to either obliviate the whole street or obscure the house and activities from them?”
“I had already decided to include you on the next meeting Harry. I just needed time to get used to the idea.” The Headmaster relented with a small smile, as he turned back to his desk, and Harry nodded as he walked out the door.
“Sorry, I was just remembering some things.” Harry confessed. “Have you ever heard of a wizard Augur?”
Harry leaned in close, slowly, not wanting Draco to move.  It was like trying to capture a butterfly.  Their eyes closed as their lips met for a moment, just a small touch, gentle and innocent.  It was clarity put to flesh.  Harry moved back slowly intently staring into Draco’s eyes. Their lips smoldered where they had touched
“I don’t want to, Harry.” Draco cried out softly.  His body on fire, waves of pleasure coursing through his veins.
Harry made his way to the headmaster’s office after lunch… He was hoping for news on his class speakers.
“I wasn’t trying to keep it from you, I guess it just progressed quicker than I thought,” Harry said exasperated.
The sun was still rising, a few clouds were in the sky, partially blocking the brightness. At the current angle, the radiance of the sun was behind the trees and the breaking rays highlighted the luster of Draco’s hair. His blush had not faded much, coloring his cheeks and neck. Harry mused, if he had paid more attention during his early years, he would have noted Draco’s looks. Though diminished in light of his character, he was still very attractive.
Ron turned red, his face screwing up in anger, but Harry put a hand on his shoulder. “We don’t have to put up with bad things Ron, just try to move past our own behavior towards him, and his to us.  Leave it in the past.”
“For homework…” Harry looked up and smiled with a big grin. Severus rolled his eyes at the boy, “I want you to go through the memory bricks of this session, identify what was happy about those.  Small things, big things, events, or actions.  I need a list, I will guarantee my secrecy if you need, and then we can move forward with providing you the balance you need.”
He heard a whispered, “Shhh… I’m sleeping.” come from the bed and smiled.  Severus went to the door of his office…
Draco was already kneeling when he landed, it was on a soft plush carpet and he nearly lost it as he looked up. He almost came in his pants when he met the emerald gaze above him.  He heard a whispered “Fuck” and did his best not to smile.
“Harry my boy, just discovered a marvelous muggle candy you have to try… it’s a coffee nip...it’s delightful.” He said extending one towards Harry.
“I don’t want to be jealous…” Draco started, but a feeling of overwhelming possessiveness swept over him.
Harry slammed into the tight throat, letting it close around him when Draco gagged. Such dark need flowed through him, the power, the sinfulness of the act… it made him harder and he thrust harder, then he shallowed his thrusts to let Draco have a moment. He looked down Draco’s body and was captivated by the sight of precum dripping down the ivory cock in front of him.  He pulled out afraid he would burst from the feel and sight before him.
Harry felt when Draco walked in the door, everything in him was tuned to Draco.  He lifted his eyes to capture the beautiful grey ones that searched for his own.  Harry never noticed the upturn of Ron’s lips at his actions.  Ron and Hermione were getting up to leave, greeted Draco pleasantly as they left.  They had treated him like a true friend.  Harry was so proud of his friends, their acceptance of Draco had not been easy, but they did it for him.
“What did you say to that mongrel you call godfather?” He asked, his tone clipped and accusing. His eyes boring into Harry.
“Ron’s mum called Dumbledore, we need to go.” She said hurriedly before turning away and walking quickly towards the library entrance.
Ron seemed to relax a bit, “I guess that makes sense, we are better than that.  I won’t guarantee anything though... other than I’ll try.”  Ron was not happy, but he would be better, see past the urge to put all Slytherins in the same bucket.  At least he would try.
“Ron, truer friends cannot be found anywhere.  You and Hermione have always defined me.  You both always will.  I need Hermione’s mind, quick wit and knowledge.  Your friendship, companionship and strategy… With you I don’t have to be an adult all the time.” Harry gave his friend a lopsided grin… Which the redhead promptly returned and tried punching Harry in the arm…
On instinct, Severus bristled. “I’m sorry Professor, I am still getting used to my role as a student again. Forgive my brashness. Until I know the extent of my vision’s consequences and my own actions, I don’t want to endanger others with more knowledge than they need in the moment.”
Draco looked over, and shook his head.  He wasn’t ready to share anything yet.  Harry and Draco had an amazing time, and it wasn’t all passion and fireworks.  It was soft, caring and comfortable.  Maybe that is what Harry meant by friends first.  He could handle that, as long as there were some of those amazing kisses too.  He would have to tell his friends sometime, but not today.  Today was theirs.
“You tell him soon or I will, I don’t like secrets, Harry, and neither does he.” She emphasized her words by folding her arms across her chest and giving him THAT stare.  The stare that says ‘you better or consequences will follow’, the one that always had her kids shutting up after they had been fighting… Harry smiled at the memory... Vision, it was just a vision.
“You each will share a copy of this text, it is to be left in this room.  Turn to page 365, where we will brew the draught of living death according the new instructions printed in the margins of this page.  I expect everyone to follow the book’s notes exactly in order to achieve high marks on this potion.  You have the remainder of the class to complete this potion to the first step where it needs to simmer.  If you have questions, raise your hand and I will approach you to answer them to keep from disrupting the class.  Is that clear for everyone?” Snape asked.
Draco breathed in the spicy scent of Harry, his head swimming in pleasure.  His hands wrapped around the silken shaft and he marveled how soft the skin was under his touch.  Each stroke mesmerized him until he could no longer resist the lure to taste.
Harry drew back, breathing heavily.  How could one kiss devastate his body so much?  He saw Hermione smiling out of the corner of his eye, and knew she had a hand in this.  It didn’t matter.  He took Draco’s hand, walked him out of the hall, and then started towards the door to a nearby empty classroom.
Harry walked out to the common room, only to be ambushed by Hermione with a hug, and Ron looking groused.
“I need to show you something, and in a way you won’t like Aunt Petunia.  It is imperative you think long and hard after what I show you… You could be in danger, but whatever you choose, I will ensure your safety.” Harry said.
Dumbledore looked down then, “You know more than you’re willing to say, that I gather. But talk to someone if it gets too much, Harry.  You deserve that at least. Vision or not, don’t get pulled into a past that is about to be re-written and stuck on a tragedy that may not occur again.”
“I did not give leave for talking, 10 points from Slytherin and Gryffindor for interrupting class.” He admonished, while looking directly at Zabini and Parkinson and Seamus and Dean.  The two slytherins looked shocked, and the two Gryffindor’s disgruntled.  Harry on the other hand just grinned at a surprised Draco.
‘She will have to be watched and definitely not trusted, but at least offensively she is weak.’ Harry thought.
Harry only smiled back, at least she was trying. “Thank you, I’ll wait for him in the Great Hall then. Care to walk with me?”
After arriving first to his dorm and changing, Harry walked out of Gryffindor tower.  He had a meeting with Professor Snape and he would not be late.  Lateness was a sign of disrespect for the Professor, and Harry was determined to show the man the utmost respect he deserved.
“Delores?” She was almost afraid to bring up the subject.  She had been with the woman many times since her arrival and the change was otherworldly.  She hardly knew the woman. Delores was kind, sweet and nurturing, a far cry from what she had been.
“I will. I will visit today, lets get Dobby and do the charm. Then I will go see Severus, I will need him with me for this.” Harry moved to let Draco’s head slide so the blond was laying on the couch.
The man was sensual, passionate and moving, all things he would never have associated with Harry in the past.  The way his eyes blazed was sexy beyond imagining.  He was almost jealous of whomever married Harry in the vision… almost.
Harry turned around in the hall just before he got to the staircase leading to Gryffindor tower. Ron was following him. “Ron, Sorry. I didn’t mean to ignore you. I’ll need to talk to you and Hermione when we get back to the common room. It’s important.” Harry spoke softly. Ron nodded, “Of course. You alright mate?”
Severus watched as color drained from Harry’s face.  Melancholy flowing over the young man like a second skin, eyes like Lily’s, but the brightness had left.  He saw now, this young man was definitely not his father, so much more like the vulnerable Lily.  Harry must be lost inside a memory of the vision, He could guess which memory.  His own pride and ignorance caused this as he tried to intimidate Harry.
Draco had not really moved.  He stayed in his quiet place in the forest.  It was peaceful, calm and far away from all the other students.  He really wasn’t upset.  He had seen the apprehension in Harry’s eyes.  The running away just made sense, they would talk soon.  The issue with the coin was the intriguing one.  Those coins are never wrong, charmed by Merlin himself and passed down in the Malfoy family for centuries.  As far as he knew, only two other pure blood families possessed such a token.  Each had been given, as a gift for good deeds by Merlin to several who had helped him in the defeat of Mordred and LaFey.
“I was afraid with everything that has happened and all your new powers, that you would not need me or Hermione anymore.  I am glad to help.  I want you to know that, even if you can do things alone, you do not have to.” Ron said, he clapped his hand on Harry’s shoulder.  It was odd looking at Harry now… His friend had become a man before he did.  He was still a child in the eyes of everyone, but Harry well… it was Harry after all..
He let down the impervious privacy charm, “For those of you in Gryffindor, who wish to learn appropriate Defense skills, we will be forming a ‘club’. I am not sure how the teachers will react, but it will be beneficial, for you in the future. Any who are interested can owl me, not speak here. I will notify all who wish to participate individually.”
“Don’t worry Ron, you have your moments, and when you do, they are brilliant.” Harry offered, he knew his friend’s jealousy got the better of him at times.  But he knew Ron, and Ron was just as much top notch as Himself or Hermione.  He was in the best company, no matter when in time they were.
Pansy, Blaise, and Greg stood behind Draco, each with their wands drawn.  Millicent and Nott looked at the scene and stood.  They looked between Vince and Draco.
Draco’s hand brushed his softly, though Harry couldn’t tell if it was intentional or not.  Harry’s finger felt like each nerve ending was sparking with electricity.  His eyes flew to Draco’s, he needed to know if the sensation was just him or did Draco feel it too.  The softening of Draco’s eyes and the upturn of his smile, spoke volumes to Harry.
Amelia gasped. She read about Augurs, heard legends, but never believed.  She was the type of woman who embodied ‘seeing is believing’.  She rarely formed an opinion without fact or support.  From what she remembered, the touch of an Augur was life-changing, and in some cases life-ending.
Harry stood and crossed over to her, and her eyes widened in fear but she did not move.  He searched for just the right power...Who knew it would be love… deep down he did love her…
He had been so long without real family, affection in a parental manner was something he was wholly uncertain of.  His mind healer after the war, had helped him to overcome those needs and obstacles, and taught him how to find other provisions. And in a way that is why his marriage didn’t work, he had married Ginny for her family.  So afraid he would lose them if he didn’t join them.  He still feared that, knowing now that Ginny would not be pursued.
Harry was ecstatic.  He talked more about the upcoming Holidays, and what he had planned for the Malfoys and Snape.  He wanted the house cleaned nicely and offered to ask Dobby to help.  Sirius accepted that.
Harry was lost in the feel of Draco's skin, the taste, and the scent.  Draco's cries sent heat streaking through his veins urging him to worship the man in his arms.
Harry took that all in. He knew from the date she gave, what wrong needed to be righted. He was still working on the plan for that. But new responsibility was another issue.
Harry turned toward the dark owl and took the scroll from its leg.  It was not from his normal friends, so he was naturally curious. He rarely got any letters from those not within his circle or from the Ministry with new Potion orders.  He broke the seal and unrolled the parchment.
“Dobby is an elf, everyone in the Dark Lord’s company would never think such a position would be given to one such as he. Dobby would consider it the greatest honor… and I owe him…” Harry’s eyes started to water for a moment before he breathed in and called them back.
For his part, Professor Snape seemed genuinely interested. “You get the bottom ingredients here, I will go to my personal stores for these top ones.” Severus said as he walked out of the supply closet. He was at ease, the usual animosity between them had vanished. Though Harry looked young, his demeanor was that of a colleague, so working with him was easier than just a student.
With the days flowing against one another like a predictable tide, Harry had settled into a routine. He and Draco worked together on training during the weekend, even using the Potions lab at their house for some of the practical potions. Draco was a quick learner, and without all the homework, he was progressing rapidly on learning spells, counters, and potions. Harry had planned on giving him a mock OWLs test near the end of February so they would know where he needed to work on things.  Draco stood by while Harry practiced harnessing the powers he had already learned.  Harry practiced with the fire of the earth several times, leaning on his bond with Draco to balance and protect him.  He was soon able to call the fire and control it by the beginning of February.
Harry stared down at Draco.  Those eyes were sexy, those lips perfect, and his body was tightening in anticipation.  He was completely overwhelmed in the moment.  Draco slid his hands up Harry’s thighs, and slowly opened the dark trousers.
“I probably should have let you know sooner, but last month something happened.  Hermione did some research as she always does, I had a vision last month and she thinks it is because I am to be the next Augur.” Harry explained hurriedly.
“I know what this costs, to see Draco accepted into our friendship.” Harry said softly. “I have not broached the subject of the diary with him, and I only intend to when needed.  Some trauma is not easily forgotten.”  He put his hand on her shoulder, trying to give some comfort.
“If you ever paid attention you would see he is one of the best strategists in the last 50 years or so...or he will be… but his strategy is the best I know.” Harry said.
“Lily was the world to me...You are the very life in my blood.. I do not compare you… She could never measure up.” Severus breathed across his addiction.. and bit down hard. He felt the release before his ears were blessed with the heated cries. He moved then, losing himself in the tight heat of his mutt and giving over to his own bliss when Sirius’ cries turned to mewls. Their stomachs were coated a second time just as Severus whispered in Sirius’ ear and released in his personal haven.
“I can’t believe what that bug wrote about you...The Prophet is going too far attacking your credibility Harry!” Hermione was red-faced as she ranted about the latest article in the paper. Harry was being targeted on a smear campaign. He was sure the Minister had a hand in it, but he just smiled back at her. Dejavu was one thing… it was another to learn one’s lesson and get in between Hermione and her rant...He would at least keep his dignity this time around and not be blindsided.
Harry had written down the complexities of the charm and was looking into potion ingredients that could mimic the charm. Once he had those, he could work on prolonging the effects.  A quick tapping on his window brought him out of the focus his research had put him in.  A sleek black owl stood at the window waiting to be let in.  Harry got up and walked to the window.  He opened it and the bird flew to a perch he had in the Library. Harry had long ago dropped the Fidelis charm on the house, and only put up simple wards.  He felt there was no longer a need for intense defenses.
“I was almost one of them,” Harry stated, “I’m sure I can figure out how to deal with them, after being the youngest Head Auror for 10 years, I am sure I can handle it.”
Harry took that information in, smiled, and looked back up at the headmaster. “This may sound strange, but it is good to see you. It has been an eternity for me, but for you I am beginning to believe it may have not been so long. Alas, that means Cedric will still be someone I can’t save. I assure you headmaster, I have not been meddling with time, but I think time has meddled with me.” Albus looked at the boy, more questions were forming as he was about to ask, Harry held up his hand. That was not an action the Headmaster had ever seen Harry use, Harry was unsure, angry and in need of guidance most of the time this year. This Harry was calm, self-assured and in control.
Harry had been deeply affected by the events in his vision, though he did not share everything.  Draco had seen the effect of one death, and from hints, he had gathered there had been many more.  Harry seemed to carry such a large burden on his shoulders.  How would it be like to live only to know you were meant to fight one person?  What would it be like growing up knowing you were only a means to an end?  Harry must have been so grateful to have friends, but scared for them as well.  Draco had seen how Harry had matured since his vision, it was a maturity only time could wrought.  Draco barely recognized the boy he had known these many years, the new air of authority and humility is one thing that he found to his liking.  Though Draco liked to have his own way, he preferred to follow rather than lead, in a way it was a comfort.  Harry’s natural leadership was a balm to his restless spirit.
For Harry the three weeks had been unnerving, classes were easy to get through.  It was the waiting, and the wanting that ate at Harry the most.  He had no time to devote elsewhere since his free time was taken up by his plan to save Sirius.  It was easy enough to get the empty classroom and set it up a replica of the veil portal.  The hard part was the daily monitoring of the progress of the spiders.  Their web had to be intricate, had to be tight.  Harry was working with several charms and spells to replicate what his mind was conjuring, but every time he thought he had the right ones, nothing worked right together.  His only consolation had been that Draco had been there.  Silently supporting him, diligently taking care of him.
Ron looked at Harry then towards the Headmaster. “Sir, this is not like last time. Usually his scar hurts and he almost faints, but he regains consciousness quickly. We were told to look to the beyond in class, and like always Harry goes first. He laid his hand on the ball and went rigid for about a minute or two. His eyes turned black, entirely… and then he was back, and disoriented from the looks of it. And then he bolted.”
Harry’s eyes slid shut as his hands guided Draco’s face, dragging him closer, and allowing him to possess that mouth once again.  He drank in Draco, plundering, and branding.  His senses were going wild with each inhale that impaled Draco’s scent into his lungs and imprinted it into his mind.  Draco’s mouth was a drug, enticing, hot, addicting.  Draco had to keep himself from falling this time, winding his arms around Harry’s neck, and holding on for dear life as he felt his whole being going up in pleasure.  Again they broke apart unwillingly, needing more air.
Narcissa was the next to arrive, quickly followed by her husband Lucius.  He quickly rallied the Malfoys over to his side, creating a small division in the room.
Draco thought for a moment, “He takes neat notes, and does exactly as you instruct him, just give him one task at a time otherwise he will get confused.  And Harry?”
Draco noted the change in Harry. He had relaxed for a moment, then went almost limp in his embrace. Harry was somewhere else. This was not the same as when his Father used the coin. This was a journey… He was sure it was a guided journey for Harry, the blackness consumed those eyes. He looked in, wanting to see. He was surprised, he could see everything but heard nothing. He saw an older Ginny and Ron. A letter he could not make out the words to… and then he saw a reflection of himself. Only it was not him, the man had a beard, but the features were so similar it was eery. He watched until he saw the green fill up Harry’s eyes like a glass of water.
Mrs. Malfoy stood then, and walked over to Harry.  He stood still waiting for her response.  He did not move when she reached for something inside her cloak.  She pulled out a box, and Harry felt it. Lucius flinched, and Dumbledore’s eyes narrowed.  The evil aura that bled from the box was unmistakable.
Draco was rising higher on the wings of pleasure.  His body was throbbing and singing with exquisite need. His own hands were not lazy, they were mapping each plane of Harry's chest. He would remember each line and angle.  Savor the sexy texture. Draco caressed Harry's face lowering his own lips to sip from Harry. The kiss was slow, languid and calming. He wanted their bodies to breathe. Climbing off Harry,  he knelt down and locked gazes with this incredible man.
“First to arrive, I see.  Did you plan that, or was I just the only one to grab the parchment on time.” He asked, his voice soft, his words playful.
Albus noded to Severus, who took Ron and Madam Pomfrey and ushered them out of the area. Harry felt his pants for his wand, and cast an impervious privacy charm. Albus was intrigued as only Aurors are taught this charm for interrogation purposes, not something Hogwarts or it’s texts taught.
They flew to the top and Harry again closed the entrance.  They walked silently out of the first floor, and then Harry took them higher.  He had planned this day, and it would be perfect if he could help. Harry stopped short. Draco, who was still musing in his head, ran right into the back of him.
They had touched often enough over the past three weeks.  Not like their date, where they could do anything, and just enjoy each other with no distractions.  It had been more of a brush of hands here, a shoulder bump while walking, it was always a thrill, this close though was more than a thrill, it was a bombardment of his senses.
Harry relaxed. The relaxation was only for a moment… His memories tugged at him… Well parts of his vision, replayed over in his mind.
They waited in silence.  Petunia darted glances at Harry and Severus over the course of the next 20 minutes or so.  She knew who Severus was, and was not all too keen on him.  Harry though, there was something about him, intimidating even yet still magnetizing.  He was no longer her sister’s boy, or even a boy.  She was not going to put up with nonsense in her home, but if anything he had shown her was to be believed...She put it out of her mind.  It would come to naught... Or at least that is what she told herself.
On Monday during lunch, Harry received an owl from his Aunt.  He smiled at that, she was settled in her house.  She expressed thanks, and offered an invitation to tea… she wanted to finally get to know her nephew.  Harry’s chest warmed at the idea.  Harry jotted off a few things...Investments he thought she could make, to include the twins…If she wanted to be comfortable, some would pay off sooner and others later.  He tied it on the owl and let it have a piece of his chicken before it took off once again.
“Amelia Bones, You have witnessed the power of The Augur Saeculum, the Seer of the Age. The guiding hand of justice in a world of darkness. Duty to Balance, duty to life, duty to peace, and duty to the earth.” Harry’s voice was melodic and beautiful... She felt her body lean in wanting more…
In that small moment of shared joy, Draco felt closer to Harry than he had thought he could be.  His own world became centered, clearer, and focused.  The world for him was simple, Harry, just Harry.  Living to be with him, to help him, to be Harry’s strength, to be his quiet friend, and his passionate lover…
“At least 5 meetings, or detentions, however you wish to arrange them should be enough.” Harry said as he smiled, “Let me know. I don’t want to be late for lunch, heard Dobby cooked dessert today… treacle tart.” His voice caught on the name, and he cleared his throat quickly before looking away.
“Your pup has arrived to bother us… Take your time… I’ll keep him busy until you are ready. Unless you want to sleep.” Severus whispered on the return grunt he received. He moved to his wardrobe and dressed quickly, used his wand to straighten everything to perfection.
Thursday afternoon, Harry did not show up for lunch. Instead he stood outside the Room of Requirements, thinking of finding things that were lost.
Harry had watched uncertainty and guilt pass over Draco’s features.  A darkness crept into those beautiful eyes, and he had looked away.  Harry could not bear to see it.  Harry wanted Draco to see, really see that they were past everything.  The skin was warm under his finger, the dejected look he saw when they locked eyes hurt, made him angry that Draco did not see his own worth.  Harry wanted, needed, longed for Draco, in a way he never had for anyone before.  All he could do was stare, and fall into the ice he wanted to melt so badly.
The memory of Voldemort sending Nagini to strike him played out, Harry tried to cut it off before he and his friends entered, but Severus put a hand on his arm. He watched as Harry knelt next to him, covering his wounds. He saw his own tears form as he saw Lily in Harry’s eyes, and he saw Harry collect the tears. He saw the life leave his own eyes, and Harry’s tears fall, for him.
“You were, and still are, the Half-blood prince, Professor.” Harry fully turned to face him, pinning him with Lily’s eyes. “You are a great Potions Master, yet if you taught us, how you taught yourself in these notes, we could grow to be just as passionate as you on the subject. This book is brilliant, and should be re-published with your notes and revisions. It is because of this book, I came to like potions better.”
“Go to sleep...I love you...and no more whiskey.” Severus said as he pulled his lover closer and let them fall into a steady breathing pattern and soon sleep took them both.
In that moment, there were no visions, no inclinations of the future, no ‘sight’.  There was only fire.  The fire was all consuming, reminiscent of the Fiendfyre.  Inside him it still burned, he was changed, touched, marked, and branded.  Though there were no outside marks, he still felt the branding down in his soul.  He would understand this, know this.  He would face Draco again, he could not let his fear of the unknown conquer him.
Harry was up early, showered and dressed impeccably, though his hair as ever did not seem to cooperate.  Hermione and Ron were going on a date today, so why not him… It would be his first date… sort of… and that made Harry smile.  Though he held memories of a vision, he was starting to feel that this time and place were his own, where he was meant to be.  So all these new things with Draco, were really new.  Not even anything in his memories could compare.  Harry made it down to the Slytherin dorms and found Pansy leaving.  She looked wary to see him, but gave him a weak smile and a nod.  So she had chosen her side after all.
Harry left the lab late that evening, and went to Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom… She wasn’t there at the moment, which Harry was thankful for. He opened the chamber and slipped down, cushioning his fall. He entered the chamber warily, it had not been that long chronologically since he had been there, but still it felt like an eternity. He moved towards the carcass and pulled a fang, he bottled some of the venom and put it in his pocket. He moved toward the mouth of the large Slytherin head and put the box in the large empty chamber inside.
“What if I don’t want perfect?” Draco gasped out desperately.  Harry moaned as Draco moved against him, showing what he really wanted.
“I don’t like manipulations, so while we come up with some plans, I would like their input.  I will send a note off, Can we all meet next weekend to discuss?” Harry asked hesitantly, “I’ll inform everyone once I receive confirmation.”  The headmaster nodded.
It had been almost two months since Harry had spoken to Mrs. Malfoy, but he had finally received confirmation for a meeting between them, Harry and the Headmaster.  Harry and Draco had grown as friends over the last two months, they ate together a lot, talked of Quidditch, classes and many other topics.  Harry found they had more things in common than he had imagined at first.
A/N~ So we have gotten to the part of the story that is like the outer bands of the hurricane.  Once this passes there will be an eye of calm… Just to prepare you.  Enjoy…
Friday was quite, Ron was anxious as his father would be there that night. Harry pulled a package from his trunk just before dinner and would not reveal what was in it to Ron. Only that in a few weeks his father would probably tell him.
“I had a vision, not an ordinary vision. Most visions are of a single event or something obscure from what I was told.” Harry explained, looking back at Draco, his eyes were and intense green, “I had a ‘vision of living’.  I lived for over 20 years inside that vision that to you all lasted only a few minutes.”
Lucius quirked an eyebrow, but Narcissa placed a hand on his arm, and she and Draco settled into chairs in front of the Patriarch.
Severus nodded, and cleared his mind, casting the necessary shield charms, and weaving them into the Occluding fabric of his mind.  He met Harry there in that dark space, the foundation of the wall already in place.
“He created seven, you do not need Professor Slughorn’s memory any longer.” Harry said, there was a deflated sigh at the end of it. “So I am to re-live the events of the last 21 years all over again.”
“She was given a choice… there was much darkness in her.” Harry stated, “Yes, she experienced the Augur’s touch.”
Harry took the treat and pocketed it, “For later, Sir.”  Dumbledore nodded, then motioned for Harry to take a seat.
“Yes, now I don’t know.  They were such a beautiful part of myself, I know that path is closed to me, that is one part that leaves me to wonder if my choice to accept being the Augur is what I should choose.  If I reject the power, I will forget and all will revert and play out as it was in my vision.  I miss my kids, they were beautiful, and wonderful.  Watching them grow was the best part, the chaos of the noise, the fighting, the laughing, the tears and the pains… it was all worth it just being with them.  If I choose to accept, and live a different life, I may not have them.  It’s a tough decision.” Harry sighed under the weight of it all.  The constriction in his heart was painful.  His children were a world unto themselves, they were his world.
Draco spit into his hand and reached for Harry’s cock, stroking it and lubricating it.   He hovered for just a moment, before slowly lowering himself on that rock hardness.  Both men hissed in rapture as they became locked together.  Harry leaned forward and planted soothing kisses along Draco’s chest.  His hands stroking Draco’s back lovingly.  Those tiny buds whispered for attention and Harry did not resist, taking one of Draco’s nipples into his mouth and flicking his tongue over it.  Draco’s head fell back, and he lifted himself up and crashed down, causing both mean to groan loudly.
Harry spit several times to coat not only himself but Draco’s hole.  He pushed in two fingers to coat Draco’s inner wall and then pulled stretching the hole slowly and as wide as his fingers could stretch. Without preamble or thought, he plunged in, needing to be inside Draco so much his knees were becoming weak. The connection was like life itself was flowing into him.  He reached down and held the base of Draco’s severely reddened cock and he began to pound hard.  His own body was reaching for something so damned amazing that he wanted Draco to go with him.
Harry smiled, “Good boy.”  He peeled off his trousers and briefs and kicked them to the side, He stroked his hard cock until it leaked onto his thumb.  He pressed Draco’s mouth open and let the man lick his thumb clean.  Harry tilted Draco’s lips so he could line his cock up with Draco’s throat.  He reached behind himself to hold onto Draco’s hair as he slid slowly into Draco’s mouth and throat. The first glide was slow and easy, he pulled out to see shining silver watching him. He squatted a little more to change the angle and slammed in hard, his balls covering Draco’s nose as the blond gagged and spluttered. Harry pulled out, then reached for his wand to at least protect Draco’s nose so he could breathe.  A quick charm and then he could slam with abandon and without fear.
“Albus Severus… Get me a glass of water, I think I hit my head, tell your mum I need a headache potion please, son.” Harry spoke with an authoritative tone none gathered in the infirmary had ever heard before.
“Her vaults can only be accessed by the trustee of her estate, and that would be me as next of kin while she is incarcerated.” She answered.
“She’s good at it Greg, just follow her instructions like you do me, and your potion will do fine.” Draco said soothingly.  Hermione patted Greg’s arm for reassurance, but Draco’s words seemed all that was needed.
“Mr. Potter…”Severus was about to scold, when those green eyes pinned him with a gaze unlike he had ever known.
They entered the small entryway and Harry then moved forward to the living room and drew the blinds.  He saw her relax a bit more once he had done that.
So the two boys strategized, and Harry bounced a few ideas off of him.  Ron was on board with the Malfoy plan, sort of… Harry was bound not to talk directly about it, so he worded things differently.  He also discussed taking out the strategic items, and how that may affect a final battle strategy, and how best not to alarm Voldemort, that there is more going on.
Harry looked around, noting the faces of those who were straining to hear the conversation, and the consternation on some faces.
“Not at all.  Even Vampires must know how to kill a vampire from time to time.” the vampire’s expression was all easy smiles.

Back in the Gryffindor common room Hermione was pacing. She was waiting for Harry so that she could tell him what her research had found.
“Well, until I hear from the Malfoy’s there really is nothing further to discuss.  Once we have that, you may need to convene an Order meeting so we can discuss the particulars once we are at liberty to do so.” Harry stated.
Severus set about the memory charms.  “We have to move him to Harry, unless you don’t mind him getting in the way when You-know-who arrives.”
“It’s either that, or I subject you to my viewing them and listing things.  I am sure there are some you would rather keep private.” Harry said, a growing grin on his face, “And I further promise, not to tease.”
However, there was an element of electricity that flowed in the air, one that felt like magic.  He had a feeling that if he moved the spell would be broken.  Standing there, taking all the pleasure for himself felt wrong, but Draco’s hands and mouth felt so right.  His body clenched as Draco slid lower, hands on the buttons of his trousers.  When his trousers hit the ground, Harry almost buckled under the sensation.  Cool air caressed his body, hot hands grasped and stroked his shaft in a slowness that was driving him mad.  But Draco’s mouth finally brought him to his hands and knees.
Harry pulled Draco closer to him and sat down on one of the armchairs.  Draco was straddling Harry’s lap and the friction was delicious.  Harry took possession of Draco’s mouth once again, reveling in the sweet decadence of the kiss.  This time, his hands did not stay on Draco’s face, they moved to shoulders, and buttons, working them out of their holes.  Harry needed to feel the soft skin beneath those robes, one small patch of neck was open to him and Harry took it, letting his teeth sink down as he tasted the skin.  Draco held on tighter and cried out from the pure ecstasy of the bite.
