Harry's silence was once again astounding to him. From  being so fiery just minutes beforehand to quiet contemplation, Draco was beginning to worry for the Boy Who Lived's sanity. Finally, he said, "I'm sorry for what happened to you. Nobody deserves to be turned like that."
Ginny shrugged. “Not like you’ve had much time to get to know us.” Draco frowned. “Listen, I’m sure Harry is in full mission mode: not enough time to reflect on anxious thoughts I bet. There are too many other pressing issues.”
Bill grimaced. "It's a little complicated," he explained, to which Draco rolled his eyes and sat back in his chair, ready for the worst. "The Wolfsbane has been working sort of like a quick fix. Draco is still feeling ill, though perhaps not as badly as he was his first moon. What's concerning is that he is already feeling so ill four days out, whereas a 'normal' wolf usually gets sick about two days prior to transforming. The werewolf genes he has been gifted are seeing the lesser vampire genetics as a threat to the body. The wolf is attacking his immune system because of it." Remus began to frown again, a crease was beginning to develop in his forehead. "The Wolfsbane pushes the wolf back a little, but your luck is going to run out before long. Even with the potion, Draco needs to continually take care of himself – one ill-timed cold could become dire."
Draco groaned as he opened his eyes. “Mum?” he asked, and was quickly pulled into his mother’s arms. He squeezed her back to the best of his abilities, but he felt knackered. “We have to stop meeting in St. Mungo’s,” he joked.
Turner nodded, eyes tight with concern. “I may have a theory. I’m not sure if you’ll like what I tell you, though.”
Harry took Draco’s hand in his instead of letting it reach his sore arm. “You did brilliant, Draco. It did close for quite awhile, but it reopened when we got here. I’m just really stupid for doing this in the first place. I’m glad you saved me.”
Lucius blanched at that. “I deserve that, I suppose,” he responded, looking a bit pained to admit it.
Remus seemed to catch on. “I know it’s a lot to deal with,” he replied. “Nobody else is here, though. All of the meetings are taking place at Grimmauld. We can grab a bite and then go see Blaise, if you still want to.”
As the meandered the story, Harry pressed on. “Speaking of, have you heard of the werewolf’s mark?” he asked. At Draco’s furious blush Harry knew the answer.
“What are you sorry for? You saved my life. I don’t have a lot of time—they said I could only see you for a few minutes. I just wanted to thank you.” He squeezed Draco’s hand gently.
“Ah,” Harry said, “No wonder Voldemort has been trying to wipe me out so early in life.” Draco flinched at the name while Remus just laughed dryly.
His uncle sighed at that. “I think it’s different for them. Jamie and I can interact with the living. We’re still in it in that regard. The others have simply moved on unless they’ve become ghosts. They can’t cross the Veil like we can.” At Harry’s blank expression, Regulus pushed further. “They are fine. Fred is fine. Tonks is fine. They’re at peace. They can relax now.”
Sirius sat next to him suddenly, engulfing him into a hug. “Oh no. Don’t cry, please don’t do that.” Harry heard Sirius sniff him (he assumed to verify his identity with his canine senses). “Merlin, it really is you, isn’t it?” Sirius released him from his hug and held Harry at arms length, scanning his tear-streaked face. “How did this happen, babe?”
"If you just take the Wolfsbane, life will be much better for you. It won't completely remove the symptoms but it will make it manageable. Everyone hurts and ails the first few transformations – we just need to be particularly careful with you."
Later that night, Draco was agonizing in his rooms, which he found were actually Remus’s while he was here. The two were having a quiet dinner. “So, you call Fenrir dad?” he asked, not being one for subtlety. Remus nearly choked on the soup they were eating.
Draco flinched slightly at the mention of the moon. He still was trying to get a handle on his instincts and wondered if the moon’s pull would be strong on Halloween night. The full would take place just a week before. But this was for Ron, so he supposed they had to do this properly. “I think we’ll want to keep it more traditional. Do you think the stone courtyard would be acceptable? We can set up tables and an altar and have a fire in the center.”
Draco placed his mug next to him, drawing his knees to his chest, wrapping his arms around them, resting his head atop his knees. He kept his eyes trained towards the fire rather than making eye contact with the elder Black. “I’m just so angry at him. Not so much as a goodbye was given. It’s so frustrating.”
Class. Snape seemed to shake himself out of the moment and into real time again. “Yes. Will you stop in for tea after dinner?” That surprised Draco and he looked up from an unsettled Harry in shock. “Although he certainly has an attitude problem, Potter is right to be angry with me. I want to catch up.”
Harry cut him off with a kiss, quelling any doubts in the blonde’s mind. Draco smiled into the kiss, still not used to being able to do that with Harry of all people. “I like it.”
Sirius only nodded, expecting that answer. “Healer Turner should be here soon and he’ll have pain potions for your arm and leg and some nutritional supplies. Then we’ll pick a specialist to see if there’s anything else we need to worry about, yeah?”
Draco avoided Harry’s eyes, instead focusing on a wide variety of bezoars in front of him. “I’m fine.”
Harry glanced at Draco quickly and back down at his plate. Draco frowned in confusion. Wasn't the Golden Boy supposed to be brazen at all times? Why was he coming off so small and sad? "Just the usual nonsense," Harry replied. The black haired wonder let out a heavy sigh. "I just can't control myself much anymore. I'm losing my mind stuck in here."
Harry took Draco’s arm with a small smile, looking more like Sirius when he brightened up like that. “Let’s go.”
Remus pulled out a fake galleon from his pocket. “Forgot I had this until today—so stupid. Hermione has the other and we can send short messages.”
Harry shrugged. “Two nights in a row of nightmares will get you out of bed and ready to go, I guess,” he replied, stepping into his parents’ quarters. The large sitting room had been decked out cozily with no shortage of seating and oversized pillows. Remus always made spaces into a den and Harry loved it. Draco did similar decorating, making the Black Heir wonder if it was a werewolf thing. There was a doorway that led to a small, mostly unused kitchen, and another that led to a set of rooms. Harry tried not to think about the sleeping arrangements, knowing full well that the living Marauders’ “open love” policy was back in full swing. He was happy for his parents, if not slightly embarrassed at the thought that they, too, were full human beings with their own set of romantic needs.
Draco sighed, feeling the weight of guilt settle in him. He really did have a way of running his guardians through the ringer with worry. “I understand, but I am fine, just a bit tired is all.”
Ron frowned. “No. Harry’s always been a bit fascinated with you, even before this whole angsty turn of events.”
The two made off to St. Mungo’s shortly after breakfast—it seemed Molly was grieving in the form of food: no way Sirius and James whipped up a full English breakfast by themselves, Draco mused.
Draco wasn’t expecting to hear that. “I heard you threw Harry your wand in the end—that should keep you out of Azkaban, don’t you think?”
The next morning, Harry was knocking on Draco’s door much too loudly and much too early for a Thursday in which they had the day off. He would never understand why school simply had to begin on September 1st despite the day of the week. Long weekends were always good, though, he supposed. He rubbed his eyes tiredly, sitting up in bed. Maybe he didn’t mean to knock? he told himself, despite smelling the anxiety rolling off of his partner.
“Wouldn’t be surprised if your lifespan dramatically increased too if your canines are anything to go by.”
Remus walked through to the living room with two steaming mugs. As Draco settled himself on an armchair, Remus handed him one. “He himself didn’t make you transform but your reaction to his magic did. Samhain magic gets at your baser instincts—it calls the wolf out. Knowing how you feel about Harry, the power his magic holds really brought it out of you. It was bound to happen; I should have realized.”
Ron rolled his eyes behind his mother’s back. “Good to see you out of the hospital robes, mate,” he said. “Harry will be thrilled,” he winked at that. Draco flushed in embarrassment.
Harry would smile encouragingly at him from across the room as Draco shuffled along with a Healer spotting him, sometimes saying innocuous things like “You got this” to push him along. Harry would attend any session he was allowed in, even if Draco felt extremely embarrassed while exerting way too much energy trying to cast a simple
Harry just grimaced, looking more like James with that facial expression than anything else. “Is it sweets for breakfast?” he asked, trying to break the tension in the room.
“Emily and Dru want me as a third. Trust me, I’ve had this conversation with them and they never get the hint. I repeat, insufferable.”
Draco’s eyes began to well up with tears, not really hearing the elder wolf. He felt like he couldn’t breathe as he considered everything that had happened. “How are they going to let me be a Healer? I can’t be trusted.”
Ron shook his head. “Harry hides it well from her and I don’t want to have him thinking the world is against him more than he already does.”
Harry just laughed. Soon, the others had joined and it was really turning into a party. Everyone was impressed with the display: Draco had really outdone himself with his Samhain vision. A night that was usually so melancholy for Harry had transformed into a celebration of life—he wasn’t sure how he’d ever be able to thank Draco properly for this.
Harry was a bit downtrodden to be returning to Hogwarts. He received a letter from Dumbledore saying he was expecting him for tea when they got back. While he was excited at the prospect of getting some answers, a one on one meeting with the Headmaster seemed daunting to him: what would he even have to say?
“He is his wolf so no, but also these are his own feelings and emotions: he just recognizes the match. It’s probably how the two of you became so close so quickly when he arrived into the fold. He sensed it and you sensed it from him.”
Healer Abbott was not pleased with his progress, it seemed. His arm had healed but he was still suffering from magical exhaustion and malnutrition. “Have you been taking your potions?” she asked, frowning at his chart.
“I doubt your parents and tutors ever thought you would need to. We have a lot of informal disownments in my family. Most of it has to do with being unable to muster the emotional force to disown. We are vastly loyal.”
Sirius’s bright blue eyes welled up a little. “Get used to it, kid.” He released Harry’s hand and stood. “I’m going to make rounds to the other tables. I should really see to getting an 8th Year table: would be much more manageable.”
Draco allowed Remus to walk him into the kitchen and fuss over him. It’s been awhile since his mother henning was out on full display after all. As Remus busied himself with the kettle, he asked “How was it this time?” Draco made a noncommittal noise in response. “That bad, huh?”
Remus glared at Draco, who quieted instantly. “I swear if you took the Cloak again to sneak off to the club I will be beyond disappointed in the both of you.”
“I started noticing boys in Third Year,” the blonde continued, heat rising to his cheeks. “Harry probably being the first.”
The Malfoy Heir laughed at that. Purebloods were pretty much interrelated, weren’t they? Blood purity at the expense of sanity. “Still. Potter doesn’t come from here. I’m sure he isn’t interested.” Draco decided to tuck the memory of Harry trying to kiss him deep away. Obviously, it was a drunken moment of desperation and should not be counted as evidentiary of any affections.
Draco was shocked. “How idiotic can you be?” he huffed, storming off upstairs, no longer willing to be in the room with the Boy Who Lived. Maybe it was the full moon but he felt wild and touchy and couldn’t believe his ears.
“James got to him in time,” Remus continued on, ignoring Draco’s question. “Ran him up the steps and into the house—not sure how, really. He tried to end it in the Garden away from prying eyes. Sirius is at St. Mungo’s with him now—they’re going to admit him for a long term stay in a private wing while he gets sorted.”
Harry matched Draco’s frown, feeling his head. He immediately became alert. “You’re burning up,” he remarked. “Hold on, I’ll grab him for you.” Harry bounded out the door. Draco willed himself not to cry again, choosing to sigh instead. Was this it? Was he even going to make it to his second full moon? What a horrible way to go out, he thought, surrounded by people who don’t even care about you. He wished he could be near his father so he could kick and scream out his frustrations at someone who deserved it.
Madam Malkin interrupted their conversation at that moment, to Harry’s relief. “Mr. Zabini, you’re done. I’ll see you back here in a half hour for pick up.”
Harry just wanted to hurt Draco now that he knew he wasn’t going to get his way. “You never cared about me. You never wanted to help me. You just wanted an out from your shitty parents because you got tired of playing Death Eater.” Draco looked as if he were slapped and it set Harry over the edge. The glass shattered into a million pieces and Harry flinched, suddenly realizing what he had said. “Draco, I’m sorry.”
Draco glanced, quite frightened, at Severus. He began to think quickly. “Uncle Sev and I were going to the Leaky Cauldron for a job well done on my OWLs. Can we just meet you back home for dinner?” he asked his father, who responded by gripping his arm tightly. Severus looked mildly panicked, stuck between giving up his double agentry or planning to rescue Draco later. Unfortunately, for Draco, Severus chose the latter, obviously more loyal to Dumbledore than to his own godson. Figures.
Draco nodded. "I've been here only once before – when Aunt Walburga was dying. Not a lot of family was out of Azkaban to take care of her; Mum volunteered. I think I was five."
Sirius nodded in understanding. “You didn’t really have anyone to teach it to you. Sorry about that.” He pulled Harry into a one-armed hug. “I’m a bit anti-traditionalist as is your Dad, but we do enjoy some of the old rites. We’ll have to catch you up some if you’re interested.”
Draco shook his head, attempting to picture his father doing something that noble or sacrificial. “I just can’t believe he’d do something like that—give up his wand in the middle of a giant showdown like that?”
Harry waved him off. “It doesn’t matter.” He got suddenly serious as he said, “I’ve been having visions again. I know where the last horcruxes are.”
“Aren’t we tetchy?” Sirius quipped, sitting next to him at the table. Draco gave him a half smile. He liked Sirius: he was like a big kid most of the time but he was also a mothering soul. It was nice having him around. He nudged the blonde. “Alright, kid?”
Remus waved his hand in dismissal, not wanting to bother Draco with worry. “It’s about treatment and school if you’re still peaky after the hols,” he half-lied. “No worries.”
“I don’t have the connecting link with Him anymore—he can’t feed me incorrect information like last time.” He looked at Draco when he said, “they’re at Hogwarts. Every second I waste here is another opportunity for Him to unleash more horror on people.”
“It’s just—when done properly, I mean—it’s…freeing,” he finished lamely. This was a big step for Draco: in a few short months he had gone to sticking his nose up at anything different to actually enjoying the weird sides of himself. It was strange having to say goodbye to it so soon, especially since he thought he would be transforming forever.
Draco laughed. “I think that had more to do with being thirteen rather than the actual tattoos themselves, seeing as he was perfectly happy for me to take the Mark if things had gone differently.”
“Yes, I knew him,” he said shortly. “Or I thought I did. You’d better be off, Harry, it’s getting late.”
Harry looked up at her while trying to keep an eye on the quill. She was an authority figure after all. And Harry had always been told to respect his elders.
Ron placed his hand on hers, and looked to Madame Pince to make sure she wasn’t charging over with a heavy tome to brain them all for Mione’s outburst.
As the last remnants of the mark washed away, Draco finished his shower, and wrapped a towel around himself, wondering how he could possibly thank Harry for all that he had done.
He jerked his head toward a pillar, and Harry followed him behind it, leaving the others crowded around a distracted Mrs. Weasley.
Eventually both Crabbe and Ron feel asleep and Harry had to admit defeat as his own heavy eyelids fell shut.
“Unlike your one night transformation, that oaf will be gone for good. Everyone now will be afraid that he’ll eat us if we misbehave. Merlin knows he’s got room for all of us.”
As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake looked like chilled steel. The colder weather meant that Quidditch season had begun. Saturday would be the first game of the season: Gryffindor vs. Slytherin.
“Yes,” Harry said, gripping his wand very tightly, and moving into the middle of the deserted classroom. He tried to keep his mind on flying, but something else kept intruding…..Any second now, he might hear his mother again…but he shouldn’t think that, or he would hear her again, and he didn’t want to…..did he?
Remus was the one who had saved him from the Dursleys. Harry still held a lot of affection for his former Professor, but being rescued from the Dursleys felt more personal, made the man more Remus and less Professor Lupin in his mind.
Harry swam around in the tub for what felt like an eternity before he had to get back to the dormitory. Snape always had the head girl and boy do nightly checks to make sure that everyone was where they should be. It involved nothing more than a quick charm cast on the outside of the room that monitored body heat, but if anything was amiss, Snape was notified immediately. And Triwizard champion or not Snape would have Harry in detention for the rest of the year if he caught him out this late after hours.
“I’ll bet you’ll get that one,” Tracey said to Daphne pointing at a dark haired girl who had just been sorted into Slytherin.
“Having a good holiday, Dudley?” Remus asked kindly. Dudley hugged his bottom like he was suffering from a very heinous memory of a particularly bad bathroom experience and hid behind Aunt Petunia’s frail frame.
Draco had already called in backup. There was no way that Basks was going to get away again. He would pay for the people he landed in Azkaban, and he would pay for Harry.
“That woman’s going to pay!” he said. “Have you ever read such vile filth? Nothing and I mean nothing is wrong with Hagrid. Giant or not.” The announcement had been made at breakfast that a new professor would be taking over for Hagrid while he was on temporary leave.
Draco glanced up then, making eye contact with Harry for the first time since he had said that blasted word.
Harry was warmed by the conviction in Ely’s words. He could only wonder what the effect they had on Warrington was. But as Ely took Warrington’s hands they seemed to become aware of everyone else in the room, and Ely dismissed them with a cool look.
“Yeah, and the day before a match, maybe Gryffindor will finally crack under the pressure,” said Malfoy happily.
“Absolutely not,” Pansy replied, which oddly made Sirius smile. Harry walked Sirius to Buckbeak and told him to get on.
“That’s more like it,” he said. “He always said things like, “I adore you.” “You’re brighter than the lights from the Lake.” “One day it will be us.” “I’ll show you how.” “Study with me?” Cass never said, I love you, and yet he said it every day since fourth year.”
His Head Boy badge was missing and apparently so was Scabber’s rat tonic. Harry offered to head back downstairs and see if he could find it for Ron.
Harry looked around where Ely had moved in between the two of them, but Warrington was already standing behind Ely having packed his things. He whispered something in the other boy’s ear. At first, Ely looked like he wanted to protest, giving Harry a scathing look, but then nodded leaving the pair alone.
Harry noticed Neville receiving a package, but it wasn’t until they were leaving the Great Hall that he heard about what it was.
“Yeah,” Hermione smiled. “, but you know, I think you and I could have handled it even if Harry hadn’t have showed up.”
“Sweet Salazar,” another voice said, “Is that Potter?” And Harry recognized that voice as Pansy’s. The girls rushed in and immediately took the seat beside him and in front of him.
Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, “—how dare you---might have broken your neck.—“
“Arnold Weasley, who was charged with possession of a flying car two years ago, was yesterday involved in a tussle with several Muggle law-keepers over a number of highly aggressive dustbins. Mr. Weasley appears to have rushed to the aid of “Mad-Eye” Moody, the aged ex-Auror who retired from the Ministry when no longer able to tell the difference between a handshake and attempted murder. After Mr. Weasley arrived at the house, Mr. Weasley was forced to modify several memories before he could escape from the policeman, but refused to answer Daily Prophet questions about why he had involved the Ministry in such an undignified and potentially embarrassing scene.”
“Of Pansy? Of you? Sorry, to break it to you Potter, but Pansy can do a lot better than some pseudo champion that can’t dance.”
HOUSE ELF LIBERATION FOREVER!!!!! Don't lie to me or yourselves that Millicent and Hermione wouldn’t be the ones to watch. Hermione wants things done for the betterment of house elves and creatures everywhere, and Millicent wants a good laugh. Diabolical, really.
He pulled two bottles out of his briefcase, and fought to control his surprise at seeing the delicious drink once again.
“Yes!” said Fred excitedly, “please ask Snape if he will sign your form. You know, George, I think we can skip Hogsmeade today just to watch that encounter.”
“Er,” said Harry, ever so elegantly. Then he noticed that the quill was writing wildly away. (An ugly scar, souvenir of a tragic past.)
“You won’t?” said Voldemort quietly, and the Death Eaters were not laughing now, they were regarding him in a new way.
If you have any questions please put them in the comments or send them to me on Tumblr at inkdrinkershadowsinger
“I’m fine,” said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. “The unicorn’s dead, it’s in the clearing back there.”
“Good then. I had my doubts, but Cass seems to think more highly of your abilities than I do. He was always one to favor lost causes and abandoned pets.”
“Just showing some pride,” said Dean Thomas, their classmate and Seamus’s best friend. Seamus clasped Dean on the back and Dean smiled at him good naturedly.
Fleur Delacour was hurrying up the stone steps into the castle. Behind her, Hagrid helped Madame Maxime back two ginger haired horses into their harness as the Beauxbaton’s carriage prepared to leave.
“Harry!” she screamed, but her voice quickly faded. The fliers were hitting the ground. Oliver Wood was trying his best to get his team out of the sky. Angelina Johnson was zooming by Cedric Diggory and just barely managed to get him on her broom before his crashed to the ground. Fred and George had jumped for the nearest stand abandoning their brooms as they plummeted to the Earth. Harry tried to stand when he had space to move without being trampled, but his robe had caught on one of the bleacher’s nails. The canopy above their heads had come loose at one corner and Harry could tell that a few more gusts would knock it clear off.
Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He could tell he was about to get a dressing down, and was bracing himself when a small voice came up beside him.
“Oh, Weasley, hadn’t you better be hurrying along now,” said Malfoy, as he refused to address Harry directly since Harry had snubbed him in the booth. “You wouldn’t like her spotted, would you?”
Harry had dreamt of dead things all year, dead things, rotten things, beyond rotten things, bones that had aged so long from the life of their bodies that they were bare of all flesh and sinew and were yet malevolent. It was worse when he had to wake to the living nightmare that was the Dursleys, but things were better now.
The Gryffindors roared with laughter. Malfoy flushed with anger, but apparently the memory of Moody’s punishment was still sufficiently painful to stop him from retorting. Harry laughed quietly to himself. After what Malfoy did trying to get Hagrid fired last year, let him squirm.
Harry’s eyes rolled to the back of his head. He couldn’t see. He was drowning in cold. There was a rushing in his ears as though of water. He was being dragged downward. And then from far away, he heard screaming, terrible, terrible, pleading screams. He wanted to help whoever it was, he tried to move his arms, but couldn’t…. a thick white fog was swirling around him, inside him….
“Tell me, Potter, immediately, what secret Black Family Magic was worked on you, and how much will it cost so I can have the same?”
Several letters hung in a large group right in front of where Millicent usually sat, and seemed to be waiting for her. The birds had left, but the normal hustle and bustle and tearing of envelopes was missing as Millicent walked into the hall. Everyone seemed to be watching her. Flipping her hair to one shoulder, Millicent didn’t seem to take any notice of the people staring at her until she saw the stack of letters that seemed to be waiting for her.
Blaise ruffled Harry’s now shorter hair, and Harry hoped that it would be enough to get him out of another of Davis’ lectures about his appearance.
Even Stan’s pimples went white and it wasn’t because Ernie had jerked the steering wheel so hard that a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the bus.
“You’d better go and pack properly, Ron, because we won’t have time in the morning,” Mrs. Weasley called down the table. Ron scowled at Percy.
“Of course he knows. We asked him if he minds the Azkaban guards stationing themselves around the entrance to the school ground. He wasn’t happy about it, but he agreed. Dumbledore isn’t too fond of the Azkaban guards. Nor am I, if it comes to that, but when you’re dealing with a wizard like Black, you sometimes have to join forces with those you’d rather avoid.”
“Now,” he said, glancing around to each of them. “Which of you can tell me how we distinguish between werewolves and the true wolf? You, Mr. Nott?”
“He’s been waiting in the kitchen all summer to get their letters faster. Writes them back right then and there, but then saves it a day or two to send it back. So, he doesn’t seem desperate, I think. Mom thinks it’s a “special someone”.”
“An old man came too,” Harry said, his throat still constricted. “Bertha Jorkins. And…..” He looked at Sirius and Remus.
“Well, that’s….ingenious,” said Millicent despite herself. “But I’m proceeding with the plan Weasley. It’s only out of respect for Granger that I warned you about it, but go blabbing to those brothers of yours and next time I won’t be so merciful.”
“Remus,” gasped Pettigrew, and Harry could see beads of sweat breaking out over his pasty face, “you don’t believe him, do you….? He tried to kill me, Remus….”
When Hermione had successfully managed to levitate her feather, Ron had soured. He was in a very bad mood by the end of class.
“That’s it,” called Hagrid. “Make sure yeh can see. Now, firs’ thing yeh’ll want ter do is open yer books….I”
“So why did he just try and kill Harry?” cried Millicent, clearly unhappy with Hagrid’s nonchalant attitude.
hesitation, Cassius jumped in after him. But he wasn’t fast enough. Ely was already to the shore by the time Cassius was almost halfway. Harry watched as Ely walked up on the shore and headed toward the castle. The Slytherins around Harry gave each other a look. This was something that couldn’t be missed.
Harry moved forward into the cleared space Moody had created at the beginning of class. Moody raised his wand, pointed it at Harry, and said, “Imperio!”
Lupin was tapping Harry hard on the face. This time it was a minute before Harry understood why he was lying on a dusty classroom floor.
Draco tried to hand Rose back, but Hermione kept to looking at the scroll on his desk. Draco flicked it closed with a wave of his wand. “That’s top secret, plebian, you understand.”
“You’re mad, Potter!” said Millicent. “After what McGonagall said and Snape? You’ll be expelled, and while part of me would be glad to get rid of you, the other part knows that you’re brilliant.”
Despite the near entire uselessness of Pansy’s notes, there were a few things that Harry thought were interesting. Apparently, the kid was a bit of a loner, though sociable enough with the rest of his year mates. Pansy thought it was a sign of snobbishness that he wasn’t more outgoing, though Harry thought that it might have been something else.
Draco offered up Rose once more, full of the knowledge that he should be allowed to touch something so pure when he was so stained as he had said once before. Still, Hermione refused him.
Remus reached into the bag, and pulled out the famed Marauders Map. He passed it over to Sirius. Sirius handled the map like it was a newborn. He lovingly brushed his fingers over the ink on the parchment.
When it was his time to shower, Harry made sure that all his belongings were locked and warded in his trunk and that he took his wand with him. After seeing it in Riddle’s hand last year, Harry had kept it close. It was nice to be able to use magic again. A part of him couldn’t wait for classes tomorrow. Harry was slipping on his Cannon’s t-shirt Ron got him for Christmas last year when the candles flickered like they had on the train, Harry’s mind supplied. Harry finished dressing quickly, and grabbed his wand. He opened the door back to the dorm and all he saw was darkness. The only light was the light from the lake, shining through the glass in the corner. Harry’s mind raced, though rationally he knew this was probably just one of Malfoy’s pranks. He lowered his wand intent on not giving Malfoy the satisfaction. Heading to his bed he stopped when he heard Millicent’s voice. It was a quick scream, followed by “Harry!”
Harry couldn’t think anymore. He felt the last of his strength leave him, and his head hit the ground as he fainted.
“My godson!” he proclaimed loudly looking Harry over as if he expected him to be injured some place only Sirius could find. Harry hugged him.
“Good thing you decided to be rude to both your sister and Hermione, no need to hear Granger whinge all year because she can’t read her homework.”
“So,” said Hagrid. “if you wan’ ter come a bit nearer.” A few people cautiously approached the fence, Blaise among them.
The girl eyed Winsome and the other boy speculatively. Winsome just nodded his head like he hadn’t considered it in the first, but the other boy continued, “So Potter is in bed with Malfoy? Huh?”
Snape strode forward, past Dumbledore pulling up the left sleeve of his forearm and showed it to Fudge who recoiled.
Harry got to his feet, trod on the end of his robes, and stumbled slightly. He set off up the gap that had formed for him. With the hundreds of eyes upon him, it felt like he was walking hundreds of feet verses just a few. The buzz of conversation and awes, grew louder and louder as he reached Professor Dumbledore.
“Marvelous,” said George, pushing Fred aside and seizing Harry’s hand in turn. He then pulled Harry and Percy into a hug.
“No spell can reawaken the dead,” Dumbledore said heavily. “All that would have happened is a kind of reverse echo. A shadow of the living Cassius which retained his appearance and character.”
“He left her and returned to his muggle parents before I was even born, Potter, and she died giving birth to me, leaving me to be raised in a Muggle orphanage….but I vowed to find him… I revenged myself upon him, that fool who gave me his name…. Tom Riddle…., but I’m growing sentimental. Blood doesn’t always make family….But look, Harry! My true family returns.”
“I do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped Black enter it,” said Dumbledore, his tone making it clear that the discussion was closed. “I must go down to the dementors, I said I would inform them when our search was complete.”
The hall immediately began to buzz excitedly; the Gryffindors telling the rest of the school what had happened.
“Yes, sir,” said Flint, motioning for Harry to follow him as Snape turned his back on his students and walked back to his desk.
Fudge blocked this out. Argued. It was as if Fudge had his hands over his ears saying, “Nananananananana.” For all he was listening to the rest of them.
They didn’t tell him much, but a large, black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, it fell open.
There was a howl and a rumbling growl; Harry turned to see the werewolf taking flight; it was galloping into the forest.
“You’re expecting too much of yourself,” said Professor Lupin sternly in their fourth week of practice. “For a thirteen-year-old wizard, even an indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement. You aren’t passing out anymore, are you?”
His wand arm shook, but Harry didn't doubt Draco’s resolve or Draco’s family hatred of any and all things Weasley. Harry spotted a crumbling stone off about twenty feet into the woods, and covering his own ears the best he could sent a mild blasting curse into the rock. The reverberations echoed against every tree in the vicinity, and Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle let out an unholy yelp and ran back towards town. But Harry wasn't quite done.
Harry smiled, glad that Hermione knew him better than to badger him about the hearing. Looking around at the table, Harry knew that they all did. This was his new, if extended family. But there was something else going on.
Draco wondered at that, were some people really as cold as to burn their marks off before they even met with them? Before they even knew their name? Draco had heard of the extremists, those who were fervently against the marks, but he had always thought they were really more bark than bite. Draco should have known that nothing was impossible.
“I’m funny,” Harry defended. “Yeah, mate, but Bulstrode needs more backbone, someone who won’t back down when they know she’s wrong.”
“Enough!” roared a voice, who sent a spell that knocked the most outspoken of the group to the floor.
Scabbers had been presumed dead and Ron and Hermione were doing nothing but glaring daggers at one another. Millicent found it absolutely hilarious while Harry was just trying to make it through his days.
“Yes,” Dumbledore said, like he had read his mind. “I believe he brought that particular basket.” Dumbledore pointed to a silver and green basket that help loads and loads of Sugar Quills, which he knew were Goyle’s favorites.
“No offense mate, but with Hermione’s knowledge of curses and antique toxic potions you better do more than hope.”
“Blaise was hit by a core severing hex and was in a coma. There was dark magic gripping his core like tendrils. I took care of it.”
Harry deflated a little at this. "Draco deserves his chance at life without a Dark Lord just as much as you do. You will get along. Now eat your breakfast and give it a rest."
Draco held him as Harry had another infamous meltdown, knowing he was enabling him and knowing that he’d have to bring it to Dumbledore soon if it didn’t stop, regardless of his feelings towards the Headmaster.
Remus nodded tightly. “Physically, yes. They need a clear diagnosis to figure out how to help him mentally. He’s going to need you, all he’s done since the battle besides demanding to attend all the funerals was ask when he could see you—are you ready for that kind of commitment?”
Harry grabbed his hands again, squeezing them tightly. “This is why you need to stay here and be safe. I miss you every single day. I was being apparated away in Malfoy Manor and all I could think about is you. I saw your mum’s face and all I could focus on was wondering how you were doing. The thoughts were so strong I circumvented House Elf magic and warped it to my needs subconsciously. If I don’t have you to return to, I will die.”
Remus nodded. “They’re confident that they can do it. Unlike your injury, the core didn’t deplete, it just sort of unstitched itself. It’s going to be awhile before he wakes, though. It’s a tricky process.”
Harry entered the room and it was like a punch in the gut to the ex-Malfoy Heir. He wanted to kiss him and slap him at the same time. “Hello, everyone,” he said in surprise, eyes widening behind his thick frames. “I was honestly only expecting Dad, given the full moon and everything—thought you’d want to rest.”
Draco tried to smile, but his anxiety couldn’t let him feel glad for much at the moment. He walked out with Sirius back to his group as the whispers got louder among the students.
"Well you definitely seem it, Potter," Draco butted in, feeling uncomfortable that the golden trio of all people were at odds. Harry jumped at Draco's voice and Hermione and Ron whipped around to face him fully. Draco raised an eyebrow at their glares. "Hello, friends."
Draco nodded. “Especially around Harry. I get this urge to…” he stopped, a blush rising to his cheeks.
“Learned my lesson,” was all Draco said in reply, moodily looking out towards his window as he felt the potion make the world a bit muffled. A week and a half left to make it to break and he’d all but shattered it. He closed his eyes, not used to the potion after being off of it for so long, and drifted off.
“Out. I want to go out. I have a fake.” Harry began rummaging through his things and then stopped. “Right. Guess it won’t work with having a different face and all.” He looked deflated as he sat back on his bed.
The elder Black made his way to his old bedroom, worried about what he might find beyond the door. He had lost so much time with Harry and it was hard to tell if the teen would let him in. When he arrived at the door he paused for a moment, trying to hear what was going on inside. He heard heavy breathing and a whispered “
"I mean no. Fenrir told me that Wolfsbane potion poisons me. Why would he want me to suddenly take it? I'm not poisoning my wolf – that's like turning on myself."
Sirius followed his gaze. “Oh, him?” he asked. “Miracle child, apparently. Harry brought him back on accident.”
Draco felt his heart sank as he realized that something he wanted was so close yet so far away. “I’m a werewolf
Remus rested his hand on Harry's shoulder and squeezed it reassuringly. "It's alright Harry. Care to elaborate what the fight was about?"
Draco took the opportunity to lean into Harry, resting his head against his shoulder. It felt comforting to finally have confirmation that he was still breathing after a few days away from him. “I’ve missed you,” the blonde murmured.
“It’s still regenerating. We can have you do some light spellwork tomorrow to assess where you’re at.” She smiled at Draco. “This is good; your body is doing what it’s supposed to.”
“I just thought I’d be cured by now. I’ve been doing therapy since the incident. I snapped into anxiety and depression like it was nothing.”
“Oh I dunno,” Remus responded sarcastically, “maybe sneaking out of bed past hours and not letting anyone know where you were.”
Jack laughed. Draco scowled. The Blacks did not doom spiral. Though, he supposed his mother could be a bit self loathing at times. And he’s heard stories about Aunt Walburga throwing quite a fit or two. But this was different, Draco posited to himself as his eyelids grew heavy, despite his efforts to keep listening. Lupin had drugged him, he realized as he let out a yawn. “He’ll be fine, Remus. Get some rest,” is all the blonde heard before succumbing to the potion.
As if Merlin were against him, Harry took that moment to saunter over and plop down unceremoniously next to Draco. “This. Is. Fun.” He said, punctuating each word as though trying not to slur. He eyed Draco’s drink. “What’s that then?”
“Draco I’m fine. I’m not going mad,” Harry protested as Draco dragged him up, no match for his werewolf strength this close to the full moon.
"You're not the enemy, Draco," Harry replied. Draco started at his first name. He looked up at Harry, noticing how bright his eyes were once again. He was looking at Draco in a caring manner and Draco wasn't sure if he could stand it. Harry wiped a remaining tear from his eye, surprising the blond further. "You're just you."
“I’m your Den Mother, yes,” Sirius replied. Harry grinned at that, which made Draco’s heart soar. “You’re all adults in the eyes of the Wizarding World. You don’t have the same restrictions as younger years—no curfew, no travel restrictions, et cetera. However, this means that you need to take care to attend to your lessons and use your time wisely. This is your chance to finish strong, finally in a time of peace. I know Voldemort has loomed over each of your heads since the beginning of your schooling. Now is the time to relax and dig into what you can learn unburdened.” His eyes landed softly on his son as he said those words, shining brightly as reality hit. “Your schedules are in your rooms, my quarters are just down the hall, and I’ll see you first thing on Monday.”
Luck was on his side in that regard, it turns out, because Kingsley Shacklebolt was assigned to doing morning walks around Muggle London with Draco each day to work his legs out—Healer mandated.
“The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving in October and remaining with us for the greater part of this year. I know that you will extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with us, and will give your whole-hearted support to the Hogwarts champion when he or she is selected.
The campsite was amazing. Harry had rarely seen so much magic or so many wizards in one place with the exception of Hogwarts. Mr. Weasley sent Ron, Hermione, and Harry off on an errand. On their way back they ran into Seamus Finnigan. They had wandered into a patch of tents that were all covered with a thick growth of shamrocks, so that it looked as though small, oddly shaped hillocks had sprouted out of the earth.
“There we go,” said Remus as he chucked a handful of Floo powder into the fireplace and inviting green flames lit up inside. Remus stepped into the flames and then Harry followed, an awed look on his face.
“I thought of Stop the Outrageous Abuse of Our Fellow Magical Creatures and Campaign for a Change in Their Legal Status, but it wouldn’t fit on the pins. So that’s the heading of our manifesto. I’ve been researching it thoroughly in the library. Elf enslavement goes back centuries. I can’t believe no one’s done anything about it before now.”
Black had already retrieved Snape’s wand from the bed. He approached Lupin and the struggling rat, and his wet eyes suddenly seemed to be burning in his face.
“Both Miss Bulstrode and Miss Granger will be relieved that you have come round, so shall Mr. Weasley and Mr. Longbottom, even Mr. Zabini showed a bit of interest in your well-being. Mr. Goyle even stopped by.”
He paused and Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley said about Dumbledore not being happy with the dementors guarding the school.
“And what do you want out of it?” Harry asked, knowing that nothing with Draco Malfoy came without a cost.
Harry could hear the simultaneous gulp of the students, their minds wondering what exactly that could mean and their eyes saying that there is no way that they want to find out.
Harry was never more amazed by magic than in moments like this. Flying, spells, those were one thing, but the Great Hall for the Yule Ball was spectacular. Snow drifted from the ceiling, glitter and shine had replaced the dark wood and boring paint.
“Millicent,” Harry sighed, just happy to see his friend again. He released a breath, Millicent putting him at ease the way few other people could.
“You see, Potter,” said Draco standing. “I’m very intrinsically motivated. Hagrid is a stain on this school, worse than the mudbloods. Half breeds are abominations.”
Silently they tramped through the grounds, the castle lights growing larger as they went. A cloud shifted and their party was bathed in moonlight.
“Ah, there’s Penelope!” said Percy, smoothing his hair and going pink again. Harry looked to Millicent to see if she already knew about this, but she was too busy talking to Ginny to notice Percy striding over toward and a girl with long, curly hair, his chest thrust out so that she couldn’t miss his shiny badge.
Harry looked at the broom in Flint’s hands, hoping Millicent wasn’t right and that there wasn’t some sort of hex on the thing. He had meant to ask Lupin about it today, but that clearly didn’t happen.
Harry opened his eyes slightly, just enough to see Percy’s face rapt with attention, and Snape’s profile, which looked angry.
“Werewolves,” Snape said. “Though, I assured him that he must have been mistaken. There would be no werewolves that close to Hosgmeade Village. But he, and Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle both insist that they not only heard werewolves, but were also under attack.”
A few cauldrons away, Neville was in trouble. Neville regularly went to pieces in Potions lessons, his fear of Snape only increasing his difficulties. His potion was now a bright orange color and as Hermione and tried her best to help him.
Harry sat on his bed for a long time, absentmindedly stroking Hedwig. As the sun began to rise Harry could hardly believe that he had left Pivet Drive only a few hours ago, that he wasn’t expelled, and that he was now facing three completely Dursley-free weeks.
“Beautiful, isn’t he?” said Hermione glowing at the enormous orange cat that she had cradled in her arms.
“Like fighting a dragon, and nearly drowning have been purely mental? Maybe I should have left you to find a state of Nirvana with the merpeople instead of rescuing you.”
“Of course it’s not Him,” said Mr. Weasley impatiently. “We don’t know who it was; it looks like they Disapparated. Now excuse me, I want to get to bed.”
“But he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore. “He cannot give evidence about why he killed those people.”
“Finally,” said Ron, grinning at Harry as he sat down. “We went to the Leaky Cauldron, but they said you’d left, and we went to Flourish and Blotts, mate, we’ve been everywhere.”
The group made a run for it as Ron disappeared into the hole at the base of the tree. They barely missed the lethal branches as they scurried in after them and landed in a tunnel. Harry recognized it as one he had seen on the Marauder’s Map, but without it, he wasn’t sure where it led.
“That is exactly what they said, sir! And Dobby likes work but he wants to wear clothes and he wants to be paid Harry Potter…Dobby likes being free.”
Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. Roasting marshmellows, and plotting ways to get Malfoy expelled from school took up the majority of their time.
Thanks for reading, I do not own Harry James, though I would like to be his friend. I hope you comment, I'd love to hear what you think. If you have questions you can message me here, leave a comment, or send me an ask on Tumblr at inkdrinkershadowsinger, you could also tweet me, and I mean you Jo Rowling. Thanks, and much love.
Harry backed against the wall, knowing that they couldn’t see them, but that didn’t mean they couldn’t knock into him. They walked straight past him, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.
“Mate,” Ron said in complete shock. “That was wicked. The way that dragon just nudged you the egg. We all had no idea what you were saying of course, but…. Wow! I’m glad that I told you about the dragons in advance.”
“Ms. Parkinson,” Snape reprimanded. While Dumbledore said, “Ms. Bulstrode?” in a whisper like he couldn’t believe that what she told him was true.
“Well!” said Lupin, clapping his hands together and looking around cheerfully. “That seems to clear that up! Severus, I’ll take this back, shall I?” He folded the map and tucked it inside his robes. “Harry, Ron, come with me, I
“I don’t think so,” said a wizard with a scrubby brown beard. It was Amos Diggory, Cedric’s father. “Our Stunners went right through those trees….There’s a good chance we got them….”
“Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?” said Pansy Parkinson. “Never thought you’d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.
“Dobby…Dobby could,” he said, doubtfully, before squaring his small shoulders. “Dobby could tell, Harry Potter, that his old masters were….were bad Dark wizards. And about their friends.”
Except, as Harry moved to dodge another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head his broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall too. He gripped the
“You might be taking a few notes on that yourself, Potter, you’re gonna be quite the commodity until this whole thing is over.”
“I’ll be moving to Chaser, Flint says I’ve got the speed for it,” said Malfoy. Harry simply nodded, knowing Malfoy couldn’t be that pleased at having to change positions. Crabbe looked like he wanted to say something else, but then Professor Lupin snorted loudly.
“Nothing,” Malfoy said, putting his hand on Crabbe’s shoulder. “Come on,” he muttered to Crabbe and Goyle before disappearing down the train corridor.
“He’s an idiot, but he’s brilliant,” she sighed. “and, he’s mine so….” She shrugged, then gave her fiancé a broad smile. George turned as she had said his name and smiled stupidly back at her before returning to torturing Bill. It was one of the things that had saved them both several times out in the field, the inherent awareness of one another, that almost locator like ability to tell where one another was at any time. The people at the office chalked it up to a good partnership.
Malfoy had potential. He wasn’t all sneers and mockings. Harry could see that much. At times, it almost felt like something tangible connected them, something more than the vile nature of a sour would be friendship. No matter what he did that year, it felt like Malfoy was always there, watching him, waiting for him to mess up.
“No, though being as forgetful as she is she’ll probably wonder back in October sometime thinking it’s still July.”
“Any potential you think I have, Malfoy can’t be a good thing. And besides you forget that I didn’t enter and therefore have no idea what exactly I will be up against.”
“Wha…” Harry started, when the sound of something exploding echoed from downstairs. Ron, Harry, and Blaise all looked at one another, and ran downstairs. Sirius was shaking, his wand drawn and still pointing at a now decimated side table as Remus was pacing, a low growl echoing in his throat. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley stood off to the side, huddled together.
Pettigrew shook his head, looking for all the world like he would have rather swallowed his own tongue than admit what had really happened.
“WAIT! You can’t do it just like that…they need to understand…we’ve got to explain, at least to Harry. He needs to know.”
“What has happened?” said Dumbledore sharply, coming through the doors and looking from Cornelius Fudge to Professor McGonagall.
“Yeah, mate,” said Ron as he pulled Harry close to him, “Thank Merlin, you got out of that one. It was a load of hippogriff...” Ron glanced around him to make sure that Mrs. Weasley couldn’t hear him. “you know what, if you ask me.”
The Womping Willow was planted for me, this house and the tunnel that leads here were built for my use. My once a month transformations were….”
“The Bludgers rocket around trying to knock players off their brooms. That’s why you have two Beaters on each team—your Gryffindor friends are the ones for Wood’s team—it’s the Beaters job to knock the Bludgers away from their teammates and toward the other team.”
with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.
Harry had never been a part of a stranger group. Crookshanks led the way down the stairs; Lupin had tied up Pettigrew and was leading him by a rope as Millicent leaned on him for support for her ankle. The two seemed to be talking intently. Hermione helped Ron behind them, wands trained on Pettigrew. Next, came Professor Snape, drifting creepily along, his toes hitting the stair as they descended, held up by his own wand, which was being pointed at him by Sirius. Harry brought up the rear.
“And then, there’s Millicent, and Sirius, while I am aware that you have spent a good chunk of time in Azkaban you should know that whatever terrors you may have
Harry had swallowed a considerable amount of bubbles in shock. He stood up, spluttering, and saw the ghost of a very glum looking girl sitting cross-legged on top of one of the taps.
“We’ve named her Rose, and we, Hermione and I, plus the family have agreed that well…” Ron stuttered. “We want you two to be Rosie’s godparents.”
After getting dressed and heading back to the common room, Harry was almost there when he felt someone pull on his collar.
Harry ripped the parcel open and gaped as a magnificent gleaming broomstick rolled out onto his bedspread. Blaise dropped his package and jumped off his bed for a closer look.
Harry counted to three in his head. One…two…he started to turn slowly. He was nearly out of the bath when something sharp grabbed his ankle. Harry pushed through, but the creature wouldn’t let go. Harry looked back, and could see the merperson’s tiny head but large mouth with its sharp teeth open trying actively to bite his ankle and drag him back under the water.
“Ms. Bulstrode,” Malfoy nodded primly. “Thank you for the gift that you have bestowed upon my house. It is most welcome.”
“Do you not see that unicorn?” Firenze bellowed at Bane. “Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with
They were all positively soaked as they made their way into the castle. Peeves was launching water balloons at unsuspecting fifth years soaking them even further until Professor McGonagall threatened to get Dumbledore.
Nefertani sticking out her tongue: love you should know me better than that you know I have the tendency to ..go with the flow
I sat at my spot at the head of the table after putting the twins in their seats and getting a messy banana kiss from Harry and Elisa.
Yes it's TRUE we no longer had a ghost as a teacher but a young man that was more interactive having us play games and have us do reenactments of a time before the founders.
Fred finished as they literally dragged a protesting Percy up the stairs leaving me with my older mates.
Elisa walked out to cheers carrying Harry and once he was seen there was silence ..as all they saw was a child with our features and green eyes
" I missed  you , I know it's only been a couple of hours  but I need you to save me from my own house! They are so
Tired already Harry fell asleep in my arms while my wife and I were signing the papers to make it official. "Should we change his name" Elisa asked. " Just a little I said ..how do you like Hadrian James Potter Ptolemy Black so we can still call him Harry?" "Its perfect " Elisa Said as she kissed his forehead. Then lastly we did a blood test to make sure everything was alright overall.
George -"My twin and I recently made a product that allows people to write a contract upon, and depending on what was bargained upon, the more dastardly the consequences are ."
Lucius suspected that squibs were made by too much interbreeding ,so when I confirmed the theory he wasn't so surprised
Which led to me scenting all of my mates because it made me feel uncomfortable  not scenting them all.
The Floor shook and white whispered exited each Horcrucx including Harry and melded into one being that started to take shape surrounded by golden light from Harry and i giving him a body.
As soon as we got off The train Fred and George (who were surprised I could tell them apart after only knowing them for a couple hours) had a hard time leaving me until my dad showed up. Then after hearing the situation promised that they would see me later and said that they needed to have a nice chat and dragged them away. Then a giant was calling for first years and I recognized him as hagrid the groundskeeper and we followed him on to boats that could carry four students across the lake. I got in with Neville,Draco,and Theo and as soon as we turned the corner to see the castle all of our breaths caught  in awe. I could feel the magic in the very air it was.. intoxicating . After we got off the boats we were dropped off with a Stern woman with her hair pulled into a bun.
I nodded " My Tata taught me and my siblings how to do magic  without wands because I quote ' Only fools and idiots have wands as their only weapon or resource up their sleeves. We Ptolemies use any means to triumph over our enemies..even pranks and other humiliating means."
Elisa put her hand over her mouth and ran to Harry and picked him up while my face became grim. The healer asked me if I would like them to remove it , I looked at Harry's red tie's that led to his mates ...shit was all I could think "no thank you I will deal with it myself "I said.
Albus: ahem- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start of term notice me to give you first-year should note that the forest on the ground is forbidden to All pupils. And A few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.
The rest of my younger mates Draco,the twins,Blaise, Theo,Terry,Cedric,  and Percy were confused and asked what that was all about. But I simply shook my head when I was questioned.
"Alright  harry that's enough teasing , I dear you will give Draco a aneurism if you dont stop." Neville  said and I pouted but relented to Draco's relief.
He was probably busy investigating who poisoned My Sev. But it was kinda embarrassing because my mom showed me favouritism along with my mates making all of us blush especially Terry who attempted to hide behind his book when she gave him praise and points for answering a question about about the Protego spell.
Nefertani: take Harry really quick and put him in a lazy outfit for the day for me while we talk ...to this gentleman.
And as I glanced at the head table again my Tata was whispering quickly into Snape's ear I simply turned back to my food and hoped everything is ok.
She said with glee and started  spouting  scenarios  more upsurd than the last that made all of us even Draco crack a smile as she led us to our quarters.
When we reached them all of our breaths were taken away. For the carpet was a warm shade of purple  and the furniture  was made for top comfort  and dark rich brown. And through the hallway there was three doors, one for the enormous kitchen that was connected to a dining area slash entertainment area, another for the large bedroom that could probably hold 30 people easily ,and lastly the third room doubled as a study and lab.
"My friend, pardon me if I may cut in?" He said in a tone that didn't allow an argument as he all but pushed Hernando away from me to take my willful hands I held out to him in response to his question.
Neville: everything will be ok ? Remember that no matter what  house you go in we will always  love you. Draco hummed his affirmative When a second later some students behind me screamed and I jumped and bumped into a boy with violet eyes and dark skin that was behind me. As I apologised to him we bonded and not a second later McGonagall was back and ordered us to line up and follow her my new mate grabbed my wrist so I was behind him in the line and said.
I went into a room that was set up as a office the one that had the ruined family tapestry to see a new one in its place with no scorch marks signifying a disowned family member.
Marcus turned around and told me in a tone that brokered no argument to go back to our rooms when we arrived at the showers not far from the pitch or school.
I asked innocently and everyone except Lucius burst out laughing when the Longbottoms joined us which made me throw myself at Neville and repeat my Koala routine while the adults caught up until the last whistle blew. After we said goodbye to our parents the twins,Draco, Neville and I got onto the train  and chose a compartment in the back that held a boy with brown hair and eyes and pale skin who was reading a book about hexes.
When nefertani was a child she lived in Egypt with her parents ( who were ruling) before her Aunt overthrew her parents causing her and her two younger siblings to flee to England and live on the streets and in the woods. When Nefertani was 12 she ran into a group of abused or neglected muggle-borns and squibs that were in the same situation as her and her siblings. One of the leaders of the group was a 9-year old squib named Elisa Malfoy. They grew to be best friends and they built a small village in the Bourne woods and lived peacefully using magic and slowly growing as they accepted everyone whether wizard, creature, and mortals that had nowhere to go ( all were sworn to secrecy by a magical Vow to not reveal the location if questioned). Until Nefertani's aunt heard she was still living and sent assassins. Deciding enough was enough she confronted her aunt and reclaimed her thrown. But some of the purebloods wished to be rid of Elisa and the others in the small kingdom they built. To Avoid this Elisa and Nefertani married but in the laws of Nefertani's people if the queen has not given birth to an heir in 7 years the marriage can be overturned.
Nefertani: yes, but I'm not that surprised he bonded with you after all he actually KNOWS you guys ,trusts you,and loves you. Not to mention that Sirius you are a very powerful wizard in your own right and your magical aura appeals to his. Remus though I believe the reason Harry bonded to you is because your mind wavelength and creatures match together very well. After all you need mates who are smart and who understand you rather than big muscle heads that only have strength or power up their sleeves.
"Captain,  I know I just started out as a reserve member no less ..but I agree with my mate in that our game plan and tactics should be tweaked so they aren't as obvious or predictable. And I believe the one he came up with would give us the win." He said his voice calm as he stared at me in pride, making me purr in happiness.
Sirius simply  laughed  and patted me on the back as we all agreed to my plan . And Severus shivered when he saw my smile..I guess I looked scary eyes glowing green,  murderous intent shining in them with my fangs on display .
The brunch continued on with banter and family conversation until it was time to get ready for the coronations.
Elisa: we all knew i was a squib! You could have gotten custody of me! Hell you're the head of house you could have commanded him to give me up.
Lucius: because he threatened our son and I was too busy taking care of other threats to the family *sighs*  I just wanted to let you know that I am happy and proud of you .
We walked into the circular chamber that had a chair in the middle of the room with chains around the arm rest. Elisa sat by my side and we waited for the trial to start. Others from the magical law department came and sat as well as the wizengamot.then the room was full.
Draco, the twins and Blaise all grumbled for a while but later dropped it like the rest of my mates already have.
Everyone was silent until Slytherin started clapping and my mates then everyone else as I walked to sit by Draco. And when I looked up at the table to my Tata who was speaking to Aurora sinistra looked at me and smiled and mouthed
Sirius: I still can't believe this .. James  and Lilly will torture me in horrendous ways when I see them again
Such as Dance, Singing, Latin, Ancient Egyptian and Martial arts. All of them rotated into wherever they fit in my schedule.
Lucius: it has been a long time since I have seen you Elisa ...I am glad you are well let us have this conversation away from prying ears.
Harry was now awake wiggled to be put down and took off to the play area where Draco and Neville were as soon as his feet touched the ground.
"Harry get off of me!" He said ,I of course ignored him and continued to hang onto him like a leech.
Marvolo along with my Tata found him after doing a sweep through the houses of ministry officials they were seeking to have thrown in Azkaban due to their dirty dealings .One of them being the late Mr.Crouch,  who was sent to a newly  reformed Azkaban prison(that no longer had dementors) along with many other members of parliament that were hurting our society.
He then went over to rabastian and started playing with him since he was by himself (draco and Neville playing with a jack in the box with Sirius.
As the dragons and nymphs cheered I put the scepters on the pillows held by servants that quickly left to get away from. Adoring crowd.
Tata quickly left with mom after hasty apologies to my younger mates , seems the plan actually worked!
We then entered  the charms classroom  and all sat together  Terry closest  to me as I scented him gently.
Nefertani: first off I would like you to stay at my palace either indefinitely or until your house is remodeled and cleaned -
Though I was very  peeved  that madam Pomfrey shooed me out along with Severus himself to go attend my classes about 30 minutes before they began. Which I honestly didn't give a bloodly shit  about my classes at the moment.
Then I started to draw the circle took the dropper and put a drop of Harry's blood on each Horcrucx and when I finished I commanded everyone but Rabastian who was consoling a sniffing Harry to gather around to hold hands.
I awoke at the usual Time Harry wakes when I remembered he was staying with Sirius and Remus in their quarters.... And today I had no urgent matters to attend to. That I knew of anyway I got up and went to the bathroom to get ready for the day. As I was getting dressed my hair grew longer and turned black my eyes went back to  a Golden color . I was growing tired of the coldness that comes with ice fae so I went back to my mage form.
Nefertani: now listen closely I need to tell you something important...so you know that Elisa and I had to go away to do something very important this morning right?
Sirius and Elisa joined us not long after and started to eat the menu was hickory bourbon salmon  with salad for the adults and chicken tenders and broccoli and cheese for the kids. (Yes it isn't a royal meal but it's what we wanted and agreed upon). After I finally convinced the kids to eat their broccoli (no ,Helios I am not trying to poison you for your throne!! JUST EAT THE DAMN BROCCOLI!)  Sirius got a letter from the goblins working on Grimmauld place.
Half way pass the showers  I saw Oliver wood Sitting by himself behind the Griffindor showers head in his hands.
I told them it was robbers and that I fought four at once and was winning which they realized and porkey-ed away.The Longbottoms accepted this story and were led to there rooms for the night.
But as I opened my mouth to ask the big question Severus  rose a eyebrow  at Percy "what do we have here another  weasley..." he said in his dark drawl and held out a hand to a scowling Sirius  who gave him 10 gallions .
Nefertani: alright I need all of you to sit on the couch while I draw the circle to put Voldemort back together and then I'll need some of Harry's blood to bind him and Voldemort together. I then gave Rabastian a device that looked like a dropper but had a needle at the end.
Everyone  finished  the song at their own time but my mates the devil twins had to go the slowest..but I cannot  lie for it brought  a smile to my lips.
Now I was by the snacking table , the music changing to a more upbeat song as I took a nibble off a straw berry when someone stood next to me.
Remus growling at the locket: I don't think you should touch it Nefertani it is making my instincts go haywire..
"Severus  was poisoned,  I gave him a Bezour but he might need more attention." I said voice  high and strained.
A bond appeared not a second later, tying us together as I let him cry his frustration out on my shoulder.
Nefertani:ENOUGH!!you are grown men and women shut your mouths and listen to the truth!! Clear your opinions and look at this with clear and open eyes ! So that this man may have a trial that he was supposed to and if you cannot do that maybe you should leave and go home acting like the petulant children you are.
Sirius: *sighs* no actually they are almost done ,but my mother's house elf is causing trouble by stealing some items and hiding them away ,the horrible thing he is .
I was snapped  out of my pitty party by  George  picking me up like a sack of potatoes and heading towards the hallway.
Theo couldn't  handle it and burst out laughing along with Blaise  while we waited for the gryffindor to arrive.
I laughed and headed to Harry's room that was next to ours(connected of course) he was in his crib fascinated at the Griffins and ravens that were flying around  him that burst into sparkles Everytime he caught one which sent him squealing with laughter. I smiled
Nefertani: without all the legal jargon it's basically a contract where you will give us potion ingredients (that we will pay for) while we send some workers to your greenhouses to learn how to care for the plants so I can use my own land to grow our own  potion ingredients. As well as allowing you a percentage of the benefits of the results of experiments done with the plants. The official document is right here.
Nefertani: today my people we are here to honor me and my family as well as the dragon shifters and the land nymphs by giving them a monarch for which they have been denied for centuries!That shall provide and protect them from their enemies. I know that most of you are curious of me because I am new and you wish to know what my plans are for this kingdom. But my goal is to Rush In a new era where no one either Mortals, magical creatures or sorceress shall fear prejudice or hate. None of my people will worry of starvation or of War for I shall strive my best to make sure that none of these become a problem. Now let me introduce my blood brother and adopted son! The new Prince of dragons Heir to the throne of Dragons Helios Ptolemy Shadeslayer !
"I'm Harry it's nice to meet you." I said genuinely and dragged  him along with me to charms. Introducing him to Theo,Blaise, Draco, And Neville as I did so.
I kinda chickened out on putting the mates and creature inheritance down because i'm indecisive. i  need opinions.
Harry immediately reached out to Marvolo from rabastian tears and tantrum threatening if wish is not given.
Alice tells Frank the news, and Nefertani joins the goblins in cleaning up The black manor and Grimmauld place.
I of course  ignored  him and opened the door to our rooms and headed  inside . Sirius,Severus (completely healed up),Remus, Marvolo, Tata,and my mom were deep in conversation with grave expressions but as soon as they saw us they stopped.
Harry: now firstly I would like to let you know that I am a chameleon and because of this I have multiple mates. Meaning I have a special arrangement at Hogwarts as my mates and I have our own rooms next to my parents rooms. But if you prefer to stay in your common room or switch between the two I understand-
When I left the bathroom I looked at the clock it was only 8 AM I went over to Elisa and started to kiss her neck and face breathing in her scent of chocolate and strawberries.
Seeing my murderous  expression Marvolo suprises everyone by being the one to caution me from committing murder via execution.
Lucius: Elisa I can't even begin to apologize for what my brother did to you ..narcissa and I have been searching for your for many years and found no trace of you though I'm guessing part of it was due to your husband...
Then it was time for bed and I was cocooned by Theo and  Tomas who always fought for a place at my side. And fell asleep  peacefully with no worries.
"A day ago we are all aware that Severus was poisoned by a house elf, which is why most of you now wear consort rings to protect you from. It has come to our attention it was council member Henry who was responsible as well as Theo's  grandfather." Marvolo said.
Harry having sensed the tension looked like he was going to burst into tears but started laughing along with the twins after I smacked them
As we finished A fourth year Hufflepuff came in and nearly  ran me over in his haste to reach Miss Sprouts.
"The kingdom is  broken up into 3 parts kind of like the American system, One is the Justice system that judges laws and what they mean, The branch that enforces the laws called Executive Branch, and the one that writes the laws called Legislative branch." I said deciding to explain it simply.
Elisa Ptolemy: is a squib born to Lucius's Malfoy younger brother Mathias ( who is dead). she has black hair blue eyes and is very short ( do not ever comment on it because you will die!)
Nefertani: there is two more people I must introduce Elisa of the Malfoy family,Leader of the Forgotten, my wife and consort ,and queen of the Ptolemies lands!
Nefertani: Bellatrix calm down ! He is still asleep because he is trying to get his memories and souls in order ! Now I think it about time you all left save rabastian until your lords awakes. And is calm enough to even think! I shall immediately let you know if his state changes!
The commentator who I recognized as the Twins friend Lee Jordan had all of me and my friends and Stitches half way through because of his personality and jokes that often led to Mcgonagall berating him.
I promptly ignored him and once he realised I wasn't going to change my mind ,he looked at the ceiling praying for lady magic to have mercy before following Blaise and I to the Slytherin common room.
"Is it common for you to use Wandless magic Harry?" Severus drawled as he cut his Turnover into smaller  pieces.
"Draco I have a perfect idea! Let's go down to the common room to talk to flint and convince him to change tactics!" I mentally applauded myself for solving the issues while Draco stared at me in horror before he snapped back to reality.
Then as I was in the greenhouse with the children when a guard told me that councilman Henry  requested an audience.
Including my long missed and adored mate, not giving a flying fuck who saw I threw myself into his arms as he peppered my face with kisses.
Neville  certainly enjoyed it as much as I but Theo and Draco thought it was horribly boring.  Blaise ,Dean, and Seamus were Neutral on the subject they neither hated it or loved it.
Marcus's broad shoulders were tense betraying his anger as his dark eyes locked onto my face challenging me to look away when he spoke
Sirius was struggling not to laugh at Harry who was smeared fruit all over his face while Remus sighed and tried to help Harry get his food in his mouth not on his face.
Remus was simply watching our little drama unfold, while Blaise and I got ready to head to the common room.
At last the desserts to disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore Got To His Feet Again. The hall fell silent.
He is hastily given to Marvolo by a pale Rabastian and he holds Harry away from his body and looks to me in bewilderment
"Who are your friends?" I asked looking at them when I made eye contact with them both I bonded with each of them.
" Do you not have perfect duties  that require your attention weasley?" Draco  questioned  sharply but I laid my hand on his arm as I grabbed Percy's  hand and started  walking  back to our rooms.
Now here I am enlarging my rooms to fit another mate in, My elder mates mainly leading the endeavor.
"Excuse me your majesty...may I have this dance?" Said a man that had an olive skin tone with dark hair and eyes, both gleaming with some intention as my gut sank.
The expressions of some of his more extreme  followers  when they were told of the new plan will forever make me cackle like bellatrix.
‘The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rule-breaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honour. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.
I grabbed  my bag that held all my needed  supplies  and headed  out after giving them quick  kisses on the cheek.
When other Ravenclaw students started to file in to sit on the other side of the room. Immediately  when the last student,  a boy in ravenclaw walked pass me, I got a hint of the smell of books,parchment, and ink.
I just realised  that in the last chapter  I forgot  to put the hats song in it so ..sorry for that.
I relaxed  stress from earlier  melting  away when our door opened  and Severus  himself  walked in.
Harry nodded and patted the side of his that was opened  since he moved to the other side of Severus .
I immediately bonded with them when they looked me in the eye with amusement..that turned to confusion and wonder.
Albus: welcome! Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts before we begin our banquet I would like to say a few words. And they are nitwit! Blubber! oddment! tweak!...thank you!
Harry turned those beautiful wide green eyes at me and screeched and lifted him self up and was jumping up and down(as much as babies can)
An hour later I fell asleep on Percy's shoulder after explaining what a Senator is and does, then was carried to bed by Fire dancer who fell asleep on one side while Dean claimed the other.
so can you please  just leave him be? I'm not saying  that you have to be best buddies  but it would  really  mean a lot if you could at least  be cordial with him. ..and I Also  think an apology  will go a long way.
And I was simply so tired that by the time we reached the hospital wing I blinking my eyes open wearily.
Nefertani: and kreacher after you bring the .. treasures make sure to bathe and dress yourself in these robes that black house elves wore in the past to show their pride of the house they served.
Kreacher: s-sshe would be so upset with kreacher yes she would but kreacher cannot let the treasure of house black to be taken or thrown away!
As soon as class was dismissed  I nearly  tackled  the Ravenclaw boy in a hurry to stop him from leaving.
Draco and I simply shared a look communicating our thoughts. While some people  clapped  at his 'speech'
The reason why the mate bond activated now and didn't in the past is because his creature inheritance(chameleon) is on the upfront and isn't suppressed .
Elisa's furious voice: Nefertani Everon Ptolemy you have 5 seconds to get your ass up here and explain to me why dangerous criminals are in our living room!! And so help me if I don't here a good reason it will be me and you!
Though some of the death eaters that were on the wizenmagot were not targeted due to us needing their votes. Meaning  Marvolo is controlling them for his own gain.
The twins who just happened to come through the door saw their brother then our entwined  hands and immediately  got those famous  mischievous smiles on their faces.
After Breakfast the Longbottoms returned home after which I read the Daily prophet out of boredom that was ranting over the Longbottoms break in. I then received a letter about Sirius's trial date.
Narcissa was chatting away with Bellatrix (who was glaring at me and Harry)and Alice about their husbands while Barty junior was bombarded by the twins with 'why,what,how' questions about anything and everything. Lucius was in conversation with Rodolphus while rabastian Sirius and Remus were bombarded by Draco and Neville in the play area.
Nefertani: I came upon Harry ABANDONED by Dumbledore on a mortals front step in the middle of the night. I took him home with me afterwards I blood adopted him with my wife to protect him.
"Its no harm done." The boy said  quietly  before taking my hand and meeting my eyes. And our bond snapped into place.
Blaise: Theo has mentioned  that we would be sharing  quarters do you know where they are? Are they going to be in the Slytherin dormitories? And who are your other mate's?
Suddenly  the food was vanished  replaced  by deserts  but I was too full to eat anything  but a small piece  of strawberry  tart. And I then laid  my head on to Draco's shoulder and started  to doze.
My other mates left to go upstairs to the other living room to probably watch TV. As I sat with a perplexed Percy on the couch.
Herbology wasn't that bad ,at the beginning of class we went over safety rules and such.Then we got to pick the stems and leaves from a dittany Bush , while wearing cloths over our noses incase of one of them decided to release fumes.
Harry: I know that they are by the kitchens so that's a No to your second  question . And my current  mates are Remus Lupin,Sirius Black, Fire dancer, Neville Longbottom, Fred Weasley, George Weasley, Draco, Theo, you, and...... Severus
I went up to Severus before  he reached  the door and gave him a hug ,he stiffened but patted my hair twice before turning and leaving  his robes  flapping  like wings in his wake.
Draco was complaining over not being able to bring his broom, much to Theo's displeasure and Blaise's amusement.
Now I didn't notice it because its normal for me to be with my classmates everyday, but I have been neglecting my elder mates .
Now don't get me wrong Henry's son was good looking but the way he looked at me....just made shiver go down my spine..like I was being hunted by a wolf.
That night I was sandwiched in between Remus and Sirius,  praying like I had caught Severus and percy doing earlier that my mate gathering slowed down just a little.
I left my friend's and mates behind after explain8i was going to congratulate my new mates, as I headed down to the pitch.
Harry is reunited with Sirius and Remus just how will they react when they realize Harry is now Nefertani's son?
Harry goes to his dormitory  with his mates ..but when Severus  shows up will he stay and give the mateship  a chance?
Elisa and I were dressed in the finest robes money can buy and we each wore our cobra crowns hers was silver while mine was gold.
"All right listen up! I know that recently there have been lots of new additions of various ages  but I will not tolerate any more of this nonsense continuing.  If you have and issue with someone or something speak up and we will have a conversation about it like responsible people until we find middle ground or a solution.  So who want to go first ?"
Theo who was sitting next to me sunk down into his chair,  I took his hand into mine and whispered to him how ot wasn't his fault and that it's ok.
Let's move on I said then we went back to the office we were in and the blood adoption potion was sitting waiting . Elisa passed Harry to me while she pricked her finger and out in three drops of blood , then I did the same. Then I turned to Harry and Said "open up Harry " and he did he drank it quickly then made a face and tried to get the taste out by blowing Raspberry's getting spit on me in the process. Elisa laughed and gave him some orange juice we brought for him in a sippy cup.we watched as his skin color changed into mine and his black messy hair grew longer and the ends of his hair became blonde , straight and thick.His eyes remained the same but they were more doe shaped and all most glowed. Beautiful was all I could think .
to so quickly take this and say 'win or die' it will take you to my palace tell my wife what happened I'll hold them off.
Nefertani: just a small prick on the finger should do and he will probably bawl after this so you are on comfort duty
By the time we had 30 minutes left of class I was done with all my homework and was tapping my foot impatiently  , because  I wanted to return to our rooms to see if anything  had been found out about how Severus got poisoned.
Nefertani: do not fret my child Severus  simply  went to move into your rooms and gather his thoughts..so let's  bet on Sirius' s and Remus's reaction  to realizing  that Severus  is your mate.
Nefertani: Sirius, you are now reinstated as lord black so you have some options when if comes to living arrangements..
Nefertani: enough ! Now every one I have business with today come along and Rabastian bring Harry with you.
Sirius held Harry so tightly as if he was afraid he would disappear  and couldn't believe he was real...when Harry gave him a wet kiss on the mouth. Golden light surrounded them and I cursed colorfully.
Neville and Seamus Also solved the issue that had with Draco and Terry which thankfully  got rid of the awful tension that was hanging around the house.
Remus smiled, " Exactly that's where the rest of the royal family comes in, the Heir and the other princesses/princes are given duties as he or she grows, as well as Consorts receiving seats on a government branch or the council to lessen the stress of the workload. "
I threw my self at Marcus first while babbling how cool he looked while flying and how proud I was of him.
" know that If you have any problems and you cant talk to a prefect or head of house my door is always open." Miss Sprout continued with a warm smile.
Anyway as I was saying,  it doesn't exactly endear our team to the school when they are flat out cheating to win the games!
Nefertani: it a deeply delicate matter so do you mind if I put up some spells so no one could listen in?
I ran up the stairs to our rooms, and when I turned  the corner  I bumped into someone and fell on my tush.
I opened the door and closed it behind me and saw Sirius sitting up in the hospital bed with Remus smiling wanly next to him in a chair.
Tata sighed and got off the couch and after making sure everyone had everything shrunken in their pockets except for our familiars and wands we shadow travelled to 9 3/4 . As soon as we arrived I looked for my mates and their families and we Happened across the Malfoy's first. I threw myself at Draco and clung to him like a Koala.
As I said this I let my hair down and feeling hot I shortened it until it was to my scalp and made the color white .(kinda like Bakugo's hair)
Right when his breathing  returned to normal the door flew open  a second time ,my tata,Sirius, Remus,and Dumbledore came rushing  In looking for a threat wands in hand.
Nefertani: 9:40  I'm going to go get the kids and go to the guest dinning room to meet up with the Longbottoms until they return home..the Aurors were there all night and day so everything should be fixed .. mainly
I walked down the hospital hallway that smelled like lemon cleaner in the direction the Secretary pointed Me into. I stopped in front of room 104 and knocked
I stuck my tongue out at him as they headed to the showers , giving Adrian the same treatment as Marcus  with some kisses on the cheek since he wasn't a jerk like somebody else.
When I introduced  my new mates the only ones that showed hesitation were Draco,Theo  Tomas and Severus.
Lucius turned away muttering about cancelling a betrothal while the rest of us sat and continued to talk on the couch.
The mates that accompanied me to the game were Draco,Blaise, Neville, Terry,Theo,Cedric, Dean,Seamus and Sirius the man child I adored to death.
When we finally finished,  everyone's attention was on us as a rampant applause broke out from the audience.
Nefertani: then some of them would know how strong and beautiful you are and to send a message ahead of arrival like they were supposed to!
"I am so proud of you." I said after I gave him one last wet smooch that he wiped off and then I released Neville.
And then started working on making the feather float. Blaise got it just seconds  behind Terry, and I and Draco followed them .
We walked into the throne room and sat on our thrones hers was silver sitting left of mine and mine was gold.
After a hour Alice left with Neville after he had tired himself out with Harry with a gleeful goodbye and a promise to be back tomorrow . Harry was dozing lightly to sleep in Sirius's arms
Pansy excused him briefly to get him and her a drink while she took Goyle up on his offer of a dance, and Malfoy stared even harder as Harry gave her away “to anyone but Draco”. Harry had nearly sprinted off to get himself some of the punch. As he was tipping some into a glass, someone bumped into his back.
He had picked his robes up off the floor that night and hung them back in his closet. The next morning, Draco was back in his robes and had chocolate icing
Sirius smiles at him comfortingly. “No worries, kiddo. Would you like some breakfast? Moony’s made pancakes.”
Opposite Hermione and Millicent a seat down from Harry's sat one Pansy Parkinson. No sign of her cohorts like Tracy and or her obsession like Malfoy were present. The girl’s pug nose was firmly placed in the open Charms book in front of her, but every time Hermione so much as sighed or shifted in her chair Pansy’s eyes would shoot up to track her movements.
Harry took him back to his apartment after he had been checked over and cleared by the healers. It was the first time that he had touched Draco since the incident, but Draco was too numb to mind. Harry didn’t tell him that he loved him now, he only helped him out of his bloody clothes, and made sure that the healers left. He helped Draco get his sore body into a shower, and he turned on the hot water.
“Everyone in school is talking about it,” said a blonde male second year, Harry thought might have been Greg’s charge.
And at once, thin ink lines began to spread like a spider’s web from the point that George’s wand had touched. They joined each other, they crisscrossed, they fanned into every corner of the parchment; then words began to blossom across the top, great, curly green words, that proclaimed.
Harry had promised both Millicent and Hermione that he would not stay out late at night and that he wouldn’t walk the halls alone, but tonight, Harry was feeling restless.
“THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED!” roared Black. “DIED RATHER THAN BETRAY YOUR FRIENDS, AS WE WOULD AVE DONE FOR YOU!”
Harry flicked the doors open with his wand, but was met with utter darkness. He could just make out the shapes of the seats and lockers, but he didn’t see Malfoy or anyone else. And the room was getting colder.
“You thought wrong, Potter. They took everything. It’s why I never even contemplated quitting auror training after the war. I…we needed the…”
Last one, I wanted to give you guys a soft ending so I hope you like it. The next book is going to get really dark though so put your seat belts on. Thanks for sticking with me.
Most of the notices were the same, until Dumbledore said, “It is also my painful duty to inform you that the Inter-House Quidditch Cup will not take place this year.”
Harry gave Hermione a look that said he would tell her everything later before he and Malfoy walked back to the dormitory together. Draco gave the password, nearly scampering when he heard the familiar movement of bricks. Harry walked quickly to the dormitory. He needed a shower, and the comfort of his bed.
“This isn’t about inducting anyone into this Order, but it is about what Harry needs to know to be prepared, if anything.”
“I’ve found him,” he whispered. “I’ve found Flamel. I told you I’d read that name somewhere before. I read it on the train to Hogwarts. Listed: Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel.”
“The residing teacher doles out the punishment Mr. Potter, or the reward, and since Madam Hooch was your teacher at the moment neither, Professor Snape or I, have a say. Though I’m not sure you’ll be getting away
“My mother told me that it was simply the way things were done. I spent every day of that break out there where Mrs. Tizzy’s grave was trying to apologize to her, wanting to be near her, then when my mother told me that I couldn’t do that anymore. I went to the library and went through the books. There had to be some way to bring her back, something that I could do for the one that had done everything for me since I was an infant.”
“Cass? Cass! Please….what happened? What happened?!” he asked Harry. But all Harry could say was. “He’s back. He’s back.”
“I never knew,” said Harry. McGonagall’s gaze softened slightly. Madam Hooch entered the room. Neville? Harry wanted to ask, but she beat him to it. “Longbottom will be fine. He might have to stay a few days, but he
When Harry entered the Great Hall the next morning, he looked anxiously up at the head table and spotted Snape staring down at him in barely concealed fury. No one else seemed to be paying him any mind. Warrington was sitting at the Slytherin table eating his breakfast. His friend chatting amicably with others as Warrington ate his porridge. Someone bumped into his shoulder as he moved out of the entrance, but as he turned to threaten Malfoy, he was shocked to see that it wasn’t him. It was Ron.
you know. Looked like he hadn’t ever slept rough in his life. One of the old lot followed him home one night. Bloke lives in this massive place in the middle of London, and yet, said he was doing it all for the money. No one who lives in a place like that is hurting for galleons, are they?”
The only one left of Molly’s brood sans partner was Harry and Draco surely wasn’t going to announce that she was batting a perfect game. Draco rationalized it was good for the nosy woman anyway, maybe she’d get a refund on that soul after all.
“You know I couldn’t do that,” said Wood resignedly. “And besides you just want an easier team to beat for the Cup.”
“Yeah, well neither did I. Mrs. Tizzy was my nurse elf. That’s what she was taught to do and that’s what my parents had always had her for. She was getting old, but she could still do her duties. She still rocked me as a baby, and fed me. She was the one that was there when I learned how to walk, and who bandaged my hands when my tutors got a little rough with me. She was the one who took care of me when I was sick and who brushed my hair. She was the one who held me when I cried, and told me that I was beautiful no matter what my mother said. She told me that my nose was perfect and that I was good and kind, though I knew even then that none of those things were true.
“Dobby has traveled the country for two whole years, sir, trying to find work! But Dobby hasn’t found work, sir, because Dobby wants paying now!”
Dumbledore tried to move between them, but Mrs. Weasley side stepped him, pulling Harry into her arms. Harry felt himself start to cry. He hadn’t been able to touch his own mother, but Mrs. Weasley’s comfortable arms surrounding him, her hand in his hair was real and strong and clearly not an echo of anything but love.
Harry had been looking forward to the game, but now it seemed as if it was just going to be another lesson. Everytime he felt a chill Harry shuddered involuntarily. The sky was getting so dark it looked as if it were filled with dementors, cloak to cloak ready to watch the match like everyone else.
Harry noticed all of the small moments in school that almost made Malfoy redeemable. He noticed when Malfoy helped the younger years with their potions or spell work in the library. Sure, Malfoy had acted all put out and pressed upon, but Harry noticed the way his eyes lit up anytime someone turned to him for advice. At the time, Harry just assumed that it was Malfoy’s arrogance that made him react that way, but looking back it was likely the fallout from being Lucius Malfoy’s son.
Seamus gave Dean a bright smile in return, looking at his best friend like he was a member of his beloved Ireland’s team.
Millicent led the game, and they slowly began to move across the board. Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a buddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Millicent
“Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she said finally. “I don’t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it’s too well protected.”
Moody’s hand fell into the cauldron. Harry’s screams filling the graveyard. Then he was in front of him. “Blood of the enemy forcibly taken, you will resurrect your foe.”
Flint turned his back on Harry, like he thought he would reveal too much if Harry could see his face.
“Sit down,” he snapped at Hermione. Snape rattled off the correct answers, Hermione the only one writing down his every word until Snape snapped at the rest of the class to do the same.
Charlie’s friends were a cheery lot. They showed the group of them some the harness they had rigged, and when they were ready to leave they shook hands with the others and thanked them very much. They watched Norbert fly
“Mr. Moony presents his compliments to Professor Snape and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other people’s business.”
“Er…as a matter of fact, I’ve no idea where he is,” said Bagman. “He’s sort of….stopped coming to work. Been absent for a
Snape glowered, eyeing Harry with all the hate he had the first time he had ever saw him that first year. Then left Harry to his perfected ingredients.
“Hello, my name is Professor Snape, and I am your head of house. You have just joined the house of the cunning. While you are here, your house is your family.”
Harry bristled a little at the word “let”, but one look at Remus assured Harry that the two had already had a very long conversation about this already and that if Harry objected even a little that Remus was likely to allow Sirius to bundle him up back in Grimmauld Place and force feed him tea and sweets until he was too big to be removed from the premises.
“Catch it if you can, then!” he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.
The school gathered themselves together in the Great Hall. And prepared to receive the other schools. Dumbledore moved to the podium and in a grand voice announced, “Beauxbatons.”
He led Harry, Ron, and Hermione through the crowd and back into the campsite. All was quiet now; there was no sign of the masked wizards, though several ruined tents were still smoking.
People were running everywhere as Bill, Charlie, and Percy took off with Mr. Weasley in the direction the ministry officials were gathering against the threat.
“I’m dying!” Malfoy yelled as the class panicked. “I’m dying, look at me! It’s killed me!” Hagrid lifted Malfoy and carried him up the slope toward the castle.
Millicent had something on her mind. They were in the library, reading anything that could possibly help them with the last task. Hermione and Ron had a copy of Tournament Tricks: The Ultimate Cheaters Guide to the Triwizard Tournament open in front of them seeing if they could decipher any news about the grand and final task.
And Draco, of course, but he had gotten him when he was eleven too. It didn’t matter if he had only counted him as a friend after they had started working together or not. Harry had Draco as his favorite nemesis since they were children. Voldemort had nothing on the enemy scale against a prepubescent Malfoy.
“No,” Harry said, “Because my father landed on the other side. My father fought against Voldemort. That’s what he’s saying when I hear him. He’s telling my mother to run, to save us, that he’ll hold him off. Then, my mum, she begs for our lives.”
It was such a simple gesture, such a Harry one, as if Harry had just given Draco all the reassurance he needed by closing his eyes. Harry wouldn’t look because he said he wouldn’t. That was it.
“Come on now, run, run!” Harry yelled at Hermione, but that only succeeded in turning the troll towards Millicent. The troll was so close to her that she was backed against the wall, her mouth open with terror. All the screaming was making the troll go berserk.
“It’s an invisibility cloak,” said Blaise, a look of awe on his face. “Well, don’t just hold it Potter, put it on.”
“Mr. Padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professor.”
And with that, she took her “sweater” out of Ron’s hands where he had been examining it, turned her back on a stunned Blaise Zabini, and walked away to get herself some food.
Harry was in the library intent on getting his Potion’s essay done before next class. Snape never did like to take points from Slytherin, but the man did seem to take a sick pleasure in taking points from Harry and making him even more of a social pariah. Hermione and Millicent sat in front of him. Millicent was dutifully copying some source information for a Herbology essay while keeping her face perfectly stoic. Hermione, on the other hand, was having more difficulty keeping focused.
“No,” Hermione said a little too quickly before adding, “She looked at me like that before the ball, too. Like I’m personally offending her or something.”
The other girls from Beauxbatons looked quite disappointed. In fact two girls who had not been selected had dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their arms. Then the Hogwarts champion.
Harry saw everything like it was a dream. Hundreds of faces stared down at him from the stands. Then there was the Horntail. She stood at the other end of the enclosure crouched low over her eggs, her wings half furled, her eyes watching Harry’s every move. Its spiked tail thrashed leaving yard-long gouge marks in the hard ground. Harry didn’t want to be one of those spikes.
“And I broke your door down after I left, but you were gone. I searched all over that night, but couldn’t find you. Then I went to the Ministry to try and file proceedings.”
He had said it more in frustration than he had anything, but the dragon’s head whipped around toward her eggs as if she could….understand him.
Harry felt elated as he watched the stag bound across the lake and scatter the dementors as easily as wiping crumbs from a table.
“Feeling a little on edge, Malfoy?” asked Millicent. “Maybe you need some tea, I could make a few suggestions.”
“Hey, Millie,” Gregory Goyle replied while Vincent nodded at her, clearly not pleased with her choice of company in Ron and Harry. Malfoy then turned to Harry.
“No,” said Davis, immediately denying the claims of Crabbe getting anywhere near her or her internal organs.
Ron was staring over Harry’s shoulder. Harry wheeled around. With a snap, the man in the shadows closed the door behind them. A mass of filthy, matted hair hung to his elbows. If his eyes hadn’t been shining out of the deep, dark sockets, he might have been a corpse. The waxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face, it looked like a skull. His yellow teeth were bared in a grin. It was Sirius Black.
That night at dinner, Ron was all aflutter about what had happened in their defense class. Hermione seemed less pleased.
Thank you all for reading and commenting. I do not own Harry Potter, and this is unbeta'd. I am merely a girl with a dream, and a computer, and several intense ongoing delusions. One of those being that JK Rowling will read this fanfiction and have an intense desire to hear my idea.
Dumbledore took out his wand and with a great sweeping wave most of the candles in the Great Hall were extinguished. Everyone watched the goblet, waiting.
After chatting with Hagrid, Hermione found them and escorted them to the library. Harry knew Hagrid would be tight lipped at the subject of Nicholas Flamel. He wasn’t in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Times, he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry.
“Sirius,” Remus said, his voice reverent. His eyes washed over Sirius’ face as Sirius’ studied him in the same manner.
“That Mr. Flint is excellent advise,” said Snape cooly, like Harry hadn’t almost died on his office floor.
“Did you ever think, Harry, that perhaps what you’re looking for is right in front of your face? And that you’re just so damaged,” Octavian had nearly screamed the word. “That you can’t see that your mate is right there and has always been right there!”
The rat was squealing wildly, but not loudly enough to cover up the sounds drifting from Hagrid’s garden. There was a jumble of indistinct male voices, a silence, and then, without warning, the unmistakable swish and thud of an axe.
Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right too think she wasn’t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, there was no doubt she was serious when she said that anyone messing around in her class would have to leave and would not come back.
With one more kick, Harry was able to free himself, but when he took a step, he slipped on the wet floor and promptly knocked himself out.
The troll stopped at a doorway before slowly moving into the room. Harry was going to lock it in, but as he reached the door he heard something that made his heart stop—a pair of high pitched screams coming from the room the troll had just walked into.
“Because the weathers shite, better to let Gryffindor handle the Hufflepuffs, if they can, then for us to get out into this muck. And besides, I’m worried Malfoy here, isn’t one hundred percent yet.”
“Get out of the way, Potter, you’re in enough trouble as it is. If I hadn’t been here to save your skin.”
Harry nodded at the man who had tried to kill him only three months ago in a silver mask. Harry nodded at the man who was his roommate’s father. Harry nodded at the man who had just saved him.
Harry nodded. He had seen the influx of different wizards. He had heard a group of kids their age speaking French not a few moments ago.
“Weren’t you guys going to live together, make a life? That’s what Cassius said in the maze.” Ely laughed again.
“Yeah,” said Malfoy, putting on a brave sort of grimace. But Harry saw him wink at Crabbe and Goyle when Pansy looked away. They hadn’t fired Hagrid, but Harry had went to see him nonetheless. He knew that Malfoy was faking it and he tried to assure Hagrid of the same thing, but Harry knew that the event had shaken Hagrid’s confidence.
Wait... he still had his cloak on. While Malfoy and Co. started to mock Ron, Harry snuck behind the trio, and pointed his wand into the woods behind them.
“Isn’t practice over now, Wood, or did you think you were going to infringe upon our practice time, again?”
“It’s okay,” Professor Lupin said. “You don’t have to worry about the essay, but,” he said looking at Malfoy. “If you have already done it, I will count it to you as extra credit.”
“Rule one in sentient magical objects, Mr. Potter, they are rarely able to destroyed so easily. This mirror will fight for its life against you, even if that means soaking your energy to stay beside it forever.”
Last year, Blaise had come to Harry asking for his help in dealing with a rather overzealous Ravenclaw. But in that instance, it couldn’t have been helped. After Blaise broke it off with the Ravenclaw she then turned on him with several quite painful stinging hexes. Harry had thrown his invisibility cloak over the two of them and took off towards the dungeons.
“It’s the Dark Mark, Harry!” Hermione moaned, pulling him as hard as she could. “You-Know-Who’s sign!”
“All right, Seamus?” Harry asked when it was clear the boy would pace all day without some sort of interference.
Then Harry turned and left the grieving parents in the hall. He had his own family to be getting back to.
Draco was thrown against the wall by a stupefy sent by one of Basks higher ups. Aurors stormed the room from all sides. Spells were cast left and right, and Draco had to yank the arm of the purple haired girl to get her out of the way before she was hit by one of the stray killing curses Basks was throwing like confetti at a parade.
Draco adjusted his auror robes self consciously before he heard Harry calling for him. Draco turned back only to find that the man had gone.
Draco couldn’t take him. Harry spent more time in the gym than Draco ever has so physically kicking him out wasn’t an option, but he could leave him there.
Harry apparated instantly. He followed the burn that stretched from his mark to his heart, and he knew that something was wrong. He could feel that Draco was near. He burst open the front door, not caring who was inside. He needed to get there. Draco needed him, and he didn’t care if the other man loved him back or if he would ever accept this thing between them because his mate needed him, and he would not fail him again. He reached a door, and could hear voices inside.
“What are you saying boy?” mocked Voldemort. “Begging for the little spunk? Don’t worry,” laughed Voldemort. “You’ll get to see him again. Maybe you’ll even be the one to slit the little half blood’s throat.”
Black stopped struggling though his hollowed eyes stayed fixed on Scabbers, who was clamped tightly in Ron’s scratched hands.
“Umbridge, again?” Ron guessed, leaning over to kiss Hermione on the cheek. She leaned into him slightly, and Harry was glad to see that the two were still going strong. Still,
Harry decided to shake off the incident. There wasn’t any situation in which he could be the boy who cried “mermaid” as well as the boy who cried “voldemort”. Besides, being attacked by a merperson didn’t come close to some of the things that Harry had been through before. It must have just taken a wrong turn down a drain pipe. It wouldn’t be the first time that a creature roamed the Hogwarts pipes.
“Sure,” Harry said. “And I’m sure you didn’t make her wear a dirty bedsheet or some other thing with no shoes. And I’m sure that she had a room as big as yours and that you let her eat at your table.”
“We’re too late,” said the witch in the woolen dressing gown, shaking her head. “They’ll have Disapparated.”
“Happy Christmas, Potter,” said Blaise sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.
Stunned and frightened, every face in the Hall was turned toward Dumbledore now. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle sat ashen faced, but attentive to Dumbledore’s words.
The three other champions stood by the fire. They looked impressive and he felt out of place. Krum, hunched-up and brooding, was leaning against the mantelpiece, slightly apart from the other two. Warrington was standing with his hands behind his back, staring out into the room as if he couldn’t relax for a moment. Fleur Delacour looked around when Harry walked in and threw back her sheet of long, silvery hair.
“Harry, your father was a very brave man and yes, Sirius was our friend, but sometimes people change.”
Flint reached into the crate and took out the last ball. It was tiny, maybe the size of large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.
And before Pansy could say anything cutting to Hermione, Professor McGonagall ushered Ron and Hermione into the Great Hall.
Coming straight from breakfast, the three of them were a little early for class, but the others in his year were quickly filing in. Pansy had finally managed to organize her belongings while Malfoy seemed to be in a playful mood. He had folded a rather impressive paper bird, and was now enchanting it to fly around the room.
“Draco,” Harry had said, his voice broken, while Weasley had jumped to his fiancés defense, ready to pummel Draco into the woodwork of the bar. And Draco had fled. Harry didn’t follow.
It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oy ube cafru oyt on wohsi. Harry moved closer to the mirror, forgetting Filch and Snape. He stepped in front of it, but couldn’t see his reflection.
The school might have had two Slytherin champions but apparently he had been deemed the lesser evil.
“It seems we have had a change in decoration,” said Dumbledore. “However, recent events must be taken into account.”
But the classroom and the dementor were dissolving….Harry was falling again through thick white fog, and his mother’s voice was louder than ever, echoing inside his head….”Not Harry! Not Harry! Please, I’ll do anything….”
Harry bounded out of the room, and Draco smiled at the ceiling. There might not be much space in his apartment, but Draco hoped that they wouldn’t need much more space than his tiny bed. Even if they did, and Draco felt Harry’s eyes on him from where he stood in the hallway, they would make it work. His clothes would look better on the floor anyway.
“Students, I repeat, there is no threat. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is not back amongst us.” She turned and walked back down the aisle toward Harry. “He is no more than a ghost story and a stain on our history. You must have faith in the Ministry.”
“It sure is,” said George who stood solemnly by his brother’s side as he had appeared out of nowhere. Fred spared his brother a grateful look. The twins were back together again. That message was sent out to the Great Hall and everyone in it.
The proof was always right in front of them, in front of all of them, but no one seemed to make the connection. Maybe it was as far fetched for them as it was to Draco, that the savior of the Wizarding World could ever find his match in a former death eater.
Luna paused where she was before adding more red to Ginny Weasley’s hair. “I suppose,” she agreed. “Quite different than the real thing, huh?”
“I guess we’re just naturals,” said Harry, smiling down at his beloved Goddaughter. And while Ron and Hermione had seemed to take Harry’s words at their own value, and Draco made a quick joke to move past the moment, he didn’t miss the look on Octavian’s face. He had successfully kept their connection hidden for years, and now, it seemed, one child had changed everything, because Octavian Tyler knew.
Millicent and Flint had dragged him into the room. It was getting to the point that Harry couldn't breathe.
“Need something else skinned, Draco?” Harry asked, not looking up. Malfoy laughed, getting Harry’s attention, his eyes were shining malevolently, and they were fixed on Harry. He leaned across the table.
“I love you!” Harry shouted. “I love you so much that I can hardly stand it. I always have and I am so, so sorry.”
Lupin reluctantly looked to Hermione, Black kept on looking at Lupin. Hermione had raised herself off the floor and was pointing at Lupin, wide-eyed. “You….You….”
Harry rummaged once more in his trunk, extracted his money then boarded the bus. Oddly, there were no seats on the bus, but a half dozen brass beds stood beside curtained windows. Candles were burning in brackets by each bed. In one bed, a sleeping wizard was hissing and talking in his sleep. Harry took a bed close to the driver.
But apart from that, I was happier than I’ve ever been. For the first time in my life, I had friends, three great friends, Sirius Black, Peter Pettigrew, and your father Harry, James Potter. They found me out, but they didn’t desert me. Instead, they did something for me that would make my transformations not only bearable, but the best times of my life. They became Animagi.”
“No of course not,” Lupin said, moving around the classroom trying to pack everything up so he could get out of there and away from Harry.
As Harry stepped down out of the carriage he saw Draco walking with Neville, but didn’t have time to think about how weird that was before Ron was herding him toward the castle with his frightened mother hen look.
“Anything particular on your mind, there Millicent?” asked Blaise, who was pretending to do his Herbology assignment.
You would think so, Harry thought. Ely seemed to be the one who did most of the talking. It was a bit like being around all of the Weasley’s at once. In the beginning when Harry had first met them and was still a little shy, he never had to say a word unless he didn’t want to. They filled in the conversation brilliantly without him. It had been comforting, and he wondered if Warrington felt that way around Ely?
It was only the next day in Defense while Ron and Harry were discussing what they would do if they had a stone like that when Harry remembered the upcoming match. He may not be playing yet, but that didn’t mean
Harry patted him on the shoulder. It was too late now. Harry, Millicent and Ron headed down the train, until they found a compartment with only one occupant. The Hogwarts Express was usually reserved for students and they had never seen an adult there before, except for the witch who worked the trolley.
“Promise me, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, talking more quickly still, “that whatever happens that you won’t go looking for…”
Harry applauded wildly, a fair number of the other students doing the same, particularly at the Gryffindor table. Harry’s own table even had a few who seemed quite happy.
Harry’s second year was a tiny, dark haired boy named George Winsome. His file had him down as a half-blood from a well-off family that apparently had apparently had a decently well off chain of apothecaries in France and Germany. Snape was probably salivating over the ingredients he could get from the connections this kid could provide.
Harry considered running in the confusion, but his injured leg stopped that consideration. Voldemort quickly stepped between the two men, casting a barrier between them.
The day only got worse when he received a letter from Hagrid. Buckbeak was being put on trial for what had happened with Malfoy, and from what Hermione could dig up, it didn’t seem as if he had the best chances.
“So he thinks Durmstrang would have suited him, does he?” she said angrily. “I wish he had gone, then we wouldn’t have to put up with him.”
The Firebolt was a dream, turning brilliantly and going faster than Harry has ever flown before. That’s how he knew he was going to get it. Harry flew straight toward the Snitch, but with Seamus right on his heels, the other boy caught sight of it when Harry did. Then it was just a race. Harry zoomed at the little golden ball not caring who or what was in his way, when he caught sight of Flint staring not into the crowd like Harry had assumed but at a stunned looking Oliver Wood who looked as if his whole world was crashing down around him as Harry was leading Seamus to the snitch. There was no way that Seamus would get it before him and Wood looked like he knew that. Then Flint’s face, too, fell.
He heard Crabbe and Goyle’s lumbering steps before he heard Malfoy’s nasally voice. Stepping out into the hall in front of them with a swirl of robes that would have made Snape jealous.
“I wouldn’t say they like it. But that’s the way things are Granger and it’s ridiculous to think that you might be able to change centuries of a societal construct with a pair of mittens.”
“Yes,” exclaimed Millicent. “and seeing as I am still tag the peacock champion, I will have to agree with that.”
“Mr. Potter, you will see me tonight for detention.” Then she leaned in, close enough that he could feel her breath on his cheek.
“We’ve been having a little chat, Peter, about what happened the night Lily and James died. You might have missed the finer points while you were squeaking around down there on the bed….”
“Absolutely not,” Harry replied. Favors in Slytherin were handed out with more care and consideration than most did their homework. Favors with no strings attached were unheard of.
“Don’t mind him, Ron,” said Hermione, seizing Ron’s arm to restrain him as he took a step toward Draco.
“As you wish, Unhonourable Disgrace to the name of Black,” Kreature murmured again to a Sirius who was looking anywhere but at the elf.
Remus made a grab for Sirius’ arm. “What else were we going to do?” he asked. “We didn’t know that he would do this. I mean, challenging our custody?”
Harry shivered and looked up and down Magnolia Crescent. What was going to happen now? Expulsion? Could he be arrested and kicked out of the wizarding world? Harry was laying out a rather detailed contingency plan when he felt someone or something watching him.
He’d have to send her a thank you note. He’d send it out when he saw Hedwig at breakfast. Next was a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione. He’d hope she liked what he had sent her.
“I thought you’d come and help your friend,” he said hoarsely. “Very brave of you, your father would have done the same for me.”
“Happy?” he asks, but of course Draco’s not happy. The sleeveless shirt Harry has on is showing way too much skin for Draco’s liking and he’s being an ass.
After, he would move departments. The Unspeakables had been tagging him for months. It would mean giving up a job he loved, but since being an auror was no longer a possibility, he had to do something. Being an Unspeakable might not be as much fun as being an auror, but at least it would be interesting. Draco looked down at the first sheet. Anonymity was paramount at places like this so they didn’t ask for any identifying information beyond gender. Draco moved to the next question.
“Hagrid,” said Harry. “You know everything that goes around here. Dumbledore trusts you, we just want to know who else was tasked with guarding the Stone so we’re sure it’s in good hands.”
Harry was deaf to it though as he thought about how much Snape hated him. It wasn’t enough what Harry had gone through to save the Stone, but to make sure that everyone else hadn’t hoisted Harry onto a platform Snape was willing to lose the House Cup when they already had it in the bag. He had to make sure that Harry knew what his place was, and now, everyone else would blame him for the loss.
“The imperious curse can be fought, and I’ll be teaching you how, but it takes real power, and not everyone has the stuff necessary. Better avoid being hit with it in the first place. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!” he barked, and everyone jumped.
“No,” the girl interrupted. “Malfoy said that Potter is under his families supervision, and that everyone is to stay out of his way. I took that to mean that we aren’t to discuss him either.”
“Those were quite brilliant,” said Pansy, changing the subject. “Pity we haven’t had a chance to have a ball as of late.”
“Why don’t you trust me?” he asked. “I’ve never pressured you into showing me your mark, but to think that you feel so low about your place in my life…” He stopped, face red and nearly out of breath after his ranting. “You’ve met my family for goodness sake. Sometimes I honestly think they like you more than me. Hermione and Ron call and the first thing they ask is how you’re doing.”
Harry took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms and sprinted toward the other door Hermione and Millicent following him, but the door wouldn’t budge, even with Hermione’s “Alohormora.”
“I knew I’d get you for something, Potter,” said Snape. “Out after curfew, and I would bet that this isn’t the first time.”
“I heard my dad,” Harry felt like he couldn’t breathe. “That’s the first time I’ve ever heard him, that I’ve ever heard his voice….he tried to take on Voldemort himself, to give my mum time to run for it….”
Stan put the paper away reluctantly, and Harry leaned against the window of the Knight Bus, feeling worse than ever. He couldn’t imagine what Stan would be telling future passengers about him in the future.
Harry felt his partner’s strong hands on his shoulders then down his arms and the front of his chest then lower. And just as Harry was about to make a decision. Sirius bumped into his side, his mask tilted up on his forehead as he swallowed back a glass of champagne.
I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.
Harry suddenly realized that there were tears on his face mingling with the sweat. He bent his face as low as possible, wiping them off on his robes, pretending to do up his shoelace, so that Lupin wouldn’t see.
“I heard,” said Tracey Davis. “that he makes the seventh year students take a time specific poison for their NEWTS, and if they can’t brew the antidote in an hour they turn into flobberworms, so at least Professor Snape can get some sort of use out of them.”
“Yeah, you saw his leg,” said Hermione. “It nearly ripped his leg off, he’s not going to try it again in a hurry.
They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It had to be something really horrible or else Filch wouldn’t sound so excited. But, he was leading them towards Hagrid’s hut.
Short but sweet. Wolfstar parents coming up for the next book. I'm happy that you guys have been so involved in this story. Love you :) Harry finally gets a real home.
“I suggest you stop reading Skeeter’s swill, Minister. There’s only so many brain cells you can sacrifice,” said Sirius. Fudge snarled.
The first person Harry sought after he left Moody was Hermione. She was sitting in the library at a table covered in books and parchment. Millicent was at her side filing a nail with an enchanted file while flipping through one of Flitwick’s newly assigned texts.
The witch pulled a pair of heavy black spectacles from her pocket as Ron placed Scabbers on the counter.
Instead, he dreams about Ely chatting in the halls to a group of people, Warrington lying dead at his feet. No one notices the large boy splayed on the stone floor of Hogwart’s hall.
to be getting back to Slytherin table anyway. Blaise had been trying and failing not to eye him for the past few minutes.
The villa was truly something to behold. Throughout their travels this summer, Harry, Remus, and Sirius had stayed in some pretty lavish places, but this topped them all.
Harry and Warrington, tied for first place, would be released into the maze first, followed by the others. Bagman was ready with the whistle.
Turns out by the time Defense came around the rain had dulled to a steady drizzle. Tracey Davis had her hood pulled up over her hair and bunched together toward her miserable looking face.
No one had bothered him about the articles in the Prophet in the common room, but that might have to do with Snape’s long time ban of the rag from his domain. If it was factual or academic, Snape didn’t want to see it. It was one of the few rules that the man laid out every year, and no one seemed inclined to test their head of house’s patience even if it meant possibly getting one over on the Harry Potter.
“Yeah,” said Pansy. “She hated Draco though. She always called him an underbelly brat. I told her not to call him that, that I was going to marry him one day, but then she just called me Mrs. Brat. But I didn’t mind. She’s still the only person who has ever been able to talk to me like that.”
“Accio!” Harry yelled, pointing his wand at the Triwizard Cup. He felt the jerk behind his navel as soon as the cup touched his hand. Voldemort’s scream of fury followed Harry out of the graveyard. They were going back.
“You aren’t going to see your nephew til next summer,” Remus said, voice cold. “Surely you’ll say goodbye to him.”
Then a pain like he’d never felt before pierced his head, as though his scar was on fire. He stumbled back, blinded. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure.
“Why did you tell her you live in Bellamy Street? They need to know where to send the potions for your burns?” Harry asked, scolding Draco with his eyes.
“Tea from the shores of New Zealand. Completely over priced, but something I thought would do Malfoy a load of good.”
Harry stood facing the mirror, watching as his mother stroked his hair and his father smiled down at him.
Harry started at a noise from the Gryffindor table. One of the ghosts was removing, no, almost removing his head before replacing it to the horror of some of the students and the entertainment for some of the old ones.
“Oh, no, you don’t!” Sirius said, busting into the room. Remus straight on his heels. Sirius raised his wand threateningly towards Harry. “You will sit down, young man, or I will make you sit down. You are not leaving this room, until those cowards are sought and hung up by their dangly bits.”
But Professor Trewlaney didn’t seem to hear him. Her eyes started to roll. Harry stood there in a panic. She looked as though she were about to have some sort of a seizure before she spoke again.
When Harry awoke, he couldn’t tell you if it had been one minute or one hour. He reached for his wand then turned toward the water. It was empty. The bath had been completely emptied of water. There were no blood splatters on the floor or anywhere in the tub. The merperson was gone, and when Harry looked at the cut on his leg, there was nothing there.
If you want to read something amazing. I would suggest starting with "The Child of Azkaban" by LonelyHarvest. I was literally blown away by this one, and the imagery this person conjured lives rent free in my head.
Draco braced himself and opened the door begrudgingly. And before Draco could turn her away, Hermione shoved his goddaughter in his arms. The little bundle and only red head he could stand cooed and reached for him.
He was already heading to the ground when a sharp pain erupted in the center of his forehead. The broom started to fall as Harry lost contact with it in favor of keeping his skull in one piece. He forced himself to place one hand back on the broom as images that normally only haunted him at night filled his head. Voldemort’s voice angry and insistent pounded loudly in his head. The pain then the pleased feeling he then experienced turned Harry’s stomach. The pleased feeling was worse than the anger, but Harry couldn’t seem to care too much as his scar ached intolerably.
“Pleasure,” uttered Sirius, bowing low, the Black in him responding appropriately to the social situation at hand.
“No,” said Seamus too quickly. “Not nervous at all. It’s just Wood is very, very keen on winning today, and Ron and that darn cat have kept me up all night. Around four a.m. I was willing to sacrifice the rat myself, but Ron kept having to get up to block the door which meant we all had to keep getting up.”
“Yeah, I bet it was,” said Ron suddenly. “Dad, we met Draco Malfoy in the woods, and he as good as told us his dad was one of those nutters in masks. And we all know the Malfoys were right in with You-Know-Who!”
Sirius bustled into the room, an apron tied around his waist. “And then, we will invite the Weasley’s over, and we will have a celebratory Screw the Ministry Party.”
But the table had quieted when Malfoy cleared his throat. Malfoy, of course, had been chosen prefect as well as Pansy, who had been in and out of the compartment performing her duties the entire train ride. And in an unusual change of event, Harry hadn’t seen Malfoy, Crabbe, or Goyle once. Harry wasn’t sure what he expected. Wands drawn. Words spoken. Something. Instead, the terrible trio had never even looked at him. Not once throughout the whole dinner.
“And I’m sure you’re going to go down in flames your first task,” said Malfoy before walking away. Harry wondered what the git’s problem was. He couldn’t be that annoyed that Harry had turned down his rather obnoxious brand of helpfulness once again. “And Chang, count yourself as lucky there’s no Quidditch this year. Though I wouldn’t let that stop you from getting out there. You really do need the practice!” he shouted after the dark haired girl.
Thank you guys for reading. We are rapping up with this part of Slytherin Harry. I'm posting the last sections right now. I hope you guys like it. If something wasn't resolved just wait until Order of the Phoenix, we are going to get there.
“If he weren’t when he went to Azkaban, he will be now,” said Ern in his slow voice. “I’d blow meself up before I set foot in that place. Serves him right, mind you…after what he did…”
“It’s a revolution,” Millicent said, nudging Hermione’s side. Dobby then explained how they got to Hogwarts and what Professor Dumbledore had offered them but, “Dobby beat him down miss…Dobby likes freedom, miss, but he isn’t wanting too much, miss, he likes work better.”
The light from the fire framed the man lighting him like an angel on top of a Christmas tree. Harry nearly laughed, but the look on the man’s face stopped him.
Harry clambered to the side of the field. He wouldn’t be on a broom, but he had a school one at his side just in case he needed to fly up to deliver something to a waiting player.
Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because as soon as his head hit the pillow he was closing his eyes. He was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to him, announcing to the Great Hall that he was in Slytherin instead of the Sorting Hat.
“STUPEFY!” roared twenty voices….there was a blinding series of flashes and Harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind had swept the clearing. “STOP!” yelled a voice he recognized. “STOP! That’s my son!”
Draco stared at Harry in shock. Their eyes were locked for the first time in days, and it felt so good to feel seen again, and to feel like it was warranted.
“Stop paying attention to them, Potter, this is serious business,” Draco scolded him. “Now, when we get to the pitch, they’re going to let you talk to the other champions and what not, but don’t get psyched out. This tournament is purely mental.”
“Alas, if only we had,” said Fudge bitterly. “It was not we who found him. It was little Peter Pettigrew, another of Potter’s friends. Maddened by grief, no doubt, and knowing that Black had been the Secret-Keeper, he went after Black himself.”
A long silence followed Hagrid’s story. Then Madam Rosmerta said with some satisfaction, “But he didn’t manage to disappear did he? The Ministry of Magic caught up with him next day!”
“Snape?” said Black harshly, taking his eyes off Scabbers for the first time in minutes and looking up at Lupin.
Blaise chuckled under his breath, something that sounded a lot like, “Sure” before Millicent sat beside him, brushing him harshly with her shoulder.
“Scouts,” said Marcus, and Harry wondered if his brain was short circuiting or if all his brain activity was just focused elsewhere at the moment.
“And it hasn’t been seen for thirteen years,” said Mr. Weasley quietly. “Of course people panicked…it was almost like seeing You-Know-Who back again.”
Crouch had been kept under lock and key by his father. Imperioused and under an invisibility cloak at all hours until he heard something, felt something. Harry knew that something was Voldemort calling to him.
“Blaise is encouraged to make his own decisions. That is why he offered you use of our home after Lucius decided to make a play for you. A rather intelligent play at that.”
Harry moved closer to the Malfoy heir. “Because it’s not fair, and if you’re going to pick on someone it should be someone who’s a match for you.”
It was Uncle Vernon, still purple faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry even existing, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking
“It’s just a joke, Potter,” said the black, haughty boy beside him. “I heard Dumbledore’s always joking like that. He just doesn’t want anyone to interrupt his poker games with Sprout and Flitwick.”
Things had been slightly better after Sirius’ visit with Aunt Petunia, but this was Pivet Drive and Sirius was still on probation. Remus would have went ahead and claimed for rights to care for Harry, but Harry knew that the law restricted Remus’ moves heavily because of his status as a werewolf.
“Fine,” said Flint stopping. “You can tell my father that I would rather do anything, and I mean anything else than to take his spot at the Ministry. I don’t want to be locked away all day in some office, I want to be up there. You can tell him that I’m seventeen, and that I don’t want to be head of the family, that I don’t want a wife, and that after being a prefect that the idea of children makes me feel downright ill.”
“What have you been telling him?” growled Bane. Another pawed at the ground nervously. “I’m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best,” he said in a gloomy voice.
“Draco,” said Hermione, and the more he started to look like himself. Hermione’s bushy hair turning black and his height changing.
He looked so defeated, like he had no more words left to give Draco, but as Draco moved to breach the distance between them he spoke again.
“I don’t want him to be miserable, I just want him to be on guard!” returned Mr. Weasley. “You know what Harry and the boys are like. After everything the last two years. But Harry can’t do things like that this year. When I think what could have happened to him that night he ran away from home! If the Knight Bus hadn’t picked him up, I’m prepared to bet he would have been dead before the Ministry found him.”
When Harry entered the Great Hall the next morning, he was greeted by Draco Malfoy entertaining the rest of the table about the previous night. As he passed by them, Malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a swooning fit and there was a roar of laughter.
Harry turned around—and saw quite clearly what the problem was. For a moment, he was sure he’d walked into a nightmare—this as too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.
When Draco woke it was in spurts. He couldn’t sustain consciousness for longer than a few seconds, and even then he was uncertain about what was real and what was imagined. Sometimes Harry was there, sometimes he wasn’t. That fact only added to Draco’s sense of disorientation.
Draco understood, and every time he saw the Weasel he teased him about his bad back and old man knees. Ron took it good naturedly, “You’ll get there one day, ferret.” But Draco never missed the relieved smile that always showed on his face afterwards.
“You still can,” said Harry as he entered the common room. Nott looked like he had been caught slipping someone a love potion.
Suddenly, Harry feels like he is intruding on a very personal moment. He feels sick with it. But just when he thinks that the pair are going to launch into another tirade. Ely crossed the room and kisses Cassius in front of everyone.
“I assume that you are referring to the pains Harry has been experiencing in his scar?” said Dumbledore cooly.
Lupin’s briefcase slipped from the desk; he had to stoop quickly to catch it. “Yes, Black must have found a way to fight them. I wouldn’t have believed…. Dementors are supposed to drain a wizard of their power if they are too long in their presence.”
Luna gave him a look that said, Don’t think I won’t throw paint on you, but smiled the next second so Draco relaxed.
Harry left the Potions classroom with a lot of questions, a smug dorm mate, a relieved Neville, and an annoyed Hermione Granger.
Harry stepped back, and turned to move towards the house. How could he? How could he have been so stupid? How could he have danced with him? And why didn’t that dance seem familiar to him when it should have? He knew, though he would rather forget it, how those hands felt on his body.
It was then that the quite handsome Viktor had looked more appealing than ever. It was only ever once, one drunken kiss, and it didn’t feel nearly as amazing as the photos made it look to be. But there it was, Harry’s first male kiss on the front page of the local tabloid. Harry seriously considered that Malfoy might have redecorated his entire cubicle in the horrifying photo, but when Harry got to his new partner’s desk. There was not one hint of the paper or the photo. Malfoy didn’t even say anything about, though he knew that the man had seen it.
“It sounded like...” Crabbe started, and Ron who had cottoned on to Harry's ploy finished, “Werewolves”.
Please tell me that you are being careful. I have no idea how you came by the information that you did, but I have to tell you that everything that you wrote to me is scarily accurate. Barty Crouch did serve as the sentencing agent in many of the cases regarding rouge death eaters. Karkaroff was one of them. He eagerly gave up the names to several others. Crabbe, Goyle, Malfoy. I am sure that none of these names will come as a surprise to you Harry. Everything you read in that harrowing account was true, even the part about Crouch sentencing his own son. He was involved in the rather gruesome torture of the Longbottoms alongside the Lestranges. We were rather good friends with the Longbottoms. They were fierce aurors and they loved each other and their son very much. I was glad to see that Neville is so much like them as you are your father. Barty Crouch Jr. was sentenced to a life sentence in Azkaban. His poor mother was devastated, but it turned his father into the man that he is today, strict, unrelenting.
“See?” said Harry as if Dean Thomas’ words could affect the match and given the relieved look on Seamus’ face, maybe they could.
“You is not insulting my master miss! Mr. Crouch is a good wizard. Mr. Crouch was right to sack bad Winky.”
But the force of its leap had carried it too far; it rolled off him. Dazed, feeling as though his ribs were broken, Harry tried to stand up; he could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attack. Scabbers had gotten loose in the struggling. Ron traced it to the base of the Womping Willow.
When they popped to the surface Malfoy woke out of whatever state he had been placed under and instantly started screaming that Harry was attempting to drown him.
“Winky forgets she is not bound to Mr. Crouch anymore; she is allowed to speak her mind now, but she won’t do it.”
“Oh, poor boy,” Fred said, gazing after Percy’s retreating form as he hurried to get ready for work.
He moved forward into the firelight. Close up, Harry thought he looked ill. There were dark shadows beneath his eyes and a thin, papery look to his skin that hadn’t been there at the World Cup.
Winky had been the one to watch him. She had nursed him, had cared for him since he was a child, before he was a Death Eater, before he knew what a Muggle born was, or learned to call them Mudbloods instead. She had loved him since he was born and so she wanted him to be free. One night out, the Quidditch World Cup would be perfect because Winky knew how much little Junior loved Quidditch. But things had gone wrong.
“Oh,” said Remus. “I do hope that you’ll accept the cake I left. It’s a special thank you from Sirius and I for taking care of Harry this summer.”
“You all really are fools.” Ely looked straight at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. “He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named killed Cassius.”
“I’d be upset to if I had that head of hair,” Tracey Davis said tossing her long perfectly straight hair over her shoulder. Harry wanted to hex all her hair into the floor.
Harry reached for his wand, but it was too late, the dog had made an enormous leap and the front paws hit him on the chest; he keeled over backward in a whirl of hair; he felt its hot breath, saw inch-long teeth….
Sorry about the delay. Currently pursuing a PhD and I write little bits each day when I get a moment. This is a shorter chapter but I needed it to get Draco to the safehouse. More to come soon!
“You seemed in a hurry.” Regulus was grinning at him and Draco flushed. “Yeah, I swapped out the one horcrux—wasn’t able to destroy it, though.”
Harry thought for a moment. Should he really lie about what happened? He was terribly embarrassed that he didn’t know the basics surrounding cheering charms, and he didn’t need the world knowing that he was ready to give up after everything that had happened. He nodded. “I think I can work with that one.”
“Me too.” The malaise of that statement and what it meant for Harry’s life hung in the air for a while after that. Dumbledore handpicked his pawn for the greater good, it seemed.
Sorry it's been awhile! I was trying to decide what I wanted this part of the series to be and now I think I've figured it out.
It was all coming out now, the ex-Malfoy Heir could hold in his rage no longer. “You didn’t even tell me you were plotting to leave—you just left me here alone. All I do is worry and then you tell us how stupid you’ve been and I can’t take it!”
"I'm sorry, didn't realize anyone was in here," Harry said. He looked at Draco. "You look ready to pass out, Malfoy."
Draco sighed and decided to change the subject. He’d confront his father about it all tomorrow. “You look really thin, Haz. Have they figured our what’s going on?”
Sirius and Remus looked on with concern as he approached. He would try to smile reassuringly at them but knew it would come off as a grimace. He walked up to Professor McGonagall, who seemed surprised to see him approach. The students were broken out into whispers as he inevitably caused a scene. If he could disappear on the spot, he would. “Is everything alright, Mr. Malfoy?” McGonagall asked, eyes crinkled in concern.
The elder Potter shrugged. “Not sure where he is. Anyway, they almost got caught by Nagini—You-Know-Who was coming. Now they’re off in the woods again.”
He brought a breakfast tray in for Harry and was instantly on alert. “You look really peaky, Haz,” he commented. “Get any sleep?”
Molly waved the apology off like it was nothing, but Sirius knew it meant a lot to her: he also had a penchant for stubbornness. “Besides,” he continued, “I’ll need all the help I can get with Harry—he has a knack for getting himself in all sorts of trouble.”
Hermione looked like she wanted to say more but Ron took her arm. “It’s fine, ‘Mione,” he said gently. His tone was not so kind toward Harry. “We’ll see you there,” the redhead said pointedly. Harry just nodded and they went on ahead.
“Have you considered what Harry wants?” Remus asked. “He’s been involved with this since he was a baby. You Know Who is clearly after him and will not rest until a face off.”
Draco turned over the folded parchment in his hands. His name was on it. His breath hitched. "Mother," he whispered to himself. He looked up at Remus. "Thank you for ensuring its delivery. I wish Severus was here for me to send a note back."
Harry found the strength to stand at that. “Fine, Ron. I’ll leave you alone. Thanks for being a great friend,” he spat venomously.
Draco laughed at that. Harry liked seeing the poshness fade from his face when he smiled. “I called him my wolf dad when I was on pain potions.”
Draco wrapped his arms around the Black Heir, pulling him close to rest his chin on top of his head. “It’s for all of us. I’m glad Ron suggested it.”
Harry looked frightened all over again. “I dunno if that’s such a good idea…” he began, but Sirius cut him off.
Draco rolled to his side to look at Harry, who was smiling at him. “Well, I’m here now, and you’re here for longer—no need to miss each other any longer, right?”
“Take ‘er away Ern,” said Stan. There was another tremendous BANG, and the next moment Harry found himself flat on his bed, thrown backward by the speed of the knight bus, Harry got up and looked out the window.
“Pretty boy syndrome, and yes, you have it,” Draco said to his partner. “I never would have pegged you for it in school, but yes, I definitely see it now, oh Chosen One.”
Harry stuck out his empty hand, palm up, and Draco was glad his eyes were closed so Harry couldn’t see how badly he was shaking. Every Slytherin instinct and every thing his parents had ever told him rang through his head to not do it, but as much as Harry trusted Draco, Draco also trusted Harry. He didn’t need to put his hand over Harry’s eyes, or blindfold him, he didn’t need to cast a glamour or make him turn away because Harry’s word was enough. Harry said he wouldn’t look so he wouldn’t, so Draco took his outstretched hand while lifting his shirt, revealing Harry’s matching mark on his body.
He had just turned the corner when he heard footsteps behind him. For a second he thought it might be Flint or maybe Blaise, but it wasn’t them, it was Snape. Harry watched as he crossed the corridor then vanished out of sight.
Ginny sighed, preparing to voice her complaints when Mrs. Weasley silenced her with a look. Harry glanced toward Sirius for a rebuttal for this ridiculously early bedtime, but he was steadfastly looking at the table top in front of him, ignoring Harry’s questioning gaze. No wonder you made Gryffindor, Harry thought as he stood from the table. You have absolutely no chill.
Harry had found out the truth and look what happened. He responded exactly the way Draco had always feared. A girl, younger than he, was being carted out as he was walking in, a worker of a side-along company waiting for her. Draco almost thought it was a friend of hers, or a family member before he saw the logo on the man’s vest and thought better of it.
This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Blaise nudged him under the table. A slight nod of his head kept Harry’s mouth shut.
His heart sank faster than he’d just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trying not to show how much he was trembling.
“A tracking spell,” Fred supplied. “That means that no matter where she is, that Malfoy can find her. In case she gets spooked by the little ghoul and decides to make it a run for it before he can cattle her down the aisle.”
“Barty,” whispered a witch in a long woolen dressing gown, “they’re kids, Barty, they’d never have been able to….”
At least his mind was busy studying for exams, memorizing the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions, and learning spells by heart. Then, about a week before the exams were set to start. Harry’s new
“It was horrible,” said Neville, in a higher voice than usual. “Did you feel how cold it got when it came in?”
“Assignments? What assignments?” Harry hated to admit it, but he was loathe to take on anymore work. While Umbridge was refusing to teach them much of anything, it seemed that the rest of his professors were doubling up on tasks and homework in an effort to prepare them for their OWLs.
Helios and Maleen quickly sit at the table and lippy pops into being giving them their breakfast and popping away after they said thank you
Remus stands: Of course not!  We wouldn't even be here without you , so I am ready to go when you are .
And we headed to Mcgonagall's office,  with Neville holding one hand and Cedric the other. And I sighed at least I didn't  get into  trouble  on the first day I thought.
" Draco leave Percy be ,we just bonded so that's why I am taking him with us to our rooms." I explained as Thoe groaned  something  about  them being over run by weasley's.
George:its wicked that we will have our own rooms. You have to tell us how you got dumbles to agree to that. though we will-
Nefertani: no time I came to talk business and no I was not the one who destroyed your wards looking at the anti-apperation wards they attackers put up I'm guessing they hacked the floor
While this was happening the kids were fighting on what to watch on the TV and Elisa sat on the couch and summoned Dippy for refreshments which were laid out
Nefertani: another thing is that Harry has gotten his creature inheritance from me ..I am a chameleon
Rabastian set me down just as the Flint family arrived with another mate of mine who I once again clung to in greeting as  I breathed in his scent.
"No matter your majesty,  if you shall stumble or make mistake I shall make it seem as if I caused it."
After class I decided to stay after along with Neville to clean up a pot that was knocked over by another first year with madame Sprouts  help.
Blaise and Draco worked  together to keep  me more calm until we were dismissed. Blaise gently massaged my scalp with his long fingers and played with my tail that still hadn't dissapeared.
I turned Around and looked at Nagnok and said casually "are you aware that you have a Horcrucx in your bank?" He Blanches " no I wasn't" he quickly walks to the desk and start's writing a letter." I would like to take it off your hands since it belongs to my son's mate so you will not have to deal with such .. disturbing things, and technically it is in Bellatrix lestranges vault which now belongs to Harry aka me since she was a black but was disowned." Nagnok looked at me and snapped "fine just get that disgusting thing out of here" I nodded and at that Moment a goblin came in with the Horcrucx in a bag holding it like it was the most disgusting thing in the planet.. I quickly took it then looked at griphook and Nagnok and said "I thank you for today may you get everlasting gold". The I shadow traveled home wanting to reach my wife and new child.
I never thought I'd see the day two slytherin's and a gryffindor fell over themselves to agree that they would do their utmost to be good mates...while shaking like scared puppies.
Nefertani: fire dancer will come with us when we go to see them because it would be better for Harry if all his mates lived in one place...which is why you are all currently living here until your bonds settle with Harry.
Let's just say we won the game by a landslide, and I was so proud of Marcus and Adrian because they only had one morning practice to Adjust to the new regime!
Nefertani : Marvolo calm down I will explain everything to you but you must calm down before I put you back to sleep
But before we could get to Roudy Remus  put a stop to our game of tag. Just in time as Tomas appeared  in the dining room to eat breakfast not a second later.
I glared in their direction and all either looked away pretended they didn't hear anything or sneered .
As expected Things were getting tense in the rooms after Oliver moved in and I decided enough was enough. The next day which was Sunday I forced all of my mates into the livingroom and put my foot down.
When I headed  down  Remus and Tomas were in a serious discussion about  a clause in the draft of laws.
After we left the station ten minutes pass when there is another knock on the compartment door. This time it's two twins with red hair and freckles.
"I know Blaise but I need to know if the culprit has been found yet!" I said wringing my hands nervously at the thought of someone targeting my mates and i.
Nefertani: be silent ! I have no wand . I am lord Ptolemy so to even suggest I would need a wand is insulting!
Bored my mates and I started  to play a game of trying to see who could make the most feathers  float at once.
"Alright,  I'll hear you out but let me tell you if you end up wasting our time ..I will make you regret the moment you were created..do you understand. " he said using his towering height to try to intimidate.
Nefertani: This is Hadrian James Ptolemy Potter Black my first born son and heir to My throne ! Our dynasty is blessed to continue for another generation!!
He then continued, " It seems  the order came from, Theos father who ..resents Marvolo's  newer ideals, but the Elf was purchased by My councilman  Henry ..it seems since he cant have me marry his oldest daughter he thought to remove Severus, and present His son who is similar to him in looks probably hoping you would latch on to him due to Severus's  passing. "
"I can't help it my little dove, you are just to precious to me.I can't help being protective it's my job afterall." He says smugly before kissing my head and being pulled away by fire dancer and his clan.
I am laying my head on Fire Dancers lap, feet upon Draco's while he tells me some of the tactics Marcus intends to use for tomorrow's game.
Sirius: what happened to Harry? Dumbledore said he was safe!! I swear to god I'll kill him if he lied to me! I am his RIGHTFUL guardian so he has no say-
Nefertani: you do know that I am also a king correct ? So technically it wouldn't just be an alliance you would be a vessel of my kingdom.
He gulped  twice ,and I pulled  away water finally  gone. And waited head on his chest listening to his heart beating.
Elisa got a very shrewd look in her eyes very familiar to her uncles. "that is true Tani but I am too young for raising a child I am only a child myself" ELISA says. I reply "we shall figure it out as we go I have the same fears as you but I know we can do this after all I have done this twice". I grinned " Nefertani shut up." I raised my hands in surrender Elisa sighs " alright I agree that this is the best recourse." I kissed her on the cheek "I knew you would see it my way" I said. Now let us go to bed Elisa tomorrow will be a LONG day. We walked back to the bedroom where harry was still peacefully sleeping and laid on either side of him. "Goodnight my loves" I whispered before I waved my hand and the torches went out and the curtains closed around the bed.
I washed my hands and rolled up my sleeves to make some turnovers ,Bacon, fruit and yogurt for my mates for breakfast.
Just to make sure no one is confused this story started on 1981 October 31st on Wednesday. Chapter 2 was Thursday November the first,the beginning of this chapter will be Friday then move on to the upcoming Wednesday a week after the whole Voldemort attack.
Nefertani Ptolemy: Is a Chamelion a wizard that can change species between magical creatures. ( like one day she is a vampire another a Veela etc) Also is a Metamorphogus, but mainly appears as a man or woman with light brown skin long curly hair with piercing golden falcon eyes. She is currently 14.
I opened my eyes and saw I was the first one up ... until I looked down and saw adorable green eyes looking up at me confused. But what was concerning was the darkness that was seeping from Harrys scar. I frowned which was really idiotic because Harry started to cry. I quickly picked him up "shush shhhh baby it's ok , it must be scary when you wake up with a stranger frowning at you" . "Mama!!" He whined at this Elisa awoke groaning "what time is it?" "I don't know"I replied picking Harry up and getting out of bed." Let's get some breakfast ." I'm coming Elisa said as I threw on a shirt  while holding the baby with one hand. After I finished I walked into the dinning Hall and put Harry in the highchair that was sitting by my chair. Harry looked at me and said" Nana?" Yes you can have a banana Harry I said . He got a focused look on his face for a 15 month old "oo you" I smiled and said" you can call me tata" a second after I said this Lippy laid sliced banana on his tray with cereal and Elisa walked in the room without a hair out of place."I'll have toast and eggs Lippy thank you" Elisa Said "I would like the same with bacon oh! And I want the eggs sunny side up" I said. Lippy popped away and came back with our food. We all ate quietly except Harry who was painting with his cereal. "Elisa after breakfast we should get ready to go to gringotts ". "But what about Harry we can't just waltz into diagonal ally with him upon hip?" Elisa Said "I'll just put an illusion on him and also, love this morning when I looked at Harrys aura I saw darkness leaking from his scar so I'll also have to have that checked out too" I replied "Tani do you think..." Elisa asked to which I replied "it is a possibility". We finished breakfast then went into our bedroom to dress for the day. I wore black and gold robes with my crest upon the back and pulled my hair into a man bun then put my cobra crown on my brow. Elisa wore light pale blue robes with silver that brought out her eyes with silver diadem with sapphires. And Harry wore a onesie that said "I'm not a hippogriff but I fly like one" and I put a glamour on him that made him look like he had blonde hair and gold eyes. "Madwe" Harry said as he reached for Elisa she picked him up and held him close "is everyone ready?" I asked my wife nodded so I held them both in my arms and shadow travelled straight to in front of gringotts.
Severus: Because  of our relationship  I am unable  to be your  potions professor  because  of this you father  is hiring  you a tutor,  though  you will take exams the same as the other students.
Nefertani and Elisa go to Sirius's trial a week after the Longbottoms incident,and happen to run into in-laws. And Harry meets one of his mates..
I asked reaching  out a hand and he nodded  face impassive yet the softening  of his eyes let me know he was affected.
I walked out of the bedroom and as we walked past the guards Harry sneezed and his hair looked like a rainbow gone wrong pink,neon orange,lime green and white. The guards and I chuckled and Harry looked at the guard to my left . And stared I heard growling and looked over to the guard growling back ..
Other than the propaganda about our house that has slowly been dying down due to the quibbler producing articles about the prejudice, and how it was negatively affecting our society.
Remus: we are nearly thrice his age !! Isn't he supposed to mate with the best potential candidates?
Harry : I am Harry ptolmey Potter and these are my other mates Draco Malfoy and Neville Longbottom. While the twins Maleen and Helios are my older siblings.
Nefertani: love, let me see Harry for a second..I am Pretty sure he is a chameleon like me but let me double check..
I nodded and pulled out the dry eraser board from my satchel,  the plans I drew on it earlier looping repeatedly.
Because no one was allowed to tease my mates but me. Neville surprised nearly everyone when he flew circles  around most of his fellow students,  now dont get me wrong he can be extremely clumsy. But when given encouragement or a goal Neville's manner completely changes, and he proves for the fist time he was meant for the house of the brave.
And then gently runs his hand gently on a white fox tail. That immediately  makes me pure again..before I realize  its connected to me.
I was happy to see none of my mates held anything against Theo for his grandfather's actions . Which helped Theo sit back up rather quick once it was confirmed we wouldn't shunt him due to who he was related to.
"Harry we told you to wait for us, we dont need to rush, our rooms aren't exactly going anywhere." Blaise said while shaking his head at me.
Elisa flooed home to get Harry while I went to saint mungo's to explain the situation to Harry's godfather's.
His eyes glowed for a moment as we simply stared at one another in amazement until the moment was broken by Blaise ,Draco, Theo,And Terry coming around the corner.
‘The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarted yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.’
Draco sighs: I also felt the strain  of being away from you love but that doesn't mean you should jump me as soon as you see me.
Sirius  gave me a kiss on the cheek and rushed out in a hurry muttering about being late  to a meeting. Even now when he has been a lord and business man for 9 years his time management is still horrible.
The others like Draco and Fire Dancer that have known him for years now simply nodded in his direction and sat down to eat. While the others greeted him quietly and sat down at their own spots.
Nefertani:yes you are going to be the Princess of the land/nature nymphs and your brother is going to be prince of the dragon shifters.
We wait for two minutes until the goblins I requested came in the room. Griphook"Lord Ptolemy welcome to gringotts what can I possibly do for you" "first griphook my wife and I would like to blood adopt this child here who is Harry Potter because his current magical guardian is incompetent and I would like to do a screening ritual as well where I am only privy to the results is it possible to be done" griphook and Nagnok looked at one another and Said "for a price and you also have to be on the will to become magical guardian and give proof that the current one is invalid" I snorted "I can do all of these things bring me the pensive and I'm not on the potters will but I was on blacks who was Harry's godfather before he got arrested .. when is blacks trial anyway I don't even know why they arrested him" As griphook walked away to get the needed things Nagnok replies sourly "Sirius was arrested because he was supposedly the Potters secret keeper and betrayed the potters , and he wasn't given a trial curtesy of crouch". Elisa gasped" but that isn't true "'she said then she looked at me and said "Nefertani we have to do something"! "We will dear" I replied. I quickly asked Nagnok for a pen and paper which he gave to me and wrote a letter to Amelia bones and explained that Sirius hasn't had a trial when I had proof he was innocent. At the moment griphook came in with a pensive and I grabbed two vials for me and my wife . Harry started to fuss so I transfigured a piece of paper to a toy which he started to gum on. I remembered the night before and how Sirius was at my palace when the potters got attackedand put it in the bottle then my wife put her memory proof in her bottle as well. I sealed both in the letter then with a wave of my hand sent it to Amelia bones. "Now to what we came for" I said and put the memory of finding Harry on the porch and of his blood families ways.
We then were each given feathers , after spending most of the class speaking about the theory behind the spell.
I was finishing some portfolios concerning Harry's lord ships when I got 3 letters one from Amelia bones, another from Gringotts, and the last one had come from a potion master In My Kingdom. I read the one from Amelia bones first ...she was obviously upset when she wrote the letter and said that she could not find the paperwork for Sirius's trial and when confronted Crouch found out that he was sent straight to Azkaban. And that crouch is being investigated as well as some other involved while they are getting Sirius back from the horrible prison to a holding cell in the ministry where he can await trial. Next letter as about the goblins dissolving all they keys to Harry's vaults that were not in my hands like I asked.I then looked at at the one from the potion master which was about not having the ingredients to continue making the dragon pox vaccine because the company fails to bring the shipment. I was pissed because here I am paying money out of my ass for nothing. I quickly write a letter to the company and gringotts to cancel business with them while I ready myself to go visit the Longbottoms to try and do business with them in stead.
