“It’s going—” Harry broke off as he felt the familiar sensation of the presence of a foreign mind prodding at his defences. He focused on his shields to strengthen them and a few seconds later, the presence retreated.
Harry laughed a little at seeing Draco’s exasperation, but he sounded apologetic when he said, “I’m sorry, sugar. I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.”
“Remus told you I was at Grimmauld Place.” It wasn’t a question. Minerva only smiled and nodded. Severus narrowed his eyes at her. “You
The day flew by quickly, with Harry returning to his duelling practice and apparition training. Draco didn’t join them this time, spending his afternoon in the now refurbished library instead, researching Merlin knew what. All Harry had gotten as a response when he’d asked was that it had to do with potions and Harry should go focus on being the Chosen One. He’d recognised the mocking as a means to get him to stop asking questions, so he’d left Draco to it. Chances were that he’d learn soon enough what it was all about; Draco just wanted things to be prepared before sharing them sometimes.
Tea appeared on the coffee table between them, serving itself. House-elf magic.
Remus gave a pained laugh and said, “I think she fancies me, but I have no idea how to make her understand that it’s one-sided.”
Severus hummed in agreement. He glanced at the clock and sighed. “We should go. Are you happy with your room?”
The following morning came too soon. Harry got up groggily, trying not to think about what awaited him at breakfast.
Harry gave him an apologetic look and nodded.
“What is your
“That makes two of us.”
In reality, it was as much about war preparations as it was Remus updating Severus about Harry’s emotional state, which had drastically improved rather suddenly. Not that he wasn’t still grieving Sirius or still processing the prophecy and Severus being his father, but he seemed noticeably happier and far less tense. Perhaps it was the duelling training with Remus that gave his mood a boost, since he was able to let off some steam there on a daily basis now.
“Draco, hold this for me?”
, probably knowing full well that his mother would just send him right back. And how dare his mother force him to endure
“Do I look that ridiculous?” Harry asked, arching an eyebrow at Draco.
A wave of resentment rose in his throat like bile. How could he have been so stupid? Had he actually hoped that Severus Snape might love him as his son? Perhaps Snape was right and he really was uselessly stupid.
“Harry, it seems that these charms did not only alter your exterior, but also concealed your magical signature. How much do you know about magical signatures?”
happened for you to suddenly disappear like that?” Okay, maybe not completely calm.
His knock was answered promptly, if in a rather suspicious tone. He opened the door to Severus’ room and found the man sitting at his desk, a stack of what looked like essays in front of him.
“Draco?”
, or you’ve lost your Chosen One.”
“You look like you’re going to faint any second, Potter,” Draco drawled, some colour returning to his face. “Wait a moment.”
It was considerably harder now to listen to what the twins were telling him, his eyes continuously flitting back to Harry, who had an intense-looking discussion with the other two parts of the Golden Trio. Blowing out a breath, Draco forced his focus back to product testing at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. Thankfully, his mother and Mr Weasley had joined Draco’s conversation with the twins as well, so Draco’s increased distractibility had gone unnoticed. At least he hoped so.
“As usual, he evaded that question when I asked him. But I’d bet a hundred galleons that he’s looking for that locket — if he hasn’t found it already. Whatever reason he had to touch that cursed ring, the locket is just as important. I know it.”
Narcissa regarded him with a thoughtful look.
wandlessly,” he protested, automatically getting defensive because of her accusatory tone. “Just those healing forms. And a few spells I know quite well already or spells that are kinda intuitive.”
“About Occlumency?” Severus asked without turning around.
Severus stared at her in disbelief. His relationship with Lily had been his most guarded secret, both during his time at Hogwarts as well as after they’d graduated and he’d joined the Dark Lord.
really sorry for— Well, for everything I did and said that made you feel mocked or looked down upon. I didn’t exactly have the best social skills, and I’m fairly sure I still don’t, not in a healthy way at least. I understand why you rejected me, now. I didn’t back then though. My father raised me to believe that, as a Malfoy, I was inherently superior, entitled to the best. When you rejected me…it threw everything I knew and relied upon overboard. Believe it or not, I genuinely wanted to be your friend.”
I feel like I have to point out that the rating of this fic changed from Mature to Explicit. Not because of this chapter, obviously, but because of one much further down the line that I got done yesterday.
“Come on, tell me.”
“Oh shut it, Lupin,” Severus growled.
“Are you still mad at me?”
Remus gave an agreeing hum, pulling the man swiftly onto his lap.
“You kinda do, yeah,” said Remus.
All four of them gasped, Albus closed his eyes as if he was in pain. Severus could barely keep the outrage out of his face. Had he expected to keep this
Seemingly unbothered by the lack of space, Remus joined him on his armchair and pulled him into a tight hug. They stayed like that for a long time; Remus providing a steady, calming presence while Harry cried and cried—cried like he hadn’t done in
“You could have left.”
“What I was getting at,” Harry continued after extracting himself from Draco again, propping himself up on one elbow, the other arm resting on Draco’s chest, “is that we’re going to be down there, in the same room, along with everyone else. How much do you want them to know? Because if I’m supposed to keep my hands off you that has to be a conscious decision.”
“Sirius named an heir.” He pushed open the door, leading Narcissa inside.
ehehe, so here’s the chapter that changed the rating for this fic from Mature to Explicit. It’s my first go at writing smut, so I hope it’s … satisfying?
Harry gaped at him. Remus’ smile widened a little.
For a second, regret filled him as he remembered the Manor. Despite his recent negative experiences there, it was his childhood home. Now he would probably never return, or at least not until the war was over, if both him and the Manor survived that.
Another nod.
There was a cold fury in Harry’s voice, one that chilled Severus to the bone. The question took him aback, though, and he had to think about it for a moment.
“Alright, alright,” Harry laughed. “Still, I’m sorry. For being here. I just know that Sirius and James used to be with you during full moons, and I didn’t want to leave you all by yourself. If you want me to leave, I can go. Just, er, I don’t know, tap your paw on the floor if you want me to go?”
Thanks to
“It’s definitely what I want,” he said firmly, holding Harry’s face between his hands. “I was worried you wouldn’t— It doesn’t matter. We want the same. I want you, nobody else, and not just a physical thing, I—” He swallowed, suddenly anxious. “I like you. A lot. I guess I wouldn’t have spent so much energy on hating you if I didn’t.”
“I wanted to ask you a favour,” Remus began, glad that his voice didn’t betray how nervous he was. “The full moon is coming up, and I was hoping you would brew the Wolfsbane potion for me again. If I had the potion, I could stay here during the full moon and I’d prefer not to leave Harry for two full days. Plus my recovery time would be much longer without the potion, meaning I couldn’t really be there for him for quite a bit longer after my transformation.” He shot Severus a pleading look. “I would be very grateful for your help, Severus, for Harry’s sake.”
“He wants me to kill him before this curse in his hand does,” he revealed dryly, shooting a glare at Albus.
Remus’ mouth was warm and soft and moving just the way Severus liked. Within seconds Remus had slid onto his lap and Severus sunk his hands in his hair, pulling him closer. The thought of a privacy charm flitted through Severus’ mind, and he was about to break the kiss to suggest it, when Narcissa’s chiming charm rang through the house.
“Harry already found someone,” Severus cut in. Albus’ eyebrows rose ever so slightly, but it was enough to betray his surprise to Severus.
Severus stared at him incredulously. He felt something inside him crumble as he allowed himself to truly consider for the first time that Harry Potter might be his son. Suddenly, everything felt too much, and it threatened to overwhelm him.
, he thought frantically, the tension between them crackling. He tried to shove Potter off him, but Potter was stronger, pressing him into the wall. Since when was Potter the same height as him anyway, hadn’t he always been much shorter?
was suddenly visible. Draco felt himself thrown back onto the Quidditch pitch, the only other time in which Harry wore such form-fitting clothing. No wonder Draco had always lost those matches, it was impossible to focus like this. And now he was
(See the end of the chapter for
“They won’t hate you just because Severus is your father,” he said softly, and judging from Harry’s expression he’d hit it right on the head.
Nevertheless, Draco couldn’t help but feel somewhat useless. Sure, they hadn’t been together for very long yet, and trust took time to build, but it was painfully obvious that Harry
to me before throwing hexes?”
“Remus!” Was that Harry’s voice?
“Severus, Severus.” The words were cold, laced with mock pity. “A mudblood? You defiled yourself with such filth and never deigned to tell me? Tsk, tsk, you disappoint me.”
Narcissa threw up her arms with an expression of pure exasperation on her face.
Severus groaned and nodded. “Very impressive, I must admit,” he agreed, rubbing his chest.
“Yeah, actually, that describes it quite well.” He thought for a second. “Imagine it like different plays in Quidditch. You would never dismiss those by saying ‘why would we need tactics if I can just throw the Quaffle’, would you?”
“Thank you, I would like to see my check-book renewed, and the two young men would have access to their respective vaults,” his mother responded coolly, her perfect pure-blood mask firmly in place.
The next kiss Harry gave him was so gentle it made Draco’s chest ache.
“It’s not like you,” she insisted and crossed her arms. “Blaise, some help here please?”
He hesitated. Minerva was part of the Order, but he was unsure whether he should tell her about Narcissa. He wasn’t certain whether Albus would want the Malfoy’s situation to become common knowledge.
On an entirely different note, ridiculous(ly funny) things happened to me and I wrote a mini
“I didn’t,” replied Harry. At Severus’ questioning look he explained further, “It’s an illusion. Your spells went through until they hit my shield—”
“My apologies,” he said, gesturing towards the other armchair. “I did not feel like exposing myself to the tumult of the castle right before the holidays, but if you’d like to join me here I can pour you a glass.”
Harry turned to him, his expression exasperated.
“What are you going to tell Dumbledore?” asked Neville.
Remus inhaled sharply, and Severus met his eyes for the first time since coming out into the garden. They held each other’s gaze for a moment, then Remus nodded and said, “That would certainly be a challenge, cub. But you should probably fight him one-on-one first, before trying to take on all three of us.”
“No, of course we didn’t go there,” he said. “We went to the Room of Requirement. Now unless you want
“That—” Severus broke off and considered for a moment. It wasn’t impossible, if Harry’s shield had been raised far further away from him than one normally would place a shield—halfway across their battleground. He must’ve put it up under the cover of the fog.
“What? Oh, yeah,” Harry responded while exhaling a deep breath.
“Yes?”
Relieved he fled into his room and buried himself in one of the books he’d found earlier. It was an interesting read, and he found himself taking notes on a spare parchment he fished out of his trunk.
“I would like to formally accept my unclaimed inheritances,” he said, his voice remarkably steady.
“So, where are you bringing me?” Narcissa inquired as they stepped out of the house. “You hardly planned for me to stay here, where the Dark Lord would undoubtedly find me with ease.”
She smiled at him proudly, and he felt his chest loosen a little.
Severus wondered what Albus would’ve done if Harry had refused, which reminded him of the request Albus had made of
sitting on that couch there.
“Have you found a new Defence teacher yet?” Remus asked suddenly.
has done a full 180 since your visit to the Ministry,” he said, pulling the newspaper out of his pocket. “They’re calling you the Chosen One, saying that you’re a hero destined to kill You-Know-Who.”
For the next few hours, Draco was able to forget his lingering anxiety. After warming up with some lazy passes of the Quaffle—Harry turned out to be surprisingly competent with it—and a few practice shots at the goal-hoops, they switched to playing one-on-one seeker games, neither going easy on the other. Just because they were dating didn’t mean that they weren’t rivals anymore when it came to Quidditch—not even on Harry’s birthday. Draco held his own well enough, but when Remus called for them to come down Harry had a slight majority of victories.
(the textbook, not the film).
Harry raised his eyebrows. “What do you mean?”
“Sounds like she still has that childish energy we already grew out of,” said Pansy with a longing look in her eyes.
Harry didn’t try to speak to Severus again. The man stayed in his room, except for Occlumency lessons every other day, during which they barely talked. Harry’s shields were excellent by now, and coupled with the newly increased motivation of not letting Severus see how he felt, they sufficed to keep him out practically every time.
friends, Luna. But I’m glad you want to continue it, too,” he added towards Harry, “I improved a lot with your tutoring. Definitely learned more than from any other Defence teacher.”
They spent another couple minutes discussing the lesson before they bid each other goodbye. Harry put the mirror back into his bedside table. A quick Tempus showed him that breakfast was about to end, which meant that the other Gryffindors were going to be back soon.
“Uhm, I’m afraid I don’t have my key with me,” Harry threw in, a shadow of anxiety creeping back into his eyes.
They were already at it when he stepped out the back door to watch. Harry was turning into a formidable duellist, and Severus watched with pride as his son evaded a series of jinxes that Remus shot his way. Draco was sitting on the sidelines, watching.
“Draco, what’s—”
“And I said
Potter’s lips were unreasonably soft. And warm. And
“Actually, his Potions work has improved to near perfection as well by now.” Minerva’s eyebrows rose almost to her hairline and Severus laughed. “I’ve been tutoring him and Draco in the sixth year curriculum. Horace Slughorn won’t teach them a thing if he’s still using the same methods as when I was a student.”
Draco rolled his eyes, but spoke the first incantation without hesitation. Snape followed suit, conjuring forth his own magical signature.
the canvas came off the wall, nearly falling onto Mrs Malfoy, who just managed to catch it. A triumphant smile spread on her thin lips, as she drew her wand and promptly shrunk the portrait to the size of a stamp. Harry thought he heard outraged shrieking as Mrs Malfoy pocketed Walburga’s frame, but it was too quiet to understand.
Harry laughed again and leaned over to give Draco a kiss, successfully wiping the scowl off his face.
“Well, if you say so,” he conceded, and leaned in to kiss him.
Harry wasn’t usually the type to be so…defeated. Harry had a temper—mind, it had mellowed out considerably since he’d been freed of those charms, but it was by no means gone. Harry ran head-first into danger, into confrontation, even into literal battle. Harry didn’t just give up. But these past few days, well, Harry had appeared to give up. Smiles had looked forced, green eyes dull, and he had stopped eating properly. It had unnerved and worried Draco to no end. Sure, he’d certainly been able to distract his boyfriend, to cheer him up momentarily again and again, but there had nonetheless been an air of defeat about him that just felt
Unfortunately, with his first priority objective—riling up Potter—achieved, Draco found himself growing restless again between their encounters; despite their ever increasing frequency. Although he had plenty of books to entertain himself with, now that his mind was satisfied with Potter’s level of liveliness, he had too much space to think about other things. Darker things. Things like the fact that his father would probably have forced him to take the Mark if he hadn’t been arrested. As the days passed, these thoughts took up more and more space in Draco’s head.
. He had seen everything and he hadn’t left. And really, if Harry was completely honest with himself, the secret of those scars had been the main reason—the
“Never keep secrets from me again,” the Dark Lord hissed, before pushing him back onto the ground hard enough for his head to hit the stone floor with a bang.
boyfriend, or of someone else getting this sort of affection from his mother—but he found that he didn’t. Even though it had only been a week since Harry and him had started seeing each other, Draco had never felt so sure about anything before. Harry was his, he was family now, and it made sense that Draco’s mother would also come to care for him. He felt a smile spread on his face, as he watched his mother soothe Harry, and he gently put a hand on Harry’s back, just so he could feel he was here.
to be my son,” Severus snarled. “Not when he has Remus and Molly who love him like he’s their own blood.”
“It will be fine,” he said again, but didn’t continue to prod Draco further.
“Concerns about me,” Draco guessed. Harry nodded. “Well, it was to be expected that at least one of them would balk. Although Hermione accepted my apology, so that’s a start.”
Draco gaped at him. Surely he couldn’t be serious?
him suddenly far outweighed his insecurity.
“Er, I—” Harry gave him a helpless look.
They withdrew without another word, sliding the compartment door closed again. Harry and his friends sat in silence for a few moments, then Ginny began to laugh anew.
him! Why would he
“Sorry, uh— Crush the bean, don’t cut it. Gives you more juice,” Harry replied quickly.
“Yes, I used it,” Severus cut into Draco’s rapid fire questions. “It worked as any other shampoo would work, yes I liked the smell, and I wouldn’t know what to change.”
He rolled his eyes in exasperation. Over the last few weeks he’d come to learn that the woman seldom missed anything, and he wasn’t always sure whether he found it impressive or slightly terrifying. It felt like it was impossible to have any secrets from her, which wasn’t something he was used to. It felt like— like having a mother. Harry blinked, surprised by his own thoughts. His relationship with Narcissa felt so different from the one he’d built with Mrs Weasley, who had so far been the closest thing to a mother to him. The sudden realisation of how much he’d come to rely on Narcissa’s presence just amplified the worries he was so hesitant to voice.
Harry didn’t know what to do. He looked over at Severus who was watching them with an expression Harry had never seen on him before.
It was way too soon that they heard the chiming charm his mother always sent when breakfast was ready, and they reluctantly parted.
“An incredible understatement, but I’ll accept it,” said Draco, resting his forehead on Harry’s chest, a smile tugging on his lips.
“Who else would it be?” Narcissa asked diplomatically.
Harry smirked and moved closer to Draco until he was barely an inch from his ear, whispering, “I wouldn’t complain if you got me
“Healing?” Severus’ voice was laced with veiled curiosity.
Severus gave a deep sigh, cast a cleaning charm at the floor and sat down next to Draco. “You’re right,” he said quietly. “Fathers should care for their sons, protect them. I know that. And I’m trying, but I can’t really blame him for not letting me. I’ve been horrible to him since the first day we met—”
Harry winked at him and Draco laughed. Time for a show indeed.
“We must go about this carefully,” she said slowly. “Harry’s well-being must remain our priority. Yes, his relatives deserve to suffer, but their suffering can not cause more distress for Harry, and despite their horrible deeds, I’m unsure how he would feel about his father and his guardian flat-out murdering them. No, we have to find another way to repay them for their cruelty. A legal way.”
writing smut, hell no, but evidently I got over it enough to get it done.
He already had his wand pointed at Severus’ chest, and only a second later the dull ache of the stunner faded.
“It’s going to be alright, Harry,” Narcissa assured him. “Although I did mean to ask you something, before I forget: Would you mind if I called just two or three of our house-elves in for help tomorrow?”
Each cut drew a scream, until Severus’ voice began to give out and screams diminished to hoarse yelps. He felt blood trickle down his legs, thought he heard it dripping to the floor. His arms were completely slashed open at this point, as were his thighs and the sides of his torso. Oddly, the Dark Lord had left the centre of his chest alone. Severus wasn’t sure whether he should be happy or concerned about that. So far, at least it appeared that he would be able to survive this.
Hermione frowned, regarding Harry with a thoughtful look.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ugh! Please! Just—!
“I should get going. See you at home?”
Stars danced in front of his closed eyelids as he came on Harry’s name.
since he’d arrived at Grimmauld Place. Not that Potter addressed him by name a lot in the first place, but the few times Draco had heard his first name out of Potter’s mouth, it had made his breath hitch. Anger flared up in Draco’s stomach and his eyes flashed as he drew his wand.
. It was beyond ridiculous.
to stare. The thought made him giddy.
Once Harry’s orgasm was definitely through, he pulled off and wiped his chin, before kissing his way up Harry’s body. Now that his attention wasn’t occupied with giving his first blowjob ever anymore, he became painfully aware of his own erection again. Reaching down, he began palming himself as he planted a hard kiss on Harry’s lips.
Sometimes Draco, Remus and Narcissa joined them, which usually resulted in Severus, Draco and Narcissa having a miniature chess tournament between the three of them, with Harry and Remus admitting defeat after the first few games and contending themselves with watching as the three Slytherins tore each other apart on the chess board. On one such evening Remus had produced a set of cards for Exploding Snap and within no time there were two fierce competitions running in parallel.
“It’s a long story,” he mumbled, hoping Severus would just drop it.
Harry hummed, thinking.
He whirled around at the sound of his name, coming face to face with Lupin. The man gave him a tired smile.
again. He looked alive, strong and incredibly hot—
“And you’re seriously trying to tell us that she— that you—” Mrs Weasley gestured between Severus and Harry.
Harry narrowed his eyes, then turned and took position opposite Severus without a word, wand raised. A malicious smirk spread on Severus’ face, and Draco had to remind himself that this was an act.
“Thank you. For the bracelet. You have no idea how much it means to me that you would give me such a thing. I truly love it.”
in his head, but he rationalised it away with the fact that “Malfoy” would be ambiguous with Narcissa in the house—had sent a hex at him in the hallway and somehow
Draco smiles. “Meet you at the entrance in fifteen minutes?”
Severus’ nerves calmed a little, and they headed up into the drawing room together, where Severus poured them two glasses of firewhisky before they settled down in one of the smaller seating areas with only three armchairs around a small table.
It was the exact opposite with Narcissa and Draco. After their objective assessment of the dining room, Harry had insisted on helping Narcissa with the next room, to which she had eventually agreed, albeit rather reluctantly. She seemed to believe that the Lord of the house should not have to deal with such things, but Harry had stayed stubborn, until she’d eventually allowed him to help her clear out one of the unused bedrooms on the second floor.
“Mate, I didn’t know you could fight like this!”
“Seems smitten, as far as I can tell,” Narcissa replied with a shrug. “Or did you hear him complain when Draco all but dragged him out of here, while he clearly had been about to argue with me to stay?”
“Here, that should help with magical exhaustion, and probably also just regular exhaustion.”

look amused. Well, shit.
“I could use a drink after this,” said Severus, hoping his voice didn’t sound as cautious to Remus as it did to himself.
Severus looked horrified, his face twisting with guilt. He looked at Harry.
Numbly, Harry reached out to take a sandwich. He passively registered that his stomach was rumbling and forced himself to take a bite. It did help, he supposed, but his chest still felt hollow. He was struggling to comprehend the full weight of what Remus had told him.
later! She wouldn’t have—
“Harry, dinner is ready.”
Suppressing the icy flare of panic, Severus brought up his mental shields and reinforced them double and triple. He felt the wriggling presence of something foul at the edge of his mind, worming its way inside. Taking deep breaths, he allowed it in. He knew what to do, he’d done it countless times. It didn’t matter that suddenly there was so much more at stake, that he suddenly had a secret more important than his own life.
“Don’t even think about it,” he replied, before placing another, much softer kiss on Draco’s lips.
“Right, because that would’ve been such a realistic scenario,” Draco said with a dejected sigh. An uncomfortable weight settled in his stomach. “Don’t you remember what I told you? Even though I haven’t agreed with my father’s views in a long time, I still felt compelled to keep up appearances. You said it yourself: I was a right git to you. My father would’ve made me regret it otherwise.”
Harry frowned. Had he passed out? Just what kind of spells had Dumbledore done?! It took barely longer than a moment before the answer clicked into place. Dumbledore’s spells were supposed to rid Harry of any foreign magic put on him—whatever magic had been on him must’ve somehow changed his appearance.
How— What?!”
“What are you on about?” Draco asked, as they arrived in the entrance hall, where his mother was waiting for them.
“Valid point.” Harry leaned in for another kiss. Draco melted into him, his agitation dissipating under Harry’s touch. Draco walked backwards, pulling Harry along, until his legs hit the edge of the bed and he let himself fall onto the dark blue covers, breaking the kiss. He toed off his shoes before he moved further to the centre of the bed.
He hurried out of the bathroom and grabbed his broom, which was settled in the corner of the bedroom, holding it up next to himself. Definitely taller. He whirled around and went back into the bathroom, this time turning to a full-length mirror on the wall opposite the bathtub.
“It’s only been two days since Lucius was arrested. If we play this well, you could return to Hogwarts after the summer—where you’d undoubtedly be safest. You’d have to act fast, though. Is Narcissa ready to leave on short notice? Can she gather whatever possessions you want to keep and didn’t bring to Hogwarts for you?”
“We should talk, shouldn’t we,” Harry stated dryly, breaking the thick silence between them.
it unsettle him so much? He wasn’t sure. Perhaps it was simply that he was so used to hating everything about the boy that the sudden lack of unpleasant behaviour had startled him. He frowned again. That couldn’t be all there was to it.
“Fine, whatever,
Draco’s heart quickened a little. “What about Hermione and We— Ron?”
Harry stopped dead in his tracks.
Anger shot through him at the thought of Severus. What the hell was wrong with the man? One moment they had been getting along wonderfully, talking every evening, even sharing a glass of wine sometimes, and then, without any warning, Severus refused to talk to him at all. Or to Harry. Remus wasn’t sure what made him angrier. Probably that Harry was getting hurt—the boy didn’t deserve to be treated like that. Remus had initially tried to ask Harry about what Severus had said to him, but Harry had evaded the topic repeatedly, and eventually Draco had taken Remus aside and given him a summary of what had happened. How Severus had openly rejected Harry, shut him down and out and left him behind. It got Remus’ blood boiling. After all that talk of how he wanted to make Harry’s relatives pay, Severus was now treating Harry with the same condescension, abandoning him.
Draco turned a few pages with his free hand. “Huh, you’re right. So, what? You think that—”
“Because Sirius wasn’t straight, he liked men.”
Annoyance bubbled up in Harry’s chest. “And how am I supposed to do that exactly?” he snapped, before quickly adding “Sir.”
Without breaking their kiss, Remus walked Severus backwards until they hit the wall, pinning the slightly shorter man against it. Severus’ hands travelled up his back and tangled in his hair as they continued to explore each other’s mouths until suddenly, Severus
“It’s not so bad,” Ginny dismissed his apology cheerfully. “He’s a wonderful target for pranks, last time I doused his jacket with an odor that attracts the garden-gnomes, it was rather hilarious to watch.”
It felt like an eternity until Slughorn finally reached the table where Harry, Ron and Hermione were sitting next to Ernie. Hermione’s already sour expression darkened further when he sniffed her cauldron and gave no reaction beyond a satisfied nod.

“Not a particularly wise choice, wouldn’t you agree? In fact, a fairly obviously
“House-elves? Why would you need more house-elves?”
“Here, I got you some robes, those should fit you fine until we get you some new ones,” he said, pushing the bundle of clothes into Harry’s arms. Harry eyed the robes somewhat sceptically, but accepted it, before turning his attention back to Remus.
And, yes, maybe he was treating it all too lightly, but he knew that if he were to really stop and think about the war ahead and the things he’d have to do sooner or later, he’d probably lose his mind. There was no time for such things anymore, not for him. Not for the sodding Chosen One. He knew what he had to do, there was no other option, and he’d accepted that. It really

“Makes sense, I suppose,” he replied. “What’s the other thing?”
already, but truly obliterating Dementors was a task usually left to specialised Hit-Wizards. It didn’t bode well for the light side of this war.
Ron on the other hand was most excited about Harry being Quidditch Captain, and Harry got the distinct impression that his best friend was actively avoiding to bring up anything that could even remotely be related to Draco or Severus. He even avoided asking how Harry was doing.
Sharp heat shot through him and suddenly he was on the edge. He broke the kiss with a gasp, throwing his head back, his fingers tightening in Draco’s hair.
a real fight,” Harry complained.
“Ah, Severus, how good of you to join us.” The high, cold voice chilled Severus to the bone.
The next carriage pulled up and Severus’ question answered itself when Harry and his friends climbed out of it. Compared to Draco, Harry moved at almost startling speed, quickly catching up to the Slytherins who were now being controlled by Filch.
“How is that none of my con—”
“Wicked,” Ron beamed. Apparently the twins’ shop had distracted him sufficiently to drop the subject of Harry’s relationship for now. Hermione rolled her eyes and shot Harry a significant look.
“Mind you, you were a right git back then, but I always thought you were pretty hot,” said Harry, his tone utterly casual.
“She also made that prophecy about Wormtail back in third year, remember? She
Harry knew that Ron was probably struggling to accept that his best friend was not only the son of the Head of Slytherin, but also
“You’ll be fine, mate,” Ron tried to reassure him. Harry gave him a feeble nod in response and stared down onto his plate, the last shred of appetite he’d had now gone.
Harry?” Draco asked sweetly, obviously revelling in Harry’s desperation.
Draco rolled his eyes. “A little, yeah. Come on, Potter, if I’m supposed to face an army of Weasleys in twelve hours, I need all the sleep I can get.”
He took another swig of firewhisky and continued to stare into the flames.
It was at least several minutes before they finally parted again, both rather out of breath. Potter’s face was flushed, lips red and slightly swollen, green eyes sparkling. He was beautiful.
“There has to be,” Lupin insisted.
“The potion won’t suddenly stop working, if we had messed it up it wouldn’t have worked in the first place. I’ll ward the door again from the inside if you’re so worried, you can even ward it from the outside if you want.”
He pulled himself together and got out of his damned armchair. It wouldn’t do any good to sit around brooding here, secluding himself.
He raised his wand again, gathered his magic to a sharp point behind his eyes and cast,
“It’s strange to hear it, too,” Draco added.
Harry gave a nervous laugh and rubbed the back of his neck.
Draco had always been a light sleeper, but the past year of increasing pressure and anxiety due to his father’s demands and the prospect of the Mark had exacerbated this predisposition to the degree where he’d wake up from the slightest noise. It was a right pain, usually. But not tonight. Tonight, it was a blessing.

“I thought you might appreciate having a room here, even though you can not use it at the moment. Just know that it is yours, and should the need ever arise you can come here whenever you want. Draco already had access to my quarters, so you’ll both be able to come and go—but I’m sure I don’t have to remind you that you can not overdo it or people will raise suspicions in no time. If you come here, nobody can see you. If necessary, go through my office—there’s a connecting door here.” Severus opened the door in question, and Harry nodded, looking strangely dazed. “Are you alright?”
“I didn’t want to make you wait longer than necessary,” Harry replied sheepishly as he stepped up to Draco.
, he remembered, and the thought was amusing enough to let him breathe properly again. It didn’t last long. His chest constricted once more as he remembered the prophecy Dumbledore had told him about. He’d have to think about that later too. It still didn’t explain the changes in the mirror.
“Potter,” the man drawled.
to talk about whatever was preoccupying him, he simply didn’t dare to. It made Draco curse every stupid thing he’d ever said, everything he’d done to make trusting him even harder than it already seemed to be in general for Harry.
“Well,” he said breathlessly, “that was...“
He blushed a little. “You were…interesting, and not just because you’re Harry Potter, but because of how
After he’d dressed again, Severus glanced out of the window to see Remus getting ready for his daily duelling session with Harry. Despite the dreary weather, they still practised in the garden. Harry had mentioned the idea of converting one of the second floor bedrooms into a training room, but so far that hadn’t happened and Severus honestly wasn’t convinced any of these rooms would be big enough for that purpose—especially if they wanted the training dummy Remus had given Harry for his birthday to be
Straight to the point, just like Harry. Gryffindors.
More steps, voices becoming clearer.
“Oh well,” sighed Harry, “might as well do as he says.”
“Now, whoever manages to brew the best Draught of Living Death by the end of this lesson will win one small vial of Felix Felicis,” Slughorn announced, and a murmur went through the class.
Draco gaped at him. “Pardon me? You
“I’m sorry I shut you out, Harry. I didn’t think you’d want me to—well, to be your father. I didn’t think you’d want me to involve myself in your life. But I do, I really do, and that terrifies me, because I frankly have very little experience with showing affection. You have torn my walls wide open and left me vulnerable.” He faltered, dropping his eyes. “After hearing you talk to Molly on your birthday I was convinced you were only humouring me, that you didn’t actually need or want me because you already found another family. So I ran away and shut you out, trying to protect myself. I’ve acted like a child and I’ve not only hurt you but also put Narcissa’s life in danger in the process. I am so, so sorry. I am proud to call you my son, and I would love nothing more than for you to see me as your father.”
“Why did you marry a Death Eater then?”
“We should probably get out of here, shouldn’t we?” he said softly, leaning in close enough to nudge Draco’s nose with his own. The gesture felt so incredibly soft and intimate that Draco forgot to breathe for a moment.
Harry was taken aback by that. Mrs Malfoy was
“Enough of the prophecy, Harry has a
And, Merlin fucking spare him, he liked what he saw.
“Yes,” Harry answered, his tone marginally softer now.
Once again, pain seared through his body as the Dark Lord sent another Cruciatus into his chest.
a swot?” Millicent asked drily.
“Let’s sleep then.”
Draco’s eyes widened. The idea alone sounded terrifying, yet Harry seemed to take it rather calmly. Once more Draco was equally amazed and horrified by how used Harry was to being put in extremely dangerous positions. Reminding himself that this was only the first part according to Harry, he shoved the familiar feeling of protective worry aside.
“Harry? Harry are you up?”
of them either.”
Hermione was still studying him with obvious surprise on her face. After a few more seconds, she seemed to catch herself again and gave him an impressed look, saying, “Harry, that’s N.E.W.T. level magic.”
Draco didn’t look too happy, but he nodded. Before leaving, however, he pulled Harry close once more, giving him a rather passionate kiss. Severus wasn’t sure whether he should look away or not.
Harry kissed him instead of answering. He’d never been the best with words, and although his eloquence was improving steadily, some things were just easier to put into a kiss than into words. Draco hummed happily, and when they parted again his silver eyes were glazed over. Harry felt that someone should be proud of his self-control for not immediately snogging Draco again.
Why would a— someone of such a noble family be employed as a guardian?”
To be honest: That one was a pain to write. For some reason conversations just didn’t sit right and I’m still not sure if I’m entirely happy with it. There were so many things I could’ve put in here, but none of it felt quite right, so I didn’t. Perhaps it’s just that the atmosphere of it got to me, because I imagine sitting there with Dumbledore to be rather uncomfortable for everyone, given the current situation. Either way, there it is, hopefully the next one is a little lighter.
She nodded and pulled him into a quick embrace, obviously taking him by surprise—judging by the way his eyes widened. He straightened quickly, looking over at Remus and giving him a quick nod for a goodbye.
Harry gave him a blinding smile as he unbuckled his belt, popped open the button of his pants and lowered the zipper with astonishing speed. They certainly had gotten some practice at undressing each other, that much was evident. Draco reached out to free Harry’s erection as well, but Harry pushed his hands away and shook his head. He grabbed Draco’s face and gave him a searing kiss—and then promptly sank to his knees.
“This one is from the Basilisk in second year,” said Harry, pointing at the higher one. “And this one is from when Wormtail cut me to take my blood for the potion that revived Voldemort.”
“They’re all just cowards. Putting all the responsibility on one person to have an excuse to look away and hide, staying safe with their families. Convenient, to task an orphan, someone with no family of his own to protect. Except I
“Harry, I’m going to— I’ll—” Looking down, he tugged on Harry’s hair to pull him off, but Harry resisted, moving down Draco’s shaft again—and then it was too late and Draco was coming. Harry sputtered a little, but managed to swallow most of it, which was so unexpectedly hot that Draco had to close his eyes again. Harry kept his mouth on him throughout Draco’s orgasm, only pulling back once it had ebbed away completely, wiping his lips with the back of his hand as he got to his feet.
“Are you even listening to me?”
“I’ll go, we can do Occlumency after dinner.”
if Harry kept flustering him like this. Sure, they were sort of counting on that, but now that it was actually happening Draco was suddenly anxious all over again.
“They won’t be happy,” Draco stated flatly.
“Yeah, something like that,” Harry admitted with a shrug. “He
“Neither do I,” admitted Severus.

He opened the tattered copy of
“I just realised that I don’t have my vault key with me,” Harry said, giving them a sheepish smile. “I haven’t been to Gringotts in a while, Remus withdrew some money for me to buy food and essentials for Grimmauld Place, I think the key is still with him. If you apparate me back I can get it.“
“Wow, you— You’ve changed, mate. What happened? Or is it a glamour to avoid the gawking masses? Merlin knows they’re even staring at
“I am just trying to understand, Severus. Why would you suddenly refuse to talk to him? He’s your son!” Narcissa argued.
on him?”
Harry looked thoughtful, and he didn’t respond for a long while. Severus felt himself growing tenser by the second. Eventually, Harry breathed deeply once, before he finally replied, “Alright. Thank you for telling me.”
a vicious voice in his mind reminded him, and he pushed the thought away.
“Mmhm.”
But Potter was gone, leaving Draco alone in the hallway once again.
“He shared his ‘concerns’ with me,” Harry replied, not meeting Draco’s eyes.
to me. It was a rather novel experience. He explained some stuff about Hogwarts to me, about the houses, and yeah, there I let his prejudice influence me, with how badly he talked about Slytherin. You came into our compartment and I recognised you, remembering that you were so sure you’d be a Slytherin, feeling so superior about it, and all I could think was that I didn’t want to end up living with people like Dudley again. So when you offered your hand in friendship, I refused, because I had just gotten away from a place where people looked down on me, I didn’t want to surround myself with that again. I’m sorry I judged too quickly, I truly am, but—”
Harry laughed and nodded, before quickly slipping into the room, his eyes on Draco until the door fell closed. Only then did he turn to look at Remus’ wolf form again. Doing his best impression of Padfoot, Remus cocked his head questioningly, hoping that Harry would understand what he wanted to know. He didn’t. Or maybe he did and just wanted to avoid answering, because he said nothing at all, he merely chuckled as he settled down on Remus’ bed.
Harry gave him a bashful smile and nodded his agreement. “Yeah, no argument there, that was terrible. Let’s just forget it ever happened. Because it didn’t.”
Harry wasn’t sure why that made him feel so odd. Maybe it was the fact that he hadn’t even thought of the boy as
Draco sure knows how to make an entrance, doesn’t he? Luckily Harry knows all the best hiding spots in Grimmauld Place now, and boy there are quite a few. Now let’s just hope he comes to face the world again sometime soon, but knowing how stubborn Harry can be, I wouldn’t count on it.
He returned her smile and shook his head. “I’ve suspected for a while that the Dark Lord might rope Draco into his plans, should Lucius displease him again. I’m only glad that it is not too late to assist you both. However, I must ask you to swear an Unbreakable Vow that enforces your discretion, regarding anything you learn while under our protection, and ensures that you will not betray any of us—a necessary precaution, I’m afraid.”
After lunch, they settled in the drawing room, where two formerly separated seating areas had been rearranged to form a single larger one. A pile of wrapped presents lay waiting on a table by the grand piano. Draco was once more impressed with how spacious Grimmauld Place was, belying its outside appearance. Perhaps there were extension charms on the rooms, the house was a Black residence after all.
“Draco, their family name was Gaunt.”
. If the slimy git hadn’t been so unpleasant for the past five years, maybe Harry would’ve been more amenable to the idea.
Severus nodded and pulled his wand from his sleeve as he got into position where Remus usually stood. He’d watched enough of their fights to know approximately how they usually went down. Nevertheless, he found himself somewhat nervous. He hadn’t actively fought in a while, his high-ranking position among the Death Eaters spared him of having to participate in most raids.
By the time he’d finished his letter to his mother so it was ready to be sent in the morning and put it on the bedside table, his dorm mates had settled down in their beds as well. He heard soft snores coming from Vince’s bed. With a sigh, he drew the curtains around his bed, threw up muting charms to keep Vince’s snoring out and got comfortable under the Slytherin green sheets. Staring into the darkness, he lay awake for a long time.
“Yes, my lord?”
Their conversation was cut short by the chiming charm announcing dinner, and they swiftly made their way downstairs. It was only when his eyes met Severus’ that Remus remembered the earlier incident in the bathroom.
Harry blinked, momentarily forgetting his confusion and rising anger.
Harry Potter was supposed to be
“Come on,” Harry said, trying to get rid of the sudden anxiety welling up in him that they might have made a mistake and ruined Remus’ potion, which would have disastrous consequences.
“Just two years ago you agreed with me on letting him participate in the tournament.“
“Sorry!” Severus yelped again, and finally had the mind to retreat back into his room, pulling the door closed.
“Would you look at that, Saint Potter is gracing us with his presence again,” Draco drawled.
That stung, for some reason. Potter hadn’t called him
At Harry’s glare, he quickly raised both his hands in the air defensively. “I’m not going to insist on a conversation you don’t want to have, relax. Just hear me out, please.”
Immediately, Harry tensed and his hand practically flew down to grab Draco’s. Draco froze.

everyone here, I thought you’d be alright with people knowing—”
in him? No, absolutely not, he quickly reined himself in. Better not to assume, better not to speculate. They were just becoming friends, and they were both responsible for Harry. Throwing ambiguous sexual attraction into the mix sounded like a supremely bad idea.
“I came as fast as I could. The Dark Lord is displeased with the night’s events and demanded his followers’ presence until mere minutes ago. What exactly is so urgent?” He kept his voice steady, unwilling to show just how exhausted he was.
As the month now rapidly neared its end, Remus reminded them that they’d have to go to Diagon Alley to buy their school books soon. Harry only narrowly kept himself from throwing a minor tantrum when all three adults were adamant that Harry and Draco could not risk being seen together and they’d have to go separately. Resigned, he eventually agreed to Hermione’s request to go together a few days before term started. Draco convinced Narcissa to at least go on the same day, even if they had to keep their distance.
“I was planning to, yesterday, if the demonstration of the potion went well. But then—”
“But you didn’t know, you couldn’t have known. And, somehow, despite not knowing, you freed me.”
Draco gasped and the wrecked sound of his voice went straight to Harry’s cock.
he remembered, stifling a groan. It was going to be a very long day.
“Well, now that we’ve…resolved things, there shouldn’t be anything to keep you from coming downstairs anymore. Or was there another reason why you went into hiding yesterday?”
All those thoughts shot through Remus before the door had even fully opened. Severus had seemingly just come home from his meeting with Albus, looking deep in thought, until—
“He’s right, Draco.” Harry cringed under the glare Draco gave him. “I hate it, too, you know I do! But he’s right. If there’s a Death Eater at Hogwarts it’s probably a Slytherin, and if they see that you’re with
Draco smiled to himself and tightened his arms around Harry. They had each other now. He was just drifting off to sleep when Harry spoke up into the darkness again.
The concerned looks on both his and Narcissa’s faces only deepened when Harry recounted how he’d heard voices throughout second year, which turned out to be the Basilisk from the Chamber of Secrets. The only thing that momentarily distracted Draco was Harry’s admission that they had broken into the Slytherin common room with Polyjuice Potion.
With a flick of his wand, Potter sent the book flying narrowly past Draco’s head.
1. Sev’s reaction to Harry’s inheritances, because back when Harry found out about that they were very much not talking about personal things.
“Do what?”
He had a plan at least. They had agreed that it would probably be better for the Weasleys to just
“We’re going to Diagon Alley, do you want to come along?” Harry asked so innocently that Draco had to hold back a snort.
Draco turned to him immediately, whining, “Professor, Potter is trying to attack me!”
Harry cocked his head in surprise, but seemed relieved. When they entered, a blue-robed goblin greeted them immediately.
“What else do you want me to say?” Harry countered dryly.
I hope you enjoyed it and are ready for Part 2: Hogwarts. I posted a
his father.”
“That’s none of your concern,” Severus answered curtly, hoping Draco would just let it go. Then a thought struck him. Lupin had offered him to take up residence at Grimmauld Place. Grimmauld Place was big enough to house two more people.
Remus laughed and shook his head. “No, nothing went up in flames. Harry did make the ground explode under my feet, though. You should have words with your son about knocking over the elderly.”
But now his father was gone, now it was easy to see the truth. Back then he’d been right there, judging Draco at every turn. And Draco had

Severus wasn’t at breakfast. It would have worried Harry if he hadn’t been thoroughly distracted by the arrival of their O.W.L. results. Draco blanched at the sight and Harry felt oddly reminded of Hermione by how serious they both seemed to take their grades. Nevertheless, he had to admit that he himself was nervous, too, as he turned the letter in his fingers for the third time without opening it.
They stayed like that for long moment, before Narcissa slowly extracted herself out of Harry’s arms, causing Severus to move away again. She looked at Harry, her eyes red from crying, and gave him a sad smile.
“Some of us have dignity, Parkinson,” Blaise drawled, but Draco saw the twitch of his lips that betrayed his urge to laugh.
He was…attractive.
“How about you start with why
This wasn’t going to be pretty.
He gave a sharp laugh and replied, “As if Albus would’ve let me go anywhere he couldn’t keep a permanent eye on me. He speaks of trust, but let’s be honest; Albus doesn’t trust anyone besides himself. Have you spoken to him about the mission he gave me?”
Millicent snickered and Blaise rolled his eyes.
and so confusing. The only thing he knew was that he couldn’t go back to Potter ignoring him completely, not when everything in Draco was just yearning to get that tension between them back so they could break it again.
“No, of course not.”
“There’s just
“He is a wonderful boy. I must admit that it is good to know that someone with parenting experience is looking out for him—no offence, Remus.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry considered that for a moment. He wasn’t particularly fond of house-elves, and having Kreacher here was only necessary because he knew too much about the Order to be freed. Bringing Narcissa’s elves to Grimmauld Place would be far too risky. Still, he couldn’t very well ask Narcissa to free all her house-elves just so they weren’t stuck at Malfoy Manor by themselves.
Now though, he had all the time in the world, especially since Draco had somehow convinced Harry to go on a shopping spree in Diagon Alley. While he was reluctant to let Harry wander around in public, he had to admit that their argument of him being barely recognisable without his scar was valid, and the chance of being attacked in the middle of Diagon Alley was comparably low. It really would do his cub some good to get out of the house, and Narcissa, whom Remus had come to appreciate greatly over the past weeks, was with them. She would never let anything happen to Draco, and Remus had a feeling that Harry was rather growing on her as well. Motherly instinct, he supposed.
Harry didn’t answer that because yes, he would have. After living with Narcissa and Severus for an entire summer, McGonagall wasn’t half as scary anymore. Hell, even Remus had turned out to be rather intimidating when he was angry, and yet Harry hadn’t had any issue with standing up to either of the three.
Harry huffed indignantly, and Remus had to stifle a laugh. Yes, that sounded like Albus. The old meddler had probably already suspected it when he’d insisted that Severus was to give Harry daily Occlumency lessons.
“I’m glad you agree. Either way, my first priority will always be Draco’s and Harry’s well-being—if Albus Dumbledore threatens that in any way, I have no qualms to oppose him.”
“What a ridiculous question, of course I like them,” Draco drawled, but even to his own ears it sounded hopelessly affectionate. “Why didn’t you tell me what you were trying to do? I could’ve helped, I happen to be quite good at charms.”
“I know it looks like a sudden change, but they’ve been here for over a month,” said Harry. “You don’t know them like I do. Draco and I are going to face enough backlash at Hogwarts, I was hoping you wouldn’t be part of it. Just trust me for once”

(See the end of the chapter for
“Quite,” Minerva agreed.
She gave him an approving smile. Her expression turned pensive again when she said, “That leaves you without any options to see Harry. You couldn’t even claim to tutor him in Potions despite teaching Defence now.”
Nevertheless, Harry did want to see Hermione and the Weasleys. He had a lot to tell them. Once more, he wondered how they would take the news that he was Severus’ son. And the news that he was dating Draco Malfoy. He was almost more worried about that second part, since in the first he’d at least not had any say in the matter. Dating Draco, however, was something he chose.
“What’s the problem?” he prodded, unwilling to settle for half-answers.
“Avoiding to be killed is not enough. It is paramount that I die of my own volition; do not ask why,” Albus cut Severus off before he could even begin to speak, “you will not receive an answer. Trust me that it is important. Perhaps we can solve one problem with another, seeing how Voldemort already tried to task you with my murder. You must kill me, Severus. Before this curse does.”
Both Harry and Draco shook their heads.
Harry kissed him and Draco’s mind went blank for a second, before a by now established reflex kicked in and he returned the kiss fervently. When they broke apart again they were both a little breathless.
“No, it definitely shouldn’t,” Remus agreed. “Besides, we won’t spend every free second with each other, unlike Harry and Draco we’re not sixteen anymore.”
“Oh, just that I’d rather not include any dark arts in the DA lessons,” Harry replied with a shrug.
for eleven years. Fresh fury shot through Severus, making his nerves tingle. He should’ve let the old man die from his cursed hand. Severus stood, prepared to march over into the library, reanimate the man forcibly and demand an explanation for it all, but Narcissa swiftly blocked his way.
“Yeah, people that are able to get a date,” Ginny explained, and Harry burst out laughing. “We have to protect each other from all the grief those sad, single babies are giving us.”
He had been thinking about this nonstop since their encounter on the train. Harry’s hands tangled in his hair.
The image of Harry on his knees in the train flashed through his mind, and he couldn’t help a moan of his own. He swallowed Harry deeper, trying not to let his teeth graze the sensitive skin.
Severus chuckled and shook his head. “I have no doubt he could, but he wouldn’t. Albus cares about his reputation too much to resort to cruelty.” His expression sobered. “Nevertheless, this is of significant importance, particularly to the two of you,” he continued, pointing at Harry and Draco.
“Harry!”
Severus frowned slightly. “Perhaps you’re right—”
“No, I’m fine. I want to know everything.”
“Alright, fine!”
Still nine fifteen.
“Molly, he can’t be,” Minerva cut in. “Harry’s magical signature shows no signs of any creature magic. It would be unmistakable.”
give in to those memories and fantasies, when the others could be back any—
Harry blushed.
“Mr Malfoy, what choices have you made regarding your courses?” he asked silkily. He already knew, of course. They had discussed it back at Grimmauld Place one evening after one of their chess competitions.
The atmosphere at the table wasn’t as tense as it had been the day before, but it was still a far cry from relaxed.
After spreading the books on his desk, he paused. He hadn’t written to Ron and Hermione in a while. In fact, he hadn’t written to them since that first explanatory letter, which was almost three weeks ago now.
“Well, you were very convincing,” Harry retorted. “Why won’t you tell me?”
Straightening a little, Theo stuck out his chin defiantly and responded, “Then he’s as much of a fool as you are if you don’t even consider the potential benefit of joining Potter’s little club.” Both Pansy and Millicent gasped. “My father may consider him inferior as a half-blood, but anyone with a brain can see that he knows what he’s doing when it comes to defence.”
The Dark Lord retreated from his mind and Severus relaxed marginally. It was a fleeting relief, because the next thing he knew was that he was thrown against the wall and bound by black ropes shooting from the Dark Lord’s wand. The look of wild insanity in those red eyes promised nothing good, and suddenly Severus found himself afraid for his life.
get used to the feeling of Harry’s body against his, the heat, the smell, the taste of his skin and lips and tongue, the sound of his voice when he was all hot and bothered and needy, asking Draco to touch him. Despite their mutual enthusiasm, however, they had taken things comparably slow. It had taken them at least five attempts until they even managed to get completely naked before they both came. They had failed again the next time.
“No, no, you explained it wonderfully, I just have to process it properly. I’ll go downstairs real quick, I need a snack,” he declared as he got out of his chair. “Do you want anything from the kitchen?”
They fell silent then, watching as the debate about the snake’s name narrowed down to a choice between constellation names, as was traditional for the Black family, or names related to the snake’s own nature. Soon there were only two names left to choose between: Iris, because of the rainbow reflections created by the snake’s skin, or Cassiopeia. They couldn’t seem to agree on either of them though.
Draco gave an indignant huff, but decided not to argue and instead sprinted up the stairs to his room, to get a temporary outfit for Harry. It didn’t take him long to make a choice. Even though Harry was noticeably paler than he’d been before, his skin was still significantly darker than Draco’s, with a warmer, caramel undertone that he must’ve gotten from his mother, so most of Draco’s robes were obviously too cool toned for him. Black would have to do for now. Just as he wanted to go over to Harry’s room, Remus stepped into his path and Draco skidded to a halt.
“Are you alright?” And now he sounded concerned, brilliant.
“You’ll get the hang of it,” Harry encouraged him.
-thing was mixed into everything, he wasn’t exactly sure how he felt about that knowledge. He supposed it was necessary, but he couldn’t help but feel a twinge of worry. They had gotten closer over the past week. Partially, it had happened because Harry just really appreciated their discussions about healing magic and Severus’ calm, reassuring insistance that Harry would do well with it. Partially, though, the sudden shift between them was due to Harry’s own shift in attitude. After all, if he was able to forgive Draco Malfoy after five years of vicious rivalry, how could he deny his
“Harry?” he hissed under his breath. His bracelet pulsed and the invisible hand around his wrist tightened. Of course Harry would sneak around under his damn Invisibility Cloak.
It was both heartbreaking and oddly soothing to leaf through letter after letter from his mother; letters in which she told Sirius about Harry, about how he was already flying on a toy broom on his first birthday or how he’d just said his first word. Then, there were letters from his— from James, talking about how he missed leaving the house, but how idyllic family life was, how Harry loved playing with the cat. James might not have been Harry’s real father, but he’d loved him.
“Nothing important, at least,” Harry amended, then sighed when Dumbledore’s eyebrow twitched the tiniest bit upwards and added, “It’s a bit bothersome to get around with everyone staring at me and whispering behind raised hands as if I was blind and deaf to their gossip. But otherwise everything is just fine.”
“How can you be sure?! For fuck’s sake, how can you just dismiss that possibility without even making sure that you’re right in your assumption? Do you have any idea how unfair this is to Harry? All his life he was alone, wanting nothing more than a family, and you
Harry thought stubbornly.
Albus sighed and shook his head. “Now, I’m unsure what caused this, but much more unsettling than his change in appearance is his change in magical signature. You’ll see that it is quite drastically different to what it used to be. As we all know a magical signature doesn’t simply change. It is a wizard’s essence, more unique than a fingerprint—it is
The mention of his name pulled Remus’ attention back to Harry’s speech just as every head in the room turned to look at him. Several of the older students seemed to remember him well enough, and he was pleasantly surprised to see mostly smiling or neutral faces. Apparently him being a werewolf hadn’t completely ruined their memory of him as a teacher.
Guilt once more twisted his insides as he thought about the years he’d spent tormenting his own son, effectively wasting the boy’s potential.
“What do you think?” he asked idly, as he strolled to stand in front of the large mirror in the fitting area.
“Yes,” Draco responded, “I survived.”
Remus had to resist the urge to go and check on the man sleeping in the next room. Severus’ blood-soaked return had shaken them all up quite a bit, Harry especially. He hadn’t spoken much during dinner, although Remus had been glad to see that his appetite was undeterred. Afterwards, he had insisted on staying with Remus, as if something terrible would happen if he left his side. Remus couldn’t help the slight feeling of guilt nagging away at him. His condition was making everything harder again.
AREN’T THEY ALL JUST PRECIOUS? LIKE, ALL OF THEM? (Maybe except Ron at this point, but he’ll grow up soon enough, this isn’t a Ron bashing fic.)
“Then he yanked Merope by her necklace and held that in Ogden’s face, screaming that the necklace was from Slytherin, that they were his last living descendants.”
He trailed off and buried his face in Draco’s neck again.
“Well, we have more than enough evidence to accuse them of child abuse, both in the wizarding world and with the Muggle authorities. They know nothing yet of Harry’s newfound family, in fact, they might still suspect him to return home any day. They wouldn’t think to hide condemning remnants of Harry’s presence there, and once the authorities are at their door it would be too late. With enough evidence, they would be deemed unsuitable to look after a minor. We can take their son from them.”
“I thought it was best not to discourage you with the odds,” Dumbledore replied placidly.
As his mother went downstairs to prepare dinner, Draco busied himself with putting Harry’s new clothes away into the closet, not even filling it by half. By the time he reemerged Harry was immersed in a conversation with Remus who must’ve heard them return, and Draco decided not to disturb them, going to his room to sort his own purchases instead. He was barely finished when his mother’s chiming charm rang through the house, calling them down to dinner.
As every year, he had applied for the Defence Against the Dark Arts post, but he had never heard back from Albus. He didn’t need to; he knew the answer would be no. The reasons behind Albus’ stubborn refusal were beyond Severus, but he knew better than to prod. Unlike Harry, he had no leverage to get the old meddler to tell him things.
Draco smiled, then quickly added, “You’ll get your actual gift tomorrow, but I wanted to give you this in private—”
idea you’ve ever had.”
“It’s certainly better than Iris,” replied Draco.
Narcissa looked at him thoughtfully. “I can barely believe that, but I have to admit that he is acting very unusual and it doesn’t match his previous behaviour at all. Have you tried to talk to him again since?”
The door clicked and opened, then closed again. Draco was alone. He let out a shaky breath, trying to compose himself, to get a grip on his emotions bubbling up in his gut, to shove down the impulse to just follow Harry instead of going back to his friends.
“Fine,” he conceded. “I’ll talk to him, soon. First we have to survive tomorrow, without casualties if possible.”
And his
“He’ll sleep for a while, but he’ll be as good as new once he wakes up. You did wonderfully, Harry. You saved his life most likely, we wouldn’t have been able to treat any of those wounds without your spell.” She gave him a warm smile, before unexpectedly pulling him into a hug. She felt much softer than he’d expected. “Let’s go downstairs and have something to eat, you need to get some nutrients in you after all this.”
Harry’s breath caught and he moved closer until he could peer inside to see her standing in front of the table, hands on her hips, looking quite irritated. He couldn’t see Severus.
“I do, sir. For my own schedule, Wednesday afternoon would be ideal, but I suspect that other years have classes during that time, correct?”
Grabbing Harry’s hand, Draco got up from the table and marched out of the kitchen, tugging a mildly confused but smiling Harry along behind him. Severus stared after them, incredulously.
It wasn’t lost on Severus that she had omitted him completely, not even giving him the courtesy of assuming that he was an insufficient guardian—no, her omission made it clear that she didn’t consider him one of Harry’s guardians at all.
“It got worse when I started to display accidental magic,” he said ruefully. “I didn’t understand what I was doing, because I didn’t even know magic existed, so I just tried to hide anything odd that happened around me as best as I could. It didn’t really work most of the time, so I spent a lot of time in my cupboard, only to be let out to go to the bathroom twice a day. At least, with missing so many of my classes, I didn’t have to deliberately fail tests anymore to avoid getting better grades than Dudley. And then my Hogwarts letter arrived, which was its own brand of disaster.”
“Only me?”
Then Minerva’s brows furrowed in a frown. “How did Potter take it?”
Snape’s scowl deepened.
Severus gave him a flat stare. “Frankly, it was less of a change than anticipated. I have you to thank for that, being the spoiled little brat that you are, you’ve thoroughly prepared me for fatherhood. Besides, Harry isn’t a toddler, it’s not like he needs a caretaker.” His lips twitched when Draco rolled his eyes. “It does feel a little strange to be called Dad, I suppose.”
It took barely more than a heartbeat before the twins enthusiastically proclaimed their desire for cake, and the atmosphere in the room shifted immediately. Draco decided that the twins were his favourite Weasleys—he could overlook that they’d drawn their wands earlier, the reaction wasn’t completely unwarranted after all—when they lamented loudly that they had all but forgotten to give Harry his present, reminding everyone that this was supposed to be a celebration. If they all actually cared about Harry, that should hopefully keep them in check for the rest of the day. In a flurry of movement, countless gifts were pulled out of bags and pockets and passed towards Harry—who promptly handed them all to Draco’s mother and she swiftly added them to the pile in the back of the room.
“Get out of my way,” he hissed, green eyes flashing. Draco’s heart was beating wildly as his insides began to coil in a familiar feeling of anticipation.
It was getting harder and harder to stay pleasant around the man the more he learned about him and his decisions. The memory of Harry’s story flared in Severus’ mind and he had to take a few deep breaths to calm himself. It wouldn’t do any good to fly off the handle.
“I wanted it to be finished,” Harry defended himself.
“At the end of last year I told you about the prophecy. Now, I believe you are ready to receive some deeper information about the man you are destined to destroy.”
Meanwhile Draco had handed his letter to Narcissa, watching her anxiously as she unfolded it. A smile spread on her face.
. Harry couldn’t remember ever being so aware of someone’s magic as he was right now, watching Draco’s core pulse and shift. It felt oddly familiar to him, giving him an odd sense of comfort he couldn’t quite parse; as though he’d always known exactly what Draco’s magic felt like, he’d just never explicitly noticed.
if he heard him.
It merely showed how talented the four founders had really been, and how much effort they’d put into the spells imbued in the castle when building the school.
The previous day had been spent packing and finishing up last preparations. At Harry’s request, Narcissa had given him a haircut; while Harry had liked it longer it didn’t do anything to cover his scar that way, and he wasn’t keen on having it on display outside of Grimmauld Place. Afterwards, Harry had skipped both his practice session with Remus and his Occlumency lesson with Severus, in favour of staying in bed cuddled up with Draco.
“Fuck, Draco, I’ll— I—
looking?
he replied hesitantly. “
“Yeah, I gathered as much,” Harry spat. There it was. The anger Severus had been expecting. “It shouldn’t matter, though.”
“We want to go out, Prof— er, Remus, to Diagon Alley, for new robes,” Draco managed, stumbling over the man’s name. He really hadn’t talked to him all that much in the three weeks since his arrival. Maybe it was time to change that, especially now that Harry and him had made their relationship somewhat public—there hadn’t been much of a point in trying to deny it after last night.
“When was the last time you saw her?” Minerva asked, making him scowl.
Narcissa shook her head.
“He showed me a memory. He showed me Voldemort’s mother.”
It was a very strange feeling, a mixture of a pulling sensation paired with a warm tingle spreading out from his chest. The glowing shape in front of him was blindingly bright and
Draco suppressed an amused snort when Severus brought up non-verbal spells. Harry was going to absolutely love this. Admittedly, Draco was rather looking forward to it as well. With Harry’s encouragement he’d begun to try non-verbal magic himself throughout August and had made steady progress.
Morning came far too soon, and Draco would’ve loved to tell everyone to bugger off and just keep Harry in bed with him all day. He was so
“Maybe.”
Harry suppressed a sigh. Did he want to listen to two hours of continuous lament? No, no he didn’t.
“She’s a Death Eater,” Harry spat.
“No!” he protested out loud. It didn’t reappear.
Draco studied him for a long moment and Harry felt uneasiness creep up on him.
“It’s a matter of practice, as most things are,” Severus replied as neutrally as possible.
Severus barely spared him a glance when he joined him in the lab, moving around the neatly organised station Severus was working at to set up his own further down the counter.
“You said you don’t hate him anymore, but do you actually want him to be your father? To act like he’s your father, to treat you like a son?” Narcissa prodded.
Draco buried his face in Harry’s shoulder again, clearly not in the mood to wake up yet. For a while Harry indulged him, running his hand through Draco’s hair and gently massaging his scalp as he continued to doze peacefully, but eventually the clock was creeping towards nine and there really was no good excuse to stay in bed any longer.
“Fine, fine, I did,” Draco conceded. “When does the DA start?”
“That, I’m afraid, is for your ears only.”
“Thank you so much,” he whispered before letting her go again.
“As you may recall, Dumbledore wants you to learn Occlumency. I suspect you are now aware how important this skill is for you to learn, unless you wish to repeat events such as those at the Department of Mysteries.”
Draco’s jaw dropped and his eyes widened almost comically. Harry smiled.
Potter had stayed at the centre of it all, as always, surrounded by friends and admirers, golden. And by
For some reason, that hurt more than the fact that Snape himself hated him. For almost sixteen years, Harry had built an image of James—
The anger increased tenfold. Severus struggled to force it down, to keep his face neutral as he felt his trust in the headmaster erode a little further.
As always I hope you enjoyed it and thank you for reading <3
Remus spread his hands to say, “there you go,” and sat back with a smile. She rolled her eyes but gave him a smile in return. Then her expression turned thoughtful again.
Harry James King-of-Melodrama Potter is ready to spend the rest of his life in that room, but at least him and Severus are talking now… kinda. And at least he has books to keep him company, healing sure does sound fascinating.
Severus frowned again, his worry growing by the second. For a moment, he was tempted to simply grab Draco’s arm and push up his sleeve, see for himself whether he was too late already. He controlled himself.
I’ve wanted to be with you? Do you really think I would drop you just like that?”
talk about Harry—because that’s what he’d always done. Time to change tactics, then.
to produce a Patronus. That’s highly advanced magic—N.E.W.T. level magic—and he successfully taught third years. Say what you will, but he seems to be a competent teacher.”
“Damn right it doesn’t,” Draco agreed. “I’ll beat your arse next time, Potter.”
, it would be too late and Potter would get past him and be gone. Blindly following his first impulse, he closed the distance between them, grabbed on to Potter’s shirt, spun him around and pushed him hard into the wall next to the open door.
One look into the man’s face was enough for Harry to know that he was absolutely not going to drop it. He was steeling himself to summarise the worst, when Remus saved him.
“Oh man, I don’t even have that textbook,” Ron lamented.
The room they had repurposed as a potions lab was clouded in steam. A large counter, transfigured from a desk, stood right in the middle to be accessible from all sides. The walls were lined with shelves filled with ingredients in countless vials, jars, bowls and bottles, along with an impressive collection of finished potions, carefully labelled in Severus’ sleek writing and sorted by purpose and alphabet.
He glanced at the parchment again and lifted his brows in surprise.
“Well, that is absolutely unacceptable, we’re going to Diagon Alley right fucking now,” Draco declared, pulling Harry off the couch enthusiastically.
Harry shook his head and tried not to feel guilty about lying to his friends. It was necessary.
“And because you look like him,” Draco supplied, earning himself a glare from both Harry and Narcissa.
Then again, everything had been absurd since the fight at the Ministry. Once more the thought that maybe they had accidentally messed with some old, weird magic inside the Department of Mysteries flitted through Harry’s head. Maybe they had actually fucked up reality somehow and that’s why everything was suddenly upside down.
“You already had a crush on me, don’t even try to deny it now.”
“A ring,” Dumbledore answered weakly, pulling something out of his robes and showing it to Severus. Harry couldn’t see it from where he was standing, but before he could go closer, Dumbledore had already closed his fingers around it again. The sound of steps announced Draco’s arrival in the doorway, looking confused.
“No, I don’t think so,” he quipped back, flashing Potter a grin.
“That question has a rather…multifaceted answer. As you know, from your unfortunate trip into my Pensieve, there was no love lost between James Potter and me. My early years at Hogwarts were ruined by his so-called pranks. It was never-ending, and as much as I respect Albus, his favouritism towards the Gryffindors allowed them to get away with things you’d be
“Why do you have to be killed in the first place?” Harry asked. “Why not live as long as possible until the curse runs its course? Are you even sure it can’t be removed? There might still be a way to heal you.”
The thought made Severus uncomfortable. They considered Harry their child, both of them. What claim did he really have on Harry amidst experienced mothers and with all his negative history with Harry? Perhaps Molly’s attitude towards him wasn’t entirely unfounded.
He looked around in the room as he sat down. Severus had not brought much, the most prominent thing being a potions set sitting in the corner behind the door. When he turned back to Severus, he found the man looking at him expectantly. Right.
He blushed, but countered, “Can’t Kreacher help you?”
Slughorn moved around the classroom, inspecting each potion individually. When he reached Draco’s cauldron his eyebrows shot up.
“He doesn’t hate you, I know he doesn’t,” said Draco. “Every time I talked to him and you came up in the conversation he only had good things to say. He sounded like he wanted to be closer to you, actually.”
“The upper rooms are wonderful. The room I’ve chosen now is the one I used to sleep in when I visited as a girl. I must say it looks much better now,” Narcissa replied, probably going along with this pointless conversation for Harry’s sake, which he was grateful for.
. A snarky response was already on the tip of his tongue when he managed to control himself. “Alright.”
“May I come in?”
“You are
“Harry,” she said gently, putting a hand on his shoulder, “do you really think that Remus would abandon you? That Draco would? Or I or Severus?”
A beat of silence passed between them.
“Mmh, yes,” the Dark Lord mused, tapping his lips in contemplation. “Perhaps you are right, it wouldn’t do to risk you completely. I shall find another way to get into Hogwarts. Nevertheless, you disappoint me, Severus.”
Harry just glared at Draco, but both Narcissa and Remus chuckled softly.
“Lucius Malfoy’s actions have nothing to do with Draco and Narcissa and neither of them is a Death Eater. Voldemort—” Everyone, including Draco, flinched at the name. “—had plans to force Draco to take the Mark, so they fled their home. Dumbledore has promised them protection.”
Harry and Draco both stood motionless, staring at the spot from which Severus had disapparated. Taking a deep breath, Harry shook himself, trying to stop his mind from going into overdrive. It would be alright, Severus did this all the time. It was his whole purpose as a spy to go and face Voldemort when he called for his Death Eaters.
As someone with ADHD, I rarely see this aspect of it in any type of media, and really wanted to include it — especially since it does actually occur with canon-Harry in the books, too. It’s an aspect of ADHD that is often underestimated; the inability to wrench yourself away from the thing that is currently fascinating/important to you. There were already hints of this in earlier chapters, when Harry couldn't focus on anything other than healing.
Draco snorted. “Valid.”
“Who is it, Harry?” Mrs Weasley prodded gently, although there was some apprehension in her eyes, as if she wasn’t sure whether she really wanted to know.
As always I hope you enjoyed it and thank you for reading <3
Harry had absolutely no desire to move, not when Draco was curled around him, his blond head nestled into the crook of Harry’s neck, an arm wrapped around his chest and a leg thrown over his thigh. It was still fairly early and Harry wished it would stay early forever so he could stay here, in his bed, cuddled up with Draco. Ever since their trip to Diagon Alley Draco had stayed in Harry’s room for the night, and Harry hadn’t complained; waking up next to Draco was probably his new favourite part of the day.
was who he was. Who he’d always been — or should have been if not for those blasted charms.
he thought stubbornly, forcing his focus back to Snape, who was giving him a rather odd look. Why was he staring at him so much? He shifted uncomfortably, causing a strand of black hair to fall into his eyes. Right, he didn’t look like himself anymore. Or, well, he hadn’t looked like himself before. Again, he wondered whether the whole world had gone insane, whether they’d inadvertently broken the bloody universe at the Department of Mysteries or something.
Harry had his head in Draco’s lap, entranced in his favourite book—the one in which he’d found that wandless form to heal Severus. Sometimes, Draco wondered if Harry was ever going to read anything else again. But despite his apparent focus on the text, Draco didn’t miss how Harry’s eyes flickered to the clock in regular intervals. They were both waiting for it to strike twelve, for Harry to turn sixteen.
much anymore on a daily basis. But don't worry, they'll keep coming, just a little slower. I also have exams in 3 weeks and have to catch up on uni-stuff. Like, desperately.
“Still, I don’t want you to pick up habits that could cost you your life on a battlefield,” Remus maintained stubbornly, and Harry relented with an eye-roll.
As the minutes ticked by, the duel grew fiercer. Harry’s flood of attacks eventually waned, replaced by an unconventional combination of Lumos Maxima and conjuring a dark fog, effectively blinding Severus. Vanishing the fog, Severus blinked rapidly, trying to dispel the flimmer obscuring his vision. Where the hell was— There.
For a few minutes they sat in a sullen silence, each lost in their thoughts. Eventually, Severus got to his feet with a sigh and went to check on Albus. To his surprise, he found the headmaster awake, sitting at the desk in the library and studying the ring that had cursed him.
I have decided to upload the last few chapters of Part 1 with an actual schedule (whaaat) and so I’ll be posting 29 next Friday and 30 the week after that. However, there’s most likely going to be a bit of a break after those two chapters, so I can build my head start again.
“Look, I don’t like using dark arts any more than you do, but I don’t have a choice, Hermione. I am, unfortunately, the Chosen One. As much as I wish I wasn’t, I am. And that means I’m responsible for ending this war — one way or another. Excuse me if I’d prefer to come out of it alive rather than morally superior. Besides, that talk about dark spells ‘twisting’ you really is rubbish.”
Reluctantly, Draco cracked open an eye, glancing up at Harry. His black hair was a mess, almost as bad as it used to be when he’d been under all those charms, and his eyes were still half-lidded. He was gorgeous. And apparently dead-set on getting out of bed. Rolling his eyes, Draco relented.
