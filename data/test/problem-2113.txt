After lunch, Harry went back to the library only to be told that the three books he had used that morning were still in use by other students. He also had the misfortune of being spotted by Hermione who had him join him in some research for a while. While it was not something he enjoyed Harry did join her not only for a change of pace from the active morning he had but also to see what she was looking into since their classes were all done. It was almost mundane for her as he saw that Hermione was researching ways to Magically repair a person's sleep cycle. Making him guess that since she no longer had the Time-Turner she was trying to fix the damage she had done to herself by using it for almost a whole school year. She had told him, as they waited for everyone to emerge from the passage under the Whomping Willow that the hardest part of using it was sleeping as she could not interact with her other selves meaning she had to find random places around the castle in which to sleep in once she had stayed up too long while using the artifact. "I am rather glad I decided to turn it in for the last week or so I have been having rather strange dreams and have even been sleepwalking when I had been forced to sleep someplace other than my bed," Hermione said without looking up.
"Very well unless they have spent the money it shall be back to you by the end of the day, as for the artifacts that have been taken from you we will have you undertake a Blood Artifact Retrieval," Bonecrusher said making some notes on his parchment. Having never heard of a Blood Artifact Retrivial Harry turned to look at his new guardian.
"Seemed like an overreaction don't you think Batty?" Charity said once the door was slammed in their faces.
"Thank you, Mister Bonecrusher," Harrison said with a small blush as he headed back to the desk and took the bag finding it heavier than it had been after he left his vault.
"Mr. Potter will not be telling us anything for a bit," Madam Pomfrey said having finished examing the still unconscious Gryffindor. Draco did his best not to grit his teeth seeing like most of the staff at the school the Medi-Witch refused to use a student's proper title such as the case with Potter who should be at least referred to as an Heir.
"You will find I can an will. You own a total of 20,000 Pounds to our client and that is before you take in interest. Now I could call for this all at once which would mean I would take control of your business Mr. Vernon but I would rather not," the man said steepling his fingers before him as he stared their all down.
Thankfully before the twins could ask what had happened the girl seemed to wake up making them finally introduce her to the newly bonded mates. "This is Luna Lovegood she lives quite near the Burrow and when Mum started to get on our case we would head over to her place," Fred said as Luna shook their hands.
As the group walked past a window to the grounds a memory of the events from the start of last summer came to George's mind. With a smile, he grabbed the hands of Blaise and his twin and lead them outside. "While I do admit the weather for once is nice enough I don't think we will not be bothered just by going outside Geroge," Blaise said playfully.
"Now see that is why you have such trouble in potions, while many the core classes can be helped along with supplemental readings Potions is different. In the pre-lessons for students who were not from magical families, they would have taught you how to cut and prepare ingredients properly. It is quite impressive that you have never melted a cauldron yet, even more so when you take into account some of the help you got," Draco said blushing a little and rubbing the back of his neck.
"Oh, it is," Lupin said pulling out three different notebooks. I asked my youngest to give me their notes from their History class this week while also getting the notes from a Fifth Year student and even a First Year. Each student has notes dealing with the same exact lesson."
"But why?" Neville croaked out his voice little more than a whisper.
"I don't think I could live with that happening," Harry said seeming not to have heard what Draco had said.
"Merlin you are wearing some snakeskin. That settles it right after breakfast we are going back to our rooms so you can put something that is not diseased on. Afterward, we will set that thing on fire," Ron said moving away from Harry slightly as if afraid the borrowed cloak would get him sick.
"There might be a way," Lupin said but before he could say anything more Professor Dumbledore showed up letting him know his carriage had arrived. Lupin offered a quick apology saying he wanted to get out of school lest he damaged the reputation of the place by just being there once the students let their parents know about him being a werewolf.
"I guess that leaves me," Theodore said.  "I am Theo Nott the Second and I have recently come into an Inheritance of a Submissive Angel.  I also wish to have a quiet life with my eventual Mate and our kids."
There was silence between Granger, Draco, and Longbottom as they got Potter upright and secured between Granger and Longbottom's shoulders, Draco still being too weak at the moment to do the job of carrying the unconscious boy as he limped after the group. Once they reached the Hogwarts grounds proper Draco saw Hagrid drop his crossbow and pull out a large pink umbrella, the oaf sent Draco a look before he aimed the umbrella at the castle and cast a spell that shot a white orb to one of the towers. "Well just wait here," the oaf said keeping a firm grip on Quirell.
"We have to wait for young Heir Bone since it is her results we will be discussing," Bonecrusher said from the table having stayed there to discuss the finding the last Heir being the account manager of the Gryffindor line.
"I didn't know you were an Heir," he said sitting cross-legged on another of the desk.
"Let's see... think of it as one of the Muggle Deities.  Lady Magic is said to be a supreme being for all things Magical and she is said to work with others representing Death, Time, Nature or the Earth itself, Destiney sometimes called Fate, and some believe there is one that stands for Life as well," Charity said and sees the Goblin Healer give a small nod.
"Oh, my son was faking an injury was he?" the elder Malfoy said as he pulled out one of the two letters. "According to the letter that the Gamekeeper sent to the Governors he mentioned that my son needing to be helped to the Hospital Wing due to what the man diagnosed as a heavily sprained ankle and had been clutching one of his sides which means he might have had an internal injury from being blasted into a tree from a letter send from a Miss Granger." Draco's dad then pushed past the Matron and used his wand to cast a spell on his son. As he waited for the results to print out of his wand the man glared at the Matron who tried to go about her duties as she took the tray of Draco's finished breakfast before sending it down to the kitchens and orders some food for Harry.
After the small meeting, the group split into teams of two with Slytherin and Gryffindor teamed up as they went on a scavenger hunt around the Manor set up by Draco's parents.  Harridan found himself teamed up with Pansy while Draco was with Fred, George ended up with Blaise leaving  Neville to team up with Theo.  As the hunt involved clues leading to further hints it gave the teams to get to know each other better.  Harridan was surprised that Pansy had a wicked sense of humor and was not as mean tended to act around Hermione.  Evidently acting out against the other girl due to being slightly jealous of her grades, though as Harridan found out she was pretty smart in her own right.  By the end of the event, Theo and Neville had found the most clues making them the winners gave them the prize of a Mimbulus Mimbletonia and a rare book of Herbology for Neville and several books for Theo who Harridan found out was an even bigger bookworm than Hermione though he made less of a deal about it.
"You know what Draco I think the dinks can wait let's get back to dancing," Harry said standing up and going back to Draco as he used his shoulder to knock Ron aside letting the blonde wrap his hand around his waist again.
"Is what Madam Tonks say correct?" the Goblin asked looking right into Harrison's eyes.
"What about him?" Draco asked back.
"First of all, so you can have all the fact about Harry here is the test we got from Gringotts which I am sure you can see my reasoning for not wanting to involve him at the moment," Lucius said handing over the results and letting his wife skim over the document and saw her eyes widen when it listed as Draco's Godfather being one of four people listed as having money paid to them from Harry's vaults. "Secondly," Lucius said after she was done with the results, "I want us to start a case against the Headmaster in secret. Since he had been able to enchant me and Vansel, and tried to do it to Draco with only the new bond he has with Harry protecting him, I do not want to try to face him again directly yet. I am also not sure it is wise to get Vansel cleansed of whatever the bastard did to him, though I did mention it to the Goblins after I was cleansed so they could do it next time he comes to the bank, even paying for it through our vaults. I think we need to start gathering evidence against the man. Sure we have everything on Harry, but I really don't want to use it unless we have to. I had discussed with Vansel about checking to see if any other students did not receive a full booklist as Harry had. And due to the Goblins having to perform two cleansing in a day to clear up enchantments cast by the man, Prince Bonecrusher himself informed me that he was going to start a bank-wide audit to see if the man was messing with anyone else accounts. If we can find any more evidence involving spells on or messing with the vaults of current students it might be enough to get the board to vote him out of being Headmaster."
," she said before explaining how to find the room within the castle. Having said her part the vision seemed to end leaving Harridan back with just his head underwater at the lake's edge. Lifting his head from the water, which Draco described to him later made it sound like he was Ariel in the Little Mermaid breached the water with his hair laying flat for once, Harridan went over to dry himself off and collect his clothing back from his Alpha. Having no other plans for the day Harridan decided to check to see if the tales told to the Merpeople were accurate as he leads Draco up to the seventh floor. Finding the spot the room was said to appear in Harridan walked back and forth before the wall wanting more than anything to find a nice quiet place for the two of them as well as somewhere they could fly. Harridan stopped when he heard Draco let out a gasp as he turned to see a small door set in the previously bare wall. Pushing it open the pair of Veela Mates found themselves in a large cathedral-sized room with a ceiling way overhead. Pulling Draco into the room Harridan once more pulled off his cloak followed by his undervest and shirt. Once his torso was bare he let out his blue wings for the first time since coming to Hogwarts.
"Fine whatever, you seemed to have made up your mind, but what was that flash when I touched Potter?" Draco asked.
"If one actually looked into when this place was built they would actually find that it was created just shortly after the "ghouls and sprites" moved in which would be against all their natures since those types of creatures prefer buildings that have been inhabited for a while before they move in," George said taking Blaise's hand and leading him further into the abandoned house.
"Hello, Lady Baddling thank you for coming," Bonecrusher said standing from his desk and shaking her hand which only made the woman look even more confused.
"I have a thought if you will," Minerva said with a smile.
"Then I offer you thanks," he said shocking her. "We have been trying to reach Heir Potter for years but our owls keep being sent back. We tried to reach him last year when he arrived with Mr. Hagrid," the goblin said shocking Charity for there should have never been any reason Hagrid of all people should have been with a student to bring them into the Magical World. "But they left before I could reach them."
"Still that has to take a lot of your time I will look for someone else to be my proxy during the school board meetings," Susan said with a smile having no desire to give him power over her vote to him after listening to some of the stuff he had put Harridan in as well as how he handled the duel between Fred, George, and the Fletchers.
(*)  Harrison is unaware if his family has House Elves or if he would ever use them.
"It is not only due to fear that people don't say that name," Bathsheda said placing her hand on his other shoulder. "You see You-Know-Who placed a taboo on that name so that he would be able to find anyone who said it which even allows him to bypass the strongest Wards and protection Magic. That was how he had been able to find many of his greatest foes in the last war before the taboo on the name became public knowledge."
"You know for once I think I am going to try to do it on my own," Harry said with a small smile watching her reaction.
"Greetings Draconis," she said making him roll his eyes at her. He had heard stories of her being flighty and scatterbrained but he had never witnessed it as all he got was the smart and formal cousin that drove him nuts. She had once told him that her persona at the castle was her own version of her Pureblood Mask which she used to find out more about people when they thought she was slightly out of her mind.
"I don't actually know," Charity said with a slight blush.  "Um, Madam Goblin can you answer that question for us?"
"So you know what the Goblins found out?" Harry asked.
"That is not up to you to Molly I have been asked to collect him and I shall," Tonks said giving Harrison's shoulder a comforting squeeze as she led them around Molly to an open grate and Flooed them out of there. Harrison was glad Tonks was with him as they Flooed for he had no actual idea where they were going. Stumbling out of the fireplace he was caught by a solidly built man who appeared to be in his lower fifties with his black mane of hair slicked back and to the side.
"Now see here Harry does not need to do anything from that," Molly Weasley said interposing herself between Tonks, Harrison, and the fireplaces.
Harry did as instructed lifting the ring to his lips and giving it a small kiss before he began to speak without lowering the ring from his face. "
"So what did you change?" he asked.
"She is my Great-Great-Aunt on my mother's side why do you ask?" Draco asked using his wand to attach the medallion he had been working on to the newly awaken Omega's right lapel.
"Well they sent a copy of their results to their Fathers' earlier with no problem, but I think if they try to message them now the message might be intercepted thanks to the crime report from this morning's paper," Blaise said pulling the now taller males to his side.
"Are you sure the students did not just hand you their notes from their First-Year?" Albus said hoping to put an end to this plan to have Binns looked at liking the Ghost as he was, thanks to his enchantments, as it kept the students ignorant from numerous major events. Rather than say anything Remus just smiled as he opened the notebooks and showed the name
Thinking he could use some fresh air Harry left the castle for the Quidditch Pitch to fly around for a bit. He was soon joined by the Weasley twins and Ron, using a school broom, and the four had a pickup game where they were soon joined by other members of the various House teams. The best part, at least in Harry's opinion, was due to them all flying around he was unable to take in anyone's scent during the game male or female. The game only broke up at lunchtime as everyone headed inside to eat and relax for a bit.
"I took a guess at the stuff I marked were provided by Granger was I correct?" As Harry looked over the pages he saw that Draco was correct making him rather angry at Hermione, no wonder she had not wanted to help him in class. He knew that she liked to think of herself as the "Smartest Magical of their Year," but he would never think she would purposely mess with his work.
"I can't honestly say for while his newly awakened Omega side has latched onto my Alpha he has not yet made up his mind about it yet, as far as I can tell," Draco said.
Knowing what he did now Harry tried to use little-used paths to avoid members of the opposite sex on his trip before sliding into place between Ron and Hermione at the table.
After about ten minutes to prove to the Goblin Healers that the man was not somehow faking being knocked out as well as letting the mist being removed from the room, the Goblin Healers entered the room through a hidden door along with one of the walls. They immediately used some magic to strip the human out of his clothing and put him into a specialized robe that would help the Cleasing he was about to receive. Once he was properly attired they floated the blonde Lord onto the Cleansing platform and began to get to work. Every single one of the Goblin Healers and ritualists hoped this would not take as long as the one for Heir Potter having been part of that one before being brought back in time alongside the young human and his Account Manager. It was rather strange that the group was technically performing to Cleansing at the same time one to Heir Potter and now with Lord Malfoy.
"Thanks but can you please give it back," Pansy said a little embarrassed of anyone seeing her first drafts of the clothing she created.
Draco had chosen to start with having Harry help him with some Defensive spells he had been having trouble with. Wishing the session was taking place in the Room of Requirement rather than a classroom near the Potions class, Harry had Draco cast the spells he had been having issues with. While the blonde was able to cast the spells they were not nearly as strong as Harry's was leading Draco to cast them multiple times as Harry walked around him taking in everything. When Harry found the other's body movements were off he would step forward taking Draco's arm in his and guide it through the proper movements, a little surprised at feeling the muscles in the other's arms under his robes. With Harry's help, Draco was able to increase the power of his spells to a more approved level earning the brunette an actual genuine smile from the other.
The next thing Harry knew his pain had started to vanish as Draco pulled him into a tight hug. Harry wanted to fight it not really liking the other but found his body seemed to act on its own as it curled into Draco's warm embrace. "There, there Little One everything is alright now you are safe," Draco said his voice sounding nice and warm and holding none of the scorn or uppity attitude that Harry was used to. Harry found the voice and the warmth of the other's body to be rather comforting as he soon found himself drifting off to sleep.
"Of course we have met young Heir. I helped your parents set up your Heir Vault shortly after your birth. I am Bonecrusher your family's account manager," the Goblin said getting out of his seat and bowing to Harry as Mr. Malfoy let out a small gasp knowing that Bonecrusher was the Prince of the Goblin Kingdon for all of Europe.
"Thank you Silverwing," Bonecrusher said taking the packet and giving it a cursory look before placing it in a pile of other documents on his desk.  "Hello, again Heir Potter.  My name is Bonecrusher and I and my ancestors have been in charge of your accounts since their creation," the well-dressed Goblin said holding out a hand to shake Harry's with.
"I am sorry for not telling you Harry but despite what people say he is still my father," Draco said opening his arms a little as if he was going to hug Harry but did nothing more.
"My uncle locked them in my old cupboard under the stairs," Harry said as he started to gather the items he had been allowed to have in his room in the hopes of leaving the Dursleys.
"I thought of our last session," Draco said quietly as if not wanting Harry to hear.
"Now we will not be learning this the same way I did, which is being exposed to a Boggart in the form of a Dementor. Mostly since to use it, I would have to stay closer to it than anyone else while leaving you all to test your spell work. Besides not knowing where a Boggart is I do not feel liking spending the meeting unconscious," Harry said to some laughs at his joke. "Now the main thing you need to know about casting a Patronus is that it requires you to focus on a happy memory. If that was it, it would not be too hard but you also have to do it while facing the presence of a being who can suck such happiness away. So to make this work I want you to pick your best memory, the moment in which you recall being at your happiest. The difference between a happy memory and your happiest memory, from what I have found, is a factor in if you produce a corporeal or non-corporeal Patronus," Harry explained. He then let everyone take a couple of moments to choose a memory that they thought would work for them.
"Our first year," Draco said arching an eye brow at him reading his confused expression. "Merlin you really have no idea about it do you," Draco said shocking Harry as the blonde messed up his own hair. "Fine take mine for today." His rival than dug out a book the size of a Muggle Young Adult Novel and tossed it at Harry. Harry took a moment to read the title on the red cover before he opened to the fifth page as Draco had requested and began to read it.
"Draco come with me now," she ordered.
"Or they could make it that we have more warning for a Hogsmead visit than two days before," Fred said knowing that was something that irked Oliver who would plan Quidditch Training for a weekend only to have to reschedule when a visit was announced.
"Well you basically confessed your feelings for me, before we sort of got sided tracked," Harry stated.
"No, the library does not have books on most family lines, but due to how famous you are in our world and the Potters being rumored to be an offshoot of the Gryffindor family there would likely be some record in the stacks," Luna said but Harry barely was able to pay attention for his nose was hit by a stench of freshly mowed grass during a drought and freshly produced vomit.
A few days later Susan wanted to punch someone, no strike that she wanted to punch Granger or either of the Fletchers. After she met with the Headmaster, the three kept seeking her out and tried to guilt her, Granger, or bully her, the Fletchers, into having her choose the Headmaster as her Proxy for both the school board and Wizengamot. It was getting so bad she had contacted her Aunty to have her take control of the Hufflepuff seat publicly in the Wizengamot and had her chose to vote for the Gray/Neutral Section. He Aunt agreed to do so though she herself was part of the Light Section. Not wanting to deal with the Headmaster and the others anymore, Susan asked her best friend, and Housemate Hannah to get in touch with her father. While she was slightly confused Hannah wrote a letter that would accompany one wrote by Susan to ask Anthony Abbott to stand in as her Proxy for the Hufflepuff vote during school board meetings. Susan receives a letter of the man's agreement to stand as her Proxy shortly before the deadline given to her by Professor McGonagall and Prince. Not sure if she needed to tell them or Professor Sprout she asked to meet all three to share her decision. Susan was informed that due to Anthony not being part of her house to cast the votes on issues that the board was put forth she would actually have to attend the meetings themselves, since unlike the Wizengamot the school board usually brought up issues and voted on them in the same meeting. Susan at least was informed that so she would not stay up too late for a meeting that they would be moved to take place on a weekend if they could help it.
"No, not F.L.E.W. Floo, F.L.O.O. is a way that Magicals can travel between fireplaces," Mr. Malfoy explained.
"But what if Harry gets sick for wearing it, what if I do?" Ron said and Harry was not sure if he was joking or not. Harry could not help but think that the way his best friend was talking made it sound like a form of Blood Purity talked he always complained Draco would use.
Arriving back at Kings Cross, Harrison got his trunk down the slowest letting the other leave the compartment before him before he left the train. Making it look as if he was still heading back to the Dursleys, Harrison opened Hedwig's cage telling her to fly off until he was alone later that night.  Not knowing if Draco's cousin Tonks or her mother had agreed to pick him up at the station, Harrison rather than heading towards the barrier leading to the Muggle side of the station headed in the direction of Luna who was waiting alongside her father who was dressed in a bright sunflower yellow robe with his hand on his daughter's shoulder. Harrison thought the pair were waiting for him just in case Tonks did not show up. Harrison was halfway to them from where he had gotten off the train before his path was blocked by a woman with black robes and bubblegum pink hair. "Wotcha, Harry. I am Auror Tonks I have been asked to collect you due to what happened a few days ago," the woman said in a loud carrying voice as she place a hand on his shoulder and lead him to the fireplaces set up for families to Floo to and from the platform.
There was not even any struggle to put on their robes in the crowed compartment as most having come from Pureblood families had either Apparated or Flooed into the Magical Platform and were thus already wearing their robes. Knowing that the trio of betrayers would try to get to Harridan once they left the compartment it was decided that Harridan and Draco would leave out the back door, which all Mate compartments had, as the others left the front in a tight packed group making it seem that the two Veela Mates were with them. Draco had almost said no to it as it felt like he was running scared from the trio but as Harridan pointed out it would be rather sneaky of them to pull it off especially if the others at one point separated while the idiots were watching making them wonder where they went.
"So you treat me like shit due to how my Dad acted towards you but want to apologize for sending Voldemort after my parents not due to him killing my Dad but because he killed my Mom," Harry said unable to stop a bit of scorn out of his voice and noticed Snape actually flinched.
"Salutations Luna," Draco responded.
"How strange," Dumbledore said arching an eyebrow at Quirell, "so I take it Quirrell here was responsible?'
"Is this the right place?" a voice said as someone fell out of the fireplace.
"Alright, how and why?" Pansy asked looking among the others and surprising Harry when all she did after noticing Draco holding his hand was arching an eyebrow at them.
"You think I would miss a moment of whatever this is you have got to be kidding me," Pansy said as she sat down on the only other coach in the room and just stared at them making Harridan a little anxious.
The students who had found a scroll appeared in front of them reached forward and began to read it. Most of the students breathed a sigh of relief seeing that the Cleansing Potion had just got rid of a potion they were on for various allergies such as Seamus Finnagin who took Potions so he could safely digest lactose without getting sick. But there were students like Harry who not only saw mention of his Glamour but also a list of various potions and spells he had been put under. Which included Potion-induced loyalty to the Headmaster and Hermione. Numerous Love potions tied to different people who were thankfully canceling each other out. Hatred Potions geared to Dark Cored Magicals, Slytherin House, not to mention the presence of something called a Horcrux. According to the scroll Harry had also had his intelligence dampened and some of his Pareslmough abilities utterly blocked.
"That is correct Blue Jay," Draco said booping Harry on his nose and making Harry give him a shy smile.
"I guess that makes sense," Harry said before asking, "Is there something special about a Life Debt?"
"It is perfectly understandable sir," Bill said.
"Why?  Nothing I read said anything about being able to teleport?" Harry asked.
It did not take Arthur and Remus to end Molly and her brats interfering with their family anymore. Now free of the spells on him Arthur recalled a spell in the Weasley Family Grimoire which would allow a member of the Weasley family to end a Blood Adoption without either having to deal with cleansing or even been around the person(s) that the ritual would be used on. Since his results had shown that Molly had forced him to Blood Adopt her brats he had decided to use the ritual on the pair. Remus had also suggested that he do it for their kids just in case she had Blood Adopted them. As if the Illegal Blood Adoption was not enough it seems that Molly had created some Marriage Contracts for not only her brats but also their kids.
"Alright I will start," George said.  "I am George Fabian Weasley-Prewett.  I share the Creature Inheritance of a Mirror Twin with my brother and my dream is to open up a joke shop.
"St. Mungos is not a person Heir Potter it is a Magical Hospital located in London, and by your question, I take it you had never gone there. Tell me Heir Potter did you have a medical form with your booklist and Hogwarts' acceptance letter?" Mr. Malfoy said.
Ending it here for now as I have no idea what I want to happen next.
As Harry came to his meeting with Draco he had hidden the blonde's cloak in an inside pocket which had helped him block out any bad scents even when it was nowhere near his nose. Finding his way to the stack set aside for the bibliographies he found a table that looked so dusty his aunt would never have let it in the house. But as he got closer he saw the table had an actual Glamor attached to it, shocking him a little. "Oh don't look so surprised Harry this is a special place where Slytherins go to make deals and arrangements with members of other Houses. And since no one usually comes back here we will undisturbed," Draco's voice said from behind him.
Harry was shocked at the question not only for its own sake but for it was the second time Snape had stated his mother's name. "No, I would rather just be left alone yet each year something seems to happen that forces me to act."
"I don't have my own place, having taken up residence at the castle since I started teaching," Charity said rubbing the back of her neck.
"No what?" Harridan asked giving his mate a quizzical look.
"That man," Lucius said clenching his right hand into a fist and looking as if he wanted to use it for once despite being a normally non-violent man.
"I can't they have locked my stuff in my old bedroom under the stairs," Harry said and knew instantly that he had made a mistake as he felt Draco's arms fall away from him.
"In there Professor," Harry said pointing to the door to his old bedroom/cupboard. Seeing another group of padlocks on the door Charity did not use her magic to unlock them but blasted them apart before having Harry pull them out not wanting to take her eyes off the boy's abusive family. Once Harry had all his supplies out of the room she shrunk them and placed them in her pocket before leading Harry to the door to the backyard. There they were joined by Bathsheda Charity gently took hold of Harry's upper arm and looking out of there using Side-Along Apparition. Rather than head back to Hogwarts or taking Harry to get his school supplies Charity took him right to the Ministry to explain to them why she had not only collected Harry but why she used Magic to do so.
"Just knock at the door with our feathered friend on my shoulder and ask to see Harry just to find out how they react," Charity said as she walked around to the front of the house and saw her guess had been right as she spotted the large number 4 on the door.
"So where do we go from here?" Harry asked.
"My pleasure Lord Malfoy," Bonecrusher said with a look that said he guessed what Lucius had had to deal with when he had been out of the bank.
That is enough," Blaise began only to stop as both Fred and George stood from the table.
"Sirius, Lucius, what are we going to do to get him free?" she asked.
*  J.K. never really went into how they transferred their brooms, and I don't see students leaving them at the castle over the summer I can only assume some charm is cast on their trunks to carry them safely.
After his demonstration Kingsley had Harridan explain what he had been thinking about while he cast the spell. Harridan blushed a little making something up about him just spending time with Draco, rather than the truth of his first night at Malfoy Manor when he had cuddled into the Dominant Veela's strong chest wearing some of Draco's old sleepwear having no chance to get some new ones yet. Not that Harridan had got any new sleep clothes yet preferring his Mate's old ones to any they found in any of the stores they had visited over the summer. Draco gave him a knowing smile as if knowing he was not telling the full truth before trying to cast the spell again. This time just like Harridan a corporeal Patronus bust from his wand in the shape of a large falcon who flew around the room and landed on Harridan's shoulder, something that leads to the blonde gaining twenty-five points.
"During a discussion with Professor Lupin, who was the one to teach me the spell, due to what one needs to do to cast the spell it is better to not share the memory unless you are really close to them," Harry lied not wanting to share the memory of his kiss with Draco. "Also just to let you know that a corporeal Patronus will also take the form of an animal which can either represent yourself or some you really love. This is another reason not to share the memory you use for it could lead to having someone know something you wish to keep secret. I have also learned that a person's Patronus can change based on a new understanding of themselves or new love, so do not be alarmed if at some point your Patronus changes."
"What can we do, we have to trust that Dumbledore can get him out or if not him Tonks or Kingsley can bust him out before he is sent back to Azkaban," Arthur said as he and Remus leaned in to watch Sirius being lead away.
"You don't need to go on Harrison," Tonks said gently seeing how agitated the new Omega was getting as she saw him take the medallion off his robes and was holding it so tightly she was afraid it would break the skin of his palm.
Deciding to call it a night after that Harry returned all his old work to his bag as well as his new book, Harry was halfway back to the tower before realized that he really had not gotten any help from Draco on their current assignment for the class. He just hoped that preventing Hermione from changing it would help him get a higher grade and the book would help him prepare his potions in class. To help that out as soon as he got back to Gryffindor Tower he headed up to his rooms and closed his blinds to start reading the book. Due to its size, Harry had been able to finish the entire book that night before going to bed at his normal time. Harry was actually eager to put some of the lessons from the book to use in the next Potion class.
"He was pointing out that thanks to Hermione's so-called help I was turning in bad work," Harry said making the man give a snort.
Rather than having the member of the D.A. face off against each other while casting the spell, as they had done with their earlier meetings Harry had them come up in small groups to test out the spell. The first group to come up was the Weasley twins, the Creevey brothers, Neville, and Cho Chang. Harry could not help but smile seeing the group all cast a corporeal Patronus. There were some gasps as the twins actually created different Patronus, with Fred creating a bird that apart from the color appeared to be a raven, while George's Patronus was a fox. Next to them, the other's Patronus did not seem that impressive other than the fact that they were corporeal. Dennis Patronus had been a beaver, Neville had been shocked to see his Patronus had been a lion cub, Cho's Patronus had been a badger showing Harry that his former crush was still in love with Cedric. While others had not been surprised by Colin's Patronus Harry winced inwardly to see that just like Draco, the younger male had created an owl that looked exactly like Hedwig.
"So you finally dropped that Mudblood trash Severus it was about time," a man with a nose that reminded Harry of Pansy Parkinson said in the memory as he threw his arm around Snape's slimmer form. "You know the Dark Lord could use a man like you with that marvelous skill of Potions you have. You could quickly rise through the ranks and have anything you want even that Mudblood skank," Parkinson said.
Draco's mom had Harry climb into a bed before she started casting various spells. Thinking of Ron's rants that the Malfoys were a dark family, even though Draco's dad had been nothing but helpful and was evidently was his Godfather. Harry asked, "What are you doing?"
"My family," Harry began.
"I am not apathetic that is just my mask to hide what I am feeling but if I share the memory there would be no going back," Draco said staring into the corner of the room.
Harry had another dream with Draco ten days after the original dream as he found himself before the blonde again. "Hello, Blue Jay so did you ask your parents about your inheritance?" Draco asked as without any preamble pulled Harry into his arms as he sat down against what looked like a tree.
Send Help,
"I wish to have either of their parents to come over during our next Hogsmead weekend to take them to Gringotts to get tested just in case Molly had them under any sort of spells or Potions," Blaise said making the twins smile at him in thanks having not thought about that themselves more worried about their parents and older siblings.
In a small apartment located halfway between the British Ministry of Magic and the Quidditch pitch used but the team Puddlemere United a pair of recently married Mates cuddled together. Percy could not stop smiling after receiving the letter of congratulations to his and Oliver's recent tying the knot. Though he had been shocked at the other form which had stated he was not the son of Molly but of Arthur and Professor Lupin. After getting the letter Percy decided next chance he got he would travel to either St. Mungos or Gringotts to get a full diagnostic spell cast on him to see if he had anything other than a memory charm on him, due to the fact that since the twins had still be listed as his younger brothers he would have been old enough to have some slight memory of being with both his real parents. Before he had a chance to go get himself checked out Percy had also received a letter from Arthur about how happy he was for Percy's union to Oliver as well as asking if they could talk and hopefully reconnect. The letter from his bearer had arrived at noon and Oliver had been trying to convince him to meet with the man he had thought as his father all afternoon. Percy had still been unsure if he should trust it at least until around 10:30 PM when he felt the wave of his family magic wash over him leaving him with nothing but feelings of acceptance. As the magic leaves him he suddenly sees the old Weasley family clock in his mind seeing Remus in place of Molly as well as a hand being added for his mate. This vision leads Percy to finally agree to go meet up with his parents with Oliver by his side.
As Harry came back for his second term of his Fifth Year he knew there were going to issues after being told that thanks to the vision he had before Christmas he was going to have to have extra lessons with Snape. But on the second day of classes, it got worse when he went to a meeting with Professor McGonagall about his future plans. It was going well until the Umbitch showed up and while she was her nasty self she had shared that unless he brought up his Potions. He thought it would be easy all he had to do would be to ask Hermione or one of the D.A. to help him in Potions since he was helping them with learning magic. However, after the story of his lessons with Snape which to avoid Umbitch's notice were classed under Remedial Potions no one in the D.A. came forward to help him when he asked. What really annoyed him was Hermione had not offered to help either. He could at least understand Fred and George had said no for they were getting ready for their N.E.W.T.s, yet Hermione since they were in the same class could have volunteered to help him.
"I am through his father's side which would mean that you gain your secondary gender through the Black family," Luna said standing from her chair and moving as far away as she could while remaining in sight and speaking distance of him. "That does mean that if my father and I would move in or check up on you, you would have to be presented with a gift from Draco."
"Ah, yes why did you remove him from the castle Lucious?" Albus asked rounding on Draco's dad.
"Yes I asked and he said yes," Harry said with a small smile.
"If you think just cause Malfoy is helping you rather than Granger will gain you more points in class you can forget it, Potter," Snape said with a sneer.
"Point," Harry said. "Also if you worded it that way I would have most likely kneed you in the crotch. Good going on making that sound the most perverted you could."
"Okay sure I did not like the fact that you chose Weasley over me during our first train ride, but I could not hate you I was envious of you," Draco stated.
The man gave Draco a nod before turning to the Medi-Witch. "I have received a complaint against you Poppy," the man said.
"Thank you. Um is it alright if I keep these here and come back to them later?" he asked.
"Sorry I could not give the full info Mr. Potter.  I am actually a Muggleborn so my account with the bank is not large enough to have its own manager," Charity said a tad bit embarrassed.
"That is correct Prince Bonecrusher," Mr. Malfoy said bowing his head low to expose the back of his neck to the Goblin. "I apologized if I am speaking out of turn but it was my idea after the events of last night placed your client into a Magical Coma."
"I say again, what do you want, Granger?" Draco asked stepping back a little from her.
"I would normally say yes, it would be a student to determine if they are turning in their work using proper sources rather than trust their fellow students. But I think using the Tracking Spell will help this, but it will also show that if students work together in either homework or class projects are doing the same amount of work so that we can grade them appropriately," Severus explained.
"Well I have flown on my broom I guess," Harry said.
"Why not just get them from the laundry?" Hermione asked making Harry wince for that would have made more sense though would not explain the Slytherin Cloak.
"Well since you are under several spells your rings might not accept you as some family magic takes offense at an Heir/Lord being under the influence of Magic from another that is not their Mate/Partner," Draco said shocking Harry with the answer.
"Thank you Draco," Harry said and hugged the other laying his head on the Alpha's shoulder.
At Hogwarts
"I have nothing else to bring up," he said.
"The students themselves did not think so as they had filed a complaint against her since they were friends," Vansel stated.
"But I though we had reached the end of our Courting Dreams?" Harridan asked making Draco give him a sad chuckle as the two curled up together in the large dream bed.
"I don't want to be a bother," Harridan said.
"I was not saying your name I was using your proper title Heir as in next in line to lead your family's house. And the exam all students are required to come to take part in during the first week, a month at the most, of school. That is unless you had an exam at St. Mungos before coming to school," Draco's dad said.
"I don't know I fell asleep on my bed only to wake up here," Harry said as he became aware of the scent he had smelled randomly yesterday seemed to be coming from the bed he had fallen out of.
"No Ma'am for I can't think of why since my Mom was a Muggle, and since the lessons, we had said I would not go through the change I did not really pay attention to them," Harry said hoping that the Librarian was like Madam Pomfrey and would not ask too many questions.
"Oh, like Magicals are not strange?" Harry teased.
," she said as she removed her hand from his shoulder.
"Maybe Potter and the rest of the students should be returned to the castle," Professor Snape said.
"It is an old protection to this House Potter," Theo explained.  "Unfortunately Salazar knew that in this part of the world those who speak Parsewltongue was mistrusted so he made sure that any student, even if they are not a member of the House, could enter if they spoke the language find refugee.  But that does not answer how you knew where Slytherin was located.
"It was the brewing alright, now take this spell off me so I can go hide in a hole in the ground," Draco said.
"Alright, fine we do it only when we are with you all. And don't try to paint it as if I am ashamed of being with Luna," Pansy said giving them a hard look.
"There is nothing to worry about Susan," Minerva said giving the young Hufflepuff girl a smile. "No student's magic affected the wards at all we did that to make sure all the students got tested by the Goblins."
"So you wanted to apologize to me due to calling my Mom that name?" Harry asked for yes the slur was bad it did not really shed any light on Snape's behavior.
"If I claimed them now would I have to leave school or anything?" Harry asked.
The results from the test Harry is given is a test mainly used for healing which is why there is no information on his family or messing with his vaults
Due to wanting to make sure all tests were done while keeping the results secret from everyone, apart from the students themselves, the three representing the Founder lines and Minerva as the Staff representative. Though when Minerva and Severus went through the results Bonecrusher was with them to make sure they did not take any notes or results away without approval. The pair of Magicals barely even looked at the results in general, rather they cast a search spell that brought all students that were Muggleborn that had a Magical Family listed, as well as any results no matter their blood status had a flag raised on it. After the spell had been cast the pair was horrified to find that at least half a dozen students had been flagged as having been enchanted. As they took a closer look at these results they had to admire the Goblins as Bonecrusher tapped each page letting them see what enchantments were on the student. Some they were able to dismiss as being done by Albus, such as the second year Slytherin Jo Lesky, who it seemed to be enchanted against the gender they considered themselves, as well as some memory charms on them. But some students clearly showed Albus's handy work on them.
"Then I will move out so we don't live with him," Draco stated.
"Um, thanks do I owe you anything?" Harry asked.
Harrison watched the Goblin pull out a roll of parchment and placed the quill's tip on the parchment and began to speak some language he did not recognize. Harrison watched as the Goblin let go of the quill which began to work without anyone holding it, but he could not fully focus on it as Draco's cousin began to ask him why he feared for his life if he had returned to the Dursleys. Harrison not wanting to look at anyone, rather lowered his head to look down at his lap began to speak about how before he had gotten his Hogwarts letter before his First-Year his bedroom had been the cupboard under the stairwell in his house. He told them stories of his choirs that he had done growing up including cooking, cleaning, lawn care, and helping carrying shopping when his Aunt got groceries. The only choirs the Dursleys never had him do was trying to fix items when they broke down or plumbing as if afraid he would do something worse than what was going on with it if he tried to fix them. "They really had you make multi-course meals using the stove as young as five years old?" Tonk's asked horrified as she took notes on what he was sharing.
"None of that Harry, if anyone should apologize it should be me for not thinking to take you to see a Healer after reading the note you sent," she said. "Also I am not sure how to tell you this but it seems that your Account Manager has for your protection placed you in both Professor Bathsheda and myself as your temporary guardians so I think for the moment I think it would be alright if you just called me Charity."
"I have not come across that in any of the books," Harridan said softly.
Harridan woke up in what felt like the most comfortable bed ever as he opened his eyes to find out that while he was in a bed he was mostly laying on top of Draco's larger form. "Hello, my Blue Jay are you feeling better?" Draco asked sensing he was conscious again.
"I agree please get all this out of me please," Harridan said as Tom came over pulling out his wand, which for once did not cause Harridan to flinch as he began to chant something Harridan did not understand before placing his wand tip to his forehead and drawing out an orb of white light. Tom then places the orb into his own hand where it is absorbed into his body making him look healthier as his brown hair took on a luster as if it had been freshly washed and some color returned to his skin.
"If that is true why can I see you while you can't make out who I am?" Harry asked.
"Oh my God," Granger's voice said in excitement rushing over with a shining look in her brown eyes.
"Very well by the Power given to me as the Potter family Account Manager, backed up by the entire Goblin Nation I declare for the time being you and Bathsheda Badding shall be granted custody of Heir Potter until further notice," the Goblin said in a very formal voice.
"I second the motion to expel this Hermione Granger," Agustus said tapping her cane of office on the floor.
"What part?" Harry asked unable to think of anything happy or joyous in their last meeting which had just been Harry working with Draco on some spells followed by Draco directing Harry on ways to prepare Potion Stocks and then helping him stir his mixture better.
"I can start the process right away," the Goblin said making a small note on a roll of parchment which he had evidently just summoned since it had not been there a moment ago.
"I think they are in the bottom of my trunk," Harry said making as if to get out of bed to go collect them thinking he would be asked to.
"Thanks, Harridan," Pansy said smiling at him as she nuzzled Luna's neck as the blonde girl sat comfortably on her lap.
"You are a great kisser," Draco said making Harry blush as he understood the "list" Draco was referring to. "But you are right we should head back to our dorms less we break curfew," Draco said unwrapping his arms from around Harry's waist as he started to gather up his supplies. "Well until next time Harry," Draco said but before he left he took Harry's wand hand and lifted it to his mouth to kiss it. Harry was shocked a little at the gesture which had made him feel like one of those old storybook princesses in the stories the Muggles teachers read to the class in elementary school.
"He came in the middle of the night," Draco said in answer reaching over and taking Harry's hand in his to offer some support.
"No," Snape said placing a hand on Harry's shoulder again "Lily's Mum and Dad unlike Tuna Fish and my father were perfectly fine with Magic and were so proud of your Mum for having it. The reason we never told them was despite everything Tuna Fish did to her Lily still cared for your aunt. She had the biggest heart of anyone I have ever meet," Snape said as the pair watch a few more memories of Lily and Snape before going to Hogwarts.
"No I was not turned for a normal Werewolf is not out of control when they have transformed only turning someone to protect them for a while it does spread the curse of the wolf to its victim the bite can heal most know sickness even the Muggle AIDs virus," Draco said
. Her spell tore through Fred's weak shield but had been stopped by George's hastily cast one using his full power. Due to seeing how much power Ginny had put behind her spell. After his
"Well in here with me of course but if that is too much too soon we can set you up with your own room next door," Draco said giving the smaller boy's hand a gentle squeeze.
"That is correct Prince Bonecrusher," Mr. Malfoy said bowing his head low to expose the back of his neck to the Goblin. "I apologized if I am speaking out of turn but it was my idea after the events of last night placed your client into a Magical Coma."
"As I assume you are Mistress Lily's son we can call you what we used to call you right after your parents introduced you to us," Celia said.
With a sigh Snape showed the pair of friends meeting two boys on the Hogwarts express and Harry did not need to ask their identities for one of them looked just like him though with deep ocean blue eyes, no scar and well feed, while the other could only be his young Godfather. Harry wince as his Father made an idiot of himself reminded him of Draco from his first year leading Lily to take Snape's hand and leave the train compartments. Having seen various scenes of the pair of friends growing up Harry felt similar disappointment as Lily was sent to Gryffindor and while the young Snape was sent to Slytherin. Making Harry wonder if he had let the Sorting Hat place him in Slytherin would he have still been friends with Ron. He really did not think so based on his friend having a vary anti-Slytherin mindset. Nor did he think he would have been friends with Hermione, not that he was feeling very friendly with the girl since Draco had pointed out what she had been doing to his homework for years. Snape and Lily did not seem to have any issues though as the pair would still hang out and even sat next to each other at meals, something Harry would never have guessed was allowed.
"There is something wrong with your idea though. I don't love Potter," Draco said.
"What treat you less like a Prince and more like a normal person for once," Goyle joked.
"But just cause you are an Heir does not let you get any special treatment or access to the school as a student," Severus said.
"We are really for breakfast you can get off the bed now," Draco said giving a small smile to Harry. Harry scooted to the edge of the bed before he hopped off of it wrapping Draco's cloak tight around his slim form. Despite how they might have felt for Harry the others formed a small circle around Draco and Harry as they left the bedroom to better block him from view from the other Slytherins. This measure, however, did nothing to stop Pansy from easily slipping in and walking on the opposite side of Draco than Harry was. It was then that Harry saw that maybe without realizing it Draco giving him his cloak had helped blocked out any unpleasant scents. For Pansy was rather close but all he could smell was Draco's scent.
"I am fine Mione," he said, "I was, unfortunately, thinking of someone seeing me before I grabbed the cloak." Harry then reached for some syrup to put on his French Toast which stretched the borrowed cloak out letting Ron see the crest on it.
"That is another thing it seems that young Miss Hermione came to Hogwarts under an assumed name for her results showed that she had a Glamour placed on her from her mother who is Dolores Umbridge," he explained. Hearing this a look of shock comes to everyone's faces as even Minerva votes to expel the girl for her actions. Having reached a unanimous decision Drake uses his position to summon Hermione Umbridge right to them as well as the girl's mother. As this was being done Severus adjust his Prince Lordship ring activating the Porktey and hopefully sending the boys to Gringotts to get a full Cleaninsing if not more.
"Nope apart from the feast at Hogwarts and the Yule Ball of course," Harridan said.
"I don't know I still think you could help me in the class some more, than there is also your payment for the lessons and the book with me helping you with D.A.D.A," Harry pointed out.
"What the hell Potter?" Draco asked after looking over several pages.
After what felt like no time at all, yet also the ageless times of dreams Harry was woken up by a shout. Thinking it was Seamus or Ron pulling a prank on someone else he just buried his face deeper into his pillow with a moan. "Bloody Hell Potter what are you doing here?" a familiar voice called out making Harry's eyes shot open to find that he was not hugging a pillow but blood Draco Malfoy.
Lucius goes to see if he needs a Cleansing, though he does not think so.  While Harry's unconscious state is a mystery to Narcissa and the Healers at St. Mungos.
"I am unfamiliar with those members of the Potter family," Draco's dad said.
"No," Harry said as the third group went up to cast the spell.
"I don't recall. I know Minnie meet with several Muggleborns but they were all girls, Flitwick met with one of the students whose parent was trying to decide to send their child here or one of the other schools. I don't recall anyone else meeting with new students last summer," Bathsheda said tapping her bottom lip in thought. "His address should be located in the school records," she said.
"Well due to how young you both are not at the moment but as you grow older you may find you can share some surface thoughts and feelings, as well as possibly finding the same person or type of people attractive," Bonecrusher said. Both Harry and Draco blushed a little at this thinking that they did not see that happening though neither wanting to share that they preferred men to the other boy.
"I did nothing Ms. Granger," Professor Snape said reaching for her scroll and reading from it. "It seems that you had a Multi-layered Glamor which changed both your looks but also your voice and was cast by." Rather than saying the name out loud, he arched an eyebrow at the scroll that listed the change that had come from the girl's own mother, Dolores Umbridge.
Harrison did not understand the added funds until he went to get the new books for his classes. Having expected the same price as he had paid last time he was shocked to find that the books written by Lockhart that had been on his list were rather expensive which would have made him have to head back to the bank for more money if he had still the funds he had originally placed in the bag. After they got all his books and the rest of his shopping done they decided to head out to Evens' Haven to check on the building. Harrison sort of expected it to be like the home at #4 if a little bigger due to the number of rooms but he was shocked to see that while it was listed on the form as a Cottage it was more along the lines of a small townhouse. Arriving at the place they saw it was at the end of a line of townhouses but unlike the others on the block, it had no numbers on it to show off its address. As if sensing his confusion Professor Baddling, who had also permitted him to use her first name outside of Hogwarts, informed him that Magical homes that were located in the Muggle World sometimes had spells on them to prevent Muggles from seeing them, sort of like the Leaky Cauldron. "While Evens' Haven may have been a Muggle property at some point if it had Muggle repelling charms on it the Muggles who live nearby would not be able to see it. Unable to see it they of course would report the discrepancy of addresses to someone and get it changed. Unless of course, the address of the place is #13 for then due to their superstitions to that number they let it alone," Bathsehda explained.
Harry was so happy that Draco had agreed to go with him that he almost skipped to Gryffindor Tower completely forgetting about supper. His good mood lasted until he came into the Common Room and saw Ron looking in the dumps. "What's up Ron?" Harry asked as Hermione and Ginny moved away from where they had been sitting comforting him.
"We have to do something," Remus said.
"I think that might be for the best, no offense," Harry said looking at the others around him.
"True, but if what you say is true you either with the whole other way with it or acted like the young kid who pulled a girl's pigtails so they would pay attention to them," Harry said arching an eyebrow at the blonde only to see a blush on the other's face. "Oh my God since when?" Harry asked.
Hearing that the man who had tried to kill him at least four times so far was the father of Draco, Harry pushed the other boy away his cobalt wings wrap protectively around his body. "Blue Jay, Harry it is alright," Draco said reaching forward making Harry flinch back from him as his green eyes kept shooting back and forth between Draco and the Dark Lord.
Harry is informed of what has been done to him as he is given two test and their results.
"I would like it but what if it is the presence of your Soul that led me to be mated with Draco?" Harry said for even though it had only been a short time he did not want to lose Draco.
"But we also want to keep quiet about it so we thought the best way to do it was to get all the students, Muggleborn, Half-Blood, and Purebloods, tested as well," Severus said causing Bonecrusher to almost faints.
During the time he had spent with Hermione in the library the books had not become free, Madam Pince informed him that due to him using them that morning he would have to wait until no one needed them so that they actually were used by multiple students rather than come to him after the first one had been done with them. At least by spending the time with Hermione he had not worried about being assaulted by horrid scents, though he had also not detected the one that made him think of Sirius either after the first time.
Though when he did have his class Harry pulled out the book and used it throughout the class to make sure he prepared everything correctly. He also did his best to ignore the "help" Hermione tried to provide in making the Potion while Ron did exactly what she told him to do every step of the way. As he worked Harry had tried to figure out why Draco's book had been left off of his First Year, book list. He had at first thought that maybe due to the stories that he had heard about him being raised to know all about the Magical World it had been left off, but Draco had been brought up in the Magical World and it had been on his list. He next guessed that due to Snape's behavior towards him the man had not put the book on Harry's list thus giving him an excuse to berate his work, but this one also came to nothing when he found out none of his Dorm mates had the book either. It was if even before they had been sorted someone had decided to leave a book off their list so that Gryffindors would be bad at Potions, though how they knew they would be in Gryffindor Harry still could not figure it out.
"I was wondering if you would accompany me to a meeting in the library later," he said.
"Of course I do, I did not gain the title of Slytherins Queen of gossip by just watching everyone. I just like to sit back and watch every once and a while as it help inspires me," Pansy explained. Luna nodded before without warning plucking Pansy's notebook from her hands. "Hey give that back," Pansy said as the blonde girl began to flip through the book.
"Can I at least take a look at the book?" Hermione asked.
"That is why I like you, Batty, always so logical," Charity said.
"As I said I found a new understanding in my life," Harry said watching the second group which contained Ginny. Harry winced again seeing just like Draco and Colin she had created a Patronus shaped like Hedwig before she made her way over to her current boyfriend Michael Corner from Ravenclaw.
"What?" Harry asked looking at him.
"Why?" Harridan asked.
spell at the anger-prone redhead. Moving to avoid the high power stream of magically created water Ron walked right into Fred's spell as he stumbled over his own feet with his shoelaces now tied together thanks to Fred.
"Um, a Blood Artifact Retrieval from what I know of it is a way that Magicals can get back items that either belong to their family or were created by them. From what I know of it is usually done when objects are stolen or they lend it to someone who refused to give it back," Charity said.
Contains Protective Draco Malfoy, Hagrid, Hermione.  Madam Pomfrey, Albus Dumbledore bashing
Trying to distract the shadow as it got close enough to reach Harry, Draco let out a loud war cry as he began to cast spells at the figure. For all the good he did Draco might as well have been throwing rocks at the thing. He did manage, however, to get the things attention as to his shock a wand appeared from the shadow hitting him with a spell that sent Draco flying backward into a tree and dazing him. "The pest is dealt with continue with the boy," a voice said though in Draco's current state he could not determine where it was coming from. Though Draco did not see the speaker he saw the shadow turn back to Potter. The shadow pulled the wand back into itself as it approached Potter who now appeared to be unconscious. Fearing for Potter, Draco pushed himself off the tree one hand clutching his side knowing that if he did not act Potter was going to die.
"That really is troubling,": Pamona said looking worried. " I wonder if my students have all their books as well."
"You bloody well not Malfoy, not stop arguing," Hagrid said as much to Draco's annoyance Granger came over and threw one of his arms over her shoulder. Longbottom thankfully did not, looking a little scared to get close to him as if afraid he would get attacked like during the Gryffindor/Hufflepuff game when he fought against Crabb and Goyle.
"Well, I guess thank you," Harry said with a tad bit of sarcasm in his voice.
"You really don't want to know," Draco said still not looking at him.
"None taken," Draco said before one of the others could speak up gently squeezing Harry's hand before letting it go.
," the hat spoke into his ear.
"Am I missing something?" Professor Sprout asked.
"It would be even easier than you think Minerva," Severus said placing a hand on Harridan's shoulder "for besides being Head of Slytherin House I am also Steward of the Ancient and Courageous House of Gryffindor." Both Witch's mouth falls open in shock looking between Harridan and the Potion Master.
"My associate and I are here representing a client from another bank," the older one had said in a tone of voice dripping with steel.
"What's wrong with cooking?" Harry asked as they left the main dorm and entered the castle proper.
Harry meets up with Draco for a second tutoring session on the night he would be going to his lessons with Snape, so he would not have to have another day to work around for D.A. meetings. Harry was actually surprised when Draco offer him congratulations on the Potion he had submitted in class. "You know now that you know that you need to pay attention to how you prepare everything you should do better in class," Draco had said.
"Mr. Potter stop right there," Madam Pomfrey said pushing him back into bed.
"And we did nothing to either of you though if I had to guess that might not last too long I am sure our Dads will be declaring your family enemies of our house," Fred said loudly enough for nearby students to hear. Turning their backs on the two Fred and George and the others went to take their now normal places at the Slytherin table.
"Why though Potter you are just a student why do you think it is up to you to act?" Snape said.
"But I only have one vault," Harry interrupted him.
Harry could not help but snort, "Oh yeah that is a good idea go live with a man who last time I met him tried to curse me."
"It can be easily done, for all but the Resurrection Stone/Gaunt Family ring, but only after you claim your titles along with your rings. Though I would suggest going through a cleansing first," Bonecrusher said making another note on his page from Harry's request.
"Is that why you presented early?" Draco asked recalling that sometimes a person would present early if their home life was horrible.  "So you could find someone to protect you?  But your Mom was a Muggle?" he asked confused.
"Um, it's Harry Potter, and what exam?" Harry said.
"Provided you claim your seats before you are of age otherwise it could be seen as you not wanting to take your full role in our world giving them to the next in line to receive them," Draco said.
"I more saw you as the Magical equivalent of my bully cousin which I was rather used to so could not find your behavior that strange," Harry confessed with a small shrug. "They did not mention that the meeting having anything to do with the effecting the matter of slighting someone.
"Your welcome Potter," Draco shot back in the same tone of voice.
"But he wants to kill me," Harry said after a moment.
"I actually have something else," Severus said deepening their shock for he barely spoke up in meetings, let alone bringing up two issues right off the bat.
"Yes go on," Draco said in a gentle voice running a hand down Harridan's back.
"Thanks see you then," Harry said as the others let him slip out of the group right before they came in sight of the Great Hall.
After lunch had been eaten and cleaned up Harrison, Charity, and Bathsheda were given a complete tour of Evens' Haven. Harrison saw he had missed some things as he was shown the backyard of the home and found both a broom/tool shed as well as a greenhouse with an expansion charm on it making its insides as large as one of the ones at Hogwarts. During the tour, Harrison also found out that the townhouse had a basement that was separated into two areas one that was food and potion ingredient storage while the other had been sent aside for brewing. He also learned that the lounge was actually the Floo room making Harrison look around but not seeing how anything in the room could let someone travel to Hogwarts and back again. This caused Bathsheda to teach him about Floo travel, the Floo Network, as well as even showing what it looked like as she tossed some powder into the fireplace and walked through the green flames before quickly coming back. As the group headed upstairs both Bathsheda and Charity instructed him the best way to use the Floo was to treat it as if it was nothing but a door to his designation as well as offering to accompany him on a trip through it before the end of the summer. Reaching the third floor Harrison found that his new Guardians had both picked out bedrooms on this floor making him feel guilty for taking the largest bedroom only for them to point out it was his right for while they were his Guardians he was still the Head of the House so he should have the largest room. Reaching his new room Charity unshrunk his school trunk before she pushed him towards the room's desk and told him that since he had been unable to do his summer work until now he should start on it right away. They did say that since they were Professors at Hogwarts they could not help him too much with his work but could guide him a little guidance if he had any problems.
"She has taken Ron and Ginny by their hands as they and Hermione are moving back into the crowd to mix with the Muggles," George stated as they watched the Muggle law officers getting stopped by one of the Magical ones as they flashed something to them making them withdraw with thankful looks on their faces.
Having seen that both Godric and Fleamont were good at Potions, he began to flip to the front page for all the family members listed in the book to see what fields of study each member of his family had gone into. Harry, or maybe he should go by Harrison now, was rather amazed to see that almost every single person had Potions as a specialty making him wonder why he sucked at the subject. From what he had heard about his mom she had also been good at most subjects taught at Hogwarts, with only History of Magic giving her a grade lower than an EE. Maybe he should ask Draco about Potions due to the Blonde's Alpha's skill in the class to see if he could spot where he was going wrong in the subject. Flipping to the next member of the family his eyes flew open finding the name Harrison Potter. The information being near the back of the book made Harrison think this was the person he was named for. Seeing that like the rest listed in the book Harrison was a Potions Master and had played a part in helping develop the Wolfsbane Potion, Shrinking Solution, and the Animagus Revealing Potion. Harrison was listed as having two sons Flemont and his younger brother Charlus Potter. He flipped ahead to check out Charlus's Potter to see if he had any living Magical relatives and saw that Charlus married a Dorean Black and was said to have one son which unfortunately died young.
"Well, it seems that I ended up sleepwalking and woke up in a strange place. I had to sneak a cloak from the Lost and Found just so I was not walking around in Dudley's old clothing," he partially lied.
"Honey I am home," Draco called as he left the parlor.
"I, unfortunately, do not have a writ for it was sort of spur of the moment decision," Mr. Malfoy said rubbing the back of his neck and blushing slightly.
"We would," they said.
"Just cause no one is doing it now does not mean it could not happen sometime later," Hermione protested. For some reason, this statement raised some red flags for Harry as he suddenly thought of Umbitch after failing to get the information on the D.A. through truth Potion moving on to Legilimency.
Having not only won the Duel over their former younger siblings making the pair leave them alone but also claimed the Prewett Lordship the twins and Blaise left the Dueling room to spend time with each other. Having spent the time leading up to the duel learning the spells Ron might have known that was beyond his years from Harridan. Using the fact that they won the trio decided to spend the rest of the day together away from everyone else. Fred really wished it was a Hogsmead weekend so they could get out of school making it easier to escape the crowds. Granted most of them were coming up and telling them a great job on their win, especially the Purebloods who had seen the Fletchers' actions, even if it had not been Ron and Ginny who had done it, as Line Theft. Still, it was annoying as the trio just wanted to spend time with themself alone for the moment.
"Then we can only hope that after the Blood Artifacf Retrevial his Rings accept him so that he has full access to all his line's properties," Bonecrusher said as he summoned all the Heir and Lordship rings Harry was entitled to only to find that once was missing before he recalled it had been stolen. He hoped the ritual returned it to Heir Potter, through from the records he had on the family line it was from he did not think it would make that big of a difference in either properties or money for the young human's accounts.
"I tried to. Oh, I tried but she would not speak to me, with good reason. I thought I could explain what had happened after we had left Hogwarts for the year but it seemed that Tobias after killing my Mother decided to move house leading to me no longer being near Lily," Snape said as the memories of his trying to get into Gryffindor Tower to talk to Lily as well as her refusal to see him and than getting carted off with a blood-stained eye version of the man from earlier to a small cramped two-story home. "I could not even write to her for it seems that Tobias had decided I was never to go back to Hogwarts letting me know that the day after I returned he was going to burn all of my Magical possessions. As I was not of age there would have been no way to stop him, but once again my Potion making skills came in handy as in one night I brewed a potion that would make him forget the plan. While the potion worked it did lead him to fall further to drink and more physical beatings from the man," Snape stated though thankfully but thankfully not showing those memories.
," Harridan thought as Draco hovered a few yards above the ground letting Harridan fly in circles around his form from top to bottom. "
After supper, the pair would curl up together and just come down from their day apart watching a Magical TV set that the Americans had developed and now that Fudge and Dumbles were gone could finally be sold in the U.K. Right before bed, Harry received either his punishment or reward for his actions during the blowjob from earlier before the pair would call it a night. If no one was at the manor Draco and Harry would curl up in the Master Bedroom together with Harry pulled tight to the blonde's muscular chest, but if perchance they had company they were forced to sleep apart. With Draco staying in the Master Bedroom while Harry is forced to spend the night in the "servant's Quarters." In truth, the "Servant's Quarters" were just as large as the Master Bedroom, not that any guest had found that out yet, and the only downside for Harry was spending the night away from Draco. Though he would get a small thrill as he journeyed the "Servant's Quarters" without a scrap of clothing on him. Leading to a slight chance that Draco's guest would find him naked with his husband's seed leaking out his ass. Some would just laugh while every once and a while a guest would pull Harry into their room to have fun with the "enchanted" Boy-Who-Lived. Harry never keeps a secret from Draco about being used by others which the Blonde would either block the guest from coming back to the Manor or take steps to actually watch Harry getting used by them on their next visit.
"I understand perfectly Mister Goblin," Charity said making the Goblin give her a small nod of approval.
"Actually I came into my creature and Draco is my Mate," Harridan said.
"Stop the access to the funds, get as much as you can back and can I get a new key or something? I would also like to cancel any Marriage Contracts unless it is mentioned in my parents' Wills which I check into later. Please get Shell Cottage back since there was no proper authority to pass it on in the first place," Harrison said as the Goblin Account Manager made a note of Harrison's wishes.
"Normally yes, but after reading about some of the stuff to done to Heir Potter, but the Magical Coma I thought would be a good idea to have him get tested," Mr. Malfoy said letting go of Harry's shoulder.
"Oh, my son was faking an injury was he?" the elder Malfoy said as he pulled out one of the two letters. "According to the letter that the Gamekeeper sent to the Governors he mentioned that my son needing to be helped to the Hospital Wing due to what the man diagnosed as a heavily sprained ankle and had been clutching one of his sides which means he might have had an internal injury from being blasted into a tree from a letter send from a Miss Granger." Draco's dad then pushed past the Matron and used his wand to cast a spell on his son. As he waited for the results to print out of his wand the man glared at the Matron who tried to go about her duties as she took the tray of Draco's finished breakfast before sending it down to the kitchens and orders some food for Harry.
"I thought you were Draco's cousin," he said fighting the urge to throw up himself.
Harry was not sure how to respond not wanting to reveal his and his friends' adventure with the Polyjuice Potion, but to his shock, it was Draco who answered.  "Well knowing I am an Alpha I can only assume that Harry's Omega side lead him down to our dorms.  Though how you went through the change and so soon I can't even begin to guess."  Everyone turned to look at Harry making him back up until he had scooted into one of the room's walls.
Harry's world was nothing but pain. Granted much of his life had been pain being brought up like he was in a family that did its best to basically torture him and break his spirit, but this was different his head felt like it was being torn apart. He had vague memories of seeing a living shadow about to suck the unicorn's blood that Malfoy and he had found. Malfoy had shrieked fear and fled making the shadow "look"(?) at them. Harry had found himself rooted to the spot as his head exploded in pain and his body had crumpled. Despite the pain, he had not lost consciousness right away as he heard Malfoy return to help, only to hear the blonde boy being sent flying and a loud thud and crack reaching his ears. Harry had been unable to turn to see what happened to his Slytherin rival/bully but had feared the worst and not just due to the shadow moving closer which increased the pain in his head. Harry had expected to die and for a moment was slightly happy that in death he might see his family once again. What he had not expected to hear Malfoy's voice cry out, "You will not have him." Harry began to worry for Draco as he heard the other boy cast spell after spell but to no avail against the shadow. Suddenly there had been a burst of white light and for a moment Harry had been free of pain as he heard another crash and a thud of something hitting a tree. Harry had feared it would be Malfoy's lifeless body but by chance, luck, or magic the tree that had been hit was in the small area Harry could see. Harry let out a pain-filled gasp as he saw the shadow seem to leave the body it had been blocking revealing Professor Quirrell. But as a voice filled the clearing again and Quirrell's body moved unnaturally to its feet the pain in Harry's head redoubled causing him to slip into a magical coma.
"Harrison, never do that again," Charity said placing a gentle hand on his shoulder.
"After my future planning meeting I sought out a Potions tutor and he was the only one that was free," Harry answered truthfully.
"Well that complicates things," Harry said unable to think of how he could ask any of his teachers to have him look for it in the library.
"Very well after we find out any properties you may possess at the bank Dorra will take a statement from you about why you felt your family would possibly kill you," Andromeda said as she held up a hand to stop Harrison from interrupting her. "Draco did share a little bit about your "family" but as my Dorra is an Auror she can use her potion to press charges against them for their treatment of you, but only if she hears it directly from you."
The ritual finished Arthur leaned into his Mate feeling drained from cutting so many people at once from his family magic at once. After Arthur had recovered enough of his energy the pair of Mates placed the hands back on the clock showing off their real family for the first time in seventeen years. As soon as the two glowing hands were placed on the clock the larger of the hands separated into two hands shifting from the normal gold to silver as they shifted to show Fleur Delacour and Blaise Zabini while the shorter hand stayed gold and shifted so it resembled Oliver Wood joining with Percy's hand for a moment before separating leaving Percy hand to now read as "Percy Wood-Lupin-Weasley."
Tonks leaned in making it look as if she was pointing something out to him and whispered right into Harrison's ear, "I have a Magical talent known as Metamorpmagus which means I can change my look at will. I tend to have a very memorable look while out in public so that when I am working I can easily go unnoticed." Harrison gave a nod of understanding his estimates of her raising slightly.
"Yeah, that would do it," Draco said nodding his head. "So your family would really kill you?" Draco asked.
"Well then Happy Naming Day," Luna said.
"Well he's a prick, but I am my own man if he does not like that I prefer males," Draco said as if giving a preview of how he would tell Lucius Malfoy that he liked Harry. "I can always move out."
"Don't worry the place was never haunted. The villagers gave it the name after hearing father breaking stuff as a wolf while James and his friends spread the tale that it was a pack of ghouls and restless sprites that were the cause," Fred stated quite matter of factly having heard the tale at Grimmauld Place when he and George had asked their unknown father and Black about the creation of the Marauder's Map.
Albus cursed the fact that Pomona was there making him try to come up with a logical reason for him being late rather than the truth that he liked making everyone wait for him as it showed his power over them. "While I am no longer Chief Warlock in the Wizengamot I am still the Supreme Mugwump for the ICW," he said.
"Until our next meeting then," Vansel said heading to use the Floo in the now-vacated Healer's office.
"Well then hello to you both and thank you for taking care of a member of my family," Tumbus said performing their earlier gesture again. "So Master Potter how may I be of service?"
"Then your guardian," Draco said.
"You would just need to call for the Potter Family Head Elf he would know," Jeffory explained.
Refusing to pay attention to the three betrayers the group returned to the game of Exploding Snap with Harridan sitting on Draco and Theo snuggled up on Neville's lap. The group of pest finally moved away from their door when the Witch with the cart came through making Pansy give a moan of thanks as she quickly left the compartment to go use the restroom having not wanted to leave when the trio was camped out in front of the door. None of them took any food off the cart as they shared a meal prepared by Tom and the Malfoy House Elves which consisted of breaded chicken, garlic bread sticks and their choice of grape juice, milk, tea, coffee or pumpkin juice. For dessert a tray of freshly made Peanut butter and chocolate fudge cookies which had been under a stasis spell so it seems that they had just been pulled out of the oven making both Harridan and Theo let out soft moans, for like most Submissive they had more of a sweet tooth compared to their dominant counterparts.
"It is an old protection to this House Potter," Theo explained.  "Unfortunately Salazar knew that in this part of the world those who speak Parsewltongue was mistrusted so he made sure that any student, even if they are not a member of the House, could enter if they spoke the language find refugee.  But that does not answer how you knew where Slytherin was located.
"I have no further questions at this time, thank you," Harry said not wanting to make a mistake and assume Elmblossom's gender for as far as he knew males and females could look similar to each other.
A few pages later Harry reached the chapter about Heirship/Lordship and saw that he was once more being rude to people by not using their proper titles, not that he knew what any of his classmate's titles were if they were considered Heirs or not. It did not help that none of the teachers used anyone's titles either during class, and he would think they would know them. Harry as he read also recalled that the Goblins at the bank had used a title so he at least knew that Draco's dad, he still could not yet think of the man as his Godfather barely knowing him, had been called Lord. This means if Draco was his eldest child he would be an Heir, Harry was not sure though for he did not know much about the blonde Slytherin's family. For all, he knew most Magical families were like the Weasleys and had multiple children. There was just too much about the Magical World he did know about yet.
After taking the cleansing potions some facts come out and a student is expelled.
"Well, sandwiches yes as well as simple foods but something that requires measuring items and mixing is usually only done with Potions in the Magical World," Draco said.
"Aren't you taking the Mirror Twins thing a little far?" Harridan asked taking in their hair as the two groups headed up to breakfast.
"I have read about that sort of thing," the girl said not really answering his question,
"I am aware of that rule, but I think we can make have an exception this time," Mr. Malfoy said.
"You would do that?" Harry asked in shock.
The Goblins get involved to look for the last Founder Line
*While Harry and Draco are doing their homework during this time I did not feel like it needed to be written about.  Just know that with the added books and Draco's help Harry will do just as well as when Hermione helps him if not better.  The only subject they can not do their full work for is Potions since Harry under the Wards can not brew.
"You said "yet" do you see it happening at some point?" Minerva asked.
"I second the motion to expel this Hermione Granger," Agustus said tapping her cane of office on the floor.
"Ay, it was that," Hagrid stated, "and most Magicals are taught it once they reach the age of adulthood, student or no to send quick short distance messages, or messages they do not want others to be able to intercept. And finding Quirrell like this I think that is needed now." Draco was a little surprised to hear the man not sounding so wild anymore.
"Thanks, and you are right food would be good.  Also, my friends are probably freaking out wondering where I am," Harry said.
"What are you talking about?" Harry asked as he found himself actually snuggling up into the blonde's chest.
"Strange, though it could have something to do with how you were able to survive the initial attack," Draco said biting his lip in a way Harry had come to recognizes as the blonde deep in thought. "I think I recall something like that happening before, well not exactly for it was not a killing curse that the person lived through, but it had someone protecting someone they loved with their own life granting what is referred to as a Love Ward. The thing is I don't know of any reason why the Headmaster thinks you need to go stay with your mother's sister has anything to do with such a Ward."
"Language Weasley," Draco said as it was revealed he had been the one holding the drink.
Inside his own mind, Harry was beginning to freak out a little from Draco's statement.  Him an Omega nothing could be worse than that.  Even having his new awaken sense leading him to Draco was not as bad as becoming an Omega.  From what he had read from the books in the library he would be forced to go through a Heat after he had awakened.  Thus it was a guarantee that he would have to experience it at the Dursleys.  He could only think of two situations neither of which were good outcomes.  His uncle would either kill him for this "new freakiness" or even more sickening is that either his uncle or cousin would take advantage of him during a Heat.  He would not put it past either his uncle or cousin to take advantage of him in such a state.  Recalling memories of when he was younger when his uncle had come into his room while drunk and had slipped into his bed.  Or some times when it had just been Dudley without his gang and he would use force Harry to jerk him off under threat of violence.  As the thoughts of being killed or raped by his family, Harry began to unknowingly release some fear pheromones.
"Well since you are under several spells your rings might not accept you as some family magic takes offense at an Heir/Lord being under the influence of Magic from another that is not their Mate/Partner," Draco said shocking Harry with the answer.
"What happened to Peter I don't think I have seen him here?" Harridan had asked having come across other "Death Eaters" since he had come to stay with Draco's family but had yet to run across the man.
"Well congrats I guess," Susan said with a slight smile.
"Apparate?" Harry asked in confusion as Mr. Malfoy took out a pouch from his robes and threw some dust into the fireplace within Madam Pomfrey's office.
"What do you mean?" Harry asked.
"Thanks, Draco," George said with a small smile "the only thing is we had been keeping it secret from everyone lest Molly finding out but when Dumbles opened up the Mating Dorms, Hogwarts sent us the message that we were to move down here."
When Lucius finally arrived back at the bank he was directed not to the Halls of Healing but to Prince Bonecrusher's personal office. "Ah Lord Malfoy I was just about to send a raven for you. Heir Potter has finished with everything and can be taken to St. Mungos now," Bonecrusher said.
"Of course not the spaghetti is for you," Draco said pushing the plate over to him further shocking Harry for his knowledge of one of Harry's favorite meals. Blushing again and not wanting to look at Draco for a moment Harry shot a glance at Hermione to see how she was taking the new and more defined, thus harder, work for the Hogwarts House Elves. But his friend did not seem to notice the added work to the Elves as she tried help Viktor how to pronounce her name. Harry just smiled as he turned back to Draco, doing his best to avoid Bagman, and started talking about Potions hoping Draco could explain how he was so good at it. Draco spent the meal explaining why the cuts as well as paying attention to the directions when it came to stirring. This actually helped explained why Harry was so bad at Potions for the way he had been taught to cook at the Dursleys was akin to add a pinch of this and a dash of that and not really exact measurements. Without even realizing it as he listened to Draco Harry had finished off his meal before he knew it leading Draco to order some treacle tart for both of them once more knowing Harry's favorite dessert,
Over the next couple of days, Harry had a hard time not thinking about what Snape had shown him with his memories. At that time Harry had gotten more homework back from his classes than he had done on his own and saw in each subject, apart from History of Magic and D.A.D.A. his grades had shown a large improvement making him rather angry at Hermione for the "help" she had been giving him in each of the classes. His sudden coldness to the bushy-haired Magical did not go unnoticed as Ron asked what had happened between the pair of them. Knowing that Hermione "helped" him as well Harry revealed that the person who was tutoring him Potions, while not giving Draco's name, had found evidence Hermione had been sabotaging his work. Harry explained he had decided to test out if she had only done it to his Potion's homework or all their classes. Harry arched an eyebrow at his best friend seeing Ron did not look concerned by the news that their friend was messing with his work, even after Harry pointed out she could be doing the same to Ron. The redhead's lack of reaction raised some red flags for Harry who quickly said he had been joking and placed the blame on his moody behavior at Snape's feet due to his Occlumency lessons. This had got a laugh out of Ron who had said Harry should not joke about Hermione cheating like that.
Fred and George shared a looking wondering why Sirius would need a Steward to manage his estates or when he had actually had time to visit Gringotts to put his altogether. Their confusion grew as they noticed a roll before of parchment before Sirius as well. Shortly afterward the others began to notice the parchments as well leading the twins to read over Ron's shoulder at his own Message.
Several students actually gagged at the thought of the Headmaster being bond to Professor Umbridge though her being part Kappa did make sense with her very toad-like body.  Hermione was shocked to find out that the people she had thought of as her parents her so-called Father had given birth to her and her Mom was actually her Aunt.  As Snape gave her time to come to terms with her results the others got to work on making their Potions with gusto.  For people like Dean Thomas, he would be able to find out if he was a Muggleborn or possibly a Halfblood.  For once everyone was utterly focused on their own Potions with no one trying to mess anyone else's work.
"So if it the part of your Soul that is in my body that is causing a connection between us does that mean you could remove it?" Harry asked hopefully.
"Okay I am awake," Blaise said.  "Never thought I would see the day Draco taking Potter's side."
"Well, I noticed it when we were in Paris and I lead Mom and Dad to some Historical Magical and Muggle combined landmarks. I can tell you most Magicals suck at passing for a Muggle I once saw someone in a trench coat, rainbow suspenders, and a leotard. Thankfully the Muggles thought it was a street performer or some form of modern art, but I noticed the man had been carrying a wand on him. Harry had to chuckle at the choice of attire thinking she was correct about that at least a seminar should be offered at Hogwarts on how to dress to at least pass as a Muggle.
"Do you still have them?" Mr. Malfoy asked.
Unable to help himself Harry laid down on the pedestal as he let the cloak fall back into place and snuggled up against the body pillow. He found the thing was quite warm as he buried his face into it as he wrapped his arms around it and felt parts of the pillow wrap around him as well. With a content sigh, Harry snuggled tight with the pillow as his dream fell away to nothing but feelings of love, joy, family, and being protected.
"While this is all fairly fascinating what does this have to do with us all meeting?" Pansy asked.
"Yeah, she lied about that and other things," Draco growled out wrapping an arm possessively around Harridan's shoulders and pulling him close.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well then it seems I must come in and collect them," Charity said opening the window and entering the room, while at the same time canceling the charms on her.
"Well as they get closer to the Yule when I get hit by students fighting off colds and flu while they are doing OWL prep it might become too much," Madam Pomfrey admitted.
"Yeah is that a problem?" Harry asked afraid of getting teased for the activity knowing that some he knew thought cooking was a woman's job.
"Um, hello?" Harry said a little confused for the last thing he recalled was getting some money from his vault and got back into the cart then blackness.
"Aye, he did Poppy, but as Hermione pointed out to me as we entered the castle Mr. Malfoy seemed to had been hurt as well. I suspect Professor Dumbledore did not realize it which is why he ordered him back to his dorm. I was just staying long enough myself to point it out," Hagrid said as he started to leave.
"No, sorry I keep forgetting that you were not brought up in the Magical World like we were told most meals here are prepared by House Elves," Draco said.
"I would like us to start using a Tracking Spell on some of the homework. The student who brought to my attention about my coursebook also revealed they have recently found out that a student that has been "helping" them do their homework has been feeding them wrong information," he began.
"I have not really hung out with her as much as the Weasleys, but from what I have noticed she is a genuine person if a little lonely. I believed Ron notices this as well which is how he can manipulate her into doing the majority of his homework for him," Luna said making Harry balling one of his hands into a fist wanting to punch Ron in the face for doing something like that to Hermione.
"Alright, I think I know just what room to use for it as well," Draco said as the pair wrote back to their friends about the time for the meet-up before they headed down to supper.
"You call us in for that?" Agustus Longbottom asked glaring at him.
"And who would have told me I only know I am one thanks to Draco telling me in the dreams," Harry said wishing he could use magic to break out but he was unwilling to risk it so soon after the trial.
"That is all in the past now Blue Jay," Draco said kissing Harry's forehead "the mateship between Veelas is rather strong I could have tried to kill you before we presented but now I will feel nothing but love and a desire to protect you."
"What can I do for you this morning?" she asked.
Draco than had them exchange feathers telling Harridan to suck on the end like it was a quill for a moment. Harridan did so feeling a little foolish as he sucked on the end of the red feather only to get a taste as if there was ink on it. Draco then had them take their feathers back as he spread his arms before Harridan. "The last step is easy, use your feather to make a mark on my body it can be anything or anywhere," Draco said smiling down at Harridan who was deep in thought of what he should use for his mark for he had already chosen his location right above Draco's heart. After a moment of thought Harridan smiled as he thought of the perfect mark sticking his tongue out from between his lips as he drew a Snitch which to his shock seemed to come alive as it flapped its wings for a moment. When he was done Draco used his own feather to draw a broom over Harridan's heart cementing their bond. As Harridan snuggled once more into Draco's chest he noticed something as a broom joined the Snitch on the blonde's chest.  "Yes with both of us making our marks they join together as one on both of our bodies," Draco said as Harridan looks down seeing a snitch on his own chest.
"Well in a way let's head to the Blue Room for the main event," Draco said as he takes Harridan's arm and threads it through his arm as the pair of mates lead the bewildered group into the Manor.  Once the group was seated around a large table with drinks and a wide variety of snack foods both Muggle and Magical in origin.  "Now as some of you know the Malfoy line has the blood of Veelas running through it and once we reach a certain age we will begin to have what is known as Courtship Dreams involving our eventual Mate.
"Um, Professor Snape what should we do if the scroll lists us as being enchanted by someone?" Ron asked for once not scared to ask his question to the Potion's Master.
"I noticed especially at dinner," Draco said throwing an arm around Harry.
"Good Morgan's lost left sock," she said after reading over a section showing that Harry's body was currently fighting against multiple Magical Illnesses that he had not been properly vaccinated for. Wasting no time she pulled Harry, Lucius, and Draco out of line and lead them up to the Ward she ran which dealt with underaged Magicals who were sick. "Heir Potter I am afraid that based on this list I am going to have to put you in quarantine for at least a week, so we can deal with everything wrong with you. I am also going to start you on a potion regiment to help deal with the history of malnourishment and other issues I have seen so far from this list. Do you know who I can contact for you your family or any Magical Guardian you may have?" she asked.
"She turns the girls who share her bedroom into basic slaves inside of it, not to mention three male Lions and all you can say is "Oh, dear," Severus said snatching the pages from her lest she tries to do something with them. "I tried this the normal way but your reaction has let me no choice," he said raising his wand and calling out "Under Article 71-54-B of the Hogwarts charter I call an emergency meeting of the Hogwarts School Board."
"Um, Professor Snape what should we do if the scroll lists us as being enchanted by someone?" Ron asked for once not scared to ask his question to the Potion's Master.
"Wait if you are adding the book why are you reducing the price?" Harry asked at the gesture which seemed so out of character for the other boy.
As he finished speaking the there was the sound of people Apparating in as the old bylaw forced the members of the board to appear unless they were sick or going to the bathroom bringing them in even though the normal Anti-Apparition Wards around the castle. The two other Heads of House and the six parents that made up the school board looked shocked to find themselves standing in the hallway outside the Transfiguration classroom. Drake Vansel, the current leader of the board was the first to collect himself to ask what was going on. " I am sorry for calling you all in but I think we need to discuss the expulsion of a student," Severus told them all.
"I think it might be better to choose someone else," Draco said not sharing with Harry that to go up against the Headmaster his father was going to act like the enchantments the bastard had placed on him were still in effect. "Or if you can not think of anyone you can just claim them without actually having to use them at all."
spell. Albus could not even call a foul for use of the spell due to choosing the old Dueling room as the venue. The platform the Duel was taking place on had enchantments on it that would prevent any spell their opponent did not know how to cast and prevent its uses by the terms of the contract in place. This did mean that Ginny and Ron could use any spell that either Fred or George knew how to cast no problem. Dumbles had informed them of this telling them to use it as a trump card. Both had agreed to it, but Ginny had not actually been paying attention so after Fred had cast
"Alright fine," Pansy said rolling his eyes. "But you do know if you share mine I would share yours right?" she asked with a smirk.
"They would have been removed as your Guardians and other candidates would have been found," Bonecrusher said. "The Goblin Nation would never allow such artifacts to remain in the hands of thieves if either of them had not signed off of the ritual they would have faced Goblin Justice for possibly being complicit in what had been done to you." This news made Harry breathe a sigh of relief for not only had the pair of Professor pass the test but it would be the first step in setting things right.
"I think that might be for the best, no offense," Harry said looking at the others around him.
"Have we meet?" Harry asked not recognizing the Goblin as the one he and Hagrid approached or Griphook during his first visit to the bank.
"Well, she said it a little as a joke after one of my visits to the Hospital Wing saying I would need one to get rid of all the Health Potions she had to use on me by the time I graduated from Hogwarts," Harrison explained before turning to look at the Goblin.
"Can I at least take a look at the book?" Hermione asked.
With a sign, Harry placed his bag on a desk and pulled out both
Harry was shocked by all the information on his test. Not only was Draco's dad was his Godfather, he assumed even though he did not know if the man's name was Lucius, but he owed a Life Debt to Draco himself. Then there was all the spells he was under and the fact that Professor Dumbledore had put them there and seemed to be stealing from him. And since Madam Pomfrey and Snape had long-standing payments from his accounts which had been set up after his parents had died the Headmaster had been paying them as well. "First off I do not approve of any of these payments. Can I make them stop and possibly get my money back from them?" Harry asked Bonecrusher
grade for his paper, but as he was putting it away he heard Hermione let out an annoyed grunt. Looking over at her, Harry easily saw that her homework had been marked with an
"What did the idiot do now?" Harry said crouching down at his Husband's feet to take off his boots and began to massage his feet.
Come Saturday morning the twins felt they were both ready to put the Fletchers in their place and be well off from them at last. The night before the Headmaster had tried to throw them off showing up with the Dueling contract well after curfew for them to sign their part of it. Both had been shocked to see they had to use Blood Quills to sign but thought it was for the best for if the Fletchers tried to get close to them again they could call on Lady Magic to punish the pair which might hopefully make them get the message. The pair also wondered what winning conditions the Fletchers had come up with but as the Dueling contract, they signed only dealt with their part of the agreement they would not see what they had been up against until after the Duel. They had known the old bastard was trying to upset their sleep patterns before the Duel but as they had been in Gryffindor House before moving into the Slytherin Mated Dorms they were used to odd hours so still woke up ready and raring to go.
By Blaise's face, he really wished the man had not given that bit of news as he noticed Ron's expression to find out the twins were Submissive the Dominant Incubus. Blaise hoped the idiot would not make any problems not only for the twins' sake but also for the idiot since he, his sister, and parents have already been declared enemies of the Lupin-Weasley line. Something both former Weasley failed to acknowledge still trying to treat Fred and George as if they were still related. Even trying to contact Mr. Weasley, who was sending back their letters unopened, and get him to help their mother. The twins just ignored the pair treating them as if they were not even there leading to Draco asked if their parents had used some old family magic to make the twins unable to hear or see the pair one night in the dorms. Fred had just let out a laugh saying they had long since learned how to utterly ignore the brats.
"And you never knew?" Luna asked.
"As you might have learned when learning the spell yourself a Patronus is unique to everyone who cast it, but what Lupin might not have told you is that the form is dictated by the thing the caster loves most. So as you get older and find someone to love other than your Parents you may find your Patronus shifts form to match the new love of your life. Yet Lily had been the only one for me," Snape said sinking into his chair.
"So maternal already," Bathsheada said as she grabbed a submarine sandwich from the stack while pouring some milk for herself.
"Check the last line again Potter," Draco said in an annoyed voice as he speared a breakfast sausage link with his fork. Harry did as requested seeing the page mentioned that the body of the shared man had been found by Harry Potter and several students who had been in the forest to serve detention.
at the twins. This might have gone better if they were not aware of this spell being her preferred method of revenge on people from when they were growing up meaning they had the perfect counterspell to it. Letting himself get hit, to make the girl feel like she had accomplished something, George tilted his head back letting the bat made of his boogers fly out of his nose. But as they swoop down to attack him Fred cast
. Skipping over the fact that no thirteen-year-old, hell most adult Magicals, would have trouble with properly using it once let alone a whole school year. And from the stories I have heard, she did not use it well evidently becoming so stressed that she struck several fellow students near the end of term with no punishment once again. Having heard about her having access to the Time-Turner I meet up with some of my contacts within the Ministry and they told me that there was no paperwork that allowed her to have access to it," Lucius could not help but shift his left side of his lips a little in a ghost of a smile seeing the fool actually look uncomfortable in his seat.
"Um, can we try the Patronus?" Draco asked.
After sending the request for a resort to both Professor McGonagall and his Father Harridan also gave one to Lucius to pass on to the school board as well, but was surprised as the Twins asked if they could come over again with a couple of friends to add to Harridan and Draco's growing alliance. Draco wanted his mate to be protected and having a feeling that the people they chose could do that had agreed leading to the twins to visit the very next day. The were accompanied by two blonde girls one Harridan instantly recognized as Fleur and ran to see her only for Draco to let out a growl and wrap his arms possessively around Harridan and hold him close. "
"Thanks, Mrs. Malfoy," Harry said looking over the list seeing that there were more potions he was listed to have taken without being aware of it that had not appeared on the Gringotts test. "Why would these not appear on the test from the Goblins?"
During his first detention at Hogwarts Harry's life is saved by Draco.
"We can not take what we are too far Harryikens, just as you can't take your Allure too far," Fred said.
"Yeah sure you can ask them if they want to help out," Harrison said not wanting to order anyone around. Tumbus gave him a small salute and was about to leave again to pass on the word to look out for Dobby when Harrison asked another question. "Not to be rude but when I talked to Dobby his speech was a little more primitive as if he was either uneducated or young."
"H'rry," the oaf said seeing Potter's crumpled form.
But when he started to turn it into a rant reminiscent of Hermione, Harry knew he had to do something to break him off it lest they be out past curfew. It did not take Harry long to figure out what to do as he watched Draco speak with such passion and a fire seeming to burn in his normal board-looking eyes. Harry could almost see the blonde as a general trying to booster his troops' morale as Draco began to pace back and forth going into other problems he thought were happening at the school. Harry could not take it anymore as he stood up and blocked Draco's path causing the blonde to stop pacing but still kept talking. Harry licked his lips as he went from broke hoping it would end the diatribe as he moved closer to the blonde standing on his tiptoes and captured Draco's lips in a kiss. That shut Draco up whose eyes widen in shock from the unexpected kiss as he gently wrapped his arms around Harry's waist.
"It is just two stacks past the books on Magical Inventions in the History section," Draco explained not surprised Harry did not know it was located for it was not a well-used selection of books since none of them were ever used in any assignments.
"I will reduce the price and give you the book if you help me study for D.A.D.A. for I don't see me passing them with Umbitch's ban on casting the spells," Draco said making Harry realized that the blonde was not wearing his "Inquisitorial Squad Badge"
Inside his own mind, Harry was beginning to freak out a little from Draco's statement.  Him an Omega nothing could be worse than that.  Even having his new awaken sense leading him to Draco was not as bad as becoming an Omega.  From what he had read from the books in the library he would be forced to go through a Heat after he had awakened.  Thus it was a guarantee that he would have to experience it at the Dursleys.  He could only think of two situations neither of which were good outcomes.  His uncle would either kill him for this "new freakiness" or even more sickening is that either his uncle or cousin would take advantage of him during a Heat.  He would not put it past either his uncle or cousin to take advantage of him in such a state.  Recalling memories of when he was younger when his uncle had come into his room while drunk and had slipped into his bed.  Or some times when it had just been Dudley without his gang and he would use force Harry to jerk him off under threat of violence.  As the thoughts of being killed or raped by his family, Harry began to unknowingly release some fear pheromones.
"So how did you do mate?" Ron said looking up from his hands and saw Harry smiling.
"Yeah either way it will be funny as hell," George said who due to his position could not slap her back so he did it to Blaise who mock-glared at him.
"Nice to meet you, sir," Harry said shaking the offered hand.
All the while Harridan was saying, "Put me in Slytherin" over and over again in a sort of mantra.
"Yeah," Harry said knowing it was not just Draco's fault for he gave as well as he got.
"Where did you disappear to?" Ron asked him as Harry hastily began to fill his plate before the food left the table.
"I thought I heard you got expelled how can you use that spell?" Draco asked.
Harry like all students at Hogwarts during his first week of classes, back in their First Year, had been told about the small percent of the population that between the ages of fourteen and fifteen would become an Alpha or Omega. As the lesson taught by Professor McGonagall, as head of his House, she told them all that a person would gain a secondary gender only if they were from a Pureblood line meaning Harry had thought he would not have to deal with it, other than seeing it happen to his classmates in years to come.
Harry quickly finished his breakfast and left the table returning right to Gryffindor Tower. For part of what he told Ron was true as he gently slipped off Draco's cloak and put a change of robes out as he went to take a shower. Harry normally showered at the end of a day, rather than the beginning but not sure the paths he walked while he made his way down to the Slytherin Dorms the night before he thought it was better safe than sorry. Once he was clean he slipped into a set of his own robes though wondering what he should do with Draco's since as he wore them he had not really detected the scents of anyone else making it easier to move about the castle without feeling the need to throw up any time he was near any female other than Hermione. Though thankfully he did notice or didn't notice as the case was, any scent glands having appeared on his neck which at least meant that while he found Draco's scent enticing it showed he had not fully accepted the blonde as a possible Mate.
"Maybe Potter and the rest of the students should be returned to the castle," Professor Snape said.
"It was my Aunt," Harry said seeing Snape grip his wand tighter making Harry afraid he was about to be cursed by the man.
"Your Inheritance you know as a Veela?" Draco asked.
Near the end of class Professor Snape, after making sure everyone's Cleansing Potions had been brewed correctly directed them all to drink from them at the same time to not single anyone out. After his talks with Harry during the Occlumency lessons, Severus was sure that at least two people would get scrolls to appear after they drank the potion. But he was shocked as almost half the class got them with the students looking confused at the scrolls lying before them. Clearing his throat he got their attention before he explained," Since you, all created a basic Cleansing Potion it will not have gotten rid powerful enchantments that a person could have on them as well as some potions. The scroll that appeared before some of you is a list of any and all spells and potions that you have in your systems. It will be broken down into two parts the first part being what it was able to cleanse from you while the second part is items that it was able to detect in your system but was unable to deal with."
"Good is there also a way to get the items back which are listed as stolen?" Harry asked.
Fiding a new clearing the pair decided to end their walk and relax for a while as Neville Magiced a blanket for the pair to lay on. Settling on the blanket the pair cuddled together looking at the branches intertwined above them. Like people watching clouds, the pair smiled as they discussed the interesting shapes they found above them. Due to both their creatures' gentle and peaceful natures, it was not long before some small animals returned to the clearing, A small gray rabbit even was bold enough to hop over and onto the blanket, the pair of Mates were lounging on. It did not even run away as Theo absentmindedly reached over and scratched the rabbit under its chin as if it was a dog or a cat. The rabbit allowed the scratches before it hopped away leading to more animals to come over for pets and scratches from the pair.
Rather than respond to her statement he had both her and Ron join the next group to cast their Patronus. Harry paid close attention to the Patronus cast by the pair to see what he could find out about them. It did not really surprise him that Ron's Patronus resembled Crookshakes which as the animal closest related to Hermione showed the redhead had feelings for the bushy-haired witch. Hermione on the other hand had not produced either a rat or pigmy owl, the two animals that had been related to Ron, rather her Patronus had been a toad. Harry spent a moment wondering if she liked Neville but after a closer look saw that the toad she had created did not resemble Trever at all. As that group had been the last ones to try casting the spell Harry decided to call it a night and started to use the map to let everyone go. To make sure that Hermione did not continue the conversation from earlier he had her and Ron leave earlier. Which seeing the look on the redhead's face he was sure that Hermione was going to be distracted by Ron asking about her Patronus. He had explained his actions to Hermione saying it was a way to throw off Umbitch and her Squad by having them not leave with him for once. As he waited for everyone to leave before he pulled out the Invisibility Cloak he had hid in one of his inner pockets, which Draco had helped him expanded with an Undetectable Expansion Charm, and threw it over himself to make his way back to Gryffindor Tower.
On the night of his first tutoring session, he felt his hopes plummet as he saw the person tutoring in Potions was none other than his rival Draco Malfoy. "You can't tell me you need more help Potty. Word around the castle is that Professor Snape broke his own rules of giving special lessons to help you," Draco said.
"Well, you got to admit you are a little strange, maybe if you lay off mention the creatures only Fae can see," Pansy suggested.
After Lucius had purchased all of the missing books for Harry he headed to the Owl Post to send a message to the Head of the Hogwarts School Board to let her know about Madam Pomfrey's failure at her job, but also the fact that the Medi-Witch, Albus, and Severus were taking money from Harry's vaults. Lucius knew the Goblins would stop the transfer of funds and try to get them back for Harry but he also wanted the Board to look into the matter themselves. Before he headed back to the bank Lucius received an angry letter from Albus for taking Harry out of school. Lucius after reading the letter just ripped it up and sent the owl back without a reply being too angry at what the man had done to Harry he did not want to lay into the old bastard.
The note concerning his Marriage Contract to Ginny was two-fold with the first issue being that it had not been signed by any of his parents but rather filled out by Professor Dumbledore and Mrs. Weasley. The second issue was that since Harrison had gone through the change and had become an Omega his body could never respond to a female. While the new text that discussed the red flag on Shell Cottage was that since Harrison was the only member of the Hufflepuff/Smith Line his name had not been used to transfer the property to Mrs. Weasley's control. Having never even heard of someone by the name Gaunt, Harrison tapped the final asterisk on his results only to find that the shack owned by the family was listed as condemned as well as some Magical Sensors at Gringotts detecting some powerful object in the place.
"Are you ready for this?" George asked wiggling his eyebrows at everyone.
After a quick supper, Harry had quickly headed up to his rooms not wanting to spend much time in the Common Room with all the females around polluting the air for him. At least according to the books once he found a possible partner there was a way to put their scent on something so he could use it to block out any other scents that he found unpleasant. He must have been more tired than he had thought for without meaning to Harry had fallen asleep before any of his friends had come up to bed. Though he did wake up a little later to hear Ron's familiar snores filling the room before dropping off again.
Yet while Snape and Lily being friends despite their different Houses Harry's Father and the future Potion's Master seem to be unable to get along at all. Having heard that the pair were rivals he had expected something akin to his previous relationship with Draco but was surprised to see even in their First Year the pair would shot spells at each other when members of the staff were not around. Harry wanted to think his Father was just defending himself from young Snape but saw that James would be the instigator of the events and would sometimes bring back up in Sirius and later Remus while Snape only seemed to be friends with Lily.
"Does this bond do or mean anything?" Harry asked.
"What do you mean?" Draco asked sounding a little confused.
For his part Harridan was rather surprised that Fred and George did not know many of the spells he knew, as he tended to forget that as he performed the trials for Dumbles in his previous years he would be directed to learn certain things under the eyes of the man's daughter and pawns. As he did recall the fact, while guiding his friends in learning the spells Harridan recalled what he had learned from Lucius shortly after arriving at Malfoy Manor. Draco's Dad had wanted to find out what Harridan had meant when he had brought up Quirrell. After telling the whole Malfoy family what he had found while trying to protect the Philosopher's Stone the family was flabbergasted. "That was not me," Tom had said with a shudder at the thought of sharing another's body.
"Well, I can only assume Tuna Fish's attitude towards magic had not gotten any better. So once Lily had started to learn about Magic your aunt did her best to get rid of it through various means. One of the worst was shoving Lily down the stairs, and even though we had not gone to Hogwarts yet I borrowed my Mother's Potion book and with little training, I was able to brew a health Potion for her.
"Leave us," Draco ordered his roommates giving them all a dark glare as with some grumbling the group left.
But I digress no the real reason I owe you an apology happened when I spied on the Headmaster and overheard a prophecy," Snape said as his memory show the scene of Dumbledore meeting Professor Trelawney where the woman began to speak.
"He was pointing out that thanks to Hermione's so-called help I was turning in bad work," Harry said making the man give a snort.
"Would references of it be in the library?" Harry asked.
Containing Ron, Ginny, Molly Bashing, Good Slytherins, Smart Luna
As he passed the Headmaster Harry had been able to detect what smelt like Windex and red ink. This caused him to pause and not mention it to his friends for while the normal smells he had been able to smell was one thing the fact that he had been able to determine the color of ink was another matter entirely. As he got back into bed he could not help but take in Ron's scent of fireworks and silly putty, as well as Madam Pomfrey who smelled like candle wax and seaweed. Not focusing on the tale Hermione sharing with Ron about their trip to the past Harry tried to recall the lessons on Alpha and Omegas. This was rather hard for after hearing that the change only came to Purebloods and with his Mom being a Muggleborn he had only really listened to what the students had to do if classmates went through the change, but not the changes themselves. He recalled something about scent glands but he could not recall if those came to Alpha or Omegas. The one thing he really did recall that both Alpha and Omega could detect someone that was compatible with their scent and that scent would have some ties to his family. Harry did wonder how he would recognize his family scent due to him being so young when he had lost his family when he was so young. For he doubted he would find comfort in any scent that the Dursleys would give off.
"Father," Harry heard Draco say.
Draco comes home to his loving boiwife Harry after a day at the Ministry
"That is alright, young Heir if you are like some members of your family you will end up dealing with my kind on numerous occasions throughout your life," Elmblossom said giving him a small smile letting Harry see that another difference between this Goblin and the others he had met was the lack of sharpened teeth in their mouth. "So shall we begin? Or do you have any other questions about my kind?" Harry had a feeling this was a general question and not the Ritualist getting annoyed that he was wasting time.
"Very well let's just get this over with," Draco said as he allowed Granger to help him after the oaf of a gamekeeper. He knew that he would have been fine if he had gone to the Slytherin dorms for his injury would have been read by the special Charms Professor Snape cast at the start of the year to register if any of member of the House got hurt outside of class or Quidditch. The Charm was in place due to thanks to Dumbledore's very anti-Slytherin views some members of the other Hogwarts Houses bullied Slytherins if they left the dorms by themselves. Though as he thought about it there might not actually be help waiting in the dorms for him due to the lateness of the hour the report of his injury might not yet be noticed.
"Thank you, Master Grindstone may your coffers never run dry," Mr. Malfoy said as he and his son bowed to the worker.
Thinking he would have time to read the book next year Harry skipped to the end to read about Fleamont Potter. It was as he was reading this chapter from the book he saw this edition produced fairly recently for the start of the chapter it made mention of the recent death of Fleamont's son and daughter and had recently died from He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named. The way the chapter was written made it seemed as though Harry's grandparents had been alive when his mom and dad had been killed making him wonder why he had been sent to live with the Dursleys after they had died. He found his answer a couple of pages later when it went over the fact due to their already advanced age having been told about their only son's death had sent their heath into a tailspin. The author of the book even venturing that if their Grandson, Harrison, was not found and returned to them they did not think the pair would live that much longer. Harry was amazed to find out his real name was not Harry but Harrison but also the fact that Fleamont was also good at Potions having created a line called Slickeazy Hair tonics as a way to mess with the Potter family's untamable hair.
"Yes the Wolfsbane Potion the one that helped him keep control during his transformation," Harry said finding himself now knee to knee with Draco.
"Every meal you mean Magicals can brew Potions but you can't I don't know make a sandwich without using a House Elf," Harry said unable to stop a small snort.
I have changed some students Patronus to work better withing this storyline
Draco wished that he had been allowed to bring some scent blockers, but Hogwarts forbid the objects. It did not matter that due to him actually been born in November rather than March as most believed. It all came down to the mixture of the Malfoy family producing nothing but males and the secondary Black Line, such as his Mom came from, which produced nothing but females. It seemed the two bits of Family Magics would cause many offspring of his parents to die at a young age. He was in fact the third child born from Narcissa Malfoy, though due to the incompatible family magics the other two had died within three months of being born. Draco had been informed by his parents at the age of three that they had not wanted to suffer through the heartbreak of losing another child actually refused to give him a name until four months after he had been born.
"No idea," the man said aiming his crossbow at the crumpled form of the two-faced man. "See to H'rry while I handle him," Hagrid ordered easily lifting Quirrell's form onto one of his shoulders and turning around.
"Let's see if I can explain this properly. Most Magicals are considered truly adults when they reached the age of seventeen, however, a person who gains a secondary gender also considers adult so it is already could be considered a holiday for you but to keep the fact that you have gone through the change a Name Day celebration sounds believable," Luna said.
"You almost make it sound plausible," Harry said curling up into the blonde's chest.
"Well, she has a plan to prevent Dumbles from having too much control with the school board. My Papa since I am not of age is Steward of Gryffindor, and Draco's second father is Lord Slytherin so with Lupin there we would have three of the four Founder Lines and hopefully make some changes. I know they talked about bringing back the apprentice program who knows what else they could do," Harridan said.
"As if I needed another reason to dislike the man," Harridan said balling his left hand into a fist in a desire to punch the man on his crooked nose. Draco gently places his hand on the fist filling the room with calming pheromones until Harry un-balled his fist before taking his mate's hand.
"Have we meet?" Harry asked not recognizing the Goblin as the one he and Hagrid approached or Griphook during his first visit to the bank.
"I am not full of myself," Harry protested.
"The one you never showed up for?" Harry asked back.
"Well this calls for some food," Draco said with a smile as he wrapped his arms around Harry's waist and spun him around a couple of times.  "Though I can't really give you any other clothing I am afraid," Draco said looking down at Harry who was still in his normal sleepwear.  Which consisted of Dudley's old shirts which had been stained so much his cousin did not wish to wear them anymore, and a pair of sweat pants with the bottom of the legs rolled up multiple times.  "I can, however, lend you a cloak to throw over them until you can get changed," Draco said as he pulled out a cloak with Acromantula silk lining and throwing it over Harry's shoulders hiding his clothing.
"Yes, it seems that while James was a Dominant Veela his Submissive Creature Mate was not Lily but Severus Snape," Harridan explained.
Taking the paper after Theo and Neville were done with it Harridan began to read to see if it had anything else of importance. Flipping through it he found an article about Umbitch losing her job at Hogwarts due to possible favoritism being shown from Dumbles. Putting down the paper Harridan began to think as no one had mentioned that the Headmaster might show favoritism to his daughter, Hermione, just his third mate. As he recalled one such case of favoritism from a couple of years ago he pulled out some spare parchment and wrote a quick note to Draco's father.
"Yeah I guess I was leaning too much on my cooking skills and the non-standard measurements that come with it," Harry said.
"You do realize the test was just letting you know what creature you would become not that you can transform into it at the present time right?" Draco said leaning down and giving the other a kiss to the top of their head.
"Ah, then look no further as I said I would be happy to cast the votes during the board meetings," Dumbledore said.
"I had a feeling, after all, I had my arm impaled by a basilisk in our second year with no issues. Wait no forget that Fawks' cried on me so it was instantly healed," Harry said and was shocked to see his rival's face drain of color.
The group barely was waiting ten minutes before the Goblin, who finally introduced himself as Bonecrusher, Harrison's family Account Manager, came back sharing that there was a spot free in the next ten or so minutes for Harrison to get Cleansed. Promising to come back to the office to talk about the Marauders' Retreat with Draco's cousins, Bonecrusher led Harrison out of the room to one of the bank's Cleansing Chambers. Once inside Bonecrusher passed Harrison off to a Goblin named Silverwing who had Harrison change into a pure white robe and remove his glasses before he laid down on a platform in a small human-sized basin in the middle of the room. Once Harrison laid down, though wiggling a bit when he was not sure what to do with his arms before placing them on his belly as if he was trying to go to sleep. Once Harrison was motionless, for the most part, some panels slide aside in the basin as some liquids flowed into the basin, each liquid a different color that did not mix with the others leaving one-quarter of the basin yellow, purple, gray, and black. The multi-colored liquid when it was done filling in the basin left Harrison's back an inch or two submerged in the strange liquids. A group of Goblins came into the room all in light green robes with their hoods up moving to stand at various points around the basin and Harrison. The group of Goblins began to speak the same strange language he had heard Bonecrusher use earlier. As the Goblins began to speak, it began to feel as if the liquid he was partially in begin to tingle before he started to feel a numbness spread through his back. After a moment something distracted Harrison as it felt like clusters of bugs were moving under his skin, which while feeling incredibly weird was not that bad. At least until it reached his forehead and lightning bolt scare where it fell as if his body had caught on fire making him pass out.
"I um guess that is all settled then. As soon as young Ronald and Ginevra wake back up they will renounce their claim of family, on Fredrick and George," Dumbles stated and tried to hurry away.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Will you deliver this to someone up at the castle?" Harry asked the owl finishing the letter and using the last bit of ink in one of Dudley's old pens. The owl gave him a nod as Harry took his booklist from the bird and give him the letter. Harry hoped someone would come soon not only so he could find time to get his new supplies but also get away from the Dursleys. He had tried telling Professor Dumbledore at the end of last year that he had not wanted to come back to them based on how they had lied to him about his parents and how they had treated him, but was told that since they were his family Dumbledore was sure they cared for him but just did not know how to show it. When a member of staff came to see what his living condition was like he was sure it would change their tune and allow him to be well shut of them for good.
Harridan and his friends have some private celebrations over the twins' victory against the Fletchers
Lucius then led Harry and Draco back to one of Gringott's Floo rooms and took them to St. Mungos. Almost as soon as he stepped into the place he felt his wife's magic and knew that she felt his as well. Since he had not informed her about what had happened to their son he was not that shocked as she showed up while they were waiting in line to check-in. "Lucius what is the meaning of this why is Draco not at Hogwarts?" she asked arching an eyebrow at him and spoke in a voice that spoke of coming danger. Harry not knowing who she was but hearing the tone of her voice moved a little bit so his smaller form was blocked from her by Draco's larger body.
"Well it was rather dangerous but you know I was faking it right and if you had made a serious mistake I would have rushed in to fix it," Draco said rubbing the back of his neck.
At one point as he walked around Snape noticed Harry was at the stage of the procedure to let the Potion simmer for a bit and seeing that the son of his best friend and old school bully had already had the rest of his ingredients ready to add to the potion he decided to perform a low-level Legilimency attempt on the boy. What he saw shocked him as for once Harry was able to prevent him from getting too far into his mind as Snape was stopped by his Godson's sneering face. Figuring out Harry had discovered the Emotional Shielding approach Snape actually was quite proud of the boy, but he figured the next real lesson they had together he would teach Harry to focus more so that anyone entering the boy's mind would not find Draco's face thus give away the feelings both boys were beginning to have for each other.
As it would not actually hurt her Snape had no problem helping his son in dealing with the girl even informing Madam Pince about what they planned to do in her sanctum,  Even the Librarian was on board not really liking how the young girl treated her books.  While Harridan's friends had their own plans to help his son Snape moved forward in his own plans as he recalled seeing Harridan's results decided to have his Fifth-Years brew a Family Tree Potion just to find out about Granger being listed as related to Albus somehow.  He was not even going to let the girl accidentally mess up the Potion as he used her as the example for what the Potion was meant to do.  He could tell that she expected him to feed her some sort of poison.  Only by telling her, she would get a detention for her lack of trust in him was he able to get her to take the Potion.
"Susan wanted to talk to me," he said breathing in Draco's scent.
"And then there was the last term where she entered the Champions only area multiple times which could have lead to some international problems if the other schools thought she was passing on information to either Harridan or Cedric from you. But what is even more disturbing is a report that had been buried from shortly at the end of the last school year after the Durmstrang Students returned to their school. It seems that their School Healer gave each of the returning students a check-up to make sure they had not picked up anything from their visit. The Healer found something when he examined Champion Krum," Lucius said looking right at Albus who was still shifting awkwardly in his seat.
"Wow," was all Harridan could think to say not that it seemed the girl expected more.
"I guess but why make it sound like a holiday?" Harrison asked.
"I did collect the blood all rituals done here will not cause a person to feel pain, nor leave a scar as any cut is instantly healed," Elfblossom said gesturing to the pitcher of solution and the small switch of wood. Harry took hold of the wood and let out a small gasp feeling a more powerful spark than he felt when he used his wand. "Yes, it is intense for Yggdrasil is one of the various World Trees. But while it promotes a strong connection to Magic by old beliefs every Wand Maker in the world refuses to use it to produce wands lest the tress, which there are not that many off, be killed off," Elmblossom explained as Harry started to stir his blood into the solution within the pitcher. Elmblossom's voice took on a lighter and high pitch tone as they began to chant the ritual as Harry stirred. The voice almost making him feel as if he was falling into a trance watching to greenish-pink liquid start to change into a silver color.
Not feeling like he could trust either of his friends at the moment Harry decided to sit next to Neville in their next lessons which had been Potions. Rather than start the class right away, Snape asked everyone to raise their hands if they had a copy of
"Well, there is one pair of socks that I have a Pocket Sneakoscope in other than that no," Harridan said as he watched Draco pull out all the clothes from the trunk and put them into piles. The larger pile was all of Dudley's old clothes while the smaller was the five sets of school robes and one dress robe he owned as well as the pair of Vernon's socks containing the Sneakoscope.
"Why would I insult you Little One?" Draco asked confused.
"Then I offer you thanks," he said shocking her. "We have been trying to reach Heir Potter for years but our owls keep being sent back. We tried to reach him last year when he arrived with Mr. Hagrid," the goblin said shocking Charity for there should have never been any reason Hagrid of all people should have been with a student to bring them into the Magical World. "But they left before I could reach them."
"Leave now," Blaise said in a dark voice.
Mummy always knew Daddy would be coming back so she had set up a plan to make the world better for him teaching Hermione her place in the plan as well. Mummy had her pretend to be a Mudblood so she could get closer to Potter and make sure he stayed ignorant of the Magical World. Hermione recalled asking her Mummy about that when she was young for if Potter was being brought up as a prince as the stories went how could she make sure he would not know about their world. Mummy had laughed sharing with her some facts she had learned at the Ministry of Potter not living with any magical family in Brittian according to the census but also due to a tracker he had not left the island either. Mully had tweaker her nose playfully as she had Hermione guess what that meant and been so proud of her when Hermione guessed it meant he was living with Muggle trash like the boy's mother. Mummy had said that is why she had to pretend to be a Mudblood so she had something in common with the brat who caused her Daddy to go away. Mummy also stated that if she got close to Potter it might also lead to Dumbledore allowing her to spy on the man for her Mummy.
"For one thing Hermione," Harry said having to stop himself from calling her Granger due to how annoyed with her he was at the moment," it is not my book to lend. And secondly, as far as I know, you are not in danger of having someone performing Legilimency on you."
"I was told to come to talk to you if I had any question on being a Founder's Heir," Susan said perching on the top of one of the desks in the room.
"Oh quit being so melodramatic Potter," Crabbe said.
"Yes it is sir," Harry said, "is there something wrong Hagrid did not let me know of anything being missing."
"How can you be this dumb?" the Blonde asked "I mean your first couple of months of our First Year you were doing low EE work but you soon slipped into getting almost high D's and low A's."
"Why do you think it may be longer?" Filius asked.
"I quite agree which means we need to get inside now," Bathsheda said as they both headed back to the alley and secretly unlocked the backyard fence. Casting Notice-Me-Not and Dissalustionment Charms on themselves. Bathsheda then cast a Hover Charm on Charity floating her up to the window with the bars. Charity made short work of the bars first banishing before putting up an illusion so it would not raise any eyebrows from the Muggles. Seeing Harry inside the room doing some sit-ups she gently knocked on his window making him start. Knowing that he would be able to see her due to the charms she had on her to go unnoticed she cast a spell on the window which would allow him to see her through it.
"Hello Tumbus and these are not my guests but my Magical Guardians," Harrison said.
"Hello Prince Bonecrusher may the blood of your foes flow as freely as the money from your coffers," Severus said bowing low and exposing his neck in a true Goblin greeting.
Harrison goes to check out one of his properties.
"Alright I was warned about one of those so I actually did some researched," Charity said pulling out a small notebook.  "Alright, a Marriage Contract is usually set up between old Magical Families, or just really good friends.  They come about when the families have their kids gon on playdates with each other and the magic of both children responds well with one another.  Either that or if the child has not yet shown signs of magic when the playdate ends and the kids are to be separated they will get so upset that their magic will actually immerge.  Now according to the material, the Goblins allowed me to look at one a Contract has been put in place it strengthens the bond of magic between the two.  If the Contract is created legally ie. set up and signed by all legal parents or guardians the only way to break the Contract is by finding out that over the course of their life one of the children finds that their preference for partner changes.  As in a Contract between a boy and a girl when one of them finds out they prefer the same sex."
"I can't do that either for Neville asked me to go with him," Ginny said sounding a little glad she had accepted the invitation.
"What was your memory?" Colin Creevey asked from one of the front rows.
"But I didn't even do anything?' Harry said as he folded the paper up and handed it back to the blonde.
"Oh, Harry," Draco said wrapping his arms tightly around Harry's body as he released a calming Alpha scent.
"I would like us to start using a Tracking Spell on some of the homework. The student who brought to my attention about my coursebook also revealed they have recently found out that a student that has been "helping" them do their homework has been feeding them wrong information," he began.
Harry was shocked at the question not only for its own sake but for it was the second time Snape had stated his mother's name. "No, I would rather just be left alone yet each year something seems to happen that forces me to act."
"Neville," Harridan said climbing out of Draco's lap and helping the boy back to his feet.
"We have other things we also need to discuss Lord Prince such as your Son," Bonecrusher said as he pulled out items to perform an Inheritance test. "He came in just a short time ago and was found to be under several spells and Potions and since you state you have no memory of either them or claiming your Lordship I think it might be a good idea for you to undertake another test yourself." Severus rubbed the bridge of his nose before agreeing to hold out his wand hand to get his finger pricked to perform the test. As the results were being compiled Bonecrusher was summoned by one of his clients who had just woken up leaving Severus and the other Goblin. There was a moment of awkward silence before the results finished giving Severus a break as he read his results.
"What do you mean wings?" Harry asked turning his head as if to see a pair of wings sprouting out of his back.
"Well with your support, Severus we can finally get the board's, "she said in a way that made it sound like it was Dumbles that was responsible for blocking her "to bring back the apprenticeship program."
"All we need is your approval, young Heir," Bonecrusher said.
"Okay nice to met you again I guess," Harry said not sure of any protocol for dealing with Goblins for all he knew about Goblins was the stuff Professor Binns taught in his classes about them.
Harry's Magical Coma and waking up.
"I guess," Harry said not really sure but unwilling to admit his ignorance.
"I asked him, Mione," Harry said making her eyes widen in shock but before she could say anything the Ball began as the doors opened and the students walked past.
"Yeah I guess I was leaning too much on my cooking skills and the non-standard measurements that come with it," Harry said.
"Hey that is not my fault Mr. Potter never came in for his scheduled medical exam at the start of the year," Madam Pomfrey said.
"What does that have anything to do about it?" Harridan asked confused.
This did mean she had to deal with being dragged to Quidditch and even had to spend some time with those dumb Squibs before her Fourth-Year as she waited to get picked up by the family of Blood Traitors to go to the World Cup. What was worse she had to share a room with the Weaslette making her wish she could go home just so she could spend a full week inside a shower to scrub the scent and scum off herself. But it was all for her Daddy's eventual return, which he did at the end of the last school year. She really wished he had managed to kill off Potter so she could reveal herself, but on the upside, after spending some time with the Squbs she was brought to the headquarters of the group who had the gall to stand up against her Daddy. Only to find the Blood Traitor Bitch, Molly Weasley, prevented her from learning any of their plans to "stop" her Daddy.
Thankfully he had woken up before any of his family as it seems while he slept one birthday gift had been delivered. As he opened the card he saw it was from both Hermione and Ron proving to him that they were together wherever they were while he was stuck here all alone. This made him so mad he tossed out their gift, after making sure it was not something he could use before he got dressed for the day. Though he did regret it at the end of the day after he had eaten the wilted salad his Aunt had given him for dinner when he could have had chocolates.
"Is this it?" Mr. Malfoy asked taking the letter from him and flicking through the two pages inside of it.
"A couple of things," Harrison said, "first I need to find a Potioneering Elf to brew some potions for me. But I also have a question."
"Oh, I have read about something like that as well. It is something similar to when a Muggle can access incredible powers when their loved ones are in danger," Grange said.
Having really gotten into this story but no where near an ending point when I had to call it a night.  I have decided to change  the whole book into a Draco/Harry bunny farm for any stories I can think of so I can make a part 2 to it and finish it.
"While it is true that as an underage student you are not allowed to use magic outside of school there is a clause that permits Magicals to use magic to protect their own life. From the small bit you had written about in your note we shall be fine if not I shall deal with it," Charity said as she used her wand to unlock the door to his room and boldly walked out of it.
"Alright that answered the Marriage Contract, I guess for now, but what is an Inheritance Test?" Harry asked.
Harridan barely paid attention to Dumbles's announcements, hell he did not even notice when the new D.A.D.A teacher interrupted and took over for a bit. He did come back to himself a little as Luna helped show him the way to Ravenclaw tower. Where Harridan with half an ear listened to Professor Flitwick's start of term speech about rules and Quidditch trials as he wanted nothing more to do than sneak down to the dungeons and find out the password to Slytherin so he could cuddle with his mate. Rather than head out after Flitwick left them Harridan went in search of his new rooms finding he was sharing with Michael Corner and Terry Boot. Once inside the room he found his stuff before the bed furthest from the door and without even changing out of his robes fell into the bed missing Draco. Before his new dorm mates came up Harridan had already fallen fast asleep.
"Right the only thing he told me was that it was not being done by Voldemort," Harrison said making the pair wince at the name.
Dumbledore thought this had to be a lie for he made sure that no Gyrffindors ever became friends with members of Slytherin House lest they corrupt his Lions. "I am sure she thought she was doing what was best," Albus said.
"Um, my Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon," Harry answered.
"I second that," Filius said wondering if that was why some of his students were having trouble in the last couple of years. He wondered if Harry had found out about a missing text, which could explain his improvement over the last couple of weeks.
Looking up from the book Harrison asked, "Do you know of Dorean Black?"
Snape showed Harry multiple scenes of his "battles" with James and his friends which all came to a head at the end of Snape's Fifth Year, at least as far as Harry could tell due to the O.W.L.s test that Snape showed him. "This is one of my worst memories from school," Harry's Snape said as he showed an altercation with the Marauders in which Lily tried to rush to his aid. Harry could not help but gasp as he saw the young Snape call his Mother a Mudblood which caused tears to form in her eyes as she ran away leaving Snape to the mercy of James and Sirius.
"Hey that is not my fault Mr. Potter never came in for his scheduled medical exam at the start of the year," Madam Pomfrey said.
"Sorry, sir," the redhead said unclenching his fist.
"I am Fredrick Gideon Weasley-Prewett also a part of a Mirror Twin, obliviously, my dream is to open a sweet shop," Fred said.*1
Soon enough the lights in the hall went out as spots lights fell on him and the other Champions and their dates. Seeing it as a sign that the dancing was about to start Draco got out of his seat and held his hand down to pull Harry to his feet. This time Harry took the blonde's hand and was easily pulled to his feet before he leads Harry onto the dance floor. Once they moved into position Harry was not really sure what to do next for apart from the single lesson when Professor McGonagall taught them to dance as well as announcing the Yule Ball Harry had never really danced before. Once more Draco took the lead as he had Harry place one of his hands on Draco's shoulder while the blonde took hold of his other hand. Draco's other hand was wrapped around Harry's form and placed in the middle of Harry's back. "Just follow my lead Harry it will be alright," Draco said in a whisper as the music started. Doing as ordered Harry let Draco lead the dance as they moved to the music as Harry did his best not to look at the crowd and see a lot of shocked faces from them and some glares aimed his way as well. "You're doing great Harry just focus on me block them all out," Draco said as to Harry's shock the blonde actually dipped him before he used the hand on Harry's back to pull the smaller brunette closer to him than before.
