,” Draco finished, resting his head against the wall. “Well then, you’ll be glad to hear that the Slytherin team is doing abysmally,” he sighed.
In that moment, Draco looked not only pained but also completely unfazed. His face couldn't decide on an expression of how he was feeling.
“So where are we going on this mystery date?” Draco asked, as they wandered down the street, Harry’s fingers brushing against Draco’s. He wasn’t yet sure of how Draco would feel about holding hands in public yet.
“The twelfth?” Draco asked. “That’s Harry’s trial,” he said, now wondering if he’d be able to talk to Harry at all before school began.
, what the fuck is going on?” Ginny asked again, looking at Malfoy in incredible distain, as if she wanted nothing more than for him to spontaneously combust as well as bewilderment.
Harry woke up, although rather reluctantly, the day after Samhain. Even though he wished he could have stayed with the Malfoys (and Draco had offered), he knew if he didn’t return to Grimmauld Place he would never have gone to work, and, for the first time in a while, he knew exactly what he wanted to do; he wanted to resign, to quit being an Auror
“It’s endearing Draco, admit it,” Harry teased. Draco rolled his eyes and Harry couldn’t help but laugh.
much harder their lessons would become in the next year. Pansy pulled a deck of exploding snap cards from her pocket, and they almost began to play a game, before Blaise reminded them that grass was flammable, and he didn’t want to risk spending the last few weeks of the term in detention for almost burning down the school.
“We should just be thankful nothing was burnt to be honest,” George added, sitting where Hermione had been sat. “Hi ya’ Harry,” he grinned.
“Thank Merlin,” Harry muttered, pulling himself to his feet, making sure to pick up the book he had found as he did.
“I’ve not a clue, neither do they,” Harry continued, leaning into Draco with a sigh. “Dumbledore’s plans aren’t brilliant, are they?” he asked, with a humourless chuckle. Draco hummed in agreement. “I’m not even mad at them –
Harry laughed, leaning into Draco. “I did,” he said, with a smile of an old man fondly looking back on his life, not a fifteen year old condoning it.
Harry felt his face burn. “If we ever reach that point, I guess he’ll be the one to ask first,” he joked, trying to ignore the fluttering in his stomach at the notion.
Malfoy kept his calm demeanour, only further agitating Harry and raised an eyebrow. “That’s what you want to know? Why? Not how or whether it was a joke?” he asked, staring back at Harry with a similar intensity to Harry.
to add to the confusion. “I hope you appreciate this,” Malfoy said, taking a deep breath. “Don’t trust Kreacher Harry, there are many Blacks he can listen to and he tends to have a habit of lying to anyone else.”
for one am excited to spend the next seven years with you both,” she grinned, falling dramatically onto the seat opposite Draco and Blaise. “We’re all going to have so much fun in Slytherin.”
Draco sat up. “Harry,” he called out. Harry froze, facing away from Draco, who’s vision had now adjusted to the light. “Nightmares?” he asked.
– it’s a peacock,” he said, refusing to look at Harry, who was grinning like a man who had won the lottery.
Harry sat on the bank, just a few feet from Draco. “I didn’t know anyone else would be here,” he said, as the wind turned into a soft breeze.
He felt as if his ribs were trying to crush his lungs and he gripped the sides of the sink as if without them he would die.
However, every time he walked home; he found his eyes scanning the park for the two. He wasn’t sure why, he convinced himself it must be because he missed Teddy, but whenever his eyes wandered to the pond, he scolded himself, telling himself he was bordering on stalker behaviour. For the rest of the week, he didn’t see them by the pond.
“Don’t knock it till you’ve tried it Malfoy,” Harry said, wagging a finger at Malfoy who waved his hand dismissively.
As soon as Malfoy left, a noise of clattering china and boiling water filled the shop, drowning out the quiet chattering from the few people in the shop. Harry could see the counter in the corner of his eye and watched as Malfoy gracefully danced around the space behind the counter, occasionally disappearing behind a door to where Harry assumed was a kitchen.
“Absolute blasphemy Potter, it’s a privilege for anyone to get that close to me,” Draco scoffed, lifting his chin up.
Harry’s jaw practically hit the floor. “I – you – it didn’t – what?” he stumbled over his words, watching as Draco looked more and more worried.
, something is wrong.” Pansy stood still in the middle of Draco’s apartment, looking impatiently at him, waiting for an answer.
Muttering a hello in return, Draco continued to stare at the fire, glancing at Cedric to see that he was also watching the fire.
Draco had no idea what he wanted. He had contemplated the idea of being in other houses, allowed himself the fantasy of being anyone other than a Slytherin, a Malfoy, but did that mean he didn’t want to be a Slytherin? “I don’t think I did,” Draco replied, his voice timid and his words seeming lost. “But it was
night, the usual,” he said, with complete sincerity, making Harry snort with laughter. “But yes, it’s been like living in a different reality,” Draco admitted.
“That I’m feeling a little under the weather,” Draco said, earning a look from Pansy. “He’ll hex me you know,” Draco said, trying to find any other excuses but he had exhausted all of them.
As they began to walk around the park, Harry felt a warmth fill his stomach, and he couldn’t help but stare at Draco. “You know what would make these even better?” Draco asked, pulling Harry from his lovestruck trance. “Apples,” he grinned.
She blinked, shaking her head. “Anyway, Harry, do you want us to come with you?” she asked. Harry was grateful she didn’t just assume they would be joining him.
“You haven’t seen the common room when there’s only one slice of bakewell tart left,” Draco muttered, deciding to hand over the card. “Can I have the Queen of Spades?”
Harry was replaying that memory in his head as the train pulled into the station. The volume on the platform went from a hum of chatter to a buzz of laughter and Harry was on the lookout for Teddy.
Draco wandered through the corridor of the train, occasionally pausing to look out at the passing towns and the countryside. As the train hadn’t been moving for long, he passed many people who were still trying to find their friends, or simply a place to sit. Some people were failing, rather hilariously in one case, to lift their trunks into their compartments and Draco didn’t know how to feel about hearing that there was a tarantula in a near-by compartment.
“What Hermione means is,” Ron interrupted. “We’re worried for you mate, really worried,” Ron said, his eyes fixed on Harry who shuffled awkwardly.
“Narcissa,” Andromeda glared. “Was that truly necessary?” she asked, placing a hand on Draco’s shoulder.
“Oh,” he said. “OH, are you seeing someone?” Ron asked, excitedly, and George couldn’t help but laugh.
“When I was your age, maybe,” Sirius muttered. “And not if Remus was playing, no one can beat our Moony.”
The news of Potter’s career had been everywhere for the first few years after the war, in every tabloid you could get your hands on. Apparently, he had tried almost every profession you could think of; professional seeker, defence against the dark arts teacher, auror. He worked in the Weasley Twin’s joke shop, Muggle cafes, even tried a ministry job. Then, as Potter seemed to have a knack for doing, he decided to pursue the most obscure and difficult job imaginable; wand making.
Andromeda chuckled, a laugh which was similar to his mother’s but richer and deeper. “I do,” she replied. “Your Uncle is a Muggleborn, you see,” she told him, watching as his eyes widened, filled with millions of questions.
Mr Weasley shook his head. “In all fairness Molly, I agree with the sentiment,” he sighed, causing all those in the room who weren’t at the Ministry, to glance between the two with matching frowns.
“Well, you’re not going to like – is that Harry?” he heard Remus ask, probably gesturing to Sirius’ shard of the mirror.
I’m fine,” he said, waving his hand and returning to his thoughts. His aunt gave him another look that he couldn’t figure out.
Crumpling the letters in one hand, he stared at the floor, feeling a swell of anger, sadness and numbness.
“Alright,” Hermione said, sipping from her coffee mug. “But just know that if Molly hears about this, she won’t let it go,” she smiled.
be careful,” he said. “Anyway, did he ever tell you about the pranks? Hagrid didn’t have any details on them.”
“Alright,” he said, sitting up on the seat. “So, your wand suggests that, in the past, it looked to others like you had the capability to perform dark magic, but internally, you’d never be able to live with yourself if you did.” Draco was shocked at how accurate that was. “There was a time you had to pick between destruction and creation, and you didn’t know what to believe.” Draco opened his mouth to ask how this related to it not working. “If it doesn’t work for you anymore, it means you’re less unsure about yourself and you picked your path.”
Sirius laughed as Lupin handed them all a cup of tea. Draco wasn’t the biggest fan of tea, but he drank it, nonetheless. “Are you staying for long Andie?” Sirius asked, all prior teasing forgotten. “The Weasley’s won’t be here for a while, Molly took them back to the Burrow to tend to the animals.”
, just knowing you’re OK,” Ron trailed off, trying to find the words to convey what he wanted to. “You’ve never been the kind of bloke to talk about feeling, and we’ve never minded because you still told us what was going on,” Ron sighed, moving his hand from Hermione's shoulder to Harry's. “We want to know what’s happening with you.”
Once they reached the door to the Potions classroom, Harry noticed that everyone was huddled together to keep warm and he bit back a smile when Hermione muttered about how everyone learnt the same spell. However, Harry saw that Malfoy was standing apart from everyone else, looking unfazed by the temperature of the corridor, most likely because he too used the spell to keep warm. Harry scowled at how unbothered Malfoy looked. He didn’t know why, but seeing Malfoy leaning against the wall with a grace only ever presented
Cedric smiled at Draco, the light of the fire making it seem wider than it was. “So why won’t you let them do the same for you?” he asked.
Sirius grinned. “Should have seen him when he arrived the other day, he got in a shouting match with dear old Mum for about an hour, it was impressive,” Sirius admitted. “No one wanted to stop him.”
“Thirty-four,” Draco said. They both chuckled as Evelyn looked bemused. “Unofficially, would you say almost two months?”
shocked,” said Potter, his voice laced with sarcasm. “This is why you need to get frequent checks on these things, honestly.”
Glancing at the clock on the wall, Harry noticed it was almost four o’clock. Without wasting another second, he quickly rummaged around the kitchen, in an effort to make tea that would be ready as Andromeda arrived.
He saw Harry grin in the corner of his eye. “It’s to do with values isn’t it? So, it would make sense for families to be in the same house.”
Harry pulled away, using his thumb to wipe away the tears Draco had tried to hide. “I know,” he said, his expression sombre.
The snow was yet to melt over the grounds of Hogwarts, dampening everyone’s post-Christmas mood – which no one thought could get any lower with the return of Umbridge’s Defence lessons. No one was seen in the corridors without a hat and scarf, and friend groups huddled in front of any available heat source.  Fred and George had tried to lift peoples spirits with an impromptu snowball fight that almost got the entire school involved, but Professor McGonagall swiftly put a stop to it when Lee and Fred created a snow canon that George then levitated around the battlefield, hitting all unsuspecting students with a blizzard of snowballs – she said it was due to safety concerns, but Harry suspected she didn’t want to give Umbridge an excuse to expel them.
Harry groaned, lifting his head. “I was acquitted,” he replied, and the entire room breathed a sigh of relief. “But the Ministry can go
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Draco said, straightening his back. “You two are my best friends,” he grinned, linking arms with them both.
Harry felt his shoulders relax. Of course Draco had told them everything. It was the most likely conclusion, but he was still wary around the Slytherin duo.
“I won’t,” she replied, and Draco felt his stomach drop. “But you won’t be alone, in fact, you’ll just be with more of our estranged family.”
don’t apologise. Whilst I appreciate the thought, it’s not your fault.” Draco placed his teacup down on the table. “I’ve had my time to grieve, I’d rather move on and remember her in how I raise my son,” he said, looking into Harry’s eyes, expecting to see pity but he see’s something else. It seems like admiration, but Draco shakes the thought. “Anyway, what about you? Are you still seeing the Weasley?” he asked, curious. Harry was somehow very good at keeping his love life out of the papers.
“Wow, now I can die happy,” Draco muttered, his voice filled with sarcasm. “Harry Potter told me I’m a good seeker.”
Harry let out a bark of laughter. “We’re wizards,” he chuckled. “And we’ve been lugging these books around the shop,” he said, baffled at how they could both forget such information.
“Yes, well, Master Sirius asked me to tell you that Mister Potter has arrived,” Kreacher muttered, still squinting at Draco.
“Mightn’t it?” Harry chuckled, earning a small laugh from Teddy who nodded, arms wrapped tight around Harry. “Well, if you want a hot chocolate, I’m afraid, you’ll have to let go,” Harry said, biting back a smile when Teddy violently shook his head. “I’m not going anywhere Teddy, I promise,” he said, and Teddy looked up at him.
Harry wrapped the silky fabric around his body, and chuckled as Draco’s jaw went slack, his lips parting and his eyes shining. “Holy Salazar and Merlin,” he whispered, pausing to choose what question to ask first. “And this was your Dad’s?”
The cold was biting at Harry’s neck as he tightened his cloak around him, hoping to repel the cold. He tucked the invisibility cloak further under his arms and waited for a familiar head of white-blond hair.
Blaise scoffed, and he would put a heavy bet on Pansy grinning like a Cheshire Cat. “Traitor,” Blaise mumbled. “At least tell her it’s impolite to kill your friends,” he pleased.
“It was an arsehole move and he shouldn’t have done it,” Draco persisted, as if Harry hadn’t said anything at all.
Upon seeing their confused expressions Remus smiled. “You weren’t the only one I had frequent meetings with Harry,” Remus explained. “Draco took quite a liking to my collection of Muggle classics.”
“Me,” Draco replied, his voice soft, but certain. He wasn’t sure if Harry could see that Draco was watching him with a concerned eye, but he hoped Harry knew that Draco meant every word he said.
It was then, that Draco noticed the sunrise, turning the sky a soft green and yellow. “Morning,” Draco yawned, rubbing at his eyes.
could get him in a lot of trouble, and I think it would be the same if the Ministry got involved in his life.”
“I put two sugars in my tea Potter, that’s hardly the same,” Malfoy replied. “Seven sugars means that you are practically drinking milky sugar water,” he grimaced.
“I know Dray, I know, but I made a complete fool of myself and I don’t think I can look her in the eye without spontaneously combusting,” she groaned, burying her face in one of the few unpacked pillows on the sofa.
“It’s because you have subtle gay undertones,” Harry teased, leaning towards Draco, who looked horrified.
“Wouldn’t dream of it Blaise,” Harry grinned. Blaise sighed as if it was painful to hear and Parkinson chuckled.
Harry put the back of his hand to his forehead, feigning insult. “How could you? Daring to feel tired at midnight? And after the pizza I ordered you! Where is the gratitude? Young people these days!”
Harry dropped down into his chair and stared at the fire as it fizzled back down to small orange flames. He knew it wouldn’t go down well with Ron, but he had quietly hoped that he would at least accept the fact that Harry could be friends with them both.
“We could have been friends, you know. When I first met you in Diagon Alley, when you weren’t showing off for all your Slytherin friends, I thought you were pretty cool.”
Flinging himself from the bed he pulled off his night clothes and left them strewn across the bedroom floor as he raced into the bathroom, pulling the handle of the shower and letting the icy spray hit his body. The cold made short work of his… problem… but the image of Draco proved harder to chase away.
Racing into his bedroom, Harry towel himself off at lightening speed and pulled on his loosest pair of jeans, grabbing his glasses from the bedside table and checking in the mirror. But it was no good. NOTHING was hidden, in fact the excess fabric seemed to only make matters worse as it allowed for a greater ‘tenting’ visual.
Draco fell silent. The easy banter they had established ripped away, casting a shadow over the pair and Harry scrambled to rectify it. “I just mean,” he sighed deeply, “Oh, I don’t know what I mean.”
“Well for the past nineteen years she has been making them MY values. I feel like I’ve turned on her,” Draco said sadly, dropping the piece of toast he had been holding back onto the plate.
Harry nodded. “He just doesn’t know you like I do. He’ll come around though, he just needs a bit of time.”
Narcissa was sat in a high-backed chair with a book open in her lap, though she didn’t appear to be reading it. Her eyes were unfocused, and she emitted a soft, melodic hum, as if remembering some song she had long forgotten.
Draco gave a small laugh at this. “Well, the tea cups tell me otherwise,” he said, his eyes flicking to the cups on the table. “I’m starting to wonder about your reasons for inviting me over.”
“It looks like those two are already best friends,” Draco joked, intertwining his fingers with Harry’s. Harry chuckled, rubbing his thumb over Draco’s hand.
The daunting realisation of his kiss with Malfoy must have shown on his face because Malfoy sighed. “I said you wouldn’t like it,” he smiled softly at Harry, his eyes expressing what his face refused to – sorrow. Harry had never been more confused in his life, even more than when he was eleven and he was told he was a wizard, but Malfoy
I’m right, I’m always right,” Draco said, embracing Scorpius in a sideways hug and kissing his forehead.
“That settles it then,” Remus declared, sending a smile in Harry’s direction. “Next weekend, we’ll visit you in Hogsmeade.”
“He has Sirius,” Harry responded, and Ron’s eyes popped out of their sockets as Hermione pursed her lips.
“Are Saturdays busy then?” Harry asked, unsure if he’d ever seen more than six people in the shop at once.
When nothing happened, Harry saw Malfoy open one of his eyes and take a peek at Harry, who hadn’t moved from his position but had his eyebrows furrowed as he stared at Malfoy. “What do you think I came here to do?” Harry asked.
“No!” Draco said quickly, holding their hands tighter. “I- I like holding your hand, it’s nice,” he said, his voice getting quieter as he spoke. His face grew hot.
Andromeda was paler than the last time he’d seen her, with her dark brown curls appearing as if they were black. Though there was no need for concern; every winter she became paler from the lack of sunlight. Harry assumed it was a Black trait as not only was Teddy the same, but he had found photos of Sirius when he was younger and noticed he was a lot more tanned than when he had been living at Grimmauld Place. She still held herself with the grace of a Black too, something Harry found similar to the effortless elegance Draco had, and on occasion Sirius too.
“Died?” Draco finished, with an amused smile. “I think I saw my Father once, at my hearing,” he sighed, turning to look at Harry, resting his cheek on the sofa. “I don’t miss him either. I know I probably should, even just a little, but I really don’t.”
think he’s really nice,” he said, walking away from the two of them to sit on the sofa. Harry and Draco looked at each other.
Harry reappeared a moment later, this time not stumbling over the roots of the trees. He was holding 4 boxes, each the same and Draco thought for a second, he saw Harry look confused but when he blinked, Harry was smiling again.
the hat began, and Draco felt his anticipation rise until his heart felt as if it was about to give out. “HUFFLEPUFF,” the hat yelled.
“No, it’s not you either,” he assured before removing his glasses and rubbing the bridge of his nose. “Merlin,
Only eight people (including Hermione) made a potion that Snape deemed worthy enough of testing. Each person brought a phial of their potion up to the front and drank its contents, before having to explain the sensations caused by the potion. Probably wanting to prolong his suffering, Snape had decided that Harry would be the last person to test a potion.
It was only when he found the Draco constellation that his eyes began to sting. He pushed he palms of his hands into his eyes to try to stop himself from crying.
Harry bit back a chuckle, stumbling slightly as the eight-year-old bounced up and down. Before he could respond, Scorpius continued, “I’m glad you said you’d celebrate with us,” Scorpius grinned. “Dad gets lonely during Samhain, he thinks he’s great at hiding it, but he’s not.” He suddenly came to a halt, and once again, Harry stumbled, trying not to fall over Scorpius. “Shoes!” he exclaimed, dragging Harry back to the door.
“Yes well, we didn’t exactly lie, but that’s beside the point. Harry are you all right, what happened?” Hermione asked. “You just, collapsed and started, well, muttering,” she said, glancing at Ron who nodded to confirm the story.
“About the same,” Draco said, shrinking into his seat. “I still haven’t actually heard from my parents, and people keep asking me if – if
he asked, starting to get a little concerned. It appeared he wasn’t the only one as he noticed McGonagall watching him closely.
Remus appeared to have a realisation and his hand slid from Sirius’ shoulder to his hand as the word ‘
As soon as they reached the cave, Sirius transformed back into his human body and tackled Harry in a hug, knocking him back slightly. “I missed you Cub,” Sirius muttered, and Harry hugged the man back, clinging to his Godfather.
Harry felt a gentle pull at on his sleeve and noticed Scorpius was looking at him with his eyebrows furrowed. “What does ‘
“But not for Padfoot,” he assured. “We’ll be careful Cub, we promise, but we’re not going to ignore this, we’re your family – your Godparents, and we love you too much to pretend this isn’t happening.”
This set Harry off laughing. “You’re a confusing one Malfoy,” he replied, placing his head back onto his shoulder, purposefully shaking his head to tickle Draco’s neck.
Draco was buzzing with anticipation; it had been bubbling up inside of him for the rest of the summer since he had gone to Diagon Alley. The only people who would listen to his excessive ramblings were the house elves. Narcissa quickly had to save them after one afternoon when Draco followed them around all day, explaining how he was going to find all the secret tunnels and corridors in Hogwarts. He then moved onto the peacocks, and whilst Narcissa had tried to insist that they couldn’t truly understand him, Draco didn’t care, because they looked as if they were listening.
Neither of them said anything for a moment, they just stared at each other, trying to figure out the others’ motives.
Nodding, Harry drifted closer to Draco. “They’re incredibly beautiful,” Harry said, trying not to grin as he saw Draco’s eyes widen and he looked away.
Chuckling, the Slytherin duo glanced back at Harry, who was watching their interactions curiously. Their friendship was different to those he had with his fellow Gryffindor’s, but it reminded him of Fred and George – if Fred actually listened to George and the two of them managed to keep their cool.
“I’d never,” Harry interrupted, shaking his head. “That's not for me to tell them. It’s just, I was thinking about who might be able to help you and before you say anything, I
“Potter,” Malfoy greeted, leaning his elbows on the counter. “Gracing us with your presence again I see.”
A week after Harry’s last letter, he awoke, rather abruptly, to the sound of raised voices. He was somewhat thankful for the interruption of his dreams, as there were only so many times he could dream about Cedric dying before his eyes. He knew it was his aunt shouting, but he had no idea why, and the lingering thoughts of his nightmare still clung to him.
Harry glanced at Ron. “Dinner’s only just gone in, it’ll be at least an hour and a half so as long as they don’t pick FrizzlingStacks you should be fine,” Ron shrugged.
“Kreacher, tell me the truth. Is my cousin, Sirius Black, at home with you?” Draco asked, and Harry saw Kreacher’s ears flatten as he grimaced, unhappy that he had to do what Draco asked.
When Ron quit, that changed. Harry didn’t blame Ron for quitting (he had lost count of the times he had thought about leaving the Aurors himself, so it would be quite hypocritical) and he was glad that Ron had decided to stay at home with his children, but he knew it would make being an Auror incredibly lonely.
Draco had been shown to his dormitory, but he didn’t stay once everyone had fallen asleep and he returned to the common room. Even in his tired, confused state, he appreciated the warmth and the soft glow of the Hufflepuff common room.
Harry found himself taking a step closer to Malfoy. “I want to know,” he said, surprised at the lack of ferocity in his voice. He wasn’t demanding an answer, but encouraging Malfoy to tell him, something he had never done – although neither of them needed much encouragement to talk in this state.
okay,” Draco grinned. “You won’t be the only one, there are many people who come from families who don’t know about magic,” Draco explained, hoping his words were comforting. From the way the boy’s shoulders relaxed, it looked like they were. “I can explain them if you’d like?” he offered.
a lot to deal with - also, I bring you hot chocolate and watch you read, so we’re both avoiding reality a little bit,” he grinned. Draco rolled his eyes, wondering if he could return his crush to a shop of some kind.
Harry glared playfully at Draco. “No,” he deadpanned, and Draco looked shocked for a minute before realising Harry was being sarcastic.
Over the next few hours, they fell into a routine. Harry could see why Draco loved the teashop so much. He enjoyed talking to people, getting their orders, and seeing how much they enjoyed the tea Draco would make. Even when the orders started to slow, Harry continued to help, not only because he wanted to, but because he found that he enjoyed it.
“We’ll fail Potions together mate,” he confirmed with a nod and the two chuckled. Hermione looked mortified.
Harry chuckled. “It’s okay,” he said, knowing it would be hypocritical of him to say anything else. “I’m no stranger to accidental magic. When I was just a bit older than you, I accidentally set a python on my cousin.”
Draco nodded wisely. “I knew you’d see reason,” he said, making a bee line directly to the book. He gingerly picked it up, as if concerned it would bite him. Harry bit back a chuckle as Draco did this and Draco repaid him with a glare. “I don’t want to damage it!” he insisted, as Harry raised his hands in surrender. Draco raised an eyebrow, challenging Harry to say more on the matter.
Harry started to blink furiously, whether to stop himself from crying or because he couldn’t understand Draco’s sentiment, he didn’t know. Draco hadn’t ever considered that Harry was at fault, which made him wonder who had.
“Well, that’s okay,” Draco said, smiling at the boy. “No one really knows before they go there, do they?” Draco then remembered that this boy might not know about the houses. “Wait, do you know about the houses?”
but – I mean you don’t have to – if you – it’s just that,” Harry said, going darker with each word and Draco laughed.
“He’s asked if we’d like to go to a Christmas market on Saturday,” Harry told him, hoping, just a little, that Teddy would say yes. “He has a son too, Scorpius, just a little younger than you, so it would be the four of us,” he said. “
requests like being allowed to eat every day or have clothes that fit!” he snarled, his breathing shallow as his anger swelled inside of him like a balloon. “
Twenty minutes ago, if someone had told him that he would want to kiss Malfoy, it would have sent him into hysterical laughter. Although now, the faint memory his lips had of Malfoy’s made his heart skip a beat and his head spin.
“Harry,” Draco whispered softly. When Harry hummed in acknowledgement, Draco continued. “Your hands are shaking, are you cold?” he asked, and Harry glanced down at his hands (which felt perfectly fine) and noticed they were indeed shaking.
Harry glanced around them dramatically. “Unless the tree roots know of this reputation, you don’t need to worry,” he said, grinning. “And what reputation?”
your lack of survival instincts? You waltz headfirst into danger! And don’t get me started on how clumsy you are,” Draco chastised. “If anyone needs protecting, it’s you.”
As he sat down at the table, Draco glanced at Harry, who was staring at him, his eyes curious and concerned. Draco smiled at him as best he could, but Harry was still staring at him. With a sigh, he folded his arms on the table, hiding his face within them, and tried not to think about how his father would react.
“I’ll try,” she shrugged, kneeling down to get to Scorpius’ height. “Make sure he doesn’t do anything stupid whilst I’m gone will you?” she whispered to him, loud enough for Draco to hear, and Scorpius nodded enthusiastically.
Climbing out of bed with the blanket, Draco sat opposite Harry, their feet just touching. He wrapped the blanket tightly around himself.
Harry offered an arm to Teddy, who held on tight to Harry’s arm, bouncing on the heels of his feet. They apparated with a loud crack, drowned out by the whistles of the trains in the station. The two of them landed in the kitchen of Grimmauld Place, Harry grabbing Teddy’s arm as he almost slipped on the kitchen tiles.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Yes Potter, that is indeed what I said,” he drawled with a smirk. “You just drink it as it is.”
Draco gave a firm nod at that, biting his lips when he saw Potter knitted his brows together in deep thought. “Do you have anything in mind?”
“Can't we just go to the future, bring things from there then send Albus and Scorpius back along with your blood?” asked Potter innocently, and Draco was not sure if he wanted to pat his head or give them a good whack.
Zabini let out an amused smirk, “Ah, I can see where Albus got that mouth of his.” he said cheekily and laughed when Harry got flustered.
Harry's eyes widened, heart started hammering through his ribcage as he looked at Ginny unbelievably. "What?"
An elegant snort was heard followed by a goodbye kiss that was dropped on Harry's cheek before he can even comprehend what has happened and Hermione quickly shouted; “We'll catch you soon!”
“Sweet, food!” exclaimed Albus, who moved in an instant towards them followed by Scorpius and took his spot next to Ginny whilst Scorpius sat next to Harry.
Albus snorted a laugh, “Remember when dad got a bad hex from a raid and was submitted to St Mungo’s but papa didn't come because Aunt ‘Mione and him was in the middle of a discussion that he said much more important than dad’s tiny scratch.”
Glassy green eyes focused on grey, and Draco drew a soft smile for the man. “Do you miss your husband?”
Harry frowned at him. “Now, that's ridiculous. Don't you dare say you never thought about it. Black hair, green eyes. Who else got that if it was not me?”
He has been pursuing this man non-stop, hoping that the feelings will be reciprocated- even when he knew it will never happen- not in a million years. Yes, it was just a mere crush at first, but it turned into love along the way knowing him. It felt quite bizarre. He doesn't know what to do with the outcome.
He saw Potter shrugged, glancing at She Weasley in a brief moment. Draco bit his lips at that, nodding slowly. Of course, Potter got her by his side. Besides, he's the Saviour of the Wizarding World. He can get anyone he wants.
“Shut up, Zabini! No one asked your opinion!” Ron grumbled while the other man just shrugged casually. “You saw it yourself, Weasley. We've been sitting here for almost twenty minutes and not once did Potter talk or even glance at us.”
"I see," said Harry. "I really need to pay attention to what the Healer and Hermione have been saying to me." Harry rubbed his face, a bit frustrated with his ignorance.
They followed his pointed finger, and watched as Henry was in a deep discussion with his sons, gathering them closer to him. The twins giggled and nodded at everything their Dad said. Henry put his hand on Scorpius’ shoulder, nodding to their direction and the boy immediately leap away and ran straight to Harry’s lap.
It has been going on for almost two weeks now. That bizarre things Potter did like starting to kiss Draco in his cheek every time they parted their ways instead of the other way around, compliment him every chance he got, paying attention to him when he talked, or walked him to his class when Granger was absent.
Draco laughed, as he halted on his step and jolted his shoulder on where Harry had put his head on. "This is me."
“Draco!” greeted Potter enthusiastically, somehow looking too relieved as he gave him a million watts smile that makes Draco almost blind with its brightness.
Henry curved a mysterious smile, stepping closer to Malfoy and whispered something to his ear - something private that managed to make Malfoy flustered, red from his face to his ears.
There was a hitched breath, but Harry worked his mouth against Malfoy, sliding an arm around the slim waist whilst his other hand snaked down from his side up to the white-blond hair and took a desperate fist of the soft strands that got Malfoy to gasped and moan at the same time. Harry smirked, and took the opportunity to slid his tongue in Malfoy's hot cavern and met his tongue. He felt their saliva ran down their chins as they fought for dominance, and he hummed in appreciation when Malfoy backed down.
Harry put on a scolding face. "I wouldn't be here, kissing you in front of everyone in the Great Hall if I didn't like you, Draco."
Harry put a hand to his chin, curling his finger as he gently lifted Draco’s head so they could look at each other. “And I can't take my eyes off you.”
He pulled out the spare wand from his back pocket as he tapped his left wrist, couldn't help the snort that escaped when 'sleeping, safe' written under Albus and Scorpius' tattooed name on his wrist. He tapped for the second time, chuckling when he saw where the twins had resided themselves. Knowing his sons, seeing they were actually at the Gryffindor tower, mainly sleeping in his former bed was reassuring enough. He trusted Ron and Hermione to keep their eyes on the twins.
“Can't we just leave that to ‘Mione and Malfoy?” Weasley groaned, and She Weasley immediately whacked his head, “Don't be rude, everyone helps.”
Harry followed Henry's trail with a surge of excitement and a new sudden burst of energy. He doesn't know what kind of help Henry was talking about, but if they were involved with a half naked Malfoy, then why the hell not.
They made their way towards the sloping lawn outside the castle, when Ron suddenly opened his mouth. “Was it got to do with the heart shaped chocolate?”
When Harry had asked why they were given an applause much later when they were wrapped around each other in Draco’s bed, the white-blond haired man snorted and rolled his eyes as he said; "They were thankful that I have restored our house's image by dating you, the bloody Saviour."
Harry smiled at him. "I see you're up and well now." he commented casually, as if he didn't know that the male had just visited his bed last night.
“Alright,” said Potter suddenly, clasping his hands on his knees as he looked at Draco. “I want to know your plan about your blood.”
"Pardon," said Draco, carefully. A little bit hysterical that his son suddenly dropped the Saviour's name into their discussion. "You were saying we need to get help from Harry Potter?"
"Dad's coming!" squeaked Albus all of a sudden that got Scorpius to panic, jumping for the Invisibility Cloak in an instant once he saw it and draped it over himself just in time as their younger dad walked in with a troubled look.
He felt a small hand tightened their grip on him, and looked down to see Scorpius smiling sweetly at him, “Can I sit on your lap, please?"
He already swore that he wanted nothing to do with anything if something ever came up. But somehow, the twins’ sudden appearance managed to make him agitated by throwing him sly looks every time they locked eyes across the room, and don't forget those little smirks they carry; a perfect carbon copy of Draco Malfoy. If he didn't know any better, their mother must be some kind of pureblood; perhaps Pansy Parkinson, seeing those black hair. But he had already voiced out his curiosity to his friends and while Ron had agreed with him, Hermione has smacked their heads with a book, huffing in irritation.
Once they stepped in into the common room however, Harry was blown with amazement when he saw the place was alive. The place were packed with students, chatting amongst themselves as they were working on,
The only feature that separated their looks was the colour of their hair. Whilst they were matching sets of unruly hair, one of the boys had midnight black hair while the other had a white-blond hair.
Harry slowly put the piece of old parchment away, unaware of another two sets of names were making their way towards the Hospital Wing as he rubbed his tired eyes. It can't be, Malfoy can't be the one who has been stealing kisses from him, was he?
Draco scoffed immediately as he stopped on his track, throwing the man a mild irritated look when Potter has stopped and blinked at him in a questioning manner, as if he hadn't just said something offensive.
“I can't believe you really did travel back in time.” Zabini shook his head, curling his lips in amusement.
Merlin, it was embarrassing enough to ask this insufferable git for help, but having those grey eyes lighten up when they landed on him was way beyond mortifying.
"Consider me as a part of the team, then." said Malfoy, crossing his arms as he looked down to Harry. "I'd rather me to be your boyfriend, than Leo. Merlin knows what you'll do to him if I let it happen."
"Come on," said the older man. "Let's not keep Draco wait." he gestured, and took a step forward towards Malfoy.
Harry watched as they fell into a small argument. Zabini, Ron and Ginny choose to be observers while Malfoy already had Albus on his lap, watching the girls with the same unimpressed look on their faces.
Potter gave a soft laugh and nodded, “Stay safe on your way home, Sweetheart. Call me if anything happens.” He said, squeezing Draco’s shoulder in reassurance.
There were scattered torn robes across the floor, and he can see Zabini, Crabbe, Goyle and Nott were occupied with their own fights but that's not what made Harry stop dead on his track because right there on the centre, Draco Malfoy was in a middle of throwing a mean punch to Dixon's face.
Harry chuckled, knowing full well what his little husband was saying. "Ah, was it about your scars?"
He casts a Feather-Light Charm on the baby when his arms start to get stiff, singing softly, mostly to himself when a voice calls his name.
The other twin plucked their hand out of Parkinson's grip as he went to his brother and gave his head a good whack and Albus yelped in pain. “Don't be an imbecile, Albus! If dad hears about this, he'll kill you for sure.”
He let the time pass by; not thinking particularly, just having a moment of his own. It's not everyday that he has the privilege of enjoying a peaceful time like this, so he will take this opportunity to the fullest.
He heard Potter sighed heavily and shook his head in disbelief, “Of course I miss you, I haven't seen you for almost two weeks!”
The twins nodded in a perfect synchronisation that got Draco to screamed mentally seeing the confident look upon their faces, proud that they managed to distribute an excellent idea. Draco doesn't think it was an excellent idea, far from it even but not like he can say it out loud in front of his twins. That would be the same as kicking a crup.
"It was not my fault he went and disappeared." protested Albus, spreading the Map in between them as they work under the Cloak, "Besides, has you seen his face, he was about to murder someone."
Henry chuckled, lifting his hand to pat his head. “I know it's a shock for you but you don't have to be afraid, I'm here.”
A few steps away as they walked, Granger suddenly stopped on her track, and Draco nearly slammed into her. The woman turned to him, knotting her brows as she looked at him with a determined look on her face.
“We're late!” exclaimed Granger, as she continued to pull him making Draco grab his things as fast as he can, sending Potter a look but the man already turned his attention back to Ginevra, not even giving Draco a glance.
Harry watched in alarm as Malfoy smiled fondly to his boys. “That's really good! Now let me handle it, okay?”
The small fist on his collar loosen their grip, conforming Draco that the little wee has totally knocked out, and Draco softly chuckles, amused.
Potter only shook his head at them, entertained. “You'll know if I consider you my love interest, Malfoy." he grinned, and shoved a Treacle Tart inside his mouth. "Until then, I'm good.”
He looked around to see Ron and Zabini already munching down their own food with Parkinson in between them.
The whispering continued, and Harry quickly recognised one as Seamus. He promptly recalled that the Irishman went out just before everyone went to sleep, claiming that he was going to spend his night somewhere in the castle. It didn't make sense to Harry at the time, but now, he understood why.
“Not so bad yourself, Malfoy.” greeted Potter back, giving Draco those boyish smiles of his as he quickly set down the box to open it. Draco grinned despite the dragons swirling inside his stomach. He took an empty seat next to Weasley and placed down his lunch, not forgetting to greet him and Granger too.
As they get closer, Scorpius can help but felt overwhelmed and he knows his brother felt the same too. With a short jump, they tackled their father to the ground.
Draco snapped his fingers at her, appraising her with bright eyes. “Precisely! What a clever woman you are.”
“I can tell that both of you have been sneaking around behind your dad.” said Zabini, giving the twins an approving wink.
"As if," huffed Draco, though he started to scoot closer to Harry. "Well, since you're so desperate for it." he moved to carefully place his head on Harry's chest, tucking his head under his chin and put a hand on top of his stomach. Harry responded by wrapping his arm around his little husband's shoulder, bringing their bodies close together.
“Make sure we got everything first!” said Scorpius frantically, and Albus groaned in irritation. “We've already checked it, thrice! We got everything! We'd better hurry up before dad comes here!”
“Honestly, Al. You're going to kill someone one day.” Scorpius rolled his eyes. “What he meant by that was because papa doesn't even know who our dad is!”
"I mean," drawled Malfoy, waving his younger brother dismissively. "Despite our eyes, we're basically the same person. A perfect copy of each other, because we're
Potter lean to him, eyes dancing with mischief. “But that doesn't stop you from trying. isn't it, Sweetheart?”
Malfoy gasped, face becoming red expeditiously as he immediately pushed Harry upright by slapping his hands on Harry's chest. It made Harry winced, but he didn't let go of Malfoy's waist even as they had already stood up straight. Harry raised his brows when Malfoy tried to step away.
“Because!” Potter waved his hands around, opening his mouth to talk but no words seemed to come out.
"I'm going now, I'll uh, see you around." said Harry and gave a small nod, turning around towards the door when Malfoy called him back. He looked over his shoulder, "Yes?"
Their discussion went well. Harry was really impressed with the way Henry's mind worked; giving input when they had doubts about their plan, guiding them to make sure their plan would be successful.
“I'll pray for that day to come.” replied Draco, winking back at the attractive man in front of him.
Harry promptly paused the chocolate from entering his mouth, and stared at it in horror. “They poisoned it?!”
They have been watching the little family from afar; the man has taken the twins a little further than where they gather to ‘talk' but from where Harry can see, it was more of a scolding.
"That's right," nodded Ron. "Can't walk around as you wish when there were crazy people invading your house."
“Listen, Henry. I don't care if you were his husband or not, you won't be touching Malfoy whatever you want. I won't let you.”
He waved another set of magic towards the pair, another detector for Draco to detect their movement as he turned his attention elsewhere, preferring to let the pair work on the magic by themselves without him watching like a creeper.
“I supposed.” He sniffed, crossing his arms together, as he threw his gaze elsewhere. He heard the older man chuckled, and saw from peripheral vision as Henry stepped closer to him.
He spend his time talking to a man for the past few hours, entertained with the way the human outwardly enthralled by his existence and tried to feel him by spreading his fingers to his thigh, getting higher by the seconds when his detector chimed for the second time that night and he subtly turned to see both Harry and Ginevra was already on their feet, already saying their goodbyes to their companions as they headed for the entrance.
He knows he said the wrong thing when Draco tries to pluck out his hand off Harry’s but he keep on a tight grip. Draco stops once he realise his effort was pointless.
Hermione sharply threw her wild gaze at Harry and frowned, lips pursed together but nodded slowly, “Yes.”
Draco narrowed his eyes at that. He doesn't need to know what kind of books he'd owned in the future, but he definitely knows a guilty face when he sees one.
“Indeed!” said Zabini, already walking and dragging Malfoy with him. “Let's save him before the girls swallows him down.”
“We performed the ritual ourselves!” said Scorpius smugly, lifting his chin upwards that made him look like a tiny Malfoy.
"A bloody detention because of a kiss." said Draco, bringing Harry back to reality and just in time to see him shook his head in disbelief. Harry smiled, tugging the blond's hand through their linked hands to pull him closer.
He curses when his hand reaches for the offensive papers, pushing away his work - not that he can do anything to it when his mind was elsewhere - and starts reading them one by one. By the time he's done, he knows that Potter has been a single man since the last five years, he adopted James since he was still a newborn, he has opened a Defensive Class for two years already, he knows that Potter sometimes went to Hogwarts for the same said class and he also knows that Potter has come out as Bisexual, and there's even one or two articles that showed him in various dates with some witches or wizards.
Draco looked up from his reading to see Scorpius’ curious face. It was the next day, and they were currently at the library occupying one of the tables with books sprawled on top of it. Albus wasn't doing much work, he was only thrilled to be in the Hogwarts' library for the first twenty minutes. By the time Draco laid dozens of books in front of him, he grimaced but took one book just for the sake of taking a part in their current mission. Draco had mentally snorted, amused with his antic, and let him suffer for a good ten minutes before he took a pity for the boy and pulled out a quill and a blank parchment and handed it to him. The great relief washed over his face the moment Draco released him from his suffering was entertaining.
“Truce.” They announced in unison and lifted their own pumpkin juice to clink it together in the middle. Albus and Scorpius laughed as they took a sip of their drink.
The hot breath retreated as fingers reached out his fringe, brushing up his strands of hair to the side and he felt a finger caressing his scar in a soft manner it lulled Harry into a sleep. Harry was almost pulled into the dreamland when a soft voice snatched him back.
Their conversation was cut out by the sudden loud ruckus from the portrait hole and they turned as Seamus and Dean stepped out, talking significantly followed by Neville, who's hand around Ginny’s shoulder, who looked rather pale. They stood in an instant, alarmed, and Ron immediately made a straight line towards his sister.
“Because we're just a distraction so let the brains one do the work and we wait.” A voice said, and Harry looked up to Ginny who was giving him a look, both hands were full with plates of food so Harry quickly took the loads from her and placed it down on the floor.
it was, that look that was served specifically for his younger brother; gone was the smirk, or the teasing tug of his lips, or the mean stare that he kept for everyone as if they were beneath him, or the hard look on his face. It was all gone, and replaced with something that never failed to strum Harry's heartstrings because when Malfoy looked like this, he seemed ethereal.
Draco’s eyes slightly widened hearing the voice. He recognised that voice anywhere. He blinked quickly, gathering his wits as he turned to see Potter watching him warily.
Just earlier, Headmistress McGonagall has quickly brought them to her office after the commotion at the Great Hall. And right now, he suddenly felt light headed with all the information he received.
Potter gave a sigh, but his eyes were soft. “I believe Hermione only sees what she sees. I am comfortable with Ginny out or in our relationship but like I said before, it was a long time ago. In fact, I can consider her as one of my best friends now.”
He decided to put the matters away - it's not that important anyway, and focus on his work. But he knows he's lying to himself when his eyes keep diverted back to the stack of articles.
It was fascinating to learn about magic in all its forms. His mother had explained to him as a child that magic is simply magic, and the only evil surrounding it is those who wield it – with the exception of certain magic which quite literally eats at your soul.
Which was why he was now walking with the two Malfoy’s on their way to the pond. He walked next to Malfoy as Scorpius ran ahead of them, occasionally calling back to them about how incredibly slow they walked.
Harry nodded. “Thank you,” he said, smiling at Draco. “Anyway, how are you? How was your summer?” he asked, as he shook his head. He then grinned at Draco, who couldn’t help but grin back.
“Me neither,” Draco replied, watching the lake, occasionally flickering his eyes towards Harry, who was staring right at Draco.
Draco giggled. He had spent the train journey trying to ignore his excitement but as they pulled into the station, Draco was practically vibrating, a smile plastered on his face; a smile that almost looked painful.
“That’s entirely untrue,” Draco announced, walking to the middle of the room. Harry almost entirely lost his balance and fell to the floor. “I keep you around for your name, it’s very good for business,” he drawled, smirking as Harry rolled his eyes.
He returned to the first book he came across, pulling it from the shelf and curling up on one of the sofas.
“I overheard some sixth-years in the Hufflepuff common room talking about it,” Teddy said. “It seems weirdly complicated,” he said, scrunching up his nose.
Draco tilted his head towards Harry and prodded his shoulder. “Oi! Don’t fall asleep on me Potter, I have to go to at least one lesson today.”
When Malfoy joined them again, his face was a deep crimson. Harry tilted his head, opening his mouth only to be interrupted by Malfoy. “No,” he said, pointing a finger at Harry, who raised his hands.
As the rest of the group started to argue – Harry hoped Hermione and Ron would be able to explain Draco’s arrival – Harry and Draco continued their own conversation. “Are you sure that what you saw was real? What if this is the plan I overheard? Then –“ Draco paused, and Harry saw the cogs turn in his brain. “How do we know it’s real?” he asked, his eyes searching Harry’s.
Had Draco been looking at the adults in the room, he would have noticed the curious glances between them as Harry practically ran to Draco and hugged the boy tightly, without a single word, but Draco’s focus was solely on Harry, as he buried his face in Draco’s neck. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry, suddenly realised how much he had missed Harry. “Miss me?” Draco teased, biting back a laugh as Harry nodded, tightening his grip on Draco.
“Which is why I agree with you, he should talk to you,” Draco nodded. “To figure out where you personally stand on the matter.”
“You never know,” Harry sniggered. “Maybe she’ll talk about the wonderfulness of Muggle toothbrushes.”
“He’ll be alone at some point. See if you can get him to elaborate his warning – if he heard anything else.” Sirius’ eyebrows furrowed, and it looked as if he was debating telling Harry something. “Have I ever told you about my brother?” he asked.
Harry chuckled and rolled his eyes. Of course, Malfoy hadn’t listened. “I forgave you a long time ago Malfoy,” he said, glancing up at Malfoy whose ears went pink as he nodded. “Why do you work in a teashop?” Harry asked, unable to contain his curiosity. He hoped he wasn’t pissing Malfoy off, but when he looked at Malfoy’s expression, he seemed to be completely unbothered.
He could just about make out the confused whispers of everybody in the Great Hall over his own muddled thoughts.
“Anytime Teddy Bear,” Harry smiled, feeling relieved when Teddy smiled back, even though his eyes were a little red. “Would you like a hot chocolate?” he asked, and Teddy nodded, still sniffling a little.
Once he was pre-occupied with the cupcake cases, Draco turned to look at Harry. “I know what you’re doing Potter,” he muttered, suppressing a smile.
Draco nodded, the smirk widening into a smile. “He really tried not to tell me, but he was so excited,” he chuckled, and Harry couldn’t help but join in. “I’ve always wanted to go here,” Draco added. “It’s supposedly got everything,” he said, scanning his eyes over the building. It was an old Victorian building with ornate engravings on the stone and the brick. Harry had heard Hermione gush over the shop before, enthusing about its incredible collection.
Harry couldn’t figure out how Scorpius could remember so much about dragons. When he was eight, Harry could have never sat and read a book. ‘Maybe that’s because Dudley’s gang wouldn’t let me,’ he thought, sighing internally.
When Andromeda opened the door, Draco saw a man he did not expect to see. “Professor Lupin?” he asked, furrowing his eyebrows. It was a reasonable response to seeing Remus Lupin, as anyone would be a little confused to see someone who used to be their teacher, in their aunt’s kitchen.
,” Draco said, noticeably dishevelled, as if he ran here. “When you fell to the floor I – I wanted to leave but she wouldn’t allow it, not after Weasley and Granger. Are you all right, what happened?” he asked, one hand on Harry’s shoulder as the other brushed Harry’s hair from his eyes, resting on Harry’s cheek.
“Yes, yes,” he scowled, waving a hand dismissively. “I used the potion as an excuse to have a moment of virtue, but I swear to Salazar Potter, if you tell a single soul –“
Startling awake, Draco noticed there was now a blanket draped over him, and a pillow under his head. Before he could question where the blanket had come from, and where Harry was, he heard a voice from the window seat. “Morning,” Harry said, offering Draco a smile.
Harry found himself smiling. “Probably not,” he chuckled. “I’m surprised you haven’t accused me of ‘
“He’s decided to test your baking ability,” Draco explained, the corner of his mouth twitching upward.
“No one agreed with him going that far Harry,” Draco said, sitting to look at Harry. “Taunting people is one thing, but to bring up, what he did –“
“My nephew, Draco, how long have you been visiting his shop?” she asked again, grinning as Harry felt himself blush.
Even though Harry had said he didn’t mind returning to the Dursley’s, he felt his stomach drop when they confirmed that he had no choice but to return. “It’s really not that bad, you don’t –“
“A few months,” he muttered, unable to look Andromeda in the eye. “I didn’t know you were in contact with him,” Harry said, certain Draco had mentioned that they
The two boys would sneak glances at each other when the other wasn’t looking, looking away before either of them realised what was happening.
Sipping his tea, he wondered what his mother was doing right now with Scorpius. He had decided that whilst he was revising, it would be best if Scorpius spent the time with Narcissa during the day. Scorpius had told him all about how yesterday she let him hover around on a broom (much to Draco’s disapproval) and how he had helped her in the garden. He hoped that if he passed these exams, he’d be able to spend more time with Scorpius as he spent too much of his time studying.
Splashing water on his face to cool him down, he then continued on his way to the kitchen. Only this time he found himself staring at a door which was slightly ajar.
The silence emanating from the house, almost made Harry want to scream, just to fill the emptiness. In the first few years after the war, the house was never truly quiet. Ginny would be sat in the living room with Teddy when she wasn’t practising Quidditch or playing a match. Their laughter would echo off the walls and Harry would be able to hear it wherever he was in the house.
“But you didn’t have to tell me anything, so thanks for the heads up,” Harry said, offering a small smile to Malfoy who looked back at Harry as if he’d just suggested they try to grow wings.
Lupin rubbed the back of his neck. “I can’t say for sure, perhaps to feed into the crazed idea they want the media to have of him?” he offered, apprehensively. Draco couldn’t tell if it was due to a lack of confidence in the idea, or because of the presence of Harry.
“I hid them well Professor,” Draco replied, his ear turning pink as Harry and Sirius exchanged a bemused glance.
“My father doesn’t know we’re friends,” Draco grinned, and Blaise laughed, shaking his head. “And he isn’t a Muggleborn,” he said. He knew for a fact Harry Potter was not a Muggleborn – everyone did.
“ a voice suddenly screamed, forcing Draco to cover his ears. Andromeda followed suit, but Sirius looked tired.
, please call me Sirius, we’re cousins after all,” he shivered, outstretching a hand to Draco who gingerly accepted the hand. Harry fought off another eye roll.
Harry laughed, not removing his eyes from the horizon as Draco sat next to him. “Wouldn’t want you messing up your hair,” he teased.
Blaise scrunched up his nose. “You’re so nice sometimes,” he sighed, slinging an arm around Draco’s shoulders, making him jump. “And such a Hufflepuff,” he grinned, making Pansy cackle.
“I figured that if you ever quit your job as an Auror, you’d want to spend more time with Teddy,” she grinned. “Honestly Harry, I’ve been telling you for years he wants to live with you, his Dad,” Andromeda said, exasperated.
“Harry?” Draco said, standing up straight as Harry waved at him, entering the shop. It was still early in the day, and the shop was yet to fill with any customers; the only people in the shop were Draco and Scorpius, who was talking to Ladon. “Is everything, all right? You work on Saturdays,” he asked, his eyebrows furrowed.
is, you don’t have to apologise for him just because he’s in your house,” Harry said, offering a smile which Draco returned.
Harry chuckled before he too pondered the idea of waiting for the cakes to be iced. “I don’t think I can wait, can you?” he grinned, watching as Scorpius grinned at him too.
“I know you said he’s different to his father, but,” Sirius whispered to Harry who smiled. “He is nothing like his father,” Sirius chuckled, shaking his head.
’ before he died,” he explained, still holding Harry’s hand. “I could never love her the way I was expected to, and she knew that. Instead, she became my best friend,” he said, smiling weakly at Harry. “She helped me to see the reasons to continue existing, all the reasons why I deserve to be happy. She was the one who came up with the idea of starting a teashop you know.” Draco shivered; his eyes glazed over.
True to his word, Harry really did visit more. He visited every Wednesday as that was his day off, and on Saturday evenings. Harry was happy he had stayed true to his word and felt immense joy at watching Teddy grow. Andromeda would send him knowing smiles and glances whenever he interacted with Teddy, as Harry always left his weekly meetups with a brighter smile than when he arrived.
Teddy thought about the offer and nodded. “Okay,” he said, his voice muffled as he covered his mouth to stifle a yawn. “But I’m not tired,” he repeated, making Harry smile.
Draco, after a moment of hesitation, shook Sirius’ hand. “Not if you’re going to hug me,” he replied, making Sirius laugh.
Lupin rolled his eyes, patting Sirius on the top of the head. “To be fair Andie, at least he didn’t try to
Brushing the soil off of his robes, Harry stood up and adjusted his glasses, noticing Draco had already cast a
With a wide grin, Harry linked his finger’s with Draco’s, who hadn’t noticed they were holding hands yet. “I did,” he replied. “I’ve been finding excuses for years, but I’m
Quickly clasping at the other boy’s hand, Draco shook his momentary shock and grinned widely at Harry. “Pleasure to meet you Harry, for a second time,” he joked. He was glad to see Harry’s shoulders drop and the smile return to his face.
“I need some air,” Harry said, picking up his bags, he hadn’t had a chance to put them in the Boy’s Dormitory yet, and he didn’t want to leave them there.
“I’ve tried!” Harry groaned. “He’s always surrounded by other Slytherins and he’s never alone,” he said, remembering all the times he’d searched for him in the corridors and on the Marauder’s Map.
“Are you all right dear?  That was quite a noise you made, and you look very pale,” the invigilator asked, a frown pulling onto her face as Harry’s eyes darted around the room. Harry realised he was on the floor.
Draco shrugged. “Not that directly but Andromeda is my Aunt which makes him my second cousin? I’m not too sure.”
Until Malfoy cracked. “I thought the kiss would have made my reasons quite obvious Potter,” he sniffed, his face a light pink.
However, it happened again, and again, and again, until Pansy was tired of hearing Draco pretend it wasn’t happening, “OK that’s it, Draco
Grinning, the blond forgot to focus on the small coin, and it flew past Harry’s ear, missing him by a sliver. Scorpius cringed. “Sorry Harry,” he apologised.
It took Draco a moment to process what Harry had said, but when he did, his face turned a light shade of pink. “Oh,” he whispered, smiling at Harry. “Ok.”
“You’re still an arsehole Harry,” Malfoy smiled, shaking his head. “And if I have to call you Harry, you’re going to suffer too.”
“Who else will I learn the complexities of tea from?” Harry shrugged, trying his best to look nonchalant.
With a small smile, Draco shook his head. “Such a man of words,” he joked, trying to lighten the mood a little. When Harry smiled at the comment, Draco sighed with relief. “Where to next?” he asked, and Harry relaxed his shoulders, looking relieved Draco didn’t push.
“O’course not you prat,” Harry said, a smile pulling at the corners of his mouth once more. “It’s just unusual when I come across people who don’t seem to have any idea who I am,” he admitted.
I have, haven’t I?” Malfoy said, with a small smile towards his son, who was talking to the ducks about the proper etiquette surrounding teacups. He sighed. “It would be better for him than being in Slytherin,” he said.
He bumped his shoulder to Harry’s, grabbing the boy’s attention. He raised an eyebrow at Harry who sighed, shaking his head a little.
And if I’m honest, I didn’t tell you because I didn’t know if he was genuine but,” he couldn’t help the smile that crept onto his face.
“Harry!” Scorpius exclaimed as he opened the door. “You’re here!” He grabbed Harry’s hand and dragged him inside.
When they approached the gate that lead into Hogsmeade and Remus came into view, Harry’s grip on Draco’s hand tightened.
A part of Harry hated to admit it, but Draco was extremely handsome. His hair was styled almost exactly as it had been at Hogwarts, but with a lot less hair gel and it was the colour of the
Harry sighed, knowing that Snape would find some way to fail his potion, no matter what it looked like, even if he followed the directions exactly.
“Headache – stress,” Harry said, bouncing his hand on his leg as he stood up. He needed to go, right now.
“The only other person I’ve met who could feel residual magic was Regulus,” Sirius reminisced, smiling to himself. “My brother,” he clarified. “He would always mention if something felt wrong; sometimes the feeling would make him a little giddy.”
With a quick explanation to Scorpius, Harry headed to the counter, picked up an apron that was hanging from the wall, and quickly picked up a tray before Draco could.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “I swear he got his obsession with creatures from Luna,” he muttered with a smile.
He noticed that everyone, including the Slytherins, was staring at him in a mixture of shock and concern. Ron was standing, as if he were ready to pounce, prepared to fight, and prepared to drag Harry out of the classroom if he needed to. Hermione’s eyes were darting between Harry and the door, as if she were calculating the risks of grabbing him and running out of the door.
Harry opened his mouth to explain, as best he could, the best way to drink sencha, but the other woman beat him to it. “Don’t worry about explaining it to us dear, Draco’s explained it to us many times,” she chuckled, and Harry couldn’t help joining in.
Shaking his head, Lupin cast his eyes to the floor. “It isn’t pleasant, to say the least,” he sighed, and Andromeda placed her hand over his.
Harry chuckled as they entered the corridor and waved enthusiastically as they went their separate ways – Draco brought a hand to his face to hide his blush.
Andromeda laughed at his impression. “That was a little bit of it, I suppose,” she said, collecting herself. “He also mentioned how much he admires you, the way you handle Scorpius with such care and support, how you’ve never once asked questions you know would make him uncomfortable, despite the burning need to know,” she said, her eyes never leaving Harry.
Harry felt his stomach drop. “I’m sorry, you’ve probably missed all of first lesson because of me,” he said, shame washing over him as he spoke.
Draco nodded, before having a moment of his own realisation. “I haven’t called him that around you, have I?” he asked with his eyebrows raised, a small smile on his lips.
“Knowledge, and not your opinion?” Harry asked, trying his best to suppress a laugh as Draco went from pink to red.
Another thing that he had discovered was that he really had learnt a lot about tea from Draco. He was no expert, that was a title still earned only by Draco himself, but he knew more than the average person. It might have been because he couldn’t help but remember every conversation he had ever had with Draco, but he liked to think it was because he had an excellent memory – despite forgetting where he placed his wand on a number of occasions.
“It is,” she answered. “Tell Draco we hope he keeps you,” she said, and Harry couldn’t help but laugh.
The Burrow was practically bursting at the seams, as it always appeared to be on Sundays. As soon as Harry had entered, Molly had practically forced him into the living room and in-between Hermione and Ron, who just shrugged when Harry glanced at them as Molly told him to take it easy.
“All right Potter,” Draco grinned, squeezing Harry’s hands with his own. “I’ll allow you to be graced by my presence on a date,” he drawled, grinning when Harry rolled his eyes at his theatrics. “I expect chocolates.”
which removed the dirt from their clothes and Harry’s hair when they emerged from the tunnel– Draco’s hair was
, visiting on Wednesdays and Thursdays, trying every tea that Malfoy placed in front of him, although it was all fairly basic (mostly different white, black and fruit teas), and despite the occasional awkwardness, he was starting to consider Malfoy a friend, rather than an acquaintance, but perhaps that was just because he made fantastic tea.
,” he muttered. “He’s never going to let me live this down,” he complained, making the other three chuckle.
“I know I’m handsome but do show some decorum Harry,” he teased, before once again, wandering further into the shop. Harry was beginning to wonder just how big this shop truly was.
Scorpius shook his head. “No, not really,” he said, absentmindedly, bouncing Ladon across the table. “Oh!” he exclaimed, dropping Ladon on the table. “We visited Auntie An-drom-e-da,” he said slowly, to make sure he pronounced it correctly. “She’s nice, she gives me biscuits,” he nodded, as if that was all that was needed to determine someone’s intentions.
He was lucky he didn’t wake Walburga’s portrait, as he flew down the stairs, almost slipping and gripping the bannister tight for balance.
“Merlin, it’s bloody cold,” Ron complained as the trio made their way into the dungeon to the Potions classroom. “I’m glad we only have Potions down here,” he said, rubbing his hands together to keep warm.
“Anytime Draco,” Harry smiled. “Besides,” he said, picking up the teapot. “I can see why you love this teashop so much,” he shrugged, leaving Draco with an amused, but perplexed look on his face.
Harry decided he needed to get out of bed if he didn’t want to be late, again. Traipsing around his bedroom, Harry got dressed into his Auror robes and brushed his teeth, hoping for a peaceful day.
“It’s a Muggle sport,” Draco said. “I think,” he added, looking toward Harry who nodded with a small smile to tell him he was right. “Then there’s the beaters who use bats to hit about the bludger, making sure it doesn’t knock anyone on
have to point out that you’re wrong,” Andromeda challenged, raising an eyebrow. “I’d say the two of you are rather moonstruck with each other.”
“I can wait,” Harry said, smiling. “By the way, do you want to know what your new wand symbolises?” he asked, and Draco nodded, although apprehensively.
“Mate, how is this going to be helpful?” Ron asked, as Harry began to throw things out of his trunk.
“Harry!” Scorpius exclaimed, pushing past Draco to tackle Harry in a hug, though he was only small, so it wasn’t much of a tackle.
“Tell me that doesn’t look like a dragon on a broomstick,” Blaise challenged, making Draco burst into a fit of giggles, turning his head to look at Pansy who appeared to be using every bit of self-restraint not to throttle him, or at the very least, scream.
Scorpius offered Teddy a toothy grin, bouncing about. “My name is Scorpius,” he said. “Have you ever met a dragon?” he asked, his tone serious.
Harry laughed. “Because there’s never anything left,” he said. Between his own sweet tooth and Draco’s, and Scorpius’, they were lucky if there were any crumbs left.
“You don’t Harry, but perhaps that’s why you’re so charming,” Draco said, placing a hand on Harry’s cheek. Harry couldn’t help but lean into the touch.
Harry glanced at Teddy and Scorpius, who were laughing, and Teddy looked as if he was in the middle of re-telling an exciting story. He glanced up at Draco. “You mean a lot to me too.”
Tilting his head, Draco wondered what that had to do with anything. However, he didn’t have to wonder for very long, as there was a light knock at the backdoor.
“Merlin Potter.” It was Malfoy, which only increased his unstable emotional state. “Right, well I don’t have a death wish,” he muttered, pulling the door to as he hopefully, turned to leave. Harry couldn’t tell for sure, as he was facing in the opposite direction.
“Not to everyone Potter,” he said, his voice devoid of emotion. “It’s all right I suppose. Everyone will have their opinions on what I did.” As he spoke, he forced a smile to Scorpius who waved his arm vigorously, grinning from ear to ear.
Draco shook his head, taking a deep breath. “Nothing,” he said, smiling a smile that he knew didn’t reach his eyes. “It was nice to see you Harry,” he smiled, waving as he left the bathroom.
knows what they thought they’d achieve,” he said, and Draco agreed. He couldn’t imagine that the Wizengamot were thrilled about the change, just as much as he knew Harry wasn’t.
Pansy retaliated in a similar fashion, raising an eyebrow. “How, in the name of Merlin, is that a pawprint?” she asked, failing to contain her exasperation. As Draco opened his mouth to reply, she cut him off. “Actually, sod it, I don’t care, it’s a rabbit.”
That is, until Teddy had been sent a letter. Andromeda had insisted afterwards that they keep their regular meetings, completely unrelated to Harry’s emotional state, supposedly – though Harry knew that wasn’t the case.
Draco stared at the pieces of red paper, trying to process the words of his father, when he heard a snapping behind him.
He was trying to ignore it, but it wouldn’t let him; it was knocking on the door of his mind like an unwanted guest to a party. It clawed at the underside of his skin and it scratched at his eyes.
“Just boring regular tea I’m afraid, the rest is all downstairs,” he called over his shoulder, pulling the jar from the shelf.
Harry shrugged. “A few nightmares,” he shrugged, and Draco nodded, as the dog rested its head on the bed. Harry smiled at the dog, rubbing its head. “
“Oh, don’t worry about it, it’s an exchange,” said Harry, as if taking any money would be counted as stealing.
“You’ll scare the ducks – they’re just there, look,” he said, pointing to the far edge of the pond, where a small gathering of ducks quickly jumped into the water as they saw Scorpius, swimming toward him. “They like me,” Scorpius explained, giggling at the bemused expression on Harry’s face as he ran to meet the ducks.
“The special ones from the silver tin?” Harry asked, trying to ignore the smile that tugged at his face as Scorpius’ eyes went wide.
He watched as Malfoy’s face displayed every emotion Harry could think of. “I mean – I wouldn’t say you
Scorpius nodded enthusiastically as they approached Harry’s shop. “Yep, Nana let me read some books on them,” he said proudly.
,” she began. “The presence of other people is helping,” she said, although Draco noted that she didn’t seem to believe what she was saying.
, it’s all fucked isn’t it. This is really happening,” Draco breathed, shivering slightly as he watched a bird fly by.
Nodding, Draco rubbed the back of his neck. “I went from being surrounded by the idea of war – death – and then to trying to figure out how Muggle money works,” he shrugged, laughing nervously. “
The next few hours were spent wandering the park, listening to Scorpius explain each duck’s backstory and Malfoy tried not to laugh at Harry, who looked as if someone was explaining Muggle astrophysics to him; his eyes widened as he began to lose his understanding of the conversation. Harry couldn’t remember how many secret glares he had shot towards Malfoy, but his expression instantly disintegrated as he saw Malfoy’s blue hair fall over his eyes as he tried to contain his laughter.
“I can always take it back,” Harry said. Draco shrugged, smirking at Harry who rolled his eyes and continued. “
“Your obsession with Harry’s love life is concerning,” George joked. “But are you?” he asked, making Harry laugh.
But, no matter how much he tried to will it into fruition, sleep did not cure whatever was happening. Just after a week, Pansy tried to insist that he go to a wand maker, any wand maker but Draco refused – “It’s got nothing to do with my wand Pansy, it will pass.”
“I think you’ve said before,” Harry said, passing over a couple of twenty-pound notes to the lady, who was trying her best to supress a laugh. “And for the record, I’m not the only git in this relationship,” he said, thanking the cashier as she handed him the bag of books and they left the shop.
“It’s nice to know my efforts are appreciated,” Draco grinned, taking the whisk from Scorpius. “I’ll take it from here mon cœur, why don’t you go and put the cupcake cases in the tray.”
Shaking his head, Harry quickly caught up to Draco. “I have plenty of decorum-ness,” he scowled, watching as Draco sighed with a smile.
Harry sighed, shifting his position to look back at Draco. “It’s OK,” he muttered, and Draco looked at Harry as if he’d gone mad. “Well, it’s not at all OK and I still want to hex him for it,” he said, and Draco chuckled. “But what I
Draco furrowed his eyebrows. “Of course I did, why wouldn’t I?” he asked, watching Harry hug his knees to his chest, shrugging. “Did you find the platform okay?”
“Dad charmed him,” Scorpius explained, still watching the dragon as he perched on a shelf before taking off again.
Potter stared at Draco, in curiosity or disgust, he couldn’t tell, but he tried not to blush as he felt the raven-haired man bore holes in the side of his skull with his eyes.
Harry felt a smile tug at his lips, relief flooding his body when he knew Draco wouldn’t push him for answers. “
“I forget sometimes,” Blaise said, as the ghosts stopped to talk to some students. “That people haven’t grown up with magic, it seems like such an odd way to grow up,” he shuddered, and Draco couldn’t help but agree.
Instead, he lent forward and slightly kissed the end of Draco's nose, then proceeding to tackle the blond to the floor in a hug.
“I’ve been meaning to go to Hogsmeade for a while now,” Remus added, his eyes flickering to Sirius. “Been putting it off actually. Order business.”
The group half ran, half quick walked to the Gryffindor Tower, and the Portrait Lady reluctantly let Draco and Luna inside. Thankfully, the Common Room was empty and the eight of them clambered up the stairs to the Boy’s Dormitory.
“You don’t speak to us anymore Harry,” Hermione said bluntly. “You sneak off every chance you get to
“You know” Harry laughed, running his fingers through his hair, the laughter becoming more and more strained. “I think I needed to do that too,” he said.
“14, almost 15,” Sirius replied, his sorrow turning into anger. “I was pissed, obviously, but Reggie told me he’d figure it out, like he always did,” Sirius’ face went blank. “I believed him, I thought he’d figure it out but, he didn’t,” Sirius trailed off, but Harry knew what that meant.
“Then there’s Hufflepuff,” Draco continued. “Their house colours are yellow and black, and they’re known for valuing patience, hard-work, loyalty but also for being the house that accept anyone,” he said, watching the boy as he looked fascinated by what Draco was saying. “Then, there’s Slytherin,” Draco said, with a sigh. “It’s probably where I’ll go – my whole family has been in this house for generations – anyway, they wear green and silver and they value ambition, resourcefulness and cunning.”
Harry, be careful,” he said, shaking his head. “How you survived this long without me I’ll never know,” he muttered, and Harry rolled his eyes.
“Couple of troublemakers if you ask me,” Ron grinned, tickling the two of them. Hermione watched the scene, smiling as if she could watch her family laugh until the last star in the universe exploded.
As per usual, the two spent the day talking, with Draco disappearing periodically to check on his customers and deal with those who had just walked in. Harry got lost in the moment, forgetting the time entirely until he glanced up and saw it was almost pitch-black outside. This was becoming an incredibly common occurrence; it was difficult for Harry to focus on anything other than the slight features of Draco’s face and the grace with which he moved, even when he was darting from customer to customer.
“I know what dinner is you prat, I just meant,” he paused. “Are you asking me on a date?” he asked, partially wanting to tease him but also curious at to if he had misread the conversation.
to live with my Aunt, I might need someone to explain Muggle items to me,” he joked, and Harry threw back his head with a small chuckle, watching the sky.
“I’d love to say you’re wrong, but I don’t think you are,” Draco said, a small smile pulling at the corner of his lips – not that Harry was staring at his lips. “Ah ha!’ he exclaimed, pulling a small book of the shelf.
, which meant he had to uphold the traditions.” Harry wondered why he was talking to him about this. “But he didn’t want to,” Sirius grinned.
“Will do,” Draco smiled. He examined Harry’s face, and felt a weird sensation at the realisation that Harry’s facial features had changed, but also, hadn’t. Draco knew that his own features had become sharper, ‘
“When I call your name, come up to the front and sit on the stool,” McGonagall explained, lifting up the hat. “Abbott, Hannah,” she called out.
The rest of their supermarket trip was filled with Harry relaying what he could remember about the Marauders pranks. He told Teddy about the least problematic ones (as he didn’t think a Muggle supermarket was the best place to explain why there was such a heavy prejudice against Slytherin in the 70s), which included ones where Remus and James charmed the portraits to sing David Bowie songs on repeat and where Sirius decided it would be fantastic to charm James’ shampoo to dye his hair bright pink, leading to the following Marauder’s prank war of 1976.
Harry didn’t notice he was staring until Malfoy coughed, catching his attention. Malfoy’s cheeks were tinged pink. They sat in awkward silence for a few minutes, Harry shifting his weight from foot to foot as Malfoy became very interested in examining the walls. Harry was bewildered by the situation. He was in a classroom, with Malfoy, after drinking a potion that made him incapable of thinking things through, and made his magic just as reckless… The fact that they’d managed to have a half-decent conversation without threatening each other as well – the whole ordeal was bizarre.
They wandered through the back of the shop with Draco occasionally pausing to pick a book off the shelf and read the blurb. It was one of the few times Harry had seen Draco look entirely relaxed and care-free, unbothered by the world.
“She’s got a point mate,” Ron said apprehensively. “It’s been about seven years and you’ve not been on a date or anything.”
“Ted taught me a few games,” Draco shrugged, grinning. “I bet I can beat you at go-fish,” he challenged, glancing at Harry who chuckled.
“Hello,” he greeted cheerfully. “Hogwarts too?” Draco asked, and when he got no response, he turned his head to see the other boy nod his head slowly. Draco tilted his head at the quiet response. He tried to think of what he could talk about. “Do you know what Hogwarts house you’ll be in?”
. He was wearing a white button-up shirt with the sleeves rolled to his elbows, his dark mark on display. However, it was surrounded by a flower Harry couldn’t name, and the flowers circled the mark, as if trying to replace it or suffocate it. Harry assumed that was the point. Malfoy looked healthy, not anything like the sickly pale boy he had seen during the trials. If it had been anyone other than Malfoy, Harry would have smiled.
“You brought this upon yourself Blaise, I don’t know what to tell you,” she smirked as Blaise rolled his eyes.
Harry pushed the remaining toast across the table, noticing that Draco had still only taken one small bite of his first slice. “The world is changing all around us. Your mother isn’t stupid, she knows that things she values aren’t as relevant as they used to be.”
Draco’s eyes lowered from his own and his brow furrowed, slowly giving way to anger, a small part of Harry revelled in the sight of it. “Why did you save me?”
“What?” Harry asked in a panic, fully aware of how he must look, hoping beyond hope that Draco wouldn’t mention it.
Harry tipped over the edge at that thought, coming harder than he thought he ever had before flopping back onto the bed.
Harry only smiled as he picked up the cups from the table, flicking his wand at the kettle as he went. “You’ll get used to it.”
“Well, the death toll stacked up pretty fast the last few years. I guess I feel… responsible. Voldemort’s end-game was killing
Ron’s face was as red as his hair, practically steaming with anger. “And why does that person always have to be you?”
In spite of the low light, the brilliant red that covered Harry’s face was unmistakable. “I wasn’t expecting company!”
Harry rose his hand, stopping Draco mid-sentence. “No, don’t be sorry. It’s… it’s not ok, but they… they fought for what they believed in and I’m proud of them for that.”
Draco was aghast at the mere thought of such a thing. “Well, no, of course she won’t do that. I just… I never wanted to be a disappointment to her, and now I think I might be.”
Draco lowered his head, and the tone of his voice dropped with it. “I didn’t have anything outside my home. My mother and father were all I’d ever known,” his breath stuttered a little, and for a moment, Harry was terrified that Draco might start to cry. “I didn’t think I would ever have something like this. If that was all I was ever going to have, then I had to protect it.”
A thunderous knock at the front door shook Harry from a trance he hadn’t fully realised he was in, though it wasn’t unusual for him to disappear inside his head these days. The war had been long and cost too much and it was impossible to chase it from his thoughts. He supposed it was the same for everyone, no one had walked away from the carnage unscathed. He entertained the thought from time to time, that the survivors may in fact be the unlucky ones.
More and more he wondered about the actual worth of having pure blood. As far as he could tell, it didn’t make him any more skilled or powerful than any other wizard, it only gave people the liberty to be mean, due mostly to their tendency to be miserable and (certainly in his case at least) jealous. The freedoms awarded to those who had no need to worry about tarnishing their family name were something that Draco had long desired, but made no effort of acquire. Until now.
Harry shrugged. “I was only close with Ron and Hermione. Ron is with his family and Hermione back at school, guess it's a little hard to trust people these days.”
Harry couldn’t help the defensive stance he took as he responded. “For one, he never actually made any attempt at murdering me. For two, this is why I didn’t tell you, I knew you wouldn’t get it!” He sighed heavily, habitually flicking his wand at the kettle. “He’s not the way you think he is, you know. Not the way any of us thought he was when we were at school.”
Draco didn’t respond to this, he didn’t even look up. “I made you tea,” he said eventually, indicating the cup on the other side of the table.
“I’ll wager that’s all she cares about. As long as you love her, she will always turn a blind eye to the way you want to live your life.”
“I get that. I would have given anything to have had my parents around to tell me what to do,” Harry responded, his eyes drifting to the picture on the table beside him, where a young James and Lily danced in endless circles, smiling and laughing in one another’s arms, eternally oblivious to the fate that awaited them.
“No, I'll stop in somewhere on the way back,” he said quietly, seeing again that flicker of something on his mother’s features, irritated by the fact that she was able to tuck her emotions away so efficiently. Perhaps she was angry at him for going out so often. “But if you’d rather I came home then I will make sure I’m back in time.”
“I don’t know about that,” Draco said softly, looking up again and Harry studied the silvery grey eyes that stared back at him. “You were famous, smart, you had friends.”
When he and Ron had made the decision not to return to school, it seemed like the right choice. There didn’t seem to be anything on paper or in the minds of their teachers that could make them more than what they had become, and the last thing he wanted was for people to be hailing him as a hero every minute of the day: but was the reclusive life he had chosen really any better?
He couldn’t explain the nervous energy that was buzzing through him when he woke. All he knew was that something about the fifteen minutes he had spent in Draco’s company had made him feel. He couldn’t pinpoint the emotion exactly, but it was akin to seeing the shoreline after months drifting hopelessly out at sea.
. But sometimes I wish…” he trailed off, a little ashamed of the words in his head, but Draco spoke them aloud as if reading them on his face.
“It wasn’t your fault you know,” Draco said softly, pulling Harry from his negative spiral. “Everyone was just trying to find a way to put a stop to their own suffering. They were fighting for themselves and what they believed in. Ultimately, they wanted to defend you, and everything you stood for, because it’s what they believed themselves.”
Harry flailed his hands wildly in front of him in a moment of pure panic. “No, no, nothing like that!” he said quickly. “Ron was supposed to come by yesterday but he had to cancel at the last minute, I just didn’t put everything away before I went to bed,” he finished weakly, finally dropping into the chair across from Draco. “But I’m glad you’re here.”
Harry wasn’t sure what to say. He had never seen Draco get flustered like this, and certainly never heard him say ‘uh’. Draco had two speeds: talking and not talking, never anything as slow and unsure as the quite obvious lie he had just uttered.
Harry had spent more than enough time being schooled by Hermione on the emotions of others, and while the child in him enjoyed Draco’s discomfort, the war-weary adult he had become saw no point in drawing things out. “Well, I may be wrong in everything that I’m about to say, but let me take a shot at it,” Harry began, wrapping his hands around his own mug, comforted by the warmth that spread through his chilled fingertips. “I don’t think you were ever fully committed to Voldemort. That much seemed the clear to me that day at the Manor when you claimed you didn’t know for sure it was me the snatchers had brought in.”
"I'm sorry," said Malfoy, after he calmed down and Harry just had to roll his eyes because his tone clearly indicated that he was not sorry at all; in fact, the white-blond haired git's eyes were dancing with mirth. "I think I've misheard, you want me to be- what?"
At the sight, Ginny finally allowed herself to smile fondly. "I will take care of him with my life, Harry."
"Yes, well." said Malfoy, sounding slightly hysterical. "There was nothing Madam Promfey couldn't fix."
Draco felt the air sucked out of his lungs as soon as he took a look. It was a photo; he was in it. It was definitely him and he looked much older but happier. Both Albus and Scorpius wrapped tightly in his arms, giggling as he pressed kisses onto their faces.
Draco chuckled, wiping away the tears that were already running down his face. How pathetic it is to cry in front of children.
“Show me.” Harry says as he pushes his chair and stood up, pressing his lips together in a thin line. He moves to walk towards awaiting Neville in a calm demeanor he can display, but quickened the movement of his feet. He hears several chairs move, and hurried steps following his trail. He ignores them as he focused to stay calm, hoping that the fight won't turn so badly.
He was just laying underneath a cherry tree where he usually went, for it was a bit further from the castle as well as it was hidden from the view of other students. He took his usual spot, putting his hands behind the back of his head as a pillow and not a moment later, he drifted off to sleep.
Draco wasn't sure what to feel about that too. “Why are we talking about my virginity all of a sudden?”
He frowned at the foreign feelings creeping through his chest, has been from the moment he had heard about the whole situation, and quickened his pace when he remembered that the sole reason why he was out of his bed freezing his arse off was the only current resident of the Hospital Wing.
"You're impossible." said Draco as he shook his head. He brought his eyes to gaze on Harry's face, and Harry raised an eyebrow at that.
Draco nodded vigorously. “Exactly! And the patient is my middle name, Weasley. Unless Potter got himself falling in love with someone, I won't give up.” He stated firmly.
Now, Harry can't help but worries. Going for Dixon is like going for a suicide. No one had the balls to go up against Dixon, as he was vile, vicious and violent - Ron called him the Three Vs - and he's not hesitate to use heavy curses on the students. Merlin knows how many students he has sent to the hospital wing. Not even a warning from Harry's own mouth manage to stop him.
The arrow was about to hit its target when he caught a devilish smirk upon Harry's face, and it was the only warning he received before Harry effortlessly plucked the arrow mid-air, inches away from his face and turned to lock his eyes with Draco.
"You know what, never mind that." Henry pursed his lips as he frowned at Harry. As if it was Harry's fault that he was talking like a mad man. "I'll let you help, okay? You won't stop otherwise so let's work together."
He was only given a mischievous smile when he asked Seamus why he told Harry about it. As if he was certain that Harry would go and sought Malfoy himself.
“Geez, I'm just saying. No need to attack me.” huffed Weasley, back to digging in his food as he muttered more sulky words under his breath that definitely got ignored by the other three.
"Well," began Harry, ignoring Seamus. "I did and I forgot to tell you about it because that damn git was hard to approach!"
Oh Heavens, if his colleagues saw the way he pathetically begged for his life, his reputation would drop much quicker than getting demoted to a lower rank.
His three friends looked at one another with the same confused look upon their faces, but decided to humour Harry and followed the direction of where Harry has pointed out to see the two boys were whispering with each other; the black haired boy mindlessly gestured to their table. After exchanging a few more whispers, the black haired boy looked at their table again, this time followed by the white-blond haired boy. They shared a look full of mischief, locking their eyes to Harry and
"I supposed." said Draco, feigning a nonchalant gesture making Harry laugh with his antics. What a lovely creature.
“Come on, Granger. You're going to be late yourself.” Draco tapped her shoulder as she shoved the last piece of chips in her mouth, copying Draco’s movement in the process.
As if on cue, Hermione and Ginny walked through the door of the Great Hall, several students from Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff followed in. There were boxes that were levitating behind them, as they purposely walked towards the Slytherin table. Harry followed their movement with his eyes, noticed how everyone in the Great Hall had the look of anticipation on their faces except for the Slytherin who was watching the commotion with confusion.
“Well,” began Hermione with a thoughtful look, though there was a teasing glint in those brown eyes. “If you count an imitation of a dying fish as not too silly, then yes, I suppose.” She shrugged, biting her lip to prevent her from laughing when Harry stared at her in horror.
It has been an hour since they've started their reading, he should give them a break already. He put down his book before he gave his son a teasing smile, “Well, why didn't you tell me then?”
He watched in awe as Malfoy moved closer to his brother and leaned down to press a soft kiss on the crown of his head, pulling away to give Leo a charming grin. "You know I'll do anything for you."
Everywhere he went, there would be clusters of Slytherin down from the first years up to seventh, they would surround him, eating up whatever Malfoy said with eagerness that poked annoyance out of Harry for taking the blond's attention away from him. Of course, his friends were with him the whole time and Harry had noticed how Malfoy was back on his track becoming the Slytherin Prince, though this time it was actually looked like he was leading them into light, proven when there was change in Slytherins' attitude towards other houses.
“We apologize for our rudeness, papa.” said Scorpius, trying to appear polite. “Let us help you.” He nudged Albus’ side as he grabbed one of their father's hands so his brother could grasp the other. With the help of uncle Blaise and aunt Pansy, they pulled their father up to his feet.
When Ron went silent and fidgeting in his spot, Harry rolled his eyes as Zabini snorted, “The least you could do was to defend your statement, Weasley.”
“Al, this is Headmistress McGonagall and we're currently at the Headmistress’ office.” said Scorpius carefully once Albus stood next to him, his eyes were wild despite his calm demeanor and Albus know how much his brother wanted to expressed their success; a proper manner however, was what they need to show in front of a stranger- that was what papa always said.
Henry stared at him blankly, eyes turned glassy before he gave a dejected chuckle, and whispered, “I know.”
A set of identical grins answered her invitation. They were making their way towards the gargoyle when Scorpius timidly tugged down McGonagall’s robe.
“Anyway!” Henry cut brightly, “I assumed that there's a plan already?” He looked at them, searching for their faces and stopped at Malfoy. He mischievously made his way to him, the twins giggled but stayed on their spot to give their dad and papa some space. The rest of them move to gather around Harry. Ginny had her hand locked with Parkinson, faces filled with excitement to see the interaction.
"But I thought you wanted me to let go of you?" Harry tilted his head, aiming for an innocent look but he could hardly conceal the smile from forming seeing Malfoy's irritated face.
“I think I need a moment.” Draco breathed heavily and closed his eyes, mindlessly waved his hand around for a seat but a small hand caught his hand and led him to sit.
“What?” Harry snapped, reluctantly tore his gaze off Malfoy to look at Henry who had his eyes trained on the both of them with a slight resignation on his face.
Harry chuckled, pressing a soft kiss on top of Draco’s head before he began with his memories of the twins growing up, tales of mischief and their little adventures were shared with enthusiasm. Cocoon in a warm quilt, the two of them spent the night talking, sharing their bodies' heat until none of them could keep their eyes open, and they fell asleep in each other's arms.
He knew he had said the wrong thing the moment those eyes went steel. "You're being incredibly selfish, Potter. We both know that I am the only one who can successfully sneak into the Palace!"
Draco sip his drink as he eyed Potter, and the man raised an eyebrow at him when he noticed Draco’s staring.
"Was there even any problem at the first place?" asked Harry, pulling away from the other male slightly to take a good look on his face. "You kissed me, and I kissed you, and if you didn't want to be with me, you shouldn't have pulled that stunt. You were the one who kissed me first."
Scorpius repressed a yelp when he saw their younger dad grabbed a pillow, lifted it up revealing the old parchment that was tucked innocently just on the corner of the bed, right on where he was currently standing, thank Merlin it was away from their dad's view. He carefully reached out, slipped out a hand and tugged it off, and quickly hid it under the Cloak as he quickly moved to the other side of the room, and stood still, leaving his twin brother to deal with their dad.
“Of course.” Draco stepped back, allowing Potter to move and walk away from Draco. He stops to look over his shoulder when he was about to disappear from Draco’s eyesight, a thankful smile drawn upon his face which Draco replies with a smile of his own and an awkward wave. With a polite nod, Potter continues his journey, disappearing from Draco line of sight and probably away from his life too.
“You know,” Weasley piped in, “This has been going on for almost over a year already. Don't you think it's time to give up?”
"Harry Potter needs my help." said Malfoy, a smirk appeared on his face as he started to walk teasingly towards him but stopped in front of his brother.
“So, when are you going to Madam Promfey?” asked Pansy when they had finished their breakfast, and now just lounging around enjoying the sun. She had her hand on Blaise’s hair, stroking them lightly as he peacefully enjoyed his little nap.
His agony turned into confusion however, when his lover's body was surrounded with lights all of a sudden. He unconsciously tightened his grip when the lights turned brighter, particles of his lover's body suddenly turned into the lights itself, dissipating upwards into thin air.
Albus watched as his brother paced around the room like a headless chicken, making him grab a handful of his hair as he shouted in frustration, “Scorpius!”
"Good show, Potter." said Zabini, eyes full with mirth and followed his friend's path. Nott and Goyle were steps behind, nodding at Harry with approval that made him grinned stupidly.
“No,” Draco took a breath, “I mean, all this! Being kind to me, and paying attention to me all of a sudden. Am I that pathetic?” He choked out.
"Hm," hummed Malfoy, slightly smirking as he made a show to gracefully walk towards one of the tables, and rest his hips on top of it. "May I know why dear brother wasn't fit for the role?"
“Then it won't be a surprise!” Albus announced, seemingly has stopped doodling the blank parchment as he already put his attention to Draco eagerly.
He took his seat with a confused mind, eyes trained on the piece of paper in his hand as he read the content carefully. Draco read the content twice, thrice and locked his eyes at one particular sentence again and again.
Harry hesitated, but a tug from the twins managed to move his leg further down the door. He sent Malfoy one last look, giving him a reassurance smile before the door closed by Henry, and Harry heavily dragged his feet to follow his friends, with Malfoy’s tight smile imprinted in his mind.
“The usual. But this time it was with,” Neville pauses, twisting his face into a wince before he continues. “Dixon.”
Draco groans out loud. It's probably been over a few minutes now and he can still hear the sound of a baby crying their heart out. He tries to tune it out, hoping that if he stares at his documents hard enough, the sound would probably diminished.
He had his face facing the open window, hands lose in between his parted legs. Permanent scowl written on his injured face. There was a nasty bruise around his right eye, a cut on the bridge of his nose, on his lips, and on his eyebrow. Each decorated with dried blood. Harry gaze down to his hand to see his knuckles were decorated with blood too, must be Dixon's.
Draco threw his gaze at her, and cleared his throat, stealing a glance at beaming Potter before he answered, “Well, I'm over my mourning period now so I'm good.”
McGonagall only gave him a kind smile. "We were not on our best self during difficult times, Harry."
Their uncle widened his eyes and laughed out loud, throwing his head back and clutched onto his stomach. “And they know me too!”
"Yes," agreed Harry, pursing his lips in a thin line. "The curse consumed his magic for years it seemed, even before I met him again but it was not until the last two years that the curse finally took a toll on him."
“Not going to stop you,” said Potter. “Who knows, maybe someday I'll fall for you.” He winked, and Draco laughed. Trust Potter to give him high hope.
“Right, then let's do it.” said Pansy, grinning excitedly making Draco smile at her. It was nice to see her interested in something.
"Hey, hurry up!" Seamus' voice from the door startled them both; Harry thank Godric that his culprit's soft yelp covered up his sudden body jerk.
"Harry," a soft voice called, and he felt a pair of warm hands cradle his face gently. "No matter what happened, I will come back to you, I promise."
Well, to think about it, he already had a hunch that his mysterious kisser might be a Slytherin seeing as they were cunning enough to pull such a scheme. Hence, Malfoy. He was powerful enough to cast a strong Disillusionment Charm, and don't even start with the chocolates. He knew that the chocolates were expensive, one that were not sold in Honeydukes and he had already eaten good chocolates from the shop.
He waited patiently until he felt the same soft pressure against his lips again, a faint pleasant smell of sweet - like vanilla - invaded Harry's nose that got him to curved his lips in a lazy smile just in time to catch the lips against him in an open mouth kiss.
"You were having twins, Harry," McGonagall words snapped Harry out of this thought as he focused his attention back on the Headmistress. "Their combined magic can easily cover up the curse, as well as slowing the process of magic consumption done by the curse. It was the exact reason why the curse was not detected during his pregnancy."
“Merlin, you're helpless. I can't believe I was such- You don't have to be worried, Harry.” Henry sighed, exasperated. “Draco’s in a good hand. Aren't you, Draco?”
“Draco,” He heard Pansy called, he looked up to her. “Future husband.” She stage whispered and Draco couldn't help but to curl his lips in amusement. Trust Pansy to make him feel better.
“Cool.” Draco says, and honestly he doesn't know what to do, should he perhaps congratulate Potter for having a son? He doesn't even know that Potter's married. It's been a long time since he read the papers, and he stayed away from gossip as much as he could. Plus, he has been focusing on redeeming himself to put his attention elsewhere.
He noticed that the Slytherin managed to avoid any of the returning Gryffindors, and if he suddenly decided to come and see Harry, it must be important then.
"I know it was really hard for you right now, but believe me when I said that you're going to make it in the future. You're the most stubborn head person I've ever met, and nothing's going to stop you from getting back on top of your feet no matter how deep you were dragged down. You're Draco Malfoy, the husband that I'm proud of, the husband that his children are willing to take their chance to travel back in time for him, the husband that I'm not willing to give up. You're going to make it no matter what."
Harry breathlessly chuckled, knowing it was Draco’s tactic to distract him and of course he succeeded.
It gave Draco a short circuit; he doesn't know what Potter was playing at but it's raising his hopes for Potter way past the roof. He doesn't know what to do.
There was dead silence as everyone turned their eyes on him. The twins seemed to communicate to each other with their eyes when Albus looked at him dead in the eye, “If you think we're your sons, Mr. Harry Potter, You're dead wrong.”
Ginevra laughed, clearly amused. “Well, I can see now why Harry decided to switch team.” She said in mischief as Potter suddenly spluttered vigorously next to her, “Ginny!”
“So,” said Potter, as he drummed his fingers on Draco’s thigh. “How's your crush been going so far?”
"I just, uh." Harry scratched his cheek, thinking of a good answer and adjusted his glasses as he looked at Malfoy through his lashes. "I just want to see your condition."
Malfoy gave him a wild look, wiping his lips in the process before he wailed his arms, gesturing nothing in particular. "I- You, we're not meant to be together!"
His husband, who he will spend his lifetime with in the future, who shared beautiful children together with him, and the person who would do anything for him and his children.
In an instant, Draco felt like he was being sucked into those eyes, he can't look away. As he stared into the older man's eyes, he could see the sincerity behind them, he felt safe, and Draco knew he could trust this man with his life.
Draco continues to sing, counting down the ducks and restarts when the song ended. He rocks and bounce the baby gently as he whimpers, and soon all Draco hears was silence.
“Mr. Potter!” He beamed suspiciously, showing his gummy smile as he wrapped his hand around Harry's neck. Harry warily eyed him, “Yes, Scorpius.”
When Harry heard the door was closed with a soft click, he immediately sprung up his bed, scrambling for his map under his pillow and quickly recite the password. His eyes pinned on the dot that was walking towards Seamus', watch with heart beating hard against his ribcage as they leave the Gryffindor tower straight to the Hospital Wing where Parkinson's dot was seen indicating that she has been waiting for them or perhaps has been replacing the original occupant's place in case of something happened.
“What do you think they want from us?” asked Ron, pursing his lips in distaste but before any of them can answer, Malfoy has reached them.
“Did you guys see that?” Harry pointed to the boys, ignoring the look on her face. “One of them just looks at me- dead in the eyes- like he's challenging me!”
He couldn't let his eyes stray away from the spot Draco and Ginny had gone, until Ron came and gave a firm squeeze on his shoulder.
Draco Malfoy - the insufferable git who sneers at everything Muggle - was fighting, in a Muggle fucking way.
Harry bit his lips unconsciously as he continued to observe the twins; horrendous matching hair in black and white-blond, green and grey eyes, and their dad was a Gryffindor.
“Well, if you must be asking. It's been going on well, so far. He's looking much more attractive these days, and more fit than before. I assumed he's been going to the gym.”
“Looking good today, Potter.” greeted Draco, handing out the small box of treacle tart to the man who received it with gleaming eyes.
“I see the way you look at her, Potter. You can't fool me. You're still in love with her, aren't you?” Draco looked at the man who was now facing the ground.
He followed Seamus when he went to meet Parkinson despite having his eyes trained on him with amusement. Even worse when Parkinson smiled at him like a cheshire cat, enough to give him goosebumps. It took a few moments of awkwardness standing next to the two students that Harry finally got the courage to ask about Malfoy.
"He's damn right!" hollered Pansy at the back getting a rolled eyes from Malfoy, and Harry couldn't help but chuckled.
Harry stopped, suddenly aware that he was sobbing, tears streaming down his face. He looked up to McGonagall who appeared to be affected as well, as her eyes turned glassy. She blinked the tears away, and took a steady breath. "Harry, I am sure you have done everything you could."
"Tell me, Harry." said McGonagall, cutting through Harry's utterances calmly, and gave a reassurance smile when Harry looked rather devastated. "Are you aware of the reason why you've found out about the curse years after Draco gave birth?"
Potter looked up with an unreadable face. Draco decided not to interpret what it means. “I'm letting you go!” He announced, forcing out a smile.
Draco slowly turned to Potter, drawing a slight disbelief look on his face. How dare this man ask such a question! He eyed the man up and down, receiving a smirk in return. He gave his own smirk, changing his demeanor as he sat up straight, looking down on Potter with his chin turned upwards.
“If you don't mind me asking,” Harry heard Ginny start and he quickly turned to them. “What made Malfoy believe that you were his sons from the future?”
“Oh! Pansy smuggled them for us!” said Seamus smugly, lifting his hand and giving it a good wave across the hall.
When everyone gave him a clueless look, including Draco - he sighed, “The photo that they brought along, it does count, right?”
"Thank you, professor." said Harry, as he looked up to McGonagall. "I really have no idea what I've been doing these past few years. I am lost without him, and I feel useless, not knowing what to do to save him."
The moment his eyes fell into his bedside table and saw the box of chocolates that was left by Malfoy however, shattered his thoughts altogether. With dim light illuminated the room, Harry reached out the box with heart dropped down to his stomach as he recalled the reason Malfoy was here earlier. He opened the box to see a week worth of heart shaped chocolates was neatly arranged.
Harry bemusedly followed their eyesight to see Draco Malfoy strode down the Great Hall together with his friends approaching the Slytherin’s table. Before he can even comprehend the situation, the sound of fallen chairs caught his ears and he watched in bewilderment as the two boys runs with all their might towards the Malfoy’s heir and knocked him down the floor with an identical shouts of,
Draco snorted, doesn't quite believe what he just heard. “You're an idiot, do you know that? God knows why I fell in love with you.”
It took a whole minute for him to understand Hermione’s implications and stared at the chocolates in a whole new light when he finally got it. This chocolate may be different from Harry's own heart shaped chocolate, may be a little less tastier than his chocolate, but he has seen them being handed out to the students by one particular Hogwarts house.
“Perhaps, both of you know me too?” A voice of a girl interject, crouching down next to their father and they immediately brightened, “Aunt Pansy!”
“Very well,” he continued, and took a deep breath to calm himself, “Alright, three past possessions of the intended. Papa’s robe?”
“You've got to admit that you're impressed with us, Dad.” said Scorpius easily, giving them a bright smile.
"You'll know it as soon as I have my ways on him." said Harry, irritated all of a sudden when he saw the group of Slytherins walking by, with Malfoy nodding along to a younger Slytherin who was talking. Harry growled when he saw the other male was sneaking glances at Harry, though he quickly averted his eyes elsewhere when Harry narrowed his eyes at him.
Sounds of clapping hands grabbed his attention and he looked up to see the rest of the Malfoy's gang were there, watching their interaction with great interest. Harry merely raised an eyebrow, but didn't move a muscle while Malfoy let out a dying sound at the back of his throat.
Draco raised an eyebrow at him hoping that it'll intimidate Potter but the git only narrowed his eyes in response.
“No way!” Weasley suddenly exclaimed out loud, snapping Draco from their staring contest. He threw his gaze at the ginger git, who was also looking at him now. Everyone is apparently looking at him as if he was some kind of a new specimen. Pansy and Blaise however, looked rather amused.
“Ah, yes. I forgot about that part.” Harry pulled away slightly to look at Draco seriously. “I really really want you in my life, would you take the honour to be my boyfriend?”
He positioned the arrow on the bow, taking a good stance to line up his body to his targets for easier yet effective shots. He pointed his first shot towards Ginevra, seeing as she was the one who pinned Harry to the wall and she got Draco’s approval for her action. He released the bow string, launching the arrow into full speed and landed cleanly on her. She pressed her body closer to Harry as a result, and Harry's grip on her waist tightened.
“You see, papa,” Scorpius began and Draco immediately braced himself. “Harry Potter owned an Invisibility Cloak, and knowing da- er him, all we have to do is to include him into our plan.”
“Come on, boys. Show me the way!” Henry sent Malfoy a wink before he started to walk, marching forward. “Let's have our discussion in our room.” He said then, gesturing to all of them.
Looking at Harry's deep red face, Leo couldn't help but feel the weird tug on his chest. He was already suspicious of Harry's behaviour every time Draco was around, though he thought that he was fooling anyone by acting with hostility in front of Draco but Leo's was not fooled, and he tried to ignore his feelings, thinking it was nothing but Harry couldn't be harbouring a crush on his brother, could he?
Draco made a face, then made a move of straightening down his robe to cover up the sudden awkwardness he felt; perhaps embarrassed of the way he acted in front of Harry. He brought his gaze down then, hands pinching and pulling the fabric of his robe, as if the piece of clothing he was wearing was a new specimen that he had never seen before.
“I think you're late for your next class, Malfoy.” said Potter suddenly, making Draco to check on his watch promptly. He curses at the time, and quickly stood up, gathering his things and piled them up in his arms.
He caught a movement on his right and gasped when he saw that Harry had the golden arrow between his fingers. Heavens, no other creatures can see the arrow except for Draco’s own kind. Harry however, did not only saw the golden arrow, he even managed to catch it effortlessly, and now he was playfully twirling it around as if it was a toy.
He was thankful for his friends' who had shown their concern over Harry's love life; Ron was actually sad that the mysterious kisser had stopped their scheme on Harry whilst Hermione had advised him to stay positive as she said: "If he was the one for you, you will find him eventually."
Other than that, they did talk. Talked that it was Draco’s friends who have been encouraging him to test his luck on Harry, seeing as he has been harbouring his crush since forever. Harry delightfully noted that Malfoy went as red as a ripe tomato when he said it. Harry teased him at first, but he decided to spare him and told Draco that if he hadn't acted, Harry would have never realised his feelings towards Draco. He thanked Draco by pressing his lips against him, pleased to see the pale cheeks flushed beautifully.
She nodded at something behind him and he turned to see Malfoy walking towards them. Just meters away behind him were Zabini and Parkinson, following his pace with Malfoy’s twins each on their side.
“What, right now?” asked Weasley again, giving a mild protest as Granger and She Weasley went to him and dragged him off the floor to the door. Pansy and Blaise trailed behind them.
Harry immediately shut his eyes tightly as soon as the words were uttered; frustrated with the way he felt, frustrated with the whole situation, and even more so when he could feel his eyes turned wet. He was being selfish, he knew that. They have already planned the mission months ago, they have agreed and he had tried to ignore it until the day has come and yet when it does, his selfish heart couldn't let it happen.
A sudden chuckle broke their staring session, and they turned to the sources revealing a tall young adult with brown skin, standing behind their father with an amused smile. “I didn't know you had kids, Draco.”
McGonagall bit her lips, thinking. "I believe, due to his magic separation with the twins. Just like during pregnancy, magical children will share the amount of their magic with their carrier until they are old enough to produce magic on their own."
“It does count.” said Grangers, giving Weasley an impressive look before she sagged, “But that just one. We need two more.”
Granger cursed. “Come, Draco!” She made her move and stood up, tightening her grip on his elbow and pulled his hard from his seat.
The twins nodded their heads simultaneously, giving him a big bright smile. Draco promptly choked into nothing.
"I- I already- use all my power to- so- so I can say, say my farewell to you," whispered Draco, eyes wet with tears, bloodied lips stretch into a small smile. "I, I love you, with all my heart."
One would say that he was only an empty shell of a man that used to live for the mere purpose of existence. He has no purpose, moving like a loving corpse, only breathing to execute his role as a King.
He received a brilliant smile from Henry. “That's my sweetheart.” The older man released Draco’s face as he stepped back, pulling out his wand from his back pocket and Draco took a deep breath as Henry pointed the wand at him. “I'll start from your right toe, followed by the left, both of your calves and up till your fingertips.”
The first thing Albus felt the moment his arse touchdown was the solid ground. He made a quick pat around his body to ensure everything was intact.
Potter laughed out loud, amused, while Weasley groaned next to him. “Come on! I'm trying to eat here!”
“His father was in an important meeting, and that witch was his babysitter but as you can see, he doesn't do well with her.”
Their younger dad smiled even as his face was dreaded with worry. "Alright, there was an old parchment somewhere and we need to find it. Can you do that?"
"Oh, my little Cupid." chuckled Harry, dragging a single finger across Draco’s cheek with a butterfly touch. "I'm not going to kill you."
He tried to bribe a group of young Slytherins to tell him what got Malfoy busy but other than losing ten galleons for the information, he received nothing but chocolates. A small box of chocolates in fact. He brought the box over to the Gryffindor table on dinner, handed them to the hungry hyenas of his friends as he watched with narrowed eyes as the group of young traitors of Slytherins were apparently talking to Malfoy. No doubts reporting to the white-blond haired of the situation. His suspicion proved when Malfoy glanced over to their table, sought Harry's eyes with both confusion and amusement written on his face that got Harry to pinched His lips together. Embarrassed that his scheme was caught red handed, he moved his attention elsewhere and started to talk with Ron. When he looked up to the Slytherin table again, he was pleased to see a soft smile carved on Malfoy's face.
That can only mean one thing; “I guess we can find the book in the Restricted Section at the library.” said Draco, index finger reached out to touch his chin in a deep thought. “However,” He continued, “The only way I can bring the both of you is without you being seen by anyone and that is impossible. I barely know Disillusionment Charm myself, so we need another plan.”
“Pansy?” They choruses in puzzlement, simultaneously turned to face the Slytherin’s table and watched in astonishment as Pansy Parkinson, of all people, waved back to Seamus, complete with a flirtatious wink.
They obediently move, sending each other a mixed look; where Zabini, Parkinson, and Ginny were amused, Hermione and Ron looked rather bemused by the situation and Harry doesn't know what to feel.
Dear Merlin, but his mysterious culprit didn't show himself today. No kisses, no heart shaped chocolate. Worse, Harry didn't even think about him; not once did the thought of a mysterious kiss have crossed his mind.
Harry sighed heavily, feeling down that he won't have his kisses anymore. That is, unless he was the one who went to sought it himself-
Draco took a sip of his drink, eyes locked onto its current target; a young woman seemingly in her early twenties. She was wearing a tight short red dress that complimented her body magnificently as well as her long red wavy hair where she currently tossed the strands of those beautiful locks behind her shoulder gracefully. The action managed to capture hungry eyes that had been eyeing her in interest, but she delightfully took no notice of their attention.Instead, she put her attention to her companions, clearly having the time of her life.
“I beg your pardon?!” Draco can feel his eyes bulge out, staring at Henry astonishingly. He unconsciously raised his hands to put them protectively in front of his chest, giving the older man a stinky eye.
Harry frowned at the man's sudden shy behaviour. “Well, let's hurry up. Don't want to get your husband waiting.”
"Just feel like doing so." Harry grinned, grabbing a pillow from his bed and chuck it straight to Ron's head receiving a colourful curses from his friend. "Hurry up and get ready, I'm starving already."
"Also, because Ginny had accidentally saw him used the charm on Parkinson when she went to thank him." said Hermione, suppressing a smile when Harry regarded her with a great surprise.
"Don't touch me!" Harry swatted the older man's hand as soon as they were out within Malfoy's hearing range.
Harry gave Zabini a glare, “No offense to you, Zabini, but it's my eyes, I can do whatever I want with it.”
Potter smiled in satisfaction as Draco stood in front of him, presenting his cheek to Draco  and tapping it lightly. “You forgot your kiss.”
Harry agreed, he had seen it himself and it was a pretty wicked thing to see a perfect Disillusionment Charm, and to think that Malfoy had the audacity to perform it in front of him just to get away from him was pretty endearing. However, that doesn't really explain anything, he looked at Hermione in confusion making the bushy haired girl roll her eyes at him.
“I think I'm falling in love with you.” He quickly announced, pressing his lips together then in a timid way.
“Headmistress, we've heard from the healer that there was no solution for papa’s curse because it was an old curse." explained Albus. "We tried to help by reading books about curses and Scorpius found one solution which involved papa’s virgin blood. That was the reason why we're here.” said Albus firmly, his eyes determined as they met McGonagall’s.
The witch sighs eventually as her eyes turn thankful. She smiled apologetically at Draco as she carefully hands the baby over to Draco. “Yes, please. Thank you.”
“Who in the right mind wants to harm children?” Ron snorted, a beat after McGonagall has concluded her speech while eyeing the two boys. “I mean, despite the Slytherin’s robes, they were kind of adorable. Don't you think, Harry?”
Oh, why does he feel like he can't breath all of a sudden? His sight on Granger getting blurry, as he struggled for air.
Draco slowly put the article on his table, and runs his fingers through his hair. He's not even sure if Potter was the one who put the stack of papers in his office, it might be someone else's doing.
“Yes, but it's not fun without you.” said Potter softly, and Draco felt his heart slammed hard at his words.
“There you go, my answer to your question.” Draco huffed, continuing his steps. He placed down the drinks as he arrived, and hands immediately grabbed the filled glasses. He grabbed his own, taking his seat and Potter copied his movement, squeezing in the spaces between their friends as he regarded Draco with a look of concern.
Harry was forced back into his reality by the sudden shout of his name. He jumped, frantically looking around to realise that he was still in Potions, with an angry Malfoy glowering down at Harry.
“I went up to check on them when all I saw was our wands, on the floor.” said Henry, giving the twins an unimpressed look. He received identical sheepish smiles making the older man scoffed. “I can't wait until papa hears about this.”
He let himself dragged by the twins, looking over his shoulder to see Malfoy already has his eyes on him, panicked. Harry forced himself to stop, making sure his grip on the twins secure and safe when they stumbled upon their feet by the abrupt change of pace.
