She usually broke first and asked one of her questions. That seemed to be her favourite defensive move when she encountered his implacable silences. She’d start in on another annoying round of “What was something that made you feel frustrated this week?”, and then he’d give her one of his reassuring smiles and say something like “Oh, I don’t really know,” and glance at the clock on the wall to see if it was time to leave yet. It never was.
“Are you sure?” Draco asked calmly. “I am quite certain that you are supposed to teach Potions this term. My son says you have missed every class, and it’s nearly the end of term.”
think that, although it had certainly crossed his mind as a possibility—but Harry still couldn’t figure out why Malfoy had invited him in the first place. It was an itch under his skin, a riddle that needed solving.
“You promised to tell me what’s going on,” Potter said, taking a step backwards, away from Draco’s reach. “Now’s your chance.”
“Ugh.” Potter flopped backwards across the sofa, throwing an arm over his eyes. “Must we do this now?”
Potter let out a sound of disgust. “Slughorn is a terrible professor,” he said. “But fine, I’ll touch all of the books and find the one that gives me a shock.” He ran his hands along a third of the books crammed into the shelf before he suddenly jerked his hand away. “I felt it!” he said, shaking his fingers out a bit as he looked down at Draco triumphantly.
He led Draco back out of the living room to the door that opened into the back garden, but he paused when they were outside the house and hidden by the garden fence. “What’s wrong?” he asked.
Harry lets out a shaky sigh of relief, and their faces are close enough together that Draco feels some of his hair shift in response. “I love you so much,” Harry says, and he presses a kiss against Draco’s lips. Draco returns it, and it’s sweet and gentle, and then Harry shifts a bit and their bodies press against each other and suddenly it feels like it could turn into something else at any moment.
“Does it matter?” Draco asked. He made a notation on the parchment he was working on, dotting a letter with a completely unnecessary flourish that lifted Harry’s mood a little. He lived for the small details these days, cooped up in this space with Draco hour after hour. He was rapidly becoming attuned to all of Draco’s moods and idiosyncrasies.
“Well, that does sound promising,” Malfoy says. “What makes this new wand different?”
“Well,” Malfoy said briskly. “No need to read too much into this particular dream. Can you tell me where you work?”
“I’m dreaming of a cloud that steals my memories?” Potter said, sounding unimpressed. “That doesn’t make any sense.”
“Potter,” Draco said. “I hope your long nap was refreshing. You’re in St. Mungo’s; there’s no need to be alarmed. I was asked to perform a special legilimency operation for you.”
“How about an alternative one: five years blissfully free of your interference in my life, and now you barge back in all of a sudden?" Malfoy breathed in; the end of the cigarette flared. He turned away from Harry, pressing his back against the wall once more. “No, I don’t trust it for a moment. You can tell your superiors that Draco Malfoy is a law-abiding citizen and that sending the Chosen One in a hamfisted attempt to intimidate me out of my chosen profession simply makes them look like fools.”
Draco’s eyes narrowed, then he reached out and grabbed his wand off of his desk. “
office.” He turned to glare at Draco. “
“Is it though?” Harry grumbled. He didn’t feel quite awake yet. He hung his coat on the coatrack by the door and stared at his desk, not yet prepared to give in and get down to work.
“Oh,” Harry said. “That’s… nice, I guess?”
Harry tried very hard to ignore Draco’s pacing and muttered spells over the next few minutes as he frantically filled out forms. Every so often there would be a short, sharp sensation as Draco would attempt a new way of burrowing through his shield. Harry was glad they were in such a small room; it meant that the usual technique of simply bombarding a shield until it collapsed would risk damaging the rest of the office, a fact which worked in Harry’s favour.
“So, Harry was hit by one of those magical viruses?” Weasley asked. “But why did it go after his memories?”
“I don’t know,” Draco pensively. He let out a breath slowly while he appeared to consider his answer. “I started attending two years ago. At the time I was feeling… alone, I suppose. I found the holiday season difficult that year. The idea that there’s some kind of… order to everything that happens, an overall plan, and ultimately, the possibility of forgiveness… well, it’s a comforting idea to me.” He hesitated again before continuing. “Not that I think that idea negates any sense of personal responsibility or accountability. I believe those are of utmost importance, too. It feels very contradictory at times.”
Draco made another notation on his paper without replying.
He settled for a dismissive “Yes, of course,” as they looked around the dimly-lit restricted section of the library. There were so many aisles to choose from; they really needed some kind of guidance to know where to look.
“Listen,” Harry said, pausing as they passed another alley entrance. “I should be getting home. Might as well apparate from here, but first…” He pulled Draco’s wand out of his coat pocket and held it out in front of him. “I’ll see you tomorrow, yeah?”
“All right,” Harry said. He was vaguely relieved that he wouldn’t have to negotiate any more misunderstandings about his and Draco’s relationship today. “We can slip away, in that case.”
“Isn’t this a depressing sight?”
Harry can’t quite get enough air. “Honestly, I have no fucking idea right now,” he says. He can’t even conceive of where the test wand ended up; he doesn’t care about it at all. He needs to get his hands on Draco. He crosses the space between them in two steps, and Draco’s eyes widen in surprise as Harry brings his palm up to cup his face.
“How could I forget to go to Potions?” Harry asked, distressed. “I need that NEWT for the Aurors! ”
The light situated above the studio door blinded Harry as he stepped out into the dark of early evening, but he could make out a dim Malfoy-esque shape leaning against the wall further down the sidewalk. A small light flared in the vicinity of Malfoy’s hand, and he watched as Malfoy brought it near his face, briefly illuminating a cigarette sitting between his lips. He lit it before extinguishing the flame in his fingers, and Harry watched as he expelled a small cloud into the night air.
“But we were working together, and it seemed like a bad idea, right?” Harry asked.
“Focus, Potter!” Draco said sharply. Letting go of Potter’s dick, he reached out with both hands and placed them on the other man’s arse. It really was a fine specimen, he thought. It fit wonderfully in his hands. He gave a little push against it, forcing Potter to thrust his cock into Draco’s mouth and eliciting a hiss of pleasure from him. “Or do you need some more encouragement?” he tried to ask around it. “Perhaps you’d like to fuck my mouth?” The words came out a bit garbled, since he still had the length of Potter’s dick to contend with.
Harry couldn’t keep himself from laughing. “Just trying to add some Christmas spirit around this dreary place!” he said.
a turn on. “Come on, Potter, try to keep up.”
Harry shook his head. It really was baffling, when he stopped to think about it, that he was sitting across from Malfoy and receiving art tips from his former childhood nemesis.
“Oh!” Harry said as it suddenly came to him. “Beginning!”
“You’re insane,” Potter told him as Draco stopped climbing a few rungs below him. “Just tell me what I’m actually looking for here and we can get off this death trap.”
“You didn’t show up to Potions today,” Draco said, pretending to be put out. “There’s only so long you can coast on being the saviour of the wizarding world. Nobody wanted to be my partner, so Slughorn decided to put us together. I’m sure he thought it was hilarious.”
“It’s not open,” Draco said, still engrossed in his work.
“They wouldn’t,” Harry stated. He pushed his sleeves up; the room was getting uncomfortably warm. “I really am very good at my job. It would be mad to let me go.”
“This is Draco Malfoy,” he said curtly. He consciously reminded himself to moderate his tone; he may be disappointed by how the interaction with Potter concluded, but it wasn’t something he needed to take out on others.
Harry sighed and turned on his wheel again.
“Where would you go for some privacy?” Draco asked desperately. “If you wanted time alone.”
did wands have to have such phallic shapes?
to have faith in my methods.” He looked at Harry consideringly. “I believe it’s my turn to ask a question again.”
“You have posh drinks with your Slytherin friends,” Harry tried. He walked over to his chair and sat down in it, to at least provide the illusion that he was about to start his paperwork at any moment. “You all meet up in a place with real silver and eat tiny portions of deconstructed Christmas dinner.”
Ginny crossed her arms. “I think this is the first time I’ve ever heard you appeal to professionalism,” she said.
The rest of the evening passes quietly, as Draco rattles around their large flat looking for things to keep himself occupied. By the time it’s quarter to eleven, Draco is sitting in Harry’s armchair and reading a book. He always takes advantage of Harry’s absences to sit in his chair, or sleep in his side of the bed. There’s a look that Harry gives him when he realizes that the cushion indentations are slightly wrong, and Draco always pretends he has no idea what Harry is on about. Now Draco finds himself rereading the same page over and over, and his blinks are gradually growing slower. There’s been no further word from Harry, so he finally hauls himself off to bed. He rolls his head around on Harry’s pillow a bunch for good measure before switching off the lamp and drifting off to sleep.
“Thanks,” Harry said wryly as he nursed his bruised kneecaps.
Harry looked guiltily at the stack of papers that remained on his desk. Truthfully, there was nothing he’d like to do more than skive off, but at the rate he and Malfoy were going they were going to be in it for the long haul. He really wanted to be done with work before New Year’s Eve so he could actually have a few days off.
“That’s just how it is,” she said. “Not much call for evidence right about now.”
When he looked up again, Draco was looking into his own mug again. After a moment he raised his eyes to meet Harry’s, then thrust his mug forward and pronounced, “To family, old and new!”
Harry’s face cleared. “Oh, that’s alright,” he said, magnanimously. “I remember being that age. I’m just sorry that you had to come all this way for nothing.”
"Git.”
“Fuck the wand,” Harry says. He’s hungry. He needs to sate the fire that’s raging inside him.
“As instructed.” Harry resisted the urge to touch his wand holster as they descended into the basement.
“Oh, er, no, sir,” Harry said. “That is, everything’s fine, sir.”
“Why is Pansy there?” Harry asked, taken aback.
Draco’s current working theory was that it either fed off of Potter’s attention somehow, or the sustained focus of a particular dream environment. Maybe if they kept moving it wouldn’t bother them, or perhaps that was just coincidence. Unfortunately, in Draco’s experience, dream motion was too unpredictable to be relied upon indefinitely. Sometimes the dreamer would just be transported to their destination immediately; other times their dream brain might focus on the journey, but there would just be indeterminate, liminal spaces between the two points.
Potter stared at him. “What?” he asked. “What are you talking about?”
that Draco threw at him; he had apparently decided to follow Harry’s example and win at any cost. He frantically stood to cast an
Potter threw his head back and gave a guttural moan as Draco kept jerking him, and Draco felt his lips part in preparation—
All eyes in the room swung to Harry. “Wait, you mean this was… an attack or something?” he asked, eyes wide. “Why?”
Potter stared at him for a moment. “I have no idea what you’re talking about,” he finally said, frostily. “But I think you should leave now.” A swift rapping at the office door dragged his attention away from Draco. “Ah, that will be Ginny,” he said, getting up from his chair and striding over to the door. “Please don’t let me keep you.”
“Polly sent me,” Harry said. It was the code-phrase.
“Now we just—” Harry begins, before his mouth is so dry that he is forced to swallow. He can
“Merlin,” Weasley said. “That’s too wild.” He stared at Potter’s slumbering form as the man’s chest rose and fell for a few breaths. “Alright,” he decided. “It sounds weird, but I’m sure you know what you’re doing.” He gave Draco a nervous glance. “You do, don’t you? You must, if they let you work here.”
, Draco thought to himself. “It’s my number,” he snapped. “In case you ever want to get a drink with me, just as a completely random example.”
Hermione pursed her lips but didn’t pursue the argument. The silence hung between them for a moment before Harry relented.
Potter huffed, annoyed. “This is the most ridiculous assignment,” he said as he gazed around them. He paused as he looked down one aisle in particular that Draco hadn’t paid any attention to. “What about that one?”
Draco firmed up his resolve. “Yes, of course,” he said quickly. “I was just devising a plan of attack, that’s all.”
He gives a shaky little nod to Draco and turns back to the wand, checking carefully along its length. It appears to have settled together perfectly; he’s not entirely sure how much time passed while he was in Draco’s thrall just now, or perhaps something about Draco’s power also caused the glue to set faster than usual, but he’s not going to complain. This project has turned out to be far more intense than he ever bargained for.
“What would you like me to say?” Malfoy asks. It’s a reasonable question, and Harry is irrationally irritated by it. He can’t split his focus between making the wand and directing the conversation as well as avoid thinking about how Malfoy is just
Harry settles his head back against Draco’s shoulder, and they stand under the stream together. “There was…” he begins, haltingly, but Draco can barely hear him over the rushing water before he trails off again. “Sorry,” he finally says. “I didn’t want to…”
“Jesus, Gin,” Harry said, hiding his face as he took a drink, but he knew they were both thinking of how their relationship had petered out. After five months of telling their friends they were on a break, Ginny had quietly volunteered that she was thinking of asking Pansy Parkinson out, and Harry had agreed that she should follow her heart. He’d been surprised by how much relief he’d felt when they finally acknowledged that their relationship had run its course.
Harry crossed his arms. “Yeah, well, you’ll just have to live with that,” he said. No way was he telling Malfoy anything about why he was stuck in this class.
Harry snorted. “I wouldn’t expect anything less from you,” he said. “Fire away.”
“Right, the Diagon Business Improvement Association came to us. They said there had been a string of thefts for the past few months.”
“I’m not saying no!” Potter said quickly. “In fact—I’m saying yes. I… I will definitely find it ‘pleasurably distracting.’ Although I’m impressed that you can make even sex sound pretentious.”
Harry’s breath caught. “Only if you want to,” he said, feeling his pulse race.
go through them. She was Teddy’s age, and I kept thinking… Anyways, the new test results came back. There was swelling in her brain. Nobody was arguing we should send her home anymore. At least we could treat it.” Harry turns away from Draco, sort of flopping on his back as he lets out a sigh. “It just… hit me, how young she was. How it could have been so much worse if we sent her home. If I wasn’t there.”
“I’m nearly there,” Potter said tightly. “I just...” He stilled again, and Draco felt the other man’s stomach muscles clench. He looked up at Potter’s face; he was looking out at the surrounding darkness once again.
“It’s natural to have performance anxiety,” Harry says, and he smirks a bit at his own joke.
As if sensing his cue, Potter once again emerged from the back room, this time clad only in a towel, his hair dripping. “Malfoy,” he said, a smile appearing on his face. “I’m glad you could make it. Sorry about…” He made a half-hearted motion towards the broad expanse of warm brown skin that Draco was having a hard time ignoring. “It was the faculty Quidditch match, you see. It went longer than expected.”
to me as I read it. It’s like when I try to read something in a dream.”
“Gentlemen,” Robards said, sticking his head around the ajar door. “Everything on track for a clean holiday break this year?”
“See if I ever try to help you again,” Harry muttered, but he couldn’t help smiling when Draco laughed openly.
Harry smiled to himself. It was a classic Draco non-apology - acknowledging his involvement in whatever transpired, and a vague sentiment of regret that still cast him as the party on the correct side of the issue. Harry used to find them frustrating when they had started working closely together, but as he had grown more accustomed to Draco’s personality, he had begun to appreciate them almost as an art form.
Malfoy lifted his fingers away, hovering them just over the wheel without touching the work in progress. There seemed to be scant millimetres separating them from the clay, but Malfoy kept perfect control and never let them touch. “Sometimes I take stock of what I’ve done so far,” he began. “Then I try to visualize what I will do next. For me, pottery is about being deliberate, about making choices.” He moved his hands above the indentation he’d previously made, held them there once more. He lightly ran one finger along the rim, not making an impression, just seeming to enjoy the sensation. Harry couldn’t take his eyes off of the sight.
They put up a token resistance, but Harry insisted and they didn’t press him. Ginny ruffled his hair and told him to get his beauty rest; Pansy did a little head jerk which was her way of saying goodbye to people she was friendly acquaintances with; and Blaise gave him a small, lazy wave with a smile.
“Remember,” Malfoy said gently. “You can stop the wheel at any time if you’d prefer not to continue. All you have to do is take your foot off the pedal.”
“Just get rid of my glamour,” the man sighed. “This is tedious.”
“This is ridiculous. Why don’t you come and look for it, since you seem to know so much about it?”
A slight frown appeared on Draco’s face. “Typical eloquence from you,” he said, sitting up straighter and grabbing a new piece of parchment. “Well, are we finished prying into my personal affairs? Can we return to our endless stacks of paper yet?”
“The intern! Robards got us one of the summer interns from the evidence department, and you wouldn’t stop making fun of him behind his back. You called him Little Lord Fauntleroy, which, honestly, coming from you is really quite something.”
“None of that now,” Malfoy said, leaning forward to close some of the distance between them. “Just keep your gaze on me, nice and steady. You know what a bowl looks like; I know you must have used one once in your life. All you need is that mental image—staring at the wheel won’t will it into being.”
“Listen,” Draco says, pulling back slightly. “I need to warn you that if we continue right now, there’s a very real risk that I’ll just fall asleep and you’ll end up desperately rubbing yourself off against my snoring body.” His traitorous mouth yawns again for good measure, and he falls back against his pillow. “See?”
“Potter,” Draco warned. “I swear, if we end up trapped here because you’re fucking embarrassed about a dream you once had…”
In the end, Draco finished going through his side of Harry’s desk first and had to watch anyway. In Lord Fauntleroy’s defence, the paperwork was more or less together, despite the mess it existed within. Harry let out a shout of triumph as he discovered a witness information sheet; skimming the page, it looked like it contained a transcription of one of the Diagon shopkeepers’ statements about the early thefts. He handed the page to Draco and pulled the rest of the parchment stack closer to him so he could flip through its contents more easily.
Draco stepped towards Potter, holding up his hands placatingly. “You’re probably dealing with a lot of new information right now—”
Draco crossed his arms defensively. “I almost turned down the Unspeakables invitation,” he said quietly. “I didn’t want to let you down.”
Harry pushes himself off of where he was leaning against the workbench. This result confirms his suspicions; he doesn’t know of any other reason that a wand containing a hair of the spell caster would ever be viable. “Do a quick cast, please?” he asks. “Just to be thorough.”
“Dunno,” Harry said. “I’m not sure if group classes are my thing.”
Draco looked up again and found Potter looking nervously towards the encroaching dark cloud, the book hunt abandoned. “It doesn’t matter,” he said curtly. “But you really need to grab that book right now.”
Draco wracked his memory for any similar cases that he’d treated that might suggest further tests to perform. As he pushed open the door to the patient’s room, Jenkins added, “Also, you should know one more thing, he’s—”
Draco took his wand from Harry’s hand, and Harry felt the most minute brush of their fingers as he did so. Butterflies erupted in Harry’s stomach, and he shoved his hand back into his coat pocket immediately. He swore he could still feel the touch, however.
“It’s just so ridiculous, though,” Harry said. “What’s pottery got to do with showing that I’m ready to get back to work? Nothing, that’s what.” He took an annoyed sip of his beer. “I did a little bit of accidental magic and everybody overreacted, and now I’m stuck playing their games.”
Draco looked at Potter, who had apparently had the time to remove his shirt while Draco was in the throes of an existential crisis about the whole thing. “Oh,” he said, feeling like a fool as he gazed at that expanse of warm brown skin. “My.” He suddenly recalled the dream from earlier, in Potter’s office, when he’d seen a similar sight. Perhaps this wasn’t a
“God, I’m sorry,” the other man said, reaching down to help him off the ground. “I shouldn’t have—Malfoy?”
There’s a palpable, gaping absence when Draco finally moves his face away from Harry’s overstimulated neck, and Harry can’t keep a whimper from escaping when Draco’s hand follows.
“Did you have something in mind?” Harry asked curiously.
Surprisingly, Potter actually transferred the book he was holding to his other hand that was gripping the ladder, awkwardly stretching his now-free hand down towards Draco. Draco reached up to grab it, and found that Potter’s grip was strong; their palms fit together perfectly, like pieces of a puzzle. He didn’t allow himself any more time to consider the matter, however. “Now, we jump,” Draco commanded, and he stepped off the tall ladder, dragging a shocked Potter with him.
“There was so much paper by the end,” Harry said, frowning. “He spent days compiling it all. I remember he worked right up until the end of his internship while we focused on tracking down the brewer.”
“I don’t have any plans for the next few days. Do you?” Draco asked.
“Great.” Harry smiled. “This way we both win.”
“Oh,” Draco breathes.
Potter’s eyes went wide. “Oh,” he said. “Oh, yeah. Er, yes. Good.” His eyes darted to the card again, then met Draco’s once more. “God, I wasn’t sure if you would want that. After, you know. The, er. Well. But you do!”
“Well,” Draco said, suddenly put out. “Ah, in that case… how would you like to proceed?”
“Fuck off,” Harry said, but there wasn’t any heat in it. He kept his gaze on Malfoy, resisting the urge to look down at his wheel. He would show Malfoy that he could do… whatever this was.
Harry wandered back to his seat and considered his wheel. The demonstration had seemed straightforward while Melanie was giving it, but his own wheel suddenly appeared rather daunting. Glancing around the room, he watched the other students placing their clay balls and beginning to turn them, and he decided to copy their movements. It wasn’t long before his wheel was turning his round block of clay happily.
“You always have a choice, Harry,” Draco said, suddenly gazing at him seriously. “I wish to be very clear on this point.”
Harry couldn’t figure out how he ended up on the receiving end of relationship advice from his ex-long-term girlfriend, but to his horror, her suggestion was now firmly implanted in his head; the desks at the office were the perfect height for those sorts of tension-relieving activities. His desk wouldn’t work, obviously, due to the piles of papers on it, but Draco’s had lots of available space on it. And the ministry was empty over the holiday…
“Cards on the table, Potter,” Draco said. He really felt like he was gambling at this point. “If getting you off will get us out of this dream, there’s nothing to stop me from making that happen. I’m gay as a maypole, so I know what I’m doing. However, the real question is what your feelings are on the matter.”
“Yeah, I mean, it’s probably good to get some kind of training instead of whatever the fuck that was that we just did,” Harry said, grinning.
Watching Harry from the corner of his eye and trying not to be obtrusive about it, Draco is relieved to see Harry going through the motions of toweling himself dry. He appears less overwhelmed now, but he’s still being quieter than usual. After a shift Harry likes to vent, or at least relate the details of particularly complex cases that he dealt with. He says that it helps him decompress, even if Draco doesn’t actually understand half of what Harry tells him. Draco worries his lip a bit as he refastens his towel and decides not to ask about the shift again; if Harry’s ready to talk about it, he’ll usually bring it up on his own.
“Well,” Draco said from behind him. “I don’t know about you, but this has been a most unexpected afternoon.”
Ginny shrugged. “If you say so,” she said. “If it counts for anything, my advice is just to bone it out and get it over with. It’s easier in the long run.”
“I’m Healer Malfoy,” he said, and it felt like it came out far too calmly. “Who can tell me what happened?”
“Or the assistant is just crap at assisting,” Harry interjected. He was pretty sure that teachers weren’t supposed to tell their students that they were bad at something.
“Harry?” he tries again, and this time Harry moves his head to look at him, and Draco almost takes a step backwards. Harry’s face is naked, raw, and even though it’s hard to tell through the streams of water running down it, Draco is pretty sure he’s crying.
Draco tried to keep himself from smiling. He had encountered patient fantasies in his mind-magic work over the years; it was unavoidable, really. They were always far more embarrassed about it than he was. “What about them?” he asked, attempting to keep his tone neutral and non-judgemental.
Draco snorted. “It wasn’t exactly ideal circumstances, but it didn’t make me uncomfortable.”
Potter was sitting on the sofa opposite the hearth, looking around a bit dazedly. “Malfoy?” he finally asked. “Where’d you come from? What are you doing in here?”
you have an invisibility cloak,” Draco said in disgust. “Because why wouldn’t you? And did you have that when you were in school, too?”
“Let’s focus on what actually happened,” Draco prompted. “What do you remember doing before you woke up here?”
“Oh,” Malfoy said, and Harry could swear there was a flash of disappointment on his face before he turned away to blow out another cloud of smoke.
“That’s right,” he said. “I’m a Healer now. Where did you hear that?”
“This next step is a bit more delicate,” he says. The quiet is just too much. He figures he may as well keep up the narration; inviting more questions from Draco seems like it’s just asking for trouble at this point. “I need to make a small incision for the wand core without compromising the integrity of the rest of the wand.”
Draco quietly removed himself from the crowd around Potter’s bed while attention was focused on the tests being performed. As he let himself out of the room, he turned back for one more look, only to find Potter gazing after him inscrutably. Draco paused for a moment, just to see if Potter would do or say anything else, then he gave the other man a professional nod and allowed the door to swing closed.
Draco’s mind began to race. Climaxing in a dream as a way of waking Potter up certainly had potential, as far as Draco was concerned. Oh, the logistics of it might well turn out to be a nightmare, but the concept was sound. Sex had the advantage of being a prolonged activity that could potentially act as a distraction for Potter, too. Perhaps they could solve both of their problems.
Looking back towards the entrance to the church, Harry saw the greeter watching him, and she gave him a cheerful thumbs-up. Feeling foolish, Harry found a pew in the back that was largely empty and tried not to call attention to himself as he took a seat in it as quickly as possible. His immediate needs addressed, he finally allowed himself a moment to look around and take in the rest of the service.
“I know,” he said. “I fucked this one up. I really
“What?” Harry asked. “I can’t even look at it?” He couldn’t help it; he kept darting glances back to his spinning clay.
Beside him, Ginny snorted. “Merlin, you sound like Dad. And yes, Pansy is honestly a delight when you get to know her.”
“Alright!” Melanie said cheerfully. “Is there anything you’d like me to fire in the kiln? You can collect it at the next class.”
So Harry could potentially just go to Draco’s home and wait there for him to return. He risked looking like a loiterer, or worse, a stalker, and maybe Draco would find it weird? On the other hand, if Draco had actually forgotten his wand at the office, perhaps the pleasant surprise of having it returned would be enough to overcome the weirdness of Harry lurking outside his house. On the other
“How can you know?” Draco asks quietly. The question hangs between them, slowly expanding to fill the little space that separates them. “That night at the club, too—what if you only feel this way when your judgement’s impaired?”
“Exactly,” Draco said. “You understand me perfectly.” His grin widened as he indulged Harry in this private joke, and Harry felt a warmth growing inside of him. Draco’s smiles were his only weakness. Draco’s smiles and being praised by him. Well, his smiles, his praise, and maybe his playful insults, as weird as that was. Merlin, he was far gone.
“Maybe you can help with that,” Draco said. “Can you recall any particular dreams you’ve had that were interrupted? Maybe they can inspire us. Anything would help, really.”
“Very well,” Malfoy says. He licks his lips, then casts the spell with such a pretentious flourish that Harry rolls his eyes. The stool gracefully lifts off the ground and hovers at the level of Harry’s chest. “Is that good?” Malfoy asks.
Looking over the ingredients arrayed in front of him once more, Draco sighs. Harry had insisted that Draco should follow through on his plans when the call from St. Mungo’s for another Healer had come through just after half three.
Teddy was now laughing too hard to reply, so Harry gently lowered him to the ground head-first, then laid the rest of his body down after. Teddy immediately rolled over and pushed himself to his feet once more. He turned his attention to Draco for the first time, who had held himself back during this whole encounter, and immediately grabbed on to Harry’s trouser leg and gave him a beseeching look.
is what I strive for.”
The image that conjured in Harry’s head was far, far more unprofessional than the previous ones he had been concerned about, and Harry swallowed. “Er,” he said, attempting to get a grip on himself. “Yeah, I’d reckon. Should we be getting back, then?”
“It is nice, you know,” Harry said, before immediately feeling embarrassed.
“What are you playing at, Potter?” Draco finally asked, sounding annoyed, after he pushed his chair back in order to stretch his legs only to discover a full-size Christmas tree blocking his path.
“Yeah, I found him,” Weasley said nervously. “In his office at Hogwarts. I was dropping by as a surprise, and he was just… sitting in his chair at his desk, but slumped over. At first I wasn’t even sure he was breathing.” He shuddered. “When he wouldn’t come to, I got Madame Pomfrey. When she also couldn’t get him up we decided to stick him in the Floo to bring him here.”
“Finish,” Potter said through his fingers. “I always wake up just before I’m about to—. God, please don’t make me keep describing it. I don’t know why I even brought it up.”
“What do you mean it doesn’t matter?” Potter hissed at him. “It’s clearly.. I don’t know, malevolent or something. And it’s coming toward us.”
Harry swallows. “Well,” he says, trying to focus on the work ahead of him. “Come back in a couple days and don’t make those stupid bedroom eyes at anybody else.”
“Scared, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, and Harry
“Don’t let me get in your way,” Malfoy says, and he takes a step aside to allow Harry to pass, maintaining eye contact the entire time that is honestly far too intense.
"Yes, well, that’s hardly a surprise,” Draco said drily, but as they passed under a streetlight, Harry noticed that the tips of his ears appeared pink. Harry smiled to himself, feeling pleased.
“June, I think,” Harry said, spinning slowly in his chair and looking at the ceiling. “It was in the middle of that string of underground brewery busts.”
“Hmmm?” Harry asked, pretending to be deep in thought over a list of Pensieve time codes. He was pretty sure he could see Draco’s eyes narrow, but nothing more was said about the matter.
“Correct!” Draco announced furiously. “There is no sign of the paperwork for the case that goes to trial first thing in the new year. And despite my best efforts, I have no recollection of what we did with it!”
Draco suppressed an eye roll. It always took more effort than he wished to sift useful information from the vast amounts of unnecessary detail that laypeople reported to him. He had to endure several more minutes of musings about the magical internet as he slowly moved his wand from one end of Potter’s body to the other. He was preparing to wrap up the charm as the final wisps fell towards Potter’s forehead, but the abrupt change in colour as they touched his skin quickly banished his complacency.
Harry swallowed. Contemplating revealing the truth of why he had to see a therapist was certainly easier without having to look into Malfoy’s eyes while doing it, but knowing that Malfoy was standing behind him… there was a tension in the air. He wasn’t sure how far away Malfoy was actually standing—he could be right behind Harry, barely not touching him, and Harry would have no way of knowing. He shivered.
“How long will that take?” Draco whispers, practically in his ear. Harry lets out an involuntary gasp.
Jenkins immediately reached out and cast a diagnostic charm, but Draco could already see Potter’s eyes beginning to flutter open. “He’s waking up!” Jenkins announced, unnecessarily, as Potter yawned and stretched.
Harry gritted his teeth. “Can I use this one?” he asked with forced politeness.
“You go ahead and get into bed,” Draco says briskly when they’re both more or less dry. “I’ll deal with your robes.”
“Did you do this?” Harry asked. He could feel himself smiling as he looked about the gaily-decorated room.
He kept worrying that he would say something embarrassing without thinking — perhaps how distracting he found Draco’s fingers as he stroked them along the edge of his desk while deep in thought, or how he longed to run his fingers through Draco’s long hair when the other man would let it out of his bun before remaking it. It was all a lot to handle, and the mundanity of the work never served to distract him for very long.
“Just an idea,” Harry says. He knows he’s being cagey. “Indulge me?”
“Turns out she’s Ginny’s anonymous girlfriend,” Ron said with a shrug.
Harry tentatively cast a
Draco rolled his eyes and performed a cleaning spell on his mug before he handed it over. “The ways I debase myself around you simply boggle the mind,” he said.
out there walking free because—”
“You’re insane!” Potter hissed. “Your priorities are completely backwards. I don’t even know why I’m listening to you.”
Draco turned his whole body to watch this time, and once again Potter was greeted by an expanse of darkness behind the door where a corridor should be. This time, as Draco watched, the darkness appeared to flow past him, slowly but surely engulfing walls, ceiling and floor as Potter looked around himself in confusion.
“So, you and Pansy then?” Harry found himself saying to Ginny. She was standing on the pitch sidelines yelling suggestions at the players in the air; he had joined her and they watched the sky, side by side.
“Or maybe you should test out this wand you care so much about,” Harry says, feeling reckless. “Maybe you should see if you can maintain an
“Far, far too long,” he says, and then Draco’s hand is in his hair, sliding along his scalp torturously slowly. Harry can barely think; his entire existence has dwindled to the sensation of Draco’s long, slender fingers burrowing through his hair, dragging along his scalp. Harry feels Draco’s other hand against his bun, and then that same hand is undoing it and allowing Harry’s hair to cascade down his hyper-sensitive neck.
“His head was laying next to his computery thingy,” Weasley offered. “That thing with all the letters on it; I can never remember the names. I don’t use the things myself. George is keen to hook us up to this new WixNet thing, but we’ve got along fine by owl post as long as I’ve been alive. Don’t see what the fuss is all about, really.”
“But then there was
Molly’s head appeared around the doorway to the kitchen. “Harry!” she cried. “I was so worried about you!” She bustled out, wiping her hands on her apron before giving him a big hug.
Malfoy tsked. “Everybody’s a critic,” he said. Harry felt his gaze start to dip down towards his spinning wheel, but Malfoy also noticed. “Ah, ah,” he said, waggling a finger at Harry. “That’s a penalty. I get to ask the next question as well.”
” He ostentatiously opened it to the first page and began to read, then looked up and caught Draco’s gaze. “Don’t watch me,” he said. “It makes it hard to focus, knowing that you’re just standing there staring at me.”
“Those children will be so disappointed this year,” Draco said drily. “What a monster I am for depriving them of this experience.”
“I may have come in a little early and spruced things up a bit,” Draco said, sounding pleased.
Something about the moment felt off to Draco. Yes, Potter and Weasley
Harry chuckled nervously. “I’m trying a new strategy,” he said. “Embrace the chaos. Don’t worry though; none of this is important. Draco ensures the chaos is prioritized appropriately.”
“Put you
“What are you distracting me for?” Malfoy asks, sounding annoyed. Harry loves that tone of voice, and he loves how easy it is to draw it out of Malfoy.
Malfoy paused the motion of his wheel, allowing it to spin down. “How does it feel to you? When you’re just starting your bowl?”
“I’m quite calm!” Harry realized as he said it that he was raising his voice, but it was only because the volume level in the Leaky was getting unbearably loud. He tried to tone it down a bit. “I am! I was just taken by surprise, that’s all.”
Harry and Draco continued to stare at each other for another moment. Harry broke first.
“Yes, yes, go ahead, Potter,” Draco said drily. “Put your wholesome boy hero status to good use for once. I’ll remain here in the document mines.”
Harry spent the next few hours at his desk, attempting to be productive. It wasn’t that he was
Harry interpreted that as granting him a completely free hand. For the remainder of the afternoon, every time he finished rewriting a piece of trial evidence he rewarded himself by adding one new decoration on his side of the room. He spruced up his chair with colourful ribbons; he draped holly around his desk; he spent longer than he really should have conjuring an intricate wreath to hang on the back of their door. Meanwhile, the pile of completed papers next to him grew ever so slightly taller. Far too slowly for comfort, really.
“Haven’t been…” Potter scowled. “Is that some kind of joke? She’s on her way over right now.”
“Well, there’s always the falling ones,” Harry said, sounding doubtful.
“Very well,” Malfoy said, and to Harry’s disappointment he abruptly pushed his chair back and stood up. He walked around the side of their desks and out of Harry’s field of view. “Eyes forward, Potter,” Malfoy said from behind him when Harry attempted to crane his neck to see where he was. “You should probably look at your clay for this next part, anyways. Now, you were just about to tell me some deep and dark secret about how you came to be in the class.”
There were only a couple of free ones left. Harry sneaked a look at the other students as he sat down on a stool; on his left was an Asian woman that Harry guessed was somewhere in her forties, while on the other side was a dark-haired man who looked about Harry’s age. In front of him was a short, small table, just large enough to hold a bowl of water and a basin that contained the wheel. Harry assumed this would help contain any messes as well.
Harry licks his dry lips. Malfoy looking at him like that is doing things to him, and he isn’t looking forward to the next couple of hours. Well, rationally, part of him is dreading it, but there’s a significant portion of his brain which is rubbing its hands together in anticipation.
“But if you don’t try the same dish from all the different restaurants, how will you know which one is your favourite?” Draco persisted.
“Hello!” He was greeted by a brown-haired woman wearing a smock covered in streaks of something grey. She straightened from where she was arranging one of the final desks in the circle. “Are you here for the beginner pottery class?”
to do those things remains.
It was Draco who broke eye contact first and resumed putting on his coat, and Harry let out a breath. Draco had a direct and penetrating gaze; they had deployed it to good use when questioning suspects in the past, but Harry had never truly been the subject of it before. He fiddled with his program while he waited for the crowd next to him to thin out, scanning the words in it without really taking in anything.
As they drew near the makeshift pitch, Harry saw the rest of the regular Christmas crowd. They were evenly split: some were flitting about in the air, trading playful insults and passing the quaffle lackadaisically, while the rest were standing around chatting and occasionally calling out suggestions to the players. He spotted Andromeda standing with Hermione, both of them ignoring the game completely as they talked, while Teddy stood next to them with a huge smile on his face as he tracked the players that flew overhead.
He couldn’t stand it. “Fine,” Harry snapped. “What advice would you give me if I were to ask for some advice?”
“What do you want, Harry?” Draco breathes. His pupils are dilated, and Harry hates that he still can’t look away.
“They definitely caught someone,” Draco said thoughtfully. “It only took a few days in the end.”
“Go ahead,” Malfoy said easily, still not looking at him. Harry was pretty sure he was smiling, probably because he took twisted pleasure in making Harry’s life harder.
“No,” Harry said. “Nothing really… it didn’t really work. There wasn’t anything worth saving.”
A week later, Draco rounded a corner in Diagon Alley and tripped face first over Harry Potter’s terrible professor shoes.
your goal all along.”
“You should say something,” Harry says frantically. “I need a distraction.”
The hairs on the back of Draco’s neck stood up. “Every professor gets an office,” he said slowly. “And you’re the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor.”
“What?” he asked, too quickly, too loudly.
Baffled, Harry stood and let Malfoy take over his wheel. Malfoy set it spinning and looked at the clay for a moment, before slowly reaching out and grazing one finger along its edge. As Harry watched, the shape of the clay slowly refined, gradually becoming rounder the longer Malfoy continued to exert small pressures against the spinning blob.
“Ok,” Harry finally says. He can see Draco perk up out of the corner of his eye, because even when he’s trying to focus his attention completely on the wand, he can’t stop looking at the other man. He takes a deep breath, steeling himself. “This is the final step,” he continues. “And you’re going to need to really, er. Turn up your power. As it were. Otherwise the wand might still not work right for you.”
Draco raised an eyebrow but kept silent.
Potter’s brow furrowed in concentration. “I was…” he began. “Checking my wixmail? That’s all, just reading and answering messages on my computer.”
Harry stared at the perfectly shaped and centred proto-bowl. He felt like a child being handed a delicate and beautiful piece of glassware, and it made him nervous. Sitting down in the chair, he started the wheel once more and resolved that this time,
Draco snorted. “Yes, I am sure to succeed where many of the best theologians are unable to agree. I admire your confidence in me, Potter.”
In any case, to Draco’s relief they arrived outside the library without further mishap. He felt like he deserved that win; not only had Potter turned out to be more resistant to Draco’s attempts to steer the dream than he’d anticipated, but there was also the mysterious cloud pillaging Potter’s memories. If they escaped this dream intact, it could make for a compelling paper in the mind-magic research community.
Draco’s offer of starting an hour later from the night before no longer felt as generous when Harry dragged himself to the office at half nine in the morning. He hadn’t made any effort to decorate Grimmauld Place in a festive way; it didn’t seem worthwhile when the celebrations always took place at The Burrow every year. He regretted that choice as he woke up on Christmas morning knowing that he had yet another full day at the office ahead of him. In any other year, he would be gathering up his presents and Flooing over to the Weasleys in time for a riotous breakfast with all his friends and family. Instead, he found himself scarfing down a quick toast and tea in his kitchen before heading into headquarters as if it were any other day. Harry found himself grumbling as he took the lift to the Auror floor of the MLE building; he did not look forward to continuing to push through stacks of papers today.
It was 4 pm on the 22nd of December, and Harry was, against all odds, almost feeling bored. He amused himself by leaning back in his chair as far as it would go, seeing how long he could remain balanced on a single leg, making minute adjustments with his feet that were still propped on his desk. Yes, he supposed he could still make headway on the papers scattered around his feet, half piled, half free-range, but he had told Robards the truth: everything remaining
“Ok,” Draco says, a bit uncertainly. “What are you saying, exactly?”
been married, back in their early twenties, but they’d also gone through a divorce only five years ago. While it wasn’t unheard of for people’s dreams to regress to earlier parts of their lives, integrating older memories, it still seemed odd.
Malfoy licks his lips. “Is something going to happen?” he asks nervously.
Potter raised his head out of his hands and looked at him nervously. “…Really?” he finally asked.
Malfoy breaks eye contact, and the moment passes like a cloud across the sun. “Oh,” he says again. “Right.” He straightens his shirt unnecessarily, still looking at the wall next to Harry's head. “So, two days then?”
Draco felt it begin in Potter’s thighs first, as they clenched around his chest. Draco was as hard as he’d ever been; he thought he might actually be in danger of coming, too.
“How did we get here, anyways?” Potter asked, looking around them. “You can’t Apparate inside Hogwarts. Hermione tells me that all the time.”
Potter flipped another page and appeared to skim it, before his whole body shuddered and he slammed the book shut. “What the fuck is this?” he asked uncertainly. “I’m not even sure I can tell you what’s on the page, but it’s doing
touched by Potter’s faith that he would be able to save them. He nodded brusquely. “That’s right,” he said. “Let me know when you’re finished.”
“Well,” Draco eventually said once he finished laughing. “I don’t suppose anybody’s looking good coming out of this one.”
Draco eyed him doubtfully. “Are you sure about this, Potter?” he asked. “This isn’t exactly the optimal time for experimentation.”
Draco’s gaze dipped, and Harry could swear Draco glanced towards his lips, which were suddenly dry. He licked them, then Draco’s eyes met his once more. There was something there, Harry found himself thinking. All of a sudden, Draco’s mouth was on his, and Draco cast aside the wands he was holding to grab a handful of Harry’s robes instead.
“Ok, bowl time,” he muttered to himself. He would make a few silly things and bring them to show Healer Tran at their next session, and then they’d spend some time talking about how it was such a productive activity and how relaxed he was now. Then she’d sign off on him returning to duty and he could get on with his life again. He was going to ace the next therapy session, he decided.
When all remnants of the day’s trials have been washed down the drain, Draco replaces the soap in the dish and wraps his arms around Harry once again, placing his face against Harry’s neck. “Come on,” he says into it, quietly. “Let's go to bed.”
Draco stopped abruptly in the doorway as his eyes were drawn to the patient lying in the bed. It was unmistakably Harry Potter, and Draco felt his stomach lurch, but his professional training kicked in immediately.
When they finally resurfaced, Harry was breathing hard. “Ok, wow,” he said, and Draco chuckled.
“You put on a rowdy Christmas panto for the children in St. Mungo’s.”
“Tell me, Potter,” he said intently. “What is the real reason that you needed to attend the class?”
Malfoy turned to look at him. “I’ve been thinking…” he began, a bit cautiously. “There’s this branch of Muggle therapy—it’s called art therapy. It might be nice to get a degree in that.”
Harry sat back down in the chair and gave it a test spin. “It’s not there?” he hazarded.
“That jealousy could trigger your issues with your wand.” He bears down with the chisel, causing a curve to appear starting at the midpoint of the wand, helping it narrow towards the end. Unfortunately at that moment Malfoy lays a hand on Harry’s back, and all thoughts of artistry and aesthetics fly out the window. Harry's eyes widen; his nostrils flare as he hyperventilates through them, but otherwise he is completely still.
“Why are you really assisting with the class?” Harry asked as he carefully resumed deepening the indentation in his clay. “And don’t give me that pat answer about ‘somebody needed to do it.’ I just want to understand why.”
watching seizures,” Harry says angrily, and it’s the first thing he’s said that doesn’t come out toneless or sad. “I hate when
Harry shrugged. “Today didn’t feel like a Pad Thai day,” he said, opening up the container and letting the smells waft around him. “It’s fun to explore the menu.”
Just to confirm, he circled the church, first checking that he wasn’t being observed. He didn’t want to be reported for suspicious activity around a Muggle religious building. The locator spell was unquestionably pointing him towards the church, insistently tugging him towards the front doors. Harry wondered if he should just wait outside for the service to end, but the night was only getting colder, and his initial warming charm was already starting to fail. He nervously approached the heavy wooden doors and pulled one open just enough to see inside.
“You told me to!”
The moment stretched out for too long. “My what?” Teddy asked, impatience beginning to overwhelm his caution around strangers.
Nothing in Draco’s life was ever easy, he decided. Even enjoying a dream romp with an attractive childhood nemesis turned out to have life-or-death consequences attached to it. “Your problem, Potter,” Draco began, “is that you think too much.” He reached out and unbuttoned Potter’s trousers, then glanced up to confirm that the other man was watching his actions. “May I?” he asked, shimmying further down the bed underneath Potter until his head was just about level with Potter’s crotch. He palmed Potter’s hard cock through his pants. “I think I can help with that.”
Potter stood up to pull a shirt over his head, and Draco told himself that he wasn’t disappointed by this development. “People tell me things,” Potter said, waving the question away. “They say you’re a very good Healer. I have to say, those work robes suit you very well. It’s a very…
Draco turned back to Potter’s desk and abandoned chair, but the office
Malfoy casts the levitation charm once again and the stool begins to hover without any incident; Harry barely even waits before baiting Malfoy again. “You weren’t even that good, that night at the club,” he says. “It was really a forgettable experience.”
“Um,” Harry said, his heart suddenly beating faster. He fought against the desire to look down and stared at Malfoy instead, trying to remember how to blink. “Sure, ok.” The weight of Malfoy’s fingers on his wrist vanished as quickly as it had arrived, but the sensation lingered. He slowly began to move his hands back towards his wheel; the distance they had to cover suddenly felt vast without any ability to see where he was moving them.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “So eloquent, Potter,” he said. “No wonder you’re in such demand as a public speaker.”
“Your hair,” Harry says. He feels like he’s trying to convince himself, as he finds himself running his fingers up along the shaved part of Draco’s head. Draco purrs as Harry’s hypersensitive palm makes contact with the short, bristly hairs, and Harry’s knees just about give way at the sensation. He forces his hand to continue up into the longer hair on top of Draco’s head.
“Er.” Harry stared at his clay, completely caught off guard. It went round and round on the wheel with a repetitive, hypnotizing motion. “It’s not really that kind of job, is it?” he finally asked. “So it doesn’t really matter if I enjoy it or not. Someone has to do it.”
Harry chewed his food morosely, trying to come up with reasons to break the silence that didn’t seem desperate or weird, but he couldn’t think of anything. It shouldn’t have to end like this, he thought. Like two strangers who happened to share an office and politely traded food. He wondered what had changed since the previous day, but found the prospect of asking far too daunting. Much better to simply get on with the work and try to lose himself in it for a while.
“Happy Christmas, Harry!” Hermione said with a smile. “I'm so glad you could make it.”
“That’s twisted, that is,” Weasley said, sounding shocked.
that sent Harry’s wand sailing into Draco’s free hand.
were there.”
“Now we wait for it to dry,” Harry says, trying to keep his voice steady. His hands are clenched on the edge of the table, knuckles whitening with the effort to keep them there.
“I’ve always seen the Aurors as a stepping stone,” Draco said gently. “A foot in the Ministry door, as it were. I’m sorry, Harry. If it’s any consolation, partnering with you has been… much better than I feared.”
“Malfoy,” Potter said, and the sudden dread in his voice made Draco stop and look closely at him. “It’s here. The cloud.”
Harry felt lightheaded all of a sudden. “I just think that hypocrisy—” he began, but Draco interrupted him by kissing him firmly once more.
“Oh, well, that’s easy enough,” Draco said. “Nobody else was doing it.”
“Good,” Ginny declared, as if that settled the matter. “Now, spill the details on Malfoy. I’m not the only one keeping secrets, clearly.” She grinned at him wolfishly.
Potter closed his eyes, apparently trying to reconstruct the scene. “There were several student queries about the latest assignment… then there was the message to all the faculty about scheduling exams… and there was the leak about the upcoming Firebolt, but the details were in the attachment… oh. Bollocks.”
Draco awakes to the sound of the floo spitting somebody out into the living room. He looks around him blearily; the room is still quite dark and he is damp with sweat, and he feels a fleeting sense of loss as the knowledge of whatever he was dreaming about evaporates. He listens for the sound of footsteps making their way towards the staircase to the upper level, and yes—he recognizes the sound of Harry’s tread on the steps, making his way to the bathroom. Harry likes to have a shower when he returns from St. Mungo’s; despite the protective charms they use, and their Healer robes with repellant fabrics, he says it helps him relax at home to know he’s washed everything off himself, and it’s a chance to decompress after a shift.
“Is it because you’re a prat?” Harry asks. He’s enjoying turning the screws a little bit, out of spite.
Harry looked over at him, feeling conflicted. “You’re just going to stay here and keep working?” he asked.
It sounded like a rhetorical question, but Harry felt a bit punch drunk after his confession. “The way your hands feel like a flobberworm sneezed all over them?” he asked.
“Intimidate?” Harry asked, wrongfooted. “I’m not—I’m just here for the class! I had no idea you’d be here.”
“As far as advice goes, I have to say this is pretty shit so far,” Harry retorted.
“It’s a simple question, really,” Malfoy continued evenly. “Does being an Auror bring you joy? Or any pleasure at all?”
“Do you always avoid magic when creating these wands?” Draco asks. He sounds puzzled.
Harry was in the middle of watching a memory of the stakeout that finally led to the capture of the Diagon Alley thief when he felt a hand shake his shoulder. He seized the opportunity to return to the world outside the pensieve, and brought his face out of the swirling liquid to find Draco holding on to him.
Harry was two beers in, sitting in a booth with Ron and Hermione at the Leaky Cauldron, and finally feeling like he could unwind a bit. He’d left Tran’s office earlier that afternoon with the pottery class information folded up in his pocket, and his thoughts had kept returning to their conversation ever since.
“Sometimes students feel like everybody is watching them,” Malfoy said abruptly. It was another short break in the class, and they were once again standing outside against the wall in the semi-darkness. Harry glanced over at him, but Malfoy was still looking straight ahead, seemingly ignoring him. “That kind of pressure can make learning something new… difficult.”
?” Harry asked. “If you insist!” He turned the small boy over until his head was dangling just about the ground while Harry kept a firm grip on his ankles.
“Harry,” Draco murmured, leaning toward him. “Please stop talking.”
“Is that your question?” Harry replied, raising his eyebrows meaningfully.
“And how will you do that?” Draco asks. Harry can hear him moving closer, but it’s easier to think now than it used to be, as if Draco’s actually more interested in the process. Maybe reading the book really did help somehow.
Draco chuckled drily. “You’re right,” he said. He took a deep breath, then: “This is my last case that we’ll work on together. I’m leaving the Aurors.”
“Yeah, who’d ever think that?” Ron asked. “What a loon. She obviously doesn’t listen to you on pub nights.”
“Hmph,” was all Draco had said, turning back to his paperwork, and Harry couldn't help but smile. Draco and Robards had a lot in common sometimes - they both acted like acknowledging a good thing might cause it to fall apart.
Harry tipped forward in his chair out of surprise. “Wait, what? Do you actually perform ancient Druidic rites for Christmas? Is this another one of those pureblood things?”
Draco looked intently at Potter’s face. The biggest risk at this point was the effects of the memory loss. Had his attempt to reconstitute Potter’s memories in the heat of the moment been effective? Whatever that dark cloud had been, they had to hope that it had been disarmed by Harry’s subconscious defences upon waking.
going on, then, Malfoy?” he asked, and it came out low and a bit dangerous. “I know you’re keeping secrets from me. Tell me what’s happening, or I’m leaving.”
“Fuck,” Potter said, squeezing his eyes shut, then opening them again as if he couldn’t bear not to look at Draco while this happened. “Fuck me.” Another long blink, before his eyes popped open again with a sudden look of concern. “But wait, you didn’t get to—”
“You did nothing wrong,” Malfoy says. “I shouldn’t have gone home with you. That’s my mistake.”
"Are you sure about this one, Potter?” Draco asked, breaking the silence for the first time in a while. “BNG for “buying”? I’m looking at a document that is ostensibly an arrest report, and I don’t think that really fits.”
“I mean…” Harry looked at Draco dubiously. “Yeah, it’s almost Christmas?”
Draco interrupted his pacing to wheel around and check on Potter; he couldn’t help himself. “Have you—” He caught himself before he asked anything too leading. “Do you have any questions?”
would have done,” he said. “I like to think that I've moved on since then, but sometimes it’s hard to outgrow old habits.”
Draco huffed and threw himself back into his own chair. “Ok, so we were investigating it back in...July, right?”
Shaking his head, he went inside and collected his belongings that sat next to his wheel. Malfoy was there, standing beside one of the other students and giving advice as something that could be a bowl took shape in front of them. Harry could feel the other man’s gaze on his back as he approached the instructor.
Malfoy just took another drag on his cigarette, and Harry unabashedly watched him do it. He blew out a cloud of smoke pensively as the silence continued to stretch, exposing the curve of his neck as he leaned his head backwards. Harry couldn’t take his eyes off of it.
Draco had the sinking feeling that whatever that spreading cloud of darkness was, it was actively feeding off Potter’s memories. If that was true, then Potter’s ill-timed nap was almost certainly related; memory modification turned out to be much easier while the victim was asleep, with only their subconscious mind as the last line of defence.
Still gazing at him warily, Malfoy reaches up and plucks one of his long, pale hairs, grimacing as it comes free. He reaches out and passes it to Harry, who inserts it into the test wand and replaces the panel before holding out the device to Malfoy.
The evidence is inconclusive by the time they’ve made their way through most of the wand box, but Malfoy has yet to find a wand that allows him to maintain the hovering charm for more than a couple minutes. Harry tells himself that if the problem
“What are you doing?” Malfoy asked warily.
The next twenty minutes passed in a blur as Harry found a rhythm. He had the cheat sheet that Draco had made for quickly decoding the intern’s shorthand, and he no longer allowed himself to get distracted by how pretty the lettering on the page was. He was able to make good progress on his stack of papers, but he knew he was in trouble when he looked up and saw Draco already emptying his second-to-last desk drawer. Draco was definitely going to finish first if they both kept up their current rate of progress.
Fleur had been happy to talk about her history with wands; apparently her parents had commissioned a custom wand for her in order to avoid her wand core interfering with her magical core. It was this custom wand that was making Harry anxious; after Fleur described how the wand itself had to be crafted under the influence of the Veela’s pull, Hermione had noticed Harry’s expression and made him tell her everything.
Draco hears the bathroom door close, and listens for the sound of the shower turning on. He casts a tempus charm, wincing as it informs him that it’s just gone 3 o’clock. Harry’s home a full 10 hours later; they must really have needed his help in the end. Tomorrow’s going to be bad, since Harry is still expected to start his regular shift in five hours. Draco pulls back one of the blankets on the bed since Harry always runs hot at night, then flips his pillow over and lays there as the pipes in the house make their familiar gurgling sound. It probably wouldn’t take much to go back to sleep at this point; he would just have to turn his brain back off and let his tiredness overtake him once more. On the other hand, it would be nice to wait for Harry's comforting presence beside him in bed. Harry's an efficient shower-taker, unlike Draco’s self-indulgent, luxurious affairs, so it shouldn’t be too long before Harry joins him. He stares at the ceiling, listening to the sound of running water and willing himself to stay awake for a few more minutes.
Harry laughed. “I’m not a food critic,” he said. “I don’t need an objective, logical rating system for when I get hungry. I just like a bit of variety.”
Harry eventually returned with Thai food from the new restaurant a couple streets over that Draco had mentioned enjoying. As he took his coat off, he could see the moment when Draco was drawn out of his focused state by the smell of Harry’s lunch.
“It’s not
Hermione pursed her lips consideringly but chose not to press the point. “If you say so,” she said. “Come on, the others will be mad if I monopolise you and you’re only here for a little while."
“You tell me,” Harry gasps, then he hits the switch for the lathe and flings himself off of the stool, away from Malfoy’s burning touch, and over to his chisels once more. He replaces the large one on its mount before turning to face Malfoy. “I’m going to need another hair,” he says. He tries to look anywhere else in the room, but his gaze keeps being dragged back to Malfoy’s. It’s far, far too much for him to handle.
Draco was left speechless for a long moment as Potter busied himself with more useless shifting of papers. The audacity of Potter’s dream-brain to insist that Draco’s son would be a Gryffindor named Albus Severus… to be fair, Draco wouldn’t have minded naming a child of his after his godfather, but really, this was going too far.
Malfoy snorted. “You could at least
know, Ginny’s new girlfriend is coming to Christmas, and it just feels… I don’t know. Seems like it might be awkward.”
?” Weasley yelped. “What was wrong with him?”
“Yes, well, I felt bad that I got to have my Christmas tradition last night, but you’re stuck here with me and don’t get yours. So. Happy Christmas.” Draco flashed him an apologetic smile, then turned back to his work.
Somehow that appeared to assuage Potter’s concerns. He bit his lip as he watched Draco wanking him, his fingers a thin, pale blur as they moved against the dark skin of Potter’s cock. His breathing was getting more erratic, his face flushed, and Draco realized that yes, he truly wanted this. He wanted nothing more than to feel Potter come apart over him, under Draco’s control.
Ginny cocked her head. “It’s true you’re off the Aurors, then?”
“Thank Merlin,” Weasley said from behind him.
“Wait, are we going into the restricted section?” Potter asked. He sounded excited at the prospect; Draco rolled his eyes. Typical of the man, really. He would take any opportunity to break a rule he could get. “You’re just planning to walk right in?”
Draco smoothed down the sides of his coat. It was probably unnecessary, given how thick it was, but it made him feel better. “I knew it,” he said. “You were always a rule-breaking terror. Don’t know how the press continues to overlook it.”
Having no idea where they were going, Harry allowed Draco to lead. They walked in companionable silence down the street, past the alley where Harry had first arrived, before Harry felt compelled to say
“Oh, that’s right,” Draco said. “He had the most elegant quillmanship, and he wrote so slowly as a result.”
Harry felt the tips of his fingers make contact with the clay once more. He was still only half-expecting it, but at least this time he kept himself still. “That’s a crap answer and you know it,” he said, but part of his attention still lay with his fingers. He moved his hands along the sides of the ball of clay, getting familiar with its dimensions and the shape of it.
Harry sighed, glancing at his small stack of forensic reports that he still needed to finish. “Yeah, I think you’re better at this than I am,” he said.
“Usually I’m alone around this time. Everyone else is busy with their families. I kind of like having the company, even if the circumstances are total rubbish.”
“I’m not here with—” Harry glanced around; he didn’t really want to break the statute of secrecy by accident. “You know, work. This is unrelated to that.”
triggered by Harry’s little barbs then he’s actually helping them avoid a false negative. Really, he’s doing Malfoy a favour.
“The rest of the ministry is closed down,” Draco reminded him. “We already established this when we talked to that harpy down in Evidence.”
When Harry arrived at the office on the day following Christmas, everything felt a bit off. He found that the day passed with aggravating slowness. The Christmas decorations had been removed; clearly, Draco was one of those people who believed that all Christmas spirits must be exorcised as soon as the holiday was officially past. Harry caught himself sneaking peeks at Draco throughout the morning, trying to memorise the mannerisms that would soon be gone from his life.
“I already do,” Malfoy says, his voice cracking.
“That’s perfect,” Draco said, joining Harry on the bed. He knelt just behind him, not quite touching any part of the other man’s body. He reached out and trailed a finger down Potter’s neck, tracing the line of a shoulder blade. Potter’s breath caught, and his body responded to the touch, arching towards it.
Harry headbutts him gently. “Berk,” he says, and it comes out fondly but he’s also sniffling a bit again.
They made their way over to the bed, Draco trying not to let on how nervous he suddenly felt. He told himself that it shouldn’t feel any different than picking someone up at a club. It was a transaction; they both knew what they were getting out of this. That Draco had always felt a certain attraction to Potter shouldn’t make a difference. If anything, it should have made the whole thing that much better.
Draco gave Potter a lascivious smile, refusing to break eye contact as he moved his mouth steadily closer to the head of Potter’s cock. The other man’s breath quickened until Draco was vaguely concerned that he might hyperventilate. Draco darted out his tongue, licking just under the tip and around the glans. Potter groaned, long and drawn out.
“I honestly barely even remember the case,” Harry added helpfully. “Who did we catch in the end?”
“But...” Potter said, looking surprised. “Then I can’t reach you.”
wait until the new year. Draco was very careful about keeping anything urgent off of Harry’s desk, so by process of elimination anything on Harry’s desk could not be urgent. It turned out to be a very effective system.
“Fine,” Draco grumbled. “Stay there. I’m coming up to join you.”
“How did you end up assisting with a beginner pottery class?” Harry asked. It was the first thing that came to mind, and he seized upon it.
“Now, my second question, Potter,” Malfoy continued. “Which Quidditch team will take the cup this year and why will it be Puddlemere United?”
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. “Potter, where would you expect to find the paperwork for that case?”
“My aunt decided Teddy looked cold and took him inside, so I thought I’d come find you,” Draco said, which didn’t answer the question
Harry swallowed. Draco was looming over him, radiating control, and it was extremely distracting. “Make me,” he said recklessly.
“Come on,” Harry whispered to Draco, who looked slightly alarmed. “Let’s find the others.”
Draco stepped closer. “Get on the bed and face away from me,” he said. It came out huskily.
They were in a room that Draco had to assume was the Gryffindor common room this time. He had no personal experience with the other houses’ common rooms, of course, but this one featured an abundance of sofas and an enormous portrait of Godric Gryffindor on the wall above the fireplace, so Draco was pretty confident in his guess. The fireplace wasn’t actually putting out any warmth, despite how close Draco found himself standing to it; it was just one more unimportant detail to the dreamer.
with Professor Hooch. There was also an entry for
“Oh,” Harry said. “Yeah, I could see that.”
With a yawn, Draco pushes back the covers and pads down the hallway to the closed bathroom door. The shower is still the only sound he can hear, and Draco has visions of Harry asleep, or maybe even passed out under the falling water. He knocks on the door and calls “Harry?” quietly. There’s no response.
“Sometimes,” Draco allowed. “However, your… situation was not out of my comfort zone.”
while I suck you off. You could have your way with me.”
“Nice one, Malfoy,” Ron said. Having returned to his desk and taken up his paperwork again, Draco only hummed noncommittally. “Listen, Harry, I know you’ve got all this work to prepare for the trial, but Mum keeps fretting over you. Do you think you could just pop by for a quick visit or something? She keeps looking over at your presents and sighing, and saying things like ‘I hope that poor boy is alright,’ and it’s a bit much to take, honestly. It’s bringing the whole mood down.”
Hermione gave him a sympathetic look. “We know this is difficult for you, but she may have a point. This hasn’t really been much of a break for you, has it?”
“I was early,” Harry retorted. “I didn’t realize you were already inside.” He pulled the handle towards him, and Malfoy reluctantly released his grip on it, allowing the door to swing open. Harry caught a glimpse of a nicely-fitted collared shirt and jeans beneath the other man’s apron, and he briefly wondered if he was underdressed for the occasion.
Malfoy’s hand darted out, and he laid it lightly on Harry’s wrist before Harry could snatch his hand back from the wheel. “Allow your fingers to explore,” he said intently. “Get to know the shape of the clay before you start working it.”
Just like that, the old Malfoy is back. He gives Harry a smirk. “No promises,” he says, and Harry’s knuckles turn white with how tightly he grips the desk behind him.
When Harry reached the office at 8:15 am on December 24th, Draco was already sitting at his desk looking productive and alert.
“Well,” Draco said, quite at a loss for words at this new development. “That’s quite alright. Here I am, anyways.” He wrenched his eyes up to Potter’s face, away from that indecently muscled abdomen and the small thatch of hair peeking out— “You wanted to talk about something?” he hazarded.
It began as a game to annoy Draco. When Harry was feeling overwhelmed by the paperwork, he would take a small break and bide his time until Draco was deep in concentration. Then he would introduce some new magical Christmas decoration around them, as carefully and silently as he could.
“Hmm,” he said, and it was enough to make Weasley nervous.
He’s not quite touching Draco yet, but the
“First time, dear?” the lady with the programs asked.
somewhere different because you have these sessions with your healer, but you could still visit a museum or take a class or something. Just as a change, you know? You could treat this as an opportunity!”
Weasley shrugged helplessly. “Not that he told me about, but also, it’s Hogwarts, you know? Not that anybody would intentionally curse a professor, but there’s a lot of magic that goes on there.”
as much as he did. It showed in his results. No other Auror had reached his rate of closed cases, let alone sustained it like he had. And yes, these days he worked alone, often as not, because whoever they assigned him as a partner could never keep up, and could Harry really be expected to babysit someone in the field? He didn’t dare split his attention to keep somebody else alive. He put himself in danger all the time; that was an acceptable risk—it came with the job. The latest partner they’d tried to saddle him with hadn’t even lasted a month before she demanded to be reassigned; he’d heard she’d threatened to quit.
look.”
“And there’s a regulation against it, yes,” Draco admitted, smiling.
Taking matters into his own hands, when Draco wasn’t looking Harry cast a wordless levitation charm on the box that his partner was using to store his belongings. Harry quickly guided the box over to his own desk and hid it in the space where his legs would typically go. This forced him to sit further back from his desk than he usually would, but that was a small price to pay for victory. He resumed his paperwork, listening impatiently for Draco to notice the missing box.
Harry chuckled as he accepted the mug and poured another measure into it. He would definitely miss winding Draco up on a daily basis. “Here you go,” he said, handing it back once he was finished.
underground brewer we had to track down,” Harry said. “And Robards was like, ‘This is your top priority!’”
“Merlin,” Malfoy said, sounding vaguely annoyed. “I swear, if you ruin the one activity I enjoy… No, I was
“It’s not like that at all,” Harry continued. “I just need to take some time off and meet with a, er… just someone. We talk, she clears me for duty, and then I’m back to work.”
“Don’t worry, Draco makes sure that I don’t miss meals,” he said with a smile.
Malfoy tosses aside another wand in disgust, this one containing a house elf hair core, and removes another from the nearly empty box, when he suddenly goes still.
“Well, never mind that,” Draco said. Deciding on a new tack, he put on a haughty air. “Come on, I won’t have you lazing about and making me do all the work for our assignment.”
Malfoy held his gaze for another moment. “Whatever you want,” he eventually said, turning away and walking back towards the main studio space. “You’re here as my guest. Don’t trash the space, check with me before you use any of the equipment, and tell me if you're going to use any of the common supplies.”
, exactly, but he did find himself getting distracted more easily than usual. Draco’s decorations still lent the office a comfortably festive atmosphere, and Harry found his gaze drawn inextricably to his partner. His work colleague, he amended, feeling put out. He would catch himself thinking about the feel of Draco’s hand on his arm, or the precise way that Draco nibbled the biscuits he took with his tea. Late in the afternoon, Draco left a mug of tea on Harry's desk. Harry was focusing so intently that he startled when Draco gently placed a hand on his shoulder to get his attention. Harry jumped, banging both of his knees on the underside of the desk at the touch. Draco only gave him an apologetic look and pointed towards the mug of steaming tea.
“Oh,” he says softly, and looks at Harry quickly.
“We must have,” Draco agreed, but he didn’t sound convinced.
“I learned my lesson last year!” Harry replied, leaning back in his chair once more and carefully putting his feet on the desk around the mounds of parchments. “Draco just went down to the archives to file our final summary for the forgery case. Everything else can wait until the new year, I promise.”
“I’m going to start redoing the memory records, all right?” he asked, opening a desk drawer and retrieving the standard issue Pensieve inside of it.
Harry jumped and tried to think about anything except boning. It proved surprisingly difficult, and he silently cursed Ginny’s power of suggestion. “Oh!” he exclaimed nervously. “How long have you been standing there?”
“Oh,” Harry said, surprised. “Come here often, then?”
“Only that I had a great-great uncle who all of a sudden went into seclusion,” Malfoy says, casually, like it’s only mildly interesting. The tension is still there, though, as prominent as ever. “He had a promising career in the Ministry, many high-level connections, everything on the up and up. And then he went and decided to become a recluse and stopped accepting visitors.” His roaming hands still, and he meets Harry’s eyes. It’s electrifying. “The obvious conclusion is that he was afflicted the same way that I am, without prior warning,” he says, and Harry finds himself nodding along. “I won’t have it!” Malfoy is all steel now, the commanding patriarch. His gaze holds Harry’s completely. “I am all that is left of my family, and I will not allow myself to be shunted aside like an embarrassment.”
“Really?” Malfoy asked. He looked surprised but pleased.
“Pottery! That’s great!” Hermione said excitedly. “Ron and I did a few beginner sessions a couple years ago as a date night. You might find that you really enjoy it!”
“If I were, it would appear that I have failed,” Draco pointed out. He tried not to feel smug about Potter’s bewilderment; Potter did tend to bring out unprofessional reactions in him.
“Sure,” Ron said. “I think most of us have bumped into him at some point in the past few years, and you talk about him all the time anyways—”
“Our assignment?” Potter asked, sounding confused. “What assignment?”
“Dunno. I wanted to see if it would work out. I just wanted something that was all mine for a bit, you know?”
Harry had his own emergencies to deal with—he kept tearing chunks out of his rim or collapsing the wall of the bowl when trying to repair the holes, and one time, he even tried to cone up too aggressively and ended up ejecting a bunch of clay right off the wheel. He still refused to raise his hand, however. It was one thing to be non-weird about Malfoy being in the same studio, helping the other students and generally not being a complete arse of a person. It was another thing entirely to contemplate waving him over and explaining that Harry was a complete and utter disaster at novice pottery skills. Harry gritted his teeth and forced himself to concentrate on yet another unblemished solid lump of clay that spun round and round in front of him. He would make a successful bowl if it was the last thing he did.
“Just give me a second,” Harry said. He felt sweat beading on his forehead; there were too many things he was trying to focus on.
Harry was so bored. It was almost time for the second break, and despite the mysterious and very suspicious sudden appearance of Malfoy the class had not actually become significantly more interesting. Harry had honestly tried to work on his bowl, but the whole thing felt a bit hopeless. He kept accidentally creating holes in the bottom, or ruining the outer structure by pulling it towards him unevenly, or coning down off centre and ending up with a piece that was impossible to work with as it flew around the wheel. The teacher said this was normal, but he was sure he could see the judgement in her face when he still had no success after the first hour. He dutifully started again after each failed attempt, pushing the clay back into a ball and starting from scratch, but he noticed that none of the other students seemed to have the same kinds of struggles as he did.
around him, and he felt the hairs on his neck stand up. The lighting was suddenly different; the midday sun wasn’t shining through the window any longer, instead a pink and orange sunset could be seen above the Forbidden Forest. The desk in front of him was suddenly clear, no longer cluttered with papers. Everything resembled the previous scene superficially, but slightly perturbed.
Harry had found himself describing the problem to Hermione the previous night, and she had excitedly flooded him just after midnight. She'd announced that she'd discovered a short chapter in a compendium on magical creatures that described instances of magical core interference for Veelas who used wands. To both Harry and Hermione’s chagrin, that was when Ron had interrupted them to point out that they should ask Fleur if she knew anything.
“It was a big Auror operation,” he says quietly. “Some kind of… bust? An underground potions lab. Lots of spell damage.” He takes a deep breath, shudders a bit, and Draco doesn’t say anything, just lets him keep talking. “They just kept bringing more wounded in… all the people hurt in the raid. We kept patching them up… tried to figure out what was spell damage and what was exploding potions. When that slowed down I helped with the regular patient triage. It was really backed up. Just… stacks of charts everywhere, all these patients waiting to be seen.”
“Yes,” Harry says. Everything feels weird between them now that Harry knows what he has to do. “Well. Come in, then.” He steps back and allows Malfoy to enter the workshop.
Harry’s entire body reacts violently to this notion. “No!” he exclaims, and he reaches back and grips Draco’s arms, keeping him in place.
“And you’re doing so well,” Draco said with a small smile. Potter shivered at the praise, which Draco filed away for future reference. He shuffled closer, placing his legs in between Potter’s, and reached around Potter’s chest with both hands. He ran them tantalizingly slowly from collarbone to midriff, stopping to toy with the other man’s nipples, feeling them start to harden under his touch. Potter leaned back against him, seeking more stimulation of his hyper-sensitive skin the longer that Draco played with it.
“That was it,” Malfoy says, and he looks nervous. “That’s what I’m talking about. Sometimes it’s more extreme than that.”
Melanie gave him a sympathetic smile. “Oh, I know what that’s like. Sometimes you can’t force these things, as much as you’d like to. Just keep at it—I’m sure you’ll have more luck next time!”
It’s not that he didn’t trust that the other Aurors would continue to make headway on their cases in his absence. It just never really felt like anybody else
At least he had Potter’s attention again. “Sorry, what?” Potter asked, looking down at him.
Draco looked at Harry dubiously. “If you had ever cleansed your palette in your life, you would know how ridiculous that sounds,” he said. He kept looking at Harry’s curry, though, and Harry would swear he could see the debate raging inside his head. “Fine,” he said abruptly. “Half my sandwich for some curry. And I’ll take the spring roll, too, since you offered.”
Draco’s presence behind him. He would swear there was a hand hovering just above his head. “Now we just have to join the two parts together around the core,” he says, fighting to get the words out.
By the time it was half-past noon, Harry’s head was a dull ache from looking at old reports. He pushed back from his desk with a sigh, allowing his chair to spin him round in a lazy rotation.
“You could have anything you wanted,” Draco says, voice full of promise, and Harry summons all his will and yanks a couple strands free at once.
“Me and Pansy,” Ginny replied amiably. “I figured it was time to give her the full family experience. She’s holding up remarkably well so far.”
“There’s a class tomorrow evening that I want you to attend,” Tran said, interrupting Harry’s reverie. That was different than normal. She unsteepled her fingers in order to push a piece of paper across her desk. “It’s a pottery class for beginners. Non-magical, but the teacher is a witch.”
to do so is gone. He can remember it, the all-consuming desire to be as close to Draco as possible, give him anything he wanted in exchange for his attention, but now he can observe those feelings from a distance.
“Malfoy?” came a surprised voice. Someone with red hair turned around, and Draco was unsurprised to find Ron Weasley sitting alongside Potter’s bed. “What are you doing here?”
“It could be a fun experiment,” Draco says, and it’s like a switch has been flipped. Harry can feel Draco’s gaze on him again, and he suddenly has to concentrate very hard on turning on the saw and making a precise cut along the length of the wand. It takes longer than is strictly necessary; he’s going slower than usual because he keeps getting distracted imagining Draco moving through him like the saw blade, a quick, neat release, and he’s left breathing hard at the image. He finally reaches the end of the wood and turns the machine off again, and the quiet abruptly feels very loud.
“Potter,” Draco said, and Harry forced himself to meet his partner’s gaze. “What an unexpected surprise.”
Draco eyed Harry, seemingly weighing something. “My mother lives in the Italian countryside,” he eventually said. “ When I visited her three years ago, it was like… it was like she had recreated the life she had here, as closely as possible. Without my father, for obvious reasons, but still. I have no interest in being part of that, not after everything.”
“On your head?” Harry asked, pretending to be perplexed. “You’re very strange, Teddy.”
“Well, hand me some more, and we’ll see if I can finish those as well before you’re done,” Draco said, smirking.
The method that Ollivander taught Harry for wands choosing their wizard really only applies to children; their magic is so unformed and wild that it tends to cause exciting displays during the selection process. Adults, unfortunately, require a process that is much less interesting—Harry makes them cast a familiar, comfortable spell, and if nothing happens they move on to the next wand candidate. Malfoy has the additional issue that sometimes the first cast doesn’t work, so he has to try the spell multiple times.
“Everything all right over here?” Draco asked.
“But…” Malfoy begins, before trailing off. He looks uncertain for once, like his whole world has shifted. “What do I do? And why is this only happening to me now?”
“Er, yeah,” Harry said, remembering his manners. “Fleur, this is Draco. Draco, Fleur. You might remember her from our fourth year.”
made Malfoy dart a glance towards him, for some reason, but he quickly looked away again and scrubbed a hand through his hair. “Merlin,” he said. “I’m just trying to offer a fucking olive branch here. Yes, maybe in a formal class setting surrounded by other students you
“Why can’t I watch?” Malfoy asks, sounding slightly annoyed. Maybe he’s still bristling about the hair thing.
we looking for, anyway?” Potter asked as Draco marched them towards the far corner of the room. “You’re being awfully secretive about this whole assignment.”
“Come on,” Draco breathed, trying to keep his mind on his task. “Back to your reading. You’ve had your fun now.”
Potter’s breathing sped up, and his hips began to move without any assistance from Draco, pistoning his cock in and out of Draco’s mouth. Draco just relaxed his throat and took it; he’d always found it an incredible turn on when a partner let loose on him like this. He tried to assist by swiping his tongue along Potter’s cock as it retreated after each thrust—every time he did so, Potter gave this little grunt that steadily increased Draco’s desire to flip him over and just have his way with him, damn the consequences. Surely there were worse ways to go.
“Was anybody else in the room with you?” Weasley asked.
Draco nodded. “I’m going to check for traces of any curses inside of him,” he said. “It’s a slow process, but please share any other details that might be relevant. Healer Jenkins will act as my scribe.” Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Healer Jenkins scrabble in his robes for a quill. Draco suppressed a sigh as he brought his wand out and began to wave it in circles above Potter’s dormant form on the bed, beginning with his feet. He muttered the incantation for the diagnostic charm under his breath; wisps of bright light drifted down from the tip and landed on Potter’s body, fading away almost immediately. If any of them changed colour before they disappeared, it would mean that they had encountered traces of curse magic in that region.
“Yeah, don’t do that,” he grits out. “It’s really fucking annoying.” He tries really hard not to think about those eyes raking his body, Malfoy’s wiry forearms pinning his body to the mattress.
Harry progressively made the rounds of his chosen family. Percy wished him a productive new year with many opportunities for advancement. George swooped down on a broom to high five him and ask if he was up for some gnome racing later, and Charlie and his boyfriend tried to convince Harry to take a vacation and come visit the Romanian dragon sanctuary they both worked at. Harry spotted Pansy a few times, usually sticking close to Ginny, but by the time he reached them, Pansy had gone back into the house to refill her drink.
“In any case,” Potter continued, seemingly unaware of the confusion he was sowing in Draco’s head, “congratulations on the new job. I’m sure you’ll make a great Healer.” He smiled over at Draco once more. “Sometimes I can’t believe it’s only been a few years since we were pointing wands at each other in these same corridors. It feels like so much has changed.”
“I promise to leave you alone,” Malfoy says nervously. “I’ll do whatever you ask. I’m just… I’m scared of what this means. Please. There’s nobody else I can turn to.”
Harry paused on his way out the door. “Oh, bollocks,” he said. “Are you sure?”
Draco took a deep breath, and it appeared to steady him somewhat. “Do you remember that Diagon Alley thief from the summer?”
Another breath. Draco’s still waiting for the other shoe to drop; so far this sounds like a relatively normal shift, if slightly more chaotic than usual. “There was a lot of pressure to free up beds,” Harry continues, monotone. “Something about it still felt weird, though. I pushed back and ordered some more tests. I went to see other patients again… then the girl started seizing.”
“Robards told us to track down that new brewer,” Harry said slowly. “He said it was vital; he needed our skills in the field, not filling out forms.”
Harry scrubbed a hand across his face. “It made sense at the time,” he said. “I’ll put a question mark next to it, I guess, unless you have a better idea.”
“We should toast your new prospects,” Harry insisted. “Besides, I’m about to go out of my skull if I have to read one more witness report praising the actions of Diagon Alley’s BIA.”
“It’s probably because I was a Death Eater,” Malfoy says calmly, and that takes a bit of the wind out of Harry’s sails.
Draco was already shaking his head. “That didn’t work even when you didn’t realize it was a dream,” he said morosely.
He realized that he hadn’t actually replied to Ginny, and she was giving him a funny look. “What, can’t a man have a quiet drink by himself?” he asked.
“The only reason I’m going along with this idea is that the thought of watching you search through this disaster on your own sounds even worse,” Draco muttered as he came over to join Harry. “That pile’s on my side. Get your own.”
Draco is making chicken jalfrezi when the Patronus arrives.
Maybe it’s just the pleasure of watching Malfoy beg for Harry’s help, acknowledging the power that Harry holds over him and how he fucked up, but Harry’s feeling slightly better about this encounter. Maybe he’ll hear the git out. “Broken how?” Harry asks cautiously.
“Is this… English?” he asked, worried. “I’ve never seen a report like this before.”
Harry sat there, stunned. “You’re— you’re leaving?” he asked. That possibility had never even crossed his mind. This conversation was not going the way he had hoped, or even feared. It was inconceivable.
“Am I distracting you?” Draco asks, far too casually. “I think the wand is coming along nicely.”
“I’m coming in there, alright?” Draco asks, and he waits until he sees Harry’s slow nod, his eyes closed once more as he swipes at them, before he starts removing his pyjamas. Sliding the cubicle door aside, he steps in behind Harry and under the stream of water. It’s practically scalding, much hotter than Draco prefers, and he quickly reaches out to twist the knob that will temper the heat a bit.
Draco frowned. “Yes, well, I notice that my side of our office is noticeably more spirited than your side,” he said.
“What theory was that?” Malfoy asks. The way he says it makes Harry think of tinder, dry leaves that could catch at any moment.
Malfoy apparently noticed his confusion. “The clay’s on the second shelf in there,” he said, pointing at a cupboard against the wall behind him. “And yes, you can use it.”
“Of course she’ll like you,” Harry said. “She’ll give you a chance.”
like you,” Draco said, but he was grinning ferociously. “Giving the appearance of caring about law and order and decency, right up until it benefits you to ignore them all.”
“Tell me,” Potter insisted, moving closer. “I need to know.”
“Potter?” Draco asked, and Harry looked up to find that Draco was looking at him funnily. “Should we end a bit early today and get a start on that first thing tomorrow?”
Draco cursed Potter’s terrible, antagonistic dream brain. “Look more closely. Does anything look out of place?”
“Happy Christmas Teddy!” Harry called, and when the young boy turned around and spotted him, he ran towards them, abandoning his study of the game.
This wasn’t the first time he’d been contrary out of habit, only to have her take him seriously. He didn’t know how he felt about it. “Er,” he said, stalling as he tried to remember things that he liked to do. Some kind of activity where he could at least have some fun while he waited for this stupid administrative leave to be resolved. “Flying?” He hadn’t touched a broom for… years, probably. It wasn’t an efficient way to travel.
“Forgettable?” Malfoy says, huskily. “Then why do you care so much that I left?”
“Wood!” Harry exclaims wildly. “We start with wood!” He lets his instincts guide him as he sorts through the unformed blocks, and his hand stills over a piece of dogwood. It’s one of the hardest varieties of wood, and it resists pressure well. The trees burst into surprising colour in the winter months, yet remain bare for the rest of the year. It feels right.
“Ronald!” Molly said, turning her attention away from Harry and Draco in order to point an accusatory finger. “Don’t you dare touch anything! I’ve counted, so I’ll notice if any go missing!”
He slowly reaches out, placing a hand on the wall next to Draco’s head. Draco darts a nervous glance at it, then meets Harry’s gaze again. He appears confused, possibly even concerned, like he’s searching for something in Harry’s face. Harry summons all his courage and attempts a smoulder for the first time in his life.
A horrifying thought occurred to Harry, and he couldn’t stop himself from glancing quickly towards his own desk. Draco noticed, and a thundercloud passed over his partner’s face.
suddenly an evidence emergency of some kind,” Draco persisted. “What would happen?”
“No time like the present!” Draco declared. “Come on, we need to go collect research materials for our assignment. To the library!”
“And yet,” Malfoy said, sounding triumphant, “you admitted earlier you needed to be here. That implies you were sent. So which is it, hmm?”
Harry paused. Their conversation after the church service was top of his mind, but that really wasn’t something he felt he could share, given Draco’s secrecy around it. “Oh, nothing specific,” he said, trying to deflect. “Just bits here and there. You know how it is. There’s just more there than I think I ever realised.”
Potter gave Draco a weird look. “Divorced,” he said cautiously. “But what’s this all about?”
As Draco was still getting his bearings, Potter himself emerged from a small doorway at the back of the room. He drew up short upon seeing Draco, his face taking on a look of confusion.
Harry’s stomach did something funny. He remembered how it felt to discover Sirius’ connection to his family, and when Sirius had asked if Harry wanted to live with him… He wanted Draco to have the same opportunity that he had.“What do you want to do?” Harry asked gently. “I’m pretty sure she’ll give you a chance."
“Promise you’ll take the class seriously,” Hermione jumped in quickly. “If this is part of your therapy, then it could be really important!”
Draco cradled Potter’s dick in a loose fist, wanking him slowly. “Do you think a blowjob would help your concentration?” he asked, his voice light. “You were doing so well, after all.
“What?” Draco said, taken aback. He glanced at his lunch. “The flavour profile of a green curry is completely different from an egg salad sandwich.”
Malfoy fiddled with a heavy metal lighter as he considered the question. Harry watched his long, delicate fingers flick the lid back and forth across the top. “I needed something to do with my hands,” Malfoy said eventually. “When they took away my wand for that first year… well, let’s say I found it challenging and leave it there.” He waited a moment, before adding, “Also my father absolutely hates it.”
The thing about dreams, in Draco’s experience, was that falling was one of the most reliable triggers to radically change the experience. Sometimes it was enough to wake the dreamer up, but Draco suspected that was unlikely for a magically-induced sleep like Potter’s. Draco had bet that Potter’s dream brain was resilient enough to make sense of the new development and get them the hell away from the library.
“Healer Malfoy,” Draco repeated, trying not to roll his eyes. “I’m the Healer assigned to… Mr. Potter’s case. I specialize in mind-related ailments. Are you the one who brought him in?”
Harry licked his lips. This was where things had started to go wrong in all his previous attempts. “Is this what you want to do with your life?” he asked Malfoy, desperate to keep his mind off of what his hands were doing as he pressed his thumb into the soft clay.
“You should probably check on the wand,” Draco says, and he sounds subdued. Harry checks over his shoulder again and sees Draco has moved back against the wall, arms crossed. Whether it’s the difference of the extra few steps, or the lack of physical contact, or something else entirely, Harry finds it easier to think now.
“We were talking about whether I find Auror work stressful, and she said I need an outlet. Of course the Aurors are stressful—if it’s not, that probably means we’re not doing our jobs well!” He took another drink before continuing. “But you just have to push through it; the outlet is when you close your case. Then there are those glorious thirty seconds before Robards hands you another case when you can feel good knowing you’ve made the world a better place.” Rather than being reassured, Hermione and Ron just looked vaguely concerned instead. Harry suspected that they wouldn’t laugh if he said it was actually more like twenty seconds. Talking about this kind of thing with non-Aurors was hard.
“My casting is inconsistent,” Malfoy says. “Sometimes it’s fine. Sometimes spells will just stop working while I’m focusing on them, or they won’t even cast at all.”
“Do you actually want to return to work?” Tran suddenly asked.
“You knew!” he accused Blaise. “How did it never come up before now?” He turned to look at Pansy, who gazed back at him coolly as she took a drink from her martini glass. “How long has Malfoy been doing this?”
Potter appeared to be lost in thought, however. “In fact, a lot of this feels like a dream, when I stop to think about it,” he mused. “The way we came here instantly from the library. The way the darkness…” He paused for a moment, his brow furrowed. “I’ve seen that dark cloud before,” he said slowly. “In.. an office?
He didn’t give Potter a chance to respond, just started bobbing his head around the tip of Potter’s cock as he continued to stroke the remainder with his fist. This actually appeared to motivate Potter, somehow; he redoubled his efforts, a confused mixture of arousal and concentration visible on his face as he continued to turn pages in the book.
It feels more intimate this time, strangely, as Draco gently soaps Harry’s back and down the lengths of his arms. “It’s all right,” Draco tells him, murmuring it like a charm. “You’re here with me now. I’ve got you.” Harry gives a little shudder as he says it, but he also reaches behind him to clutch Draco’s waist tightly and pull him closer. Overall, Draco feels like his attempt at a reassuring monologue is doing more good than harm, so he continues whispering comforting platitudes as he lathers up the remainder of Harry’s broad backside.
Draco nodded. “I’ve been accepted into the Unspeakables, and I start first thing in the new year.”
Harry looked back over his shoulder at them as he neared the Leaky’s exit—they had shifted to one side of the booth with Ginny in the middle, so she could fit her arms around both of them and they could rest their heads on her broad shoulders. He watched Pansy’s lips move, and the other two laugh in response, quick and delighted. He turned away and walked out into the night before they could catch him staring.
“Oh,” Harry said. “I’m glad to hear that.” He didn’t really know what to say next. After a moment, he felt Ginny’s shoulder knock against his and he looked over at her.
It’s like he’s just taken a breath of clean, fresh air.
“Shut up,” Harry said, his face heating. “I just meant… I don’t know what I was expecting, but it wasn’t that.” Dragging his fingers idly around the clay that he was working, he abruptly realized that there was a reasonable approximation of a bowl taking shape beneath his hands. “Oh!” he exclaimed, taken aback. “This is starting to feel like it might actually work.”
“Up! Up!” he cried through his laughter.
He’s standing so close to Draco, and Harry is slightly shocked to discover that the
Draco had demonstrated that he could apologize when he knew he was in the wrong. But he was proud, and prickly to boot, and Harry now found himself smiling when he recognised the signs that Draco felt aggrieved but realised that others might not share his view. He had discovered recently that he was actually
“We’re all going to try making a bowl to start, but don’t worry too much about the details!” Melanie said cheerfully to the group of slightly overwhelmed students. “Now, back to your wheels and give it a go!”
“I just want to ensure we get a good grade on it,” Draco said absentmindedly. “But we’re looking for a book about…” He paused as he tried to come up with a reasonable lie. “Using memories as potions ingredients?” he finished uncertainly after a moment. It was the best he could come up with on short notice, sadly.
Harry raised his head from his contemplation of his beer glass to find Ginny leaning against the side of his booth. The Leaky Cauldron was hopping; Ron and Hermione had abandoned him a good thirty minutes earlier, saying they didn’t want to keep their babysitter waiting too long, but Harry hadn’t been ready to pack it in for the night. He’d ordered himself another drink and nursed it, watching the other patrons without trying to be obvious about it. He felt jittery, like he was waiting for something to happen. He’d thought about trying to chat someone up, bring them home to distract himself, but honestly, the Leaky was the wrong place for that. He was far, far too recognizable a presence here, and he didn’t really want to attract that kind of attention.
Potter’s blush deepened. “When I have them, I don’t think I ever… you know.” He put his face in his hands.
“Happy Christmas, Molly,” Harry said fondly as he allowed himself to be squeezed tightly. “I brought Draco too. I hope that’s all right. We can’t stay too long, but I couldn’t let him keep working while I got to see all of you.”
Blaise leaned over to take a sniff of Ginny’s beer and then gave her a disappointed face. “You promised you would order something that wasn’t an IPA tonight. How are we ever going to expand your palate?”
“And how’s that working out for you?” Malfoy asked. “Melanie has probably made hundreds of bowls at this point, if not thousands. She has it down to muscle memory by now.” He moved his hands, cupping them on either side of the clay without actually touching it, then adjusted his left thumb and two fingers on his right hand to lightly press at the centre. The clay seemed to melt away beneath his gentle touch. Harry stared, captivated by the way his fingers slowly but inexorably carved out a depression, as the clay yielded to his will.
“Pottery?” Harry snorted, crossing his arms. “You want me to, what, make some nice bowls? A pretty cup? What does this have to do with me going back into the field?” Tran's mouth thinned briefly, and Harry cursed silently. He always did this. He let down his guard and allowed his frustration out, in front of the one person he could not afford to slip up around. He took a breath, plastered a concerned look on his face, then tried for a less confrontational tone. “I’m sorry,” he said pleasantly. “I just don’t see the connection, and I would really rather do what it takes to return to work.” Saving lives, he didn’t say. Rescuing people like
Harry heard footsteps, then the sound of several locks being undone before the door opened. A man stood there, a bit taller than Harry, looking down at him disdainfully.
“How good are you at talking to 5 year olds?” Harry asked as they started walking towards where the game was taking place.
Draco always takes Harry’s estimates around his work with a grain of salt, but he had been buoyed by Harry’s insistence. He likes to make food for Harry, and he’d planned a nice meal for that night. Harry’s Patronus, several hours after he was first called in, does not bode well, though. Draco wanders over to the fridge and pokes halfheartedly through the leftovers; he’s no longer in the mood to follow through with his original plans when Harry won’t be around to enjoy the dish. There’s some pad thai from a while ago that should probably be eaten soon or else binned, so he decants it into a bowl before grabbing his wand off the kitchen island and casting a gradual heating charm over his new dinner. While he waits for it to warm, he collects the in-progress chicken jalfrezi ingredients into some containers and attempts to find the matching lids that will allow him to store them and make another go at dinner tomorrow. The drawer they keep the lids in is a disaster; it looks like Harry’s been rifling through it again in a hurry to bring some food with him to St. Mungo’s.
Under other circumstances, if he weren’t trying to craft a wand under the waxing sex magic of a one night stand that he’s having trouble getting over, Harry might be tempted to lie. At this moment, however, he’s powerless. “I made that up,” he says. Malfoy hisses quietly, and it’s like someone has cast a warming charm on the room. Harry’s palms feel clammy on the chisel. “It was just something to get under your skin. To test my theory.”
“Potter, what do you remember about after you finished eighth year?” Draco asked. He had a terrible suspicion that the answer was about to make his job more difficult.
“Yes, pardon me,” Malfoy said as he rose, stepping to the side as he brushed off his trousers. They were going to be covered in dirt; he’d probably have to resort to a scourgify. As good as chuck them in the bin, given the way the spell would wear on the fabric. “There’s a whole street available to you, and you felt you had to lounge on this corner like a delinquent,” he said. It came out slightly more aggrieved than he intended.
Potter rolled his eyes, but he stepped onto the bottom rung of the ladder and began to climb. “This is a terrible idea,” he warned as he scaled it. “If we get in trouble for it, I’m pinning all the blame on you.”
“Come on, Potter,” he said. He meant for it to be a bit salacious, a bit lascivious and over the top, but it actually came out far breathier than he anticipated. “Time for the big finish. I want it all.”
“This way I can learn by watching you,” Harry said sweetly. “Besides, it felt weird to leave all this empty space between us when we’re the only ones here.”
His finger paused in its movement, and then Malfoy was digging into the clay once more. Gently tugging the brim of the bowl towards him to widen it, he would occasionally switch to deepening the impression in the middle of the bowl, maintaining some kind of symmetry between the two that Harry couldn’t fathom. If Malfoy had been allowed to sit at his wheel and work this kind of magic during the classes instead of helping out the other students, Harry wasn’t sure he would have been able to take his eyes off him. He found the effect mesmerizing, seeing the essence of a bowl emerge out of Malfoy’s delicate ministrations.
. No thank you.
“When two become one,” Draco says, and it’s low and sultry.
“I went to that new Thai place you talked up last week,” Harry responded as he sat down. “I decided to try the green curry.”
“It’s returning your missing memories to you,” Draco said. “The dark cloud appears to be tracking you, and when it catches you then it steals some of your memories and hides them away.”
“How did you know I was doing that?” he asked.
It must have only been a few minutes later that Potter called him back.
Harry clears his throat. His shirt collar suddenly feels a bit tight. “Yes, I believe that,” he says drily. “And did these portraits reveal anything else of interest?”
“Pleased to meet you!” she replied cheerfully. “I’m Melanie; I’ve been teaching this class here at Diaz for, oh, probably seven years now. I’d offer to shake your hand, but…” She held up her hands, which were covered in more streaks of whatever was on her smock. “Clay tends to get everywhere if you’re not careful.” She gestured to the circle of desks behind her. “Go ahead and choose any available wheel. We’ll be starting shortly!”
“The worst,” Draco drawled. He kept jerking him off slow, stroking the hard evidence of Potter’s arousal. He knew he
Potter blinked. “But I don’t teach Potions,” he said. He sounded uncertain, though. Draco found that communicating with dreamers often ended up becoming a test of wills.
“And I said to leave it on the desk when he was finished so we could review it,” Draco said slowly. He glanced at the mostly empty surface of his desk, radiating uncertainty. “Where did all the paperwork go?”
“There are two things,” Harry says, and he attempts to inject confidence he doesn’t quite feel into his voice. “We’ll use one of your hairs to provide the link with your magical core. Also, the wand must be crafted under your… influence. This will allow your magic to be used in harmony with your, er, other magic.”
