The vampire pulled Harry off his cock and held him over his lap for only a moment, chuckling while Harry gasped for breath, spit running down his chin.  “Merlin, you’re fucking good at that now, Pet,” He lowered Harry’s head slowly, the younger wizard’s mouth was so hot and wet and eager for his cock.
Harry went into the bathroom and leaned over the sink. He took off his glasses and splashed water over his face. He leaned up and looked into the mirror. He was completely fine, there wasn't a cut on his cheek, or bruises on any of his visible skin. Harry quickly unbuttoned his shirt, just to check, his torso was unblemished. Harry pursed his lips and grabbed his glasses. A sound in the hall made Harry turn his face towards the door, listening in case someone else came into the bathroom.
Draco licked the bite closed, though a faint scar was starting to form from repeated bites, the vampire purred his approval at the mark before pulling away and Harry fell limply against the floor, shaking as he struggled to catch his breath.  Harry looked up at Draco who still loomed over him, the vampire's lips slowly spread into a wide cocky smirk as Harry's body gave a feeble twitch, still reeling from his orgasm. Harry struggled to stay awake, but the weeks he'd spent without this seemed have been to much and he closed his eyes and didn't open them again as his breathing slowed to show he was sleeping.
“Please bring pillows next time.” Ron said with a groan, getting up from the floor for the tenth time.
There is a phrase often overused in romances. Heart stopped. It is both overdone and a clear appropriation of the culture of those cardiac-ly challenged. Ron’s heart didn’t stop or skip a beat. It floated. Up out of his rib cage, through his throat, then up, up into the night sky where it joined the stars, bursting into a supernova.
Ginny concluded, reluctantly, that there probably wasn’t anything malicious about Harry wanting to do well in his classes.
“What’s your ethical conundrum?” Luna said, wiping crumbs from her chin and licking her lips. Merlin she loved pumpkin pasties.
“Can you not see who this is?” Harry said exasperatedly, gesturing at the indolent man with his foot. Ron didn’t think Harry quite had the upper hand to be acting all inconvenienced about this. “It’s Ba-“
She took great joy in clapping for all her new friends. Draco, who went slightly pink faced, slightly prideful, to Ravenclaw. He gave her an embarrassed nod in acknowledgement of her spirited clapping. She was one of the only ones from her table clapping. A red head with Ron’s forehead and chin looked at her in confusion and said, “You do know that’s a Malfoy, Right?”
“What’s the point if you get yourself killed along the way?” Neville said, before he could stop himself. His own voice was fraught to his ears.
Luna had almost forgotten the pile of presents stacked precariously under the tree, spilling outwards. They had been lost in the thrill of three practically violent rounds of charades, an almost disastrous game of Pictionary and far too many off-key renditions of Christmas songs- both muggle and wizarding. Luna thought it was possibly against the Geneva conventions to play Celestina Warbeck back-to-back with “Wonderful Christmas Time”.
“How was your Christmas, Gin?” Harry said, smiling at her kindly. Despite the whole ‘stalking’ fiasco Harry had remained staunchly earnest when talking to her.
“Here, Gin, you have these” Harry said, suddenly, and she felt a tipping weight in her cauldron. Harry was next to her again, Lockhart finally back at his signing table. Harry had tipped Lockhart’s entire collected works into her cauldron. She frowned “Lockhart gave me these free, but I’ll just buy my own. I don’t want anything from him anyway”
When Hermione had finally gotten around to writing her dad for a new notebook, she’d erred on the safe side and asked if he could send her multiple. The package arrived promptly with three A-4 ruled note-books and a packet of ball-point pens. She loved her dad.
Harry had continued his crusade against Quirrell and his odd behaviour around Snape. So far he had missed approx. 20% of their potions lessons. Plus, Quirrell’s turban always ended their lessons slightly worse for wear after Harry’s escapades. She was seriously going to have to have a conversation with him about sensitivity training.
Neville nodded mutely, then stood up and followed his friend in a flurry of motion. By the time he had pushed back open the closing door, Harry was already at the end of the corridor. Neville had to run to catch open, and then jog lightly to match Harry’s agitated strides.
, and then suddenly she was sliding under the kitchen table cloth and sitting under the table. The eating the jam thing with her fingers had just been a natural progression of events.
“We snuck into the kitchen.” Ron said simply, pulling his book out of his back and beginning to open it.
“Don’t I regret it.” She bemoaned loudly. Ron chucked a pillow at her head, then looked desperately sorry when it accidentally hit a bemused looking Luna.
“Prophecies are only true if you believe they are,” Harry said harshly, “Voldemort believes it’s true, so he targets me. That’s all.”
It was close to seven in the evening now, the sun just beginning to sink in the sky. Harry and Neville had returned from the Chamber of Secrets in awkward silence, the only noise coming from Harry’s hissed Parseltongue and Neville’s squeaky soles, damp from the chamber.
“You okay, kid?” Sirius asked softly. He had been surprisingly gentle towards Neville since June, something that didn’t fit with the wrongly accused mass-murderer and wild godfather of Harry he’d always envisioned him as. Neville had had very little to do with Sirius Black at all. He knew Remus much better from Hogwarts. But it was Sirius who took him to Mungo’s to see his parents, even more regularly than his Gran had. And he talked to ‘Frank’ and ‘Alice’ as he referred to them as if they were still there, which Neville was always appreciative of. He never made a comment when Neville sometimes cried or had to cut visits short out of too many overwhelming feelings.
At first he couldn’t see anything, except for dust-motes and old chalk. Then he noticed that the dust had been cleared in some places on the floor and desks. As if they had been touched or sat upon recently.
Ginny was forced to peer out of the window, and she could hear Colin craning his neck and jumping behind her, trying to see too. The second-floor window faced the east side of the lake where the shore was rocky and dotted about with bigger stones and spindly trees. Ginny’s eyes skimmed the scene, frustrated.
Without the usual excitement of the beginning of the Quidditch season, November was set to be a relaxed month. By the third day of the month, however, this changed. Drastically.
“I say I have a special connection with you-know-who because of this.” Harry said softly, tapping his scar.
, in any circumstances. Ron, however, had lived with at least seven other people in close proximity his entire life and knew that periodic airing outs were needed to stave off homicide. Also, he was royally
. I just don’t think the magical woodland creature knows that snide remarks are how you impart love”
The next morning the front-page article of the Daily Prophet (which she saw only because Colin never missed an opportunity to gawk at wizarding photographs) read like this:
“Alright” She said, swinging up one of the shovels “But you’re going to have to duplicate another shovel for me because you only have two”
A jack rabbit Patronus appears next to Dumbledore before they even make it to the first step. Every one of them stops dead in their tracks.
“You’d find tie to eat on your own deathbed.” Hermione had said drily, flicking a page over sharply and releasing a cloud of dust into the air as she did.
“Here.” Ron said, passing Hermione a charmed steaming cup of tea as he swung his legs around a bench in the study-hall.
Ginny would have pressed more, but the slithering started up again. It was almost deafening this close, and the snake hissed something. Ginny gathered it was a grateful goodbye.
“I’ll make sure he’s alright.” Ron said softly, and everyone nodded, watching Neville with sorrowful eyes.
Ginny frowned, then wandered over to the closest sofa. Dean Thomas and Rupert from her year were playing a game of chess. She stood in front of them and coughed pointedly. They looked up at her in surprise.
After a few moments, Harry hissed something out and the snake responded. “What did you say?” Ginny asked, curiously.
“She isn’t the editor,” Ginny said, her usual Pansy Parkinson hatred sounding flaccid as she moved her porridge around in its bowl drably.
He pulled something else out from his pocket with his spare hand, the tossed it to her. It was another eye mask, this one with a line of ‘Z’s across it. “Here. I always bring a spare. But this on and don’t take it off no matter what happens”
The regular residents of the townhouse, which included said grooms and their adopted ward Harry Potter, all commented on the oddness of having strangers around the place. It had been mere months since Sirius Black had had all charges against him legally dropped. Finally acquitted in the eyes of the law after a gruelling four years.
The door to the bathroom was just making its slow swing almost all the way closed when Ginny slammed her hand against it and pushed it back open wide. For a second, she thought that the bathroom was deserted, or that Harry was in one of the cubicles, but then she saw the gaping entry way that where the sink usually stood.
Then he’d turned on his feet and with ungodly speed made his way into the dusky forest. So of course, as loyal sidekicks, they had followed.
But these are all thoughts that loiter on the edge of his mind, pushed aside by the thrill of first journeys and new places.
“Cessabit ignis,” Neville screamed, sweat and tears rolling down his face from the heat and the terror. “Cessabit ignis.”
Ron felt his jaw go slack. Despite his prompting, Harry had refused to talk about some of the events of his past life. Especially the ones that hurt to much, Ron deduced. When he’d talked to Hermione she’d confided that Harry only ever told her the more tragic things when it was necessary. She said that he’d always remained relatively tight-lipped about his seventh year and the events leading up to his death. Apart from the Horcruxes, of course.
“Two others.” Ron said under his breath. “I think, I mean I’m not sure, but one was a Diggory. I think Cedric’s mum. And another wizard I didn’t know.”
They left the shop with a bag groaning under the weight of The Velvet Underground, The Kinks and Joni Mitchell. A Nina Simone just for Remus to salivate over. Harry made Neville buy a record too, for himself.
“But I thought-“ Neville said, frowning and thinking of Draco. He stopped himself, It wasn’t his place. He sighed. “I didn’t kiss you because I like you. Well, I think I liked you a little. But mainly it was because you were there and we’d just escaped death and you pay attention to me.”
“Ah, yes. Of course, you remember me.” He said smugly. Then cast a disdainful look at Ron. “Though I wouldn’t think you’d want to associate with
They’d been ice-skating at a local lake which always froze over (though this claim, which was plastered across the lakes picturesque advertisements, always prompted a rant about the coming effects of global warming from Hermione) and had made cookies and had watched every Christmas film under the sun. They had also consumed far, far too much hot chocolate. Christmas was the only time of year that the Grangers let refined sugar into their household.
“Good. Hey Lu, you never said where in the world you and your dad are going this year? Annual expedition isn’t it?”
A small bundle of parchment. When he unfolded it, he realised it was a larger piece of parchment cradling some smaller scraps.
Neville declined to point out the falsehood in that and instead slunk back to his room, checking again if he’d left anything behind.
“Stole it back from Filch’s office. Sirius and Remus made it at school, with my dad” Harry said with distraction.
“You were excellent.” Ginny gushed, holding out her hand for a high five which Fleur gave with bemusement.
Luna’s half-way through not doing her Potion’s essay (instead of following Snapes prompt she’s writing him a think-piece on animal cruelty in the potions industry. She’s sure he’ll appreciate it) when she feels the sofa cushions dip beside her.
Hermione wasn’t certain, but she was pretty sure a magical society would expect a more formal manner of speech. She’d been practicing on her barbie dolls. Her barbie dolls that she most definitely didn’t play with anymore, and anyway even if she did it was only to re-enact her favourite scenes from Much Ado About Nothing and Emma, and so really it didn’t count anyway.
They sat in silence, each of them wrapped up in their own thoughts. Harry looked fraught; his hands balled into fists around handfuls of his robes.
I wonder if there is a place where he lives out every afterlife. Perhaps that is where the tracks converge. A single Harry Potter, arrogant and humbled all in one soul.
Neville took the brown envelope delicately. When he slipped the close open, he pulled out a small bundle of photographs. He pulled them out with the back showing. They had been dated in an inky scrawl ‘25/12/81’.
With clear sight lines the group woefully commiserated their mutual loss through exaggerated gagging gestures and eye rolls. The Slytherins celebrated obnoxiously all night.
“Did you do that pretty calligraphy, yourself?” She asked innocently but for some reason Draco just blushed intensely and walked quickly away. He’d always treated her oddly. Ginny had told her, in confidence, that it was because he was jealous that Harry seemed to like her so much. She thought that was sad. Especially because Harry didn’t like her in that way at all and she certainly didn’t.
“No, I won’t.” Neville said, the idea of leaving Harry to his madness even more frightening than the thought of staying.
This one is a love story. The kind you'd expect to find draped in ball gowns and tragedy. But Harry Potter has his love story in school robes, green this time, and he falls in love with a boy who is more brittle confidence than kindness. He breathes the fire his name promises; witty and harsh and defensive.
Harry began by outlining what the group was for “We change Defence teachers so much that we’re almost guaranteed an inconsistent education” He joked, and everyone chuckled.
By the time the night ended, it had already been placed into Ron’s archives of treasured memories. He lead Hermione to the bottom of her stairs, even though he felt silly doing it, and bid her a proper goodnight. She smiled politely and bemusedly at him the whole time, but when he was done she flung her arms around him in a tight hug.
“The only person more dramatic than you is Harry” Luna said serenely, causing Draco to break out into laughter and Harry to gape indignantly before breaking out into a monologue about how un-dramatic he was.
secret passage way. She couldn’t see where it came out, and that gave her pause. But she also couldn’t see Harry Potter and that meant that Harry Potter was down that secret passageway.
ry.” Ron teased. “Last term alone you got a teacher fired, found a man who everyone had assumed dead for a decade and discovered the Lost Diadem of Rowena Ravenclaw. Which, by the way, you still haven’t told us what you did with. You’re always planning.”
“Why are they all so beautiful?” Hermione muttered under her breathe, eyes wide as she watched the Beauxbatons students stream past into the entrance hall, huddled together as if it was mid-winter rather than a balmy autumn night. “Is it, like, a requirement for their education?”
Hermione’s breathe caught in her throat. Whatever she’d expected (from werewolf to eldritch being) she hadn’t expected that.
On its pages I find a boy I have only seen in glimpses. His name is Harry Potter, and he is dazzling. His wit, his intelligence- it is truly beyond measure. In this life I find a boy who finds himself. His name is Harry Potter and he learns every rule in order to break them perfectly. His name is Harry Potter and in this telling he is so bright, so blue.
Hermione huffed “Yes, well. However odd Kreacher can be, that still won’t make me condone institutionalised slavery”
Which Ron just really didn’t think was the best declaration to start on? Ron loved his best friend, he
The twins were the ones who made the greatest impression. Fred and George were constantly roping Neville into their experiments.
The room, if possible, went even quieter. Dumbledore’s expression didn’t change per se, but Neville noticed that his eyes widened slightly.
Their group shouldn’t work, and it definitely shouldn’t work as well as it does, but everyday she’s amazed. By the joy, the laughter, the ease. She sits at the breakfast table surrounded by unexpected friends and sometimes the luck of it all is too much. Contentedness threatens to burst its way from the confines of her skin, overflow into the world. There is too much love.
“You and Hermione are going to be the death of me, as per usual” He muttered under his breathe. He pulled something out of his pocket, then pointed his wand at it and murmured a spell. Suddenly two fat dead chickens grew in Harry’s hand. “I keep them small in my pocket, so I don’t get weird questions” He said awkwardly.
There were only five photos, two of them blurry from a shaky camera, but Neville cried over them anyway. His mums smiling face as she held a chubby baby. His dad’s proud grin and blazing eyes.
“Here,” Neville said, looking in despair at the dusty knees of Ron’s robes, “My Gran had me pack two pairs.”
“Can’t she?” Hermione muttered with the chagrin of a good friend who’s been forced to put up with too much.
She hadn’t really known what that meant, apart from being a very stupid observation, and so she simply gave him a look you might give a puppy when it did a trick correctly. “Yes, well done.” She said, just a touch patronisingly.
It was almost Halloween now, and they had decided to crowd together on this Friday night to take a break from schoolwork. And from the news which every day seemed to be filled more and more with horrible ‘unexplained’ attacks and deaths.
A long three minutes later, after a spirited debate and lot of disembodied laughter she wasn’t entirely sure wasn’t aimed at her, Hermione Granger became the newest member of Gryffindor house.
He tore his gaze away from the carpet and looked at her, puzzled. Then he shrugged “What did you have in mind?”
Ginny knows that this isn’t what her brothers wanted to teach her. Charlie and Bill had good friends, like Tonks, who taught them all about girls and equality. Fred and George wouldn’t be caught dead saying a serious bad word about the chasers on the Gryffindor team. Even Ron wrote her all his first year about his new best friend Hermione, who he called ‘brilliant’ every two sentences.
Hermione’s face was hidden under foundation a shade too light for her face, with drawn on freckles all over it. Thick glasses were set over her eyes, which were in turn covered by green contact lenses. Thick eye make-up, completely different eye-brow shapes and ridiculous contour further distorted her natural face.
“Oh, bloody hell.” Ron said, head under his four-poster. “I haven’t a clue where my nice shoes are.”
A side effect of befriending Harry Potter at an impressionable age was that you became naturally inclined to eavesdropping. Every time you heard your name around a corner or through library stacks you became conditioned to pause and listen instead of to confront.
“Because I’m a time traveller” Harry stated bluntly, no indication in his tone that he was actually revealing an astounding thing “And therefore I’ve known you before”
It was true that Lockhart was an abysmal teacher, but Ginny was surprised still when the flyer went up in the common room.
Luna stared back at him for a while waiting for him to go on. When she finally realised that was all he was going to say she nodded slowly “Yes. That’s right. I’m a Lovegood”
“Hogwarts: A History,” Ron finished, giving her a teasing smile. Hermione gave him a half-hearted scowl.
Harry Potter, eleven years old and newly acquainted with the wizarding world, is boarding the Hogwarts Express for the first time. Well, the first time in this universe.   There will be a strange sense of nostalgia to the trip, the sense that he is seeing everything through an old sepia photograph, looking back on the present. He will step over a bulge in the red carpet and have the strangest feeling that once he tripped. The taste of chocolate frogs will be tinged with remembrance, although he is almost certain he has not had one before.
Then there came lessons. Harry Potter was just too good at everything. It was, she hated to think it, extremely annoying for someone like Hermione to not excel when she always had before. The worst part was the way Harry seemed to always play his own brilliance off, like there was nothing unusual about it. Hermione had watched him casually transfigure a matchstick into a pin on the first attempt, before seeming to panic. He’d then proceeded to transfigure the pin
Hermione had thought it was pretty weird that Harry had followed her into the second-floor girls’ bathroom after potions that day, but she’d just chalked it up to general Harry weirdness. He probably just wanted to catch up on all the school gossip with Myrtle.
Ron didn’t know how he was keeping his eyes open. They’d done a very small heist the night before, breaking into Ludo Bagman's temporary office at Hogwarts to check that the cup wasn't tampered with. When they’d gotten the all-clear, no super-secret death port-key in sight, they’d trudged back up to bed.
“Harry,” Neville said softly, but his own voice sounded distant to his ears. His head full of cotton. Last year it had been his Grandmother, now the minister of magic. It would only grow, he knew, until every good thing would be snuffed out by one evil man with too much power.
“How’s Draco?” Neville asked, sitting carefully on the bed beside Harry. Harry grinned at him, shifting over so Neville could lie down beside him and look at Draco in the mirror. He looked animatedly frustrated, as usual.
“Hey, wait—” Ginny called, but the door was already being closed sharply behind them. Ginny stared at the back of the door, where her pink fluffy dressing gown and yellow water-proof coat were hung.
Harry’s mouth tightened around the edges. “I never lived with Sirius. He died at the end of our fifth year.”
The Oracle’s office had been charmed larger over the last years, now containing three printing presses and many overtly personalised desks. It wasn’t unusual to find any number of reporters or editors pulling their hair out on week-day nights, adopting the habits of their more seasoned reporter ancestors by guzzling black coffee and gesturing with quills and pens. They had several sections now, new and old, and Every fortnight when the new edition came out people read it raptly, discussing aspects for days after.
Draco glanced at her, and gave her a friendly if awkward smile “You must be Weasley’s sister? Sorry for that sad turn of events”
The two began to cast charms, Hermione out loud and Harry silently. She raised her eyebrows at that, not only could Harry successfully apparate but he could apparently cast non-verbally too.
“I’m not sure, Molly dear.” Dad said tiredly. He had been up for hours at that point, sorting out both the mess of the air-borne attacks and the fall-out of Harry’s revelation. “I’m going to have to head in, soon.”
So, okay. That made sense why they were in her room. What didn’t make sense was what in Merlin’s name they were talking about.
Harry ran his shaking fingers through his hair and forced himself to sit up, he looked down at the damp tent in his boxers and groaned as he ran his hand firmly over it. It was still early, and he had placed a silencing charm on his curtains last night, so he knew it was safe. He shifted and leaned back against his headboard before sliding his fingers under his boxers and wrapped them firmly around his straining cock. He whimpered, letting his head fall back against the wood that supported him with a soft thud. His legs spread a bit wider as his other hand joined the first in his boxers, moving beneath his cock to roll his balls in his hand.
He didn't make it to the stairs before a cold hand clamped over his mouth and he was pulled down the hall and into an empty room. Harry was pushed harshly onto the stone floor, face down with the vampire boxing him in with his arms and legs, snarling. Harry struggled, but had no intentions of escape, he just wanted more of the vampire's body to press against his.
He was cleaned, healed and dressed in clean pajamas, there was a lingering ache in his lower body, but he didn't mind it. Harry pushed open the curtains of bed and swung his legs over the edge of the bed and stood. He grabbed his glasses, noting that they'd been fixed and pushed them up the bridge of his nose to their rightful place. He glanced down at his bed, noticing the end of his wand sticking from his pillow, where he usually kept it. Harry's brow furrowed, wondering how he managed to get back into the Tower when the last thing he remembered was Malfoy's eyes hovering over him before the world went blissfully dark.
The vampire pushed a strong hand between the blades of Harry's shoulder, holding him down firmly. He pulled his hips back, only to snap them forward sharply. Harry groaned, shifting his arms to rest around his head. His fingers scrapped against the stones uselessly as the vampire easily picked up an inhuman speed, pounding Harry into the floor.  Harry panted harshly, moaned and tried to thrust back against the vampire, only to receive smacks across his ass. Each hit came after a thrust and Harry couldn’t catch his breath.
There was a large desk with a leather chair behind it, right in front of a charmed window that revealed part of the forbidden forest, Harry could see threstals at a stream, a cave just on the other side of the water where more of the strange beasts were stepping out. Not far from that was a fainting chair, a couch and two armchairs in front of a crackling fireplace, all done in black leather. On the opposite side of the bed were several dark stained wardrobes, one of which was opened, revealing expensive looking robes. Two bookshelves stood on the wall in front of the bed, lined with books of different sizes, and age.
The action was enough for Harry to climax, his cum falling onto his lower stomach, smearing against Malfoy's when the vampire pressed his body tightly against Harry's, thrusting wildly until he too found release, filling Harry's tight body with it. As the orgasmic bliss filled Harry's mind, mixing with the dizziness of rapid blood loss, Harry forced his eyes open and looked up, seeing Malfoy's glowing silver eyes hovering over him.
"Such a beautiful reaction." Malfoy said, running his fingers over Harry's hot cheek. "As for why, its simple Harry." Malfoy said unbuttoning his jacket and shrugging out of it. His nimble fingers had his shirt unbuttoned in seconds and it hung open, revealing a muscled, pale, hairless chest. Harry's eyes followed the trail of muscle, stopping at the trail of blond hair that started just below Malfoy's navel, it was trimmed and well kept - just like ever other part of Malfoy's Adonis like body. Harry shivered even though every fiber of his being was on fire. "Because I want to, because I can." Malfoy continued as he unbuckled his belt then unbuttoned and unzipped his slacks. He pushed his slacks and undergarments dangerously low on his hips, but didn't reveal his cock, which Harry could feel straining against the fabric that covered it.
However, when he heard the crash at the Slytherin table, Harry grinned. It confirmed that the vampire had been watching him and now he was jealous.
Harry's eyes snapped open. Laying with one arm crossed behind his head was Draco, who raised a single eyebrow and looked away from the book he'd been reading and down at Harry.
Finally, with a strangled cry, Harry came. Confined in his boxers, his cum slid over his hand and onto his groin, almost burning his skin when it touched him. Harry was slow to draw his hands from his boxers, and rested them on his lower stomach while he tried to catch his breath, staring at the top canopy of his bed.
Harry looked across the Great Hall, his eyes falling on the familiar blond vampire sitting regally at the Slytherin table, surrounded like always, by Crabbe, Goyle and Parkinson. Harry watched Malfoy the entire night, fighting with himself.
"Once they realize we both aren't in class, and no one sees us all day, they'll begin searching, and eventually they'll find us." Draco whispered, trailing his lips down Harry's chest. "Then they'll have to explain to the rest of the school that I've taken you as mine and no one will be able to pull us apart.". Harry shivered at the dominating tone in Draco's voice. The vampire chuckled darkly, tangling the fingers of his right hand in Harry's hair, pulling his head to the side, and buried his fangs in Harry's neck.
Harry blushed when Malfoy was suddenly face to face with him. The vampire smiled yet again, then licked the blood that was running down Harry's cheek. The vampire leaned his head back and groaned at the taste. Harry couldn't prevent the spark of arousal that shot down his spine at the sight and sound.
Stepping into the Great Hall with Hermione on his left and Ron on his right still made Harry feel so damn exposed. He kept his head ducked and his eyes trained on his tattered trainers. His heart raced when he noticed Malfoy and his group walking out of the hall as he went in with his. They seemed to all move in slow motion, most of all when Hermione stepped aside so that Malfoy didn't run into her. The blond vampire brushed against Harry's side, his hand reaching out to grip the back of Harry's hair before just as quickly pulling away. Malfoy had at the same time leaned down and whispered in Harry's ear:
Harry looked up at Malfoy, and when the vampire opened his mouth in a wide smile, Harry remembered - he didn't want this, and began struggling again. "Let me go!" Harry cried frantically and Malfoy chuckled.
Harry sat up quickly, the black silk sheets falling off his still naked, but cleaned body. "Where are we?" Harry asked and the vampire chuckled.
"Show me your teeth." His breath was ice cold, and it set Harry's skin ablaze and his cheeks flushed.
"I don't take kindly to people touching what's mine." Draco hissed and nipped angrily at Harry's neck. His prey moaned, green eyes falling closed. The vampire pushed Harry down and slid over him, his hands in the bed on either side of his head, his knees on the outsides of Harry's thighs. "You belong to me.". Draco pressed his lips on to Harry's and nipped them harshly before pressing his tongue into Harry's mouth, kissing the human until he was breathless and groaning.  He pulled away and looked down to watch Harry panting for breath.
Harry hollowed his cheeks and began bobbing his head, bringing the vampire closer and closer before he was pulled off the cock suddenly and pressed face down on the stone floor again. Harry yelped; his skin was scrapped painfully against the rough stone. Draco had the human's body pinned down with his own and he growled when he reached a hand between the cheeks of Harry's ass to tease the pucker. Only he found it loosened and slick already.
He slipped two fingers into himself with relative ease, sliding down on the bed slightly. He tried to imagine it was Draco's fingers, but his own weren't nearly as long or as cold as Draco's. Harry groaned in aroused frustration as he stroked his cock harder and added a third finger into himself, pushing them as deep as he could, pressing hard against his prostate. Harry's feet spread on the sheets, pressing into the mattress as his knees bent slightly. He pushed his head back into the pillows as he felt his orgasm pressing on him, his balls tightened and pre-cum slid under and over the fingers wrapped tight around his cock as he fisted himself harder and faster.
The vampire smirked at his human and pulled his wand from his robes and waved it over the sleeping human, dressing him with ease before pulling on his own clothing.
"Don't lie to yourself Harry." Malfoy said, he reached down and cupped Harry's straining cock and Harry gasped. "My glamour can't fake this. No, no, no, my dear Harry, this is all you. What is hidden deep in the back of your mind, your desires, the ones that you keep locked away so that your goody goody Gryffindors don't ever see it." Malfoy tore off Harry's boxers with ease, smirking when Harry squeaked in embarrassment. "You like something about this situation don't you?" Malfoy's eyes glowed again as he looked into Harry's eyes. "What is it?"
The vampire moved his finger in and out slowly, then added a second which caused the teen below to grunt and bite his tongue in pain. Malfoy didn't care, he continued, scissoring his fingers before twisting them searching for the nub that would make the hurt worth it. When Harry cried out against his mouth, Malfoy knew he found it. He grinned then rubbed hard against it, loving the way Harry's muscles began to tense and his heart rate and breathing increased so quickly. The way Harry writhed, tried to escape and get closer at the same time. Malfoy pulled away to add his third and final finger, Harry keened with the pain, Draco loved the sound. His cock twitched, straining yet again against the fabric of his pants. Malfoy ignored his own desire instead, focusing on preparing his night lover, Harry arched and struggled at the onslaught of pleasure, making desperate sounds he could not hold back until finally, arching his back, Harry screamed.
"Why what love?" Malfoy teased as he unbuttoned Harry's jeans with skilled ease and pulled them down to the teen's knees. "Why am I doing this? Or why do I watch you?" He shifted back long enough to pull Harry's jeans off completely, tossing them away without a care.
It sent a shiver up his spine and he couldn't help. Harry licked his lips and forced himself to turn his attention to Ginny who was pleading for his attention. She still hadn't seemed to get it through her head that Harry wanted nothing to do with her, she wanted him to take care of him, to give her the pampered life she dreamed of as a little girl. Not to mention the fact that Harry thought she looked to much like his mother - it was just a bit creepy.
"I'm not going to give you what you want though. I'm going to make you beg for it by the end. You'll come on hands and knees, moaning like a little whore, begging me to fuck you until you can't breath." Malfoy bit Harry's ear harshly and Harry whimpered.
"I thought you were a Death Eater." Harry admitted, hoping he could get Malfoy distracted in some way and escape.
Harry's heart pounded in his ear, with each mouthful of blood the vampire took, he grew weaker yet more aroused. When the haze of blood loss and painful arousal became to much, the vampire pulled away with one final harsh thrust against Harry's ass, then vanished with only the sound of his billowing opened robes.
“Naughty, naughty. You're playing with fire Harry." Malfoy hissed seductively and leaned down to run his lips over Harry's neck. "I know how much you want me to take you, right here, right now, against the wall."
"Come out and face me!" Harry roared, he would never outrun the predator chasing him, all his years being chased by Dudley did nothing to help his current situation. "Coward!" Harry screamed desperately. The laugh came towards him again.
Harry cried out in surprise and tripped, skidding across the damp ground until he came to a stop by slamming into a thick root that had arched from the ground. Thick moss covered most of the ground surrounding Harry. He pushed himself upright with a whimper of pain, nursing several large bruises that were quickly forming on his skin. Two definite footsteps sounded over him and Harry forced terror filled, neon green eyes skyward. Standing on another, larger arched root, was the thing that had been chasing him.
When Harry turned back to the mirror, he noticed a mark on his neck. Harry pulled his shirt away, and noticed the distinct marks of a vampire bite. Harry's heart thudded loudly against his chest, it had been real! Harry's cheeks flushed, the fact that it had been real meant that he had had sex with Malfoy, he had enjoyed having sex with Malfoy, he would gladly give himself to the vampire again. The vampire knew of his fetishes for being bitten and fucked roughly.
"You were the one that followed me out here Potter. You were the one that interrupted my feeding. You should've thought about what I could be doing in the forest in the middle of the night before coming after me." Malfoy chastised, his voice soft like he was scolding a child. Harry squirmed as Malfoy ripped open his shirt and ran his hand down Harry's lithe Quidditch toned chest, and sighed at the warmth of the human's skin.
The vampire chuckled and leaned down, trailing his nose over Harry's skin until he found a place to his liking and bit down, his fangs breaking Harry's skin. The human's knees went weak and he moaned, his palms scrapping against the stone painfully and his cock jumped in pleasure as Draco all but mauled his neck, taking deep pulls of his’s blood.
"What's that?" Harry asked. Draco leaned closer and ran his lips down the length of Harry's neck and purred at the shiver that ran down Harry's spine.
"You are mine, Harry, he wouldn't be able to stop me. You belong to me, the laws make it impossible to take a vampire's willing donor, no matter how dangerous our. . . coupling could be to your health. Until I hear you utter the word no to me, there's nothing that's going to stop me."
"Why?" Harry asked and Malfoy laughed, letting Harry's hands go, but they stayed above Harry's head, pinned by magic.
Malfoy bent down, sniffing the air and letting his eyes fall closed. "I can smell your fear Potter, its intoxicating." Malfoy chuckled and jumped effortlessly off the ten foot high root to land soundlessly and gracefully in front of Harry's feet as the teen was still sprawled on the ground, against the root that had knocked him down.
Harry groaned when Malfoy let his hair go, then ground his hips hard, pushing his straining cock against Harry's ass.  "Then don't." Harry whispered back breathlessly.
Harry whimpered at the order, biting his lip to prevent himself from begging for release, but with each powerful snap of Malfoy's hips, his resolve crumbled all the more, until finally a harsh stab at his prostate had his back bowing and him crying out in pleasure. He was soon pleading for Malfoy to allow him to cum.
Harry put his hands on the vampire's thighs and gripped tightly as his fingers tangled in Harry's hair again and forced him down so his lips brushed over the head of his cock. Harry wasted no time, opening his mouth and taking the organ into it and bobbing his head. Blunt nails scrapped against his scalp as he worked.  Harry pressed his tongue over the thick vein on the underside of Draco's cock and the vampire hissed his pleasure and rocked his hips up, his cock hitting the back of Harry's throat. Harry gagged slightly and his eyes watered as he swallowed, repeatedly, against the cock going down his throat. Draco held his head down until Harry was drooling against his pubes and his throat convulsed.
Harry felt a shiver of cold run down his spin and looked up and across the Great Hall as the vampire stared up at him with the same burning lust in his eyes that would've had a lesser man or woman creaming themselves then crawling on hands and knees to the vampire's feet and begging for more. Harry licked his lips slowly, watching as the vampire's eyes followed the action before darting up to Harry's green eyes an instant later.
"Relax, I've done this before." Malfoy whispered seductively and Harry shivered as Malfoy grabbed his other wrist, then moved both of the human's wrists into one large cold hand. Malfoy's free hand moved to Harry's thigh, then pulled him so he was laying flat on the ground. Harry screamed and bucked wildly, fighting against the vampire's impossible strength. "No need to fight me Harry, you won't win." Malfoy leaned down and ran his lips and nose down, across then up the opposite side of Harry's neck. The vampire moaned at the scent of Harry's racing heart, the blood pumping so quickly just beneath the skin.
"Your father's a Death Eater, I thought you'd follow in his footsteps like a good little snake." Harry hissed angrily, hating that he was so defenseless against Malfoy.
"I see my ability of glamour doesn't work on you as well as it does on others." Malfoy said. "I had you for a little bit though, didn't I?" He asked with amusement, raising a sculpted eyebrow. Harry growled, trying to break the magic that bound his hands, but without his wand, he could only do to much.
"Playing with yourself Pet?" The vampire questioned with amusement. "You get off on thoughts of me?" Draco pulled Harry's cheeks apart and with a quick thrust he pushed his cock into him.
Malfoy didn't still until he was balls deep inside Harry, but after he waited, his back bowed, his head hanging and his blunt nails biting into Harry's thighs. Harry panted for a few minutes before he rocked his hips and that was all the urging the vampire needed to pull out almost completely, then slam back in. Harry cried out, his eyes going wide as his prostate was slammed into on the first thrust, then again and again as Malfoy picked up an inhuman pace. Harry's back pushed into the dirt beneath him.
Harry fell to his knees, one hand still above his head and pressed firmly against the wall, the other on the floor between his knees.  Eyes closed tightly, his breath coming in harsh painful gasps. Draco knew just how far he could go, always pushing the lines between safe and dangerous, pain and pleasure.  Harry managed to catch his breath and pulled himself up the wall with some difficultly considering his legs were shaking so badly and his brain was in such a haze at the lack of blood.
Harry stood as calmly as he could, trying to ignore the shaking in his hands and left the Great Hall. He could feel greedy silver eyes following him as he made his way from the first floor to the second. The silence of the predator following him, only added to his thrill.  He wasn't sure why he suddenly wanted Malfoy to constantly do this to him. He figured it was most likely because for the other million and one interactions he had with the people of Hogwarts and the outside world, they were bowing down to him, treating him like he was delicate, yet wanting him to be some Hero at every second.   The moments he spent with Draco; were like nothing he'd ever felt before.
The loud howling of a wolf made Harry look around frantically. In the darkness of the Forbidden forest, Harry could see nothing but the large trees and rich under brush. Harry's breath steamed as it left his mouth in clouds, he panted but forced himself to keep running. He had long since lost his wand and the left lens of his glasses had cracked when a tree branch had swiped across his face, drawing a line of blood on his cheek in the process. There was no way for Harry to find direction, the sky was blocked out almost completely by the trees above him, and he couldn't see more than twenty feet in front of him before the trees came in to close and swallowed the outside world in darkness. A familiar laugh filled the static air, the brush of a hand on the back of Harry's neck had him spin around, searching for the owner.
"I am in charge here, Harry." Draco said. "Most of all when I've got you wrapped around my fingers. Fucking you is my right."
After a few minutes, Harry gritted his teeth and sat up and grabbed his wand from under his pillow and waved it over himself and muttered a cleaning spell before opening the curtains of his bed. The only other boy awake was Dean Thomas, he was sitting on his bed, a sketch pad opened on his knees, he didn't even look up when Harry padded in front of his bed heading towards the bathroom.
"Your dorm?" Harry asked looking around. The curtains to his canopy bed were tied back, revealing a large room done up in greens, black and silver.
Harry made it all the way to the Gryffindor tower, without the vampire grabbing him and he bit his lip. He turned slowly, standing at the end of the hall, half covered in shadow, was Draco.
"Really Potter, do you think taunting me is going to gain you the upper hand?" Came the cool reply from the darkness. Harry swore he saw a flash of white between two trees, he turned and took off in the opposite direction. "Running again? Do you know how much I enjoy the hunt?" The voice asked, whispered in his ear. He could feel chilling breath on his skin.
Draco’s lips slowly twisted up into a gleaming smile. The flash of his teeth was enough for Harry to loose the confidence that he had had previously. It was his kryptonite after all, those perfect fangs, just the thought of them on his skin was enough to have him shivering with arousal. Harry watched silver eyes shift towards the large doors of the Great Hall and Harry understood the order. After a quick excuse to Ron and Hermione about being tired, then reassuring them that he'd be able to return to the tower alone, Harry got up from the table slowly, and made his way out of the hall.
"My father's human." Malfoy admitted looking up at Harry, his eyes glowing eerily. Malfoy smirked, flashing his fangs again at the surprise in Harry's face. "Vampirism is a very dominating gene in the Black line, my mother's line. The same as Sirius Black's, your godfather is a vampire, did you know that Harry?" Malfoy let his tongue slip past his lightly colored lips and run across a scar on Harry's stomach. Harry gasped, his body jerking at the wet coldness of Malfoy's tongue. "You taste sweet Harry, I wonder if its from all the treacle tart you're always eating." Malfoy moved up Harry's body again, his tongue darting out several more times to lick Harry's sweat slicked skin.
"That's it, Harry." Whispered Draco, almost tenderly as he rocked his body easily against Harry's, his cock only rubbing over the human's prostate in teasingly light grazes. Harry whined, his chest heaving and his heart racing as he struggled on the edge of a climax that was just out of his reach.
It made Harry's heart beat wildly in his chest, but exhaustion forced Harry back into his bed, but the butterflies in his stomach wouldn't let him rest peacefully, he had no idea what the morning would hold.
“So good, darling,” The vampire purred, gently thrusting his fingers in and out of the younger boy’s mouth. “Fuck, look at you.” Malfoy finally forced himself to pull his fingers away, replaced them with his own mouth, kissing Harry passionately, his teeth pulling at Harry's lips, then his tongue soothing the hurt before slipping into Harry's mouth to map every single part of it. Malfoy's now wet fingers moved between Harry's legs between the cheeks of his ass to the puckered hole hidden there. Harry gasped against Malfoy's mouth when the first finger slipped into him. His hands fisted above his head and arms strained against the invisible binds that held him.
Standing cockily with his hands in the pockets of his slacks and a smirk on his lips. Harry's heart nearly stopped beating when Malfoy vanished in a blur, only to reappear directly in front of Harry, slamming the Boy Who Lived up against the stone wall next to the portrait that covered the entrance, with his chest against the wall, and his back pressed firmly against the vampire’s cold, firm chest. Harry grunted at the force of the impact, Draco pushing his hands against the wall above his head, his head turned to the side so his right cheek was pressed against the rough stone. He looked over his shoulder at the vampire's glowing eyes, the candle light danced dangerously in them.
Dressed in black slacks, polished leather shoes, a long sleeve white button up shirt, and black suit jacket - all of which was incredibly clean for someone who'd just been running through the woods, was his tormentor. Blond hair laid almost perfectly on his head, except for a single lock that hung over his right eye. The sparkling silver gaze stood out in the darkness, along with pale skin and a startling white deadly smile. Elongated canines plus smaller yet still pointed teeth on the outsides of the canines made Harry's heart pick up several beats and his breathing halt for a moment. Draco
"A Death Eater, really?" Malfoy asked with amusement in his voice. "I bow to no one, that includes a lying, insane, half-blood." Malfoy didn't seem to break his stride as his hand slid down Harry's torso and reached the younger teen's waistband. He lifted his hand so only his finger tips brushed the line Harry's pants left, guarding Harry's dignity. Malfoy hummed as his lips followed the line his hand had just made.
Harry shivered but never took his eyes off Ginny as Malfoy stormed elegantly from the Great Hall, leaving whispers in his wake. Harry knew he'd pay the price for that later.  Malfoy had staked his claim that night in the forest and every couple of days since he reinforced the claim, making sure Harry knew exactly what he thought when the human got affection from anyone, most of all his touchy-feely lion pride.
!”  Throwing his head back. He groaned as the initial pain left him with only the feeling of being filled by the vampire's cock.  Draco shifted Harry's legs wider around his knees.
The vampire smirked and bit down, breaking the skin and taking a deep mouthful of blood as he picked up the speed and strength of his thrust, his hand working his prey's cock steadily.  Harry struggled for air, rocking back against Draco’s thrusts when he could until something inside of him snapped. Harry gave a strangled cry as he came harshly, it raced through his entire body. His hole clenched around the vampire's cock, sucking on him until he too found release and emptied into his human.
To prove his point, the vampire rocked his hips forward. Harry moaned, then bit his lip and let his head fall back.  It exposed his neck, the barely visible constellation of Draco’s fang marks.
Harry shivered again when the others said they wanted to turn in early for the night. Harry said he'd meet them in a bit, that he wanted to finish his tart.  Harry waited fifteen whole minutes, his heart pumping blood loudly in his ears as he waited, knowing by the time he made it out of the entrance hall, his friends would be too far away to hear him scream and Malfoy was waiting for him.
"No?" Malfoy hummed, and swiped his thumb over the smooth head of his victim's cock, watching his muscles jump at the sensation. The vampire grinned, his fangs flashing in the brief glow of the full moon that managed to get through the trees. Harry's heart speed up. "Maybe its because I'm taking you against your will, the fact that I chased you down, am dominating you. I bet you hate everyone bowing down to you Harry. You want someone to grab your hair, force you on your knees, don't you?"
The vampire flipped Harry onto his back long enough to tear off his clothes. The muscles in Harry's stomach jumped in excitement, his cock twitched in anticipation as he watched the vampire strip himself of his clothing as well. Draco pulled Harry up as he sat back on his robes, his legs stretched out and spread enough for Harry to fit between them.
Hermione thought there was equal part welcome and strange reluctance in Harry’s voice, though Hermione attributed that to the Malfoy boys generally unpleasant aura.
Another romance. The same boy, but this time sporting blue. He likes to tell Harry Potter he is stupid before kissing him. Harry Potter makes the first move. All that bravery boiling over and pushing him forward. Bravery gets him killed.
Ginny understood that. It was a common Wizarding practice to have empty graves, or coffins filled with mementos of the person instead of bodies. Human remains could be a powerful tool in many dark rituals.
In first year, after Ron had decided he was actually pretty decent, Ron had worried if Draco would ever be able to fit into that dynamic without ruining it. Harry had seemed so reticent to include him at first, despite it being
Molly Weasley (nee. Prewett and don’t you forget it) goes into labour at six in the morning, just after she places that mornings bread loaf in the airing cupboard for a final rise. By nine o'clock Ron Weasley, baby-pink and not making a fuss, is swaddled against her chest as she orders Arthur to put the bread in the oven or breakfast will be
“Non! Without you I would have never come this far.” Fleur was beaming at Tonks, eyes trained on the shorter woman like dazzling lasers. “You will owl me this summer, and next year help me settle, non?”
The second piece of evidence happened near the end of September, when Ginny’s curiosity had almost been drowned in the excitement of her first year at Hogwarts. Ginny had been sneaking her way down to the kitchens (Information she had squeezed out of the twins in exchange for not telling mum about their Potions grades (dreadful because they never went to lessons)) for a late evening snack. She tickled the pear and cracked the portrait hole open, then paused when she heard human voices. She didn’t really want to have to gorge on jammy toast in front of Slytherin’s, so she squinted through the crack to see who it was.
Harry rubbed a hand over his face harshly. “That’s what I’ve been thinking the whole time.” He muttered.
That was the first time Hermione ever saw Harry cry. She hoped that every time afterwards would be for equally happy occasions.
She cuffed his hair lightly and rolled her eyes “Trial period Potter. I reserve the right to back out of your ridiculousness at any time”
Harry headed up the stairs, so only Ginny was present to hear Hermione mutter to herself “Or so much worse”
Neville sat down to wait, as Harry went off chatting happily to the snake down a side tunnel. Neville wondered bizarrely if Harry would miss the snake. Only Harry potter would make a friend out of a mythical beast of olde.
“Wotcher, Nev.” She said, voice monotone. Neville noticed a few empty glasses around her. She didn’t seem drunk, but maybe that was because Neville had only witnessed Sirius Black and his uncle truly drunk and they both became astoundingly exuberant on the stuff.
The general election would be in two days, on Thursday. She’d received many a pompous lecture from Percy on the candidates and magical political climate. She’d also helped Draco make a “Vote for Bones” Poster which he stuck in the entrance hall. It got taken down after only an hour by McGonagall however because apparently the school was supposed to be a politically neutral environment.
They’d filled Draco and Ron in on the situation, but Hermione had noted that Harry hadn’t told them about his seeing powers. Despite Harry’s pretty convincing observations about her own life, she wasn’t one hundred percent convinced about it herself. The problem was that she couldn’t think of a solution that made any more sense.
“I assure you Hermione- if we don’t do something about him then he could cause a lot more pain than he’s worth”
He couldn’t comprehend it. That war had taken over the sleepy, provincial routine of their world without them noticing at all. Now it was shocking them starkly awake.
There is a life I find tucked next to a bookend. It is nothing special in its size, perhaps a meagre fifty years. It is unbound.
Another red tie. Bravery seeped deep into strong bones. He was never offered greatness by a magic hat, this boy bleeds red and gold.
Neville laughed darkly, “I meant I was a little bit worried you were going to off yourself accidentally,” He gave a wry smile, “On account of you being kind of an idiot.”
Harry shook his head, lips parted in confusion. “Don’t they realise that this will come back to hurt wizards? If this is Volde—”
“Ahhh” Luna said knowingly and Ginny was already grinning in anticipation “Daddy says that Gilderoy Lockhart is actually a spy for the ministry. Apparently, he’s just a whole swarm of Busybody Bats in robes with a wig on top”
Neville shrugged, “No. but I will tell Dumbledore.” He frowned, “Actually, scratch that. I’ll tell Ginny.”
Hermione often went on about what she called The System. Luna was usually inclined to agree with her opinions, but wished Hermione’s opinions didn’t so regularly come as a side-dish to her marmalade toast.
Fred and Ron shared a look of worry. Dad only ever snapped at their mother in the direst of situations.
Harry and Hermione exchanged another loaded look. Ron saw a decision pass between them, their faces both resolving, then Hermione lent forward and began packing her books from the coffee table.
“I hope that dreadful uncle of yours isn’t staying this year” Harry said protectively. Neville, if possible, went even redder. Harry was the only one who could achieve that shade on him.
Ron could see that there was a blush blooming under her brown skin. He was also aware that he was gaping like an idiot.
Harry and Ron burst out of a tapestry, giggling. Hermione followed at a more sedate pace, rolling her eyes.
“You don’t think that is important?” Dumbledore said, slightly incredulous. Neville had never seen the headmaster show so much emotion.
Harry shook his head frantically. Hermione guessed that this was his weird distrust of Draco coming into play. “No. No we should do this while everyone’s at the feast.”
Neville had gotten hardly any way down the corridor when Harry turned the corner. Harry frowned at him for a moment. “Nev.” He said simply.
Minister Bones gave regular addresses on the wireless about the situation. She sounded tense and drawn out. Susan was being hounded by all sides to see if she had any insider information. So much so that she had been given a ministry escort to her classes.
Harry laughed bitterly, and then walked into the house, his steps creaking ominously on the felled door. They followed. Ginny rubbed at her arms which, despite being covered by a school cardigan and it being June, had come out in goose bumps.
Careful cut outs of his and Dean’s comics appeared regularly pinned to the Gryffindor corkboard. Ron suspected Ginny in some strange younger sister pride thing.
The thing let out a frog like croak, like it hadn’t spoken in years, before addressing Harry, “Kreacher is serving you, Master. Though he is not knowing you at all.”
They devolved into an argument about wedding themes (“We cannot dedicate our wedding to your ‘lord and saviour’ David Bowie.” “The hell we can’t!”) with Harry butting in with teasing remarks every now and then.
They all dug in to their gifts and by the time they had finished a fresh fall of decimated wrapping paper littered the living room carpet. “This can be Kreacher’s present” Sirius said with a toothy grin.
She was highly intelligent, a Ravenclaw, a beautiful woman and an inventor from a young age. And odd. Precocious, sure, as any intelligent child ought to be. But too persistent. Insistent. Absolute. She knew what she thought, and she wasn’t going to change that for anybody. She was slightly too loud, too brash and too mouthy to be the perfect pureblood daughter. She embarrassed them at dinner parties and at Selwyn extended family events. She was a child of the sixties who embraced muggle culture- she wore tie-dye and corduroy instead of robes.
Hermione considered this for a moment. She sort of wanted to tell him no seen as it was indirectly his fault that she’d used up her first one so fast. Eventually she shrugged and passed him the green one and a biro. “Here, Harry. Consider it an early Christmas present.” She frowned. “Just don’t plan a murder in it.” She frowned harder. “Just don’t implicate me
She held out her hands to pause them after they’d arrived back at the shrieking shack “Why were you in my bedroom last year? I know you took something, I just don’t know what”
She and Hermione had grown closer in their stay. Luna had often felt that Hermione was close-minded, and she knew that Hermione in return saw her as supercilious. But as they spent more time together one-on-one Luna began to understand the older girl more. Hermione had a softer side, one that was egregiously hidden by a thick membrane of self-protection and insecurity. It wasn’t a refusal to believe in the outlandish that had her judging Luna, it was a refusal to believe in the outlandish- or anything at all- without proof. Hermione looked at the whole world as a court room with she as the constantly deliberating jury.
Ron looked at him incredulously. It was a few hours before sunset, but the light was already dimming, blanketing the campsite with a dim mellow light. A haze of campfire smoke hung languidly over them. Harry was sprawled on a roll mat he’d dragged next to the fire. They’d been chatting nonsense since early afternoon, Ron’s brothers and a amused Hermione interjecting periodically.
Below it was a sign-up sheet sprawled with names. She could see all of her brothers had signed up, as well as a good quantity of the upper years.
Two adults appeared then, having walked towards them at a far more sedate pace. The woman had her hair in multiple small delicate braids, which she in turn had tied neatly behind her head. The man was tall and balding. They both wore spectacles and had a kind, though slightly baffled, expression.
The elf vanished with out a crack but Hermione hardly had the chance to open her mouth and ask a question before he was bag, holding what looked like a parcel of old, crushed black velvet.
Fred picked up a frankly sickening purple and orange one giddily “Hey, George what about-?” and then they were off in the corner talking in excited whispers. Neville left to listen to Hermione and Ginny dissect a pretty floral dress.
Ginny shrugged. She had a free first period so was eating her porridge at a leisurely pace. “It’ll be me next year.” She said around her spoon. “Plus, knowing Harry he’ll get exams cancelled for you.”
“Strong start to the year.” Iphigenia Watts said with a smile, passing them each an edition of the paper. She came to Harry last, “I’d worried people would have—"
Ginny didn’t look satisfied, but let it go anyway. They all spread out across the floor, Ron and Hermione clustered close together as usual despite their constant bickering. Ginny took a spot to Luna’s left Neville sat on her right, knees pulled up awkwardly to his chest. It would take a few hours, as usual, for Neville’s base level of anxiety to chill and for him to relax.  Draco pushed Harry until he shifted over, and flopped next to him on the giant bean bag, draping his legs over Harry.
In one version, Harry Potter lives to tell the tale. He marries the girl, he has the children. He lives to a pleasant old age and he dies in his bed. He is content.
They’d had three rather marvellous days under Granger hospitality so far. Hermione’s mum and dad had been exceptionally pleased that Hermione had already made such strong friends, though of course a little baffled that they were all boys. The Granger’s professions certainly supplemented a big enough house so that Harry and Ron could sleep in the spare room, which calmed Patrick Granger’s nerves about the whole situation.
Harry and Hermione exchanged looks “These bones could be used for something much, much worse than us digging them up and vanishing them”
“How do you think Durmstrang will get here?” Draco said with uncharacteristic excitement at breakfast the Monday before the other schools were set to arrive.
“She told me that the thing’s we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end” Luna said finally, voice steady if not strong.
Christmas was a strange affair, then. Odd days of sitting sequestered in one of the bedrooms or trapped outside in the yard.
I awoke stolen in this hall of mirrors. I know nothing else. I breath and I run and I stare at the stretched reflections of a lonely boy and try to find meaning in a narrative that does not care.
Diagon Alley was as packed and swarming as it had been her whole life. Posters proclaimed colourfully about new inventions, special deals and sales. Hawkers stood outside packed shops waving parchment flyers and shouting happily that they could “Buy one jar of powdered frog, get a gnats head free!”. She could see even from the entrance to the high-street that Flourish and Blotts was overflowing. There was a long skating line going all the way to Quality Quidditch Supplies.
“Nothing happened in first year.” Hermione said unconvincingly, her voice two octaves higher than usual.
They let a few moments slip by in silence, a quiet funeral for something none of them quite understood. Perhaps it was the unknowable concept of childhood, lost to each of them as they resolved to fight a war no one else even knew about.
Although not as striking and impossibly handsome as his soon-to-be husband, Neville couldn’t lie and say that Professor Lupin hadn’t cleaned up smartly. His own waistcoat was gold, matching his sandy colouring perfectly. He looked suffused in a warm light, even his terrible scars softened and over shadowed. He wasn’t wearing eyeliner, but he did have a lovely red poppy in his buttonhole.
I don’t have many of those anymore, not like the nights after the war where sleep deprivation was a better alternative to the images that haunted my dreams. The ones where I always jolted awake with a scream. It got easier to control them and I learnt how to fall asleep again. But every once in a while, one creeps through my subconscious; on those nights I still startle awake, a silent scream on my lips as I tense and wait for an attack.
He's still trying to explain his point when a tiny flash goes off, making Harry blink to dispel the flashing light still blinding him. As he clears his head, the flash having sobered him faster than he would have liked, he catches Malfoy hiding a small smile behind his glass.
“Listen,” Draco says, wrapping his scarf around his neck, “Scorpius has been begging to meet the puppy. Can I bring him by tomorrow?”
Professor Sprout had been ecstatic the first time he’d managed to coax the Blue Barks to bloom, the finicky plants needing specific ratios of water to sunlight in order to survive. Sparse with her praise—all Draco had received was a pat on the back and a “Good going, lad,”—Sprout bombarded him with suggestions, but they were enough to make him feel like all the quick trips between classes to regulate the plant’s shade were worth it.
With the case wrapped up and paperwork done, Emma invited everyone over for a dinner party. “We deserve it,” she had exclaimed, high-fiving Bronan. Draco had been in two minds about going, not sure if he wanted to crash the team dinner. Emma, however, seemed to have foreseen Draco’s reluctance and had sent Draco an owl every hour till he finally confirmed.
Harry folds his arms on the edge of the bathtub and rests his head on them, giving Draco his full attention as he undresses. Draco takes his time, neatly folding each article of clothing, but Harry isn’t complaining, it gives him more time to admire his husband’s broad shoulders, the curve of his spine and those hip bones he’s spent hours marking.
“We even have dinner together like Bill’s family!” he had exclaimed, his attention then entirely on Draco and Harry rather than his broom, showing
Another reason why he kept coming back to the classroom, despite his attempts to find a better, warmer pit stop during his nightly walks, was the view from the windows. It was directly facing the lake, the moon reflecting off the surface casting a soft shimmer across the water, enough to make Draco pause and stare. He had spent hours curled up next to the windows, lukewarm cup of tea in hand as he gazed across the forest, thoughts calming enough to let him
I know Draco’s knackered, he’s had a long week at work and I should let him sleep. This is why I have no intention of waking him up.
At Scorpius’s eager nod he catches Draco’s eye and bends slowly, till his face is level with Draco’s neck. Even from this distance he can catch hints of something earthy, with an underlying muskiness that makes Harry’s stomach jump.
Harry trails off as Malfoy smacks his lips in his sleep, his pale eyelashes trembling against his cheek as he dreams. He tells himself it’s not creepy if he’s only looking to make sure that Malfoy isn’t having a nightmare.
The classroom was almost barren, save for a few broken desks that he’d spent the first night piling into the corner. He hadn’t planned on coming back, satisfied that he’d somewhat attempted to clear things out before moving on to his nightly excursions around the castle. The next night, however, he found himself once again carefully climbing across the rubble strewn along the corridor to enter the classroom.
The puppy name shall be revealed tomorrow! Thank you for all the suggestions, I have so many wonderful options to choose from now. ♥
Draco tries to take another bite of his chicken but gives up instantly when he starts to feel queasy. As he helps Teddy clear the table, making sure the child isn’t trying to handle the heavier plates like he once did, Draco wonders if he’s coming down with a stomach bug. It would explain the random bouts of nausea and exhaustion.
It appears Muggle, there are no wards protecting it, only an electric alarm that’s easy to dismantle. Harry marches in, paying no heed to Malfoy, who seems conflicted for reasons Harry can’t, and doesn’t want to fathom.
“Get undressed,” Draco calls over his back, rolling his eyes at Harry’s brightened expression. “For a
Maybe it has to do with the way the curtains are fluttering slightly in the windows, making the moonlight cast shadows along Draco’s lean back. The sheets are bundled near the foot of the bed, the night too warm to even consider covering up, or even wearing clothes.
He was ready for a quiet thank you, maybe one of those rare smiles that make Harry’s heart skip a beat.
They walk Scorpius to school, Draco forcing his tears back as Scorpius heads inside the class cautiously, a young man in a bowtie bending down to shake hands with him and show him where to put his bag. Within minutes Scorpius is playing with two boys across the room, each of them pretending to be a Power Ranger.
Thirty seconds before the fire consumes them, Harry Potter realises that he is in love with Draco Malfoy.
“I’ll buy you two more,” Blaise placates him, swinging his legs as he takes in Draco’s office. Though office is a misnomer perhaps, it’s nothing more than a glorified storage room. There are towering piles of boxes, balanced precariously against each other. Scrolls upon scrolls of aging parchments can be found in every corner of the room. The only clear space in the room is the path from the door to Draco’s chair. Dressed in his expensive tailored suit, Draco knows he stands out amongst the piles of dusty old scrolls, the musty smell now a permanent feature of the room. But for the first time in his life he’s feeling like he’s where he belongs, there’s a sense of satisfaction in his job that he’s never experienced before and for now, that’s enough.
I couldn't stop if I wanted to.  The urge to taste him again makes me lick a long stripe again. And again. His arsehole is covered in my spit and spunk, marking him as mine. I reach one hand to give my cock a quick squeeze to take off the pressure.
When the summons come, Draco walks into the room with his head held high. He doesn’t flinch as the curse hits him; as consciousness fades away, he hopes that Potter makes the bastard suffer.
“Right, okay.” Draco wondered if Potter was slightly delirious. He’d heard a lack of sleep could do that. “Anyway,” he continued on before Potter could ramble some more, “did you sleep well here?”
Harry chuckles as Draco wraps an arm around Albus and pulls him back just as he’s about to slip off and fall. “No, we didn’t. But we did manage to find where they are.”
As far as timing goes, it’s not the most perfect situation and really, fate does seem to be holding some sort of vendetta against him, but at least he will die knowing that he’s in love with someone.
Teddy spends Halloween with them, the five year old excited to celebrate with his classmates from kindergarten.
Draco moves closer till he's almost laying on Harry. It's warm, and Harry's sure his right leg is close to losing all feeling having been in one position for so long. He doesn't care though, dragging a hand softly up Draco's side till he can curve his palm around Draco's waist and pull him even closer.
He closes the remaining distance and presses his lips to Harry’s, he knows he’s rougher than usual, biting and sucking with more fervour than ever before, but he hasn’t felt this wound up in a long time and he knows that only Harry can bring him down. Harry places his other hand on Draco’s lower back, uses it to bring Draco forward till they are moving against each other, creating a delicious friction that makes Draco ache for more. As if hearing his unspoken plea, Harry slides his hand under Draco’s trousers, curving it around Draco arse. Draco whimpers, making Harry tighten his hold and Draco can’t help it anymore. He breaks away, taking in the sight of Harry’s flushed cheeks and red, slick lips.
He didn’t give them the silent treatment. He just turned the volume down. Also, because he was emotionally intelligent but certainly not emotionally mature, he made a pointed effort to be as normal and full volume as possible with everyone who wasn’t them.
“And Ronniekins says you’re excellent.” Fred said, grinning and passing Neville a pair of goggles too. Neville saw far too many explosions in that short week, but he did leave with a list of tasks and the inklings of experiments he had been ordered to explore and report back to them. Neville wondered ominously if he had accidentally signed his soul to the devil without knowing.
Harry grinned, moving forward and pushing down the handle on the door. They followed behind, Hermione still not entirely sure she believed Harry.
Tonks scrunched her nose at him, her hair darkening a shade or two to indigo. “Yeah that was the plan.” She sighed. “Unfortunately mad-eye decided he isn’t going to retire this year, actually, which is all well and good except he decided this, like, two days ago and so the compromise for Dumbles- I mean Professor Dumbledore,” Tonks’ cheeks went as bubble gum pink as her hair, “Well, I got sent.”
Two hours later, after the unsettling reveal of the Grown-Man-Trapped-In-A-Box who was possibly a murder suspect, a drawn-out discussion that Harry had looked bored throughout, and the arrival of a myriad of ministry officials, Hermione and Harry were finally off to bed.
She still thought often about Hermione and Harry’s odd behaviour. In fact, a few more occasions had fanned the flames of her curiosity.
Neville stood only a few metres away, transfixed. Harry’s lips were moving but no sound came out. His wand was moving in odd patterns, conducting to an empty orchestra.  Neville’s heart raced. Maybe the spell would fail. Maybe Harry could control it.
Harry passed her an identical present, square and neatly wrapped with her name printed on it. She smiled at him in thanks.
Luna enjoyed the banal routines that took place in Grimmauld; Sitting at the kitchen table while Remus made hot chocolate on the stove; Playing card games in the dining room in the evening; Getting ready for bed beside Hermione; The chaotic rush of meal prep.
Ginny and Luna exchanged a look, obviously having missed something here, and then broke off into their own conversation when the odd quartet began an impassioned debate about—
And then Harry was in front of him, screaming into his face. But Neville couldn’t hear it, his head was under water. Under flames. He was going to die down here. Swallowed by a blazing green fire dragon.
Harry seemed excited to pull Neville along everywhere, especially. “Can’t believe you’ve lived in London your whole life and never been to the muggle parts,” he scolded in disbelief.
He held it out to Harry preciously. “Regulus be giving his life for his locket.” He said mournfully. Hermione desperately wanted to know who this Regulus was.
Fleur smiled at her charmingly, “I am focused on the spell making theory. Partially philosophical and functional, also. I am very interested in the ontological approach to spell making.”
But the terrible, horrible, very wrong thought of Harry and Hermione in some grand secret romance made something painful and vitally important clench in Ron’s chest. It made something rage. Because-
Luna thinks that Peter Pettigrew is half bitterness. Like if you cut him in half he’d have rings like a tree and they’d grow blacker and blacker until you got to the very last one and that one would be rotten. He makes Luna’s skin crawl.
They stayed silent for a while after that, two boys whose families had been torn apart by a war they were too young to remember. Harry thinking of green eyes and a kind man casting lights into the air to make a baby laugh. Neville thinking of sweet wrappers and stories of intense bravery and competence he could never hop to replicate.
“Where are you getting this stuff from?” Dean said, chuckling, as he sketched Barry Blotter (who had curly black hair and glasses but definitely wasn’t Harry in anyway at all) hiding a baby dragon under his robes in a grand plot to sneak it to Romania. Puffs of smoke were trailing out of the collar and sleeves and singed holes appeared across the shirt. Barry’s loyal sidekicks Ermintrude and Rick were peeping out from around a corner, looking comically wide eyes with their own singe marks. It was an excellent drawing.
Harry did his hissing thing again, then there was the sound of stone scraping against stone. Harry grabbed her hand to guide her “Come on” He said, helping her step through the circular door way.
Harry nodded gravely and took the parcel from him. “Thank you, Kreacher. Regulus would be very proud of you.”
“Professor,” Harry said with an unneeded amount of glee, “I have conquered an enemy of the light and now bring him to you! Behold.”
Draco watched him unhappily for a few more moments. “You’re one of my best friends, Ron,” He said, which was honestly more emotion than Ron had been expecting, “But I’m not ruining my train journey with your sulk. Come find us when you’ve gotten over it.”
Hermione and Ron shared a look, and then nodded. Split up and look for clues it was then. It was a good thing she’d always held Velma as a sort of personal hero.
“You’re a good egg, Nevvy.” She said, a slight slur to her voice. “And no. I am,” She took a dramatic pause, “Love sick.”
The train ride was sombre. Hogwarts had been sombre for days, but not for the same reasons Ron was. The castle was in mourning for the Wizards who had lost their lives, and while Ron mourned them too it was Pettigrew’s lifeless, mangled corpse that haunted him.
Tonks didn’t seem offended, just shrugged magnanimously. “I qualified as an Auror two years ago. Been under Mad-Eyes tutelage that whole time.”
“You don’t think it’s a ministry cover-up, do you?” Ginny asked giddily, completely unaware of Bellatrix’ significance.
“What are you doing?” She demanded, hands on hips. If she was acting just a little bit too much like her mother- well. The apple didn’t fall too far from the very intimidating tree.
On Christmas night, after a full day of not getting out of their pyjamas and eating much too much food, Sirius finally declared that it was time to open presents.
The day Ginny achieved what she’d been working for since that day in her bedroom last summer was an ordinary Friday. Until, quite abruptly, it wasn’t.
The plan had come together finally the second time they’d visited the bank. Neville had come alone at the end of the Christmas holidays because he knew his grandmother had a vault in the lower levels of the bank. He’d ummed and ahhed over his grandmothers’ things (mainly antique chairs with faded upholstery) counting silently until he’d finally heard the sounds of another cart fly past.
“Well sorry I wasn’t born magical, Ronald.” Hermione snapped. “Some of us don’t know what’s happening at all times.” She said pointedly at harry.
He seemed pretty nervous about admitting this, as if he had broken some intense code of Herbology ethics. This was probably a reasonable reaction as Ron immediately whooped and declared they were going to the greenhouses.
“Luna dear, is that you?” A warm voice asked. Luna looked up to find Molly Weasley standing above her, arms full of brown paper bags, with a concerned smile on her face.
. But I’m sure they’ll invent it soon." before going on to tell Ron of the wonders of electric trains.
When they reached a stretch of corridor that didn’t seem any more notable apart from the pretty cool tapestry of dancing trolls, Harry called them to a halt. “Here.”
“Merlin, no.” Fred grinned, getting up to do the test all over again, “The family price is a ten percent
But they weren’t Gryffindors. And there was a little- and not really that little at all when you got right to it- part of Neville that missed it, when he wasn’t surrounded by that burning fiery singlemindedness. There was a little part of Neville that couldn’t help finding the Hufflepuffs, well, dull. Not unfriendly, not uninteresting, desperately kind, but no spark. No sharpness.
Sirius had been released by the ministry under conditions, Harry told them. He had to report to his probation officer weekly and couldn’t leave the country. A lock had been placed on his wand so that he would only be able to use minor spells. He wouldn’t be completely exonerated of his crimes and allowed to live a free life until Peter had been given a trial and officially convicted of the crime. Harry informed her that Dumbledore had fought for this situation, as the ministry had wanted to keep Sirius in prison until the trial was over, even though that could take months. It was the only time Hermione had seen Harry look anything but wary towards the headmaster.
“Nope” Sirius said, popping the ‘P’ “And instead of lousy France you get the unrefined Lupin-Black Holiday experience. C’est la vie! Strap in kids”
He spent some time with Seamus and Dean, but they were so insular that it was hard to spend a prolonged amount of time with them before developing a complex or a migraine.
He cut off and waved his hand emphatically as if to encompass both ‘dark attack’ and ‘ministry scandal’. Draco winced again, probably because it was widely believed that his dad had somehow been involved.
She needed to find out what he was hiding. Then she needed to make him one hundred percent better at whatever it was before it got him seriously injured. Or worse. Ex
Malfoy looked slightly stumped but was once again cut off before he could respond. This time, however, by a gaping Ron.
Ron was sat on a desk in the Oracle office, legs swinging beneath him. It was only a week before the end of term. Ron had tagged along with Luna and Ginny to watch his latest addition of The Adventures of Barry Blotter (This time Ermintrude, Rick and Barry were fighting dementors and murderers and werewolves, oh my!)
Ginny could remember being told about fae, who were seen as half fiction and half fact by many wizards and who had supposedly gone extinct long before the time of Merlin. She knew that that was why wizards often still hung iron horseshoes above their doors or wore iron jewellery if they were particularly suspicious.
“Well to start I suppose we should go inside” Harry said, his brown skin looking almost pale. Hermione grabbed his hand and gave him a reassuring nod. She wasn’t smiling, though she didn’t look scared.
Hermione went to the edge of the room, and beckoned Ginny to follow. Ginny’s back was pressed to the inside of the chilled stone walls. Harry pointed a wand at the floor, paused and then looked at them.
That’s what Harry had said of Sirius Black. She wondered if it was a good idea to enter a convicted murderers house without permission. Even if the conviction was more likely than not wrongful. She just sighed and followed Harry anyway. This was becoming a bad habit.
This boy cuts the air he walks through. This boy walks through life like he is tearing through tissue paper. He knows too much, and too little. He knows everything, and it keeps him lonely.
“Do you have feelings for me?” Harry asked, sounding fragile. Neville finally looked at him. He was staring at Neville with fear. Neville wondered what he was so afraid of.
“We’re the perfect people for it.” Remus said, “Our kid’s at school, we don’t have full time jobs and we can live off of Sirius’ fortune for the next three lifetimes.”
It was mid-December and Neville was still riding high off of the letter he’d recently received confirming, because he hadn’t been sure, that Sirius and Remus expected him back for Christmas break.
Harry blinked, shifting about nervously. In fact, Hermione was pretty sure he hadn’t stood still at all through out this exchange. Just continually twitched oddly.
Harry snorted from where he was camped in the chair by Draco’s bed, not looking up from a miscellaneous copy of Witch Weekly that he’d scrounged to read. “She’s got a point, Malfoy. I can’t believe you did it,
Harry bit his lip, running a hand through his already messy hair. “I need help finding a lost thing.”
And on top of all that, Harry and Ron refused to stop yacking to him about quidditch despite the first match going swimmingly.
Luna stared into his eyes for a moment longer, trying to figure out the mystery that was Harry Potter. She sighed.
“It’s like, a resistance group for the good side,” Harry explained, waving his hands in the air awkwardly, “They had it in the last war. All our parents were part of it,” He scrunched his nose up, “Well, apart from yours Draco.”
” and Ron snaps back, “Not in centuries Hermione.” and then Hermione looks at Harry with intense worry and Ron doesn’t know where all the tension is coming from but the fact that he doesn’t know causes resentment to bubble in his chest.
Hermione giggled. All of the Weasley children did some variation of a groaning embarrassed blush. Molly went pink about the ears. “This is my Husband Arthur” She said, in the voice of all embarrassed spouses everywhere.
“Leave it to Remus Lupin to be sarcastic even when I’m proposing to you” Sirius joked and Lupin gasped out a choked laugh
They were children playing in their parent’s world, blindsided by the shadows they cast on every wall.
While in the cubicle Hermione could swear she heard the sound of stone scraping against stone. She really hoped to harry wasn’t destroying school property while she was present.
“They’re decreasing the number by two.” Ron said, frowning, “If it’s a ritual that must have something to do with it.”
The pair would also often find themselves in spiralling conversations about tiny minutiae that had Ron and Harry groaning and calling order to the table. No accounting for taste with those too, honestly.
“Remus--” Harry said, worked up. But the mirror suddenly stopped glowing red. The Professor was gone.
When Hermione stopped her chanting, they all watched with lips tight as the Goblin slowly blinked his way into awareness.
Luna agreed with this. The wireless never even played anything good. She hadn’t heard David Bowie on there even once.
Harry stepped back, embarrassed but seemingly unwilling to go to far from the man. As Hermione and Ron had descended the stairs to join the group in the hallway, Hermione could see the glistening tears beginning to form in Harry’s eyes. The two men also looked slightly damp around the eyes.
The newspaper met them sombrely on Tuesday morning, the first day of class after Christmas break. It did not at all seem an appropriate end to their rather lovely yule tide and near year celebrations.
“Next time, eh Weasley?” He’d said, before asking Ron’s opinion on some famous Chess controversy or something else Hermione had no interest in.
Neville couldn’t stand it. Harry, Ron and Hermione hadn’t returned to the common room at all that afternoon. He fled the crimson room, walking swiftly through the castle. Something unruly was simmering in his chest. He felt as if he were full of some strange adrenaline, and yet also as if he was stock still. Frozen in churning movement.
The rest of the conversation continued on into small talk and gossiping about mutual friends, but Ginny was hardly listening to any of it.
The door was unlocked when Harry went to open it. She supposed you didn’t much have to worry about crime when your house was literally invisible to anyone who didn’t know it was there.
“It is.” Harry said sharply, brooking no argument. Remus and Sirius exchanged a concerned look and Ron wondered for the first time how much they suspected of Harry’s behaviour.
As the great wizard pointed his wand at the shoebox, Hermione could tell he was desperately hoping that Harry was simply crazy.
“It’s so weird being in the stands.” Harry muttered on the day of the first task, so only Ron and Hermione could here. Hermione smirked at him and Ron rolled his eyes.
Neville started up, his footsteps too loud on the stone. His blood pounded in his ears. Why was he so nervous? Harry, Hermione and Ron were school children. It wasn’t as if he were about to walk into a secret lair of- of what? Children’s bones? Mad experiments? Plans to overthrow the government?
She lets the memory wash over and into her. Luna is four years old and her mother is singing Joni Mitchell to her in her laboratory and inventing a spell she says will save the world and everything is okay, and Luna has never known anything but peace.
To be fair Luna had been pretty shaken when Flitwick had entered their peaceful common room (peaceful by Ravenclaw standards; meaning at least three heated debates were taking place complete with encyclopaedias to both support points made and slam angrily closed in frustration) and announced that they were all being moved to the Great Hall for the night while the castle was searched. Peter Pettigrew had been spotted outside Gryffindor tower, screaming dementedly at the fat lady and brandishing a silver dagger. When he’d spotted his witnesses he’d apparently vanished into thin air, causing many screams and calls for help.
Harry lingered. The other two occupants of the table and Hermione herself stared at him in shock. Harry never spent any more time in a room with Snape than he needed to.
Neville shuddered, looking at his surroundings with a suspicion. Maybe Harry’s secret Chimera bestie would pop around the corner any moment.
Tonks was walking beside them, ostensibly as a guardian though Tonks couldn’t manage to seem authoritarian if she tried, chatting away.
But this was another thing that she learned under her thoughts, knowing without knowing that she knew. What she did know was that when she woke up the next morning, her world was brighter and clearer than it had ever been before. As if something that had been possessing her had finally let her go.
There is a boy who loved with ice and cruelty and a girl that loved with silent reverence and so much strength. The boy who lived overshadowed and the girl that drifted in Dreamland.
The plan came together in increments. With Hermione practically abusing Kreacher with the amount of times she asked him politely to discreetly bring her more tea.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck, looking sheepish. “I’ve lived this before. Sort of. Not this, specifically. I, uh, wasn’t time travelling last time.”
Joy welled up in Luna’s chest. The displaced cat resettled itself on her knee and she clutched at it gently.
Hermione sort of hoped that the Malfoy boy would take this as a reason to leave. That was, until her eyes finally landed on the title of the book in the boys’ hands.
Hermione was going to unpick that statement later. In that moment she said “Where did you die?” instead.
“We need to find Neville.” Was all Ron said, passing the letter to the Slytherin girl and bolting from the room, Ginny and Luna hot on his heels.
Neville let out a squeak, quickly tying the cloth around his eyes. He was suddenly plunged into a strange yellow-y blindness. “There’s a basilisk down here?”
“Sound good?” Harry said. The twins whooped loudly and everyone else made murmurs of agreement “Cool. Today Oliver and Percy have agreed to show us the stunning charm”
When Harry did finally stop chanting, it felt as if they shared the same held breath. They watched the flames. They weren’t tame, but they w
A week after Halloween is when the crystallised sugar castle of friendships and joy melts around Luna’s feet dismally. Peter Pettigrew breaks into Hogwarts.
By Christmas morning Ron had seen the appeal of the castle at yule time. He didn’t know if it was extra festive for the visiting schools, but the excessive Christmas festivities reminded Ron of story books. He could hardly stop smiling all day, laughing at terrible Christmas cracker jokes and Fred and George’s good-natured pranks, reminiscing with his friends, listening to teachers’ stories and stuffing himself on so much food it almost put Molly Weasley’s Christmases to shame. Almost.
“I hope no one gets hurt,” Neville said quietly, thinking of the manic in the student’s eyes and the crushing crowd he could see.
Ron had come to her mid-way through November and told her to stop following Harry around because it was creepy.
The group exchanged intrigued glances, before filling out of Hermione’s bedroom door and onto the landing. Harry, who’d left first, froze stock still at the top of the stairs causing Ron to slam into his back. Hermione peered over his shoulder
Ginny clutched her new pewter cauldron slightly closer to her chest. She’d never been worried by crowds, but it seemed almost as if there was five people to an inch inside the bookshop. Luna made a funny face had her and Ginny giggled, relaxing slightly. Mum took them to wait in the line to meet Gilderoy and have him sign their books.
Hermione lifted her wand, took a deep breath, and wiped the goblins memories. Then she closed her eyes, her wand swaying back and forth in her hand, and created new ones.
“All I remember about my parents is a green light” Harry said quietly “There are lost of things I know, but that’s the only thing I actually remember”
It was half hidden by the trees, but what they could see of it made her certain that it was uninhabited and had likely been abandoned for a while. The walls- who’s original colour was indiscernible- were blanketed thickly in moss, and the moss itself was almost hidden by a towering wall of nettles, which reached almost to the roof. The roof itself hardly deserved the name. Most of the rafters were visible and clearly close to rotting away. A few sad shingles clung here and there, like a bald man combing a single hair over his head. The front door was broken, as if it had been kicked, and a rusty iron nail stuck out from it- something long ago rotted clinging in shrivelled tendrils to it.
Hermione at first appeared to be alone in the library, tucked away in her favourite corner with the comfiest chairs Ron knew she loved. This wasn’t odd. It was a sunny Saturday afternoon after all. Not many other people were thinking about revision.
Anyway, usually it’s just her and mum in the house so there wouldn’t be anything to eavesdrop on. It’s been weird ever since Hogwarts got out in June. Suddenly there are all these people around the house. And sure, they
“I’m leaning towards yes,” Harry said, with the same academic voice, “But one must exhaust all possibilities.”
. Even if Hermione’s rants over ran the hour mark. Or ended up on topics seemingly entirely unrelated to her starting point.
“Luna” Xenophilius Lovegood called from inside the kitchen “Will you go down to the village and collect my parcel from the post office? It’s my ink and I’ll be running out soon, my love”
Neville didn’t believe Harry was an entirely moral person. He knew him as a person who could do bad things. But he did trust him. He did.
It couldn’t hurt. Just to go up through the tapestry. It would be a shortcut, wither way. And if he found some clue, some errant piece of evidence- Well. That was only a secondary benefit.
Harry looked honestly upset with himself. “Look, I know. I’m being a really bad friend. It’s just—I haven’t got anyone else.”
Ron looked at him thoughtfully, bubbles of happiness and love crowding in his stomach. He decided to let it go, turning to cheer along with everyone else as Cedric was greeted by a Swedish Short-Snout.
Neville held her slightly away from him, looking down at her incredulously, “Really? The boys and I thought it would take ages longer than that.”
“No,” Harry said, whirling on him as if Neville had said anything other than his name, “It was supposed to be better with her! She was a better minister. And now she’s
i'm heading off to uni on friday so i'll keep up a steady pace of writing but it could be a slower update just a heads up.
“No. Not the village” Harry said, snapping his eyes away and continuing down the sloping path “Not yet”
The boy never makes it very far. Sometimes he flickers out in a mist of light the colour of his mother's eyes. Sometimes he bleeds as crassly as mere muggles. Bumps and bruises and breaks. A human death. Some times he gets far enough to fight diseases they can't cure. These are the worlds where he is raised my Lily and James. They are sweet to him. He always dies anyway.
boxed into any of the houses, but the idea that they would ever stop being friends was ludicrous. “Of course, I’ll still be your friend. Why wouldn’t I be your friend?”
Peter Pettigrew lay dead in a heap at the gates of Hogwarts castle, body twisted demonically. His eyes were staring up at the blue sky, no longer watery and beady as they had been. Now they were blank.
Ginny’s eyes lit up and anxiety bubbled in Luna’s stomach. “What are you and Hermione always whispering about?”
Harry took a moment to shake himself out of his reverie, but then looked up with a grimace. This one less emotional and more of the scolded child who knows he’s done something wrong and he’s about to be told off.
He sneered “I hope they’re paying you well for all those raids at the ministry, Weasley” He grabbed a book from Ginny’s cauldron before she could stop him, holding up a battered school book. Ginny flushed “Obviously not. What’s the point—”
And yet Ron suspected that he would never have an ordinary life again. In fact he suspected he had never actually had a normal life to begin with, even before a smiling Harry had burst into his train compartment.
Ginny stared at the paper in shock, and then peered down the table to where Harry was sat with his three ever present shadows. Draco was brandishing a paper in Harry’s face wildly, looking frantic. Hermione had her head on the table, her hair forming a cloud which threatened to encroach on the jam pot. Her brother just looked like he’d completely lost the plot.
Ron had been unable to comfort his best friend, too consumed with trying to breathe through his laughter.
“No one Sirius and Remus would invite would talk to your parents.” Harry said, though he too looked around assessing at the crowd.
Ginny Weasley had decided she was in love with Harry Potter the first time she’d heard the Story. Harry Potter had saved the wizarding world at only 18 months. Harry had defeated you-know-who and had been given a lightning scar for his troubles. Ginny had asked her mother what Harry Potter looked like she had been told that no one knew because he wasn’t ever in the public eye, but she had told Ginny what his parents looked like, who Molly had met at a myriad of wizarding social events when she had been a young woman with only a few children, instead of a quidditch team of them. When Ginny thought of Harry potter she had thought of a boy with caramel-brown skin and red hair just like hers.
“Fuck,” Harry cried now, kicking a wall. Neville and Harry had been alone at breakfast that morning, when the first papers arrived. Harry had stormed off angrily, past sobbing students and terrified Professors, his face a mask of storm clouds.
After they’d all hurriedly abandoned the burning tent it had been chaos. Spells were flying, and there were people flying too. Masked wizards on brooms were attacking form the sky, raining destructive curses down on the camp. Harry had taken one gaping look at the riot and let out a devastated
