"But that's exactly where the crucial difference lies. I thought all that prevented you from dating until now was that you didn't know how to safely out yourself. Now that you've been relieved of that part, nothing stands in the way, or am I too stupid to recognise more obstacles?"
Although Harry would have preferred that his two closest friends hear about the mishap first, his need to talk to someone familiar about it wins out. Cas is the perfect person for this, after all, isn't she already privy to the back story, and has so far proven to be a trustworthy and supportive friend? Besides, nothing really matters now anyway. With an uneasy feeling in his stomach nonetheless, he dismisses Nessaja out of his window again.
Cas has troubles to stifle her laugh. “Harry do you even listen to yourself? Everything you say, makes it more obvious, that meeting again with Drew is a great chance you should take.”
Drew snorts. “I could help you with tha…”
"I like this one", Cas discretely points at a slender young man, bright blond hair tied to a bun, faint of a beard, leaning at a pillar, seemingly checking out the crowd, too.
“It’s not that easy”, he whispers long after she’s stepped into the green fire.
"No, I wanted to give Hermione a chance to indulge in her spontaneous cravings."
Harry considers. He acted, ultimately, from the motive of getting that annoying little voice of Cas's out of his ear. At least that is the reason he holds up to himself in order to be able to leave his actual subconsciously simmering needs and desires untouched for a little longer. But as long as he wants to keep dwelling in this blissful denial, he can’t possibly tell him that.
Harry nods knowingly. He also uses name aliases... and body aliases. Who is he to question someone's motivation to hide their identity.
"Uhh," Harry stammers. "I feel the same when I fly. I think." He turns, becoming aware of Drew's proximity to himself, but also unable to establish any more distance because of the plants behind him, so he has to look up somewhat uncomfortably to make eye contact with Drew. Not the most flattering constellation.
“I don’t know”, Harry huffs. “Probably not through an ad in the Daily Prophet. ‘Secret childhood star seeks discreet partner for lonely hours’. Doesn’t come off too well.”
Since then, however, Ron has not let up, yet to get out of Harry what prompted him to compose a message with such an urgent tone. But with each successive insistence, Harry only plays it down more as a trifle.
“You know, this is considered sexual harassment?”, Harry utters casually and finally covers his legs with his own trousers again. They are a bit loose, as he already knows them to be around his hips, but, Merlin, does it feel good on his skin, on his mind. Interestingly, the degree of coping-ability of awkward circumstances seems to be in direct connection not only with the amount of clothes you’re wearing but also the ownership of them. Straightening his back, squaring his shoulders Harry regains the needed self-confidence to consider himself sufficiently equipped to survive the situation.
"Ah, yeah right. Otherwise we'd probably have met on the field before," Harry muses, oblivious to the way Drew leans against the wall, a touch too emphatically casual. "Did you have a favourite position still?"
“I’d be offended, if you stop now”, Harry unburdens him, accompanied with a pelvic thrust into Drew’s stagnated palm, encouraging it to carry on with whatever it was intending to do.
"What a question? Isn’t that what I am here for? For  you to spill some tea," she says, plopping down on his sofa.
The next morning, he gets down on his knees in front of his fireplace, and attempts to floocall through to Ron and Hermione. His whole body tingles as he calls out several times into the apparent void.
Harry’s then being told more about the plants that have been set up, when he explicitly requests it, his attention being much more focused on the passionately narrating Drew than on the actual content. They linger in the conservatory as long as the sun gives off its last rays, then go back downstairs.
A glance at his watch reveals that by now he can be on his way without turning up unpleasantly early. At first, he had considered taking his broom, not least to have a good excuse for his tangled hair, but the stormy very April like weather decided against it. Instead, he sent Siora again to enquire whether he could Apparate without being dismembered by wards. Dishevelled, but with a positive confirmation, she returned.
He gets up, knees giving in first. He's wearing no pants and has a solid morning wood. Was to be expected, unpleasant nonetheless. He discovers, that discomfort from nudity is much enhanced when it's your real body being exposed. With a wandless "Accio knickers" he aims for remedy, but is again not rewarded. Bloody hangover.
“Mh, just like you proved on the dance floor before? I believe you have a lot of stamina,” Drew notes provocatively. They stand body to body again. Just like on the dance floor before. Harry feels the heat of arousal dwelling up, starting in his chest, crawling slowly to his head.
And so it came about that they had scheduled a date for the afternoon of the very next day. Despite the temporally close proximity from the start, Harry was startled to realise just how soon it was the time to leave. A second check on the clock confirms that it is indeed so. He takes a deep breath, puts on a thin windbreaker - just in case he does have to step outside the front door - and visualises the flat he couldn't leave fast enough just a week ago.
"Just push up," he grins encouragingly.
Harry’s suppresses the need to answer that question as his response would be of nothing but a smug nature, and instead concentrates on the man beneath his fingers. Harry finds, that exploring this certain specimen’s body is a task that actually calls for undivided attention. He can’t tell why, though. Just that he has difficulties to weigh up what to do first. Getting him out off his shirt seems desirable, running his hands over his back just as well. And god, how can he neglect that fine ass Drew himself has any longer?
“One would think you’d be used to them, though,” Draco replied laconically.
“This is not what happened!” the redheaded git protested.
“Oh, him,” Pansy said, affecting her most vapid air. “What do you want to know?”
“Well,” Draco mumbled. “That’s good, I guess.”
Something, in the background, broke with a glassy sound.
“What can I say?” Draco shrugged, looking tall and handsome and without a care in the world. “I always make an impression, wherever I go.”
Harry scratched his neck, embarassed.
“Harry Potter,” she said, her accent making his name sound like it had twice as many ‘r’s as it usually did. “Vy are you and Draco not speaking anymore? He’s being a pain to be around.”
“Why would I? He’s not making any effort for me,” Draco pointed out.
“I did,” Rasputin said with hauteur. “He said it vas none of my business.”
Harry rolled his eyes, because that was the reaction Draco was expecting from him, and tried not to betray the relief he felt that his gift had been appreciated.
He had almost managed to push the Durmstrang boy out of his mind. That was one thing he could thank the Tournament, he reckoned: that amount of stress did not leave him much room to dwell on his failed - what? Relationship? Romance? - with Draco Malfoy.
“Why would I know?” Ron exclaimed, throwing his hands up. “Those bloody purebloods never make any sense, now, do they? You’re well rid of him, Harry, believe me. They have all those ridiculous courting traditions, like you wouldn’t believe, you’ll be so much better off with anyone else. Now we only need to get Krum to drop Hermione off, and we can go back to how things were before you got bewitched by those Durmstrang gits.”
Harry feels even more betrayed by the powers that be because of the Yule Ball than he ever did on discovering a Dark Wizard had put him on his hit list before he was even born.
This will be a common occurrence.
“Yes. He should be starting his fourth year.”
"So?" Harry muttered, avoiding his eyes.
Of course not. People as well connected as the Malfoys would probably have been told before the text had even found its way to the printing press.
“SILENCE,” Dumbledore’s amplified voice thundered above the general noise, which pettered out. As one, all the students turned to him: he had rised, and his uncharacteristically serious face silenced the last remaining murmurs.
Betrayal twisted your entrails something fierce, Draco found out.
It started well enough: the food was good, and Harry tried a few of the foreign dishes mixed in with the usual offerings of the Halloween feast. The cheese soufflés, the burgundy beef and the goulash were nice, but the pickled herrings were atrocious and he declined the offer for bouillabaise. Ron tasted everything and pronounced everything delicious, but they all suspected him of not having the same sense of taste as normal people, based on the weird combinations he was sometimes seen eating.
“Again?” Draco asked, raising his eyebrow at Svetlana, who returned his expression with a shrug. “You’ve been spending all your time there, is it that interesting?”
“It is bad taste,” Svetlana acknowledged with a sniff. “I vonder vo did it.”
“Calm down, Drasha,” Svetlana admonished him.
"Who cares?" Ron said. "It solves Harry's problem pretty neatly, doesn't it? And it's not like
“That wasn’t what I meant, and you know it,” he said.
“Hey, doesn’t that Harry Potter kid attend Hogwarts?” Antoniy said suddenly.
“Well, no one knows what happened to Buckbeak, either, and he disappeared at the same time!” Daphne defended herself. “Remember, Mr Crabbe was very displeased that he would not be punished for hurting Vincent.”
“Vat?” Svetlana asked by his side.
“So what?” Harry barely managed to breathe out.
He tried to walk past, and immediately, Draco stepped into his path and stopped him with a hand on his arm. It was just as unbearably warm as it had been on his shoulder before; Harry recoiled.
The Weasel blinked several times, considering his new clothes with a surprised air, and finally said:
"Are you sure?" Fleur asked, taking her face between her hands.
Draco smirked at Antoniy, who glared back. That would teach him to mock him around his crush.
different styles, he amended, considering Mrs Malfoy’s and her son’s very expensive, very elegant robes. The boy caught his eye and gave him a wry smile which seemed to mean “what can you do?” over his mother’s shoulder, and though Harry wasn’t sure he could completely understand the sentiment, he couldn’t help but smile back.
Some further lore about Durmstrang interspersed in here. I do enjoy this school, shame we won't be seeing more of it.
“Yeah,” Ron said. “That’s because you haven’t met the other person yet. It only starts getting a shape a few days before you meet them. Mine did right before we started Hogwarts, so you’ll probably meet them soon. Probably during the World Cup, though.”
And it was all going very well, except that Viktor was so tongue-tied he appeared to be glowering, until they crossed paths with that ginger friend of their two companions in the Three Broomsticks. Weasley – which one was it, already? – had taken one look at Krum, another one at Draco, then a common one of utter betrayal at Granger and Potter and the four butterbeers in front of them, and turned heels to drag the rest of their Housemates out of the pub.
“Oh, so you manipulated him into forgiving you?” Svetlana said with a low whistle that could either be in endorsement or in disgust. Sometimes it was hard to tell, with her.
He shrugged his doubt at her. Viktor and Draco were friends, he had no doubt about it, but they didn’t look like the kind of friends that confided their deepest secrets in each other. If anyone was likely to know about the reasons behind Draco’s attitude, he would bet on Svetlana Rasputin: not because Draco was more likely to speak to her, but because she might be able to guess them out. Viktor simply didn’t have this kind of observational skills.
“A ponce?” Harry suggested, because that had been Ron’s favourite designation for Draco since the first Task.
By the time the eleven challengers were selected, Krum was listed as the favorite in Kaija’s betting pool, with Svetlana as a close second. Karkaroff had taken Draco appart to remind him to act in a manner befitting of the scion of two old pureblood lines, probably because Rasputin had been caught reading Marx’ Manifesto to unsuspecting first years, and his excuses that he was researching the history of his grandfather’s downfall convinced exactly no one. And Draco’s soulmark had gone from a vague smudge to something very tangible.
The next day, Ron still refused to speak to him, and everyone else wanted to know how he had done it. Hermione, the only one to believe him, promised she would try to find a way for him to step down from his unwanted position as fourth Champion in a
It would have been too much to expect, probably, that no consequence would follow of these awful circumstances, though. The jury had barely given them their notes, and left them free to get dried and changed in relative peace, when Draco ambushed him.
“You do realize that he’s your rival in this tournament, right? I don’t think he needs your help to beat you. He’s got three years on you, he should be able to handle this by himself. That’s why the bloody goblet chose him, didn’t it?”
Draco would firmly deny any accusation that he also seemed to randomly hang out in areas where Potter had been known to loiter around that time, no matter how many times Svetlana repeated them.
“Mad-Eye Moody? Totally barmy,” Ron confirmed as he set up the pieces to wipe the board with Harry’s arse, as he was wont to do when they played. No matter how hard he tried to teach his best friend the basics of strategy, Harry remained completely impenetrable to the discipline, and only played to entertain him. “Remember what my dad said last time when he said he was attacked? That guy sees enemies everywhere.”
“Maybe we can get him to play a match against us,” Draco said. “We might have enough players to make a team depending on who Karkaroff picks. What do you think, Krum? Want to see if the saviour of the Wizarding World can hold his own against your skill?”
So they remained on good terms, because Draco did not feel like tickling the sleeping dragon for such a little thing. It was of no import, anyway. His parents had their opinions, and he had his, and there was no use in measuring all the ways in which they differed. It would only invite dissent between them, and it was not like Draco ever intended on shacking up with a muggle, anyways. He might find them interesting, but he couldn’t imagine sharing his life with someone he could not fly with.
“If it had settled, I would have informed you immediately, but it’s not the case yet. I didn’t want to discuss this through letters,” he said.
“It will be alright,” Draco promised, taking his hand in his.
Harry wondered if his best friend would still show the same preference for Krum if he told him he rather suspected the Durmstrang champion of being Hermione’s date to the ball. He had not spent that much time with either Krum or Draco’s other friend, Svetlana Rasputin, but each time it had happened, numerous hints had been dropped about Krum’s unusual interest in the library those days. Mostly from Draco, too, who seemed to greatly enjoy riling Krum up.
“You could go with me,” Draco suddenly said. “To the ball, I mean.”
Draco is a drama queen (which we all knew) and tries to give badges to everyone.
“That was Rasputin’s fault,” he said, sipping his glöggi.
“Great, that will be ever so practical,” he sighed. “It’s not like there will be thousands of people there.”
And he had buried, deep, deep inside himself, that stupid little hope that maybe Draco Malfoy, met right after his soulmark had started changing, was actually the one person supposed to bring the biggest positive change in his life.
"Hey, I'm still sitting here too," Harry snaps irritated. He appreciates his closest friends, since he knows he can always confide in them, but unfortunately, they also know him best and demonstrate his shortcomings a little too clearly from time to time.
Inside Harry scans the gathered crowd, searching for bright blue hair, fair skin, trashy outfit and is soon rewarded. He makes his way through the room towards the bar where he has found his friend leaning on.
"Harry, hi!" he says breathlessly. "You're here." With hands still damp, he brushes strands of his loose hair out of his face, and then provisionally tries to rubs them dry with themselves. Harry notes with amusement, that for Drew his clothes are definitely not considered to be a towel substitute. Fair enough since he’s wearing black suit trousers and a white shirt, probably remnants of his work attire. Maybe Harry was a tad too punctual.
Harry noticeably relaxes by Cas' accommodating reaction, and just by that realized how scared he was nonetheless she might not accept him.
So instead of shuffling to his bedroom, Harry heads to the kitchen and prepares himself another cup of coffee along with some toast.
"I don't know maybe chicken out and loose our bet before even trying. Or maybe saving you a fit for the night?"
It turns out his panic reaction was exaggerated, and his little sporting dedication was enough to soothe his stomach. As cool as possible he turns around, leans against the counter, acts as if nothing happened. “Nice flat you got here.”
“Sometimes. I can always apparte to some coastline if I feel like it, though. English one’s of course. The continent’s a bit too far.” He reminisces. “But yes. Living in a small cottage stands in stark contrast to London. Sometimes for the better, sometimes not. Depends on what state of mind you’re in.”
have a company team, which I am in." As he talks Harry’s eyes begin to light up and his words become more energetic, more joyful. He probably wouldn't describe himself as a jock, but a Quidditch-infatuated athlete probably sums it up pretty well.
“Maybe”, he says, voice cracking off.
“Côte d'Opale”, Drew now leans onto Harry's back, lets his arms be supported by his shoulder girdle and his head hang next to Harry’s right ear. “Where I’ve lived after… uh and during the war.”
And Cas is not long in coming. Dressed in a sweat suit and her hair tied in a messy bun, she gives the impression of having just jumped from the bed into the fireplace. Probably not too far from the truth.
“I guess, I found my wand”, he holds it up in evidence and gives Drew a crooked smile.
“Probably… yes. I was… I was hoping we could agree on
Her eyes wide, then she smiles again. "I'd be lying if I said I expected it, but it also doesn't surprise me." Her eyes glance over the crowd, fixate on a hopping blue dot, then with sudden realization "You and Falk... You're not an item, are you?"
“I figured, yes. If it wasn’t for that ‘ungallant way’ I never would have found out, right?”
"How are you?" asks Harry as Hermione steps out of the fireplace holding her clearly bulging belly.
“Yes, thanks”, Harry says dryly and snatches them out of his hand with a wandless that mercifully works. He halts, considers if he should undress right on the spot in front of Drew or if he preferers to go to the bathroom. Technically there’s nothing the other man hasn’t seen yet. On the other side, Harry’s not sure if Drew ever saw him completely naked since he is optically Harry again. Probably not.
“Uhn. After almost vomiting on his floor, we proceeded where we left off at the club and got to get each other off. No, actually only I got off. And then I fell asleep…”, he ends his illustration of the last night’s events.
A shadow hangs over him, when he notices, that he hasn’t told his best friends yet about the latest circumstances in his life, but it’s the kind of darkness, that helps with falling asleep rather than evoking anxiety-driven insomnia.
“You know this screams set-up, right?”, Harry lifts an eyebrow. He wouldn’t be too surprised if the first reporter owls arrived any second. Ill-humoured Harry wishes he hadn’t taken that hangover potion and was still blessed with limited cognitive capacity. Instead he has the full pleasure of holistic awareness of the situation and consequent annoyance, PLUS a painful knot in his head.
"Take me to yours.” He can’t believe his own forwardness; his lower body must have taken over. But before he can row back the uncomfortable sensation of being forced through a tube implies Drew’s consent to no longer dawdle.
"Honestly, I have a question to get off my chest too. Why me?" he asks, now also leaning briskly on his knees. "Why not find another, easier-to-get guy?"
When it takes him to long to wait for Drew to come back, he gets up, too. Interested he takes for the concert piano and presses some of the keys randomly. With not one lesson of musical education since primary school it’s bound to sound enharmonic and he decides to leave the actual playing of instruments to those who have learned how to, and to remain the enjoying listener. Next stop is the fireplace, or rather, a couple of photos hung above it. They picture coastal landscapes at different weather conditions, each a perfectly looped capture of moving waves, mesmerizing Harry for a good moment. Especially the stormy weather one.
“It’s a field study. Briefing comes afterwards.” Harry follows the pace of the joke.
But Harry is fast asleep.
“Good idea”, she calls out with sparkling eyes. Here is where Harry’s resilience snaps. Her support until now has been enriching and uplifting, but the mass of unpleasant confrontations this day has reached a level that first needs rest and time to process, before any more content can follow.
“He supposedly is the owl of one of our patients or their visitors”, Hermione sighs.
As the transformation finishes he looks at the result in the mirror. He hasn’t quite remembered anymore how handsome his chosen personification for this evening is, and is very pleasantly surprised. If it wasn't himself ‘wearing’ this body, he’d hit on the bloke that was looking at him with dark eyes through the mirror.
Harry nods in a small gesture, somewhat restricted in his movements by Drew’s weight.
"Seems like it, yeah. Just somewhat... happened eventually in the last years."
“Don’t mention it”, Harry laughs. “No, seriously, don’t mention it. I'm really off my game today."
Drew deliberates. “Sure, we could. I thought you’d suggest so. But I fear what suits my taste, cannot be realized with material entities.”
“Why though? Bad start off?”, she asks critically.
The moment the door opens, he stands up, ready to face Drew. Or so he thought. In regret about his hasty movement, he holds tight to whatever his hands touch first as his eyes go black and he roams the air for grip. Harry hopes for wall. Instead Drew turns out to be ‘whatever his hands touch first’. More precisely his satin dressing gown, that feels no less pricy then the trousers Harry’s snitched.
"It's fine, everyone has their skeletons in the cupboard. As long as you don't mind your partner screaming 'the wrong name' later on, I don’t mind." Harry’s alcohol induced straight forwardness leaves a lot to be desired. He’s even too drunk to at least properly blush. Something you cannot say about Drew. Face reddening, he chokes a bit, coughs. "You play with very open cards, huh?"
And then she flutters away.
"Oh, I'm sure, their bewilderment by an affair can escalate to unimagined dimensions when it happens to be with a man."
Idk, i just tend to build my stories that way, it seems. Next chapter there will be more actual interaction and progress, I promise.

"Then I guess I owe her a second debt of gratitude for laying the tracks for us."
"What's wrong with you? Do you think your own judgement of character is so fallible? Or do you have a thing for men, you trust to double-cross you the first chance they get?"
“I just never intended to in the first place, you see? Why change my mind just because now he knows of my true identity?”
“As if you aren’t interested, too”, Harry retorts.
“Do you miss it? Living at the sea?”
this took longer than expected to write down, sorry (to everyone who's actually following up from the start)
Drew gives him a thoughtful look. "I hope so too."
„What’s behind that door?”, Harry asks, pointing his thumb at the corresponding one.
“Maybe you can sooner than you think.”
Surprisingly Drew’s not appalled. “I don’t remember giving the declaration of consent to participate in a study”, he fools around, eying Harry with interest.
Harry lifts a questioning eyebrow, but plays along, doesn’t it build on their previous tomfoolery. “Never mind. The Prophet might have mentioned me in an article alongside the reporting of the Second Wizarding War. But in one way or another, weren’t we all involved?”
A blush of shame rises to Harry's face. He knows people are not wrong when they think of him as a typical jock, head always a bit in the clouds except when it comes to his favourite sport (that ironically takes place in the clouds). Simple-minded, qualities showing on a physical level, quick and instinctive reflexes, not especially a sensitive thinker. But it’s only half of the truth.
“I don’t feel in the right condition to consider anything but penalizing myself right now.” Harry’s morbid humour only covers part of his inner conflict.
“Aw, Harry, come here”, Cas cries out and pulls him into a comforting embrace. Harry did not know that this is exactly what he needed, until he felt the warm of her body through there clothes radiating from where her legs touch his torso, her gentle hands stroking his upper back and arm. For a brief moment, Harry is in a bubble of love and security, far from fears and painful memories.
"Don't dodge the implied question."
Harry smiles. "Great, my proposal for the Nimbus 3000 got accepted. I'll probably get a big ass bonus and will be head leader of the development team.”
"It's fine." And from the pitch of his voice Harry senses that Drew means it.
“I would like to see you again”, Drew clarifies. “I know, we both had no deeper intention in mind when we embarked on our nocturnal adventure and I respect it, if you want to leave it as that. But I’d be delighted, if not.” Harry’s not prepared for something like that. He rather braced himself already for hoards of reporters importuning him with every step he makes, for harassment. Even blackmail he predicted, if the unfortunate revelation of his secret occurred. But to ever consider someone just being willing to see him again without any greater benefits but his company as unsuspicious he had nipped in the bud.
That was the extent of his knowledge on the matter, and with two people around him bearing the uncommon soulmarks, of his curiosity as well. It wasn’t something that concerned him, thank you very much, and wasn’t that such a relief? That Harry Potter, the Boy who Lived, with his scar and his destiny and his position on the Quidditch team as a first year, didn’t have anything more to separate him from the crowd?
“If you don’t like it, Sveta, maybe you shouldn’t have campaigned that hard for me to reconcile with him, hum?” Draco said, raising an eyebrow at her.
“Why must you be like that?” Harry grinded through his teeth as he stomped them to a table.
Yeah, well, worrying endlessly about what he had done to Draco before going back to his dorm wasn’t very conductive to rest, Harry had found out. He had only managed to fall asleep in the early hours of the morning, which had led to missing his alarm, and now he was late. He didn’t feel tired, though, propelled forward by anxiety and manic energy. What if Draco had already left? What if Draco didn’t feel like seeing him after that stupid, stupid kiss? Worse, what if he didn’t want to talk to him anymore?
“I didn’t know you read the Daily Prophet,” he said.
“I am calm,” he said through gritted teeth.
“It’s my parents. I have to think about them,” Draco said and, when something else broke behind him, added in a frustrated tone. “Merlin’s pants, Potter, control your magic.”
Harry gave him a bright smile and, quick as a Snitch, he darted in and kissed Draco on the cheek before turning on his heels and disappearing into the castle.
Harry turned on his heels when he realized he had been staring. The movement seemed to catch Malfoy’s eyes, and he swooped down to the field, coming to a stop right beside Harry.
“We will see each other more this year,” his mother said with a happy smile. “Because you will be at Hogwarts!”
She raised for her hands in defense, not saying one word more, and Draco went back to staring at the Gryffindor’s table, which had the merit of immediately alleviating his irritation.
Oh, Draco, you jelly drama queen.
His mother found him in his rooms later that evening. He was leaning against the mantel, watching the flames dance as he fed them the ripped remains of some letters.
“There’s nothing to be done about it.”
Harry should have expected it, really, but it still felt like a slap across the face.
It was a matter of minutes to take the bindings off, and then Draco was in his arms, limp and unresponsive, but unmistakably solid and warm. Yet none of the other Champions had come, yet, and Harry just couldn't leave the others behind. Certainly not Hermione, but Cho was equally out of the question, and Gabrielle even more. He was trying to argue with the merpeople guarding them, as much as you could argue with someone underwater and without knowing a word of merspeak, when Cedric finally appeared and, in a few moments, had made off with Cho, to Harry's great relief. One less person to worry about.
“Just on the cheek,” Draco mumbled. “It doesn’t really count. And anyway, you never know, with your Gryffindor types. You’re just too bloody touchy-feely, you probably do it to all your friends.”
In the end, it was Rasputin herself who came to Harry, around the end of January. She cornered him as he stepped out of the library, where he had spent two hours looking for a way to bloody breathe underwater for an hour. He hadn’t found one, and the sound of Krum’s fans giggling had grated on his nerves too much to continue the endeavour.
Spontaneous combustion was not a thing, to the best of Harry's knowledge, though he had never given much thought to the fact since discovering the world of wizardry. Maybe it was indeed a thing in this world, he thought dazzedly as he acquiesced and watched Draco's mouth descend towards him. His lips were soft, even softer than that time they had touched Harry's cheek, that time before the train. Harry felt like every nerve on his body thrummed, like before a Quidditch match but better somehow, different.
Daily Prophet,” Draco gritted between his teeth, immediately furious, and watched the journal jump from the Slytherin’s hands to his. The boy looked ready to protest the theft, but a glare from Draco convinced him to keep his mouth shut and his eyes averted.
“I vill not vear a badge for Hogvarts,” Svetlana said flatly. “I am supporting Viktor, you know, like a good friend should.”
Oh. Well, that was much better. At least he would return to Durmstrang for his seventh year. He wasn’t even sure how his curriculum so far would have integrated with Hogwarts’, anyways. The focus of the two schools were completely different.
“Why, Rasputin, can’t wait for a few minutes?” Draco ribbed, as if he had not been the one playing the mystery up. “You have no patience at all.”
They didn’t see much of each other during the day. Draco was attending sixth year classes – five of them, picked amongst the NEWT offerings – and Karkaroff had assigned all the Durmstrang students a special project to keep them from “slacking off”. It was, for all intents and purposes, an extended version of the Practicals they usually took in February back at school, but Draco, as the only sixth year student, couldn’t very well be paired with anyone. Not that he would have been able to, anyway: since Krum’s participation in the Tournament was considered his Practical, the ten remaining students had quickly paired off with each other. Even Svetlana, that backstabbing cow.
Even when the muggle Czar and his family had fallen, the Rasputins had escaped mostly untouched by the revolution. Antoniy and Svetlana’s family fortune outshone the Malfoys’ by an order of magnitude. If their description of their home could be trusted, they lived in a palace which would have dwarfed the Manor, deep into the Ural mountains. And the siblings were not even that exceptional in the social scenery of Durmstrang. That might have been due to the fact that the school had seen quite a number of Rasputins over the years - the siblings' grandfather had apparently been quite prolific, and not all that attached to the concept of monogamy, but what use was it to try and compete with a family whose domain was the size of a small country?
(See the end of the chapter for
“There’s a translation spell over Hogwarts?” Harry couldn’t help but ask.
The students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang were scheduled to arrive on the 30th of October. Harry had all but forgotten about it when he sat down in the midst of the excited buzz in the Great Hall that morning. Hedwig had just arrived with a letter from Sirius, confirming, as Harry had feared, that his godfather was on British soil once again, or would be very soon. The twins were planning some mischief involving someone outside of Hogwarts, but they were the only one talking about something else than the upcoming arrival. Even the Slytherin table looked agitated, though in a quieter manner than the other three. Some of the younger ones had not yet managed the dignified bearing of the sixth and seventh years, and Harry stifled a laugh watching them try to emulate the behaviour.
Ron high-fived Harry while she glowered at them, annoyed.
“Oh, that is good to hear,” she said. “I was worried, when I saw that horrible article.”
“Kaija, we attended the same Assembly you did,” Svetlana explained patiently.
“Fine, fine,” Ron said, raising his hands in defense. “Just saying, it’s weird how you’re suddenly all about Slytherins’ welfare. What’s next, house elves?”
“This is not about stupidity, Draco. This is about loyalty,” Lucius said, his voice low and his eyes focused.
It all meant that Draco was pretty much swamped in work, and he had been a fool to think that Hogwarts was an easy school just because they had breaks and shorter study days than in Durmstrang. There were no Dark Arts or Dueling classes, but Defense against the Dark Arts seemed like a weird mix of the two, and though that tosser Moody seemed to hate him on sight, the class was intense and interesting. Alchemy and Advanced Arithmancy had a curriculum just far enough from what he had been taught that they were kicking his ass, and if he had thought he could relax with Herbology and Transfiguration, he had been severely mistaken. Then after he was done, he had to head to the Potions laboratory to work on his Practical, or to the library to try and catch up with his new yearmates. That usually left him one or two free hours in the evening, and Harry always seemed to randomly pop up in his vicinity around that time.
“Hesaidyoudidn’tinvitemeasafriend,” Harry finally said without breathing.
Harry deflated. Of course he couldn’t have known: Harry had only told the Gryffindors, and even they didn’t believe him. The Hufflepuffs thought he was trying to steal Cedric’s thunder, the Slytherins hated him on principle, and the Ravenclaws either didn’t care or sided with the rest of the school, but no one had even asked him what had happened. Of course the foreign students had heard nothing more about it.
“What’s your deal?” Harry said. “Cedric was helping
He let himself be guided to the potions lab.
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione sighed, putting her head on his shoulder. “I’m so sorry.”
Draco’s heart skipped a beat and he did a quick calculation.
Draco’s mind was blank, completely blank, for a few seconds.
“You are not as funny man as you zink you are, Draco Malfoy,” Svetlana said.
“What has Draco done now?” she sighed, giving them a tired look.
My stock of finished chapters is also dwindling, so you might want to brace for longer-spaced updates.
“What?” Harry sputtered. “I don’t have a crush on Draco!”
“I- Harry,” Draco said, desperately, as he reached out. Harry batted his hand away.
He was close to a sugar-induced coma when Dumbledore rose and clapped his hand to call for attention. The ceremony to appoint the three Champions started with Fleur Delacour’s name being called. Harry, who had not been looking at the Beauxbatons champion but at her little sister, smiled when she applauded excitedly. Then the Cup produced Viktor Krum’s name for Durmstrang, and Harry watched avidly as he rose from the Slytherin table, where Malfoy were smirking at him and apparently needling his friend so much the girl who sat with them cuffed him on the head and glared him down when he tried to protest. At least he didn’t look annoyed not to be selected.
He could still feel Draco’s eyes on the side of his face, boring into him. Maybe Draco could see through it all, peer into his brain directly and see the truth about him. It was a scary thought.
“Oh, well. I mean, we could always get a hold of women’s robes and one of us could wear them, if you really feel that’s an indispensable part of the process,” he said, and Harry could feel his whole face and neck turning hot in response to the smirk overtaking Draco’s lips.
This launched a lengthy explanation of all the exploits Harry Potter and his friends – a Weasley and a muggleborn called Granger – had been involved in during their three previous years, which did make for an impressive list considering the short amount of time they had had to perform them. Some sounded quite far-fetched, and had likely grown deformed with the rumour: Harry Potter had killed their Defense teacher during their first year, Harry Potter had met Nicolas Flamel and been given his philosopher’s stone, Harry Potter was a Parseltongue, Harry Potter had killed a basilisk with his bare hands, Harry Potter had killed Sirius Black, faithful servant of the Dark Lord, and hidden his body while the murderer awaited the Dementor’s kiss, and so forth and so forth. For a fourteen year-old, he certainly sounded larger than life.
"Wishing for such a small amount of money, how positively plebeian of you, Rasputin," Draco replied with hauteur.
Her friends corrobated all of her stories, except the one about Sirius Black. Daphne Greengrass seemed to think that the infamous trio of Gryffindor had facilitated his escape by also freeing a hippogriff awaiting execution. Her friends both scoffed at her.
“She doesn’t really hex people without a reason, so I doubt she was the only culprit when she got caught,” Hermione continued. “And even if she had been, that punishment was completely over the top. She could have gotten seriously hurt!”
Satisfied with the girl’s nod, she glided to the Great Hall doors, where a dark-haired Hogwarts’ student presented her with his arms, looking just as stupidly bessotted as Weasley did in that moment.
“No!” Draco protested. “No, I really enjoyed last night.” This time he managed to get a hold of Harry’s hand, and Harry looked at it, the pale white skin around his own brown one, and couldn’t find it in him to escape it. “I really did. I just- I just thought maybe it hadn’t been the case for you.”
“Hello?” he said, uncertain.
Fortunately, Draco was quite familiar with the challenge of finding specific people in large wizarding buildings, and as soon as he found a suitably empty corridor filled with suitably friendly-looking portraits, he proceeded to convince one to carry a message to Harry, proposing they met at the Quidditch pitch, which was generally empty at this hour. At least, if the boy didn’t want to talk about it, they could fly his frustration away.
And they all dislike Moody because, even without the creepy impersonation by a Death Eater problem, I always thought the guy was a menace. It didn't make sense to me that so many students liked him when he was basically traumatizing them.
: if purebloods were supposed to be so much more superior to the others, why would they need to expand so much energy proving it to the world? But, as both Lucius and Narcissa had underlined it, loyalty to his family came first, even when they were behaving foolishly. They were his parents, and he loved them, and they him.
And it doesn't go quite as well as Draco planned.
“And how is he, outside of Quidditch?” Svetlana asked, and Draco could have kissed her.
"I'm okay, Fleur," Gabrielle said from where she was tightly pressed against her sister.
Yes Draco, Harry has a mouth on him, doesn't he?
“Hasn’t stopped you from having a crush on him, has it? Or on his girlfriend, for that matter,” the Durmstrang boy snorted.
“Thank you for pointing out that very obvious point, Potter,” the Durmstrang boy drawled. “I hadn’t noticed.”
Peace lasts a few hours, then the owls drop the Daily Prophet.
That, and Karkaroff's speeches are as deadly boring as ever, especially when you already know what he's going to say.
There was nothing to do but to swim to where they could stand up: Draco went on his own – nothing could have convinced Harry to touch him again at this point – but Harry made sure that Gabrielle got there without trouble and, when they finally managed it, Fleur was upon them, and hugging her sister hard while asking rapid fire questions in French.
Draco sighed and leaned back against one of the benchtops, pinching the bridge of his nose as if feeling exhausted.
“No,” Narcissa sighed. “You are not. But you know how important it is for us to stand together as a family. We cannot afford to be seen as divided. Some people don’t know any better than to believe everything they read in the Prophet.”
She was clearly daring him to finish his thoughts, and Ginny surreptitiously disentangled herself from her brother to take a step back, coming closer to Harry.
“Do you know how to dance?”
So, down two friends for the foreseeable future, and unwilling to spend time with others who, while not hostile, still didn’t trust him to tell the truth, Harry grabbed his Firebolt and headed to the Quidditch pitch. His bad luck held, though, and when he got there, he saw it was already occupied. With a jolt, he recognized Krum’s unmistakable form, and the striking hair of Draco Malfoy. They were taking turns with the quaffle, one defending the goals while the others attempted to score. Krum flew with a grace that simply did not translate to the way he moved on the ground, but on a broom, oh, he was magnificient. Malfoy didn’t pale much in the comparison: he was obviously an excellent player, and much more at ease with the red ball than Krum was. He was calling taunts at his friend, his smile wide and uncomplicated, and with the wind in his air and the way his eyes shone, he looked particularly arresting.
“Apparently Karkaroff will announce something of magnitude for this year, according to this inselaffe,” Antoniy said, gesturing at Draco. “But he refuses to tell me anything more than that.”
“Draco, you were about to start arguing with a first year you don’t even know for the sake of annoying him,” Harry sighed, dropping onto a chair. “I’m not asking you to be nice to Ron, just… maybe don’t antagonize him so much?” He raised hopeful eyes to him, which absolutely counted as cheating.
“It vas snoving heavily vhen ve left,” the girl pointed out, and her tone of voice indicated that she was very, very tired of that argument.
Harry took a look around him but no, she had cornered him well and good.
“Durmstrang takes students from all over Europe, so they all speak their native language,” Hermione said, already hunched over a book. How that girl managed to always have one about remained a complete mystery to Harry. “There is a translation spell over the school, just like there is one here.”
“I can’t,” he said. “I won’t.”
“Listen, Mother,” he said, and took a large inspiration to drive off the edge of desperation from his voice. “You said you would leave me to my own devices, and that I was only required to think of the family before committing too deeply. I went one step further, but it didn’t take. We can just stick to the original plan: I’ll tread carefully, and we’ll play it by ear if it survives my return to Durmstrang.”
Yeah, so Hermione and Harry do not have the same outlook on Slytherin without Draco as an antagonist to provide a focal point. So Ron is the only one who think very negatively against them, because he's grown with that prejudice. He's gonna change his mind, don't you worry.
He flipped her the bird.
Draco didn’t even realize his soulmark had started changing until he was on the ship to Durmstrang. There was no way to know when he had met his future bond partner, which pissed him off beyond reason, and no way to announce it to his parents, which was actually a nice compensation for having missed what would have been, technically speaking, the most magical moment of his life. Not everyone was marked by fate, after all.
“Grimhildr, Drasha, you lucky bastard. You get to see either Krum or Sveta get pummeled by dangerous beasts and you’ll meet the Boy-Who-Lived,” his roommate sighed. “I wished I could go with you.”
“It was an accident,” he mumbled.
“You’re a bitch,” Svetlana informed her, which the Sami girl just shrugged off with a laugh.
in Slytherin ones, up to and including some of Potter’s Housemates. Draco had taken one look at the way the boy’s faced had closed on spotting it, and felt like accio
All Durmstrang students learned this particular lesson at the start of their second year, generally in a rather nasty manner. Draco had been quite lucky himself, all things considered: Professor Backlund had only transfigured his hair into brambles. It had taken him three weeks to figure out how to reverse it, and sleeping had required a lot of precautions in the meantime.
“I do not
Draco could see how such measures would sound ridiculous to a Durmstrang student. Viktor probably owed his flying prowess in part to the training he got escaping the Norwegian Ridgebacks which inhabited the mountains marking their grounds’ Southern limit. Avoiding a forest because of a few centaurs seemed like nonsense, especially when you could just talk yourself out of any problem with them if you showed enough respect.
“Nothing we can do about it,” Lucius said, brusquely. “But I expect you will take care to stay out of harm’s way.”
“I, er,” he stammered.
, everyone heard the shock in Dumbledore’s voice as he read Harry’s name. Harry didn’t even know why he even bothered to wish for a normal life anymore.
“Not as many fans there,” Viktor said, but he was mumbling, which was a sure mark of him lying, and Draco perked up in interest.
“I could make you one too, you know,” he offered.
"Sorry, mate. But it looks proper awful."
“I can’t believe they are forcing us to dance,” Harry complained. “I thought the Tournament only meant mortal danger, not socially embarassing situations.”
Draco was hunching over a cutting board and raised his eyes to watch Harry stumble in. He grimaced.
He would have suggested taking some pages out of his father’s book, but Karkaroff had been exposed to Lucius Malfoy’s political savvy for years, and it did not seem to have rubbed off on him. To think that the headmaster had been a Deatheater, part of the inner circle of the Dark Lord himself. Draco might not support this philosophy anymore, but wasn’t the entourage of the most powerful dark wizard of this age supposed to be a little less pathetic? And his father might have been as tight-lipped about that period of his life which had preceded the Dark Lord’s fall, Draco still knew quite a bit about it from snooping around Lucius’ – supposedly off-limit to him – study. Was there really any pride in sharing the Dark Mark with the likes of Crabbe, and Goyle, who thought brawn more than amply enough compensated for brains, and were passing down the belief to their sons?
Plus, you know, of course teenagers are going to track down anything you forbid them from reading. Especially if they're pissed off at a headmaster who abolished school breaks and plays obvious favorites.
On the last week of October, Ron apologized to Hermione, and acknowledged that maybe, being in Slytherin didn’t automatically make you a minion of Evil. Hermione, who had never been accused by anyone of being a gracious winner, offered to accept his apology if he joined S.P.E.W. That started another round of fighting, but Harry somehow enjoyed the squabbling.
"Well, disgusting or not, it will make you able to breathe and swim underwater for well over an hour," Hermione said, taping the drawing of the offensive plant with her index. "Be sure to be take it close enough to the lake, though, because you won't be able to breathe outside of it once the effect starts. Elladora Ketteridge almost died from it, you know."
“That is for me to know, and for you to wonder at,” Draco answered haughtily, which only earned him a cuff on the head.
“What? No, I don’t have one,” Harry said, confused.
They stayed a few more moments like this, lost in thought, while Draco’s thumb absent-mindedly traced Harry’s knuckles. Finally, Draco said:
Barmy didn’t even start to describe Professor Moody. The man was absolutely and irrevocably nuts, so paranoid it was a wonder he even managed to get out of bed every morning. Harry wondered how he had been allowed into a teaching position at all given what could at best be described at a shaky mental health. Sure, he might have been one of the greatest Aurors ever at some point, but nowadays he belonged in a therapist’s office or ten, not in a school.
“Don’t you vant to know vy he’s broken up viz you vizout telling you?” Rasputin pointed out. “At least you vill have closure, right?”
“Like an arrogant jerk!” Harry exclaimed, throwing his hands in the air. “You know Ron doesn’t like you, can’t you try to be a bit more… Conciliant?”
Fortunately for him, Draco was nothing if not resourceful – and well connected. It had taken barely more than fifty minutes to convince Severus Snape of taking him as a sort of apprentice for the year, forty of which had been spent proving he could brew a perfect antidote to common poisons in half the usual required time.
“You’ll find someone else,” Hermione said with her reassuring voice.
"I..." Harry was at a loss for words, and he gulped. He had thought about it at length during the past weeks: what would he say, what would he do, if Draco ever offered to resume whatever had been going on between them? During the first week after the Potions lab, he would have scorned the offer, without any hesitation, or at least he had thought he would. After, he had rejected the very possibility that it would ever happen and now, confronted with it, his feelings were so overwhelming he couldn't parse them out. He had been so angry at Draco, he was still so angry, and hurt over the whole event. He had still not gotten any sort of real explanation about what it had all been about, and from Draco's words, it didn't seem like he would ever get any. Yet his chest was full to bursting, and the contact of Draco's hand on him still filled him with nervousness and hope. He
"So I was the one you'd sorely miss."
, he almost said, but thought better of it, "anything to do with me."
(See the end of the chapter for
“She’s beautiful,” Ron said. He was a bit goggly-eyed. Had there not been three rows of younger Gryffindors in front of him, and as many behind him, Harry rather thought he might have tried to follow her inside the castle.
He was wearing black Quidditch gear, but had forgone the overcoat, and it emphasized his lean frame. Harry felt crummy, in comparison, in his Gryffindor gear.
“I wish there was,” Narcissa said in a low voice. “Do you think…?”
“You look nice,” Harry said, as he joined them down the stairs, his eyes averted from Draco’s face because the kid apparently couldn’t handle giving compliments, or receiving them, or any flirting, really, while making eye contact.
“As I said, you wouldn’t understand,” Draco shook his head, eyeing the shelves warily now.
“Yeah. That’s what I’m hoping for,” Draco said, as he crossed Granger’s wide worried eyes across the stands. “Because I’m pretty sure that if Diggory could figure it out, Karkaroff and Maxime certainly did, and you bet your arse they told Viktor and Delacour.”
He could also have told them about how muggle technology sometimes rivaled magic. Not everything, of course, but some. They could message one another instantly with phones instead of relying on owls, and he was sure his mother would have enjoyed that immensely, if it had not been muggle, and if phones worked in Durmstrang. They didn’t, Kaija Krysi had tried, but what an invention. And their flying apparatus looked much more comfortable for long distance travel than any broom. It was no international portkey, to be sure, but there was only so much you could take with you with a portkey.
To their surprise, it was the Greengrass girl, Daphne, who came to her rescue. She had looked completely uninterested in their conversation so far, and kept glancing at another table when she thought no one would catch her.
He motionned to Viktor to join them and, after a glance showed him that Karkaroff was deep into conversation with Dumbledore and could not prevent his escape, the lumbering fool made his way to them.
Svetlana’s eyebrows rose so high they could have flown off her forehead, and she looked distinctly unimpressed.
"Zank you, 'Arry," she said tearfully above her sister's hair. "Reelly, zank you. I zought she waz dead, and zey wouldn't tell me aneezing. I waz so afraid."
“If anyone has ever complimented on your modesty,” Harry informed him. “I hope you know that they were lying through their teeth.”
"True, that," Ron nodded sagely, though Hermione looked indignant at the way they could so easily let go of an unanswered mystery.
They all watched her stomp back to the girls’ dorms, mouth hanging open. Then Ron turned to them and Ginny raised both hands without saying a word, and took off in the same direction before he could say anything.
It was some time before Harry made it back to the castle.
And I just love Svetlana Rasputin. She's the most over the top bitch out there and she just doesn't give a shit, it's so beautiful.
“Oh, come off it, Potter!” Draco exclaimed. “It’s not for another two hours, and my luggage is all ready to go since I had so much time to straighten it this morning while you were off gallivating with Diggory.”
“You’re velcome,” Svetlana said, inclining her head. “I felt sorry for your date.”
“So? Muggles dance as well, don’t they?”
“Well, English is the first language for the large majority of the students here,” Draco said. “They probably don’t need the translation spell all that much, to be fair. That’s not to say we should excuse their incompetence, though. They could have looked for a more efficient one.”
Ron had not made much of a secret of his disapproval of Harry’s friendship with Draco. He had become much more tolerant of the Slytherins and Durmstrang students under Hermione’s impulsion, but apparently he drew the line at the Malfoy family. Harry thought it might have to do with the fact that Mr Malfoy still made it its goal to complicate Mr Weasley’s professional life as much as possible, but Hermione reckoned it had more to do with his subconscious fear that Draco might steal Harry from him, especially since they had become friendly when Ron was behaving like a git and ignoring Harry. She said it made him feel inadequate that Draco, who had not known Harry at all then, had been much more supportive than him, who was supposedly his best friend.
There were two advantages that Harry could see to Moody being… well, Moody. The first one was that he now knew he could resist an Imperius curse. That was useful knowledge, if nothing else. The second one was that Ron was starting to reconsider his position on the great sin of belonging to Slytherin.
“The most Gryffindor to ever Gryffindor,” Zabini said, rolling his eyes. “It’s like the guy was born with the survival instinct of a niffler, really.”
Both Ginny and Hermione glared at him, while Ron shot him a betrayed look.
“And I made an impression, didn’t I?” Malfoy said, his grin widening even more.
Draco had a free double period before he was due in Alchemy, which left him conveniently free to try and root Harry out. He was faily certain the boy would not be attending his classes that morning, which only left Draco with the matter of figuring out wherever else in the immense castle he had elected to hide.
“Krum has more than enough fans already, he can do without me,” Draco brushed her off. “Besides, he doesn’t mind, do you, Viktor?” He nudged the man himself, who was currently absorbed in watching something with the same intent face he always sported during one of his matches. “He would even wear the badge if I made him one, wouldn’t you, Viktor?” he added when that got him no reaction.
“Sure. Yes. Now?” Harry’s surprised by his own excitement.
Harry feels great. Not only has he found a rather promising shag, but also probably won a bet in one strike. "How about we get to know each other further on the dance floor?"
“What a shame, you’re not interested in the continuation of this affair. I feel like I could get used to the sight of a half-naked Harry Potter ducking in front of me.” Though it’s packaged as a joke -not a good one, admittedly-, there is indeed a touch of bitterness in Drew’s voice. Something Harry hears with delight, does it not hint, Drew might really regret the premature end of their liaison? And thus, might really not be interested in selling his story to the press?
Draco smacked his head into the wall next to him.
.  Yelling, tossing his wand at the only thing that made sense.  And then running, running for his life.  Fire and his lungs protesting from how hard he was breathing.  Anger and flashes of green light and-
Neville jerked to one side and looked around himself in confusion.  He blinked three times in quick succession, and squinted at the place Draco was lying on the ground.  Then he shook his head, opened the door in front of him, and disappeared inside.
Also I know in the books, Neville stays in the common room with the trio while Hermione yells at Harry and Ron… but I changed it.  Sorry, not sorry. :)
He closed his eyes and walked forward a few steps, and when he opened his eyes he was on the landing in the stairway once again.
Why in the bloody hell would he die and hallucinate the Golden Trio plus one as first years?
“You don’t use your eyes, either of you, do you?” Granger snapped but her voice faded as Draco climbed the steps, and finally after climbing past several landings all he could hear was the beating of his heart again.  It gradually slowed back to normal but his fingers had started to tingle.
Suddenly the memories came back to him.  Heat and flames and screaming and Crabbe.
of all places??”
Draco and his ghostly form stood up and stepped to the door again.  This time as he reached out, Draco watched as his hands passed straight through the solid wood.  He yanked his hands back, watching as they came back through the door, pale and whole.  He hadn’t felt a thing.
Okay, so little note here.  I’m throwing a little book canon and a little movie canon in here together.  The deleted scene of Draco Malfoy throwing his wand to Harry in the final battle from the last movie is canon in my brain.  But I really want to stick pretty close to the books for most of the storyline.  I don’t want to get in trouble for copyright stuff or anything like that.  So I may change some of the conversation language a bit.  Just an FYI.
After what seemed like hours, they ended up on the seventh floor and in front of a portrait of a very large woman in a pink dress.  The portrait asked the four of them a question, but Draco was too busy trying to calm his racing heart to hear it.
His head whipped backwards towards the door.  The closed door mocked him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Neville Longbottom.
He felt his strength leave as his body crumbled to the stone floor beneath him.  This was the end; Draco Malfoy had truly been killed during The Final Battle by someone who was supposed to be his family.  His last breath left him and his eyes slipped shut.
He reached forward to push the door open to ask Longbottom what the hell was going on, and saw something gray and glittering out of the corner of his eye.  He pushed at the door, only to fall forward-
Because this had to be a hallucination.  There was no other explanation for why a very young Harry Potter would be in a room with a bloody Cerberus of all creatures…
Longbottom didn’t look over at him once, even though falling to the ground should’ve made enough noise to alert the whole dormitory.  Draco cleared his throat.  Longbottom ignored him and tucked himself into the four-poster bed.  Draco’s eyebrows drew down as he scowled.
His uncle had chased him down after he’d betrayed the Dark Lord and helped Harry Potter.  Rodolphus had chased him down and thrown the killing curse at him and... and?
Had that really happened?  Had his uncle really cast the killing curse at him?
Crabbe… Draco shook his head and he tried to run faster to escape his pursuer.  He had no time to think of his fallen friend, lest he end up just like him.  Dead.
“Confringo!”  The fiery orange curse came flying towards him and crashed into a suit of armor he had just ran passed.  The sound exploded around him and the heat licked at the back of his neck, reminding Draco uncomfortably of another time not so long ago when the heat of flames licked at his skin.
Potter started shuffling around for the door knob in panic.  They fell backwards as the door flew open, crashing into the wall behind it with the force of the four children’s fear.  Potter hurriedly grabbed the door again and slammed it shut.  The chaotic sprint away from the third floor corridor was a blur to Draco.  All he knew was the frantic rabbit thump beating of his own heart and the sounds of eight feet clumsily running across stone floors.  He followed the other three- Granger, with her bushy, out of control hair- Weasley, threadbare robes two inches too high over his shoes- and Potter, small and fast scurrying away- away-
"Hey”, she gives Falk a short hug, then looks at Harry “Won't you introduce me to your friend, Falk?", she prompts. Falk laughs and Harry only now remembers Cas unawareness of his polyjuice potion habit and her thus not recognizing him.
Harry blinks, still putting two plus two together. “No, uhh, I’m sorry. I actually hoped to conjure my own.” Has his spell been ambiguous? Was that even a thing? He clearly had
Instead Drew seems to have gained back composure, and all manifestation of passion fades into a simple gesture of tenderness, where his clenched fist recoils and his thumb comes upfront to lightly caress Harry’s cheeks. “I’d like to… postpone, though.”
"Most times I was the seeker," he smirks at Harry. "Had some tell me I’m not that bad. Even if I probably can't match your talent." Harry hears a bit wistfulness from his last words.
"I'm here," he calls, as if the loud crack of Apparition hadn't already announced him clearly. Drew rushes out of the door behind which Harry remembers the bathroom.
"I didn't take you to be that type of guy", her smirk turns to a frown, "But honestly, I think people are actually more bewildered they never see you approaching anyone at all than maybe catch you with an affair."
Heart pounding, he knots the letter to Siora's foot. "Can you deliver this message to Drew for me?" he asks, unnecessarily guarded. Worried about what he might set off with this message, he feels a heaviness attached to the letter, he thinks it a big ask to burden Siora with. But the bird only chirps softly, unimpressed by the light weight of the note.
Drew too has come to his feet now. “Me neither. It was a pleasure having you here. I also enjoyed myself a lot”, he utters equally stilted parting words.
"If I had written it, possibly you would have remembered, and...”, Drew bumblingly takes the floor again. “I just wanted to make sure to hear it from you in person."
"What should I do?", Harry asks, oblivious of their resemblance with giggling school girls.
A second, more detailed look reveals to Harry that the choice of plants is also quite deliberate. "Not magical specimens, are they?", gently he strokes the leaves of an ivy hanging from the ceiling right next to him, without hesitation, unlike what he was used to from herbology back in Hogwarts, where each plant represented a particular kind of danger or claim.
Their first round of coffee follows a second, this time though, Drew comes down right next to Harry with their two cups. This way they might not be facing each other as comfortably as before when they sat diagonal to each other, but the change of seating has effectively closed their distance by a good 5 foot. This results in an arrangement, that suddenly facilitates lots of direct-touch related incidents including knees and other parts of extremities accidentally brushing while laughing or gesturing enthusiastically or simply shifting weight to sit differently. In this arrangement Drew has it also much easier to rest his arms on the backrest, semi-accidentally just right behind Harry. And Harry finds himself in situation, where he can lean back into such an indirect embrace definitely non-accidentally, so that his hair is destined to tickle the skin of Drew’s arm.
"No, and could you please stop having such a predatory look? I'm here to find a good shag and not to convince everybody I'm already claimed", Harry responds half-jokingly but also with low-key threat in his voice.
"What's he supposed to do? He can't do more than ask nicely without losing his dignity. And apparently it was enough. At least I haven't read anything about a Harry Potter outing."
Harry then decides that his plain white shirt would do, gives himself a self-confident grin, grabs a spare flask of polyjuice - just in case - some money and apparates to 'The Fortune Teller'.
“You could look it up, right?”
I can't tell when the next part will follow. Againt bits of it exist and atm4I'm pumped to write but I also have a social life and other responsibilities outside of ao3 (how dare I 😔)
His acoustic sense tells him, someone in the background is muttering repeatedly "shit". Must be Drew, Harry combines. Harry must have stayed the night, he combines. Harry usually doesn't stay the night, because his polyjuice potion’s effect could wear off while he sleeps. Since he apparently has stayed the night yesterday, the effect thus might have worn off by now, he combines. He looks down at himself to check the presence of this instance, as if his inability to see without glasses hasn't provided that information already. Harry panics, as every inch of his body is indeed
"Thank you, Harry," she replies, a surprising amount of sincere gratitude ringing through. "I feel very much like Chinese today." Ron nods in agreement and Harry looks for the relevant flyer from their regular supplier. After a quick skim of the card (purely pro forma, since they all know it by heart anyway), the order is out by owl post.
